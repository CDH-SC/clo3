<p>It is impossible to acknowledge adequately and in due degree what the editors of a project as extensive and complex as collecting, editing, and publishing the Carlyle letters owe to the many persons and institutions that have helped them. They wish to express a particular sense of indebtedness, however, to Gordon N. Ray, President of the John Simon Guggenheim Foundation; Charles K. Bradsher, and other members of the Duke University Research Council; the Principal, the Secretary, and the University Court of the University of Edinburgh; C. P. Finlayson, David Easton, and Miss J. R. Guild of the Library, University of Edinburgh; the Carnegie Foundation of Scotland; and, to an inexpressible degree, William Park, Thomas I. Rae, Alan Bell, and James S.

<p>The manuscripts of many of the letters which the headnotes of this edition attribute to the Alexander Carlyle family, Canada, are now in the Mills Memorial Library, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario. In reference to our table in volume one, <ref target="volume-01/ed-01-introduction">pp. <sic>xxiv&#x2013;xxv</sic><corr>Volume 1: Introduction</corr></ref>, we may now state that by merit of recent acquisitions the Norman H. and Charlotte Strouse Collection, University of California, Santa Cruz, with 223 letters, now contains the largest collection of Carlyle letters in the United States and the fourth or fifth largest in the world.</p></div1>

<salute>My dear Jack,</salute>
<p>Your Letter to Jane arrived here last Wednesday; and I fail not to take the very earliest opportunity of answering it. Your anxieties about our Sister Mag ought to be alleviated without loss of a moment, now that, by the goodness of Providence, we have it in our power to do so. Since my last Letter, I have not seen the poor <foreign>lassie</foreign>; but we have heard weekly; and tomorrow I purpose riding down thither, and disposing of this by the road. For some time, Mag seemed to get very little better, or even as some thought rather worse; the state of her bowels (a severe <hi rend="italic">diarrh&#x9c;a</hi>, and no appetite) was very bad; so that for one short while we felt really alarmed. However, these bad symptoms have been removed for the last three weeks; the poor Patient gets out of bed, eats with increasing appetite; has a natural state of digestion, and seems to be daily gathering strength. Along with your Letter, on Wednesday, Alick brought up one from our Father, which represented her as very decidedly in the way of recovery. You may guess in what request your medical advice would have been on this occasion, where none worth asking was to be had for love or money. I believe, some bottles of good brandy, administered by our Mother, did more service than any faculty prescription whatever. Mag doubtless must still be very weak, she was so greatly reduced: the blister-wound I understand to be healed or nearly so; nevertheless if you come when you promise, it is still likely you may find need enough for your help in fronting the general malady, which seems to me nothing but a confirmed state of what is called <hi rend="italic">biliousness</hi>, the root of so many miseries to man! I hope, were she once through this, her health may be permanently better than it has been for these last four years.</p>
<p>Nothing in your Letter was thousandth-part so interesting as the tidings that you do actually mean to terminate your rambles so soon, and come home to your friends and home-duties. I have said and written till I am ashamed to repeat it, that you neither can, nor will, nor indeed ought to, feel any permanent satisfaction of mind till you settle down to <hi rend="italic">act</hi> what you have been so laboriously learning; and unless Medicine differs from all earthly pursuits I am <pb id="pg-05-4" n="05:4"/>acquainted with, you will find that in it also Action is the best, and, after the mere elements, the only Teacher that is to be had in any country of the world. It seems clear to me also that a man of sound character and medical talent could not fail to have eminent success at this time, in many places of Scotland, perhaps in few others more remarkably than in our own County, or Town, of Dumfries. A universal complaint there is, that no man of the slightest approach to true qualification in Medicine is to be found far and near: I could fancy a Doctor such as he should be, rising into high repute here, realizing for himself the fairest success, outward and inward, that any reasonable man could wish for. With <hi rend="italic">our</hi> Vienna Doctor, I can think it possible enough, there may be a tough struggle before he could fit himself into such a situation; nevertheless, I know him to be a man of substantial gifts and true heart, and his errors must be rooted in him far deeper than I imagine if they can ultimately, or even very long, obstruct the fair exercise of so many faculties as he has, or may acquire. Dr Laing is fallen sick, and Dr Maxwell<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. John Laing and Dr. William Maxwell practiced in Castle Street, Dumfries. For Dr. Maxwell, see <ref target="volume-04/lt-18280331-TC-JWC-01"><sic>4:351</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1828-03-31">31 March 1828</date></corr></ref>.</note> is fallen old: everywhere there is a cry for &#x201C;medical aid.&#x201D; Come home then, my beloved Doctor, with what speed your <foreign><hi rend="italic">Gelegenheiten</hi></foreign> [affairs] can convey you; and leave that pudding-eating City of Vienna, and these ugly sheepskin Sclavonians [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] to fight their own battle forever and a day.</p>
<p>About three weeks ago I was looking in the Map, and discovered the road by Praag and Dresden, which it seemed to me likely you would follow. You now mention that there is another, cheaper, easier and safer by Munich and Paris; and leave it to me to decide by which of these two you must come. Dear Jack, do you not see that any decision of mine on such a question would be the maddest in nature? Believe me, you must decide yourself, even without any advice of mine, for I can have none worth one halfpenny to give you. To me both routes are unknown, and the one that brings you soonest home will be the welcomest for all of us. One consideration must be already familiar to you; the wish I should have, were I in your situation, to see the <foreign><hi rend="italic">Dichter des Jahrhunderts</hi></foreign> [poet of the century] at Weimar. Paris and London will stand throughout one#x2019;s whole life and longer; but only one Goethe will be visible in this world, and that only for a short term of years. I think, I have mentioned twice (to the Poet himself, and to Eckermann his Secretary) that you were likely to see them in Spring: but this is a matter of no <pb id="pg-05-5" n="05:5"/>moment for any one but yourself; and not worth fronting any great evil for the sake of.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John did not go by Weimar to see Goethe as Carlyle suggests. In his letter of <date when="1829-02-09">9 Feb.</date> he replied: &#x201C;It would not be wise to go by Weimar at this season, it is upwards of two hundred miles round, and perhaps I should not find Goethe in a condition to see any person, but in truth the weightiest of all reasons is the lightness of my purse which would destroy much of the pleasure I might have in seeing that great man.&#x201D; He also wrote:: &#x201C;Boisserie [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] has given me letters of introd<hi rend="italic">n</hi> to Cuvier &#x26;c<supplied>[.]</supplied> I expect to stop a fortnight or so at Paris to see the medical institutions &#x26;c. I shall leave it so soon as I hear from you.&#x201D;</note> As to the rest, it is <hi rend="italic">al</hi>together indifferent to me, and unknown to me: so determine according to your own best judgement, only come home to us without delay. If you pass thro#x2019; Paris you will see the Baron v. Eichthal#x2019;s Brother,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Louis d#x2019;Eichthal (<date when="1782-00-00">1782</date>&#x2013;<date when="1840-00-00">1840</date>), father of the Saint-Simonians Gustave and Adolphe d#x2019;Eichthal.</note> who will be your host there. At London, his Reverence of Pentonville<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edward Irving.</note> instructed me long ago to invite you to his house: you will also visit the Montagues, the Stracheys, Charles Buller, and Fraser of the Foreign Review; to all of whom my name will be sufficient introduction for you. So let us know what you mean to do, and when we are to expect you thro#x2019; the Pass of Dalveen!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The pass John would come through in the Lowther Hills, Lanarkshire, leading to Glenesslin, in which Craigenputtoch lay.</note></p>
<p>You say that I must send you ten pounds to Paris <hi rend="italic">or</hi> Frankfort, lest your money run short. With heartiest readiness will I send that or any sum in my command for such a purpose; only tell me <hi rend="italic">whither</hi> and <hi rend="italic">how</hi>. Can the Blacks at London assist me? Or am I to inclose a &#xa3;10 Bank of England Note, and direct it &#x201C;to lie till called for&#x201D;? Instruct me, Jack, fully, and that forthwith; that you may not miss it by the road. But after all, is the Baron#x2019;s Letter of Credit done, or have you never applied to it? <hi rend="italic">Ransom and Co.</hi> can easily repay him and without risk at Munich; only perhaps you had rather not interfere with him farther? Perhaps it is best so: instruct me therefore what I am to do, and I will do it without loss of a moment.</p>
<p>On the whole, I perceive no sense will be got on the one side or on the other, till you come hither and see us face to face. I imagined I had given you most minute and punctual descriptions of our <foreign><hi rend="italic">Thun und Lassen</hi></foreign> [daily activities] here, and you complain that you can understand nothing whatever about it. Know this one thing for your contentment, dear Jack, that we are all moderately well, and working our way thro#x2019; this pitiful existence as stoutly as we can. I have sat for many weeks at my desk, writing duller and duller <hi rend="italic">Articles</hi> <pb id="pg-05-6" n="05:6"/>for Fraser and Jeffrey; and what is worse I have sat reading these four days without stirring beyond wind of the fireplace, so that I am bilious enough. Surely, however, I reckon myself better since you left us. I shall never be well, while I inhabit this carcass; but I am willing enough to be sickish. The &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Duke</hi>&#x201D; has maltreated <hi rend="italic">Burns</hi> till I cannot bear to look on it: he wishes me to write more for him, and chatters unprofitably about <hi rend="italic">Mysticism</hi> and so forth.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In his letter to Carlyle of <date when="1829-01-04">4 Jan.</date> Jeffrey had written that he still persisted in his &#x201C;clear views of the desperate darkness of wilful and audacious mystics&#x201D; and in a passage to Jane at the end of the letter had said that he hoped that she kept down her husband#x2019;s mysticism.</note> I am very much alone in this world. Nevertheless I must go on a little farther in the highly despicable craft of <hi rend="italic">reviewing;</hi> for there are trees to be planted and roads to be made; and man cannot live without money even in the Dunscore wilderness. Alas for the days when Diogenes could fit up his tub, and let the &#x201C;literary world&#x201D; and all other worlds, except the only true one within his own soul, wag hither and thither at discretion! But Courage! To the willing, all things are possible; it is not on outward circumstances, but on one#x2019;s own weak heart that the blame lies. Courage, with Hope or without it, to the last hour of Life!&#x2014;&#x2014; I rejoice much to hear of your writing that long-expected Essay on German Medicine: Fraser has inquired of me about it again and again with becoming eagerness. As you persist, you will find the task of wrinting [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] grow easier to you. Doubtless, by this time, you must have accumulated materials for many a foreign-medical Article; the produce of which will bring grist to the mill, when you settle here, and so long as your Practice leaves you leisure. Mrs Welsh is for you and Dickenson to settle in partnership at Dumfries! Dickenson is studying Medicine this winter in Edinburgh (last winter and summer in London) with the courage of a Lion.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Samuel Dickenson (died <date when="1831-00-00">1831</date>), from London, medical student at Edinburgh University, <date when="1828-00-00">1828</date>&#x2013;<date when="1831-00-00">31</date>; see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18311021-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1831-10-21">21 Oct. 1831</date></ref>.</note> I hope to have deserved a <hi rend="italic">civic crown</hi> by him.</p>
<p>There has been a dreadful piece of work at Edinburgh, with Irishmen decoying people into houses and there <hi rend="italic">murdering</hi> them to sell their bodies to Dr Knox! One unspeakable miscreant is to be hanged for that crime in a few days. They killed <hi rend="italic">Daft Jamie</hi> in that way; the poor purblind creature that went about with a show-box on his back; said to be a brother of Peter Nimmo#x2019;s. It is said, thirteen other crimes of that kind have been confessed; the one that brought all the rest to light was the killing of a miserable old strolling Irishwoman.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. Robert Knox (<date when="1791-00-00">1791</date>&#x2013;<date when="1862-00-00">1862</date>), Fellow of the Edinburgh College of Surgeons, Conservator of the Museum of Comparative Anatomy and Pathology, Lecturer in John Barclay#x2019;s School of Anatomy. &#x201C;Daft Jamie&#x201D; was James Wilson (<date when="1809-00-00">1809</date>&#x2013;<date when="1828-00-00">28</date>), a popular and simple-minded beggar.

The murders came to light when neighbors became suspicious about the disappearance of an old <pb id="pg-05-7" n="05:7"/>Irishwoman, Mary McGonegal (or Campbell or Docherty), who had been killed on <date when="1828-10-31">31 Oct. 1828</date>.

You will write to us the moment this comes to hand; explaining your route, how the money is to be sent you, and when we may calculate on <hi rend="italic">seeing</hi> you. <closer><salute>God send you safe back to us! is the prayer of all here, and of none more fe<supplied>[r]</supplied>vently than your true Brother&#x2014;</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My Dear Doctor,</salute>
<p>We received your many-dated Letter,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John#x2019;s letter was begun at Munich on <date when="1829-02-09">9 Feb.</date> and continued as he proceeded on his journey. Various dates appear in the postmarks. His final comment on Austria was a hard one: &#x201C;a rude, gluttonous, ignorant, enslaved, immoral nation.&#x201D;</note> last night; with real pleasure to find that you were still well, and were advancing, like Hannibal across the Alps, thro#x2019; many troubles, with your broad face homewards. Let us hope that you are now far over the Rhine, Strasburg with Slawkenbergius#x2019; Nose<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <hi rend="italic">Tristram Shandy</hi>, III, chap. 38.</note> and the wonderful Minster clean behind you, and the click-clack of Parisian <foreign><hi rend="italic">&#x2018;Caf&#xE9;s et deux billards#x2019;</hi></foreign> [Coffees and Two Billiard Tables] at this very time saluting your astonished ear. I never was more hurried in my life; being in the very thickest of an &#x2018;Article,#x2019; and hemmed in by Time: however Jane is for Dumfries tomorrow, and I gladly answer you without delay.</p>
<p>I have already written to Fraser, requesting him to forward you ten Pounds<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John had asked for money in his letter. He had said that he did not wish to draw further on Baron von Eichthal in Munich because he &#x201C;would not hear of making any reckoning about the money he has already supplied.&#x201D; William Fraser (ca. <date when="1805-00-00">1805</date>&#x2013;<date when="1852-00-00">52</date>) was editor of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Review and Continental Miscellany,</hi> <date when="1828-00-00">1828</date>&#x2013;<date when="1830-00-00">30</date>.</note> without delay, <foreign><hi rend="italic">aux soins</hi></foreign> [in the care] &#x26;c of your Baron Banker, by such means as seemed the fittest to him; and warning him that I would direct you to expect the remittance within a week after your reading this Letter. It seems probable that the Baron d#x2019;Eichthal will himself be the paymaster; but not certain; and any way it will be settled in some satisfactory way, I hope; for Fraser is a punctual obliging man.</p>
<p>We are all well here, and all nearly well at Scotsbrig, Mag being greatly better, indeed in perfect <hi rend="italic">peptic</hi> health, tho#x2019; the wound in her breast was still open. For some weeks we were in a real degree of alarm about her; the doctors looking quite helpless, and most of <pb id="pg-05-9" n="05:9"/>the neighbouring old women having given her up. She now eats <hi rend="italic">everything,</hi> including red-herrings, and takes no drugs and needs none.&#x2014; The public is in a bustling state here; for besides springwork, we have trees to plant, and much digging, and I got no manservant, as I had meant to do, at Candlemas, but must wait till Whitsunday; and Alick#x2019;s men and himself are all busy enough with their own concerns. Meanwhile I keep within doors; toiling vehemently at an Essay on <hi rend="italic">Voltaire</hi>, which, with another on <hi rend="italic">Novalis</hi>, is to appear in Fraser#x2019;s Review, about the <date when="1829-04-01">first of April</date>.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Voltaire&#x201D; appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Review,</hi> III (<date when="1829-04-00">April</date>), 419&#x2013;75, &#x201C;Novalis&#x201D; in IV (<date when="1829-07-00">July</date>), 97&#x2013;141.</note> Thus &#x2018;mall may be kept in shaft#x2019;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >I.e., &#x201C;things may be kept going,&#x201D; a mason#x2019;s term, meaning literally that the head of the mallet may be kept on the handle. The expression is possibly quoted from Carlyle#x2019;s father who had been a stonemason.</note> a little longer; for Craigenputtoch has naturally enough a wide throat for money, especially hitherto. Fraser asks rather eagerly after your Paper on <hi rend="italic">German Medicine;</hi><note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In his letter of <date when="1829-02-05">5 Feb.</date> For John#x2019;s various articles on medical and other subjects, see <ref target="volume-05/lt-18291027-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1829-10-27">27 [Oct.] 1829</date></ref>, <ref target="volume-05/lt-18300918-TC-JAC-01"><corr>TC to JAC,</corr> <date when="1830-09-18">18 Sept. 1830</date></ref>, and <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310707-TC-JAC-01"><corr>TC to JAC,</corr> <date when="1831-07-07">7 July 1831</date></ref>.</note> but this, I suppose, like so much else, is still lying in the inkstand.</p>
<p>Are you looking at the wonders of Paris; the <hi rend="italic">Pont des Arts,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Notre-Dame,</hi> the Pillar of Austerlitz, the site of the Bastille? Is not there a strange old pump-looking erection with dragons in that very <hi rend="italic">Place des Victoires?</hi> Cast your eye also on the <hi rend="italic">Sorbonne</hi>, the forsaken crow-nest of Theology. You can also go to the <hi rend="italic">Rue de la Paix</hi> No. 9. and look at the <hi rend="italic">Hotel de Wagram</hi> where your Brother once dwelt. Also, if possible, find out the <hi rend="italic">Rue Traversi&#xE8;re</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Rue de Beaune</hi>, where Voltaire lived with du Chatelet, and where he died; and bring me some account of them. Both must be near the Tuileries, I should think, on the north side of the River. Can you see Villemain, Cousin, Lamartine,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Abel Fran&#x26;ccedil;ois Villemain (<date when="1790-00-00">1790</date>&#x2013;<date when="1870-00-00">1870</date>), French author and politician; Victor Cousin (<date when="1792-00-00">1792</date>&#x2013;<date when="1867-00-00">1867</date>), French philosopher and later a correspondent of John Stuart Mill and Sir William Hamilton; Alphonse de Lamartine (<date when="1790-00-00">1790</date>&#x2013;<date when="1869-00-00">1869</date>), French poet of the romantic movement, historian and statesman.</note> or any of these new <foreign>Litterateurs</foreign>? I fear not. But go and dine with the Restaurateur Prev&#xF4;t one day in honour of me, and with V&#xE9;ry, tho rather dearer, another: they are both in the <hi rend="italic">Palais Royal</hi>, where &#x2018;Vice sitteth on his filagree seats, and Improvement advanceth with slow and heavy steps to displace him.<supplied>[#x2019;]</supplied> Can you buy me a <hi rend="italic">cheap</hi> lithograph print of Voltaire, said to be in any measure accurate?<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John had written: &#x201C;The Baron von Eichthal sends you a lithograph of Stieler<supplied>[#x2019;]</supplied>s Portrait of Goethe&#x2014;and an impression of Schiller<supplied>[#x2019;]</supplied>s bust by Dannecker for Jane.&#x201D; Josef Karl Stieler (<date when="1781-00-00">1781</date>&#x2013;<date when="1858-00-00">1858</date>), German portrait painter; Johann Heinrich von Dannecker (<date when="1758-00-00">1758</date>&#x2013;<date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>), court sculptor at W&#xfc;rttemberg and a friend of Schiller.</note> Above all things, however, hasten home!</p>

At all events, do not neglect to see him, for he may show you this and that, and will be very kind to you. You must also find out Charles Buller (Fraser knows his address) who is now studying in London; and make my compliments to him.

<salute>My Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I employ my first leisure in answering your Letter, which found me some weeks ago in the heart of a scribbling-bout; writing, as too often my case, against Time as well as Dulness.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For Henry Inglis (<date when="1806-00-00">1806</date>&#x2013;<date when="1886-00-00">86</date>), see <ref target="volume-04/lt-18271129-TC-JAC-01"><sic>4:290</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1827-11-29">29 Nov. 1827</date></corr></ref>. He wrote an article for the <hi rend="italic">Glasgow Herald</hi>, <date when="1882-02-16">16 Feb. 1882</date>, after Carlyle#x2019;s death, in which he explained how he first met him. At the funeral of &#x201C;a dear friend&#x201D; [George Cron, <date when="1793-00-00">1793</date>&#x2013;<date when="1827-00-00">1827</date>] he was standing by the grave &#x201C;as the clods were being rattled loud and harsh upon the coffin &#x2026; when I felt a hand laid on my shoulder; and the owner of the hand said in a most compassionate voice; &#x2018;My name is Carlyle; he was my friend too; come with me.#x2019; I need not mention this friend#x2019;s name, for it is not necessary here; but he was a young man of magnificent promise, a school-fellow of Carlyle#x2019;s, and Carlyle wrote his elegy in letters of fiery grief, to be found still, I doubt not, in the file of the <hi rend="italic">Dumfries Courier</hi> [<date when="1827-02-27">27 Feb. 1827</date>]. &#x2026; From that period to this our friendship, I believe on my side at least, remained unaltered, although after his exodus to London we saw little of each other, and communicated little.&#x201D; For further data on George Cron and an obituary for him probably written by Carlyle, see Ian Campbell, &#x201C;Thomas Carlyle and George Cron,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Notes and Queries</hi>, N.S. XVIII (<date when="1971-05-00">May 1971</date>), 183&#x2013;5.</note> Your Letters give us such satisfaction, that I honestly wish we got many more of them; especially as you are so magnanimous in the matter of replies, and make allowance for all my real or imaginary engagements. News from Edinburgh are ever welcome; news from yourself, of your own efforts and progress in good things, are above all welcome. I cannot but reckon it a good feature of your conduct, independently of my own private feelings in regard to it, that you have attached yourself with such trustfulness, and honest, tho#x2019; very greatly exaggerated esteem, to one whom except an appearance of some spiritual worth or other there is nothing whatever to recommend. As Time teaches you better to bestow your admiration, I hope the feeling itself will take still deeper root, and spread still more widely: a man who has <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> to admire, nothing to love except his own poor Self, may be reckoned a completed character; he is in the <hi rend="italic">minimum</hi> state of moral perfection, no more is to be made of him; a <foreign><hi rend="italic">vollendeter St&#xfc;mj</hi></foreign> [complete bungler].</p>
<p>I have often said, and far oftener felt, that Nature had bestowed on you an endowment of mind, such as she has refused to thousands; and surely it is not without real interest that I look forward to see how in the future you will unfold and turn to use so fair a talent. <pb id="pg-05-13" n="05:13"/>For henceforth, it depends nearly altogether on yourself: if you can but <hi rend="italic">learn the lessons</hi> which Experience will teach you, it matters little whether these be of a sweet or bitter nature: the bitter as well as the sweet are but the <hi rend="italic">rind</hi> enclosing a fruit of Wisdom, which is in itself celestial and perennial. Diligence, unwearied steadfast Endeavour; &#x2018;like the stars, unhasting, unresting#x2019;!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle recalls a phrase from Goethe. See <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310610-TC-G-01">TC to G, <date when="1831-06-10">10 June 1831</date></ref>.</note> This is the sceptre with which man rules his Destiny; and tho#x2019; fragile as a reed, removes mountains, spiritual as well as physical. I need not remind you here that such Diligence as will avail is not of book-studies alone; but primarily, and in a far higher degree respects the heart and moral dispositions. He who loves Truth, knows it to be priceless, and cleaves to it thro#x2019; all shapes, in thought, word, and deed, as to the life of his soul. Nay I believe the first and infinitely the most important question with regard to any Student of Knowledge is precisely this very question, so often overlooked: what is the state of his <hi rend="italic">moral</hi> temper and practice? Does he really love Truth, or only the market-price of Truth, the praise and money it will <hi rend="italic">sell</hi> for? Has he conquered his vanity; or, rather since that is impossible, is he faithfully striving against it? If you answer, No; then I can add that on this way Truth, except mere Macculloch and Macvey-Napier Truth,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For J. R. McCulloch, see <ref target="volume-01/lt-18201022-TC-JOFE-01"><sic>1:285</sic><corr>TC to JOFE, <date when="1820-10-22">22 Oct. 1820</date></corr></ref>. Macvey Napier (<date when="1776-00-00">1776</date>&#x2013;<date when="1847-00-00">1847</date>), Librarian to the Writers to the Signet, <date when="1805-00-00">1805</date>&#x2013;<date when="1837-00-00">37</date>; first Professor of Conveyancing, Edinburgh University, <date when="1824-00-00">1824</date>; editor of the <hi rend="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</hi>, <date when="1827-00-00">1827</date>&#x2013;<date when="1842-00-00">42</date>.

Indeed, for flesh and blood, it is hard; and every good man needs to be accomplished with martyr virtues, for he is a martyr (a witness) in his day and generation: but on the other hand, it is the noblest honour to be in the smallest degree fitted out for such enterprizes; and does not the meanest man feel that all royal diadems and Pitt Diamonds<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Purchased in <date when="1702-00-00">1702</date> by Thomas Pitt (<date when="1653-00-00">1653</date>&#x2013;<date when="1726-00-00">1726</date>), Governor of Madras, and sold in <date when="1717-00-00">1717</date> to Philip, Duke of Orl&#xE9;ans.</note> are but the dust of the highway compared with this invisible and only true majesty, that of the mind?</p>
<p>My earnest often-repeated advice to you, therefore, is: Persevere! Persevere! In all practical, in all intellectual excellence think no acquirement enough. Throw aside all frivolity; walk not with the world, where it is walking wrong; war <foreign><hi rend="italic">ad necem</hi></foreign> [to the death] with Pride and Vanity and all forms of Self-conceit within you; be diligent in season and out of season! It depends on <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, whether we are one <pb id="pg-05-14" n="05:14"/>day to have another <hi rend="italic">man</hi>, or only another money-gaining and money-spending <hi rend="italic">Machine</hi>.</p>
<p>You speak about Books, and the want of an aim in your studies. Herein, I believe, your own best judgement must be your best guide. Wherever you feel a <hi rend="italic">call</hi>, a genuine wish for Knowledge, it is safest for you to follow it. Only be sure you avoid <hi rend="italic">Dilettantism</hi> in all things; be sure you do not take up a subject merely because it is singular, and will get you credit, but because you really <hi rend="italic">love</hi> it, and feel the want of it, and find your own reward in pursuing it. For the rest, all sorts of knowledge are available in our day, and the true following of almost any path will lead you into the Temple of Philosophy, which is the best end of them all.&#x2014; As to <hi rend="italic">writing</hi>, for the present, I will neither advise nor dissuade you. If you <hi rend="italic">have</hi> any heartfelt interest in any literary matter; any idea that gives you no rest till it be uttered, commit it to paper, and if circumstances favour, to the Press, the sooner the better. Only if you have no such interest, no such idea, do not in any wise regard it as a misfortune (most probably it is a blessing, for the sweetest fruit is longest in ripening) but simply as a <hi rend="italic">sign</hi> that your vocation as yet is not to impart but to acquire. Meanwhile tell me always what you project and accomplish in the way of study and reading; and for your own private use, keep plentiful Notebooks, on which let your pen be often occupied.</p>
<p>I must terminate my Lecture; for the space is nigh exhausted. I write these things out of various motives some of which you will not disapprove of.&#x2014; With regard to ourselves here in this wilderness, much were to be said, did want of paper allow. Craigenputtoch is a stirring place at this moment: carpenters, gardeners, and all manner of ditchers and dikers are beating and braying the Chaos, to see whether order will arise from it. Next time you come (and it must be soon), we hope your vehicle will run more sweetly towards the door. We are also ambitious of <hi rend="italic">shelter</hi> in coming years, and thousands of trees are planting about us. To say nothing of seed-time, and my poor Pony turned out to harrow, and carting meal from the mill!</p>
<p>The &#x2018;Leddie#x2019; continues in the most benignant mood towards you. Indeed she has three times this day told me that I should write to &#x2018;Henry#x2019;; which I of my own accord had privately purposed to do.

The interest of the meeting of <date when="1829-03-14">14 March</date> was that it brought into alliance both liberals and all those who thought the most effective move against the Catholics would be to remove their grievances. Thus in support of the meeting were Sir Walter Scott, Jeffrey, Dr. Chalmers, Henry Cockburn, John Bradfute, William Tait, and others known to Carlyle. It aroused tremendous interest.</note> Be sure to send us such a thing whenever you have opportunity: the oldest Scotch Newspaper is new to us; for except by accident we see nothing save one <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> weekly.

<salute>My Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Having an opportunity by my worthy neighbour Dr Anderson (who, however, allows me only five minutes) I write to thank you for your kind Letter, and kind promise of visiting us, which promise when you fulfil I shall have many things to hear from you and tell you. Come rather as you <hi rend="italic">go</hi> to France than as you return; for in the end of <date when="1829-08-00">August</date>, it is possible we may be in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, at least from home.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Inglis had written on <date when="1829-06-01">1 June</date>: &#x201C;I am going to France about the middle of <date when="1829-07-00">July</date> for six weeks or so, and going or returning I hope to <supplied>[be a]</supplied>ble to break in upon you.&#x201D;</note> And see you do <hi rend="italic">not</hi> neglect to come: the &#x2018;Leddy#x2019; and I are both very anxious to see you again in this wilderness; and feel I believe a true interest in your prosperity outward and inward. For my own share, I must say, as I have often said, that I have great hopes of you, and almost no fear that with more or less of suffering to yourself you will realize them, or do better. Meanwhile let me conjure you to Patience, which is the mother of <hi rend="italic">every</hi> virtue; and above all to abandon the smallest thought of relinquishing or neglecting your Profession for the sake of Literature. Oh no! That were the head and summit of all folly. We are to be &#x2018;diligent in business#x2019; as well as &#x2018;fervent in spirit#x2019;;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Prov. 22:29, and Rom. 12:11. Inglis had expressed great dissatisfaction with his legal studies.</note> neither does wisdom lie in reading or writing of Books; but in the faithful discharge of <hi rend="italic">duties</hi> how irksome soever these may be. And what of Law, even of Scotch Law, in regard to Literature itself? Was not Lord Kames a Scotch Lawyer, and one of the busiest? Is not Roscoe a Merchant in Liverpool; was not Hans Sachs a Shoemaker in N&#xfc;rnberg, and Robert Burns a Gauger in Dumfries?<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henry Home, Lord Kames (<date when="1696-00-00">1696</date>&#x2013;<date when="1782-00-00">1782</date>), Scottish judge, and author of <hi rend="italic">Elements of Criticism</hi> (<date when="1762-00-00">1762</date>); William Roscoe (<date when="1753-00-00">1753</date>&#x2013;<date when="1831-00-00">1831</date>), Liverpool lawyer and banker, author and scholar, and M.P.; Hans Sachs (<date when="1494-00-00">1494</date>&#x2013;<date when="1576-00-00">1576</date>), German Meistersinger and itinerant shoemaker. A &#x201C;gauger&#x201D; is an exciseman.</note>&#x2014; But on all <pb id="pg-05-17" n="05:17"/>these things I hope to produce conviction in you <foreign><hi rend="italic">viv&#xe2; voce</hi></foreign> when you come hither. Come at all events, and let me try.</p>
<p>Dr Anderson returns from Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> on Monday Night, and volunteers to bring me Books down with him to any extent. I am miserably ill off in that respect in these solitudes; and Dumfries, where I tried yesterday, seems to be nearly bookless. Have you any means of sending me any of the following:</p>
<p>Quarterly Review (any Nos. since this time twelvemonth&#x2014;or all Nos. since then)</p>
<p>Westminster Review (do. do.)</p>
<p>These two I should like much to see, but can get them in London at worst.</p>

Our dear &#x201C;Mag&#x201D; staid some couple of weeks or more (made me a nice buff-coloured cotton waistc<hi rend="italic">t</hi>, I remember); she was quietly cheerful, and complained of nothing; but my Darling with her quick eye, had noticed too well (as she then whispered to me) that the &#x201C;recovery&#x201D; was only superficial, and that worse might lie ahead.

<salute>My dear Jack,</salute>
<p>Jane has wrapped up your parcel of Books; and I employ these few instants to scribble you a line. Let me hope you arrived safe that night by the &#x201C;nearer road,&#x201D; and are now busy with your Animal Magnetism. If the whisky-drinking <foreign>Laird</foreign><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >General Matthew Sharpe.</note> come near you, retire from before him, as from a Priest of Dagon, and seek refuge <hi rend="italic">here</hi>. Nay, why <pb id="pg-05-20" n="05:20"/>have you left us? The instant you are free of Jamie, obey your first impulse to come back. We shall always rejoice to see that <foreign>gawsie</foreign> [big, jolly] countenance; and I promise not to plague you any more about &#x201C;setting up&#x201D;;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >To practice medicine. John never did, in a general sense.</note> but leave you to set up or sit down, when and where you find most advisable.</p>
<p>These infatuated Blacks have not paid me a stiver yet: but I have written to dun them this night;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle#x2019;s letter to Black, Young &#x26; Young has not been found, but their reply, dated <date when="1829-08-17">17 Aug.</date>, acknowledges an indebtedness of &#xa3;99 to Carlyle for articles in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Review</hi>, of which &#xa3;10 had been given to John in London and from which &#xa3;3.14.4 was deducted for books sent to Carlyle.</note> and on the whole, shall make bold to draw on them for that twenty pounds, and give it you, at <hi rend="italic">any</hi> hour you like. So pray understand this, and let us have no more summering and wintering of the matter.</p>

The former was made Dean of the Faculty of Advocates, which is, I believe, the reason of his resignation, and may be called, I think, &#x2018;selling his birthright for a mess of pottage.#x2019; I would not have given up such a weapon to have been made Dean of Barbary and Morocco. Jeffrey should have died as he had lived, and rather than have <hi rend="italic">abjured his faith</hi> at his time of life, he should have planted himself in the midst of a vast funeral pile composed of all his magazines far &#x26; near, and having fired the train, ascended to heaven on the same Pegasus that had borne him so gallantly on earth.&#x2014; And what a poor, worm-eaten, touch-wood structure will it now dwindle into under the contracting influence of its mongrel Editor;&#x2014; the mere paltry engine of a local party, instead of the voice of a true man to a free land.&#x201D; Jeffrey was formally and unanimously elected Dean of the Faculty of Advocates on <date when="1829-07-02">2 July</date>, a position which, according to his biographer Cockburn, &#x201C;is merely a station of honour; but &#x2026; the highest honour of the kind that can be conferred in Scotland&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Life of Lord Jeffrey</hi>, <date when="1852-00-00">1852</date>, I, 282). Carlyle recalls Jeffrey#x2019;s &#x201C;great pleasure&#x201D; at the appointment and &#x201C;my surprise at the real delight he showed in this proof of general regard from his fellow Advocates&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi>, II, 256). Yet Jeffrey appears to have assumed his appointment as a duty. It was the commencement of a new political career.
<p>Edward Irving had written to Carlyle on <date when="1829-05-30">30 May</date>, expressing a critical view of what he thought was worldly ambition on Jeffrey#x2019;s part: &#x201C;Francis Jeffrey said you have not enough of worldly wisdom<supplied>[.]</supplied> But M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> J. there is a wisdom of a higher and better kind which cometh from above. Oh yes but not for worldly purposes. Certainly not but I love my friend and hope to see his affections set upon the things above.

<salute>My Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>We set off early tomorrow morning; and with this brief Farewell I send you notice that I have returned <hi rend="italic">Diderot#x2019;s works</hi> to the Signet Library, and seen them marked out;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Denis Diderot (<date when="1713-00-00">1713</date>&#x2013;<date when="1784-00-00">84</date>), French encyclopedist and philosopher.

The edition he returned to the Signet Library must have been the <hi rend="italic">Oeuvres</hi> (Paris, <date when="1798-00-00">1798</date>) in 15 vols.</note> so that you have still a vacant place in your List. I found there was not room in our Boxes for packing Diderot, and little chance of my getting him read soon. I will apply again, when I am in want.</p>
<p>Pray write me a long Letter very soon; and hold yourself ready to visit us by your earliest leisure. Meanwhile think of me often and kindly, as I do of you.</p>

<salute>My Dear Jack,</salute>
<p>I write this short note to say that we are returned, this day by way of Thornhill, and I for my share very weary of all racketting and rioting either in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> or elsewhere. For you, and my <hi rend="italic">old</hi> Friends (my oldest and best and ever-dear Friends) at Scotsbrig, I have a brief greeting to send by Alick who is riding down tomorrow.</p>
<p>We have been very kindly received in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, and seemed even to be a sort of Lions there: but of all this afterwards. For my Father I have brought home&#x2014;a little morsel of a tobacco; for my Mother also a certain meagre present; and who knows whether this is not <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the good I have done in my expedition? I will send a parcel with these things next Wednesday, and a Letter to my Mother. It will contain also a <hi rend="italic">Foreign Review</hi>, which the &#x201C;<foreign>snaffle</foreign> Young&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A <hi rend="italic">snaffler</hi> is a mean and shallow person. Young is very probably one of the Youngs of the firm Black, Young &#x26; Young, publishers of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Review</hi>.</note> left at Craigcrook<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Country home of Francis Jeffrey.</note> for you.</p>
<p>Both your Papers<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >One is a review of <hi rend="italic">Deutschland, oder Briefe eines in Deutschland reisenden Deutschen</hi> Germany, or Letters of a German Traveling in Germany, Stuttgart (<date when="1826-00-00">1826</date>&#x2013;<date when="1829-00-00">29</date>), by Dr. Weber; the other is probably a review of T. W. G. Benedict#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Hand buch der Praktischen Augenheilkunde</hi> [Handbook of Practical Eye-Medicine]. See the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Review</hi>, IV (<date when="1829-10-00">Oct. 1829</date>), 292&#x2013;308 and 512&#x2013;14.</note> are in that Number; this is good news for you: I even saw a long Extract from your Dr Weber in an Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Newspaper. Farther, your Article on <hi rend="italic">Animal Magnetism</hi> is in types; and I partly expect that the Proofs of it will be in Dumfries today, in which case I have instructed Alick to send them down to you. Fraser wrote me that they would be sent along with my <hi rend="italic">Jean Paul</hi>, which the unhappy people did <hi rend="italic">not</hi> print last time; a piece of ill luck for me, as the &#xa3;50 would have been very desirable at present. However Jeffrey has paid me; and we must try to struggle thro#x2019;. I am going to set about another Paper, on <hi rend="italic">Schiller</hi>, to &#x201C;keep mall in shaft&#x201D; [to keep things going].<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-05/lt-18290305-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1829-03-05">5 March</date></ref>.</note> We have yet made no bargain about the &#x201C;History of Germ. Lit.&#x201D;; but I send off my final offer to Fraser today, and it seems probable he will accept it. If not, I write <hi rend="italic">Luther</hi>,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Fraser had written to Carlyle on <date when="1829-08-03">3 Aug.</date> that Black, Young &#x26; Young were &#x201C;perfectly willing to close with you for your life of Luther&#x2014;either when it is finished or partly so.&#x201D;</note> and live as the Fates shall appoint, were it on bread and water.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-05-24" n="05:24"/>Many persons were inquiring zealously for you in Edinburgh: Sir W. Hamilton requested the honour of seeing you when you came, to have some talk on Germany and Animal Magnetism. Nay here is still more hopeful news, in a Letter from Mrs Montagu, written ten days ago, but only read tonight: &#x201C;Will you tell Doctor Carlyle that there is a very good opening for a Physician at Warwick, within two miles of Leamington [a fashionable watering-place]<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The brackets are Carlyle#x2019;s.</note> and 15 of Birmingham: Badams thinks that a clever man must succeed there. It is worth an immediate looking after, or the place will be occupied.&#x201D; Now what say you, Doctor? O that weary want of cash! But you have now a <hi rend="italic">right</hi> to draw on the Blacks for cash, and I myself can furnish you with a little in the meanwhile; and really you should in almost <hi rend="italic">any</hi> case bestir yourself. It is worth writing to Badams to inquire: tho#x2019; I fear, I fear, Mrs M. paints too much <foreign><hi rend="italic">en beau</hi></foreign> [in a fine style].<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In her letter to Jane of <date when="1829-10-22">22 Oct.</date> Mrs. Montagu had written: &#x201C;We were a fortnight with Mr Badams &#x26; his Bride, for it was our first visit, he is pleasantly situated in all things except his overwhelming and distracting business, increased to a terrible extent by his large mining territory in Mexico&#x2014; tell your Husband that Badams was so hurt by his returning the little Horse, that he sold it, and has ever since repented. &#x2026; M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Badams is an excellent young woman, with all the truth and integrity of her Father&#x2014; I used to think her Mother like Klopstock<supplied>[#x2019;]</supplied>s Meta, with her broken English &#x26; extreme youthfulness by the side of her Old Husband, but she is grown very large and <supplied>[has]</supplied> married again, and her simplicity has an air of clever shrewdness, and she speaks good English, and the Romance is gone.&#x2014; Will you give all our best respects &#x26; regards to your Husband and to D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle; and will you tell the Doctor that there is a very good opening for a Physician at <hi rend="italic">Warwick</hi>, within two miles of Leamington. &#x2026;&#x201D; She adds: &#x201C;I am endeavouring to forget Cooper, and his last Novel<supplied>[.]</supplied>
&#x2018;The Borderers#x2019; enables me to do so.&#x2014; There are some very sweet touches in it&#x2014;M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Irving has lost her last born Child which only lived a few hours&#x2014;she looked sadly, in health, but she is I am sure much happier in the affection of her Husband, she cannot fail to be so.&#x201D; In an earlier letter to Jane (<date when="1829-07-03">3 July</date>) Mrs. Montagu had supplied some interesting commentary on other contemporaries: &#x201C;I saw M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Zachary Macaulay at breakfast here a few days since. I was disposed to like him because he attacked the Utilitarians in the Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Review&#x2014;but alas London hath spoiled him he is a Conversationist and his friends have become his audience&#x2014;the most popular person in London is the best listener&#x2014;and I have served such an apprenticeship under Coleridge, that I shall advertize myself at so much an hour&#x2014;to you I shall listen <foreign><hi rend="italic">gratis</hi></foreign> when I am so happy as to hear your most welcome voice.&#x201D;</note> But shake thyself, Doctor, like a strong man: do, for Heaven#x2019;s sake, and some share of victory will be thine. I long to hear what is to be done. George Moir the Advocate is coming here tomorrow for some two days, to take the <foreign><hi rend="italic">skizzen</hi></foreign> [sketches] for Goethe:<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Moir (<date when="1800-00-00">1800</date>&#x2013;<date when="1870-00-00">70</date>). Carlyle touches on his visit to Craigenputtoch and the sketches made for Goethe in <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi>, I, 85. The sketches were for the German edition of Carlyle#x2019;s biography of Schiller and are reproduced in <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XXV, Appendix II. Moir published a translation of Schiller#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Geschichte des Dreissigj&#xE4;hrigen Krieges</hi> [<hi rend="italic">History of the Thirty Years#x2019; War</hi>] in <date when="1828-00-00">1828</date>.

<salute>My Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>We have a friend here at present, who requires to be conveyed tomorrow to Thornhill for meeting the Edinburgh Coach; and it strikes me to ask whether you could not favour us with your Gig for that duty. If so, you may depend on proper care being taken of the vehicle; which, indeed, I myself am to drive, and return to you, barring accidents, on Saturday Morning. For your farther satisfaction I might add that our guest is bodily (not spiritually) one of the lightest of men; no other than Mr George Moir, the Translator of Schiller, and a prosperous Advocate, of whom you may have already heard.</p>

<salute>Dear and Honoured Sir,</salute>
<p>I must no longer postpone acknowledging these welcome messages from Weimar: your Letter, <note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dated at Weimar, <date when="1829-07-06">6 July</date>. In Norton, <hi rend="italic">GC</hi>, with translation, pp. 145&#x2013;51.</note> which reached us early in <date when="1829-09-00">September</date>; and the Packet, therein announced, which duly followed it, about four weeks ago. Both, with all their much-valued contents, arrived in perfect safety and entireness; giving curious proof of the complete arrangements for transport, in these times, whereby the most delicate article can penetrate thro#x2019; unknown nations, tumultuous cities, and over wild seas, from the heart of the Continent, even into these desarts; and what is stranger still, how a voice of Affection from the Mind we honour most in this age can convey itself into minds that lie, in every sense, so far divided from it. Six years ago, I should have reckoned the possibility of a Letter, of a Present, from Goethe to <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, little less wondrous and dreamlike than from Shakspeare or Homer. Yet so it is: the Man, to whom I owe more than to any other, namely some measure of spiritual Light and Freedom, is no longer a mere &#x201C;airy tongue&#x201D; to me;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;And airy tongues that syllable men#x2019;s names&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Comus</hi>, l. 208).</note> but a Living Man, with feelings which, in many kindest ways, reply and correspond to my own! Let me pray only that it may long continue; and if the Scholar cannot meet with his Teacher, face to face, in this world, may some higher, perennial meeting, amid inconceivable environments, be appointed them in another!</p>
<p>But descending from these lofty possibilities, accept my best gratitude for your friendly feelings, so often and gracefully manifested towards me, which, in this prose Earth, were precious, coming even from the commonest man. To you, our best return is to profit more and more by the good you have done us, to appropriate and practice more and more than high Wisdom, which we with the whole world have to learn from you. My Wife bids me say that she intends to read your entire Works this winter; so that, any evening, when the candles are lit, you can fancy a fair Friend assiduously studying you, &#x201C;far over the Sea&#x201D;; one little light and living point amid the boundless Solitude and Night. She finished the <hi rend="italic">Wahlverwandtschaften</hi> [<hi rend="italic">Elective <pb id="pg-05-27" n="05:27"/>Affinities</hi>]<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Published in <date when="1809-00-00">1809</date>.</note> very lately, with high admiration; and a sorrow for poor Ottilie, which, she admits, expressed itself in &#x201C;streams of tears.&#x201D; Shallow censurers of the &#x201C;Morality&#x201D; of the Work, who are not altogether wanting here, she withstands with true female zeal.</p>
<p>To your own living Ottilie<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Goethe#x2019;s daughter-in-law.</note> she requests me, moreover, to present her best thanks for that beautiful gift:<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Goethe had written: &#x201C;At the bottom of the little box there is lying a gift sent by the ladies of my family, with the friendliest feelings. This wall-ornament (called in French a <foreign><hi rend="italic">semaini&#xE8;re</hi></foreign>) is to remind you pleasantly of us every day of the week, and indeed at many an hour of the day.&#x201D;</note> it hangs in our drawing-room, admired by all for its workmanship; and to us far more precious for the hand and the household, of which it is an hourly memorial. The fair Artist, as I understand, is ere long to be thanked more specially, and in due form, by the receiver herself.</p>
<p>With my own share of the Packet<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >It included the first part of Goethe#x2019;s correspondence with Schiller and final proof-sheets of Carlyle#x2019;s book on Schiller in German translation.</note> I feel not less contented. Especially glad was I to find my old favourite the <hi rend="italic">Wanderjahre</hi> so considerably enlarged: the new portions of the Book it was my very first business to read; and I can already discover no little matter for reflexion in that wonderful <hi rend="italic">Makarie</hi>, and the many other extensions, and new tendencies, which that most beautiful of all Fragments has hereby acquired. The <hi rend="italic">Briefwechsel</hi> [Goethe-Schiller correspondence] I have also read; and must soon read again; purposing to make it the handle for an Essay on <hi rend="italic">Schiller</hi>, in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Review</hi>.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >An essay on Schiller by Carlyle appeared in <hi rend="italic">Fraser#x2019;s Magazine</hi>, <date when="1831-03-00">March 1831</date>; and his &#x201C;Schiller, Goethe, and Madame de Sta&#xEB;l&#x201D; appeared in the same magazine for <date when="1832-03-00">March 1832</date>.</note> I particularly admired the honourable relation that displays itself between Schiller and his Friend; the frankness in mutual giving and receiving; the noble effort on both sides: a reverence for foreign excellence is finely united with a modest self-dependence, in Schiller; whose simple, high, earnest nature again comes into clear light, in this Correspondence. The Proof-sheets of the Translation from my poor <hi rend="italic">Life of Schiller</hi> affected me with various feelings; among which, regret at the essential triviality of the Original was nowise wanting. I wrote the little Book honestly enough, yet under too much constraint: it has not the free flow of a Book, but the cold buckram character of a College-Exercise. The Translation, with two or three very unimportant mistakes of meaning, seems excellently done; far better than such a work deserves.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Farbenlehre</hi> [<hi rend="italic">The Theory</hi> (or <hi rend="italic">Science</hi>) <hi rend="italic">of Color</hi>], which you <pb id="pg-05-28" n="05:28"/>are so good as offer me, I have never seen, and shall thankfully accept, and study; having long had a curiosity after it. Natural Philosophy, Opticks among the other branches, was for many years my favourite, or rather my exclusive pursuit; a circumstance which I must reckon of no little import, for good and evil, in my intellectual life. The mechanical style in which all these things are treated here, and in France, where my only teachers were, had already begun to sicken me; when other far more pressing investigations, of a humane interest, altogether detached me from Mathematics whether pure or applied.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle wrote in <date when="1866-00-00">1866</date>: &#x201C;Perhaps it was mainly the accident that poor Leslie [Professor John Leslie], alone of my Professors, had some genius in his business, and awoke a certain enthusiasm in me. For several years, from <date when="1813-00-00">1813</date> onwards (perhaps 7 in <hi rend="italic">all</hi>), &#x2018;Geometry#x2019; shone before me as undoubtedly the <hi rend="italic">noblest</hi> of all sciences; and I prosecuted it (or Mathematics generally) in all my best hours and moods,&#x2014;tho#x2019; far more pregnant inquiries were rising in me, and gradually <hi rend="italic">engrossing</hi> me, <hi rend="italic">heart</hi> as well as head. So that, about <date when="1820-00-00">1820</date> or <date when="1821-00-00">#x2019;21</date>, I had entirely thrown Mathematics aside; and, except in one or two brief spurts, lasting perhaps a couple of days, and more or less of a morbid nature, have never in the least regarded it farther&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Two Reminiscences</hi>, p. 36).</note> I still remember that it was the desire to read <hi rend="italic">Werner#x2019;s</hi> Mineralogical doctrines in the original, that first set me on studying German;<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Those of the great German geologist, Abraham Gottlob Werner (<date when="1750-00-00">1750</date>&#x2013;<date when="1817-00-00">1817</date>). On another occasion Carlyle said that &#x201C;the first book that made me desire to know German was Madame de Sta&#xEB;l#x2019;s &#x2018;Allemagne#x2019;&#x201D; (Arthur A. Adrian, &#x201C;Dean Stanley#x2019;s Report of Conversations with Carlyle,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Victorian Studies</hi>, I [<date when="1957-09-00">Sept. 1957</date>], 74). The fullest account of Carlyle#x2019;s first learning of German is to be found in <hi rend="italic">Two Reminiscences</hi>, pp. 42&#x2013;5.</note> where truly I found a mine, far different from any of the Freyberg ones!<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Freyberg in Saxony, famous for its nearby mines, maintained an Academy of Mines in which students from all over the world studied and in which Werner taught. Novalis was a student there.</note> Nevertheless my love of Natural Science still subsists, or might easily be resuscitated; and various hints, which I have now and then had, of your method in such inquiries gives me hope of great satisfaction in studying it. The <hi rend="italic">Farbenlehre</hi>, which I think is very imperfectly known, or rather altogether misknown, in England, will be <supplied>[a]</supplied> highly acceptable present.</p>
<p>This Letter is full of mere business details, and yet the most es<supplied>[sen]</supplied>tial of these is still to come. A little packet, chiefly for your Ottilie is getting ready, and will be sent off one of these days:<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >It was sent in <date when="1829-12-00">mid-December</date>. See <ref target="volume-05/lt-18291215-JWC-MAC-01">JWC to MAC, [<date when="1829-12-15">15 Dec.</date>]</ref>.</note> it is also to contain the Sketches, of our house, and neighbourhood, such as you required; and will come most probably by the Messrs Parish of Hamburg, whose courtesy and punctuality in such matters I have often admired. I might mention also that there is a Herr Herbig, Bookseller in Leipzig, Agent for the Publishers of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Review</hi> <pb id="pg-05-29" n="05:29"/>(Messrs Black, Young, and Young; 2. Tavistock-street, Covent-Garden, London), thro#x2019; whom books would reach me, by quick steam-conveyance, at all seasons of the year; yet, in truth, I know not whether with equal security; or how your communication with Leipzig may stand.</p>
<p>In regard to my employments and manner of existence, literary and economic, I must not speak here. I am still but an Essayist, and longing more than ever to be a Writer in a far better sense. Meanwhile I do what I may; and cannot complain of wanting audience, stolid as many of my little critics are and must be. I have written on <hi rend="italic">Voltaire</hi>, on <hi rend="italic">Novalis</hi>, and was this day correcting proofsheets of a paper on <hi rend="italic">Jean Paul</hi>, for the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Review</hi>.<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >V (<date when="1830-01-00">Jan. 1830</date>), 1&#x2013;52, and as &#x201C;Jean Paul Friedrich Richter Again&#x201D; in <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XXVII, 96&#x2013;159.</note> I have some thoughts of writing a separate book on <hi rend="italic">Luther;</hi> but whether this winter or not is undecided.&#x2014; I delayed, three weeks, writing this Letter, till a proposal (from some London Bookseller#x2019;s) of my composing what they call a <hi rend="italic">History of German Literature</hi> were either finally agreed upon, or finally abandoned: but as yet neither of the two has happened. In the event of my engaging with such a work, I mean to consult with Doctor Eckermann for help; to whom, for his friendly Letter,<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1829-07-00">July 1829</date>. See Norton, <hi rend="italic">GC</hi>, with translation, pp. 139&#x2013;45.</note> I beg that my thanks and best regards may be offered.</p>
<p>All else I reserve till the Packet go. We shall think of you daily, and ever with Love. May all good be with you! I remain,</p>

<salute>My dear Eliza</salute>
<p>You know, or might know that I rarely avail myself of <hi rend="italic">opportunities</hi>; choosing to write as the Quakers preach, only when the spirit moves me. But in the present instance the opportunity and the inspiration are come together;&#x2014;a happy chance! which makes <hi rend="italic">you</hi> richer by eightpence halfpenny, money saved being money won.</p>
<p>Well it is all over! (the visit to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> I mean) and we are gradually subsiding into our old still-life&#x2014;no longer &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">in the midst of everything that is intellectual and delightful</hi>&#x201D;; but in the midst of a pretty extensive peat-moss. Which mode of living is best? in the Sun or in the Shade? I declare I cannot tell: my mind seems to have a peculiar knack of adapting itself to either. I liked Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> last time, as well as I did at sixteen (you know how well that was) and I cried as much at leaving it; yet, returned to our desert, it affrighted me only the first day; the next day it became tolerable and next again positively pleasant. On the whole, the mere outward figure of one#x2019;s place of abode seems to be a matter of moonshine in the long run: you learn (if you are not an entire goose) to pronounce it, once for all, &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">particular neat</hi>&#x201D; or, as it may happen, particular <hi rend="italic">un</hi>neat; and then naturally betake yourself into some other train of speculation. The only thing which makes one place more attractive to me than another is the quantity of <hi rend="italic">heart</hi> I find in it; it is this which in default of a selfdependent mind &#x201C;can make a Heaven of Hell&#x201D; for me, &#x201C;a Hell of <pb id="pg-05-31" n="05:31"/>Heaven.&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost,</hi> I, 255.</note> I was happy in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> because you, and your Uncle, and the Jeffreys, and one or two more were so friendly towards us! so <hi rend="italic">very</hi> kind! And now I am happy here also, because Carlyle always likes me best <hi rend="italic">at home,</hi> whereever [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] that happens to be.&#x2014; And then the kindness which I experienced among you&#x2014;and felt so gratifying, is not a <hi rend="italic">fixture</hi> to be made over to the next Comer, on my removal; but <hi rend="italic">personal property,</hi> to be carried away, and treasured up, and enjoyed here in the moors of Dunscore or wherever else I please. So that the best charm of Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> is still present with me; tho#x2019; its pavements and ashlar houses, its fine companies and <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;fine wines&#x201D;</hi> are exchanged for Sheep-tracks, blocks of granite, solitariness, and spring water.</p>
<p>M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Moir stayed only two days with us and both were rainy; but he made his sketches for Goethe nevertheless. Carlyle took him to Templand on his way back, where they stayed all night; and my Mother with her characteristic liberality presented him with a bag of oatmeal!! It was their first interview; and I think little Moir will remember it. Indeed this &#x201C;raising not of <hi rend="italic">black mail</hi> but <hi rend="italic">white Meal</hi>&#x201D; (as he expressed it) must have gratified him not a little;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">&#x201C;Black mail&#x201D;</hi> is used in the original, Scottish sense of tribute paid to border freebooters for protection from plunder: <hi rend="italic">mail</hi> and <hi rend="italic">meal</hi> would have been pronounced in the same way.</note> I question if he ever made so successful a descent into the country in his life.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Moir sent Jane a covering letter dated <date when="1829-11-06">6 Nov.</date> with a packet containing a sketch of Craigenputtoch for Goethe inside a copy of Calderon#x2019;s plays. He also sent a copy of his translation of <hi rend="italic">Wallenstein</hi>. He reported on a recent crime in Haddington: &#x201C;We have all been horrified here last week with these murders in your former residence Haddington. Alas! for that unhappy village ! I am afraid its Arcadian character is quite gone; for a more cruel deliberate Tipperary sort of murder has not been perpetrated for some fifty years past. I would send you a newspaper, but by this time you must have had it all in the classic Columns of my friend Mr. M<hi rend="italic">c</hi>Diarmid#x2019;s paper;&#x2014;that repertory of strange facts in Natural history. The suspected person Emond has confessed nothing.&#x201D; See the <hi rend="italic">Scotsman,</hi> <date when="1829-10-31">31 Oct.</date> and <date when="1829-11-04">4 Nov.</date>, for reports of the brutal murder of a widow and her daughter, by Robert Emond.</note> I had a letter from her this morning wishing me over&#x2014; And I purpose going the first dry day.</p>

And the Umbrella which h<supplied>[as]</supplied> been in constant action ever since, but I was disappointed that you did not send <supplied>[one]</supplied> line, just to say you were sorry I was gone. However I do trust you will write soon, for we must <hi rend="italic">not</hi> lose sight of each other again. I never loved you better than I do at this moment, never half so well; for as I told you in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> my affections are not getting feeble with my increasing years, but are <pb id="pg-05-32" n="05:32"/>rather, now for the first time, unfolding themselves into right activity.</p>
<p>And Carlyle too loves you more than you are aware. He has talked over and over again of your and your Uncles kindness to us while we stayed with you, for not one of your unceasing attentions were lost on him for all that he looks so impenetrable.</p>

<salute>My Dear Madam,</salute>
<p>After a long silence, or mere listening with indirect replies, I again address you, and on the humblest possible subject: a matter of business, relating entirely to myself. Why I trouble <hi rend="italic">you</hi> in such a case, your helpfulness in past times, and constant readiness to do me service will sufficiently explain. At the end of your last letter there occurs a little incidental notice of some opening for a medical man in Warwick; coupled with an advice from Badams that it might be worth my Brother#x2019;s attention. Now it so chances that to my brother, at this season, this announcement is of all others the most interesting. The worthy Doctor has crammed himself with all manner of Scottish, English and Continental Science in this department; and ever since his return, has been straining his eyes to discover some spot where he might turn it to some account for himself and others; manifesting in the meanwhile not a little impatience, that no such spot was to be <pb id="pg-05-33" n="05:33"/>found, but that Fate should enthrall free Physic, and condemn so bright a candle to burn altogether under a bushel.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Matt. 5:15.</note> On our return from Edinburgh I transmitted him your tidings; on which he wrote instantly to Badams for further information; wrote also to me that he thought the outlook highly promising; and in fine, this night, has ridden up hither, some five and thirty miles (from Scotsbrig) to take counsel with me on the subject, and lament that Badams has given him no answer. My petition, therefore, is that <hi rend="italic">you</hi> would have the goodness to help the honest Adventurer in this affair, and procure for him, by such ways as lie open to you, what light can be had in regard to the actual, practical aspect it presents. My own opinion is that a very little encouragement would bring the man to Warwick, for he is fond of England, and utterly wearied of idleness, as <hi rend="italic">passiveness</hi> at his age may with little injustice be named. My devout prayer too has long been that he were settled somewhere, with any rational prospect: for he has a real solidity, both talent and character, as I judge, and wants nothing but Action to make him a very sufficient fellow. Do pray, therefore, help the embryo Hippocrates a little, if you can! He will wait here some eight days, in expectation of your writing, and perhaps also persuading Badams to write: nay at any time I can forward the news to him into Annandale, within a week of their arrival.

<salute>Dear Jack,</salute>
<p>I hope, Macadam carried you down handsomely, and that you found all well, or at least the sick recovering.</p>
<p>We have no news since you left us;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John seems to have brought his sister Jean Carlyle with him to visit Craigenputtoch on <date when="1829-11-13">13 Nov.</date> See <ref target="volume-05/lt-18291113-TC-ADBM-01">TC to ADBM, <date when="1829-11-13">13 Nov.</date></ref> When John returned to Scotsbrig, Jean remained at Craigenputtoch. Carlyle had not yet received Mrs. Montagu#x2019;s letter of <date when="1829-11-19">19 Nov.</date></note> no Letters on Wednesday, but one from Sunny Bank (Haddington), and Moir#x2019;s with the much longed for Parcel of Schillers; which last also proves comfortably that the Letters <hi rend="italic">went,</hi> and that yours also may in due time be answered. The other parcel from Moir was again forgotten, but it will keep. <pb id="pg-05-35" n="05:35"/>That you did not hear from Badams I likewise infer. The instant Mrs Montagu#x2019;s Letter arrives, I will despatch it, or come with it: till then, there is no speculating on the matter.</p>
<p>Jane is not quite recovered yet, but better: she was for Templand today, had it not rained. I myself am busy with Schiller, and advancing much faster than you saw me: at a steady butter-and-eggs pace; having simply made up my mind to write in a shallow manner for this once. I expect to be done by the time set, tho#x2019; scarcely earlier, for the business may grow on my hands.</p>
<p>Elliott &#x26; Rob<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Joe Elliott was the Carlyles#x2019; new manservant. See TC#x2019;s Notes to <ref target="volume-05/lt-18291215-JWC-MAC-01">JWC to MAC [<date when="1829-12-15">15 Dec.</date>]</ref>. Rob Austin is the servant boy (factotum) at Craigenputtoch.</note> are expected back on Wednesday, at farthest on Thursday. I hope their cart and barrow are ready: they will not forget the old bed. They have also to call at our Uncle John#x2019;s in Dumfries for a <hi rend="italic">stone</hi> (to contract the Kitchen Chimney with); and probably at a Glaziers for skylight glass (Alick being to bargain with one, we hope, on Wednesday): but Rob will have instructions; at all events, will call at Jenny#x2019;s, and get them.</p>
<p>Jane and I have a controversy whether Jamie engaged to cause Willie Robison make her an ashes-bucket, yea or no. In the latter case, if Wullie could still have such a thing ready, it would be highly acceptable. A common vulgar Annandale <foreign><hi rend="italic">Ass-bred</hi></foreign><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Both <hi rend="italic">ass</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ase</hi> mean <hi rend="italic">ashes</hi> in Annandale speech; <hi rend="italic">bred</hi> is <hi rend="italic">board</hi> or <hi rend="italic">bucket</hi>. William Robinson was an Ecclefechan shop keeper.</note> is the article we want, none of your fashionable dirtery: an<supplied>[d perha]</supplied>ps there were still time before Wednesday.</p>
<p>We have two Newspapers here, which Alick is reading tonight: I will bid him send them with Rob. Tell my Mother, I shall soon have Old Pipes for her, of a quite superior quality; Edinburgh Pipes!</p>
<p>Write by return of Rob, and tell me specially whether my Father#x2019;s cold is mended. See if you can keep him in the house, and persuade him to salts: the whole, I trust, will soon be past, or is so already.</p>
<p>I am in &#x201C;pretty fairish&#x201D; health, tho#x2019; I have not been out all day; it was too drizzly. The Masons and Joiners are to leave us tomorrow; I hope, forever and a day.

<salute>My Dear Jack,</salute>
<p>I have a piece of good news for you, which, as there is an opportunity for Dumfries tomorrow, I lose no time in transmitting.</p>
<p>Mrs Montagu has sent a Letter,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dated <date when="1829-11-19">19 Nov.</date></note> apparently without loss of time, for it answers the other precisely in a week: I forward you some Extracts from it, meaning to send the whole, if you wish it, on Wednesday:</p>
<p>&#x201C;I have written,&#x201D; she says, &#x201C;to Mrs Badams, her Husband being in Liverpool, and have desired from her a speedy reply to this simple question: &#x2018;Has any Physician stepped into the vacancy which Badams mentioned to me as having occurred at Warwick?#x2019;&#x2014; Her answer is all that can be wanted; &#x2018;for I did not seek to unsettle your worthy Brother by any communication of such a spirit-troubling nature#x2019; [as the former was]<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The brackets are Carlyle#x2019;s.</note> &#x2018;without a serious communication<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mrs. Montague wrote &#x201C;conversation.&#x201D;</note> with Badams, who viewed the matter in every light, and agreed with Mr Montagu and myself that Dr Carlyle had every prospect<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mrs. Montagu wrote &#x201C;every fair prospect.&#x201D;</note> of succeeding. This adventure will also be carried on at less risk than in London, where a man#x2019;s abilities are rated by his equipage and,<supplied>[#x2019;]</supplied> &#x26;c &#x26;c xxxx<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle omits: &#x201C;style of expence; pills are no longer gilded, but Doctors are, and he who prescribes successfully from a Chariot &#x26; pair, would no doubt raise the dead, if he dispensed his nostrums from a Coach &#x26; six.&#x2014; The Itinerant Quack with his stage, &#x26; his Merry-Man, are no longer to be seen in Villages, they move in a larger sphere, and instead of one Fool have hundreds in their train&#x2014;.&#x201D;</note>, &#x201C;In a small inexpensive town like Warwick, where persons can look coolly into the merit<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mrs. Montagu wrote &#x201C;real merit.&#x201D;</note> of a man, Dr Carlyle would be appreciated according to his deserts; and the neighbourhood of a well-frequented Watering-Place would extend the sphere of his practice, and place him above any little Cabal in the aforesaid small town. Birmingham itself is not particularly well furnished with medical merit; and a clever man might be often called in, in difficult cases, as Badams admitted.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Your Brother has also a <hi rend="italic">good name:</hi> if he had been Jackson, or <pb id="pg-05-37" n="05:37"/>Thomson, or Johnson, or any of the <hi rend="italic">&#x2018;sons</hi> of little men,#x2019;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Perhaps Mrs. Montagu plays ironically on the Biblical &#x201C;sons of God&#x201D; (e.g., Job 1:6; 38:7); but cf. also <ref target="volume-01/lt-18210716-TC-JBW-01"><sic>1:368</sic><corr>TC to JBW, <date when="1821-07-16">16 July 1821</date></corr></ref>.</note> at so fashionable a place as Leamington, a year or two more of difficulty might have been expected: but &#x2018;Carlyle,#x2019; a name already connected with literary and medical celebrity,&#x2014;there is healing in the very sound of it.&#x2014; Will you give our united kind regards to the Doctor, and tell him that we have room for him here in our house, and that he has already found a place in our hearts, that Place, which you,&#x201D; &#x26;c &#x26;c<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mrs. Montagu continued: &#x201C; that Place, which we opened to y<supplied>[ou]</supplied> and <supplied>[w]</supplied>hich you so gladly vacated.&#x2014; You that <supplied>[can]</supplied> no<supplied>[w]</supplied> only be admitted in the train of your Wife, who would not receive our advances so churlishly. &#x2014;I will not however bandy words with you upon an old quarrel, but readily &#x2018;make up#x2019; as the children say, for your pity for me under your Wife#x2019;s neglect, entitles you to my best acknowledgements&#x2014; Mr. Procter delves on in the dreary depths of conveyancing, and his little Wife sits with her three Children, like Raphaels Charity&#x2014;something thinner &#x26; paler, but as full of life &#x26; intelligence as ever&#x2014; She has a Boy six weeks old&#x2014;and two fine girls&#x2014; I had a note from Mr Irving yesterday, and saw him, by <hi rend="italic">calling</hi> to see him, a few days since&#x2014; I went upon business, for like a true woman, I carry my affections only to that place, where they will meet the warmest welcome&#x2014; I will nurse a sentiment at my own hearth, and keep it alive in the coldest atmosphere, but I will not take it abroad to be lightly thought of, or slightly entertained&#x2014;it shall live and die with me, &#x2018;and give no sign.#x2019;&#x2014; When I meet with a Man who can value, <hi rend="italic">pure true love</hi> for its own sake, I will not whisper his name in corners but proclaim it upon the House Top&#x2014; If a friend#x2019;<supplied>[s]</supplied> love, will bring a Man credit, or power, or put money in his purse, and set him farther in the world#x2019;s eye, then will he value it, but for itself, for a share in that invisible treasure (in the light of which I live &#x26; move and have my being) will he give nothing, or at most cold thanks,&#x2014; Is that sentiment nothing which gives life to the smallest act of kindness, is it the <hi rend="italic">act</hi> only that is to be looked at, Let us have a Steam Engine Man at once, and have don<supplied>[e]</supplied> with souls altogether.&#x201D; An interesting comparison involving the status of doctors in country communities just before the passage of the Reform Bill of <date when="1832-00-00">1832</date> might be made between Dr. John Carlyle#x2019;s prospects and those of Lydgate in George Eliot#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Middlemarch</hi>. Lydgate, unusually well trained and of superior ability like Dr. Carlyle, began to practice medicine in Warwickshire about this time.</note></p>
<p>This is all, dear Doctor, that relates in any measure to you and the Warwick enterprize; which you hereby see wears a rather smiling face. If Goave is still sedulously active at the Post-Office, you may have this sheet before Wednesday, and tell us by Rob what you purpose. I think, clearly enough, there is nothing to be done, but pack forthwith, and set off, at least to look at it with your own eyes. You might write to Andrew Anderson<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably Andrew Anderson, Edinburgh medical graduate of <date when="1816-00-00">1816</date>. John wrote to Carlyle about him, his &#x201C;intended&#x201D; and his future plans, on <date when="1830-01-25">25 Jan. 1830</date>.</note> directly that you are coming (I will try to get you his address on Wednesday); from thence find out Badams, who cannot always loiter in Liverpool, and after close practical survey of the ground, pitch your tent on it, or march farther, or <pb id="pg-05-38" n="05:38"/>retrace your steps as you saw good. For my share I think it a very fair opening; and one which I should rejoice to see filled by your person rather than another#x2019;s.</p>
<p>It is late tonight; so I say no more but in case of accidents, <hi rend="italic">will</hi> enclose the letter for you on Wednesday; now that I think of it, your <hi rend="italic">wishes</hi> on that subject cannot be known in time. And so good night for the present!</p>
<p>Jane left me today for Templand, after pining in hope deferr<supplied>[ed]</supplied><note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Prov. 13:12.</note> for a week; and I am left all alone. My Schiller has not actually <supplied>[halted]</supplied> but a languor was observable in his movements; and a tougher <supplied>[effort]</supplied> will be necessary.</p>
<p>I have spent all the night with Alick and Mary in their house, as their guest to &#x201C;tea and supper.&#x201D; They are quite well; and unite with me in best hopes and wishes for this Warwick business.</p>
<p>How is our Father? Write with some minuteness; and tell me about Mag and my Mother. My best love to all and every one! I am ever,</p>

<salute>My dear Motherinlaw</salute>
<p>We have got a fall of snow here which I would not walk in, at the rate of a guinea a mile; and nevertheless Jane is clear for being off tomorrow morning; having a firm conviction that Scotsbrig cannot stand, should she stay away another week. But we will not suffer her to run such a risk; as if she failed to lose herself in the snow, she would certainly catch cold. So you must not blame her, for it is no fault of hers that she has not kept her word with you. Next week we <pb id="pg-05-39" n="05:39"/>expect will be better weather for travelling&#x2014;and even if she should be snowed in here for a longer time; you will consider it is long since she had any vacation.</p>
<p>If it were a little warmer and the days a little longer, I would fetch her home my self: but I shall be with you before long, some day when you are not looking for me. I find it is my best plan to come alone, or with some of the womankind. Carlyle never dreams of asking me to go with <hi rend="italic">him,</hi> never even looks as if he desired my company.</p>
<p>He is over head and ears in business to night&#x2014;writing letters to all the four winds&#x2014;there is a box to be despatched for Goethe&#x2014;containing all manner of curiosities&#x2014;the most precious of which is a lock of my hair!! there is also a smart Highland bonnet for his daughter-inlaw&#x2014;accompanied by a nice little verse of poetry professing to be written by me but in truth I did not write a word of it&#x2014;</p>
<lg><l>Scotland prides her in the &#x201C;bonnet blue,&#x201D;</l>

<p>Goethe#x2019;s Letter in reply to all this is still safe here, <hi rend="italic">cd</hi> I but find it.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dated at Weimar, <date when="1830-04-13">13 April 1830</date> (in Norton, <hi rend="italic">GC,</hi> pp. 173&#x2013;84). In Norton#x2019;s translation the letter reads as follows: &#x201C;The precious casket, after a long delay in reaching the Continent owing to the extreme severity of the winter, at last arrived safely about the middle of <date when="1830-03-00">March</date>.
<p>&#x201C;As to its contents, I will mention first the incomparable lock of hair, which one would indeed have liked to see along with the dear head, but which, when it came to light by itself here, almost alarmed me. The contrast was too striking; for I did not need to touch my skull to become aware that only stubble was left there, nor was it necessary for me to go to the looking glass to learn that a long flight of time had given it a discoloured look. The impossibility of making the desired return smote my heart, and forced thoughts upon me which one usually prefers to banish. In the end, however, nothing remained for me but to content myself with the reflection that such a gift was to be most thankfully received without hope of any adequate requital. For the rest it shall be kept sacred in the portfolio which is worthy of it, and only the most cherished objects shall bear it company.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The elegant Scotch <hi rend="italic">Bonnet,</hi> I can assure you, has given much pleasure. For many years we have been visited by inhabitants of the Three Kingdoms, who like to remain with us for a time, and enjoy good society. Among these, indeed, there are comparatively few Scotchmen; yet there cannot fail to be preserved in some fair heart here so lively an image of one of your countrymen that she must regard the splendid national head-dress, including the thistle, as a most pleasing ornament; and the kind donor would certainly be delighted to see the most charming face in the world peering out from beneath it. Ottilie sends her most grateful thanks, and will not fail, as soon as our days of mourning are over [for the Dowager Grand Duchess, who died in <date when="1830-02-00">Feb. 1830</date>], to make a glorious appearance in it.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The letter ends: &#x201C;I beg you and your dear wife to hold us in kindliest remembrance, and to accept our repeated and cordial thanks for your beautiful gifts.&#x201D;</p></note></p>
<p>The &#x2018;Elliot#x2019; is our new (indeed <hi rend="italic">first</hi>) man-serv<hi rend="italic">t</hi>,&#x2014;an ingenious jack-of-all-work, known at Scotsbrig before.</p>

<salute>My Dear Mother,</salute>
<p>This is a Cloak which Mrs Welsh sends you from Templand, with best wishes that it may defend you against tempests: we forward it tomorrow morning, as Elliott is going down then (with one of those everlasting grates&#x2014;I do hope the last of them); and we may not have such an opportunity on Wednesday. The Cloak is not hemmed at the bottom, as the Lady Bountiful did not know your height. When we get the Gigg she is coming down to see you and Annandale.</p>
<p>&#x2018;Little Jane#x2019; did not come last Wednesday; but only a note instead of her: we thought the weather too stormy. You must <foreign><hi rend="italic">thole</hi></foreign> her a little.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Apparently a nonce usage. To <foreign><hi rend="italic">thole</hi></foreign> is usually an intransitive verb, e.g., meaning &#x201C;to wait patiently,&#x201D; as in &#x201C;to thole a wee.&#x201D; Carlyle imposes a transitive usage.</note> She leads a very quiet life here; weaving comforters, sewing shifts, and wishing or speaking evil to no one. She was clear for being off, on Wednesday-morning, with Alick, after all: but as the day proved, we rejoiced she had not gone. Next Wednesday, she will try it again, if the storm be not too bad.</p>
<p>I hope my Father is getting better; tho#x2019; this is no weather for colds. Try to keep him within doors as much as possible. Take you care of yourself also; till the Sun begin to stretch again. Will no one come hither to bring us word of you soon? Or cannot Jamie or Mag send us a Letter?</p>
<p>For myself, I am better in health than I was: but there are no Books come from London; so I cannot get my &#x2018;German History#x2019; begun; and am well nigh idle, except for the reading of insignificant Books. I have been expecting them these three weeks.</p>
<p>The rest are all on foot; jogging along at their old vocations. Alick clinks away in his smithy, making natural music (and many odd iron implements) under cloud of night. He and I have repaired the Skylight with our own hands, and absolutely cured the Kitchen vent of reek! Mary was off today, seeking a dressmaker to measure her for a frock; and arrived safely at dusk from &#x2018;the Glen.#x2019;</p>
<p>Tell Jamie that I will send him money to pay all manner of Cartwrights <pb id="pg-05-42" n="05:42"/>very soon, that my credit may not evaporate in Annandale. I hope to have no more stables to build; and so not soon to be so poor another year.</p>
<p>We had no word from the Doctor on Wednesday; but expect with confidence to hear of him next week. I suppose he will have written you ere now. His silence to me I impute to his having had no time, and no news of importance; not having yet seen how the land might lie.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. Carlyle had gone to Warwick to investigate a position as physician there.</note></p>
<p>Poor James Bell! He was with us that night John went off; and is now lying in his grave! Surely all flesh is as grass.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >1 Pet. 1:24.</note> Be <hi rend="italic">we</hi> also ready!&#x2014;&#x2014; Good night, my Dear Mother; may all blessings be with you and the rest!</p>

<salute>My Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Your kind promise of a Christmas visit has not been forgotten here; and tho#x2019; we are not without misgivings as to its fulfilment, some hope also still lingers; at all events, if we must go unserved, it shall not be for want of wishing, and audible asking. Come, then, if you would do us a high favour; that warm hearts may welcome in the cold new-year, and the voice of Poetry and Philosophy, <foreign><hi rend="italic">numeris lege solutis</hi></foreign> [in numbers freed from law], may for once be heard in these desarts, where since Noah#x2019;s Deluge little but the whirring of heathcocks and the lowing of oxen has broken the stillness. You shall have a warm fire, and a warm welcome; and we will talk, in all dialects, concerning all things; climb to hill tops, and see certain of the Kingdoms of this world;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Matt. 4:8. For <foreign><hi rend="italic">numeris lege solutis</hi></foreign> above, cf. Horace, Odes, <hi rend="italic">IV, ii, 11&#x2013;12</hi>.</note> and at night, gather round a clear hearth and forget that winter and the Devil are so busy in our Planet. There are seasons <pb id="pg-05-43" n="05:43"/>when one seems as if emancipated from the &#x2018;Prison called Life#x2019;;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Identified by Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor,</hi> p. 241 n., as from Werner#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Sons of the Valley;</hi> translated in Carlyle#x2019;s &#x201C;Life and Writings of Werner,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XXVI, 109.</note> as if its bolts were broken, and the Russian ice-palace were changed into an open sunny Tempe, and man might love his brother without fraud or fear! A few such hours are scattered over our existence; otherwise it were too hard, and would make us too hard.</p>
<p>But now, descending to prose arrangements, or capabilities of arrangement, let me remind you how easy it is to be conveyed hither. There is a Mail-coach nightly to Dumfries; and two Stage-coaches every alternate day to Thornhill; from each of which places we are but fifteen miles distant, with a fair road, and plenty of vehicles from both. Could we have warning, we would send you down two horses: of wheel-carriages (except carts and barrows) we are still unhappily destitute. Nay, in any case, the distance, for a stout Scottish man, is but a morning walk; and this is the loveliest December weather I can recollect of seeing. But we are at the Dumfries Post-Office, every Wednesday and Saturday, and should rejoice to have the quadrupeds waiting for you, either there or at Thornhill, on any specified day.</p>
<p>To Gordon<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Gordon, former pupil and friend of Wilson, at whose house Wilson and Carlyle had first met.</note> I purpose writing on Wednesday; but any way, I know he will follow you, as Hesperus does the Sun.</p>
<p>I have not seen one <hi rend="italic">Blackwood</hi>, or even an Edinburgh Newspaper, since I returned hither; so what you are doing in that unparalleled city is almost altogether a mystery to me. Scarcely have tidings of the Scotsman-Mercury Duel reached me, and how the worthies failed to shoot each other, and the one has lost his Editorship and the other still continues to edite [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>].<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A duel on <date when="1829-11-12">12 Nov.</date> between Charles Maclaren, editor of the <hi rend="italic">Scotsman</hi> and Dr. James Browne, editor of the Edinburgh <hi rend="italic">Caledonian Mercury</hi>. It came after a long controversy and is reported in detail in the <hi rend="italic">Scotsman</hi>. Maclaren was the editor who continued, Browne the editor who was dismissed by the <hi rend="italic">Mercury#x2019;s</hi> proprietor (a Mr. Allan). He later resumed his position.</note> Sir W.

<p><pb id="pg-05-44" n="05:44"/>Now tell me if you will come, or if you absolutely refuse. At all events, remember me, as long as you can, in goodwill and affection, as I will ever remember you.

<p>I must break off, for there is an Oxonian gigman coming to visit me, in an hour;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably William Gray, who was something more than a &#x201C;gigman.&#x201D; See <ref target="volume-05/lt-18300211-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1830-02-11">11 Feb. 1830</date></ref>.</note> and I have many things to do.

<salute>My Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>If this Letter ever reach Minto Manse you will have little cause to rejoice in the arrival; for it will only cost you postage, and give you trouble.</p>
<p>You must know I have partly engaged with certain London Booksellers to produce some sort of <hi rend="italic">Historical View of German Literature,</hi> for some &#x2018;Cabinet Library#x2019; or other; and am busy at this very time in laying in all manner of provision for that undertaking. It is to be in four volumes, and the first should appear in spring. Whittaker#x2019;s people have promised me seas and mountains in the way of furnishing Books: but in the mean while nothing whatever has come to hand; nay I know such promises, at any rate, too well to slacken my endeavours after help elsewhere.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Fraser, mentioning that he was in partnership with Messrs. Whittaker &#x26; Co., had approached Carlyle to write the work (<date when="1829-08-03">3 Aug.</date>); and continued to discuss it till on <date when="1829-11-25">25 Nov.</date> he wrote &#x201C;to agree to all conditions with respect to the History of German Literature.&#x201D;</note></p>
<p><pb id="pg-05-45" n="05:45"/>If in your Collection there is anything that you can spare for me, I know it will be lent me with your old frankness. There is one little series of yellow-coloured volumes, containing a short <hi rend="italic">Life</hi> and some Specimen (one in each volume) of the chief German writers, in their order; Hans Sachs, Santa Clara,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Abraham a Sancta Clara, pseudonym of Ulrich Megerle (<date when="1644-00-00">1644</date>&#x2013;<date when="1709-00-00">1709</date>). He is not included in <hi rend="italic">Carlyle#x2019;s Unfinished History of German Literature</hi>, ed. Hill Shine (Lexington, Ky., <date when="1951-00-00">1951</date>).</note> &#x26;c &#x26;c I recollect having read: the whole of these little volumes would be highly convenient for me. I suppose, you have no special Life of Ulrich Hutten,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ulrich von Hutten (<date when="1488-00-00">1488</date>&#x2013;<date when="1523-00-00">1523</date>), German humanist who defended Luther and disputed with Erasmus; known as a satirist; had a share in the second part of the <hi rend="italic">Epistolae Obscurorum Virorum</hi> (<date when="1515-00-00">1515</date>&#x2013;<date when="1517-00-00">17</date>); and was the author of various other works. See also <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310228-TC-JGC-01">TC to JGC, <date when="1831-02-28">28 Feb. 1831</date></ref>.</note> nor any considerable portion of his Works.

The last three volumes of the Conversations-Lexicon<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-04/lt-18260314-TC-NHJ-01"><sic>4:58</sic><corr>TC to NHJ, <date when="1826-03-14">14 March 1826</date></corr></ref>.</note> (from &#x201C;Schubart,&#x201D; where my own last <foreign><hi rend="italic">Lieferung</hi></foreign> [instalment]<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The volumes of the set which so far had been delivered to him from Munich.</note> stops) I would also ask, if it were not a shame. Unhappy Conversations Lexicon! It has taken twenty months to come from M&#xfc;nchen; and that fraction of it is still wandering the wide world!</p>
<p>Now if you could take those little yellow Volumes, with whatever else you think useful, and can want for six or seven months; and have them forwarded to your worthy namesake &#x201C;Sam. Aitken&#x201D; of Bank Street, he will send them on to me without delay. At all events let me hear from you, at great length; and fail not to give me your counsel, and <foreign><hi rend="italic">gepr&#xfc;ftes Wort</hi></foreign> [expert opinion] in this unspeakable enterprise. I will tell Mr Aitken to wait for your packet about eight days; and after that to transmit what he may have got; for the London Books also are to be consigned to him: the Minto stock, should any hindrance have occurred, may follow at any other time. But do not fail to write, however it may be: the Post will convey your tidings, and we will warmly welcome them, now as well as afterwards.</p>
<p>We rejoice to learn in general that you prosper in Minto; and often we hoped last summer that some lucky wind would blow you into <pb id="pg-05-46" n="05:46"/>Nithsdale, and up to these moors for one happy week. Alas, for the Wednesday-nights!<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Which they had enjoyed together at Comely Bank, Edinburgh.</note> Alas and alackaday! But Time goes on his stern course; and treads our little card-castles into shivers, and the Past will not give up its dead!&#x2014; Surely, you will come <hi rend="italic">this</hi> Spring, and let us recal [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] old times. Write, and say that you are no craven, but stand to your word.</p>
<p>We live in a strange, quite original position here; environed with &#x2018;solitude and primeval Nature.#x2019; Tonight there is <supplied>[mist]</supplied> and black haze, and deepest silence all round for miles; but within is a blazing fire, and a cap-making Wife, and Books and Paper, and Time and Space to employ worthily or unworthily. Come &#x26; see, if you would understand it.</p>
<p>My Brother John returned last spring, with wonderful accounts of Munich and Vienna and Strasburg and Paris, and the other phenomena of this Earth. He is gone two weeks ago to settle in Warwick where some friends of his and mine hold out fair offers. I have not heard of him yet.</p>
<p>Did you read Sir W. Hamilton on Cousin#x2019;s Metaphysics in the last Edinburgh Review? And what inferences are we to draw from it? Pity that Sir W. had not the gift of delivery! He has real knowledge on those matters; but all unsorted, and tumbled topsy-turvy like a &#x2018;bankrupt stock.#x2019;<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-05/lt-18291219-TC-JOWI-01">TC to <sic>JW</sic><corr>JOWI</corr>, <date when="1829-12-19">19 Dec.</date></ref> See also Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi>, ed.

<p>If you ever see Dr Brewster, pray assure him that he is not forgotten here; but that best wishes for him dwell in the Nithsdale wildernesses, which is a strange residence for them.</p>
<p>Your ancient &#x2018;Wednesday-night#x2019; hostess here would skip for joy to make you coffee once more! She bids me send you her affectionate regards; she too would fain hear from you soon. <closer><salute>Believe me ever, Most sincerely Your#x2019;s,</salute></closer></p>

<p>I have only time, at this moment to thank you for your kind pleasant Letter;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dated <date when="1829-11-29">29 Nov.</date> In the letter Inglis had said: &#x201C;I hope I shall be able to accept of your kind invitation to Craigenputtock, were it only to convince M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle, that your repeated assertion &#x2018;that I cared nothing about her society,#x2019; was not true: although you have said it so often that I dare say she believes you.&#x2014; Will you remember me most sincerely to her. &#x2026;&#x201D; The letter also contained a humorous anecdote to be submitted to M#x2019;Diarmid for publication in the Dumfries and Galloway <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi>. In addition, there was the following interesting comment on George Moir: &#x201C;There is however one acquisition made, and the advantage resulting from all this:&#x2014;the acquisition is the acquaintance of M<hi rend="italic">r</hi>. George Moir, although I can boast of nothing but his <hi rend="italic">acquaintance</hi>.&#x2014; I have never spoken to him except on the most trivial subjects, and yet he appears to me (though entirely destitute of wig) to possess one of the heads, few alas and far between, that appertain to the Faculty.&#x2014; His only fault seems to be an utter want of enthusiasm, which I have always thought to be inseparable from excellence,&#x2014;to be the green flourishing plant which fools take delight in consuming in the furnace of folly, and which they flatter themselves they have consumed, when, happily they have only succeeded in concentrating it into an alkali of tenfold strength.&#x2014; Moir <hi rend="italic">must</hi> have, or have had enthusiasm in his own sort (at least <hi rend="italic">I</hi> think so) although perhaps he takes a pride in concealing it.&#x2014; Every man has his hobby;&#x2014;this is probably his, and that he wishes to appear to possess a mind endowed at once with the strength of youth and the sapience of age.&#x2014; Be that however as it may, I should be glad to know him better; although the other day, when he was talking of you, I forgot that I was speaking to George Moir and not to Thomas Carlyle, and made some strange remark;&#x2014;upon which he said &#x2018;yes,#x2019; stared at me and walked away.&#x2014; I think he has made up his mind that I am <hi rend="italic">insane!</hi> because he has become less communicative since.&#x2014;&#x201D;</note> and to say that we shall be truly happy if you can find your way hither in the Holidays. There is still time if you use expedition. Cigars are in plenty; talk enough there is and to spare; and the warmest welcome can at no time be wanting. Come then, if you dare.</p>
<p>The &#x2018;Leddy#x2019; heartily unites with me in this wish to see you. At all events, she will have another Letter from you directly; being of opinion that &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">no</hi> Letter comes hither, with so much entertainment in it as one of Henry#x2019;s has.&#x201D; There is praise for you! Nay, she still calls her pony by the name of &#x201C;Harry&#x201D;; and few horses like <hi rend="italic">him</hi> exist under the solar road.</p>
<p>Tongue cannot tell, much less can pen write down, how busy I am <pb id="pg-05-48" n="05:48"/>this night. Be content with this line, then; and see you make the right use of it.</p>

<salute>Respected Sir,</salute>
<p>The Packet, which I some time ago announced, at length sets out; with true wishes on our part that it may find you happy and busy, and bring kind remembrances of Friends that love you. The <hi rend="italic">Sketches</hi> of our House and its environment are moderately correct, and may serve the flattering purpose you meant them for; as it is not the beauty of the Amulet, but its mere character as Amulet, that gives it worth. You will like the little pictures no worse, when I inform you that they are from the pencil of Mr Moir, the Translator of <hi rend="italic">Wallenstein,</hi> who paid us a visit in Autumn, and promises to see us again in Spring. In return for his workmanship, I presented him with the last of those four <hi rend="italic">Medals;</hi> to which indeed, on other accounts, as a true admirer of your Works, he had a good right. He passed thro#x2019; Weimar, last Summer; but unluckily at a time when you were absent: however, he purposes to return ere long, and make new sketches from the Rhine scenery; and hopes, next time, to have better fortune in Weimar.</p>
<p>The Portfolio is of my Wife#x2019;s manufacture, who sends you among other love-tokens a lock of her hair;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-05/lt-18291215-JWC-MAC-01">JWC to MAC, [<date when="1829-12-15">15 Dec.</date>]</ref>. The lock of hair was accompanied by the following verses:<lb/><lb/>
<lg><l>For the Heaven-gifted still an earthly Gift have I!</l><lb/>
<l>Some kingly robe, belike? Some jewel priceless-fair?</l><lb/>
<l>A Gift no King#x2019;s or Croesus#x2019; yellow heaps could buy:</l><lb/>
<l>True love from Woman#x2019;s heart, this tress of Woman#x2019;s hair!</l></lg><lb/><lb/>
<name>Jane W. B. [<hi rend="italic">sic.</hi>] Carlyle.</name><lb/>
<place>Craigenputtoch</place><lb/>
<date when="1829-12-15">15 December 1829</date>.<lb/><lb/> 
The manuscript is in the Goethe-Schiller Archiv, Weimar.</note> concerning which I am to say that, except to her Husband she never did the like to any man. She <pb id="pg-05-49" n="05:49"/>begs, however, and hopes, that you will send her, in return, a lock of <hi rend="italic">your</hi> hair; which she will keep among her most precious possessions, and only leave as a rich legacy to the worthiest that comes after her. For a heart that honestly loves you, I too hope that you will do so much.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Cowper#x2019;s Poems</hi> you are to accept from me as a New-year#x2019;s Gift; the value of which must lie chiefly in the intention of the Giver. Cowper was the last of our Poets of the Old School; a man of pure genius, but limited and ineffectual; as indeed his bodily health was too feeble, had there been no other deficiency. He is still a great favourite, especially with the religious classes; and bids fair to survive many a louder competitor for immortality. As his merit, such as it is, appears to be genuine, it will to your eye readily disclose itself.</p>
<p>I have read the <hi rend="italic">Briefwechsel,</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The correspondence between Goethe and Schiller which Goethe had sent to Carlyle.</note> a second time, with no little satisfaction; and even today am sending off an Essay on Schiller, grounded on that work, for the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Review</hi>.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The essay did not appear in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Review</hi> but in <hi rend="italic">Fraser#x2019;s Magazine</hi> for <date when="1831-03-00">March 1831</date>.</note> It will gratify you to learn that a knowledge and appreciation of Foreign, especially of German Literature is spreading with increased rapidity over all the domain of the English Tongue; so that almost at the Antipodes, in New Holland itself,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Western Australia.</note> the Wise of your country are by this time preaching their wisdom. I have heard lately that even in Oxford and Cambridge, our two English Universities, which have all along been regarded as the strongholds of Insular pride and prejudice, there is a strange stir in this matter. Your Niebuhr has found an able Translator at Cambridge;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The first volume of <hi rend="italic">The History of Rome,</hi> 3 vols. (<date when="1811-00-00">1811</date>&#x2013;<date when="1832-00-00">32</date>), by Barthold Georg Niebuhr (<date when="1776-00-00">1776</date>&#x2013;<date when="1831-00-00">1831</date>), German statesman, historian, and philologist, was translated into English by Julius Charles Hare (<date when="1795-00-00">1795</date>&#x2013;<date when="1855-00-00">1855</date>) and Connop Thirlwall (<date when="1797-00-00">1797</date>&#x2013;<date when="1875-00-00">1875</date>) in <date when="1828-00-00">1828</date>, when both translators were at Cambridge. Thirlwall became Bishop of St. David#x2019;s in <date when="1840-00-00">1840</date>; Hare, an enthusiastic Platonist and Coleridgean, later wrote a life of John Sterling with which Carlyle was dissatisfied and which motivated the writing of his own biography of Sterling.</note> and in Oxford two or three Germans already find employment as teachers of their language; the new light contained in which may well dazzle certain eyes. Of the benefits that must in the end result from all this no man can be doubtful: let nations, like individuals, but know one another, and mutual hatred will give place to mutual helpfulness; and instead of natural enemies, as neighbouring countries are sometimes called, we shall all be natural friends.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-05-50" n="05:50"/>That <hi rend="italic">Historical View of German Literature,</hi><note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The title varies of this work, which was not completed in Carlyle#x2019;s lifetime and published incomplete only in <date when="1951-00-00">1951</date>.</note> which I mentioned in my last Letter, is now almost decided on; and I hope, in the course of next year, to offer you a copy of some treatise on that subject. My knowledge, I feel too well, is limited enough; but from a British writer, and by British readers, less will be expected. Besides, it is the more recent, and comparatively a brief period that will chiefly interest us.</p>
<p>Were this &#x2018;Historical View#x2019; once off my hands, I still purpose to try something infinitely greater! Alas! Alas! The huge formless Chaos is here; but no creative Voice to say &#x2018;Let there be Light,#x2019; and make it into a World.</p>
<p>Some time ago we spent three weeks in Edinburgh; warmly welcomed by old friends; and looking, not without interest, on the current of many-coloured Life, which here we may be said rather to listen to than to see. I found the Literary men of that city still active in their vocation; and to me undeservedly kind and courteous: nevertheless, the general tone of their speculation was such as to make me revisit my solitude, when the time came, with little regret. The whole bent of British endeavour, both intellectual and practical, at this time, is towards Utility; a creed which with you has happily had its day, but with us is now first rising into its full maturity. Great controversies and misunderstandings, on this matter, are to be expected among us at no distant period.</p>
<p>For the present you are to figure your two Scottish Friends as embosomed amid snow and &#x2018;thick-ribb#x2019;d ice#x2019;;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Measure for Measure,</hi> III, i.</note> yet secured against grim Winter by the glow of bright fires; and often near you in imagination; nay often thinking the very thoughts which were once yours, for a little red volume is seldom absent from our parlour. By and by, we still trust to hear that all is well with you: the arrival of a Weimar Letter ever makes a day of jubilee here. May all good be with you and yours!</p>
<p><closer><salute>I remain always,</salute></closer></p>
<closer><salute>Your affectionate Friend and Servant, /</salute></closer> <name>Thomas Carlyle.</name>
<ps><p>Were it convenient, we would beg some similar <hi rend="italic">Sketch</hi> of your Mansion at Weimar; concerning which I regularly question every Traveller, yet with too little effect.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On <date when="1830-06-14">14 June 1830</date> Goethe sent the Carlyles a packet with an itemized description of the contents. The description of item two reads as follows: &#x201C;Two Copper-plate Engravings: (a) of Goethe#x2019;s Garden-house in Ilmthal and (b) his House in town. As to the first, it may be remarked that it has three windows, like the house at Craigenputtock; and that it served me for several years as dwelling-place both in summer and in winter. I was loath to leave it and to encounter the many cares and troubles of a residence in town.&#x201D; (Norton#x2019;s translation, which with the original letter is in Norton, <hi rend="italic">GC,</hi> pp. 324&#x2013;27.)</note></p>

<salute>My Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I forgot this Review while in Edinburgh; and now take the first opportunity of returning it with best thanks. I think the Editor a man of talent and honest principle, and many of his Contributors very able persons. I wish him all manner of success, so far as he is in the right, which if not throughout, is perhaps nearly as far as any other of our Periodicals at this day.</p>
<p>By and by perhaps I may beg a sight of your Tytler#x2019;s History,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-05/lt-18290617-TC-HI-01">TC to HI, <date when="1829-06-17">17 June</date></ref>.</note> which I should like well to read.</p>

For each of these I have a small wedge steel in the point or face, and with a screw growing perpendicularly out of its back; which screw fitted into the corresponding matrix, and tightly wrenched home, fixes my wedge on the face of the shoe as firmly as if it were welded there; and then my eight wedge-headed nails once in&#x2014;I ride fearlessly on the slipperiest path; nay for that matter, I would ride over a Swiss glacier, had I need. Then consider, in the stable, I unscrew these little wedges, and the horses leg stands easier, remains untorn. When they grow blunt, I sharpen them on the anvil or the grindingstone, and the shoe is unshifted. If the shoe wear too thin, insert <supplied>[a]</supplied> piece of leather. When the frost passes, I lay them by for another winter: nay, if it should be my lot to shoe and ride next year, I will have my December shoes made beforehand with such holes, that I may fit in my wedges, and roughen at five minutes notice.</p>

<salute>My Dear Jack,</salute>
<p>Here is one of your old large M&#xfc;nchen sheets, on which I am about scribbling you a long Letter: there seems to be but one of the sort remaining, so in future you must be contented with less. Your welcome tidings, which we had greatly longed for, found us in our usual state of health: the Letter had been too late for that Wednesday#x2019;s post; the Newspaper was in right time. It amused us all not a little; none of us had ever chanced to read one &#x201C;Life in London&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Bell#x2019;s Life in London and Sporting Chronicle</hi> (<date when="1822-03-03">3 March 1822</date>&#x2013;<date when="1886-05-29">29 May 1886</date>), founded by Robert Bell (<date when="1800-00-00">1800</date>&#x2013;<date when="1867-00-00">67</date>).</note> before; and truly such a concern may boast itself unparalleled in this Earth; one more of the many oddities that characterise this dear little Island of ours from all other Lands. I rather rejoice in it, as a broad fearless unhesitating manifestation of the <foreign><hi rend="italic">rohe Naturmensch</hi></foreign> [rough son of nature], mostly extinct elsewhere; in which &#x2018;natural man,#x2019; brutish tho#x2019; he be very often, there is at least no obtruncation, or castration, or other artifical defect of part; but <hi rend="italic">all</hi> is there that Nature gave him, in <foreign><hi rend="italic">esse</hi></foreign>, or in <foreign><hi rend="italic">posse</hi></foreign> [in actual or potential existence]; and nothing that is true and worthy has yet become desperate in him.&#x2014; By the way, the moment you are settled, you must look out for some London Paper, and have it sent to us: Fraser is very irregular, so that there is no certainty in him, and one loses all the satisfaction of the thing. That <hi rend="italic">Spectator</hi> will do, if you can get no better; but for ourselves we prefer <pb id="pg-05-54" n="05:54"/>the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, if the time will answer. We saw two Numbers of the Standard, and liked it nowise exceedingly.</p>
<p>But to run over into Warwickshire: What is becoming of your project, or rather two projects? I hope the snow has now melted, so that you can stir about, and make inquiry; for, as I judge, you will have no great peace or pleasure till the matter is decided. At this distance, in my total ignorance of the whole circumstances, I can give no kind of advice: Liecester [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] is considerably the larger town; and, except for Leamington, would offer a wider arena than Warwick: this is all that I can see, and truly it is very little, and of very little significance; for I believe with some confidence that in Warwick itself, where also are <hi rend="italic">all</hi> your English Friends, you would make for yourself arena enough. Of Leicester I know next to nothing; it is to me only a fat English borough, without any character, except what it may derive from Foxhunting vicinities, and the buckskin breeches of Melton Mowbray.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A market town in Leicestershire, center of a hunting area.</note> Think well for yourself, dear Jack; and take counsel with your kind Badams: and let us hear instantly what you have resolved on.</p>
<p>We now return to poor Dumfriesshire. We were all very sad to see you shoot off that night from your old natural nest; and for some hypochondriacal days, one could not help feeling as if one had lost a Brother. To me, it was more loss perhaps than to any other; for plain reasons. However, that is not the natural view of it: Jack and I have not lost each other, and will never do so foolish a thing in <hi rend="italic">this</hi> world; or the next either if we can help it: the instant I hear of your being settled, I shall rather think I have found you. For you especially the world is all an &#x201C;unopened oyster&#x201D;:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A reference to Ancient Pistol#x2019;s speech in <hi rend="italic">The Merry Wives of Windsor</hi>, II, ii.</note> neither have I done yet, sad sprawling as I have had: but there is somewhat lies in me, and before me; and so we shall hope to live yet, and see good in the land of the living. &#x2018;Courage, Brother! Be honest, and times will mend.#x2019;</p>
<p>We have heard nothing from Scotsbrig, and only infer from their silence that nothing special has happened. I have written twice to our Mother; once with a brave grey cloak that Mrs Welsh sent her, for new-year#x2019;s gift. She was very anxious about you, as is her wont; you must not fail to send her word. Our Father also was rather disconsolate that night you went off: I found him sitting with outspread palms, by the kitchen-fire, when I returned, and whimpering something about &#x2018;being the means of bringing so many creatures of the human <pb id="pg-05-55" n="05:55"/>kind into the world, and how none of them had ever done anything that was wrong before <hi rend="italic">man</hi>.#x2019; He is not at all well, I think; and more in mind than in body: he has not yet learned <hi rend="italic">to be old</hi>, and the time is now come when that must be learned; he has failed very much within the last three years. But Summer will come, and bring him spirits again.</p>
<p>You remember James Bell of Townfoot#x2019;s coming into Farries#x2019; that night, to take leave of you with the rest.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Old Mrs. Carlyle had, as a girl, gone from Hazliebrae, near Lochmaben, to live with her aunt Mrs. Bell (died <date when="1800-00-00">1800</date>), at Townfoot, Ecclefechan, who was the mother of this James Bell&#x201D; (Mary Aitken Carlyle#x2019;s note quoted by Norton). William Farries was the publican at Ecclefechan.</note> He is dead and buried, above a fortnight ago! We heard only the meagrest account; that he &#x2018;had died in a moment;#x2019; I suppose, by apoplexy, or epilepsy; for he had before experienced shocks of that kind. Poor James Bell! But our tragedies are not done yet. Rob Clerk of Craigenvey our next neighbour here had been drinking at Minnyhive, perhaps that very day you were departing: he tumbled off his chair with a groan, gave &#x2018;a snort or two#x2019; on the floor, and was by his companions reckoned to be dead-drunk. At their convenient leisure, they hoisted him, and his Boy, also drunk, into the cart, which &#x2018;Johnnie M#x2019;caw#x2019;s <foreign>Lassie</foreign>#x2019; (happily sober) drove home under cloud of night to his Aunt: Rob &#x2018;spoke none, moved none#x2019;; and his Aunt carried him in on her back, and laid him on the bed and after hours of sedulous ministering, discovered him to be dead! Rob was once a man that could have &#x2018;turned markets#x2019; with his own purse, and he would not &#x2018;taste#x2019; in those days.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >To &#x201C;taste&#x201D; is a distinctive Scottish expression meaning to &#x201C;drink alcohol&#x201D;; &#x201C;turned markets&#x201D; means &#x201C;to make a difference in the price of a commodity so that it affects profit or loss.&#x201D;</note> But he failed in trade, twice; since then has led a strange &#x2018;wet and dry#x2019; existence; drunk in all corners of Britain from Sussex to Sutherland; and <hi rend="italic">so</hi> has found his end at length. Is it not a wild world this? Who made it? Who governs it? Who gets good of it? Without <hi rend="italic">Faith</hi>, I think a man were <hi rend="italic">forced</hi> to be an Atheist.</p>
<p>But we ourselves have our sorrows here at present. I said, your Letter found us all in health; but this does not leave us so. Poor Jane had killed one <supplied>[of]</supplied> her geese, and the whole establishment was to dine here <foreign><hi rend="italic">gem&#xfc;thlichst</hi></foreign> [in the most comfortable fashion], on Newyears <supplied>[day]</supplied>; but alas, on Monday gone-a week she took a violent sore-throat, and is at this moment close confined to bed. For two days we were really alarmed about her; Elliott sat booted and spurred, in readiness <pb id="pg-05-56" n="05:56"/>to ride for a Doctor to Dumfries: however, at length we only sent him for soda-powders, and other little medicines, and Mrs Welsh was both Nurse and Doctor. I myself have now taken up these characters; Mrs W. having gone off (by constraint) today; and I write here in momentary expectation of a little knock, which summons me up to some duty. [The knock has actually come, and I am here again!]<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle#x2019;s brackets.</note> However, she is now very considerably better, and I hope in a few days to see her well. The rest of us are in our usual way; better rather than worse. We are much more comfortable since we got Elliott; and I have zealously begun riding every day. Alick and I mended the skylight with our own hands, and have altogether cured the kitchen-smoke. Elliott is paving the backyard; brings us roaring fires of coals; and is to go down with this Letter tonight among his other services. Lord make us thankful; for we <hi rend="italic">have</hi> much to be thankful.&#x2014; &#x2018;Little Jean#x2019; came up with us from Scotsbrig, staid here in still cheerfulness, and could not get away for snow till last Thursday. I sent down your Letter, and word of the Newspaper, and that probably you were eating Christmas dinners, and as merry as any of us. We expect a Letter perhaps tomorrow, perhaps <supplied>[next]</supplied> week.&#x2014;Good be with you! My dear Jack. <closer><salute>I a<supplied>[m]</supplied> your Brother&#x2014;</salute></closer><name>T. Carlyle.</name></p>
<ps><p>I have read your <hi rend="italic">Anim.

I durst bet, the Blacks have not paid you yet: they are among the worst payers in existence. They tell me to &#x2018;wait till Mr Fraser return from France.#x2019; I have some thoughts of well nigh <hi rend="italic">cutting</hi> them. When your next Article is ready, it will soon find a market; meanwhile <hi rend="italic">make</hi> the jews pay you. Would <hi rend="italic">they</hi> stay unpaid?&#x2014; I just last night got a package of those <hi rend="italic">German-History</hi> Books; a huge package for which I have waited four weeks, and now it is scarcely of <hi rend="italic">any</hi> value to me! Nevertheless I will collect Books somewhere, and write that thing, and then&#x2014; I will come and see Jack! That is a strange story of Andrew Anderson,<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-05/lt-18291122-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1829-11-22">22 Nov. 1829</date></ref>.</note> and the &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">baying</hi> he could love!#x2019;<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Baying he could love&#x201D; is coterie speech. According to Carlyle it was an expression of a &#x201C;Foolish, inflated English lady, of the elderly governess kind, who once came to us at Craigenputtock (where we had little need of her)&#x201D; (Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi>, II, 181). She was a Miss Benson, sister of Mrs. Basil Montagu, who had visited the Carlyles in the early autumn of <date when="1829-00-00">1829</date>. Mrs. Montagu expresses her strong dislike of her in a letter to Jane of <date when="1829-10-22">22 Oct. 1829</date>. Concerning it John writes on <date when="1831-02-12">12 Feb. 1831</date>: &#x201C;Tell Jane that the memorable l<supplied>[et]</supplied>ter of M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Montagu concerning the &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">baying she could lavv</hi> [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>],#x2019; which seemed so unchristian &#x26; unfeeling, did really give us a false impression, and that it ought not to have gone so far in destroying our ideal of Mrs Montagu#x2019;s character. I do not say this inconsiderately for the letter in question has often given me much pain when I thought of its haughty, unsisterly severity, and I have known similar instances of her outbreakings of pride &#x26; unkindness since I came to London; but I have also seen enough of real affection about her to convince me that those outbreakings were only the momentary triumphs of her Evil Genius. &#x2026;&#x201D;</note> We have mentioned it to no one. Surely the <pb id="pg-05-57" n="05:57"/>man is distraught. <hi rend="italic">Be sure</hi> to write soon, and with composed minuteness. Good night, dear Jack!</p>
<p>Goethe#x2019;s Parcel is off; but lies frost-bound at Leith! Since Saturday, we have a slow but beautiful thaw. Kind love to the noble Badams; and to his lady also, whom I will believe to be worthy of him. Ask him where Tom the pigeon is? &#x26;c &#x26;c</p></ps>

<salute>My Dear Mother,</salute>
<p>By Jamie#x2019;s request, tho#x2019; in the extreme of haste, I write you one line to say that he expects to be home on Friday, with a cart containing some <foreign><hi rend="italic">shotts</hi></foreign> [pigs] which he has bought from Alick. He cannot come tomorrow, for the mournful duty which has devolved on him: he has the funeral of a Friend to attend on!</p>
<p>You will learn, probably by this same conveyance that your Brother Sandy has been called away. A messenger (one of John#x2019;s apprentices)<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >From John Aitken of Dumfries, brother of the deceased and of TC#x2019;s mother.</note> came up today with funeral Letters: our poor Uncle had died on Sabbath night; but the boy knows no particulars. To me it was a sad and altogether unexpected thing; and yet why should one grieve in this rapid race of ours that our brother gets the start of us a little way: &#x201C;in an hour we shall follow and rejoin him.&#x201D; Poor Sandy! The cold winter sleets, and the colder chill of Poverty, will beat on him no more: he has borne his burden to the mark; and the heavy-laden is now at rest.</p>
<p>Alas! how often have I talked with you of <hi rend="italic">helping</hi> him; and now he is hidden from our eyes. O whatsoever our hand findeth to do let <pb id="pg-05-58" n="05:58"/>us do it quickly!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Eccles. 9:10.</note> &#x201C;Hell,&#x201D; they say, &#x201C;is paved with good Resolutions.&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Proverbial. Cf. Boswell#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Life of Johnson</hi>, ed. R. W. Chapman (London, <date when="1953-00-00">1953</date>), p. 624.</note></p>
<p>I cannot go to the funeral; I am disabled (only with loss of skin) so that I cannot ride. I have written a letter to my Uncle John to that effect.</p>
<p>Jane would have spared me readily, tho#x2019; she could not without inconvenience: she grew very considerably worse after little Jane went away; for two days we had Elliott in waiting, ready to ride for a Doctor: but the throat improved a little; and she has been recovering decidedly tho#x2019; slowly for above a week.&#x2014; I rejoice to hear my Father is better. Good night, Dear Mother! My best love to every one. Let us all love each other while here;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. John 13:34.</note> for it is but short space that we continue. Good night I am ever</p>

<p>The &#x2018;History of German Literature,#x2019; for which I only bargained finally last Wednesday,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In a letter of <date when="1830-01-16">16 Jan.</date> Whittaker had offered Carlyle &#xa3;100 per volume for each of the four volumes of his history, payable by the volume two months after the publication of each volume.</note> is to consist of Four small volumes, and ought to include whatever, at this epoch, is most interesting to us of England in the past and present condition of that wide province; not, of course, a minute chronicle-detail, of the Eichhorn fashion, for which neither I nor my readers are in any measure qualified; but views of the more prominent and as it were universal features (<foreign><hi rend="italic">Welt-historisch</hi></foreign>) of that huge subject; wherein it will be most of all important that they <hi rend="italic">be</hi> real views, seen into with my own eyes (tho#x2019; from this distance), not hallucinations, and hearsays, and <foreign><hi rend="italic">Trugbilder</hi></foreign> [apparitions], seen into with other people#x2019;s eyes, perhaps never seen into at all.

<p>You perceive, I am casting myself altogether on your discretion; leaving you not only to provide me with help, but to judge also what help I shall most need. Since you have &#x2018;unrolled your pack#x2019; before me, in such courteous style, I can only request you to choose for me, by your own skill; with the assurance, hardly necessary in this case, that <hi rend="italic">too much</hi> can produce no inconvenience, and too little may cost me serious trouble. If besides the Works you have mentioned, regarding the Reformation-period, and prior (to which, if it were not shameless to ask them, your own Notes and Extracts would be a valuable accession), you can think of anything else that would prove instructive, I shall receive it, and employ it, with true thankfulness. <hi rend="italic">Luther</hi>, I think, must terminate the first Volume; before wh<supplied>[om]</supplied> come all the Fablers, and Satyrists, and Swabian <foreign>Minnesingers</foreign>, and N&#xfc;rnberg Mastersingers; a motley horde which I do pray devoutly I had marshalled into something like clear order. A work, or even the name of a good work, on the <foreign><hi rend="italic">Meisters&#xE4;ngerei</hi></foreign> would be a special blessing to me: I can find none but one of Grimm#x2019;s, which I fear will be but a shallow one. Do you know Docen#x2019;s and Hagen#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Hist. of German Poetry</hi>? I have seen it in the Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> College Library, but read only a few pages of it.<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >As Hill Shine supposes, Carlyle clearly meant the <hi rend="italic">Literarischer Grundriss zur Geschichte der deutschen Poesie von der &#xE4;ltesten Zeit, bis in das sechzehnte Jahrhundert</hi> (Berlin, <date when="1812-00-00">1812</date>) by Friedrich Heinrich von der Hagen (<date when="1780-00-00">1780</date>&#x2013;<date when="1856-00-00">1856</date>) and Johann Gustav Gottlieb B&#xfc;sching (<date when="1783-00-00">1783</date>&#x2013;<date when="1829-00-00">1829</date>), and the reference to Docen was an error. But Carlyle probably knew Bernard Joseph Docen, <hi rend="italic">Miscellaneen zur Geschichte der teutschen Literatur</hi>, 2 vols.

<salute>My Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I now return you the three Books, with many thanks for the pleasure they have given me. Old Ascham is one of the freshest, truest spirits I have met with; a Scholar and Writer, yet a genuine Man. Farmer and Douce<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Richard Farmer (<date when="1735-00-00">1735</date>&#x2013;<date when="1797-00-00">97</date>), <hi rend="italic">An Essay on the Learning of Shakespeare</hi> (Cambridge, <date when="1767-00-00">1767</date>); Francis Douce (<date when="1757-00-00">1757</date>&#x2013;<date when="1834-00-00">1834</date>), <hi rend="italic">Illustrations of Shakspeare, and of Ancient Manners: with Dissertations on the Clowns and Fools of Shakspeare</hi>, 2 vols. (<date when="1807-00-00">1807</date>).</note> belong to a much more thick-blooded, hidebound species; yet they too seem sufficient persons in their way.</p>
<p>I have quitted that project of &#x2018;English Literature,#x2019; and taken into a new track, the &#x2018;History of German Literature,#x2019; where far less will be needed, or at all events expected of me. Herein, I am afraid, your fine Collection, so liberally opened to me, will be of little service; unless indeed you could send me some documents about Luther and the Reformation (Seckendorf,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Veit Ludwig von Seckendorf (<date when="1626-00-00">1626</date>&#x2013;<date when="1692-00-00">92</date>), <hi rend="italic">Commentarius Historicus et Apologeticus de Lutheranismo Sive De Reformatione</hi>, 3 vols. (Leipzig, <date when="1692-00-00">1692</date>).</note> for instance); and any rational &#x2018;History of Germany,#x2019; such as may perhaps exist in French or Latin, but is not, I believe, to be found in English. Schmidt#x2019;s, or Mascov#x2019;s<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Michael Ignatz Schmidt (<date when="1737-00-00">1737</date>&#x2013;<date when="1794-00-00">94</date>), <hi rend="italic">Geschichte der Deutschen</hi>, 22 vols. (Ulm, <date when="1785-00-00">1785</date>&#x2013;<date when="1808-00-00">1808</date>); Johann Jakob Maskov (<date when="1689-00-00">1689</date>&#x2013;<date when="1761-00-00">1761</date>), historian and jurist, author of <hi rend="italic">Geschichte der Teutschen bis zu Anfang der Franckischen Monarchie</hi> (Leipzig, <date when="1726-00-00">1726</date>) and <hi rend="italic">Geschichte der Teutschen bis zu Abgang der Merovingischen K&#xF6;nige</hi> (Leipzig, <date when="1737-00-00">1737</date>).</note> work in German, I fear you are not likely to have. Perhaps even Hone#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Mysteries</hi><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Hone (<date when="1780-00-00">1780</date>&#x2013;<date when="1842-00-00">1842</date>), <hi rend="italic">Ancient Mysteries</hi> (London, <date when="1823-00-00">1823</date>).</note> might be of some service to me; or any work that touches on the general Literature of the Middle Ages; for my first volume should have something of an antiquarian character. Barclay#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Ship of Fools</hi>,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-05/lt-18291221-TC-DA-01">TC to DA, <date when="1829-12-21">21 Dec. 1829</date></ref>.</note> the original <hi rend="italic">Owlglass</hi>,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Ein Kurtzweilig Leren Von Dyl Ullenspiegel</hi> (Strassburg, <date when="1515-00-00">1515</date>).</note> Law#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Jacob B&#xF6;hm</hi>, <note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jacob Boehme (<date when="1575-00-00">1575</date>&#x2013;<date when="1624-00-00">1624</date>), German mystic: presumably known to Carlyle in <hi rend="italic">The Works of Jacob Behmen, the Teutonic Theosopher. To which is prefixed the Life of the Author. With figures Illustrating His Principles &#x2026; by W. Law</hi>, ed. G. Ward and T. Langcake, 4 vols. (London, <date when="1764-00-00">1764</date>&#x2013;<date when="1781-00-00">81</date>).</note> and all old Translations from the German would be highly useful.</p>
<p>Doubtless it is to your kindness that I am indebted for the last <pb id="pg-05-64" n="05:64"/>two Numbers of the Review, which have been punctually sent me. In case of any future book-parcels, or single books, would you be so good as direct your agents to leave them for me with Mr Aitken (Bell &#x26; Bradfute#x2019;s, Bank-street); by whom ware of that kind is collected for my behoof, and forwarded hither, in quantities, at regular intervals.</p>
<p>Mr Jeffrey tells me, the new Number is to be out in a week or two. I liked the last very well; the Review of Channing seemed to me especially good. Sir W. Hamilton#x2019;s Paper gave proof of much metaphysical reading and meditation:<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review</hi>, L (<date when="1829-10-00">Oct. 1829</date>): Hazlitt reviewed W. E. Channing, <hi rend="italic">Sermons and Tracts</hi>, pp. 125&#x2013;44; and Sir William Hamilton reviewed Victor Cousin, <hi rend="italic">Cours de Philosophie</hi>, pp. 194&#x2013;221.</note> but I dare say your readers would complain of unintelligibility and so forth; indeed it is full of subtle schoolman logic, and on a subject difficult above all others to discuss for English minds. Sir William, if I mistake not, has studied the &#x2018;State of Education in Germany#x2019;: I should like much to see an Essay from him on that subject, <supplied>[with]</supplied> proper practical proofs and exposition <supplied>[on a]</supplied> subject of great importance, and public interest, at this time for it must be owned the Germans are immeasurably ahead of us in that matter; and if we are &#x2018;the worst-educated nation in Europe,#x2019; they are much more unquestionably the best.</p>

<salute>My Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I am much obliged to you for <hi rend="italic">Tytler</hi>,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Patrick Fraser Tytler, <hi rend="italic">History of Scotland</hi>, 9 vols. (Edinburgh, <date when="1828-00-00">1828</date>&#x2013;<date when="1843-00-00">43</date>), published by Tait, who had possibly sent him vols. 2 and 3, both published in <date when="1829-00-00">1829</date>.</note> which I have read with pleasure and not without profit: it is a smooth, easy Book; seems well-founded, accurate, authentic; and without pretending to be a classical <hi rend="italic">History</hi>, may well enjoy several years of extensive popularity. I shall be very glad to see the First and all the other Volumes, when they appear. Mr Chambers#x2019;s Books, especially his <hi rend="italic">Picture of Scotland</hi>, and <pb id="pg-05-65" n="05:65"/><hi rend="italic">Songs</hi>,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Chambers, <hi rend="italic">The Picture of Scotland</hi>, 2 vols.

(Edinburgh, <date when="1829-00-00">1829</date>); both works also published by Tait.</note> would also be a treat to me. Your kind offer, you perceive, is not to be barren or unfruitful, in my case.</p>
<p>I am sorry to find that my worthy friend, the Doctor,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably Dr. David Brewster.</note> is still only &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">fighting</hi> the good fight#x2019;;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. 1 Tim. 6:12.</note> more especially that <hi rend="italic">you</hi> are his armed adversary. On the whole, it does seem rather hard in him to insist on the Letter of his bargain, under all these circumstances; the rather as his Book is not yet written, and may be sold for its true worth to some other Publisher, or be left unsold with little lost labour. However, I hope you will compromise the matter: the Doctor I have never found an unreasonable man, indeed always perfectly the reverse, even to a notable degree in some instances: and I trust, most of his quarrels with the Bookselling and other departments of the world, have arisen rather in harsh management on their part, than in unfairness on his. Let me hope, as I earnestly wish, it will all be soon settled, and without open or secret hostility on either side.</p>
<p>It must have been Ben Nelson of Annan that you saw in the Coach;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Timber merchant of Port St., Annan; see <ref target="volume-01/lt-18210109-TC-JAC-01"><sic>1:304</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1821-01-09">9 Jan. 1821</date></corr></ref>.</note> one of the clearest, most intelligent men I have ever met; with head enough to furnish half a dozen Outer-house Authors,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Legal hack-writers.

So strangely are our lots ordered in this world: a Castlereagh governs Britain, and a Burns <foreign>hatchels</foreign> [jogs along with] flax in Irvine, nay cannot <foreign>hatchel</foreign> it to any profit.</p>
<p>If your travels ever lead you into these wildernesses, you will find a tight roof, and a warm welcome in the middle of the heaths.</p>

<salute>My Dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Notwithstanding the snow and frost, Elliott determines on setting forth to seek himself some victual, and I send a few lines along with him to tell you, happily, that we are all well, when so many are otherwise.</p>
<p>Before proceeding farther, let me transact the business part of my Message. When Jamie left us, it was uncertain whether we could stow more than twenty stones of oatmeal here: it is now ascertained that we have room for forty; so that if your Husbandman can let us have that quantity, we shall decidedly prefer it. Forty stones of oatmeal, and ten of barley, ought to stay the <foreign><hi rend="italic">Gallenyers</hi></foreign> [gluttons] a little, were their stomachs never so keen. If, however, there is nothing but twenty ready for us, we will take it, and be thankful. Say farther that I shall in all human probability, get, or rather forcibly <hi rend="italic">take</hi>, my appointed London cash, next Wednesday, their payment, and that of my other Annandale debtors, will not be delayed.</p>
<p>I inclose you a Letter from Jack which came only on Tuesday,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dated <date when="1830-01-25">25 Jan.</date></note> and confirms our melancholy surmises that the Doctor is still doing nothing, but only <hi rend="italic">to</hi> do. My comfort is that he <hi rend="italic">must</hi> set to work, ere long, there being <hi rend="italic">no</hi> other resource for him; and that if he were at work, all would be well with him. We must &#x2018;give him time, give him time, good people,#x2019; as Grahame<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly William Graham.</note> says; for the choice of a Life residence is no slight matter, and does take some deliberation. When he writes again, which may be some weeks hence, so that you need not weary, I will send you notice by the earliest opportunity.</p>
<p>You will have heard of the sad mortality among our Friends, of late: three graves in Kirkmichael Churchyard<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Kirkmichael Church was the parish church of Kirkmichael in Annandale.</note> within three weeks. Alick and I attended Mary Stewart<supplied>[#x2019;]</supplied>s<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Wife of John Aitken, a brother of Carlyle#x2019;s mother. She died on <date when="1830-01-22">22 Jan.</date> and was buried on <date when="1830-01-26">26 Jan.</date> See <ref target="volume-05/lt-18300211-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1830-02-11">11 Feb.</date></ref></note> last pilgrimage, on Tuesday, thro#x2019; the storm and snow: it was a wild and sad-looking scene. She died, we were told, in great bodily agony, to which however it was hoped she was not sensible. From Wednesday till Friday when all <pb id="pg-05-67" n="05:67"/>ended, she spoke little or nothing, except now and then, &#x201C;O John!&#x201D;&#x2014;and fell out of one convulsion fit into another still more violent, at the end of every three hours. Poor Mary! after eight bleak years of misery and complaint, she too is in her long rest.&#x2014; Jamie Aitken,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >About <date when="1830-01-13">13 Jan.</date> Carlyle wrote in his journal: &#x201C;My worthy Uncle &#x2018;Sandy#x2019; is dead, and to be buried to-morrow. &#x2026; Uncle Sandy#x2019;s widow survived him but a week; their eldest son lay sick of fever, and at the time insensible&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Two Note Books</hi>, p. 147). &#x201C;Sandy&#x201D; Aitken died on <date when="1830-01-10">10 Jan.</date> and was buried on <date when="1830-01-14">14 Jan.</date>; his wife died on about <date when="1830-01-17">17 Jan.</date> and was buried on <date when="1830-01-21">21 Jan.</date> The &#x201C;eldest son&#x201D; was James Aitken, who survived and later became the husband of Carlyle#x2019;s sister Jean.</note> we heard, was continuing slowly to recover: they had only told him of his Mother#x2019;s death, on Friday, after he had twice got out of bed, tho#x2019; unable to walk, to go and see where she was! What arrangement they contemplate, the poor forsaken creatures, we have not heard; only that they mean to keep the house for the present, and live together. When I go to Dumfries next, I shall make a point of inquiring. These are fearful things; and it ought to be a thanksgiving to us that we are still spared in the Place of Hope; and a warning that one day our hour too will come. O Life, thou hollow shadow what art thou!</p>
<p>None of you will write to us; but for once we shall have tidings, and we hope good ones, thro#x2019; Elliott. How do you stand this fearful weather, my dear Mother? Let me intreat of you to take care of yourself. Let Mag also, and my Father keep near the fire: the rest are stout enough, and able for the cold. Jane is now nearly well; but has only been once over the threshold for many weeks. One day she was for a ride but we missed it; and the next day, Frost was there in new vigour; and for aught we see may make some stay with us.</p>
<p>Mary is bustling about in her usual way. Alick works in the smithy, leads peats and composts by day, and by night shoots hares, or rather shoots <hi rend="italic">at</hi> hares, for as yet he has only got one, tho#x2019; seven are sometimes to be seen before the door at once.</p>
<p>I myself am now well and busy having set to work to write, three days ago, and done a kind of task daily ever since. Half of my task is still to do, tonight, if I had my tea: however I must and will be thro#x2019; it. There is no other thing that keeps me in any measure comfortable. All this time I have been waiting for Books, few of which are come yet: however, I shall be <hi rend="italic">very</hi> loth to pause again till I am done&#x2014;some eight or nine months hence!&#x2014; Not that I mean to stay away from Scotsbrig so long; nay perhaps I may come cantering down some day very soon,&#x2014;perhaps before the Frost is over.</p>
<p>Jane bids me say that the black jelly is for my Father, and that <pb id="pg-05-68" n="05:68"/>something better was set out for him; but it spoiled since Austin<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Austin, probably the son of Peter Austin, a local farmer; he married Carlyle#x2019;s sister Mary in <date when="1830-11-00">Nov. 1830</date>.</note> went off, in poor Mary#x2019;s damp press <supplied>[cupboard]</supplied>. I am to add that the swine-cheek hangs gracefully on our kitchen ceiling, which is now almost covered with hog#x2019;s flesh, <hi rend="italic">Fixy#x2019;s</hi> two hams and flitches having gone up thither yesterday.</p>
<p>These two Reviews have Papers of mine, and one by Jack, at the places I have marked.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle#x2019;s review of <hi rend="italic">Wahrheit aus Jean Paul#x2019;s Leben</hi>, and John Carlyle#x2019;s review article &#x201C;Animal Magnetism&#x201D; (a review of six books), both in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Review</hi>, V (<date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>), 1&#x2013;52 and 96&#x2013;124; and the first part of Carlyle#x2019;s translation of &#x201C;Jean Paul Friedrich Richter#x2019;s Review of Madame de Sta&#xEB;l#x2019;s &#x2018;<foreign>Allemagne</foreign>,#x2019;&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Fraser#x2019;s Magazine</hi>, I (<date when="1830-02-00">Feb.</date> and <date when="1830-05-00">May 1830</date>), 28&#x2013;37 and 407&#x2013;13.</note> You will read them, and send them back the first opportunity: in due time I hope to send you this <hi rend="italic">Book</hi> of mine for your approval.&#x2014; But here is Tea, and my time is done. Give my kindest love to Mag, to Jamie, Jane, Jenny; and send me special word how my Father is. Cannot one of them <hi rend="italic">write</hi> a line? Jane promised that she would.</p>
<p>We had once some talk about your coming up with Elliott. How you stand cold weather I do not know; all I can say is, if we had yo<supplied>[u]</supplied> here, we would keep you as warm as the brightest fire and the gladdest wel<supplied>[come]</supplied> could make you: so come if you dare!

<salute>Dearest Eliza</salute>
<p>This has been the unluckiest new-year to me! Every day some Job#x2019;s-post or other tempts me to curse my stars! It began with the death of my pig&#x2014;my sweet, wise, little pig, who was the apple of my eye&#x2014;he got a surfeit one evening, and next morning I was pigless! and just when my long cherished hopes of him were approaching <pb id="pg-05-69" n="05:69"/>their fulfilment, and a few weeks more would have plumped him out into such delicate bacon! So the glory of this world passeth away!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Proverbial: <foreign><hi rend="italic">sic transit gloria mundi.</hi></foreign> Jane refers to her pet pig Fixlein, or Fixie, named after the hero of Jean Paul Richter#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Leben Quintus Fixlein</hi>, which Carlyle had translated for <hi rend="italic">German Romance</hi>.</note> On the back of this severe family-affliction followed a disaster occasioned by a quite opposite cause, being the consequence not of overfeeding but pure starvation: a stranger cat under the pangs of famine rushed wildly into our larder one day, making straight in the direction of a beefsteak&#x2014;and, before you could bless yourself, snack [quickly] went the steak, and smash went a <hi rend="italic">corner dish;</hi> which you know was as bad as if the whole four corner dishes had been broken or at least a pair of them. And alas! this was only a beginning&#x2014;this smash, it seemed, was but a signal for the breakage of all the crockery glass and china about the house&#x2014; For now Nancy<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Thornhill Nancy,&#x201D; the maid.</note> became as it were suddenly possessed with a demon of destruction which shivered everything she laid hands on&#x2014;nay&#x2014;the supper-tray with all its complement of bowls, plates &#x26;c &#x26;c she &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">soopit ower wi her tails</hi>&#x201D; [swept over with the tail of her dress]! one fell <hi rend="italic">soop!</hi>&#x2014; But already I must have filled your eyes with tears&#x2014;and will not tax your sympathy with a detail of <hi rend="italic">all</hi> my grievances&#x2014;indeed one sheet would not hold them. Only attend to the last, which you must help me to remedy, being in truth the main cause of my writing again so soon&#x2014;&#x2014; Last week we were despatching a boxfull of books to Sam<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Samuel Aitken of Bell and Bradfute#x2019;s, Edinburgh.</note> to be transmitted to their various owners in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>&#x2014; None of our own people being &#x201C;at <hi rend="italic">the</hi> town&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dumfries.</note> that Wednesday it was entrusted to the Carrier, who naturally was charged <hi rend="italic">to pay it</hi>&#x2014;but our ill luck pursuing us even in this small matter, the carrier either misunderstood or proved oblivious; and so the package was despatched with all its charges to be defrayed at Bank-street!&#x2014; Now, tho#x2019; intrinsically considered the damage done by this mistake be trifling, yet you will understand how one should find it abundantly vexatious&#x2014;and I beseech you to explain to M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Aitken how the omission which must have appeared to him so singularly inconsiderate occur<supplied>[r]</supplied>ed&#x2014; and to charge him (by his Lady#x2019;s love or whatever he values most) to place this with every expence which these book commissions cost him, to Carlyle#x2019;s account. If he does not we shall not be able to apply to him with any freedom, and I doubt if in all Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> we could find another as helpful.</p>
<p>And now contrary to my usual practice &#x201C;I must plant a remark&#x201D; <pb id="pg-05-70" n="05:70"/>or two on the weather&#x2014; It is well we have meat and fire &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">within ourselves</hi>#x2019; (as M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Roughhead<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably Mrs. David Roughhead, wife of the man from whom Dr. Welsh had bought the house at Haddington.</note> used to say) otherwise we should live in hourly apprehe<supplied>[n]</supplied>sion of being snowed up, and consequently starved to death without even the mournful alternative of &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">eating our own children</hi>.&#x201D; Oh for a sight of the green fields again or even the black peat-moss&#x2014;anything rather than this wide waste of blinding snow! The only time when I can endure to look out (<hi rend="italic">going</hi> out is not <supplied>[to]</supplied> be dreamt of) is by moonlight, when the enclosure before the house is literally filled with hares&#x2014;and then the scene is really very picturesque&#x2014;the little dark forms skipping and bounding over the white ground so witch-like! A still more novel spectacle exhibited itself the other day at broad noon&#x2014;seven black-cocks &#x201C;as <hi rend="italic">fine</hi>&#x201D; (or perhaps finer) &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">as ever stepped the streets of Greenock</hi>&#x201D;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The black-cock is the male of the European black grouse.

<salute>My Dear Jack,</salute>
<p>Your Letter, tho#x2019; &#x201C;too late&#x201D; was stamped on it, reached us last night duly: the previous one we had also received, tho#x2019; not till the <pb id="pg-05-71" n="05:71"/>Tuesday week. I suppose the Moniaive Carrier had neglected it on the preceding Saturday; but I have quickened his diligence since then.</p>
<p>My errand to Dumfries, that Tuesday, was a very melancholy one:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-05/lt-18300129-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, [<date when="1830-01-29">29 Jan.</date>]</ref>.</note> Alick and I had set out at six o#x2019;clock thro#x2019; the East wind and the new snow, to attend the funeral of our Aunt, Mary Stewart, whose painful career had at length, in violent suffering as we were told, reached its close. There has been doleful work among our relatives here of late: poor Uncle Sandy, very suddenly cut off, was buried on one Thursday; his Wife, who in the stupor of fever scarcely knew of his decease, followed him thither that day week; and on the Tuesday following poor Mary Stewart there likewise found her long home.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-05/lt-18300129-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, [<date when="1830-01-29">29 Jan.</date>]</ref>.</note> The death of Sandy and his Wife was not the only calamity to that forlorn abode: Jamie Aitken was also lying ill of fever, and only about ten days ago was informed that his mother had departed; not till after he had twice attempted to get out of bed, and see with his own eyes how she was. We hear that he continues slowly to recover: there are three sisters and a brother left with him; the youngest girl only about eleven! God is great, as the Arabs say; but He is also good.&#x2014; Jenny too, that is Mrs Currie, has been in distress, but is now recovered.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jenny Currie, or Corrie (d. <date when="1830-05-00">May 1830</date>), a sister of Carlyle#x2019;s mother, Margaret A. Carlyle, who was also the sister of John, Robert, and Alexander Aitken, Jeannie A. Grierson (d. <date when="1810-00-00">1810</date>), Mary A. Shaw (d. <date when="1819-00-00">1819</date>), Isabella A. McKinnon, and Anne Aitken (married name unknown if she ever married).</note> From Templand we hear, at the same time, but indifferent tidings. The old man had fallen down,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Walter Welsh, Jane Carlyle#x2019;s maternal grandfather.</note> while Mrs Welsh was here, and had hurt his back; which injury still clings to him, so that Mrs W. who is herself sick has a heavy task: the other night, it appears, he had some apoplectic or paralytic shock, and for half an hour seemed altogether gone. This, I think, has been the sickliest winter, and every way the hardest that I can remember.</p>
<p>However, let us be thankful that we ourselves, and all more immediately concerned with us, are still spared in health, and only suffering by what we see others suffer. Elliot was at Scotsbrig three days ago, seeking meal; and brings word that they are all astir; my Father only, as Jean#x2019;s Letter says, suffering somewhat from shortness of breath, but otherwise not complaining. Our Mother was overjoyed at your Letter, which she had hungered and thirsted for; having got nothing from you but Newspapers without even an &#x201C;All well,&#x201D; nay the last had something <hi rend="italic">rubbed</hi> out on it, which frightened her exceedingly. <pb id="pg-05-72" n="05:72"/>Here too we are in the usual state: Jane recovered, and now knitting patiently beside me at a bright fire: the others held in indeed by frost and sleet, yet making what head they may against the &#x201C;Force of Circumstances.&#x201D; Again and again I say: Let us all be thankful!</p>
<p>Your last Letter, dear Brother, tho#x2019; but of a sable texture, gave me more real satisfaction than any you had written. It exhibits you in a figure of decided Action, which after so many weeks, of storm-bound Inactivity, we all heartily longed and prayed to see you in. Spite of all difficulties, and there are too many and too heavy, I now doubt not, a moment, that you will find yourself a settlement, and ultimately prosper there. But you are now at the pinch of the game, Jack; and must <hi rend="italic">not</hi> falter: now or never! O my dear Brother, do not loiter, do not linger, trusting to the chapter of chances, and help from other men! Know and feel that <hi rend="italic">you</hi> are still there yourself; <hi rend="italic">one</hi> heart and head that will never desert your interests. I know the many difficulties, and hesitations; how wretched you are, while others only fancy you sluggish. But thank Heaven, you are now afoot, fairly diligent and intent: what way it is in you to make, you will make; and already I can well believe you are far happier; for Evil, as Jean Paul truly says, is like a Nightmare, the instant you begin to <hi rend="italic">stir</hi> yourself, it is already gone.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >From Jean Paul#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Andachtsbuch</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Book of Devotion</hi>) and translated by Carlyle in <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XXVII, 118. Cf. Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi>, p. 126, and &#x201C;Chartism,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XXIX, 192.</note></p>
<p>Meanwhile do not fret yourself over much: a period of probation, and adventure is appointed for most men, is good for all men. For your friends, especially, and testifying by deed your affection to them, give yourself <hi rend="italic">no</hi> sorrow: there is not a Friend you have, Jack, who doubts for an instant of your affection: neither is their wish with regard to you to see you rich and famous but to see you self-collected, diligent, and wise, steering your way manfully thro this Existence, resolutely and with clear heart, as beseems a man, as beseems <hi rend="italic">such</hi> a man; whether you ride in carriages, and drink Tokay, and have crowds to halloo after you, or only walk in Scotch clogs, like the rest of us, is a matter, so you do walk, of far smaller moment. &#x201C;Stout heart to a <foreign>stay brae</foreign> [steep hill],&#x201D; then, my brave Boy! There is nothing <hi rend="italic">in</hi> this world to frighten a clear heart: they can refuse you guinea fees, but the godlike privilege of alleviating wretchedness, of feeling that you <hi rend="italic">are</hi> a true man, let the whole host of gigmen say to it what they will, no power of this Earth, or of what is under it, <hi rend="italic">can</hi> take from you. On, then, my Brother! Up and be doing; be my real, stout Brother as of <pb id="pg-05-73" n="05:73"/>old; and I will take you to my heart, and name you proudly, tho#x2019; in the world#x2019;s eye you were the lowest of the low. What charm is in a name? Physician, Surgeon, Apothecary; all but Quack is honourable.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The whole paragraph owes much to Goethe#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meisters Lehrjahre</hi>.</note></p>
<p>To come to practice, for my mind is perhaps too full of these things: I must admit that the aspect of Warwick is hopeless enough; so hopeless that it seems strange how Badams should ever have invited you to come and look at it. Doubtless he meant and could mean only to do you kindness: but I have long known him for a painter <foreign><hi rend="italic">en beau</hi></foreign> [in glowing colors], as here again he has proved himself. The only redeeming fact is that the Warwickers actually <hi rend="italic">call</hi> &#x2018;Physicians from Birmingham,#x2019; which of course were there a good Physician among themselves they would cease to do. However, it must be owned, the thing seems hopeless. As for Banbury, which is a place I know nothing of, and Liecester [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] and Derby, there seems to me to be little trust to be put in any of them. The truth is, I believe, there is <hi rend="italic">no</hi> considerable place in England that has not already its complement of Doctors: a man must <hi rend="italic">make</hi> his way among them for he will hardly <hi rend="italic">find</hi> it.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In his letter of <date when="1830-02-10">10 Feb.</date> John tells how his investigation of Warwick, Leamington, and other nearby places which Badams had thought might need a doctor had only led him to the conclusion that all these places already had too many doctors.</note> Dumfries was overstocked; so are they all, and have all their drawbacks of other sorts besides. On the whole, it was a wise advice of Johnston that you should choose the place you <hi rend="italic">like</hi>, and there settle: a new settlement is very difficult anywhere.</p>
<p>Far be it from me to take the character of adviser in a matter which you understand so much better yourself. Nevertheless, from all that appears, I think were I in your place I should incline to prefer a settlement in Birmingham itself, rather than in any of their Banburys, or other obscure places, which besides the disadvantages of being preoccupied, of being sensual, pudding-eating towns, as all English towns are like to be, are <hi rend="italic">little</hi>, are <foreign><hi rend="italic">Kleinst&#xE4;dte</hi></foreign> [small-towns], and fuller of <foreign>Kleinstadtereien</foreign> [small-town affairs]. Do not despair of your Authorcraft: exert yourself, and it will do. Construct any good solid &#x2018;Article,#x2019; and Macvey Napier will be glad of it, if you grow tired of the Blacks. All your English friends are in Birmingham, and it is a <hi rend="italic">boundless</hi> field for you. There are plenty of <hi rend="italic">poor</hi> to practise on: if you gain but twenty shillings the first half year, do not despair. As for the poor ten pounds you got from me, you are heartily welcome to it thrice over: my only grief is that in the present posture of affairs I <pb id="pg-05-74" n="05:74"/>can furnish nothing more: the Blacks have not so much as paid me yet! However, times will not always be so bad; and while I have help to give, depend on it as your own. I really think I should be tempted to try Birmingham: however, do not regard me as <hi rend="italic">counselling</hi>.</p>
<p>For the rest, you have done nothing to prevent your returning to Scotland: nor has Dumfries ceased in my opinion to be a place where profit and honour might await any man of <hi rend="italic">real medical qualifications</hi>, of which sort, excepting the blackguard Thom,<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. William Thom, Port Street, Annan, who was known over the entire region.</note> there is absolutely <hi rend="italic">none</hi> in these parts far or near. The poor old Gawk, Maxwell,<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. William Maxwell, 54 High St., Dumfries.</note> took a large fee lately from Jamie Austin (whose arm, having been slept on, obstinately <hi rend="italic">fell asleep</hi> for two weeks, with total insensibility, swelling &#x26;c) simply for telling him the first time that it would mortify and he die, and the second time, when he could actually feel with it, that it was no better! Yet the man has four guineas every time he mounts his carriage: he gives dinners, and tho#x2019; a known Littleworth, rank<supplied>[s]</supplied> [esteems himself] with the best of the County. It is clear to me, as day, that a <hi rend="italic">man</hi> might root him out. However, if your tastes lead you to England, more especially <hi rend="italic">now</hi>, it will perhaps be better to try it. Courage, then! &#x201C;Courage, Brother!&#x201D;&#x2014; Write to me soon, and in the <hi rend="italic">last</hi> small type; for we shall be doubly anxious to learn how you fare. <hi rend="italic">No</hi> topic, be sure, can interest us so much as your own history. You can write &#x2018;Articles#x2019; man; &#x2018;the Devil#x2019;s in it if you can#x2019;t review.#x2019;&#x2014;Wait not on Badams: his are Favonian gales,<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Favonius was the god of the mild and gentle west wind.</note> and no true trade-wind. Look with your own eyes, and think with your own head. Lastly love us all, as we all truly love you. Write soon. <closer><salute>Your affectionate Brother,</salute></closer> <name>T.C.</name></p>

<dateline><place>Craigenputtoch</place>, Tuesday Night [<date when="1830-02-16">16 February 1830</date>]&#x2014;</dateline>
<salute>My Dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I here send you a fresh Letter from the Doctor,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Postmarked <date when="1830-02-07">7 Feb.</date>, mistakenly dated <date when="1830-02-10">10 Feb.</date> by John.</note> which tho#x2019; rather of a baffled aspect I reckon more satisfactory than the most we have got from him of late. Tho#x2019; hard bested, disappointed as to Warwick, and in straits about what he is to do, our Doctor seems actually to be <hi rend="italic">awake</hi> at last, to be bestirring himself, and disposed to make a shift, which shift, were it once fairly set about, I have no doubt will prove in some degree successful. I answered Jack almost by return of Post in an encouraging key, told him that a struggle was unavoidable at starting anywhere; that he had done nothing to exclude him from Dumfries, where I was convinced he might still be successful; but withal advising him to try Birmingham rather than any other English town. We have since had a newspaper, signifying that he was &#x201C;quite <pb id="pg-05-76" n="05:76"/>well,&#x201D; and had received the Letter: it is probable that we may hear more of his motions ere long, and of course you will get notice by the first opportunity. I rather conjecture, he will try Birmingham.</p>
<p>As for us up here, we are all astir, in spite of the frosts and snows; and trying to keep Necessity at the Staff#x2019;s end. I get on with my Book, tho#x2019; slowly, and am making all exertions to have the first Volume published in <date when="1830-05-00">May</date>. Surely I will get down to see you, if the weather were better: neither shall I be so tossed to and fro, and disappointed in my work, another year as I have been this. But let us not complain. We have <hi rend="italic">many</hi> mercies; and it is and remains an everlasting Truth, that our &#x201C;Father knoweth how to give us good gifts.&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Matt. 7:11.</note> O it is only the dark wicked heart within us that needs improvement: this Universe and our Existence in it were &#x201C;very good&#x201D; could we only be so. He only is to be pitied that does not know this; or knowing it, cannot work daily and hourly in the heart-belief of it.</p>
<p>We had hoped to see you here, had the Frost not intervened: but Elliot came alone, and no Mother was with him. Tell us again when you can come, and I will send him down for you, at any time; he is not so busy. Thank Jane for her Letters, which were highly welcome to us all: if she would, from time to time, continue to do the like, it would be a great comfort to us here.</p>
<p>I am to express our obligations for quite another sort of article, the Beef, namely; which we have roasted, and stewed, and otherwise disposed of to proper purpose. It will be long, I doubt, before we have any <foreign><hi rend="italic">Mart</hi></foreign> [fattened cow or ox] here to pay you with in kind.</p>
<p>Mention to Jamie that the meal came safely, and is of very good quality; quite a dainty compared with the horrible stuff made here. I have given Alick money to pay him with tomorrow; and hope now to clear scores with <hi rend="italic">all</hi> my debtors, however little they leave me. It is a dreadful thing to be in debt: but I have <hi rend="italic">forced</hi> these London gentlemen to pay me Fifty Pounds; and had I out my &#x2018;first volume,#x2019; I shall be richer than the King! So let us keep up our heart, and struggle on at the work cut out for us: there is no other resource.</p>
<p>I once thought I should be obliged to go to Edinburgh for Books to help me thro#x2019; this enterprize: but trust it will not be necessary now. Let me rather hope, my first journey may be to Scotsbrig. I would come <hi rend="italic">instantly</hi>, had I any work lying behind to keep me in spirits. Jane and Mary talk of coming down: they are even speculating (I suppose, in jest) about riding to Poldean, in quest of that woman <pb id="pg-05-77" n="05:77"/>Smeal;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably Jean Smail. See <ref target="volume-04/lt-18280800-JWC-JCA-01"><sic>4:394&#x2013;95</sic><corr>JWC to JCA, <date when="1828-08-23">23 Aug. 1828</date></corr></ref>.</note> for we are to need a new Maid at Whitsunday, and know not yet where to find one. They rather doubt Smeal would be too <hi rend="italic">reckless</hi>, and <foreign><hi rend="italic">brainging</hi></foreign> [slapdash].</p>
<p>I must break off here, and again beg you to take this poor rag of a Letter in lieu of a better one. Jamie will give us word tomorrow how you all are; especially how you and my Father are: the rest, except Mag, are stout subjects, and we can better fancy them well. I am in great haste, having other Letters to write tonight. Give my true love to all: make Jane or Mag write. Why do they not write? I am sure they daily think of us, as we do of you. Good night, my Dear Mother! I could write volumes, and yet say but a fraction of what I <hi rend="italic">meant</hi>.</p>
<closer><salute>I am ever your affectionate Son, /</salute></closer>

<ps><p>Jamie Aitken, we hear, continues to recover: his youngest Sister has also had the fever! She too is recovering. They are going to keep their house; at least for the present.&#x2014; John Aitken, it seems, has written for Margaret M#x2019;Kinnow (Hawick) to come and stay with him: but there was no answer last week.&#x2014; Good night! Good Night! And <hi rend="italic">all</hi> Good!&#x2014;&#x2014;</p></ps>

<salute>My dear Jack,</salute>
<p>I have just despatched you a Newspaper to Moniaive, whither Rob has gone for paint-oil; and shall endeavour to have this forwarded in a day; so that your longing to hear of us may be gratified. Jane and I were at Scotsbrig for about a week, and returned only on Tuesday night, thro#x2019; tempests of sleet, and in spite of ill-shod fillies; to find your Letters among various others, and a square parcel which happily proved to be <hi rend="italic">J&#xF6;rdens</hi>,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Karl Heinrich J&#xF6;rdens (<date when="1757-00-00">1757</date>&#x2013;<date when="1835-00-00">1835</date>), <hi rend="italic">Lexikon deutscher Dichter und Prosaisten</hi>, 6 vols. (Leipzig,<date when="1806-00-00">1806</date>&#x2013;<date when="1811-00-00">11</date>).</note> lying waiting to welcome us. The good people at Scotsbrig seemed all wonderfully well and happy, and on the whole exhibited a much more comfortable style of housekeeping than I <pb id="pg-05-78" n="05:78"/>expected there. On the whole I think their way of life one of the most desirable which a man could choose for himself in this condition of things. Our Father who has been sickly and dispirited most of the winter has now recovered himself; walks out to see his dikers, and so forth, and is very bright and speculative. Our Mother we expect here shortly, when Alick goes down for seed-corn, which perhaps he will do tomorrow. She too seemed moderately well, but full of anxieties about you. Speak to her on that subject when one liked, she had always &#x201C;just been thinking of it.&#x201D; She wishes much that you would write to her oftener, as I assured her you would not fail to do, were you once settled. She sees all the Letters that come hither, and in general with little delay; but that is far from sufficing her. An old Newspaper from time to time with a &#x2018;<foreign><hi rend="italic">ganz wohl</hi></foreign> [all#x2019;s well],#x2019; would be quite a treat at Scotsbrig. The girls said they had constructed you a Letter, brimfull of news, and thought it should count against three from you. William Graham I likewise saw, and Simpson who was there to dine with him, and <hi rend="italic">cheeped</hi> innocent trivialities till nightfall, when he and I rode over the Clinthill together, the bog-road being unfathomable. Both asked kindly after you; Graham with particular eagerness, expressing great desire and hope, unmixed with complaint, to get a Letter from you soon. I told them you seemed about settling in Birmingham as a Physician (such were the tidings Andrew Anderson<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-05/lt-18291122-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1829-11-22">22 Nov. 1829</date></ref>.</note> sent) and were at that time in London. Grahame I was sorry to observe in rather dull spirits; less talkative than his wont: I think we did not raise one right horselaugh all the time, nor next day either when he came down and dined with us guests at Scotsbrig. He has been at Burnswark all winter; and black care, I fear, sits too heavy on that honest heart. Elsewhere in Annandale I was not; nor did I gather any news, except that poor George Bell<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not to be confused with the Edinburgh physician of the same name.</note> (once called the Ranter, now grave enough) had died the week before,&#x2014;as was understood, from hard drinking. Poor Ranter! we could have better spared a worthier man.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Prince Hal on Falstaff: &#x201C;I could have better spared a better man&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">I Henry IV</hi>, V, iv).</note> The Clows, at Jane#x2019;s request, came and drank tea with us; Miss Clow<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Janet Clow, who was to marry Alexander Carlyle later in the year.</note> much admired for her &#x2018;fine figure#x2019;; and next day, having been already detained by foul weather, we rode forth in spite of all representations; passed thro#x2019; Ecclefechan, and over Dalton Bank, in successive whirlwinds of snow; and at night found ourselves sitting not <pb id="pg-05-79" n="05:79"/>among the broad faces at Scotsbrig, but here in the wilderness alone by our own hearth. Nothing new had occurred in our absence: all were well and busy, Alick with his ploughing, Elliot<supplied>[t]</supplied> with his road-clearing, and hedge-cropping; Mary and her womankind with their washing and wringing within doors. We had been at Templand, as we went down to Scotsbrig, when the weather was very gay: Mrs Welsh was pretty well; and her Father too, tho#x2019; with strength of body he had recovered strength of volition, and was a very emphatic and unrestful old man. Mrs Welsh is much to be pitied with him; but she bears it all in a light patient spirit, such as might reprove many a professed philosopher. She read us part of a letter from her Brother,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Welsh of Liverpool.</note> wherein he mentions you and your visit in terms of great cordiality; also another extract inquiring whether my cigars were done.&#x2014; I think, I have now been minute enough, Doctor; and so shall smoke a pipe, and take up another side of the business.</p>
<p>You are now at &#x2018;the goal and purpose,#x2019; towards which all your wishes from the very first have been pointing; a grander field you cannot find for your activity, at least not in this Planet. I understand too little of your position in London to offer any judgement on it that were worth much. Doubtless there must be some appearance of a chance for succeeding, or your two kind friends would not have so counselled you, and so substantially backed their counsel. Try it with your whole might, if you are so minded, and all the blessings that wait on honest Industry go with you! The only portion of your project at which I demur is that of your borrowing to execute it. This I do not out of any savage spirit of &#x2018;indapindence,#x2019; which I have long seen to be naught; but from a deep conviction that the grand thing you want is, not practicing in London, or becoming rich, or renowned, but simply feeling that you stand on your own legs; which happy consummation is thereby indefinitely postponed. Depend upon it, Jack, you were happier that way, on a crust of bread, in the Moors of Dunscore, than rolling in Matthew Baillie#x2019;s chariot<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Matthew Baillie (<date when="1761-00-00">1761</date>&#x2013;<date when="1823-00-00">1823</date>) was a fashionable and highly prosperous London physician.</note> thro#x2019; the streets of London, without it. At the same time, do not understand me as decidedly <hi rend="italic">advising</hi> you to refuse all help from friends: I only state my own feeling, which who knows whether I might not modify a little were I on the spot. Dangerous you yourself will see it to borrow money, and incur such obligations to any stranger: and doubtless if you can, you will forbear to do it. For my own share, I had infinitely rather <pb id="pg-05-80" n="05:80"/>hear of your translating or abridging that unhappy Sprengel, <note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Kurt Polykarp Joachim Sprengel (<date when="1766-00-00">1766</date>&#x2013;<date when="1833-00-00">1833</date>), physician and botanist, who wrote histories of medicine and other works.</note> or writing for Fraser#x2019;s Magazine,<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle himself had received a very cordial letter from James Fraser, dated <date when="1830-03-04">4 March</date>, inviting him to contribute to the new <hi rend="italic">Fraser#x2019;s Magazine for Town and Country</hi>, the first issue of which appeared in <date when="1830-02-00">Feb.</date> Fraser mentions that both Edward Irving and William Fraser had suggested Carlyle as a contributor.</note> or doing any other honest thing with your own strength. The more anxious am I to learn how you prosper in these latter enterprizes. Meanwhile, and whether you apply to it or not, let us admire the generosity of Badams and Montague, whose offer to you an unknown stranger deserves perpetual gratitude.<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In his letter of <date when="1830-03-08">8 March</date> John had written: &#x201C;Montagu &#x26; Badams both advise me to settle in London, to choose one professional subject in general request to which I <supplied>[would]</supplied> determine to devote my chief attention, and to acquire more information on it than any other person at present possesses. Montagu tells me I should be quite sure of success, and bids me calculate what I can live upon and undertakes in Badam#x2019;s and his own name to furnish me with money to live upon during the years of probation.&#x201D;</note> Such faith I have scarcely found in Israel. And yet there are noble hearts scattered here and there in all lands that the Sun lights. Do but think of Jeffrey:
a Letter<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dated <date when="1830-03-09">9 March</date>. Carlyle had been in correspondence with Jeffrey throughout the winter. Jeffrey had written warmly on <date when="1830-02-13">13 Feb.</date> urging the Carlyles to return to Edinburgh and, receiving no reply, wrote again on <date when="1830-03-01">1 March</date> advising Carlyle not to despise his &#x201C;fellow creatures&#x2014;and especially your fellow scribblers &#x2014;who are among the least of them&#x2014;and at all events as much above your hedgers and ditchers, as <hi rend="italic">they</hi> are above their <hi rend="italic">collies</hi>.&#x201D; Carlyle evidently replied, for in his letter of <date when="1830-03-09">9 March</date> Jeffrey states that &#x201C;You wrote me lately that one of your objects in life was&#x2014;for the present, to earn, by work, not always suitable or grateful to you&#x2014;something about &#xa3;100 a year.&#x201D; He goes on to offer Carlyle &#xa3;100 a year out of his own income assuring him that this was &#x201C;a Sum, which would not be felt.&#x201D; To this Carlyle replied promptly, apparently saying as far as he recalled (in the <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi>) that: &#x201C;Republican Equality the silently fixed law of human society at present; each man to live on his own resources, and have an <hi rend="italic">Equality</hi> of economies with every other man; dangerous, and not possible except through cowardice or folly, to depart from said clear rule,&#x2014;till perhaps a better era rise on us again!&#x201D; (II, 254).
<p>Carlyle#x2019;s letters to Jeffrey have not survived and were probably destroyed by Jeffrey#x2019;s daughter Mrs. Empson when they were returned to her after Froude published the <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> in <date when="1881-00-00">1881</date>. But from Jeffrey#x2019;s letters, from Carlyle#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi>, and from his <hi rend="italic">Two Note Books</hi>, it is clear that the nature of this reply was important to him. In an entry in <hi rend="italic">Two Note Books</hi> written around this time he says: &#x201C;Francis Jeffrey the other week offered me a hundred a year; having learned that this sum met my yearly wants: he did it neatly enough, and I had no doubt of his sincerity&#x201D; (p. 155). He then goes on, presumably regretting the nature of his pride which compelled him to refuse the offer (although, as he says in the notebook, &#x201C;man is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> independent of his brother&#x201D;), &#x201C;What a state of society is this; in which a man would rather be shot thro#x2019; the heart, twenty-times, than do both himself and his neighbour a <hi rend="italic">real ease!</hi> How separate Pride from the natural necessary feeling of Self? It is ill to do; yet may be done&#x201D; (pp. 156, 155). Yet the tone of his later comments in the <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> is rather different; clearly the situation was one which deeply disturbed him, and brought out the conflict in his beliefs that men have a duty to help each other, yet may feel driven to refuse such help. See Wilson, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi>, II, 138&#x2013;41.</p></note> was lying here from him offering in the daintiest <pb id="pg-05-81" n="05:81"/>style to settle a hundred a year on unworthy me; nay but for an accident the first remittance would actually have been enclosed in it! I have just sent the meekest, friendliest, but most emphatic refusal, for this and all coming times. Do not mention this; for you see it has never gone beyond the length of a flourish of rhetoric, and is scarcely fit for mention: only whenever we think of our Dean of Faculty, let us conceive him as a <foreign><hi rend="italic">multum in parvo</hi></foreign> [much in little] that does credit to Scotland and humanity.</p>
<p>You interest me greatly by your <foreign><hi rend="italic">Umrisse</hi></foreign> [sketches] of so many Friends,<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lockhart, Edward Irving, Allan Cunningham, William Fraser, Basil Montagu, Edward Strachey, Mrs. Strachey, Mr. and Mrs. Charles Buller, Sr., Charles Buller the Younger.</note> in your last Letter. Pity only that they are not more filled up, which indeed future opportunities only could enable you to do. Pray be very minute, and above all intelligible. <hi rend="italic">How</hi> was it &#x2018;well that you did not venture to inquire#x2019; about Miss Kirkpatrick? Gentle shepherd, tell us How? Has my dear Kitty done anything that was wrong; or is her Major Walcot<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Kitty Kirkpatrick (<date when="1802-00-00">1802</date>&#x2013;<date when="1889-00-00">89</date>) did not marry a Major Walcot but instead married Captain James Winslowe Phillipps of the Seventh Hussars.</note> a scandalous fellow? Pray do inquire somewhere; and, if possible, have my kindest regards conveyed to her <foreign><hi rend="italic">quocunque</hi></foreign> [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] <foreign><hi rend="italic">nomine gaudeat</hi></foreign> [under whatever name she may like]. I grieve to hear that Mrs Strachey is unwell: assure her of my unabated esteem and affection. To the Montagues also and to Badams remember me as a Friend. Mr Fraser I need not mention, as from your present locality that were understood. I have written to Irving, explaining his share in that &#x2018;Signs of the Times,#x2019; and saying all manner of mystic things.<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle#x2019;s &#x201C;Signs of the Times,&#x201D; published in the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review</hi>, XLIX (<date when="1829-06-00">June 1829</date>), 439&#x2013;59, followed Irving#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">The signs of the times</hi> (London, <date when="1829-00-00">1829</date>). Perhaps Irving#x2019;s &#x201C;share&#x201D; lay in the suggestion of the title and in Carlyle#x2019;s contrast in the essay between &#x201C;Millites&#x201D; (followers of James Mill) and &#x201C;Millenarians&#x201D; (of whom Irving himself was one). Irving had taken his title from Matt. 16:3: &#x201C;O <hi rend="italic">ye</hi> hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky; but can ye not <hi rend="italic">discern</hi> the signs of the times?&#x201D;</note> I told him you were a rough colt but might make a noble <foreign><hi rend="italic">aiver</hi></foreign> [old horse], and he was to do for you what he could. I grieve daily that he belongs to that guild, and wish they <hi rend="italic">would</hi> expel him.</p>
<p>A Mr Gleig, well known in London, I believe, wrote to me the other day out of Kent about a &#x2018;Life of Goethe#x2019; for some new sort of Family <pb id="pg-05-82" n="05:82"/>Library.<note n="15" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Gleig#x2019;s letter to Carlyle, dated <date when="1830-03-01">1 March</date>, speaks of the &#x201C;great success of the Family Library &#x26; Lardners Cyclopedaea.&#x201D; George R. Gleig (<date when="1796-00-00">1796</date>&#x2013;<date when="1888-00-00">1888</date>) was a contributor to <hi rend="italic">Blackwood#x2019;s</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Fraser#x2019;s</hi>, author of <hi rend="italic">The Subaltern</hi> (<date when="1826-00-00">1826</date>), and various military histories. Two or three weeks later Carlyle mentioned the enquiry about the life of Goethe in his journal, adding that he was &#x201C;then still more anxious for one of <hi rend="italic">Luther;</hi>&#x2014;which I have refused. If I write <hi rend="italic">Luther</hi>, it must be more than a Biographic chronicle or less. Shall we go to Weimar then in winter, and prepare all the documents for that end?&#x2014;&#x2014;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Manos a la obra!</hi></foreign>&#x2014; Take the task which is <hi rend="italic">nearest</hi> thee!&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Two Note Books</hi>, pp. 154&#x2013;55).</note> I rather doubt nothing will come of the negociation [sic]; yet I wish much I had heard of it six months ago. For the rest, this has been the shabbiest winter with me that I can remember: wait-waiting for Books, beginning again and again with fierce energy, and again &#x26; again obliged to make a dead halt. These other London volumes (sent by a private hand) for which a much more important parcel in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> must be waiting, have never come to hand. For little, I would kick my foot thro#x2019; the whole concern even at this hour. But no! no! Neither is the good Fraser to blame; only my own evil stars. Pray will you try to ascertain from him <hi rend="italic">when</hi> he would like to have that History? I had fixed on <date when="1830-05-00">May</date>, but hear no answer, see no symptom of preparation. I have to write to Weimar today: <foreign>adieu!</foreign></p>
<p>Now, Dear Jack, do <hi rend="italic">not</hi> neglect to write very soon: judge what anxiety we are in; were you once fixed, you shall have longer allowances. Could you get the <hi rend="italic">Spectator</hi> into your own hand, for it never by any chance comes on Wednesday; and at the expiration of the first term, get it exchanged for some better one: I should still prefer the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>. <closer><salute>God bless you, my dear Brother!</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I have long owed myself the pleasure of writing to you, and might be a little puzzled to say why it had been so long. Perhaps my chief reason was that a certain negociation was in progress touching some Literary work to be undertaken by me, on which I wished to communicate with you; and so have waited, impatiently enough, till in the slow course of bibliopolic arrangements, I saw what turn matters were to take. The business, I believe, is now finally adjusted; indeed, in a state of actual advance; so that on this, as on all other topics, I can now address you without embarrassment.</p>
<p>It is pity that Weimar lay so distant from Scotland; with seas, and wide regions, to us all waste and unpeopled, intervening! No spot on this Globe is for me so significant at present; as indeed it is but for their association with human Worth and Effort that one city is nobler than another, that all cities are not mere stones and mortar. I can understand the long journeys which Lovers of Wisdom were wont to undertake, in old days, to see with their own eyes some Teacher of Wisdom: all sights in the Earth are poor and meaningless compared with this. We still speculate here on a journey to Weimar, and a winter#x2019;s residence there; but the way is long, the issue after all but a <hi rend="italic">luxury;</hi> then foolish little matters still detain us here, thus tho#x2019; the spirit is willing the flesh is weak.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Matt. 26:41.</note> One still looks for a luckier time; and many a pretty waking dream, tho#x2019; at last it prove but a phantasm, will for years be worth entertaining.</p>
<p>We long much to hear news of you: how your venerable Poet wears his green old age; how his and your labours are prospering. Scarcely any German Traveller finds his way hither; so that, except public notices, we are left mostly to hope and guess. Often I look into Stieler#x2019;s<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-05/lt-18290305-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1829-03-05">5 March 1829</date></ref>.</note> picture, and think the mild deep eyes ought to answer me. But they are only ink on paper, and do not. About the <date when="1829-12-01">first of last December</date>, we despatched a little Box for Weimar; containing pencil-sketches <pb id="pg-05-84" n="05:84"/>of our House and environment, Books and other trifles, among which I believe was something from my Wife for Madame: but unluckily, the frost set in directly after, the Elbe became innavigable; and the Edinburgh shippers gave little hope of the Packet leaving them till Spring. It was directed, as usual, to the care of Messrs Parish in Hamburg. Pray notify this to <foreign><hi rend="italic">Seiner Excellenz</hi></foreign>, unless happily it be already in his hands. Of our deep, unabated regard and love I trust he needs no assurance.</p>
<p>I requested the Editor of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Review</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Fraser.</note> to forward you some of my lucubrations, which you said you had not seen; nevertheless, I am afraid he has neglected it; neither, I can warn you, is the loss very great. I was shocked to learn that poor M&#xfc;llner was dead: the very post that brought me his version of my <hi rend="italic">Playwrights</hi> in his <hi rend="italic">Mitt</hi>nt <hi rend="italic">Blatt</hi>, conveyed also those other tidings, that the poor Jester was now &#x2018;quite chopfallen.#x2019; Alas, poor Yorick! And why did <hi rend="italic">I</hi> add another grain to his last load of suffering, already too heavy for him!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi>, V, i. In &#x201C;German Playwrights,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Foreign Review</hi> (<date when="1829-01-00">Jan. 1829</date>), Carlyle had dealt severely with M&#xfc;llner#x2019;s plays and <hi rend="italic">Midnight Paper</hi>. See <ref target="volume-04/lt-18281209-TC-JPE-01"><sic>4:427</sic><corr>TC to JPE, <date when="1828-12-09">9 Dec. 1828</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014; Since then I have not cast one other glance into your &#x2018;Tartarus#x2019;; but looked only at the Elysium, which is far more profitable.</p>
<p>Of our English Literature at this moment the two chief features seem to be our increased and increasing attention to the Literature of neighbouring nations; and the universal effort to render all sorts of knowledge <hi rend="italic">popular</hi>, to accommodate our speculations, both in price and structure, to the largest possible number of readers. In regard to that first peculiarity, you already know of our two Foreign <hi rend="italic">Reviews</hi>, both of which affect to be prospering; and now farther we have a <hi rend="italic">Foreign Literary Gazette</hi>,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Established by William Jerdan (<date when="1782-00-00">1782</date>&#x2013;<date when="1869-00-00">1869</date>), it ran for only thirteen numbers.</note> published weekly in London, and which tho#x2019; it is a mere steam-engine concern, managed by an utter <foreign><hi rend="italic">Dummkopf</hi></foreign> [blockhead], solely for lucre, appears to meet with sale. So great is the curiosity, so boundless is the ignorance of men: <foreign><hi rend="italic">dem Narrenk&#xF6;nig geh&#xF6;rt die Welt</hi></foreign> [the world belongs to the king of fools], at least all the temporalities thereof. Our zeal for <hi rend="italic">popularizing</hi>, again, is to be seen on every side of us. To say nothing of our <hi rend="italic">Societies for the Diffusion of useful Knowledge</hi>, with their sixpenny treatises,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge, founded in <date when="1825-00-00">1825</date> by Lord Brougham, issued treatises to popularize knowledge. Cf. Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi>, pp. 36&#x2013;37.</note> really very meritorious, we have I know not how many <hi rend="italic">Miscellanies, Family <pb id="pg-05-85" n="05:85"/>Libraries, Cabinet Cyclopedias</hi> and so forth; and these not managed by any literary Gibeonites [menials]<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >I.e., &#x201C;hewers of wood and drawers of water&#x201D; (Joshua 9:27).</note> but sometimes by the best men we have: Sir Walter Scott, for instance, is publishing a History of Scotland by one of these vehicles; Thomas Moore is to write a History of Ireland for the same work.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Scott#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">History of Scotland</hi>, 2 vols. (<date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>) was published by Dionysius Lardner (<date when="1793-00-00">1793</date>&#x2013;<date when="1859-00-00">1859</date>) in his <hi rend="italic">Cabinet Cyclopaedia;</hi> Moore#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">History of Ireland</hi>, 4 vols. (<date when="1835-00-00">1835</date>&#x2013;<date when="1846-00-00">46</date>) was also published in the <hi rend="italic">Cabinet Cyclopaedia</hi>.</note> The other day, I may add, there came a letter to me from a quite new Brotherhood of that sort; earnestly requesting a &#x2018;Life of Goethe.#x2019;&#x2014;Knowing my Correspondent as a man of some weight and respectability in Literature, I have just answered him that the making of Goethe known to England was a task which any Englishman might be proud of; but that as for his Biography, the only rational plan, as matters stood, was to take what he had himself seen fit to impart on the subject; and by proper commentary and adaptation, above all by a suitable version, and not perversion, of what was to be translated, enable an Englishman to read it with the eye of a German. If anything come of this proposal, and what, you shall by and by hear.<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >G. R. Gleig made this proposal to Carlyle on <date when="1830-03-01">1 March</date> and wrote again on <date when="1830-03-28">28 March</date> to say that he was &#x201C;much flattered by the frank &#x26; ready manner in which you meet my proposition, &#x26; exceedingly gratified at the idea of enrolling you among the contributors to the Library of General Knowledge. &#x2026; I will not press you on the subject of Goethe#x2019;s life at present. &#x2026; But in the mean while I shall be well pleased if you will proceed with your Life of Luther.&#x201D;</note></p>
<p>But it is more than time that I should say a word about my <hi rend="italic">History of German Literature</hi> (if such can be the name of it), the task above alluded to, and which also is to form part of a joint-stock enterprize, the first of a whole series of <hi rend="italic">&#x2018;Literary Histories#x2019;;</hi> French, Italian, Spanish, English Literature being all to be depicted in that &#x2018;Cabinet Library#x2019; of theirs. I am to have four volumes, and have thought a good deal about the plan I am to follow. The first volume is to be antiquarian, I think; to treat of the <hi rend="italic">Nibelungen Lied</hi>, the <foreign>Minnesingers</foreign>, Mastersingers, and so forth, and may perhaps end with Hans Sachs. The second will probably contain Luther and the Reformation Satyrists, with Opitz and his School; down as far as Thomasius, Gottsched and the Swiss.<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Martin Opitz (Opitz von Boberfeld) (<date when="1597-00-00">1597</date>&#x2013;<date when="1639-00-00">1639</date>), German poet and critic; Christian Thomasius (<date when="1655-00-00">1655</date>&#x2013;<date when="1728-00-00">1728</date>), German jurist and philosopher; Johann Christoph Gottsched (<date when="1700-00-00">1700</date>&#x2013;<date when="1766-00-00">66</date>), scholar and critic, last of the important German classical writers. For a humorous account of a meeting of Goethe with Gottsched, see Carlyle#x2019;s &#x201C;Goethe#x2019;s Works&#x201D; in <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XXVII, 417&#x2013;18.</note> The last two volumes must be devoted to your modern, indeed recent Literature, which is of all others the most important to <pb id="pg-05-86" n="05:86"/>us. I need not say how much any counsel of yours would oblige me in regard to this matter, many parts of which are still very dark to me. In particular, can you mention any reasonable Book, in which the &#x2018;New School#x2019; is exhibited; what was its history fairly stated, what its doctrines; what in the short was the <hi rend="italic">meaning</hi> lying at the bottom of that boundless hubbub, which so often perplexes the stranger even yet with its echoes in your Literature.<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >By &#x201C;New School&#x201D; Carlyle refers to the various German romantic groups, which included, among other writers, Wackenroder and Tieck, Brentano and Arnim, Novalis and the two Schlegels.

They were replies to the <hi rend="italic">Philister</hi>, or those whom the authors regarded as dunces, pietists, pedants and sentimentalists, who were duly outraged (hence the term <hi rend="italic">Xenienkrieg:</hi> Xenien war). Cf. Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi>, p. 140.</note> and is there any other Work that will throw light on that singular period?

<salute>My Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>One reason why I did not answer your most welcome Letter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dated <date when="1830-02-14">14 Feb.</date></note> was that, for the last two months, I have been in almost weekly meditation of a journey to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, in quest of Books. Another was that tho#x2019; very idle, I had, properly speaking, very little time; but was occupied, painfully enough sometimes, in the service of worthless taskmasters, Discontent, Biliousness, Indolence, and the Devil; or at best, in resisting these that they might fly from me.</p>
<p>I undertook, some five months ago, to write a <hi rend="italic">History of German Literature;</hi> for which I ordered, in good time, all manner of books and necessary documents, indeed; only few or none of these came to hand; there lay the grievance. A journey to Edinburgh might have helped me, but this I liked not; and so from Wednesday to Wednesday I have waited, and in disappointment devised new shifts; till of late I have got into a higher humour, and determined both <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to go to Edinburgh at present, and to write the first volume of my History before stirring from this house, tho#x2019; not another bookleaf should reach me here, and I were to write purely by guess, or by inspiration. I feel infinitely relieved in mind since then.</p>
<p>Now by way of helping me thro this magnanimous enterprize, will you perform for me the following piece of service. I want three Books, one of them very particularly, which I think may be found in your Library; at all events, by the aid of some friendly Advocate, may be <pb id="pg-05-88" n="05:88"/>procured from the neighbouring establishment. The first and most essential is <hi rend="italic">Barclay#x2019;s Ship of Fools</hi>, a Translation of the old German <hi rend="italic">Narrenschiff:</hi> this I should very specially wish to see. The oldest Edition, if there is a choice in that respect, will suit me best. Mr Napier is surely not destitute of such ancient classics; at worst, you will find me some <hi rend="italic">Barclay</hi> in the Advocates#x2019; Library, or perhaps in some private collection you have access to. I wish <hi rend="italic">greatly</hi> to see it.</p>
<p>The second is any old English (at any rate the oldest) Translation of <hi rend="italic">Reineke Fuchs</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">Reynard the Fox</hi>,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-05/lt-18300126-TC-DA-01">TC to DA, <date when="1830-01-26">26 Jan</date></ref>.</note> as it will be named in the version: I should hope, your Bibliographer will be able to furnish you with this also; at least, to tell you some distinct story about it, and where it may be met with. I read a little shabby <hi rend="italic">Reynard the Fox</hi>, printed on greyish paper, when I was a schoolboy, and have never seen another: but the Book was once a universal one, in our language as in others; and surely some very old Edition of it, much more authentic than that grey-paper one must be in existence.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >One of the books chosen to be printed by William Caxton (<date when="1421-00-00">1421</date>&#x2013;<date when="1491-00-00">91</date>), the first English printer, was <hi rend="italic">Historye of Reynart the Foxe</hi>, a beast epic translated from the Flemish.</note> This <hi rend="italic">Reynard</hi> I should also wish very much to get hold of; almost as much as Barclay, only that I know not with the same certainty whether it be attainable.</p>
<p>The third Book is one that I care less about, just at this time, yet by and by it will be essential, and even now it might be helpful: it is Horn#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Poesie und Beredtsamkeit der Deutschen</hi>, in three volumes, with the <hi rend="italic">Umrisse</hi> another volume (prior in date) which completes the Subject.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Franz Horn (<date when="1781-00-00">1781</date>&#x2013;<date when="1837-00-00">1837</date>), <hi rend="italic">Die Poesie und Beredsamkeit der Deutschen, von Luthers Zeit bis zur Gegenwart</hi>, 4 vols. (Berlin, <date when="1822-00-00">1822</date>&#x2013;29); <hi rend="italic">Umrisse zur Geschichte und Kritik der sch&#xF6;nen Literatur Deutschlands, w&#xE4;hrend der Jahre <date when="1790-00-00">1790</date> bis <date when="1818-00-00">1818</date></hi> (Berlin, <date when="1819-00-00">1819</date>). For Carlyle#x2019;s praise of Horn#x2019;s books, see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XXII, 128. See Werner Leopold, &#x201C;Carlyle and Franz Horn,&#x201D; in <hi rend="italic">Journal of English and Germanic Philology</hi>, XXVIII (<date when="1929-00-00">1929</date>), 215&#x2013;19, and his appendix to Harrold#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Carlyle and German Thought <date when="1819-00-00">1819</date>&#x2013;<date when="1834-00-00">1834</date></hi> (New Haven, <date when="1934-00-00">1934</date>).</note> It is not in your Library, I doubt, but is for certain in the Advocates#x2019;, whence I must show you how it is to be extracted.</p>
<p>If you know any Advocate in town at present, the business will be easy: especially if our friend Moir is there, who has engaged to let me have <hi rend="italic">ten</hi> volumes from his List, none of which <supplied>[have I yet</supplied>] called for. Weir<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Weir (<date when="1802-00-00">1802</date>&#x2013;<date when="1858-00-00">58</date>), journalist and advocate; educated at Ayr Academy and the University of G&#xF6;ttingen; called to the Scottish bar, <date when="1827-00-00">1827</date>; later became editor of the Glasgow <hi rend="italic">Argus;</hi> then joined the <hi rend="italic">Daily News</hi> in <date when="1846-00-00">1846</date>, becoming editor in <date when="1854-00-00">1854</date>. In <date when="1830-00-00">1830</date> he was living at 40 Cumberland St.</note> also would be ready to help me; or <supplied>[&#x2014;&#x2014; if Weir is]</supplied> not in Town. On the whole, I know not rightly how to direct you; and, if Moir is not there, must leave it all to your own discretion, and <pb id="pg-05-89" n="05:89"/>benevolence. <hi rend="italic">Barclay</hi>, I hope, you will find in your own Library, and also <hi rend="italic">Reynard:</hi> at worst, I can do without <hi rend="italic">Horn</hi> if it is not to be had. But, for the love of Heaven, get me those other two; or convince me that they are not to be got!</p>
<p>The last point regards the transmission of them. If you can leave the volumes, any time before next Tuesday, with Mr Aitken, &#x2018;Bell &#x26; Bradfute#x2019;s Bank-street,#x2019; with direction to send them off <hi rend="italic">immediately</hi>, along with whatever others may be there for me (a parcel from Moir will be there, unless it come tomorrow), the whole business wil be beautifully managed.&#x2014; Do you know a Bookseller in George-street, (by Sign, I mean) called &#x2018;John Boyd<supplied>[#x2019;]</supplied>?<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Bookseller and publisher, 37 George St.</note> He has had two rags of Magazines belonging to me (Fraser#x2019;s Town and Country London Magazine) which he should have sent over to Bank-street, about six weeks ago. The Town and C. Magazines I believe not to be worth a rush each; only if you saw the man#x2019;s sign, and could order him to do his duty, before Tuesday, it were more satifactory. The Able Editor sends them to me.</p>
<p>Forgive, forgive this impudent Invoice, which has no feature of a Letter. But I am like a carman on Leith walk, and my <foreign>garron</foreign> [horse] has fallen and is strangling, and I call on Heaven and Earth and all charitable men to bear a hand, and cut the straps. Oh had he but <hi rend="italic">this</hi> load off him, how he would snuff up the east-wind, and to his death refuse every such other!</p>
<p>Mrs. C. is well, and busy with gardeners and garden-seeds, and kindly salutes you. We hold it a thing fixed that you will come and see us the very next time <supplied>[words cut away]</supplied> ed. Write with these Books, or write <hi rend="italic">with</hi><supplied>[<hi rend="italic">out</hi>] [words cut away] [th]</supplied>at I may be put out of suspense), and tell <supplied>[words cut away]</supplied> and sincerely what you are doing and <supplied>[words cut away]</supplied> ing.

<salute>My Dear Jack,</salute>
<p>I must write you a few hurried lines, tho#x2019; I am far, far back with my day#x2019;s-work, lest you get too anxious. We are very glad to learn <pb id="pg-05-90" n="05:90"/>that you have come to a fixed resolution, and what is better begun to put it in execution.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John#x2019;s letter announcing his change of address and his &#x201C;fixed resolution&#x201D; has not been found.</note> For the thousandth time, I repeat that I think there is <hi rend="italic">no</hi> fear of you, so will but set your shoulder stoutly to the wheel. Write your Papers then, the best you are able; think with yourself, take counsel with your kind Friends; and dread no evil issue. A time of toil, of obscurity and dissatisfaction you must look for: but &#x2018;a free field for you and no favour,#x2019; say I; and the day <hi rend="italic">will</hi> not go against you. Keep a <hi rend="italic">hank and spingit</hi>, as Joe Elliott was wont to advise:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Heart and a spirit</hi>, so pronounced by J. E.&#x201D; (Mary Aitken Carlyle#x2019;s note quoted by Norton).</note> the world is wide, and our Doil will make himself a place there. The very thought that he is attempting such a thing will be as oil to his head. Once on his own legs, I hardly know the man I would not pit him against.</p>
<p>Now tell us how you get on with your Translations, and Speculations; and what face the world wears towards you. Have you ever written to your Baron<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Baron von Eichthal.</note> yet, about those Letters Introductory to the Germans resident in London? I think they might do you good: it is at least one little corner of the medical vineyard not likely to be so crowded with labourers. What of Sprengel?<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-05/lt-18300319-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1830-03-19">19 March</date></ref></note> I understand Murray<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Murray (<date when="1778-00-00">1778</date>&#x2013;<date when="1843-00-00">1843</date>), the publisher.

If he will not have your services, let him &#x2018;go to Jerusalem#x2019;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A saying of Carlyle#x2019;s father. See <ref target="volume-04/lt-18270619-TC-AC-01"><sic>4:233</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1827-06-19">19 June 1827</date></corr></ref>.</note> and seek better. The world is not so all-wise or so all-foolish but a sensible man that has any useful word to speak, may find plenty of encouragement to speak it. In one word, dear Doctor and Brother, wear a head upon thy shoulders, and a heart within thy sternum: look out sharply what is to be done, and do it with all thy might and speed. And so God bless thee, Jack; and keep thee always in poverty or wealth, my true Brother!</p>
<p>I must now narrate this and the other; how we are all &#x2018;getting on#x2019; here. God be thanked we are all afoot still; no sick body or broken heart among us. Our Mother is still here; your Letter reached her about a week ago. She is waiting chiefly, I believe, till Alick return from the House in the Moor Fair, whither he is gone this morning to <pb id="pg-05-91" n="05:91"/>sell his sheep; having gone in vain the foregoing week, so bad was the Sale; and returned, on Larry, for the intervening days, to get along with his sowing. He cannot account himself a prosperous Farmer at present, as what Farmer is?&#x2014;and knows not whether he will keep this place another year: however, there are no bones broken, and we will decide the best we can when the time comes. Our Mother is very tolerably well; so, we hear, are the Scotsbrig people. It is growing spring, the larches will all be green one of those days, the Birds seem already wedded, and Men are getting their crops in as they can. My <foreign><hi rend="italic">Weibchen</hi></foreign> has the &#x2018;Factor,#x2019;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Meaning, humorously, Joe Elliott.</note> as Alick calls him, daily delving in the Garden, at the slowest of rates, yet happily he is near done now. He leaves us at Whitsunday, rather to our regret and now, I believe, greatly to his own; he has made a very considerable improvement in the look of things here, and has no fault but his vanity, which is considerable. We get &#x2018;Canny#x2019; Bretton, once herdsboy at Mainhill, in his stead, and flatter ourselves it is fair exchange.</p>
<p>I myself am writing daily at that <hi rend="italic">History</hi>, not without spirit; and in spite of Booksellers, Carriers, Nature and my stars. Tell Fraser I shall surely have the first Volume ready for Press, early in <date when="1830-05-00">May</date>; <supplied>[I]</supplied> wish <hi rend="italic">much</hi> to get forward fast with the printing of it. Those <supplied>[books]</supplied> he sent by a &#x2018;private hand#x2019; seem never to have been delivered: they had <hi rend="italic">not</hi> reached Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> ten days ago, but perhaps will come tomorrow. I can do without them; I will do without everything and all things; I have sworn it. Will you tell Mrs Strachey that I got a Book from Mr Greaves with a highly flattering Note, <note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Pierrepont Greaves (<date when="1777-00-00">1777</date>&#x2013;<date when="1842-00-00">1842</date>) wrote Carlyle on <date when="1830-01-06">6 Jan.</date>, praising his writings and offering to lend him &#x201C;Jacob Behmens works in German, should you feel it wise to tell men what D<hi rend="italic">r</hi>. Isaac Newton did not.&#x201D;</note> for which I beg that she would heartily thank him in my name. Gleig#x2019;s project of Goethe#x2019;s Life seems to be dropt, and he wants greatly to know <hi rend="italic">when</hi> I could let him have my <hi rend="italic">Life of Luther</hi>.<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle refers to Gleig#x2019;s letter of <date when="1830-03-28"> 28 March</date>.</note> <foreign><hi rend="italic">Nimmer und niemals</hi></foreign> [Not now or ever]! I rather believe. When I write that Book of the great German Lion, it shall be the best Book I have ever written, and go forth, I think, on its own legs. Do you know, we are actually talking of spending the next winter in Weimar; and preparing all the raw material of right <hi rend="italic">Luther</hi>, there at the fountain-head. That, of course, if I can get this <hi rend="italic">History</hi> done, and have the cash.&#x2014; George Johnstone has left Marsden, and settled, on favourable terms, Simpson told me, somewhere in Cheshire.<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-03/lt-18250321-TC-JAC-01"><sic>3:303</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1825-03-21">21 March 1825</date></corr></ref>.</note> I will get you his address the first free chance I have; sooner if <pb id="pg-05-92" n="05:92"/>you want it.&#x2014;Tell the noble Mrs Montague that she has not sunk but risen in my regards; that some spare-hour ere long shall be hers and my own. You must kindly remember me to Mrs Strachey, and may if you like go often to see her. I reckon her one of the deepest-hearted and on the whole best women I have ever known. But tell not this in Bedford-square!<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mrs. Montagu, who lived at 25 Bedford Square, thoroughly disliked Mrs. Strachey, who she believed had come between her and Edward Irving.</note>&#x2014; Also forget not again to speak of the Kitty that was.<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Kitty Kirkpatrick#x2019;s marriage to Captain Phillipps had taken place on <date when="1829-11-21">21 Nov. 1829</date>.</note>&#x2014; Make my compliments to Allan Cunningham: have you ever seen William Gray?<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Oxonian.

<ps><p>The <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> comes with perfect regularity; and tho#x2019; a week old is a great blessing. Continue it, if you can. Nay, if it came on Saturday (that is half a week old) this were perhaps the best of all arrangements. No Spectator in the world is worthy to snuff the candle to it, tho#x2019; it too is a Radical and half-infidel. Has Fraser settled with the Rivingtons?<note n="15" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The publishing house of Rivington had been founded by Charles Rivington (<date when="1688-00-00">1688</date>&#x2013;<date when="1742-00-00">1742</date>). It published numerous books on theology and brought out Richardson#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Pamela</hi> in <date when="1740-00-00">1740</date>. The Rivingtons of Carlyle#x2019;s day were Charles (<date when="1754-00-00">1754</date>&#x2013;<date when="1831-00-00">1831</date>) and John (<date when="1779-00-00">1779</date>&#x2013;<date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>). On <date when="1830-05-03">3 May</date> William Fraser wrote to Carlyle: &#x201C;It was utterly impossible to go onward in company with those Black &#x26; Youngs&#x2014;there was a degree of slipperiness about them that I never saw surpassed even in the most experienced double-dealer&#x2014;and they were, daily, doing something to compromise and irritate me. I therefore at once threw up the Editorship, and since I have done so I really feel a weight taken off my spirits. What would you wish me to do with the Article on Schiller? If you have no immediate use for it I much wish you would give it to my namesake Fraser for his Magazine and I will get from him the same rate of remuneration that the Foreign Review would have given.&#x201D;</note> Poor fellow! Tell him I will stand by him to all lengths in honesty, for he deserves it. Jeffrey is about going to London:<note n="16" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On <date when="1830-03-25">25 March</date> Jeffrey had written in reply to Carlyle#x2019;s refusal to accept money from him. He accepted the situation, saying, &#x201C;I admit the general rule to be as you put it&#x2014;and that men must be either above or below the average to depart from it with safety. &#x2026; In the mean time, believe that I am gratified, as I ought to be, by your promise of applying to me if you have occasion&#x2014;tho#x2019; I cannot but say that I am mortified by your expressions of surprise at the very simple and natural course to be followed.&#x201D; Carlyle does not say anything more to John about Jeffrey here, though he had told him of the original offer in <ref target="volume-05/lt-18300319-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1830-03-19">19 March</date></ref></note> if I <pb id="pg-05-93" n="05:93"/>can manage to get you his address in time, you may go and call on him<supplied>[.]</supplied> Our Mother is sitting with Jane in the Parlour (after tea), I must carry them this (from the Library) to read.

<p>Mr Editor,&#x2014; Some time last Autumn,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Reported in the <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi>, <date when="1829-09-22">22 Sept. 1829</date>, as a &#x201C;melancholy and fatal accident,&#x201D; which had happened much as Carlyle describes it on the night of <date when="1829-09-14">14</date>&#x2013;<date when="1829-09-15">15 Sept.</date> The young lover was Thomas Bell (a miller of Buckymill), who was to have been married to Agnes Mucklet, and who was shot by Edward Lane, an Englishman, who had been in Scotland only about a month. The sheriff was said to have &#x201C;investigated the case fully,&#x201D; but he evidently decided to do nothing.</note> a &#x2018;Fatal Accident#x2019; stood recorded in the Newspapers, of a young man having come by his death, at a place called Knockhill, near Ecclefechan, in this County, under somewhat singular circumstances. The young man, it appeared, had been engaged in some courtship with one of the maid-servants of the house; had come that night to see her, in the fashion common, or indeed universal with men of his station, in that quarter; was overheard by the Butler; was challenged, pursued; and refusing to answer any interrogatory, but hastening only to escape, was shot dead by him on the spot. No man who has lived three weeks in the South of Scotland can be ignorant that such visits occur nightly everywhere, and have occurred from time immemorial: it is a custom by many blamed, by some applauded: in the romantic spirit sometimes displayed in it; in the long journeyings and wistful waitings for an interview; in the faithfulness with which the rustic wooer, at all hazards, keeps his secret, which is also another#x2019;s, Dr Currie traces, among our peasants, some resemblance to &#x2018;the gallantry of a Spanish Cavalier.#x2019;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Currie, <hi rend="italic">The Works of Robert Burns</hi>, 4 vols. (Liverpool, <date when="1800-00-00">1800</date>), with a prefatory &#x201C;Life,&#x201D; &#x201C;Criticism on his Writings,&#x201D; and &#x201C;Some Observations on the Character and Condition of the Scottish Peasantry.&#x201D; See I, 16&#x2013;17, where he says that &#x201C;a Scottish peasant often exerts a spirit of adventure, of which a Spanish Cavalier need not be ashamed. After the labours of the day are over, he sets out for the habitation of his mistress. &#x2026; He approaches her in secresy [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>], under the disguise of night. A signal at the door or window &#x2026; gives information of his arrival. &#x2026; But if she favours his addresses, she escapes unobserved. &#x2026; Interviews of this kind are the subjects of many of the Scottish songs, some of the most beautiful of which Burns has imitated or improved. In the art which they celebrate he was perfectly skilled; he knew and had practised all its mysteries.&#x201D; The <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi> also noted that the tragedy would remind its readers of many of the ballads, especially that about Helen of Kirkconnell, for which see <ref target="volume-03/lt-18250624-TC-JBW-01"><sic>3:340</sic><corr>TC to JBW, <date when="1825-06-24">24 June 1825</date></corr></ref>.</note> In company <pb id="pg-05-94" n="05:94"/>with the Butler, so fatally watchful on this occasion, were two men to have assisted him in any defence, in any seizure: whether he knew the individual fugitive, then within some feet of his gun, is uncertain; that he guessed his errand there, is scarcely so: enough, the poor young man, who had refused to speak, fell to the ground, exclaiming only, &#x2018;O lasses! lasses!#x2019; and in few instants was no more.</p>
<lg><l>&#x2018;Ready or not ready, no delay!</l>
<l>On to his Judge#x2019;s Bar he must away.#x2019;</l></lg>
<p>Last week I looked over your Circuit Intelligence, with some anxiety to see how this case had been disposed of; but unfortunately without effect; there was no notice of it there. Interesting trials enough we had; trials for attempting to shoot rabbits, for writing &#x2018;marriage-lines,#x2019; for stealing a pair of breeches; but for the &#x2018;shedder of blood#x2019; there was no trial. To none of his Majesty#x2019;s Justiciars, it would seem, has any hint of that transaction been communicated. Whether it was ever so much as glanced at<supplied>[,]</supplied> much less, thoroughly sifted by any official personage, high or low, appears not from the record. Nowhere will the smallest hint or whisper of it.</p>
<p>May I ask, in the name of all that is wonderful, how this has been? Is it lawful, then, to put to death any individual whom you may find flirting with your maid, after ten at night?

<salute>My Dear Brother Jack,</salute>
<p>I meant to write last Wednesday; but was in a dreadful hurry, not having done with my task; and thought the Newspaper would answer instead. I forgot that I <supplied>[had]</supplied> some little thing to tell you, which might not so well wait: and tho#x2019; quite worn out tonight, having written like a Turk all day, I will send notice about that, at all events. You are to understand that Philosophe Jeffrey <foreign><hi rend="italic">mit Weib und Kind</hi></foreign> [with wife and child]<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In German the phrase often implies &#x201C;with all his goods and belongings.&#x201D;</note> is in London; and I think it will at all events gratify you <pb id="pg-05-96" n="05:96"/>for half an hour to go and call on him. His specific address, he writing from Edinburgh could not give me; but said that anything directed (I think, for the man writes miserably):<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jeffrey#x2019;s handwriting is extremely difficult to read.</note> &#x2018;J. Richardson, 21. Fludyer Street, Westminister,#x2019; would find him; and that &#x2018;nothing would give him greater pleasure than to see my Brother.#x2019; So <foreign>spier</foreign> <supplied>[inquire]</supplied> him out, if you like; and go and show face; your face will tell your errand sufficiently, and you will find Mr J. one of the daintiest, kindliest, best little men you ever set eyes on: a perfect jewel of a man. Whether he can do anything for you I know not; but if he can, it will give him great pleasure to do it. At all events, you will find a well-wisher there for my sake, and your own. And so, let this be considered settled.</p>
<p>Much it delights me, my dear Jack, to figure you now as in the way of clear well-doing; and that I can write to you without any little grudge or reservation, as to my worthy and well-beloved Brother, struggling forward beside me in the battle of Life; to whom I can give an &#x2018;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Euge</hi></foreign> [Good luck]!#x2019; and word of encouragement if nothing more. Do not work too hard, for there is a measure in all things; do not encounter those &#x2018;dull headaches#x2019; lest they lead to something worse. Neither take too deep thought for the morrow: I care not, why should you care, <hi rend="italic">how</hi> you prosper outwardly, so your heart and bearing be that of a true man; let the world take its own sway: &#x2018;meat, clothes and fire#x2019;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Pope, &#x201C;Moral Essays: Epistle III,&#x201D; ll. 81&#x2013;82.</note> are all that Rothschild or Guelf<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Rothschilds were a wealthy family of German Jews stemming from Meyer Amschel Rothschild (<date when="1743-00-00">1743</date>&#x2013;<date when="1812-00-00">1812</date>), later members of which spread out over Europe. Guelph was the family name of the Dukes of Brunswick, who became the house of Hanover, to which George I and his successors belonged.</note> himself can wring out of it. There is no Act of Parliament in Heaven#x2019;s Chancery that you or I are to be rich men, or famous men; only the sternest and solemnest enactment that we are to be good men, &#x2018;diligent in business and fervent in spirit#x2019;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Rom. 12:11.</note>&#x2014;reverencing the inscrutable God, and &#x2018;friendly at once and fearless towards all that God has made.#x2019;</p>
<p>I long much to hear more minutely of your progress, and outlooks: pray take a large sheet, and fill it well with all this; not in a hurry, tho#x2019; you should miss the Post: we will get it three days later. When the printing of that Book begins, we shall have frequent opportunities, and it will be as of old in the days of M#x2019;Corkindale!<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Foreman of Ballantyne#x2019;s, the printers. See <ref target="volume-04/lt-18260125-JBW-MAC-01"><sic>4:27</sic><corr>JBW to MAC, <date when="1826-01-25">25 Jan. 1826</date></corr></ref>.</note></p>
<p>There is nothing but favourable, at least indifferent tidings to send you hence; inasmuch as we are all alive and stirring, the most of us <pb id="pg-05-97" n="05:97"/>very busy. Alick got your Letter, and will write (he tells me this evening) when the first Parcel goes. He is very busy afield; has got his rent not paid, yet settled for this term, and signified officially that if times do not greatly mend, he must remove next Whitsunday; so that one bad business is for the time put by. Elliott is mowing greens (or rather <hi rend="italic">the</hi> green) and laying out a new one most beautiful to look on where the Peatstack stood; and gravelling Garden walks; and working miracles in all directions. Jane goes out about him, and sees the &#x2018;Defence of Order#x2019; practically manifested: for the rest, she sits beside me here where I write, and reads or sews, and never utters <hi rend="italic">Mum</hi>. I myself am toiling, as I have said, with impetuosity; writing from three to four pages daily (when it is easy, alas! many a day I have hammered my brains from morning to night, and written nothing): the first volume is to be done in a fortnight. I am now in the heart of the <hi rend="italic">Nibelungen Lied</hi>, which I like much. The Book will be worth next to nothing, yet readable enough, and will do no mischief. I long and pray only that it were off my hands: for Compilation, and this is or can be little more, in the present state of things, pleaseth me little.</p>
<p>These fine days often bring me in mind of last Spring and you. Nay I have now mounted your hair cap,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A fur cap from Germany.</note> and ride with it (or rather mean to do so) when wind is up. I have been out three or four mornings lately in that way; for I get off sleep, and grow <hi rend="italic">billus</hi> when scribbling. But as for the Cap, I will prize it above all caps, and think when it hangs on the cloakpin that I hear the voice of poor Doil, saying Brother remember me! Yes, my brave Doil, I will remember thee, and thy true heart, so long as memory lives within me.&#x2014; But let us avoid the pathetic&#x2014; Here is supper come!</p>
<p>Your Book-Parcel came duly in the very nick of time. I want nothing more for the first volume: could you get me a <hi rend="italic">Luthers Werke</hi> (I think, Walch#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">with the Life</hi>, in the middle)<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Johann Georg Walch (<date when="1693-00-00">1693</date>&#x2013;<date when="1775-00-00">1775</date>), ed. <hi rend="italic">Luthers Werke</hi>, 24 vols.

My Mother who is a better judge than I, declared it to be soundest doctrine, often preached in her hearing<supplied>[.]</supplied></p>
<p>She went away, that good Mother, precisely this day fortnight: Alick took her down; she &#x2018;did not like to go with Elliott, at least no so weel.#x2019; I have heard little specific since Alick returned: but understand and believe them to be all well. Mary is for Annan Fair on Thursday and will bring us fresh word.&#x2014; Here comes the Newspaper up from Alick#x2019;s and I must fold the same. Do you get it rightly? Is it worth sending?

<salute>My Dear Father,</salute>
<p>Mary is going down tomorrow, and will tell you all our news, more at large than I could do here. However, I write a hurried line, were it only to signify under hand and seal that I am still living, and anxious to hear that you are prospering.</p>
<p>Sandy tells me that you were to pay Robison for that Cart, either at Annan or at Lockerby: I fancy it will be about ten pounds. I learned also the other day that you had never received a penny of payment for that meal, and other <foreign><hi rend="italic">etceteras;</hi></foreign> whereat, as Edward Irving says, &#x2018;our mind was staggered not a little.#x2019; I believe we might raise cash here to clear off all these scores: but, as matters are like to stand for a week or two, it would leave us rather bare. Alick has some three Pounds of mine which he says he can give me; here is another five-pounds, which makes eight; wherewith perhaps, Robison#x2019;s demand may be stilled a little; and the other arrears shall be brought up, if I keep health, in the course of a little time. I am happy that except some trifle to his Majesty (for taxes) I owe nothing to any man but my own Father.</p>
<p>Mary will leave word that the lad or man Bretton may come up when he likes, and bear a hand at peat-casting and so forth. We are rather sorry to part with Elliott, who seems a very innocent handy kind of body, and might have done quite well here, had he possessed proper Philosophy. I gave him a word of admonition, the other day; and he has worked like a lion ever since. If Bretton do as well, I shall never object to him; seeing, perfection either in man or master lies <hi rend="italic">so</hi> very far from our hand as in this world we find it do.</p>
<p>I grieved, for my Mother that wild day; yet, I am told, she got pretty well home. I hope, both she and you are feeling the influence of this fine weather, which is making the whole world smile; and are <pb id="pg-05-100" n="05:100"/>enjoying more health than when I saw you. A little stirring about, and no hard working, is the recipe for both.</p>
<p>You and Mag, especially you, are the greater strangers here now. Were the crop once in, would it not be easy for you to yoke a cart, and show face here? Nay we would gladly send the man, and the long-legged beast for you, and take you back that way also. Think seriously of this. Mag at least, who is by profession, a traveller (to public markets), and well respected here and everywhere, could have no objection.</p>
<p>Perhaps I shall be down myself to see you, one of these weeks. I am writing furiously; and shall have done with a volume (a <hi rend="italic">dud</hi>, I fear it will prove) in some ten days, or a fortnight.&#x2014; We heard from Jack last when Alick came up; but got a Newspaper from him last Wednesday. He will get a Letter of mine tomorrow, and most likely we shall soon hear again. I do not see his medical course quite clearly in London; but he may readily support himself there by other means; and that will do wonders for him. He is a solid well-built man, body and mind; only very ill to harness. I prophecy considerable things of him.&#x2014; Now the paper is done, and I must bid you all good night. Every good be with you! The great Father have us all his in keeping! <closer><salute>Your Aff<hi rend="italic">e</hi> Son,</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>Dear Jack&#x2014;</salute> It is midnight, and I am as tired as man need be; so take one line, and be thankful. We expected a Letter last Wednesday; but none came, not even a Newspaper: perhaps tomorrow we shall prosper better.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John had written a fulsome letter to Thomas on <date when="1830-05-17">17 May</date> which the brothers had not received. In it he had said, in part: &#x201C;Just now I have completed the manufacture of a rather long paper on An. Magnetism, entirely different from the former, for Fraser#x2019;s Magazine; and <supplied>[the]</supplied> last number contains a short one on Medical Quackery. Neither will do harm; and they will give me the means of &#x2018;fencing off#x2019; that dire fiend necessity. I do not like writing for the magazine; but the Foreign Review is gone, and I have no other resource in the mean time. I also translated a little Latin tract of Lord Bacon#x2019;s for B. Montagu, for which he paid me liberally, and I have now two longer ones before me which he has since given me. From Murray I have been able to procure no answer about Sprengel; indeed I have not seen him since I wrote last, and am now fairly tired of calling; and really care not whether he &#x2018;undertakes#x2019; or not. &#x2026;<lb/><lb/>
&#x201C;&#x2026; Should I accept of Montagu and Badam#x2019;s offer of securing me a sufficient sum till I get into practice, I do not think it would diminish my zeal in endeavouring to do for myself, but rather tend to increase it by giving me confidence in addition. At all events by waiting longer I shall lose time, and make people think I am a very irresolute personage. There is no place in the world where men are so ready to take you at your own estimate as in London. &#x2026; If a man have but unwavering confidence, he cannot fail to prosper. &#x2026; I saw <supplied>[William]</supplied> Fraser last thursday when I intended to write you, and he seemed to expect the first part of the Germ<hi rend="italic">n</hi> History immediately. He talked something too about a Life of Luther which Colburn &#x26; Bentley were going to ask you to write &#x26; thought you should not undertake it for less than 300&#xa3; and that they would give so much. I told him you would most likely not undertake it at all just now; but that there could be no harm in applying to you, more especially as it will not be wanted for more than a <supplied>[year?]</supplied>. &#x2026; Jeffrey &#x2026; received me very kindly and courteously. Before your letter came Jeffrey had got my address from Proctor [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] and written to me to breakfast with them, or if I could not, to tell him when he might find me at home! I liked him very well, and also Mrs Jeffrey tho#x2019; I had less conversation with her. He gave me a letter to Charles Bell one of the professors of the University here, which I have not delivered yet. I saw them twice only. &#x2026; Mrs Montagu speaks of writing to Jane &#x26; persuading her and you to be here about the beginning of <date when="1830-09-00">September</date>. &#x2026; Coleridge has been unwell of late, but is now getting better: I saw him yesterday for the second time. I believe there is no man in the island &#x2018;puts more thought through himself.#x2019; &#x2026; I saw Allen, your old friend, at his house in Epping Forest (whither I had acc<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Mrs Montagu &#x2026;).&#x201D;</note> Are you well, Jack? If so all is well. They (Ma<supplied>[r]</supplied>y and Alick) <pb id="pg-05-101" n="05:101"/>are going to Scotsbrig tomorrow (or rather Mary is only for Dumfries, I believe), and I was to have gone with them; but am too bilious, and will rather rest a day first.

<salute>My Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I cannot but feel much flattered by your desire to enlist me under your flag; and shall surely, one way or other, had I time to consider of it, find a place for myself and service there.</p>
<p>The Popular History of Germany is a thing which has been passing thro#x2019; my own head, of late; but the difficulties deter me. The History of Germany, like that of Greece, <hi rend="italic">can</hi> hardly be written well; there is no Unity in it: the country with its interests is a heterogenous Aggregate, not a Whole; the Imperial Constitution not its <hi rend="italic">soul</hi>, but rather a loose garment or wrappage mechanically and even then very imperfectly binding it together. At all events, I am dreadfully sick of Compilation for the present; and dare not, till these troubled waters (of a certain <hi rend="italic">History of German Literature</hi>, at present occupying me) are subsided and forgotten, look any similar adventure in the face.</p>
<p>Meanwhile to show you how ready I were, could any good be done, I make the following proposal:</p>
<p>Frederick the Great, as an Author, Soldier, King and Man, well deserves to have his History written; better perhaps than Charles XII, whose Biography by Voltaire<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >[Fran&#x26;ccedil;ois Marie Arouet de Voltaire], <hi rend="italic">Histoire de Charles XII, Roi de Su&#xE8;de, par M. de V</hi> &#x2026;, 2 vols. (Basle, <date when="1731-00-00">1731</date>).</note> has always seemed to me one of the most delightful Books. Let your Publishers offer me Three hundred pounds, and time to heat the historico-biographical crucible and fill it and fuse it properly, and I will give them the best single Volume I can on the brave Fritz: I think it might be ready before this time twelvemonth; and very probably I might go to Germany in winter to inquire into it better.</p>
<p>This is the most eligible enterprise I can think of at present: if you can arrange your side of it on these terms, I shall be very happy to hear so, as soon as possible, and proceed forthwith to take measures for performing mine. I do believe, a rather good Book might be written on the subject; at all events, I am willing to try.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >This letter significantly provides a very early statement of Carlyle#x2019;s willingness to write a biography of Frederick the Great.</note></p>

<p>The Weimar Letter,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Goethe#x2019;s letter, dated <date when="1830-04-13">13 April</date>, in Norton#x2019;s translation reads in part: &#x201C;The precious casket, after a long delay in reaching the Continent owing to the extreme severity of the winter, at last arrived safely about the middle of <date when="1830-03-00">March</date>.
<p>&#x201C;As to its contents, I will mention first the incomparable lock of hair, which one would indeed have liked to see along with the dear head, but which, when it came to light by itself here, almost alarmed me. The contrast was too striking; for I did not need to touch my skull to become aware that only stubble was left there, nor was it necessary for me to go to the looking-glass to learn that a long flight of time had given it a discoloured look. The impossibility of making the desired return smote my heart, and forced thoughts upon me which one usually prefers to banish. In the end, however, nothing remained for me but to content myself with the reflection that such a gift was to be most thankfully received without hope of any adequate requital. For the rest it shall be kept sacred in the portfolio which is worthy of it, and only the most cherished objects shall bear it company.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The elegant Scotch <hi rend="italic">Bonnet</hi>, I can assure you, has given much pleasure. For many years we have been visited by inhabitants of the Three Kingdoms, who like to remain with us for a time, and enjoy good society. Among these, indeed, there are comparatively few Scotchmen; yet there cannot fail to be preserved in some fair heart here so lively an image of one of your countrymen that she must regard the splendid national head-dress, including the thistle, as a most pleasing ornament; and the kind donor would certainly be delighted to see the most charming face in the world peering out from beneath it. Ottilie sends her most grateful thanks, and will not fail, as soon as our days of mourning are over [for the death of the Dowager Grand Duchess who had died in <date when="1830-02-00">Feb.</date>], to make a glorious appearance in it.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Let me now announce the despatch of another parcel in return, which will probably be put together by <date when="1830-06-00">June</date>, as the most favourable time of the year. You will receive: [Goethe lists the German translation of Carlyle#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Schiller</hi>; four more volumes of Goethe-Schiller correspondence; a fifth installment of his <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>; a copy of his <hi rend="italic">Farbenlehre;</hi> and an offer to give his thoughts on the sequence of epochs of German literature for Carlyle#x2019;s history].&#x201D;</p></note> now as ever the most welcome that could arrive here, reached us, in due course, some two weeks ago. We rejoice to learn that you are still well and busy, still gratified with our love for you, and still sending over the Ocean a kind thought to us in our remote home. This fair relation and intercourse with what we have most cause to venerate on Earth seems one of the strangest things in our Life, which however is all built on Wonder: <foreign><hi rend="italic">Ce quej#x2019;admire le plus c#x2019;est de</hi> <hi rend="small-caps">me voir ici</hi></foreign> [What astonishes me most is to <hi rend="small-caps">see myself here</hi>].</p>
<p>I know not whether I should mention the sort of hope which has <pb id="pg-05-104" n="05:104"/>again arisen of our even seeing you in person, one day: that long-cherished project of a visit to Germany now assumes some faint shape of possibility; in which pilgrimage Weimar, the grand Sanctuary, without which indeed <foreign><hi rend="italic">Deutschland</hi></foreign> were but as other Lands to us, would nowise be forgotten. But it is better to check such Day-dreams than encourage them; the impediments and counter-chances are so many, as Time, which brings Roses,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >German proverb.</note> brings also far other products. Happy it is, meanwhile, that whether we ever meet in the body or not, we have already met you in spirit, which union can never be parted, or made of no effect. Here, in our mountain solitude, you are often an inmate with us; and can whisper wise lessons and pleasant tales in the ear of the Lady herself. She spends many an evening with you, and has done all winter, greatly to her satisfaction. One of her last performances was the <hi rend="italic">Deutschen Ausgewanderten</hi>,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The only citation of the <hi rend="italic">Unterhandlungen Deutscher Ausgewanderten</hi> in the British Museum Catalogue gives a Swedish edition (Upsala, <date when="1813-00-00">1813</date>). This book was in a German edition of his <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> as early as <date when="1811-00-00">1811</date>.</note> and that glorious <foreign><hi rend="italic">M&#xE4;hrchen</hi></foreign> a True Universe of Imagination; in regard to the manifold, inexhaustible significance of which, for the female eye guessed a significance under it, was oftener applied to for exposition than I could give it; and at last, to quiet importunities, was obliged to promise that I would some day write a Commentary on it, as on one of the deepest most poetical things even Goethe had ever written.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Translated by Carlyle as &#x201C;The Tale&#x201D; and published with a commentary in <hi rend="italic">Fraser#x2019;s Magazine</hi>, VI (<date when="1832-10-00">Oct. 1832</date>), 257&#x2013;78; republished in <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XXVII, 447&#x2013;79.</note></p>
<p>Nay, looking abroad, I can farther reflect with pleasure that thousands of my countrymen, who had need enough of such an acquaintance, are now also beginning to know you: of late years, the voice of Dulness, which was once loud enough on this matter, has been growing feebler and feebler; so that now, so far as I hear, it is altogether silent, and quite a new tone has succeeded it. On the whole, Britain and Germany will not always remain strangers; but rather like two Sisters that have been long divided by distance and evil tongues, will meet lovingly together, and find that they are near of kin.</p>
<p>Since you are friendly enough to offer me help and countenance in my endeavours that way, let me lose no time in profiting thereby. In regard to that <hi rend="italic">History of German Literature</hi>, I need not say, for it is plain by itself, that no word of yours, can be other than valuable. Doubtless it were a high favour, could you impart to me any summary of that great object, in the structure and historical sequence and coherence <pb id="pg-05-105" n="05:105"/>it has with you: your views, whether from my point of vision or not, whether contradictory of mine, or confirmatory, could not fail to be instructive. For your guidance in this charitable service, perhaps my best method will be to explain, as clearly as I can here, what plan my Book specially follows, so far as it is yet written, or decidedly shaped in my thoughts:</p>
<p>Volume First, which was finished and sent to press a few days ago, opens with some considerations on the great and growing importance of Literature; the value of Literary commerce with other nations; therefore of Literary Histories, which forward this: then some sketch of the method to be followed in a Literary History of Germany, where so much is yet altogether unknown to us, and only some approximation to a <hi rend="italic">History</hi> is possible for the present. Next comes a chapter on the old Germans of Tacitus, the Northern Immigrations (<foreign><hi rend="italic">V&#xF6;lkerwanderung</hi></foreign>), and the primitive national character of this Poeple [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>]; the chief features of which are valour (<foreign><hi rend="italic">Tapferkeit</hi></foreign>) and meditative Depth; not forgetting, at the same time, our own Saxon origin, and claims, by general brotherhood and in virtue of so many Hengists and Alfreds, to a share in that praise. Then something of the German Traditions; of their Language, as the most indestructible of Traditions, whereby Ulfila and his Bible<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ulfila (<date when="0311-00-00">311?</date>&#x2013;<date when="0381-00-00">381</date>), bishop and apostle of Christianity to the Goths; through his translations of the scriptures into Gothic he is said to have been the father of Teutonic literature.</note> come to be mentioned: farther of their ancient Superstitions, and still existing <foreign><hi rend="italic">Volksm&#xE4;hrchen</hi></foreign>, with a little specimen of these. Then of long-written Traditions; of the <hi rend="italic">Heldenbuch</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Nibelungen Lied</hi>, with their old environment of Fiction, looked at only from afar: especially a long chapter on the <hi rend="italic">Nibelungen</hi>, already an object of curiosity here. The last Chapter is entitled <hi rend="italic">The Minnesingers</hi>, and looks back briefly to the time of Charlemagne, and forward to that of Rodolf von Hapsburg; endeavouring to delineate the chivalrous spirit of the Swabian Era; and to show that here really was a Poetic Period, tho#x2019; a feeble, simple and <hi rend="italic">young</hi> one; man being now for the first time inspired with an Infinite Idea, having now for the first time seen that he was a Man.&#x2014; This is all I have yet brought to paper, and I fear it is worth little.</p>
<p>Next follows what I might denominate a <hi rend="italic">Didactic Period</hi>, wherein figure <hi rend="italic">Hugo von Trimberg</hi>,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >German poet (ca. <date when="1230-00-00">1230</date>&#x2013;<date when="1313-00-00">1313</date>).</note> the author of <hi rend="italic">Reineke Fuchs</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Sebastian Brandt:</hi> it reaches its culmination, and rises to a poetical degree, under <hi rend="italic">Luther</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Hutten;</hi> then again sinks, so far as Literature <pb id="pg-05-106" n="05:106"/>is concerned, into Theological disputation, or mere Grammatical and superficial refinement, thro#x2019; many a <hi rend="italic">Thomasius</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Gottsched</hi>,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-05/lt-18300320-TC-JPE-01">TC to JPE, <date when="1830-03-20">20 March</date></ref></note> down to utter Unbelief and Sensualism, when Poetry, except in accidental tones, foreign in that age, has died away, and become impossible. Of such accidental appearances, I might reckon <hi rend="italic">Opitz</hi> and his School the principal; in whose poetry, however, I can find little inspiration; at best some parallel to that of our own Pope; as <hi rend="italic">Hoffmannswaldau</hi><note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Christian Hofmann von Hofmannswaldau (<date when="1617-00-00">1617</date>&#x2013;<date when="1679-00-00">79</date>).</note> and <hi rend="italic">Lohenstein</hi>,<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Daniel Caspar Lohenstein (<date when="1635-00-00">1635</date>&#x2013;<date when="1683-00-00">83</date>).</note> perhaps with far less talent, resemble our Dryden. How this is to be grouped into masses, and presented in full light, I do not yet see clearly: however I must force it all into the Second Volume, and leaving <hi rend="italic">Bodmer</hi><note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Johann Jacob Bodmer (<date when="1698-00-00">1698</date>&#x2013;<date when="1783-00-00">1783</date>), Swiss scholar and critic.</note> and <hi rend="italic">Breitinger</hi><note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Johann Jacob Breitinger (<date when="1701-00-00">1701</date>&#x2013;<date when="1776-00-00">76</date>), Swiss scholar who joined with Bodmer in combatting the influence of Gottsched.</note> to fight out their quarrel with <hi rend="italic">Altvater Gottsched</hi> as they may, be prepared to begin my Third Volume with Lessing and Wieland.</p>
<p>Lessing I could fancy as standing between two Periods; an earnest Sceptic, struggling to work himself into the region of spiritual Truth, and often, from some Pisg<supplied>[ah]</supplied> height, obtaining brave glimpses of that Promised Land. Wieland, with many a Hagedorn, Rabener, Gellert, cooperate, each in their degree;<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Friedrich von Hagedorn (<date when="1708-00-00">1708</date>&#x2013;<date when="1754-00-00">54</date>); Gottlieb Wilhelm Rabener (<date when="1714-00-00">1714</date>&#x2013;<date when="1771-00-00">71</date>); Christian F&#xfc;rchtegott Gellert (<date when="1715-00-00">1715</date>&#x2013;<date when="1769-00-00">69</date>).</note> and so the march proceeds: till under you and Schiller, I should say, a Third grand Period had evolved itself, as yet fairly developed in no other Literature, but full of the richest prospects for all. Namely a period of new Spirituality and Belief, in the midst of old Doubt and Denial; as it were, a new revelation of Nature, and the Freedom and Infinitude of Man, wherein Reverence is again rendered compatible with Knowledge, and Art and Religion are one. This is the Era which chiefly concerns us of England, as of other nations; the rest being chiefly remembrance, but this still present with us. How I am to bring it out will require all consideration. Tho#x2019; the most familiar to me of any other department, I can yet see only that it will fill my last Two Volumes, and to good purpose if I can handle it well; but the divisions, and subordination and coordination of such a multiplicity of objects: the <hi rend="italic">Sorrows of Werther</hi> with the <foreign><hi rend="italic">Kraftm&#xE4;nner</hi></foreign> [Power-men], the <hi rend="italic">Critical Philosophy</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">Xenien</hi> and what not, will occasion no little difficulty; or rather, in the long run, I shall be obliged to stop where means fail, and so <pb id="pg-05-107" n="05:107"/>to leave much unrepresented, and the rest combined in what order it can get into.</p>
<p>By this long description you will see how matters stand with me, and where a helpful word would most profit. Innumerable questions I could ask; for example, about the <hi rend="italic">Xenienkrieg</hi>,<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-05/lt-18300320-TC-JPE-01">TC to JPE, <date when="1830-03-20">20 March</date></ref></note> and your Nicolais<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Christoph Friedrich Nicolan (<date when="1733-00-00">1733</date>&#x2013;<date when="1811-00-00">1811</date>), Berlin writer and bookseller who published a parody of Goethe#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Werther</hi> but whose influence soon waned. He was seen as a representative of the unpoetic Enlightenment, sharply hostile to Hamann, Herder, Kant and Fichte.</note> and other Utilitarians with their fortune among you; which sect, tho#x2019; under a British shape is at this day boisterous enough here; whose downfal<supplied>[l]</supplied>, sure to come by and by, it were pleasant to prophecy. But perhaps some outline of your own general Scheme of German Literary History, and the succession of its epochs, would in the limits we are here confined to, prove most available. It is almost shameful to occupy your time with poor work of mine: otherwise, as I said, no word that you could speak on this matter could be useless.</p>
<p>We expect, not without impatience, that promised Packet, in which so many interesting matters, and kind memorials, are to lie for us. My Wife unites with me in friendliest wishes to you and yours. May the Summer, which is now, after the wild snow-months, opening its blossoms even in these mountains, find you happy, and leave you happy! Friends you will have in many Countries and in many centuries: few men have been permitted to finish such a Task as yours. Believe me ever,</p>

<salute>My Dear Madam,</salute>
<p>Having a vacant hour at present, I may as well devote it to a duty which has long been in waiting; more especially as it is also a real pleasure for me. This is a kind of vacation, or interlude between two fits of scribbling; wherein I am wont to transact all manner of miscellaneous business, from the pruning of trees, and trimming of flower-borders, up to writing letters to my Friends; among whom those of <pb id="pg-05-108" n="05:108"/>Bedford Square, so long as there is any heart or sense left in me cannot be forgotten.</p>
<p>You are too well acquainted with the ways of mankind to fancy that Letters or the want of Letters<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On <date when="1830-05-17">17 May</date> Mrs. Montagu had written to Jane: &#x201C;Our correspondence began as Ladies begin their purses, upon the old foundation of your former friendship with M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlisle [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] and M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Irving&#x2014;upon this, rose round after round, the silken meshes with which you have entangled my heart and my imagination<supplied>[&#x2014;]</supplied> with one jerk, of a faithless hand, you have broken the silken thread which united us, and I am left to consider as I may, the causes of your inconstancy.&#x2014;
<p>&#x201C;To answer to these charges, I summon you to appear in person at my Court 25. Bedford Square, where you shall be kept a close prisoner for one month, at least, never to depart from my custody, but under the controul [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] of your Husband; and accompanied by such guardians as I appoint. D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle entirely approves of this sentence, and M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> &#x26; M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Procter, are most anxious to see you in this durance, moved greatly thereto, by the faithful representations of M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> &#x26; M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Jeffrey who have concealed nothing of your life and conversation.&#x2014;</p>
<p>&#x201C;My dear Thomas Carlyle, bring your Wife here, before you think of going to Germany, we are now to be found, Basil Montagu and myself, and our Children, but a great deal of Sand has run out of our hour glass, and you may return from Germany and find our home desolate&#x2014;Your Brother, who has a sound judgment in all things assents to this determination of mine, which waits only for your approval&#x2014;</p>
<p>&#x201C;On the <date when="1830-09-17">17<hi rend="italic">th</hi> of September</date> we think of leaving Home, if you defer your visit till <date when="1830-08-00">August</date>, I fear the Town will be a desert, come then at <hi rend="italic">once</hi><supplied>[.]</supplied>&#x201D;</p></note> give much insight into the state of our feelings towards each other: one is often so involved among the trivialities and mean prosaic drudgeries of this world, that, even as it were to save our Friends from desecration, we remove their images back out of that vulgar hurlyburly, into some more inward shrine, thinking surely to commune with them in truth and love, were the day of peace come, which however lingers strangely. This, I believe, is wrong; for Friendship, like every other noble thing, must dwell even on the common clay soil of Life, and make its poverty rich; or it will find no dwelling-place. But again, you may be so stranded on some uninhabited shore, as I am here, that your daily Biography belongs not to the world#x2019;s History at all, is even unintelligible to the world, and the loudest incident of your day is when the clock sounds noon or midnight thro#x2019; the wilderness; whereby there seems nothing for you but to &#x2018;<foreign>dree your wierd</foreign>#x2019; [endure your fate] in silence; conversing only with the Earth and the Heavens and the unfathomable Spirit that lives in them; and with your Friends, as if these were already disembodied Souls, dwelling beyond Time and Space, in the mystic Country, which you look to, where indeed both they and you do, in the true sense, actually dwell. But doubtless this too is wrong and we must amend it. The Theologians say that tho#x2019; many a praying person is <pb id="pg-05-109" n="05:109"/>reprobate, no prayerless one is saved; so likewise tho#x2019; many a Letter-writing friend is hollow and worthless, no Letterless one can rightly avail. Better were it to tell you of our Blackbirds singing <foreign>gratis</foreign> every morning and evening; and how our young Swallows are all fledged, and getting ready, poor little things, for their Flight into Egypt; and the Rooks straitened for victual; and how the Trees have not forgotten to bud and blossom, and the Sun to mount out of Aries into Cancer here; better to say anything, which might signify under hand and seal, &#x2018;I have not forgotten you and would fain not be forgotten,#x2019;&#x2014;than altogether to hold my peace. Alas! and the Journey we can travel together is so short: three score and ten milestones, in all, at the most; and the solemn Mansion, with its yews and cypresses, which ends it, is hourly getting nearer! I say, while Days and Sunlight are given us, let this be altered! If I cannot write to you, do you so much the oftener write to me; that friendly salutation, and word of Good-speed, be not wanting between us. Above all, do not think that I can ever forget you, that my remembrance of you will even grow fainter by distance and years: I find, I am one of those that forget nothing; on whose hard heart only <hi rend="italic">Diamonds</hi> will write; but once written, the letters stand there defying all tear and wear.</p>
<p>I meant to send you some outline of our way of life in this solitude, which were a Patmos, only that no Revelation is yet forthcoming: however, I see there will not be space even for the briefest summary. Sometimes it strikes me how like this is to the ideal existence I was wont to dream of, at a very early period of youth, when the folly of mankind began first to annoy me thro#x2019; my own folly: a dwelling-place remote from Green-grocerism of every kind, civic or aristocratic; a little Library; a Life whose sole business was to lie there. Nay I have got far more than my Ideal; namely a Wife, and already some printed sheets of my own on my bookshelves, with obstinate hope of more and better; neither of which blessings did I dare, in those days, to look upon as possible. Thus it is, as a wise man says, &#x2018;what one wishes for in youth, one has in manhood in abundance.#x2019; Am I happy then; is the Nithsdale wold a Heaven on Earth? Some seven years ago I beg<supplied>[a]</supplied>n, after long whipping from my harsh Pedagogue who <hi rend="italic">would</hi> teach me some such lesson, to understand faintly that what we call Happiness on this Planet was the hollowest of all deceptions; nay, properly considered, nothing better than some base promise of a treacle, or plumcake, which only spoiled brats need to be stilled with. Does the true soldier ask what quarters he has, and whether the rations are of marketable quality; or what progress he makes against the <pb id="pg-05-110" n="05:110"/>foe, and whether he is spending his existence for the real sixpence a day, or at some quite infinitely higher rate? On this latter point too, when I investigate it for myself, I have various griefs among my contentments; into neither of which must I introduce you at present. My universal recipe is: &#x201C;Bow thy back to the work, toil while the breath of life is within thee, and think thyself blessed in toiling; other blessedness could I never inquire out.&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle adumbrates the expression of an important doctrine in <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi>.</note> I am compiling <hi rend="italic">Histories of German Literature</hi> at present, and growling and spurning, now and then, at such poor service: but better days are coming; days when I will <hi rend="italic">try</hi> whether there is not something else in me, and learn to be quiet if there is nothing else.</p>
<p>Our Weimar project, which alas is still only a project, you have already heard of. Not the least joyful part of it is the hope of seeing London and you as we pass; which latter hope, with or without the other, shall not always remain unfulfilled. Could I get done with this beggarly Book in time, the rest were all easy: but so much depends on fortune; I have no knack in working; I either write as if I were quenching fire, and myself on fire;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >His favorite symbol for the writing process.</note> or not at all, and lie in cold obstruction,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Measure for Measure</hi>, III, i.</note> sickened by excess in that kind, and am as melancholy as the ghost of a tailor. I have still three whole volumes to write!&#x2014;But, to the work! I begin again on Monday, and tho#x2019; my Pegasus is but a carthorse and spavined, what whipcord can make him do he shall do.</p>
<p>I should have had three sheets, and not one, which is on the point of ending. Will you assure Mr Montague, and assure yourself, how deeply I feel your kindness to my Brother, whose life without you would at present have quite another aspect. You are doubly and a hundredfold Friends, being so in the time of need, which so <hi rend="italic">very</hi> few are. Your own hearts, which have such a noble <hi rend="italic">gift of Prophecy</hi> (the like I have seen nowhere), will reward you. My Mother#x2019;s chief comfort in regard to her wayfarer is in the view you seem to take of him, in the help you so generously offer. I would predict, did it become me, that the man will not altogether disappoint you; for there is much in him, and as the root of all a thankful affectionate heart.&#x2014; But enough for once. Jane salutes you lovingly again. My kind love to Mr &#x26; Mrs P<supplied>[rocter]</supplied>. of whom I hear much good. <closer><salute>Ever affectionately Yours</salute></closer></p>

<dateline><place>Craigenputtoch</place>, Friday Night [<date when="1830-06-04">4 or 11 June 1830</date>].</dateline>
<salute>My Dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I have just learned that Elliott<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Joe Elliott, the hired man at Craigenputtoch.</note> is going off tomorrow morning; so that I have an opportunity of sending down Mag#x2019;s drugs,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The last illness of Carlyle#x2019;s sister Margaret had begun.</note> which I have been keeping with regret these two days. I think you must try a Powder of them tomorrow night, with a little spoonful of <hi rend="italic">Salts</hi> next morning: I am almost sure it will do some good. If so you may without scruple repeat the dose; the operation of the second is easier than that of the first: indeed, I rather incline to think, had some such thing been used months ago, this painful bout of sickness might have been escaped.</p>
<p>I shall look eagerly for Waugh#x2019;s Letter; which, however, I am well aware, may fail to come: nay, if it do come, may fail to throw any clear light on the matter.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle#x2019;s kinsman, Dr. John Waugh, an incompetent physician of Annandale, had been following a downhill path for some years. But he appears to be the best help that could be got at Scotsbrig before Margaret was carried to Dumfries.</note> I am to write to Jack tomorrow,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter not found.</note> and he will perhaps give us a better opinion: if he have any <hi rend="italic">advice</hi> specially for you, he will write direct to Scotsbrig: perhaps about this day week. But for myself, I incline to hope that Doctors will soon be superfluous: Mag was evidently growing fresher: she has still much of her strength, and the Summer weather is all before her. Tell her not to be disheartened; for thousands of people have come thro#x2019; innumerable things with their <hi rend="italic">Bowels</hi>,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Though Froude says that Margaret died of consumption, her disease seems to have been cancer of the digestive organs.</note> the diseases of which are the least dangerous, in proportion to their pain, of any other. They also lie, when one has a certain degree of strength, very much under our own management.</p>
<p>Has Jamie got the Chair ready? That, it appears to me, would be a decided improvement: tell him that it <hi rend="italic">should</hi> and must be done.</p>
<p>I got along very fairly that morning; was in Dumfries at half-past seven, on the road again in an hour, and home before eleven. Nancy<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Thornhill Nancy,&#x201D; the servant.</note> I met just leaving home, and paid her <hi rend="italic">out</hi> her wages. They had had <pb id="pg-05-112" n="05:112"/>a rather <hi rend="italic">dryish</hi> day on Wednesday; but guessed what had detained me. I have had a sleep now, and am no worse for my journey: I hope Jane too has got a sleep in the <hi rend="italic">legal</hi> way; she was very excusable for that oversight; which did me no harm whatever.</p>
<p>The Tax-office was not open as I passed thro#x2019; Dumfries: but I will send down the money with Elliott, and he will deliver you the Receipt from the Tax-man, or at worst return the money. He is also to get you a Sponge (value received) from some Saddler.</p>
<p>They are all well here: Alick, whom I saw two minutes ago, is at his turnips, and the weather good. The Farmer of Sandy-wells has sent up a gig for sale here (at &#xa3;12); but we will not have it: it seems no great bargain, and money is not overflowing.&#x2014; I saw my Uncle John<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Aitken, his mother#x2019;s brother.</note> on the street that morning, and talked with him while the drugs were getting ready: he seemed perfectly well.</p>
<p>Now Jane, or some of you, will be sure to <supplied>[write on]</supplied> Tuesday: mention also how my Father feels himself; if he is not well, I am nearly sure a dose of Castor-oil will recover him. He must keep dry feet, and be careful of his diet.</p>
<p>Take good care of yourself, my dear Mother, and look forward to better times. Right good times, as we would have them, will never come in this world: yet once more, let us trust, we shall all be <hi rend="italic">on our feet</hi> to front the <hi rend="italic">mixture</hi> of good and evil Mother. <closer><salute>With kindest love to all!</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name></p>
<ps><p>I am in some haste, as you may see.&#x2014; I hope to begin writing again on Monday or so.&#x2014; Jack sent a Newspaper.</p></ps>

<salute>My Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I have been very remiss in my duties towards you of late: those friendly assiduities of yours to do me service certainly deserved some more prompt acknowledgement. If I did not acknowledge them in words, the reason was nowise that I did not feel them, but rather the natural laziness of the human mind, fond of the passive far more than of the active voice in all practical verbs; combined with the natural reluctance to write merely &#x2018;Thank you heartily,#x2019; over three whole pages. Nay farther, I had an almost shameful purpose to trouble you again, in the Book way, as you will see, and could not make up my mind about the proper items of the commission. At last, however, I do write, and beg you to understand that your kindness was not altogether thrown away; not even such part of it as testified your zeal rather than your success.</p>
<p>Franz Horn#x2019;s four volumes were and will be very valuable to me, and shall be duly cared for, and returned when their part is played. As for that <hi rend="italic">Ship of Fools</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Reineke the Fox</hi>, I were but a fool myself could I not get thro#x2019; the business without them. Man, as you have sometimes heard hinted, is a creature that adapts means to ends; also, as a certain dyspeptic tailor of my acquaintance was wont to say, <pb id="pg-05-114" n="05:114"/>&#x2018;There are no limits to the mind of man.#x2019; Wherefore we will let those precious volumes lie quietly among their cobwebs; thanking you and Moir for your kind importunity, and nowise resenting the stout Docter#x2019;s adherence to his regulation; for his willingness to oblige me has been often shown; and indeed as matters now stand, so considerable have been my resources and power of contrivance, I would not give much above sixpence to have those two identical Books I was then in such a rage for lying here quietly at my hand.</p>
<p>But now let me specify that other Book commission, and so have done with these matters for once. I am told, <hi rend="italic">Luthers Works</hi> are in the College Library; most probably Walch#x2019;s Edition<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >This edition was in the Library.</note> in some five-and-twenty Quartos, of which the last but one contains his <hi rend="italic">Life</hi>, which <hi rend="italic">Life</hi> if you could procure me, I should like well to see it. Understand, however, that here too I have other resources; and will not on any account put you to the trouble of dancing attendance on Library Clerks and such small deer; but only require this favour of you in case it quite suit your convenience. If so, you might also append Lessing#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Leben</hi> (by his Brother)<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Published in <date when="1793-00-00">1793</date> by Karl G. Lessing.</note> if it is to be had in the Advocates, as, I doubt, it is not, and <hi rend="italic">Lessing#x2019;s Geist</hi> (by Schlegel)<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Friedrich Schlegel, <hi rend="italic">Lessing#x2019;s Geist aus seiner Schriften, oder dessen Gedanken und Meinungen zusammengestellt</hi>, 3 vols. (Leipzig, <date when="1810-00-00">1810</date>).</note> which I know is there. But if difficulties lie in the way, as I said, you are not to stir in the matter at all; but only in place of sending in these Tomes to Mr Aitken, to be so kind as direct him to forward for me what Books or other ware he <hi rend="italic">has</hi>, directly after the London Magazines of this month arrive, if indeed they have not already arrived. And herewith for the present I let you loose, and myself loose, from all commercial and economical concerns, whether librarian or other, and will write three words <foreign><hi rend="italic">de omnibus rebus et quibusdam aliis</hi></foreign> [about everything and something else], as straight from the heart as may be.</p>
<p>And first can you tell me what is become of your friend Moir lately? He was wont to give me frequent signs of his existence and kindness, but with the Northern Circuit he was whisked away into remote regions, and I have seen or heard no more of him. Secondly, which is more to the purpose, can you tell me what has become of your friend Henry Inglis, who also promised to come hither, but never comes, seldom writes, and then only on business and in a hurry? Has he forgot the &#x2018;lodge in some vast wilderness,#x2019;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Cowper, <hi rend="italic">The Task</hi>, II, &#x201C;The Timepiece,&#x201D; l. 1.</note> with Spunkie (vulgo Stumpie), <pb id="pg-05-115" n="05:115"/>the <foreign>Laird</foreign>#x2019;s Craig, and so forth; or is he afraid of lions in wait for him by the way? Seriously, if you cannot let us see your face, and tell us all by the fireside, you ought to write far more copiously, so long as it is not a burden to you. I have set my heart on seeing you &#x2018;one and somewhat,#x2019; simply on this ground that Nature#x2019;s aims should not be frustrated but promoted: neither am I ignorant of the many impediments that obstruct your path in that direction; to forward, to encourage you in which steep path would be a real pleasure to me. Alas! I myself want forwarding<supplied>[,]</supplied> wa<supplied>[nt]</supplied> companionship: it is sad to look all around, and see myself alone, alone: but never mind! is not the Pole-star there (when clouds <supplied>[do]</supplied> not eclipse it), and the whole Heavenly host, to guide one thro#x2019; the desart? Nay better days are coming, and the true worshipper will not always pilgrim towards his Temple without fellow-worshippers of his own time and land. <hi rend="italic">Utilitaria</hi> shall die, it has been written in the book of Doom; <hi rend="italic">Dilettantism</hi>, in spite of all its able Editors, that play with the Highest as if it <hi rend="italic">were</hi> a toy, and the Galaxies and Eternities a thing &#x2018;well got up,#x2019; must be burnt, like a rag as it is, into tinder, whereby contemplative men shall light their pipes, and in quite another mood &#x2018;think and smoke tobacco.#x2019;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Thomas Jenner, <hi rend="italic">The Soules Solace; or Thirtie and one Spirituall Emblems</hi> (<date when="1626-00-00">1626</date>), emblem 31. Cf. also Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi>, p. 16, where the phrase is traced to the refrain of a famous drinking song by George Wither (<date when="1588-00-00">1588</date>&#x2013;<date when="1667-00-00">1667</date>).</note> These things I, <hi rend="italic">not</hi> &#x2018;blown on by the spirit of Prophecy,#x2019;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably an Irvingite reference. Cf. Rev. 19:10.</note> take upon me to predict with perfect confidence, and so go on my way the more quietly. Whether it happen in ten years or in a hundred is no business of mine, who have quite other business, but of the Higher Powers who regulate all that, better than even I could do.</p>
<p>But allow me to descend about a thousand leagues at once, and inquire after the immortal Reddie and his Duel; Peter Nimmo also, on whom I have a Poem, written for you (to be sent by the first free conveyance);<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18211121-TC-AC-01"><sic>1:399</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1821-11-21">21 Nov. 1821</date></corr></ref> and <ref target="volume-03/lt-18240322-TC-JBW-01"><sic>3:51&#x2013;52</sic><corr>TC to JBW, <date when="1824-03-22">22 March 1824</date></corr></ref>.</note> and if you can possibly learn whether the far-famed Willison Glass (of the Cowgate, Poet, and perhaps Laureate) is alive yea or no? Willison, when I saw him fifteen years ago, was a little, greasy, red-snouted, blear-eyed, drunken, deaf individual; and sang in the Anacreontic or Pindaric fashion: but I fear Clotho has cut his valuable thread.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Willison Glass, Scottish poet, author of, among other volumes, <hi rend="italic">The Album; a collection of poems and songs</hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1811-00-00">1811</date>) and editor of <hi rend="italic">The Caledonian Parnassus: a museum of original Scottish Songs</hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1812-00-00">1812</date>).</note></p>
<p>O, I am bleared, and half-blind (with sore eyes), and thirsty, and <pb id="pg-05-116" n="05:116"/>choleric, and all that is bad and unhappy; but still in hopes of eye-water and tea, and a cure for the whole evils of existence; and with or without cure,</p>

<salute>My Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I regret having promised writing to you next day after that sad event, for I now feel how impatient you must have been; and as it turned out, I had no leisure to have written more than a line at the time appointed; neither at Scotsbrig afterwards was there any convenience for such a thing.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In his letter to Carlyle of <date when="1830-06-28">28 June</date> John had said: &#x201C;At the very conclusion of your last letter, after telling me about the termination of our dear sister#x2019;s sufferings, you promised to write on the following day, and yet even now no letter has reached me.&#x201D; The letter which Carlyle wrote to John immediately after Margaret#x2019;s death has not been found.</note> It would have been better to send that same line, however short; more especially as I had engaged for it: but not till yesterday, when we received your Letter, did all this strike me. I thought, the fatal stroke having fallen, the rest was all of little significance. Now, however, I am at home, in my usual quietude; and will write you deliberately; carrying on my narrative with the old minuteness to its final winding up in the still dwelling,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A phrase from <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister#x2019;s Apprenticeship</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XXIV, 154).</note> where she that was dear to us, and will always be dear, now rests.</p>
<p>It was on Monday Night, when Alick took leave of our Sister: on Tuesday, if I remember rightly, she felt &#x2018;better,#x2019; but was evidently fast growing weaker; in the afternoon, it was pretty evident to every one that she was far gone. The Doctor, who was unwearied in his assiduities, formed a worse opinion at every new examination: all hope of a <hi rend="italic">complete</hi> cure had vanished some days before; it now appeared that the whole of the lower bowel was in a state of decay, and the bowels generally as it were already dead. Our Mother asked her in the afternoon if she thought herself dying; she answered: &#x2018;I dinna <foreign>ken</foreign>, <pb id="pg-05-117" n="05:117"/>Mother, but I never was so sick in my life.#x2019; To a subsequent question about her hopes of a future world, she replied briefly but in terms that were comfortable to her parent. It was about eight at night, when John Currie<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably the nephew of Carlyle#x2019;s mother.</note> was despatched to go and seek a horse, and proceed hither, where as you already know he arrived about midnight: by this time the sick-room was filled with sympathizing relatives, the Minister (Mr Clyde)<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Rev. James Clyde was, with the Rev. William Inglis, joint minister of the First United Secession Chapel in Lowerburn St., Dumfries.</note> also came and feelingly addressed her: she recognized every one; was calm, clear, as she ever had been; sometimes spoke, in whispers, directing little services to be done for her; once asked where Mary was, who had gone out for a moment. Twice she asked for the &#x2018;drops#x2019; (I believe, that <hi rend="italic">quina</hi> mixture I spoke of): the first time, our Mother, who now cared chiefly for her Soul#x2019;s <foreign>weal</foreign>, and that sense and recollection might be given her in that stern hour, answered dissuasively, but said if she asked them a second time they should be given her. Some hours before, our Mother had begged her forgiveness if she had ever done her anything wrong; to which the dying one answered: &#x2018;Oh no, no, Mother, never, never,#x2019; earnestly, yet quietly and without tears. About a quarter past ten, she asked again for the &#x2018;drink#x2019; (or drops, which were taken in water), and took the glass, which Mary also held, in her own hand: she whispered to Mary, &#x2018;pour up#x2019;; swallowed about half the liquid; threw her head on the pillow, looking out with her usual look; but her eyes quickly grew bright and intense, the breath broke into long sighs, and in about two minutes, a slight quiver in the under lip gave token that the fight was fought, and the wearied spirit at its goal.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Margaret, born <date when="1803-09-20">20 Sept. 1803</date>, died <date when="1830-06-22">22 June 1830</date>. She was buried on Saturday, <date when="1830-06-26">26 June</date>.</note> I saw her in the winding-sheet, about six o#x2019;clock; beautiful in death, and kissed her pale brow, not without warm tears which I could not check: about midday when she was laid in the coffin I saw her face once more&#x2014;for the last time.</p>
<p>Our Mother behaved in what I must call a heroic manner. Seeing that the hour was now come, she cast herself and her child on God#x2019;s hand, and endeavoured heartily to say: His will be done. Since then she has been calmer than any of us could have hoped; almost the calmest of us. No doubt the arrow still sticks in her heart, and natural sorrow must have its course; but, I trust, she seeks and finds the only true balm, howsoever named, by which man#x2019;s woe can be healed and made blessed to him.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-05-118" n="05:118"/>Thus, dear Brother, has our eldest and best Sister been taken from us; mercifully as you said, tho#x2019; sorrowfully; having been spared much suffering, and carried in clear possession of her sense and steadfastness thro#x2019; that last solemn trial. We all wept sore for her, as you have done, and now do; but will endeavour to weep no more. I have often thought, she had attained all in Life that Life could give her: a just, true, meekly invincible, completed character; which I, and so many others, by far more ambitious paths seek for in vain. She was, in some points, I may say deliberately, superior to any woman I have ever seen: her simple clearness of head and heart, her perfect fairness, and quiet, unpretending, brief decisiveness, in thought, word, and act, for in all these she was remarkable, made up so true and brave a spirit as, in that unaffected guise, we shall hardly look upon again. She might have been wife to a Scottish Martyr, and spoken stern truths to the ear of Tyrants, had she been called to that work: as it is, she sleeps in a pure grave; and our peasant maiden, to us who knew her, is more than King#x2019;s daughters. Let us forever remember her, and love her; but cease from henceforth to mourn for her. She was mercifully dealt with; called away when her heart, if not unwounded, was yet unseared and fresh; amid pain and heaviness, it is true, yet not in any agony, or without some peaceful beam of Hope enlightening her to the end. The little current of her existence flowed onwards, like a Scottish brook, thro#x2019; green simple fields; neither was it caught into the Great Ocean over chasms and grim cataracts; but gently, and as among thick cl<supplied>[oud]</supplied> whereon hovered a rainbow.&#x2014;</p>
<p>I might tell you something of the funeral arrangements; and how the loss has left the rest of us. Early on Tuesday, our Mother and Mary set off for Scotsbrig,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Margaret had died at Dumfries.</note> in one of Alick#x2019;s Carts, which happened to be there: a coffin was speedily got ready, with burial Letters &#x26;c;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Registration of Margaret#x2019;s death with the local Session Clerk.</note> and it was soon agreed that Alick and I should attend the body down to Scotsbrig next day, where it was to lie till Saturday the day of the funeral. All Wednesday these things kept him and me incessantly busy: the poor Alick was sick to the heart, and cried more, that day, than I had ever seen him do in his life<supplied>[.]</supplied> At night I had to return hither, and seek Jenny. I was the messenger of heavy and unexpected tidings. Jane too insisted on going with us. So next morning (Thursday) we set out hence: Jenny and I in a gig, Jane riding behind us. At Dumfries, where Alick had remained to watch all night, we found Jacob with a Hearse; about two o#x2019;clock we moved off: the gig close <pb id="pg-05-119" n="05:119"/>following the Hearse, Jane and Alick riding behind us. We reached Scotsbrig about six. Carts went and came between this and Scotsbrig (with clothes &#x26;c &#x26;c) almost every day. Poor Robert Clow<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The intended husband of Margaret Carlyle. He was a cousin of Janet Clow, who married Alexander Carlyle this year.</note> was dreadfully affected: he waked <hi rend="italic">every</hi> night; spoke earnestly and largely on the subject of the deceased; and by his honest sensibility, and pure sincere religious bearing, endeared himself to every one. On Saturday about half past one, the procession moved away: our Mother stood like a priestess in the door, tearless where all were weeping. Our Father and Alick went in the gig: the former, ill in health, looked resolute, austere, and to trivial condolers and advisers almost indignant. The Coffin was lowered into a very deep grave (secured otherwise also against disturbance) on the <hi rend="italic">east</hi> side of our Headstone in the Ecclefechan Churchyard; and the mourners, a numerous company, among whom were our uncle John and others from Dumfries, separated; W. Graham and a few others accompanying us home to that stupid horrid ceremony a funeral tea, which however in our case was very speedily and quietly transacted.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning we set out on our return. It had been settled that Mary was to stay yonder for a fortnight or ten days, our Mother &#x26; Jenny to come hither: I drove the former in the gig, Jenny came in the cart with Bretton. We settled various accounts &#x26;c at Dumfries, were kindly entertained by John,<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Aitken, Carlyle#x2019;s uncle.</note> and arrived here about eleven, all well. Mother had a good sleep, and is pretty well in health, her slight cough having almost left her. She expects to hear from you: in the end of next week she talked of returning to the <hi rend="italic">Sacrament</hi>.<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sacrament of Holy Communion, traditionally celebrated only once or twice a year in Secession Churches.</note> Our Father was complaining much, and evidently suffering somewhat severely: his appetite is very bad; he has a cold, coughs a little, and is in very bad spirits when left to himself. I brought him some paregoric, and his cough seemed to be troubling him little, but he was breathless, dispirited, and could not eat. We hope, the good weather will mend him, would it come. The rest of us <supplied>[are]</supplied> well.&#x2014; <closer><salute>God bless you dear Brother!</salute></closer> <name>T.

It was on a Tuesday night, about 20 minutes past ten. Alick and I were roused by express about midnight, and we arrived there about four. That solstice night with its singing birds and sad thoughts I shall never forget. She was interred next Saturday at Ecclefechan. I reckoned her the best of all my sisters,&#x2014;in some respects the best woman I had ever seen. Fain would I have saved her, but it was not to be.&#x2014;<lb/><lb/>

<salute>My Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Your Letter is just come; and having an opportunity tomorrow, I write in great haste to say more explicitly what I am sorry you have not understood already, that <hi rend="italic">there is no necessity for your coming <pb id="pg-05-121" n="05:121"/>home at present;</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John had asked in his letter postmarked <date when="1830-07-12">12 July</date>: &#x201C;Is there any necessity for my coming home at present? If not I shall take Lodgings &#x26; commence practice forthwith&#x2014;as all my friends here are urging me to do.&#x201D;</note> the only case you could have done any special service in being now quite taken out of our hands. Go forth then, take Lodgings, and commence instantly like a man.</p>
<p>Our Mother went home on Friday, with Alick, and got your Letter next day. You must write her a longer one next time; and begin <hi rend="italic">in time</hi>. I am very sorry for her, poor Mother: she is sickly in body as usual, and will long, long be sick at heart. I am to see her again, when I have got a little work done. Our Father has cured his cough by paregoric and time; but still complains that he cannot eat and has no strength except to sit about the fire and read. I think, the disease lies chiefly in his spirits, rendered dull and despondent by a decay of the digestive faculty. He is but an impatient patient, as you know; were he worse he would perhaps be better. On the whole, however, he is much fallen off at present;&#x2014;not so much <hi rend="italic">thin</hi> as <hi rend="italic">loose</hi> in flesh; and never till this summer has been an old man. One knows not what to fear: but I still think there is no danger of him for a long time. Worthy old man, with all his <hi rend="italic">fractious</hi> habits! The noblest statue still encircled in this extraneous marble! Let us trust that he will long be spared us.</p>
<p>We are all sad and dull about her that is laid in the Earth: I dream of her almost nightly, and feel not indeed sorrow, for what is Life but a continual Dying?&#x2014;yet a strange obstruction, and haunting remembrance. Let us banish all this; for it is profitless and foolish:</p>
<lg><l>Thy quiet goodness, spirit pure and brave</l>
<l>What boots it now with tears to tell?</l>
<l>The path to Rest lies thro#x2019; the Grave:</l>
<l>Loved Sister, take our long Farewell!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Original verse by Carlyle. For an earlier version with revisions, see <hi rend="italic">Two Note Books</hi>, p. 157.</note></l></lg>
<p>We shall meet again too, if God will: if he will <hi rend="italic">not</hi>, then better we should not meet. Enough of this.</p>
<p>Mr Fraser and the Whittakers have done me, heedlessly enough, considerable mischief. Of the former I think and can think nothing but well; only he shall have as little more to do as possible with my affairs: for the last ten months, I have been driven out of all true reckoning, and kept in the paltriest embarrassment.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For Carlyle#x2019;s previous dealings with William Fraser and the Messrs. Whittaker, see <ref target="volume-05/lt-18291221-TC-DA-01">TC to DA, <date when="1829-12-21">21 Dec. 1829</date></ref>. John had also written in his last letter: &#x201C;Mr Fraser is busy as any man can be. You will be surprised to hear that he is engaged in canvassing, and is almost sure of being &#x2018;returned#x2019; a member of P<hi rend="italic">t</hi>. The Whittakers he has seen twice or thrice since your letter came altho#x2019; he has been mostly out of town since he received it. They have not come to any determination when they will be able to publish the Germ. Lit. History. I think they are <supplied>[a]</supplied> set of <supplied>[as]</supplied> poor fellows as can be, and perhaps the best way after all will be to cut them at once. I am to breakfast with M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Fraser on thursday next and you may depend upon hearing the final result of this very annoying delay. It is a great pity that any honest man should have ought to do with such persons as Whittaker &#x26; Co. I am sorry for Mr Fraser who feels himself implicated in this affair, though he is not at all to blame. &#x2026; It seems to me you may very likely be able to sell the M.S. for a larger sum than Whittaker has promised. I expect to hear from you.&#x201D; John wrote too: &#x201C;Mr Irvings little son Samuel died on Monday last.&#x201D;</note></p>
<p><pb id="pg-05-122" n="05:122"/>I agree with you that it will be good to take that Book out of his and their hands; and have the pleasure at least of wrapping string about it, and laying it in one<supplied>[#x2019;]</supplied>s drawer. One or two other openings there are, which I will previously try. Pray desire Mr F. to take no farther trouble or concern with the matter; but to give you the Manuscript; which do you lock carefully up, till farther notice. I write off to a new merchant about it this very night; for which reason also I must write no more to you.&#x2014;</p>
<p>This is a dreadful season with wind, wet and cold; and for the poor has a most threatening aspect. There is a North-East thundering against this chimney-top (the dining-room, for Jane is gone to Templand, and I am quite alone), and battering on windows and sky-lights&#x2014;that might do honour to December.&#x2014; Here, however, we have grass in plenty, and a promise of crop far above the average; the soil being dry.</p>
<p>Many thanks for your punctuality in regard to the Newspaper, which <hi rend="italic">never</hi> disappoints us. Thanks also for your news electioneering and other: only why have we not four times as much. The whole household begs you to write <hi rend="italic">on Sunday</hi>, or even Saturday, and fill your sheet. We are in the dark about much. Yet grateful for the smallest glimmering. Therefore rather write in fractions than forbear or even delay.&#x2014; Alas! it is half past Eleven and I have still a business letter to write (about that Book!);<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >This letter, if Carlyle wrote it, has not been found. On <date when="1830-07-24">24 July</date> Carlyle wrote to Tait, the Edinburgh bookseller, to propose the publication of the MS of his history of German literature.</note> about which I will tell you all if it come to anything&#x2014;or nothing and I had time. I care scarcely three farthings about this or aught earthly: but will travel on so long as I have legs, let the ways be dry or muddy, the entertainment for man and horse good, indifferent, or bad.</p>

<salute>My Dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Had I not partly promised to Jamie that I would write tonight, I should hardly have taken up the pen at present; for it is late, and my daily Task is far from done; as I have been very stupid today, and plagued with a dirty little rheumatism in one of my shoulders. However, I should tell you that this is one of my <hi rend="italic">worse</hi> sort of days: in general, I get thro#x2019; my required number of pages handsomely enough; am in better health than when you saw me; and on the whole have reason rather to be thankful than to complain.</p>
<p>I hope, if this poor scrawl do no other good, it may induce Jane, or some other of you, to write me a line about your own condition; especially how my Father and you are. We feel somewhat uneasy <pb id="pg-05-124" n="05:124"/>about my Father, especially as he seems so disheartened himself. It seems his cough is about gone, yet he is little better. I hope it is nothing more than a weakness of digestion, which is bad enough, but not dangerous: I and you know by sad experience how dispiriting it is. Very probably his common mode of diet, so much on milk and the like, may be against him; animal food, fresh soups, eggs &#x26;c are in general far wholesomer: I think also, a little brandy and water, especially before meals, would have a good chance to help him. Would the weather but mend too! But it is still wet and threatening: such a day as last Saturday I have scarcely seen in any July.</p>
<p>I enclose you a short rag of a Letter from Jack: I have reproved him for his hurried brevity to you and to me; and hope he will amend in that particular. When I hear next from him, I will take the first chance of letting you know. As to that delay in the printing of my Book, I care nothing about it; I have already written to the man Gleig,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >G. R. Gleig.</note> to see if he will purchase the article from me; and will write to one or two others if need be; being minded, unless Fraser<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Fraser, who had sought publication through the Whittakers.</note> instantly bestir him and get on with printing, to take it out of <hi rend="italic">his</hi> hands altogether, tho#x2019; I should lay it by here in my drawer, and not publish it at all.

<salute>My Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Several years ago I engaged that the first Book I had to publish, you should have the offer of it; which promise, or threat, I have now, unexpectedly enough, opportunity of fulfilling.</p>
<p>The Messrs Whittaker#x2019;s grand scheme of a &#x2018;Series of Literary Histories,#x2019; in which I, after the time I saw you last, and on better terms than had then been held out, was engaged to cooperate, had fallen into such a state of stagnation, the Editor<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Fraser.</note> having even taken into electioneering, that I have altogether withdrawn from the concern; recalled my Manuscript from the Ave Maria Lane<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The address of the Whittakers.</note> premises; lit my pipe (or will do so) with their Letter of engagement; and determined to publish the &#x2018;History of German Literature,#x2019; first enlarging it about one half, on my own foundation.</p>
<p>In this new state, the Book will consist of Four Volumes, each containing about 150 pages of Edinburgh-Review Letterpress; or it might be arranged in Three Volumes; or any way, for it is in Chapters and can be split up as we please. One volume is finished; the Second more than half-finished: the other two I will write before rising. It has cost me an immensity of trouble; I am anxious beyond measure to have <supplied>[it]</supplied> fairly off my hands, and as <hi rend="italic">soon</hi> as may be. I reckon it an indifferent kind of Book, honestly enough written; combining Philosophy with popular Lightness, abundance of Facts with logical arrangement, as well as I could manage. Whether it is likely to be wanted in the market at this time; especially, whether it would lie in your way, how much it would be worth to you in that case, when you could publish it, and so forth; these are all questions which I now propose for your consideration, and beg for an answer to, by your earliest convenience. <pb id="pg-05-126" n="05:126"/>Deliver a Negative, with perfect freedom, if that be your mind; for I should grieve much to involve you in any losing speculation; and the Book, which I will finish, go as it may, can lie in my drawer here, and need no board wages.</p>
<p>Neither, on the other hand, must I hide from you, that at this moment, I could not make a bargain with you straightfoward; not till I have discussed another claim and negociation on the same subject from an Editorial Gentleman in the South;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >G. R. Gleig.</note> whom, however, I expect to hear from in a few days. I will say farther that my past experience of your punctuality and integrity, will induce me, whatever offer <hi rend="italic">he</hi> may make, to give your offer a very considerable additional weight in my comparison.&#x2014; This, it appears to me, is the whole history of the matter as it yet stands; to which let me again beg your attention and speedy answer.</p>
<p>I am in great haste tonight; otherwise I would have thanked you for the welcome volumes you lent me and gave me long ago: they are all safe here, and read, and will be returned, such of them as are to return, by the first parcel I send to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, which duty, for it is now becoming such, I mean to do soon.</p>
<p>Another project of publication I give you to consider at your leisure: a reprinting namely of the principal things I have written in the Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> and Foreign Reviews; remodelled, added to &#x26;c, and hammered into a sort of unity, whereby they might stand together in some volume, or two volumes, under a common Title, and without blushing for one another. I have this project also from London; but had much rather do it myself in Edinburgh: however, as I said, it can wait: it is only the other that presses for execution.</p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Several months ago, I was honoured with a Letter from you, requesting Contributions for your Magazine; which request if I have delayed answering directly till now, the reason was simply that I had nothing in readiness to send, and thought it better to wait till I had some leisure and produce than trouble you with so barren a message. The first two Numbers of your Magazine, for which I have to thank you, satisfied me that it was a likely enough enterprize; containing, with several excrescences, a great deal of what was really good and worthy. Understanding you to be animated with the same spirit still, I rejoice to hear of your success; and shall be ready as occasion serves, to send you any litle thing I have got, if it can be of use to you.</p>

<salute>My Dear Jack,</salute>
<p>These last two Wednesdays I expected to hear from you, as perhaps on the corresponding Saturdays you did from me; so it seems better to have no more shying in the matter, but that I should write forthwith; especially as this Letter may still reach you on Monday, and so find the London one not yet started from its moorings.</p>
<p>I sympathize in your reluctance to enter on the practice of Medicine, or indeed of any Professional Duty; well understanding the difficulties that lie at the porch of all, and threaten the solitary adventurer. Neither can I be surprised at your hankering after a Literary Life, so congenial as I have often heard you hint it would be to your tastes.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John had written on <date when="1830-07-19">19 July</date>: &#x201C;London is the only place that can suit me in my present circumstances; for it would be foolish to calculate upon much practice the first year or two, and I must live by scribbling in some way or other. This can be done in London without scandal of any sort, and with credit. I need not conceal from you that I would rather not practice at all if I could find any other honest way of gaining a livelihood. I love quiet and to enjoy it would put up with small things. The idea of becoming a great physician &#x26; living in splendour cannot seize me with any force, for I see through the vanity of it all.</note> Nevertheless, it <hi rend="italic">would</hi> greatly astonish me, if beyond mere preliminary reveries, these feelings produced any influence on your conduct. The voice of all Experience seems to be in favour of a Profession: you sail there, as under convoy, in the middle of a fleet, and have a thousandfold chance of reaching port. Neither is it Happy Islands and Halcyon Seas alone that you miss; for Literature is <pb id="pg-05-129" n="05:129"/>thickly strowed with cold Russian Nova Zemblas,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Novaya Zemlya, a large island north of Russia in the Arctic Ocean. Cf. <ref target="volume-02/lt-18230204-TC-JBW-01"><sic>2:283</sic><corr>TC to JBW, <date when="1823-02-04">4 Feb. 1823</date></corr></ref>.</note> where you shiver and despair in loneliness; nay often, as in the case of this <hi rend="italic">Literary History of Germany,</hi> you anchor on some slumbering whale, and it ducks under and leaves you spinning in the eddies.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Works,</hi> XXVII, 58, and the account of Leviathan in <hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost,</hi> I, 200&#x2013;7. Cf. also the story of Sinbad the Sailor in the <hi rend="italic">Arabian Nights,</hi> Chamisso#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Peter Schlemihls wundersame Geschichte</hi> (<date when="1814-00-00">1814</date>), and &#x201C;The Whale&#x201D; in the medieval bestiary. For the last-named see Jessie L. Weston, <hi rend="italic">The Chief Middle English Poets</hi> (Boston, <date when="1914-00-00">1914</date>), p. 331.</note> To my own mind nothing justifies me for having adopted the trade of Literature, except the remembrance that I had no other, except these two that of a schoolmaster or of a Priest, in the one case with the fair prospect of speedy maceration and starvation, in the other, of perjury which is infinitely worse. As it is, I look confidently forward to a life of poverty, toil, and dispiritment, so long as I remain on this Earth, and hope only that God will grant me patience and strength to struggle onwards thro#x2019; the midst of it, working out His will, as I best can, in this lonely claypit where I am set to dig. The pitifullest of all resources is complaining, which accordingly I strive not to practice: only let these things be known for my Brother#x2019;s warning, that he may order his Life better than I could do mine. For the rest, I pretend not to thwart your own judgement, which ought to be mature enough for much deeper considerations; neither would I check these overflowings of discouragement, poured as they naturally should be, into a Brother#x2019;s ear; but after all that is come and gone, I expect to learn that your Medical Talent, sought over all Europe, and indisputably the most honourable a man can have, is no longer to be hidden in a napkin, still less to be thrown away into the lumber-room, but to come forth into the light of day, for your own profit and that of your fellow men.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle has in mind the parable of the talents, Matt. 25:14&#x2013;30. Cf. Luke 19:20.</note></p>
<p>Tell me, therefore, dear Jack, that you are in your own Lodging; resolute, compacted, girt for the fight; at least endeavouring to do your true duty. Now, as ever, I have predicted that success was certain for you; my sole fear is that such wavering, and waiting at the pool, may in the end settle into a habit of fluctuation and irresolution, far enough from your natural character; a fear which, of course, every new week spent in drifting to and fro, tends to strengthen. I think, your scale of expences accurate and moderate; neither is there much difficulty, connected as you are, in finding means to meet it: Montague#x2019;s Translating <pb id="pg-05-130" n="05:130"/>and Index-making is indeed drudgery, and goes against the grain; meantime be thankful that you have such an outlook. The Foreign Quarterly Review, the Edinburgh, all manner of other vehicles are open for your speculation when you are in humour for that kind of effort, which however should not be too often made, or it produces the saddest of all exhaustion.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John had written: &#x201C;Montague offers me two guineas a week if I will devote some hours each day to translating Bacon#x2019;s Latin tracts &#x26;c. and making indices &#x26;c. which I find is fearful drudgery, yet not to be altogether rejected but kept for <supplied>[a]</supplied> last shift&#x201D;; he adds that he has been encouraged to write for <hi rend="italic">Fraser#x2019;s Magazine</hi>. There also existed the possibility, he noted, that he might contribute to the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review</hi> and to the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Quarterly Review</hi>.</note> Above all, fear nothing, Jack! Men are but poor spindle-shanked, wiffling <hi rend="italic">wonners</hi> [wonders (in a derogatory sense)] when you clutch them thro#x2019; the mass of <hi rend="italic">drapery</hi> they wear; to throw twenty of them over the house-ridge were no such feat for a right fellow: neither is their favour, their envy, admiration, or anything the poor devils can give or withhold, our life or our death: nay, the worst we and they fear is but a bugbear, a hollow shadow which if you grasp it and smite it, dissolves into air. March boldly up to it and to them; strong and still; like the Stars, <foreign><hi rend="italic">ohne Hast doch ohne Rast</hi></foreign> [without haste but without rest]!<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >From Goethe.

<l>Nor they can overpower us.</l></lg></note> Up and be doing! Be my Brother and Life-Companion not in word and feeling only but in deepest deed!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I must break off here into something more practical. Of our situation here and at Scotsbrig there is little to be said at present: we are all as we were; our Father too, so far as accounts go yesterday, is neither better nor worse; still languid and dejected, without any appearance of great bodily suffering or even excessive weakness; our Mother and the rest not complaining. I am to be down ere long, and will tell you <pb id="pg-05-131" n="05:131"/>better. But for the present I have a whole load of commissions to try your patience with, and must turn thither.</p>
<p>First with regard to the <hi rend="italic">Bridgewater,</hi> Inddia-ship [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>], I have engaged to the Stroquhan people (who are living in trembling hope and fear about the fate of their Brother and his whole family embarked therein) that you will get the best information, which is to be had in London, about the <hi rend="italic">real chances</hi> of safety or destruction for this ship:<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mrs. Anderson and her daughter of Stroquhan, a farm between Craigenputtoch and Dunscore, were deeply concerned over the fate of their son and brother on the ship.</note> I believe, it sailed from Penang, of which place the Governor also was in it, and a son (or perhaps this was he) of the India Directors#x2019; chairman; it was seen last in the straits of Sunda, and must either have perished or taken refuge in Bombay. Many of your friends will be able to put you on the right track for inquiry; at Lloyds, or at the India-house, or elsewhere: Strachey, for instance: and if you knew the state of frightful suspense in which Miss Anderson and her poor old sick Mother are, you would not be angry at me for giving you this trouble, or grudge any effort to help them in their distress.</p>
<p>Secondly, with regard to that Fraserio-Whittakerian Manuscript of the <hi rend="italic">Lit. Hist. of Germany,</hi> get it out of their claws, if you have not, as I trust, already done so; to which now add an <hi rend="italic">Article on Schiller</hi> that Fraser has, that he talked of giving to some Magazine or other, but that I desire to have the privilege of giving or retaining myself; being minded, as I said already, to have no more business transactions with that gentleman.<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John had written: &#x201C;I think you are right to have little more to do with W. Frazer in the way of literary negociations, for with the best purposes in the world he is the most unhappy of men in the execution of every thing he undertakes.&#x2014; I shall get the MS tomorrow.&#x201D;</note> Get the <hi rend="italic">two manuscripts</hi> therefore, dear Jack, and wrap them up tightly till I send for them. The <hi rend="italic">Schiller</hi> by and by I intend for the Foreign Q. Review: about the <hi rend="italic">History</hi> I wrote to Gleig<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >G. R. Gleig.</note> (Colburn#x2019;s Editor of some <hi rend="italic">Library of General Knowledge</hi>) three weeks ago: and again today, having received no answer: Fraser offered to negociate for me there in a Letter he sent last week, but he need not mingle farther in the matter, I think.

<salute>My Dear Jack,&#x2014;</salute>
<p>Since the inclosed Letter was finished, I have somewhat extended my schemes, and altered its conveyance. I have, at your suggestion, <hi rend="italic">sent</hi> that miserable dud of <hi rend="italic">&#x2018;Cruthers and Johnson,#x2019;</hi> to Fraser, with two other Papers: certain abstruse &#x2018;Thoughts on History,#x2019; and a small scantling of my Fables and Rhymes (or rather one Rhyme: &#x2018;What is Hope#x2019;):<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Cui Bono,&#x201D; in <hi rend="italic">Works,</hi> XXVI, 470&#x2013;71.</note> you are to correct the Proofs if there be any printing: &#x2018;Cruthers and Johnson#x2019; is to be <hi rend="italic">forthwith</hi> returned to you, if found unsuitable; and the <hi rend="italic">name</hi> in any case kept <hi rend="italic">strictly</hi> secret. Lastly, I have told the man to deliver you the Payment (if any) for that <hi rend="italic">Jean-Paul#x2019;sche Recension;</hi> and if possible to let you have your Letter on Monday before Post time.&#x2014; This is all that I have done, and you can forward it if you have any opportunity. If not, prithee kind Doctor, do not value it one pin#x2019;s point: I can do whether they print my trash in their Magazine or not, and what they and all men may think of it there or elsewhere.&#x2014; Of course I mean <hi rend="small-caps">Magazine Fraser</hi>!&#x2014; Get my Schiller from the other, and I have done with him.</p>
<p>Having a little scrap of room here, I will put down a word or two of news for you. We have got a Gig here (bought, not paid, at &#xa3;10 between Alick and me); a fine stout, substaintial [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] oldfashioned, bottle-green vehicle, as ugly, as light and as sure, as Philosopher could desire it. The large beast Madge runs in it marvellously: so does Larry <pb id="pg-05-133" n="05:133"/>for Alick &#x26; Mary, who keep no other riding-horse; Jane goes down in it tomorrow to Dumfries with Bretton. This is a kind of innovation for us.</p>
<p>Secondly the Jeffreys are coming hither in the end of <date when="1830-08-00">August</date>. Farther, we are <hi rend="italic">threatened</hi> with Sandy Donaldson;<note n="15" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Welshes#x2019; lawyer at Haddington.</note> also with Robert Welsh<note n="16" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jane#x2019;s uncle.</note> and &#x2018;a Friend,#x2019; tho only to breakfast. Henry Inglis too<note n="17" place="bottom" type="gloss" >(<date when="1806-00-00">1806</date>&#x2013;<date when="1886-00-00">86</date>), Edinburgh lawyer who befriended the Carlyles in Edinburgh.</note>&#x2014;whose father is dead at Havre, and who himself is gone to Paris &#x2018;to see the Revolution.#x2019; Visiters [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] enough with a blessing!&#x2014; Jeffrey is the only sound-hearted well-intentioned visiter among them: poor Henry means well, but there is a law in his members; he still hovers between Death and Life.</p>
<p>Thirdly we have had three Letters from Goethe, the first and most important of which I send you a copy of, made many months ago for you; the contents of which will not fail to surprise you. That Craigenputtoch should be <hi rend="italic">engraved</hi> in Weimar! The next Letter, however, told us that the Publication of <hi rend="italic">Schiller</hi> had been put off for some time that the <foreign><hi rend="italic">geschm&#xfc;ckte Exemplar</hi></foreign> [illustrated copy] would not come with the first Box but soon afterwards, with the <foreign><hi rend="italic">Lieferungen</hi></foreign> [serial parts] of his <hi rend="italic">Werke</hi> [<hi rend="italic">Works</hi>]. That promised First Box came actually; contained strange things, Goethe#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Farbenlehre</hi> [<hi rend="italic">Science of Color</hi>], the remaining <hi rend="italic">Proofs</hi> of <hi rend="italic">Schiller</hi>, two Pictures of Goethe#x2019;s Houses, the <foreign>Gartenhaus</foreign> and <foreign>Haus</foreign> in Weimar. This was a fortnight ago. So that <hi rend="small-caps">the</hi> <hi rend="italic">Exemplar</hi> is soon to be looked for, with the <hi rend="italic">indiscreet</hi> preface, the views of Craigenputtoch, and of Schiller#x2019;s <foreign><hi rend="italic">Wohnung</hi></foreign> <hi rend="italic">in Weimar</hi> [dwelling in Weimar], and of his little <foreign><hi rend="italic">Gartenhaus</hi></foreign> <hi rend="italic">in Jena,</hi> for they are all to be there. Why, this is voonders upon voonders!</p>
<p>Lastly, there came that same night, a Parcel of Books from Paris (<hi rend="italic">how</hi>, except that they were last at Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, I cannot guess) and a Letter addressed to the writer of the <foreign><hi rend="italic">Caract&#xE8;re de notre &#xE9;poque</hi></foreign> (&#x201C;Signs of the Times&#x201D;)<note n="18" place="bottom" type="gloss" >From Gustave d#x2019;Eichthal. The date on the MS in the NLS is &#x201C;<date when="1830-04-29">29 Avril 1830</date>,&#x201D; but the date on d#x2019;Eichthal#x2019;s draft (MS, Biblioth&#xE8;que de L#x2019;Arsenal) is &#x201C;<date when="1830-07-00">Juillet 1830</date>&#x201D; as in the published text in the <hi rend="italic">Revue Historique,</hi> LXXXII (<date when="1903-00-00">1903</date>), 292. But this is in the hand of Gustave#x2019;s son Eug&#xE8;ne, and &#x201C;<date when="1830-04-29">29 Avril</date>&#x201D; should stand, showing how long it took the parcel to be sent on.</note> <foreign><hi rend="italic">dans la R&#xE9;vue d#x2019;Edinbourg,</hi></foreign> from the strangest of all Societies, the <hi rend="italic">Societ&#xE9; St-Simonienne</hi> (or Disciples of St Simon who are founding a New Religion there at present <supplied>[)]</supplied>.

<pb id="pg-05-134" n="05:134"/><dateline>(No 4)</dateline>
<p>You will never be able to make out all these scraps, which tho#x2019;, it is late now, I have great pleasure in scribbling.&#x2014; Do not neglect to write duly and long and frankly. We are very poor, as I said, at present; but that is <hi rend="italic">all,</hi> and we will get over that. Fear nothing: we mean nothing but honest things, and must and will prosper in them, seeing the very effort is success.</p>

<salute>My Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Some three weeks ago, a packet of Books arrived here, accompanied with a Letter addressed <foreign><hi rend="italic">A l#x2019;Auteur de l#x2019;Article intitul&#xE9;, Caract&#xE8;re de notre Epoque,</hi></foreign> the whole perfectly uninjured, the Books complete <pb id="pg-05-135" n="05:135"/>according to the List sent with them.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >D#x2019;Eichthal had sent the following works, accounted for in his letter, which he suggested should be read in the order given. All but the first are in the NLS: L.C. 2275, bound up for Carlyle with other works on &#x201C;Saint Simonisme&#x201D; under that title on the spine: (i) some numbers of the weekly periodical <hi rend="italic">L#x2019;Organisateur</hi> (Paris, <date when="1829-08-00">Aug. 1829</date>&#x2013;<date when="1831-08-00">Aug. 1831</date>), certainly including the two numbers to which d#x2019;Eichthal especially drew Carlyle#x2019;s attention, i.e., nos. 32 and 36 containing P. M. Laurent#x2019;s critique of Carlyle#x2019;s &#x201C;Signs of the Times,&#x201D; and no. 36 with a &#x201C;<foreign>Note Explicative</foreign>&#x201D; on Saint-Simon#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Nouveau Christianisme;</hi> (ii) the latter work itself (Paris, <date when="1825-00-00">1825</date>) which Carlyle was to translate; (iii) the same author#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">L#x2019;Industrie, ou discussions politiques, morales et philosophiques</hi> (Paris, <date when="1818-00-00">1818</date>) tome quatri&#xE8;me, premier cahier; (iv) <hi rend="italic">Le Producteur, journal philosophique de l#x2019;industrie, des sciences et des beaux-arts</hi> (Paris, <date when="1826-10-00">Oct. 1826</date>), tome cinqui&#xE8;me, premier cahier, containing articles by certain authors to whom d#x2019;Eichthal also drew Carlyle#x2019;s attention; (v) Eug&#xE8;ne Rodrigues#x2019; translation of G. E. Lessing, <hi rend="italic">L#x2019;Education du genre humain</hi> (Paris, <date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>); (vi) Emile Barrault, <hi rend="italic">Aux Artistes. Du Pass&#xE9; et de l#x2019;avenir des beaux-arts</hi>. (<hi rend="italic">Doctrine de Saint-Simon</hi>) (Paris, <date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>). This bound volume is not mentioned by Hill Shine, and Carlyle#x2019;s reading in Saint-Simonianism is thus more definitely known and somewhat narrower than he supposed. On the front fly-leaf Carlyle wrote, &#x201C;Saint-Simonisme. Pi&#xE9;ces Diverses. / <date when="1818-00-00">1818</date>&#x2013;<date when="1831-00-00">1831</date>&#x201D;; on the cover of no. v above he wrote, &#x201C;Thomas Carlyle.&#x2014; <date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>.&#x2014;&#x201D;; on the back fly-leaf he wrote, &#x201C;The foregoing Works, with many others of less moment, were sent to me at Craigenputtoch, in <date when="1830-00-00">1830</date> and subsequently. The Saint-Simonian Sect, after attracting considerable notice for a space of two years, began to split in pieces, underwent a sentence of Law (apparently on false charges) in <date when="1832-00-00">1832</date>, and soon dissolved and disappeared. The little Truth that lay among their crudities has not disappeared, or even properly <hi rend="italic">appeared</hi>, but yet waits its time.

They are bound in the order (iii), (ii), (iv), (v), (vi). They are all clean and otherwise unmarked, and comparison with d#x2019;Eichthal#x2019;s letter suggests that none are probably missing but some numbers of (i). Other pamphlets etc., bound in the same volume, were evidently sent later: see <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310517-TC-GE-01">TC to GE, <date when="1831-05-17">17 May 1831</date></ref>.</note> Being actually the writer of that Paper, headed <hi rend="italic">Signs of the Times,</hi> in the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review,</hi> there referred to, I cannot but cheerfully accept this present: by what route it came hither I shall perhaps learn by and by.</p>
<p>Allow me to express, to yourself and the <hi rend="italic">Saint-Simonian Society</hi>,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Disciples of Claude-Henri, Comte de Saint-Simon (<date when="1760-00-00">1760</date>&#x2013;<date when="1825-00-00">1825</date>), French philosopher and social scientist and the founder of French socialism. Between <date when="1825-00-00">1825</date> and <date when="1832-00-00">1832</date> they developed and expanded his doctrines into a comprehensive theory of society. Although they believed in striving for &#x201C;the amelioration of the moral and physical existence of the poorest class,&#x201D; they also held that men were inherently unequal and that society should be a natural hierarchy or meritocracy. Their program, which was one of peaceful revolution, included abolition of property inheritance, emancipation of women, and the association of all &#x201C;workers,&#x201D; i.e., bankers and industrialists as well as laborers. In the unrest after the <date when="1830-00-00">1830</date> revolution they gained their greatest following through their publications and meetings in Paris to expound their doctrines, which they called a religion. Their most prominent leaders were Saint-Amand Bazard and Barth&#xE9;lemy-Prosper Enfantin.</note> my friendly acknowledgments for the interest you take in my inquiries; <pb id="pg-05-136" n="05:136"/>my true satisfaction that these views of mine find some acceptance with you. Here too, in favour of that same Material and Mechanical Disposition of our age, against which so much is objected, be it thankfully admitted and considered that, by means of it and of its physical triumphs, the thoughts of a solitary man, which he casts forth silently into the stream of things, can travel onward over seas to distant Capitals; and in due time, bring him back, to his remote Scottish granite-mountains, a brotherly response.</p>
<p>Pursuant to your directions, I have looked over these Writings, with such leisure and composure as I could command; well purposing to investigate the matter farther, as I have opportunity. The announcement you make is wonderful enough: but I have long since learned that the Wonderful is not always the False; that it is a good rule &#x2018;to look at the Wonderful with one#x2019;s own eyes.#x2019; Could I have fancied, in <date when="1825-00-00">1825</date>, that among the <foreign><hi rend="italic">Palais-Royals</hi></foreign> and <foreign><hi rend="italic">Caf&#xE9;s et deux Billards</hi></foreign> of your gay City, there was an Apostolic Society, cherishing within it a New Religion, endeavouring, with philosophic insight, earnestly and with considerate zeal, to propagate the same, one of my first attempts would have been to obtain some personal Knowledge of you.</p>
<p>In these Books of your Society, which for most part were new to me, I find little or nothing to dissent from: the spirit at least meets my entire sympathy&#x2014;the opinions also are often such as I, in my own dialect, have been accustomed to cherish, and more or less clearly enunciate. That the last century was a period of Denial, of Irreligion and Destruction; to which a new period of Affirmation, of Religion, must succeed, if Society is to be reconstituted, or even to continue in existence: this with its thousand corollaries is a proposition for which the thinking minds of all nations are prepared. No less true is it that as Religion is the only bond and life of societies, so the only real Government were a Hierarchy: nay either a Hierarchy or Heresiarchy it now is, and must ever be; our real Governors in this age are, not the Capets and Guelfs, but Pope Voltaire, Bishop Hume, Bishop Smith, Archdeacon Helvetius, and the like, with their thousand Newspaper Curates; to whom all Kings and Premiers and Field-Marshals are but the sacristans and pew-openers,&#x2014;hired, indeed, at a quite mad rate of wages, and doing their work ill.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Here and elsewhere Carlyle speaks in the tone and with the phraseology of Teufelsdr&#xF6;ckh (cf. Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi>, p. 252). Because of these letters between d#x2019;Eichthal and Carlyle, Teufelsdr&#xF6;ckh was to be spoken of as in communication with the Saint-Simonians. He was last heard of as among them or at least as seemingly approving of the <date when="1830-07-00">July</date> revolution. See Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi>, pp. 296&#x2013;97.</note></p>
<p><pb id="pg-05-137" n="05:137"/>These prospects and interests of society I find set forth in your Works, in logical sequence and coherence, with precision, clear illustration, and the emphasis of a noble zeal. The more curious am I to understand how, in your minds, Scientific insight has transformed itself into Religion; or in what sense, not of exaggerated metaphor, men of cultivated talent, strong power of thought, and far above all superstitition and deception, use these extraordinary words: <foreign><hi rend="italic">Dieu est revenu &#xE0; la France en Saint-Simon, et la France annoncera au monde le Dieu nouveau</hi></foreign> [God has returned to France in Saint-Simon, and France will announce the new God to the world]. On which most important of all points I yet await instruction. For, let not loving Disciples take it amiss of a stranger to their Doctrine and their Master, in these writings of Saint-Simon himself, even in the <hi rend="italic">Nouveau Christianisme,</hi><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Hill Shine, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle and the Saint-Simonians. The Concept of Historical Periodicity</hi> (Baltimore, <date when="1941-00-00">1941</date>). It deals chiefly with Carlyle#x2019;s debt to the Saint-Simonians &#x201C;for his mature concept of historical periodicity&#x201D; and leaves aside the social aspect of their relation for &#x201C;later treatment,&#x201D; which it unfortunately has not yet received. See also the corrective view in Ren&#xE9; Wellek, &#x201C;Carlyle and the Philosophy of History,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Philological Quarterly,</hi> XXIII (<date when="1944-01-00">Jan. 1944</date>), 55&#x2013;76; reprinted in <hi rend="italic">Confrontations: Studies in the Intellectual and Literary Relations between Germany, England, and the United States during the Nineteenth Century</hi> (Princeton, <date when="1965-00-00">1965</date>), pp. 82&#x2013;113.</note> I find indeed an ardent, all-hoping temper, a keen, far-glancing, yet often, as seems to me, hasty and flighty, vision; surely nothing of a Divine Character; no Inspiration, save what every man of genius, who has once seen Truth, and with his whole heart embraced it, may be equally said to feel; none, indeed, but what several of his Disciples manifest in a still more unquestionable form. Doubt not, therefore, but the Book wherein you are to unfold your Religious principles, will be specially welcome here: the whole history and actual constitution of your Society, its aspects internal and external, its numbers, its political and economical relations, its whole manner of being and acting, are questions of unusual interest for me.</p>
<p>Neither let my friendly Critic in the <hi rend="italic">Organisateur</hi><note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Shine, <hi rend="italic">op. cit.</hi>, p. 50 ff.</note> fancy that my distrust of Committees goes the length of an aversion to Associations founded on Religion, which indeed is the only genuine and permanent basis of all Association. Nay I have long felt that only in Union could Religion properly exist; that this deep, mystic, immeasurable Sympathy, which man has with man, is the true element of Religion; that indeed the Communion of Saints, spoken of in the Creed, is no delusion, but the highest fact of our destiny.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-05-138" n="05:138"/>That, for the present, there is no public Religion we have only to open our eyes, and see. That there will and must be a Religion no man, who feels the unimpaired, fresh-created soul of a man within him, will doubt: for the same Omnipotence, which we call God, is still round us and in us, and nothing that man did or was has he become unable again to do and to be. A Faith, such as dwells in all devout hearts, teaches us that man, in these times, is not blinded but only benighted; that if he has long walked by the light of Mere Conflagrations, amid the sound of falling Cities, and now stands weeping amid ashes and desolation, the new dayspring will again visit him, &#x2018;these ashes are the soil of future herbage, and of richer harvests.#x2019;&#x2014; &#x2018;But as yet,#x2019; says Jean Paul, a deep, prophetic thinker, probably well known to you, &#x2018;But as yet struggles the twelfth hour of the Night; spectres uproar; the dead walk; the living dream.&#x2014; Thou, Eternal Providence wilt cause the day to dawn.#x2019;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The scene of open graves at midnight is common in Richter#x2019;s dream-visions.

<salute>My Dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Tho#x2019; I have nothing worth writing, and scarcely a moment#x2019;s time, I must send you a word or two before going to sleep.</p>
<p>We are all well here, and longing very much to hear from Scotsbrig. We hope for some word about my Father, and your general state, last week: perhaps tomorrow we shall be more fortunate. What to think about my Father#x2019;s state of health we know not rightly, but still trust the best.</p>
<p>From Jack I have got no more word; but expect to hear tomorrow that he is settled in his own lodgings, and begun practice, which, were <pb id="pg-05-140" n="05:140"/>it not that necessity compels him, he seems so loth to do. Neither have I heard anything definite about the disposal of my German History: I have now some thoughts of stopping in it soon after where I am, and perhaps for the present cutting it up into Review Articles, and publishing it first in that way. It will be the readiest method of sale; and I wish much that I were done with it, one way or other; for the task never pleased me. I could write, and will write something infinitely better, ere long.</p>
<p>The Jeffreys are all coming hither in the end of the month; but I will try to take a run into Annandale before that time. Our peats we have not yet begun to bring home, so the large horse will be busy; but Harry is always forthcoming.</p>
<p>I forget whether I mentioned last week that we had a parcel from Goethe, with pictures of his House &#x26;c; and a still stranger parcel from Paris, addressed to the Author of the <hi rend="italic">Signs of the Times</hi>.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Gustave d#x2019;Eichthal#x2019;s letter to Carlyle of <date when="1830-04-29">29 April</date> is addressed &#x201C;<foreign>A l#x2019;auteur de l#x2019;article intitul&#xE9;: Caract&#xE8;re de notre Epoque</foreign>.&#x201D; For the dating of this letter, see <ref target="volume-05/lt-18300806-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1830-08-06">6 Aug.</date></ref></note> The people there seem to think me a very promising man, and that some good will come of me. Thus, a prophet is not without honour, save in his own country.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Matt. 13:57.</note> Poor prophet! However, in my present solitude, I am very glad of these small encouragements.</p>
<p>Grace Shaw<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly the daughter of Carlyle#x2019;s aunt, Mary (Aitken) Shaw, invited for a visit.</note> returns to Dumfries tomorrow; apparently little to Mary#x2019;s regret, who seems to think her a fool, and that in the way of health, little ails her. Mary has not spirits for her giggling; and the details of her wonderful achievements with &#x2018;pretty lads#x2019; &#x2018;within the ports of Dumfries,#x2019; matchless tho#x2019; they be, are comparatively unimportant here.</p>

I will write next week, and perhaps tell you when I am coming. Good night, dear Mother! Commend me to my Father, and do make some of them write us word how he is. God keep you all, and us all!

<salute>My Dear Jack,</salute>
<p>In returning from Scotsbrig this day week, whither I had gone on the Thursday before, I found your Letter lying safe for me at Dumfries; and in spite of its valuable enclosure, only bearing single postage.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John#x2019;s letter of <date when="1830-08-12">12 Aug.</date>, containing a &#xa3;10 note, part of the &#xa3;11 3<hi rend="italic">s.</hi> which James Fraser had paid him for Carlyle. He had also written to his brother on <date when="1830-08-09">9 Aug.</date></note> That last circumstance was an error on the part of his Majesty which it did not strike me in the least to rectify. We hear that Providence is a rich provider; and truly in my own case I may thankfully say so: many are the times when some seasonable supply, in time of need, has arrived, where it was not in the least looked for. I was not by any means quite out of money, when your Bank-paper came to hand; but I saw clearly the likelihood or rather necessity of such an event; which now by this &#x2018;seasonable interposition#x2019; is put off to a safer distance. Pity that poor fellows should hang so much on cash! But it is the general lot; and whether it be ten pounds or ten thousand that would relieve us, the case is all the same, and the tie that binds us equally mean. <hi rend="italic">If</hi> I had money to carry me up and down the world in search of good men, and fellow labourers, with whom to hold communion and heat myself into clearer activity, I should think myself happier: but in the mean time I have <hi rend="italic">myself</hi> here, for better or worse; and who knows but my imprisonment in these moors, sulkily as I may sometimes take it, is really for my good. If I have any right strength, it will; if not, then what is the matter whether I sink or swim. O that I had but a little real wisdom; then would <hi rend="italic">all</hi> things work beautifully together for best ends! Meanwhile this Dunscore <pb id="pg-05-142" n="05:142"/>Patmos<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle often compared Dunscore, the parish which included Craigenputtoch, with the island of Patmos in the Aegean, where St. John was banished and where he wrote the book of Revelation. See Rev. 1:9.</note> is simply the place, where of all others in the known world I can live <hi rend="italic">cheapest;</hi> which in the case of a man living by Literature, with little saleable talent, and who would very fain not prove a Liar and Scoundrel, this is a momentous point. So let us abide here, and work, or at least rest and be thankful.</p>
<p>Your Indian intelligence was felt to be highly obliging by the Andersons; the state of the insurance at Lloyds was in my view a decisive circumstance, indicative of good hope. Do not neglect to inform the worthy people, whose anxiety you can hardly overrate, by your very earliest possibility.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On <date when="1830-08-12">12 Aug.</date> John had written: &#x201C;I have enquired about the Bridgewater on all heads, and the result is that I can procure almost no information which you do not already possess. She was last seen in the Straits of Sunda, about the middle of <date when="1830-02-00">February</date>. No other intelligence of her has reached London. I know several persons here who are expecting friends with her, and they all hope that she may have taken refuge, or rather gone to repair, at Bombay: in which case it is &#x2018;quite possible that she may <supplied>[not]</supplied> be heard of for at least a month to come.#x2019; And this hope was not much diminished by the over-land dispatches which arrived on Tuesday Evening from Bombay; for &#x2018;they contained no shipping intelligence, and considering the date of them it was scarcely possible that the Bridge<hi rend="italic">ter</hi> could have reached <supplied>[there]</supplied> before they left.#x2019; You will have the best idea of the opinion held by those best informed, when I tell you that insurances upon her have been effected at Lloyds, at 30 per cent.&#x2014; I shall hear the very earliest intelligence about her, and immediately send it to Miss Anderson &#x26; her Mother, in whose extreme anxiety I deeply sympathize.&#x201D;</note></p>
<p>As to my own concerns, I am happy to tell you that if this Lit. Hist. is not finished it is now at least concluded. On Tuesday last, I had a very short note from Captain or rather Curate Gleig,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >This note from G. R. Gleig has not been found.</note> which had been twice requested from him; stating that he &#x2018;found the Publishers averse,#x2019; chiefly on &#x2018;the score of terms#x2019; (which terms I had never hinted at); and indicating that he himself was averse, chiefly on the score of size, as &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">one</hi> volume would have suited <hi rend="italic">the</hi> Library#x2019; better. Farther it appeared from this Note, that the Reverend Editor was in all human probability, a cold-hearted, shabbyish, dandy Parson and Lieutenant, who being disappointed that I would not work for him at low wages and any kind of work, wished to have nothing more to do with me; in which implied wish I could not but heartily tho#x2019; sorrowfully coincide. So that nothing remains for you but to send me back that ill-starred Manuscript, as soon as you can; that I may consign it to its ultimate destination. Perhaps Mr W. Fraser may know some Government Clerk who can procure him a frank: if not make it into a parcel <pb id="pg-05-143" n="05:143"/>with any other Books and additions you may have to send, and transmit it hither by the Mail-coach. One volume of <hi rend="italic">Schlegel on the Drama,</hi><note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably A. W. von Schlegel, <hi rend="italic">&#xdc;ber dramatische Kunst und Literatur</hi> (<date when="1809-00-00">1809</date>&#x2013;<date when="1811-00-00">11</date>).</note> which you left long ago with George Irving may be put in, as an item. It will carry a few more Books &#x26;c; within what weight I do not exactly know; however, all except the very bulkiest have cost the same sum here. If James Fraser is printing <hi rend="italic">Schiller,</hi> or wishes to print it and pay for it, <hi rend="italic">by all means</hi> let him do so: I only wanted the Paper that I might so dispose of it here; thinking that in such circumstances it was like to fall asleep and for long or for ever remain useless to me. As for the Tale &#x2018;Cruthers and Johnson,#x2019; call it, dearest Jack, whatsoever thou wilt, correct it and curtail or expand it, and <foreign><hi rend="italic">schalte und walte</hi></foreign> [do as you please] in all respects with it, so thou canst turn it into an honest tho#x2019; otherwise useless penny; only let no mortal know that I wrote it, and do all thou canst to have the whole thing speedily and everlastingly forgotten.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Published anonymously in <hi rend="italic">Fraser#x2019;s Magazine,</hi> II (<date when="1831-01-00">Jan. 1831</date>), 691&#x2013;705; reprinted in <hi rend="italic">Works,</hi> XXX, 168&#x2013;98.

He has been harrassed, as never man was, for the last six months: in the first place bilious &#x26; nervous &#x26; weak almost to death; secondly, annoyed with the underhand pitiful conduct of Black &#x26; comp<hi rend="italic">ts</hi> of the For. Review; thirdly, working day &#x26; night, worse than any galley slave, endeavouring to make ends meet. It used to make my heart sore to see him. He is really very desirous of serving you; and feels his own ill luck very keenly in being connected with such persons as the Whittakers.&#x201D;</note> And for your own private satisfaction, understand that I am positively <hi rend="italic">glad</hi> this intolerable business is done nay glad almost that it is done in this way rather than another. What part of the <hi rend="italic">Ms.</hi> I can split into Review Articles I will serve in that way, for the present; leaving the whole Narrative, which is now completed down to <hi rend="italic">Luther,</hi> to serve as a kind of Introduction to my various Essays on German Literature; in the compass of which Essays (had I one or two more, for example <hi rend="italic">Luther, Lessing, Herder</hi>) there already lies the best History of German Literature that I can easily write:<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The manuscript was not published until <date when="1951-00-00">1951</date>. See Hill Shine, ed., <hi rend="italic">Carlyle#x2019;s Unfinished History of German Literature</hi> (Lexington, Kentucky: University of Kentucky Press, <date when="1951-00-00">1951</date>).</note> and so were there a flourishing, <pb id="pg-05-144" n="05:144"/>prophetic, and circumspective Essay appended by way of Conclusion, we had a very fair <foreign><hi rend="italic">Geschichte</hi></foreign> [History], or at least <foreign><hi rend="italic">Zur Geschichte</hi></foreign> [sketch of a History], all lying cut and dry; which can be published any time it is wanted; if not in my lifetime, then in some other#x2019;s till which consummation it will lie here eating no bread<supplied>[.]</supplied> And so for all things, my Brother, let us be thankful! I will work no more in &#x2018;Libraries,#x2019; or if I can help it, in compilation; but if my writing cannot be sold, it shall at least have been written out of my own heart. Also henceforth I will endeavour to be my own Editor; having now arrived at the years for it. Nay, in the Devil#x2019;s name, have I not a Kailgarden here, that will grow potatoes and onions? The <hi rend="italic">highest</hi> of men have often not had so much.</p>
<p>Too much of your sheet is already filled with my own concerns. At Scotsbrig, as I must tell you, matters wore a more tolerable aspect than I anticipated. Our Mother was as well as usual, rather better, having been out at Haymaking; our Father was still weak and somewhat dispirited; but, as far as I could see, he had no disease working on him, save loss of appetite, and the general feebleness belonging to those years he has now arrived at. He sits most of the day, reading miscellaneously enough; wanders sometimes among the labourers, or even does little jobs himself. He seemed much quieter and better-tempered. They were all wondering affectionately &#x2018;what was to become of poor Jack#x2019;: I reassured them, read your last Letter, and prophecied as I ever do that it would all be well.&#x2014; In returning, I looked over the Churchyard wall for a moment; the grave had got long grass, and was lying there mute and still. I think of it almost daily, almost momently, I might say; and now nearly without pain. Is not she too with God, even as we are? It is all well.</p>
<p>On your Newspaper stands (illegally) written <foreign><hi rend="italic">Brief Morgen</hi></foreign> [letter tomorrow]; the reason of which was that Jane and Mary were for Templand this morning; but Alick detained them, writing a Letter thither, till they determined to put it off till night, and so you get both paper and epistle together. He was writing, as we had all agreed on, that <hi rend="italic">he could not keep this Farm any longer than Whitsunday;</hi> finding it a ruinous concern. Let Mrs Welsh arrange the rest herself. Alick knows not well what he is to turn him to: other farms might be had; especially, there is one (Stennybeck beside Scotsbrig) that will be open at Whitsunday come a year, for which he would have a preference and might still find capital: but this, as you see, does not answer in respect of time; and in general it seems but a ticklish business taking farms at present. Poor outlook there is that way, nothing but loss <pb id="pg-05-145" n="05:145"/>and embarrassment on all hands: nay I often calculate that the land is all let some thirty per cent too high, and that before it can be reduced, the whole existing race of farmers must be ruined, that is, the whole agricultural tools (which are Capital) broken in pieces and burnt in the Landlord#x2019;s fire&#x2014;to warm his pointers with. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Ach Gott</hi></foreign> [Oh Lord]! the time is sick and out of joint:<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Hamlet,</hi> I, v.</note> the perversities and misarrangements moral and physical of this best of all stages of Society are rising to a head; and one day, see it who may, the whole concern will be blown up to Heaven and fall thence to Tartarus, and a new and fairer era will rise in its room. Since the time of Nero and Jesus Christ there is no record of such embarrassments, and crying, or (what is still worse) silent abominations. But the day, as we said, <hi rend="italic">will</hi> come; for God is still in Heaven, whether Henry Brougham and Jeremiah Bentham<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For both, see <ref target="volume-01/lt-18200607-TC-MAL-01"><sic>1:262</sic><corr>TC to MAL, <date when="1820-06-07">7 June 1820</date></corr></ref>.</note> know it or not; and the <hi rend="italic">Gig</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Gigmania</hi><note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For Carlyle the words are symbols of sham respectability.

Fiat!</hi></foreign> [Let it be done!]</p>
<p>Scarcely a scrap of this huge sheet remains for queries about poor Jack himself. Tell us whether Montague and you have yet fixed on a room: did we once hear of that, and of your fairly laying hand to the plough, we should fear nothing. Or otherwise, send us a <hi rend="italic">History of one of your days,</hi> from rising till bedtime; this would throw light on much that is dark for us. At all events, Courage! Courage!

These revolutions in France confirm his prophetic anticipations.

Edward Irving talks of going in the course of a few weeks to open a church there for the benefit of our countrymen &#x26; of the French also.&#x201D; Carlyle and John refer to the difficulties that continued to gather around Irving. In <date when="1830-07-00">July</date> the presbytery of London felt itself obliged to question his orthodoxy and brought up his views on the doctrine of Christ#x2019;s human nature in connection with the ordination of his assistant, the Rev. A. J. Scott. In <date when="1830-10-00">Oct.</date> it convened to examine his <hi rend="italic">Orthodox and Catholic Doctrine of our Lord#x2019;s Human Nature</hi>. Irving disagreed with the verdict that the book contained &#x201C;errors subversive of the great doctrines of Christianity&#x201D; and withdrew from the presbytery#x2019;s jurisdiction. It, in turn, declared him no longer a member until he should have renounced his errors. Even more ominously, in Scotland the orthodoxy of another of his followers, the Rev. H. B. Maclean, was relentlessly challenged. In <date when="1831-00-00">1831</date>, the General Assembly itself was to withdraw A. J. Scott#x2019;s licence to preach and to remit the case of H. B. Maclean to his presbytery. Irving#x2019;s own downfall was soon to follow. For an account of Irving#x2019;s spiritual difficulties at this time, see A. L. Drummond, <hi rend="italic">Edward Irving and His Circle</hi> (London, [<date when="1937-00-00">1937</date>]), chap. 8, and C. G.

The <hi rend="italic">Picture</hi> is a very amusing work, of a proper plan and tone; only, I fear, it is defective in accuracy. In the part of the country known to myself I have found more than one strange error: for example, <hi rend="italic">two</hi> Bridges at Annan; the highroad running <hi rend="italic">thro#x2019;</hi> the village of Ruthwell &#x26;c &#x26;c. I think, in case of another edition, you should send a copy of the work interleaved to some punctual person in every county, and have his remarks and corrections on it: I will cheerfully undertake Dumfriesshire, at least Annandale. With this improvement, and perhaps the addition of some Statistical Tables, which might easily be procured in an authentic shape, it would be a most meritorious and really useful Book.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Scottish Songs and Ballads,</hi> by the same Collector, were a highly acceptable present to me;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >2 vols.

<p>I was much obliged by your prompt and friendly answer to my proposal, and commission (to Mr Aitken) which last produced the desired effect without delay. As to the first, I am on the whole glad that you so decided.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not to publish Carlyle#x2019;s history of German literature.</note> The work is now finished as far as I mean to meddle with it at present: and I intend to turn it to more appropriate use than publishing it with my <hi rend="italic">name,</hi> which is already too deeply dyed German. By and by I shall perhaps try you with something else, of native growth.</p>
<p>I am fixed here, for a time, expecting visiters [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] and the like: <pb id="pg-05-148" n="05:148"/>but <supplied>[this?]</supplied> winter I am going to stir out, and shall perhaps see you in Edinburgh.</p>

<p>I guessed by the outside colour of your Letter what had befallen.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >His father had recently died at Le Havre. See <ref target="volume-05/lt-18300806-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1830-08-06">6 Aug.</date></ref></note> Change is the lot of the living; ever till that last, greatest Change, which conducts us all into Rest. You will find yourself in a new situation, where new duties, to a Mother, to a family of which you are now the head, aught [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] to suppress unavailing regrets. &#x2018;The end of man is an Action not a Thought.#x2019;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A favorite doctrine of Carlyle#x2019;s.

<p>I suffered nothing from the want of those Books; which I almost feel ashamed to have asked for, tho#x2019; by accident, at such a time. I am, as you see, clearing out my premises, having as it were done with <hi rend="italic">History,</hi> Literary or Political, for the present: I believe your list is here in full tale; if I have forgotten any, tell me and I will search it out for you.</p>
<p>That remarkable History of German Literature, doubtless to the great joy of all my friends, is done for the present: nevertheless it is not to be printed, till after an unknown period; but to lie quietly in my drawer; the Publishers and Editor having sunk the concern between them, at least left it in a state too hopeless for me; so I have withdrawn and left the unhappy people at sixes and sevens.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Chaucer, <hi rend="italic">Troilus and Creseyde,</hi> IV, 622; <hi rend="italic">Richard II,</hi> II, ii; <hi rend="italic">Don Quixote,</hi> I, iv, ch. 3; Goldsmith, <hi rend="italic">The Good-Natured Man,</hi> I.</note> Nay the able Editor informs me he is going into Parliament for a Kentish <pb id="pg-05-149" n="05:149"/>Borough!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Fraser, formerly editor of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Review</hi>. His borough was that of Hythe, in Kent. In its unreformed state, it decidedly rejected him, although the most popular candidate, and the new M.P.#x2019;s were &#x201C;chaired through the town&#x201D; only by his permission. <hi rend="italic">Times,</hi> <date when="1830-08-05">5 Aug.</date>, p. 4.</note> One thing alone am I thankful for: that I have <hi rend="italic">done</hi> with that most accursed task; and am not bound ever to undertake the like again while I live.</p>
<p>You will be welcomed here, in <date when="1830-09-00">September</date>, I can promise you in what Mr Irving calls &#x2018;our choicest mood.#x2019;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-04/lt-18281200-JWC-JCA-01"><sic>4:424</sic><corr>JWC to JCA, [<date when="1828-12-01">Dec. 1828</date>]</corr></ref>.</note> Pray let us know when you think of coming, and we will take all measures to forward you. We have one remarkably stupid man, two horses, one of them your namesake<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Harry.&#x201D;</note> of unparalleled worth; a cart, a gig, and a wheelbarrow; all of which shall be at your service. A few cigars also are still in store here; and shag-tobaac with clean pipes <foreign><hi rend="italic">ad libitum</hi></foreign>.</p>
<p>You are not to accuse your Fate that it drives you away from Literature. Not by Printing-ink alone does man live. Literature, as followed at present, is but a species of Brewing or Cookery, and as I judge, the basest species, for the Cooks use poison, and vend it by telling innumerable lies. A Life of Wisdom, which is man#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">sole</hi> blessedness, can in no trade, in no country, and no time, except by his <hi rend="italic">own consent,</hi> be withheld from him. Believe this, and lay it deeply to heart, and live and walk in the faith of it; and you are above the world. I beg of you also, as indeed Time will teach you, not to disparage <supplied>[the cra]</supplied>ft that gains you bread and outward furthera<supplied>[nce. W]</supplied>hat is all work but a drudgery, no labour for the present joyous but grievous? Here are two little fellows at this moment visible from my window; they are all over-splashed with lime on their outward man, and have an immaterial infinite soul within them; yet will they keep white-washing till sunset, for twenty-pence each and their fill of bacon and potatoes. Nature is hourly reading us the richest lessons of Philosophy.</p>
<p>Fear not therefore that any friend will disesteem you for relinquishing what you cannot overtake. If you cannot <hi rend="italic">write</hi> wisdom and nobleness of mind, <hi rend="italic">act</hi> it then at all times, which is infinitely better. But the truth is it is neither chiefly by the reading of Books nor by the writing of them, that one grows wise in this world: but above all other things <supplied>[by he]</supplied>artily loving Wisdom and setting his whole n<supplied>[ature swift]</supplied>ly to seek it, in <hi rend="italic">what</hi> course soever his fortune may lead him to follow. So, I tell you again, you know not what is to come out of you. Be earnest, ever diligent; &#x2018;do the duty you see clearly at hand, <pb id="pg-05-150" n="05:150"/>and new light will arise from it to show you the next#x2019;:<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister#x2019;s Apprenticeship, Works,</hi> XXIV, 2, and Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor,</hi> p. 196.</note> this is our only rule, and none that follows it well, will miss the true goal.</p>
<p>Now, write to tell us when you can come; and in the mean time, think of us as of friends and hearty well-wishers. <closer><salute>And so all good be with you!</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I received your two Parcels duly, and have again to thank you for the trouble you took on that occasion.</p>
<p>Along with this comes such a multiplicity of packages as I fear will put your good nature to the test, I will send you a list of them:</p>
<p>1. <hi rend="italic">Macvey Napier Esq</hi>r, <hi rend="italic">Signet-Library;</hi> a heavy parcel of Books.</p>
<p>2. <hi rend="italic">Mr Tait, Bookseller</hi> (William, at the end of the Mound).</p>
<p>3. <hi rend="italic">Henry Inglis Esq</hi>r <hi rend="italic">W.S.</hi> [46] Queen-street<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;46&#x201D; has been inserted in another hand, probably Aitken#x2019;s, before the address. Before each item but the last two &#x201C;del<hi rend="italic">d</hi> [delivered]&#x201D; has been written.</note> (what number I always forget, but the Directory will easily show).</p>
<p>4. <hi rend="italic">John Gordon Esq</hi>r <hi rend="italic">84 G</hi>t <hi rend="italic">King-street</hi>.</p>
<p>5. <hi rend="italic">S. Aitken Esq</hi>r <hi rend="italic">Bank-street (No I)</hi>&#x2014;that is for yourself; and contains the five Magazines you sent me long ago, and for which I am really much obliged to you. That Colbourns Magazine seems to me greatly the best published in these Islands at present:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">New Monthly Magazine,</hi> founded in <date when="1814-00-00">1814</date> by Henry Colburn, began its rise in the literary world under Thomas Campbell#x2019;s editorship (<date when="1821-00-00">1821</date>&#x2013;<date when="1830-00-00">30</date>) as the inheritor of the unfulfilled renown of the <hi rend="italic">London Magazine</hi>. It owed its importance chiefly to its succession of famous editors and to the large number of critical articles it published.</note> if you can send me another stock, along with some Book-parcel, I shall take it very thankfully; however, I scarcely deserve such a favour, these have been kept so long.</p>
<p>6. <hi rend="italic">S. Aitken Esq</hi>r (<hi rend="italic">No. II</hi>)&#x2014;which also is for yourself to open and dispose of; and comes with innumerable Compliments from the Lady, and Regrets&#x2014;that Game is so exceedingly scarce on the Moors this summer, whereby she is forced to content herself with such a fraction.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A note on the letter, in another hand, says &#x201C;2 Birds,&#x201D; and indicates that one was for &#x201C;Mr B<supplied>[radfute]</supplied>&#x201D;: they were probably grouse.</note></p>
<p><title><pb id="pg-05-151" n="05:151"/>&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;</title></p>
<p>These are all my Commissions for this once! If any parcels are left for me, I hope you will continue to take charge of them as you have done of late, to my great convenience: unless there is special notice of despatch on the parcel, you can forward them under one cover monthly. In return, I will&#x2014;spare you all expression of <hi rend="italic">Thanks</hi> on my part, which, I know, are things you do not like.</p>
<p>Mrs C. joins with me in best regards. Remember us kindly to Miss Stoddart and Mr Bradfute, and believe me always,</p>
<closer><salute>My Dear Sir, / Faithfully Your#x2019;s, /</salute></closer>

<ps><p>P. S. I have forgot one Parcel, <hi rend="italic">Charles Oliphant Esq W. S Edin</hi>r<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Writer to the Signet, 56 George St.</note> (in what street I cannot even guess: but the Packet is some sort of Agricultural Diploma from Germany, and that may give your Porter a clue, if indeed there are <hi rend="italic">two</hi> Charles Oliphants in the Directory, which is not likely).</p>
<p>If <hi rend="italic">your</hi> Porter can take over Mr Napier#x2019;s parcel, the rest would pay themselves.</p></ps>

<p>A Letter, which, as you expected, was welcomed by us &#x2018;on a bright <date when="1830-06-00">June day</date>#x2019;;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See the beginning of Goethe#x2019;s letter of <date when="1830-06-06">6 June</date>.</note> and some six weeks afterwards, a Packet containing <pb id="pg-05-152" n="05:152"/>Books and other Valuables, the whole of which arrived in perfect order,&#x2014;are two new kindnesses on your part, which still remain to be acknowledged. This grateful duty I have delayed till now, as I wished, before writing, to have something definite to say about the bibliopolic fate of that <hi rend="italic">History of German Literature</hi>, in which you are pleased to take an interest, and over the Publication of which an evil star had for some time, tho#x2019; as yet with uncertain aspects, appeared to rule. That projected <hi rend="italic">Series</hi> of Literary Histories<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Which the Whittakers were to have published.</note> has fallen to the ground, no proper hands for most departments of it having showed themselves: in consequence, the Booksellers have grown languid; the editor,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Fraser.</note> a well-meaning, but ineffectual person (late Editor of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Review</hi>, which has now again merged itself in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Quarterly</hi>) has not only mourned by those streams of Babel, but actually hung his harp on the willows,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ps. 137:2.</note> that is to say, abandoned Literature altogether, and is now struggling to be elected Member of Parliament for some &#x2018;rotten borough#x2019; in Kent; whereby the whole Literary-History concern lies in a state of fatal stagnation. After some correspondence and exertion, I have succeeded in extricating my own poor Manuscript from such ungainly neighbourhood, with intent to reposit it quietly in my Drawer, where according to all appearance it may now lie for an indefinite period.</p>
<p>Neither, now that the trouble of it is over, do I much regret this arrangement: the Work itself may profit by a keeping till the ninth year;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Horace, <hi rend="italic">Ars Poetica</hi>, l. 388.</note> and for my own part, as my Name was to have stood on the Title-page, I cannot but rejoice, so far as that goes, that my first professed appearance in Literature may now take place under some less questionable character than that of a Compiler; being ambitious, one day, of far higher honours.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">The French Revolution</hi> (<date when="1837-00-00">1837</date>) was the first of Carlyle#x2019;s works to appear under his own name.</note> It is true, as you say somewhere, and it ought ever to be borne in mind, that &#x2018;an Artist in doing Anything does All#x2019;:<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not precisely identified, but the general thought is close to Goethe in his poems &#x201C;Kunstlerlied,&#x201D; &#x201C;Elegien II: Euphrosyne,&#x201D; and in &#x201C;Kunstwerk: Maximen und Reflexionen 224.&#x201D;</note> nevertheless how few are Artists in this sense; and till one knows that he <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> be a Mason, why should he publickly hire himself as Hodman!<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For Carlyle#x2019;s discussion of the term &#x201C;hodman,&#x201D; see <ref target="volume-04/lt-18271025-TC-JAC-01"><sic>4:271&#x2013;72</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1827-10-25">25 Oct. 1827</date></corr></ref>. A literary hodman would be a prosaic soul competent within a limited sphere but untroubled by metaphysical strivings and not truly creative. Characteristic usages of the term are in Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi>, p. 105, and in <hi rend="italic">Heroes and Hero-Worship, Works</hi>, V, 157. Carlyle also alludes here, for the first time in his letters, to Goethe#x2019;s poem &#x201C;Symbolum&#x201D; (&#x201C;Des Maurers Wandeln&#x201D; or &#x201C;The Mason#x2019;s ways&#x201D;), which he translated entire in <hi rend="italic">Past and Present, Works</hi>, X, 237&#x2013;38. He recalled in later life that it was his brother John who introduced him to the poem (A. Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">NL</hi>, II, 284). The philosophy of life expressed in it made it mean more to him than any other lyric, though as Harrold points out the German original hardly bears the heavy symbolic and moral freight implied in Carlyle#x2019;s translation (see his <hi rend="italic">Carlyle and German Thought: <date when="1819-00-00">1819</date>&#x2013;<date when="1834-00-00">1834</date></hi> [New Haven: Yale University Press, <date when="1934-00-00">1934</date>], pp. 232&#x2013;34, 323&#x2013;24; and Kuno Francke, &#x201C;Carlyle and Goethe#x2019;s &#x2018;Symbolum,#x2019;&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Philological Quarterly</hi>, VI [<date when="1927-00-00">1927</date>], 97&#x2013;101). Carlyle closed his inaugural address on being installed as Rector of the University of Edinburgh in <date when="1866-00-00">1866</date> with a literal rendering of the poem#x2019;s last line&#x2014;&#x201C;We bid you be of hope&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XXIX, 482)&#x2014;and as Froude observes the poem was on his lips to the end of his life (<hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi>, III, 86). The Carlyle House, Chelsea, owns a facsimile of Carlyle#x2019;s translation.</note></p>
<p><pb id="pg-05-153" n="05:153"/>For the rest, I am about finishing the Book; at least, putting it into such a shape that it can be published at any future period. Within the space of a Volume and half, I had got down, in a continuous narrative, to the Reformation: a hasty section would carry me to Lessing#x2019;s day; after which I had determined, on maturer calculation of my means and aim, to treat the rest in a fragmentary and rhapsodic method; singling out from the mass which is too vast and confused for me to shape into History, the main summits and figures, and dwelling largely on these as individual objects; whereby, to an attentive reader, some imperfect yet not untrue image of the so chaotic whole might at length present itself. Separate Essays on various personages of that period, from the very highest down to a far lower grade, I have already written; to which from time to time I purpose to add others: so that the Work is left in a growing state; and when concluded, and knit up, by some general considerations, retrospective and prospective, will one day set before my Countrymen a full view of all that I have thought or guessed on this to me so important subject. The present undertaking once fairly put to a side, as it now nearly is, I must forthwith betake me to something more congenial and original: except writing from the heart and if possible to the heart, Life has no other business for me, no other pleasure. When I look at the wonderful Chaos within me, full of natural Supernaturalism, and all manner of Antideluvian [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] fragments; and how the Universe is daily growing more mysterious as well as more august, and the influences from without more heterogeneous and perplexing, I see not well what is to come of it all; and only conjecture from the violence of the fermentation that <pb id="pg-05-154" n="05:154"/>something strange may come.<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle describes here the state of mind from which <hi rend="italic">Sartor Resartus</hi> would soon spring. He began the first draft in <date when="1830-09-00">late September</date>. One of the chapters in Book III is entitled &#x201C;Natural Supernaturalism.&#x201D;</note> As you feel a fatherly concern in my spiritual progress, which you know well, for all true disciples of yours, to be the one thing needful, I lay these details before you with the less reluctance.</p>
<p>But now turning to more immediately practical matters, let me thank you heartily for that new cargo of friendly memorials and useful implements which the Weimar Carriers and the Hamburg Shippers have transported hither. With your spacious, lordly Town-Mansion we have made ourselves familiar; and look wistfully thro#x2019; the windows, as if we could see our Friend and Teacher sitting there. However, the little Garden-house with its domestic contraction, and flowery privacy, is the scene we like best to figure you in, as you yourself liked best to occupy it<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See item 2 of Goethe#x2019;s letter of <date when="1830-06-14">14 June</date> in the headnote.</note> As for the Books, I have found <hi rend="italic">Wachler</hi>,<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ludwig Wachler (<date when="1767-00-00">1767</date>&#x2013;<date when="1838-00-00">1838</date>). See items 1 and 2 of Goethe#x2019;s letter of <date when="1830-06-06">6 June</date> in headnote. According to Norton (p. 201 n.), a note in Eckermann#x2019;s hand is pasted inside Carlyle#x2019;s copy of Wachler#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">History</hi> which reads: &#x201C;<foreign>Ein mir sehr theures Geschenck von Goethe. Sonntag Mittag d. <date when="1824-01-04">4 Januar 1824</date>, aus seinen lieben H&#xE4;nden empfangen</foreign> [A very precious gift from Goethe to me. Received from his dear hands, Sunday, at midday, <date when="1824-01-04">4 January 1824</date>].&#x201D; From Wachler#x2019;s monograph <hi rend="italic">&#xdc;ber Werden und Wirken der Literatur</hi> Carlyle took the subtitle of Teufelsdr&#xF6;ckh#x2019;s book, <hi rend="italic">Die Kleider, ihr Werden und Wirken</hi>. See Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi>, p. 8.</note> so kindly granted me by Dr Eckermann, a sound, substantial help, in whose spirit I warmly agree, in whose vigorous summaries much knowledge is to be gathered. The <hi rend="italic">Farbenlehre</hi> [<hi rend="italic">Theory of Colors</hi>]<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See item 4 of Goethe#x2019;s letter of <date when="1830-06-06">6 June</date> in headnote. Goethe had previously mentioned the <hi rend="italic">Farbenlehre</hi> in his letter of <date when="1829-07-06">6 July 1829</date> and Carlyle had expressed his &#x201C;curiosity&#x201D; about it in his letter to Goethe of <date when="1829-11-03">3 Nov. 1829</date>. G. B. Tennyson suggests it as a possible influence on <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi> in his <hi rend="italic">Sartor Called Resartus</hi> (Princeton: Princeton University Press, <date when="1965-00-00">1965</date>), pp. 129&#x2013;30.
<lb/><lb/>Carlyle did not know what to make of the book and never gave Goethe his estimate of it. In <date when="1878-05-00">May 1878</date> he presented to Professor John Tyndall as &#x201C;&#x2018;a farewell gift,#x2019;&#x201D; the two octavo volumes of letterpress, and the single folio volume, consisting in great part of &#x201C;coloured diagrams,&#x201D; together with Goethe#x2019;s note of <date when="1830-06-14">14 June</date>. &#x201C;My illustrious friend,&#x201D; writes Tyndall, &#x201C;wished me to examine the book, with a view of setting forth what it really contained.&#x201D; Tyndall did so in a paper delivered before the Royal Institution in <date when="1880-00-00">1880</date> and his balanced assessment of Goethe#x2019;s theories was printed in his <hi rend="italic">New Fragments</hi> (New York: D. Appleton, <date when="1897-00-00">1897</date>), pp. 47&#x2013;77; cf. also p. 356. Although the modern verdict is unfavorable to the <hi rend="italic">Farbenlehre</hi> as a work of science, Goethe viewed it as his most important work and undertook to revise the historical part in <date when="1831-00-00">1831</date>. &#x201C;&#x2018;In what I have done as a poet,#x2019; he says to Eckermann, &#x2018;I take no pride, but I am proud of the fact that I am the only person in this century who is acquainted with the difficult science of colours#x2019;&#x201D; (quoted from Tyndall, p. 50).</note> I have already looked into with satisfaction and curiosity; and mean, <pb id="pg-05-155" n="05:155"/>this winter, to master it, so far as possible, according to the plan you recommend. Should I attain to any right understanding of the doctrine, it will be a pleasing office to publish such insight here, where vague contradictory reports are all that circulate at present. But chiefly I must thank you for that noble <hi rend="italic">Briefwechsel</hi>,<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Goethe#x2019;s correspondence with Schiller. See item 3 of Goethe#x2019;s letter of <date when="1830-06-06">6 June</date>.</note> which does, &#x2018;like a Magic Chariot,#x2019;<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle probably alludes to Mephistopheles#x2019; magic cloak which by means of a &#x201C;jet of fire&#x201D; (&#x201C;<foreign>Feuerluft</foreign>&#x201D;) will transport him and Faust on their course of adventures (<hi rend="italic">Faust I</hi>, II. 2069&#x2013;72). The &#x201C;Magic Chariot&#x201D; may also allude to the &#x201C;<foreign>Feuerwagen</foreign>&#x201D; or &#x201C;Chariot of Fire&#x201D; (i.e., the sun), which Faust sees drawing near him in <hi rend="italic">Faust I</hi>, ll. 702&#x2013;3. Cf. 2 Kings 2:11.</note> convey me into beloved scenes, and seasons of the glorious Past, where Friends ever dear to me, tho#x2019; distant, tho#x2019; dead, speak audibly. So pure and generous a relation as yours with Schiller, founded on such honest principles, tending towards such lofty objects, and in its progress so pleasant, smooth and helpful, is altogether unexampled in what we moderns call Literature; it is a Friendship worthy of Classical days, when men#x2019;s hearts had not yet become incapable of that feeling, and Art was, what it ever should be, an inspired function, and the Artist a Priest and Prophet. The world is deeply your debtor, first for having acted such a part with your Friend, and now for having given us this imperishable memorial of it, which will grow in value as years and generations are added to it. You will forgive me also if I fancy that herein I have got a new light upon your own character; and seen there, in warm, beneficent activity, much that I only surmised before. To Schiller, whose high and true, yet solitary, pain-stricken, self-consuming spirit is almost tragically apparent in these Letters, such a union must have been invaluable; to you also it must have been a rare blessing, for &#x2018;infinite is the strength man lends to man.#x2019;<note n="15" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. &#x201C;Precious is man to man,&#x201D; quoted by Froude from Carlyle#x2019;s journal, <date when="1834-07-26">26 July 1834</date> (<hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi>, II, 445).</note> I am to finish the last Volume to-night, and will take leave of it with a mournful feeling, as of a fine Poem, not written but acted, which had been cut short by death. My Wife, who participates in these sentiments, bids me ask of you, for her, a little scrap of Schiller#x2019;s handwriting, if you can spare such, to be treasured here along with your own, among the most precious things.</p>
<p>We look forward with impatience for that translated <hi rend="italic">Life of Schiller</hi>, with its wondrous accompaniments; expecially that Introduction, in which you condescend to fear that some things you have said may be considered indiscreet! To me it can never be other than honourable <pb id="pg-05-156" n="05:156"/>to be in any such way associated with you, in sight of any man, or of all men.<note n="16" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For Goethe#x2019;s introduction and what it meant to Carlyle, see Appendix II in the <hi rend="italic">Life of Friedrich Schiller, Works</hi>, XXV, 322&#x2013;45. Goethe publishes in it several passages from Carlyle#x2019;s letters to him as well as two views of Craigenputtoch.</note> The last Section of your <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> we also long to see: and I am here requested to remind you, if possible without importunity, of that promised Interpretation of the <foreign><hi rend="italic">M&#xE4;hrchen</hi></foreign>, which is still earnestly wanted by the female intellect.<note n="17" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-05/lt-18300523-TC-G-01">TC to G, <date when="1830-05-23">23 May</date></ref>.

Tennyson, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi>, pp. 150 n., 190&#x2013;93.</note> Neither am I to forget that new-made <hi rend="italic">Chaos</hi>,<note n="18" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See item 6 of Goethe#x2019;s letter of <date when="1830-06-14">14 June</date>.</note> in which your Ottilie gracefully occupies herself: we smiled to see ourselves in print there;<note n="19" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle#x2019;s &#x201C;Faust#x2019;s Curse&#x201D; was first published in Ottilie#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Chaos</hi> in <date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>.</note> and by a new opportunity, new contributions will not be wanting.</p>
<p>Some weeks ago I had a strange Letter with certain strange Books from a Society in Paris, which calls itself <hi rend="italic">La Societ&#xE9; Saint-Simonienne</hi>, and professes among other wonderful things, now that Saint-Simon is dead, to be instituting a new Religion in the world. Their address to me grounded itself on an Essay entitled <hi rend="italic">Signs of the Times</hi> which I had written for the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review</hi>, about a year ago, and which seemed to point me out as their man. If you have chanced to notice that Saint-Simonian affair, which long turned on Political Economy, and but lately became artistic and religious, I could like much to hear your thoughts on it.<note n="20" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Goethe answered on <date when="1830-10-17">17 Oct.</date>: &#x201C;<foreign>Von der Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; St. Simonienne bitte Sich fern zu halten</foreign>&#x201D; [From the St. Simonian Society pray hold yourself aloof]. See Norton, <hi rend="italic">GC</hi>, pp. 225&#x2013;6.</note>&#x2014; For the present I can enter on nothing farther, though much remained to be said. I hope, it will be my turn to write again, ere long; and that often thro#x2019; winter we shall hear good tidings of you and send friendly greetings: best wishes we shall daily send. <closer><salute>With loving regards, such as can belong to no other, I remain always, Your grateful Friend,</salute></closer></p>

<ps><p><title>[<hi rend="small-caps">Goethe#x2019;s Letter to Carlyle of <date when="1830-06-06">6 June 1830</date></hi>]</title></p>
<p>Your valued letter, my dearest Sir, of the <date when="1830-05-23">23d of May</date>, took only fourteen days in coming, and this incites me to answer immediately, since I can hope that mine may still greet you on a lovely <date when="1830-06-00">June day</date>. <pb id="pg-05-157" n="05:157"/>It is certainly highly gratifying that the distance between well disposed persons of a like turn of mind is being steadily diminished, owing to the arrangements of our civilised world, in return for which we may excuse much that is amiss in it.</p>
<p>First of all I will declare that with respect to your proposed plan of treating the History of German Literature there is no alteration to be suggested, and that I only find a few gaps here and there, to which I mean to call your attention. You should, however, be thoroughly convinced that the first edition of such a book is to be considered only as a first sketch, which will be enriched and made more correct in every successive edition. You have your whole life to work at it, and may certainly rejoice in a positive advantage from this to yourself and to others.</p>
<p>In furtherance of this object of yours, I will immediately set about the despatching of a parcel intended for you, which the favourable time of the year will bring you soon enough. It contains:</p>
<p>1. <hi rend="italic">Lectures on the History of German National Literature</hi>, by Dr. Ludwig
Wachler, 2 parts, <date when="1818-00-00">1818</date>.</p>
<p>This work I presented in <date when="1824-00-00">1824</date> as a most useful one, to good Dr. Eckermann; he, having now gone on a journey to the south with my son, left it behind with me, as a gift for you, with his kindest regards and good wishes. I send it with the greater satisfaction, because I am sure that in following this clew you cannot go wrong. You have indeed already formed your own convictions in regard to most particulars, but should you wish to inquire about any special matter, I will try to answer you faithfully.</p>
<p>2. A most important little tract, bearing the title <hi rend="italic">Ueber Werden und Wirken der Literatur (Concerning the Growth and Influence of Literature)</hi>, especially of the German Literature of our day, by Dr. Ludwig Wachler, Breslau, <date when="1829-00-00">1829</date>. There is occasion for a variety of reflections on the way in which the same man, after an interval of ten years, again briefly expresses himself upon matters to the consideration of which he has devoted his whole life. By means of the above-mentioned two volumes you will be fully enabled to appreciate and to profit by the drift and substance of his later work.</p>
<p>3. Four Volumes of my Correspondence with Schiller, which complete the book. These I simply hand over to you, that you may make them your own, according to your usual clear and sympathetic way, and may draw still nearer to the friends who are here conversing together. By and by I will send you many of the friendly and exceedingly thoughtful notices which these volumes have had the good fortune to <pb id="pg-05-158" n="05:158"/>call forth in Germany; you will moreover get out of them a great many hints, useful for your purpose.</p>
<p>4. Two volumes of my <hi rend="italic">Farbenlehre</hi> with a set of plates. These again will not be unprofitable to you. The Work is indeed too much flesh of my flesh and bone of my bone not to create in you a friendly interest. Say something to me about it. The general view will certainly fall in with your way of thinking; should you wish an explanation on any particular point, I will try and give it to you.</p>
<p>5. Further you will find in the little box the last sheets of the translation of your <hi rend="italic">Life of Schiller</hi>. The publication has been delayed, and I wished to make the little work especially pretty, for the sake of the publisher as well as for its own. I have certainly pleased the public; I only hope you will excuse it.</p>
<p>The frontispiece represents your house from a near point of view, the vignette on the title-page, the same from a distance,&#x2014;I hope, so engraved from the drawings which you sent, that they cannot fail to please in England also. Outside, on the front cover, is a view of Schiller#x2019;s house in Weimar; and on the cover at the back, a little Garden-house <supplied>[at Jena]</supplied> which he himself built in order that he might withdraw from his family and all the world. When he was there, no one was allowed to enter. Besides there was scarcely room for a writing-table in it. It was so very slightly built that it threatened afterwards to fall to ruin, and was pulled down; but this was after he had given up the garden and moved to Weimar.</p>
<p>There might still be much to say about a preface I have written for it, but it will be better to leave it to your own feelings, and when you have read it, you will judge whether I have overdone the matter, or have succeeded in doing only what is suitable for the purpose. In any case it was necessary to excite interest and to arouse attention. We shall await what further may ensue; what is to be done further, I foresee tolerably well.</p>
<p>To your dear wife my most friendly greetings. By means of the silhouette, she has come much nearer to us; such the power of the noble original#x2019;s veritable shadow! May she now send us such another portrait of her husband! I am glad that famous <foreign><hi rend="italic">M&#xE4;hrchen</hi></foreign>, there also, does not fail in its effect. It is a piece of legerdemain which would hardly succeed a second time. A normal imagination irresistibly demands that reason should extract from it something logical and consistent, which reason never succeeds in doing. However, I possess two interpretations, which I will seek out, and if possible send in the little box.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-05-159" n="05:159"/>Since I have now, in order not to exceed &#x201C;the single sheet,&#x201D; reached the outside page, I shall still make use of this space to communicate to you the following further information. Immediately upon the departure of the first little box, which will be very soon, I shall at once get ready another, in which you will receive the translation of your <hi rend="italic">Life of Schiller</hi> and the seventh Section of my Works, which contains, 1. <hi rend="italic">Tag-und Jahreshefte</hi> (the completion of my former Confessions) in two volumes; 2. Reviews and some older Pieces, one volume; 3. <hi rend="italic">Cellini</hi>, two volumes. What more may still be thought of shall be noted, and sent in the little box itself. <closer><salute>In the hope that this letter may greet you in peaceful days and in good health, I conclude, with the assurance of my most faithful and unalterable sympathy,</salute></closer></p>
<name>J. W. v. Goethe.</name>
<p>A peerless lock of black hair impels me to add still a little sheet, and with true regret to remark that the desired return is, alas, impossible. Short and discoloured and devoid of all charm, old age must be content if any flowers at all will still blossom in the inner man when the outward bloom has vanished. I am already seeking for some substitute, but have not yet been lucky enough to find one. My warmest greetings to your esteemed wife.</p>
<p>I hope the little box has arrived safe!</p>

<p>1. Goethe#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Farbenlehre</hi>, two vols. 8vo, and a volume of plates, in 4to; in the latter are:</p>

Our friends in the county of Dumfries are asked to continue to contribute. Unfortunately a complete set cannot be sent. The association was at first very small and only a few copies were printed, merely to save transcribing. Gradually the interest in it increased, and the issue became larger, but by degrees the early numbers were exhausted. May these Sibylline products, sprung from the most recent Chalk Deposits of the Continent, afford some pleasant hours to our friends, who are across the sea on their Primary Granite.

<salute>My Dear Jack,</salute>
<p>In answer to your last most welcome and gratifying Letter,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On <date when="1830-09-09">9 Sept.</date> John wrote that he had sent a parcel of books and the manuscript of the history of German literature to Carlyle about ten days before. He also announced that he had taken lodgings at the address to which Carlyle sent this letter.</note> it will be best to give you some history of my movements since it arrived, which may at the same time account for my little delay in writing, if indeed you have felt such.</p>
 <p><pb id="pg-05-161" n="05:161"/>Jamie came up from Scotsbrig with some sort of Colt to turn out to grass here for winter, and as Mary, and with less determination I myself, had been talking of a journey to Scotsbrig, we all three yoked Larry into the gig, this day week, and set forth thitherward, more to our own satisfaction than to that of Larry, who however being in good condition ran very handsomely. At Dumfries we found your Letter, and read it in our inn, over a glass of beer (Jamie, tho#x2019; no Temperance-Society man, having as good as forsworn alcohol); and all agreed that it was the best news we had heard for many a day. At Scotsbrig, our Mother came bounding out to meet us; our Father too was greatly recovered, indeed seemed to be as well as he has been for a long time; all the rest were in their usual state of health. The Harvest was but on the point of beginning with them, and that was but their first day of peat-carting, so wet had the Summer been: however, there was a very handsome crop standing on its feet for them, their Landlord they had <hi rend="italic">met</hi> with the suitable <hi rend="italic">face</hi>, and on the whole were much better to do than most others. My Father#x2019;s complaint had been nothing else than some sort of Dyspepsy; and it has now left him, chiefly I believe by aid of a better diet, for he has forsworn bread-and-milk, and takes his Tea night and morning, with our Mother, quite cheerily as if that had always been the fashion.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;His father had hitherto despised the taking of tea as an absurd and effeminate practice&#x201D; (Mary Aitken Carlyle#x2019;s note).</note> He has recovered his spirits too, and <hi rend="italic">voice</hi>, and talked with me a <foreign><hi rend="italic">langes und breites</hi></foreign> [at length] thro#x2019; the whole Sunday. I read them your Letter, and in returning from the preaching, they found another for my Mother, which also was eagerly consumed, and for which your good Correspondent charged me repeatedly to express her high thankfulness, and wishes to hear from you often and always. It would have done your heart good to see the gladness with which all listened to the good tidings you sent; the true hopes and prayers with which all seemed to look into your future. The <foreign><hi rend="italic">religiosen B&#xfc;cher</hi></foreign> [religious books], which came safe at the appointed day, I had of my own accord taken down to Scotsbrig; also your two Magazine Papers on &#x2018;St John Long#x2019; and &#x2018;Animal Magnetism,#x2019;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;On Medical Quackery and Mr. St. John Long,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Fraser#x2019;s Magazine</hi>, I (<date when="1830-05-00">May 1830</date>), 451&#x2013;56, and &#x201C;Animal Magnetism,&#x201D; I (<date when="1830-07-00">July 1830</date>), 673&#x2013;84. John#x2019;s earlier article on animal magnetism had appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Review</hi> for <date when="1829-12-00">Dec. 1829</date>. For John St. John Long (<date when="1798-00-00">1798</date>&#x2013;<date when="1834-00-00">1834</date>), London physician of highly dubious methods, see the <ref target="volume-05/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/16971"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>. He appears in <hi rend="italic">Past and Present</hi>.</note> which last were approvingly read there. The good people are also grown great Politicians, on the strength of your Newspapers, which even our Father reads with avidity: of late I have generally sent them down the <pb id="pg-05-162" n="05:162"/><hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, which they declare to be the King of the whole. His Honour#x2019;s controversy with Sir Anthony<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Matthew Sharpe#x2019;s controversy with an unidentified Sir Anthony.</note> had amused them much, for Graham after reading it had sent down the Papers: &#x2018;it was quite like one of our old Hill Letters,#x2019;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably Mainhill.</note> they said; a tankard of the smallest <foreign><hi rend="italic">wheep</hi></foreign> [weakest beer] churned into froth, tho#x2019; before run sour. I could not but laugh heartily, and call it the <hi rend="italic">prodooction of a rude alidge</hi>,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >I.e., &#x201C;rude ullage,&#x201D; apparently meaning mere dregs.</note> on Sir Anthony#x2019;s part, for he is the real brewer.</p>
<p>Here, however, I must introduce a little episode to thank you in my own and the Anderson#x2019;s name for your great talent and success as a <hi rend="italic">Commission-man</hi>. No action you ever did of the like magnitude gave greater pleasure than that Stroquhan Letter.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John#x2019;s letter to the family bringing joyful news concerning the long-lost ship <hi rend="italic">Bridgewater</hi> and the Anderson kin on her.</note> Mrs Whigham and Mrs Mundell gallopped up with it the day it came, where at Stroquhan it was like a reprieve from death, and &#x2018;kept them awake all night#x2019; with the joyfullest tumult: they sent their maid gallopping up hither with it, and the whole Glen knew the tidings before sunset. Your fame here has become great, their gratitude to you is boundless. They have since had a multiplicity of Letters, one from their Brother himself, who had got to Calcutta, and expected to find a passage directly, so that he may be here in some six weeks. They wish much he could see you in London, where it might be in his power they think to do you some good. Miss Anderson yesterday pressed this point much upon me; of which I promised to give you notice, and said that you might easily leave your card for him at a Sir Something Reid#x2019;s (from this County) at whose Counting-house he is sure to be. However, they said he would be back in London speedily, and at all events would then see you with greater deliberation. We are all very glad at these things, and proud that you have had a share in them. Farther, the Book-parcel, which as you may have inferred came duly according to announcement, was an acceptable and well managed thing. The Advertisements and other social rubbage (<foreign><hi rend="italic">d&#xE9;bris</hi></foreign>) of your monstrous Babylon were very welcome to me: in your packet, as in a Cockle-shell, one might hear the mighty roar of the Ocean they had come from, which here lies so distant. Jane thanks you kindly for your Book; rejoices, as we all do, that you have now got your hand to the plough, and sends you all manner of good wishes and encouragements for your warfare.</p>
<p>But now to return to my Narrative. On Monday morning Grahame<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Graham of Burnswark.</note> <pb id="pg-05-163" n="05:163"/>came down to breakfast, read your &#x2018;St John Long,#x2019; and insisted on my riding up with him to Grange:<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >To visit the William Johnstons.</note> we went by Waterbeck and Torbeckhill, over the wet moor; had a meek, gently pleasant afternoon; I returned about eight o#x2019;clock, and found&#x2014;O wonder and terror&#x2014;an Express from Dumfries with tidings that the Jeffreys had notified that they would all be at Craigenputtoch that night! Of the riding and running, the scouring and scraping and Caleb-Balderstone<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Caleb Balderstone is the ingenious male servant of the Ravenswood family in Scott#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">The Bride of Lammermoor</hi> (<date when="1819-00-00">1819</date>).</note> arranging my unfortunate but shifty and invincible Goody must have had I say nothing: enough, she is the cleverest of housewives, and might put innumerable Blues to shame. I set out next morning, taking Jean with me instead of Mary, who is not very well; and on arriving here, actually found the Dean of Faculty with his Adherents sitting comfortably in a house swept and garnished, awaiting my arrival. Of the <foreign><hi rend="italic">shine</hi></foreign> [party] itself I have room for no description: it all went prosperously on, and yesterday morning they set out homeward, reducing us instantly to our own more commodious farthing rushlight, which is our usual illumination. The worthy Dean is not very well, and I fear not very happy, and we all like him even <hi rend="italic">better</hi> than we did. He is the most sparkling pleasant little fellow I ever saw in life; a sort of Goldoni;<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlo Goldoni (<date when="1707-00-00">1707</date>&#x2013;<date when="1793-00-00">93</date>), creator of modern Italian comedy in the style of Moli&#xE8;re. For Carlyle#x2019;s other accounts of Jeffrey#x2019;s visit, see <hi rend="italic">Two Note Books</hi>, pp. 173&#x2013;76, and <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi>, II, 248&#x2013;51.</note> or Southern Comic Minstrel, an Italian Poet or even Poem. But you are to hear from him in person directly: he has got a Letter from Hazzlitt [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>], strangely requesting &#xa3;100 from him; and determines to consult you on the subject, and in the mean time to send &#xa3;50 thro#x2019; your hands. What is the matter with Hazzlitt? What communing have you with him? Poor Galloway! is Hazzlitt too going that way?<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John had written: &#x201C;Did I tell you in my last letter that your old acquaintance <supplied>[Alexander]</supplied> Galloway is in a Mad house in Fife. Poor Hazlitt is extremely ill at present, and I see him often tho#x2019; there is nothing I can do for him. Let us bless God that with all our difficulties we are kept from such extremes.&#x201D; Wilson says that Hazlitt sent this note to Jeffrey: &#x201C;Dear Sir, I am dying: can you send me &#xa3;100, and so consummate your many kindnesses to me?&#x2014;W. Hazlitt&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi>, II, 180). All editions and the manuscript of the <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> give the figure requested as &#xa3;10, which has usually misled Hazlitt#x2019;s biographers.</note>&#x2014; Jeffrey will also tell you about the <foreign><hi rend="italic">Magnetischen B&#xfc;cher</hi></foreign>,<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Books on animal magnetism.</note> which I gathered up into a Parcel (there were three red volumes and three blue, all that I could find or hear of), and gave him to deliver to Black in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, who would send them on by the first steamboat parcel (he <pb id="pg-05-164" n="05:164"/>supposed very soon): if you want them <hi rend="italic">instantly</hi>, write, in your answer to Jeffrey, and for some shillings you will get them by the Mail. Jeffrey also took my whole <hi rend="italic">Lit. Hist. Ms</hi>. with him, being eager to have it published by Longman or some one, if he thought it would do. I think not, and have already made up my mind to that negative issue. Here too I may mention that I have had some unsatisfactory correspondence with Editor Cochrane<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >J. G. Cochrane, editor of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Quarterly Review</hi>, had written on <date when="1830-09-11">11 Sept.</date>: &#x201C;With respect to <hi rend="italic">Reineke de Vos</hi>, I presume, altho#x2019; you do not expressly say so, that your lucubrations have extended much beyond the space which I mentioned to you as desirable that the article should occupy.&#x201D; He added that he did not like &#x201C;buying a pig in a poke&#x201D; but that he would like to see the article if Carlyle had not sent it to someone else.</note> on the subject of cutting it into <hi rend="italic">Articles</hi>, and about ten days ago, was obliged figuratively speaking to put him softly out of doors: however, he returns with a meeker face, and begs farther conference. I reckon him not a bad yet an altogether boorish man, with whom I am little careful to have farther trade, and that not as inferior or as equal can any right trade subsist between a writer and him. Happily we can do either way. I am going to <hi rend="italic">write something of my own;</hi><note n="15" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Immediately after the entry about Jeffrey#x2019;s visit in the <hi rend="italic">Two Note Books</hi>, ending on p. 176, Carlyle wrote: &#x201C;I am going to write&#x2014;Nonsense. It is on &#x2018;Clothes.#x2019; Heaven be my comforter!&#x2014;&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi> was begun.</note> I have sworn it. Meanwhile tell Fraser that I am <hi rend="italic">gathering</hi> little trifles for him, and shall send him somewhat by the first opportunity. It is a strange Magazine, all full of <hi rend="italic">Maginnism</hi>,<note n="16" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Derived from the name of William Maginn (<date when="1793-00-00">1793</date>&#x2013;<date when="1842-00-00">1842</date>), Irish journalist and poet, who helped to initiate <hi rend="italic">Fraser#x2019;s Magazine</hi> in <date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>.</note> yet with many good things, and very like selling: tell me if you can who manages it, who writes in it; how it works and has its being.</p>
<p>I am much gratified by your reported visit to Shooter#x2019;s Hill, whither I think you should frequently return. The people are among the worthiest, Mrs S. I continue to regard as an <foreign><hi rend="italic">Einzige</hi></foreign> [a unique person]. It gratifies me much to hear that they are my readers and approvers. Thank you for all your news; and see to send me more.<note n="17" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John had written: &#x201C;I was at Shooter#x2019;s Hill [country home of the Edward Stracheys near Woolwich] for two days last week &#x26; found Mrs Strachey in better health than in Spring<supplied>[.]</supplied> It seemed as if my arrival was very welcome. Mr Strachey whom I had not seen at Shooter<supplied>[#x2019;]</supplied>s Hill before was extremely kind. A Lady Louis [born Clementina Kirkpatrick and wife of Admiral Sir John Louis] sister of Mrs Strachey was also there. All were enquiring about you. Lady Louis you might call a &#x2018;mystic#x2019; in the best sense. She had read all your papers in the Foreign Review &#x2018;with much admiration,#x2019; and had derived &#x2018;much instruction from them.#x2019; The last on Richter she had found especially interesting. &#x2018;Voltaire#x2019; they seemed scarcely able to appreciate, and seemed to wonder that such a person as he should deserve such a long discussion. I enquired for Miss Kitty [formerly Kirkpatrick, now Mrs. Phillipps]&#x2014;that was&#x2014;and was told she is living at Exeter, and about to be confined of her first child, having invited Mrs Strachey to be present on the occasion:&#x2014; Lady Louis is lik<supplied>[e]</supplied> Mrs Buller all magnified, but is quite natural in her whole deportment.&#x201D;
<p>John had also written: &#x201C;I have left the MS. of &#x2018;Schiller#x2019; in <supplied>[James]</supplied> Fraser#x2019;s hands &#x26; he is to insert it in the Magazine of this month&#x2014;if not I will get it from him. As soon as this Schiller is fairly printed &#x26; paid, I think you ought to persist in your resolution of negociating no more through <supplied>[William]</supplied> Frazer [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] for the reasons I mentioned in my last letter. He has the best intentions possible but is too uncertain &#x26; unfortunate in his negociations to be depended upon. I believe the other tale [&#x201C;Cruthers and Jonson&#x201D;] will also be printed in this number.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I go frequently to Montagu#x2019;s of an evening, and seem to get on very well with Mrs Montagu and certainly well with Mr Montagu. Badams I also see frequently tho#x2019; he is extremely busy as usual. He has got to do with a number of silly useless people who trouble him not a little. I wish he were free of all these speculators, for he is a good man and they are totally unworthy to have any thing to do with him. Irving left this for Ireland with his wife &#x26; child about ten days ago&#x2014;purposing to preach to the Catholics.&#x201D;</p></note> <pb id="pg-05-165" n="05:165"/>What is George Irving doing, whom you have not mentioned for many months? I fear the Orator#x2019;s onslaught on the Pope will profit little: <foreign><hi rend="italic">warum die Todten t&#xF6;dten</hi></foreign> [why kill the dead]?</p>
<p>I had innumerable things to say, but must now restrict myself to one single point: Mary#x2019;s indisposition, above alluded to, on which we know not whom to consult. <hi rend="italic">Since Whitsunday she has had no Period:</hi> this surely is an alarming state. She herself does not seem to complain much; does her work, is not graver than usual; only seems a little <hi rend="italic">puffy</hi> in flesh, and has headaches more frequently. Mrs Welsh prescribed a course of Magnesia, which however after three weeks of constant trial, did no good: I promised to our Mother that I would write to you, and that you would write again with your best advice. Mary was once that way for six months before; but recovered herself whenever she came to the country&#x2014;out of Dumfries where she then lived. Counsel her for the best; she is to be <hi rend="italic">here</hi> after Tuesday.&#x2014; <closer><salute>No more, dear Brother, but my blessing!</salute></closer></p>
<ps><p>[Postscript:] You will not fail to tell us minutely of your progress, or no-progress, which is all that we can expect for a time.

It is the very place for you. Be of good courage, my dear Brother, and neither fear of the Future nor hope of it, but feel that <hi rend="italic">you are at work</hi>, and defy it. Our united blessings are with you.</p>
<p>Write minutely: next time I will tell you all that I am scheming <pb id="pg-05-166" n="05:166"/>about winter#x2019;s work; I have yet fixed on nothing; but must and will fix, and&#x2014;execute too. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Ille labor</hi></foreign> [That is the task]!<note n="18" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly an echo of &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Hoc opus, hic labor est</hi></foreign>&#x201D; (Vergil, <hi rend="italic">Aeneid</hi>, VI, 129).</note></p>

<salute>My Dear Mother,</salute>
<p><hi rend="italic">Jean</hi>, who with Alick is about setting out eastward, insists that I shall write you a few lines for her to carry down. This seems a wonderful arrangement, when Couriers are passing so rife (for instance, Rob Haining<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Hanning, who later married Carlyle#x2019;s sister Janet.</note> yesterday), and all manner of news can be learned by verbal questioning: however, being assured that it will yield you some satisfaction, I willingly comply.</p>
<p>You would learn from Jamie not only that <hi rend="italic">Jean</hi> and I arrived safe behind Larry; but farther that the other <hi rend="italic">Jeannie</hi> and I were down at Dumfries by the same conveyance; having bartered Harry on that occasion, who however as we have since ascertained is both able and willing to draw the gig himself. We expect to have him down at Scotsbrig, in that way, perhaps more than once during the course of winter.</p>
<p>That night, after looking at all the huge Bullocks and strange human Creatures assembled in Dumfries, Jane and I were mounted and on the way home sometime before eight o#x2019;clock: nevertheless, as has been said, &#x2018;you know where you begin the ride, not where you end it#x2019;; accordingly we had not got the length of Ichabod#x2019;s,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably a nickname for a local resident, perhaps either a schoolmaster or someone whom the Carlyles thought inglorious. Cf. 1 Sam. 4:21, and Washington Irving#x2019;s &#x201C;The Legend of Sleepy Hollow&#x201D; (<date when="1820-00-00">1820</date>), where the nag of the schoolmaster Ichabod Crane, returning home at the &#x201C;witching time of night,&#x201D; refuses to cross a bridge and makes rather &#x201C;a lateral movement.&#x201D; The moral of the tale, though not stated by Irving in these terms, is close to Carlyle#x2019;s &#x201C;you know where you begin the ride, not where you end it.&#x201D;</note> where <pb id="pg-05-167" n="05:167"/>our Dunscore Road turns off the great Mail Road, when I half jesting proposed that we should rather drive to Templand, the way being shorter, and smoother for a drive in the dark, and my helpmate having agreed to be there, at any rate, before the end of the week. Assent was readily given (three several times) to this proposal: so away we went for Templand; where Larry, in the most handsome manner, landed us quite comfortably about ten o#x2019;clock.

Her Father is very frail; otherwise things seem much in their old state. I do not think she has yet stirred at all in the Craigenputtoch business: neither, as it appears to me, has she the smallest wish to part with Alick, if he could make her any reasonable proposal. However, she is a person I cannot speak with in regard to such affairs. Alick, I think, ought to make up his own mind, as soon as he can, and say or at least guess what is in his power, and what not.</p>
<p>You would hear that the Jeffreys had come and gone: they arrived that very monday night, and I found them all sitting in state, when I got here. Jeffrey was more than usually friendly and interesting; he left us, and we were left, with real regret. Jane found your butter and eggs of essential service; and on the whole gives many thanks both to Providence (who watches the fall of sparrows)<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Matt. 10:29.</note> and to fellow men.

He has already written to Jack (whom he seemed to like well) about one Hazlitt, an unfortunate literary man, whom Jack seemed to be attending as Doctor; to whom Jeffrey was sending money, but who, as I see by a mark in the last <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, is now dead; so that the charitable aid would come too late.&#x2014; The worthy Dean of Faculty (for that is our Duke#x2019;s title) inquired about you all, very kindly, not of me but of Jane: I reckon him one of the best persons, practically considered, that I have ever seen; also that he is growing &#x2018;sadder and wiser#x2019;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coleridge, &#x201C;The Rime of the Ancient Mariner,&#x201D; l. 624.</note> as he increases in years.</p>

<p>We have no farther word from Jack, except the regular <hi rend="italic">Newspaper:</hi> I partly look for a Letter next week; I will send you notice of it as soon after as I have opportunity.&#x2014; Meanwhile, my Dear Mother, let me repeat Jack#x2019;s advice to my Father and you: to take care of yourselves, at this horrid season of the year, so threatening every way, so unwholesome for all weakly people.

<salute>My Dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Knowing your appetite for Letters, I will write you a Line or two tonight, tho#x2019; I have nothing to say: it will at least be a sign to you that we are still in life, and mindful of you.</p>
<p>That day Jane left us, I had a Letter from Jack;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> one of his hasty scratches of letters, wherein the pen is indeed hurried over the paper, and some form of writing effected, but the smallest possible quantity of knowledge imparted. He says he is &#x2018;in pretty good health and busy in his way,#x2019; tho#x2019; in <hi rend="italic">what</hi> way, or to what purpose he says not. He &#x2018;will write again,#x2019; &#x2018;more at large next time,#x2019; and so forth. However he sends a Receipt for some Pills to Mary, which Pills we have actually procured from Dumfries, and she has now been taking for above a week. I would have sent you the Doctor#x2019;s Letter; but it has been mislaid somewhere, and is not worth a long search. I mean to give him a touch of real lecturing next time I write, for sending us such meagre rags of Letters, hardly worth the paper they are scribbled on; more especially when we are all so anxious about his progress: however, I will remember too that he has many anxieties of his own at present, and may sometimes find his wits rather gone a-woolgathering when he takes up the pen. I still hope he will improve in Letter-writing, as in all things. A true affection he has for all of us, and takes many ways of showing it; tho#x2019; too remiss in that one way. He seems to have some scheme of writing a Volume on the <hi rend="italic">History of Medicine</hi> for a great London Bookseller, but has not yet brought it to maturity. He is getting ready some other things for the <hi rend="italic">Magazine</hi>. Of his Lodgings, his Practice, or want of Practice, he does not communicate even a whisper.</p>
<p>No doubt, one of your chief cares here at present is Mary. I said that she had begun taking her Pills; which, as yet, has produced no <pb id="pg-05-170" n="05:170"/>removal of the symptoms: otherwise she seems to be in good spirits; says her headaches do not disturb her now; and appears to complain of nothing. She works a good deal with Alick on the corn-rig [field-strip of oats]; she has been out this very day, I suppose at the Cattle-shed, building a Hay-stack; they were not home at dusk, but the doors all locked. Jack said the complaint was not dangerous; but if long-continued would derange the general health. He said farther that Medicine could do little or nothing for it; the best plan was general care; riding also he recommended, and occasional shearing [sheaving?] in ha<supplied>[r]</supplied>vest-time. I explained all this to her; Jane also enforced it; and she herself seems inclined to be punctual: so we shall hope there will nothing go amiss in this case; for the present, at least, there seems no cause of apprehension. You may <hi rend="italic">depend</hi> on my letting you know instantly should such appear.</p>
<p>Thus we are all in what we call Health, and have no News; which is sometimes said to be the best kind of News. Alick has a Harvestman (John Ker<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Also spelled Kerr.</note> that was once with Mrs Welsh) Samuel#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">ribs</hi> not having healed; our nondescript Servant assists him: they mow most of the stuff, and expect to have done this week. Some of his oats (in Bratney) he reckons about the best he ever saw. He has made a load of meal from them; which is not bad; only that the hungry Miller has stolen to <hi rend="italic">too</hi> great a length: <hi rend="italic">six stones</hi>, as Alick counts, out of twenty. The next <hi rend="italic">melder</hi> [the quantity of oats ground at one time] he purposes taking to Dumfrie<supplied>[s]</supplied> which, we all think, will be the best plan.</p>
<p>I called our present servant a Nondescript: he is not Bretton, <supplied>[who]</supplied> has gone (poor slut!) to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> to seek a place, with all the helps and recommendations we could give him; and has got this yellow Boy, a strange rat-eyed, bandylegged, foursquare little figure, named &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">Jamie Lockie</hi> from Ecclefechan,#x2019; to supply his place. It was some time before I recognised in him the unlawful progeny of Bogside Lockie, and the bearded woman Latimer, whose very picture he is, in breeches. How human things grow! The last time I saw this subject, you might have crushed him into a Boot; now, it were a considerable Box-churn that would hold him. He seems to be fit for little or no work: but Alick says <hi rend="italic">any</hi> kind of hand is useful on the Rig at present; so I have sent him thither, and see little or nothing of him.</p>
<p>The Wife and I are very quiet here, and accustoming ourselves, as fast as we can, to the stillness of Winter, which is fast coming on. These are the grayest, most silent days I ever saw: My Besom, as I <pb id="pg-05-171" n="05:171"/>sweep up the withered leaves, might be heard at a furlong#x2019;s distance. The woods are getting very party-coloured, the old trees quite bare; all witnesses that another year has travelled away. What good and evil has it brought us! May God sanctify them both to every one of us! I study not to get too <foreign><hi rend="italic">wae</hi></foreign> [depressed]; but often I think of many solemn and sad things, which indeed I do not wish to forget. We are <hi rend="italic">all</hi> in God#x2019;s hand; otherwise this world, which is but wholly a valley of the Shadow of Death,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ps. 23:4.</note> were too frightful. Why should we fear? Let us <hi rend="italic">hope;</hi> we are in &#x2018;the Place of Hope,#x2019; our Life is a Hope.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. &#x201C;The Everlasting No&#x201D; in Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi>, pp. 158&#x2013;59, and <ref target="volume-05/lt-18301027-TC-ADBM-01">TC to ADBM, <date when="1830-10-27">27 Oct.</date></ref> Carlyle#x2019;s insistence upon hope may recall the last line&#x2014;&#x201C;We bid you be of hope&#x201D;&#x2014;of the poem by Goethe referred to in <ref target="volume-05/lt-18300831-TC-G-01">TC to G, <date when="1830-08-31">31 Aug.</date></ref> His paraphrasing Teufelsdr&#xF6;ckh in this letter suggests that &#x201C;The Everlasting No&#x201D; may have been one of the first chapters of <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi> written.</note></p>
<p>But far better than all reasonings for cheerfulness is the diligence I use in following my daily Business. For the last three weeks I have been writing by taskwork again, and get along wonderfully well: what it is to be I cannot yet tell,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >It is to be <hi rend="italic">Sartor Resartus</hi>.</note> whether a Book or a string of Magazine Articles; we hope, the former; but in either case, it may be worth something. I will send you Luther#x2019;s Hymn which I have translated into verse;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Published as &#x201C;Luther#x2019;s Psalm&#x201D; with commentary in <hi rend="italic">Fraser#x2019;s Magazine</hi>, II (<date when="1831-01-00">Jan. 1831</date>), 743&#x2013;44; and republished in <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XXVII, 160&#x2013;64. Dyer notes that by <date when="1899-00-00">1899</date> this translation had appeared in ten of the twenty-four principal hymn books used in Great Britain and America.</note> Luther made the Music too, but that I have not.&#x2014; It is needless to ask you about your health or my Father#x2019;s; for none will answer me. Let me repeat John#x2019;s caution to him and you to take <hi rend="italic">double care</hi> at this season. God bless you all! <closer><salute>Ever your affectionate Son,</salute></closer></p>
<name>T. Carlyle&#x2014;</name>
<ps><p>Jane and I talk of coming down by and by. Jeffrey has yet written nothing about my German Book, but I expect to hear soon. Tell my Father that Alick will bring the Gig next him [<hi rend="italic">sic:</hi> time] he goes to Scotsbrig, and we must have him up hither: he can wrap himself effectually, so as to take no harm, and we will keep him in <hi rend="italic">hot</hi> enough quarters here.

<salute>My Dear Jack,</salute>
<p>I am going to write you, but nowise so short a Letter as you wrote me; tho#x2019; I too have some excuses; having already scribbled nearly twelve hours (Dumfries time) without rising; so that it is near ten o#x2019;clock, and I am tired enough. I had a commission from the whole kindred to <hi rend="italic">scold</hi> you heartily for these alltoo [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] short Letters; and to charge you with effective emphasis to mend them. In little Crow#x2019;s old words, I was to &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">tell</hi> our Brother John to write us, and to tell us <hi rend="italic">all</hi> he knows.#x2019;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Quoted from &#x201C;Crow Jean&#x201D; Carlyle#x2019;s poem written when she was twelve and dated <date when="1823-02-15">15 Feb. 1823</date>. See A. Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">LL</hi>, II, 352&#x2013;53, and 2:309&#x2013;10.</note> Much better were it could I discover the <hi rend="italic">reason</hi> of your brevity, and instead of blaming you for it, remove it. Did you see with what eager affection this whole establishment, and the whole Scotsbrig one gathers round a Letter of yours; and how mortifying is our disappointment, when we open it, and find the hastiest thinnest piece of work, totally unworthy of our Brother#x2019;s honest, solid, judicious Pen, and no account whatever of his situation to be got there,&#x2014;doubtless you would either reform the practice, or grieve considerably that you could not. I am aware of your frequent inevitable hurry and distraction; another cause too I can see at work, and respect tho#x2019; I regret it. You are not at ease in your own mind, my dear Brother; with a noble reserve you wish to keep your troubles to yourself; yet your heart being too full of them, you have nothing else to speak about copiously or coherently. Now, dear Jack, this is both right and not right. Right not to complain needlessly; not right to forbear complaining needfully, and above all to me. To whom would you open your sorrows, the only relief man can obtain from man, if not to your Brother? Do not close up your heart against me: speak the worst; if it be necessary I will keep your letters strictly to myself, and even destroy them so soon as read. You <hi rend="italic">can</hi> write so excellently: we have had some two Letters of that kind, since you left us. Believe me it is very good even for yourself to write heartily, and with consideration: I have experienced repeatedly that when I sat down to write of my affairs, and they seemed all chaotic, I have found the perplexity not a little abated when I had done. You are forced to <pb id="pg-05-173" n="05:173"/>gather up the scattered threads, to separate at least what you do know and see from what you do not; thus is the &#x2018;ravelled sleeve#x2019; of your purposes knit up somewhat,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Macbeth</hi>, II, ii: &#x201C;Sleep that knits up the ravell#x2019;d sleave of care.&#x201D;</note> and the future plainer to you. Another reason of a quite selfish nature on my part will also have its weight with you: At this time you are one of my chief Prison-windows, almost the only one; thro#x2019; which I can look clearly into the business of the world: hast thou the heart, Jack, to shut thyself, and instead of glass to clap in old stockings?<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In the country, the small windows of the time were often broken and the lozenge panes mended by being stuffed with cloth (&#x201C;old stockings&#x201D;) or straw.</note> No: thou hast not.</p>
<p>In conclusion, let me entreat for no more apologies, no more promises: <hi rend="italic">do it</hi>, and leave talking of doing it. Finally, dear Jack, accept this wellmeant lecture, from an elder Brother, in good part; and be not angry with me. Nay, I know your last Letter was perhaps hurried, on Mary#x2019;s account, and so was not specially blameable. Above all, write, write, were it never so little! Better the poorest line, than none at all: this too we feel. And so&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">Amen!</hi>&#x2014;</p>
<p>We are shocked to find that the magnanimous Montague, who was to <hi rend="italic">lend</hi> you money to all lengths, does not so much as <hi rend="italic">pay</hi> you what he owes!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John appears to have told Carlyle about this in his last letter, which has been lost.</note> It seems inexpressibly inconsiderate, or inexpressibly shabby. Would to Heaven, my poor Doil, I had the means of making it good! But never mind: keep a heart and a spirit; perhaps even Poverty will one day lighten her pressure on us; and, if she do not, hang her let her do the other way! Cannot a <hi rend="italic">man</hi> afford to be poor, whatever a dandy can? We shall realize scot and lot [pay our dues], and more is required of no mortal, even in this age. So be not a whit ashamed, Doctor, even tho#x2019; you should find <hi rend="italic">no</hi> success whatever: in all probability it <hi rend="italic">will</hi> come; and if it never come, I tell thee man it is for our good. &#x2018;Meet him with an impudent face#x2019;;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably a phrase from John#x2019;s lost letter.</note> and tho#x2019; it were but twenty pounds a year that made you &#x2018;impudent,#x2019; the world or the Devil himself has no farther business with you. Meanwhile I rejoice to hear of your Magazine writing; still more of that <hi rend="italic">History of Medicine</hi>, which I hope will take effect: I reckon that you would make a handsome volume of it; which also might do you good otherwise. We are very anxious to know how you like your Lodgings: whether indeed <hi rend="italic">you are fairly settled in them</hi>, for that does not appear from your Letter. Have you yet written to Jeffrey? I think you are wrong in declining <pb id="pg-05-174" n="05:174"/>(the Indian) Anderson#x2019;s introductions:<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Anderson of Stroquhan who had been on the long-lost ship <hi rend="italic">Bridgewater</hi> sailing from India and who had offered his services in John#x2019;s behalf.</note> living here or living there, what you want is to be <hi rend="italic">Known</hi>, and the more widely the better. The Andersons feel exceedingly obliged to you, and are aware already that you have <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> save your own literary efforts to live on; and they respect you the more on that account. Anderson has arrived safe at Liverpool, and is expected here in a few days; then in the course of the winter to London; where, his sister again emphatically repeats, he will make a point of seeing you. This individually is a small matter; but acted upon, as a general rule, it would become a great one. Now tell us honestly whether you have ever yet got a patient, or realized one shilling by Medicine. Also never mind if you answer, NO. Only do answer; and the first fee you have, we will all pledge you in a bumper of our best. O explain to us, Jack! Explain to us!<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Actually John had had practically no patients except the impecunious William Hazlitt who had died on <date when="1830-09-18">18 Sept.</date></note></p>
<p>I must now give you a touch of home news [<hi rend="italic">Enter</hi> &#x2018;<hi rend="small-caps">Supper#x2019;s-ready-Sir</hi>#x2019;! Good by for five minutes.]<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle#x2019;s brackets.</note>&#x2014; I return, as you see, and recommence. First, of poor Mary: she got her pills, then a second stock, and took about thirty in all; when I bade her stop till we heard farther. That was the day before yesterday. She has yet, as I learn by innuendo, had no deliverance. The pills gave her considerable griping, headaches also, but produced little purgative effect, and brought about no <hi rend="italic">return</hi>. She strove on the rig<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ridge, i.e., she was reaping on the strip of field.</note> almost every afternoon, and rode sometimes. She now looks better than she did during the pills; says there is nothing ails her, and so forth. She eats almost no meat, as indeed she has long been wont to do; neither is she in lively spirits: but on the whole there is little difference perceptible in her from her old wont; nevertheless I am not without my anxieties. We will hope the best. She is to get Mrs Welsh#x2019;s little pony on Sunday, by her own desire, and try riding. If you can advise aught farther, do it.&#x2014; As for Alick he has been the busiest during these two fine weeks, and has all his crop cut (which is a <hi rend="italic">good</hi> crop), and part of it in; nay it was on meal of his that I supped the other minute. I still hear the thunder of his threshing-mill; he was <hi rend="italic">inning</hi> [bringing in corn from the field], and the day grew wet.

I think it not impossible that I may see you this winter in London! I mean to come whenever I can spare the money; that I may look about me again among men for a little. Here too I feel sometimes that I make progress, and get better insight. Keep your thumb on [keep quiet about] this <hi rend="italic">journey</hi>, till we see how it turns. What I am writing at is the strangest of all things: begun as an Article for <hi rend="italic">Fraser</hi>; then found to be too long (except it were divided into two); now sometimes looking almost, as if it would swell into a Book. A very singular piece, I assure you!

<salute>My Honoured Friend,</salute>
<p>From the first sentence of your otherwise most welcome Letter, I draw the unpleasant apprehension that mine of <date when="1830-08-00">August</date> last has failed to reach you.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle forgot that <ref target="volume-05/lt-18300831-TC-G-01">his previous letter</ref> was not written until <date when="1830-08-31">31 Aug.</date> so that it could hardly have reached Weimar by early in <date when="1830-09-00">Sept.</date> Goethe probably received it soon after the despatch of his letter of <date when="1830-10-05">5 Oct.</date> The time normally taken for letters varied with the season and the manner of conveyance, but appears to have been at least two or three weeks. Cf.Goethe to TC, <date when="1830-06-06">6 June 1830</date>, in Norton, <hi rend="italic">GC</hi>, p. 200.</note> The like, it is true, never happened in our past correspondence: nevertheless to such accidents we are ever liable; at all events, this suspicion of neglect, under which I may have fallen, is of such a sort that I lose not a moment in removing it. Did no Letter for you, then, arrive in the beginning of <date when="1830-09-00">September</date>; announcing that your Packet of the <date when="1830-06-13">13<hi rend="italic">th</hi> June</date>, and Letter of the <date when="1830-06-07">7<hi rend="italic">th</hi></date>, had both happily come to hand; and been received with the old feelings of thankfulness and gladness, which such expressions of your regard must ever merit from us? I will still hope so: for the Letter, of which unluckily I have kept no memorandum, and cannot more accurately specify the date, was without any doubt despatched hence, and safely committed to the Post-Office; after which, so punctual are the rules and arrangements of that Establishment, there seems no probability of miscarriage on this side the German Shore; except, indeed, <pb id="pg-05-177" n="05:177"/>one of our Mail-Ships had been wrecked; of which in the Newspapers I observed no notice. If such hope, which I still cherish, prove well-founded, let the present Letter be considered as a conscientious supererogation: in all things touching my duties of Gratitude towards you, I would willingly make assurance doubly sure. When the Packet, which we are now permitted shortly to expect, reaches us, I will write again. Meanwhile be pleased to entertain the conviction that our regard, our love for you is not susceptible of change or interruption; that few days, none perhaps wherein I am well employed, pass over me in these solitudes, without affectionate remembrances, and thoughts full of kindly veneration, for the Friend, who <foreign><hi rend="italic">fern im Lande</hi></foreign> [in a far away country]<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle echoes Goethe#x2019;s poem &#x201C;Zum Armband&#x201D; (&#x201C;With the Bracelet&#x201D;) for JWC, written <date when="1827-12-27">27 Dec. 1827</date> and the relevant lines translated by Norton as &#x201C;Bethink thee, too, in foreign land / Of him who you with love regards.&#x201D; See <ref target="volume-04/lt-18280420-TC-MAC-01"><sic>4:368</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1828-04-20">20 April 1828</date></corr></ref>.</note> sometimes also thinks of us.</p>
<p>In this Letter are two prophetic allusions breathing a noble pathetic dignity, which nevertheless affect me with alarm and pain.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Goethe had written (Norton#x2019;s trans.): &#x201C;I hope you will be satisfied with the mode in which I wished to see you and my Berlin friends in active and fruitful communication. At my age I cannot but be anxious to see the many relations, which have woven themselves around me, knit up anew elsewhere, and to promote, were it only by private efforts, often impeded, what every good man desires, and must desire, the diffusion of a certain morally liberal harmony of sentiment throughout the world; so that by this means many things may quietly adjust themselves, instead of being scattered hither and thither at first so as to make it almost impossible, after great loss, to set them right again&#x201D; (pp. 220&#x2013;21). And again at the end of his letter: &#x201C;Fare you right well; write soon, for days and weeks are becoming more and more precious to me&#x201D; (p. 223).</note> Far distant be that day so mournful for us, and for millions! It is true, I might ask myself: What are you to me but a Voice; and is not that Voice one of those that cannot die? Will not also, when we are still more inaccessibly parted, the memory of past kindness abide, perennially sweet, with the survivor? Neither in any case do we sorrow as those that have no Hope.

But let us look away from these solemnities, which, however, the wise man at no moment forgets: the blessedness of Life is not in Living, <pb id="pg-05-178" n="05:178"/>but in Working well; and he to whom a Task, rarely exampled in the history of men, was given, and who has done it, and is still doing it, &#x2018;looks both before and after#x2019;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi>, IV, iv: &#x201C;Sure, He that made us with such large discourse, / Looking before and after, gave us not / That capability and godlike reason / To fust in us unus#x2019;d.&#x201D;</note> with calm eyes, tho#x2019; the dew of &#x2018;natural tears#x2019;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi>, XII, 645: &#x201C;Some natural tears they dropped, but wiped them soon.&#x201D;</note> may gather there. We will hope and pray that a life so precious may be lengthened, in peaceful activity, to the utmost term; that long years of kind earthly brotherhood are still appointed us.</p>
<p>If my last Letter were not lost, it would convey to you in warm terms the admiration I felt for the <hi rend="italic">Schiller#x2019; sche Briefwechsel</hi> [<hi rend="italic">Correspondence with Schiller</hi>], which I was then on the point of finishing. A singularly kind Chance brought two such men into neighbourhood: their relation so full of generous helpfulness, and the highest Endeavour, is one which, especially in these times, it does us good to look upon; to you especially, as the more independent of the two, and by whom the sick, retiring, almost monastic Schiller was still held in some communion with the world, the lovers of Genius will feel deeply indebted; first for your friendly ministerings to this noble man; and now for perpetuating this record of so rare a union. In Schiller himself there is almost a spirit-like abstraction and elevation; yet a painful isolation, except from you, is also manifest: we could figure him as some Prometheus; stealing fire, indeed, from Heaven; but to whom also the Gods as punishment had sent chains and a gnawing vulture. How different was his fate from that of our own poor Burns, blest with an equal talent, as high a spirit; but smitten with a far heavier curse, and to whom no guiding Friend, warmly as his heart could love, and still long for Wisdom, was ever given! One such as you might have saved him, and nothing else could; but only the vain, the idle, the dissipated gathered round him, he was alone among his kind, and courage and patience at last failed him, and he lost all that made him man. He was of Schiller#x2019;s age: in the second year of that fair Weimar union, Burns perished miserably, deserted and disgraced, in that same Dumfries, where they have erected Mausoleums over him now that it is all unavailing, and would buy a scrap of his handwriting, as if it were Bank-paper. Such is the sad history which, in generation after generation, is too often repeated to us.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle was soon to write his long article &#x201C;Schiller,&#x201D; published in <date when="1831-03-00">March 1831</date> in <hi rend="italic">Fraser#x2019;s Magazine,</hi> ostensibly as a review of the <hi rend="italic">Briefwechsel zwischen Schiller und Goethe, in den Jahren <date when="1794-00-00">1794</date> bis</hi> <date when="1805-00-00">1805</date> which Goethe had sent him.</note></p>
<p><pb id="pg-05-179" n="05:179"/>Having here come upon Burns I will add my heartiest wishes, not unmixed with considerable fears of a negative result, that your young Translator may be successful with him.<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Philipp Kaufmann, said by Goethe to be a &#x201C;young man of much talent, and successful as a translator,&#x201D; in whom he took &#x201C;an eager interest&#x201D; (Norton, <hi rend="italic">GC</hi>, p. 223). He had already translated Shakespeare (<date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>). His translation of Burns was not published until <date when="1839-00-00">1839</date> as <hi rend="italic">Gedichte von Robert Burns</hi> (Stuttgart und T&#xfc;bingen).</note> The changeful, too fugitive expressiveness of his diction is one great charm with Burns; at all times hard to seize by a Translator, and no doubt doubly so when hidden in the rough guise of our Scottish provincial dialect. Besides his chief, indeed almost his only true Poetical Writings are Songs, which are of all the most unmanageable. Otherwise Burns is only a <foreign><hi rend="italic">Volksdichter</hi></foreign> <foreign>[folk-poet]</foreign>, more notable for shrewd sense, passionate attachment, and a certain rustic humour than any higher qualities.<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >By itself, this passage scarcely gives Carlyle#x2019;s balanced estimate of Burns. In his essay &#x201C;Burns&#x201D; published in the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review</hi> in <date when="1828-00-00">1828</date> he praises not only the songs but also in the most glowing terms &#x201C;The Jolly Beggars&#x201D; (see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XXVI, 284&#x2013;85). Furthermore in collected editions of his works later he greatly strengthened his praise of this poem by adding four sentences to the paragraph containing it, the last four in the final version.</note> I shall be full of curiosity to see your Countryman#x2019;s Version, the first I believe into any foreign tongue: if he fail, beyond the due limits of Poetical and Translatorial Licence, the highest kindness we can do him here will be to forget him; the whole British nation is passionately attached to Burns; the very Inn-windows where he chanced to scribble, in idle hours, with his versifying and often satirical Diamond, have all been un-glassed, and the scribbled panes sold into distant quarters, there to be hung up in frames! There is an infinite Dilettantism in the world; but also a certain indestructible universal Love for Spiritual Light, and &#x2018;Reverence for what is Above us.#x2019;<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. chap. X of <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister#x2019;s Travels:</hi> &#x201C;we inculcate a threefold Reverence, which, when commingled and formed into one whole, attains its highest force and effect. The first is Reverence for what is above us. &#x2026; The Religion which depends on reverence for what is above us, we denominate the Ethnic; it is the religion of the nations, and the first happy deliverance from a degrading fear: all Heathen religions, as we call them, are of this sort, whatsoever names they may bear&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XXIV, 265, 267). Both Schiller and Burns scorned the &#x201C;Dilettantism in the world&#x201D; and partook in the &#x201C;universal Love for Spiritual Light.&#x201D; See Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle and German Thought: <date when="1819-00-00">1819</date>&#x2013;<date when="1834-00-00">1834</date></hi> (New Haven, <date when="1934-00-00">1934</date>), pp. 224&#x2013;30, for a full analysis of the influence of Goethe#x2019;s &#x201C;three reverences&#x201D; upon Carlyle. Throughout his long life Carlyle continued to think of these passages in the <hi rend="italic">Wanderjahre</hi>, which he had translated in <date when="1826-00-00">1826</date>, as &#x201C;perhaps the most remarkable bit of writing which I have known to be executed in these late centuries&#x201D; &#x201C;Inaugural Address at Edinburgh,&#x201D; <date when="1866-00-00">1866</date>, in <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XXIX, 473).</note></p>

second time, for <hi rend="italic">Wachler</hi>, whom I find in my Historical studies, a solid, trustworthy and useful help. I mentioned, last time, that my German Literary History was, so far as concerned Publication, standing in a state of abeyance, the original Bibliopolic scheme, of which it formed part, having fallen to the ground. There is now another possibility of its being sent forth; as a Separate Work; which I shall like better. The negociation is not in my hands: but perhaps before the next Letter, I may have it in my power to communicate the issue. Meanwhile I have been engaged a little in other more ambitious enterprizes:<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The writing of <hi rend="italic">Sartor Resartus</hi>.</note> but whether the result may be a Book, or only a pair of Magazine Essays I cannot yet predict; but will mention in due time if it prove worthy of mention.</p>
<p>The news from Berlin, full particulars of which, with so many other interesting things, I expect by your Packet, could not be other than gratifying. To Friends recommended by you my best services must be always due: one of these men, if the name <hi rend="italic">Hitzig</hi> belongs to the Biographer of Hoffmann and Werner, is already favourably known to me. A Letter, according to your wish, with offer of heartiest cooperation in a work which I also reckon so important, shall not be wanting.<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Goethe had written (Norton#x2019;s trans.): &#x201C;Our Berlin friends have accepted my dedication of your <hi rend="italic">Life of Schiller</hi> very favourably, and are ready for all reciprocal communications. They have sent me a Diploma, in which they appoint Mr. Thomas Carlyle of Craigenputtock a foreign honorary member. This valuable document I will put in the next little box, which will probably reach you before the winter. &#x2026; Mr. Carlyle will, in accordance with my wish, say a friendly word to the worthy Berliners.&#x201D; Julius Eduard Hitzig (<date when="1780-00-00">1780</date>&#x2013;<date when="1849-00-00">1849</date>), a German jurist, had written biographies of his friends Hoffmann and Werner which Carlyle had praised for their fairness but which he had found not full enough (&#x201C;Life and Writings of Werner,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XXVI, 89; and &#x201C;E. T. W. Hoffmann,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XXII, 14 ff.).
<p>Hitzig had written to Goethe: &#x201C;In to-day#x2019;s meeting of the Society for Foreign Literature, Mr. Thomas Carlyle, of Craigenputtock, Scotland, was elected, by the unanimous vote of the members present, a Foreign Member of this Society. The Society confidently hopes that this distinguished scholar, in response to the invitation transmitted to him by Goethe, will readily give his assistance to the furtherance of its objects, so far as they are directed to the knowledge and diffusion of English literature in Germany, and of German in Great Britain, and thus actively unite in the effort to attain the common end of universal culture.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Mr. Carlyle is informed hereof by an extract from the minutes.</p>

<salute>My dear Friend,</salute>
<p>While I wait in the confident though somewhat unaccountably deferred anticipation of a kind answer from you to a kind message, come tidings to my wife, that such message is still only looked for &#x201C;thro#x2019; the portal of Hope,&#x201D; in plain prose, that my last letter has lost its way, did not reach and now never will reach you!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mrs. Montagu#x2019;s letter to Jane, postmarked <date when="1830-10-13">13 Oct.</date>, had embroidered the phrase and spoken of &#x201C;that portal, which leads to the temple of Hope.&#x201D; Carlyle#x2019;s lost letter must have been dated about <date when="1830-08-31">31 Aug.</date></note> This is the more singular, as the like never happened in my past experience, and now, as indeed misfortune usually does, comes doubly. Much about the time when I wrote your letter, I dispatched another to Weimar: and here on the same Wednesday night arrive, side by side, two announcements from you and from Goethe that both letters have miscarried! Goethe#x2019;s I have satisfactorily traced to the post-office and hope there <pb id="pg-05-182" n="05:182"/>may have been some oblivion on the part of my venerable correspondent; neither is this, though less likely in your case, a quite impossible supposition. At all events true it is that some two months ago I did actually write you a most densely filled letter, one which if it did me any justice must have been filled moreover with the friendliest sentiments. I can still recollect of it that I entreated earnestly you would never forget me, would from time to time send me notice of your good or evil fortune, tho#x2019; I myself (for lack of historical incident in these solitudes) were silent, assuring you, of what is still true, that <hi rend="italic">I</hi> was no wise of the forgetting species, but blessed or burdened with one of your perennial memories, and a hard and stony heart, whereon truly only <hi rend="italic">diamonds</hi> would write,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >This metaphor is in Carlyle#x2019;s letter to Mrs. Montagu of <date when="1830-06-03">3 June</date>.</note> but the Love-charm and Think-of-me once written stood ineffaceable, defying all time and weather. Such statement whereof I could make an Affidavit were it needful will be a light for you to explain several things, above all will absolve from the crime of indifference and negligence, which crime towards you at least, it will be for ever impossible for me to fall into. Believe this, for it is morally and even physiologically true.</p>
<p>We hear with real sorrow of the domestic mischances that come upon you, from which in this world no wisdom will secure us.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mrs. Montagu had said in her letter of <date when="1830-10-13">13 Oct.</date>: &#x201C;Evil days have been busy with us, and Care, who comes unbidden, has sat with us and been about our path and about our bed, and has not left us day or night&#x2014; Our infatuated Son Alfred Montagu, who made some years since a most disgraceful marriage<supplied>[,]</supplied> has followed up his misconduct by a series of frauds, which tho#x2019; we are not liable to, we must bear our part of&#x2014; to the amount of 3,000 &#xa3;&#x2014;I do not mention this even to our nearest friends. He has absconded and his hopeless, heartless conduct has almost broken his Father#x2019;s heart.&#x2014; We have had other causes for strong anxiety, and but for the consciousness of our having strained every nerve, and exerted every faculty to prevent the evils that have overtaken us, we should be utterly cast down.&#x201D;</note></p>
<p>Happily the consciousness you mention is a bulwark which keeps our inward citadel or proper Self unharmed, unimpregnable, whatever havoc there may be in the outworks. Let us study to maintain this and let those others go their way, which indeed, is natural for them. When I think of the miserable A. and of many like him, I could feel as if our old fathers who believed in witchcraft and Possession were nearer the truth than we.</p>
<p>It is strange how vice like a poisonous ingredient thrown into some fermenting mixture, will, in small beginnings seize on the young heart, and proceed there, tainting, enlarging, till the whole soul, and all the universe it holds is blackened, blasted, rent asunder with it, <pb id="pg-05-183" n="05:183"/>and the man, that walked in the midst of us, is clutched, as it were by some unseen devil, and hurled into abysses of Despair and Madness, which lie closer than we think on the path of everyone. Let us hope (for this is the Place of Hope)<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi>, pp. 158&#x2013;59, and <ref target="volume-05/lt-18301010-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1830-10-10">10 Oct.</date></ref> This paragraph reflects the mood of despair in &#x201C;The Everlasting No.&#x201D; Carlyle speaks of madness in similar terms in Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi>, p. 260.</note> that for himself reformation is still possible; that at least and worst to the friends that cannot save him, his future mis-doings will be harmless.</p>
<p>Poor Hazlitt!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mrs. Montagu had moralized thus upon the death of Hazlitt: &#x201C;Poor Hazlitt is gone, and <hi rend="italic">little</hi> men, who durst not have glanced his way, are now busy with his name, and are making bread out of his private History&#x2014;all his &#x2018;faults will be set down in note books,#x2019; and he may be placed on the same shelf with Byron when the scalping knife has done its worst, and his <hi rend="italic">friends</hi> have left nothing for his Enemies to say&#x2014; I have on this occasion a malicious pleasure in recollecting how free he made with them all, and that he too could wield a tomahawk, with a rare aim and an unsparing hand,&#x2014;leaving scars and laying skulls bare, that no fell of hair will cover&#x2014;but this can only be a momentary feeling; by &#x2018;Sin death came into the world, and all our woe,#x2019;&#x2014; Alas for Hazlitt, his wild lawless passions which became an untutored savage better than a cultivated man, have silently undermined his health, and a bitter sense of injury when a boy, and of misapplied talent when a Man, curdled all that should have been milky in his nature. This led him to personality, which alienated his best friends. The petty paltry vice of the present day, seems to be an itching desire to know all that is evil, and ridiculous in others, this hits all tastes, and a man who will lend himself to an unprincipled bookseller or publisher, is sure of &#x2018;present pay and good quarters#x2019; and if any Man is Quixotic enough to brand this conduct with its true Epithet, he may sleep in an early grave, like poor Scott, and his opponent may write on, like M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Lockhart, a &#x2018;prosperous gentleman.#x2019; &#x2026;
<p>&#x201C;Oh my dearest Jane what does your Husband owe to you, more than can be repaid by the anxious tenderness of a whole life&#x2014; He might have soured into a Hazlitt&#x2014;repeated disappointments would have hardened his heart, and the bitter part of his nature would have jaundiced the whole man&#x2014; You came, like a Poet#x2019;s dream, linking him to his kind, by the thought of all bonds at the same time that you realized many of his hopes and wishes. Long may you be a blessing to each other.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Hazlitt was a notorious controversialist and suffered much from personal attack&#x2014;from <hi rend="italic">Blackwood#x2019;s</hi>, for instance, with which Lockhart had been associated. See Mrs. Oliphant, <hi rend="italic">William Blackwood and His Sons</hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1897-00-00">1897</date>), I, 389, where Maginn writes to W. Blackwood of Hazlitt: &#x201C;You have called him pimpled, affected, ignorant, a Cockney scribbler, &#x26;c., but what is that to what he has said of the most brilliant men of the age?&#x201D;</p></note> He too, is one of the victims to the Moloch Spirit of this Time: a Time when Selfishness and Baseness, dizened out with rouge, and a little theatrical frippery, has fearlessly seated herself on high places, and preaches forth her Creed of Profit and Loss as the last Gospel for men;&#x2014;when the thing that calls itself God#x2019;s Church is a den of Unclean Beasts, from which the honest-hearted turns away with loathing;&#x2014;when between the Utilitarians and the Millenarians, <pb id="pg-05-184" n="05:184"/>and the dense dust and vapour they have raised up, the Temple of the Universe has become to the most invisible, and the devout spirit that will not blind itself, cannot worship, and knows not what or how to worship, and so wanders in aimless pilgrimages, and lives without God in the world!<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi>, p. 159 and <hi rend="italic">passim</hi>.</note> In Hazlitt, as in Byron and Burns and so many others in their degree, there lay some tone of the &#x201C;Eternal melodies,&#x201D;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The classical music of the spheres. Cf. Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi>, p. 263. Carlyle alludes here, in regard to Hazlitt, to what he had written to Goethe four days before in regard to Burns and Schiller: that he was one of those who had &#x201C;a certain indestructible universal Love for Spiritual Light, and &#x2018;Reverence for what is above us.#x2019;&#x201D;</note> which he could not fashion into terrestrial music, but which uttered itself only in harsh jarrings, and inarticulate cries of pain. Poor Hazlitt! There is one star less in the Heavens, tho#x2019; a twinkling, dimmed one; while the street-lamps and horn lanterns are all burning, with their whale-oil or coal gas, as before! These the street passenger and dray-man and bearer-of-burden will prize and bless: but in the lonely journeys and far voyages (of Thought) the traveller will miss the other.</p>
<p>I should give you some glimpse into our way of life here, but know not how in such compass to do it. A strange contrast it must be to yours. If London is the noisiest, busiest spot on the Earth, this is about the stillest and most solitary. The road hither <hi rend="italic">ends</hi> at our House: to see a lime-cart or market-cart struggling along the broken moor, till it reach gravel and wheel-ruts, and scents the Dominion of Commerce from afar, is an incident which, especially in winter, we almost mark in our journals. In this meek pale sunshine of October, in this grave-like silence, there is something ghostly; were it not that our meadows are of peat-bog and not of asphodel, and our hearts too full of earthly passions and cares, you might fancy it the abode of spirits, not of men and fleecy or hairy cattle. I have a rough broken path along the neighbouring hill-side, two miles in length, where I take a walk (sometimes as I would take physic) and see over Ayrshire and Galloway, far and wide, nothing but granite mountains and idle moors; save that here and there the cottage trees and smoke, with its patch of cornfield painfully won from the desert, indicate that man#x2019;s two hands are there, who, like the coney, has built himself a nest in the rocks.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Ps. 104:18: &#x201C;The high hills are a refuge for the wild goats; and the rocks for the conies.&#x201D;</note> On the whole an original scene for studying in. Private as heart could wish; and possessing in this one thought, that it positively <hi rend="italic">is</hi> a scene, <pb id="pg-05-185" n="05:185"/>and dates since the day when Eternity became Time, and was created by God,&#x2014;the source, could one but draw from it, of innumerable, inexhaustible others. Here, truly is the place for thinking, if you have any faculty that way: since I came hither I have seen into various things. In my wife, too, I have the clearest, most Scotch-logical, yet the eagerest Disciple and Convert. For the rest I read, and write, and smoke, assiduously as I was wont: one day, I hope to give you one of the most surprising <hi rend="italic">Books</hi> you have met with lately. Am I happy? My theory was and is that the man who cannot be happy (as happy as is needful) wheresoever God#x2019;s sky overspans him, and men forbear to beat him with bludgeons,&#x2014;deserves to be and will always be, what one calls miserable. Nevertheless, we are coming to London, so soon as the yet clearly audible prohibition of Destiny is withdrawn. Will it be this winter? Full glad were I to think so; but there are sad shakings of the head. We had the Jeffreys lately; <hi rend="italic">the</hi> Jeffrey a more interesting and better man; a sadder and a wiser; than I had ever seen him. That he missed <hi rend="italic">you</hi> was no oversight on his part, but ignorance that it would not be an intrusion.</p>
<p>He looked to Mr. Procter, and Mr. Procter spake not. The like will not occur a second time. Such a visit here, of which we rejoice in one or two perhaps yearly, is a true &#x201C;Illumination with the finest Transparencies&#x201D;:<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A transparency was a picture, print, inscription, or any device on a translucent substance made visible by a light behind.</note> next night, indeed, comes our own still candle, and the past splendour is gone like a dream, but not the memory of it, nor the hope of its return. With Goethe I am more contented the longer I know him; hard as adamant towards outer fortune, yet with the spirit of a prophet within, and the softest all-embracing heart.</p>
<p>He is to me the most venerable man now extant, surely the <hi rend="italic">only</hi> literary man, whom amid all my respect, my admiration, I can view without a considerable admixture of contempt. He tells me yesterday to write soon, &#x201C;for days and weeks are growing more and more precious to him.&#x201D;</p>
<p>God keep that day long distant!&#x2014;I must add this other passage for the piece of news it brings. Take it in the original too.</p>

<salute>My Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Allow me to offer you the following statement, which perhaps, in your Editorial capacity, may be of no disadvantage to you, and of some use to another person in whom I have good reason to take an interest.</p>
<p>A younger Brother of mine is settled in London as Physician; and being, like most incipient Physicians, nowise overburdened with practice, occupies his leisure, and helps to keep his Kitchen warm, by Literary work, more especially of a Medical or Medico-Scientific character, tho#x2019; for other and general branches, likewise, he is not without faculty. I cannot with any propriety dwell on the parts and attainments of one so related to me: however, I will mention that he has travelled over all Europe in quest of Knowledge<supplied>[,]</supplied> Professional and other; is acquainted with Paris; has lived two years in Munich and Vienna, not without access to whatever or whoever was most profitable <pb id="pg-05-187" n="05:187"/>there: farther that he is a man of solid judgement, and integrity of principle; a sound, Scotch-logical, authentic man, who will do what he undertakes in an honest manner, or not at all. Of his skill in writing, which I reckon respectable, you may yourself judge by a Paper of his on <hi rend="italic">Animal Magnetism</hi> in No. 9. of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Review</hi>; or still more favourably, by subsequent Essays in other Periodicals less known in Edinburgh.</p>
<p>Now it strikes me that, in the course of your Encyclopedia,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Napier was editor of the 7th edition of the <hi rend="italic">Encylopaedia Britannica</hi> as well as of the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review</hi>.</note> there may occur many cases in which such a hand as this might be available: for example, on subjects connected with Foreign, especially with German Medicine, or Medical Literature, Biographies of Foreign Physicians, and the like; on which matters, as I suppose, information of that direct kind is not very common in Britain. On the other hand, tho#x2019; I have not spoken to him on the subject, it seems probable enough that for my Brother himself, employment like this in such a Publication as yours would from time to time be a pleasant variety among his other occupations; and in such an environment as his now is, with abundance of Books and living helps, might be accomplished without difficulty. I will mention that I have written to you, next opportunity I have: should you have any communication to make, I can in the meantime promise it a respectful welcome, and pointed answer. The Address is: &#x2018;Dr Carlyle, 16. Caroline Street, Bedford Square, London.#x2019;</p>
<p>Such, my Dear Sir, is the Statement I had to offer you. Should it lead to anything mutually serviceable, I shall have done well; if not, you will at least excuse me from any purpose to do ill;&#x2014;and believe me, as heretofore,</p>

<salute>My Dear Jack,</salute>
<p>You are justly what may be called a Benefactor to Craigenputtoch, and, we would hope, &#x2018;an ornament to society in every direction#x2019;:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech. See <ref target="volume-04/lt-18281010-TC-JAC-01"><sic>4:416</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1828-10-10">10 Oct. 1828</date></corr></ref>.</note> here is the second time that your punctuality has helped us out of <pb id="pg-05-188" n="05:188"/>approaching perplexity. The long well-filled sheet arrived duly to our great satisfaction in many ways, where in the little announcement of coming Cash, humble as the circumstance was, did nowise escape us.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John#x2019;s letter, dated <date when="1830-10-25">25 Oct.</date>, announces: &#x201C;Fraser has printed some of your articles, and you may calculate I think upon getting &#xa3;20 before Martinmas. If you hear nothing more of the matter from <supplied>[me]</supplied> expect it with confidence <hi rend="italic">a fortnight after this</hi> in a franc if I can procure one. I have no doubt your <hi rend="italic">Nimmo</hi> would be very acceptable.&#x201D;</note> I drove down with Alick on Wednesday (thro#x2019; unspeakable deluges and tempests) to await that little arrival; and had scarcely seated myself to a comfortable Pipe in Thomson#x2019;s,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >At Dumfries. Unidentified.</note> when the promised Letter was handed in to me; containing, if not Twenty, at least Ten current Pounds, part of which were to be useful the very next day. And now you promise<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably in a covering note, now lost, which came with the money.</note> us other Ten, or even Twenty (if we like better, which we do) next Wednesday; whereby the Genius of Poverty will be quite excluded thro#x2019; the coming months, and can henceforth only growl to no purpose on the outside of bolted doors. Many thanks, dear Jack, for your punctuality, which, in all cases, especially in these, is an excellent virtue.</p>
<p>To deflect now from these personal, crumenic [pecuniary] and very humble concerns, I must express our united gratitude for the light you have thrown on your own situation, which in spite of all drawbacks I hold to be more promising than I have seen it for several years. You are now on your own feet, however small your footing, and feel yourself <hi rend="italic">free</hi>, and enjoy the approval of your conscience, which is the grand basis of all human contentment: A tough struggle doubtless lies before you and around you: nevertheless the victory is certain if you keep true to yourself.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Basil Montagu, in great distress over his son Alfred#x2019;s conduct, had failed to pay John for the translations of Bacon. John wrote, furthermore: &#x201C;I have had <hi rend="italic">several</hi> patients since I came to London but have received <hi rend="italic">no</hi> fee or reward whatever, nor do I expect to receive any for some time to come.&#x201D;</note> I say the victory; meaning thereby not the victory over other medical or literary competitors, and the conquest of certain monies and eulogies, but the victory over the Devil, and the conquest of a true manly character, and manifold talent, which if the world do not reward, it ought. As for the former never trouble your soul about it: &#x2018;meat clothes and fire#x2019;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-05/lt-18300501-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1830-05-01">1 May</date></ref>.</note> are all that mortal can attain here; and often, often the noblest of men, from Paul the Apostle down to Paul the Poet (of Bayreuth)<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jean Paul Richter, who settled in Bayreuth in <date when="1804-00-00">1804</date>.</note> have had these in scantiest <pb id="pg-05-189" n="05:189"/>measure. Of what clay are <hi rend="italic">we</hi> that the like should not befal us also?

Cf. Isa. 14:3, and 1 John 4:18.</note></p>
<p>Heartily as I condemn and contemn <hi rend="italic">all</hi> manner of <hi rend="italic">Gigmania</hi>, and could rather recommend in its stead a certain Diogenic humour (in a <hi rend="italic">clarified</hi> way), I will notwithstanding admit that falling into Debt, or fearing so to fall, is among one#x2019;s heaviest calamities, not a physical only but a moral one;&#x2014;that the large sum you have to realize (a larger one than even mine) for securing yourself on that side, is for the present no small care to me. Literary labour if honest is and was always nothing but a &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">Hungerquelle</hi>#x2019; [intermittent spring, i.e., a source of hunger]; any professional gain is far surer and more easily got. We of course need not advise you to take the <hi rend="italic">smoothest</hi> path towards earning your little necessaries; and unless Literature is smoother for you than Medicine you will not follow it. I do think, however, that your <hi rend="italic">whole</hi> disposable force, there as you stand, should be turned towards the latter province; that you should <hi rend="italic">practice</hi> to right and left, practice among the poor, practice anywhere with or without fee, that your talent be not hid in a napkin. Farther it would gratify us much to understand that you <hi rend="italic">had</hi> a &#x2018;Dr. Carlyle Physician#x2019; engraved on brass on your outer door, <hi rend="italic">whatsoever</hi> said door might be. This were a kind of manifesto, a hoisting of your flag, tho but in small craft, yet in craft of your own, and the more courageously and honourably that it was small. Lastly we are unanimous that getting this <hi rend="italic">History of Medicine</hi>, or not getting it, you actually should <hi rend="italic">not</hi> quit London; that having once sat down to practice medicine, you should persist at all haps in practicing it; having laid your hand on the plough you ought <pb id="pg-05-190" n="05:190"/>in no wise to turn back. Put on your brass-plate, dear Doctor, and try it like a man! Practice for charity, practice wheresoever, or howsoever you can fall in with one of God#x2019;s creatures whom you have the godlike privilege of <hi rend="italic">helping</hi>. All this, however, will by and by occur to yourself, if indeed it is not already plain to you. Now tell us whether that History of Medicine, which we fear is not actually bargained for, bids fair to be bargained for or not: and for the present we will leave this topic.</p>
<p>In regard to your publishing speculations I have written to Macvey Napier about you, and received a handsome enough answer;<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dated <date when="1830-11-09">9 Nov.</date> Napier#x2019;s letter is scarcely as encouraging as Carlyle suggests&#x2014;he politely refuses contributions for the present&#x2014;but Carlyle does not want to discourage John at this time.</note> he thinks it likely that by and by in the Encyclopedia you might be a desirable help. If you write any Paper that you think would answer the Edinburgh Review I can without scruple, and perhaps rather favourably than otherwise introduce it to him: he at length ventures to ask <hi rend="italic">me</hi> to write there; with which request I have some thoughts of complying. Cochrane also has got into a better position towards me, and I can easily introduce any of your lucubrations in that quarter. That &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">Lit. Hist. Ms.</hi>#x2019; is by this time in his hands or Moir#x2019;s rather; to whom I instructed Jeffrey, in answer not to an offer of Publication, but to a long, unasked, abusive and almost ill-bred Criticism,<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> to hand it. From Moir I stipulated only that, printed or not printed, I was to be plagued with <hi rend="italic">no</hi> farther disquisition on the subject: <hi rend="italic">Take or Let alone</hi> was the word, and in the Devil#x2019;s name let us have done with talk. On reading Jeffrey#x2019;s Letter, the first thought was naturally to <hi rend="italic">wash him away</hi>, which could be done with unspeakable ease, I believe; but reflecting then on the man#x2019;s intrinsic kindliness, also on his sufferings and even miseries some of which I have seen into, it appeared clear enough that he had been only in a sad fit of depression, whence this acetous fermentation of small-beer; so I wrote him one of my friendliest Letters, and mean to be as kind to the worthy little Poet as is possible for me, let him kick against the pricks as he may. A warm loving heart, yet now when he is growing old, I question if there is on Earth one real Friend for him, only millions of Commensals and Compotators, and perhaps he feels this! Let us pity the poor white man;<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-03/lt-18251019-TC-JBW-01"><sic>3:390</sic><corr>TC to JBW, <date when="1825-10-19">19 Oct. 1825</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014;and rejoice that <hi rend="italic">Dilettantism</hi> will ere long be kicked out of Creation, in all probability for a century or two.</p>
<p>I wrote to William Fraser about his Magazine, and that Teufelsdreck <pb id="pg-05-191" n="05:191"/>paper of mine, which I have now resolved not to make a Book of; but, if I have opportunity, two <hi rend="italic">Articles</hi>, and the germ of more. I wished to dive into Fraser#x2019;s modes and conditions, and see whether any nearer Magazine relation with him was desirable.

Ten of them must already <hi rend="italic">be</hi> your own?</p>
<p>Alick carried in his last corn, this week, <hi rend="italic">wet</hi>, to grind for the horses: the rest is dry, and a good crop. This Farm you will see in the Courier is advertised: who ploughs it next year is uncertain; Alick will find some provision, if not here, elsewhere: he is not without philosophy, neither will he be without resources.&#x2014;we are to have no man-servant thro#x2019; winter, but to live <foreign><hi rend="italic">ganz still</hi></foreign> [altogether quietly].</p>

<salute>My Honoured Friend,</salute>
<p>With the truest pleasure we received your Letter of the <date when="1830-10-17">17<hi rend="italic">th</hi> October</date>, some ten days ago; and, strangely enough, that same evening, by another conveyance, arrived the long-looked-for Hamburg Box, with all its precious contents in perfect order. Already, on the <ref target="volume-05/lt-18301023-TC-G-01"><date when="1830-10-23">23<hi rend="italic">d</hi> of last Month</date></ref>, I had written to you, chiefly in regard to a former Letter, which I then feared might have been lost: now, however, by a certain phrase, I discover that such fear was groundless; that hitherto our Messages pass safely, over rough seas and tumultuous lands, and do not once miss their road. Among the many wonders of modern Society <pb id="pg-05-193" n="05:193"/>such a benefit is not the lea<supplied>[st won]</supplied>derful; and ought indeed, as you once remarked,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >First paragraph of Goethe to TC, <date when="1830-06-06">6 June</date>. The Hamburg box was sent with Goethe#x2019;s letter to TC of <date when="1830-10-05">5 Oct.</date></note> to make amends for much that we could wish otherwise.</p>
<p>Not knowing the particular Address of our Berlin Friends, and thinking better, at all events, that you who had planted the seed of that relation should also witness its germinating, I have inclosed a few lines under this cover, and shall employ your kindness to forward them as you see fittest. I hope also that the footing you have procured me on the German soil will prove a l<supplied>[ast]</supplied>ing one, and pleasant to my neighbours: for me the remembrance of him whom I owe it <supplied>[will]</supplied> render the connexion doubly valuable.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Goethe wrote in his letter of <date when="1830-10-17">17 Oct.</date>: &#x201C;My last letter of the <date when="1830-10-05">5th of October</date>, in which I inserted a copy of the vote, nominating you, my dearest Sir, a member of the Society of Foreign Literature at Berlin, will, I trust, have reached you. I now send you a copy of the letter in which that vote was transmitted to me. I am glad that by this means you have secured relations with Germany, which may hereafter in many cases be useful to you.&#x201D;
<p>Enclosed was the part of Hitzig#x2019;s letter to Goethe of <date when="1830-09-24">24 Sept.</date> which related to Carlyle: &#x201C;As to Mr. Thomas Carlyle, who enjoys the inestimable good fortune of having his literary labours guided by your advice, furthered by your co-operation, and quickened and elevated by your friendship, and who so well deserves this favour of fate, we have unanimously chosen him a Foreign Member of our Society, believing that thereby we could best prove our high esteem for him and our desire for a closer relation with him. Since your Excellency has brought about this connection, nay more, has, through the adoption of his Work consecrated to our immortal Schiller, as it were, already made him one of us, we trust he will comply with our invitation to join us in the promotion of our high aim, and we beg of you to permit this, our sincere desire, to reach him through your kind mediation.&#x201D; (Norton#x2019;s translations from both letters, pp. 226&#x2013;27).</p>
<p>Carlyle#x2019;s message to the Berlin society has not been found.</p></note></p>
<p>Concerning the Box and its Books, I must first mention that wonderful <hi rend="italic">Life of Sc</hi><supplied>[<hi rend="italic">hiller</hi>,]</supplied> with its proud Introduction, fitter to have stood at the head of some Epic Poem of my writing than there. That I should see myself, before all the world, set forth as the Friend of Goethe is an honour of which, some few years ago, I could not, in my wildest flights, have dreamed; of which, I should still desire no better happiness than to feel myself worthy. For the rest, the Book is nearly the most beautiful I have ever seen; the Preface graceful, and pertinent, as well as highly flattering: these House-pictures themselves seem more appropriate than I could have fancied. On the whole, as one of our rhymers says, &#x2018;it is distance that lends enchantment to the view#x2019;;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Campbell, <hi rend="italic">The Pleasures of Hope</hi>, I, 7.</note> had this Craigenputtoch Mansion stood among the Harz Mountains or the Vosges, this authentic image of it would have <pb id="pg-05-194" n="05:194"/>interested me as well as another. But that our remote Scottish Home should stand here faithfully represented by a German burin [engraving instrument], under <hi rend="italic">your</hi> auspices, this is a fact which we shall never get to understand. The King#x2019;s Palace of Holy-Rood was not dealt with so royally; and our rough-cast Dwelling, with its humble sycamores, and unfrequented hills, should have such preferment! We repeat often: a House, like a Prophet, save in its own country, is not without honour.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Matt. 13:57.</note></p>
<p>For that matchless copy of your Poems, the more precious for the memorable Day it was inscribed on, my Wife whose gratification is of the highest, requests a little space here to thank you in her own words.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In a copy of his <hi rend="italic">Goethe#x2019;s Gedichte</hi>, 2 vols. (Stuttgart and T&#xfc;bingen, <date when="1829-00-00">1829</date>), in a blue silk cover, he had written an inscription which Norton translates (p. 239): &#x201C;To my dear, far-distant friend Jane W. Carlyle, with kindest greeting, on the <date when="1830-08-28">28th of August</date>, &#x2018;Goethe#x2019;s Birthday,#x2019; <date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>.&#x201D; Sold at Sotheby#x2019;s <date when="1932-06-13">13 June 1932</date>, item 65.</note> The last <foreign><hi rend="italic">Lieferung</hi></foreign> [serial part] I have already gone over; especially the <hi rend="italic">Tag-und Jahres-Heft</hi>, in the like of which I could read without limit.&#x2014; Here, however, let me mention an accident and omission, which as important to me, you will gladly rectify: namely, <hi rend="italic">that the fore-last Lieferung was not sent; that from Volume 25 to Volume 31, of that beautiful Edition, there is a blank</hi>.&#x2014; Let me trust also that your task is not yet finished; that from among your valuable Papers copious Selections, and Completions of many sorts, are yet in store for us.</p>
<p>My room here is exhausted, otherwise there were innumerable things to say. In No. 103 of the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review</hi> is a Criticism of <hi rend="italic">Lord L. Gower#x2019;s Translations</hi>,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Francis Egerton (<date when="1800-00-00">1800</date>&#x2013;<date when="1857-00-00">57</date>), Lord Francis Leveson Gower; 1st Earl of Ellesmere, <date when="1833-00-00">1833</date>. His <hi rend="italic">Faust, A Drama</hi> (London, <date when="1823-00-00">1823</date>), a translation of Goethe#x2019;s play with other translations into English, was reviewed by William Empson in the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review</hi>, LII (<date when="1830-10-00">Oct. 1830</date>), 231&#x2013;61. Empson was Jeffrey#x2019;s son-in-law and later editor of the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review</hi>.</note> which, as wiping away a reproach from British Literature, I could not but welcome. The Critic who, I learn, is a man of forty, &#x2018;a scholar, politician and philosopher,#x2019; appears to understand nothing whatever of <hi rend="italic">Faust</hi>, except that the Author is the first of contemporaneous minds, and that Lord Gower understands <hi rend="italic">less</hi> than nothing of it. Even this however is something; and not long ago would have seemed surprising.&#x2014; I myself am sometimes meditating a Translation of <hi rend="italic">Faust</hi>, for which the English world is getting more and more prepared. But of all this, more at large by the next occasion. Might I beg for another word from you by your earliest convenience? <pb id="pg-05-195" n="05:195"/>The Winter will not shut up our thoughts, our wishes. <closer><salute>May all Good be ever with you; may your days long be preserved in peace for the millions to whom they are precious!</salute></closer></p>

<ps><p>[Postscript by JWC:]</p>
<p>I have requested a vacant corner of my Husband#x2019;s sheet; that I might, in my own person, add a word of acknowledgement. But what my heart feels towards you finds no fit utterance in <hi rend="italic">words</hi>; and seeks some mode of expression that were infinite: in action rather&#x2014;in high endeavour would my love, my faith, my deep sense of your goodness express itself; and then only should these feelings become worthy of their exalted object.</p>

<salute>My Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I am much obliged by your favourable reception of the proposition touching my Brother; and no less so by your wish that I should write something for you in the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review</hi>.</p>
<p>I have already written in that <hi rend="italic">Review</hi>, and should be very happy to write in it again; as indeed there can be no more respectable vehicle for any British man#x2019;s speculations than it is and has always been. My respected Friend, your Predecessor had some difficulty with me in <pb id="pg-05-196" n="05:196"/>adjusting the respective prerogatives of Author and Editor:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle is thinking particularly of Jeffrey#x2019;s treatment of his essay on Burns, on which he comments in <ref target="volume-04/lt-18281010-TC-JAC-01"><sic>4:413&#x2013;14</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1828-10-10">10 Oct. 1828</date></corr></ref>. Napier commented on the nature of the relationship between editor and author in his reply of <date when="1830-12-09">9 Dec.</date>: &#x201C;As to Editorial powers &#x26; privileges, I certainly cannot come under any pledge to any one to print whatever may be sent me; but the conduct of literary &#x26; scientific works is a business on which I am not altogether a novice, and I can only say that it has been invariably my wish to discharge my duties in the way least calculated to hurt the feelings of those concerned.&#x201D; For other points in Napier#x2019;s letter see <ref target="volume-05/lt-18301219-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1830-12-19">19 Dec.</date></ref></note> for tho#x2019; not, as I hope, insensible to fair reason, I used sometimes to rebel against what I reckoned mere authority; and this partly perhaps as a matter of literary conscience; being wont to write nothing without studying it if possible to the bottom, and writing always with an almost painful feeling of scrupulosity, that light Editorial hacking and hewing to right and left was in general nowise to my mind.</p>
<p>In what degree the like difficulties might occur between you and me I cannot pretend to guess: however, if you are willing, then I also am willing, to try. Occasionally of late I have been meditating an Essay on <hi rend="italic">Byron</hi>; which, on appearance of Mr Moore#x2019;s Second Volume, now soon expected,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The first volume of Moore#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Letters and Journals of Lord Byron: with Notices of his Life</hi> was published early in <date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>, the second early in the next year but with <date when="1830-00-00">1830</date> on the title-page.</note> I should have no objection to attempt for you. Of Mr Moore himself I should say little; or rather perhaps, as he may be a favourite of yours, Nothing: neither would my opinion of Byron prove very heterodox; my chief aim would be to <hi rend="italic">see</hi> him and show him, not, as is too often the way, (if I could help it) to write merely &#x2018;about him and about him.#x2019;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Pope, <hi rend="italic">Dunciad</hi>, IV, 252.</note> For the rest, tho#x2019; no Whig in the strict sense, I have no disposition to run <hi rend="italic">amuck</hi> against any set of men or of opinions; but only to put forth certain Truths that I feel in me, with all sincerity; for some of which this <hi rend="italic">Byron</hi>, if you liked it, were a fit enough channel. Dilettantism, and mere toying with Truth, is, on the whole, a thing which I cannot practice: nevertheless real Love, real Belief, is not inconsistent with Tolerance of its opposite; nay is the only thing consistent there with, for your Elegant Indifference is at heart only <hi rend="italic">idle</hi>, selfish, and quite <hi rend="italic">in</hi>tolerant. At all events, one can and should ever <hi rend="italic">speak quietly</hi>; loud hysterical vehemence, foaming, and hissing least of all beseems him that is convinced, and not only <hi rend="italic">supposes</hi>, but <hi rend="italic">knows</hi>.</p>
<p>So much to cast some faint light for you on my plan of procedure, and what you have to look for in employing me. Let me only farther <pb id="pg-05-197" n="05:197"/>request that if you, for whatever reason, do not like this proposal, you will without shadow of scruple tell me so. Frankness is best met by frankness; the practice presupposes the approval.</p>
<p>I have been thinking sometimes likewise of a Paper on Napoleon, a man whom tho#x2019; handled to the extreme of triteness, it will be long years before we understand. Hitherto in the English tongue there is next to nothing that betokens insight into him, or even sincere belief of such on the part of the writer. I should like to study the man with what heartiness I could, and form to myself some intelligible picture of him both as a Biographical and as a Historical figure, in both of which senses he is our chief contemporary wonder; and in some sort the epitome of his age. This however were a task of far more difficulty than <hi rend="italic">Byron</hi>, and perhaps not so promising at present.</p>
<p>For <hi rend="italic">Byron</hi>, no Books were wanted except Mr Moore#x2019;s two vo<supplied>[lumes]</supplied> to which Galt#x2019;s might be added:<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Galt (<date when="1779-00-00">1779</date>&#x2013;<date when="1839-00-00">1839</date>), <hi rend="italic">Life of Lord Byron</hi> (London, <date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>).</note> except the <hi rend="italic">Plays</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Don Juan</hi>, which also would be needed, all his Poems are already here.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For a discussion of Carlyle#x2019;s desire to write an essay on Byron and his marked interest in him at this time, see C. R. Sanders, &#x201C;The Byron Closed in <hi rend="italic">Sartor Resartus,&#x201D; Studies in Romanticism</hi>, III (Winter <date when="1964-00-00">1964</date>), 77&#x2013;108.</note></p>
<p>Have the goodness to let me know by your first convenience what you think of this; not hesitating to say <foreign><hi rend="italic">Fiat</hi></foreign> or <foreign><hi rend="italic">Ne Fiat</hi></foreign> [<hi rend="italic">Do</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Do not</hi>]; and believe me always,</p>

<salute>My Dear Sir;</salute>
<p>I write you a single line here, in the middle of bustle and tumult, to remind you of your promised vis<supplied>[i]</supplied>t at Christmas. We shall be at home then, and truly gratified to see you. Any one of three or four Dumfries Coaches will set you down, at few hours#x2019; warning within fifteen miles of us; and the ancient charioteer of the King#x2019;s Arms is still, as we ocularly saw lately, urging his rapid wheels.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >From the inn at Dumfries, at which Inglis could hire transport (driven by the local &#x201C;ancient charioteer&#x201D;) to Craigenputtoch.</note> Nay could I <pb id="pg-05-198" n="05:198"/>precisely know your time, I should think nothing to meet you with Harry (your invaluable namesake) in harness, and drive you up in our own old vehicle.</p>
<p>My wife says that you <hi rend="italic">are</hi> to leave that villainous <foreign>reeky</foreign> Town and world for a few days, and fly into the moorland city of refuge, where nothing but quietude and friendliness awaits you. Come then, and let us hear, and see you.</p>
<p>We see a strange foolish story in the Newspapers about a Sister of yours, which we would fain treat as a piece of knavish mystification; were not the fact too likely that Mrs M. <hi rend="italic">is</hi> missing, and her friends <hi rend="italic">do</hi> feel themselves in pain and alarm.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henry Inglis#x2019; sister was the wife of Alexander Macleod of Harris; see <ref target="volume-04/lt-18271129-TC-JAC-01"><sic>4:290</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1827-11-29">29 Nov. 1827</date></corr></ref>. Her story, told in detail (if not fully) in the press, was very strange. In brief, she was the victim of anonymous letters which accused her husband of &#x201C;an intrigue&#x201D; with a young woman whom he meant to engage as a governess. After being enticed to London by a mysterious lady, with whom she went off in a &#x201C;green carriage,&#x201D; Mrs. Macleod disappeared; and she was discovered a few weeks later &#x201C;at a house in Parliament-Street, but in a terrible state of mind.&#x201D; (From reports in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, <date when="1830-12-07">7 Dec. 1830</date> and <date when="1831-01-08">8 Jan. 1831</date>, and in the <hi rend="italic">Scotsman</hi>, <date when="1830-12-11">11 Dec. 1830</date>).</note> We hope you have already got some light on the matter: at all events, do not torment yourself too much; your Sister to all appearance is personally safe, and even not unhappy; and for the foolish Publicity of the business, it is but a nine-days wonder, and will do no permanent hurt to her or any one. We still hope the best.</p>
<p>Come if you can, and be sure of our best welcome. Adding kindest regards from the <hi rend="italic">Leddy</hi>, <closer><salute>I remain, / My Dear Sir, / Affectionately Your#x2019;s,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My Dear Jack,</salute>
<p>I take the longest sheet in my possession to answer your short Letter,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dated <date when="1830-11-15">15 Nov.</date> About a page and a half of the whole letter has been preserved. John said: &#x201C;I feel like you that the steps I have hitherto taken in London are the wisest that could have been taken in such circumstances. I have full employment at present &#x26; can wait with due patience for practice till it comes. Did I tell you in my last letter, that I have set about studying the subject of &#x2018;Diet and Regimen#x2019;? It includes nearly the whole of medicine, &#x26;, by professing to master it, I comply with the fashion here which demands a division of labour in medicine as well as other things. I have got German books on the subject about me, as well as many English &#x26; my mornings are spent in reading them. &#x2026; I saw C. Buller to-day &#x26; found him unwell. He could not sit up easily having a blister on so that I did not like to ask him for a frank. Arthur is also here &#x26; Mr. and Mrs Buller at Mannheim&#x2014;discontented with Germany. I go tomorrow to take a mutton chop with <supplied>[Charles]</supplied> &#x26; to hear the debate on Parliamentary reform. Both are very kind to me.&#x201D;</note> both because the answer is nearly due, and that we may the <pb id="pg-05-199" n="05:199"/>sooner have another, wherein perhaps more specific tidings will be granted us, and that long-looked-for &#x2018;next time#x2019; will actually arrive. We have indeed, taking one thing with another, small right to complain of you as a Correspondent: only that your fidelity and punctuality in one particular causes the greater desire of it in another, and the frustrated possibility of great enjoyment awakens unthankfulness with little. Did you understand rightly with what feelings we open a sheet from you, it would not be &#x2018;near six#x2019; that you would sit down to write, but at some much more deliberate hour.</p>
<p>Let me satisfy you first touching Mary. She is at Scotsbrig; her husband<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mary had recently married James Austin. They had resided at Scotsbrig since <date when="1830-11-22">22 Nov.</date></note> officiating there as farm-labourer, instead of John Lockhart, whom they found means to discharge. It is our Mother#x2019;s doing; warmly opposed by sister <hi rend="italic">Jean</hi>, and by all here; partly indifferent to the other parties: but our Mother turned a deaf ear to all reasoning on the subject, or rather listened to it, and then went and did otherwise. I left her, on the Friday after I wrote to you last, apparently convinced and quieted: but next night she took to &#x2018;wandering about the house#x2019;; had Jemmy despatched to Moffat on Sunday, and next day back with a horse-and-cart, which landed them both bag and baggage at Scotsbrig door. There is a talk there about fitting up some of the office-houses as a separate dwelling for them: but we think here that nothing of that sort will actually be done soon; and in the meanwhile we must even leave them in that ungainly position; regretting to see all our sagacious contrivances and heroic determinations as good as thrown away. I am vexed at my mother, yet it is only her weakness of purpose, or perhaps rather undue strength of affection, that we can blame. I have not written to her yet, and shall not soon I fear muster heart to visit Scotsbrig under these circumstances; which however there is no altering.&#x2014; Jemmy who was here since, with Robert Clow, reports that the rest of the household are well; as indeed we heard <pb id="pg-05-200" n="05:200"/>again on Monday last, when Alick#x2019;s herdboy was down there&#x2014;bringing him a cartwheel, and us a supply of oatmeal and chickens.</p>
<p>Alick<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Who had also married recently. His wife had been Janet Clow (<date when="1809-00-00">1809</date>&#x2013;<date when="1891-00-00">91</date>).</note> has his wife here, calls her &#x2018;my love,#x2019; sometimes even &#x2018;my angel#x2019; with his own peculiar accent, and seems to get on perfectly well. Jenny herself is the naivest of women, a good figure, and at working a very Penelope. On the whole, here in our moorland Patmos we are not without cause to be grateful: this very night, we have fine black frost, a vehement fire is blazing (with peats logs and large coals) at my left hand (for it is in the Drawing-room that we abide for these few days), and on the opposite side thereof sits my wife sewing; I owe no man almost anything, and have the prospect of being allowed to live unmolested in God#x2019;s Earth a little longer, there to till and sow according to ability that richest of all fields Future Time: <foreign><hi rend="italic">Mein Ackerist die Zeit</hi></foreign> [Time is my seed-field].<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. the lines from Goethe#x2019;s poetry prefixed to the revised edition of Carlyle#x2019;s translation of <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meisters Wanderjahre</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XXIV, 193; Carlyle cites them at the end of &#x201C;Characteristics&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XXVIII, 43) and elsewhere. The full quotation became the title-page motto of <hi rend="italic">Sartor Resartus:</hi> &#x201C;<foreign>Mein Verm&#xE4;chtniss, wie herrlich weit und breit! / Die Zeit ist mein Verm&#xE4;chtniss, mein Acker ist die Zeit</foreign>&#x201D; [My inheritance how wide and fair! / Time is my fair seed-field, of Time I#x2019;m heir] (trans. from &#x201C;Characteristics&#x201D;; others vary slightly). See also Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi>, pp. 9&#x2013;10.<lb/><lb/>
The lines in Goethe first appeared in the <hi rend="italic">West-&#xF6;stlicher Divan</hi> (<date when="1819-00-00">1819</date>) as one of the poems in the &#x201C;Buch der Spr&#xfc;che.&#x201D; Actually, they are slightly different from the version given by Carlyle:<lb/><lb/>
<lg><l><foreign>Mein Erbtheil wie herrlich, weit und breit!</foreign></l><lb/>
<l><foreign>Die Zeit ist mein Besitz, mein Acker ist die Zeit.</foreign></l></lg><lb/><lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Goethes Werke</hi>(Weimar, <date when="1888-00-00">1888</date>), VI, 121. Carlyle changed the punctuation and replaced &#x201C;<foreign>Erbtheil</foreign>&#x201D; and &#x201C;<foreign>Besitz</foreign>&#x201D; with &#x201C;<foreign>Verm&#xE4;chtniss</foreign>&#x201D;; &#x201C;<foreign>Erbtheil</foreign>&#x201D; has a legalistic connotation which he may have wished to avoid. He may also have had in mind Goethe#x2019;s seven-stanza poem &#x201C;<foreign>Verm&#xE4;chtniss</foreign>,&#x201D; first published in <date when="1829-00-00">1829</date> as a supplement to the second book of the revised and enlarged <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meisters Wanderjahre</hi>, which he would have read at the end of vol. XXII of the collected edition of Goethe#x2019;s works (<hi rend="italic">Vollst&#xE4;ndige Ausgabe letzter Hand</hi>).</note> &#x2018;What wanteth man that I have not / Within my own Four walls?#x2019;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Carlyle#x2019;s poem &#x201C;My Own Four Walls&#x201D; published in A. Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">LL</hi>, II, 355&#x2013;56, and cf. <ref target="volume-04/lt-18261225-TC-ADBM-01"><sic>4:172</sic><corr>TC to ADBM, <date when="1826-12-25">25 Dec. 1826</date></corr></ref>. Two of the seven stanzas read:<lb/><lb/>
<lg><l>A home and wife I too have got,</l><lb/>
<l>A hearth to blaze whate#x2019;er befalls!</l><lb/>
<l>What need a man that I have not</l><lb/>

<l>All in my own four walls.</l></lg></note></p>
<p>To give you a few more particulars. We have only one servant this winter: &#x2018;Betty#x2019;, an oldish coughing woman, but seemingly a &#x2018;chosen <pb id="pg-05-201" n="05:201"/>one#x2019; of her sex, so quiet is she, so orderly, and takes such charge of Master and Missus, of cow, pig and pony. The place is all dry and gravelly, swept and garnished, even to Cobbett#x2019;s taste, about doors;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Cobbett, <hi rend="italic">Cottage Economy</hi> (London, <date when="1822-00-00">1822</date>), p. 101, in which he is explicit about the need for neatness around the dwelling, and especially that &#x201C;every act that tends to neatness &#x2026; tends to the creating of a mass of manure <supplied>[as the pile of debris swept together becomes composted]</supplied>.&#x201D;</note> windtight, watertight, warm and smokeless within. The &#x2018;big beast#x2019; is labouring for her bread at Templand this winter: but Harry runs in the Gig (which I myself can now trim and harness) like a very lion, and I give him &#x2018;swine-meal,#x2019; which is his plumpudding and calepash and calepee,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Calipash&#x201D; and &#x201C;calipee&#x201D;: the first being that part of the turtle next to the upper shield&#x2014;a greenish gelatinous substance; the second being that part of the turtle near the lower shield&#x2014;a yellowish gelatinous substance.</note> nightly by deputy, and on those great Gig-occasions for two days previously &#x2018;with my own hand.#x2019;<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech, based on an expression of Edward Irving#x2019;s.</note> We were at Templand but on Wednesday last; and with lamps burning (halfpenny tallow candles!) overtook MacKnight, scarcely past &#x2018;the Milton,#x2019; and snatched our Letters from him.&#x2014; &#x2018;By the <hi rend="italic">bye</hi>,#x2019; I ought here to admit that your Newspaper has been a day too late, the last two times; owing to no neglect of mine, but to the mischance that none went hence to Church, and that I had no man to <hi rend="italic">send</hi> down; which mischance however I have taken the best measures I could to guard against hencefort<supplied>[h]</supplied>. Again, by another <hi rend="italic">bye</hi>, I may say that we are not tired of the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, which we think the cleverest of all Radicals; but will nevertheless cheerfully fall in with <hi rend="italic">any</hi> new arrangement you like better: the <hi rend="italic">Spectator</hi> we generally see, about midweek, thro#x2019; Frazer; it is better than it was, and immeasurably copious, yet still stupid enough. Besides is it not twice as dear as the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, or any other single Paper? But as I said, <hi rend="italic">whatever</hi> way will please you better. On the whole you are a true blessing to us for Newspapers; never once a failure, and ever and anon some supernumerary, which were it weeks old is alw<supplied>[a]</supplied>ys greedily devoured by us. We get no talk here, and are quite insatiable in the Newspaper way. William Graham, who rode with me to Ecclefechan that night the Parcel went off, expressed a similar gratitude towards you; indeed he seemed gladder of those old Papers than if you had given him as many guineas: your Letter also was very precious to him; and if he had not answered it, sad secret cares, as I guessed, were the only reason. Poor Graham is on no bed of roses, so far as matters economic go: but he does not open himself, and I have not the face to break in upon his citadel, having no comfort to <pb id="pg-05-202" n="05:202"/>give if I were there. And now adding only that Waugh<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Waugh, M.D.</note> is still a laggard, and applied to me lately for &#x2018;a loan of ten pounds#x2019; (<foreign><hi rend="italic">umsonst! umsonst!</hi></foreign> [in vain! in vain!]) and directions how to study German, I quit the province of news and private gossip: after which <foreign><hi rend="italic">paullo majora canamus</hi></foreign> [Let us sing in a somewhat loftier strain].<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Vergil, <hi rend="italic">Eclogues</hi>, IV, 1.</note></p>
<p>I have yet done nothing in regard to your <hi rend="italic">Hom&#xF6;pathie</hi>,<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John apparently never wrote on the topic, but he may have had in mind something similar to the article (attributed to Sir Daniel Sandford) in the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review</hi>, L (<date when="1830-01-00">Jan. 1830</date>), 504&#x2013;27, on the Homopathic concept (about &#x201C;sameness of feeling&#x201D;) as propounded by the German physician Samuel Hahnemann. His theories were criticized by many contemporaries, including Thomas Hood in his &#x201C;Ode to Doctor Hahnemann, the Hom&#x9c;pathist&#x201D; (<date when="1837-00-00">1837</date>).</note> am most ready to do anything, but can scarcely advise what. Will you have me write to the man,<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >J. G. Cochrane, editor of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Quarterly Review</hi>.</note> offering such an Article from you, to see what he says? If so, tell me, and I will do it. I would most probably have stirred that way in the matter already; only that I have not yet heard anything about his proceedings in regard to that <hi rend="italic">History</hi>, and meant to regulate my future conduct towards him partly by his conduct therein. He is a coarse hog of a man, but not ill-meaning perhaps, and for the present may be useful. It is possible every week that I may hear something from him: but do you write on the supposition of my <hi rend="italic">not</hi> having heard, and then direct me what to do.

<salute>My Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>We learn with the sincerest sorrow the melancholy errand you are bound on;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Relating to Inglis#x2019; missing sister, Mrs. Macleod. See <ref target="volume-05/lt-18301216-TC-HI-01">TC to HI, <date when="1830-12-16">16 Dec.</date></ref></note> and trust in God that matters will not be so bad as you fear. The whole matter in the Newspapers had so much the appearance of a Hoax that we paid little heed to it; but alas! alas!&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>
<p>Meanwhile this is not the time for lamenting, but for acting. It strikes me that if you will call on my Brother, he may be able to introduce <supplied>[you]</supplied> to some persons of worth, prudence and even influence, who know London, and will take a real interest in your <pb id="pg-05-205" n="05:205"/>search. In particular, there is one Family the Montagues of Bedford Square, whom I think it will be well worth your while to see: the Husband a Chancery Barrister of some note, Commissioner of Bankrupts, and man of humanity and experience, may perhaps give you good advice at all events show you where to seek it: his Lady is simply the most acute, intelligent and accomplished woman I ever saw; of a most generous nature also, and will receive you with all helpfulness, even were you not my friend; <hi rend="italic">her</hi> advice on all subjects is well worth listening to. &#x2014;John can also take you to Edward Irving, who is extensively connected, of great humanity, and far wiser in all matters of Business than any stranger to his person would expect. There is even a certain Keeper of a Madhouse, one Dr Allen,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Matthew Allen. See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18200519-TC-MAL-01"><sic>1:250</sic><corr>TC to MAL, <date when="1820-05-19">19 May 1820</date></corr></ref>.</note> a worthy man, whom you might consult with: the Montagues themselves have had too much to do with that sort of Establishments.</p>
<p>If these suggestions are of any value to you, send or carry this Letter to my Brother (Dr Carlyle, 16. Caroline-Street, Bedford-Square, London), and you will have <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the help he can render you, as readily as if he were your own Brother.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we beg to hear what befals you, the first instant you have leisure. Also if you can come in hither as you return, do it; whether your success have been good, or evil&#x2014;in the latter case you have more need to come. And so may God assist you, and guide you safe thro#x2019; this hard but sacred duty! Above all, do not lose your reason, your composure: <hi rend="italic">do nothing rashly;</hi> and let your &#x201C;vengeance&#x201D; (this I most particularly request and enjoin) be Forgivenness,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf.

<salute>Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>The Bearer of this is Henry Inglis, come to London on the saddest business; of which the Newspapers will have already informed you: <pb id="pg-05-206" n="05:206"/>to seek his mysteriously lost Sister, Mrs M#x2019;Leod. I beg of you to understand that we take a true interest in him here; and have already promised your utmost endeavours in the way of help;&#x2014;the particulars of which are pointed out, so far as I can yet devise anything, in the foregoing Note to himself. I especially think you should carry him to Bedford Square, and take earnest counsel with Mrs Montague. Tell her that he is m<supplied>[y]</supplied> Friend (deservedly interesting to me) and that I have advised this. <supplied>[What]</supplied> farther may be proper will better occur to yourselves.&#x2014; I have risen out of bed to write this scrawl, and so have no composure to advise farther, were I otherwise qualified. However, you understand me, and will do all this, for my sake and your own.</p>

<p>It is almost worthwhile to have a sore-throat &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">at a time</hi>,#x2019;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Occasionally.</note> to rouse lethargic friends into naturality.

Ritchie suggests that Eliza Stodart was probably quoting her uncle Mr. Bradfute, who may have used the phrase &#x201C;damnable heresy&#x201D; about the Reform agitation.

And then you have such plenty of interesting matter lying on all hands&#x2014; If you <pb id="pg-05-207" n="05:207"/>were in <hi rend="italic">my</hi> place you would have more excuse who have to produce letters as the silk-worm spins, all out of my own inside.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jane wrote comparatively few letters in the Craigenputtoch period and comparatively many in her London years.</note></p>
<p>We have been very solitary for a long while, our only visitors are now and then a stray pack-man. and the last of these pronounced the place &#x2018;altogether <hi rend="italic">heathenish</hi>#x2019; so there is no hope of our being favoured with <hi rend="italic">his</hi> company another time. Nevertheless I keep up my heart. There is nothing like a good fit of pain for taking the conceit out of one. Had I been newly returned from Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, my thoughts still wandering on the mountain-tops of vanity, it is probable I should have found life here in this grim<supplied>[m]</supplied>est of weather almost intolerable; but being newly recovered from a sore-throat I am quite content beside a good fire, with a book or work, and the invaluable capacity of swallowing tho#x2019; the desert around looks the very head quarters of winter; and our knocker hangs a useless ornament.</p>
<p>My Grandfather was no worse when my Mother wrote last week; and her luck seemed to be taking a favourable turn; she had got a visitor, than whom &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">no sweeter ever crossed a threshold</hi>&#x201D;&#x2014; I mean to spend a week with her so soon as I am able to ride: but I am not <hi rend="italic">quite</hi> well yet&#x2014;at least I am still wearing signals of distress&#x2014;a nightcap and shawl&#x2014;that partly I confess, from a secret persuasion that these equipments render my appearanc<supplied>[e]</supplied> more interesting&#x2014; But Mercy here is dark night come upon me and a box has yet to be packed with which a man has to ride six miles thro#x2019; the snow&#x2014; I will write you at more length another time&#x2014;and in the mean while this will show my good intentions&#x2014;&#x2014;God bless you Dear a kiss to your Uncle</p>

<salute>My Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>This Paper on poor Taylor being finished, I may as well send it off.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Soon after <date when="1830-12-29">29 Dec. 1830</date> Carlyle had written in his journal: &#x201C;This Taylor is a wretched Atheist and Philistine: it is <hi rend="italic">my</hi> duty (perhaps) to put the flock, whom he professes to lead, on their guard. Let me do it <hi rend="italic">well!</hi>&#x201D; On <date when="1831-02-07">7 Feb.</date> he wrote: &#x201C;Finished the Review of <hi rend="italic">Taylor</hi> some three weeks ago, and sent it off: no tidings about it yet. It is worth little, and only partially in a right spirit&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Two Note Books</hi>, p. 182). Napier sent Carlyle proof of the article on <date when="1831-02-01">1 Feb.</date>, with a covering letter in which he said: &#x201C;This is an excellent article, full of original &#x26; striking thoughts and expressions, and very amusing. You have my very best thanks for it.&#x201D; But he added that Carlyle had confused William Taylor, the subject of the review, with Thomas Taylor (<date when="1758-00-00">1758</date>&#x2013;<date when="1835-00-00">1835</date>), the translator of Plato and Aristotle, and that he must correct all passages based on this confusion. See also <ref target="volume-04/lt-18280925-TC-G-01"><sic>4:406</sic><corr>TC to G, <date when="1828-09-25">25 Sept. 1828</date></corr></ref>.</note> I have studied to conform to your directions in one important point at least, in length; tho#x2019; having been sore afflicted all the way with <hi rend="italic">bad pens</hi>, I have written in irregular style, and know not quite accurately how much there is.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-05-211" n="05:211"/>And now I will pray that the next subject you give me may be an English one, at least no German one. On that last business I have said enough for a year or two; and innumerable men, women, and children have taken it up; who must see the surface clearly, and know that there <hi rend="italic">is</hi> a depth, before you can help to show them <hi rend="italic">what</hi> it is. I greatly approved of your friend Empson#x2019;s acknowledgement that <hi rend="italic">Faust</hi> was a wonderful Poem, and Lord Leveson Gower a Windbag: only he led h<supplied>[im]</supplied> far too gently over the coals; he should have roasted him there, and made him not Leveson but a cinder.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-05/lt-18301115-TC-G-01">TC to <sic>Goethe</sic><corr>G</corr>, <date when="1830-11-15">15 Nov. 1830</date></ref>.</note> It is positively the nearest approach we can make to sacrilege in these days for a vain young man not knowing his right hand from his left to take an inspired work, like this of Goethe#x2019;s, and mangle it into such an unspeakable hash. Let it either be overlooked; or punished by <foreign><hi rend="italic">Auto da fe</hi></foreign>.</p>
<p>I once proposed to Mr Jeffrey to make a sort of sally on <hi rend="italic">Fashionable Novels:</hi> but he misunderstood me; thought I meant to <hi rend="italic">criticise</hi> them; and so the matter dropt for the time. The Pelham-and-Devereux manufacture is a sort of thing which ought to be extinguished in British Literature;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Napier replied that Bulwer was &#x201C;a friend and a <hi rend="italic">Reviewer</hi>&#x201D; and that it would not do to assail him. But see the passages on Dandyism in <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Past and Present</hi>. Edward George Earle Lytton Bulwer (<date when="1803-00-00">1803</date>&#x2013;<date when="1873-00-00">73</date>) assumed the additional name of Lytton in <date when="1843-00-00">1843</date> and became 1st Baron Lytton in <date when="1866-00-00">1866</date>. He had published <hi rend="italic">Pelham</hi> in <date when="1828-00-00">1828</date> and <hi rend="italic">Devereux</hi> in <date when="1829-00-00">1829</date>.</note> at least, some once in the half century, a British reviewer ought to rise up and declare it extinguishable, and prophecy its extinction. But I fear my zeal has somewhat cooled; and perhaps the better method of attack were not to batter but to undermine. The English Aristocracy have as much need of instruction as Swing himself.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In the <date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>&#x2013;<date when="1831-00-00">31</date> agricultural riots, one symbol for the farm laborers protesting against poverty was Captain Francis Swing, an apocryphal figure whose signature appeared on letters threatening to burn ricks and barns, some of which were burned. Books supposedly written by him, or about him, appeared such as <hi rend="italic">The Life and History of Swing, the Kent Rick-burner, Written by Himself</hi> (<date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>), <hi rend="italic">A Short Account of the Life and Death of Swing, the Rick-burner, written by One Well Acquainted with Him</hi>, by H. N. Coleridge, and <hi rend="italic">The Genuine Life of Mr. Francis Swing</hi> (<date when="1831-00-00">1831</date>). See also E. J. Hobsbawn and George Rud&#xE9;, <hi rend="italic">Captain Swing</hi> (<date when="1969-00-00">1969</date>). For Carlyle on the English aristocracy, see Zaehdarm#x2019;s epitaph in Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi>, p. 130, and cf. p. 94 and <hi rend="italic">Two Note Books</hi>, pp. 159&#x2013;60.</note></p>
<p>A far finer Essay were a faithful, loving, and yet critical and in part condemnatory delineation of Jeremy Bentham<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In <date when="1820-00-00">1820</date> Carlyle described Bentham (<date when="1748-00-00">1748</date>&#x2013;<date when="1832-00-00">1832</date>), leader of the utilitarian school of economics, as &#x201C;a rhinoceros&#x2014;strong and clumsy&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-01/lt-18200607-TC-MAL-01"><sic>1:262</sic><corr>TC to MAL, <date when="1820-06-07">7 June 1820</date></corr></ref>).</note> and his place and working in this section of the world#x2019;s History. Bentham will not be put down by Logic, and should not be put down, for we need him <pb id="pg-05-212" n="05:212"/>greatly as a Back-woods-man: neither can reconciliation be effected till the one party understands and is just to the other. Bentham is a Denyer, he <hi rend="italic">denies</hi> with a loud and universally convincing voice: his fault is that he can <hi rend="italic">affirm</hi> nothing, except that money is pleasant in the purse and food in the stomach, and that by this simplest of all Beliefs he can reorganise Society. He can shatter it in pieces; no thanks to him, for its old fastenings are quite rotten: but he cannot reorganise it; this is work for quite others than he.&#x2014; Such an Essay on Bentham, however, were a great task for anyone; for me a very great one, and perhaps rather out of my road.</p>
<p>My Brother speaks of preparing some little Paper or other to submit to you. Should this take effect, I dare promise that you <hi rend="italic">will look</hi> at the performance, and even report that it will not do, or that it will do; but shall farther beg you to understand with all distinctness that you need stand on <hi rend="italic">no</hi> ceremony; that I should never see the Paper, except in print, and above all, in matters of that kind, can have no friend and no enemy. However, John#x2019;s resolutions are no decrees of fate: perhaps such a contingency may never arrive.</p>
<p>This Parcel of Books I trouble you with, to save carriage; the rather as they are borrowed. A porter can carry them over; the Letter can go by the Penny Post.</p>

<salute>My Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Last Wednesday came your Books, all safe; no Parcel of Montague#x2019;s; and what we grudged very much no scratch of a pen from yourself. The last two Letters also hurried, and half-full; communicating little, except perhaps that you were in bodily health, and felt yourself bound to write to us. Does your fraternal conscience say nothing on this point? For me I think it wrong and unfriendly in several respects. You are there in the focus of British activity at a great era in the world#x2019;s history, at a great era in your own; I am here in the dead <pb id="pg-05-213" n="05:213"/>silence of peat-moss, yet warmly interested in all that pertains to both these eras; and you take the trouble to tell me very little. Some half hundred things you might throw great light on for me; indeed scarcely anything you could write would not instruct me: nevertheless you will not so much as fill your paper, no matter with what. Depend upon it, dear Jack, all this is not right. But what remedy have we? A man#x2019;s Letters are his Letters; you must accept them as such, or cease to correspond with him, and <hi rend="italic">then</hi> you get justice! Therefore I will say no more on this point. But one thing more especially grieves me, my dear Brother: that in these hasty scrawls of Letters, I trace some perturbation of mind diligently hidden from me. O <hi rend="italic">this</hi>, be sure, is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> right. Speak of your cares, man, to a heart that loves you: they will grow lighter by your very speaking of them; Order arises out of speech especially out of writing. Attempt to explain what you do know, and you already know something more. But with this too I have done. As was said, your Letters are your Letters; and I, or any man, have no right to complain of them, but only to take thankfully what you give.</p>
<p>I have been busy for three weeks, have finished <hi rend="italic">Taylor</hi>, and send it off tomorrow: it cannot appear till the Number following the first. Taylor is a clever old <hi rend="italic">Philister</hi>, and I have salted him according to ability; there is also something about <foreign><hi rend="italic">Welt-Litteratur</hi></foreign> [world literature]:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle does refer in his review to &#x201C;free literary intercourse with other nations&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XXVII, 337) and closes the essay with the hope &#x201C;that a new era in the spiritual intercourse of Europe is approaching; that instead of isolated, mutually repulsive National Literatures, a World Literature may one day be looked for&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>., p. 369). He writes with some of Goethe#x2019;s remarks in mind which he wrote in his letters to Carlyle and in the introduction to the German translation of Carlyle#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Schiller</hi>. See Norton, <hi rend="italic">GC</hi>, pp. 23&#x2013;26, and 301; and cf. Tennyson, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi>, pp. 96&#x2013;97, and Ren&#xE9; Wellek, <hi rend="italic">A History of Modern Criticism:</hi> <date when="1750-00-00">1750</date>&#x2013;<date when="1950-00-00">1950</date> (New Haven and London, <date when="1965-00-00">1965</date>), III, 98 ff. Carlyle had been first introduced to Goethe#x2019;s term &#x201C;world literature&#x201D; three years before when John had quoted to him a passage on the subject from one of Goethe#x2019;s letters to Sulpiz Boisser&#xE9;e. See John Clubbe, &#x201C;John Carlyle in Germany and the Genesis of <hi rend="italic">Sartor Resartus</hi>,&#x201D; in <hi rend="italic">Romantic and Victorian: Studies in Memory of William H. Marshall</hi> (Rutherford, N.J., <date when="1971-00-00">1971</date>), p. 272. For full discussion, see Fritz Strich, <hi rend="italic">Goethe and World Literature</hi> (New York, <date when="1949-00-00">1949</date>).</note> on the whole, a <hi rend="italic">baddish</hi> Article, not without some particles of worth, and may help a little to guide our German studies from some aberration. In writing to Napier, I mentioned the possibility of his receiving a Paper from you: he was to <hi rend="italic">try</hi> it, and accept or reject <hi rend="italic">quite</hi> freely, according to his judgement. I hope and trust, it will do. There is no Periodical so steady as the Edinburgh Review; the salary fair, the vehicle respectable. Whether <hi rend="italic">Diet</hi> may be a quite popular subject <pb id="pg-05-214" n="05:214"/>I do not know; but I calculate with some confidence that you will make a reasonable story out of it. Are you apprised that some three years ago, there <hi rend="italic">was</hi> an Article on that subject; the poorest of Articles; which Jeffrey too interwove with a constant running thread of contradiction, almost every alternate paragraph was his, and the whole looked laughable enough. I fancy these artists will hardly have trenched on your ground: nevertheless look at their work. I cannot direct you to the Number more nearly than so: that it was the one published immediately before our leaving Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >They left <date when="1828-05-26">26 May 1828</date>. The article referred to is a review of some books on dietetics, XLVII (<date when="1828-01-00">Jan. 1828</date>), 37&#x2013;59.</note> perhaps therefore, that of <date when="1828-03-00">March</date> or <date when="1828-04-00">April 1828</date>. You should try to be new, and above all to give new <hi rend="italic">facts</hi>. Are there any Dietetic habits peculiar on the Continent; any public Regulations or approaches to such anywhere: some notices of these or the like would be very interesting. I have surely heard that some Governments do take a certain charge of the People#x2019;s health, as all should. Public Lectures on Regimen would be next to Public Lectures on Morality. Will you touch on this? Can you tell us accurately how Boxers and the like are dieted in England? If so explain it satisfactorily; for it will be new to many. Will any of your Germans tell you how the old Athletes were trained? Can you state any curious particulars about the various diets of nations generally? Say thus much at least: Man can live on all things, from whale-blubber (as in Greenland) to clay-earth (as at the mouth of the Orinoco, see Humboldt).<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Alexander von Humboldt, <hi rend="italic">Tableaux de la Nature</hi> (Paris, <date when="1828-00-00">1828</date>), pp. 188&#x2013;99.</note> Then you have all the Passions &#x26;c influenced by eating; madness itself lying in the stomach: one can go mad at any time one likes, by laying a cupfull of alcohol to the walls of that organ. Excuse these shoulderings at the wheel: I have no force to help you, but if I <hi rend="italic">had</hi>&#x2014;! On the whole, dear Jack, do your best; and <hi rend="italic">exceed not twenty pages;</hi> shorter if you can; brevity for this time will be a great recommendation to you. Looking at what you have done, I should say there was <hi rend="italic">no</hi> fear: but ill-luck has so pursued one in these matters, one knows not what to think. Nay when you have done your <hi rend="italic">best</hi>, stand resolutely up, and say to yourself, <hi rend="italic">I have done it, <foreign>ich kann nicht anders</foreign></hi> [I cannot do otherwise].<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Luther#x2019;s reply at the Diet of Worms to the order that he recant.</note></p>
<p>But by this time dear Brother I suppose you are getting wiser as to the true charms of a Life of Literature, and looking with some earnestness for a deliverance into your profession. God send it! But in <pb id="pg-05-215" n="05:215"/>the meanwhile, Patience! Perseverance! unwearied Diligence! Man has not and cannot have other armour, stand where he may. <supplied>[I]</supplied> read your <hi rend="italic">Demonology</hi> and a Paper on <hi rend="italic">St J.

In this Magazine I see scarcely &#xa3;15 worth. Above all, how did you get <hi rend="italic">me</hi> &#xa3;30, when for all they have yet printed, I could scarcely claim the half of that? Explain, Explain dear Brother, that I may see where both of us are standing.&#x2014; Certainly that <hi rend="italic">Fraser#x2019;s Magazine</hi> gives the most scurvy remuneration of any Periodical extant, and shall have no more stuff of mine at that rate, barring worse fortune than I have yet seen. Solid well-thought writing such as yours for example will not yield a man existence. &#x201C;Come out of her my Brethren, come out of her!&#x201D;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf.

<p>But I have a serious commission for you (trouble, as usual) grounded on these facts.

Do thou get it, my dear Jack, read it well over thyself, and then say what thou thinkest. I can devise some more Biography for Teufelsdreck; give a second deeper part, in the same vein, leading thro#x2019; Religion and the nature of Society, and Lord knows what.

Whether it were worth while to show Fraser the Manuscript (for I think he has not read it) and take counsel with him; or still rather to show Edward Irving it (whose friendliness and feeling of the True, widely as it differs from him, I know) do thou judge. I fear perfect <hi rend="italic">anonymity</hi> is now out of the question; however swear every one to <pb id="pg-05-216" n="05:216"/>secrecy, for I mean to speak fearlessly if at all. <foreign>Basta!

(See the reprinted <hi rend="italic">Spirit of the Age</hi>, ed. Frederick A. Hayek [Chicago, <date when="1942-00-00">1942</date>]). Mill had already paid a visit to France after the <date when="1830-07-00">July</date> revolution and had written letters for the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> about it; and as early as <date when="1828-00-00">1828</date> he had become the friend and correspondent of Gustave d#x2019;Eichthal who had introduced him to the writings of Comte and the St. Simonians. Although Mill does not directly mention the St. Simonian teaching in the first article, Carlyle had at once detected its influence. The direct consequence was that on coming to London later in the year Carlyle &#x201C;hunted out the author&#x201D; of these papers, so Mill told John Sterling in a letter of <date when="1831-10-20">20</date>&#x2013;<date when="1831-10-22">22 Oct.</date>, adding that &#x201C;his acquaintance is the only substantial good I have yet derived&#x201D; from them (Mineka, I, 85, 86).

<salute>My Dear and Honoured Friend,</salute>
<p>I learn with the truest sorrow, by Dr Eckermann#x2019;s Letter,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Eckermann#x2019;s letter to Carlyle, dated <date when="1830-12-06">6</date>&#x2013;<date when="1830-12-07">7 Dec. 1830</date> and published with an English translation by Norton, says in part: &#x201C;Pardon me, that my answer to your last valued letter has been delayed until now. I received it in <date when="1830-04-00">April</date>, the day before setting out for Italy with Herr von Goethe, the son. I returned to Weimar from this journey last week, but alone, for that friend, as you perhaps have seen in the newspapers, closed his earthly course in Rome. His family have keenly felt this loss of a beloved member, but they have gradually submitted to what has unalterably befallen, and have now once more wholly turned back to the living and their concerns. Above all, Goethe#x2019;s high task was not interrupted for a single day; for on all occasions we have to revere in him the principle of mastering useless sorrow by useful activity.
<p>&#x201C;I had returned, however, but a few days, when on the night of the <date when="1830-11-25">25th</date>&#x2013;<date when="1830-11-26">26th of November</date> Goethe awoke with so violent a hemorrhage of the lungs, that his life was in danger, and was only saved by a speedy blood-letting and by the vigour of his constitution. You may imagine that all Weimar was thrown by this into a state of great emotion and no little anxiety. However, on the second day, the encouraging report of his eminent physician, Hofrath Vogel, gave us the best hopes; and, from day to day, Goethe has steadily advanced toward complete recovery, so that he is now again up and busy in his usual ways, although he still remains quietly at home, and avoids, as is desirable, all external excitement. Thus the illness was not fatal, but for the glory of God; and from this striking victory of his incomparable constitution, we derive the most confident hope that we shall yet see him at work, and in complete possession of his powers, for many fair years to come.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Above all, I now look forward to the completion of <hi rend="italic">Faust</hi>, of which so much is finished, that it is no longer to be counted among the impossibilities. &#x2026;&#x201D;</p>
<p>Norton adds a note based on Heinrich D&#xfc;ntzer, <hi rend="italic">Life of Goethe</hi>, trans. Thomas W. Lyster (London, <date when="1883-00-00">1883</date>), II, 416&#x2013;21, saying that Eckermann and August had left Weimar on <date when="1830-04-22">22 April</date>, but that they parted at Genoa on <date when="1830-09-12">12 Sept.</date> because August was galled by Eckermann#x2019;s restraint. He died in Rome on <date when="1830-10-27">27 Oct. 1830</date> and was buried there. Eckermann had returned to Weimar on <date when="1830-11-23">23 Nov.</date> August#x2019;s relations with his father had been uneasy. He drank too much and was not respected in Weimar.</p></note> and the public Journals, what has befallen at Weimar; that you have lost him who was the most precious to you in this world; that your own life, threatened by violent disease, has been in extreme danger. My only consolation is that you yourself are still preserved to us; that you bore your heavy stroke with the heroic wisdom we should have anticipated of you. It is a truth, which we are daily taught in stern lessons, that <pb id="pg-05-219" n="05:219"/>here nothing has a &#x2018;Continuing City#x2019;;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Heb. 13:14.</note> that man#x2019;s life is as &#x2018;a vapour which quickly fleeth away.#x2019;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. James 4:14.</note> Within the bygone Twelvemonth I too have lost no fewer than five of my near relatives: the last, a Sister, peculiarly endeared to me by worth and kind remembrances, whom I now seem to have loved almost more than any other of my kindred. &#x2018;We shall go to them, they shall not return to us.#x2019;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. 2 Sam. 12:23.</note> Meantime, while Days are given us let us employ them: &#x2018;our Field is Time,#x2019;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-05/lt-18301219-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1830-12-19">19 Dec. 1830</date></ref>.</note> what we plant therein has to grow thro#x2019; Eternity: our Hope and Comfort is &#x2018;To work while it is called Today.#x2019;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. John 9:4 and Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi>, p. 197 (the concluding sentence of &#x201C;The Everlasting Yea&#x201D;).</note> And so: Forward! Forward!</p>
<p>What Dr Eckermann mentions of your being busied with a <hi rend="italic">Continuation of Faust</hi> could not be other than great news for me. Pray tell him also that his counsel and admonition about an English version of <hi rend="italic">Faust</hi> came in the right season;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Eckermann had written to Carlyle: &#x201C;It is indeed not for me to offer advice, but if I were in your place, I should certainly undertake something for which my country would be grateful, by employing, for some years, my best leisure hours on a faithful translation of <hi rend="italic">Faust</hi>. The specimens of your <hi rend="italic">Helena</hi> have sufficiently shown, that you not only completely understand the German original, but have also your own language sufficiently at command to express in it the sentiment and meaning with grace and spirit. Lord L. Gower#x2019;s translation may be sufficient for those who do not know the original, and may be valued as the forerunner of a better version, but, critically examined, it seems to be lacking alike in insight and in vigour&#x201D; (Norton, <hi rend="italic">GC</hi>, p. 250).</note> that I had already long been meditating such an enterprise, and had well nigh determined, before much time elapsed, on attempting it. The British world is daily getting readier for a true copy of <hi rend="italic">Faust:</hi> already we everywhere understand that <hi rend="italic">Faust</hi> is no theatrical spectacle, but a Poem; that they who know and can know nothing of it, must also say nothing of it; which, within the last four years, is an immense advancement. Lord L. Gower#x2019;s Translation<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-05/lt-18301115-TC-G-01">TC to G, <date when="1830-11-15">15 Nov. 1830</date></ref>.</note> is now universally admitted to be one of the worst, perhaps the very worst for such a work, ever accomplished in Britain: our Island, I think, owes you some amends; would that I were the man to pay it! As I said, however, I have as good as determined to make the endeavour ere long.</p>
<p>In an early Number of the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review</hi>, perhaps in the next, there is to appear as I learn, a criticism of the <hi rend="italic">Briefwechsel</hi> [<hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi>], involving most probably a delineation and comparison of <pb id="pg-05-220" n="05:220"/>the two great Correspondents. I must warn all German Friends to expect but little: the Critic,<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Empson, Jeffrey#x2019;s son-in-law. For his review of the <hi rend="italic">Correspondence between Goethe and Schiller</hi>, see the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review</hi>, LIII (<date when="1831-03-00">March 1831</date>), 82&#x2013;104.</note> I apprehend, will be the same who criticised <hi rend="italic">Faust</hi> and Lord Gower in the last Number of that Periodical: an admiring Dilettantism, but no true insight or earnest Criticism is to be looked for.&#x2014; I too am again to speak a word on that favourite subject; a word of warning and direction, where the harvest is great, and the reapers many and more zealous than experienced.<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Matt. 9:37.</note> A certain William Taylor of Norwich, the Translator of your <hi rend="italic">Iphigenie</hi> has written what he calls a Historic <hi rend="italic">Survey of German Poetry;</hi> the tendency of which you may judge of sufficiently by this one fact, that the longest Article but one is on August von Kotzebue.<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A popular dramatist (<date when="1761-00-00">1761</date>&#x2013;<date when="1819-00-00">1819</date>), whose sentimental plays enjoyed an extraordinary vogue in England in the last years of the eighteenth century. Cf. <ref target="volume-01/lt-18190329-TC-AC-01"><sic>1:173</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1819-03-29">29 March 1819</date></corr></ref>.

His <hi rend="italic">Iphigenia in Taurus: a Tragedy</hi> was published in London in <date when="1793-00-00">1793</date>.</note> Taylor is a man of real talent; but a Polemical Sceptic only; with no eye for Poetry, who sees in the highest minds only their relation to the Church Creed; whose Book therefore, as likely to mislead many, I have felt called upon to contradict, and by such artillery as I had batter down into its original rubbish. I fear, you will not like the satirical style: the more agreeable will some concluding speculations be on what I have named <hi rend="italic">World-Literature</hi>, after you; and how Europe, in the communion of these its chief writers, is again to have a &#x2018;Sacred College and Council of Amphictyons,#x2019; and become more and more one universal Commonwealth.<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XXVII, 370. The Amphictyony was a religious league of ancient Greek city-states participating in the cult of a common deity. For &#x201C;world literature,&#x201D; see <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310121-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1831-01-21">21 Jan.</date></ref></note> This, it seems to me, is one of the most cheering signs of the future that are yet discernible: Literature is now nearly all in all to us; not our Speech only, but our Worship and Law-giving; our best Priest must henceforth be our Poet; the <foreign><hi rend="italic">Vates</hi></foreign> [prophet] will in future be practically all that he ever was in theory,&#x2014;or else Nothing, which last consummation we cannot consent to admit. The <hi rend="italic">Review of Taylor</hi> is not to appear for some months:<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >It appeared in the <date when="1831-03-00">March</date> issue of the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review</hi>.</note> in the meanwhile, I am working at another curious enterprise of my own, which is yet too amorphous to be prophecied of.<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Sartor Resartus.</hi></note></p>
<p>Leaving now these paper speculations, let me descend a little to the <pb id="pg-05-221" n="05:221"/>solid Earth. We have a mild winter here, are busy and peaceable; often look into that Weimar House, and figure our Friend and Master there, and pray for all blessings on him. A little collection of Memorials, intended to cross the Sea, is also gathering itself together: we anticipate that before the next <date when="1831-08-28">28<hi rend="italic">th</hi> of August</date>, at all events, it will have saluted you. I have already got nearly all my writings for the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Review;</hi> and will send them in the shape of <foreign><hi rend="italic">Aush&#xE4;ngebogen</hi></foreign> [last proof], since they are yet in no other. Learning from your <hi rend="italic">Tag-und-Jahres-Heft</hi> [<hi rend="italic">Day and Year Journal</hi>] that you had no Copy of the English <hi rend="italic">Iphigenie</hi>,<note n="15" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle had received Goethe#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Tag- und Jahres-Heft</hi> as vols. 31 and 32 of the <hi rend="italic">Vollst&#xE4;ndige Ausgabe letzter Hand</hi>, the revised version of his collected works which Goethe was seeing through the press at this time and sending on to Carlyle as the volumes were published. Carlyle read of Goethe#x2019;s not having a copy of Taylor#x2019;s translation of the <hi rend="italic">Iphigenie</hi> in XXXI (Stuttgart and T&#xfc;bingen, <date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>), 36 (see in the standard edition, <hi rend="italic">Goethes Werke</hi> [Weimar, <date when="1892-00-00">1892</date>], XXXV, 36). L. L. Mackall, writing in <date when="1902-00-00">1902</date>&#x2013;<date when="1903-00-00">3</date>, notes that in spite of Goethe#x2019;s statement to the contrary in the <hi rend="italic">Tag- und Jahres-Heft</hi> (under the year <date when="1794-00-00">1794</date>) there was in his library in Weimar an uncut copy of Taylor#x2019;s translation of <date when="1793-00-00">1793</date> as well as a copy of the <date when="1794-00-00">1794</date> Berlin reprint of it. Goethe also lamented not having a copy of the English translation of <hi rend="italic">Iphigenie</hi> in a letter of <date when="1831-03-09">9 March 1831</date> to K. F. Zelter. See <hi rend="italic">Goethes Briefe</hi> (Weimar, <date when="1909-00-00">1909</date>), XLVIII, 143&#x2013;44.</note> I sent to London to procure one; hitherto without effect: however, as the work stands entire in this <hi rend="italic">Taylor#x2019;s Historic Survey</hi>, I will study to send it in one or the other form.<note n="16" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The copy of Taylor#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Historical Survey</hi> which Carlyle sent Goethe belonged not to him but to Macvey Napier, who had lent it to him for use in writing his review. Carlyle was in a hurry and could not get another copy, so sent Napier#x2019;s, with a red thread tied around the pages of the translation of <hi rend="italic">Iphigenie</hi>. See <ref target="volume-06/lt-18320528-TC-MN-01">TC to MN, <date when="1832-05-28">28 May 1832</date></ref>.
<p>In a letter from Weimar of <date when="1852-09-20">20 Sept. 1852</date> Carlyle wrote to Jane that &#x201C;on the book-shelves&#x201D; of Goethe#x2019;s house &#x201C;I found the last book I ever sent Goethe&#x2014;Taylor#x2019;s &#x2018;Survey of German Poetry#x2019;; and a crumb of paper torn from some scroll of my own (Johnson, as I conjectured), still sticking in, after twenty years&#x201D; (Froude, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi>, IV, 113).</p></note> Some weeks ago we heard of a wandering Portrait-painter being at Dumfries, who took what were called admirable likenesses, in pencil, at two hours#x2019; sitting: whereupon we drove down, and set the Artist to work; who unhappily produced, by way of Portrait for me, a piece of beautiful pencilling, which had no feature of mine about it; so that it cannot be sent to Weimar, being worth nothing: however, my Wife has undertaken to copy and rectify it; at all events, to clip you some profile of me.<note n="17" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Goethe responded to Jane#x2019;s efforts with an irreverent little poem. Though in some editions it is entitled &#x201C;<foreign>Auf ein Bild Carlyles</foreign>&#x201D; [On a Picture of Carlyle], in the Weimar edition it is titled simply &#x201C;of Craigenputtock / Dumfries Scotland.&#x201D; The following text is from <hi rend="italic">Goethes Werke</hi> (Weimar, <date when="1910-00-00">1910</date>), V (part 2), 368:<lb/><lb/>

A literal translation might be:<lb/><lb/>

<p>The Saint-Simonians in Paris have again transmitted me a large mass of their performances: Expositions of their Doctrine; Proclamations sent forth during the famous Three Days; many Numbers of their weekly Journal. They seem to me to be earnest, zealous, and nowise ighorant men, but wandering in strange paths. I should say, they have discovered and laid to heart this momentous and now almost forgotten truth, <hi rend="italic">Man is still a Man;</hi><note n="18" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310517-TC-GE-01">TC to GE, <date when="1831-05-17">17 May</date></ref>, and Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi>, p. 296.</note> and are already beginning to make false applications of it. I have every disposition to follow your advice, and stand apart from them; looking on their Society and its progress nevertheless as a true and remarkable Sign of these Times.</p>
<p>In our own Country too the political atmosphere grows turbid, and great things are fermenting, and will long ferment. To which also I reckon that my proper relation is that chiefly of Spectator: the world is heavily struggling out into a new era; the struggle has lasted centuries, and may yet last centuries: let him who has seed-corn, or can borrow seed-corn, cast it into these troubled Nile-waters, where, in due season, it will be found after many days. Some of our friends are high in the New Ministry, especially the Edinburgh-Reviewer of <hi rend="italic">Meister</hi>, a good man and bad critic:<note n="19" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jeffrey, now Lord Advocate in Grey#x2019;s new ministry.</note> but the Sun and Seasons are the only changes that visit the wilderness. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Mein Acker ist die Zeit.</hi></foreign><note n="20" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Time is my seed-field.&#x201D; See <ref target="volume-05/lt-18301219-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1830-12-19">19 Dec. 1830</date></ref>.</note></p>
<p>Perhaps ere long a Letter will come from Weimar to tell us that you are still well, and nobly occupied. Meanwhile know always that we love you and reverence you.

<salute>My Dear Jane,</salute>
<p>I have just finished a Letter to our Mother; but must not let the Parcel go without a word for you, to whom indeed some of my chief commissions must be directed.</p>
<p>We were very much obliged by your punctual tidings about my Father, concerning whom we are still very anxious, and not without hopes of hearing something tomorrow. Alick saw Pate Easton<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Peter Easton. See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18210324-TC-AC-01"><sic>1:347</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1821-03-24">24 March 1821</date></corr></ref>.</note> last Wednesday, but could get no nearer tidings. It was very kind of you, my <foreign>lassie</foreign>, since there was no other to write, that you took that trouble: I have only to beg and enjoin you to repeat it regularly and <hi rend="italic">often</hi>. Tell us especially how our Father is (there are no remedies for Cold but &#x201C;flannel and physic&#x201D;), whether our Mother keeps stout, and all that goes on amongst you.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday Alick and I saw you (after a sort): we went to the top of Darngarroch hill (the hill that lies over Blackmark Moor), and there, the day being very bright, saw far and wide. New-Galloway, Kirkcudbright, Castle-Douglas: Burnswark was as plain as need be; and of course Scotsbrig could not be far. You seemed to have more snow than we, for indeed all our hills were black: however, since then we have had our turn; yesterday was a deliberate slow persevering day of snow-showers; and this day has been quite an adventure that way. A fierce frosty wind is drifting all into heaps: our kitchen door which has not been opened stands sunk half way up in a boiling <supplied>[? drift;]</supplied><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Useable&#x201D; written over the word, possibly by Carlyle. A few words are obscure because the page is stained. On the destructive effects of the snowstorm, see <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310210-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1831-02-10">10 Feb.</date></ref></note> all day it has whirled and heaped itself about this (the Library) window; and we have kept up a constant <hi rend="italic">fire</hi> against Frost ourselves and every thing else under strict lock and key. To complete the matter our Maid went away on Sabbathday to see her friends, and how the foolish creature is to get up again (unless in Alick#x2019;s bacon-carts) I see not. However, I have foddered and watered <pb id="pg-05-224" n="05:224"/>the cattle; to the very Hens, to so many of them as I could entice down, I have given <hi rend="italic">malt</hi> (of which we had a little <hi rend="italic">pot</hi>): I wheeled fuel and water round in abundance; Jane has been cooking all day within doors; and I have smoked and read. The wind still howls and whistles; but we hope it will abate tomorrow. This surely will be the last storm of the season.</p>
<p>We thought Jamie would have come up in the frost; but suppose he cannot get away. Tell him that with regard to the <hi rend="italic">Meal</hi> there is no hurry: Mrs Welsh has sent us a sack of very good stuff, so that <hi rend="italic">ten</hi> stone more will keep us I know not how long. Tell Jamie, however, to bring us a couple of bushels of good <hi rend="italic">horse-corn</hi> instead when he comes. I want a little stock for summer and know not where or how to buy it here.</p>
<p>You tell me, my dear Jean, that you are more solitary now: indeed your position has greatly altered within the last year, and you now, young as you are, have to take a kind of <hi rend="italic">front</hi> rank.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On the death of Margaret (<date when="1830-06-22">22 June 1830</date>) Jean had become the oldest of the unmarried sisters.</note> Study my dear Sister to acquit yourself well in it. There, as in all scenes of life, you will find that from your own judgement, and your own conscience the best help must be sought. For our Margaret who sleeps now in her silent rest it is vain to mourn: I think of her daily, hourly, not in sorrow so much as in awe and love; and trust the Almighty may one day restore her to us, and us to her, in some holier world than this: nay who knows but she may even now in some inscrutably mysterious way be near us: <hi rend="italic">we</hi> are spirits as well as she, and God is round us and in us, Here as well as Yonder! Let us not weep for her, but try rather to honour her memory by imitating the good that made her dear to us. Cultivate that quiet purity of heart, that silent justness and firmness of resolve that we saw in her; be wise and meek <supplied>[and hum]</supplied>ble as she was. In some points, I shall hardly see her like again. She had a fairness and loving tolerance in judging of her neighbours, which is perhaps of all virtues the rarest among women. Fewer <hi rend="italic">idle</hi> words were perhaps spoken by scarcely any. The mind shone within her like a clear, modest lamp, enlightening all her goings: thus she could travel thro#x2019; her earthly course unspotted as few are, and now lies enshrined in all our hearts forever. God is great, God is good:<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-05/lt-18301023-TC-G-01">TC to G, <date when="1830-10-23">23 Oct. 1830</date></ref>, and <ref target="volume-06/lt-18330210-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1833-02-10">10 Feb. 1833</date></ref>.</note> if it is <hi rend="italic">His</hi> Will we shall meet again, and part no more.</p>
<p>It is very gratifying to me, my dear Jean, to think that in several respects you resemble her that is away. One great virtue I have seen <pb id="pg-05-225" n="05:225"/>and often praised in you, that of Truth: nay I think if one could never <hi rend="italic">tell a lie</hi> (to one#x2019;s own heart, which is the worst to do), one had mastered the whole secret of virtue. Persist in what you see to be good and your duty; be patient, gentle, submissive even to <hi rend="italic">ill</hi> usage: what are we that we should be <hi rend="italic">well</hi> used? Did they use Jesus of Nazareth well? Above all, avoid vanity, self-conceit, Presumption of all sorts: want of <hi rend="italic">Humility</hi> (which is a deep and glorious feeling could we see into it) is simply the want of all Religion, of all true Moral worth. I know this by the best of all teachers, Experience. Humility is no mean feeling, but the highest, and only high one; the <hi rend="italic">denial of Self</hi> it is, and therein is the beginning of all that is truly generous and noble.&#x2014; Be kind to every one, especially to our Father and Mother; one never <hi rend="italic">repents</hi> kindness; a thousand times one does the want of it,&#x2014;when repentance is too late.&#x2014; Write to me with all freedom as to your Brother that loves you. Kindest remembrances to all and every one. <closer><salute>God be with you</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My Dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I have a parcel of Books here, which Jack has sent for you; and as Alick sets off tomorrow with his Pork for the Market, I forward them with him. Jack#x2019;s Parcel came by way of Edinburgh about ten days ago, but no Letter with it either for you or me or any one: I wrote to him last week, rather in the complaining style so far as that matter went: it is possible that I may hear from him tomorrow; but more likely not till next Wednesday: in either case I will send you down word by the earliest opportunity. You would get no <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> this week; for none came hither, by what mischance I have not yet learned. Jack#x2019;s last Letter mentioned his writing some Essay or other for the Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Review; perhaps he was so busy with it, that he neglected the Post hour.</p>
<p>I have a great body of little bits of things to tell you, which are hardly worth putting on paper. You will learn the main thing, when I tell you that we are all in the usual state of health and activity; struggling on in our Solitude, as well as the times will <pb id="pg-05-226" n="05:226"/>allow. None of us are growing a penny richer; but we have wherewith to keep <hi rend="italic">mall in shaft</hi> (worse or better wedged); and that is all that man can expect, or even desire on this side of Time: let us bruise away, and beat lustily with that same <hi rend="italic">Mall</hi>, so long as it will hold together, and fear nothing.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The figure is that of the &#x201C;mall&#x201D; or hammer-head into which the &#x201C;shaft&#x201D; or handle has been tightly wedged so that the tool is ready for use. The phrase means &#x201C;to keep things going.&#x201D; Cf. <ref target="volume-05/lt-18291027-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1829-10-27">27 Oct. 1829</date></ref>.</note> I have written a piece of a Review for the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh</hi>, and am hovering about the materials of a Book, which I have so long talked of: one day or other it <hi rend="italic">must</hi> out. My Review, which is about some foolish German matter, worth little, will not be published for three months. I sent it off a week ago; and in my Letter to the Editor, mentioned that Jack had one that was likely to follow. I hope they will accept the poor Doctor#x2019;s Paper, for these are bad times to live by scribbling in: and the Doctor has no channel for his meditations so profitable as this would be. At the same time, I am hardly sorry that he feels the pinch of difficulty in this <hi rend="italic">Literary</hi> way of Life, which is not <hi rend="italic">his</hi>, and fit for him, as the <hi rend="italic">medical</hi> would be: many a time he has vexed me with his foolish talk about the &#x201C;happiness&#x201D; of living by Literature; and it was in vain for me to assure him that in point of &#x201C;happiness&#x201D; such a life was but like its neighbours. <hi rend="italic">Now</hi> he may try it and see. Sooner or later, it <hi rend="italic">must</hi> come to Medicine. I am glad in the meanwhile to think that he is among kind and wise Friends; not alone in that great living wilderness. Still more that he is an honest, talented man, tho#x2019; practically but unwise. Sooner or later, as I have often said, he will learn the ground he stands on, and proceed to the work that is <hi rend="italic">fit</hi> for him.&#x2014; I received all the <hi rend="italic">Socks</hi> (that is <hi rend="italic">two</hi> parcels), but have yet had no free opportunity of sending them: I told him of them, a while ago.</p>
<p>We had a Letter from Goethe, or rather from Goethe#x2019;s Secretary, with a short kind postscript from Goethe to tell that he was &#x2018;still in the land of the living and beside his loved ones.#x2019;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In Norton#x2019;s translation Goethe#x2019;s postscript to Eckermann#x2019;s letter of <date when="1830-12-06">6 December 1830</date> reads as follows: &#x201C;Happily I can add with my own hand that I am alive, and may hope yet for a time to abide with my loved ones. Greetings and blessings to the dear Pair. Your two letters have arrived, and the one for Berlin has been forwarded&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">GC,</hi> pp. 251&#x2013;52).</note> He has lost his only son (far from him, travelling in Italy); and has had a violent fit of sickness (a flux of blood), so that for two days his own life <supplied>[was de]</supplied>spaired of. He bore his son#x2019;s death like a hero; &#x2018;did not <supplied>[cease]</supplied> from his Labours for a single day.#x2019;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Eckermann-TC, <date when="1830-12-06">6 Dec. 1830</date>, in Norton, <hi rend="italic">GC</hi>, p. 248.</note> I have written to him all that was <pb id="pg-05-227" n="05:227"/>kind: engaged among other things to translate his Poem of <hi rend="italic">Faust</hi>, which I reckoned would be a gratification to him. If my own <hi rend="italic">Book</hi> were out, I would begin it with alacrity.</p>
<p>Alick has yet heard nothing about Craigenputtoch farm; tho#x2019; tomorrow is the term for something being settled concerning it. I had a long talk with him on that subject tonight; gave him my best counsel, but of course nothing can be <hi rend="italic">done</hi>, till we see farther what course matters take. No one has mentioned a whisper of it to me for the last three months. I do not know what chance he has for it; or whether a true friend would so much as wish him to continue in it. There are many chances and paths for an active little fellow beside this moorland one; and if he do leave it, he will not leave it empty-handed. <hi rend="italic">My</hi> duty in the meantime is to look and listen, and <hi rend="italic">hold my tongue</hi>.&#x2014; I am very glad to see that his Wife seems to &#x201C;answer the end&#x201D;: he looks a good deal happier since he wedded: and if more burden may also have more ballast, in future.&#x2014; Alas dear Mother! the end of the sheet is here already. I had innumerable things to say&#x2014;all meaning this: that I am still struggling forward as of old, and still full of affection for you. I <hi rend="italic">read the Testament</hi>. <closer><salute>God always bless you my dear Mother! &#x2014;<supplied>[you]</supplied>r affectionate Son,</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name></p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>About a year ago, Mr Tait,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Tait.</note> Bookseller in Edinburgh, was at pains to inform me that my name had the honour of being known to you; that you were not disinclined, should occasion offer, to have some literary communication with me.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Westminster Review</hi> is one of the few Periodicals which I make an effort to see; the talent, learning, and intrepid, decisive spirit <pb id="pg-05-228" n="05:228"/>of that Journal are clear to me, as they are to the world. With not a few grounds of dissent I discern there one quality which ought to cover a multitude of errors, and is in these days among the rarest: namely, a total, uncompromising contempt of <hi rend="italic">Cant</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Dilettantism</hi>, in all shapes; a resolution to speak the Truth so far as it is seen into and can be spoken; a feeling that the Truth is <hi rend="italic">infinitely</hi> precious and alone worthy of being spoken. This to my view is the first condition of all worth in journal or in man; and the sure root of more and more worth: indeed what I call the &#x2018;errors#x2019; of the <hi rend="italic">Westminster Review</hi> are rather shortcomings than errors. For yourself also, give me leave to say that your character is known to me from private as well as public sources; neither am I without sense for merit of that kind. On all which grounds, as I informed your Edinburgh Agent, my good-will fully corresponds with your own; and it would give me real pleasure should some closer relation spring up between us.</p>
<p>Now it chances, at this time, that I could furnish you with a little Essay on the <hi rend="italic">Nibelungen Lied</hi>, calculated for English readers; on which subject there has been some curiosity excited among us, and little or no intelligible information given.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Bowring agreed. Carlyle#x2019;s essay appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Westminster Review</hi>, XV (<date when="1831-07-00">July 1831</date>), 1&#x2013;45; it was part of the unpublished history of German literature.</note> In my mind also are various other topics, of considerably more importance, for which it strikes me, the <hi rend="italic">Westminster Review</hi> might be among the fittest vehicles. May I request you therefore to say by your earliest convenience whether that Paper on the <hi rend="italic">Nibelungen</hi> would be likely to prove of any service to you, whether such likelihood is worth the trouble of copying it and sending it? What farther is to follow will by and by determine itself.</p>

Carlyle is replying to John#x2019;s letter of <date when="1831-01-31">31 Jan.</date>, which reads in part: &#x201C;You are right in regard to your complaints about the brevity of my letters. I might plead many excuses indeed to extenuate my fault but I think you will be more pleased to hear that I have really made a resolution to write at greater length in future, and that I keep all my resolutions. This then is to be my last short hurried letter. &#x2026; I should like very well if we could so arrange as to write every week. &#x2026; Badams lent me &#xa3;45 sometime ago, I have received about &#xa3;16 for your articles &#x26; for my own; first &#x26; last, somewhat more than &#xa3;20. If my taylor#x2019;s account, part of which only is due, were paid, I should have but two or three pounds remaining. And as to getting more: Montagu is not in a condition to lend money to any man, &#x26; indeed I have resolved never to borrow any from him. Badams also is much involved in difficulties&#x2014;among low-minded, ravenous, cunning people, who torture him very much tho#x2019; he bears it stoutly &#x26; calmly. &#x2026; Fraser too has reduced his pay to &#xa3;7 per sheet, except for yourself &#x2018;and one or two first rate contributors#x2019; as he told me na&#xEF;vely enough. &#x2026; I felt sorry for poor Fraser, rather than angry at him, for he has already expended a large sum on the magazine without adequate return. &#x2026; It will only be necessary to add that it costs me about two pounds a-week here, &#x26; that I have no paying practice &#x26; no reasonable expectation of any for some time to come. &#x2026; I am not half so dreary &#x26; crushed down, as I used to be after returning from Germany. &#x2026; Two papers are still in Fraser#x2019;s hands, &#x26; I have another for the New Monthly of which Campbell is no longer editor&#x2014;Poor Campbell! I will speak of him in my next letter&#x2014; Proctor will give me introduction to Editor. And then here is my weary treatise on digestion, which I do not calculate upon the success of. &#x2026; I have got your papers from Fraser. Those thoughts on Clothes must not be given to him. I have read them very hastily over, &#x26; my impression is that they contain a great deal, &#x26; if put into a somewhat more acceptable shape would doubtless produce a great impression at present. The first part seemed too long &#x26; too German. &#x2026; I think I shall show it to Irving. &#x2026; Of course H. Inglis did not need my poor assistance here in search of his sister. I knew how you had come to direct him to me. It could only be the hurry &#x26; sympathy of the moment that made you forget he had powerful friends in London. The newspaper story of his sister <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> be true. She is said to have been found again as you may have heard ere now. I &#x2026; think he must have left town. &#x2026;&#x201D;</sourceNote><head>

<salute>My Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I was much obliged by your long full and confidential Letter; and much gratified tho#x2019; the news it brought us were none of the <pb id="pg-05-229" n="05:229"/>brightest. It is something to see the worst, and to feel that, at the worst, we are still <hi rend="italic">united</hi>, and prepared to struggle and to hope together.</p>
<p>You said, I was not to write again till another Letter arrived. Now Alick brought us no Letter, no <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, last night; tho#x2019; doubtless both are on the road for us, and only detained by mud and wet. He is to be down again tomorrow or on Saturday, and as I am writing to the Advocate<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jeffrey.</note> at any rate, I will disobey your direction for once; preparing also to follow it, when it shall be more clearly revealed. Last Newspaper, and the second before that are the only two that have ever yet failed us: the latter, by accident in London, did not get here till its successor also was ready; the former, detained by accident on the way hither, <hi rend="italic">will</hi> reach us safely. We feel your punctuality to be a very great blessing; used as we were to quite the contrary. I also warmly approve of your project of weekly Letters; if we can <pb id="pg-05-230" n="05:230"/>find <hi rend="italic">frank</hi> it will be a great happiness to both of us: nay without franks, one may cram a whole shilling#x2019;s worth, with care, into any large sheet, when the Correspondents are wise and brothers.</p>
<p>I view your situation in London with true sympathy yet with some pride and entire confidence. The most grievous part of it, which however is probably for you the happiest, is that it is <hi rend="italic">my</hi> debt you are in straits for. I have not at this time any power of repaying you; unless that shilly-shally Editor<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >J. G. Cochrane, editor of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Quarterly Review</hi>.</note> will print my stuff, and be done with it. Nevertheless tell me, and you shall not be driven utterly to the wall. I have various possibilities, yet unexhausted: I have a great useless mare, in foal, which I can send to market were summer here: one way or other, we must and shall come thro; so fear nothing. My only prayer is that you had <hi rend="italic">any</hi> medical practice, were it never so little; and could bid <foreign>adieu</foreign> forever to that despicable Author-trade. Doubtless you yourself are full of this same feeling; and will hail your first fee, like the dawn of day. Meantime practice <foreign>gratis</foreign>, practice <hi rend="italic">any</hi> way rather than no way: it is your only chance and hope. And so Courage! Courage! We are young and the world#x2019;s wide.</p>
<p>I have yet heard nothing of my Article from Macvey, and nothing of yours, which I hope will answer. At any rate, as you said, there is a sure reward for you, in the increase of your own knowledge, and the consciousness of right endeavour. Let the issue then be as it will. From Cochrane I have received no whisper of tidings, and so about three weeks ago, I sent word to Moir that he was to require back the <hi rend="italic">Ms</hi>. (it was he who had delivered it) and forward it hither by the Mail. Moir writes<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In his letter of <date when="1831-01-24">24 Jan.</date></note> directly that C. has been detained by the indolence of his London publishers &#x26;c, but shall be seen in a few hours, and the Papers forwarded, with his own account of the matter. I expect it shortly, now that the roads are again open. Meanwhile I have sent a Letter to Dr Bowring (keep this quite private), offering him a paper on the <hi rend="italic">Nibelungen Lied</hi>, and some farther connexion, if he like, as he gave me to know thro#x2019; Tait of Edinburgh last year that he did. We shall see in two weeks what this produces. Probably nothing, in which case no matter. My plan is, you see, to get some kind of <hi rend="italic">financial</hi> work for myself, to keep house with, and in the mean time to labour at my Teufelsdreck Book, and bring it up to London in my pocket so soon as it is ready. The <hi rend="italic">whole</hi> perplexity comes of that thrice and four times accursed <hi rend="italic">Literary History</hi>, which has thrown me a whole year behind all my old connections, most of <pb id="pg-05-231" n="05:231"/>which accordingly are broken. Nevertheless I will one day sell that book too, for there is some morselkin of stuff in it: and in the mean while, I feel a kind of contemptuous courage; there being material enough in my head, I shall one day find publishers enough.</p>
<p>I can tell you of no news here. You will see by the Newspaper what a storm we have had, and how poor wayfarers have even perished in it.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >There were heavy snowstorms in the week following <date when="1831-01-21">21 Jan.</date>, with widespread hardship to farmers and travellers. The driver and guard of the Edinburgh coach were lost and died of exposure. Dumfries and Galloway <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi>, <date when="1831-02-01">1</date> and <date when="1831-02-10">10 Feb.</date>; <hi rend="italic">Scotsman</hi>, <date when="1831-02-05">5 Feb.</date></note> Your last week#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi> will not reach you till Saturday, the country was all blocked up here, we did not even send it off till yesterday. Alick was out in almost the worst of the snow with his Pork, for Dumfries, where also he could find no market, but struggled on to Annan, and returned to us on Friday. His leg was sprained when he left home, but at the first huge snow-wreath he leapt down, and the sprain altogether disappeared. There is a medical fact for you. Commend me to a man who like Tom Garthwaite can &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">work oot the streen</hi>&#x201D; [work out the strain].&#x2014; Craigenputtoch farm is not yet settled, but will be so ere long, and you shall hear the issue. Alick sets a resolute front to the matter, and has stuff in him to make a shift elsewhere, if ousted here. From Scotsbrig there are no tidings; the last intelligence was a Letter from Jean, that they were all well, except our Father, whose cold was &#x2018;much in the old way.#x2019; I hope, he is better by this time: before that last attack, he had become extremely <hi rend="italic">dietetic</hi>, quite positive in regard to these matters; and was much healthier. I have got a stock of warm <hi rend="italic">socks</hi> for you here, carefully manufactured by our Mother; and only wait an opportunity to send them. Ploughing is <hi rend="italic">far</hi> back, and the poor are threatened with scarcity. Other news we have none, and could have none, lying here in the uttermost parts of the Earth.</p>
<p>For the last fortnight I have scarcely been writing any: I wait anxiously for the Parcel from Edinburgh, with news from my Editors; that I might get my Review work over, and then take me to my <hi rend="italic">Book</hi>. I am a little comforted by your view of <hi rend="italic">Teufelsdreck</hi>, which agrees with my own: neither is it of any consequence whether you show it to Edward Irving or not; if you have done so, well and good, if you felt inclined to do so, it were still indifferent; if not, do not. They can throw no new light on the business; and I believe, myself, that possibly I may make something of the work, and therefore shall try. It is full of dross, but there is also metal in it, and the thing still lives and <pb id="pg-05-232" n="05:232"/>produces with me. I have also undertaken at some future day to translate <hi rend="italic">Faust:</hi> the venerable <foreign><hi rend="italic">Alte</hi></foreign> [Old Man] has written to me since his sad visitation, he &#x2018;can still linger for a season among his loved ones#x2019;:<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Norton, <hi rend="italic">GC</hi>, p. 251.</note> a letter of mine is by this time in his hands. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Gott mit Ihm!</hi></foreign> [The Lord be with him!]</p>
<p>The confinement during these snow tempests has done me no good: I can study almost none, except walking, or sometimes, lying in bed. Did you go to the Stracheys? O tell me <hi rend="italic">all</hi> about these people and Badams and the Irvings, and most of all <hi rend="italic">about yourself</hi>. Never shut up your heart from me, that is your only offence. Think no shame of your Poverty, I am often almost proud of mine. Think of the great Jean Paul, and of so many thousand other heroes! Striving all the while with our utmost energy to widen our field of action to become lord of our world, let us take defeat lightly: it is good for us. We all salute you in love. <closer><salute>God bless our Brother.&#x2014; /</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name></p>
<ps><p>Did you say that you had taken the Paper<hi rend="italic">s</hi> from Fraser? I care not a straw for one of them except <hi rend="italic">T</hi>k (which keep carefully), and wish them all printed and turned into money <foreign><hi rend="italic">je cher je lieber</hi></foreign> [the more expensive the better].<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle mixes French with German idiom.</note> I wish we saw your new Letter, or do I look for one in vain?</p>
<p>I fear, Alick will <hi rend="italic">not</hi> go tomorrow, not till Saturday&#x2014;Good night, Good night, dear Brother!</p></ps>

<salute>My Dear Jack,</salute>
<p>We have had three Letters from you, only the first of which, the one that came during the snow has been answered. Whether you have yet received that Answer your last communication, that contained in the <hi rend="italic">Teufelsdreck Ms.</hi> which we got safe on Wednesday, does not positively indicate: however I think it almost certain; the Letter being enclosed to Jeffrey, of whose receiving thereof we have since (thro#x2019; Mrs Montague<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In her letter of <date when="1831-02-21">21 Feb.</date></note>) had indirect evidence.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-05-233" n="05:233"/>Your last Post Letter was excellent; of the kind they should all be: you cannot fancy what interest such notices, as the many there given, have for us here.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John#x2019;s letter of <date when="1831-02-12">12 Feb.</date>, well packed with news and comment concerning Lockhart, George Irving, William Fraser, Edward Irving, Henry Drummond, Francis Jeffrey, Lord Brougham, William Glen, Mrs. Montagu, Bryan Procter, the MS of what became <hi rend="italic">Sartor Resartus</hi>, and Carlyle#x2019;s article on Schiller. Some excerpts follow: &#x201C;I did not care to show the MS <supplied>[of &#x201C;Thoughts on Clothes&#x201D;]</supplied> to William Fraser, for he is not to be calculated upon in any undertaking, and will not tell you clearly &#x26; plainly what he thinks. He is indeed full of kindness &#x26; very ready to oblige; but there is a want of courage about him&#x2014;of steadiness, a spirit of accommodation, &#x2018;a law in his members warring,#x2019; which prevent him from being capable of giving wise direction or effectual assistance. You would pity him much if you knew how he is harrassed with cunning lowminded booksellers, ill health, disappointments, vanities. I think there is more in him than you give him credit for, if it could find vent thro#x2019; all the base obstructions that crush &#x26; deform it. He esteems you highly, &#x26; says that he &#x2018;never began to think at all till he read your writings.#x2019; You are thus a sort of first intellectual love with him, &#x26; may be be [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] of great advantage to him when you come to London. &#x2026; On taking it [the MS of &#x201C;Thoughts on Clothes&#x201D;] to Irving I read the part of your letter where you speak of it, &#x26; explained the whole matter as well as I could. He seemed moved &#x26; gratified at being so applied to. On friday morning last, I went to have his deliverance, &#x26; found he had &#x2018;been expecting me for three or four days.#x2019; I can only give you the substance of what he said. He &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">perfectly agreed with you in what you had said about religion &#x26; the state of society,</hi>#x2019; &#x26; wished much it were in his power to talk largely with you of these matters. You had shown great power, &#x26; copiousness &#x26; &#x2018;learning.#x2019; The MS might be altered &#x26; expanded into a book likely to produce a great &#x26; salutary impression at the present time. The character of Teufelsdreck,&#x2014;the meaning of which name, by the way, he seemed to have no conception of&#x2014;he thought was very graphically &#x26; &#x2018;humourously#x2019; drawn. He submitted, at the same time; that there was perhaps too little action in proportion to the machinery employed; that the preliminary matter of the first chapter was too long; that you seemed to have poured out the rich flood of your own thoughts, without caring whether the reader might feel it possible to keep pace with you, or bear the load of ideas you were heaping upon him. All these deficiencies were attributable to your having written for the Magazine. More subdivisions, more resting points, might make the work more acceptable &#x26; effectual.&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;These are the chief parts of what I elicited from him; and he promised if it sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be possible to write you himself &#x26; tell you at length what he thought but he is very much harrassed at present &#x26; I think will not find proper leisure. You will get his letter along with this if he sends one.
I had almost forgot to say that he wished to show the MS to a M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Drummond (a Banker) here &#x26; consult him about it. He is an admirer of your articles in the Foreign &#x26; Ed<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Reviews. I objected that the paper was in too imperfect a state to be shown to any stranger; but said Mr D. might perhaps be consulted afterwards.&#x2014; As to my own opinion, it is substantially the same as Irving<supplied>[#x2019;]</supplied>s. I think you have materials enough for a book that w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> make a great impression, if you could work these materials into a more light &#x26; easy form, &#x26; give them more life &#x26; action. Could any thing like a story be made? It is the thing w<hi rend="italic">d sell</hi> best &#x26; take most effect. Irving thinks one cannot make any thing by honest writing of books, but only by writing for Reviews &#x26;c.; and he speaks from experience. I do not believe it would be possible to find any bookseller to undertake the publication of a first volume; but if the whole were finished I do not think it would be difficult to find one on advantageous terms,&#x2014;indeed I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> engage to find one myself.&#x2014; You must come hither yourself this very spring if possible &#x26; see what is going on. &#x2026; You would soon collect a number of young people who are striving after better things &#x26; without any guidance. I know some such myself &#x26; they are almost my only associates. The one I like best and think most highly of is a Mr Glen&#x2014;son of a late clergyman in Galloway. He has greater talents &#x26; more courage to use them than any young man I know. Edward Irving is the only <hi rend="italic">established</hi> person I am acquainted with who is <hi rend="italic">endeavouring</hi> to seek after truth in a free &#x26; disinterested way without allowing himself to be swayed by false opinion. I like Proctor too: He <hi rend="italic">has</hi> a spark of the Divine within him &#x26; keeps it alive amid manifold trivialties &#x26; obstructions. So far as he goes I think he is perhaps the very <hi rend="italic">truest</hi> man I ever met with, and has an almost painfully keen perception of the truth that lies within his sphere. He is kind a<supplied>[nd]</supplied> unaf<supplied>[f]</supplied>ectedly kind, as is his wife tho#x2019; she shrouds her kindness with a wondrous crust of seeming bitterness &#x26; sarcasm. &#x2026; Since I wrote last I have sent off the small paper on Digestion to Macvey Napier. I scarcely expect him to give it a place in his review; but I shall never repent having written it as it has made me familiar with the subject. By &#x26; by I shall publish something on my own account upon the same subject. One never has any freedom in writing for Reviews or Magazines. Till the end of this month I shall try to write some specimen of my projected Hist. of Medicine for Lockhart, &#x26; perhaps something also for the New Monthly where the <hi rend="italic">pay</hi> is good. &#x2026; George Irving has had to return to his brother#x2019;s, having been unable to support himself by his practice. &#x2026; Your paper on Schiller I peremptorily desired Fraser (J.) either to print without further delay or give out of his hands. I have just corrected the proofs of it for next number. The only merit of F#x2019;s Magazine by the way is that it does not attack any really worthy person but a great many presumptuous fools. It is how<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, as you say, a dirty, punchy publication. D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Maginn is very good-natured, &#x26; possesses a great deal of information of a light sort in addition to what you say of him. &#x2026; The Lord Chancellor can laugh almost as heartily as <hi rend="italic">Teufelsdreck</hi>. I was in court last friday when he asked one of the barristers: What is your client#x2019;s age? The Bar<hi rend="italic">r</hi> answered thirty six &#x26; another on the opposite side six &#x26; thirty. &#x2018;A nice distinction#x2019; said Brougham, &#x2018;nice distinction. Thank you M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Black<supplied>[.#x2019;]</supplied> The M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Black looked strange enough to provoke laughter. &#x2026; I was grieved not a little to learn last week that my friend Baron Eichthal died at Rome last summer or autumn. He was a good kind hearted man as I ever knew. &#x2026; Jeffrey I saw in the House of Lords one day pleading before Brougham. He looked pale &#x26; thin. His wife &#x26; daughter also are here.&#x201D;
<p>John also wrote on <date when="1831-02-17">17 Feb.</date>: &#x201C;&#x2026; I have just been at Buller#x2019;s &#x26; seen Arthur. Charles &#x26; he are newly returned from Boulogne where their father &#x26; mother are staying. Arthur is not looking so well as usual. He &#x26; I are to go next saturday [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] to Shooter#x2019;s Hill &#x2018;if nothing come in the way.#x2019; Charles did not vote for Wellington. He was not in the house at all but ill of Asthma &#x26; confined to his room, where indeed I saw him. I suppose he#x2019;s more radical than ever. Did I tell you that he had seen some of the members of the S<hi rend="italic">te</hi> Simonienne at Paris in <date when="1831-08-00">August last</date>, among others a nephew of Baron Eichthal#x2019;s, who had shown him your letter? They were admiring it he said, &#x26; enquiring eagerly about the author; but altogether blind to the &#x2018;hidden satire#x2019; strewed throughout the whole of it.&#x2014; There have been two or three of the members here, one of them a Pole, much bent on making converts, but, as you may suppose, they met with &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">naw encooragement</hi>.#x2019;</p> 
<p>In addition to the Mr Fontblanque [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] of whom I spoke in my last letter as being concerned in conducting the Examiner, the son Mr Mill writes a great deal in it&#x2014;A<supplied>[rthur]</supplied> Buller tells me&#x2014;&#x26; is the author of these papers &#x2018;on the spirit of the age.#x2019; He is a strange enthusiast, with many capabilities but without much constancy of purpose, &#x26; without any fixed religion to guide him. Arthur Buller says he has a taste for poetry &#x26; can cry as a child over Wordsworth#x2019;s. &#x2026; I sometimes see Henry Inglis walking about here. Is he not a very idle personage? &#x2026; In <date when="1831-03-00">March</date> I shall get pay from Fraser for your Nimmo &#x26; Schiller&#x2014;I am not in straits at present.&#x201D;</p></note> With great pleasure I will take to writing once a <pb id="pg-05-234" n="05:234"/>fortnight: I could also contrive, without any violence to rules, to make some Hon. Member save the postage occasionally; for which purpose, among others, will you <hi rend="italic">again</hi> send me C. Buller#x2019;s address: to whom had I known it, I would have sent this Letter. The address has been sent down to Scotsbrig with a large bundle of your Letters, and tho#x2019; <pb id="pg-05-235" n="05:235"/>I sent for these, they have never come up again. Franks are always welcome, especially in this low state of the financial department: however one can always cram a good shilling#x2019;s-worth into a sheet; and we should be poor indeed did not such a one as your last always triumphantly clear its way.</p>
<p>I must continue the simple annals of this colony of God#x2019;s creatures for you. The Farm of Puttoch is not yet settled: however, we hear that there are &#x201C;four offers for it all about the same&#x201D;; so that Alick has now well nigh lost hope of it. Whither he is next to turn is not so clear a question. He and I have had various deep consultations on the subject; for I have naturally advised him to turn his thoughts altogether away, for the present, from the possibility of remaining; towards which his efforts will not avail anything. For his line of policy was this: he had privately made up his mind as to the sum he could with any show of prudence engage to pay; but having fallen behind with his last rent, he could not make a formal offer; but only lay by to see if perhaps his proposal would not be as good as any other; which now from the character of the competitors he has little expectation of its being. <hi rend="italic">My</hi> feelings in the matter you may easily picture; but the business is not of them. Alick and I have treated of various schemes: nay I myself thought his intended offer (&#xa3;150) a very venturous one, and am at this moment by no means sure but the cutting of such an active little fellow loose from these Desolations, and casting him into the populous world again, will not, severe as we may feel it, be a positive blessing to him. He is down to Scotsbrig this day (I walked with him to below Sandywells); partly to look after the <hi rend="italic">Newby Mill</hi> (at Annan), and strike into a quite new course of activity, if he can get that Establishment which is now advertised, for any rent that seems plausible. I have often talked to him about the Miller life, and now he seems to clutch rather eagerly at it. Farming, as I read the <pb id="pg-05-236" n="05:236"/>times, is done, or nearly so; the rents are all some fifty <hi rend="italic">percent</hi> too high; yet the present race of Farmers <hi rend="italic">must</hi> continue: so until the agricultural capital (<hi rend="italic">tools</hi> of agricultural indistry [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>]) is all consumed (in feeding pointers and the like) and the present race of farmer#x2019;s ruined out, there is little hope of improvement. The Scotsbrig people are straitened enough too; so it is but ebb tide with us all: nevertheless we <hi rend="italic">are</hi> still a &#x201C;one and all,&#x201D; and will struggle briskly on, and encourage one another. For me Alick#x2019;s removing will be a mournful desolating sort of thing: but I really think that for himself it will be a benefit. He seemed much gratified with your kind note; which he has taken down to Scotsbrig with my three; where very probably at this hour (ten of the clock) the good souls may be busy reading them. What follows you shall hear duly. The Scotsbrigers were all well; our Father recovered, or nearly so, last Wednesday. It is not for want of Love that they do not write you; but simply that they hardly can: none but Jane ever takes pen in hand; and she at present is kept very busy.</p>
<p>As for myself, matters have brightened up in some small degree, and I am at work again. Bowring wrote by return of post a very frank warm-looking Note, wishing to have the &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">Nibelungen</hi> Article#x2019; directly:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Bowring#x2019;s letter, dated <date when="1831-02-11">11 Feb.</date>, reads in part: &#x201C;Your letter to me is very welcome,&#x2014;any thing from you is entitled to a cordial welcome,&#x2014;&#x26; I shake the friendly hand which you hold out to me.
<p>&#x201C;I shall be glad to have your paper on the <hi rend="italic">Niebelungen Lied</hi>&#x2014;a capital subject &#x26; one of which I am sure you are fully master,&#x2014;and the sooner it comes the better.&#x201D;</p></note> I have been cobbling at it for five days incessantly, and sent it down with Alick today. I rather hope that Bowring and I may get on a little: he seems a very honest man.&#x2014; I meant to send you a Letter in that parcel of his; but was quite chaced [hurried] to get it done: there is even a stock of <hi rend="italic">socks</hi> here, which your unwearied mother has sent up for you in successive pairs: these I durst not well include this time lest the whole parcel (addressed to the W<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Review Bookseller) might have been charged to <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, as to the larger sharer in it. The socks will come by and by.</p>
<p>Cochrane also sends down a much humbler Letter;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dated <date when="1831-02-11">11 Feb.</date></note> and requests to have the &#x201C;Paper on <hi rend="italic">Reineke de Fos</hi>.&#x201D; It is a poor shred of some ten pages; which he shall have. He wants me to write on <hi rend="italic">Hutten;</hi><note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-05/lt-18291221-TC-DA-01">TC to DA, <date when="1829-12-21">21 Dec. 1829</date></ref>, and <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310228-TC-JGC-01">TC to JGC, <date when="1831-02-28">28 Feb.</date></ref></note> we shall see.

I hope and pray that the worthy Editorial Gentleman may accept it: there is no such Periodical for you, if you can come on in it.</p>
<p>Till Wednesday I am busy with preparing <hi rend="italic">Reineke</hi> and various little <foreign><hi rend="italic">et-ceteras;</hi></foreign> after which I purpose seriously inclining heart and hand to the finishing of <hi rend="italic">Teuf</hi>k&#x2014;if indeed he be finishable! How could you remember Irving#x2019;s criticism so well? Tell him that it was quite like himself; he said all that was friendly, flattering and encouraging, yet with the <hi rend="italic">right</hi> faults kindly indicated: a <hi rend="italic">true</hi> picture, painted <foreign><hi rend="italic">couleur de rose</hi></foreign> [in a rosy light]. I will make the attempt! And now dear Jack, on this last fraction of the letter, a word about you. Sorry am I to see your supplies running so low; and so little outlook for bettering them. Yet what advice to give you? I have said a thousand times, when you could not believe me, that the trade of Literature was worse as a trade than that of honest Street Sweeping; that I knew not how a man without some degree of prostitution could live by it&#x2014;unless indeed he we<supplied>[re]</supplied> situated like me, and could live on potatoes-and-point if need were. As indeed need has been, is, and will be with better than me.&#x2014; If the Angels have any Humour I am sure they laughed heartily today (as I myself have repeatedly done) to see Alick setting off with Twelve pence of copper, a long roll like a pencase, the <hi rend="italic">whole</hi> disposable capital of both our households. I realized six, he six, so he was enabled to go. I was for keeping three, but he looked wistfully, and I gave him them with loud laughter. (He had borrowed all our money, and did <hi rend="italic">not</hi> get payments last Wednesday, but surely will on Monday).</p>
<p>I could also prove that a life of Scribbling is among the worst conceivable for cultivating Thought, what is noblest and the only noble thing in us: your ideas never get root, cannot be <hi rend="italic">sown</hi> but are ground down from day to day. O that I heard of any Medicine for your practicing&#x2014;were it only on the lower animals! However, Patience! Courage! the time is coming. Meanwhile by far your best outlook were with the <hi rend="italic">Ed Review</hi>, if you succeed. Of the <hi rend="italic">Med. Hist.</hi> I could speak warmly, were it not for the uncertainty of the scheme, I mean of their undertaking it.&#x2014; I can ask Jeffrey to do <hi rend="italic">anything</hi> for you that is right, and he will do it cheerfully. But I dare not promise that any Bookseller would undertake almost any translation from the German, they all say that none such has <hi rend="italic">paid</hi>. Or perhaps could you do some good in some <pb id="pg-05-238" n="05:238"/>other way or ways with Longman? Think of it, and I will without reluctance ask the Advocate to promote any fair scheme; anything that <hi rend="italic">you</hi> could ask of him. Finally, dear Jack, keep a stout heart. I think I notice in you a considerable improvement since you left us, a far more manly bearing. Never despond. If you see no feasible method, of even fairly attempting to get professional employment in London, why then I think I would leave London. Do not fall into straits, do not involve yourself in debt: come out of it; come <hi rend="italic">hither</hi>, share our provisions such as the good God gives us, our roof, our welcome; and we will consider what way you are <hi rend="italic">next</hi> to try it. Above all hide nothing from <hi rend="italic">me:</hi> I will hide it from the Scotsbr<hi rend="italic">g</hi> people whenever you bid me. <closer><salute>And so God bless you dear Brother! Fear nothing but behaving unwisely!</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I have received both your Letter and the Manuscript; of which last I have also with my first leisure carefully examined the portion you refer to.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-05-239" n="05:239"/>I find that those ten concluding pages which treat of <hi rend="italic">Reineke de Fos</hi> would indeed make a readable, perhaps rather pleasant, yet altogether trivial Paper: but they stand there as the topstone and conclusion of a considerable mass, built up not without care and effort; from which mass, tho#x2019; individually the most insignificant part of it, I am of opinion they cannot be disjoined without injury to the meaning both of what is taken and of what is left. The whole Essay on what I have called the <hi rend="italic">Didactic Era of German Literature</hi>, extending from the <foreign>Minnesingers</foreign> to the Reformation Period, and of which this <hi rend="italic">Reineke</hi> is the last figure, occupies some 47 pages, and under the title, <hi rend="italic">German Literature of the Fourteenth &#x26; Fifteenth Centuries</hi> (perhaps some better were devisable) might, by a very easy introduction, form what I reckon a rather important Article;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Published by Cochrane in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Quarterly Review</hi>, VIII (<date when="1831-10-00">Oct. 1831</date>), 347&#x2013;91, and under this title in <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XXVII, 274&#x2013;332.</note> an attempt, at least, to exhibit a very important and complex object. If you like the Paper under this last shape, it can be made ready in few hours, and shall be instantly despatched: if not, then I shall only beg you to understand with all distinctness that your refusal of it will not give any the smallest offence to me; nay perhaps my self-interest would rather incline towards such a result. Reineke by itself is decidedly <hi rend="italic">not</hi> worth sending. Be kind enough to say what your feeling is: and herewith we will push aside this <hi rend="italic">Manuscript</hi>, and have no more to do with it.</p>
<p>I had also received your former Letter, but delayed answering it in hope of hearing more: I rather incline to think that <hi rend="italic">Ulrich Hutten</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Epistolae</hi> might make a handsome Disquisition; should wish, at all events, to see that New Edition of the Book he was concerned in, and any other writings illustrative of him,&#x2014;if you can send them without inconvenience. Five volumes of an Edition of his works (by Hermann M&#xfc;nch) are already in my possession: also a short <hi rend="italic">Life</hi> by Wagenseil; and an old dusty Dutch copy of the <hi rend="italic">Epistolae</hi>, without note or comment of any kind. M&#xfc;nch had not got so far as the <hi rend="italic">Obscure men</hi> with his Publication (in <date when="1828-00-00">1828</date>, I think, but the Book is in another room);<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ulrich von Hutten, <hi rend="italic">Epistolae Obscurorum Virorum</hi> (<date when="1515-00-00">1515</date>&#x2013;<date when="1517-00-00">17</date>). Most of the first part of this work was written by Crotus Rubianus. Herman M&#xfc;nch (<date when="1798-00-00">1798</date>&#x2013;<date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>) produced an edition of his works in 5 vols. (<date when="1821-00-00">1821</date>&#x2013;<date when="1825-00-00">25</date>), the first volume published in Berlin, the other four in Leipzig. Christian Jakob Wagenseil (<date when="1756-00-00">1756</date>&#x2013;<date when="1839-00-00">1839</date>) published <hi rend="italic">Ulrich von Hutten nach seinem Leben, seinem Charakter und seinen Schriften geschildert</hi> (N&#xfc;rnberg, <date when="1823-00-00">1823</date>). Sir William Hamilton reviewed M&#xfc;nch#x2019;s edition of the <hi rend="italic">Epistolae</hi> in the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review</hi>, LIII (<date when="1831-03-00">March 1831</date>), 180&#x2013;210.</note> neither was his promised <hi rend="italic">Biography</hi> forthcoming; <pb id="pg-05-240" n="05:240"/>both of which, if he has in the mean time overtaken them, I should be very glad to look at.</p>
<p>Your last Number I have gone thro#x2019;; and find it all very polished, gentlemanly and correct: but could wish much that your Divers would go deeper down, the rich pearls lie lower. Permit me this criticism, which originates in a true concern for the cause you manage and strive after.</p>
<p>Before concluding, too, I will send you a little piece of News, for your next Bulletin. Herr Kaufmann favourably known by some considerable versions from Shakspeare, is at this time engaged, at Berlin, in translating <hi rend="italic">Burns!</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For Herr Kaufmann see <ref target="volume-05/lt-18301023-TC-G-01">TC to G, <date when="1830-10-23">23 Oct. 1830</date></ref>. The information was duly noted in the <date when="1831-04-00">April</date> number#x2019;s literary notices, vol. VII, 550.</note> He proceeds under the eye of the Berlin <hi rend="italic">Gesellschaft f&#xfc;r ausl&#xE4;ndische Litteratur</hi> [Society for Foreign Literature] of which he is a member. This you may depend on as authentic enough. Goethe writes to one of his friends: <foreign><hi rend="italic">Ein talentvoller junger Mann und gl&#xfc;cklicher Uebersetzer besch&#xE4;ftigt sich jetzt mit</hi> <hi rend="small-caps">Burns</hi>; <hi rend="italic">ich bin sehr darauf gelegen</hi></foreign>.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Goethe#x2019;s letter of <date when="1830-10-05">5 Oct.</date> to Carlyle himself in Norton, <hi rend="italic">GC:</hi> &#x201C;A young man of much talent, and successful as a translator, is busy with Burns.

<salute>My Dear Jack,</salute>
<p>This is my last long sheet of paper; and I employ it and part of this rainy Saturday in giving you some of our tidings. It is but a week truly, and not a fortnight since I wrote last: however, I have various little matters to tell you which may be interesting; and as for my <hi rend="italic">type</hi>, I beg you to look at it and take example by it.</p>
<p>I said in the Newspaper of yesterday <foreign><hi rend="italic">Mit Alick noch nichts entschieden</hi></foreign> [nothing yet decided with Alick]; which is true but not the whole truth. It did become decided last week that he was <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to <pb id="pg-05-241" n="05:241"/>remain here: the place is let (for &#xa3;170) t<hi rend="italic">o</hi> some repeatedly-bankrupt Drover of these parts; and the brave Polewarth marches,&#x2014;let us hope, to a more genial region. I could growl deep enough over all this, and how the toil and tumult of years goes for nothing; but is not the principle <foreign><hi rend="italic">Sic vos non vobis</hi></foreign><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Thus you&#x201D; work but &#x201C;not for yourselves,&#x201D; anciently attributed to Vergil. Cf. Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi>, p. 235.</note> universal in the life of men, and of the deeper application the better they are? What a brave heart has to do in this case is not whining and repining but looking round for some fresh arena. Alick accordingly has ridden a second time into Annandale since I wrote; and given in his largest offer (&#xa3;156) for the Annan Mill. He was down there on Thursday, with all manner of accompaniments and apparatus for judging; a Miller who had worked the Mill, Robert Brown who had built it and was to build a new Caul <supplied>[Weir]</supplied><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A damhead or weir to divert water from the stream to the mill.</note> for it, Jamie, Robert Clow, &#x26;c: he had also a warm recommendation from me to Ben Nelson, who has something to do with it, and treated him, as we have since heard, with all possible kindness. It was expected that the business would be settled on Thursday; so here yesterday we sat panting and trembling (Jane was almost out of her wits!) watching till the Adventurer would return with his Yes or No. Jane met him about nine o#x2019;clock at Stumpy; and he, after inquiring <hi rend="italic">what</hi> in Heaven#x2019;s name was gone wrong, answered that it was not to be decided till Wednesday; the Proprietor (the Burnfoot Irving in London<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Burnfoot is an estate near Ecclefechan; the owner was John Irving, a London merchant. See <ref target="volume-06/lt-18320831-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1832-08-31">31 Aug. 1832</date></ref>.</note>) needing first to be consulted, whose answer could not arrive till the day before that. It seems to me not improbable that we may still have to wait in suspense till the <hi rend="italic">second</hi> Wednesday: however, you may depend on hearing the instant anything is done. Little things are great to little men, to little man;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18210716-TC-JBW-01"><sic>1:368</sic><corr>TC to JBW, <date when="1821-07-16">16 July 1821</date></corr></ref>.</note> for what was the Moscow expedition to Napoleon, but the offering also for a new and larger Farm, whereon to till; and this too was but a mere clout of a Farm, compared with the great Farm whose name is <hi rend="small-caps">Time</hi>,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle echoes Goethe#x2019;s &#x201C;Time is my seed-field&#x201D; (see <ref target="volume-05/lt-18301219-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1830-12-19">19 Dec. 1830</date></ref>).</note> or the quiet boundless Freehold which is called <hi rend="small-caps">Eternity</hi>. Let us feel our bits of anxieties, therefore, and make our bits of efforts, and think no shame of them. I am distinctly of opinion that if Alick can get this place, it will be far the best situation, morally and economically, he has ever been in: nay such a thing is almost the only <hi rend="italic">steady</hi> agricultural concern <pb id="pg-05-242" n="05:242"/>remaining in these days, the only one wherein your own faculty and industry will avail you. Besides the neighbourhood, such as it is, seems to be the <hi rend="italic">best</hi>, in all points of view, that Scotland offers our Brother. He and I had another scheme, about his <hi rend="italic">malting</hi> and even <hi rend="italic">Brewing</hi> in Ecclefechan: but <hi rend="italic">this</hi> we agreed was greatly preferable. Something I have no doubt, at the worst, we shall contrive: neither do I altogether regret the four struggling years Alick has spent here; he has learnt much, and leaves the place a better man, whether a richer or not, than he came. I add only that Robert Clow, one of the worthiest persons of his sort now alive, has decided on coming to live with him, be it here or there: the creature called the &#x2018;<foreign>Laird</foreign>#x2019; it seems is not to be lived with; and poor Rob will work for Alick at <hi rend="italic">any</hi>thing, and so live with some mortal that will look kindly on him. Poor Rob! His little edifice too has crumbled into ashes, and his simple heart was wounded to the quick, like ours, when that grave opened!<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A reference to the death of Carlyle#x2019;s sister Margaret, whom Robert Clow was to have married.</note> But we will turn the leaf.</p>
<p>From Scotsbrig we learn that they are all pretty well: they seem to make some movement towards writing to you; I sent them (by request) your address yesterday. Mary who still lodges there with her husband, but is soon, they say, to remove into the &#x2018;Kiln,#x2019; has got a Daughter the other day, and is recovering well. Her man is much esteemed in his ploughing vocation, and is to live there, for the present, in the character of <hi rend="italic">&#x2018;hind,#x2019;</hi> which probably is the fittest for him.&#x2014; Farther, I heard last night that our worthy Uncle John<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Aitken, whose wife had died the year before. His new wife evidently lived in Friar#x2019;s Vennel, Dumfries.</note> of Dumfries is to be married again forthwith to a widow &#x2018;in the vennal#x2019; [alley or narrow lane], a woman of good character, with children and a considerable Grocery establishment.&#x2014; <hi rend="italic"><foreign>Quod bonum faustum sit!</foreign></hi><note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18151211-TC-RM-01"><sic>1:67</sic><corr>TC to RM, <date when="1815-12-11">11 Dec. 1815</date></corr></ref>.</note> The good man I daresay has been driven into this, in great part, by the Mother of Invention.<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-05/lt-18300211-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1830-02-11">11 Feb. 1830</date></ref>.</note> But he is practically a philosopher, and the best-natured man with such energy and intellect that I have almost ever met with.</p>
<p>As for ourselves, in the middle of all these fluctuations, we sit still and keep an outlook on the firm headlands, praying too for an occasional glimpse of the eternal Stars. After whitsunday we shall find ourselves here literally <foreign><hi rend="italic">unter vier Augen</hi></foreign> [under four eyes, i.e., private], alone among the whinstone desarts; within fifteen miles not one <pb id="pg-05-243" n="05:243"/>creature that we can so much as speak to; for the Stroquhan people too are all wrecked (commercially), and are to remove to Moffat. With the &#x2018;incoming Tenant,#x2019;<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Joseph M#x2019;Adam, of Craigenputtoch, succeeding Alexander Carlyle.</note> who poor fellow is but another of the great Sect of Drudges, for whose fate I mourn daily, we expect to have few difficulties: our servant is an excellent creature; our premises are all railed in and distinct; there will be nothing to do as I said to Jane, but clap a lock on every door, and buy a pair of pistols. The poor man, it is probable, will be very ready to oblige us, for hire. I once thought of re-engaging Elliott, and trying that <hi rend="italic">Burble</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Barbouiller</hi>) again; but have fallen upon a far grander scheme. Listen, Jack; for what I have got to say will not fail to interest you. Thro#x2019; the Summer it is quite easy living here as we are; and against winter, I purpose, having saved every penny that can be earned, coming along, with my wifekin under my arm, to&#x2014;London! Yes, I compute that before the long days are done, I shall have realised two things: finished my prodigal son <hi rend="italic">Teufelsdreck</hi>, and got Fifty pounds into my pocket. With this sum, under the guidance of Heaven, we will visit the great Beehive and Waspnest, and (till it run done) see what is to be seen. Do thou, O Doil, take serious thought in the interim how any independent lodgement may be effected with that mite of cash, in what way such mite may be spun out farthest. Thou knowest me and my ways. I have decided on living on mine own bottom (<foreign><hi rend="italic">Grund und Boden</hi></foreign> [property]) for I can be a guest, beyond two days or so, with no mortal known to me, without mutual grief. Therefore, I say, let us try. I will do my best; and surely we shall have space to find a Publisher for Devilsdreck, and look round also, spying all outlooks whether there is absolutely Nothing in God#x2019;s creation that will unite with me, in the way of work and well-doing. Nay, I have half a mind (but this in deepest secrecy) to start when I come there, if the ground promise well, and deliver a Dozen of Lectures, in my own Annandale accent, with my own God-created brain and heart, to such audience as will gather round me, on some section or aspect of this strange Life in this strange Era; on which my soul like Eliphaz the Temanite#x2019;s is getting fuller and fuller.<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Eliphaz to Job, Job 4:2: &#x201C;If we assay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieved? but who can withhold himself from speaking?&#x201D; The next verse reads: &#x201C;Behold, thou hast instructed many, and thou hast strengthened the weak hands.&#x201D; Cf. the many references to Job in <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi>.</note> Does there seem to there any propriety in a man that has organs of speech and even some semblance of understanding and Sincerity, sitting forever, m<supplied>[u]</supplied>te as milestone, while Quacks of <pb id="pg-05-244" n="05:244"/>every colour are quacking as with lungs of brass? True I have no Pulpit: but as I once said, cannot any man <hi rend="italic">make</hi> him a pulpit, simply by inverting the nearest Tub? And what are your whigs and Lord Advocates, and Lord Chancellors, and the whole host of unspeakably gabbling Parliamenteers and Pulpiteers and Pamphleteers; &#x2014;if a man suspect that &#x2018;there is fire enough in his belly to burn up#x2019; the entire creation of such!<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Like Ram-Dass. See <ref target="volume-02/lt-18231102-TC-AC-01"><sic>2:464</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1823-11-02">2 Nov. 1823</date></corr></ref>.</note> These all build on Mechanism: one spark of Dynamism; of Inspiration, were it in the poorest soul, is stronger than they all. As for the whig Ministry, with whom Jeffrey might appear to connect me, I partly see two things: first that they will have nothing in any shape to do with me, did I show them the virtue of a Paul, nay the more virtue the less chance, for virtue is Freewill to choose the Good, not Tool-usefulness to forge at the Expedient: secondly that they, the Whigs, except perhaps Brougham and his Implements, will not endure; the latter indeed I should wonder little to see one day a second Cromwell: he is the cunningest and the strongest man now in England, as I construe him, and with no better principle than a Napoleon has: a feeling of virtue, a worship and self-devotion to Power. God be thanked that I had nothing to do with his University and its Committees!<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle had seriously contemplated formally applying for a professorship at the new University of London in <date when="1827-00-00">1827</date>, but Brougham was evasive and Carlyle eventually gave up hopes of obtaining a chair.</note>&#x2014; So that Providence seems saying to me: Thou wilt never find Pulpit, were it but a Rhetoric chair, provided for thee: invert thy Tub, and speak, if thou have aught to say!<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >As Carlyle was to do through Diogenes Teufelsdr&#xF6;ckh in <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi>. See especially Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi>, pp. 86, 212.</note>&#x2014; Keep all this inviolably secret, dear Jack: and know in the meanwhile so much, that if I can raise fifty pounds, at the right season, to London I will certainly come.</p>
<p>Thus I see a busy summer before me, and therefore no unhappy one. Teufelsdreck I <foreign><hi rend="italic">hege und pflege</hi></foreign> [nurture], night and day; and hope also to put forth an &#x2018;Article#x2019; or two before then. <hi rend="italic">Teuf</hi>k is not the <hi rend="italic">right</hi> thing yet, but there is a kind of life in it, and I <hi rend="italic">will</hi> finish it.&#x2014; Bowring will perhaps write on Wednesday:<note n="15" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Bowring wrote on <date when="1831-03-04">4 March</date> to say that he was sending Carlyle#x2019;s article on the <hi rend="italic">Nibelungenlied</hi> to press.</note> I expect some good of him, he is at least <hi rend="italic">in earnest</hi>. The slut Cochrane I reckon to be a blockheaded Editor with whom it is not good, if you can help it, to have aught to do. Nevertheless if you signify, in polished term, that you well nigh despise him, he will work under you: he is, was and will be a Bookseller#x2019;s Clerk, and no Editor. I have written him that I <pb id="pg-05-245" n="05:245"/>would <hi rend="italic">not</hi> send <hi rend="italic">Reinecke Fuchs</hi> (from that Ms.); but the whole Essay of which it forms a part (the worst but concluding and most essential part) was at his service if he liked; if not, not. I rather <hi rend="italic">wish</hi> him to decline.&#x2014;More on the Margins. <closer><salute>For this time <foreign><hi rend="italic">A Dios!</hi></foreign> Your Brother&#x2014;&#x2014;</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name></p>
<ps><p>By way of enabling me to finish off that proposed Article for Cochrane (or let me rather trust, for some one else who could understand it better) will you look in some German Catalogue, or in Black#x2019;s shop, for the newest work on <hi rend="italic">Reineke de Fos</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Reineke Fuchs,</hi><note n="16" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The most recent edition, as John explained in his reply of <date when="1831-03-10">10 March</date>, was by D.

<p>Is not Bul<supplied>[l]</supplied>er#x2019;s address: Clarges-street Piccadilly? I made Alick bring me up a whole sheaf of your Letters from Scotsbrig; but could not find it in these. I sent off a Note (for Mrs Strachey, <foreign><hi rend="italic">eigentlich</hi></foreign> [actually] for Greaves) to that address on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Jane thanks you for your little Note; and says she will answer it one day by a long list of practical inquiries on housekeeping&#x2014;on a subject which she knows will deeply interest you. Meanwhile her kindest wishes.</p>
<p>Any tidings from Napier yet? Fear not; bear up till winter, and then we consult <foreign><hi rend="italic">viva voce.</hi></foreign></p>
<p>Jeffrey I suppose has never asked after you. <foreign>N#x2019;importe, n#x2019;importe</foreign> [no matter, no matter].</p>

<salute>My Dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Jane would explain to you last week how I fully purposed to write, and could not get it accomplished. She says, her Letter was excessively hurried, owing to Alick#x2019;s having failed in his appointment to meet her at Shaw#x2019;s: she expected that <hi rend="italic">he</hi> also would have sent you some news; however, it appears he did not. I now scrawl a few lines to say how matters stand.</p>
<p>With regard to Alick, you will have learned already that he is to lose his establishment <hi rend="italic">here</hi>, the whole matter having been settled without advice of ours being asked: and as for the Annan Mill, there could be nothing learned about it last Wednesday, and we only expect that it will be decided tomorrow. I leave this Letter unsealed that Alick may tell you himself (at Dumfries) how it goes. We hope and pray earnestly here that he may get it; in which case I shall calculate that for <hi rend="italic">him</hi> his leaving these Dunscore moors may prove a real blessing. He himself seems not to be so very anxious, and has also good hope.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-05-247" n="05:247"/>Thus you see, My Dear Mother, our little colony here is to be scattered asunder; it has again been decreed that we are not to live longer together. With the <hi rend="italic">way</hi> in which this has been managed I cannot profess myself much charmed: however, in itself perhaps the arrangement may turn out for the good of all parties. Alick at least, I am convinced, will be far happier somewhere in his own district than he has ever been here: I reckon that in this Mill he were likely every way to do well; but indeed almost anywhere a situation equal to that of a Moorland Grazier may be met with, for in this, as matters go, there is hardly any prospering, unless you either have great capital, or little honesty, and can without reluctance become bankrupt.&#x2014; As for my little Wife and me, who are to be left alone here, we shall do the best we may; and care not tho#x2019; Craigenputtoch were washed away into the sea-bottom; from which I think it is little matter if it had never risen. Of our new Neighbour we know nothing or next to nothing; and mean only to rail up all <hi rend="italic">Marches</hi> betwixt us, clap a lock on each door; and so let every tub stand separate on its own bottom. Nay, it often strikes us as if we should not be very long here; as if in fact, I <hi rend="italic">ought</hi> not to lie so buried in these times. We shall be on the outlook, and do if possible what is best and wisest.&#x2014; I am very happy to think that Alick leaves this place without blot or fault, and as I think, a <hi rend="italic">better</hi> man than he came. Both he and I have had various things to try us, and might easily have made a <foreign><hi rend="italic">burble</hi></foreign> [tangle] of it, but have not done so.</p>
<p>Meanwhile you will rejoice to learn, my dear Mother, that I am actually working with all diligence at that same <hi rend="italic">Book</hi> I have talked so long about! Ask no account of it, for it is indescribable: however, I think it may <hi rend="italic">do</hi>, and be not altogether unworthy of doing. I mean to finish it, and much more, if strength be lent me, this summer; and try London with it in the beginning of Winter. The thing I was sending with Alick (last time he saw you) was a long Paper on some German business for a new Review (I mean new to me) in London; the Editor whom I reckon a worthy man, writes me that it is to be printed; and signifies plainly enough that he &#x2018;desires my <hi rend="italic">acqwantance</hi>#x2019; [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>]. For money matters, therefore, I shall be partly at rest for some time. I have a busy summer before me, and no unhappy one: the iron is on the stithy and hot, if I can only hammer it.</p>
<p>From Jack we expected to hear last Saturday but did not, most probably the letter is lying at Dumfries.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John wrote to him on <date when="1831-03-10">10</date> and <date when="1831-03-14">14 March</date>.</note> I see by the Newspaper Advertisement <pb id="pg-05-248" n="05:248"/>that the Magazine people have printed all my stuff; so that he will be in no immediate want of money. I told him that, if possible, I would see him in the beginning of winter: we shall then thoroughly understand what his outlook is. Has Jean written to him yet? I told him I had sent [the rest of the letter has been lost].</p>

<salute>My Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Many thanks for your two Letters, and the candid sensible and feasible picture they give us of your affairs, which tho#x2019; not of the brightest quality, are farther than ever as I think from desperate.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Part of John#x2019;s letter of <date when="1831-03-10">10 March</date> follows: &#x201C;Your second long letter reached me yesterday &#x26;, I need not say, was extremely welcome. It relieved me not a little to learn that you are now in a fair way for overcoming the petty difficulties which have lately given you so much annoyance. I cannot help looking upon myself as in some measure the author of these difficulties, &#x26; feeling a painful uneasiness whenever I think of them. You will understand from this what a weight the intelligence took off my mind. &#x2026; I have long thought it would be good for you to get into the world again as soon as possible, and I have no doubt but you will find your place in it &#x26; men to join &#x26; sympathize with you. With regard to delivering lectures here, I can only say that the more I see of London the more convinced I am that every man of talent who has anything to say is sure of finding people to listen to him whatever dialect he may speak in. &#x2026; I have got very little done since I wrote last. This History of Medicine I find will not do. &#x2026; I can perceive no resource left for me at present except trying to get up something to suit the New Monthly Mag<hi rend="italic">e</hi>&#x2014;Proctor introducing me to the new Editor&#x2014;a certain Mr <supplied>[Samuel Carter]</supplied> Hall who &#x2018;does not take the same liberties with the contributions of correspondents as the late Editor#x2019; <supplied>[Thomas Campbell]</supplied>. The said Magaz<hi rend="italic">e</hi> is a very useless, washy affair, but their pay is double that of Fraser &#x26; one need not write any thing for them to be ashamed of. &#x2026; As to practice in the way of my profession, I think there is no probability of my getting any soon. Ultimate success would be certain, if I had the means of persevering in waiting for it, &#x26; I think the way for securing it is evident enough before me. I see the cunning, sneaking, underhand ways of the medical men I have met with here, &#x26; despise it perhaps too vehemently. Your epithet of &#x2018;Satan#x2019;s Invisible World<supplied>[#x2019;]</supplied> is not less applicable to the medical profession than to authorcraft, perhaps even more applicable. &#x2026; I called on Jeffrey last thursday (or rather wednesday week<supplied>[.]</supplied>) I saw both him and Mrs J. &#x26; was received kindly. &#x2026; It was half on business that I called&#x2014;about some money w<hi rend="italic">h</hi> he had given me for Hazlitt &#x26;c.&#x201D;
<p>In his letter of <date when="1831-03-14">14 March</date> John wrote: &#x201C;When I called on C. Buller this morning for the purpose of procuring Eichthal#x2019;s address&#x2014;who by the way has left town&#x2014;he offered me a frank which I thought there could be no harm in accepting tho#x2019; I have almost nothing new to tell you, having written so largely only last thursday. Buller had received your letter to Mrs Strachey &#x26; said he would write you today himself. He looks well tho delicate, being very liable to attacks of a sort of Asthma, which even already has gone so far as to give him something of the appearance about the shoulders &#x26; head which is peculiar to such as are labouring under that disease. You know what annoyance it would give him even to hint at such a deformity. &#x2026; Fraser has at length printed my &#x2018;Alkemy.#x2019; I have no word from Napier &#x26; do scarcely expect any. The Blacks have given me books for my Animal Magnetism Article&#x2014;which are better than nothing. &#x2026; I am very willing to work at almost any thing, &#x26; it is hard if I can find nothing. Sometimes I think of the army which Montagu or perhaps Jeffrey might help me to get a place in some of the regiments of Guards &#x26;c. which always remain in this country. &#x2026; The only thing I feel any way nervous about, is the debt I owe Badams. &#x2026; Fraser has paid me for your last two articles so that I am now something in your debt. Did you get the Evening Mail containing Jeffreys maiden speech? It was very characteristic, tho#x2019; somewhat altered &#x26; distorted in the Times.&#x201D;</p></note></p>
<p><pb id="pg-05-249" n="05:249"/>I received your Letters, along with a short one from Buller; his Reform Pamphlet,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Buller#x2019;s letter, written on <date when="1831-03-14">14? March</date>. With it he sent Carlyle his pamphlet, <hi rend="italic">On the Necessity of a Radical Reform</hi> (London, <date when="1831-00-00">1831</date>), saying that it was the first &#x201C;ever issued from the press bearing the name of the illustrious Buller. &#x2026; Great days are these for those who have long in sorrow &#x26; almost in solitude held firm the true Radical faith: and great even for those who like myself have embraced that faith just in time to share in its triumph. The Bill is certainly a most capital measure &#x2026; &#x26; it is pretty certain that it will be carried. There is no doubt a majority in this House that w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> vote against it if they durst: but the members representing large constituencies will after the declaration of the country in its favour either vote for it or keep away. You have not seen yet in the papers my illustrious speech on the subject, because as yet it is not spoken. It is a lamp under a bushel, but it will soon blaze forth &#x26; fill the world with light.&#x201D;</note> four Letters from Jeffrey (containing the printed Copy of his Speech),<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jeffrey#x2019;s speech in the House of Commons on <date when="1831-03-01">1 March</date>, highly praised and published at the request of the Government, was published as the <hi rend="italic">Corrected Report of the Speech of the Right Honourable the Lord Advocate of Scotland, under the Motion of Lord John Russell in the House of Commons, on the <date when="1831-03-01">First of March 1831</date> for Reform of Parliament</hi> (London, <date when="1831-00-00">1831</date>). See Cockburn, <hi rend="italic">Lifeof Lord Jeffrey</hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1852-00-00">1852</date>), I, 313&#x2013;14.</note> one from Henry Inglis (who, as you remark, seems to be growing a rather idle person, a mere Talker), two Newspapers, and the Proof sheets or rather slips of the <hi rend="italic">Nibelungen</hi>. So that I have been busy enough since then. I sat till 1 o#x2019;clock this morning correcting these <hi rend="italic">Proofs</hi>, with intent to carry them down to Dumfries today, along with a short Letter to you; which last, now at seven o#x2019;clock (having <hi rend="italic">nerves</hi>, at present, and little talent for sleep&#x2014;owing to <hi rend="italic">Teufelsdreck</hi> partly) I am now in great haste writing.</p>
<p>Alick was to have brought up all these multifarious concerns on Wednesday, when he went down to see about his <hi rend="italic">Mill:</hi> we sat watching for him till midnight, not without reproaches: but poor fellow, it turned, out next morning, that there were no tidings of the Mill to <pb id="pg-05-250" n="05:250"/>be had in Dumfries; where, however, he met with Brother Jamie, who told him he &#x2018;had heard#x2019; that the thing was to be settled at Annan next day (yesterday); whereupon he set off thitherward, &#x2018;to see the end of it#x2019;; sending up his packages with this intelligence by some private hand. We pray anxiously that he may have succeeded, at all events that the matter may have been settled. It is possible he may be here today, and that I may meet him at Dumfries: in which case (if <hi rend="italic">there be any sure event</hi>) I will try to throw you another word.&#x2014; I am well convinced that his leaving this ungainly spot of clay, or bog, will prove go almost where he will a blessing.</p>
<p>As for myself I am writing <hi rend="italic">Teufel</hi>k, after considerable meditation, and have even the First &#x26; Second Chapters down <hi rend="italic">perfect</hi>, and think it will make a kind of <foreign><hi rend="italic">Werk</hi></foreign> [book]! So no more of me.</p>
<p>With regard to yourself, dear Jack, I had much to say, were there room; many applauses to give you for your manful battle, and encouragements to persevere manfully. I see your scribbling situation, and how perverse almost hopeless it is: neither indeed can I greatly lament that it has so proved; you had always some such whim in you, and to follow it out farther would but have been to lose more time. I reckon, my dear Brother, that you have thrown off various follies, and are fast acquiring a new and far deeper sort of wisdom. Thank God for it, there is no other sort of good in this world! Your attitude seems to me manful, your outlook and efforts the most judicious you could adopt. Subsistence with the exercise of the noble Art you have acquired: such is your aim; in which, by persisting in it, you must and and [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] will prosper. As for your plan of an assistant surgeonship in some regiment, I may say freely that if such a thing be come-at-able, it ought to be taken. You are also quite right about <hi rend="italic">ploughing</hi> rather than taking to a mere messroom life.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John had said in his letter of <date when="1831-03-14">14 March</date>: &#x201C;I would about as soon turn to the plough again, as be carried about from one country to another with a regiment &#x26; gain nothing of it but habits of idleness &#x26; scarcely the means of existence.&#x201D;</note> Consider earnestly, inquire on all hands about the <hi rend="italic">means</hi> of getting into some such desirable situation, whether in the Army or elsewhere, make up your project into a plan; and I will cheerfully call upon the Advocate to help you; and I mistake much if he will not be ready to do all for you that we could ask him. He shows a quite special promptitude and even gladness in doing anything of that kind for me.</p>
<p>Neither would I have you quit Literature, which is with you another name for Wisdom, for Art, almost for Religion. Hold fast your <pb id="pg-05-251" n="05:251"/>talent that way as the most precious of your possessions: but understand ever henceforth that &#x2018;Periodical writing#x2019; is the death even of this. It strikes me, as I have often said, that there is a deeper quality in you, both intellectual and moral, than has yet quite disclosed itself; that you may write usefully and well: but not in <hi rend="italic">this</hi> way. Let your mind grow to clearness, your ideas take root and grow till the<supplied>[y]</supplied> fill your whole soul: in the meanwhile, <hi rend="italic">stand</hi> on the basis of your Art, which next to moral Teaching and Healing, with which it has indeed no small connexion, is simply the most like a divine Art of any that man can exercise. Let quacks continue to quack; <foreign><hi rend="italic">warum nicht</hi></foreign> [why not]: and do you in preference take Honesty with bread and water, or even without it. God, as you say, will <hi rend="italic">not</hi> leave those that have Faith in him: we may not have Pleasure, we do not need it, but Good we shall not fail to have.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A teaching closely related to the doctrine of Blessedness in preference to Happiness in <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi>. The &#x201C;Honesty with bread and water&#x201D; perhaps recalls <hi rend="italic">Don Quixote</hi>, Part I, chap. 11.

Struggle toughly while life is in you: it is a good cause; the very struggle if wise is success.</p>
<p>I farther quite agree in your kicking that fairy-tale<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John had labeled it as such.</note> Medical History to the Devil. If you do know or get to know anything of Medical History, you will publish it by and by in quite other environment, on quite other footing. Try that New Monthly; it is an honest shift: but neither if this fail, lose heart. Above all, turn and study that project of getting a <hi rend="italic">fixed medical place</hi>, were it the lowest, in honesty. I would cure men on <hi rend="italic">any</hi> terms, if I had the art of curing; nay, rather than let such a faculty sleep in me, I would cure beasts.</p>
<p>You are right too in making departure from London one of your last shifts. But finally, dear Jack, know that it <hi rend="italic">is</hi> a resource: and so, when your last five-pounds is broken in upon, turn your face hitherward, to a Brother#x2019;s house and heart, who would rather see you true and wise than chancellor and emperor.&#x2014; Also do not let it get into your wise head that <hi rend="italic">you</hi> cause in any the smallest measure our present &#x2018;difficulties#x2019;&#x2014;about which, when rightly busy, I hardly care sixpence. We cannot in the least understand how <hi rend="italic">you</hi> are guilty.

<salute>My Dear Jack,</salute>
<p>I hope you got the Letter I despatched on Friday gone a week, by Bowring#x2019;s parcel of proof-sheets to &#x2018;R. Heward, 2. Wellington-street, Strand#x2019;: it was a short hurried Letter, but would assure you of our continued affection, and welfare. I am now, being at home from Church, as alas my wont is, about to scrawl you somewhat thro#x2019; Buller; as time may fail me afterwards: to Alick likewise I have sent down a sheet, having previously extorted a kind of promise that he would write: you will therefore get what is to be had. We pretty confidently expect to hear from you on Wednesday: if not, linger as little afterwards as possible.</p>
<p>On the outside of <supplied>[my]</supplied> last Letter you would see the words <foreign><hi rend="italic">Mit der M&#xfc;hle noch nichts</hi></foreign> [nothing yet about the mill]: I met Alick in one of the lanes of Dumfries, and learned that such was actually the state of matters; that nevertheless he had good hopes of succeeding, and the thing was to be decided at Annan next Thursday. Well what has been the issue? <foreign><hi rend="italic">Noch Nichts</hi></foreign> [nothing yet]! Alick had proceeded as far as Dumfries on his way to the <foreign><hi rend="italic">tryste</hi></foreign> [appointed meeting], and was in the act of mounting Larry to proceed farther, when a Note from Stewart was put into his hand, apologizing &#x26;c in very civil terms, and finally appointing Monday (Tomorrow) at eleven o#x2019;clock for the settlement. <pb id="pg-05-253" n="05:253"/>Alick accordingly sets out tomorrow morning an hour before the sun, takes these letters down with him, and sees the end of it. We have all a considerable hope for him. I have settled also that he may let you know the issue: namely, if he <hi rend="italic">get</hi> the place, he is to scratch a cross (+) on the cover of your Courier Newspaper: if you see no such hieroglyph accordingly, you will infer either that he has <hi rend="italic">not</hi> succeeded, or which also will be possible that he has forgotten to announce his success. I think the place will have a chance to suit him better than any he has yet had: farther, as above said, that there seems a distinct pro<supplied>[ba]</supplied>bility of his getting it. The Newspaper will show.&#x2014; Here too I may mention that on inquiring after your lost Courier, I got this history of it: it was given to Alick#x2019;s Herdsboy, setting out for Scotsbrig to bring up Lambs; he, omitting the Dumfries Postoffice, carried it on to his journey#x2019;s end, where Jean, contrary to reason and the vote of some others, decided that it was not worth forwarding. We have hitherto never lost anything; which considering all, is surprising enough. If you write at any time for our <hi rend="italic">Saturday</hi>, it will come more certainly if you put <hi rend="italic">speed</hi> on the back: the Postmaster would then go out and <hi rend="italic">seek</hi> the Carrier, who sometimes forgets to call of himself.</p>
<p>Concerning my own movements of later days, there is little new to be said. Teufelsdreck advances, slowly yet sure; sometimes I am in hope that it will really do; at all times, determined that it shall be finished. The Dumfries Journey and prior excitement (of sleeplessness) left me quite <hi rend="italic">done;</hi> so that for two whole days there was pause: nevertheless Chapter 4<hi rend="italic">th</hi> is about concluded. Much must be added; something omitted: were I once rightly on fire, I should defy all things.</p>
 <p>From Scotsbrig the tidings are favourable: that they are all in common health, and fighting their battle as of old. With the rest of the World we have little correspondence here; except indeed from Templand, where little new transpires: old age sinking into melancholy dotage; affection, marred by sickness nervous irritability and what not, courageously striving to support it. John Welsh of Liverpool, you will be sorry to learn, is threatened with loss of eyesight. I fear the Doctors reckon it <hi rend="italic">amaurosis:</hi> he was at Glasgow, and, by advice, heroically gave up not only his drink but his tobacco, with all <foreign><hi rend="italic">etceteras;</hi></foreign> in spite of which, during the last five months, he seems to be growing worse. He has lately been at Hodgson of Birmingham;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Joseph Hodgson (<date when="1788-00-00">1788</date>&#x2013;<date when="1869-00-00">1869</date>), surgeon at the Birmingham Eye Infirmary of which he was one of the chief founders. See <ref target="volume-05/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/13444"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>. &#x201C;Amaurosis&#x201D; is a disease of the optic nerve.</note> and talks sometimes <pb id="pg-05-254" n="05:254"/>of going to London: we are all heartily sorry for him; for, tho#x2019; a rude son of Nature, he has energy, heart and integrity, such as all have not.&#x2014; Dickson of Annan,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18171120-TC-JJ-01"><sic>1:117</sic><corr>TC to JJ, <date when="1817-11-20">20 Nov. 1817</date></corr></ref> and <ref target="volume-02/lt-18230524-TC-AC-01"><sic>2:360</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1823-05-24">24 May 1823</date></corr></ref>.</note> I am afraid, is still no better in that particular: last time I was in Annan, some ten months ago, I saw him from the <hi rend="italic">Buck</hi> windows, evidently <hi rend="italic">groping</hi> his way up the street. John Welsh may have a better chance; for if he determined on cutting off his right hand, he would do it.</p>
<p>As for yourself, dear Jack, I know yet too little of your actual outlook to throw any new light on the signs of it. My best wishes, prayers, and sure hopes are nearly all I can send you. Of my affection, and help to my utmost ability you are already certain. Know always that when hard comes to hard there is a tight-roofed house for you at Craigenputtoch, where food and fuel have never failed, and would be shared, as fits between Brothers, to the uttermost clod and crumb. Nevertheless &#x2018;we hope better things tho#x2019; we thus speak.#x2019;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-04/lt-18260513-TC-JBW-01"><sic>4:94</sic><corr>TC to JBW, <date when="1826-05-13">13 May 1826</date></corr></ref>.</note> Nay, here or there or <hi rend="italic">any</hi>where, if understanding do not leave us, which with many it is apt to do, the whole Future may be defied.</p>
<p>I am still clear for your straining every sinew simply <hi rend="italic">to get Medical employment</hi>, whether as assistant Surgeon, or in <hi rend="italic">any</hi> other honest capacity. Without any doubt, as the world now stands, your safety lies there. Neither are you so destitute of friends and influence that, on any given reasonable plan, a considerable force of help could not be brought to bear. There are several, of weight, that would on more than one ground rejoice to do their best for you. Your world of London lies too dim before me for specification in this matter: towards this, however all your Endeavour ought doubtless to be directed. Think and scheme and inquire, or rather continue to do so: once foiled is nothing like final defeat: so long as Life is in a man, there is Strength in him: <foreign><hi rend="italic">Ein anderes Mal wollen wir uns</hi><supplied>[<hi rend="italic">e</hi>]</supplied><hi rend="italic">re Sache besser machen</hi></foreign> [another time we shall make our cause more successful, i.e., do better],<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XVI, 49; and <ref target="volume-02/lt-18230218-TC-JJ-01"><sic>2:288</sic><corr>TC to JJ, <date when="1823-02-18">18 Feb. 1823</date></corr></ref>.</note> this was Fritz#x2019;s <foreign><hi rend="italic">Wahlspruch</hi></foreign> [motto]; and in this &#x2018;Place of Hope,#x2019; where indeed there <hi rend="italic">is</hi> nothing for us but Hope, every brave man, in reverses, says the like.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-05/lt-18301010-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1830-10-10">10 Oct. 1830</date></ref>.</note></p>
<p>For your success with the <hi rend="italic">New Monthly</hi>, or even with Napier I care little, except so far as it might enable you to continue longer in London, on the outlook<supplied>[.]</supplied> In other respects, I am nearly sure, failure would even be for your good. Periodical writing is, as I have often said, simply <pb id="pg-05-255" n="05:255"/>the worst of all existing: no mortal that had another noble Art, the noblest with one single exception, but would turn from it with abhorrence, and cleave with his whole heart to the other. I am of opinion that you have a talent in you, perhaps far deeper than you yourself have often suspected; but also that it will never come to growth in that way. Incessant scribbling is inevitable death to Thought: what can grow in the soil of that mind, which must all be <hi rend="italic">riddled</hi> monthly to see if there are any grains in it that will sell? A hack that contents himself with gathering any offal of Novelty or the like, and simply spreads this out on a stand, and begs the passenger to buy it, may flourish in such craft; an honest man, much more a many [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] of any original talent, cannot. Thoughts fall in us, as I said, like <hi rend="italic">seed</hi> (this you will find to be true); it is <hi rend="italic">Time</hi> only and Silence that can ripen these.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-05/lt-18301219-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1830-12-19">19 Dec. 1830</date></ref>.</note>&#x2014; So convinced am I of the dangerous, precarious and on the whole despicable and ungainly nature of a Life by Scribbling in any shape, that I am resolved to investigate <hi rend="italic">again</hi> whether even I am forever doomed to it. I will not leave Literature; neither should you leave it: nay had I but two Potatoes in the world and one true Idea, I should hold it my duty to part with one Potatoe for Paper &#x26; Ink, and live upon the other till I got it written. To such extremeties [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] may a mere Man of Letters be brought in Britain at present: but nowise <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, who <supplied>[have]</supplied> another footing, and can live in a steady genial climate till Experience have evolved into purity what is in you, <hi rend="italic">then</hi> to be spoken with authority in the ears of all.</p>
<p>Such lesson my dear Brother had you to learn in London, before even the right Effort could begin: it is a real satisfaction that, however bitterly, you are learning or have learned it. Henceforth your face and force are turned in the true direction: if not today, then tomorrow, you must and will advance prosperously and triumph. Forward, then, <foreign><hi rend="italic">festen Muths und frohen Sinns</hi></foreign> [firm courage and a cheerful mind], and God be with you! Fear nothing: <foreign><hi rend="italic">die Zeit bringt Rosen</hi></foreign> [time brings roses].</p>
 <p>I must finish now; for the cover will not be safe with much more, if Alick is forthcoming. Of public matters I could write much, but they do not interest either of us chiefly; greatly as the spectacle of these times (a whole world quit<supplied>[t]</supplied>ing its old anchorage and venturing into new untried seas with little science of sailing aboard) solicits one#x2019;s attention. I have signed no Petition; nay I know not whether had I the power by speaking a word to <supplied>[sw]</supplied>ay that consummation, or hasten <pb id="pg-05-256" n="05:256"/>it, I would speak the word. It is a thing I have either longed for passionately, or with confidence carelessly predicted any time these fifteen years: if I with any zeal approve of it now, it is simply on the ground of this incontrovertible aphorism, which the state of all the Industrious, in these quarters too, lamentably confirms: &#x2018;Hungry guts and empty purse / May be better, can#x2019;t be worse#x2019;! There is no Logic yet discovered that can get behind this: yes, in God#x2019;s name, <hi rend="italic">let</hi> us try the other way.&#x2014; By an advertisement in the fourth page of your <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi>, you will see that our Dumfriesshire Burghs appear to have got two Candidates already: His Honour, and David Hannay&#x2014;against both of whom the strongest objections may be taken.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Gen. Matthew Sharpe and David Hannay (<date when="1794-00-00">1794</date>&#x2013;<date when="1864-00-00">1864</date>) were adopted as candidates for the anticipated election. Hannay was author of <hi rend="italic">Ned Allen, of the Past Age</hi> (<date when="1849-00-00">1849</date>), and prominent in business in Dumfries. He was the father of James Hannay (<sic><date when="1828-00-00">1828</date></sic><corr><date when="1827-00-00">1827</date></corr>&#x2013;<date when="1873-00-00">73</date>), journalist and novelist. See <ref target="volume-05/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/12213"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>. In fact, Hannay eventually did not stand in this election, and the seat was retained by the antireform member W. R. K. Douglas. He defeated the General who was for reform. Throughout this month Dumfries, like other towns, was in a ferment. The <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi> of <date when="1831-03-01">1 March</date> had thought that the &#x201C;most eventful week in recent history&#x201D; was beginning.
<p>On <date when="1831-03-01">1 March</date> the first Reform Bill had been introduced in the Commons. It proposed to redistribute 168 seats, and, generally speaking, to give the vote in boroughs uniformly to &#xa3;10 householders, and in the counties to &#xa3;10 copyholders and &#xa3;50 leaseholders, while confirming the long-established rights of the forty-shilling freeholders. On <date when="1831-03-22">22 March</date> it passed its second reading by one vote. On <date when="1831-04-19">19 April</date> the Government was defeated, in committee, by eight votes, with a consequent election. Parliament was to be dissolved on <date when="1831-04-23">23 April</date>.</p></note> His Honour came <foreign>glenting</foreign> [flashing] into the Courier office last Friday when I was there: no recognition passed between us. Henry Duncan also was there, taking measures about the Reform Petition.

<salute>My Dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I must not shut up shop, tired as I am, without throwing you a word. Grace Caven will deliver it tomorrow faithfully, and it may relieve some of your anxieties.</p>
<p>All is well here, and in its usual way. When I wrote that hurried scribble from Dumfries, Alick confidently expected that he would be with you on the Wednesday following. He was accordingly down as far as Dumfries; and had his foot in the very stirrup to go farther, when a Letter from Stewart was put into his hands, adjourning the day of settlement till Monday. Alick would have sent <hi rend="italic">you</hi> word of this, to prevent your anxieties: but it was then evening, and all conveyances were gone.&#x2014; Well; on Monday, before sunrise, the unwearied pilgrim was on the road again; at Annan by the appointed hour (11 o#x2019;clock); and there found Stewart, Nelson,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ben Nelson, who backed Alick.</note> and some five or six Competitors: but after toiling and estimating <hi rend="italic">Cauls</hi> [mill-weirs] (with R. Brown) &#x26;c &#x26;c till six o#x2019;clock at night, was obliged to come away leaving the whole thing as undecided as ever! We are all very <foreign><hi rend="italic">wae</hi></foreign> for him; Jane, I think, was even <foreign>greeting</foreign> [weeping], and frets and speculates, almost as our dear Mother would: but what can we do? Stewart durst not decide the matter without <hi rend="italic">again</hi> consulting the Proprietor; the estimates for the <hi rend="italic">Caul</hi> being higher than he expected, &#x26;c&#x2014;and <hi rend="italic">he</hi> himself (I think we may add) being one of the most singular Men of Business that ever acted in that character. In short, it will most probably be a full fortnight before the business can be settled either way; and so much good time must be lost in suspense. Alick seemed to say that from &#x201C;the appearance of things&#x201D; he reckoned his own chance very small: but on cross-questioning, I could discover <hi rend="italic">no</hi> ground for this surmise; it rather appeared to me that matters stood <hi rend="italic">exactly</hi> where they were; and that not even the Factor (dawdling individual!) had yet made up his mind. Nelson, who is far above any jockeying, or even unfriendliness said that he &#x201C;did not at all know.&#x201D; He had &#x201C;done everything that he could&#x201D;; and last week he advised Alick <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to offer more rent. So there it must lie for the present. If not <hi rend="italic">it</hi>, some other place will receive the poor Flitter, and his stock: he can take Grass <pb id="pg-05-258" n="05:258"/>Parks, he says; and next year, as Young advised him, &#x201C;have a fly at the Dairlaw Hills.&#x201D;</p>
<p>From Jack we have had a Letter, and expect another (partly) tomorrow. He is well in health; trying some new scribbling scheme, but convinced, now <hi rend="italic">at last</hi>, that only in Medical practice is there any safety for him. He had some notion about applying for some Assistantship or other (could such be found <hi rend="italic">in London</hi><supplied>[) in]</supplied> which Jeffrey might perhaps assist him. This I warmly <supplied>[en]</supplied>couraged; and repeatedly, for I have written him two large Letters (under cover to Buller). I think he is growing very decidedly wiser and better than he was; in which case there is nothing to be apprehended of him. I told him to try Medicine to the <hi rend="italic">uttermost:</hi> if he could do no good in London; and found his last five-pound note broken into, to bundle and come off hither, and we would consult farther about it. I told him this in all affection; he answered very properly that he would do so,&#x2014;but not until among his last shifts. For the present he has Cash, and many kind friends; and as I said, he seems to be fast laying aside his whims and impracticable notions; gathering sense and strength indeed, and manly and even religious wisdom: so that we should be patient and thankful.&#x2014; For myself I am dashing away at my <hi rend="italic">Book</hi>, and determined to have it done and printed. Were it never so little that I wrote, &#x201C;it#x2019;ll no loup out again&#x201D;!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech: an expression of Carlyle#x2019;s mother meaning &#x201C;Once a stitch has been knitted in properly, it will not leap out again.&#x201D;</note></p>
<p>These things, My Dear Mother, I have written in the way of Narrative, to satisfy your motherly fears: of Inquiries, and anxieties of my own I could [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] all a whole sheet. Tell the good Jean to write me, if none else will: about you and your health, about my Father, &#x26;c &#x26;c. Take care of yourselves both in these frightful East-winds.&#x2014; <closer><salute>Good night, dear Mother!&#x2014; May God be ever near you all!&#x2014; Your affectionate Son,</salute></closer></p>

Text: <hi rend="italic">Fraser#x2019;s Magazine</hi>, IV (<date when="1831-11-00">Nov. 1831</date>), 448.

In an article reviewing some translated <hi rend="italic">Tales from the German of Tieck</hi>, an anonymous writer first refers to Carlyle#x2019;s remarks on Tieck in his <hi rend="italic">German Romance</hi>, and then goes on to write in detail about the gift of an engraved seal which had been made to Goethe on his eighty-second birthday (<date when="1831-08-28">28 Aug. 1831</date>) by &#x201C;fifteen Englishmen.&#x201D; It is known from the letters of Karl F. Zelter (who was told by an unknown London correspondent) who the fifteen were. See <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310717-FEF-G-01"><sic>Fifteen English Friends</sic><corr>[FEF]</corr> to G, <date when="1831-07-17">17 July</date></ref>, and <hi rend="italic">Briefwechsel zwischen Goethe und Zelter,</hi> ed.

Coleridge as <hi rend="italic">Goethe#x2019;s Letters to Zelter</hi> (London, <date when="1887-00-00">1887</date>). The idea evidently had originated with Carlyle, John Carlyle, and William Fraser, perhaps after hearing of Goethe#x2019;s illness and the death of his son. The anonymous writer in <hi rend="italic">Fraser#x2019;s</hi> makes clear enough that this &#x201C;initiatory compact,&#x201D; as he calls it, was the same as this &#x201C;Bond or Agreement,&#x201D; as Carlyle calls it (in <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310418-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1831-04-18">18 Apr</date></ref>), and which it is certain he wrote.

<p>As it is always the highest duty and happiness to shew reverence for whom reverence is due, and our chief&#x2014;perhaps our only&#x2014;benefactor is he who, by act and word, instructs us in wisdom, We, the undersigned, feeling to the poet G&#xd6;THE as the spiritually taught to their spiritual teacher, are desirous to express that sentiment openly and in common. For which end we have determined to contribute, in equal shares, towards some small <hi rend="italic">English Gift</hi>, to be presented him on his approaching birth-day, with a letter in our joint names; that so, while the venerable man still dwells among us, some memorial of the love and gratitude we owe him, and think the whole world owes him, may not be wanting.</p>
<p>It is at present proposed that the gift be a Seal, bearing some suitable inscription, and, as a stamp, an epigraph and emblem, selected from his own poems. It is further calculated that the cost should not exceed <hi rend="italic">thirty guineas;</hi> and that the contribution of each should not be less than <hi rend="italic">one guinea</hi>, nor more than <hi rend="italic">two</hi>. But all such details must be settled by the general consent.</p>
<p>For the present, our chief anxiety is, that the Gift, of whatever outward value, may have an inward value; that no miserable motive of vanity, or other insincerity, too usual on such occasions, may have place here;&#x2014;but that this, our united act, may be, what it professes, a testimonial of our common sentiments; and that no one who does not from the heart entertain such may join himself therein.</p>

<dateline><place>Craigenputtoch</place>, Tuesday Night [<date when="1831-04-05">5 or 12 April 1831</date>]&#x2014;</dateline>
<salute>My Dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Alick received a Letter yesterday from Stewart of Gillenbie; wherein with civil enough words the man informs him that the Annan Mill is let&#x2014;to &#x201C;a professional Miller&#x201D;; the Proprietor having so willed it. The Rent is <hi rend="italic">less</hi> than Alick offered.</p>
<p>So that this speculation falls to the ground, and after considerable riding hither and thither, we find ourselves pretty near term-day; and for the rest standing exactly where we started. I write you this piece of news (good or bad, we cannot know which), that, if you do not know it, you may be delivered from suspense.</p>
<p>We had partly foreseen this issue; and been calculating what was next to be tried. To think of forming any permanent settlement, now when Whitsunday is so near,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably Whitsun as Scots quarter-day, <date when="1831-05-15">15 May</date>. Tenants were allowed to remain until <date when="1831-05-28">28 May</date>. Actual &#x201C;Whitsun&#x201D; was <date when="1831-05-22">22 May in 1831</date>.</note> seems out of the question: the utmost that can be got were a cheap House, with perhaps a park or two; there to lie as quiet as possible till next season, when the world is all before one.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost,</hi> XII, 646.</note> Young, your Factor, was speaking of Dairlaw-Hills and Stenny-Beck, to Alick; the first of which A. thinks if it could be got reasonably were a fair settlement to try oneself in. Doubtless somewhere or other there is ground to till for a man that <hi rend="italic">can</hi> till; the world has work in it for one able and willing to work. Meanwhile the business is, to get a lodging for the current year.</p>
<p>Alick thinks he could furbish up our Peat-house, and live quite comfortably in it; a plan which really seems to me not the least feasible he might fall on. There is no flitting, in the first place (or the least possible); next year he has to flit again go where he will: then his crop and outstanding debts (from the Whitsunday <foreign>Roup</foreign> [sale by auction]) are all hereabouts; he may have a horse kept, and share of our Cow; there is also considerable work to be done (with fuel &#x26;c), for which I must pay somebody, and may as well pay him. It seems to me, he could nowhere be so cheap, and open for employment: the Cottage too is no such deplorable place, but tight and dry; would do very well for summer; and, in winter, it is likely enough they might get this house of ours to live in; at least, we are much bent at present on being <hi rend="italic">off</hi> <pb id="pg-05-261" n="05:261"/>somewhither during that season. Jane was for them taking part of our house even now (tho#x2019; not unapprised of the difficulties attending such an arrangement); but Alick clearly prefers the Peathouse, and I think is right. So far as we ourselves are concerned (that is, the Good Wife and I), we could almost, selfishly rejoice at the failure of the Mill scheme; for we were to have been very lonely; and of late, all things have been moving more sweetly than ever they did,&#x2014;as indeed is the way with human things; the <hi rend="italic">end</hi> of them is often <hi rend="italic">musical</hi>, like the Swan#x2019;s who dies singing.&#x2014;&#x2014; In short, I rather conjecture that this has some chance to be the arrangement for the summer. However I have not seen Alick all day (for his Fanners [winnowing machines] have been jingling in the Barn): if anything new be thought of I will let you hear with all speed. I doubt whether this scrawl is worth two-pence; yet on the whole I believe you will think it so.</p>
<p>As for myself I am struggling forward daily with my Book, and hope to be done sometime in <date when="1831-06-00">June</date>. This has been one of my dull bilious days: I was up too early and have done almost no good (except catching a mole in the garden): however, in general I am quite in my average health; and sometimes <hi rend="italic">hope</hi> my Book will <hi rend="italic">not</hi> be a Dud.</p>
<p>Of your state my Dear Mother I can only form conjectures, and hope, not without daily heartfelt prayers, that all may be well. Jean, I think, ought to write. Yet I know how busy you are: the spirit willing, but the hand slow.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Matt. 26:41.</note> <closer><salute>God have you <hi rend="italic">all</hi> in his keeping!</salute></closer></p>
<name>T. Carlyle</name>
<ps><p>We had a (very brief) Letter from Jack; who is in good health, and spirits: I expect his next Letter perhaps next week, when his projects will have better unfolded themselves. I have no room here to write anything. He has <hi rend="italic">good friends</hi> in London; or his case would be worse. I hope some of them will get him some <hi rend="italic">employment</hi>&#x2014;medical employment; for that is the only thing will ever do him real good. Wit he is undoubtedly learning, and it is time. <closer><salute>Again Dear Mother, good Night</salute></closer> <name>T.C.</name></p></ps>

<salute>My Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>We have a visiter here today (a Miss Scott<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mary Scott. See <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310420-JWC-EA-01">JWC to <sic>ES</sic><corr>EA</corr>, <date when="1831-04-20">20 April</date></ref>.</note> from Haddington) who is for Dumfries this evening; whereby I have an opportunity of scribbling you a word, which I could not do on Saturday, as I intended. Whether this will be really worth twopence seems doubtful; I have no paper, no composure, no anything: however it will assure of our continued affection, and welfare. So I scribble.</p>
<p>Your short Letter of Wednesday last (the Moniaive Carrier had not called) was very gratifying to me.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle appears to have written John a letter, now lost, scolding him for his dealings with Jeffrey. On <date when="1831-04-06">6 April</date> John, now living with Carlyle#x2019;s friend Badams, wrote to him: &#x201C;You do me injustice in your representation of the affair with Jeffrey. &#x2026; I have as yet received no money from Jeffrey &#x26; made no arrangement for receiving any. &#x2026; Badams is so ill at present that I shall have to keep close to him. &#x2026; I have left my lodgings in Caroline street to Frederick Montagu, &#x26; can take no further steps till I see how Badams is. &#x2026; Your letter does not &#x2018;offend#x2019; me but gives me the best proof of your brotherly affection.&#x201D;
<p>In his letter of <date when="1831-04-17">17 April</date> John writes: &#x201C;I am still with Badams who continues in bad health, which is aggravated from day to day by the embarrassments of his situation. I shall not forsake him in this crisis. Both as a friend &#x26; a physician I seem to do him good. It is my opinion that he must quit these mining associations, &#x26; devote himself to science. &#x2026; I cannot tell you about my plans for they are very vague &#x26; have taken no shape that might bear discussion. I shall not borrow money of the advocate, and in the meantime this resolution will involve with it the necessity of my quitting my London practising for the present at least. My debts here amount to some &#xa3;23 &#x26; it will go hard with me if I cannot find the means of discharging them. I have no hope of Jeffery [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] being able to get me any situation, nor should I like much to call upon him earnestly to endeavour to do so.&#x201D;</p></note> Happy that you have yet done nothing; that you will do nothing without due deliberation. This is exactly what I want. Consider, think, my dear Brother; let no <hi rend="italic">false show</hi> deceive you; act not till you feel your feet firm on the rock: <hi rend="italic">then</hi> act what you see to be best. I can nowise prescribe for you, such a dimness still hangs over your whole environment: but I bid you, and entreat you, consider <hi rend="italic">calmly</hi>, and let practical Truth not shadowy fallacious Hope compute the account for you; above all, do not <hi rend="italic">shrink from a little present pain at the cost of a future far greater</hi>. A man that feels he is <hi rend="italic">right</hi> can suffer and encounter all, he is stronger <pb id="pg-05-263" n="05:263"/>than King#x2019;s hosts; a man that <hi rend="italic">doubts he is not right</hi> has properly speaking no strength whatever. Act wisely, my dear Jack, and thro#x2019; good fortune or thro#x2019; bad thro#x2019; worst, I will ever love you and be proud of you.&#x2014;&#x2014; Your patience under my Letter is worthy of all praise.</p>
<p>From Jeffrey, whom I <hi rend="italic">entreated</hi> if possible to find some employment for you, or otherwise <hi rend="italic">really</hi> to help you, I hear as yet nothing. Indeed, ever since his arrival in London, his Letters, exclusively addressed to Jane, have had a very tumultuous frothy whirlpoolish character: I fear the St Stephens scene will do him no good; gyrating so rapidly round the Chancellor#x2019;s finger, a pretty little gem may acquire centrifugal velocity in excess, and fly away or in pieces. You need not doubt his <hi rend="italic">wish</hi> to help you, his readiness, to great lengths, if he saw the means. I pray that it may be for good; pray with my whole soul. You are of unspeakable value to me; for I have always hoped, and of late with more and more certainty, that you would <hi rend="italic">be yourself</hi>, and Brother to me in all senses. God guide you, my dear Brother, and turn everything for the best!&#x2014; You may judge whether I long to hear of you.</p>
<p>Had I known Badams#x2019;s address, I would have <hi rend="italic">written</hi> him my sympathies in these trying days. <hi rend="italic">Do</hi> whatever lies in your ability: we have both a good right; you only the privilege. I am greatly flattered and comforted that he so trusts in you. Assure him of my unabated regards and gratitude; he <hi rend="italic">did</hi> more for me than he is aware of; helped to illuminate the dark unbelief of my heart, which is infinitely worse than even bodily sickness<supplied>[.]</supplied> Say to him that I have a <hi rend="italic">friendship</hi> for him, and understa<supplied>[nd]</supplied> (what the most have quite forgotten) something of the meaning of that word.</p>
<p>Fraser has consulted you (I suppose) about the scheme of Goethe#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Seal</hi>.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle#x2019;s letters to William Fraser have apparently not survived, but in one of them he evidently proposed that they should persuade a number of Goethe#x2019;s admirers to make him a gift of an engraved seal on his eighty-second birthday. Carlyle had drawn a model of the proposed seal in his letter to John on <date when="1831-03-04">4 March</date>. The &#x201C;Bond of Agreement&#x201D; for the friends to sign is printed above, after <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310329-TC-MAC-01"><sic>TC-MAC</sic><corr>TC to MAC</corr>, <date when="1831-03-29">29 March</date></ref>.</note> It is almost shocking to trouble you in these times with any extraneous business: yet you will have to oversee this (in a quiet way) lest the good Fraser again become &#x201C;unfortunate.&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;A phrase of Dr. Carlyle#x2019;s, &#x2018;With the best intentions always unfortunate#x2019;&#x201D; (Mary Aitken Carlyle#x2019;s note).</note> I think we shall do. Nay in any case we <hi rend="italic">can</hi> buy a Seal, and have our device cut on it, and send it, we three. I know it will be a real luxury for <hi rend="italic">you</hi> to join; and if you have no money to subscribe with (as is too likely) you will let <pb id="pg-05-264" n="05:264"/>me treat you to that little happiness. At this hour, I believe our stock of ready cash amounts only to the trifling sum of <hi rend="italic">seven shillings</hi>; however there is more fast becoming due, no debt pressing (or even existing except mere trifles); and <hi rend="italic">here</hi> one can hold out long with a very slender furnishing. Never mind, then: <foreign><hi rend="italic">die Zeit bringt Rosen</hi></foreign> [time brings roses].&#x2014; I wrote to Fraser under cover to Buller (as I do now) two posts before this, gave him a Bond or Agreement to get <hi rend="italic">signed</hi>, and sent copies of it to various others. He had sent a Letter to you, he writes, but it would not find you. Oversee the matter, as you have leisure: <foreign><hi rend="italic">feste Muth und frohe Sinn</hi></foreign> [firm courage and a cheerful mind]!&#x2014;<closer><salute>God ever bless you, dear Brother!</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dearest Eliza</salute>
<p>My first determination after reading your letter and tasting your barleysugar was to write the very next week along with a Manuscript for Cochran<supplied>[e]</supplied><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >J. G. Cochrane, editor of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Quarterly Review</hi>, had written to Carlyle on <date when="1831-03-28">28 March</date> to accept his article &#x201C;German Literature of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Centuries&#x201D; for publication in the <date when="1831-10-00">Oct.</date> issue: &#x201C;Your reasons for not wishing to disjoin the parts of the mass you have built up are fairly stated; and receiving them as valid, I am disposed to meet your wishes &#x26; take the article of the length you state it will be, <hi rend="italic">provided you will wait till No XVI</hi>.&#x201D;</note>&#x2014; But the manuscript for Cochran<supplied>[e]</supplied> did <hi rend="italic">not</hi> go the next week; nor the next again. nor is it gone at this hour: but rather doubts are rising in mens minds whether it is ever to go at all.

<p>My Cousin! did you ever watch a goose hatching&#x2014;or a turkey&#x2014;or any hatching thing? If not you can form no adequate conception of the hopes and fears which at present agitate my breast. I have a goose sitting on five eggs&#x2014;a rather flighty sort of character&#x2014;quite <hi rend="italic">a goose of the world</hi> in fact who from time to time drives me to the brink of despair by following her pleasures whole hours with the other geese to the manifest danger of cooling her eggs. I hover about the nest during these long absences with a solicitude quite indescribable and it will end I believe in my sitting down on the eggs myself&#x2014; My Turkey again sits like a very vegetable (indeed she could not well do otherwise being secured under an inverted crate) but she is a born idiot; and I dread that the offspring will be all creatures of weak intellect also&#x2014;nay, more&#x2014;that one by one they will be overlaid or otherwise &#x201C;die from neglect&#x201D; like Roberts little daughter<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified, though just possibly the daughter of her uncle Robert Welsh.</note>&#x2014; &#x201C;The troubles that afflict the just &#x26;c &#x26;c&#x201D;! <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;Now this comes of having the world&#x201D;!</hi> as Carlyle#x2019;s Grandmother said, when by some miracle she found herself in possession of an entire gold guinea; and was at her wits end where on all the earth to secure it from thieves<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >This grandmother was Margaret Smith Aitken. See Carlyle#x2019;s long note on her giving the aneedote referred to here in Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi>, I, 161&#x2013;62.</note>&#x2014; When I had no stock I was comparatively tranquil. &#x201C;Angels and ministers of grace defend us&#x201D;! &#x201C;Art thou a Spirit of health or goblin damned&#x201D;?<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi>, I, iv.</note> O Eliza Eliza! We were sitting at breakfast yesterday morning suspecting nor evil nor good&#x2014;sipping a highly nutritive beverage of tea and whipt egg&#x2014;and talking pleasantly enough on some transcendental subject&#x2014;when suddenly&#x2014;an unusual sound of carriage wheels, louder and louder, nearer and nearer, interrupted the whole operation I thought it could be no one else but Miss Anderson of Straquhan [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>];<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A neighbor, of Stroquhan. See <ref target="volume-05/lt-18300806-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1830-08-06">6 Aug. 1830</date></ref>.</note> and ran to receive her &#x201C;in my choicest mood&#x201D;: but Lord have mercy! what was I come out for to see? seated in an open gig&#x2014;muffled curio<supplied>[u]</supplied>sly in Indian shawls, my <pb id="pg-05-266" n="05:266"/>astonished eyes rested on the large musculal [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] figure of&#x2014; Miss Scot! yes Mary Scot of Haddington&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">&#x201C;Hee hee hee&#x2014;M</hi>rs <hi rend="italic">C</hi><hi rend="small-caps">aa</hi><hi rend="italic">rlile&#x2014;hee hee hee&#x201D;</hi> But it was no heeheeing to me! the intensity of my astonishment quite paralized me&#x2014;and it was minutes before I could express the joy which I really always feel at recognising a Haddington face&#x2014;belong to whom it may. She was obliged to be off the same evening&#x2014; But we made the best use of our time. I took nothing in hand the whole day but <hi rend="italic">milking</hi> news from her (a rather rural metaphor) which she with unabating copiousness supplied. and could I tell you but a tenth of the facts wherewith I in this way stored my mind you would wonder equally at the capacity of the Instructor and the Learner. Nothing I think in her whole budget amused me so much as <hi rend="italic">a Tale of a nettle</hi>&#x2014;a still more serious nettle-feud than the <hi rend="italic">&#x2018;<foreign>Jenny Nettles</foreign>#x2019;</hi><note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The allusion is not understood, but a &#x201C;<foreign>jenny-nettle</foreign>&#x201D; or &#x201C;<foreign>jenny-spinner</foreign>&#x201D; is Scots for a daddy long-legs.

<salute>My Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Your present of the Cigar Box was no less well-timed than kind; it came on me when my former stock were within a dozen of the end, like a gift of Providence, as well as friend#x2019;s gift. Many thanks for it! I have tasted the Narcotic, and find it of the right sort: thus, not once but many times will I thank you; and if not <hi rend="italic">drink</hi>, yet heartily <hi rend="italic">smoke</hi> your health. You who are no smoker cannot understand the force of this.&#x2014; But will you not come hither this summer and see the House of the Wilderness; and the strange wild-people (towards you very tame and loving) that dwell therein? I think, you might easily drive a worse road: I could promise you (and your Eliza) a quiet sheltered lodging in a country <hi rend="italic">new</hi> at least; and the warmest welcome from friends that are not so new.</p>

<salute>My Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>With great joy I hear quite unexpectedly from John, that you are in London, busy and well.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John had written in his letter postmarked <date when="1831-05-02">2 May</date>: &#x201C;William Graham is here busy with some patent for steam-engine boilers of a M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Nott of America, which he may have to take charge of as agent if I understood him rightly. He looks better than I expected. He is to be in Liverpool before monday next &#x26; I have thought John Welsh might perhaps be of use to him there. I promised this morning to desire you to give him a letter of introduction to Mr Welsh, to be in Liverpool by monday next at farthest&#x2014;addressed to Care of Messrs W. A &#x26; G Maxwell, Liverpool. I did not know Welsh<supplied>[#x2019;s]</supplied> address else I should have given him a letter myself.&#x201D;</note> For many months my inquiries about you <pb id="pg-05-268" n="05:268"/>have been incessant; and, as in the Dunscore Wilderness was natural enough, almost quite fruitless. I had well nigh determined on sending out a letter into space in quest of you; and now by good fortune can send it on a rather surer aim.</p>
<p>John Welsh is what I call rather a noble specimen of the &#x201C;natural man&#x201D;: kindhearted, generous, just, as <hi rend="italic">hot as ginger and as <foreign>steeve</foreign></hi> [firm] <hi rend="italic">as steel</hi>. If you take the foregoing leaf, slit it off, alter the folding a little, and seal it, the indorsee will not fail to honour it, and you may find in Maryland-Street what furtherance is possible there, at all events, a little friendly talk and some social hours.</p>
<p>John (our Doctor) says little about the specific nature of your present objects: I can only pray heartily that they may be successful; and the means of leading you into a worthier and more congenial element than you have of late years so honourably yet so painfully struggled in. Many times, my dear Friend, have I thought with sorrow of such talents and dispositions as yours finding no better employment than fighting with the clay acres of Burnswark; for which task perhaps any foolish clodhopper were as fit as you. <hi rend="italic">What#x2019;s ta use on#x2019;t?</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle attributes the remark to Sandie Corrie.

<salute>My Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I last night received a Letter from the Advocate<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jeffrey. The letter has not been found.</note> on your business chiefly; and as I approve of the principles he sets forth there, I think it will be well to transcribe it for you, tho#x2019; I wrote at great length only two Posts ago. Perhaps it will materially alter the immediate figure of your proceedings. Attend, therefore, and perpend.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi>, II, ii.</note></p>
<p>After some preliminary flourishes about his &#x2018;splendid defeat#x2019; in the Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Election, our Chief Magistrate proceeds thus:</p>
<p>&#x2018;I feel, however, that I ought to have found or made leisure to answer your last letter. I honour your feelings and do not dissent generally from your principles: but I am not satisfied that you have made out a case for their application. If a man have really <hi rend="italic">no chance</hi>, or no tolerably probable chance of succeeding, so far at least as to be independent of future assistance, in the experiment he now requires aid to pursue, it may be wrong in him to ask that aid, and foolish or even pernicious to give it. But surely there are many cases in which the most valuable and important of all aid may be given to carry on such an experiment. Before deciding on your Brother#x2019;s case, therefore, I wished, and I wish still to know a little more particularly the grounds on which he thinks it probable that, in one or two years more, he may be enabled to establish himself on a footing of independence; and this, with your leave, I would much rather learn from <hi rend="italic">his</hi> information than from yours. I intended therefore to have had an interview with him, and to have investigated the grounds of his scheme of life, with some rigour and coldbloodedness, tho#x2019; I trust not without indulgence, and to have decided accordingly; certainly not in scorn of your highminded remonstrances, but probably with some mitigation of their severity, and some larger trust in fortune and providence than <pb id="pg-05-270" n="05:270"/>you may think it allowable to indulge. Our sudden Dissolution,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of Parliament. Jeffrey might have been elected for Malton (as he was eventually) without difficulty, but he accepted nomination for his native town Edinburgh. On <date when="1831-05-03">3 May</date>, by 17 votes to 14, the town council chose Mr. R. Dundas, a Tory. Since popular support for Jeffrey had been overwhelming, there was fear of violence. In spite of strong police protection the lord provost was stoned; order was just maintained, and Jeffrey#x2019;s carriage was drawn home in triumph by the crowd.</note> and the tumultuary movements which preceded and followed it, and which have cast me back here, have prevented this. So that as I can for the moment <hi rend="italic">do</hi> nothing farther in the business, I have only to entreat that you also would forbear to do anything in the mean time; and allow your Brother and me to settle our little matters in a calm business-like manner when I return to London in Spring#x2019; (? Doubtless, <hi rend="italic">Summer</hi>, when Parl<hi rend="italic">t</hi> reassembles).<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC#x2019;s note.</note> &#x2018;It may be very wrong for a person in his situation to insist on waiting on the brink of the pool till an angel shall stir the waters: but is it therefore right that a man of education, because his prospects are not very good during his first years of waiting for employment in a profession, should therefore substantially renounce that profession, and set himself down to eat potatoes and read German at Craigenputtoch or elsewhere? I have no disposition to throw away money (especially after having been forced to spend so much, so very unprofitably) without a fair prospect of doing good with it. But I scarcely know any use of it which is likely to do so much good as that which enables an able and industrious man to surmount the obstacles that beset his early carreer [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>], and to float him over the shoals and bars that obstruct his course into the fair way and flowing tide of the world. Trust me, then, my dear proud friend, in this matter, and do not fear that I will either wilfully or thoughtlessly do anything either to injure or degrade your Brother. I will have the fear of your philosophy before my eyes, and have little apprehension of ultimately giving you pain by my decision.&#x2014;</p>
<p>&#x2018;And so you are writing a Book, and why will you not tell me#x2019; &#x26;c &#x26;c</p>
<p>From which Letter, my dear Brother, the tone of which is as you see altogether kind and reasonable, a new light rises for me over the aspect of your fortunes; and I can now, what I could not on Thursday,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >This letter, mentioned in the first paragraph here, seems to have been lost. It was written in reply to John#x2019;s letter postmarked <date when="1831-05-02">2 May</date>, from which the following sentences are taken: &#x201C;Dark &#x26; perplexed as my affairs are, I feel it to be necessary that I should have all possible assistance. &#x2026; Badams is a good deal better, &#x26; I am at liberty again. He has been at Enfield for the last three weeks. &#x2026; I have had some trials in regard to him since I wrote. &#x2026; All that he had at Birmingham, has been seized by his creditors or rather partners in the Bolivar mining Comp<hi rend="italic">y</hi>, tho#x2019; as he says illegally and unjustly. &#x2026; Montagu who is in some measure, I know not how, concerned, has kept telling all Badam#x2019;s friends that Badams deceived him about some bills he (M.) put his name to &#x26; that no person now believes any thing that B. says. Mrs M. Mr Proctor Mrs P. are all against Badams. The last time I was at Bedford Square, about a week ago, they all set upon me to accuse Badams of lying &#x26; swindling, &#x26; for a long time past. I had known Badams exaggerating but never found him lying in any case, I felt that I could have proved many of their accusations to be false from my own knowledge. &#x2026; I therefore told them calmly that they would excuse me from believing such things of him till I had evidence for myself. &#x2026; &#x26; would not forsake him in such distress. &#x2026; Mrs Montagu, tho#x2019; a woman of the noblest feeling, has the gift of exaggeration beyond any body I know, &#x26; Montagu, tho essentially an honest man as I ever met with, has the power of persuading himself into opinions &#x26; beliefs which no other person could. &#x2026; I told you last time of my pecuniary calls or rather obligations. My debts have not increased or diminished since then. I owe &#xa3;23. Fraser has made me a proposal of reviewing one or two works, but his pay is miserable &#x26; would not keep body &#x26; soul together. I hear nothing of Napier, &#x26; my article is not in <supplied>[the]</supplied> last number. Your paper on Taylor is stout &#x26; good. &#x2026; Badams is not in a condition to do anything for me; Mont<supplied>[agu]</supplied> &#x26; he as well as the others I have talked with are confident that the Bolivar Compy will be successful. &#x2026; Burn this scrawl I pray you &#x26; tell no one of its contents in regard to Badams &#x26;c. &#x2026; I saw your letter to W<hi rend="italic">m</hi> Fraser &#x26; think he is scarcely worthy of such confidence, &#x26; fear you must not depend upon him. Crabbe Robinson is at Rome.&#x201D;</note> <pb id="pg-05-271" n="05:271"/>give you something like an <hi rend="italic">advice</hi>. Your own feelings are too sound to be fretted with anything that has hitherto passed on this matter; but you will see the Advocate as he is, a man <hi rend="italic">truly desirous</hi> of doing a good action, and who would think his money (even in a mercantile point of view) well laid out in purchasing such a pleasure. His sentiment towards yourself you will see to be <hi rend="italic">paternal</hi>, and look at his proposal with quite unprejudiced eye. For me too, what you perhaps reckon my Pride, were true Pride, savage, satanic and utterly damnable, if it offered any opposition to such a project, where my own Brother and his future happiness may be concerned. My &#x2018;Pride#x2019; says not a word or whisper against it: I will write to the Advocate that I heartily thank him for his determination to <hi rend="italic">aid you as he shall see to be kindest towards you;</hi> and what I have already said, that if he can save my Brother for me, I will forever call him my benefactor. And now my <hi rend="italic">advice</hi>, were decidedly that you continued in London by the best and easiest method you had at least till <hi rend="italic">Jeffrey and you have come to an understanding and decision</hi>. Consider your situation with unprejudiced fearless mind; listening no moment to the syren melodies of Hope, which are only melodies of Sloth; but taking cold Prudence and Calculation with you at every step. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Nimm Dich zusammen</hi></foreign> [Pull yourself <pb id="pg-05-272" n="05:272"/>together]; as I said (in that perhaps lost Letter) feel your feet upon the rock, before you rest; not upon the quicksand, where resting will but engulph you deeper.&#x2014; In your calculations too I would have you throw out Literature altogether:<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John never did and is known today chiefly for his translation of Dante#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Inferno</hi> (<date when="1849-00-00">1849</date>).</note> indeed I rather believe it were for your good, if you quite burnt your Magazine Pen, and devoted yourself exclusively and wholly to Medicine and nothing but Medicine. Magazine work is below street sweeping as a trade; even I who have no other am determined to try by all methods whether it is not possible to abandon it.&#x2014;&#x2014; It will be the middle of <date when="1831-06-00">June</date> before you can see Jeffrey; and as I calculate at the very worst before you ought to quit London. I hope you can make some shift till then; at all events it will not make your debt <hi rend="italic">much</hi> worse, and I think you ought to try it. The great thing will be to have a good solid story to tell when the day comes; I do not mean a <hi rend="italic">plausible</hi> story and scheme, but a true one; if you are after all <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to succeed in London, and this is only to stave off the evil day a little, I should emphatically warn you against it. Some other wiser project should be formed and assistance asked in that. Thrice and four time I would repeat <foreign><hi rend="italic">Nimm Dich zusammen. Nimm Dich in Acht!</hi></foreign> [Pull yourself together. Be careful!]</p>
<p>We are all thrown into real sadness today by poor Larry. The poor old toil worn stouthearted Nag is dead! I confess, it is almost half like a human servant#x2019;s death. Alick whom I have not yet seen, will be sad enough; for I imagine it is mere hard work that has killed Larry: such riding to and fro about that <hi rend="italic">Mill</hi>, then quite incessant harrowing for extra hours &#x26;c &#x26;c; till about a week ago the Beast grew sick with swelled throat and so on; then seemed to grow better, but on Friday relapsed worse than ever; I advised Alick last night to send off to Dumfries for Castor-oil to him (and the Boy was to take your newspaper, which by a secret scratch promised <hi rend="italic">this</hi> letter that now arrives along with it); but alas poor Larry died before midnight; and now <hi rend="italic">is</hi> not. Frightful, frightful is Death even in a Brute, and pitiable and black!

<p>I can now ask you with more confidence to look after Fraser: ascertain what <hi rend="italic">is</hi> the posture of things there; that we may help, or if <pb id="pg-05-273" n="05:273"/>necessary alter.

<salute>My Dear Madam,</salute>
<p>I return you the two Newspapers; in which, as you predicted, I have found much vehemence with little sense; an unseemly mixture too common everywhere in these tumultuous days.</p>
<p>As it is not probable that we shall meet again before your departure, may I write, what I have already spoken, that melancholy word Farewell! It is seldom indeed that I have parted from Friends, so lately made mine, with such feelings as you and your worthy Mother leave with me.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Andersons, neighbors of the Carlyles in the parish of Dunscore, were moving to Moffat.</note> But after all, sorrow is unreasonable as it is unprofitable. What is the whole of Life but a parting one by one, suddenly or slowly, with what was dear to us; a changeful Pilgrimage, which, were there not hope of a Rest and final higher Reunion, would be too toilsome for us? Nay, I often think, we are already United, <pb id="pg-05-274" n="05:274"/>could we but see it; they even that sleep in their narrow bed, from us all hidden, are they not <hi rend="small-caps">with God</hi>, as we too are, perhaps <hi rend="italic">nearer</hi> us than we think?</p>
<p>For you individually, my Dear Madam, it is not pity that I feel, but something far more honourable. Your Life has been and is a heroic self-sacrifice; painful indeed, yet enviable; for what blessedness is there in the world, except that same which you enjoy, the blessedness of labouring and suffering in what is our Duty, of <hi rend="italic">helping</hi> those that love us? Go forth then on your noble course, persevere in it steadfastly to the end; admired or not by idle mortal onlookers, your silent lonely struggles, be sure, are not unseen, and no one of them will remain unrewarded.</p>
<p>We desire a kind place in your remembrance, as you must ever retain in ours. Let us hope too that Time may not always be so unfriendly; that we may yet meet often, perhaps lighter of heart than we now are. Your Moffatt Address, at all events, you will send us: this is my Wife#x2019;s particular request. Say to your Mother all that is kind from us, all that we feel. <closer><salute>God ever keep you both!</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My Dear Mother,</salute>
<p>It seems very uncertain whether this small Letterkin will be worth its money: they would persuade me here that you expect no word on Wednesday; however I think it likely you <hi rend="italic">will</hi> call at Nottman#x2019;s;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The carrier#x2019;s.</note> and so must not quite disappoint you.</p>
<p>We got home very handsomely,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >From a recent visit to Scotsbrig.</note> about eight o#x2019;clock; and found all as we had left it. Jamie#x2019;s horsehair stood the work well enough, and the pony#x2019;s shoulder grew little worse. He (the pony) was &#x201C;all <hi rend="italic">foot</hi> together, but rather <hi rend="italic">light</hi>&#x201D;: we mean not to yoke him again till he is sound and whole.&#x2014; It was a great pleasure to us to have seen you all so well; and still so kind and affectionate: let us be thankful to the Giver of every Good for this among the highest of blessings.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-05-275" n="05:275"/>The unfortunate M#x2019;Caa, my Letter-carrier hither, had apparently taken to whisky by the way, and did not send over Alick#x2019;s Letter till Friday towards noon, long after the Boy Walter was in Dumfries, (of course <hi rend="italic">without</hi> message), and the whole matter irrevocably settled. It was well I had provided also for <hi rend="italic">this</hi> contingency. Unhappy <hi rend="italic">Redbreek!</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Evidently M#x2019;Caa#x2019;s nickname.</note> I charged him straitly, and he promised faithfully; nay I doubt not he even made an effort, but tho#x2019; the spirit was willing, the stomach#x2019;s thirst was too strong.</p>
<p>Alick seems to think that perhaps, after all, Monday the day fixed<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For the sale, advertized in the <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi> of <date when="1831-05-17">17 May</date>. His livestock consisted of 10 cows, 1 bull, 43 bullocks, 160 ewes with lambs, 4 or 5 horses, and there was also the farm gear.</note> may be as good as another. Fifty handbills have been posted up over all these regions; tomorrow we expect to see a similar advertisement in the Courier: Alick is for Dumfries himself to settle about judge and Auctioneer; we expect the Scotsbrig Whitebonnets on Saturday, and hope it will all go off with proper effect.&#x2014; Alick, I may mention as a <hi rend="italic">secret</hi>, has already, by private bargain, sold six score of his Ewes; apparently at a fair or even good price: he had let the men <hi rend="italic">take the road</hi>, but luckily determined (I warmly seconding him) to call them back. This relieves him of a heavy burden, and great uncertainty. His men are good, and either pay ready money, or give bill with interest. The price I think was some 15 guineas the score.&#x2014; Farther, he has this day finished out his Potatoes: the Austens had furnished him yesterday with a man and horse; and so poor Jolly was this afternoon set to the grass, which happily he is still able to bite. The old mare also is looking up, and it is hoped will be &#x201C;borne thro#x2019; with an honourable throughbearing.&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech. See <ref target="volume-05/lt-18300928-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1830-09-28">28 Sept. 1830</date></ref>.</note> So far all is well.</p>
<p>For myself I have resumed my task,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Completing <hi rend="italic">Sartor Resartus</hi>.</note> and this day accomplished two clear pages,&#x2014; which indeed is little, yet a thousand times more than Nothing. I too (like the old Mare) am in jeopardy, yet hope I may get thro#x2019;. The Book <hi rend="italic">must</hi> be written, if I continue living; the buying and reading of it does not depend on me.</p>
<p>The Stroquhan <foreign>Roup</foreign> has been g<supplied>[oing o]</supplied>n these two days; and, it would seem <supplied>[one or two words missing]</supplied>, John Anderson<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Apparently the son and brother thought for some months to have been lost at sea on the <hi rend="italic">Bridgewater</hi> and only recently returned home.</note> means to occupy the house; for he is buying in all the furniture of any value. He is a queer man apparently, and not too kind to those who best deserve <pb id="pg-05-276" n="05:276"/>kindness from him.&#x2014; I have no more Paper, and so must say Good Night. I will write again when I think you in want of news: daily ou<supplied>[r thoug]</supplied>hts and blessings are with you all. <closer><salute>God be e<supplied>[ver near?

<salute>My Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Your Letter of the <date when="1831-04-27">27<hi rend="italic">th</hi> April</date>,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dated <date when="1831-04-27">27 April</date> and in French, addressed to &#x201C;M. Thomas Carlile, &#x201D; but sent via John Carlyle, 16 Caroline St., London, who forwarded it. D#x2019;Eichthal reports the pleasure with which Carlyle#x2019;s last letter (<ref target="volume-05/lt-18300809-TC-GE-01">TC to GE, <date when="1830-08-09">9 Aug. 1830</date></ref>) had been received, how highly they regarded him, and how they felt that they should go to him and win him over as an ally in their struggle for the &#x201C;moral, intellectual and physical improvement of the poorer classes, condemned in his country, more than elsewhere, to a cruel fate.&#x201D; He ends by stressing that there was no one in England whom he wished to see more than Carlyle, and tries to persuade him to visit London at the same time as d#x2019;Eichthal expected to be there with fellow Saint-Simonian missionaries, which was to be within a few weeks. Elsewhere he declares that the time of their new religion has come at last, and refers to the strenuous efforts they were making to spread their doctrines not only in the provinces in France, but in Belgium following its revolutionary break-away from Holland. Carlyle#x2019;s response is partly in answer to specific points in d#x2019;Eichthal#x2019;s letter and partly a reply after reading their publications on which his opinion was asked.</note> which arrived here some days ago, demands my thanks, and a speedy answer. Memorials of your regard, in two successive packets of Saint-Simonian Publications, containing <hi rend="italic">Organisateurs</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">First Year</hi> of your <hi rend="italic">Exposition</hi>, with other miscellaneous sheets, had already reached me: these I failed not to examine with attention. A new packet, of somewhat similar contents, is now announced as on its way from London: this also shall not want at least one considerate reader.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-05/lt-18300809-TC-GE-01">TC to GE, <date when="1830-08-09">9 Aug. 1830</date></ref>, where Carlyle wrote to thank d#x2019;Eichthal for &#x201C;a packet of Books.&#x201D; It is not clear whether he had since received one or two further packets, but among those works received already or to come in the further packet which is said to be &#x201C;on its way from London,&#x201D; were <hi rend="italic">Doctrine de Saint-Simon. Exposition. Premi&#xE8;re Ann&#xE9;e. <date when="1829-00-00">1829</date></hi> (Paris, <date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>), <hi rend="italic">Exposition de la Doctrine de Saint-Simon. Deuxi&#xE8;me Ann&#xE9;e. <date when="1830-00-00">1830</date></hi> (Paris, <date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>) but only up to p. 16, and <hi rend="italic">Religion Saint-Simonienne.

They were also bound up for Carlyle in the volume entitled &#x201C;Saint Simonisme,&#x201D; but evidently this volume does not include everything sent to Carlyle in these two packets and previously (since, for example, the various numbers of <hi rend="italic">L#x2019;Organisateur</hi> are missing).</note></p>
<p><pb id="pg-05-277" n="05:277"/>To find myself in friendly relation towards men of intelligence and devout mind, with whom or with the like of whom alone is friendship and fellowship possible, cannot be other than gratifying. To see a little Brotherhood of such men, strong in Faith, uniting itself as a forlorn hope in the Good fight, and heroically, with such weapons and tactics as it has, making front against the boundless armaments of Evil,&#x2014;this is a spectacle full of significance, perhaps of pathetic beauty, for all good men. Allow me also to remark, with pleasant surprise how it chances that I, who have here the honour to correspond with you on public grounds, am already privately connected with you; that my former Pupil, Charles Buller,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In his letter d#x2019;Eichthal had mentioned meeting Charles Buller some months before and spoke of him as &#x201C;<foreign>votre disciple</foreign>.&#x201D; He added that it was his adherence to the doctrines of the political economists which was the main obstacle to the progress he would have liked to make toward adopting Saint-Simonian ideas.</note> is your personal acquaintance; nay, still stranger, that my Brother, whom you will see in London, was for a whole year the guest of your late worthy Uncle, the Baron von Eichthal, at Munich, of whom I too had some direct friendly knowledge. In all which relations, public and private, be welcome to me!</p>
<p>You require information of my actual position towards your Society, what I think of its Doctrines, Prospects, Procedure. On this subject it were fruitless to attempt explaining myself with any precision: for these many months I have glanced occasionally, or steadfastly looked, at the new Phenomenon, in a most composite mood; with approval, curiosity, anxiety; wherein wonder is still far more decided than clearness of judgement. To write the little that I know of you, and the much that I desire to know, would fill not one but many Letters.</p>
<p>I may say, with great sincerity, that my respect for your Brethren and Chiefs, personally considered, has not diminished but increased, on closer survey; that I discern in you men of clear intellectual insight, of decisive character, animated with a noble zeal which enlightens as well as inflames; men to whom, in any case, all generous hearts must feel a certain brotherhood. Farther, I may say that your <pb id="pg-05-278" n="05:278"/>speculative opinions, political, moral, philosophical, for most part carry their own evidence, and find hearty assent with me: often, indeed, I discern therein only a more decisive systematic exposition of what I had already gathered elsewhere. Especially important I reckon your delineations of our actual No-Society, of the Critical and the Organic alternation in man#x2019;s history; your strongly emphatic precept of our duty towards the Poor; which, properly speaking, is but the old duty of Love, of Mercy towards the weak, whether weak by want of pecuniary or other means; and has been and must be the basis of all social Morality. Neither can it be doubted that your motto and maxim, <hi rend="italic">To each according to his capacity, to each capacity according to its works</hi>,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Referring to the phrase quoted by d#x2019;Eichthal in his letter, attributed to St. Simon, &#x201C;<foreign>celui qui a donn&#xE9; aux hommes l#x2019;evangile nouveau</foreign>.&#x201D;</note> is the aim of all true social arrangements, which are the more perfect the nearer they approach thereto. In short, were the Saint-Simonian Doctrine stated as a mere Scientific Doctrine, or held out as the <hi rend="italic">Prophecy of an Ultimate Perfection</hi> towards which Society must more and more approximate,&#x2014;I could with few reservations subscribe to it, and heartily agree with you that it was the duty of all men, by whatever best means they had, to forward such a consummation. Nevertheless, in one quarter, lies a might chasm, the darkness of which is still to me quite void. You call yourselves a <hi rend="italic">Church</hi>, and founders of a new <hi rend="italic">Religion;</hi> which Religion, permit me to confess, I hitherto seek for in vain. Far be it from me to deny you a devout, <hi rend="italic">self-annihilating feeling</hi>, a recognition of God in Nature, and in all the movements of Nature, especially in Man the chief object there. Neither would I lightly undertake to define what Religion is, or speak of what is properly unspeakable. But surely in all Religions hitherto recognized, one indispensable element, and the essence of the whole, was this: <hi rend="italic">Some</hi> <hi rend="small-caps">symbol</hi> <hi rend="italic">or Symbolic Representation, whereby the Divinity was sensibly manifested</hi>. The Symbol may be the rudest, as in a Scandinavian Idol, an African Mumbo-jumbo; or it may be the highest, and of infinite significance, as Jesus of Nazareth, and his <hi rend="italic">Life</hi>, and his <hi rend="italic">Biography</hi>, and what followed therefrom: In all cases, there must <hi rend="italic">some</hi> Symbol offer itself to the worshipper; for hereby alone is Imagination, the true organ of the Infinite in man, brought to harmonize with Understanding the organ of the Finite. Such Symbol, or the vestige of such, I as yet nowhere find in your Doctrine: at best there is the <hi rend="italic">Prophecy</hi> also of a Religion, but still no Religion. Or if our Symbol of God is henceforth to be his own great <hi rend="italic">Universe</hi>, and our Gospel the acted <hi rend="italic">History of Man</hi>, then to my view is such <pb id="pg-05-279" n="05:279"/>Religion ill named the <hi rend="italic">Saint-Simonian;</hi> inasmuch as it has been the Religion of all Thinkers (tho#x2019; in a far-scattered Communion) for the last half century: of Goethe, for example; in a less distinct sort, of Schiller, of Lessing, Jacobi, Herder. Alas! Of such Religion the <hi rend="italic">Liturgy</hi> is still all to make; the <hi rend="italic">Homilies</hi> too lie scattered widely, as poor scraps and fragments, in the Froth-ocean of what we call Literature;&#x2014;whence he were a wise man that could gather, and complete them.</p>
<p>Nay more, in regard to this matter, I am still doubtful whether you do prudently in merely <hi rend="italic">Prophecying</hi> the blessed issue, Religious and Political (which seems to be your present enterprise), when perhaps you might far better forward it by other means<supplied>[.]</supplied> Why keep <hi rend="italic">pointing out</hi> the fair Heavenly country, which many men in all nations have already descried; when persons of such faculty as some of your exhibit might aid in furnishing us <hi rend="italic">wings</hi> to reach it with, which were the harder service?</p>
<p>You would mistake widely, did you impute these strictures to wilful blindness, to unfriendly indifference, to anything but honest doubt, grounded to I know not what extent on want of information. I have said to myself, and still repeat: Here too are men that know and feel thro#x2019; their whole soul the grand and almost forgotten truth, <hi rend="italic">Man is still Man</hi>,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi>, p. 296, and <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310122-TC-G-01">TC to G, <date when="1831-01-22">22 Jan.</date></ref></note> and glory in it as they ought; with such I am heartily, if not Brother in Saint-Simon or any other mortal, yet Brother in God, by whose Inspiration they and I are made to understand. Better, in an age of steam-engines, that such a sublime and to us infinitely cheering Truth, were even <hi rend="italic">mis</hi>applied than altogether unknown.</p>
<p>On which latter ground, were it on no other, I must wish you furtherance in England; and should rejoice much to meet you there, and confer with you face to face. Unhappily the state of my engagements, and even of my economical concerns, will not authorize a journey to London for that end. Nevertheless there is a clear remedy: cannot you come hither? Any one of three stage-coaches will bring you to Dumfries in six-and-thirty hours, two hours more will place you here, in our rocky solitudes; where kindest welcome, uninterrupted converse, and such shelter and cheer as suffices a Philosopher, lie sure for you. My Wife, who knows something of your Doctrines, and can speak a little in any of your three languages,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >D#x2019;Eichthal#x2019;s letter is written in French; his other languages were German and Italian.</note> cordially unites in this invitation; which pray consider as by far your best method of communicating with me. Hoping that this project of ours may take effect <pb id="pg-05-280" n="05:280"/>ere long, I for the present, with all good wishes for your Brethren and their cause, remain&#x2014; <closer><salute>Faithfully Your#x2019;s /</salute></closer> <name>T.

England, should you visit it at present, you will find in a state of Electioneering fermentation, such as the oldest man has not before witnessed.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >D#x2019;Eichthal had especially asked Carlyle for his opinion about the state of affairs in England, about which he was not uninformed. He had attempted to study English society on his previous visit in <date when="1828-00-00">1828</date>, when he had made notes for a book, published long after by Eug&#xE8;ne d#x2019;Eichthal as &#x201C;Condition de la classe ouvri&#xE8;re en Angleterre (<date when="1828-00-00">1828</date>),&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Revue Historique</hi>, LXXIX (<date when="1902-05-00">Mai, 1902</date>), 63&#x2013;95. He also explained that one of his St. Simonian &#x201C;brothers&#x201D; had been in contact with many Owenites and Unitarians in London, a number of whom he thought were not far from a complete conversion. He refers to articles which had appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Monthly Repository</hi> and to Mill#x2019;s series on &#x201C;The Spirit of the Age&#x201D; in the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>.

<salute>My Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>It must be frankly admitted that your last Letter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle is replying to John#x2019;s letter of <date when="1831-05-26">26 May</date>, which begins with a long passage in which John attempts to justify himself in asking Jeffrey for a loan: &#x201C;The abiding &#x26; essential difference between me &#x26; poor Waugh, to whom you alluded in one of your letters, is that he is very lazy &#x26; thoughtless &#x26; that I am not at all so. &#x2026; When a medical man is going to establish himself in London he chooses one of three things: he begins as a Surgeon-apothecary, a Surgeon, or a physician. George Irving has tried all the ways &#x26; some of them more than once; he is now settled in the first capacity having purchased a small practice, &#x26; may do well if he conducts himself ste<supplied>[a]</supplied>dfastly. &#x2026; this branch of medicine is taken up as a trade, except in cases where it is made a step to something higher, as George Irving is making it. &#x2026; All the people I have consulted tell me it is easier to get soon into practice as a surgeon than as a physician. &#x2026; I have only to beg you, my dear brother, to receive the whole of what I have said in charity &#x26; tolerance. &#x2026; What is Jane doing that she never writes me &#x2018;God speed#x2019; with her own hand on any of your letters? Bid her not be so unkind in future! &#x2026; The seal will be in time if finished before the <date when="1831-07-00">end of July</date> as it can be sent thro#x2019; the British Ambassador at Berlin. &#x2026; Did I tell you that Church had written me a very kind letter &#x26; sent along with it Duncan#x2019;s lancet case of Carved tortoise shell &#x26; silver which had been made for him in China? &#x2026; Graham left only last week in dull enough humour. He staid with me two or three days. I had supper with Allan Cunningham the other evening along with Graham. They raised one or two of their hearty laughs. Allan &#x26; his wife seem to recollect you heartily &#x26; kindly. They both desired stoutly to be remembered to you. &#x2026; Badams is rather better, good news it seems have come for him. Montagu says his affairs will all be settled &#x26; set agoing again in ten days; but he often calculates very wildly in such matters &#x26; is not in any case to be entirely depended upon.&#x201D;</note> is no <hi rend="italic">dud</hi>, but a real Letter, distinct, considerate, full to the very brim. So should all Letters, be in such a case as ours; do what we may, now that it is so long since we have <hi rend="italic">talked</hi> together, there must much remain obscure. My blessings on a <hi rend="italic">full</hi> Letter! It has so friendly a look: were the news it brings never so bad, you have at worst real affectionate sorrow; without mixture of selfish irritation,&#x2014;as if you were reading your sentence of death in the form of a riddle. Do often likewise, if you love me.</p>
<p>There remains a considerable arrear of news here, which I must now bring up, briefly. It appears, in my dislike of &#x2018;vain repititions#x2019; [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>]<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Matt. 6:7.</note> I have gone too far, and never <hi rend="italic">once</hi> stated that Alick was to stay, and look after his crop, <hi rend="italic">here</hi><supplied>[.]</supplied> He is now tenant of our <hi rend="italic">Peat-house;</hi> which &#x2018;with his own hand#x2019; (as Irving marked the Presentation <pb id="pg-05-282" n="05:282"/>Copies) he has brushed up into a very tolerable cottage, with two windows, plastered <hi rend="italic">brace</hi> [chimney-piece], wooden-floor ceiling; wherein he calculates on passing the summer well enough <hi rend="italic">&#x2018;for lodgings.#x2019;</hi> Poor Alick! Tho#x2019; fortunate beyond expectation in the <foreign>Roup</foreign> of his stock and so forth, he finds himself to have lost upwards of &#xa3;300 since he came hither, that is, at the rate of some &#xa3;80 a year, beyond his whole labour bodily and spiritual! We all think it extremely fortunate that he has now finally done with farming Craigenputtoch; for which enterprise he is evidently not adapted. There is still something like &#xa3;400 left him, with which he will be enabled to stock Dairlaw Hills, or some other farm, next year (as we hope), and try the trade again where he understands it better. He busies himself in the mean time scrubbing up his mansion, gathering <hi rend="italic">peats</hi>, and so on: I think, he has <hi rend="italic">got more wit</hi> since he came hither, which indeed is beyond all other getting. He has a considerable ingenuity and activity of character; great warmth and even mercy of heart, with all his &#x2018;dibble of a temper#x2019;;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Like Andrew Irving#x2019;s horse. Cf. <ref target="volume-02/lt-18230326-TC-JBW-01"><sic>2:316</sic><corr>TC to JBW, <date when="1823-03-26">26 March 1823</date></corr></ref>.</note> will surely learn more precision of calculation; and (with better times also) do better. His Wife Jenny seems to answer him exactly, is very fond of him; with her and children she may bring, he will feel a man among men, and shift his way, I hope, not unsuccessfully.&#x2014; By way of postscript I must add here that his losses in stock are not yet done: poor &#x2018;Jolly#x2019; (the Nag <hi rend="italic">Drumwhirn</hi>) died two days ago, of inflammation of the lungs. <hi rend="italic">Harry</hi> is the only <hi rend="italic">soniped</hi> we now have; and grazes with two Cows in our field, a universal favourite.</p>
<p>Jemmy was up at the <foreign>roup</foreign> (Monday before Whitsunday), and brought all manner of handsome tidings from Scotsbrig; where indeed Jane and I had been, as we prophecied to you, some ten days before, and found everything better than we expected. Mary was settled in her Cottage (close to the Scotsbrig door), and had it all clean and whitened; and looked quiet and contented, rocking her child; Austen [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] gives great satisfaction as a Farm-labourer and otherwise: so that, on this side, things were better than could have been expected. Our Mother was kind and spirited as usual; consulted much about <hi rend="italic">you;</hi> looked <hi rend="italic">back</hi> also with warm but not miserable tears: she was as well as I have seen her for a long time. Our Father also was stirring about, exceedingly <hi rend="italic">emphatic;</hi> but they seemed to have more the way of him. Jean and Jenny have rushed up into womanhood. &#x2018;Such be the changes fleeting Time procureth.#x2019; However, all the premises were whitened, cheerful; and the good people seemed as happy in them, as perhaps <pb id="pg-05-283" n="05:283"/>the lot of this Earth often allows. Of <hi rend="italic">you</hi> I still told our Mother there was no ultimate fear: me too she seemed willing to part with for London or elsewhere, seeing there was little more good for me <hi rend="italic">here</hi>.</p>
<p>As to ourselves we live the stillest of lives; except that once at Scotsbrig I have not been from home since <date when="1831-01-00">January</date>. The place has grown positively a <hi rend="italic">beauty</hi> since you first saw it; I would desire nothing better could I fly away with the whole premises, and set them down somewhere about Highgate or Pimilico; and there find work. So still, so pure are the air, the foliage, the herbage and everything round us, one might (if Arcadianly given) almost fancy that the yellow buttercups were Asphodel, and the whole scene a portion of Hades&#x2014;some outskirt of the Elysian portion. We have a dry warm summer, and the very perfection of solitude,&#x2014;which however is nowise synonymous with Rest. I am dressed again in grey (stuff), and wear your hair-cap, which Jane has retrimmed, and <hi rend="italic">now</hi> admires.&#x2014; What is more to the purpose, I am daily busy with <hi rend="italic">Teufelsdreck</hi>, which I calculate on finishing early next month. But like James Brown, &#x2018;I write dreadfully slow.#x2019; It will be one of the strangest volumes ever offered to the English world, whether <hi rend="italic">worth</hi> anything is another question. At all events, I determine to finish it, and bring it up to London in my pocket during this very session of Parl<hi rend="italic">t</hi> (if I can); and there look round me also, whether there is any habitation fit for me. To spend no other winter, at least not the next, in Craigenputtoch is what we have resolved on: <hi rend="italic">if</hi> my honest industry will support me anywhere else. I <hi rend="italic">must</hi> move, in fact; for I am getting quite entangled. The loss of time here (in a pecuniary point of view) is incalculable: thus Napier, tho it is said he hears my Paper well spoken of, has never either paid me, or sent the smallest notice about a new undertaking. In London, I should strive to ascertain if I could not be my own Editor. Two or three sufficient Mystics (such will ere long be in Britain) might do wonders.</p>
<p>I have invited Gustave d#x2019;Eichthal, who requests a meeting with me in London, to <hi rend="italic">come hither</hi>. I am very anxious to see their Publications, and hope M#x2019;Knight will get hold of them tomorrow. The &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">Globe</hi> seven nos. weekly#x2019; (for that is the sense I put on your wax-covered superscription) would be a great delight here; but I know no method of sending it post, unless you had Government franks: send it out monthly with Fraser#x2019;s Magazine parcel (include also the Magazines &#x26;c) and see that nothing be <hi rend="italic">lost</hi>. You must have one of Goethe#x2019;s Letters, I think; keep it also safe. You did not mention whether Bowring had sent three copies of the <hi rend="italic">Nibelungen;</hi> one of them is for Germany, goes with the <hi rend="italic">Seal:</hi> also (if possible) the Fraser#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Schiller</hi> <pb id="pg-05-284" n="05:284"/>&#x26;c<supplied>[.]</supplied> Have you got this and the other Fraserean <hi rend="italic">duds?</hi> Also <hi rend="italic">can</hi> you get a separ<supplied>[a]</supplied>ted copy of the English <hi rend="italic">Iphigenie?</hi> I want it for Weimar; and if no separate one is to be had must send Taylor#x2019;s whole Book.&#x2014;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310122-TC-G-01">TC to G, <date when="1831-01-22">22 Jan.</date></ref></note> By the way, Fraser, I think, has still a little Paper of mine, &#x201C;Goethe, Schiller and Madame de Sta&#xEB;l&#x201D;:<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Published as &#x201C;Schiller, Goethe, and Madame de Sta&#xEB;l&#x201D; in <hi rend="italic">Fraser#x2019;s Magazine</hi>, V (<date when="1832-03-00">March 1832</date>), 171&#x2013;76, and collected in <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XXVI, 502&#x2013;12.</note> request him to return it if it does not suit.&#x2014;&#x2014;I expected to hear from Fraser about the <hi rend="italic">seal:</hi><note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not James Fraser of the magazine but William Fraser, who wrote to Carlyle on <date when="1831-05-09">9 May</date>: &#x201C;During the next 10 days I can pay assiduous attention to the work of love on which you have been kind enough to employ me, in reference to the great Master, whom we venerate. I have got 11 Names already, and by Monday next hope to have added considerably to my list. On that day I will send it to you in a perfect shape. I have not heard from any of the gentlemen mentioned in your letter except from Mr Empson. Mr Buller perhaps may have been like myself busy in Election business&#x2014;but as he belongs to the Windham Club of which I am a Member I may perhaps meet him there, where, although I am not acquainted with him, I will introduce both myself and the subject to his notice.
<p>&#x201C;I think the Seal can be better and more expeditiously done in London (under your directions). It can be got ready in a fortnight&#x2014;and Lambert an eminent Goldsmith in Coventry S<hi rend="italic">t</hi> is willing to undertake it. The best way of sending it will be by the Ambassador#x2019;s Bag to the care of a friend at Berlin. I can through Mr. Dundas Scott of the Foreign office assure its going safely by that channel&#x2014;by which means it will only be a few days in reaching its destination.&#x201D;</p></note> I am &#x2018;quite <hi rend="italic">sure</hi>#x2019; the <date when="1831-07-00">end of July</date> will be dangerously late; and reckon so far as I can yet see that the Package ought to go by Hamburg, where it will be punctually and even thankfully forwarded <hi rend="italic">free of cost</hi>. Say to him, I think if he have Eleven subscribers, it were better to compute each at 2 guineas, and order a Seal to <hi rend="italic">that</hi> value, <hi rend="italic">forthwith</hi>. Too late will be quite fatal.</p>
<p>Hundreds of other things I had to say, my dear Brother, from this side of the house; but must turn now for a moment to yours. What can I advise you? Almost nothing. It is infinitely easier to discover that all your schemes are questionable, than to set you on any hopeful one. It appears to me that you have no heartiness in the busi<supplied>[ness]</supplied> of medicine, and would incline to give it up. I lament this (if it be so); for I again declare that to me it seems among the noblest of all human employments: but unless it so seem to <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, that of course says nothing. Tell me, however, have you any other outlook? I think not: for with regard to <hi rend="italic">Literature</hi>, surely your own Experience has loudly enough declared that by <hi rend="italic">it</hi> you cannot live. Flatter not yourself about the disadvantage of &#x2018;writing from hand to mouth#x2019;: did not Irving once tell you that, <hi rend="italic">except</hi> by Periodicals, money could not be got at all? Here am I writing most <hi rend="italic">deliberately</hi> for the last six months; and I <pb id="pg-05-285" n="05:285"/>know not in the least whether I shall ever even gain the price of my paper. Neither, I think, can you write any <hi rend="italic">truly</hi> good Medical Book, till you yourself have tried Medicine. In short, my dear Brother, it would almost give me pleasure to hear that you had quite thrown up writing&#x2014;for the next five years. At all events, in this I am perfectly decided: You ought to <hi rend="italic">borrow no sixpence upon anything like Literature</hi>. I feel <hi rend="italic">this</hi> deeply and clearly. Your sole chance that I can see is to form some rational plan of getting employment in your Profession (or anything else, if you dislike that), such a plan as will convince Jeffrey that you have a clear chance of success from it (so far as that you can <hi rend="italic">live</hi>), by aid of any reasonable sum,&#x2014;which sum to borrow from him. You speak of large sums necessary in the country? How is this? I have known men set up in the country with &#xa3;50; and &#xa3;200 I think were no bad beginning in many places. But above all my dear Brother, make up your mind to <hi rend="italic">something</hi> (for you are quite miserable till then), and stick firmly by it. God grant you light, and courage and patience! Do not think me intolerant: I feel for you thro#x2019; my whole heart, and pity you and mourn for you. Make a bold <hi rend="italic">effort</hi> and a bold <hi rend="italic">sacrifice</hi>, and you <hi rend="italic">must</hi> get thro#x2019; it. Write soon and <hi rend="italic">fully</hi>. God be with you my dear Brother, now and always!&#x2014;<closer><salute>Your affectionate,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear and honoured Friend,</salute>
<p>If kind thoughts spontaneously transformed themselves into kind messages, you had many times heard from me since I last wrote. Here, in our still solitudes, where the actual world is so little seen, and Memory and Fancy must be the busier, Weimar is not distant, but near and friendly, a familiar City of the Mind. Daily must I send affectionate wishes thither; daily must I think, and oftenest speak also, of the Man, to whom more than to any other living, I stand indebted and united. For it can never be forgotten that to him I owe the all-precious knowledge and experience that Reverence is still possible, nay Reverence for our fellowman, as a true emblem of the Highest, even in these perturbed, chaotic times.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-05/lt-18301023-TC-G-01">TC to G, <date when="1830-10-23">23 Oct. 1830</date></ref>.</note> That you have carried and will yet carry such life-giving Light into many a soul, wandering bewildered in the eclipse of Doubt; till at length whole generations have cause to bless you, that instead of Conjecturing and Denying they can again Believe and Know: herein truly is a Sovereignty of quite indisputable Legitimacy, and which it is our only Freedom to obey.</p>
<p>In anxious hours, when one is apt to figure misfortune for the absent and dear, I often look timorously into the Foreign Column of our Newspapers, lest it bring evil tidings of you, to me also so evil: again, <pb id="pg-05-287" n="05:287"/>I delight to figure you as still active and serene; busy at your high Task, in the high spirit of old Times. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Wie das Gestirn, Ohne Hast, Aber ohne Rast!</hi></foreign> [As a star, without haste yet without rest!]<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Part of one of the <hi rend="italic">Zahme Xenien II</hi>. The full text follows: &#x201C;<foreign>Wie die Gestirn, / Ohne Hast, / Aber ohne Rast / Drehe sich jeder / Um die eigne Last</foreign>&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Goethes Werke</hi> [Weimar, <date when="1890-00-00">1890</date>], III, 247). Carlyle would have read it in vol. III, p. 259, of Cotta#x2019;s collected edition of Goethe#x2019;s works which Goethe was sending him as the volumes were published. Carlyle chose &#x201C;<foreign>Ohne Hast, / Aber ohne Rast</foreign>&#x201D; to be inscribed on the seal to be presented to Goethe on his birthday. See also Carlyle#x2019;s &#x201C;Goethe#x2019;s Works,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XXVII, 432&#x2013;33, and cf. his frequent use of the phrase &#x201C;<foreign>festina lente</foreign>.&#x201D;</note>&#x2014; May I beg, for my own behoof, some few of those moments which belong to the world? It is chiefly in the hope of drawing a Letter from Weimar that I now write, in the Scottish wilderness, where there can be so little to communicate.</p>
<p>Our promised Packet has been detained longer than we looked for, and diminished in Contents; by a circumstance, however, which, we hope, will render it the welcomer when it comes. We send it, this time, by London, where also it will have to linger, and be finally made up under the eye of a Proxy. For in that City, let me announce, there is a little poetic <foreign><hi rend="italic">Tugendbund</hi></foreign> [league of virtue] of Philo-Germans forming itself, whereof you are the centre; the first public act of which should come to light at Weimar, on your approaching Birthday.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Goethe was born <date when="1749-08-28">28 Aug. 1749</date>.</note> That the Craigenputtoch Packet might carry any little documents of <hi rend="italic">this</hi> along with it, was the cause of our delay, and of the new route fixed on. In London, with which I can only communicate by writing, matters move slower than I could wish: nevertheless, it is confidently reckoned, the whole will be ready in time, and, either thro#x2019; the hands of Messrs Parish at Hamburg, or of the British Ambassador at Berlin, appear at Weimar before the <date when="1831-08-28">28<hi rend="italic">th</hi> of August</date>, where doubtless it will meet with the old friendly reception.</p>
<p>Of this little Philo-German Combination, and what it now specially proposes, and whether there is likelihood that it may grow into a more lasting Union, for more complex purposes,&#x2014;I hope to speak hereafter. The mere fact that such an attempt was possible among us, would have seemed strange, some years ago; and gives one of many proofs that what you have named <hi rend="italic">World-Literature</hi> is perhaps already not so distant.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310122-TC-G-01">TC to G, <date when="1831-01-22">22 Jan.</date></ref></note> To the Berlin Friends, from whom lately came a friendly Note,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle refers to a letter from Hitzig, for which Norton gives the following translation (pp. 262&#x2013;64):<lb/><lb/>
<salute>Sir&#x2014;</salute>You were already, before the appearance of your Biography of our great countryman, too honourably known to us for this work to fail in exciting in us the wish to enter into closer relation with you. The fittest means of accomplishing this was, it seemed to us, to invite you to become a Member of our unpretending Literary Brotherhood, and we offer you our most grateful thanks for having accepted, in so friendly a manner, our friendly invitation.<lb/><lb/>
At the same time we fear that you, Sir, may have misapprehended us, if you thought our view was to gain for our society any particular <hi rend="italic">outside</hi> agency. Its chief aim consists in the enjoyment of foreign intellectual works, and in desiring a connection with foreign poets and aesthetic writers, for the sake of providing ourselves with this enjoyment nearer the source, and of securing more authentic information concerning what is really new than the dim medium of the Periodicals affords. The Society is still too young to issue Diplomas, and, if in future it should do so, it would desire its members to make no public use of them. It is the way of the German&#x2014;even in <date when="1831-00-00">1831</date>&#x2014;to live more for the family than for the public, and he likes, where it is possible, to carry the habits of family life into Literature. You will therefore pardon the request, that you will make no public use of the title of Honorary Member of our Society, since it would tend to give to it an appearance of pretension which it would gladly avoid. Meanwhile, in accordance with your wish, we enclose to you, together with a notice of your Work by Dr. Seidel, our Rules, and an old list of our Members, whose number has, since that was made, increased in a very satisfactory manner. Our wish is, that we may very soon have the opportunity, of which you give us the hope, of seeing you in person among us.<lb/><lb/>
With high respect, / Sir, / Your most obedient, / For the Society for Foreign Literature, / <hi rend="small-caps">Hitzig</hi>.<lb/><lb/>
Berlin, done at the Meeting of / the <date when="1831-01-28">28th of January 1831</date>.</note> I purpose communicating some intelligence of this affair: it <pb id="pg-05-288" n="05:288"/>may be, we too in London shall have a little <hi rend="italic">Society for Foreign Literature;</hi> which, in these days, I should regard as of good promise.</p>
<p>The chief item in our Packet for Weimar will be the Proof-sheets of my poor Contributions as a Foreign Reviewer; the most of which I have had stitched up into a volume for your acceptance, till I can offer the whole in another form. If the last Number of the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review</hi> has fallen into your hands, you have already seen the newest of these, the <hi rend="italic">Criticism of Taylor;</hi> likewise, in the same Number, an Essay on the <hi rend="italic">Correspondence with Schiller</hi>. This latter is by a Mr Empsom [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>],<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Empson#x2019;s essay appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review</hi>, LIII (<date when="1831-03-00">March 1831</date>), 82&#x2013;104.</note> a man of some rank, and very considerable talent and learning; in whose spiritual progress, as mainfested in his study of German, I see a curious triumph of Truth and Belief over Falsehood and Dilettantism. He was the Reviewer of <hi rend="italic">Faust</hi><note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-05/lt-18301115-TC-G-01">TC to G, <date when="1830-11-15">15 Nov. 1830</date></ref>.</note> in a former Number; and on this occasion, still leaving somewhat to desire, he has greatly surpassed my expectations. Of young men that have an open sense for such Literature as the German; or of mature men that from youth upwards had been acquiring an open sense, there are now not a few <pb id="pg-05-289" n="05:289"/>in Britain: but the Critic here in question started at middle age, as I understand, and only a few years ago, from quite another point; is an <hi rend="italic">English Whig Politician</hi>, which means generally a man of altogether mechanical intellect, looking to Elegance, Excitement, and a certain refined Utility, as the Highest; a man halting between two opinions, and calling it Tolerance; to whom, on the whole, that Precept, <foreign><hi rend="italic">Im Ganzen, Guten, Wahren resolut zu leben</hi></foreign> [To live resolutely a whole, good and true life],<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle alludes to the last two lines of the fifth stanza of Goethe#x2019;s poem &#x201C;<foreign>Generalbeichte</foreign>&#x201D; (first published in <date when="1804-00-00">1804</date>): &#x201C;<foreign>Und in Ganzen, Guten, Sch&#xF6;nen, / Resolut zu leben</foreign>&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Goethes Werke</hi> [Weimar, <date when="1887-00-00">1887</date>], I, 127). The distinctions among the three were discussed by the Greeks and had been more recently elaborated by Kant. Carlyle quotes Goethe#x2019;s lines again and again in his works, usually (and significantly) substituting &#x201C;the True&#x201D; for &#x201C;the Beautiful.&#x201D; See, for example, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XXVII, 173 and 384.</note> were altogether a dead letter. How, in this case, the dry bones, blown upon by Heavenly Inspiration, have been made to live;<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ezek. 37:1&#x2013;10.</note> and a naturally gifted spirit is freeing itself from that death-sleep,&#x2014;is to me an interesting phenomenon. It is on such grounds that the <supplied>[study of]</supplied> the best German writings is so incalculably important for us English at this <supplied>[E]</supplied>poch. I am happy to report anew that we make rapid progress in the matter; that the ultimate recognition and appropriation of what is worthy in German Literature by all cultivated English minds, may be considered as not only indubitable, but even likely to be speedy.</p>
<p>For myself, tho#x2019; my labours in that province, have of late been partially suspended, I hope they are yet nowise concluded. The <hi rend="italic">History</hi>, when it sees the light, may be no worse for having waited; already, simply by the influence of Time, various matters have cleared up, and the form of the whole is much more decisively before me. As occasion serves, I can, either at once, or gradually as hitherto, speak out what farther I have to say on it. But for these last months, I have been busy with a Piece more immediately my own: of this, should it ever become a printed Volume, and seem in the smallest worthy of such honour, a Copy for Weimar will not be wanting. Alas! It is, after all, not a Picture that I am painting; it is but a half-reckless casting of the brush, with its many frustrated colours, against the canvas: whether it will make good Foam is still a venture.<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Like Apelles. See Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi>, p. 294.</note></p>
<p>In some six weeks, I expect to be in London: I wish to look a little, with my own eyes, at the world; where much is getting enigmatic to me, so rapid have been its vicissitudes lately. The mountain-solitude, <pb id="pg-05-290" n="05:290"/>with its silent verdure and foliage will be sweeter for the change; and my efforts there more precisely directed.</p>
<p>Here, however, are the limits of my paper, when there was scarcely a beginning of my utterance. How poor is all that a Letter, how poor were all that words could say, when the heart is so full! Do you interpret for me, and of broken stammerings make speech. Think now and then of your Scottish Friends; and know always that a Prophet is not without honour, that we love and reverence our Prophet. <closer><salute>My Wife unites with me in every friendliest wish. May all Good be with you and yours!&#x2014; Ever Your Affectionate,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My Dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Alick has taken me rather by surprise: nevertheless I <hi rend="italic">will</hi> write you a &#x201C;scrape of a pen&#x201D; tonight, tho#x2019; he stand there holding his horse by the bridle all the while.</p>
<p>I have been put off it three several Wednesdays by the more and more certain expectation of &#x201C;James of Scotsbrig,&#x201D; with Horses to graze; who, however, does not come. On Monday too I was to have had a chance; Alick and Jenny were coming down; but they also <hi rend="italic">did not:</hi>&#x2014;for reasons you shall hear.</p>
<p>Let me hasten however to say that we are all in our usual health, <pb id="pg-05-291" n="05:291"/>and occupation; that there is (happily) almost <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> to write about. I must except the state of our Horse-cattle: poor Jolly grew sick the day after Jamie went away; became worse and worse, in the manner of Larry: Alick rode for the Farrier; a useless creature full of Edinburgh conceit; who however was able to tell us that the disease was inflammation of the lungs, and that <hi rend="italic">many</hi> horses had died of it this summer. Such proved to be poor Jolly#x2019;s fate: in spite of all blistering, blooding and other care, he died (with little struggling) in about a week.&#x2014; Alick has now bought another little black beast; a young mare, seemingly very <foreign><hi rend="italic">fell</hi></foreign> [strong]; for some &#xa3;15.&#x2014; But the Horse-business is not done yet. For a week little Harry had been coughing; this Alick called a <hi rend="italic">grass-cold</hi>, and treated lightly. But on Saturday night, it became clear that Harry too had got inflammation in the lungs, and we gave him up for lost. He had never been in such case since we had him; and was a universal favourite. We judged, after deliberation, that the Farrier was useless. Alick rode to Moniaive; got drugs &#x26;c; and today I (very slightly) incline to think that the poor Brute will recover. He has been well waited on: this is the reason why Alick is not with you <hi rend="italic">at present;</hi> and why I cannot predict with <hi rend="italic">absolute</hi> confidence when he will; because he is to wait till he &#x201C;see how it turn.&#x201D; I think, this week some time.</p>
<p>He is to bring down his Cow with a Calf of its; also a large unparralleled [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] <foreign><hi rend="italic">Quey</hi></foreign> [heifer] (Cowie) from ours, which calved a week ago (as that incomparable James of Scotsbrig well predicted), greatly to the joy of all. This <hi rend="italic">Cowie</hi> Jenny of Scotsbrig is to nurse up into an incomparable <hi rend="italic">Cow</hi>.</p>
<p>Alick is literally standing with the bridle, since the top of last page!</p>
<p>These Magazines came from Jack about a week ago: he writes a long Letter; in which however there is nothing definite; except that he is <hi rend="italic">well</hi>, and has never yet fairly <hi rend="italic">tried</hi> Medicine in London: indeed knows not whether he <hi rend="italic">should</hi> try it there.&#x2014; I can advise him to nothing; except to <hi rend="italic">put</hi> away Procrastination, and <hi rend="italic">work</hi>&#x2014;at something or anything. I rather think there will be little sense of him, till I get to London: probably in some five or six weeks; then we shall see how it is.</p>
<p>I am toiling daily, daily at my <hi rend="italic">Dud</hi>. Very dull I a<supplied>[m]</supplied> and get slowly on: but I always remember your Saying; &#x201C;Were it but <foreign>twae stalks</foreign> [two stitches], it#x2019;ll no loup in [leap out] again&#x201D;&#x2014;one of the truest Truths.</p>
<p>You are to come up with Jenny and Alick, and stay <hi rend="italic">here</hi>. I myself <pb id="pg-05-292" n="05:292"/>will drive you down again. Come! who knows when you may see us here again.&#x2014; Alas! Alas! I remember this night twelvemonth <hi rend="italic">well</hi>.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >When his sister Margaret died.</note> But God#x2019;s will be done! <hi rend="italic">She</hi>, as I say always, is with God, and where God wills, as we are.&#x2014; <closer><salute>Good Night my dear Mother for this hurried once. Kind Love to my Father and them all. Ever your Affectionate</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I learn with very great satisfaction that our Friend of Minto<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For the Rev. David Aitken, who evidently meant to apply for the vacant chair of church history in Edinburgh University, see <ref target="volume-04/lt-18270217-TC-DA-01"><sic>4:192</sic><corr>TC to DA, <date when="1827-02-17">17 Feb. 1827</date></corr></ref>. The appointment would be made by the still Tory town council and approved by the University Senatus; but no doubt Samuel Aitken and Carlyle were right in thinking that Jeffrey#x2019;s influence would always be helpful. See also end of <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310707-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1831-07-07">7 July</date></ref>.</note> has come home so much stronger and heartier; and hope the improvement will continue with him and increase.</p>
<p>To you also I am obliged for letting me know about his Candidateship: I need not say that no such important enterprise on his part can be indifferent to me; that no little service I could conscientiously render him, here or elsewhere, should be wanting. It will always be a most pleasant duty to bear testimony of all that I know concerning him (wherein is much good) whensoever or wheresoever I am called upon.</p>
<p>I must warn you, however, that as matters stand, my writing specially to the Lord Advocate can hardly do much good. In the first place, I myself am very ignorant of Church History, and of who would be a good Professor of it; secondly, I do <hi rend="italic">not</hi> know whether our Friend is the best that will present himself, but only that I believe him better <pb id="pg-05-294" n="05:294"/>than most Scotch Clergymen; thirdly, I should fondly trust that with a <hi rend="italic">Russel-Purge</hi> Administration,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lord John Russell (<date when="1792-00-00">1792</date>&#x2013;<date when="1878-00-00">1878</date>), Whig statesman, who was to reintroduce the Reform Bill to the Commons in <date when="1831-06-00">June</date> and to &#x201C;purge&#x201D; the electoral system. Ritchie thinks Carlyle had in mind Colonel Pride#x2019;s purge of the House of Commons in <date when="1648-00-00">1648</date>.</note> Crown preferments will be distributed on public views only, the old Dundas System<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Referring to the political activities of Henry Dundas, first Viscount Melville (<date when="1742-00-00">1742</date>&#x2013;<date when="1811-00-00">1811</date>), and his son Robert Saunders Dundas (<date when="1771-00-00">1771</date>&#x2013;<date when="1851-00-00">1851</date>), whose complex system of preferment and patronage gave them almost complete control over Scottish political life under Pitt and until about <date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>. See David Masson#x2019;s article &#x201C;Edinburgh through the Dundas Despotism,&#x201D; in <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Sketches and Memories</hi> (Edinburgh and London: Adam and Charles Black, <date when="1892-00-00">1892</date>), pp. 148&#x2013;59.</note> having become noisome in the nostrils of all men; so that the circumstance of Mr Aitken#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">being my Friend</hi>, tho never so emphatically stated, could have no weight here.</p>
<p>On these grounds, more especially as the matter cannot be decided for a good while, I think it will be better at all events to wait. If in the course matters take, I see any prospect of doing Mr A. an honest service (which will be doing Justice herself one), then depend upon it, no one will <hi rend="italic">more zealously</hi> endeavour. Will you, as anything decisive occurs, of a promising sort, be so good as let me know: a Letter, (perhaps an old Newspaper), always welcome, will show me how it stands.&#x2014; It is not impossible that I may be in London before the thing is settled and <hi rend="italic">see</hi> the Lord Advocate&#x2014;</p>
<p>We are well here; and send our best regards to George Sq:<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Where Eliza Stodart, who was to marry David Aitken, and her uncle John Bradfute lived.</note> Many thanks for your punctuality in all Business matters.&#x2014; In great haste with both a Wife and Maidservant calling on me to Tea, I remain,</p>

<salute>My Dear Jack,</salute>
<p>I received your kind and satisfactory Letter;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John had written to Thomas on <date when="1831-06-29">29 June</date> and on <date when="1831-07-07">7 July</date>. It is the first letter to which Carlyle replies. In the second letter John said: &#x201C;You mentioned that it was your intention to come hither this month if possible. &#x2026; My own future movements must depend much upon yours. In the present aspect of our affairs it seems absolutely necessary that we should see each other, and thereby ascertain what is to be done, clearly &#x26; circumstantially, without trusting any longer to the inavoidably imperfect light derived from letter-writing. &#x2026; If you do not come to London I shall come to Craigenputtock without much farther delay. 
<p>&#x201C;Last week, after waiting till saturday if I might hear from him, I went to see the &#x2018;Advocate,#x2019; having resolved to remain no longer in painful expectation &#x26; suspense. He received me kindly. After hinting at your letters on the subject of my original proposal, he went on with great tact enumerating the faults &#x2018;a man#x2019; might have to prevent his success in life, such as highmindedness; a desire to begin at the summit without ascending gradually from the level ground upwards; pride in rejecting the necessary means of professional advancement; half-dreaming state of vague expectation, &#x2018;waiting for some angel to stir the pool,#x2019; without any fixed aim or activity, contemptuousness for <hi rend="italic">common</hi> people &#x26;c &#x26;c and concluded by asking what the real state of matters was. I had not gone to him to make out a strong case for myself, but to tell the plain truth of my difficulties, point out what I conceived to be the best outlets from them, &#x26; hear his opinion of the whole: This I did accordingly without ornament or exaggeration, hinting at the chief plans I had already tried. He replied by asking me where I had been educated &#x26; what I could do, and then expressed his opinion that the most feasible of them all was that of procuring employment as travelling companion or physician, if it really was impossible to find any situation as assistant in the way of my profession, which I had told him it seemed to be. &#x2026; Having thus talked over the whole matter, &#x26; with much toleration &#x26; frankness expressed his opinion, he ended the conference by renewing his former offer&#x2014;professing his entire readiness to give me any sum I might demand to put any of my plans in execution. &#x2026;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Mrs Badams is unwell at Enfield &#x26; my only real employment is going to see her occasionally, Badams himself having ceased to require my regular attendance&#x2014;being now better &#x26; calmer &#x26; altogether in a safer condition. &#x2026; But I have now said enough; &#x26; must suggest one or two things to you in regard to your coming to London. Might it not be well to have an introduction from Napier to Longmann &#x26; Co who are among the most respectable booksellers here&#x2014;instead of applying to Jeffrey for it? It w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be disadvantageous to come later than the end of this month at the utmost. Bowring might be made to pay you for the <hi rend="italic">Niebelungen</hi>, otherwise he may neglect it altogether. I can leave my present lodging, which w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be much too noisy for you, at a week#x2019;s warning, &#x26; get some quieter place. William Fraser will be very willing but unable to help you much in any undertaking. Proctor is too narrow-minded &#x26; too much shut up in himself, tho#x2019; he also is very kind. Edward Irving is the only stout, fearless man I know in spite of all his faults.&#x2014; I may remark that <hi rend="italic">Heraud</hi> is very conceited &#x26; in many things also very shallow as I understand him. Allan Cun<hi rend="italic">m</hi> means well, though you will find him considerably perverted in many things, &#x26; too ready to apply his talents for lucre by ministering to the appetite of the reading public. There is sound stuff in him but he has joined himself too much to Scott &#x26; Lockhart, whose literary career, as you know<supplied>[,]</supplied> has never been very dignified&#x2014; After <supplied>[all]</supplied> there is scarcely a living author except old Goethe who looks any thing like a right man in his vocation. Edward Irving told me yesterday that he wished you were fairly in the literary world to purify it &#x26; to take up something of the ancient manly position. He agreed that nothing could be done by remaining longer at Craigenputtock, &#x26; that the doctrine in literature as well as in the church is that the teacher have an audience &#x26; find a response to his words &#x26; see the life they have in others that hear them, &#x26; thereby know them to be words of truth&#x2014; You will do Irving much good as he will do you, when you come to London. &#x2026; The Parcel of books is not come, nor Lieut<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Barker. The <hi rend="italic">seal</hi> will be ready next week. &#x2026; George Irving has been exceedingly fortunate since he commenced practice in his new way &#x26; purchased a small business. Six months ago he was miserable as could be, &#x26; is now correspondingly elated.&#x201D;</p></note> and am now (in the most hurried manner for I really have no time but what I <hi rend="italic">steal</hi>) about <pb id="pg-05-296" n="05:296"/>to send you a two-pence worth of news in return. The Advocate writes me last night, that you are &#x201C;very reasonable and practicable&#x201D;; and seems to have good hopes himself, of a reasonable and practicable sort; only &#x201C;we must have patience.&#x201D; I will thank him from my heart, to-night on the Cover of this. Help towards <hi rend="italic">work</hi> I would solicit from any reasonable man: mere pecuniary help (for its own sake) is a thing one should always be in the highest degree cautious of accepting. Few are worthy to give it; still fewer capable of worthily receiving it: such is the way of the time we live in.</p>
<p>Were it attainable, I would very greatly prefer seeing you <hi rend="italic">settled</hi> to practice, under any tolerable auspices, to <hi rend="italic">travelling</hi> as a Doctor: tho#x2019; this too were much preferable to your present condition. On the <supplied>[whole he]</supplied> who has <hi rend="italic">no</hi> situation ought thankfully to accept any, whether <hi rend="italic">travelling</hi> or <hi rend="italic">stationary</hi>. I have some considerable trust that the Advocate, who is a practical man, and whose benevolent dispositions you do not exaggerate, will be able to give you something like a lift. Meanwhile, relax not your <hi rend="italic">own</hi> efforts for a moment: &#x2018;think project, investigate<supplied>[#x2019;]</supplied>: you are like a soul struggling towards <hi rend="italic">birth</hi>; the skilfullest <foreign>Accoucheur</foreign> (pardon the horrible figure) can but <hi rend="italic">help</hi> the process. Here too the <hi rend="italic">Cesarean Operation</hi>, as I have seen, is oftenest fatal to the foetus. In short, Jack there lie the rudiments of a most sufficient Man and Doctor in thee; but wise <hi rend="small-caps">Will</hi> must first body them forth. Oh I know the thrice-cursed state you are in: hopeless, grim, death-defying thoughts; a world shut against you by inexpugnable walls. Rough it out, toil it out; other way of making a <hi rend="italic">man</hi> have I never seen: one day, you will see it all to have been <hi rend="italic">needed</hi>, and your <pb id="pg-05-297" n="05:297"/>highest, properly your only blessing.&#x2014; Write me that other &#x201C;practical Letter,&#x201D; when you &#x201C;have <hi rend="italic">done</hi> something.&#x201D; Write me deliberately considerately: you will find an excellent exercise for yourself too.</p>
<p>I must not take in all your encomiums about my scriptorial genius: nevertheless I am coming up to look about me, and if possible even to establish myself in London. This place is as good as done: not even the last advantage, that of living in any pecuniary sufficiency, for I never was as poor. Naso the Blockhead has neither paid nor written to me:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Macvey Napier, editor of the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review</hi>, in which Carlyle#x2019;s &#x201C;Taylor#x2019;s Historic Survey of German Poetry&#x201D; had appeared in <date when="1831-03-00">March</date> and in which his &#x201C;Characteristics&#x201D; was to appear in <date when="1831-12-00">December</date>. He is nicknamed &#x201C;Naso&#x201D; by Carlyle since it is the name applied by Ovid to himself, and Napier had a prominent nose.</note> so that your thirty Pounds, and nineteen for the horse Madge has spun itself out hitherto. We are in no strait; I shall even raise the wind<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >To &#x2018;raise the wind,#x2019; figuratively meaning &#x2018;raise the money.#x2019;</note> for a London voyage without much difficulty: I can write to Naso, if he will not to me. I have some thought of cutting him and his calcined caput-mortuary dead men#x2019;s ashes of Whiggism at any rate. But fair and soft!</p>
<p>You speak of the &#x201C;<date when="1831-07-00">middle of July</date>&#x201D;: surely the world will not leave London, while Parliament is sitting. Ascertain what is the <hi rend="italic">last</hi> four or five weeks that I can expect to have of it. Not till that world-renowned Reform Bill, whole Bill and Nothing but Bill is done at any rate. I now <hi rend="italic">see thro</hi> Teufel., write at him literally night and day; yet cannot be done within, say, fifteen days. Then I should like to have a week#x2019;s rest, for I am somewhat in the imflammatory vein. London would quite put me off my eggs: I should have hatched <hi rend="italic">here</hi>, and only come thither with the chickens. As to the Teuf<hi rend="italic">k</hi> itself, whereof 122 solid pages lie written off, and some forty, above half ready are to follow, I cannot pretend to prophecy: my humour is of the Stoical sort as concerns it. Sometimes I think it goodish, at othertimes bad; at most times, the best I can make it here. A strange Book all men will admit it to be: partially intended to be a True Book I know it to be. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Nous verrons</hi></foreign> [we shall see]. It shall be printed, if there is a possibility.&#x2014; You anticipate me in the suggestion of Lodgings. There must I live [torn] and nowhere as a Guest: <foreign><hi rend="italic">Dreyt&#xE4;giger Gast wird eine Last</hi></foreign> [a guest for three days becomes a burden]. Hav<supplied>[e]</supplied> you no little Bedroom even where you are, and one little parlour would serve us both? I care about nothing but a Bed where I can sleep in, that is to say, where are no Bugs and no noises about <hi rend="italic">midnight</hi>, for I am pretty invincible when once fairly sealed. The horrors of nerves are somewhat laid in <pb id="pg-05-298" n="05:298"/>me, I think: yet the memory of them is frightfully vivid. For the rest, my Mission in London is <hi rend="italic">Anti-gigmanic</hi> from heart to skin. If you have a bedroom, do not change for <hi rend="italic">me</hi>.</p>
<p>Your idea about the Seal was quite mine; and glad I am that you told me what course it was taking. I despatched a most earnest emphatic Letter to Fraser,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Fraser.</note> by my very earliest chance (<hi rend="italic">his</hi> &#x201C;Drawing&#x201D; never came), which would reach him on Monday, desecrating those miserable gingerbread appendages; explaining by diagram, and utmost power of language, that <hi rend="italic">only</hi> a Star and Serpent, with the words <hi rend="small-caps">on</hi> <hi rend="italic">the latter</hi> could be tolerated: if not they must be on a <hi rend="italic">Ring</hi>. You say: <foreign><hi rend="italic">Siegel liegt fast fertig</hi></foreign> [the Seal is almost ready]: pray Heaven I have not been too late; and that wretched <foreign><hi rend="italic">St&#xfc;mperei</hi></foreign> [botched job] go to Weimar to shame us and England!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John had written in his letter of <date when="1831-06-29">29 June</date>: &#x201C;I have been to see the seal &#x26; find that the gold part of it will not be ready till the &#x2018;beginning of next week.#x2019; There will be no danger of its not reaching Weimar in time if it be ready about the <date when="1831-07-00">last week of July</date>.&#x201D;</note> Will you see into it: I fancy it must have been the Lapidary<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Identified in John#x2019;s letter of <date when="1831-06-29">29 June</date> as &#x201C;Salter#x2019;s in the Strand.&#x201D;</note> himself, not Fraser.&#x2014; The &#x2018;Books by Lieutenant Barker#x2019; are probably already with you by his uncle Major Johnston: Barker was countermanded, while the Parcel lay for him at Dumfries. Add the <hi rend="italic">Nibelungen</hi>, (and <hi rend="italic">Schiller</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Th</hi>ts <hi rend="italic">on History</hi> if they look tolerably). Taylor also must go.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310122-TC-G-01">TC to G, <date when="1831-01-22">22 Jan.</date></ref></note> I will tell you about it farther. It were well to get the <hi rend="italic">Letter</hi> ready perhaps. Poor Fraser is &#x201C;most dilatarious&#x201D; [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>].&#x2014; The venerable <foreign><hi rend="italic">Alter</hi></foreign> [Old Man]<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Goethe.</note> sends me, ten days ago, the noblest Letter I ever read: scarcely could I read it without tears.

<p>Alick returned from Scotsbrig last night, where he had been for a week. We expected my Mother; but it proved to be their Sacrament: they were all well. I must run down, before I come off. But poor Harry is still unfit for riding: he <hi rend="italic">too</hi> has had <hi rend="italic">Inflammation of the Lungs</hi>, and Alick and I doctored him <foreign>secundum artem</foreign> [in a professional manner] by bleed purgation, starvation and blisters: his blisters are now his only ailment.&#x2014; <closer><salute>We all salute you!</salute></closer></p>

<p>I hear nothing of Grahame: have I any chance to find him in Liverpool?&#x2014; I wrote to Irving three weeks ago, a little Note, about his General Assembly expulsion.<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The note has not been found. At the General Assembly in <date when="1831-05-00">May</date>, which Irving did not attend, he and his associates had been accused of holding heretical doctrines, although of none connected with his belief in prophecy or the speaking in tongues (the first case of which had occurred in London on <date when="1831-04-30">30 April</date>). Carlyle writes fairly in the <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences:</hi> &#x201C;What the particulars of his heresy were, I never knew or have totally forgotten: some doctrine he held about the Human Nature of the Divine Man, that Christ#x2019;s human nature was liable to sin like our own, and continually tempted thereto, while, by his divine nobleness he kept it continually perfect, and pure from sin,&#x2014;this doctrine &#x2026; I &#x2026; entirely assented to&#x201D; (II, 189&#x2013;90). Irving was effectively beyond the Assembly#x2019;s jurisdiction while he remained in London.

<salute>My Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Accept my best acknowledgements for your kindness to that <foreign><hi rend="italic">Nibelungen</hi></foreign> Essay; which I now see admitted into public existence; and even to an upper place in the Synagogue,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Matt. 23:6; Mark 12:39. Bowring had made it the leading article in the <hi rend="italic">Westminster Review</hi>, XV (<date when="1831-07-00">July 1831</date>), 1&#x2013;45.</note> tho#x2019; I fear, it is far from meriting such dignity. The Paper is harmless, but contains nothing or very little. I now write (counting on your frankness) to say that it will be a considerable convenience (as I find today) if you could be so good as remit what trifle of Payment your Booksellers reckon due for the Article, into the hands of my Brother, &#x201C;Dr Carlyle, 16. Caroline Street, Bedford Square.&#x201D; Perhaps I am somewhat premature in this so prompt demand for wages: but if so, you will readily pardon me, for a small point is to be gained thereby, and even a <hi rend="italic">duty</hi> to be discharged.</p>
<p>Your promised Letter, which would have been so welcome, still lingers. However, I expect in a few weeks to be in London myself, and shall then use all diligence to see you, and communicate face to face about many things.</p>
<p>Our wondrous Saint-Simonian Friends are making great way; converts in every direction. Their <hi rend="italic">Sermons</hi>, it must be admitted, are monotonous enough; already almost as wearisome as our Parish Church ones. Nevertheless, so unfurnished is the general Heart and Head, at this epoch, I should not be much surprised if the New Religion (as it is pleased to name itself) gained very universal acceptance among the <pb id="pg-05-301" n="05:301"/>Young; who again, in their turn, become the Old.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In his letter of <date when="1831-03-04">4 March</date> Bowring appears to mention an account of St.-Simonianism &#x201C;by a contributor&#x201D; who is unnamed (the letter is badly torn), adding that &#x201C;you should have done the deed,&#x201D; and noting that the success of &#x201C;this sect is one of the most extraordinary of modern phenomena,&#x2014;whether political or religious. I have looked at them closely&#x2014;frequently discussed matters with their chiefs&#x2014; I don#x2019;t deny there are bright gems of truth in the midst of crudity.&#x201D; A long article eventually appeared in XVI (<date when="1832-04-00">April 1832</date>), 279&#x2013;321. Bowring had first met the St.-Simonians in France at the time of the <date when="1830-07-00">July</date> revolution of <date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>; see his <hi rend="italic">Autobiographical Recollections</hi> (London, <date when="1877-00-00">1877</date>), pp. 384&#x2013;86. Carlyle had translated Saint-Simon#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Nouveau Christianisme</hi> (see <ref target="volume-05/lt-18301219-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1830-12-19">19 Dec. 1830</date></ref>), which he was to lend Bowring. No doubt he refers here to this and their other writings, but the Saint-Simonians also spoke of themselves as missionaries preaching a &#x201C;New Religion.&#x201D;</note> One comfort is that enter where it may, it is like to cast out seven Devils worse than itself.</p>

<p><salute>My Dear Brother,&#x2014;</salute> I wrote last Thursday under cover to the L<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Advocate, which Letter perhaps you have before this received: however not knowing the right address, I was obliged to address the M.P. &#x201C;at London,&#x201D; so that some delay may have occurred. Alick and I were down at the Kirk on Sunday (I went, for the first time these many months, because of the <hi rend="italic">Irish</hi> Collection<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Collections for the Irish poor were taken up at many churches throughout Dumfriesshire in <date when="1831-07-00">July</date>. No details are known of the collection at Dunscore church. Times were hard and a cholera scourge was at this time sweeping over England.</note>), and there your Letter was lying; which demands a quite instantaneous reply. I regretted greatly that no device of mine could take effect sooner than tonight (for Harry is still <hi rend="italic">unride</hi>able): but as if it had been some relief, I made ready another Letter for your Behoof (of which anon) that very night, and have had it lying here, sealed, ever since. It was a Letter to Bowring, requesting him to pay the <foreign>Nibelungen</foreign> Article forthwith into your hands: I did this as courteously as possible, and imagine he will not fail. However, a day or two may elapse; and in the mean while you have nothing. Had I been at Dumfries, I would have got a Bank of <pb id="pg-05-302" n="05:302"/>England note; but there is none such here: we have not even a better than this of <hi rend="italic">one</hi> pound (tho#x2019; I tried to borrow a <hi rend="italic">five</hi>, in vain): so you must receive it as our poor <foreign>non-plus-ultra</foreign>. Take it to William Hamilton<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >As Carlyle affirms in the <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> (II, 121), he was a shrewd and successful merchant, originally from Nithsdale, who had married Mrs. Edward Irving#x2019;s sister. He had been made an elder by Irving in <date when="1827-00-00">1827</date>, loyally supported him though he disagreed about the &#x201C;tongues,&#x201D; and after Irving#x2019;s death helped to maintain the Regent Square church as a Presbyterian establishment.</note> in Cheapside; say your Brother was sending you money &#x26;c, and requested that he would give you a sovereign for <hi rend="italic">this</hi>. If Bowring do not send before it is done, I think you may call on him. I suppose there will be <hi rend="italic">three sheets</hi>, and their pay is only ten guineas. Take off it what you have need of till I come. Write also a word on the Paper to say how it is, and you are. I have had you little out of my head since sunday last.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In his letter of <date when="1831-07-07">7 July</date>, to which Thomas is now replying, John had written that at the end of his interview with Jeffrey &#x201C;when we had done &#x26; were just going to part he enquired if I was in immediate want of money; and I answered in the affirmative, for I felt rather confused &#x26; agitated at the almost entire vacancy which lay before me in the result immediate of our interview, &#x26; had in truth only seven shillings in my possession. I accepted of a draft for &#xa3;20, which, however, I found on mature consideration that I could not, with any comfort, or consistency or even with an entirely clear conscience, retain, and therefore I returned it again on monday telling my <supplied>[rea]</supplied>son; &#x26; stating that I should not hesitate to accept his very generous offer whenever I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> see my way so clearly as to be able to do it with honesty. Thus the matter stands at present. For the rest, I am calm &#x26; compressed for action.&#x201D;</note></p>
<p>Shocking as your situation is, however, we all here agree that it is more hopeful than we have ever yet had clear argument to think it. Thank God you have done no wrong: your conscience is free, and <hi rend="italic">you yourself</hi> are there. We all reckon that your Conduct in that matter of Jeffrey#x2019;s &#xa3;20 was entitled to be called <hi rend="italic">heroic</hi>. Sooner or later, my dear Brother, it must have come to this, namely, that your own <hi rend="italic">miscellaneous</hi> industry could not support you in London, and that you ceased to borrow: better, we say, now than later. Bear up, front it bravely: there are friendly eyes upon you, and hearts praying for you. Were we once together, it will be peremptorily necessary to consider how the land lies, and what is to be done. In <hi rend="italic">all</hi> situations (out of Tophet) there is <hi rend="italic">a Duty</hi>, and our highest blessedness lies in doing it.&#x2014;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi>, p. 196.</note> I know not whether Jeffrey may be able to do anything for you; he speaks to me rather more hopefully than he seems to have done to you:<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >This letter has not been found.</note> I can have no doubt of his wish, but some of his ability. Could you fix on anything as possible and feasible <hi rend="italic">yourself</hi>, and have only <pb id="pg-05-303" n="05:303"/>to ask his furtherance, he would give it gladly.&#x2014; He represents himself as on the outlook for <hi rend="italic">me</hi> too: for I told him I was thinking of London; felt ready to work at <hi rend="small-caps">any</hi> honest thing whatsoever; did not see that Literature could support an <hi rend="italic">honest</hi> man otherwise than <foreign><hi rend="italic">&#xE0; la Diogenes;</hi></foreign> in which fashion too I meant to experiment, if <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> else could be found, which however, thro all channels of investigation, I was minded to try. He wrote back asking what manner of Clerkship in Excise offices, at the Board of Longitude &#x26;c &#x26;c I <hi rend="italic">detested least:</hi> I answered that I <hi rend="italic">liked them all;</hi> if he heard of any, to let me know instantly. I do not expect that he will be able to accomplish anything for me. I must even get thro#x2019; life <hi rend="italic">without a trade</hi>, always in poverty, as far better men have done. Our want is the want of <hi rend="italic">Faith</hi>. Jesus of Nazareth was not poor tho#x2019; he had not where to lay his head. Socrates was rich enough.&#x2014; I have a deep, irrevocable all-comprehending Ernulphus Curse to read upon&#x2014;<hi rend="small-caps">Gigmanity</hi>;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-02/lt-18230810-TC-JBW-01"><sic>2:412</sic><corr>TC to JBW, <date when="1823-08-10">10 Aug. 1823</date></corr></ref>. Cf. also Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi>, p. 140.</note> that is the Baal worship of this time.</p>
<p>I shall study to be with you about the <date when="1831-08-00">beginning of August</date>. I have written as you suggested to Napier for a note to Longman; also for payment of what he owes me. I am struggling forward with Dreck, sick enough, but not in bad heart. I think the world will nowise be enraptured with this (medicinal) <hi rend="italic">Devil#x2019;s Dung;</hi><note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Teufelsdr&#xF6;ckh,&#x201D; which means &#x201C;Devil#x2019;s dung,&#x201D; is also a modified spelling of the German word &#x201C;Teufelsdreck,&#x201D; the word for asafoetida which Carlyle mentions in his letter to John of <date when="1831-07-17">17 July</date>. Carlyle has in mind in both letters the idea of asafoetida as an emetic. See Tennyson, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi>, pp. 220&#x2013;22.</note> that the critical republic will cackle vituperatively or perhaps maintain total silence: <foreign><hi rend="italic">&#xE0; la bonne heure</hi></foreign> [well and good]! It was the best I had in me; what God had given me, what the Devil shall not take away.</p>
<p>I am very glad the Seal is about done, and in a way that satisfies you. The Earth and Bandelier once removed, I had no other objection. Will you now inquire punctually when the Steamboats go away (in how many days it is <hi rend="italic">sure</hi> to reach Hamburg): I think I must scribble some Letter to go with it, and send it off to Fraser to get copied and signed. If I can manage so, it shall be sent off on Sunday next&#x2014;under frank &#x2014;</p>
<p>I hope, the Books have arrived. Tell me whether or not. We only heard about their new destination a few days ago (Barker had sent one Letter which never came). I should have written to our Mother tonight, but cannot, I am so far back with my &#x201C;Chapter on Symbols.&#x201D; I am at the 132<hi rend="italic">nd</hi> page: there may be some 170; but much of it is half-written.&#x2014; <pb id="pg-05-304" n="05:304"/>Be of good cheer, my dear Brother! Behave wisely and continue to trust in God. No doubt, <hi rend="small-caps">He</hi> sent you hither, to work out His will: it is man#x2019;s mission; and blessedness, could he but rightly walk in it. <closer><salute>Write to me; trust in me. Ever Your Brother,</salute></closer></p>
<name>T. Carlyle&#x2014;</name>
<ps><p>&#x2014;Jane is not at all well of late weeks: she is sometimes talking of consulting you, by Letter&#x2014;I have a very ugly headache (it is between dinner and tea: I am in <hi rend="italic">your</hi> old upper room, to avoid noises); so I will write no more. Tea will cure my headache. I usually go idle at this hour.&#x2014; Alick is ploughing his potatoes.</p>
<p>A Letter went off to Badams<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> (as I predicted) that night: it was directed 7. Lancaster Place. I preached up &#x201C;Stoical Religion,&#x201D; and a contempt of the Outward. I fear poor Badams <hi rend="italic">has</hi> done something questionable: <hi rend="italic">that</hi> is the worst, the only real misery; but even that is not <hi rend="italic">despair</hi>.</p></ps>

<salute>My Dear Jack,</salute>
<p>I have under this same Cover (by favour of the Advocate) despatched the Weimar Letter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The birthday letter to be sent to Goethe from &#x201C;fifteen English friends.&#x201D; See the text immediately below, <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310717-FEF-G-01"><sic>&#x201C;Fifteen English Friends to the Poet Goethe&#x201D; [<date when="1831-07-17">17 (?) July</date>]</sic><corr>FEF to G, <date when="1831-07-17">17 (?) July</date></corr></ref>.</note> (that is to go with the Seal) into Fraser#x2019;s hand: he is to get it copied, signed &#x26;c; and then deliver over the whole to you; by whom (as I see on Friday that the &#x2018;<foreign>B&#xfc;cher</foreign>#x2019; [books] are &#x2018;<foreign>gekommen</foreign>#x2019; [have arrived]) it can then be despatched without loss of a moment.</p>
<p>You will wrap the whole items, as neatly and stoutly as may be, under one cover, addressed: <foreign><hi rend="italic">Seiner Excellenz &#x26;c in Weimar</hi></foreign> [To his Excellency in Weimar]; on the top of which lay this Letter for Messrs Parish (having sealed it); then bind up the whole under another ply of brown paper, write on it: Messrs Parish &#x26; Co Merchants Hamburg (<hi rend="italic">Speed</hi>), and send it off by the fleetest of Steamboats, <foreign><hi rend="italic">andar con Dios</hi></foreign> [to go with God]! I think I have now done with it, after paying my subscription&#x2014; You, I observed, had not subscribed (notwithstanding <pb id="pg-05-305" n="05:305"/>my offer); and doubtless considering the actual state of our funds, it was a wise sacrifice.</p>
<p>I have written twice; once <hi rend="italic">since</hi> your last Letter, as doubtless you would (yesterday, I think) discover. There was the meagrest of Bank Notes, and a notification that Bowring was to pay you for the <foreign><hi rend="italic">Nibelungen</hi></foreign>, which I trust he will forthwith do.&#x2014; I am labouring at <hi rend="italic">Teufel</hi> with considerable impetuosity and calculate that unless accidents intervene, I may be actually ready to get under way about the end of the month. But there will not be a minute to lose. I sometimes think the Book <hi rend="italic">will</hi> prove a kind of medicinal Assafoetida [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] for the pudding Stomach of England, and produce new secretions there. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Iacta est alea</hi></foreign> [The die is cast]<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Plutarch, <hi rend="italic">Parallel Lives</hi>, &#x201C;Caesar&#x201D;; Suetonius, <hi rend="italic">De Vita Caesarum</hi>, I, 32.

I have no other trade, no other strength, or portion in this Earth. Be it so.&#x2014; If you do not think Caroline street will answer (after what I wrote by the frank Letter), then look out for some other hole to hide us. But I explained my whole Lodging views already.&#x2014; You must write, and explain to me what you make or feel. Hourly you come into my head sitting in your lone cabin in that human chaos, with <foreign><hi rend="italic">mehr als ein schilling</hi></foreign> [more than one shilling], and bread and water for your dinner;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle echoes phrases in German from John#x2019;s letter of <date when="1831-07-07">7 July</date>.</note> and I cannot say but I respect you more and love you more than ever I did. Courage! Courage! <foreign><hi rend="italic">Tapferkeit</hi></foreign>, &#x201C;deliberate valour&#x201D; is God#x2019;s highest gift, and comes not without trial to any. Times will mend: or if Times never mend, then in the Devil#x2019;s name, let them stay as they are, or grow worse, and <hi rend="italic">we</hi> will mend.&#x2014; I know but one true wretchedness, the Want of Work (Want of Wages is comparatively trifling); which want, however, in such a world as this Planet of ours, <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> be permanent&#x2014;unless we continue blind therein. I will hear and understand all from you: then do our utmost to approximate the <hi rend="italic">best</hi>.

That it was sent off by John on <date when="1831-08-05">5 Aug.</date> is evident from <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310813-TC-G-01">TC to G, <date when="1831-08-13">13 Aug.</date></ref> Goethe recorded its arrival in his journal of <date when="1831-08-18">18 Aug.</date>, well before his birthday, <date when="1831-08-28">28 Aug.</date>, and wrote his thanks on <date when="1831-08-19">19 Aug.</date>; his friend Karl Zelter had heard about the gift earlier from a correspondent in London. For previous references which bear upon this gift, see <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310418-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1831-04-18">19 [18] April</date></ref>, <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310400-TCAO-FMA-01"><sic>TC and others: Proposal for a Tribute to G&#xF6;the</sic><corr>TCAO to G</corr>, [<date when="1831-04-00">early April</date>]</ref>, and <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310606-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1831-06-06">6 June</date></ref>.<lb/><lb/>
Both Carlyle#x2019;s footnote and the article in <hi rend="italic">Fraser#x2019;s</hi> describe the seal, but there is a more detailed description still in the <hi rend="italic">Athenaeum</hi>, <date when="1831-08-06">6 Aug. 1831</date>, p. 508. It was made by Messrs. Salter, Widowson and Tate of the Strand; it had a device of a star encircled with a serpent of eternity, and the motto from Goethe <foreign>OHNE HAST ABER OHNE RAST</foreign>; there was an elaborate setting of &#x201C;red and white roses &#x2026; emblematic of England&#x2014;above an owl#x2019;s head peeping from out the ivy&#x2014;a fine and boldly-carved satyr#x2019;s head&#x2014;and the whole surmounted by a rich bouquet representing the flowers of literature.&#x201D; Intertwined with the ivy branches was a &#x201C;gold belt&#x201D; with the inscription &#x201C;To the German Master: From Friends in England: <date when="1831-08-28">28th August: 1831</date>.&#x201D; The impression of the seal is illustrated in Ritchie, opp. p. 192. According to G. H. Lewes#x2019;s biography of Goethe, it was Jane, not Carlyle, who had sketched its design. It was on display in Goethe#x2019;s house in Weimar in <date when="1902-00-00">1902</date>&#x2013;<date when="1903-00-00">3</date>.<lb/><lb/>
According to an anonymous London correspondent of Karl Zelter (<hi rend="italic">Goethe#x2019;s Letters to Zelter</hi>, <date when="1887-00-00">1887</date>), the fifteen friends were: Carlyle, John Carlyle, William Fraser, William Maginn, John Abraham Heraud (<date when="1799-00-00">1799</date>&#x2013;<date when="1887-00-00">1887</date>, assistant on <hi rend="italic">Fraser#x2019;s</hi>), George Moir, James Churchill (translator of <hi rend="italic">Wallenstein#x2019;s Camp</hi>, published in <hi rend="italic">Fraser#x2019;s</hi>, II [<date when="1831-01-00">Jan. 1831</date>], 633&#x2013;65), William Jerdan (<date when="1782-00-00">1782</date>&#x2013;<date when="1869-00-00">1869</date>, contributor to <hi rend="italic">Fraser#x2019;s</hi> and editor of the <hi rend="italic">Literary Gazette</hi>), John Wilson, Sir Walter Scott, John Gibson Lockhart, Lord Francis Leveson-Gower, Robert Southey, William Wordsworth and Bryan Procter. The <hi rend="italic">Athenaeum</hi> adds a Mr. [Samuel?] Rodgers [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>]; Carlyle in his letter to his brother John of <date when="1831-07-17">17 July</date> notes that John has withdrawn. We may wonder why S. T. Coleridge was not one of those who signed the letter. Perhaps he could not make his contribution to the cost of the seal. John Wilson, one who did contribute and a man who impressed Carlyle immensely, spoke as &#x201C;Christopher North&#x201D; ironically of the seal and Carlyle in the &#x201C;Noctes Ambrosianae&#x201D; of <hi rend="italic">Blackwood#x2019;s Magazine</hi>, XXXI (<date when="1832-04-00">April 1832</date>), 693&#x2013;97:<lb/><lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Tickler:</hi> But oh! sir, the impudent stupidity of some of the subscribers to that Signet-Seal!<lb/><lb/>
<hi rend="italic">North:</hi> Hopeless of achieving mediocrity in any of the humbler walks of their native literature, the creatures expect to acquire character by acquaintance with the drivel of German dotage; and going at once to the fountain-head, gabble about Goethe. &#x201C;The Master!&#x201D; Yes&#x2014;and I beseech you, Hal, look at the flunkies. &#x2026; Thomas Carlisle [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>], my lads, has a soul that sees all that is good and great, beautiful and sublime, in the works of inspiration. And old Humbug, as you rightly call him, Tickler,&#x2014;Goethe,&#x2014;is, you know, a man of extraordinary genius. &#x2026;<lb/><lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Tickler:</hi> Now, why, pray, should any &#x201C;British man,&#x201D; with the devotion of a disciple, prefer making mental pilgrimages to Weimar, rather than to Stratford-upon-Avon?<lb/><lb/>
<hi rend="italic">North:</hi> With Thomas Carlisle obvious is the reason. Shakspeare has been long enthroned in instellation. The glory of Goethe is yet&#x2014;&#x2014; (p. 694)<lb/><lb/>
Norton quotes from Goethe#x2019;s letter to Zelter of <date when="1831-08-20">20 Aug.</date> telling of his pleasure in the gift: &#x201C;It reminds one of the descriptions in which Cellini is wont to extol his own achievements, and it is obvious that they have worked after the model of the sixteenth century. The English seem to think the saying, &#x2018;<foreign>Ohne Rast, doch ohne Hast</foreign>#x2019; [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] of considerable significance, and essentially it very well expresses their own mode of procedure. These words are engraved round a star, the well-known serpent encircling all, unfortunately in Old German Capitals, which do not bring out the sense quite clearly. It is a gift in every sense worthy of thanks, and I have written some friendly rhymes to them in return&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">GC</hi>, pp. 294&#x2013;95). The German original of this passage is in <foreign><hi rend="italic">Goethes Briefe</hi></foreign> (Weimar, <date when="1909-00-00">1909</date>), XLIX, 46&#x2013;47. The &#x201C;friendly rhymes&#x201D; were first published by Ottilie in <hi rend="italic">Chaos</hi> II (<date when="1831-00-00">1831</date>), vol. 6, p. 24, with the heading &#x201C;nineteen,&#x201D; and throughout the nineteenth century most German books on Goethe erroneously retained this number; the poem is published correctly in <foreign><hi rend="italic">Goethes Werke</hi></foreign> (Weimar, <date when="1891-00-00">1891</date>), IV, 303. It is given in German in Carlyle#x2019;s footnote to his essay &#x201C;Goethe#x2019;s Works&#x201D;; Norton translates it and gives, in addition, a translation of Goethe#x2019;s reply of <date when="1831-08-19">19 Aug.</date>:<lb/><lb/>
To the Fifteen English Friends<lb/><lb/>
The words the Poet speaks, swiftly and surely work within the compass of his land and home; yet knows he not if they do work afar. Britons, ye have understood! &#x201C;The active mind, the deed restrained: steadfast striving, without haste.&#x201D; And thus ye will that it be sealed.<lb/><lb/>
The verses were written in Goethe#x2019;s own hand. A short letter to Carlyle concerning them and other matters is translated by Norton (pp. 297&#x2013;98) as follows:<lb/><lb/>
The above I sent through Mr. Fraser of London, for the associated friends immediately after receiving their most charming gift. To you, my dearest Sir, I send this duplicate <supplied>[of the verses]</supplied>, which will perhaps reach you before that missive comes thence to you.<lb/><lb/>
I now merely add that I have already read here and there in the books and pamphlets which accompanied the gift, and that I find in them much that is delightful. Of this more next time, as well as of the silhouettes and the inconceivable way in which they bring the absent before one.<lb/><lb/>
The box, sent from Hamburg, through Messrs. Parish, at the end of <date when="1831-06-00">June</date>, is ere now, or will soon be, in your hands; let me have a word from you concerning it.<lb/><lb/>
I now repeat here, but in the fewest words: the gift of the associated friends has afforded me a pleasure as unusual as unexpected; and not me alone, but likewise friends and acquaintances, who know how to appreciate so artistic a piece of work.<lb/><lb/>
To the dear Pair, happy hours!<lb/><lb/>

<salute>Sir,</salute>
<p>Among the Friends whom this so interesting Anniversary calls round you, may we &#x2018;English Friends,#x2019; in thought and symbolically, <pb id="pg-05-306" n="05:306"/>since personally it is impossible, present ourselves, to offer you our affectionate congratulations. We hope you will do us the honour to accept this little Birthday Gift; which as a true testimony of our feelings, may not be without value.</p>
<p>We said to ourselves: &#x2018;As it is always the highest duty and pleasure to shew reverence to whom reverence is due, and our chief, perhaps our only Benefactor is he who by act and word, instructs us in Wisdom; so we, undersigned, feeling towards the Poet Goethe as the spiritually-taught towards their spiritual Teacher, are desirous to express that sentiment openly and in common. For which end we have determined to solicit his acceptance of a small English Gift, proceeding from us all equally, on his approaching Birthday; that so, while the venerable Man still dwells among us, some memorial of the gratitude we owe him, and think the whole world owes him, may not be wanting.#x2019;</p>
<p>And thus our little tribute, perhaps among the purest that men could offer to man, now stands in visible shape, and begs to be received&#x2014; May it be welcome, and speak permanently of a most close relation, tho#x2019; wide seas flow between the parties!</p>
<p><closer><salute>We pray that many years may be added to a life so glorious; that all happiness may be yours, and strength given to complete your high task, even as it has hitherto proceeded, &#x2018;like a star, without haste, yet without rest.#x2019;</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My Dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Will you be content with the shortest Letter I ever wrote you? For, literally, I have not, these some weeks, had any half minute of deliberate time.</p>
<p>My Book is drawing to a close, and I must be off to London by <hi rend="italic">the end of the month</hi> (Jack says)&#x2014;of which month there are now <hi rend="italic">eleven days</hi> remaining! Thus you see how I am hurried; and work what is in me, and almost more.</p>
<p>Nevertheless it shall go hard but I will <hi rend="italic">see</hi> you before I go. I hope the writing will be pretty well over by perhaps the middle of next week; after which I will set about harnessing the old Gig, and drive off&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">if</hi> I am done; and can get a horse, for Harry will not ride yet, for blister-wounds. You may partially expect me then next week: if I <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> come, I will write on Wednesday. But be sure that it will be close on the verge of an <hi rend="italic">absolute impossibility</hi> (which I do not anticipate), <pb id="pg-05-309" n="05:309"/>if I do not come sometime before setting out. On Wednesday next, then, you will get a Letter; or get none&#x2014;which you will like better.&#x2014; Jane talks of coming with me; wishing to see &#x201C;all of me that she can.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, dear Mother, understand that we are all on foot, in the old way; no broken hearts or bones among us. Alick is busy with his potatoes&#x2014;ploughing (the second time): I heard him gee-hoe-ing in his Cattle, not long ago. Jenny labours within doors, and without as it may chance: is always cheerful-looking, but (to us ward) highly incommunicative.</p>
<p>Jane is complaining somewhat of her old ailments: the summer weather never agrees well with her.</p>
<p>Jack is to take Lodgings for me and him in London. He <hi rend="italic">has</hi> had an interview with Jeffrey, and seems to have behaved <hi rend="italic">well</hi>, even nobly. He is not without money for his wants: and is to wait till I see him before he resolve on what is to be done. I rather conjecture this training he is getting in London will teach him more than he has ever learnt elsewhere. I have great confidence in him: neither is he now without help. Jeffrey thinks well of him, and that employment may be got: but &#x201C;we must have patience!&#x201D;</p>
<p>How are <hi rend="italic">you</hi> all? Yourself, my Father, and all the Branches? It is in vain to ask; for there is none to answer me, but the <hi rend="italic">Echo</hi>. I will hope and pray for the best; and hasten down to <hi rend="italic">see</hi>.</p>
<p>Here then I end.&#x2014; I forgot to say that I was <supplied>[not]</supplied> at all in a bad way of health: very high in the humour, and defiant both of the Devil and the World. I think I have look<supplied>[e]</supplied>d into the <hi rend="italic">worst</hi> that is in them both; and, thro#x2019; God#x2019;s grace, no longer fear it.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. the end of &#x201C;The Everlasting No&#x201D; in Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi>, pp. 166&#x2013;68.</note> Our misery is even as you say, when God hides himself; there <hi rend="italic">is</hi> no other misery.</p>
<p><closer><salute>Good Night, my dear Mother! May He, thro#x2019; whom, and in whom we all are, ever guide us all; and grant us <hi rend="italic">this</hi> only; <hi rend="italic">Submission to Him</hi>, which is the beginning and end of good! Amen!</salute></closer></p>

<dateline><place>Dumfries</place>, <date when="1831-08-01">1st August, 1831</date>&#x2014;</dateline>
<salute>My Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I return you many thanks for your kind answer<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Napier wrote in his letter to Carlyle of <date when="1831-07-28">28 July</date>:
<p>&#x201C;On my return from London, where I have been for several weeks, I found your letter of the <date when="1831-07-12">12th</date>, and I lose no time in saying that I shall have great pleasure in giving you a letter of introduction to Longman Rees &#x26; Coy, the only London Booksellers with whom I have any <hi rend="italic">particular</hi> connection. Mr Murray is the only other publisher likely to be of use to you, and to him Jeffrey (the L<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Advocate) can with ease give you a Note. I must tell you, however, that you could not go to London at a more unpropitious period for the disposal of literary wares. The trade in Books is at a very low ebb, so low, that I almost despair of your success at present. Longman &#x26; Coy are by far the most stable men in the trade, but they tell me there is no sale for books&#x2014;nothing but periodicals &#x26; <hi rend="italic">cheap</hi> publications being looked at&#x2014;and, that they are resolved to save their capital till better times shall return to us.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I ought before this to have remitted you for your very valuable, &#x26; much approved article on Taylor, and am sorry that this duty had escaped me, in the hurry occasioned by the necessary preparations for my London journey. There are thirty five guineas, that is, &#xa3;36.15 / at your disposal, and which I shall pay in any way you please to direct. Will it serve your purpose to get a Bill on London for the sum? or shall I pay it into any bank here for your behoof? A Bill on London will enable you to get the amount at any Banker<supplied>[#x2019;]</supplied>s in Dumfries. Give me your directions as to this, &#x26; the Letter to Longman &#x26; Coy, and they shall immediately be attended to. I fear you are giving reviews to works less worthy of them than my partiality makes me think the <hi rend="italic">Ed</hi><supplied>[<hi rend="italic">inburgh Review</hi>]</supplied> to be.&#x201D;</p></note> to my Letter. If you will be so good as inclose me that introductory Note to the Messrs Longman (to my Brother#x2019;s address, 16. Caroline Street Bedford Square, London), under cover to the Lord Advocate (37. Jermyn Street), it will be in London shortly after my arrival there; for I do not set out till Thursday.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1831-08-04">4 Aug.</date></note></p>
<p>Our little money concern can be settled quite conveniently by a Bill transmitted hither, or by a Bill drawn here on you; either of which will produce its effect in any of our Banks. I will attend to it on my return.</p>
<p>The last sentence of your Letter causes me some surprise and likewise some gratification. If I rightly interpret it in the sense of an expostulation, and little friendly reproach, there must be some game at cross-purposes going on between us, which perhaps a few words of plain speech might put an end to. I have no hesitation, for my own part, in stating what is simply a literal historical fact, that there is no Periodical now extant in Britain which I should so willingly write <pb id="pg-05-311" n="05:311"/>for, and publish <hi rend="italic">all</hi> my Essayist Lucubrations in as the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review</hi>. If you really want me to preach in your Pulpit, therefore, you have only to say so.</p>
<p>On the other hand I am a person that, in all senses of the word, live by writing: and if one honest man seems to have no need of my produce, what can I do but travel on with it till I find another that does? Had I so much as faintly conjectured that the Essay on the <foreign><hi rend="italic">Nibelungen Lied</hi></foreign> would have been acceptable to you, then to you first should it have been offered. The like I may say of another long Paper on a similar subject,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;German Literature of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Centuries,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Foreign Quarterly Review</hi>, VIII (<date when="1831-10-00">Oct. 1831</date>), 347&#x2013;91.</note> which is now also disposed of far less to my mind. But you may remember I mentioned several subjects in my last Letter but one; for example, Boswell<supplied>[#x2019;]</supplied>s Johnson, which work I had (and in that shape or another still have) something to say on; at all events which I requested a loan of to read. Not hearing from you in reply, what was I to fancy but that my way of thinking and my somewhat emphatic way of expressing it was judged questionable in a Review now almost demi-official; and that you took the politest method of signifying this to me without offence? To me it seemed, for what I could know, highly natural on your part, and you may believe me was taken in the friendliest spirit. And now if I was wrong, here is the ground open for a remedy! I have spoke<supplied>[n]</supplied> with the most perfect sincerity; and beg you to understand quite clearly that if I can publish my Thoughts (and I have nothing else worth publishing) in your Journal, so honourable in itself, so endeared to me by accidental causes, then am I readier to publish them <hi rend="italic">there</hi> than <hi rend="italic">any</hi>where else<supplied>[.]</supplied></p>
<p>You must thank Sir W. Hamilton (to whom I ascribe it) for that highly valuable Paper on <hi rend="italic">Oxford</hi>.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Universities of England&#x2014;Oxford,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review</hi>, LIII (<date when="1831-06-00">June 1831</date>), 384&#x2013;427.</note> It is a subject that cries aloud for rectification. The English Universities and indeed the British are a scandal to this century. The tone of that paper is exactly what it should be, quiet, but deep deliberate unalterable.</p>
<p><closer><salute>I write in very great haste, while I am in the neighbourhood of Post Offices;&#x2014;and remain always, / My Dear Sir, / Faithfully Your#x2019;s,</salute></closer></p>
<p><name>Thomas Carlyle&#x2014;</name><note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Napier replied promptly on <date when="1831-08-04">4 Aug.</date>: &#x201C;The accompanying Note to Mr Rees is written in as strong terms of recommendation as I can fairly address to him &#x26; his partners. If Mr Rees sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be from home, be so good as say that the Note is from me, &#x26; is equally intended for Mr Longman, &#x26; the other partners of the house.<lb/><lb/>
&#x201C;I ought to have written, on receiving your letter in regard to Croker<supplied>[#x2019;]</supplied>s edition of Boswell<supplied>[#x2019;]</supplied>s Johnson, to say, that soon after the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> announcement of the work, I had agreed to put it into the hands of a distinguished friend, who is now, I hope, at work upon it. My reason for not writing, I suppose was, that the Book had not appeared at the time I received your letter. Indeed, it was not published till after my arrival in London, <date when="1831-07-00">beginning of July</date>.<lb/><lb/>
&#x201C;I shall be truly happy to learn that your schemes of publication are successful.&#x201D; For Owen Rees, see <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310824-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1831-08-24">24 Aug.</date></ref><lb/><lb/>

<p>So you are really gone!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle had left on <date when="1831-08-04">4 Aug.</date> at 2 <hi rend="small-caps">a.m.</hi>, when Alick had driven him (as recorded in <hi rend="italic">Two Note Books</hi>, p. 191) to Glencaple, five miles beyond Dumfries, where via Whitehaven he embarked for Liverpool, landing there at 7:30 <hi rend="small-caps">a.m.</hi> the next day.</note> and I&#x2014;<foreign>ich bin allein</foreign> [I am alone]! every instant I feel this; yet I am not so miserable as might be supposed&#x2014;at least not more miserable <hi rend="italic">here</hi> than I should be in any other place where you were not. It would be infinitely worse to be obliged to make the agreeable among people whom I was all the while wishing annihilated&#x2014;as I should be constrained (notwithstanding my true tho#x2019; perhaps feeble attachment to my species) to wish, with hardly any exception all creatures of the human kind that &#x2018;obtruded#x2019; themselves on me in my present humour. As it is, Heaven be thanked I have ample room and verge enough<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Gray, &#x201C;The Bard,&#x201D; l. 52.</note> to ray forth darkness; and to meditate on &#x2018;the mill of death#x2019;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi>, p. 164, where Harrold notes the phrase as a literal translation of Novalis#x2019;s &#x201C;<foreign>eine furchtbare M&#xfc;hle des Todes</foreign>.&#x201D;</note> or &#x2018;the monstrous twelve yards long puddings in our insides#x2019;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-02/lt-18220519-TC-JAC-01"><sic>2:111&#x2013;12</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1822-05-19">19 May 1822</date></corr></ref>, where Carlyle describes how John Waugh disembowelled a dead porpoise, and examined and measured its &#x201C;mid-riffs &#x26; puddings.&#x201D;</note> or any other earthly or unearthly topics that seems good to me, without the smallest interruption.</p>
<p>I went to bed when the sound of your wheels could no longer be heard; and cried myself into a troubled sleep. The first thing that met my eyes on waking was your night cap lying on my pillow; whereupon I fell a-crying anew, and actually kissed it I believe, tho#x2019; you know I hate <hi rend="italic">red</hi> nightcaps. New trials awaited me when I got out of bed and found some article of your dress in all parts of the room: but the worst of all was when I sat down to breakfast, and noticed the <hi rend="italic">one</hi> cup and <hi rend="italic">one</hi> everything, and thought how long <hi rend="italic">this</hi> must last. My heart <pb id="pg-05-313" n="05:313"/>was nearly failing me altogether; my <hi rend="italic">head did</hi> fail me&#x2014;and the whole of that day and part of the following, I had to keep my bed. Fate seemed minded to spare me the trouble of seeking myself employment in your absence. To day I am in my usual middle state&#x2014;and have been going about &#x2018;siding things#x2019; as they say in Liverpool&#x2014;in East lothian dialect, &#x2018;<foreign>redding up</foreign> <supplied>[thoroughly cleaning]</supplied>#x2019; or in your &#x2018;brief and energetic#x2019; dialect &#x2018;making an earthquake.#x2019; And now my house is all in order (&#x2018;<hi rend="italic">swept and garnished</hi>#x2019;) and tea has been made <hi rend="italic">for some hours</hi> for Jemmy<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle#x2019;s brother James.</note> who is late (it is near eleven) I may mention further that Harry<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The horse which had almost died during the epidemic; &#x201C;tar&#x201D; here is a kind of salve.</note> has got his sides tarred; and that old Mary<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mary Mills, a servant brought over from Templand.</note> has found a nest of twelve turkey eggs&#x2014;which I could have broken, in spite that they were not put in the canister.

<p>Monday [<date when="1831-08-08">8 August</date>]&#x2014; Jemmy did not appear on Saturday&#x2014;I sat up for him till twelve. Yesterday was my worst day since you went. A <hi rend="italic">betterish</hi> dinner having been prepared for Jemmy I thoughtlessly&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">madly</hi> I should say&#x2014;invited Alick and Jenny.

<salute>Dearest and Wife,</salute>
<p>I have got a frank for you, and will write from the heart whatever is in the heart. A blessing it was that you made me give such a promise; for I feel that an hour spent in speaking with my own will do me infinite good. It is very sweet in the midst of this soul-confusing phantasmagoria to know that I have a fixed possession elsewhere; that my own Jeannie is thinking of me, loving me, that her heart is no dream like all the rest of it. O love me, my Dearest, always love me! I am richer with thee than the whole world could make me otherwise.</p>
<p>But to the Practical. Expect no connected or even intelligible narrative of all the chaotic sights, sounds, movements countermovements I have experienced since your lips parted from mine on our own threshold; still less of all the hyper-chaotic feelings that have danced their wild torch-dance within me: I have not time for it; and shall find long winter nights enough to go thro#x2019; it all. For the present I must content myself like Sir W. Hamilton with &#x2018;stating a fact or two.#x2019;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18200603-TC-JOFE-01"><sic>1:258</sic><corr>TC to JOFE, <date when="1820-06-03">3 June 1820</date></corr></ref>. Probably a stock phrase of Sir William Hamilton#x2019;s in lecturing conversation and writing. He falls into it in the article on &#x201C;Universities of England-Oxford,&#x201D; in the <date when="1831-06-00">June</date> <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review</hi>, where he writes: &#x201C;consider the state of the University, both as established in law, but non-existent in fact, and as established in fact, but non-existent in law&#x201D; (p. 385).</note> Understand then, Goodykin, that after infinite confusions I arrived at Liverpool about eight o#x2019;clock on the morning after I left you:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Friday, <date when="1831-08-05">5 Aug.</date> On arrival at Liverpool Carlyle went at once to the house of Jane#x2019;s maternal uncle John Welsh, a merchant; see <ref target="volume-01/lt-18201014-JBW-EA-01"><sic>1:281</sic><corr>JBW to EA, <date when="1820-10-14">14 Oct. 1820</date></corr></ref>.

The Maryland Street people were not up but soon rose and received me well. Delightful it was to get into a room and&#x2014;have my face washed; and then on opening my trunk, to find everywhere traces of my kind good <hi rend="italic">Coagitor#x2019;s</hi> care and love: the very jujube-box with its worsted and darning-needle did not escape me; it was so beautiful I could almost have cried over it.

If I were there I would kiss thee fondly, and whisper that thou wert mine forever.&#x2014; John Welsh was the same substantial honest fellow whom we have always known him: he is close prisoner in the house till dusk when he ventures out a little.

The Auntie was loud, talkative, argumentative, infinitely bustling, but also very assiduous in showing me kindness. To make a long tale short I left them on monday morning at half past seven, with many blessings; and two cups of sufficient coffee which the good housewife would not be prevented from making me at that early hour.</p>
<p>Which last hospitality I may well say was doubly blest; for it so turned out that this was the last <supplied>[Carlyle writes &#x201C;only&#x201D; above &#x201C;last&#x201D;]</supplied> refection I received till my arrival at London on the following day about ten o#x2019;clock!<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle left on Monday the <date when="1831-08-09">9th</date>, and traveled by coach through Chester, Wolverhampton, Birmingham, Stratford and Oxford (3 <hi rend="small-caps">a.m.</hi> on the <date when="1831-08-10">10th</date>); thence via &#x201C;Henley, Maidenhead &#x26;c&#x201D; arriving &#x201C;full of sulphur, at the Wh<supplied>[ite]</supplied> Horse Cellar, Piccadilly,&#x201D; getting to John#x2019;s lodgings at 10:30 <hi rend="small-caps">a.m.</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Two Note Books</hi>, p. 193). John was waiting at the Angel, Islington.</note> I must except a penny-loaf snatched from the Landlady of an inn in Shropshire; and a cup of hot sugar-and-water (as the <hi rend="italic">whole time</hi> proved only 15 minutes) for which I had the pleasure of paying half a crown in the village of Birmingham. How all this happened, and I was sent circulating over the whole West of England, set my Watch by the Shrewsbury clock, and saw portions of Wales; and had the delightfullest drive, only no victual or knowledge by what route I was bound: all this depended on the Art of the Liverpool Coach Agents, at which villainous as it was I could not help laughing horselaughs when after leaving Birmingham I came to see into the mystery. There are men in Liverpool who will <hi rend="italic">book</hi> you to go by any Coach you like, and to enter London at any place and any hour you like; and then <hi rend="italic">send</hi> you thither by any Coach or combination <pb id="pg-05-318" n="05:318"/>of Coaches <hi rend="italic">they</hi> like. I was booked for a certain imaginary Tallyho, went by <hi rend="italic">seven</hi> successive vehicles, none of which had that name, and entered London three hours later and by quite the opposite side than I had appointed John to wait at. Sulphurous enough! However, now I have had sleep and am well. The only mischief done was the <hi rend="italic">breakage of the Eggs;</hi> which however the Washerwoman has now made good again: so do not gri<supplied>[e]</supplied>ve thyself Dearest; the broken eggs are dearer to me than the whole would have been; there is a <hi rend="italic">pathos</hi> in them, and I love Jeannie more.</p>
<p>With little difficulty I conveyed myself and luggage to Jack#x2019;s old Lodgings and there learned his actual address; at no great distance; and, to my astonishment, in the upper floor of George Irving#x2019;s house, who also lets lodgings. It is a very beautiful sitting room, an immense bedroom above (and John sleeps with George) for which we are to pay 25/ weekly. Quiet and airy and among known people, all is right in this respect.</p>
<p>The first day I did little; yet walked over to the Duke#x2019;s<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jeffrey#x2019;s.</note> (for Napier#x2019;s Letter) found him out and left my card, with a promise for next morning. (It is between two and three miles from this). On arriving there, I was asked my name, and then instantly ushered in; and welcomed in their choicest mood by the whole family. A Doctor Baron was there (the same as I afterwards understood whom I had written to at Glo#x2019;ster about Eichthal#x2019;s Cowpox matter):<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Baron, M.D. (<date when="1786-00-00">1786</date>&#x2013;<date when="1851-00-00">1851</date>) of Gloucester, the friend and biographer of Edward Jenner, was also the friend of Dr. Matthew Baillie and the author of three books on tuberculosis.</note> Mrs Jeffrey was as kind as ever; Charlotte too came simpering in, and looked as if she would let me live. The Advocate retired and reentered with your picture (glorious moment! cries the female character) which was shown round: for little I could have <foreign><hi rend="italic">grat</hi></foreign> [wept] over it. After a time by some movements I got the company dispersed and the Advocate by himself, and began to take counsel with him about <hi rend="italic">Teufelsdreck</hi>. He tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Murray (in spite of the radicalism) would be the better publisher; to him accordingly he gave me a line saying that I was a genius and would likely become eminent; farther that he (Jeffrey) would like well to confer with him about that Book. I directly set off with this to Albemarle Street; found Murray <hi rend="italic">out;</hi> returned afterwards and found him <hi rend="italic">in</hi>, gave an outline of the Book (at which the Arimaspian<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Herodotus tells of the one-eyed Arimaspians who were neighbors of gold-guarding griffins on the Tibetan plateau. Murray had only one good eye. See <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310817-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1831-08-17">17 Aug.</date></ref></note> <pb id="pg-05-319" n="05:319"/>smiled), stated also that I had nothing else ado here but the getting of it published, and was above all anxious that his decision should be given soon. He answered that we would begin this very afternoon; that on Wednesday next he would give me an answer. I then went off; despatched my <hi rend="italic">Teuf</hi>k with <hi rend="italic">your</hi> tape round him; agreeing to all their stipulations: on Wednesday I am to go there and get an answer of my <hi rend="italic">Ms.</hi>&#x2014; Of the probable issue I can form no conjecture: only Murray seemed to know me; and I daresay is very anxious to keep well with Ministry, so will risk what he dare.&#x2014; I will see the Duke again ere long.</p>
<p>Napier#x2019;s Letter also is come, with a Note to Rees, which I think I shall perhaps not deliver (perhaps too I may) till after next Wednesday. The Nas<supplied>[o]</supplied> has also a Note, still more enigmatic than the former; explains that <hi rend="italic">Johnson</hi> was given to &#x2018;a distinguished#x2019; &#x26;c long ago, apologizes, wishes &#x26;c; but nowhere says in so many words whether he wishes me to write to him or not. I will show it to the Duke; and see it brought to some sort of bearing. For the rest I care not a snuff for Naso.</p>
<p>Badams called here an hour after I came; he brought his wife next day; I was out, but saw them in the eve<supplied>[n]</supplied>ing. She is a good woman and goodlooking whom I think you will like: <hi rend="italic">he</hi> is in no good way I doubt, yet not without hope. I have also seen Mrs Montague; talked longer with her than I shall speedily do again: for she seems to me embittered and exasperated; and what have I to do with her quarrels? Jack she seems positively to have cut: because he would not turn with her in a day from transcendental apotheosis of Badams, to excommunication. &#x2018;All things go round and round.#x2019; For me, as I told her, I would continue to love all parties and pity all, and hate or quarrel with none.&#x2014;</p>
<p>Alas dearest the hour is come, and I finish while but beginning O write, write. I feel great want of your &#x2018;prophetic faculty#x2019;;<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly what Carlyle calls her &#x201C;Shuping Sing&#x201D; faculty, named after a Chinese character in a novel who could see &#x201C;almost through millstones.&#x201D; Or the whole joke about a &#x201C;prophetic faculty&#x201D; may also have been meant to be on Irving and his belief in &#x201C;prophecy.&#x201D;</note> how safe I should feel in your bosom, safe, safe, and at home. However, I will do what I can to get soon back, and with an olive leaf&#x2014;</p>
<p>Of Jack I have said nothing. He is as I expected, and perhaps better: looks unhappy, is <hi rend="italic">greyish-haired:</hi> I am very <foreign>wae</foreign> for him, and have scolded and advised: something must and will be <hi rend="italic">done</hi>.</p>
<p>Another thing dearest I must ask you to do: to write a little Note to <pb id="pg-05-320" n="05:320"/>my Mother on Wednesday first to tell her that I am arrived, and what I have told you here. Say also that I will write myself, by the next frank<supplied>[.]</supplied> Do this, my Love: I meant to write today, but absolutely could not get away from Mrs Montague#x2019;s catalogue raisonnee of Badamiana&#x2014;</p>
<p>O why have I not a word that will express what I feel! <closer><salute>Believe always that you are inexpressibly dear to me.</salute></closer></p>
<closer><salute>I am forever / Your Husband /</salute></closer>
<name>T. Carlyle</name>
<ps><p>Jack stands <hi rend="italic">glowering o#x2019;er me</hi>, urging me as you know is his wont. Tell Alick all my news; read him the Letter (so much of it as you can read); and give to every one my kindest brotherly love.</p>
<p>&#x201C;There is no time to read it over I believe,&#x201D; murmurs the Doctor: so away it must go. Good Night my own! May God always bless you.</p></ps>

<p>O what a day was yesterday! what a breaking in upon my still existence! what a foolish tasteless racket! All the earth seemed to have broken loose. At half after <hi rend="italic">five</hi>, lying awake (as is my wont)&#x2014;the morning misty and dark&#x2014;I heard the most inexplicable sound&#x2014;a jingling of wheels, not cart wheels evidently, and it seemed too slow for a chaise or gig. I could compare it to nothing but the sound of a hearse&#x2014;I rung and inquired what in all the world was <hi rend="italic">that</hi> at this hour in the morning&#x2014; &#x201C;It is M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Fyffe Mam&#x2014;the Brewer from Dumfries&#x2014;he is going to fish in the Ore [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] and wants to leave his horse and gig here&#x2014;for he was sure you would not object upon the account of his Brother&#x201D;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably the brother was Dr. Alexander Fyffe of Haddington, Jane#x2019;s former suitor.</note>&#x2014; &#x201C;Does he want any breakfast too upon the same account? <pb id="pg-05-322" n="05:322"/>tell him he may stay or come back<supplied>[.]</supplied>&#x201D; And Betty went off to ask, grieving that I should have been disturbed&#x2014;&#x201C;but <hi rend="italic">I</hi> could not help it Mam I took him for&#x2014;not just a walking drover&#x2014;but some <hi rend="italic">tops man</hi><note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >An overseer or servant in charge, as of a drove of cattle.</note> and sent out old Mary to tell that lad to drive slow past the house end for fear of waking M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle&#x201D;&#x2014; She brought back for answer that he was in pressing haste but would be back for the horse and gig at one o#x2019;clock&#x2014; &#x201C;And it is such a morning with midges mam as you never felt&#x2014; She (the cow) is quite beside herself with them&#x2014;and <hi rend="italic">Mr</hi> Fyffe says he could not live here a month, that he is like to be eaten up&#x201D;&#x2014; &#x201C;Nobody wants him to live here an hour&#x2014;and if he is eaten up so much the better&#x201D;&#x2014; And I rose forthwith in a sort of flurry&#x2014;baked some scones &#x26;c &#x26;c&#x2014;and was proceeding to dress myself when a change came oer the Spirit of my dream<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-04/lt-18260221-JBW-TC-01"><sic>4:38</sic><corr>JBW to TC, <date when="1826-02-21">21 Feb. 1826</date></corr></ref>.</note> and I was put to bed in a faint&#x2014; It was now between eight and nine.

Such a creature! shaped like one of his own beer barrels&#x2014;and not altogether sane it struck me&#x2014;but he had breakfasted at a farm house and I was soon to be rid of him. He proceeded to yoke his gig and I walked out to Alick in the Garden&#x2014;to whom Mary Mills<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Old Mary,&#x201D; the servant.</note> had allowed no rest that morning&#x2014;making noises before his door and imploring him by all the saints to &#x201C;come and give the borders a <foreign>wee</foreign> rake before M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Welsh saw <hi rend="italic">the wark</hi>.&#x201D; Presently the chaise was heard coming and the gig was just ready to depart&#x2014; &#x201C;Now Heaven help me cried I<supplied>[,]</supplied>I am a lost woman&#x2014;my reputation is gone there will they meet that man in the avenue and take him for some lover I am dispatching out of the way&#x201D;&#x2014; &#x201C;Never <foreign>fash</foreign> [vex] yeerself Mem&#x201D; says Mary &#x201C;I can testify that I saw him wi my ain een come here after five oclock&#x2014;&#x201D; And now out stepped Isabella with smiling comely face&#x2014;and out stepped my Mother apparently <hi rend="italic">highly excited</hi>&#x2014;and lastly to my no small surprise was revealed the long figure of Robert Barker.<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably a relative of the Lieutenant Barker of <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310606-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1831-06-06">6 June</date></ref>.</note> We kissed (the women that is) and gig<supplied>[g]</supplied>led and looked prodigiously glad, and at length got seated at Breakfast.

<p>Since five this morning I have been reading Meister the only Book besides Teufelsdreck and the Bible which I mean to keep always by me&#x2014; At half after two the post comes in and then I shall have your letter for I directed it to be forwarded hither&#x2014; Would it were come!</p>

<salute>My much honoured Friend,</salute>
<p>I send you a word of remembrance from this chaotic whirlpool of a City, where I arrived three days ago; where the confusion in which I and all things are carried round must be my excuse for brevity and almost unintelligibility. Often do I recal to myself that saying of poor Panthalis in <hi rend="italic">Helena</hi>, &#x201C;the soul-confusing spell of the Thessalian Hag,&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <hi rend="italic">Faust II</hi>, l. 9963. Carlyle knew the phrase, not from <hi rend="italic">Faust II</hi> which was not published until after Goethe#x2019;s death, but from <hi rend="italic">Helena</hi>, the fragment of <hi rend="italic">Faust II</hi> which Goethe published in <date when="1827-00-00">1827</date> in vol. 4 of the &#x201C;complete and final&#x201D; edition of his collected works. It is the subject of Carlyle#x2019;s review article &#x201C;Goethe#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Helena</hi>&#x201D; in the <date when="1828-04-00">April 1828</date> number of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Review</hi>. Panthalis is the leader of the chorus. The &#x201C;Thessalian Hag&#x201D; is Phorkyas.</note> and feel as if I too were a shade; for in truth this London Life looks more like a Mephistopheles#x2019; Walpurgis Night<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The twenty-third scene of <hi rend="italic">Faust I</hi>. Walpurgis Night is the night before 1 May, when according to German superstition witches ride to meet on the Brocken, highest of the Harz mountains.</note> than a real Heaven-encircled Day, where God#x2019;s kind Sun were shining peaceably on industrious men.</p>
<p>Our last two Letters must have crossed each other about Rotterdam; for your#x2019;s was in Craigenputtoch about a week before mine could be in Weimar. A thousand thanks for your remembrance of us! Never was letter more gladly welcomed: it reached us in the calm summer twilight, and was itself so calm and pure, even like the summer Evening, with mild sun-rays and the sheen of an everlasting Morning already peering thro#x2019;. Endless gratitude I owe you; for it is by you that <pb id="pg-05-326" n="05:326"/>I have learned what worth there is in man for his brother man; and how the &#x201C;open secret,&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Goethe, <hi rend="italic">Maximen und Reflexionen</hi>, no. 201, though Goethe twice uses &#x201C;open secret&#x201D; in <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meisters Wanderjahre</hi> and elsewhere. Cf. the passage in <hi rend="italic">Heroes and Hero-worship</hi>, in <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, V, 80, where Carlyle explicitly relates Goethe#x2019;s concept to Fichte#x2019;s of the &#x201C;Divine Idea of the World.&#x201D; For discussion, see C. F. Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle and German Thought: <date when="1819-00-00">1819</date>&#x2013;<date when="1834-00-00">1834</date></hi> (New Haven, Conn., <date when="1934-00-00">1934</date>), pp. 116&#x2013;19.</note> tho#x2019; the most are blind to it, is still open for whoso has an eye.</p>
<p>Since then, two things have occurred which I must now notify. The first is the departure of a little Packet from Craigenputtoch which had to go round by London, and lie waiting there; but was finally put to sea by my Brother, on the <date when="1831-08-05">5<hi rend="italic">th</hi> of this Month</date>, with impressive charges to the Messrs Parish of Hamburg that they would have it in Weimar before your Birthday.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Parish &#x26; Co. wrote to Carlyle on <date when="1831-08-12">12 Aug.</date> to say that the packet had been received and that it had been forwarded to Goethe, who received it on <date when="1831-08-18">18 Aug.</date></note> As it went by the Steam-ship, and our Hamburg Merchants are the most courteous and punctual of men, I can still hope that, in spite of so many delays, all will be well. The Craigenputtoch articles were insignificant enough, and might arrive fitly at any time: solely some Books, and printed Lucubrations of mine, which I hoped might not be quite uninteresting to you. But along with these, went another Article, from others as well as from myself, the significance of which required that you should see it on the <date when="1831-08-28">28<hi rend="italic">th</hi> of August</date>. It is a Birthday Gift from a certain select body of English Disciples, who in this way seek to testify their veneration for you. Perhaps to make the feeling still purer, I find, they have withheld their names, and merely signed themselves &#x2018;Fifteen English Friends#x2019;: I may mention now that among our number are some of our most noted men, our three highest Poets, certain Diplomatic characters, and men of rank, as well as humbler but not less faithful and honourable labourers in the vineyard. Let me hope that it will arrive in due season; and the sight of it give you some gratifying moments.</p>
<p>My second thing to be announced is the arrival of your Weimar Packet at Craigenputtoch. I could not but take it as a good omen of my journey hither that this friendliest of Messengers reached me some two hours prior to my departure. A hasty glance thro#x2019; the Contents was all that could be permitted me: I must leave my Wife to assort and admire those printed Poems and beautiful <foreign><hi rend="italic">Randzeichnungen</hi></foreign>,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Neureuther#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Marginal Drawings</hi>. See <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310806-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, <date when="1831-08-06">6 Aug.</date></ref></note> in her mountain loneliness, as I find yesterday, by a Letter from her, she is actually doing. For my own part, I snatched up the <hi rend="italic">Metamorphosis <pb id="pg-05-327" n="05:327"/>of Plants</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Schiller Redivivus</hi><note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Goethe, translated by F. Soret, <hi rend="italic">Essai sur la m&#xE9;tamorphose des plantes</hi> (Stuttgart, <date when="1831-00-00">1831</date>); <hi rend="italic">Schiller Redivivus</hi> was evidently the handsomely-bound copy of Carlyle#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Leben Schillers</hi> (Frankfurt, <date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>), sent by Goethe as a present to Jane.</note> with intent to read them as the Steamboat shot along with me to Liverpool, whither the first stage of my journey lay. In a calmer hour, a more deliberate word may be spoken of them.</p>
<p>I have come hither chiefly to dispose of the Piece which I lately described myself as writing. Whether or how well I shall succeed seems questionable: for the whole world here is dancing a Tarantula Dance of Political Reform, and has no ear left for Literature. Nevertheless I shall do my utmost to get the Work which was meant to be a &#x2018;word spo<supplied>[ken]</supplied> in season,#x2019;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Proverbs 15:23.</note> actually emitted: at lowest I shall ascertain that it cannot be emitted, and study to do what duty that situation also will call for.</p>
<p>Probably I shall be here for a month. On returning to the Scottish wilderness, you shall hear from me again. Meanwhile figure me and mine as thinking of you, loving you; as present especially on that 28<hi rend="italic">th</hi> with wishes as warm as loving hearts can feel. Salute Ottilie from my Wife and me. Think sometimes of those that are yours in this Island, especially among the Nithsdale Mountains. <closer><salute>All Good be yours always!</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My own Dearest,</salute>
<p>Your kind precious Letter came to me on Friday, like a cup of water in the hot desart. It is all like yourself: so clear, precise loving, and true to the death. I <hi rend="italic">see</hi> poor Craigenputtoch thro#x2019; it, and the best little Goodykin sitting there, hourly meditating on me, and watching my return. Oh I am very rich, were I without a penny in the world!&#x2014; But the <foreign>Herzens</foreign>-Goody must not fret herself, and torment her poor sick head: I will be back to her, not an hour will I lose: Heaven knows the sun shines not on the spot that could be pleasant to me where she were not. So be of comfort, my Jeannie; and with thy own sweet orderly <pb id="pg-05-328" n="05:328"/>spirit make calmness out of confusion, and the dawn (as it does in summer climates) to shine thro#x2019; the whole Night, till it be morning, and the &#x2018;Sun#x2019; once more embrace his fair kind Earth.&#x2014; For the rest thou canst not be too &#x2018;Theresa-like#x2019;:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310806-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, <date when="1831-08-06">6 Aug.</date></ref></note> it is this very fidelity to practical Nature that makes the charm of the picture; write <hi rend="italic">every</hi> thing (every Tuesday and Saturday), and I will answer in kind. Be loving to the red-nightcap, till the head come back to fill it, and lie again on the bosom where is its home. Oh it seems as if a thousand kisses were too few for the moment when I see my own again. Patience! Patience! <foreign><hi rend="italic">Die Zeit bringt Rosen</hi></foreign> [Time brings roses].</p>
<p>I am getting a little more composed in this whirlpool, and can tell you better how it whirls. I bring up my narrative or rather No-narrative (for nothing has transpired) with all minuteness to this date. Is not my gossip better to <hi rend="italic">her</hi> than all other men#x2019;s eloquence? The Duke#x2019;s franks too cheat the Post-office; and I have shut myself up for leisure (it is yet but half past 2): <foreign><hi rend="italic">allons donc</hi></foreign> [let#x2019;s go then]!</p>
<p>On Friday morning the day after I wrote, Jack walked down with me to Longman#x2019;s and I delivered Napier#x2019;s note to a staid cautious business-like man, who read it with an approving smile; listened to my description of the <hi rend="italic">German Literary History</hi> with the same smile in a <hi rend="italic">fixed</hi> state; and then (like a barbarian as he was)&#x2014;&#x2018;declined the article.#x2019;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-04/lt-18280201-TC-JAC-01"><sic>4:316</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1828-02-01">1 Feb. 1828</date></corr></ref>.</note> He was polite as possible, but seemed determined on risking <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi>. If Murray fail me (as Wednesday will probably show) I have calculated that it will hardly be worth while to take up time with offering these people <hi rend="italic">Dreck;</hi> but that I must try some other course with him. <hi rend="italic">I hope not at all;</hi> therefore hardly think that Murray will accept (so <hi rend="italic">lucky</hi> were it); and am already looking out what I can for other resources in the <hi rend="italic">worst</hi> issue. Dreck shall be printed if a man in London will do it: if not with, then without &#x2018;fee or reward.#x2019; I even conjecture still that this is the time for him: everybody I see participates in the feeling that Society is nigh done; that she is a Phoenix perhaps not so many conjecture. I agree with my Prophetess<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jane Carlyle. One of the many references to her special gifts of prophecy and insight.</note> in thinking that some <hi rend="italic">young</hi> adventurous Bookseller were the hopefullest. We shall see soon.</p>
<p>As Paternoster Row lies in the neighbourhood of the India House, we went thither, and found Strachey,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edward Strachey.</note> very glad to see me; full of <pb id="pg-05-329" n="05:329"/>Radical Reform and so forth; by whom we were invited to come and see Shooter#x2019;s Hill, on Saturday and Sunday, his wife being at home &#x26;c &#x26;c, which we agreed to do. Returning I searched out Bowring;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Bowring, editor of the <hi rend="italic">London and Westminster Review</hi>.</note> found that his family were in the country, and he coming and going: I left my card, and have since had a Note inviting me to breakfast on Tuesday (tomorrow) morning. The Bullers are all at Looe;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The family seat in Cornwall.</note> Mrs B. dying of terror for the <hi rend="italic">cholera;</hi> sick of Germany, sick of the world in general did not Hope continue to flatter her with the foolishest lies. There had been no quarrel with the Cornwall Uncle: it was the Looe Burghers themselves that would not &#x2018;act#x2019;:<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charles Buller#x2019;s uncle, Sir Anthony Buller, had been elected for West Looe in <date when="1831-05-00">May</date> as a new member against reform, while Charles himself was not in Parliament.</note> for the rest, Strachey described Charles as still an idle fellow that would not stand tightly to his task, and so would accomplish little.&#x2014; In the evening we steered off to Allan Cunningham#x2019;s, and were welcomed with vociferous joy: the first question, as it always is, &#x2018;Where is your <hi rend="italic">Wife?</hi>#x2019; (Alas! There is no Wife here.) The finale was that Allan squeezed my hand in both of his, and took my promise of dining with them &#x2018;next week#x2019;;&#x2014;where I suppose I shall meet certain of the craft. I forgot about Rennie;<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Rennie, a former suitor of Jane#x2019;s.</note> but shall try to remember next time.&#x2014; I may mention here that William Fraser has married a <hi rend="italic">Widow</hi>, with &#x2018;some fortune#x2019; (perhaps unfortunate here as in all things); and taken him a house in the country for a year; after which he talks of beginning or resuming the study of Law. I want him here, partly as a kind of Cicerone.</p>
<p>Saturday morning I wrote to Goethe (with kindest love from you too); also to Charles Buller, and W. Fraser (notifying my presence): then off for Shooter#x2019;s Hill, some ten miles away; where without other adventures than those of every swimmer in this vortex of men and coaches we arrived in time for dinner. Strachey is as alert as ever: in his poor Lady I had room to mark the doings of Time; she wore a sad, secluded look; I learned she had for three years been violently dyspeptical. Our recognition was franker on my part than on hers; only her eyes spoke of gladness; nay she seemed to have a kind of fear of me, and in our little <hi rend="italic">special</hi> conversation, I had it all to myself. She inquired kindly for you, whom I described as one that she would like: a <hi rend="italic">hater of Lies</hi> to begin with. Poor Julia Strachey: she is like a flower frozen among ice; and now contented with such soil: a hitherto unnoticed <pb id="pg-05-330" n="05:330"/>girl (her daughter)<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jane Strachey, who married John Hare, a prosperous carpet manufacturer of Bristol. She died in <date when="1886-00-00">1886</date>.</note> had rushed up to be a woman; and in the long black locks I noticed a streak of grey! Fleeting Time! Here too might I partly discern that <hi rend="italic">my</hi> place was changed, tho#x2019; still <hi rend="italic">empty</hi>. A &#x2018;female Friend#x2019; skilled, it is said, in the Greek Tragedians (<foreign><hi rend="italic">credat</hi></foreign> <hi rend="italic">Apella</hi>)<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Horace, <hi rend="italic">Satires</hi>, I, v, 100; also 4:33.</note> was there: brimfull of intolerant Church-of-Englandism; a little grey-eyed ill-bred fat button of a creature (very like a certain white-semstress in Ecclefechan): with her in the course of the evening I was provoked for one moment, so pert was she, to run tilt, and I fear transfix her. Strachey was beginning a horselaugh, but suddenly checked himself as a Landlord should; the little Button went off to bed without goodnight, but was blithe again next morning.<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Two Note Books</hi>, p. 197: &#x201C;Foolish Miss&#x2014;&#x2014;<supplied>[Francis]</supplied> whom the Unregenerate demolishes with a shovel-hat&#x201D;; not identified. Carlyle also describes Strachey as &#x201C;talkative, and full of vivacity as ever; his wife has an unhealthy, faded air; looks rather afraid of me, yet friendly and earnest.&#x201D;</note> That <hi rend="italic">such</hi> should be the only &#x2018;Friend#x2019; of <hi rend="italic">such!</hi> Let not us, dear Jeannie, complain of solitude: I have still <hi rend="italic">you</hi> with really a priceless talent for silence (as Mrs S. too has): I say, priceless; for this Button wants it wholly, and thereby I felt would have driven me in three days to blank despair.&#x2014; We set off at mid afternoon; rowed up the River<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Shooter#x2019;s Hill is near Woolwich, down the Thames a few miles from London. They rowed back to Tower Stairs.</note> (the cheapest way as well as finest in such weather), and got here to tea; where I did nothing afterwards but rest and scribble some lines in my commonplace book.</p>
<p>But where is the orator<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edward Irving.</note> all this while? you ask. He was at Leamington Spa (in Warwickshire) when I arrived; he only returned on Saturday night: has already been up here to see me, and left a message that he would be at home all day. I am to go over for a while were this Letter finished&#x2014;if any time remain. From all I can yet see Irving seems to have taken his part: is forgotten by the intellectual classes; but still flourishes as a green bay tree (or rather green cabbage tree) among the fanatical classes, whose ornament and beacon he is. Strangely enough is it all fashioned among these people: a certain everlasting <hi rend="italic">Truth</hi>, even new Truth, reveals itself in them, but with a <hi rend="italic">Body</hi> of mere froth, and soap-suds and other the like ephemeral impurities. Yet I love the man, and can trustfully take counsel of him. His wife I saw some nights ago: leaner, clearer-complexioned, I should say clearer-hearted also, and clearer-headed; but alas <hi rend="italic">very</hi> strait-laced, <pb id="pg-05-331" n="05:331"/>and living in the <hi rend="italic">Suds</hi>-element as her native one. Mrs Hamilton<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sister of Mrs. Edward Irving.</note> I believe has taken <hi rend="italic">nerves:</hi> she has no children, wishes (as John &#x2018;really believes#x2019;) &#x2018;principally to have a gig#x2019;: and so, I doubt, leads her poor man not the best of lives: it was she that had taken the party to Leamington; I care not tho#x2019; I miss seeing her.</p>
<p>To continue my narrative, I <hi rend="italic">forced</hi> myself out this morning (by way of an act of principle) to go and breakfast with the Advocate:<note n="15" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle notes: &#x201C;Breakfast with the Jeffreys: all very kind. &#x2026; <foreign><hi rend="italic">Nichts weiter passirt</hi></foreign> [Nothing further occurred].&#x201D; Cf. <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi>, II, 258.</note> piloted my way thro#x2019; unknown streets, and was there before any one was up. Charlotte the younger and the elder received me in succession in their choicest mood. Presently appeared a&#x2014;Miss Hunter, and directly thereafter Mr John Jeffrey!<note n="16" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mrs. Jeffrey and their daughter were both named &#x201C;Charlotte&#x201D;; John Jeffrey was the Advocate#x2019;s younger brother, a widower, who was to marry Elizabeth, the sister of Susan Hunter. Susan Hunter would later marry James Stirling (<sic><date when="1820-00-00">1820</date>&#x2013;<date when="1909-00-00">1909</date></sic><corr><date when="1820-00-00">1820</date>&#x2013;<date when="1876-00-00">76</date></corr>), engineer.</note> They came the other day to taste life#x2019;s glad moments, in a sight of London: John is as ever; &#x2018;en<hi rend="italic">joy</hi>ing his beef-steak with the <hi rend="italic">sayme</hi> relish#x2019;; terrified about cholera, and almost openly and with the best humour despised by Mrs. J. In the middle of the breakfast, a side door opened; and the poor Duke looked in in his Nightgown (for they have made the back drawing room into a bedroom) to ask for me; and with the old quizzicality in his little face declared &#x2018;why Charly I#x2019;ve got the cholera I believe#x2019;:<note n="17" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Although Jeffrey joked about cholera, others were very conscious of its advance across Europe: it had been in Poland in the spring, was at present in Germany, and would be at Sunderland by <date when="1831-10-26">26 Oct.</date></note> he called me afterwards into his bedroom, to ask how I was progressing; thought it likely &#x2018;Murray would publish on some terms or other#x2019;; spoke of John, asked for your health, and &#x2018;what I had prescribed for you.#x2019; Letters arriving, and his blear-eyed Scotch Clerk, I got your frank and withdrew; straitly charged to return.&#x2014; I had an enormous walk home: for I took Empsom#x2019;s<note n="18" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Empson#x2019;s.</note> Lodgings in; but found him gone, and could only pop in my card thro#x2019; a slit in the door: he is always out of town from Tuesday to Friday, so I shall not hear of him till the end of the week. (About the other political characters I have made no inquiry.) Next I took in another long circuit to find a certain Seal-cutter, recommended by Allan Cunningham to cut your Seal: alas! there was no such man in that quarter. You would smile if you knew what trotting I have had to seek for the <hi rend="italic">best</hi> in this matter, and perhaps one is just as good as another. Before this time tomorrow, it <hi rend="italic">shall</hi> <pb id="pg-05-332" n="05:332"/>be in the hands of some one or other, should I walk into a shop by chance. The cost I have already learned will be some 15/. The <hi rend="italic">impression</hi> (of which I carry the specimen) seems to be generally approved of: the Seal, warmly abused by Mrs Montague, is well spoken of by the most; the Duke, who had seen it, among the number. I must mention too that there appeared a (puff) notice of it in the <hi rend="italic">Athenaeum</hi>:<note n="19" place="bottom" type="gloss" > <date when="1831-08-06">6 Aug.</date>, p. 508.</note> &#x2018;quite a gem#x2019;, sent to so and so, by so and so (among which latter, Wordsworth, Scott, Rogers and your unfortunate Husband). Procter conjectured that the Seal-maker himself had procured it to be inserted; for it was expressly <hi rend="italic">prohibited</hi> by the parties interested.&#x2014; Let me add only that I am to take tea this evening at Badams#x2019;s, where Godwin<note n="20" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Godwin (<date when="1756-00-00">1756</date>&#x2013;<date when="1836-00-00">1836</date>); cf. <ref target="volume-01/lt-18180216-TC-RM-01"><sic>1:121</sic><corr>TC to RM, <date when="1818-02-16">16 Feb. 1818</date></corr></ref>.</note> is promised; and therewith conclude my flood of talkee-talkee.</p>
<p>&#x2014;Dinner summoned me at that point, and I must here bring my tedious tale (to Janekin not tedious) to an end. I had some &#x2018;general reflexions#x2019; to make, for to you I literally think aloud: but shall forbear them today. Mrs Montague whom I have not seen since last Letter has given me some pain: I grieved to see herself so lonely-looking, so unhappy; still more to see her conduct herself in so very commonplace a style. Her violent vindictive vituperation of Badams was no better than the bitterness of vulgar Love of Money: I wished much to avoid the subject altogether, as she should have wished. She seems to have positively <hi rend="italic">quarrelled</hi> with John, because he could not enter into her feelings. It is really quite pitiable and pitiful: neither wilt thou, my dear <hi rend="italic">Truth</hi>, ever find in this &#x2018;noble#x2019; but factitious &#x2018;Lady#x2019; the heart that will respond to thee. I believe in truth that now when she finds us <hi rend="italic">well</hi>, she cares not two straws for us: farther on the whole that the Montagues are&#x2014;&#x2018;a mixture of good and evil, mother#x2019;;<note n="21" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech, a saying of John Carlyle.

<salute>My Dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Tho#x2019; I have but a few minutes today, and only <hi rend="italic">half</hi> an opportunity (for this will have to go in by Craigenputtoch and lie there a week); yet I scribble you a line, well knowing that the sight of my hand will do you good. I sent off a Newspaper with <hi rend="italic">arrived safe</hi> on it, almost directly on my reaching fixed quarters: Jane, I hope, would write you most of my adventures on the way hither; and how I had already put <pb id="pg-05-334" n="05:334"/>my Manuscript into the hands of the chief Bookseller here, and am to learn how he feels about it the day after tomorrow. I have only to assure you farther that Jack and I are both well; my health seems rather <hi rend="italic">improved</hi>; and I sleep in spite of all noises, and nearly careless of them. The rest I will tell you soon in a <hi rend="italic">frank</hi> of your own (if I can get one); and hope, at any rate, soon to tell it all by word of mouth.&#x2014;&#x2014;Naturally your chief anxiety is poor Jack: of whom therefore I must say that spiritually as well as bodily he is in no unhealthy state, tho#x2019; his economical prospects are not bright, or in any way fixed at present. I think, morally he has very considerably improved: there is a certain Religion in him, without which, as I hold, man has no true strength; and tho#x2019; the poor Doctor is dolefully afflicted with <hi rend="italic">procrastination</hi>, I find <hi rend="italic">no</hi> other mischief that he has done. He has now ascertained (what he might have done in the fifth of the time) that he cannot live in London: I have cross-questioned him tightly, and endeavour to spur him on: he is making investigations about Birmingham; and must either attempt a settlement there, if not elsewhere; or I will bring him home with me, and you shall see him, and advise him. He is now in no debt here, which he cannot forthwith pay. Farther I really do think he shows a <hi rend="italic">talent</hi> for Medical practicing; Jeffrey also is very friendly towards him: so we positively will not <hi rend="italic">let</hi> the man, &#x2018;dwindle into an unintelligible wheener,#x2019; but force him thro#x2019; it. He has some little Literary things on the anvil in the meanwhile, and will lose no time for other objects, if I can hinder him. So fear nothing, dear Mother: but trust in God, and pray to Him for us all, who holds us all in his keeping.&#x2014; I have seen Mrs Strachey unhealthy, Mrs Montague unhappy: Time has been busy with all old Friends. It is a sad thing to look on the Past and find it no longer the Present.&#x2014; Goethe#x2019;s Seal is off, and I have sent a Letter after it.&#x2014; There is the Post hour ringing, and we must run. I have to look in upon Irving (for the first time) the next thing I do.&#x2014; O what a contrast is the harvest-rig [harvest field] at Scotsbrig to this harvest-rig! Nevertheless let us all be diligent and patient: the time of reward cometh. Take care of your health my dear Mother, and be well, to welcome me back again. Oh it is a blessing I am not thankful enough for that you are still <hi rend="italic">here</hi>, spared to me. Assure my Father of my true affection. The like to <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the others. If Alick is with you, my poor Jane will perish of loneliness: could you not spare the other Jane to keep her company a little? Alas! I fear not.&#x2014; Good night my dear Mother! May God watch over you and all of us, and turn everything to good! <closer><salute>Ever Your Affectionate Son&#x2014;</salute></closer><name>T.

<salute>My Dear Cunningham,</salute>
<p>I will with very great pleasure come over on Saturday, as you invite: my Brother also will with all heartiness accompany me.</p>
<p>I am sorry to hear of Mrs C.#x2019;s indisposition, but trust it will be only temporary. I was not aware that night, till I left you, how it stood with the poor Youth,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably either Joseph or Alexander, sons of Cunningham, who both apparently left this year for appointments in the Indian service.</note> and that he stood on the eve of man#x2019;s first calamity, exile from his Father#x2019;s hearth. I wish I had shaken hands with him, and bidden him audibly Good Speed.</p>
<p>My Scriptory ware<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The MS of <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi>.</note> still lies in the scales, which way inclining I cannot say, except in the spirit of a Prophet that ever prophecyeth <hi rend="italic">evil</hi>. On Saturday I shall perhaps know more. Meanwhile, as ever, it is our part to defy the Devil, whether he come in the shape of Bookseller or another. I study to say always: A fig for thee Nicholas!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">I Henry IV</hi>, II, i, where &#x201C;Saint Nicholas#x2019; clerks,&#x201D; disciples of &#x201C;Old Nick&#x201D; (the Devil), are thieves and robbers.</note></p>
<p>Your Letter to Wilkie<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >David Wilkie (<date when="1785-00-00">1785</date>&#x2013;<date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>), Scottish genre and portrait painter, who also painted historical subjects; knighted <date when="1836-00-00">1836</date>. His life was written by Allan Cunningham, who had been his lifelong friend (3 vols., London, <date when="1843-00-00">1843</date>).</note> I shall with my earliest convenience deliver.

<salute>My Dearest,</salute>
<p>This is Wednesday, the day before post; but I have already begged a frank for you; and having a few minutes#x2019; time, which perhaps I shall not have tomorrow, I scribble to you, as in duty bound whatsoever comes uppermost. By this means, if you can get your Carriers to act, you hear largely from me twice a week, and we are not so much <pb id="pg-05-336" n="05:336"/>parted as the long miles would indicate. I expect to hear from you also with the same regularity: doubtless a Letter is already on the road for me, but will hardly come before Friday (for a day is lost in the Twopenny);<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Twopenny postman made regular collections (announced by a bell) and deliveries, several times a day in the center of London, both of local letters (within the Twopenny area) and outside it.</note> so I must be patient. Time will not shorten or lengthen for any one: but I have a Goody that watches his course, and will not let him slip; least of all where <hi rend="italic">I</hi> am concerned. Truly, my Lovekin, I am proud of thee: not only the darning-needles, but every thing else is so trim and right: the marmalade pot and all, of which pot I eat daily to breakfast, and think of the fingers that made it, and the kind heart that bids me welcome to it. Thus is my little Screamikin perfect in all points from the lowest to the highest; and her only fault is that I have her not here to kiss and caress, and tell audibly that I love her beyond all earthly. However, Time is coming: nay even here I can take out the Frankfort Picture of poor Craigenputtoch,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >One of the pictures made by George Moir for the German translation of Carlyle#x2019;s biography of Schiller (Frankfurt am Main, <date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>).</note> and fancy many things (as I have just been doing over it), and feel that every beloved object is the centre of a Paradise. Bless thee, my little Darling! Never forget to love me, then art thou good and best. Understand also that up to this date I have still &#x201C;taken up with no other women,&#x201D; but love my own woman beyond the whole Sisterhood, and am positively far fonder of her than when I wrote from London of old, and was not her Husband but only her Lover. So let this content thee: that I love thee <foreign><hi rend="italic">ungeheuerlich</hi></foreign> [prodigiously]. Is not that the right way? Yes, that is the way: <foreign><hi rend="italic">mich ungeheuerlich lieben!</hi></foreign> [to love myself prodigiously!]&#x2014; Also understand that I continue and indeed have grown more and more &#x201C;unspeakably methodical&#x201D;; lay out my plans daily, and daily study to accomplish <hi rend="italic">something</hi> (as is my Wife#x2019;s wont also); whereby the time of Separation will be shortened, so far as I can shorten it.</p>
<p>On the whole, I have little reason to complain yet: the wheels of my machinery are getting tolerably in order; we shall see soon what they will grind. London does not confuse me, as it used: I heed it not; except to chalk out my route hither and thither thro#x2019; its tortuosities, where this and the other friendly heart, this and the other cunning hand, may be waiting my call. I have seen several things, done one or two, or begun to do them. Thou shalt have my Journal, Wifiekin: thus will thy pretty black eyes follow me throughout, and see all that I see. Hands to work then!</p>
<p><pb id="pg-05-337" n="05:337"/>I think, I left off on the eve of seeing Irving and taking tea with Godwin. The first object I accomplished: Irving with his huge fleece of now grizzled hair received me in his choicest mood, and was eager to talk with me, and see me often. I was with him last night; and being quite in his neighbourhood (within 3 minutes) shall take frequent opportunities of him.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Evidently Carlyle had seen him both on the <date when="1831-08-16">16th</date> and the <date when="1831-08-15">15th</date>, when he wrote in the <hi rend="italic">Two Note Books</hi>, p. 198: &#x201C;Go to Irving#x2019;s to tea; talk of St. Simonism, etc.; Irving at heart the old friend. To dine with Drummond (Banker) in his company on Friday.&#x201D;</note> He is bent on our coming to London; of which I myself can yet say nothing: some vague schemes of settling within some miles of it (as at Enfield, 10 miles off, where Badams is to live) are hovering about me, which I will overhaul in due time, and see thro#x2019;. It will all depend on this: can I get work here, and money for it to keep any sort of house? Which question is yet far from answered or answerable. However, I <hi rend="italic">hope</hi>, and fear not.</p>
<p>Next came Godwin. Did you not grudge me that pleasure, now? At least mourn that you were not there with me? Grudge not, mourn not, dearest Jeannie: it was the most unutterable stupidity ever enacted on this Earth. We went, Jack and I, to the huge Frenchwoman Mrs Kenny#x2019;s (once Mrs Holcroft) Badams#x2019;s Mother-in-law: a sort of more masculine <hi rend="italic">Aurelia</hi>,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In Goethe#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meisters Lehrjahre</hi>.</note> who lives moves and has her being among Plays, Operas, Dilettantes and Playwrights.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Louisa Kenney (d. <date when="1853-00-00">1853</date>), daughter of Louis S. Mercier, the French critic, fourth wife and widow of Thomas Holcroft, was now married to James Kenney (<date when="1780-00-00">1780</date>&#x2013;<date when="1849-00-00">1849</date>), the dramatist.</note> Badams and his wife were not returned from the country but in a few minutes came: Mrs Godwin already sat gossiping in the dusk, an old woman of no significance, by and by dropt in various Playwrightesses and Playwrights, whom I did not even look at; shortly before candles, Godwin himself (who had been drinking <hi rend="italic">good</hi> green tea by his own hearth before stirring out). He is a bald, bushy-browed, thick, hoary, hale little figure with spectacles: taciturn enough, and speaking when he does speak with a certain <hi rend="italic">epigrammatic</hi> spirit; wherein except a little shrewdness there is nothing but the most commonplace character. (I should have added that he wears spectacles, has full grey eyes, a very large blunt characterless nose, and ditto chin.) By degrees I hitched myself near him, and was beginning to open him, and open on him, for he had stared twice at me; when suddenly enough began a speaking of French among the Kennys and Badamsinas (for they are all French-English); and presently Godwin was summoned off to&#x2014;take <pb id="pg-05-338" n="05:338"/>a hand at whist! <hi rend="italic">I</hi> had already flatly declined. There did the Philosopher sit, and a swarm of noisy children, chattering women, lounging dilettantes round him; and two women literally crashing hoarse thunder out of a piano (for it was louder than an iron-forge), under pretext of its being music by Rossini. I thought of my own piano, and the far different fingering it got; looked sometimes not without sorrow at the long-nosed whist-player; and in the space of an hour (seeing supper about to be laid in another room) took myself away. Godwin, if I like, I can see again:<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The visit is also described in the <hi rend="italic">Two Note Books</hi>, pp. 198&#x2013;200, where Carlyle says that he asked Godwin &#x201C;what he thinks of Literary London now as compared with the same object of old. He answers that old men always prefer the bygone time; that many of <hi rend="italic">his</hi> friends are now gone; but that on the whole the old <hi rend="italic">was</hi> the best. &#x2018;Deeper questions were mooted.#x2019;&#x201D; William Godwin (<date when="1756-00-00">1756</date>&#x2013;<date when="1836-00-00">1836</date>), philosophical representative of English radicalism, author of <hi rend="italic">Political Justice</hi> (<date when="1793-00-00">1793</date>) and of <hi rend="italic">Caleb Williams</hi> (<date when="1794-00-00">1794</date>) and other novels, had married Mary Wollstonecraft in <date when="1797-00-00">1797</date>, and had been Shelley#x2019;s father-in-law and the friend of Wordsworth, Lamb, and Coleridge. He had also been a friend of Thomas Holcroft; the Mrs. Godwin referred to here was a Mrs. Clairmont, a widow, whom he had married in <date when="1801-00-00">1801</date>. R. G. Grylls records in <hi rend="italic">William Godwin and His World</hi> (London, <date when="1953-00-00">1953</date>), p. 231, that Godwin also briefly noted this meeting. Godwin merely included in his list of guests for tea on <date when="1831-08-15">15 Aug.</date>: &#x201C;Carlyles (Edinburgh).&#x201D;</note> but poor Badams! O what an element of rubbish and tatters and hollow theatrical brawling dost thou live in! John says, he also detests it: then why not say to his loving, resolute tho#x2019; too girlish wife, March with me this night, and let us leave it forever? <hi rend="italic">Mine</hi> is &#x201C;quite another style of Wife.&#x201D; God be thanked!</p>
<p>Next morning (Tuesday) I went to Bowring#x2019;s. Figure to yourself a thin man about my height, and bent at the <hi rend="italic">middle</hi> into an angle of 150&#xB0;, the <hi rend="italic">back</hi> quite straight; with large grey eyes, a huge turn-up nose with (strait) nostrils to the very point, and large projecting close-shut mouth: figure such a one walking restlessly about the room (for he had been thrown out of a gig and was in pain), frank of speech, vivid, emphatic and <foreign><hi rend="italic">verst&#xE4;ndig</hi></foreign> [reasonable]: such is the Radical Doctor. We talked copiously, he utterly utilitarian and radical, I utterly mystical and radical; and parted about noon; with a standing invitation on his part to come again, and promise to introduce me to the Examiner Editor (Fonblanque); and a certain trust on my part, and disposition to cultivate farther acquaintance. He named several Booksellers whom I might apply to, in case Murray baulked me, as I calculate he is but too like to do. I am making preparations for that event, as is wise in any case. A Danish Professor stept in who knew Repp, and groaned strangely when I mentioned how it stood with him.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thorleifus Gudmundsson Repp (<date when="1794-00-00">1794</date>&#x2013;<date when="1857-00-00">1857</date>), librarian and linguist, born in Iceland, educated in Denmark, and appointed to the Advocates#x2019; Library in Edinburgh in <date when="1825-00-00">1825</date>. Both Professor P. E. Muller (<date when="1776-00-00">1776</date>&#x2013;<date when="1834-00-00">1834</date>) and Professor R. K. Rask (<date when="1787-00-00">1787</date>&#x2013;<date when="1832-00-00">1832</date>) had recommended him, and either might be the Danish professor referred to here, Rask being the more probable. Repp was in the midst of disputes with his employers which were to lead to his discharge, and it is to these that Carlyle clearly refers. Cf. also <ref target="volume-04/lt-18270415-TC-NHJ-01"><sic>4:207</sic><corr>TC to NHJ, <date when="1827-04-15">15 April 1827</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014; The rest of that <pb id="pg-05-339" n="05:339"/>day#x2019;s work was getting the Seal<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly one of the seals used by Carlyle and his wife reproduced in Ritchie, opp. p. 192.</note> disposed of. After infinite pilgrimings (for there <hi rend="italic">was</hi> a choice) I found a man. Varley (Miss Benson#x2019;s Astrologer) would do it for the small charge of 36/: this other artist, a far more cunning-looking man, undertakes for 10/. The next Letter but one will be sealed with it; for I am to have it on Saturday. The inscription is to be in small Roman Capitals, which we judged the best.&#x2014; The Evening I spent with Irving, W. Hamilton and W#x2019;s Wife. Poor Hamilton! His Lady is as withered as <foreign><hi rend="italic">wecht</hi>-pelt</foreign> [dried sheepskin], brown, the colour of our Brussels carpet, only lighter a shade; lean, ill-natured: a hopeful bargain! Nevertheless she made us a dish of excellent porridge from Kirk<supplied>[c]</supplied>aldy meal, and we all came home contented in spirit (except that I had been swallowing salt!)&#x2014; A Letter from the Parishes to John, indicating that the Goethe Seal was on the firm Earth and would be at Weimar in time.</p>
<p>Wednesday morning I put on clean raiment (nothing but the white trousers are wearable here for the heat, and I have still only two pairs), and drawing myself a chart on a slip of paper steered off to Albemarle Street, according to bargain. The Dog of a Bookseller gone to the country. I leave my card with remonstrances and pressing inquiries <hi rend="italic">when</hi>. The Clerk talks of &#x201C;Mr Murray writing you, Sir&#x201D;: I will call again tomorrow morning, and make Mr speak to me, I hope.&#x2014; Wardrop<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Wardrop (<date when="1782-00-00">1782</date>&#x2013;<date when="1869-00-00">1869</date>), surgeon, specialist in eye diseases, educated in Edinburgh and London. From <date when="1818-00-00">1818</date> to <date when="1830-00-00">1830</date> he was one of the surgeons attendant on George IV; and at this time he was working (as well as at other things) in the West London Hospital of Surgery, <date when="1826-00-00">1826</date>&#x2013;<date when="1836-00-00">36</date>, which he had founded.

<p>Thursday afternoon.&#x2014; No Newspaper yesterday, no Letter today! I waited in, till I saw postman pass. Pray Heaven there be nothing wrong; only some mischance at Broatch#x2019;s. I am not without my anxieties but will hope the best. Has her poor little head grown ill, that she cannot write to me? or that abominable <hi rend="italic">midge</hi>, has its bite proved venomous? O Goody, do not disappoint me! The Duke is ready to frank: let me hear <hi rend="italic">every</hi> post.</p>
<p>I <hi rend="italic">went</hi> to the House of Commons last night; and found at the door a Speaker#x2019;s order awaiting me from the Duke. It is a pretty apartment that of theirs; far smaller than I expected, hardly larger than some drawing-rooms you have seen, with some four ranges of benches rising high behind each other like pews in a church gallery; an oval open space in the middle, at the farther extremity of which sits the Speaker in what seemed a kind of Press (like our Wardrobe, only oaken); opposite him is the door. A very narrow gallery runs all round atop, for reporters, strangers &#x26;c: I was seated on the ground floor below this.

I reminded him, not without emphasis, of the engagement made, and how I had nothing else to do here, but see that matter brought to an end: to all which he pleaded hard in extenuation, and for &#x201C;two or three days&#x201D; farther allowance. I made him <hi rend="italic">name</hi> a new day: &#x201C;Saturday first&#x201D;; then I am to return and hear how the matter stands. I begin to fear this Blockhead will spin me out into still longer delays: it is already becoming a question with me, how far I should let him run without taking delay for final rejection. He is said to be noted for procrastination; but also for honourableness, even munificence. My prospects apart from him are not brilliant: however loss of time is the worst of all losses; he shall not keep me dancing round him very long go how it may. Of the Duke I would gladly take counsel; but find no opportunity to speak: a visit profits almost nothing.

<salute>My Dear Alick,</salute>
<p>I write you a syllable or two merely to say that I still think of you; for doubtless the body of my <hi rend="italic">news</hi> is already known to you thro#x2019; Jane. I trust my Mother also knows all about me.</p>
<p>Your Crop seems to have been very handsomely sold: so let us hope you may get all your Craigenputtoch affairs cleared off better than once seemed probable.</p>
<p>I have but a few moments, and must send you what little tidings <pb id="pg-05-343" n="05:343"/>I have about Jack. His position here is much as I fancied it: very questionable, yet not without possibilities of ultimate success even here. His <hi rend="italic">worst</hi> fault, indeed almost only one, is <hi rend="italic">procrastination</hi>. In general character, in appearance of medical skill he has considerably improved: my impression even is very distinctly that he might make a quite superior Practitioner. But he needs to be stirred up: daily there should be some one at his hand to say Arise! let the &#x201C;work of the day&#x201D; be carried on!&#x2014; So long as I am here he can look for little rest.</p>
<p>By my instigation he wrote off to Birmingham (where one of the chief Doctors is thought to be dying): an answer has now come, not very inviting; and just as we are meditating what to do next, there arises a quite new prospect. Namely, a certain Dr Baron of Gloucester, of whom I know a very little, to whom the Advocate<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jeffrey.</note> had been speaking of Jack, is applied to by the Countess of Clare<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Elizabeth Julia Georgiana (<date when="1793-00-00">1793</date>&#x2013;<date when="1879-00-00">1879</date>), third daughter of Peter Burrell, 1st Baron Gwydir. In <date when="1826-00-00">1826</date> she married John Fitzgibbon, 2nd Earl of Clare (<date when="1792-00-00">1792</date>&#x2013;<date when="1851-00-00">1851</date>), Governor of Bombay (<date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>&#x2013;<date when="1834-00-00">34</date>), Privy Councillor (<date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>), Lord Lieut. of County Limerick (<date when="1848-00-00">1848</date>&#x2013;<date when="1851-00-00">51</date>). They had separated in <date when="1829-00-00">1829</date>. She died at Ryde, where she had built a Roman Catholic church some thirty years before.</note> (an Irish lady of rank and wealth) for a Travelling Physician to go to Italy for a year. He mentions Jack, who is accordingly summoned to the West End of this &#x201C;noble City&#x201D;; finds her Ladyship; talks to her (as he thinks, acceptably); and is then informed that &#x2018;she has been speaking to <hi rend="italic">another</hi> Medical gentleman, and will write if she do not engage with him in a day or two.#x2019; I think we shall actually hear something of her: but as yet nothing has come.</p>
<p>For my own share I do not greatly covet this situation: except that it brings some money to a moneyless man, it is distinctly disadvantageous. I counsel him therefore to demand at lowest &#xa3;300 a year; and not to leave the country at all (even for a month) under &#xa3;100. What will come of it all I know not but you shall hear. Perhaps a week or so will decide it. I may mention also another advantage besides the money: one friend among the quality circles here is considered a very great point for a medical man settling in London, as I should like well to see Jack do, were it otherwise possible&#x2014; Irving is decided that he should continue here, and try it to the uttermost; never was surer of any man#x2019;s success &#x26;c &#x26;c<supplied>[.]</supplied> So talks W. Hamilton also: indeed I incline to that view myself, had the man any course open for him. You can tell my Mother that Irving farther (who should <pb id="pg-05-344" n="05:344"/>be a judge) speaks highly of Jack#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">religious</hi> character; and appears everyway to think very well of him.&#x2014;</p>
<p>As I know not whether you are still at Craigenputtoch and wished <supplied>[letter torn away at this point]</supplied> female world.&#x2014; My book is taking its own course, if I look not to it: the &#x2018;trade#x2019; is said to be at the lowest ebb &#x26;c; but all that does not discourage me a whit.&#x2014; Enough now: farewell my dear Brother for the present, and God bless you!</p>
<closer><salute>Ever your#x2019;s, /</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name>
<ps><p>Write me a line by Jane: it is all one expense, when we have a frank.</p></ps>

Robert Barker said one day, naively enough, when I had been skipping all his remarks and sparing myself the fatigue of answering: &#x201C;What does ail you? At Craigenputtoch she is the brightest, most delightful creature in the world&#x2014;and here always sullen and miserable looking!&#x201D; &#x201C;It is a pity it should be so,&#x201D; said my Mother with much emphasis and tossing&#x2014; &#x201C;Fortunate rather&#x201D; I coolly replied&#x2014;&#x201C;it is surely fortunate that I produce the pleasantest impression in the place where I oftenest am and where it is my duty to be&#x201D;&#x2014; But I am not quite alone now Isabella MacTurk accompanied me home&#x2014;whom I think of more highly than I was wont. She is blythe and good-natured to look at, as can be, and then she can work and be silent&#x2014; We shall get on well together for a little while. I told you that I had appointed Alick to come for me on Wednesday. We waited dinner for him till half after four, when he at length arrived&#x2014;and how think you&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">mortal drunk</hi>&#x2014;in such a state as I never saw him in before. I could have cried with shame and vexation, but I tried to laugh if off, as the rest were trying&#x2014;most unsuccessfully&#x2014; Knowing his style of driving in such cases, nothing could have persuaded me to risk myself <pb id="pg-05-345" n="05:345"/>and another in the gig with him&#x2014;except my impatience to get him away from a place where he was making such a deplorable figure&#x2014;where of all places I had wished him to appear to advantage, at least to be himself&#x2014; Isabella was willing to take her chance&#x2014; And off we came about seven having vainly waited to see if he would sober&#x2014;and of course drove like Jeheu<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >2 Kings 9:20; i.e., &#x201C;furiously.&#x201D;</note> up hill down dale over stock and stone&#x2014;making such hairbreadth turns!

<p>&#x201C;I fear it will be long before you forgive me yesterdays [used in the broad sense] work. Try my dear Sister to love me still and I will also try to better merit. I fear Miss Isabella will have me no longer for a favourite.&#x201D;</p></note></p>

<salute>My Dearest little Comforter,</salute>
<p>I begin the work of the day with a Letter to thee, in order to start with two good<supplied>[s]</supplied> at once, a duty and a pleasure. I got a frank yesterday; have paper of the thinnest (far too thin, indeed); an hour at my disposal before any one call; and so mean to have pennyworths.</p>
<p>Your dear kind Letter did arrive that Thursday night; tho#x2019; not till late; with the very latest of the &#x201C;Twopennies,&#x201D; I think,&#x2014;which invaluable class of men keep travelling here all day from 8 in the morning <pb id="pg-05-349" n="05:349"/>till ten at night. My blessings on thee, little Goody, for the kind news thou sendest! It is all a living Picture, and the dear Screamikin Artist standing in the middle of it, both acting it and drawing it for my sake. I saw your half-insane beer-barrel of a Fyffe, and the midges all buzzing round him in the sultry morning; the racket of the Macturk Chaise; your rushing forth to the Post-office, your eager devouring of my Letter; and all the rest of it, in which, alas, the headache, and the &#x201C;two hours&#x201D; of sleep did not escape me. Compose thyself, my Darling: we <hi rend="italic">shall</hi> not long be separated come of it what may. And how should we do, thinkest thou, with an eternal separation! O God! it is fearful, fearful. But is not a little temporary separation like this needful to manifest what <hi rend="italic">daily</hi> mercy is in our lot, which otherwise we might forget or esteem as a thing of course.&#x2014; Understand however once more that I have yet taken up with no other women. Nay, many as I see, light air-forms tripping it on satin along the streets, or plumed Amazons curbing their palfreys in the Park with pomp and circumstance enough,&#x2014;there has no one yet fronted me, whom even to look at I would exchange with my own. And to take into my bosom and clasp there as mine, <foreign><hi rend="italic">ach Gott</hi></foreign> [oh Lord]! there is not such a one extant.&#x2014; This is an <hi rend="italic">original</hi> thought is it not? And yet could any poetic or prophetic revelation please my Darling so, as this repeating of the thousand times repeated? For the truth is, Jeannie, we <hi rend="italic">love</hi> one another; which probably is the greatest blessing in this highly blessed world. Yes, as proud as I am grown (for the more the Devil pecks at me the more vehemently do I wring his nose), and standing on a kind of basis which I feel to be of adamant, I perceive that of all women my own Jeannie is the wife for me: that in her true bosom (once she were a Mystic) a Man#x2019;s head is worthy to lie. Be a Mystic, Dearest; that is, stand with me on this everlasting basis, and keep thy arms around me: thro#x2019; life I fear nothing.</p>
<p>But this is what in the language of censure may be called trifling: I must proceed with my Journal of Life in London; leaving sentiment for word of mouth. Unhappily my Paper, as I said, is too thin, so that the reading will not be pleasant, as the writing is not: nevertheless both are possible, and as the heart is willing we shall not fail. I sent Jack for <hi rend="italic">light</hi> paper, with a view to franks, and this time he has overdone it.</p>
<p>My narrative must have finished, I suppose, on Thursday night about five o#x2019;clock. Jack and I went out to walk and make calls after that; found no one at home but Mrs Badams, who was nigh weeping when she spoke to us of her husband. Poor thing, I can easily see she <pb id="pg-05-350" n="05:350"/>has a ticklish game to play; for Badams seems to me to be hovering on the verge of ruin, uncertain as yet whether he will turn back, or only plunge down, down. I tell all in this one word: he is in the habit of daily drinking brandy till his head get confused! He began this accursed practice not many months ago, for the sake of an intolerable headache he had, and which brandy (then nauseous enough to him) taken till it made him retch was wont to cure: but now I suspect the nauseousness has ceased; and the brandy (or gin) is chiefly coveted because it yields stupefaction. Poor Badams! his volition seems gone, or quite dormant: he flies into the Country promising himself that he will ride for his health, since nothing else can be done as yet; and, said his wife, he has ridden twice these five months. He lounges on a sofa; and does nothing, or worse. God help him, and her! For she seems to love him, and sees not how to help him. I spake comfort to her, and have still hopes, but not unmixed with fears. Badams#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Gig</hi> has broken down with him all to shivers at full speed, and he has not found his <hi rend="italic">legs</hi> yet, which indeed are lamed by the fall, and will not carry him.</p>
<p>With the Montagues I have somewhat less sympathy. It seems still uncertain whether they will lose <hi rend="italic">anything</hi> by him; and their ferocity (except poor Basil) is quite transcendental. On the whole, my original impression of that &#x201C;noble lady&#x201D; was the true one: she is an Actress, and <hi rend="italic">very</hi> little more. The most ravenous <hi rend="italic">Iety</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle applies the same word, meaning egocentricity, to Mrs. Montagu in <hi rend="italic">Two Note Books</hi>, p. 195.</note> dwells in her that I ever noticed in woman. She goes upon words, words. For example, in spite of all the foolish plastering with fine speeches, what have they made of me since I came hither? Never once asked me what I wanted, or so much as come or sent to give me good day. I called once more, and left my card; and shall continue at rare intervals to do the like: but for trust or friendship, it is now more clearly than ever a chimera. One must lean on <hi rend="italic">living</hi> bosoms, not on hollow word-bags. And yet if the noble Lady is unhappy ought we not to try if there be any little solace for her? Yes surely, and will.&#x2014; I smiled (better than the Duke did) at her offer of &#x201C;giving you money&#x201D; to come hither. Jane <hi rend="italic">Welsh Carlyle</hi> a taker of money, in this Era of the Gigmen! <foreign><hi rend="italic">Nimmer und nimmermehr</hi></foreign> [Never&#x2014;nevermore].<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Faust I</hi>, ll. 3376&#x2013;77 (&#x201C;Gretchens Stube&#x201D;).</note> And then to think how admirably sure the noble lady was that her &#x201C;offer&#x201D; might be made without the smallest risk. Tush! it is all stuff and fudge and fiddle-faddle; of which I begin to grow aweary.&#x2014; Oh no, my Dearest, we will have no meetings that we cannot purchase for ourselves: we shall meet, nay perhaps <pb id="pg-05-351" n="05:351"/>ere long thou shalt see London and thy Husband in it on earnings of our own.&#x2014; From all which the practical inference is: &#x201C;Let us endeavor to clear our minds of Cant.&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Boswell, <hi rend="italic">Life of Johnson</hi>, p. 1235.</note></p>
<p>Friday I spent with Irving, in the <foreign><hi rend="italic">animali-parlanti</hi></foreign> [talking-animals]<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-01/lt-18200603-TC-EI-01"><sic>1:255</sic><corr>TC to EI, <date when="1820-06-03">3 June 1820</date></corr></ref>.

Understand, ladykin, that the &#x201C;gift of tongues&#x201D; is here also (chiefly among the women), and a positive belief that God is still working miracles in the Church&#x2014;by hysterics. Nay, guess my astonishment when I learned that poor Dow of Irongray<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Rev. David Dow (ca. <date when="1798-00-00">1798</date>&#x2013;<date when="1878-00-00">1878</date>), educated at St. Andrews and from <date when="1822-00-00">1822</date> assistant to his father as minister of Irongray parish, Kirkcudbrightshire. Expelled from the ministry of the Church of Scotland in <date when="1832-00-00">1832</date>, he created a sensation at Irving#x2019;s trial before the presbytery of Annan in <date when="1833-00-00">1833</date> by calling down damnation upon it. He later emigrated to South Africa but returned to die in Edinburgh. Cf. <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi>, II, 186.</note> is a Wonder-worker and Speaker with tongues; and had actually &#x201C;cast out a Devil&#x201D; (which however returned again in a week) between you and Dumfries! I gave my widest stare: but it is quite indubitable; his autograph Letter was read me, detailing all that the <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;Laart&#x201D;</hi> had done for him. Poor fellow it was four days after his Wife#x2019;s death. I was very <foreign>wae</foreign> for him, and not a little shocked.&#x2014; Irving hauled me off to Lincoln#x2019;s Inn Fields to hear my Double (Mr Scott);<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alexander John Scott (<date when="1805-00-00">1805</date>&#x2013;<date when="1866-00-00">66</date>), who was brought to London in <date when="1828-00-00">1828</date> to be Irving#x2019;s assistant and whom Irving spoke of as Carlyle#x2019;s &#x201C;double.&#x201D; In <date when="1831-05-00">May 1831</date> he had been charged with heresy before the presbytery of Paisley and was deprived of his license, but he remained minister at Woolwich (<date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>&#x2013;<date when="1846-00-00">46</date>). In <date when="1848-00-00">1848</date> he was appointed to the chair of English at University College, London; in <date when="1851-00-00">1851</date> he became first principal of Owens College, Manchester, and was appointed to the chair of logic and mental philosophy, comparative grammar, and English literature. He also helped to found the Manchester Working Men#x2019;s College.</note> where I sat directly behind a Speaker with Tongues, who unhappily however did not perform, till after I was gone. My Double is more like &#x201C;Maitland&#x201D;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> the Cotton-eared, I hope, than me; a thin black-complexioned, vehement man; earnest, clear, and narrow as a tailor#x2019;s listing. For a stricken hour did he sit expounding in the most superannuated dialect (of <hi rend="italic">Chroist</hi> and so forth) yet with great heartiness the meaning of that one word <foreign><hi rend="italic">Entsagen</hi></foreign> [renunciation]. The good Irving looked at me wistfully, for he knows I cannot take miracles in; yet he looks so piteously as if he implored me to believe. O dear O dear! was the Devil ever busier than now; when the Supernatural must either depart from the world, or reappear there like a chapter of <pb id="pg-05-352" n="05:352"/>Hamilton#x2019;s &#x201C;diseases of Females.&#x201D;<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alexander Hamilton, M.D. (<date when="1739-00-00">1739</date>&#x2013;<date when="1802-00-00">1802</date>) was author of <hi rend="italic">A Treatise on the Management of Female Complaints and of Children in Early Infancy</hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1785-00-00">1785</date>).</note> But Teufelsdreck will and shall (in spite of the Devil) make his appearance.</p>
<p>At night I fondly trusted we had done with the Miraculous: but no, Henry Drummond too is a believer in it. This Drummond who inhabits a splendid mansion in the West, proved to be a very striking man. Taller and leaner than I, but erect as a plummet, with a high-carried quick penetrating head; some five-and-forty years of age: a singular mixture of all things; of the Saint, the Wit, the Philosopher, swimming if I mistake not in an element of Dandyism. His dinner was Dandiacal in the extreme; a meagre series of pretentious kickshaws, on which no hungry jaw could satisfactorily bite, flunkies on all hands, yet I had to ask four times before I could get a morsel of bread to my cheese.

We parted with friendliest indifference, and shall all be happy to meet again, and to part again. The Drummond who is a great Pamphleteer has &#x201C;quoted&#x201D; me often, it seems &#x26;c &#x26;c. He is also a most munificent and beneficent man&#x2014;as his friends say. Peace and Happiness be with him!<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle writes in <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi>, II, 197&#x2013;98: &#x201C;He [Irving] was by this time deep in Prophecy and other aberrations; surrounded by weak people, mostly echoes of himself and his incredible notions: but he was willing to hear me, too, on secularities &#x2026; even shrewd in regard to anything of business if you consulted him on that side. He objected clearly to my Reform-Bill notions; found <hi rend="italic">Democracy</hi> a thing forbidden, leading down to outer darkness; I, a thing inevitable, and <hi rend="italic">obliged</hi> to lead whithersoever it could. We had several colloquies on that subject; on which, though my own poor convictions are widened, not altered, I should now have more sympathy with his than was then the case. We also talked on Religion. &#x2026; We were in fact, hopelessly divided, to what tragical extent both of us might well feel! But something still remained; and this we (<hi rend="italic">he</hi> at least, for I think in friendship he was the nobler of the two) were only the more anxious to retain and make good. I recollect breakfasting with him and the like, a strange set of ignorant conceited fanatics forming the body of the party, and greatly spoiling it for me.&#x201D; This whole scene of religious fanatics and Tory M.P.#x2019;s combined, members of good families (Scottish Earls and sons of ex-Prime Ministers), hobnobbing at one moment with educated peasants like Scott and Irving, and then the next off to see King Billy and the Pope, gives a picture of English society which is both true and yet like nothing else but a scene out of <hi rend="italic">Alice in Wonderland</hi>.</note>&#x2014; By the by, I may say that the Jeffreys rolling <pb id="pg-05-353" n="05:353"/>along Piccadilly had a glimpse of me and Irving, as we walked to that dinner, and a bow from me; and wondered where I had scraped acquaintance with&#x2014;Paganini!<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Nicolo Paganini (<date when="1782-00-00">1782</date>&#x2013;<date when="1840-00-00">1840</date>), virtuoso Italian violinist and composer, who had been in London until <date when="1831-06-00">June</date> and was then on tour. See also <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi>, II, 198, where Carlyle describes him as &#x201C;the One-string Fiddler Paganini, a tall, lean taciturn abstruse-looking figure, who was then, after his sort, astonishing the idle of mankind.&#x201D;</note> For it seems the Fiddler is very like the orator only infinitely leaner, but with loose clothes.</p>
<p>On Saturday morning I set out for Albemarle Street; taking up your Seal by the way; which Seal I reckoned well done (for 10 shillings), and hope the Leddy herself will be of the same mind. Murray as usual was not in; but an answer lay for me: my poor Teufelsdreck wrapped in new paper, with a Letter stuck under the pack thread! I took with a silent fury, and walked off. The Letter said, he regretted exceedingly &#x26;c that&#x2014;all his Literary friends were out of town, he himself occupied with a sick family in the country; that he had conceived the finest hopes &#x26;c; in short that Teufelsdreck had never been looked into; but that if I would let him keep it for a month, he would <hi rend="italic">then</hi> be able to say a word, and by God#x2019;s blessing a favourable one. I walked on thro#x2019; Regent-Street, and looked in upon James Fraser the Bookseller, and sat down in his backshop to rest me. First of all it became apparent here that Fraser had not and could not have any proposal to make about his Magazine worth listening to for half a minute; but that the whole concern was damnable and well nigh damned. Secondly we got to talk about Teufelsdreck: when after much hithering and thithering about the black state of trade &#x26;c, it turned out that honest James would publish the Book for me, on this principle: If I would give <hi rend="italic">him</hi> a sum not exceeding &#xa3;150 sterling! &#x201C;I think you had better wait a little,&#x201D; said an Edinburgh Advocate to me since, when he heard of this proposal: &#x201C;Yes,&#x201D; I answered, &#x201C;it is my purpose to wait to the end of Eternity first.&#x201D;&#x2014; &#x201C;But the Public will not buy Books.&#x201D;&#x2014; &#x201C;The Public has done the wisest thing it could; and ought never more to buy what they call Books.&#x201D;</p>
<p><pb id="pg-05-354" n="05:354"/>
Spurning at Destiny, yet in the mildest terms taking leave of Fraser, I strode thro#x2019; these streets, carrying Teuf<hi rend="italic">k</hi> openly in my hand, <hi rend="italic">not</hi> like a gentleman. I took a pipe and glass of water, and counsel with myself. I was bilious and sad, and thought of my dear Jeannie, for whom also were these struggles, with an inexpressible tenderness. Having rested a little, I set out again to the Longmans to hear what they had to say. The German Lit. Hist. having soon been despatched I describe Teufelsdreck; bargain that they are to look at it themselves; and send it back again in two days; that is tomorrow. They are honest, rugged, punctual-looking people, and will keep their word; but their chance of <hi rend="italic">declining</hi> seems to me a hundred to one. Meanwhile I keep looking out on all hands, for another issue. Perhaps I shall have to march thro#x2019; the whole squad of scoundrels, and try them all. <foreign>A <hi rend="italic">la bonne heure!</hi></foreign> [Well and good!] I have a problem which <hi rend="italic">is</hi> possible: either to get Dreck printed, or to ascertain that I <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> and so tie him up and come home with him. So fear nothing, Love: I care not a doit for the worst; and thou too hast the heart of a heroine, art worthy of me were I the highest of heroes. Nay, my persuasion that Teuf<hi rend="italic">k</hi> is in his place and his time here grows stronger the more I see of London and its philosophy: the Doctrine of the <hi rend="italic">Phoenix</hi>, of <hi rend="italic">Nat. Supernaturalism</hi> and the whole Clothes Philosophy (be it but well stated) is exactly what all intelligent men are wanting. So again fear nothing; but kiss me, and bid me be of courage. Men talk of their Wives, and how a &#x201C;married man&#x201D; must do this and beware of that (contrary to right), as if the Wife were a wretched drag on you, not a fellow Soldier brave as yourself, and true to the death. The Mystic School, be God thanked for it, is what we can call <hi rend="italic">well</hi> married. Yes, Janekin, thou art <hi rend="italic">mine;</hi> and I would not give thee for three kingdoms.</p>
<p>Scarcely had I reposed some halfhour, when we must off other three or four miles to Allan Cunningham#x2019;s. They had the Editor of the Athenaeum there, one Dylk, or Dirk (or Dirt, for we <hi rend="italic">could</hi> not gather the name all night):<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charles Wentworth Dilke (<date when="1798-00-00">1798</date>&#x2013;<date when="1864-00-00">1864</date>), journalist, critic, and antiquary, at this time editor of the <hi rend="italic">Athenaeum</hi> (<date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>&#x2013;<date when="1846-00-00">46</date>); afterwards manager of the <hi rend="italic">Daily News</hi> (<date when="1846-00-00">1846</date>&#x2013;<date when="1849-00-00">49</date>). He was the friend of Keats, Leigh Hunt, Thomas Hood, John Forster, and Dickens; an editor of Pope; and an authority on eighteenth-century literary history.</note> a brave sort of fellow, openly recognising the right yet continuing to say that one should do the wrong&#x2014;&#x201C;All true, Mr Carlyle; <hi rend="italic">but</hi>&#x201D;&#x2014; There was also a Doctor Something from Edinburgh, the mildest of friendly Dilettantes, who at least looked and laughed always on my side. John and &#x201C;Dr Irving&#x201D;<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Apparently George Irving, the physician, rather than his brother Edward.</note> completed <pb id="pg-05-355" n="05:355"/>the party. Dylk#x2019;s wife indeed joined us at tea: a common grey-eyed eating Englishwoman, forty and fat as a sausage. Allan was as ever the kindest of landlords. His Wife I did not like so well: she has grown to be one and somewhat; had a dinner far too rich, as I thought; silver forks, hock, claret &#x26;c: in all which there lay for me both good and evil: respect for her guests, yet also incipient gigmanhood, where it was least of all looked for. We had immensities of talk; and Dylk (a sort of Edinburgh Rutherford-Advocate&#x2014;with the nose beaten to a point) heard mysticism for the first time with astonishment enough. I think I shall see him again; for he is not a Liar if he could help it. Neither was George Rennie forgotten. They knew only that he lived somewhere in that vicinity, was but an amateur statuary, not likely to do good in it; rather sullen and snappish, being in bad humour with his Wife#x2019;s relatives who lived &#x201C;in a grand way&#x201D; in the West, and &#x201C;looked down&#x201D; on their sister because she had married a statutory character. I could not discern clearly whether my calling on him were proper or not.&#x2014; W. Gray<note n="15" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably William Gray.

 <p>Sunday morning had a snip of a note from Empsom<supplied>[n]</supplied>: walked over to Jermyn Street: saw the Duke; Rutherford (who was the &#x201C;Ed Advoc&#x201D; alluded to above);<note n="16" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Andrew Rutherfurd (<date when="1791-00-00">1791</date>&#x2013;<date when="1854-00-00">1854</date>), became advocate <date when="1812-06-27">27 June 1812</date>, and under the Melbourne administration solicitor-general for Scotland (<date when="1837-00-00">1837</date>). He was an M.P. (<date when="1839-00-00">1839</date>&#x2013;<date when="1847-00-00">47</date>), lord advocate in <date when="1839-00-00">1839</date> and again in <date when="1846-00-00">1846</date>&#x2013;<date when="1851-00-00">51</date>. See <ref target="volume-05/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/24368"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>.</note> and the &#x201C;Sa<hi rend="italic">y</hi>m relish,&#x201D;<note n="17" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Jeffrey. See <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310815-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1831-08-15">15 Aug.</date></ref></note> from whom I borrowed a snuff. Had to tell the Duke openly (or not at all) how it stood with my Manuscript; felt clear and sharp as a war-weapon for the world was not brotherly to me. The Charlottes<note n="18" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jeffrey#x2019;s wife and daughter.</note> were at Church. I consulted the Duke in a window about Napier; found my own idea confirmed that he was anxious enough to have me write, but afraid lest I committed him. So that &#x201C;agreeing about subjects&#x201D; would be the Difficulty. Jeffrey asked to see my <hi rend="italic">Ms</hi>. when the Longmans had done with it: he would look thro#x2019; it, and see what he could <hi rend="italic">talk</hi> to Murray concerning it. I gladly consented: and thus for the while the matter rests. Murray is clearly the man, if he <hi rend="italic">will:</hi> only I have <hi rend="italic">lost</hi> ten days by him already; for he might have told me what he did finally tell in one day. It is said, he drinks a little liberally.</p>
<p>We had also some talk about John. The Countess of Clare, namely, had written again, asking to know his <hi rend="italic">terms</hi>. Jeffrey seemed to think <pb id="pg-05-356" n="05:356"/>it a very fine opening for London Practice; said he should consult Dr Holland,<note n="19" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henry Holland (<date when="1788-00-00">1788</date>&#x2013;<date when="1873-00-00">1873</date>), the prominent London physician, later knighted. He was a student at Edinburgh with Carlyle in <date when="1811-00-00">1811</date>.</note> and not be too sticklish about terms. Thither accordingly the Doctor has been; returns since I began this Letter with advice to hint at something like &#xa3;300; but not to be too stiff, for the &#x201C;opening&#x201D; is good. He is at this moment writing his Note to the Lady, having in vain endeavoured to see her, as he came along. For I have now for the time bullied the Procrastinating spirit pretty well out of him. On the whole, he is not (bating this) so foolish as we thought: I even feel assured that he would prosper as a medical practitioner; as a man, at all events, he is very greatly improved, and stands on a basis now. I think this a fortunate outlook for him; and have some thought that it will come to a bearing; and be the beginning of better things. Heaven grant it!</p>
<p>William Fraser, who hastened into town when he heard of my arrival, called yesterday (had called the night before): he was to be here again today at eleven; but has not come, tho#x2019; it is now after one. Always unfortunate with the best intentions.<note n="20" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310418-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1831-04-18">18 April</date></ref>.</note> A very gen<hi rend="italic">teel</hi> man, in reality: thin copiously whiskered face, thin irregularly Roman nose; mouth curved with exaggerated delicacy, blue timorous laughing eyes: very fond of <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, and somewhat afraid. He knows all the Craft here; and can at least point out the objects to me, if not show me the way. We are to dine there tomorrow, and see some of the <hi rend="italic">Miserables</hi> called Literary. I go with <hi rend="italic">Dreck</hi> (in the <hi rend="italic">worst</hi> issue) to Jeffrey next morning and also get a frank.&#x2014;</p>
<p>Thus stands it with me, Dearest Love and Goody. I write all down: tell the Dumfries Postmaster to mind Saturdays also, and I will <hi rend="italic">continue</hi> to write twice a week, or at worst send some Newspaper or other memorial. It does myself &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">so</hi> much good.&#x201D; Dost thou mind, thou little Gipsey?&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>
<p>I am struggling onwards, what I can: but my fear still is that the matter may be protracted beyond calculation, and our Divorce continue. In these circumstances I have been thinking whether if Delays immeasurable do actually take place, it were not better for thee to come hither than me to return thither empty-handed. I have yet whispered this to no one. The worst is, London is very vacant at present: no one here you would take much interest in: nothing but <hi rend="italic">Saints</hi>, who would look on you cordially. What if we should <hi rend="italic">take</hi> the Bullers<supplied>[#x2019;]</supplied> invitation, and see Cornwall till the town fill again. (Jeffrey says he does not see that the Parl<hi rend="italic">t</hi> will rise till <date when="1831-11-00">November</date>.) But in <pb id="pg-05-357" n="05:357"/>any case am not <hi rend="italic">I</hi> here? I have been computing how it is: we have about &#xa3;40 in money on hand; Nap<supplied>[i]</supplied>er#x2019;s &#xa3;36 to call for; and Cochrane#x2019;s on the way: in all a Hundred pounds clear. Why not spend the winter here as well as in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, where is little enough to attract us? Even in this very Lodging I see not but you could live very well; at an expence of some 45/ per week. It is a quite heartsome room (larger than either of our own), well gilt and papered, with a large folding window (which will be rather cold in winter), and a bedroom of the same size above it; and the bed large enough to hold us <hi rend="italic">both</hi>. It stands apart from carriages, is well-aired, has noises innumerable, yet I sleep in it till half past seven. The Servant is a rugged Scotchwoman, very honest and through-going: a mixture of Grace Macdonald and Grace Caven. Think how you would like it, in case of the worst.&#x2014; Or perhaps we could do some other way. For example Fraser has a house in the West, which he would fain be quit of for the winter: only I fear it would be far too expensive for us; and Betty were ill to transport.&#x2014; You could travel quite easily: for some five pounds Embark at <hi rend="italic">Annan;</hi> rest in Liverpool; then take the <hi rend="italic">Mail</hi>, and jump down into my arms.&#x2014; We have nothing good here, but the butcher meat. The worst milk, potatoes, butter &#x26;c &#x26;c. But things can be carried (I think I remember) from Liverpool hither for twopence a stone! Canns of of [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] butter our own Noolie will give us:<note n="21" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A cann was a wooden or earthenware dish; Noolie was the Carlyles#x2019; cow.</note> hams &#x26;c; especially valuable were a barrelkin of preserved Eggs. But I need not go into details: do thou consider it all maturely over; and with thy own prophetic spirit give it me back interpreted. The question is, if it so turn out: Shall I linger here apart from thee; or come home <foreign><hi rend="italic">re infecta</hi></foreign> [with the business unfinished]? Let us both think of it, and so be ready by and by to <hi rend="italic">do what is best</hi>.</p>
<p>I have finished all my novelties, or nearly so, and as I anticipate nothing remarkable in my history today, I may seal even now, and save myself the fatigue of a <hi rend="italic">second</hi> journey after Post-offices.&#x2014; Will not the Goody#x2019;s Letter be here tomorrow night; nay tonight, if she wrote on Wednesday! I think I shall learn to <hi rend="italic">call</hi> on the Jeffreys on the Post Mornings, and so save 10 hours of expectation. Count on my writing; and let us rejoice in these blessed franks.</p>
<p>Irving would have had me to Woolwich today to see my Double, with him; as indeed I was invited: however I declined. He (Irving) sends you his love: also the Cunninghams have repeatedly desired remembrances to the &#x201C;hilltop.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Where is Alick? tell me of him. What a wondrous law-plea!&#x2014; Also <pb id="pg-05-358" n="05:358"/>judge whether my Mother <hi rend="italic">needs</hi> a Letter, and if so send her one. Did I give you the Compl<hi rend="italic">ts</hi> from Liverpool? Commend me also to your Mother; and see whether there is anything I can do for her here.&#x2014; I have got me a pair of excellent duck trowsers, 16/; and the Greatcoat mended, 1/. I must have a waistcoat also. Miss Lawson#x2019;s shirts are excellent; her collars detestable; all cut away in the middle, so that man#x2019;s art cannot make them <hi rend="italic">stand up</hi>. However, I have others: nay they can be bought here at 1/ apiece. I wish I had more cotton stockings with me: but indeed the weather is very greatly cooled since last week. On the whole, I want nothing but my Goody, and her I do hourly want.</p>
<p><foreign>Adieu</foreign> then Dearest! Think of me with constant affection as I do of thee. O are not we happy, were we ten times poorer? True to God; true to one another: there is our watchword. The Devil and the World cannot prevail against us: we will front all things, and not <hi rend="italic">single</hi> but <hi rend="italic">double</hi>.</p>
<p>Bid Alick scribble me a line (for the frank carries <hi rend="italic">three</hi> ordinary sheets) if he is still there.&#x2014; <closer><salute>Write boundlessly thyself, and kiss me and take me, and be my own Jane forever. Yes, <foreign><hi rend="italic">auf ewig</hi></foreign> [eternally]! Thy own Husband</salute></closer></p>
<name>T. Carlyle</name>
<ps><p>There is a full narrative of the Goethe Seal in the <hi rend="italic">Allgemeine Zeitung</hi>,<note n="22" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The article appeared in the issue of <date when="1831-08-09">9 Aug.</date> and, sent by an anonymous correspondent, was dated at London on <date when="1831-07-29">29 July</date>. In translation, it begins: &#x201C;I have now been writing to you so long and often of political matters that it pleases me to begin my letter for once with something quite foreign to politics. Only today a present was sent from here to our &#x2018;Old Master#x2019; Goethe, one which honors the giver as much as it does the distinguished recipient. It is a great seal for a desk. &#x2026; This beautiful work of art (the work of the excellent Salter, Widdowson[?], and Tate) is the gift &#x2026; of nineteen Englishmen and Scots (each of whom subscribed two guineas), who honor German literature and the &#x2018;German Master.#x2019; Of these at the top of the list is Thomas Carlyle, the author of a life of Schiller which has also been translated into German, and whose brother, I suspect, is the person behind this undertaking.&#x201D; The article then names thirteen other English subscribers, making a total of fifteen; and the names are the same as those given by an anonymous correspondent of Karl Zelter (see <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310717-FEF-G-01"><sic>Fifteen English Friends to Goethe</sic><corr>FEF to G</corr>, [<date when="1831-07-17">17? July</date>]</ref>. Presumably this is the letter to Zelter. Even though it lists only fifteen subscribers, it speaks of &#x201C;nineteen&#x201D; and is therefore the probable source of the error continued in other German publications later. It is of course mistaken in suggesting that John A. Carlyle, rather than Carlyle himself, was &#x201C;the person behind this undertaking.&#x201D;</note> it seems; how it got thither, unknown. I expect to see it tomorrow.&#x2014;<closer><salute>And now Dearest one last kiss! Take care of thy Head, and love me. <foreign><hi rend="italic">A Dieu!</hi></foreign></salute></closer></p>
<p><pb id="pg-05-359" n="05:359"/>I meant to inclose the Buller#x2019;s Letter, wherein you also (if here) are kindly enough invited by Mrs Buller to Cornwall.<note n="23" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charles Buller wrote to Carlyle on <date when="1831-08-16">16 Aug</date>: &#x201C;I observe your mind never appears to have contemplated the possibility of extending your journey to Cornwall: yet I assure you that the spot is accessible to you, however impervious it was to the Roman or the Saxon of yore.

<salute>My dear dear Love</salute>
<p>I have been &#x2018;so vexed and unwilling <hi rend="italic">to wait</hi>#x2019;&#x2014;the Barbarian of a Carrier did <hi rend="italic">not</hi> call on Saturday&#x2014;I set off to Nether Craigenputtoch on Sunday&#x2014;so soon as I thought the people would be come&#x2014;walked at such speed that Isabella could not at all keep up with me and sat down on a stone by the wayside&#x2014;arrived breathless at the door to hear Miss Corson simper forth there were no letters&#x2014;and came home again with my heart so sick as I cannot describe&#x2014;I was sure that something must be wrong; for you never make even half a promise without keeping it wholly&#x2014; To be sure I might have supposed that the Carrier simply had not called; but who has their wits in such circumstances&#x2014; I would have been off by daybreak I believe on Monday morning to have seen into it, had Harry been road worthy&#x2014;but his sides are still sore&#x2014;and Alick was leading hay&#x2014;and so I must <pb id="pg-05-360" n="05:360"/>wait&#x2014;wait&#x2014; This morning however I started at six&#x2014;was at the post office before the London mail got first the Saturday#x2019;s letter&#x2014;and an hour after the other and am now as happy as one can be in Dumfries amidst a plash of rain&#x2014;and the prospect of retching all the way home&#x2014; God bless you my darling for your kind long letters they are unspeakably precious to me&#x2014;and you are unspeakably precious to me&#x2014; and I should like to tell you so at leisure</p>
<p>I should have had a long letter ready for you to day&#x2014;but I could not settle myself to write till I knew why you had not written&#x2014;so you must be content with this scrawl just to keep you easy&#x2014;till I have time to collect myself and deliberate on all the wonderful things you tell me&#x2014;let it but be ascertained that it is proper for me to come&#x2014;and fear not but I shall accomplish the journey and all the rest of it, with the greatest ease&#x2014;</p>
<p>If we are to be in London in winter it were as well I think that you did not return for all the time&#x2014;but I must consider calmly on all sides as well as the pleasant one&#x2014;</p>
<p>Isabella came down with us today in expectation of getting <hi rend="italic">a chance</hi> home in which case I shall be quite alone tomorrow&#x2014; Alick and Jenny go to Scotsbrig&#x2014; He speaks of returning the end of next week to shear [reap] his patch of corn&#x2014;he will bring Jane or little Jenny with him if possible&#x2014;if not he can lodge with us and I have promised to <hi rend="italic">bind</hi> for him&#x2014; The elder Jenny<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alexander Carlyle#x2019;s wife.</note> will be more a riddance than a loss&#x2014;she has been quite unsufferable of late with <hi rend="italic">jealousy</hi> of her husband&#x2014;whether with Isabella or me or both I cannot say&#x2014;but last night that I cut Alick#x2019;s hair and Isabella sat looking on; she was nearly beside herself&#x2014;cried till bed time and broke out on me with a bur<supplied>[s]</supplied>t of impertinence that filled me with weender and amazement<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-04/lt-18270416-JWCGW-TC-01"><sic>4:213</sic><corr>JWC and GW to TC, <date when="1827-04-16">16 April 1827</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014;poor Alick!

<salute>Dearest Love,</salute>
<p>What a blessing are these franks of the Duke#x2019;s! I can sit down at any moment and scribble to you, were it nothing but complaints, and thousand times repeated expressions of fondness: by this means is some image of a union face to face still kept up; we are less lonely in separation; I bear everything more easily, enjoy everything doubly, when I think I can tell it all to <hi rend="italic">her</hi>.</p>
<p>But why, my own Jeannie, dost thou not do the like by me? Alas! no Letter has come for now almost a week: I half ran over to Jermyn Street this morning, making sure of a Letter, which I had directed to be <hi rend="italic">left</hi> for me that I might have it so many hours sooner; and alas there was &#x201C;nothing for you, Carlyle&#x201D;! Surely I know, it is no blame of yours: some stagnation at the Kirk, nothing worse: yet I cannot express what disappointment the delay gives, what foolish hypochondriacal notions it conjures up. O what would I do had anything befallen my Own! Write to me, Dearest: let nothing but absolute impossibility prevent thee: <hi rend="italic">twice</hi> a week, that was the arrangement; ever till we <hi rend="italic">meet again</hi>.</p>
<p>I had meant to have written largely, but am all taken aback and <pb id="pg-05-362" n="05:362"/>out of order. The foolish creature Heraud<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Abraham Heraud (<date when="1799-00-00">1799</date>&#x2013;<date when="1887-00-00">1887</date>), poet and dramatist, friend of Coleridge, Southey, Wordsworth, and Lockhart, assistant to the editor of <hi rend="italic">Fraser#x2019;s Magazine</hi> (<date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>&#x2013;<date when="1833-00-00">33</date>); later edited other periodicals and contributed to the <hi rend="italic">Athenaeum</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Illustrated London News</hi>. Author of <hi rend="italic">A Philosophical Estimate of the Controversy Respecting the Divine Humanity</hi> (London, <date when="1831-00-00">1831</date>), <hi rend="italic">The Judgement of the Flood</hi> (London, <date when="1834-00-00">1834</date>), and other works.</note> called five hours ago and more, just when I was going to begin; and he is not yet half an hour gone. May the Devil reward him, say you, and say I. However, I do what is possible, and spend the few minutes that remain before supper (<foreign>ach Gott</foreign>, what a supper without a Goody!) in writing against tomorrow. Besides, W. Fraser with his stupid dinner yesterday (at 7 o#x2019;clock, and in a tavern!) has almost killed me,&#x2014;figuratively speaking: for I woke today at four, and have had the vapours and the headaches all day. And, then, Badams is at Death#x2019;s door, out at Enfield; and his poor wife vehemently calls on John and me to come and help her: and out of charity what can I do but go over tomorrow at eleven. Thus everywhere is poor Goody shorn of her just rights, and nothing remains but the will for the act.</p>
<p>My <hi rend="italic">Ms</hi> is returned, as I expected: Rees<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Owen Rees (<date when="1770-00-00">1770</date>&#x2013;<date when="1837-00-00">1837</date>), who became a partner of Thomas Norton Longman (<date when="1771-00-00">1771</date>&#x2013;<date when="1842-00-00">1842</date>) in <date when="1794-00-00">1794</date>. At this time the firm was known as Longman, Rees, Orme, Brown and Green, 39 Paternoster Row.</note> says &#x201C;notwithstanding the high ability&#x201D; &#x26;c &#x26;c they decline the article. This was on Tuesday morning: an hour afterwards I had it over at Jeffrey#x2019;s, who I daresay has never looked on it: but what other could I do? I asked him to &#x201C;prophecy&#x201D; when he would likely be done with it; he said &#x201C;this week&#x201D;: so if he keep his promise, you may perhaps hear something next Letter. Nothing very favourable, I doubt: however, fear not my Darling! I have cast out fear: I feel that there <hi rend="italic">is work</hi> for me here; and one way or the other I shall have strength given me to do it. Stand by me, Darling, like my own Jane; like the descendant of John Knox,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Carlyles believed that Jane was directly descended from John Welsh (<date when="1568-00-00">1568</date>?&#x2013;<date when="1622-00-00">1622</date>), who had married Elizabeth Knox, third daughter of John Knox. This John Welsh was born in Colliston, bordering Craigenputtoch. See <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi>, I, 133&#x2013;34; Froude, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi>, I, 108&#x2013;9; but also see A. Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">CMSB</hi>, p. 27; and <ref target="volume-03/lt-18251128-TC-JBW-01"><sic>3:420</sic><corr>TC to JBW, <date when="1825-11-28">28 Nov. 1825</date></corr></ref>.</note> and the daughter of John Welsh, and the wife of Thomas Carlyle: what can daunt me? When I measure minds with these people here, I feel as if I <hi rend="italic">could</hi> sweep them into infinite space, with their errors and their basenesses, and make room for myself to do something better. But <hi rend="italic">with</hi> thee, with thee, O not <hi rend="italic">without</hi> thee!</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I have set William Fraser to work on other quarters of the Trade; chiefly to reconnoitre for tho#x2019; unspeakably willing, he <pb id="pg-05-363" n="05:363"/>can do nothing more; and tomorrow, at &#xBD; past 10, he is to report progress. He talks of grand possibilities: but I believe in nothing. &#x201C;Blessed are they which do not hope, for they shall not be disappointed.&#x201D; And yet, is there not something better in us than <hi rend="italic">lying</hi> Hope, namely a <hi rend="italic">true</hi> Hope? Forward, then, <foreign><hi rend="italic">getrosten Muthes</hi></foreign> [be of good cheer]!</p>
<p>Fraser#x2019;s dinner last night was a horror; for which the good youth must have paid some &#xa3;10! Otway Cave<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Otway Cave (<date when="1797-00-00">1797</date>&#x2013;<date when="1845-00-00">1845</date>), M.P. for Leicester (<date when="1826-00-00">1826</date>&#x2013;<date when="1830-00-00">30</date>), for Hastings (<date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>), and for Tipperary (<date when="1835-00-00">1835</date>&#x2013;<date when="1844-00-00">44</date>).</note> (Radical Parliamenteer) was there; one Churchill<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Churchill (dates unknown) had translated <hi rend="italic">Wallenstein#x2019;s Camp</hi> for <hi rend="italic">Fraser#x2019;s Magazine</hi>, II (<date when="1831-01-00">Jan. 1831</date>), 633&#x2013;65, and had been one of the contributors to Goethe#x2019;s seal. See <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310717-FEF-G-01"><sic>Fifteen English Friends to Goethe</sic><corr>FEF to G</corr>, [<date when="1831-07-17">17? July</date>]</ref>.</note> (a sort of Henry Inglis, reduced into a drunkard and Newspaper man); a literary Half-pay or two; the Bookseller Fraser; a long ladder of an Architect named something, who introduced a &#x201C;young French Man of Property,&#x201D; with which latter I conversed some minutes on the Saint-Simonians, of whom he knew next to nothing credible: all these crammed into a little apartment unvisited by any breath of wind; French dishes before them, French wines, and the jargon of Babel: <foreign><hi rend="italic">du lieber Gott</hi></foreign> [oh dear Lord]!&#x2014; I saw Fraser this morning who also complained, tho#x2019; we broke up a little after ten. Are not men mad?</p>
<p>Let me add here that Heraud is a little shabby Cockney with next to nothing in him, but some burbles of Coleridgian Metaphysics, and the feeblest vein of <foreign><hi rend="italic">Wahrheitsinn</hi></foreign> [sense of truth] manifesting itself unprofitably enough. Some little might be made of him, and but a little. Irving, whom I see almost daily (for we are near, and he calls), is bent upon having me remodel Fraser#x2019;s Magazine, sweep it clean, and become Editor of it: and in spite of all my negations insists on sounding the poor Youth, an honest ignoramus of his Congregation, who is like to lose &#xa3;2,000 by it, if mercy prevent not. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Davon wird nichts</hi></foreign>[Nothing will come of it]. Heraud also is for a &#x201C;new periodical&#x201D;: poor little body he has a wife and children to support by his scribble; lives eight miles out of town, and looks greasy and forlorn enough. The materials of any good among the Litterateurs of this city lie scantily dispersed: such a scandalous set of dogs out of Tophet I should be puzzled where to meet with. The more need of an <hi rend="italic">honest</hi> one, were it but by way of variety.</p>
<p>Of Jeffrey I may repeat that I can get little good: he really has no leisure to think of anything but his politics; so that I never get the <pb id="pg-05-364" n="05:364"/>smallest private talk with him. Indeed, how can he help me? Where, then, lies our help, Dearest? Be God thanked, with ourselves!&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>
<p>Thursday Morning. News of supper came last night at this point (for I write up stairs and need <hi rend="italic">news</hi> of everything); so that I was obliged to desist; and finding there the young man named Glen,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Glen (<date when="1803-00-00">1803</date>&#x2013;<date when="1852-00-00">52</date>), student of Glasgow University, one of two sons of Archibald Glen (<date when="1774-00-00">1774</date>&#x2013;<date when="1808-00-00">1808</date>), minister of Parton, Kirkcudbright. Carlyle wrote: &#x201C;Glen &#x2026; was a young graduate of Glasgow studying law in London, of very considerable though utterly confused talent. Ultimately went mad, and was boarded in a farmhouse near Craigenputtock, within reach of us, where in seven or eight years he died&#x201D; (Froude, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi>, II,. 200).</note> could not get up again. Glen I may write or repeat is the hopefullest fellow I have seen in London; an authentic &#x201C;young man of genius,&#x201D; full of fire and love; whom I am sure you will approve of; were it only on this one ground, that he is my Disciple, by far the best I have ever had.</p>
<p>This morning, I feel better:&#x2014; O how is <hi rend="italic">she?</hi> Surely the Letter will tell me at night.&#x2014; I had much rather stay from Badams#x2019;s but must not. Fraser being hourly expected, I must hasten to say my say out.</p>
<p>Touching myself there is little or nothing more, except that I have written to the Bullers, signifying that in case <hi rend="italic">you</hi> came hither, it was not impossible that we might whirl down to Cornwall, and see what they were doing: for the rest I left it quite open, without <hi rend="italic">promise</hi>.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mrs. Buller had written on <date when="1831-08-16">16 Aug.</date>: &#x201C;I take it for granted M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle is not with you as you do not mention her, but if she is I need hardly say it would much increase our happiness at seeing you, if she could accompany you.&#x201D;</note></p>
<p>Of Jack I have great news. He is actually engaged as Travelling Physician to the Countess of Clare, at a salary of 300 guineas (all expenses paid); and commences his engagement on the <date when="1831-10-01">first of October</date>! It was settled yesterday morning; I must write my Mother to explain it, and comfort her; for she will have a thousand apprehensions. As to myself, I am both glad and <foreign>wae</foreign>: everybody here seems to think it a piece of very good fortune, and the only reasonable outlook our Doctor has or ever had for settling in London. Dr Holland began in that way, and now makes (they say) &#xa3;10,000 a year. Whether Jack will ever be rich I know not and care not: but I really conceive that with a fair beginning he will make a <hi rend="italic">good</hi> Physician; and after all kicking and flinging become a respectable man.</p>
<p>And now for Jeannie herself. I am very anxious to hear your voice on the London Journey scheme. Would it be any <hi rend="italic">enjoyment</hi> to you, or the contrary? The costs of it in other respects I can partly compute: not in this. Be candid with me, Dearest; we <hi rend="italic">can</hi> manage the business: <pb id="pg-05-365" n="05:365"/>why not speak out, and say I should <hi rend="italic">like</hi> it so and so.&#x2014; Our Lodgings here have various qualities: fresh air, honest landlordship, especially cheapness. Tho#x2019; we pay 26/ for the mere rooms, yet our <hi rend="italic">whole</hi> expences [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] (for John and me) do not exceed two guineas; less almost than it used to cost myself. The reason is, we have an <hi rend="italic">honest</hi> maid-servant, who keeps an eye on overchargers, above all does not overcharge herself. With you here, there were much improvement possible; for my Jeannie carries Order and Gracefulness with her: neither, I think, would you find it very uncomfortable; unless the noises afflicted you (they begin about 7, and end not till 11 at night): yet surely you could sleep fast and safe in my arms. Could you not?&#x2014; I inquired yesterday into Fraser#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">House:</hi> it is a delightfully quiet place, quite near the Jeffreys#x2019;s: but only the <hi rend="italic">half</hi> of it belongs to Fraser; and his rent with the <hi rend="italic">half</hi>-keep of two servants amounts to &#xa3;150 per annum; the house <hi rend="italic">unfurnished</hi>! To ask it for less, <hi rend="italic">furnished</hi> would be unreasonable: so that for two good reasons it simply <hi rend="italic">will not do</hi>. As yet therefore Lodgings were the only way of it; and no Lodgings I have met with are equal to these. Speak then, Lovekin; speak with thy prophetic voice! Will it do, or how <hi rend="italic">should</hi> it be,&#x2014;if I be kept here say a month still, as is quite possible? <foreign><hi rend="italic">Ach Gott!</hi></foreign> A whole month from my Own. And would you stand better in your loneliness? Worse, if possible. O my own Dearest Jeannie, my own Wife, God bless thee, and keep thee for me! I never knew how I loved thee till now. Yes, one day I shall tell thee, thou hast borne me thro#x2019; all, and stood ever by my side, as a true Life-companion, and helper in this otherwise so despicable world. But I am a fool; and <hi rend="italic">talk</hi> what I should only feel, and act upon. Know thus much of a truth; thou art dearer to me than aught else; forever dearer to me than the light to my eyes. And be proud of it; as the wife of a &#x201C;Genius&#x201D; should, when she is a <hi rend="italic">Wife</hi> to him. Lastly write, write, O write abundantly, were it the merest prattle, it is better to me than all eloquence. And so God bless thee! And take my kiss, and <foreign><hi rend="italic">Lebewohl</hi></foreign> [Farewell], and expect to hear from me again on Wednesday, and think of me every hour and moment of thy life, and be a good <foreign>lassie</foreign>, and I will be good to thee and thy own, and we shall be, if not happy, blessed which is better. Amen!</p>
<p>Fraser still lingers, but we can wait few moments longer for him. He takes great trouble with me, and really loves me. Poor fellow! Always unfortunate. The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Review</hi>, he says, will bring him a pure <hi rend="italic">loss</hi> of at least &#xa3;1,000! And now he is electioneering; and likely to lose again.&#x2014; By the bye I mistook his eyes, that day: They are of a <pb id="pg-05-366" n="05:366"/>pure hazel (not blue or grey) and always smile with a weak kind smile.</p>
<p>How do you do for <hi rend="italic">tobacco?</hi> The stuff is very bad here, none at all equal to Mundells: and, far worse, no Goody to take the <hi rend="italic">three</hi>,<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mundell was a tobacconist of High St., Dumfries. &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Three</hi>&#x201D;: puffs from the pipe.</note> and then kiss me!&#x2014; God send us soon to one another#x2019;s arms! Yes, long it shall not be; for living without thee is but half a life. <closer><salute>Farewell my own Jeannie! Forever thy own Husband,</salute></closer></p>

<p>I flatter myself you have heard pretty minute accounts of my arrival and proceedings here; for I both desired Jane to write and wrote myself a little line which I think you would receive yesterday by the hands of Notman. But this evening, as I have a little time, and some prospect of a frank tomorrow, I will send you a few lines direct; well knowing that few things could be more welcome to you. Of your own welfare I hear but very brief accounts, and can only pray and hope that all may be right: Jane informs me yesterday that you and the girls were seen at Lockerby Lamb Fair, apparently in health; for which piece of news, meagre as it is, let me be thankful. If I am to continue any time here, which seems not unlikely, <hi rend="italic">Jean</hi>, my kind serviceable Correspondent must take pen in hand, and transmit me the produce, either directly; or if she cannot manage to fill a sheet, round by Craigenputtoch whence it will come <hi rend="italic">free</hi>, and be heartily welcome were it never so brief.</p>
<p>As Jack proposes writing my Father tomorrow by this conveyance, doubtless he will mention the good tidings he has to tell: namely of an appointment to be Travelling Physician to a Lady of great rank, the Countess of Clare, with a salary of 300 guineas a year all travelling expences included. This is the work of the Lord Advocate Jeffrey; and is looked on by every one as a piece of real good fortune. For yourself, my Dear Mother, I know how you dislike foreign voyaging, <pb id="pg-05-367" n="05:367"/>and that all your maternal fears will be awakened by this arrangement. However, you too will reflect that anything in honesty is better than forced <hi rend="italic">idleness</hi>, which was poor Doil#x2019;s condition here: also you may take my word for it that the dangers of such a Course of Travel are altogether trifling; not equal to those of walking the London Streets, and running every time you cross lest Coaches break a limb of you. The Lady herself is an invalid, and <hi rend="italic">must</hi> journey with every convenience; Italy (whither they are bound) is the finest of climates; and the <hi rend="italic">sailing</hi> part of it is simply of three hours continuance, in whole, <hi rend="italic">twenty-five miles</hi>. I have seen some people who know the Countess; and all give her a good character: she is young (perhaps 33); courteous, and has behaved in this transaction with great liberality. Jack also is much more prudent and manly in his ways than he was: so that I think there is a fair prospect of his even doing the poor Lady some good, and getting into a friendly relation to her, which also may eventually do himself much good. Something mysterious there is in the condition of this high personage: she was married some years ago; and shortly after that event, she parted from her husband (they say by her own determination), the nearest friends know not for what reason; and now she lives in a sort of widowhood (her husband is Governor of Bombay in India and said to be &#x201C;a very good sort of man&#x201D;); so that being farther in ill health, she is probably unhappy enough; and has need of good counsel every way.</p>
<p>It is calculated that if Jack can secure any favour with her, she may be of vast importance to him subsequently in settling here as Doctor: these things all go by recommendation; and some Physicians of the highest practice in London began precisely in the same way. Indeed without an independent fortune to start with, there seems to be no other way of beginning. I am also more and more of opinion that Jack has the materials of a Good Doctor and good man in him, and will one day show this, if he be spared alive, to the whole world. So that, in any case, I think we are to regard this as a setting of his &#x201C;foot fairly on the fog <supplied>[moss]</supplied>&#x201D;; <note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle means that Jack has made a good start in life.</note> after which let us see what waygate [progress] he will make. Therefore do not afflict yourself, dear Mother; but thank God for His great goodness, and commit, as is your wont, the issues to Him, in whose Hand we are all, and thro#x2019; Eternity shall be.</p>
<p>And now I must tell you a little about my own doings. The business of the Book proceeds but crabbedly: the whole English world, <pb id="pg-05-368" n="05:368"/>I find, has ceased to read Books of late; which as I often say to the Booksellers is the wisest thing the English world could do, considering what wretched froth it has been dosed with for many years under the false title of &#x201C;Books.&#x201D; Every mind is engrossed with Political questions, and in a more earnest mood than to put up with such stuff as has been called Literature. Meanwhile, tho#x2019; I cannot but rejoice in this state of public opinion, yet the consequences to myself are far from favourable. The present too, I find, is the deadest part of the whole year for business: so that every way the matter moves heavily; and I require to have my own shoulder at it always, or it would not move at all. Hitherto I have made no approximation to a bargain; except finding that man after man will not <hi rend="italic">act</hi>, and only at best demands &#x201C;time for consideration&#x201D;; which except in very limited measure I cannot afford to give him. The Manuscript is at present in Jeffrey#x2019;s hands, whence I expect to receive it in some two days, with a favourable or at worst unfavourable judgement; in either of which cases I shall find out what to do. Little money, I think, will be had for my work: but I will have it printed if there be a man in London that will do it, even without payment to myself: if there be no such man, why then what is to be done, but tie a piece of good <foreign><hi rend="italic">Skeenyie</hi></foreign> [packthread] about my Papers, stick the whole in my pocket, and march home again with it, where at least potatoes and onions are to be had, and I can wait till better times. Nay, in any case, I find that, either in possession or pretty certain expectation, I am otherwise worth almost &#xa3;100 of cash: so that while the whinstone House stands in the moor, what care I for one of them, or for all of them, with the Arch Enemy at their head?</p>
<p>Of my permanent settlement here there is as yet nothing definite to be said. I see many persons here, some of them kind and influential, almost all of them ignorant enough, and in need of a Teacher: but no offer that can be laid hold of presents itself, or fixedly promises itself. This also I will see thro#x2019;. If God who made me and keeps me alive, have work for me here, then here must I pitch my tent: if not, then elsewhere; still under His kind sky, under His All-seeing Eye: to me alike where. I am rather resolute sometimes, not without a touch of grimness; but never timid or discouraged: indeed generally quite quite and cheerful. If I see no way of getting home soon, I have some thoughts of bringing Jane up hither, for she must be very lonely where she is. We shall see.</p>
<p>One thing we have reason to be glad of: our good lodgings. We are in George Irving#x2019;s house; one of the healthiest, pleasantest situations <pb id="pg-05-369" n="05:369"/>in London; and far the cheapest I was ever in,&#x2014;for this reason, that his Housekeeper is not <hi rend="italic">thief</hi>. We can both live here, for very little more than it used to cost one of us, even me who am the thriftier. It is a sort of right-angled street (shaped like a joiner#x2019;s square), thro#x2019; which there is no passage for carriages, for one part of it is flagged quite across: we live very near the <hi rend="italic">Corner</hi> of the street; from which looking out of this window (along one of the arms of the square) I see into one of the most crowded thoroug<supplied>[h]</supplied>fares in London, and a perpetual <hi rend="italic">torrent</hi> of Carriages pouring by: the other arm, which I must poke out my head to look along, leads into quiet Squares (such as Tavistock) where are green spaces and trees. The houses about us are all clean shops, and I look (from this upper bedroom where I generally write) over their roofs, and see the top of St. Pancras#x2019; Steeple, with its silent carved-work and stone cross, and the beautiful dappled <date when="1831-08-00">August</date> sky stre<supplied>[t]</supplied>ching out above it. Downwards into the street stands one object at which I know not whether to laugh or cry: it is a huge sign bearing these words: &#x201C;the cheapest shop in the world for Combs and Brushes&#x201D;; and, alas, the <hi rend="italic">window is shut</hi>, and this cheapest Shopkeeper has bankraped and gone out of sight!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech. In Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi>, I, 4, Carlyle says that &#x201C;And then he bankrapit, and geed out o#x2019; sicht&#x201D; was an expression of his father#x2019;s used in one of his &#x201C;little sketches of Annandale biography.&#x201D;</note> Some courageous Adventurer he was doubtless, that staked his little all here in this huge Lottery; and lost it. The best concerted schemes of mice and men <foreign>gang oft aglee</foreign>!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Burns, &#x201C;To a Mouse,&#x201D; stanza 7.</note></p>
<p>I have seen the Stracheys (Mrs Strachey has long been unhealthy, and looks weakened and secluded): the Bullers pressingly invite me down to Cornwall. I find the Montagues all at sixes and sevens; very unprofitable to me, and irritated beyond all just measure at Badams. Poor Badams himself is far from well in any sense, yet I hope he will get round, both in body and mind: Jack and I were at his House (ten miles off in the Country) yesternight and returned today; where I took better hope of him than I had formerly; and found at all events much cause to love him and pity him. For the rest of my Friends here I must wait till I have more space of paper: or far better, till you can hear it all by word of mouth.</p>
<p>Thus, my dear Mother, does it stand with us: I write you all this to satisfy your anxieties. Be of good cheer: trust for us, as for all things, in the Giver of Good, who will order <hi rend="italic">all</hi> things <hi rend="italic">well</hi>.&#x2014;&#x2014; Had not Jack been writing to my Father, this Letter had perhaps been <pb id="pg-05-370" n="05:370"/>addressed to <hi rend="italic">him;</hi> or at least some Brother to accompany it. Assure him of my entire love; and say that I hope to tell him many things when I return. I have heard of Jamie, and fancy that Alick also is with you: my kindest love to all; not forgetting Jean or <hi rend="italic">any</hi> of the girls. God keep you and all of them! That is ever my heart#x2019;s prayer. Many times, too, does <hi rend="italic">she</hi><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >His sister Margaret, who had died on <date when="1830-06-22">22 June 1830</date>.</note> that is not now with us any more, revisit my thoughts; inexpressibly sad, inexpressibly mild: but I mourn not, I rather rejoice that <hi rend="italic">she</hi> is now safe, in the Land of Eternity, not in the troublous ever-shifting Land of Time and of Dreams. Oh often I think that she is <hi rend="italic">with</hi> me, in my heart, whispering to me, to bear and forbear even as she did; to endure to the end, and then we shall meet <hi rend="italic">again</hi>, and part no more. Even as God will, be it!</p>
<p>I conclude mournfully, but not unhappily. Shall not the great Father wipe away the tears from all eyes?<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Isaiah 25:8.</note> Again and again I say, let us trust in Him, and Him only.&#x2014; Nay is it not a great mercy, the most precious mercy that so many of us are yet spared together to see good. Let us ever live in Hope, in Faith! God bless you all! I am ever, Dear Mother, <closer><salute>Your affectionate Son,</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle&#x2014;</name></p>

<p>No letter yesterday! But this time I am sure it is lying for me, and I do what I can to be patient&#x2014; Yet never before was I so fully sensible to the misfortune of living sixteen miles from a post office&#x2014; Here must I write for the third time, in the dark as it were&#x2014;and <hi rend="italic">you</hi> get no answer but at random as if you talked with one deaf&#x2014; It is very hard yet what can one make of it&#x2014; Withhold from the wretch of a Carrier his occasional sixpence; and no further does our power reach either to remedy or revenge.</p>
<p>I know not what Betty was thinking of yesterday but she made up my bed with the whole four pillows as if it had been for two&#x2014; I was so <foreign>wae</foreign> to see it, and could not have the heart to throw out the two I did not need&#x2014;and got little or no sleep in consequence&#x2014; I do not like to say how much I weary for you; lest I make you too impatient under these unavoidable delays&#x2014;but in truth it is very lonely here <pb id="pg-05-371" n="05:371"/>for <hi rend="italic">one</hi>&#x2014; The weather too is become rather gloomy&#x2014;dark and drizzly and chill&#x2014; However I keep good fires (Alick brought two carts of coals before he went away) and need not complain of the weather as it agrees with my health better than the intense heat did&#x2014;</p>
<p>Robert did not come yesterday (on account of the rain I suppose) and neither did Isabella <hi rend="italic">go</hi>&#x2014;but she will not be persuaded to stay after the first dry day.</p>
<p>I wonder what answer you will make to my last&#x2014; &#x2018;Come#x2019;? What a mightiest of earthquakes would that word be the signal for! &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">Stay</hi>#x2019;?

<salute>Dearest Wife,</salute>
<p>This is Monday; and I have already, taking no counsel with flesh and blood, discharged two little Duties: first, gone and seen Empson (whom I had heretofore missed) <hi rend="italic">before</hi> breakfast; second, arranged my washerwoman#x2019;s goods, and made an invoice thereof that she may call for them; which Duty it were my dear Goody#x2019;s part to do, were I not for a time goodyless:&#x2014;so that now, at noontide, I can sit down with a clear conscience, and talk heartily and heartsomely with my own Child about all things and about nothing, as is my wont and my <pb id="pg-05-373" n="05:373"/>delight. Thus in this spectre-crowded Desart, I have a living Person, whose heart I can clasp to mine, and so feel that I too am alive. Do you not love me better than ever, now? I feel in my own soul that thou dost and must: therefore let us never mourn over this little separation, which is but to make the reunion more blessed and entire.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Froude omits the rest of this paragraph.</note> I tell thee, my Dearest, thou art my own Wife, and I love thee more than all the world, and will forever love thee, and wear thee in my heart of hearts.&#x2014; Is this like taking up with other women? &#x201C;OTHER&#x201D; Women! <foreign><hi rend="italic">Ach Gott</hi></foreign> [Oh, Lord]!</p>
<p>Your two Letters are here in due season: like Angels (<hi rend="italic">Angel</hi> means heavenly <hi rend="italic">messenger</hi>) from a far country. The first, as I prophecied, lay waiting for me at my return: the second I found lying on the Duke#x2019;s table on saturday [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>], and snatched it up from the claws of the &#x201C;Twopennies,&#x201D; and read it in the hubbub of Piccadilly, so soon as I could tear myself out into the solitude of crowds. Bless thee, my Darling! I could almost wish thee the pain of a ride to Dumfries weekly for the sake of such a Letter. But <hi rend="italic">had</hi> you actually to faint and retch all the way up? Heaven forbid! it were too bad. And the &#x201C;disease&#x201D; on that fair face, how is it? If no better, never mind; I swear that it shall and will get better; or if it do not, that I will love you more than ever while it lasts. Will that make amends? It is no vain parade of rhetoric; it is a serious <hi rend="italic">fact:</hi> my love for you does not depend on looks; and defies old age and decay; and, I can prophecy will grow stronger the longer we live and toil lovingly together. Yes, Jeannie, tho#x2019; I have brought you into rough rugged conditions, I feel that I have <hi rend="italic">saved</hi> you: as Gigmanness you could not have lived; as Woman and Wife you need but to see your duties in order to do them, and to say from the heart: It is good for me to be here. So keep thy arms round me, and be my own Prophetess and second Self, and fear nothing, let the Devil do his very worst.</p>
<p>Poor Elizabeth!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >One of Jane#x2019;s paternal aunts.</note> I fear, as you fear, that it is not well with her: nevertheless, who knows the issues of Life and Death? Let us hope the best. Above all, do not you be a coward: I love you for your <hi rend="italic">bravery</hi>, and because you have the heart of a valiant woman. O my Darling, is it conceivable that we should live divided in this unfriendly scene! Crown me with all laurels that ever decorated man#x2019;s brow; were it other than the bitterest of bitter mockeries, if she who had struggled with me, were not there to share it? O merciful God!&#x2014; But let us trust in His mercy, let us be united in submission, in <pb id="pg-05-374" n="05:374"/>reverence, to the Highest; and live here as in the Place of Hope! Are we not <hi rend="italic">alive</hi>; has not God hitherto been good to us? Has He not given us one another?&#x2014;</p>
<p>I grieve to figure you <hi rend="italic">alone</hi>, this week, as I doubt you are: poor Miss Macturk was still something better than bare walls. Perverse enough is it too that Harry#x2019;s sides are not roadworthy yet: I could then conceive you gallopping [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] over to Templand when the solitude grew insupportable. However, after all, Patience is the best. Possess thy soul in patience. Time brings roses: brings <hi rend="italic">us</hi> together again! Then O then&#x2014;!</p>
<p>But I must check this lyrical tendency; so fast is my Paper waning. Of History indeed there is little to be told: slowly, slowly does the business of poor <hi rend="italic">Dreck</hi> get along let me push it as I may. Heaven bless my own Prophetess, who has from the first prophecied only good of it. Yes, good <hi rend="italic">will</hi> come of it, for it was honestly meant, and the best we could do. Meanwhile do but mark how sluggishly it loiters.</p>
<p>On Thursday, as indicated, we set off to Badams; and finding no Coach had to walk the whole distance, some twelve miles. Badams was considerably better, I had much talk with him, saw his house, taken but not entered upon; one of the nicest situations, and the cheapest I have met with in this neighbourhood: his large sufficient house with shrubberies, offices, garden &#x26;c will cost less than &#xa3;20. Were there such another in Enfield, I should be tempted to lay hold of it for a year (had <hi rend="italic">she</hi> once seen it and approved of it): but there is not such another, and this is a mere lucky chance, having stood unoccupied for four years, and the owner eager to let it. Badams seemed to me a man of whom was still great hope; neither can I reckon him <hi rend="italic">worse</hi> than I anticipated but better: the Montagues, I cannot but think, are very savage to him; they alone, he says, of 150 persons concerned in these misfortunes have turned an evil eye on him. He resents it not, except by silence and forgivenness [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>]: I think you will like him, and he is prepared to like you. But, alas, a fearful possibility lies in the matter that his Bodily constitution may be altogether ruined, and his heart broken by these past torments. He, with his customary vehemence, had renounced brandy (which he took to relieve him first from a horrible <foreign><hi rend="italic">tic do</hi><supplied>[<hi rend="italic">u</hi>]</supplied><hi rend="italic">loureux</hi></foreign>)<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Facial neuralgia accompanied by darting pains and muscular twitchings.</note> totally and at once the day we arrived: on Sunday morning (yesterday) came <hi rend="italic">two</hi> Expresses one galloping for Jack to hasten out directly &#x201C;for God#x2019;s sake&#x201D;; Jack was off before I got out of bed, or of sleep; and I have <pb id="pg-05-375" n="05:375"/>heard no more of him since. Poor Badams! But my theory is that this may be a return of the <foreign><hi rend="italic">tic;</hi></foreign> and that the perhaps excess of alarm may proceed from his Wife, who loves him tenderly, has little experience, immense vehemence; and herself labours (as he tells me) under a painful, irritating, incurable malady. Poor creatures! they are a care to me among so much other care.</p>
<p>They had provided beds for us (they live at present in lodgings) and would not hear of our going that night. I thought of Goody#x2019;s Letter lying silent on the table: and resisted to the very verge of unfriendliness; but being deserted of Jack was forced to give in. We saw Charlie Lamb (<hi rend="italic">Elia</hi>) at tea: a miserable, drink-besotted, spindle-shanked skeleton of a body; whose &#x201C;humour,&#x201D; as it is called, seemed to me neither more nor less than a fibre of genius shining thro#x2019; positive delirium and crackbrainedness (<foreign><hi rend="italic">verr&#xfc;cktheit</hi></foreign>), and would be to me the most intolerable of all nuisances.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Although this and almost all later references by Carlyle to Lamb are unfavorable, there is a passage in a letter from Alexander Carlyle to C. E. Norton, <date when="1898-07-08">8 July 1898</date> (MS: Houghton Library, Harvard), which does something to make amends: &#x201C;I remember my wife telling me that she once read to her Uncle, as they lingered over dinner, Lamb#x2019;s &#x2018;Old Familiar Faces.#x2019; He listened attentively, and when she had finished he asked, &#x2018;Who wrote <hi rend="italic">that</hi>, Mary?#x2019; She told him, and he replied, &#x2018;I should not have believed Lamb could ever have written any thing so touching &#x26; pretty.#x2019; The truth is that Lamb disgusted him at that interview at Enfield and he disregarded both Lamb and his writings ever afterwards.&#x201D;</note> Next noon we were at home, and found the dear Goody<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jane#x2019;s letter.</note> waiting for us. Fraser, who was to sound Colbourn [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>]<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henry Colburn, publisher.

I have not yet been near them; and, as you shall see, cannot well go.</p>
<p>Next morning after entertaining a certain Dr F&#xfc;ssli (nephew of Fuseli the late Artist)<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henry Fuseli (Johann Heinrich Fuessli) (<date when="1741-00-00">1741</date>&#x2013;<date when="1825-00-00">1825</date>), painter and author, born in Switzerland, first came to England in <date when="1763-00-00">1763</date>. He was a friend of Blake. The nephew was the son of this Fuseli#x2019;s elder or younger brother and is not exactly identified.</note> from Z&#xfc;rich, who at breakfast said innumerable things about &#x201C;ta frend of Goethe&#x201D;; about &#x201C;my Lady,&#x201D; and our &#x201C;Landseat&#x201D; &#x26;c, and was indeed a very warm-hearted looking fellow,&#x2014;I wended on to Mrs Kater#x2019;s;<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> delivered Mrs Richardson#x2019;s Letter with my card, learned that &#x201C;the family was daily expected from the Continent&#x201D;; and then after a four miles#x2019; voyage of discovery landed at the Dukes, <pb id="pg-05-376" n="05:376"/>forced my way up stairs, tho#x2019; none but &#x201C;sayme relish&#x201D;<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Jeffrey.</note> was there; and found my own Letter lying, the first thing I set eyes on. My errand had been twofold, to hear of Dreck, and get a frank for my Father: neither of which was now possible. On the morrow, however, (that is yesterday) I returned: found the family Coach at the door, and all in the act of drawing on gloves to go out, except the Duke; with whom after some gabblement with the others, I had the unwonted satisfaction of a private conversation&#x2014;for ten minutes. The poor little dear is so hurried he cannot help it; besides he has little or nothing to <hi rend="italic">say</hi> that were of moment.&#x2014; Inquiring for Teufel<hi rend="italic">k</hi> as I was privileged to do, the Critic professed that he had &#x201C;honestly read&#x201D; 28 pages of it (surprising feat!) that he objected to the dilatoriness of the introductory part (as <hi rend="italic">we</hi> both did also), and very much admired the scene of the sleeping City: farther that he would write to Murray that very day (as I gather from Empson he has since done) to appoint a meeting with him, and if possible attain some <hi rend="italic">finish</hi> with that individual at least.<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jeffrey did write to Murray on <date when="1831-08-28">28 Aug.</date>, asking: &#x201C;Will you favour me with a few minutes conversation any morning this week (the early part of it, if possible) on the subject of my friend Carlyle#x2019;s projected publication. I have looked a little into the M.S. and can tell you something.&#x2014;&#x201D; (MS: John Murray, Publisher).</note> He (Jeffrey) would look thro#x2019; the Book farther in the interim &#x26;c &#x26;c. Alas! What could I do, but consent to let him <hi rend="italic">have</hi> that &#x201C;other week,&#x201D; tho#x2019; nigh <hi rend="italic">three</hi> are now gone, and next to no way made, beyond ascertaining that way is highly difficult to make. Patience! Patience! He shall have till Sunday: on Wednesday morning I will show myself (also for <hi rend="italic">your</hi> frank,&#x2014;and your Letter!) thereby to fillip him; and so at last we shall see what he makes of it. Hard times for literary men!&#x2014; (Confound all these pens! saw you ever such? And to fail me even <hi rend="italic">now</hi>, with my knife blunt!)&#x2014; Hard times, I said, Dearest, for Literary men: nevertheless let us take them as they come. Nay, Allan Cunningham advises me that it were almost &#x201C;madness&#x201D; to press forward a literary work at this so inauspicious season, and not to wait for a while. Which nevertheless I cannot listen to. Why wait? <foreign><hi rend="italic">Rusticus expectat</hi></foreign> [The countryman waits]:<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Horace, <hi rend="italic">Epistles</hi>, I, ii, 42.</note> besides <hi rend="italic">Dreck</hi> must be <hi rend="italic">printed</hi> as the first condition; whether we get any money for him, or how much is a quite secondary question. I have nothing for it but to <hi rend="italic">try</hi>, try to the uttermost; and in the villainous interval of expectation to explore this wild immeasurable chaos, and ascertain whether I can build aught in it. Such remains my outlook <pb id="pg-05-377" n="05:377"/>hitherto. Jeffrey and I also spoke about the &#x201C;place under Government.&#x201D; <foreign><hi rend="italic">Davon wird Nichis</hi></foreign> [Nothing will come of it]. &#x201C;All filled up&#x201D;; &#x201C;applicants&#x201D;; &#x201C;economical Ministry&#x201D; &#x26;c &#x26;c: all which the Devil is welcome to, if he like. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Aide-toi, le ciel t#x2019;aidera</hi></foreign> [Help yourself, heaven will help you]. I think of these things with considerable composure; at times with a certain silent ferocity. &#x201C;That <hi rend="italic">my</hi> Wife should walk on foot!&#x201D; Yet is she not my Wife, and shall I not love her the more, that she shares evil with me as if it were good? Let us fear nothing, Lovekin: I have the strength of twenty thousand Cockneys; while thou art with me. Let hard come to hard, as it will; we will study to be ready for it.</p>
<p>Meanwhile hear what farther surveys I have made. On friday [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] came a Note from the noble lady; inquiring after <hi rend="italic">you</hi> (she had &#x201C;written you a Letter calling for a speedy answer&#x201D; and was anxious &#x26;c); also apologising to me for Montague#x2019;s excessive occupancy, and finishing with a general invitation to breakfast. I called next day, in returning from the Duke#x2019;s; mentioned the purport of her &#x201C;anxious letter&#x201D; to you with the indifference which so insignificant a proposal merited: withal assuring her that you <hi rend="italic">would</hi> most probably be here, and were not in use to keep any secret for me, not even for the purpose of &#x201C;surprises.&#x201D; The rest of our conversation turned on the signs of the times, and was trivial enough. Poor noble Lady, so <hi rend="italic">lonely</hi> in her old days, and nothing but a little edge-gilding of &#x201C;Sentiment&#x201D; to beautify her lot! I grieve for the disappointment that awaits you: except in the way of helping <hi rend="italic">her</hi>, there can no relation spring up between you. Montague#x2019;s is like a House of Atreus; a curse seems to rest on it; all things go round and round.<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310811-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1831-08-11">11 Aug.</date></ref></note> His sons are all mad, or worse than in madhouses, namely devil-possessed <hi rend="italic">villains</hi>. God pity them! My Goody is not for such a brotherhood. I learned however that Anne Procter will be home tomorrow: with her you can communicate; for like yourself (unlike in many other points) she <hi rend="italic">will</hi> not lie.</p>
<p>On Sunday night I walked over to Allan Cunningham#x2019;s; was warmly welcomed, with inquiries enough for the &#x201C;Lady at the Hill top&#x201D;; talked all and sundry for two hours, and then was led (not of the spirit, but of Allan) up to the renowned Dylk#x2019;s (who had expressed a wish to meet me again); declined roast-veal and wine from his laughing pudding of a Wife; declined dining there on Tuesday night; agreed to drink tea then; and so Allan escorting me thro#x2019; the <pb id="pg-05-378" n="05:378"/>Park, returned home, to muse on human disappointments, and go sulkily to my <hi rend="italic">solitary</hi> bed; no Goody to say Let me sleep in thy arms!&#x2014; I may add that I found Mrs Gray<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably the wife of William Gray. See <ref target="volume-05/lt-18300211-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1830-02-11">11 Feb. 1830</date></ref>.</note> at Allan#x2019;s; a prodigiously fine Lady, speaking &#x201C;Dock English,&#x201D;<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Clipped, mincing.</note> and rather detested by Allan. Happily she soon went away. The young couple promise to return but are not believed. It seems to be calculated that the whole batch are journeying Devilward; under mutual vituperations and vexations. Gray does nothing; dangles on Newspaper Editings a mere onlooker; his Wife is a &#x201C;girl.&#x201D; <foreign><hi rend="italic">Schade um ihn</hi></foreign> [Too bad about him]!</p>
<p>But of all the deplorables and despicables of this City and time the saddest are the &#x201C;literary men.&#x201D; <foreign><hi rend="italic">Infandum! Infandum!</hi></foreign> [Unspeakable! Unspeakable!] It makes my heart sick and <foreign>wae</foreign>. Except the &#x201C;drunken Henry Inglis&#x201D; (Churchill)<note n="15" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310824-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1831-08-24">24 Aug.</date></ref></note> and perhaps chiefly because he liked <hi rend="italic">me</hi>,&#x2014;I have hardly found a man of common sense or common honesty! They are the Devil#x2019;s own vermin, whom the Devil in his good time will snare and successively eat. The creature Heraud called again; the most insignificant <hi rend="italic">haddock</hi> in nature; a dirty greasy Cockney-apprentice; altogether empty and non-extant except for one or two metaphysical quibbles (about &#x201C;every Law<hi rend="italic">r</hi> of Nature being an idea<hi rend="italic">r</hi> of the mind &#x26;c&#x201D;) and the completest outfit of innocent, bland self-conceit I ever in life chanced to witness. <hi rend="italic">He</hi> is a blown bladder, wherein no substance is to be sought. And yet a curious figure: intrinsically <hi rend="italic">small</hi>, small; yet with a <hi rend="italic">touch</hi> of geniality, which far apart from Coleridge and Cockneyism might have made him a small <hi rend="italic">reality</hi>. God be with him! He was almost as wearisome as &#x201C;Chrayst&#x201D;;<note n="16" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310824-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1831-08-24">24 Aug.</date>]</ref>.</note> and <hi rend="italic">very much detached</hi>, as it struck me; knew nothing of men or things more than a sucking dove: at the same time, looked out with an occasional gleam of geniality in his eyes; seemed even to like me, tho#x2019; I had barbarously enough entreated him<supplied>[.]</supplied></p>
<p>The more comfortable was it to meet Empson this morning; in whom I at least found <hi rend="italic">sanity</hi>, and what I have all along had to dispense with, the bearing of at least a <hi rend="italic">gentleman</hi>. I am glad I went to Empson. I thought this morning when I awoke about eight: now would not <hi rend="italic">she</hi> advise thee to go out, and <hi rend="italic">do</hi> this work, which seems to lie nearest? I went accordingly, thro#x2019; two miles of tumultuous streets; found Empson in the solitude of the Temple, reading a Newspaper in a flannel Nightgown (which reminded me of Goody#x2019;s <pb id="pg-05-379" n="05:379"/>for it had a <hi rend="italic">belt;</hi> only it was all twice as large); who welcomed me in his choicest mood. A tall broad thin man with wrinkled face, baldish head, and large mild melancholy dreamy blue-eyes under bushy brows: more like Johnstone of Grange (only much looser) than any man you know. He has a defect in his <hi rend="italic">trachea</hi> (save the mark!) and can only mumble in speech, which he does with great copiousness, in a very kindly style, confused enough; at the same time listening with the profoundest attention and toleration in whatever you offer in reply. He is, as I thought, in the <hi rend="italic">threshold</hi> of mysticism; but I think will go deeper. Probably enough one might grow to like such a man; at all events I will try: and so I think will you; with your Mother (were she more cultivated, or he more ignorant) he were the man according to God#x2019;s heart. Of young Mill<note n="17" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Stuart Mill (<date when="1806-00-00">1806</date>&#x2013;<date when="1873-00-00">73</date>), English economist, philosopher, and essayist.</note> (the <hi rend="italic">Spirit of the Age</hi> man) he speaks very highly, as of a converted Utilitarian, who is studying German: so we are all to meet, along with a certain Mrs Austen<note n="18" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sarah (Taylor) Austin (<date when="1793-00-00">1793</date>&#x2013;<date when="1867-00-00">1867</date>), wife of the English jurist John Austin and translator from the German and French.</note> a young Germanist and mutual intercessor (between Mill and Empson), and breakfast some day in the Templar#x2019;s lodgings. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Quod faustum felixque sit</hi></foreign> [may it turn out favorably and happily]!<note n="19" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310304-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1831-03-04">4 March</date></ref>. This Latin phrase heads the list of each year#x2019;s intake in the Edinburgh University matriculation registers.</note> It does my soul good to meet a true soul. Poor inexperienced Glen is the only phenomenon of that sort I have yet seen here: but I will &#x201C;riddle creation&#x201D; till I find more. Thus too before your arrival (if such be our decision) I may perhaps have a little pleasant circle to present you to: for of the <hi rend="italic">old</hi> there is very <hi rend="italic">little</hi> to be made; Irving alone stands true, and he (poor fellow!) is working miracles; while the Montagues, Stracheys &#x26;c have mostly (I fear) drifted quite to leeward.&#x2014;</p>
<p>Calumny itself, dear Wifekin, cannot say that this is not a <hi rend="italic">long</hi> letter; and yet, mournful enough, there is no conclusion come to on the thing most of all worth concluding about: your journey to London. I myself know not well what to say of it. The persuasion grows more and more upon me that we should <hi rend="italic">spend the winter here;</hi> and you are of the same mind with me, I think we should look forward to it as a distinct probability, to become a certainty if no new light arise in the interim. Say, Goody, would it not be pleasant to <hi rend="italic">thee?</hi> Tell me distinctly; and yet I already know it would; but that (as beseems a good Wife) you subordinate your wishes to the common good, and will not even speak of them. Well, but here in this Lodging, <pb id="pg-05-380" n="05:380"/>we live actually (Jack and I) for some two guineas a week: or suppose, in the winter season, and with many little gracefulnesses which Goody would superadd, it cost <hi rend="italic">us</hi> two 3 guineas, what then? It is little more than we used to spend in Edinburgh, including rent: and we can thoroughly investigate London. I cannot promise you the comforts of our own poor Craig: yet it is a handsome Lodging, and with purely honest people. These foolish <hi rend="italic">Criers</hi> also (of lettuces, milk, beer &#x26;c &#x26;c) who awake me too early almost every morning will not be out so <hi rend="italic">soon</hi> in the short days. Besides, confess, thy sleep is always soundest beside <hi rend="italic">me</hi>. Our drawing-room (for such it is) will be of the coldest I doubt: but coals are not so very dear, and the female mind can devise thicker clothes. How then? Shall it be decided on? We have to go <hi rend="italic">some</hi>whither; why not come <hi rend="italic">hither</hi>, where my part of the going is already finished? Thyself shalt say it! Use thy prophetic gift: if it answer yes, then will I strive to obey it,&#x2014;or &#x201C;moderate&#x201D; it. Dear Goody! she is so patient with me; goes whither I list and makes the best of every thing. Heaven will reward her; and I trust thro#x2019; me.</p>
<p>The worst of it is that I had not tarried where I was till the latter <date when="1831-10-00">end of October</date>. The Town is quite vacant for the next six weeks; everybody hastening to the Country, which indeed is far pleasanter. Now what is to be done with that? Suppose I hurry home again, after this villainous Book business were settled: why there is some &#xa3;8 or &#xa3;10 consumed; just about the sum that would keep me here. And yet the thought of wanting you till the <date when="1831-10-00">end of October</date> is insupportable nearly; <hi rend="italic">altogether</hi> insupportable if I fancied <hi rend="italic">you</hi> also pining in loneliness. Would I had known! Tell me, however, honestly tell me are you quite un<hi rend="italic">happy?</hi> Is such a thing frightful to you?&#x2014; I sometimes think it were better, as I once said, to make some excursion from <hi rend="italic">hence;</hi> as say, out to Enfield; perhaps to Cornwall (from which I yet hear nothing); or even to stay here tho#x2019; alone. Say <hi rend="italic">thy</hi> word, my Darling: for I am sure it will be wise.</p>
<p>Here is the Post hour, and tho#x2019; I have written like fury, I am not ready. Next time I will be briefer; that is, compress my meaning more (if I can): but any way my <hi rend="italic">meaning</hi> thou shalt have. It is the jewel of the whole week#x2019;s history that I can write it all <hi rend="italic">home</hi>. Depend, therefore, on the twice a week system. A Newspaper at least will come (by the by, there is none today, not by my blame, but partly by Jack#x2019;s): and do thou, Dearest, continue to send the like. Also remember, if it be a convenience, that two or even three sheets will go by the Twopenny as well as one. Throw the poor Duke a word sometimes; for his franks are very precious.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-05-381" n="05:381"/>A Letter arrives from Jack that Badams is growing better, and resolute on continuing his abstinence. Jack will return tonight. He is studying Italian &#x26;c to make ready for his journey.</p>
<p>I wrote to my Mother and Father yesterday. Poor Alick, I was very sorry but &#x201C;how can we help it.&#x201D; And Jenny&#x2014;jealous! The Devil is busy.</p>
<p>Wardrop has invited me to dine this night <hi rend="italic">at seven:</hi> so having breakfasted at twelve, I can stand him, and (after much reluctance of the flesh) will go. I am here to <hi rend="italic">see</hi> men; and should look on them where they are to be seen&#x2014;such as they are.</p>
<p>Alas! Five is striking: I shall hardly get this off by running out and paying a penny. <closer><salute>There is the Postman#x2019;s Bell. <foreign>Adieu! Adieu!</foreign> God ever bless thee Dearest! Thy own Husband,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dearest Wife,</salute>
<p>Late as it is, I must have a little word of talk with thee before I sleep. Frank and all is ready; and perhaps tomorrow there may not be so much composure.&#x2014; The Newspaper coming in your hand this morning quickened my motions over to Jermyn Street: I had <hi rend="italic">not</hi> gone thither to breakfast; chiefly because I was very bilious and dispirited; partly also because the Youth Glen was here with some work for me. However, in spite of rain-puddles (which smutted all my white trowsers) I was on the spot before noon; and found on entering <hi rend="italic">the</hi> Letter of Letters waiting me. My words were few; neither were the answers copious, for there seemed to have been some devilry going on: so, after asking for a frank, I rose and took myself away. The Advocate had written to Murray; but got <hi rend="italic">no</hi> answer (whereat he seemed to marvel): for the rest, we did not speak six words; merely when I met John Murray (the Henderland Edinburgh man)<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Evidently of Edinburgh and formerly of Henderland, a farm in Yarrow parish, Selkirkshire; otherwise unidentified.</note> and spoke to him as he entered the room I was leaving, our Dukekin muttered something about seeing him at the House of Lords on Friday,&#x2014;some three miles off, whither except in case of need and <pb id="pg-05-382" n="05:382"/>idleness I shall perhaps hardly trouble myself with going. On the whole, were it not for the franks (which <hi rend="italic">are</hi> an immense blessing) I might as well discontinue my attendance at Jermyn Street, where positively there is no good to be got, not so much as a serious word. The man is really, I suppose, very busy; farther I take his friendship for me, as I have all along done, to be perhaps three parts <foreign>palabra</foreign>, and one part half-sentiment, half-goodwill. Poor Duke! I will always love him: nevertheless there are two things I vehemently desire: first that I had &#xa3;60 to pay him;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lent to Carlyle, <date when="1830-05-22">22 May 1830</date>. See Wilson, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi>, II, 153. A. Carlyle wrongly says that the repayment was of a loan to John.</note> secondly that I had my Wife#x2019;s picture<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably the one reproduced in Wilson, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi>, II, opp. p. 220; the original has not been traced.</note> out of his hands, which I cannot but think are nowise worthy to hold it. Let me remember also that the pressure of such a situation as mine can be known to him only theoretically; farther that as nothing is to be <hi rend="italic">done</hi> what could be <hi rend="italic">said</hi> is perhaps of infinitely small moment. Be not unthankful, therefore; be not intolerant!</p>
<p>In any case, I rushed forth with my Letter, and read it in the hurlyburly; with many feelings: gladness, sorrow, love, indignation and defiance. O what a scandalously despicable procedure is that of Alick#x2019;s;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The name is heavily scored out in ink different from that of the letter&#x2014;clearly a later censorship. Carlyle refers to Alick#x2019;s drunkenness at Templand.</note> brutified repeatedly before strangers! I am exceedingly grieved about it; and anxious when I look into the future and think of my poor brother<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Also scored out but barely legible.</note> a Drunkard. Do write to him with all earnestness: I myself have a mind to advise him seriously to make some <hi rend="italic">vow</hi> on the subject, or join some Temperance Society, or in short do anything rather than go direct to the Devil.</p>
<p>And the Gate at Stumpy! My hands itched to clutch my axe, and shiver <hi rend="italic">it</hi> asunder, and (God forgive me!) the block-<hi rend="italic">head</hi> also of any one that would have defended it. But calmer feelings are the truer, especially here. Let me hope that your uncle has thrown some light on the matter: at all events, do not <hi rend="italic">you</hi> (my poor lonely Jane) levy <hi rend="italic">war</hi> with these monsters of the wold; let them burn the whole Farm rather, so they keep off <hi rend="italic">you</hi>. Nevertheless I could nearly cry to think that Jane Welsh sits there exposed to such annoyances, from such people, by such causes. But Patience! Patience! One thing I clearly think you ought to do: write to your Uncle George<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Welsh of Boreland, Dumfriesshire, about 20 miles east from Craigenputtoch.</note> as I once proposed, and see whether <hi rend="italic">he</hi> will take the Farm, and if so get the <pb id="pg-05-383" n="05:383"/>present individual thrown out before another Whitsunday. I am quite clear as to this. It will even remain a serious question (altho#x2019; George should altogether <hi rend="italic">refuse</hi>) whether <hi rend="italic">that</hi> unfortunate Savage should not be ejected in <hi rend="italic">any</hi> case; seeing the chances are distinctly for a better, at least for one who <hi rend="italic">has</hi> not quarrelled with you. The Farm of Craigenputtoch let those who are more interested in it manage: but the House of Craigenputtoch <hi rend="italic">must</hi> not be rendered uninhabitable; and shall not, if I can help it. I pity your Mother also; and wish much she had even a slight turn for business.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, my own gig-driving, beast-resisting, brave beloved Wifie, let us thank these ill chances, with all their evil, since they help us forward to what is always good: a fixed decision. Considering that such are your views of an abandonment of the Dunscore Tartarus and a trial of the London <foreign>Terra Incognita</foreign> [unknown land],&#x2014;I say at once: let it be considered as resolved on that <hi rend="italic">we are to pass the winter here!</hi> And so do you now turn all your thoughts on the arrangements that must be made; and by what means poor Puttoch may be found standing for us in the best possible repair, at the next spring season; when, as I conjecture, the wearied Dyspeptical Philosopher may be once more glad to return thither for a little while. Do not have the thing dismantled in any way: the very <hi rend="italic">thought</hi> of it is often worth much to me here. O my little Darling! what a world of wild work for thee: but thou hast a talent for work.&#x2014; Furthermore, as to the <hi rend="italic">time</hi> of your setting out hither, be that left wholly to your own wish and convenience. This place is habitable even now, tho#x2019; for <hi rend="italic">three</hi> of us; and poor Jack will vacate it by the <date when="1831-10-01">first of October</date>. I said, last time, that the Town would be empty and stagnant till perhaps the middle of that month; that perhaps we might visit the Bullers, from whom, however, I have yet no farther news: and in these facts does the whole matter lie as plain to my dear Prophetess as to myself; let her therefore decide upon everything. O that I saw her (as one day thro#x2019; God#x2019;s mercy I shall) leaping out of the Coach in this wild hurlyburly into her Husband#x2019;s arms! Yes, Dearest, I think I will kiss thee before the whole world, and call thee mine audibly, mine forever and ever. Study, then, how it is all to be, and when; and say wherein I must help thee. There are, I think, some &#xa3;33 lying here, 16 of the Scotch Notes and quite useless for <hi rend="italic">this</hi> market: say whether I must send some of these, and how many. Or shall I write to <hi rend="italic">Naso</hi> to pay <hi rend="italic">you</hi> <supplied>[for]</supplied> the Taylor at Dumfries?<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >He asks whether he should request Macvey Napier to send Jane the payment due for his review of William Taylor#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Historic Survey of German Poetry</hi>.</note> Consider of everything, and <pb id="pg-05-384" n="05:384"/>command me as thy billetted Lodger.&#x2014; And now, good night, my own heart#x2019;s Wife! I will kiss thee a million of times for thy bonny new gown, for thy bonny face and heart; and be all to thee, in this world and in all worlds, that weak man can be. So fear nothing, Love; trust in me and God: tho#x2019; forsaken of all, have we not in the worst case <hi rend="italic">one another?</hi></p>
<p>Jack comes up with news that Goethe has written a Letter (containing simply two stanzas of Poetry about the Seal)<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See the notes to the letter from <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310717-FEF-G-01"><sic>Fifteen English Friends to Goethe</sic><corr>FEF to G</corr>, [<date when="1831-07-17">17?

<p><hi rend="italic">Thursday morning</hi> [<date when="1831-09-01">1 September</date>]. I am on foot again; have breakfasted, and will have a word with my Lady before attacking these Proofsheets, and so make sure of at least one little pleasure for the day. I am generally in such haste that I cannot even reperuse what I have written: <foreign><hi rend="italic">tant mieux</hi></foreign> [so much the better]; it is the more like speech.&#x2014; Take now some narrative of my life since Monday.</p>
<p>That evening, as predicted, I set off to Wardrop#x2019;s,<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310817-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1831-08-17">17 Aug.</date></ref></note> westward close by the Advocate#x2019;s; and was there by the stroke of seven. A curious <foreign><hi rend="italic">gomeril</hi></foreign> [stupid person] is W.; of strange aspect also for an oculist, inasmuch as one of his own eyes has a white substance in the pupil of it, like a boiled pea, and can see none, as I should think; while the eyelid of the other droops half-down, and must partially shut out his vision there likewise. He speaks very like Church of Kirkchrist, in a straggling murmuring half-articulate tone both of voice and thought; looks close into your face; and sprawls out here and there in his pure Edinburgh dialect a trait of Observation sceptico-gigmanic, of Feeling gregarious if not social. Of private talk he and I had little, <pb id="pg-05-385" n="05:385"/>except skirmishing on Phrenology; for we were quite a political party: Lord Lowther (who less?);<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Lowther (<date when="1787-00-00">1787</date>&#x2013;<date when="1872-00-00">1872</date>), Lord Lowther, later Earl of Lonsdale, politician.

At this time he was M.P. for Dunwich, and in <date when="1832-00-00">1832</date> for Westmoreland and Cumberland.

I sat and looked, getting little for my pains, except a miserable fit of indigestion, which has not quite left me even yet.

It will be a braver sight, I fancy, that will allure me out <hi rend="italic">again</hi> to incur the pangs of a supper-dinner; at least unless I be a fool.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, I called on Bowring with a view to Fonblanque; found him out of town, but to be back again probably on Thursday morning; which opportunity you see I have not embraced, the weather being wet, and a better pleasure and duty awaiting me at home. Returning I took to read Schiller#x2019;s Life (the Goethe one);<note n="17" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Thomas Carlyle Leben Schillers aus dem Englischen, eingeleitet durch Goethe</hi> (Frankfurt, <date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>).</note> was ere long <pb id="pg-05-386" n="05:386"/>interrupted by Irving; to whom I expounded frankly my theological views, which he received with kindness yet with thoughtfully puckered face; seeing it diverge so from his own thaumaturgic theory. From the &#x201C;work of the Spirit&#x201D; I have been pretty well relieved of late. Irving and I are to walk out to Coleridge#x2019;s this evening after tea.<note n="18" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Because of a &#x201C;rain-deluge&#x201D; they did not go, and Carlyle did not see Coleridge again. See <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi>, II, 132.</note>&#x2014; Of Dilke#x2019;s tea (Dilke is the name) I have little to say, except that the man is very tolerant, hospitable; not without a sense for the good, but with little power to follow it: and defy the evil. That is the temper in which I find many here: they deplore the prevalence of dishonesty, quackery and stupidity; many do it (like Dilke) with apparent heartiness and sorrow: but to believe that it can be <hi rend="italic">resisted</hi>, that it will and shall be resisted; herein poor Teufelsdreck is well nigh singular. The fat Lady too,<note n="19" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mrs. Dilke; see <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310822-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1831-08-22">22 Aug.</date></ref></note> fat as she was, proved pleasant; she played me tunes on an indifferent Piano, and sang to them well; was hospitable, good-natured, perhaps kind. They have two or three fine Italian pictures, and a certain <foreign><hi rend="italic">Kunstgef&#xfc;hl</hi></foreign> [feeling for art]: are better considerably than the average of mortals. Touching the Cunninghams and the wild Irish Dandy and tamed English Driveller that formed the remainder of our party, there is nothing to be said.&#x2014; At home I found a confused Note from Empson, urging me to call on Mrs Austin (who &#x201C;would give the world to see me&#x201D;) and arrange about John Mill (the Spirit of the Age man) that is, about a meeting with him.</p>
<p>My Wednesday#x2019;s adventures are partially before Goody#x2019;s eye already. After reading her Letter on the muddy pavements of Picadilly or its neighbourhood, I turned northward <foreign><hi rend="italic">zornigen Muthes</hi></foreign> [in an angry temper], to that same Mrs Austin#x2019;s residence; which proved to lie some four miles off in a pleasant rural spot, about a mile from this. The lady was in, but &#x201C;so sick she could see no one hardly&#x201D;; bestirred herself however at sight of my card, and after some toilette preparations blessed my bodily eyesight. I am not sure but I have here found a sort of friend for Goody thro#x2019; winter; at least so I thought, and even partially said. Mrs A (her Husband is Professor of Law in the despised and despicable London University) is the most enthusiastic of German Mystics I have ever met with: an exceedingly vivid person, not without insight, but enthusiastic, as it were astonished rapt to ecstacy with the German Apocalypse; and as she says herself <foreign><hi rend="italic">verdeutscht</hi></foreign> [Germanized]. But I must give you some notion (according to laudable wont) of her visual aspect. Conceive Kate <pb id="pg-05-387" n="05:387"/>Gilchrist<note n="20" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dugald Gilchrist#x2019;s sister. See <ref target="volume-03/lt-18240811-JBW-TC-01"><sic>3:129&#x2013;30</sic><corr>JBW to TC, <date when="1824-08-11">11 Aug. 1824</date></corr></ref>.</note> beaten out into symmetrical length (the middle size) with a pair of clearest, warm blue eyes (almost hectically intense), considerable mouth, and moustache on the upper lip, compared with which thine cannot name itself (mole and all) in the same week: an eagerness, a warmth in her whole manner and look, which has in it something feverish; as indeed her ill-health seemed to disappear at sight of me, and her face became tinged with a pure flush, which I liked not the look of, it was too conconsumptive [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>]. She would have talked with me till yet, but I was in no mood for prattle; so after settling that I was to take tea there (or hot water, if the weed be green) on Friday night, when Mill and Empson should be summoned,&#x2014;I took myself away. She had informed me that a Letter despatched towards me, without my address, was at that time wandering over London: a Letter grounded on some mistake, by the servant, of Empson#x2019;s mumbling, whereby she thought <hi rend="italic">I</hi> had called. Said Letter actually came last night; delivered by a young man Coke from Norwich,<note n="21" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> whom I kept to tea. This poor young man I find is partially a disciple of mine, and talks of a small suffering remnant more by the title of &#x201C;us.&#x201D; He is very modest, distinct, earnest-looking, honest-looking. The &#x201C;Signs of the Times&#x201D;<note n="22" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle#x2019;s article in the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review</hi>, XLIX (<date when="1829-06-00">June 1829</date>), 439&#x2013;59.</note> <hi rend="italic">we</hi> had settled to be by you, Sir! Taylor of Norwich had become an old Sensualist; was grieved a little at some parts of his Review, which he imputed, good easy man, to Sir W. Scott. This Coke has some small office in the British Museum, whither he invites me (himself invited to come back hither) to see the more secret sort of curiosities. Almost the only comfort I have had since I came to London is the sight of these poor Disciplekins, whom with Mrs Irving I might as well call, &#x201C;Children in the Laart&#x201D;: for they have evidently believed in me, and are ready for more light, could they or I procure such. To investigate their quality numbers and aims will be my best work thro#x2019; the winter. Men united are strong; Single the strongest is weak. Nay what if Goody too, as I said, should now more resolutely unfold himself; and show other talents than that for silence, whereof she has many and rare? I long to see how the Scottish sense of my little Dame will comport itself amid the copious outpourings of a Mrs Austin; perhaps as a habitable castle amid boundless shifting quicksands. Nay Mrs Austin writes; why should not Mrs Carlyle, whose endowment I suspect is considerably greater? I promised that you would agree in condoling over the lot of women: &#x201C;Oh! I <pb id="pg-05-388" n="05:388"/>should so like!&#x201D;&#x2014;for in truth the rude hand of Time has not yet sufficiently demolished the bloom of that beautiful enthu-si-as-m.<note n="23" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech.

<p>Thus, Dearest, hast thou a picture of what I do or am trying to do. And now I must off: for the day wears apace; and the Proofsheets are clamorous. I feel loth to conclude, as if it were again bidding you farewell. We shall meet soon; and not on Paper but in Reality: there lies our Comfort.</p>
<p>So go, my little Love, and set thy clear little head to work; and make the best arrangements thou canst. I advise thee, as yet, in nothing: write what is the aspect of things; and where doubt is I too will consider. Poor Crummy (Noolie), poor Harry!<note n="24" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Harry is the pony; Crummy (Noolie) the cow.</note> By the way, with regard to the former I bethink me of once saying that your Mother#x2019;s would <hi rend="italic">not</hi> be a good place for her to winter in; that I would not leave her with Alick on <hi rend="italic">any</hi> consideration: please simply to regard all this as <hi rend="italic">un</hi>said; and that I have no will in the matter, and no wish except that the poor brute should <hi rend="italic">be</hi> happiest herself, and <hi rend="italic">give</hi> the most happiness. Do altogether as seemeth good to thee. Perhaps Alick does not want the beast much: he would very probably winter her rather ill; yet could not altogether destroy her, or make her leaner than she <hi rend="italic">was:</hi> therein lie the whole conditions of the matter; do in it as thy judgement bids.</p>
<p>I am for some tincture of cardamum or other bitter; for positively my inner man is ill. <hi rend="italic">Thou</hi> art not here to feed me and lead me: I am in great want of my Wifekin; but live in hope. Thanks, Deary, for thy news from Scotsbrig and messages thither: thou must go down, once more, and bring me all the news: nay, I forgot, the starting-place itself is Annan. O that it were all over; and the Screamikin here by me; and a little, a very little Rest vouchsafed us!&#x2014; The Book as you see I need not torment myself <hi rend="italic">so</hi> much with pressing forward; we shall be here to see it thro<supplied>[#x2019;]</supplied>&#x2014;&#x201C;or publish it on our own account, my love.&#x201D; &#x2014;Darling!&#x2014; Yet I wish it were out; for now is the time for it.&#x2014; By the bye, is it worth while to mention that Dilke showed me something in Blackwood by Wilson about&#x2014;my speech at Dumfries!<note n="25" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310818-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, <date when="1831-08-18">[18] Aug.</date></ref>, and for Wilson#x2019;s comments <hi rend="italic">Blackwood#x2019;s Magazine</hi>, XXX (<date when="1831-09-00">Sept. 1831</date>), 484, where he says: &#x201C;Our dearly beloved Thomas Carlyle is reported to have said &#x2026; that Burns was not only one of the greatest of poets, but likewise of philosophers. We hope not. &#x2026; He was neither a Shakespeare, nor a Scott, nor a Goethe. &#x2026; But forbid it, all ye Gracious Powers! that we should quarrel with Thomas Carlyle&#x2014;and that, too, for calling Robert Burns one of the greatest of poets and philosophers.&#x201D;</note> Gracious <pb id="pg-05-389" n="05:389"/>powers, is the world distract?

This is a phrase of Heraud#x2019;s, p. 169, who says: &#x201C;The writer of this article &#x2026; sometimes thinks, that, by standing on Mr. Carlyle#x2019;s shoulders, he can see farther into the Land of Promise than his critical contemporary.&#x201D;</note> he is a <hi rend="italic">cratur</hi> well nigh <foreign><hi rend="italic">sui generis</hi></foreign> [in a class by himself], perhaps well intentioned, but always unfortunate. <foreign>A Dios!</foreign> My Dearest: think of me, and ever love me. <closer><salute>Thy own</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Beloved Good&#x2014;&#x2018;Balm best and holiest#x2019;</salute>
<p>Blessings on thee for thy precious letters! truly they are my life in death! O had you seen me last night&#x2014;seen the almost insupportable impatience of thy Goody; and then her transports&#x2014;you would hardly have known whether to laugh or weep. Betty returned with a long story about Mac<supplied>[k]</supplied>night having been late. &#x201C;For god<supplied>[#x2019;]</supplied>s sake give me the letters!&#x201D; &#x201C;He left the town too at the usual hour Mam but&#x2014;&#x201D; &#x201C;For the love of God will you produce the letters!&#x201D; So seeing that I would positively not hear <hi rend="italic">her</hi> out first, she at last handed me <hi rend="italic">the little bag</hi> I had sent, in case of one being lost by the way&#x2014;for the various imaginations I fall on to torment myself with are altogether wonderful&#x2014;</p>
<p>And now I was happy, happy&#x2014;indeed <hi rend="italic">too</hi> happy for the intensity of the feeling was sickening&#x2014; My fire burned clear&#x2014;my candle was lit&#x2014;all in readiness&#x2014;and I seated myself at my little table (for one) and spread out both the letters before me, and tried to read them <pb id="pg-05-390" n="05:390"/><hi rend="italic">both at once</hi>&#x2014;and finding that impossible even to love&#x2014;finally began with the beginning and read on to the end&#x2014;at which point I felt a strong disposition to rush out into infinite space, and tell the dead craigs and running brooks, that my Husband was well and took up with no other women! God help me I am a great fool&#x2014; &#x201C;Now you will put yourself off your sleep Mam&#x201D; said Betty when she came in with porridge and found me walking at quick time about the room&#x2014;and she never said a truer thing&#x2014;for not <hi rend="italic">one</hi> wink of sleep have I got this night&#x2014; About one I rose, put on my dressing gown, lit my candle, looked vacantly on the Dumfries Courier for two hours, and&#x2014;smoked half an inch of a cigar&#x2014; Not I declare to thee for the love of the cigar, but because I had a pleasure in mimic<supplied>[k]</supplied>ing thee. Then I returned to bed again but sleep was out of the question&#x2014; My heart now beat audibly&#x2014;the wind too was making strange noises&#x2014;for the first time I felt a little nervous about our unprotected state, and regretted that I had not yet learned, as I was meaning, to fire the Gun! And so between vague apprehensions and anxious listening, on the one hand, and thoughts, of thy love and goodness on the other&#x2014;of my probable journey to London&#x2014;my meeting with my own&#x2014;John<supplied>[#x2019;]</supplied>s good fortune&#x2014;M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Montagu#x2019;s desertion to the Dragons&#x2014;Badams#x2019;s misfortunes and all the interesting things you tell me&#x2014;I tumbled on till seven, when I had tea in bed, and after one other unavailing attempt at sleep I put on my clothes&#x2014;and here am I&#x2014;not a bit weary&#x2014;without headach<supplied>[e]</supplied> or other ailment only <hi rend="italic">very much detached</hi>. But tomorrow will come when I shall be &#x201C;more stilly laid,&#x201D; as the song says, so it is best to write while I may: besides it will help to compose my mind.</p>
<p>I should have liked better certainly if John had get an appointment of a more permanent sort, al<supplied>[t]</supplied>ho#x2019; less showy&#x2014;but let us be thankful and hope the best&#x2014;it is infinitely better than none nay it is a fair and even splendid carreer [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] laid open to him in which he has only to avoid kicking over apple-baskets and he will get along bravely&#x2014; Offer him my sincere congratulations&#x2014; I will send on the note for Alick by the earliest opportunity,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A note from John Carlyle to Alexander Carlyle asking for a loan of &#xa3;40 until the salary from Lady Clare began to be paid.</note> I had a note from <hi rend="italic">Him</hi> this morn<supplied>[in]</supplied>g (by Macadam!) written before he got my letter&#x2014;Which letter was one long shriek of apprehension and entreaty&#x2014;but no matter&#x2014;it came from the heart and therefore it would go to the heart. He will mind my words for he loves me, I rather take it, far better than I thought&#x2014;and thus will good come out of evil. I <hi rend="italic">discovered</hi> <pb id="pg-05-391" n="05:391"/>much that night in Dumfries which I will tell you of hereafter. At present let me turn to what is naturally up<supplied>[p]</supplied>ermost in my thoughts&#x2014; My coming to you<supplied>[.]</supplied> Say but this&#x2014;that you do not for the purpose of procuring <hi rend="italic">me a pleasure</hi> make any sacrifice of your own wishes or convictions; and without an instants hesitation I am decided to come&#x2014; so soon too as I can get things arranged for leaving&#x2014; &#x2018;The town is empty#x2019; O Mercy&#x2014;it will be full enough any day of the year for one who has been so long used to a desert&#x2014; Every way of it were pleasant for me<supplied>[&#x2014;]</supplied> I should like to go to Cornwall&#x2014;like to go to Enfield like to stay with <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, so that on that ground there need be no delay, and neither on any other ground that I can see were it judicious. I should not add to your expenses living <hi rend="italic">with</hi> you in London (so far as I see into it) more than if I were keeping a <hi rend="italic">separate</hi> establishment here&#x2014; And there seems every chance of <hi rend="italic">your</hi> being detained in London some time yet&#x2014; At all rates (if it be decided that we winter in London, which indeed appears to me almost as a <hi rend="italic">necessity</hi>) the saving (if any) of returning hither for a few weeks were not worth the fatigue and disconvenience; and while the expense of <hi rend="italic">my</hi> journey up is the same whether incurred now or a month or two later&#x2014;</p>
<p>Now consider what a time elapses before one can get an answer to a letter here&#x2014; And also how very slowly one gets on even with the most trivial arrangements if these depend not wholly on oneself&#x2014;and so tell me in the <hi rend="italic">very next</hi> letter (if I be really to come) all that you would have me to do&#x2014; First as to Betty&#x2014;shall I dismiss her or let her stay on and take care of the house till the term&#x2014; I have been thinking the last way were perhaps the best for the house, and the cheapest. She would have potatoes butter bacon without cost&#x2014;a little tea and sugar would complete her outfitting&#x2014; I shall be sorry to lose her but the keeping of <hi rend="italic">pets</hi> is too expensive a taste for people in our way&#x2014; The same remark applies to Harry; but some means may perhaps be fallen upon of keeping <hi rend="italic">him</hi> on without expense&#x2014; Here he canna be for obvious reasons connected with his own personal comfort poor little beast. They keep beehsts in beehsts place&#x2014;and would break the heart of a beesht [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] that has had the life of an entire gentleman&#x2014; Perhaps my Mother will take him in the mean time and send her shelty here&#x2014; This is the only outlook that I have for him as yet&#x2014; However if you would wish him sold and out of the road&#x2014;tell me&#x2014; The cow is sure of a welcome go where she will&#x2014; You would like her sent to Scotsbrig I suppose? And the Turkeys with <hi rend="italic">your</hi> compliments&#x2014; The chickens I am resolved to eat as many of as I can&#x2014;</p>
<p>Next as to what I am to bring with me or send&#x2014; Am I to bring <pb id="pg-05-392" n="05:392"/>anything except my wearing apparel<supplied>[?]</supplied> Is there any need of sheets or tablecloths &#x26;c<supplied>[?]</supplied> Do you want any books or clothes? would it be worth while to carry meal&#x2014;butter bacon so far? The eatables might be packed together in one barrel&#x2014;the other things (if wanted) in your large trunk and shipped in the steam-boat with me&#x2014; My Uncle<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Welsh at Liverpool.</note> would be able to point out the safest and cheapest way of getting them transported afterwards&#x2014; But, you must explain to me at least give me <hi rend="italic">some idea</hi> of the sort of things that you feel in want of&#x2014;</p>
<p>I can take an inventory of all the articles in the house, and <hi rend="italic">where</hi> they are&#x2014;and leave it with the keys in charge to my Mother so that at any future time should anything be required it may be come at and sent&#x2014;</p>
<p>And now having written myself almost out of breath I shall rest a little&#x2014;and recommence if possible with a better pen&#x2014;</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Next</hi> Saturday the devil and his angel, the Monnihive Carrier shall <hi rend="italic">not</hi> prevail against me&#x2014; I have been out examining Harrys sides&#x2014; I think they may bear the saddle&#x2014;will try him at least for a mile or two this very night&#x2014;and if so I will ride for the letter <hi rend="italic">myself</hi>, and save three days of impatience indignation and despair&#x2014;</p>
<p>I feel strong enough when I see any <hi rend="italic">enterprise</hi> before me&#x2014;but indeed my health is improved&#x2014; I was persuaded to take portwine at Templand and since my return, I have drunk one of our <hi rend="italic">two</hi> bottles&#x2014;a glass every forenoon and have been distinctly very much the better for it. The disease on my face too is fading into invisibility&#x2014; When I was at Templand my Mother said &#x201C;I will tell you Jean<supplied>[n]</supplied>ie what you should do for that spot on <hi rend="italic">your</hi> face&#x2014;bathe it every morn<supplied>[in]</supplied>g and evening with springwater &#x26;c &#x26;c&#x201D; &#x201C;But I was flattering myself that the spot on my face was nearly gone&#x201D;&#x2014; &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">By the by</hi> I think it is&#x201D; (with a look of disappointment)&#x2014; Robert Barker<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-02/lt-18220525-JBW-TC-01"><sic>2:113</sic><corr>JBW to TC, <date when="1822-05-25">25 May 1822</date></corr></ref>.</note> seemed to think it no blemish; he is as much or more in love with me I verily believe than ever he was&#x2014;I observed one night to the ladies that he was surely getting into strange conditions&#x2014;&#x201C;He is madly in love with another man#x2019;s Wife&#x201D; says my Mother &#x201C;that#x2019;s all&#x201D;&#x2014; &#x201C;And a good deal too much I think, could you not either of you advise him to bestow his valuable affections more to the purpose?&#x201D;</p>

<p>Friday night [<date when="1831-09-02">2 September</date>].</p>
<p>Little sleep last night either&#x2014;and today one of my worst heads&#x2014; Had any traveller landed here this forenoon and explored his way thro#x2019; the deserted <hi rend="italic">toon</hi> [town] to my apartment, he might have fancied himself in a scene of enchantment. There, on my bed, lay collected all the <hi rend="italic">life</hi> remaining in the place, and that apparently extinct or spell-bound: I had been fainting, and Betty leaning over me, holding salts to my nose, in which position we both finally fell asleep! Now I am up and better, and still resolutely bent on the post office to-morrow&#x2014; Indeed Mr. C<supplied>[ar]</supplied>l<supplied>[y]</supplied>le a#x2019;s maist ashamed to say it, but a#x2019;s far too impetuous&#x2014;my speculative ardor I feel will shorten my life&#x2014; But I must not fill up my paper till tomorrow&#x2014; Goodnight my Beloved&#x2014;</p>

<salute>Dearest of Goodies,</salute>
<p>I was lounging on the sofa, on Friday afternoon, struggling hard to keep myself awake over some stupid Book between dinner and tea, when that invaluable &#x201C;Twopenny&#x201D; of ours gave his two knocks, and aroused me to the clearest and joyfullest consciousness; for he handed in a Letter from the Wife! M#x2019;Knight had been early on Wednesday, and so my happiness came sooner by a day than I was anticipating. Many thanks to thee now as always! I kissed the little lock of hair, and keep it carefully reposited till we meet. A malison surely will overtake that wretched Carrier, whose unpunctuality frustrates so much well-meant endeavour. Can you not operate upon Dalgleish, however; the rather as it is certain that <hi rend="italic">every</hi> Saturday there will be &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">some</hi>think for Craigenputtoch&#x201D;? Solemnly adjure him to do his very best. At all events, I will continue to write, be the others regular or not, ever till&#x2014;&#x2014;you jump out of the Coach and kiss me in person.</p>
<p>Something I would give to know your feelings at this very hour: for now I calculate is the time when you are down at the Corsons#x2019; (or Betty for you) seeking news; and if all be right, have read the decisive monosyllable &#x201C;Come.&#x201D; I shall wait with eagerness for your thoughts thereupon, which cannot reach me before Friday; and in the mean while, please myself with the thought that the decree has yielded you joy; that Hope is once more stirring in your heart, and amid the distant murmurings of an Earthquake without parallel, some forecast of Christian Com<hi rend="italic">fort</hi>.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech. Cf. <ref target="volume-03/lt-18251114-JBW-MAC-01"><sic>3:412&#x2013;13</sic><corr>JBW to MAC, <date when="1825-11-14">14 Nov. 1825</date></corr></ref>.</note> I have spoken to Irving on the subject of our <pb id="pg-05-395" n="05:395"/>lodging here: he expresses himself &#x201C;charmed with the prospect of having such guests&#x201D;; undertakes also to procure a feather-bed (to lay over these mattresses, which too much resemble those at Scotsbrig); also to make some improvement in his chairs, window-curtains &#x26;c; so as to render the apartments fitter for a Goody. I think we shall do pretty well: the worst thing is a considerable prospect of cold; therefore do thou provide for thy own fair person all manner of wrappages convenient, lamb#x2019;s wool stockings and drawers, slippers, plaiding and flannel in abundance: for remember that the rooms have each <hi rend="italic">three</hi> apertures, and there can be no evening log. But before you come off, I mean to make an inventory of furnishings here; and see what you can bring with you, more specially. Let me not forget however in the mean time to correct one egregious blunder: I wrote once that the carriage from Liverpool hither was twopence a <hi rend="italic">stone</hi>; alas, the cheapest I have yet heard of (according to Jack and G. Irving) is twopence a <hi rend="italic">pound!</hi> It strikes me as being impossible that there should not be a far cheaper: nay in this case it were much better to have your things sent round by Edi<hi rend="italic">nr</hi>. But perhaps the surest course will be for you to write both to your uncle John and to Sam Aitken asking what is the real rate (not in &#x201C;vans&#x201D; or by &#x201C;fly-boats&#x201D; but by the <hi rend="italic">easiest</hi> conveyance); <hi rend="italic">delivery here</hi> being included, for that is often the heaviest part of it. You may well ask, why do not <hi rend="italic">I</hi> go and inquire? In the course of days, I could no doubt fish out some answer; yet not without a difficulty inconceivable to you; London being the <hi rend="italic">centre</hi> of all things, known to every part of the <hi rend="italic">circle</hi>, and nowise so surely knowing it. Perhaps the first twenty men I might ask would direct me to &#x201C;Pickford,&#x201D; who is the &#x201C;2<hi rend="italic">d</hi> per lb&#x201D; individual. On our answer to this inquiry will depend <hi rend="italic">what</hi> we are to take and what <hi rend="italic">not</hi>: four or five stones of the best Scotsbrig meal (or more, if the Prophetess <hi rend="italic">compute</hi> more); a good stock of Noolie#x2019;s Butter; these with some other items will be indispensable in any case. Wardrop brought his very potatoes from Scotland: the only good ones I have tasted here.&#x2014; Also we will have the coffee-mill, and some coffee, were my Wifekin here! For I know it already, she will make improvements in every department; and be my little dainty Ariel, and lie round me like an Angel with wings, and cause the solitary place to blossom like the rose!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Isa. 35:1; and Edward Irving#x2019;s comment to Jane on his final visit to Cheyne Row: &#x201C;You are like an Eve, and make a little Paradise wherever you are!&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi>, II, 216). Pickford was the largest moving company in Great Britain.</note> Jack, as you may easily conjecture, is not the best of wives; <pb id="pg-05-396" n="05:396"/>in which capacity, however, he partially acts at present, not without conceit of his own management. The magnanimous Doil!&#x2014; Be active then, best Goodykin; and prove thyself a &#x201C;<foreign>lass</foreign> of <hi rend="italic">speereet</hi>.&#x201D;</p>
<p>I will now, according to laudable wont, give you some passages of my Diary since last Letter: it saves me the trouble of jotting aught elsewhere; and comes far best from me, in this the shape of tea-conversations with my other Self.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On <date when="1831-08-27">27 Aug.</date> Carlyle had written in his <hi rend="italic">Journal:</hi> &#x201C;Have some time ago discontinued this Journal-writing; my Wife#x2019;s Letters being properly a Journal&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Two Note Books</hi>, p. 200).</note> Listen, then; apply that ear thro#x2019; which I courted thee; or rather those eyes (whereby partially I was courted), and sitting by the solitary Puttoch fire, catch some emblem of the brick Babylon, and of thy own in the midst thereof.</p>
<p>Thursday was the wettest of wet days even till after bedtime; the first day wherein I did not once stir out (except after dark to Irving#x2019;s who was not at home): Highgate and Coleridge were not to be thought of: after sealing Goody#x2019;s Letter I sat diligently over my Proofsheets, till I had finished and sealed them up about nine at night; the day unvisited of any adventure, except a little message from Mrs Austin; a Book namely of Magazine Translations from the German by herself, which she wished to have my opinion of.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly this work in manuscript (after revision) was her edited <hi rend="italic">Characteristics of Goethe from the German of Falk, von M&#xfc;ller &#x26;c</hi>. (London, <date when="1833-00-00">1833</date>). where in the Introduction, p. xvi, she says: &#x201C;I shall be glad to refer unconditionally to the writings of my friend Mr. Carlyle, to whom respect and admiration would always incline me to defer, and whose views on Goethe I would wish to share, but I confess that he has arrived at more confident conclusions than I can come to; &#x2014;probably because he sees further.&#x201D;</note> When I say <hi rend="italic">Book</hi>, it means only <hi rend="italic">farrago</hi>, like what M#x2019;Kinnel of the Midsteeple<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John McKinnel, of 104 High St., a Dumfries bookseller and bookbinder.</note> made for <hi rend="italic">us:</hi> the good lady longed above all things to have it changed into a regular Book: but being as she said &#x201C;Teutonically poor,&#x201D; had to wait the convenience of Booksellers before they would <hi rend="italic">act</hi>. She is an Enthusiast, whom I think you will like. The walk to her place is rather more than a mile, and the prettiest in all London; and you may foot it yourself, as perhaps you sometimes will.</p>

I declare I was partly touched with something of human feeling: however our little Darling seemed as <foreign>gleg</foreign> as ever, the <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;trachea&#x201D;</hi> in moderate order; and was telling his story like a little King of Elves. The Chancellor<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henry Brougham, Baron Brougham and Vaux (<date when="1778-00-00">1778</date>&#x2013;<date when="1868-00-00">1868</date>), Chancellor under Grey (<date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>&#x2013;<date when="1834-00-00">34</date>).</note> is a very particularly ignoble-looking man; a face not unlike your uncle Robert#x2019;s, but stonier, and with a deeper more restless more dangerous eye; <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> but Business in his face, no ray of genius, and even a considerable tincture of insincerity. He was yawning awfully; with an occasional twitching up of the corners of the upper lip, and point of the nose. A politician, truly, and <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> more! Learning that the Duke#x2019;s speech would not end for two hours, I willingly took myself away.</p>
<p>After dinner, as I said, came your Letter, which I read twice; then had tea (<hi rend="italic">black</hi> tea of my own); then off to the Austin#x2019;s (where I knew there would be <hi rend="italic">green</hi> tea, which I had privately determined <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to have). By the way, it is a most felonious practice that of green tea in this City; and ought to be abated. The Frau Austin herself was as loving as ever: a true Germanised spiritual <hi rend="italic">screamikin</hi>. We were five of a party. Her husband <note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Austin (<date when="1790-00-00">1790</date>&#x2013;<date when="1859-00-00">1859</date>), professor of jurisprudence at University College, London (<date when="1826-00-00">1826</date>&#x2013;<date when="1835-00-00">35</date>). An unsuccessful teacher of law, his major work was <hi rend="italic">The Province of Jurisprudence Determined</hi> (London, <date when="1832-00-00">1832</date>). His circle of friends in London was wide, including James and John Stuart Mill, Bentham, Carlyle, Charles Buller, Sydney Smith, Rogers, and Jeffrey.</note> a lean grayheaded painful-looking man, with large earnest timid eyes, and a clanging metallic voice that at great length set forth Utilitarianism <hi rend="italic">steeped</hi> in German metaphysics, <pb id="pg-05-398" n="05:398"/>not dissolved therein: a very worthy sort of limited man and Professor of Law. Secondly a Frenchman of no importance whatever; for he uttered not a word except some compliments in his own tongue on entrance; and after two hours I looked and he was gone. Thirdly John Mill &#x201C;Spirit-of-the-Age.&#x201D; The other two you know already. This young Mill I fancy and hope is &#x201C;a baying you can love.&#x201D;<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech.

We had almost four hours of the best talk I have mingled in for long. The youth walked home with me almost to the door; seemed to profess almost as plainly as modesty would allow that he had been converted by the Head of the Mystic School, to whom personally he testified very hearty-looking regard. Empson did not appear (having caught cold or something of that sort); but by Letter (while we were together) engaged Mill and me to breakfast with him on Tuesday. I met poor Empson today, riding towards Holborn on a steed like Harry: the large melancholy eyes of the man turned downwards, so that he did not observe me. He is more intellectual and otherwise better looking than Johnstone of Grange: something of Dickenson and Barker in him; I daresay he likes the women better than us, for they are kinder to him.&#x2014; On the whole, however, Goodykin these rudiments of a Mystic School, better than I anticipated here, are by far the most cheering phenomenon I see in London. Good will come of it. Let us wait, and see in what way.</p>
<p>Of Saturday I can say little except that I purchased a pair of indifferent shoes (for 8/6); read Mary Wollstonecraft#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Life</hi>,<note n="15" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A life of Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin (<date when="1759-00-00">1759</date>&#x2013;<date when="1797-00-00">97</date>) by her husband William Godwin entitled <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of the Author of the Vindication of the Rights of Women</hi> (<date when="1798-00-00">1798</date>).</note> a tragedy, a deep tragedy which I cannot get out of my thoughts: called on the noble Lady (who was out); and engaged a quarter of a year of the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, which accordingly you will not require (unless <hi rend="italic">I</hi> be in the fault) to miss again. The Editor is still out of order, and writes in bed: Mill was to take my compliments; and afterwards myself so soon as it should be suitable.&#x2014; Mrs Austin was to be off for the Bullers#x2019; soon; and to announce that &#x201C;perhaps&#x201D; Goody and I would also show face.&#x2014; Allan Cunningham is to take me on Monday night to Martin<note n="16" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Martin (<date when="1789-00-00">1789</date>&#x2013;<date when="1854-00-00">1854</date>), English historical and landscape painter, known for &#x201C;Belshazzar#x2019;s Feast,&#x201D; &#x201C;The Fall of Nineveh,&#x201D; and other works.</note> the <pb id="pg-05-399" n="05:399"/>Painter#x2019;s public party or <foreign><hi rend="italic">conversazione</hi></foreign>, anticipated by me as a mighty all affair. So stands it with me in regard to the ease of society.</p>
<p>I have the most reasonable thing still to say. At the Duke#x2019;s this morning where I found Rutherford, Saym Relish,<note n="17" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Jeffrey.</note> the Galloway Stot<note n="18" place="bottom" type="gloss" >J. R. McCulloch (<date when="1789-00-00">1789</date>&#x2013;<date when="1864-00-00">1864</date>), formerly editor of the <hi rend="italic">Scotsman</hi> (<date when="1818-00-00">1818</date>&#x2013;<date when="1820-00-00">20</date>) and journalist, had accepted the chair of political economy at the University of London in <date when="1828-00-00">1828</date>. It was not endowed, and he resigned in <date when="1832-00-00">1832</date>, when he published his well-known <hi rend="italic">Dictionary, Practical, Theoretical and Historical of Commerce and Commercial Navigation</hi> (London). He was to become a comptroller of the stationery office in <date when="1838-00-00">1838</date>. The nickname of &#x201C;the Stot&#x201D; is used in <hi rend="italic">Noctes Ambrosianae</hi>.</note> (who stared at me as if minded to gore or afraid of being gored, till I bowed), and Miss Hunter<note n="19" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Susan Hunter, later Mrs. James Stirling.</note> sitting as I always see her, looking out of the window in solitude,&#x2014;I was led by his Ludship into a private room, and there indulged with ten minutes#x2019; private talk, on the subject of <hi rend="italic">Teufelsdreck:</hi> he had previously made ready for me a Letter,<note n="20" place="bottom" type="gloss" >This letter, dated <date when="1831-09-03">3 Sept.</date>, is extant.</note> which if <hi rend="italic">weight</hi> prevent not, you shall read. The short of it is this: Murray will print a small edition (750 Copies) of <hi rend="italic">Dreck</hi>, on the half-profits system (that is I getting <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi>, but also <hi rend="italic">giving</hi> nothing) after which the sole Copyright of the Book is to be mine. Which offer he makes partly out of love to &#x201C;your Ludship,&#x201D; chiefly from &#x201C;my great opinion of the originality&#x201D; &#x26;c &#x26;c.<note n="21" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jeffrey#x2019;s letter stated: &#x201C;But Murray says he is anxious that you should try whether you can make a better bargain elsewhere&#x201D; and added: &#x201C;I fear the work is too much of the nature of a rhapsody to command success or respectful attention&#x201D;; it also warned Carlyle that unless he abridged the first ten or twelve pages even his &#x201C;judicious readers&#x201D; might stop reading.</note> A poorish offer, Goody; yet perhaps after all, the best I shall get. Better considerably than <hi rend="italic">my</hi> giving &#xa3;150 for the frolic of having written such a Work! I mean to set off tomorrow-morning to Colburn and Bentley (whom Fraser has prepared for me), and ascertain whether they will pay me <hi rend="italic">anything</hi> for a first edition: unless they say about &#xa3;100, I will prefer Murray; unless they look like saying something of that sort, they shall not even see the Article for a week which is the time they require. They are said to be consummate knaves but we can bind them in writing. I hate knaves, but still need money. Murray <hi rend="italic">wished</hi> me to try elsewhere. You shall hear tomorrow how I speed; and then prophecy upon it.&#x2014; Observe, at all events, that I have this day written off to Napier to say that I have a Article on <hi rend="italic">Luther</hi> ready to write, and ask whether he will have it. Fifty pounds will be highly useful (thank God, not yet quite indispensable); and I can gain it handsomely <pb id="pg-05-400" n="05:400"/>in this way. Naso#x2019;s answer cannot be here till the very end of the week.</p>
<p>There, Dearest, are all my news: I was interrupted two pages ago by the interminable Glen; and broke away only after supper: so that it is all very wooden, and would be dull to any one but her it is written for. She will not think it dull; but interesting as the Epistle of a Paul to the Church which is at Craig o#x2019;Putto.</p>
<p>But now it is past eleven considerably; and I must say good night. My health recovered some two days ago from Wardrop#x2019;s dinner, and I am better than before, fully as well as when I left you. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Eheu! Eheu!</hi></foreign> [Alas! Alas!] left, left! It is but an ugly word: however, it will make the sweeter reunion. Let us trust, dear Heart, that it will be all for good; that now as often heretofore mysterious Providence is guiding us even in the way wherein it is best for us to go. Alas! for the &#x201C;two pillows&#x201D;: and I here can only have one; and cannot whisper thee to sleep with assurances often repeated that I love thee: but must pray in the distance that good Spirits have thee in their keeping; and that the &#x201C;king may get <hi rend="italic">his ain</hi> again.&#x201D; So be it, and soon. Sound sleep, my Darling: God ever bless thee!&#x2014;</p>
 <p>Monday, 4 o#x2019;clock.&#x2014; Dearest, tho#x2019; I have made what haste I could, there is now no more than three quarters of an hour to tell thee the things or rather the no-thing done by me. I was at the Colburn#x2019;s about eleven; &#x201C;Mr Bentley<note n="22" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Richard Bentley (<date when="1794-00-00">1794</date>&#x2013;<date when="1871-00-00">1871</date>), prominent publisher who at this time was the partner of Henry Colburn, from whom he parted company in <date when="1832-00-00">1832</date>. See the <ref target="volume-05/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/2171"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref> and R. A. Gettmann, <hi rend="italic">A Victorian Publisher</hi> (Cambridge, <date when="1960-00-00">1960</date>).</note> out, Sir;&#x201D; &#x201C;will be in in half an hour.&#x201D; I toiled onwards to the Duke#x2019;s (in my coarse Boots, for the weather is moist); waited there till after twelve, and after waiting another weary hour in the Bentleyan apartments, saw a coarse muddy, greedy character enter; to whom not without the use of many words now also grown weary to me, I explained myself and <hi rend="italic">Dreck</hi>. The muddy man uttered the common cant of compliments, hinted at the <hi rend="italic">sole</hi> object of Publisher#x2019;s being money; the difference between talent and popularity &#x26;c; and finally concluded by engaging to let me hear from Messrs Colburn and Bentley (so that the speaker was neither of them?) this very night. I might depend upon it. Coming home, I met the drunken Henry Inglis,<note n="23" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Churchill. Cf. <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310824-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1831-08-24">24 Aug.</date></ref></note> a good simple creature whom the Devil has a fair chance for: he (not the Devil) walked up with me; then dinner of indifferent beef-steak (for Goody is not here): and then&#x2014;here am I scribbling as thou seest. Jack also by dint of excessive <pb id="pg-05-401" n="05:401"/>spurring has this moment taken pen to &#x201C;borrow money&#x201D;&#x2014;from Alick, however; whom at present he has a fair prospect of repaying. His stock ran done several days ago. The Lady, who is to see him on Friday, will perhaps proffer payment in advance, but that is far from certain.</p>
<p>I will now predict to you what is to be the purport of the Scoundrels Colburn and Bentley#x2019;s message, since you cannot wait to see it come. It will be that we shall have nothing to do with one another. So much I could gather partly from the muddy man: neither is it of any moment; most probably all for the best. I will prophecy farther that I go over and make an attempt to see Murray tomorrow morning; and if he will put his hand to the plough, and get on with the printing forthwith, I mean to close with him, and have done. The offer is not so bad: 750 Copies for the task of publishing poor Dreck, and the rest of him <hi rend="italic">our own</hi>. If he do <hi rend="italic">not</hi> succeed, how could I ask any man to do more? If he do, then have we opening for another bargain. Let us hope nothing, Goody; then we fear nothing. By one or the other means, our poor little Pot <hi rend="italic">will</hi> keep boiling; and shall, tho#x2019; the Devil himself said nay.</p>
<p>O that you were here, and well lodged, and set in order, and all things &#x201C;swept and garnished.&#x201D; I am not without my doubts as to the suitableness of this place: but we will see farther before you come. At all events, the beauty of a Lodging is that you can go and change it when you will. Perhaps I should wait before fixing anywhere till Goody#x2019;s arrival.</p>
<p>Now endeavour to tell me how all goes with you; whether Alick has come back and brought any of them with him to keep you Company. It is dreadful to be there <hi rend="italic">alone</hi>. If you are quite solitary, saddle Harry any way, and gallop with him: I shall think of you with less pain at Templand, than there unprotected uncomforted; in the midst of savages. Alas! Alas!&#x2014;Have you thought of writing that Letter to George?<note n="24" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Welsh, her uncle.</note> I do not like to urge you, for you seemed disinclined to interfere at all in the destinies of poor Puttoch: at the same time, it is my fixed conviction that such an arrangement were infinitely better for all parties; and my persuasion that it is <hi rend="italic">our</hi> duty to take such steps as may bring it about since no one else will. Beside such savage people, we cannot live: our House like the Frankfort Engraving thereof, becomes a mere picture, and we are homeless in this wild world! If you would &#x201C;much rather&#x201D; not speak of it to George, however, then <pb id="pg-05-402" n="05:402"/>do not: I will consider it better, and see what <hi rend="italic">I</hi> ought to do.&#x2014; My poor Goody!</p>
<p>Above all, Dearest, endeavour to predict when thou wilt be <hi rend="italic">here!</hi> I am not right without thee; nor thou far from me. Have not I a Wifekin; has not my Wifekin a Husband: why are the two Halves not once more a whole? Patience! The day is coming.</p>
<p>The poor Duke is afraid of Revolution; of being turned out (I fancy); and of caps being cloven on all hands. The <hi rend="italic">fears</hi> of Teufelsdreck are trifling, go how it may. At the same time, the world has but a blackish outlook, as I conjecture. All business at a stand; quite uncertain whether the Lords#x2019; House will pass that everlasting Bill: certain that there <hi rend="italic">can</hi> be no reformed Parliament returned sooner than about this time twelvemonth. There will be rick-burning I imagine as last winter. We live in the &#x201C;end of the days.&#x201D;&#x2014; An answer to Empson stands in the last Morning Watch of the Prophets here: Jack told me yesterday that he &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">had</hi> it, see you&#x201D;;&#x2014;to which I answered, The Deevil may care! Ohone aree!<note n="25" place="bottom" type="gloss" >An Irish exclamation of lamentation.</note> did mortal ever see the like? Yet is there meaning even in such madness.&#x2014; Now must I over to Cunningham#x2019;s, and leave my own Wife and Goody. O why cannot I fly away, and take tea with <hi rend="italic">her?</hi> It were so infinitely finer if poured out from our own black pot. O Goody love me always, as I always and with all my soul love thee. <closer><salute>Good night my own Jeannie!</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I delivered your Note to Mr Rees,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of Longmans, Rees &#x26; Co.</note> from whom I experienced the most courteous reception; but for the rest, found matters much as you had represented them. The Book-trade, every one cries, is done; the Public has ceased to buy Books;&#x2014;which step, as I often answer, seemed simply the wisest in that respect the Public has taken since I knew it. &#x201C;Long enough,&#x201D; the Public hereby exclaims, &#x201C;have ye fed <pb id="pg-05-403" n="05:403"/>me on froth and coagulated water; I will have some more solid nourishment, or starve.&#x201D;</p>
<p>In regard to my own small matters it seems likely I may still succeed in making some tolerable engagement; most probably with Mr Murray.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, it has been settled that Mrs Carlyle is to come hither and join me, and we are to pass the winter in London. I am at present scheming out my occupation for the season; and here among the first items I come upon an <hi rend="italic">Essay on Luther</hi>,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Never written.</note> which has lain in my head for several years; which I at one time thought of making into a Book; but now mean to set forth as a Review Article,&#x2014;reserving to myself the right to republish it at some future time in a certain projected Book of mine, where with much else of that sort it may find its fittest place. I apply to you, in the first instance, to see whether such a thing would be suitable. The whole matter is still only like a chaos in my own head: but the materials are in my possession or within my reach, neither is the will wanting. Please therefore to let me know by your earliest convenience what you think of it; whether such an Article would do, and if so when it would be wanted.</p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I have seen the Lord Advocate, who informs me that you are willing to print an Edition of 750 copies of my <hi rend="italic">Ms</hi>. at your own cost, on the principle of what is called &#x201C;half profits&#x201D;; the Copyright of the Book after that to belong to myself.</p>
<p>I came down at present to say that, being very anxious to have you as a Publisher, and to see my Book put forth soon, I am ready to accede to these terms; and should like much to meet you, or hear from you, at your earliest convenience, that the business might be actually <pb id="pg-05-404" n="05:404"/>put in motion.

<salute>My Dearest,</salute>
<p>There is no frank to be had today, tho#x2019; I tried for one: King William, poor fellow, is getting crowned, and the Duke is &#x201C;in the Abbey&#x201D;&#x2014;happily of Westminster.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The &#x201C;Duke&#x201D; is Jeffrey. Carlyle means that he is fortunately not in the Abbey of Holyrood, in Edinburgh, which was a sanctuary for debtors; this privilege was abolished in <date when="1880-00-00">1880</date>. At King William IV#x2019;s coronation on <date when="1831-09-08">8 Sept.</date> his reception by the crowds showed his popularity, although the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> (<date when="1831-09-09">9 Sept.</date>) remarked: &#x201C;It must not pass unnoticed, that the word &#x2018;Reform#x2019; mingled with the loudest shouts.&#x201D;</note> So thou must just pay for it; seeing I will not disappoint thee. Farther I must study to be more concise than usual, and restrict myself to the needful. A half sheet, written last night on the usual principle, must go to waste, or lie waiting for a <foreign>gratis</foreign> conveyance.</p>
<p>The history of <hi rend="italic">Dreck</hi> still sticks simply where it was. The Colburns, on Monday night, as I predicted, will not act; which I am rather glad of, seeing they are sheer villains: next morning I went over to Murray; as usual, could not see him; left a Letter saying that I was <hi rend="italic">ready</hi> for such an engagement, and eager that it should be <hi rend="italic">soon;</hi> and there the matter still lies. Tomorrow I will make another attempt for an interview; and on the whole <hi rend="italic">press</hi> the matter forward with an incessant shouldering, till I see it thro#x2019;. That the poor Book is worth something I feel more and more convinced; that it will ever bring us any <pb id="pg-05-405" n="05:405"/>money seems less and less likely: thank God that we have been able to write it, and to write it <foreign><hi rend="italic">gratis!</hi></foreign> For the rest, the hurry with the publishing of it need not now be so furious, when we have to wait on other grounds here.</p>
<p>On the whole, that Tuesday was but a black day for me. True, in the morning I had some good friendly conversation with Empson and Mill at breakfast, of whom some good will come for us, I think: but after quitting E#x2019;s chambers all went wrong with me. Murray first to be walked to thro#x2019; miles of rain and mud, then to be waited for, then <hi rend="italic">finally</hi> not in: afterwards news for me at the Duke#x2019;s that two Letters <hi rend="italic">had</hi> been there for me, and were there no longer. Unlucky enough! yet I strove to wait for the &#x201C;Twopenny&#x201D; with as much patience as I could; and bolted from my chair, at his well known knock, thinking it was all right: alas, he handed me in one letter, and that from Goethe! Where was Goody#x2019;s? Patience! I said, it will be here by the last delivery sometime between this and ten at night. Thou knowest what it is to <hi rend="italic">wait:</hi> and alas it was waiting in vain; I turned bedwards heavy of heart and quite feverish: blaming the poor Duke (unjustly, considering all his hurries) for not putting both the Letters under one cover. But neither yet were my misfortunes done. Winding up my Watch, as gently as usual, something in it gave way; it was evidently broken! Alas, alas! and so I went to bed, and for noises and inward agitations, and (gracious Heaven!) for <hi rend="italic">bugs</hi> (I need not now conceal it longer) no sleep was to be had till two or three in the morning. It was my miserablest day since I left thee. However, I came to resolutions, and endeavoured to trample it all underfoot, and stand above it.</p>
<p>Happily Wednesday morning of itself brought deliverance. My first visit was from the Twopenny of the prior evening, with apologies for last night<supplied>[#x2019;]</supplied>s mistake, and, infinitely better, with Goody#x2019;s Epistle! All was forgotten when I saw it: almost did I throw down my rasor, or cut my chin, so eager was I to have done with shaving; or to do two impossible simultanieties, to read and shave. Delightful, spirit-like, kind Screamikin! And yet it was painful to me to take such pleasure; for I saw in it all the inevitable materials of a most wretched headache for the poor one herself. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Festina lente</hi></foreign> [make haste slowly], my Dearest; there is time enough to see London, and what good and evil there lies in it for us: do not shatter thy poor nerves in pieces, for thou hast much to go thro#x2019;, and wilt need all thy strength.&#x2014; I ferretted out Stoddart the maker of the Watch, who found the <hi rend="italic">chain</hi> broken (probably the spring <hi rend="italic">not</hi>, but he could not look without deliberation); a new chain would be needed, for it was all quite <hi rend="italic">near</hi> <pb id="pg-05-406" n="05:406"/>being rotten with rust: he could not have it ready in less than two weeks (for certain). He recognised the watch. I took a miserable pinchbeck article to wear in the interim, and left the other with strictest charges to be everyway kind to it. By the bye, bring up the silver one; for I think we must lend it to Doil, were it only to still his croaking: I partly said that I would ask this loan of it.&#x2014; Besides talking immensely with Irving, and with various Insignificants about him and here; copying Goethe#x2019;s Letter<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1831-08-19">19 Aug.</date></note> for Goody, who cannot now see it; writing part of another Letter which also she cannot see; and buying myself a flannel shirt or rather Lamb#x2019;s wool Stocking shirt,&#x2014;I accomplished nothing more on Wednesday. The Stocking shirt was needful, because having but <hi rend="italic">two</hi>, as the Washerwoman comes only weekly, I was incessantly thrown out of a right change. I have some thoughts of treating <hi rend="italic">you</hi> to one of the same: only it will be very bad for myself, nothing less than a new <hi rend="italic">constellation</hi>, and a very sinister one, you wretch! As to Goethe#x2019;s Letter, it contains merely a copy of the two stanzas he sent to Fraser, on the one leaf; and then, on the third page, an announcement that the Parcel came all safe, and he had begun to read in it (<foreign><hi rend="italic">erfreulich</hi></foreign> [with gratification]); farther that the Seal was evidently very gratifying; also that he had gone into &#x2018;a Consideration of the Shades (<foreign><hi rend="italic">Schattenrisse</hi></foreign> [silhouettes]) and thereby an <hi rend="italic">incredible</hi> Approximation of the Absent. Good old man! But I will now keep the Letter here, till I can get kisses for reading it!&#x2014; This morning I went for a frank, and half incidentally saw the Coronation procession, which 70 or 80 thousand woodenheads besides were looking at. It only detained me some five or ten minutes. Mourn not Goody that thou wert absent: it was not worth a walk to Stumpy<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably a cottage near Stumpy wood, to the east of the farm, rather than (as Mary Aitken Carlyle noted) one near its outer gate. No trace of the latter has been found.</note> (even without the Gate which I hope is broken) on a dry day. Quantities of Caps and feathers, and <hi rend="italic">then</hi> at last the royal carriage all made of glass and gilding, more like a huge glass Lantern than anything I ever saw; and then the poor old King and poor ugly Queen, dimly seen sitting like two foolish wax dolls (which they were) letting themselves be trailed, in their lantern go-cart. What took me I know not: but I burst into the heartiest fit of laughter I have had for some time: and perhaps one ought rather to have cried; for it was the ghost of the Past perhaps taking <hi rend="italic">final</hi> leave of a world, where as body or as ghost it has now walked for some three thousand years! Poor King! <pb id="pg-05-407" n="05:407"/>They will be consecrating him and clothing him even now in that old Abbey; and what avails it to him or to me or to any man or woman! <foreign><hi rend="italic">Ex nihilo nihil fit</hi></foreign> [Nothing comes of nothing].<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-04/lt-18260513-TC-JBW-01"><sic>4:87</sic><corr>TC to JBW, <date when="1826-05-13">13 May 1826</date></corr></ref>.</note> And so here I end my History.</p>
<p>The grand question now is: When and How will Goody come? One thing becomes apparent to me, that without fretting herself into a fever, she should <hi rend="italic">lose no time</hi>. After the Bug-discovery which took place exactly the day I wrote last (tho#x2019; they had kept my neck all red ever since I arrived) there seems great probability that this will <hi rend="italic">not</hi> be a suitable lodging for Goody. Poor George has already got a Bug-destroyer (a very curious old Celt) who is earthquaking over the whole house at this hour: but what can <hi rend="italic">he</hi> do? Palliate the evil for a little; scarcely by possibility eradicate it. I have fled into another bed, a thing little bigger or better than a stable-manger, where again I become acquainted with innumerable fleas,&#x2014;and kill a few. The place, I fear in short, will not do. However I have resolved to <hi rend="italic">pig</hi> on, for here in these circumstances it can be but pigging, till thou come; <hi rend="italic">looking out</hi> for new lodgings, a little as I can: then will <hi rend="italic">we</hi> choose one both together. Till then there can be no settlement to anything decided: hence the utility, rather greater than was apparent before, <hi rend="italic">of speed</hi>. As to the arrangements about home, doubtless Goody will settle them all far better herself than I can advise. I think with you the cheapest and therefore the best way of settling with Betty <hi rend="italic">will</hi> be to leave her there till Martinmas. Send Harry to Templand, as you propose; <hi rend="italic">by no means sell him</hi>. Good also is your plan of an inventory: on the whole our rule is, endeavour to keep the poor whinstone house as nearly <hi rend="italic">re</hi>habitable at Spring as possible; in all human probability we shall both be glad to revisit it then, at all events for the warm season; with perhaps the prospect of <hi rend="italic">another</hi> winter#x2019;s emigration. Here, as I doubt, there is no tolerable living (for a permanency) without a house of your own: and of that, no rational hope offers itself at this juncture (eight months#x2019; hardest toil, you see, will hardly be accepted &#x201C;without fee or reward&#x201D;)&#x2014;nay the utmost that even Irving prophecies is that &#x201C;in a year or two&#x201D; I might fall into something. We will hope nothing, and fear nothing. For the present season we are passably secure; and shall accomplish somewhat by living here: neither after that will our united head and heart, by God#x2019;s blessing, fail to help us forward in the way wherein we should go. Come then Dearest to my arms; and I will guard thee from all evil, and thou me; from the only real evil, that of <pb id="pg-05-408" n="05:408"/>losing our inward light. The outward is but a Golgotha at best, which that other has to make alive; let us feel ourselves above it, and bid it do its worst.</p>
<p>Now as to the things fit for being brought hither, it is pity that I have obtained no better knowledge about the expence of carriage, and I see now that corresponding either with Liverpool or Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> will needlessly protract matters. Perhaps (if you have not actually written) the best thing will be to make up your Barrel, and bring it to Liverpool, <foreign><hi rend="italic">coute qui coute</hi></foreign> [whatever the cost], with such light as we have: your Uncle will get it forwarded by the <hi rend="italic">cheapest</hi>, which must be far cheaper than 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi> a lb. Doubtless certainty were better, could it be had, but if it cannot? Besides meal, and a ham, and butter, think generally that whatever is scarce in any town is far scarcer here: also consider the nature of a Lodging house; where many little things (jelly-glasses, butter-knife, for example) are not come-at-able, and yet were good to have. Dear Goody I will leave it all to thy own prophetic judgement; for truly I have now lost all talent for housekeeping, and depend wholly on <hi rend="italic">thee. Warm</hi> clothes in abundance bring for thyself and me (the old <hi rend="italic">frock</hi> will perhaps be my best dressing-gown, but do thou judge); stockings, the black trowsers; I think I have shirts enough; another nightshirt will be good. Nothing of that sort can be had so easily here. With Books I think at this moment I will not trouble thee. Bring me the <hi rend="italic">Blads</hi> (blotting-paper Boards); thy Desk (wilt thou lend it me sometimes?): unhappily my dear old Table cannot be brought. By thy own &#x201C;talent for silence,&#x201D; I think we shall sit here on separate sides of the fire, all forenoon, and I will write, and thou call to see it, as of old.&#x2014; This is all very dim, dear Wifekin, but I <hi rend="italic">have</hi> it no clearer as yet. Do thy best, and I will praise thee for it. What wouldst thou have more? Prophecy too when I am to look for thee? Which of these Letters will be the last! O my Darling thou art half of me; and I am a poor half without thee.&#x2014; Say when Alick is to come up. Of the Bullers I hear nothing; of the Austin nor the noble Lady. To Enfield I think we shall certainly go; Badams called today, is growing better.&#x2014; <closer><salute>And now &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">must</hi> I go?&#x201D; God ever bless thee Dearest Wife!</salute></closer></p>
<closer><salute>Thy own</salute></closer> <name>T.C.</name>
<ps><p>Write a little Line to my Mother, to say that she is to see us again in Spring; that in the meanwhile all goes tolerably on; that I will write soon, at great length, when I get time and a frank. Do this, Darling, as if I were doing it. And now again, Dearest, I must kiss <pb id="pg-05-409" n="05:409"/>thee, and go. Get some sleep, for Heaven#x2019;s sake do, and dream of&#x2014;</p>
<p>The Examiner Editor<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Albany Fonblanque.</note> sends me a kind message thro#x2019; Mill; and will see me so soon as he is visible.</p></ps>

<p>A Thousand thanks my dear kind Mother for sending Jane and Alick to my rescue&#x2014; If some such mercy had not been vouchsafed me I think I must soon have worked myself into a fever or other violent disorder&#x2014;for my talent for fancying things which is quite as great as your own had so entirely got the upper hand of me that I could neither sleep by night nor rest by day&#x2014; I have slept more since they came and have kept me from falling into <hi rend="italic">dreams</hi> than I had done for a fortnight before&#x2014;</p>
<p>I have news if you have not heard it already more joyful to me I suspect than it will prove to you. I am going to my Husband; and as soon as I can get ready for leaving&#x2014;</p>
<p>Now do not grieve that he is not to return so soon as we expected. I am sure it is for his good and therefore for all our goods. <hi rend="italic">Here</hi> he was getting more and more unhappy&#x2014;more and more disatisfied [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] with the world and himself&#x2014;I <hi rend="italic">durst</hi> not have counselled him to such a step&#x2014;but whenever he proposed it himself, I cordially approved it.</p>
<p>But I will tell you all about this and other matters when I come: will indeed bring his long letters to me and read them&#x2014;for I must come and see you all again before I set out.&#x2014; I calculate on getting down the beginning of the week after next.</p>
<p>Carlyle wants me to bring some butter oatmeal &#x26;c with me&#x2014;which are not to be got good in London for love or money&#x2014; And without the smallest remorse I apply to you to help me. I <hi rend="italic">have</hi> some butter of our own cow#x2019;s but it is scattered about in various little pots&#x2014;and could not be conveniently taken&#x2014;besides being salted in small quantities&#x2014;sometimes in warm weather&#x2014;and by <hi rend="italic">my own hands</hi> which are not the most expert in that department. I am afraid it will not be <pb id="pg-05-410" n="05:410"/>good enough to carry so far&#x2014;at all rates inferior to the Scotsbrig thing&#x2014; If you would fill this pig<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;(<hi rend="italic">Piggin, pot</hi>)&#x201D;; &#x201C;Large earthenware <hi rend="italic">pot</hi>&#x201D; (TC#x2019;s note).</note> for me (which holds twenty heavy pounds) at your next churning&#x2014;it would be doing Carlyle a great service and me also in as much as it would relieve my mind of a <hi rend="italic">heavy responsibility</hi>. Jane says it could be churned all at once&#x2014;and expedition is a great object with me.</p>
<p>Jane is going with me to Templand today, as a sort of protection against my Mother#x2019;s agitations&#x2014; Next week she will help me to pack&#x2014;</p>
<p>I send you my cloth pelisse which may perhaps be useful to yourself&#x2014;if not give it to whom you please.</p>

<salute>Dearest Jeannie,</salute>
<p>Having realised a frank, I set forthwith to writing, while opportunity is: tomorrow may belong partly to another; but today the people are all at Church, and I have the house to myself.</p>
<p>Your <foreign>bonny</foreign> little Letter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> (which truly was a very <hi rend="italic">large</hi> one) lay waiting yesterday when I returned from the <hi rend="italic">Museum:</hi> all full of good news; the very bad or indifferent so told as to make them good. Blessings on my Mother! Whatever benefit she may have done you, she has done me a great one: I can now fancy you no longer utterly forsaken; but talking with a Sister, who at least shares your feelings; protected by her if not against evil, yet against the imagination of such, which is often far worse. Tell her to be very good to you; and <pb id="pg-05-411" n="05:411"/>be you the like to her. Wise also is your resolution to take her over to Templand as a shield against &#x201C;scenes&#x201D;: what is the use of scenes, in this rough world where there are so many realities? Also tell my poor <hi rend="italic">Crow</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The nickname of Carlyle#x2019;s sister Jean, also called Jane, who at Templand might help to guard against &#x201C;scenes&#x201D; by Mrs. Welsh.</note> that I often think of her, and look to her, in future days, for the discharge of many duties. It is she that in some measure must now stand in the breach: may she have strength given her to do it faithfully and well.</p>
<p>Poor Betty also gives me pleasure and pain. Repeat to her, what I have already said, that I regard her as the best servant I have ever paid wages to; that it will give me great satisfaction to learn that she stays over winter at Craigenputtoch, which I would gladly pay her for doing, could I afford it; and finally that the instant we do get into any &#x201C;settled way,&#x201D; she shall have the offer of resuming her employments, and see the Master pour out tea for his Wife, in all human probability, many, many times. I clearly think with you, since such is the poor creature#x2019;s disposition, that it were well if she staid: she will be of use to Jenny, to the House, to the &#x201C;Coo&#x201D;: farther there seems very little doubt that before Whitsunday come round we shall need her again, most likely where she is. In London such a servant were of very great consequence to us: anywhere a person truly <hi rend="italic">attached</hi> to you is indeed of tenfold value. If she stay, you should give her some trifle to get tea and sugar for herself; endeavour to chalk out a course for her with Alick (who indeed already likes her), and give her your charges touching all household matters, and a tear at parting and your best blessing. Her reluctance to quit us has given me a very gratifying and worthy feeling: it is as if I, even I, were a protector of some one, and had other fortunes besides our own embarked with me. In this wondrous Babylon I as yet see no fixed outlook, and can scarcely hope for any: but wherever we be, unless times grow infinitely worse than ever, we shall need a servant, and poor Betty is the woman for us, if practicable. My actual theory is that we shall be back with the first fine spring weather: but as yet nothing can be prophecied.</p>
<p>It is essential now that I quit all &#x201C;fine sentiments,&#x201D; and bethink me seriously how poor Goody#x2019;s pilgrimage is to be forwarded. I sent you a foolish lazy message about the cost of carriage hither, which could only have availed had the mail-bags run far quicker than they do. I am now enabled to say with some confidence that the Carriage hither is actually very cheap, if you say &#x201C;per Canal&#x201D;: no more, as W. Hamilton thinks he can assure me, than 4/6 per hundredweight, (delivery <pb id="pg-05-412" n="05:412"/>here included) something like half the carriage from Dumfries to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>. Therefore pack in liberally, dear Goody, whatsoever seemeth good to thee, till thy largest Barrel be full: the only consideration is the Carriage in the Steamboat, which cannot be great, and indeed need not for the present be minded. Except, truly, as it will remain a question (to me not very soluble) whether you ought to take your Barrel <hi rend="italic">with</hi> you, or send it on direct from Dumfries (&#x201C;to lie till called for&#x201D;). I rather incline that way, for this reason: that the Annan Steamboat can only be approached from the Scotch side by small boats, and you will have luggage enough otherwise, and cares enough. If Alick be with you (as you mentioned &#x201C;Thursday&#x201D; for his departure) he can advise you: if not, another journey to Dumfries will be necessary, where Sinclair the Bookseller<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Either James Sinclair, 90 High St., or John Sinclair, 102 High St., Dumfries.</note> (and he only) can tell you everything. Ask him too whether the Article <hi rend="italic">must</hi> &#x201C;lie till called for&#x201D; (when your Uncle could soon settle it all), or the ship-people would themselves punctually forward it &#x201C;by Canal&#x201D;; and not by carrier, or otherwise, or not at all. I think Dumfries will perhaps turn out your best place for disposing of it; at all events that you will there get the needful light on the matter. But for the rest I would not advise you to <hi rend="italic">travel</hi> by the Dumfries Steamboat: because the Annan one has these two advantages; it is some five shillings cheaper; and what is infinitely more important, it is the <hi rend="italic">same</hi> Boat that goes all the way; and you are not, as was my case, obliged to have your luggage tumbled into another vessel (you looking anxiously on, all the while) and to wait some five or six hours at Whitehaven with nothing earthly to do; but at worst, you ride in the Liverpool roads till the tide serve, and can lie in bed if you like. Alick or Jamie will of course go down with you; you will see in the first place if there be any <hi rend="italic">bed</hi> (which in the Ladies#x2019; Cabin is likely); at worst select yourself a <hi rend="italic">Sofa:</hi> take your bandbox down thither, and then you have nothing farther to care for. Alas! I fear poor Goody will be sick: unless you can sit on the deck, which at night will never do. Take unspeakable wrappages of Clothes, Cloaks, Robroys,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cloaks or coats in the black and red Rob Roy tartan.</note> what not: they are easily carried. If you get fine weather, it is a fine sail; and, in any case, some three and twenty hours ends it. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Ach Gott</hi></foreign> [Oh Lord]!

I once said <hi rend="italic">the Mail;</hi> which, if the <hi rend="italic">hour</hi> suit you, is as good as any: but there are other coaches, it appears, that run <hi rend="italic">all thro#x2019;;</hi> and you can either have a journey of a <hi rend="italic">day</hi> and a <hi rend="italic">night</hi>, or of a night and a day (the whole time being about 22 hours or so); the former of which plans I reckon better. The Mail, I fancy, will reach this about half-past five in the morning. If you can, get a Coach that will run the whole way; at all events, ascertain <hi rend="italic">how often</hi> you are to be shifted: with me it happened seven times; and I found it troublesome enough. Write to me by post when your seat is taken; and sure enough, I will be on the ground! Yet should the Devil after all be in it, and no Husband makes his appearance (being on the Watch far elsewhere); then do you simply desire the guard to get you a Hackney Coach, and name this address, and all is still well. Lastly let me advise thee, Goody, to carry a paperbag of victual with thee: I got <hi rend="italic">one penny loaf</hi> all the way hither.

Also, while at the Craig, continue to drink thy little glasskin, while there is a drop of Port in the house: we shall get more; and never never can it go a better road.

<p>Now here is instruction enough with a vengeance about <hi rend="italic">travelling:</hi> it were perhaps more to the point could I say something definite about what you are to bring with you; but here my light very much fails me; I can only jot down this and the other suggestion, with the certainty <pb id="pg-05-414" n="05:414"/>that much will be forgotten. In several Lodginghouses I find it asked: Do you use your own <hi rend="italic">plate</hi>, and bed-and-table <hi rend="italic">linen?</hi> The latter item I think will <hi rend="italic">not</hi> be worth attending to <supplied>[(]</supplied>except perhaps a few <hi rend="italic">towels</hi>, <hi rend="small-caps">if</hi> you are not pressed for room): but with regard to &#x201C;our own <hi rend="italic">plate</hi>,&#x201D; I imagine it will be very <hi rend="italic">easy to carry;</hi> tho#x2019; whether of any use when carried, let Goodykin herself judge. My highland Bonnet she will of her own accord remember. Also my inkbottle Stand (the wooden penholder, I mean). The <hi rend="italic">tea-caddy</hi> will come at any rate with the &#x201C;Books&#x201D;: various little lockfast articles of that kind would be serviceable. You <hi rend="italic">may</hi> bring the rest of my new shirts: I find a cotton one or two here; and these the washerwoman will spoil, if she get them often. Of Books you may bring at most (and only if you have room) the Spanish, Italian, Latin (Adams) and Greek Dictionaries (the Foreign-English <hi rend="italic">parts</hi> only, where they are parted); Arrowsmith#x2019;s Atlas;<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18200607-TC-MAL-01"><sic>1:261</sic><corr>TC to MAL, <date when="1820-06-07">7 June 1820</date></corr></ref>.</note> the third volume of <hi rend="italic">Fl&#xF6;gel</hi>,<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-05/lt-18300126-TC-DA-01">TC to DA, <date when="1830-01-26">26 Jan. 1830</date></ref>.</note> the very thin <foreign><hi rend="italic">Hutten#x2019;s Leben</hi></foreign> [<hi rend="italic">Life of Hutten</hi>]:<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310228-TC-JGC-01">TC to JGC, <date when="1831-02-28">28 Feb.</date></ref></note> nothing more will I add; indeed even these are not essential, seeing they can be borrowed.

<p>You will of course direct your Barrel to this place; tho#x2019; whether we may stay here is quite problematical: we shall likely be in the neighbourhood at least. Our house is one of the handsomest to look upon, at the money; rather thrifty also, and belongs to an honest-minded landlord: but here I think its advantages seem to end. The noise outwardly is not inconsiderable, and within we have a slamming and a clanking which I, &#x201C;albeit of firmest nerve,&#x201D; sometimes find unpleasant. I have been in various Lodgings, and find that for about the same sum we shall accommodate ourselves tolerably enough. One or two were even of an inviting character: the <hi rend="italic">worst</hi> I saw was one the various items of which amounted to the easy rent of 3 guineas week or more; in the nastiest, noisiest, but then a fashionable street! The Landlady wore a wig, and had a look of second table knavery. In all of these places, when you take the people strictly to task, they will admit that <hi rend="italic">bugs</hi> have (as if by miracle) appeared; but that, by assiduous washing they &#x201C;keep them down.&#x201D; The scratch-wig Landlady used these very words. On the whole, however, I do not think they will afflict us much: the winter proves fatal to them of itself, and some of the people look so tidy and decent you could not fancy them <pb id="pg-05-415" n="05:415"/>in such company. <hi rend="italic">Here</hi> the Bug-subduer (Homer calls Hector the Horse-subduer) has filled everything with <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;saft-saip&#x201D;;</hi> so that the whole insect world must have expired of despair: at worst I do not mind them, or care for them (if I did) overmuch. The Devil is busy everywhere: but even as Legion (of scandalous insects) one should withstand him and defy him. For the rest, more especially with such shifting from room to room, we are somewhat disorderly here; it is all that I can do to clutch my own things together, and keep the whole from running to huggermugger. Jack and George have <hi rend="italic">both</hi> to sleep in the &#x201C;horse-manager&#x201D;: poor fellows! but they heed it not, nor its more or less vigorous population; a faculty which I must envy. To say truth, I have got this room (it is in the Bedroom I now and usually write) made tolerably clear again; fancy there are indeed no Bugs or other vermin in it: and shall stay peaceably till Goody come and try it, and say Yes or No. She shall herself have it a-deciding.</p>
<p>As our Post makes so slow a return, it were perhaps good for me to make some <hi rend="italic">guess</hi> at the time of your coming. This Letter you receive on Wednesday next: who knows but you may be off before the <hi rend="italic">following</hi> one. Say, shall I write again? Alas, you cannot say; not before it will be too late. Well, on [<hi rend="italic">for</hi> written above <hi rend="italic">on</hi>] Saturday I shall write at all events; and with regard to Wednesday shall gather instruction from your Letters.&#x2014; As to money I think your own plan is the best: to get what you need from Alick, whom we can repay. I meant that Naso should pay (<hi rend="italic">to</hi>) you the (<hi rend="italic">price of the article on</hi>) Taylor at Dumfries: however I will not now trouble him. Remember only that whatever cash you do take with you must be changed into gold or Bank of England notes before you leave Dumfries: otherwise you have to seek Jews at Liverpool, and pay them some sixpence in the pound. If there be any spare weight in this frank I may send you a note or two: we shall see.</p>
<p>Here then is all the business part of the matter copiously discussed; and now I may take my ease a little, and gossip with you. My own history since thursday is soon told; for unfortunately it amounts to little more than zero. <hi rend="italic">Dreck</hi> again lies tied together in my trunk; and for aught I see may lie some time: I have written and travelled to Albemarle Street, but never once succeeded in getting a glimpse or a word of the Pontiff. He is said to be out of town last day I was over; and not to return till Tuesday, when I shall march over again. Courage! Courage! Neither let the unregenerate man lament that he is thus foiled, and lightly esteemed: it is good for him that he should be so tried, if he be wise. Nay, if Murray will not say something reasonable, <pb id="pg-05-416" n="05:416"/><hi rend="italic">Dreck</hi> shall take his ease where he is: some one will by and by print him, if he be wanted in the world: that we have written him is still a kind of comfort. Of Napier no tidings: indeed it is yet little more than time. Nothing from the Bullers: the Austin (whom you need not fear <hi rend="italic">my</hi> liking too well) I consider to be gone thither. We have realised some oatmeal; purchased some in the Strand (baddish at 4/4 the stone), and directly after got a present of some from Mrs Hamilton. She added an invitation to Dinner, which we forcibly converted into a <hi rend="italic">tea:</hi> Irving was there, and various nondescripts; a certain Mr Goldie<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly Rev. James Goldie (<date when="1763-00-00">1763</date>&#x2013;<date when="1847-00-00">1847</date>), minister of Temple, Midlothian.</note> who appeared to be from East Lothian; then Mrs Scott wife of my Double;<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Wife of Rev. Alexander Scott. See <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310822-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1831-08-22">22 Aug.</date></ref></note> finally, before supper, my Double himself. I talked hither and thither <hi rend="italic">Teufelsdreckish:</hi> what could I do? My Double is rather an extremely attenuated copy of Brand of Craighouse;<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Some Dumfriesshire neighbor.</note> an enthusiastic, honest, exceedingly narrow individual. His wife interested me somewhat: in face and in character she reminded me of one<note n="15" place="bottom" type="gloss" >His sister Margaret.</note> who now lies beneath the ground; whose still dwelling, in these insane tumults, my imagination often visits. O Jeannie, what is Life? Is not Death far purer and higher? Patience! That too is coming: be faithful yet a little; in due time ye shall reap if ye faint not.</p>
<p>The Montague I saw yesterday: you had not <hi rend="italic">dated</hi> her Note; she was looking forward to see you (uncertain whether you might not be already at her door) with a quite inexpressible anxiety. Her daughter is ill, and must go to Brighton: but she will wait, or do any possible way, to be here and receive you. What a pity that Life is not &#x201C;goot worts&#x201D; as Fluellen<note n="16" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not Fluellen of <hi rend="italic">Henry V</hi>, but his fellow-Welshman, Sir Hugh Evans, of <hi rend="italic">Merry Wives</hi>, I, l.</note> called them! Then were the noble lady your woman. As it is you will not fail to like her as well as you can: I imagine she looks forward with some interest to have a bout of doctoring and tutoring you; I, having grown out of that relation, have become partially unserviceable. After all, she is infinitely better than the vulgar of women<supplied>[;]</supplied> let us even honour her, and pity her, and kindly regard her, the best we can. To Badams she and I make no even faintest allusion. Mrs Procter is not yet returned.</p>
<p>Farther I have made a pretty discovery: that of a really excellent Library, where one <hi rend="italic">can read;</hi> where I calculate on studying almost daily thro the winter. It is the British Museum; a place now in excellent <pb id="pg-05-417" n="05:417"/>order. You too, if you like, shall go: there are whole immensities of copperplates, and what not; and you may sit beside me and study what you list, on this one condition, of not speaking and not stealing. I am very glad of this: I tried the place in my former sojourn, but found it useless; and had given it up: it is nowise so.</p>
<p>Thus, Dearest, thou seest my days flow rather uselessly along. If Naso do not write soon, I will seek some other task, were it the meaner. No man can force you to lie idle, but only yourself. Neither is the world <hi rend="italic">shut</hi> against any one; but it is <hi rend="italic">he</hi> that is shut. God grant us some little touch of Wisdom; let Fate turn up what card she likes, so we can but play it well. I feel as if I had yet much to suffer, but also something to do. Do thou help me, my little Woman; thou art worthy of that destiny; and perhaps it is appointed thee. These are fearful times; yet is there greatness in them: now is the hour when he that feels himself a man, should stand forth and prove himself such. Oh <hi rend="italic">could</hi> I but live in the light of that holy purpose, and keep it ever present before me, I were happy, too happy!</p>
<p>Meanwhile, unfortunately, for these many months, and now as formerly, I am rather wicked. Alas! Why should I dwell in the element of contempt and indignation, not rather in that of patience and love. I was reading in Luther#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Tischreden</hi> [dinner speeches], <note n="17" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Tischreden oder Colloquia Doct. Mart. Luthers</hi> (Eisleben, <date when="1566-00-00">1566</date>).</note> and absolutely felt ashamed. What have I suffered, what did he suffer! One should actually, as Irving advises, &#x201C;pray to the Lord, &#x201D;&#x2014;did one but know how to do it. The <hi rend="italic">best</hi> worship, however, is stout Working. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Frisch zu</hi></foreign> [go to it]!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I have not seen the Duke for a week; today I <hi rend="italic">sent up</hi> for my frank; and did it rather awkwardly, owing to the awkwardness of a servant: Lord Something or other was with him, and I grew tired of waiting. Two more franks I must beg (it is a great happiness this quite careless writing); and then probably our interviews will be still rarer. I acknowledge in myself a certain despicable tendency to think crabbedly of the poor Duke: a quite vulgar feeling it is; merely as if he were not kind enough to <hi rend="italic">me</hi>. Is he not kinder than most other men are? Shame on me! Out of various motives, among which love is not wholly wanting, he really wishes to do me good: are not all others of his order indifferent to me; should not he be at all times <hi rend="italic">more</hi>, and not <hi rend="italic">less?</hi> Yet is his path not my path; nor are his thoughts my thoughts: it becomes more and more clear to me that we shall never do any good together. Let him come and sit with you in that &#x201C;flowerpot <pb id="pg-05-418" n="05:418"/>tub&#x201D; if he like; let us do him what kindness we can, which is not much; and stand ever with kind looks in that direction, yet always too on our own side of the strand: frivolous Gigmanity <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> unite itself to our stern destiny; let it pass by on the other side.&#x2014;&#x2014; But O my dear Jeannie, do help me to be a little softer, to be a little merciful to <hi rend="italic">all</hi> men, even Gigmen! Why should a man tho#x2019; bilious, never so &#x201C;nervous,&#x201D; impoverished, bugbitten, and bedevilled, let Satan have dominion over him? Save me, save me, my Goody! It is on this side that I am threatened: nevertheless we <hi rend="italic">will</hi> prevail I tell thee; by God#x2019;s blessing we will and shall.</p>
<p>I must now retire; for it is nigh suppertime (dinner and tea intervened about the beginning of this sheet): a little space also must be left for the morrow. Dear Wife, do not thou forsake me, never even in thought; let thy true heart be ever a safe home for my afflicted and too exasperated heart; let us be in very deed <hi rend="italic">one!</hi> I now begin to know what is Love: it depends on no whims, no accidents; it is the first of truths for man, and the root of all strength in him. Neither shalt <hi rend="italic">thou</hi> fear the Devil the world nor the Flesh, at my side. Fear nothing, but love one another, and all the world: that is our rule.&#x2014;&#x2014; Finally Goody the great practical &#x201C;use of improvement&#x201D; is: Come to me with all decent speed; for thou seest it is not well for me to be alone. And so, Lovekin, Good night; and may all true Thoughts, which are better than sweet dreams be with thee! <foreign><hi rend="italic">A Dios Se&#xf1;ora mia</hi></foreign> [Farewell, my lady]!</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Monday, one o#x2019;clock</hi>.&#x2014; I come in from wandering over the Chaos to my own little cell, and my own little Goody: there is yet time enough to fill the sheet.&#x2014; First touching things <hi rend="italic">to be brought</hi>, let me get an additional item or two off my hand lest I again forget them. Bring thy bit Coffee-mill; otherwise we get nothing but vapid Coffee. Nay I am not sure but a Black Teapot (of the sixpenny sort) ought also to be imported. Do not forget <hi rend="italic">Ham</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Hams!</hi> It is the grand <foreign>succedaneum</foreign> here for breakfast condiments. Eggs I can dispense with: but we <hi rend="italic">will</hi> have a pennyworth of cream (if we can get it), such dishwashing is the tea without it. I reckon that we shall (perhaps) have a lockfast cellar, into which all these things can be stowed: some places specially offer such a convenience. Potatoes are <hi rend="italic">not</hi> worth carrying; they can be had eatable here: however, I find, a Goody to make markets is indispensable; our servant contrives even to get us baddish beef: the mutton universally is said to be diseased, and proves uneatable. Farther you are to look at Scotsbrig if you can find a certain German Italian Grammer of Jack#x2019;s: it is a smallish octavo in blue boards, or <pb id="pg-05-419" n="05:419"/>cover; the <hi rend="italic">name</hi> I have forgot: &#x201C;there can be no possibility,&#x201D; he says, &#x201C;but they will find it.&#x201D; To which I answer that there is a decided probability of their <hi rend="italic">not</hi> finding it. Do thy best. Remember generally with regard to <hi rend="italic">my</hi> Books that they are of almost no consequence, and may be left if room is scanty, or if the Barrel seem dangerous for wet.&#x2014;&#x2014; One other little piece of business news I despatch, and then have done: On Saturday night I went to visit the poor Watch; found it all clear and alive again, and that nothing but the <hi rend="italic">chain</hi> had been injured: the man wanted it for another week; after which an incidental regulation would suffice. It is two miles off me, in the very heart of <hi rend="italic">operative</hi> London. I think, old Stoddart must be dead: at least the man speaks about &#x201C;my Father,&#x201D; what excellent Watches they made, what excellent prices they got.</p>
<p>This morning the St. Pancras Clock striking 7 and a foolish <foreign><hi rend="italic">Messin</hi></foreign> [cur] barking apparently at <hi rend="italic">it</hi>, awoke me in sulkyish humour. Buonaparte#x2019;s saying came into my head: <foreign><hi rend="italic">vous vous &#xE9;coutez trop</hi></foreign> [you listen to yourself too much].<note n="18" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. &#x201C;Characteristics,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XXVIII, 20.</note> I walked up to the Regent#x2019;s Park to consider it. After breakfast, in a sort of desperate resolution to <hi rend="italic">be</hi> at <hi rend="italic">work</hi> some way, I walked over to James Fraser#x2019;s, asking myself all the way whether I absolutely would not write a <hi rend="italic">Dud</hi> for him on the <hi rend="italic">Life of Johnson</hi>. Thou hast never yet written Duds, said I to myself: <hi rend="italic">do not</hi>, I intreat thee, never do! At length I had partially resolved, if he again entreated me, to write him a <hi rend="italic">real</hi> paper, knowing beforehand that it was to be for nothing. Happily the creature did not entreat me: so I talked hither and thither upon the ways of the Devil in this noble City; appointed Will<hi rend="italic">m</hi> Fraser (who is expected today) to come and meet me; and so with clear conscience left the poor man,&#x2014;an innocent creature, one of Irving#x2019;s hearers; but mostly made of timber.</p>
<p>Returning, I looked in upon the noble Lady to ask a <hi rend="italic">Letter</hi> from Montague, certifying to the Museum Keepers that I probably would not <hi rend="italic">steal:</hi> this is a preliminary to your regularly reading there. It is to wait me tomorrow morning. The Lady was bright, and all agog about her &#x201C;dear Friend,&#x201D; and &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">what</hi> she could do for her.&#x201D; I pointed out a course for her, which was simply to rest upon her oars, and do <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi>, till we got settled in Lodgings, which I assured her you had great talents for choosing. Then she would have <hi rend="italic">me</hi> connected with the <hi rend="italic">New Monthly Magazine</hi>, thro#x2019; her means; to which I answered that it was impossible for a man like me to <hi rend="italic">offer</hi> himself on any one; but if any Editorial Gentlemen came to me with a proposal, I should be ready <pb id="pg-05-420" n="05:420"/>as a pocket-whistle with a civil answer. We parted in the firmest bonds of a Holy Alliance&#x2014;so far as &#x201C;goot worts&#x201D; can weave such. I will say nothing more against your Ideal: come and look upon her; and let me see how the Scotch clearness, love, and sincerity will demean itself in the element of Bedford Square: &#x201C;a <hi rend="italic">mixture</hi>,&#x201D; like most other things, &#x201C;of good and evil, mother.&#x201D;<note n="19" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech.

<p>I had thoughts, as I came homewards, of running out to Badams for a day or two, who strongly invites me. <hi rend="italic">You</hi> are already promised there: I believe you will like Badams; there is <hi rend="italic">much</hi> sound stuff in him, both of head and heart; and by Heaven#x2019;s blessing all these agonies will purify him and turn for good. His Wife, as I said, is a truehearted, warm inexperienced <hi rend="italic">girl</hi>&#x2014;of perhaps your own age. Of the Stracheys I hear nothing; nevertheless you shall see Julia,<note n="20" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mrs. Edward Strachey.</note>&#x2014;fixed (poor Julia!) as in a frost: that is my theory of her. Irving is gone out of town this morning with his Wife; who accordingly will be absent when you come. Irving himself returns before Sunday. Mrs Irving will do little for you: her whole dialect is impregnated with &#x201C;the Laart&#x201D;; otherwise she is a woman of honest principle, helpful, kind of speech; and has simply one imperfection she is an <foreign><hi rend="italic">Anempfinderinn</hi></foreign> [one who adapts her sentiments] (a &#x201C;feeler like&#x201D;&#x2014;others)&#x2014;as Goethe calls the Frau Melina,<note n="21" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meisters Lehrjahre</hi>.</note> in a quite different environment.

<p>Naso writes me a very kind Letter this morning:<note n="22" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dated <date when="1831-09-09">9 Sept.</date></note> it lay waiting when I returned hither, and I rejoiced that Fraser had not opened his wooden jaw. He, the great Naso, is not indisposed for <hi rend="italic">Luther;</hi> only fears he cannot give me room enough; 35 pages is all that he can spare. Withal he suggests another Book (&#x201C;Anastasius&#x201D; Hope#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Thoughts on Man</hi>,<note n="23" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Hope (<date when="1770-00-00">1770</date>?&#x2013;<date when="1831-00-00">1831</date>), <hi rend="italic">An Essay on the Origin and Prospect of Man</hi>, 3 vols. (London, <date when="1831-00-00">1831</date>). Hope, born and brought up in Holland, came to England in <date when="1796-00-00">1796</date>. He was a dilettante and collector of works of fine art; published on art and also the romance <hi rend="italic">Anastasius</hi> (<date when="1819-00-00">1819</date>).</note> or some such title); tho#x2019; he could do well with Luther too I think: that <hi rend="italic">Hope</hi> I will go out and seek and look into before I be many days older; it will be far easier than Luther, which last can stand over. I mean to try one or the other without delay: they will keep the pot boiling, which is something, as matters go.&#x2014;</p>
<p><pb id="pg-05-421" n="05:421"/>Here, however, Darling must I terminate for once. I had thoughts of writing &#x201C;little<supplied>[&#x201D;]</supplied> Jane a note, but the frank will not carry it, I fear. Tell her that I am <hi rend="italic">very</hi> glad to think of her being with you, and give her my best brotherly blessing. There is much in Jane. Tell her to keep a true heart and an open sight; to fear nothing but God only, to love all things but the Devil only.&#x2014; Ask her what of the Scotsbrig Harvest; which I often think of in these miserable dripping days. Alas for Jamie! Never had gallant less furtherance from a &#x201C;dying paarent&#x201D; in any matrimonial enterprize. The criticism also was <hi rend="italic">true</hi>, and of emphasis unparalleled.<note n="24" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Apparently something told in Jane#x2019;s lost letter, which may have been too outspoken about family matters to have been preserved.

<p>Jack has seen his Countess again: she is bent for the <date when="1831-10-01">first of October</date>; he is to meet her at Canterbury; then onward to Paris to stay there for a fortnight; then some months at Nice (in the South of France); and so gently along by Turin to Italy and Rome and what not. <hi rend="italic">The Doctor is to ride in a Carriage by himself!</hi> Do but consider this one fact.

<p>Enough now, dear Jeannie: have I not given thee enough?

<name>T. Carlyle&#x2014;</name>
<ps><p>Mind to <hi rend="italic">mark</hi> all your washing Clothes, and mine, with marking ink, or otherwise. The shirts I have here had to be marked before they could be sent out: I was so weary, that morning; and Jack did it&#x2014;far from well.</p>
<p>Forget not <hi rend="italic">woolen</hi> things, so many as you have, for us both.</p>
<p>I send you <hi rend="italic">four</hi> pound-notes; the frank will not bear another grain; I close it with a <hi rend="italic">wafer</hi>, to be safe.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-05-422" n="05:422"/>I think you must call at Mundells,<note n="25" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In Dumfries.</note> and get him to make you up, say <hi rend="italic">eight quarters</hi> of tobacco: if he can recommend it as among his best get <hi rend="italic">sixteen;</hi> all <hi rend="italic">well</hi> wrapped up; and perhaps it were go<supplied>[od if]</supplied> some one <hi rend="italic">saw</hi> them weighed.

<salute>Dearest Love</salute>
<p>I found four letters at Thornhill yesterday one from Sam Aitken, one from M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Donaldson one from Alick (as had been arranged at part<supplied>[in]</supplied>g) enclosing the Bill for John, and one from my own darling Good. Thine Dearest frightened me&#x2014;addressed in thy own hand&#x2014; Was Jeffrey ill as the newspapers are reporting? or were you quarreled with him as you seemed in the road to do? Neither thank God Only the poor old wax doll getting its crown put on&#x2014;but it <hi rend="italic">saddened</hi> me also and <hi rend="italic">that</hi> impression is scarce worn off yet.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not franked by Jeffrey, because, as Jane saw after reading all the letters, he had been at the coronation.</note> It was not the bugs alone which to say the truth <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;gave me a sort of shock&#x201D;</hi>&#x2014;it was the tone of the whole letter&#x2014;the <hi rend="italic">effort</hi> to be cheerful which I perceived in it and which perhaps none but I who know you so well would have perceived. You were not &#x2018;happy#x2019;&#x2014; And <hi rend="italic">I</hi> not with you! No Goody to kiss you into good humour, or if that were found impossible to bear you company in ill humour. I thought of you and dreamt of you all night in your solitary &#x2018;manger,#x2019; and shall have no peace till we are reunited&#x2014; I will make you up a bed on the drawing-room floor, and sleep on it beside you (better than I have done of late in our own fine red one) if there be no other way of escaping vermin. So be of good heart and defy this new temptation of the Devil&#x2014; One has always a tossing and tumbling for a while in every new situation. The <pb id="pg-05-423" n="05:423"/>business is to ascertain what situation is the <hi rend="italic">fittest</hi>&#x2014;and then set a stout heart to a steep <foreign>brae</foreign><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Proverbial.</note>&#x2014; At Craigenputtoch we have always had a secret suspicion that we were quite wrong&#x2014;removed out of the sphere of human activity fully as much thro#x2019; cowardice as superior wisdom&#x2014;(am I not right in regard to you as well as myself) and thus all our doings are without heart and our sufferings without dignity&#x2014; With a goal before me I feel I could leap sixbar gates&#x2014;but how dispiriting tethered on a barren heath&#x2014;running round and round&#x2014; Yet let it not be forgotten that at Craigenputtoch you have written Teufe<supplied>[l]</supplied>sdreck&#x2014;yes the candle sometimes burns its way <hi rend="italic">thro#x2019;</hi> the bushel&#x2014;but what a waste of light!</p>

<p>I wrote to Sam and my Uncle<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Samuel Aitken in Edinburgh and John Welsh in Liverpool.</note> on Thursday<supplied>[.]</supplied> Sam#x2019;s answer throws little new light on the matter&#x2014;but confirms me in what I supposed that Leith<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The port of Edinburgh.</note> were out of the question&#x2014; Things are charged in the smacks by <hi rend="italic">bulk</hi> not weight except in cases of lead or iron&#x2014;</p>

<salute>Dearest,</salute>
<p>I have lit my candle, and mounted up hither in the Autumnal dusk; minded, as usual, to take Occasion by the forelock. The folding window is partially open, but the curtains are drawn, and I sit behind the <hi rend="italic">cheek</hi> [side] that my light may not blow. Hundreds of noisy urchins are sporting on the street; from the New Road comes that old unresting hum of carriage-wheels and quadrupeds and bipeds: if I look out I see upwards the beautiful top of St Pancras Steeple against the sky; downwards a flagged snug little street mostly of shops; among which figures &#x201C;the Cheapest Shop in the World for Combs and Brushes&#x201D;&#x2014;alas! with its windows closed, and inwardly a mere vacuum of Bankruptcy<supplied>[.]</supplied> Many a half-laugh half-<foreign>greet</foreign> [lament] has that poor &#x201C;Cheapest Shop in the world&#x201D; caused me: here too was a little adventure, great as the finding of America, for its adventurer; with resolute daring, the poor little fellow bent him to the emprize; took the Devil also into partnership, and tried puffing: but it would not do; day after day the prospect grew darker, till it ended in utter midnight, and now, as we perceive he has <hi rend="italic">bankraped and gone out of sight!</hi> Stands it not like a little <foreign><hi rend="italic">Siste Viator</hi></foreign> [Stop, passerby], as a warning to us also? May the Gods avert the omen!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">&#x201C;Bankraped&#x201D;</hi> etc. is coterie speech. Cf. <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310826-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1831-08-26">26 Aug.</date></ref> <foreign><hi rend="italic">Siste Viator</hi></foreign> (a common inscription on tombs), Carlyle associates with another Latin phrase, <foreign><hi rend="italic">Absit omen</hi></foreign> [Evil omens apart].</note> At all events, the Devil shall not be of our firm: neither will we wait till midnight, but retire at sunset. So fear nothing.</p>
<p>However, it is not of my local environment but of myself and history that Goody is curious to hear. Listen then Goodykin, and thou shalt learn Biographical facts unparalelled [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] in importance since <pb id="pg-05-427" n="05:427"/>the times of P. P. Clerk of this Parish.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle refers to the <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of P.P., Clerk of the Parish</hi>, one of the Scriblerus papers, by either Pope or Arbuthnot, satirizing Gilbert Burnet#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">History of His Own Time</hi> (<date when="1724-00-00">1724</date>).</note>&#x2014; And yet why should I mock even over myself and my doings? To one true heart they are infinitely important; in themselves therefore as great as Moscow Retreats and Battles of Austerlitz; or very little smaller, for the whole Planet is extremely small. My Josephine I reckon is the greater of the two.</p>
<p>On Monday Night I walked round from putting in your Letter, and borrowed me the last Quarterly Review, to read the Article there on the Saint Simonians by Southey.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A review of the <hi rend="italic">Doctrine de Saint Simon. Exposition. Premi&#xE8;re Ann&#xE9;e. <date when="1828-00-00">1828</date>&#x2013;<date when="1829-00-00">1829</date>. Seconde &#xE9;dition</hi> (Paris, <date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>), <hi rend="italic">Quarterly Review</hi>, XLV (<date when="1831-07-00">July 1831</date>), 407&#x2013;50. It is highly critical of the &#x201C;New Christianity&#x201D; promulgated by Saint-Simon, critical of &#x201C;religious and political views alike blasphemous and dangerous,&#x201D; and apprehensive of its teaching on a &#x201C;New Distribution of Property.&#x201D;</note> It is an altogether miserable Article; written in the spirit not of a Philosopher but of a Parish Precentor: he knows what they are <hi rend="italic">not</hi>, so far at least as the thirty nine Articles go; but nothing whatsoever of what they <hi rend="italic">are</hi>. &#x201C;My Brother I say unto thee, thou art a poor creature.&#x201D; The rest of the Review is also despicable enough: blind, shovel-hatted, hysterically lachrymose. Lockhart, it seems, edits it out of Roxburghshire, rusticating by some &#x201C;Burn&#x201D; in that county. I calculate that Murray will veer round by and by, and pay him off.</p>
<p>Tuesday morning my first work was to write off to the Longmans for a copy of that Hope#x2019;s Book;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310911-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1831-09-11">11 Sept.</date></ref></note> to which application I have yet had no manner of answer. Empson, whom I had called upon the night before for a minute, indicated to me that such might be the rational plan. I have tried in three places elsewhere; in one of which (the Publisher#x2019;s) I <hi rend="italic">shall</hi> get it soon: perhaps I may try in a fourth tomorrow to get it <hi rend="italic">directly</hi>. The poor Author is dead: he sent to his Publisher (Murray) some little time before his death, solemnly taking leave of him, and entrusting that work to his friendly care. It is full of heterodoxy and scepticism. Whether it will do for a conduit to any of my meditations I doubt: but should like to know. Naso evidently wants me to write: so either on this or something I ere long will. It is my far best course for the time. By and by, I think, there will a new seed arise to do the world service in quite another fashion: nay I can partly see it already sprouting. Again I repeat to myself: Write no Duds, never do!&#x2014; That same morning I saw the noble Lady for a moment; learned that her Daughter was recovering; and got the <pb id="pg-05-428" n="05:428"/>Museum Letter from her, wherewith in few minutes more I had procured a ticket for myself, and was reading on my own basis. It is a quite capital Library: you shall go too, if you have &#x201C;any talent.&#x201D; The <hi rend="italic">sights</hi> in the place one can see without tickets. At night John Mill came in, and sat talking with me till near eleven: a fine, clear Enthusiast, who will one day come to something. Yet to nothing Poetical, I think: his fancy is not rich; furthermore he cannot <hi rend="italic">laugh</hi> with any compass. You will like Mill. Glen<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Glen.</note> is a man of greatly more natural material; but hitherto he is like a blind Cyclops, <hi rend="italic">ill</hi> educated, yet capable of good education: he may perhaps reap great profit from us; as at least he is well disposed to do. Three days ago he left me <hi rend="italic">six cigars</hi>, and went off to the North: he will perhaps be at Craigenputtoch! I said within <hi rend="italic">two</hi> weeks he would find you there, and might ride over from Kirkpatrick (where he is to visit); within <hi rend="italic">three</hi> weeks he himself said he would still try. Nearly to a certainty he will <hi rend="italic">not</hi> find you there.</p>
<p>This morning I caught your Letter before it fell into the hands of the rascally Twopennies (poor fellows! not rascally when they <hi rend="italic">bring</hi> me letters); and read it beside the two Charlotte#x2019;s,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jeffrey#x2019;s wife and daughter.</note> drinking at the same time a supernumerary cup of tea with them, for they were just beginning breakfast. &#x201C;Saym relish&#x201D; with his Huntress<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Jeffrey and one of the Hunter sisters. See <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310815-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1831-08-15">15 Aug.</date></ref></note> was on a visit out of town; the Duke still dressing in the back drawing room where he sleeps. The Dames both <hi rend="italic">jerked</hi>, as I imagined, when they heard of your approach; the younger especially: but I reassured them with information that you would be lodged at a great distance, and get &#x201C;little good of them.&#x201D; &#x201C;We will come in the carriage, and take her out with us,&#x201D; said the elder; to which I responded nothing in words, but in thought a presumptive negation. Meanwhile they are to drive hither next Sunday, and hear Irving: I almost grudged to make a crocodile of the man; but they &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">wished</hi> to&#x201D;&#x2014;hear him. Mrs Jeffrey I reckon rather a good woman; her daughter not. The Advocate himself eat his breakfastie, read descriptions of the Glasgow Procession,<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A grand procession was held in Glasgow on <date when="1831-09-08">8 Sept.</date> to celebrate the coronation of William IV, thought of as &#x201C;the reforming king&#x201D; (Cockburn). A crowd estimated at 100,000 first gathered on Glasgow Green: it was an orderly demonstration of the popular will. See <hi rend="italic">Scotsman</hi>, <date when="1831-09-10">10 Sept.</date>, and H. Cockburn, <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi>, I (Edinburgh, <date when="1874-00-00">1874</date>), 18&#x2013;22.</note> and clattered prettily about the Coronation, and the shining Peeresses, and how he was obliged to <hi rend="italic">walk</hi> home in the rain and dark, with his silk cloak and &#x201C;full-bottomed wig.&#x201D; We had an illumination<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The lighting up of a town with colored lights, artistically arranged, in token of festivity or celebration. Cf. Byron, <hi rend="italic">Don Juan</hi>, VII, 44.</note> on Thursday <pb id="pg-05-429" n="05:429"/>Night; which I did not once look at: a candle left from it is very useful here for sealing my Letters.&#x2014; Surely there is no magnetism in the Duke; but only an Electricity for collecting <hi rend="italic">Straws:</hi> his environment here is as stupid fully as it was in Edin<hi rend="italic">r: <foreign>trivialitas trivialitatum, omnia trivialitas</foreign></hi> [triviality of trivialities&#x2014;all is triviality]!<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Eccles. 1:2, Vulgate.</note>&#x2014;</p>
<p>Rejoicing in my Goody and her Love and tidings of departure, I set out with a frank in my pocket to make another clutch at Murray. The Dog was standing on the floor when I entered, and could not escape me! He is the slipperiest, lamest, most confused unbusinesslike man I have seen. Nevertheless poor <hi rend="italic">Dreck</hi> was in few minutes settled, or put on the way of settlement: I got a line to his printer (miles off! it is Clowes,<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Clowes (<date when="1779-00-00">1779</date>&#x2013;<date when="1847-00-00">1847</date>), printer, the first to make use of steam machinery for bookwork printing. William Clowes, his son, had entered business with him in <date when="1823-00-00">1823</date>.</note> who used to do the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Review</hi>); found him; expounded to him; and finally about two in the afternoon saw <hi rend="italic">Dreck</hi> on the way to the Printing Office, and can hope to get the first page of him tomorrow! Perhaps a week may elapse (perhaps less, so <hi rend="italic">exceedingly</hi> irregular is Murray) before we be fairly under steady way: after which a month or so will roll it all off my hands, and Dreck will lie in sheets till his hour come. Murray speaks of the &#x201C;beginning of the year&#x201D; for Publication: <hi rend="italic">he</hi> is the best judge of that, and will lose no time when the accounts are running on against him. For the present, as he altogether piteously waileth, not a Book, not a volume of any sort can he sell; it is all dead, and done, and gone to the Devil,&#x2014;as it ought to be. I am even glad that I have got the poor Book sent to press on <hi rend="italic">these</hi> terms: Irving, and many others, have <hi rend="italic">lost</hi> considerable monies by their Books! So stands it with the Sect named &#x201C;Literary Men&#x201D; in this best of all possible eras. Happy that we have still a kail garden [kitchen garden], fertile in potherbs, and a Whinstone Castle that resists the weather, let Bookselling go as it will! Depend on it, Jeannie that is no small blessing even now: one#x2019;s heart might almost fail him, if he stood otherwise as we do. Poor Puttoch! Castle of many chagrins, peatbog Castle, where the Devil never slumbers nor sleeps! very touching art thou to me when I look on thy image here, and fancy my Goody within thee. The Frankfort picture of Craigenputtoch, and Teufelsdreck written there, under the eye of the Flower of Haddington! Be kind to the poor House, and charge Betty to take care of it. I shall always look upon it with a mixture of love, horror, and amazement; a quite supernatural abode, more like Hades than the Earth. Yet God be thanked: &#x201C;My whinstone house my Castle is; I have my <pb id="pg-05-430" n="05:430"/>own Four Walls.&#x201D;<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >From Carlyle#x2019;s poem &#x201C;My Own Four Walls.&#x201D; See A. Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">LL</hi>, II, 355.</note> Perhaps few living Authors have their position so curiously fortified and adjusted.</p>
<p>Properly speaking the History has now reached down to the present hour, and <hi rend="italic">must</hi> terminate here. I have to go out and seek tobacco (do not forget Mundell#x2019;s, and the <hi rend="italic">sixteen!</hi>); against my return the porridge will be ready; then I read Goody#x2019;s Letter again, and retire to sleep. The Bugs seem gone. The Bed still stands discurtained, till we see.&#x2014; The mumble of Jack and Arbuckle is heard from below: they are practicing the speaking of French<supplied>[.]</supplied> Jack is diligent in the learning of tongues; and does it much by the <hi rend="italic">pen</hi>, frequently to my amusement, for the litter accumulates upon him, and the student, as of old, is the centre of a chaos.&#x2014; No word of Fraser<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Fraser.</note> yet: &#x201C;unfortunate&#x201D; as usual. Of the Bullers, of the Austins nothing. All the world &#x201C;is out of town.&#x201D;&#x2014; Bring the flesh-brush (it is in the drawer of our dressing closet); and the poor <foreign><hi rend="italic">tin Mull</hi></foreign> [snuff-box] of toothpowder. I love that tin Mull more than I could a golden one; I assure thee, <hi rend="italic">far</hi> more: it was bought for three half pence, in the West Bow, by Goody! Poor Goody, dear Goody! Ottilie#x2019;s <foreign><hi rend="italic">Semainaire</hi></foreign><note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >An embroidered wall ornament representing the days of the week sent by Goethe#x2019;s daughter-in-law Ottilie. See Norton, <hi rend="italic">GC</hi>, pp. 149, 154. The West Bow was a small steep street near St. Giles High Kirk, Edinburgh.</note> might be of some <hi rend="italic">use</hi> here, were you not afraid of spoiling it&#x2014;which perhaps you ought to be. The Hatbrush you will remember. I think of nothing more.&#x2014; Neither will I add any more. I daresay you are reading my Letter about this very time: at Craigenputtoch or Templand? I cannot ascertain; but know that you are glad of it somewhere, and <hi rend="italic">thinking of me</hi>. Think always of me, and remember that properly you are <hi rend="italic">part of me</hi>, are <hi rend="italic">I</hi>. God bless thee, Darling! Good night; and dream that I am kind to thee, happy or not.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Thursday Morning.</hi> Dearest, on consideration I find nothing better that I can do than finish out my Letter, and so give you what you deserve the top of the morning. I had thoughts of pilgriming down to the Strand first, in search of Hope#x2019;s Book: but it lies at such a distance and will cut me up for the day; besides it lies partly on the road to Dreck#x2019;s Printer, with whom I shall require one or more personal discussions before we get fairly afloat, and <hi rend="italic">Dreck</hi>, whatever it may do, is not come yet. Perhaps, indeed, the Longmans, tho#x2019; that is not very likely may send up the Volumes, or at least, as I requested, instruct me where they are best to be come at. On the whole, I say always, take <pb id="pg-05-431" n="05:431"/>thy way O World, and I will take mine; do whatsoever seemeth good unto thee, and I also will do the like. At present it is my sovereign will to write to Goody; in the course of a little while it is farther my purpose to commence periodical writing (that I may live thereby), which commencement no Longman or Shortman or any other man or body of men shall finally succeed in obstructing. So let them look to it; for the Edict is published <foreign><hi rend="italic">De par le roi</hi></foreign> [In the king#x2019;s name]!</p>
<p>I mention first, to avoid unpleasant dubieties, that Jack has got his Bill; much to his joy, I should think, tho#x2019; he grumbles that it would have been better had Alick got simply a Bank of England Note for the whole sum. Look not the gift-horse in the mouth! You will see the poor Doctor, if you come as you propose; and find him altered a little, in some respects distinctly for the better. On the whole, however, I must rejoice exceedingly that he has got this situation: what else he could have done was nowise clear to me. The man does not look like succeeding in any small plain way, and for a great rough way he has no accoutrements, except indeed a sufficient furnishing of ambition. I still call him partially a <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;waster,&#x201D;</hi> but hope he will not <hi rend="italic">bankrape</hi>. I have read him several hard lectures; all which he takes with some wry mouths, yet feels (I think) to be medicinal. Poor Doctor! He loves me well too, as well as man ever did. I think it is fairly possible that he may become even a <hi rend="italic">great</hi> Doctor here: several people have a decided regard for him; none any enmity except the femal<supplied>[e]</supplied> Montagues, and these quite unjustly. Let us as usual hope the best.&#x2014;</p>
<p>I had some particles of business to touch upon (as for example the bringing of my worthy <hi rend="italic">shaving-jug</hi>); and innumerable trivialities to utter trustfully to my kind Goody#x2019;s heart: but here enters the Doctor F&#xfc;ssli<note n="15" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310829-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1831-08-29">29 Aug.</date></ref></note> (Painter Fuseli#x2019;s nephew, whom I suppose you heard of before); he brings a ticket to go and see the <hi rend="italic">Mint</hi>, at 11&#xBD; o#x2019;clock, and will take no excuse but a business one: so why should I not go? The Printer has failed of his hour; let him now wait for <hi rend="italic">me</hi>. And cannot Goody go with us? <foreign><hi rend="italic">Ach nein</hi></foreign> [Oh no]! Not till she <hi rend="italic">come;</hi> which however will be soon. <foreign>Adieu</foreign>, then, Darling! I shall be back before Post time, and add a word.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Four o#x2019;clock</hi>. After three hours and a half of toilsome journeying, we return, <hi rend="italic">having seen</hi> the Mint. The Keeper was a friend of Badams#x2019;s, knew us when named: and was very civil. It is a strange thing, more especially the stamping part of it. You too shall see it all if you like. F&#xfc;ssli who is the most copious of talkers, sat with us till we had dinner, <pb id="pg-05-432" n="05:432"/>in which under the name of lunch, he participated, praising our Scotch Broth were it only a little <foreign><hi rend="italic">Kr&#xE4;ftiger</hi></foreign> [stronger]! He is now gone, with innumerable compliments; and I hasten back to my paper.&#x2014; No Teufelsdreck, no Hope or tidings of such has arrived. No matter; really it is no matter at all; there will be time enough.</p>
<p>What chiefly puzzles me at present is how or whether at all I am to write to you for next Wednesday. I have rather decidedly advised you to take the <hi rend="italic">Annan</hi> Steamboat; and you talk as if you would be gone on &#x201C;Thursday Week&#x201D;: so that apparently you will be at Ecclefechan on the Wednesday. Shall I write to <hi rend="italic">Ecclefechan</hi> then that day, and you get it as you pass the Post-Office (or send down for it) any time after eleven? As yet I see not what else I can do. On Tuesday there is no post to Dumfries or any whither. However, I will carefully scan your next Letter, and if I there find any new light follow it. Nay in any case, it will be of minor moment; for I think now everything has been pretty well settled between us; and all that I could write were greetings and talkings. Nevertheless even these are worth writing. So partly expect such at Ecclefechan; or failing this at Liverpool; whence instantly write to me, whether there be Letter <hi rend="italic">for</hi> you, or none. But perhaps your next Letter will decide me.</p>
<p>Heaven grant the poor Goody take no feverish fits or other ailments till she get beside me! You have really been leading a most unreasonable life, out of one ailment into another; enough to make any one sick. Do sleep, if it be possible. Why such hurry? There is plenty of time coming, long nights of winter, and what Time brings us in them.&#x2014; I mean to have a bottle of Brandy when you come, or of Rum at least; that is a fixed point. And you shall <hi rend="italic">occasionally</hi> have your three smokes, and no &#x201C;work made about them.&#x201D;</p>
<p>My poor <hi rend="italic">wart</hi> still sticks where it was; and will do till Goody arrive. Jack is not the man to throw light on the cutting of it: he moves clearly for letting it stick, lest we make it worse; of which mind I am <hi rend="italic">not</hi>. For the rest, he says he can clip it off in five minutes; and I shall have to live on fluid for three or four days. Like everything else, the wart waits for Goodykin#x2019;s coming.</p>
<p>Edward Irving is not returned yet: He is graver than usual; yet has still the old faculty of laughter. On the whole a true sufficient kind of man; very anxious to have me stay here; where &#x201C;in two years or so,&#x201D; I should not fail to find some appointment. What I lament is that such a mind should not be in the <hi rend="italic">van</hi>, but wilfully standing in the rear bringing up the tagrag and bobtail, however well he do it. &#x201C;Miracles&#x201D; are the commonest things in the world here: Irving said to Glen: &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">When</hi> I work Miracles.&#x201D; He and I have never fastened upon that <pb id="pg-05-433" n="05:433"/>topic yet; but by and by he shall hear my whole mind on it, for he deserves such confidence.</p>
<p>I gave your compliments to Empson, who received them with wreathed smiles and mumbles of heartiest welcome. I think you will like him: a bushy faced, kind looking creature, with most melancholy short-sighted eyes. He is from Lincolnshire; walks much, I take it, with women, men being too harsh and contradictory for him. He was sitting in yellow nightgown, that night, without neckcloth, shaggy enough; and writing with his whole might for Naso.&#x2014; Of Macaulay I hear nothing very good: a sophistical, rhetorical, ambitious young man of talent; &#x201C;set in there,&#x201D; as Mill said, &#x201C;to make flash speeches; and he makes them.&#x201D; It seems to me of small consequence whether we meet at all.</p>
<p>But I have a little Note <supplied>[to]</supplied> write for Jane, and not another moment to spare, were my paper far larger. Good bye, my Dearest! Heaven send thee safe to me and soon. Take every care of thyself, Wifekin: there is more than thy own that thou carriest with thee.<note n="16" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alexander Carlyle suggests that this remark confirms his understanding that, at this time, Jane believed that she was with child. He refers to this in <hi rend="italic">LL</hi>, II, 319 (<date when="1909-00-00">1909</date>) and in <hi rend="italic">The Nemesis of Froude</hi> (London, <date when="1903-00-00">1903</date>), pp. 63&#x2013;64, written jointly with Sir James Crichton-Browne. The phrase is slight in itself and unsupported by anything else in the Carlyles#x2019; letters. On the other hand, at least one letter from Jane (of about <date when="1831-09-07">7</date>&#x2013;<date when="1831-09-08">8 Sept.</date>, see <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310911-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1831-09-11">11 Sept.</date></ref>) is missing in the series. In <hi rend="italic">Nemesis</hi> and <hi rend="italic">LL</hi>, Alexander Carlyle says that Jean Carlyle (Carlyle#x2019;s sister and Alexander Carlyle#x2019;s mother-in-law) remembered helping Jane to pack baby clothes at this time; in <hi rend="italic">Nemesis</hi> he says that her daughter Mary (his late wife) was touched to find baby clothes in a drawer at Cheyne Row after Jane#x2019;s death; and he repeats that his sister-in-law, Ann and Margaret, both affirmed that Jane Carlyle had consulted their mother about her &#x201C;maternal hopes.&#x201D; Neither Jean Carlyle, nor others in the family, can have been <hi rend="italic">mistaken</hi>. It seems likely that Jane#x2019;s &#x201C;hopes&#x201D; may have been disappointed, rather than that (as Alexander implies) she had a miscarriage. But the family tradition is clear whatever interpretation is put on it. It has been made a focus for controversy. See W. H. Dunn, <hi rend="italic">Froude and Carlyle</hi> (London, <date when="1930-00-00">1930</date>), pp. 214&#x2013;6.</note> <closer><salute>A thousand kisses; and farewells, which will soon be welcomes!

<salute>My Dear Jane,</salute>
<p>I can do nothing more but send you my salutations in writing, instead of sending them by second hand, so hurried am I at this <pb id="pg-05-434" n="05:434"/>moment: so much however I will do, knowing that it will give you pleasure. Be sure always, my dear Sister, that I love you, and take a true brotherly concern in whatever you do or suffer: I have long marked in you many qualities that I trust will yet ripen into attainments of great comfort to us all.</p>
<p>I have no new advices to give you: the old one is still enough, to love Truth and walk in it; this includes all other things. If there were any special point I should again insist on, it would be to stand between our dear Mother and Evil, to shield <hi rend="italic">her</hi> from pain by whatever assiduity patience, self-sacrifice you can. O be kind to her: we shall never, never look upon her like again. Bear with her: even when she seems to you unreasonable, bear with her; protect her against herself.</p>
<p>But I will not touch on these matters here: I mean to bargain with you that I shall have a Letter from Scotsbrig at least once a month thro#x2019; winter; and it will be you, I think, who must chiefly write it. I will make Jane lay this charge on you, and bargain with you, and take <hi rend="italic">your word</hi>, which I know you will not break. In my next Letter to her there will be more of it.</p>
<p>Poor Mrs Edward Irving<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not to be confused with the wife of the preacher.

<p>I saw Wull Bogs<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A ne#x2019;er-do-well, formerly of Ecclefechan.

<salute>My Dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Jane, who I hope and believe has been a diligent correspondent to you of late, told me in her last Letter <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to write today, that she might not have the pain of expecting with the risk of expecting in vain. I had previously been of mind to have a Letter waiting for her at Ecclefechan; fancying, as I still partly do, that she must be at Scotsbrig when this arrives: however, I will now address the whole to <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, so that if she be <hi rend="italic">not</hi> there, we may still find ourselves in the right. The little Note, which I put in along with this for my good Wifie,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310919-TC-JWC-01">his letter of the same date to JWC</ref>.</note> is not of any special moment: if she have left you, it can lie safely till we <hi rend="italic">come back</hi> to seek it,&#x2014;which period, I trust, is not at any very great distance. Let us hope also that we shall come back with no evil tidings, and not to hear any!</p>
<p>These are strange wanderings and shiftings we have in this world; where indeed, as was long ago written, there is &#x201C;no continuing City&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Heb. 13:14.</note> to be looked for. At this very hour, as I calculate, my Jane and my &#x201C;little Jane&#x201D; will be journeying (I hope under some sort of escort) towards Scotsbrig, to be there against tea-time; Jack is down below making ready for a Journey to Italy (getting his Italian lesson even <pb id="pg-05-436" n="05:436"/>now); Alick is somewhere between Craigenputtoch and Scotsbrig, or at one or the other; the rest are perhaps thatching ricks, or perhaps there are several still to build, this fine day: and here am I, sitting towards the summit of this monstrous brick wilderness (for this is among the highest points of it) uttering a sort of &#x201C;gathering cry&#x201D; to remind us all of one another! Happily the great Father is near us all, unless we wilfully withdraw from him.</p>
<p>Jane will have told you how languidly everything proceeds here with me; how the &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">people</hi> are all out of town;&#x201D; everything stagnating because of this Reform Bill; the book-trade in particular nearly altogether at a stand-still; and lastly how I, as the best thing I could do, have been obliged to <hi rend="italic">give</hi> my poor Book <hi rend="italic">away</hi> (that is the first Edition of it; whether there will ever be a second is to try for), and am even glad to see it printed on these terms. This is not very flattering news of the encouragement for men of my craft: nevertheless I study to say with as much cheerfulness as I can, <hi rend="italic">Be it so!</hi> The Giver of all Good has enabled me to write the thing: and also to do <hi rend="italic">without</hi> any pay for it: the pay would have wasted away, and &#x201C;flitted out of the bit&#x201D; [disappeared], as other pay does; but if there stand any Truth recorded there, <hi rend="italic">it</hi> will not &#x201C;flit&#x201D; [go away]. Nay, if there be even no Truth (as where is the man that can say with confidence, The inspiration of the Almighty has given <hi rend="italic">me</hi> understanding), yet it was the nearest approach to such that I could make, and so, in God#x2019;s name, let it take its fortune in the world, and sink or swim, as the All-disposer orders. True remains forever the maxim: In all thy ways acknowledge <hi rend="italic">Him</hi>.</p>
<p>I am earnestly expecting Jane; that some sort of establishment may be formed here, where we can spend the winter with more regularity and composure than I have hitherto enjoyed. This Lodging does not look to me as if it would do; but I form no positive scheme till she come and look at it. Some comfortable enough place can be had for about the same money: there we can look about us over this Whirlpool; superintend the printing of our &#x201C;bit [small] Book&#x201D;; and I, in the mean time, shall most probably write some considerable essay for the Edinburgh Review; that so, when we return, <hi rend="italic">Mall</hi> may not be altogether out of <hi rend="italic">shaft</hi>,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Things may be kept going. See <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310201-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1831-02-01">1 Feb.</date></ref></note> but capable of being wedged in again, and lustily beaten with. Of any permanent appointment here I as yet see (with my own eyes) not the slightest outlook: neither indeed is my heart set on such; for I feel that the King#x2019;s Palace with all it holds would in good truth do little for me; and the Prayer I ever endeavour <pb id="pg-05-437" n="05:437"/>to make is: Shew me my Duty, and enable me to do it. If my Duty be to endure a life of Poverty, and what &#x201C;light afflictions&#x201D; attend on it, this also will not terrify me. However I have some friends here, and reckon that there must be various capabilities in such a scene: all these I will endeavour to see better before I leave it.</p>
<p>Meanwhile I am not without my comforts: one of the greatest of which is to have found various well-disposed men, most of them young men, who even feel a sort of scholarship towards me. My poor performances in the writing way are better known here than I expected: clearly enough also there <hi rend="italic">is</hi> want of instruction and light in this mirk midnight of human affairs, such want as probably for eighteen hundred years there has not been: if <hi rend="italic">I</hi> have any light to give, then let me give it; if none then what is to be done but seek for it, and hold my peace till I find it?</p>
<p>For the rest be not afraid, Dear Mother, that I am not well &#x201C;taken care of.&#x201D; I have the inestimable possession (for inestimable it truly is) to have a Wife that faithfully loves me, and faithfully loves what is Right so far as she can see it: assure yourself she will take good care of me; such care as was never taken by any but you. She is also a <foreign>gleg</foreign> [sharp], little, managing, orderly creature, beyond almost any other: doubt not she will sweep and garnish our little cell, and we shall sit as warm there as any pair can expect or require. The great duty for you therefore is to <hi rend="italic">forward her on her way:</hi> if she is with you when this comes, help her swiftly and smoothly forward by the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> steamboat, and let her hasten to me with your blessing. Perhaps about this day week I shall have her here!</p>
<p>So soon as we get into lodgings and see ourselves in any measure settled I will write to you again; and <hi rend="italic">regularly</hi> thro the winter; once in the month at seldomest, oftener if there be any occurrence of moment. What I want much to impress upon you, at the same time, is the great necessity of your also writing to me. I sent a little Note to Jane, stipulating that <hi rend="italic">she</hi> was to fill me a sheet monthly, with such help as she could get, or with her own hand if she could get none: I beg of you to insist upon this, if it be practicable; however, <hi rend="italic">my</hi> writing shall not depend on hers; for I know how she is situated, and how short the deed must fall of the will. Once a month nevertheless I think she may manage; and I know that if she undertake she will perform. From Alick I expect to learn all that passes at Craigenputtoch: if Jamie were not a man among ten thousand, he also would take up the pen for me; tell him that he must and shall, it is a true shame for him otherwise.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-05-438" n="05:438"/>There is little room here to tell you about any one save myself; Jack is now, his Italian master being gone, writing to my Father, as I understand, an account of all his goings, which I hope will prove satisfactory. I can still say that I think him much improved; grown indeed, in several respects, into a <hi rend="italic">man</hi>; and that I look forward to much good for him. He seems to me to have in him the elements of a valuable Physician, which next to a Teacher or Priest who is a Physician of the soul, I reckon the highest character in this world: what you will prize still higher, he seems to have some Reverence of the Highest in him, and has been looking into his eternal interests with much more seriousness than I had seen him do before. Let us hope good of poor Doil, and that all these aberrations and endurances, of which he has had his share, may turn to his great profit. His Countess still pleases him well, he has a pleasant prospect before him for the present, and some distinct outlook into the future.</p>
<p>My Leddy and I are talking of some trip into Cornwall, to see the Bullers for a week or two, till the Town get busy again: but this is very problematic, and will depend some little on the Letter I get from them; which, having written again, I now expect this week. At all events we shall go out to Badam#x2019;s for a few days; it is only twelve miles off, and they are honestly desirous to see us. Edward Irving I meet with very often. He is kinder, stiller than usual; a very good man, and not at all what I can name an unwise one, tho#x2019; surely but ill-informed, with such a crowd of crackbrained zealots and &#x201C;silly women&#x201D; about him, shrieking out at his prayer-meetings, and <foreign><hi rend="italic">clavering</hi></foreign> [talking foolishly] downright jargon, which they name Gift of the Holy Ghost, and Speaking with Tongues!</p>
<p>I must now, my dear Mother, bid you again good day. Fear not that I shall forget to write: it is among my best duties, and best pleasures. Remember me in kindest love to all of them from my Father down to Jenny. <closer><salute>God bless you all, and be ever near you!&#x2014; Your affectionate Son,</salute></closer></p>
<name>T. Carlyle</name>
<ps><p>I send the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> direct to Scotsbrig today; supposing Alick to be still with you. The Editor of it is unwell, but I am to see him when he recovers.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Fonblanque.</note>&#x2014; My Book is fairly <hi rend="italic">at Press</hi>.</p>
<p>A Letter has come from Mr Grahame of Burnswark since I began writing; of which Jack and I (for he has read it to me) are very glad. I suppose it will soon get an answer&#x2014;</p>
<p><pb id="pg-05-439" n="05:439"/>We are talking of going to see a Reform Meeting of the Citizens today:<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On <date when="1831-09-19">19 Sept.</date> the Livery of London met in the Guildhall to hear speeches in support of reform by the Lord Mayor and others. The meeting was a large and enthusiastic one. See the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, <date when="1831-09-20">20 Sept.</date></note> but whether we shall get off or not in time seems uncertain. It is <supplied>[the]</supplied> <hi rend="italic">richer</hi> class of the Merchants I believe, who are weary of this slow progress of the Bill. I myself am utterly sick of it: but want to see how these Principalities will conduct themselves&#x2014;</p>
<p>Be sure to send us word about the Harvest; which my Jeannie has never had opportunity to inform me of. The weather has been very bad here for harvest work (which however is all over in these parts); and I have many times been thinking of your <hi rend="italic">rigs</hi> [fields], not without anxiety.</p></ps>

<salute>My Dearest Wife and Jeannie,</salute>
<p>Labouring under the painful uncertainty whether this may find you or have to wait for you till we <hi rend="italic">both</hi> come and seek it,&#x2014;I must write without heart, and with all brevity. There is in truth nothing or next to nothing to be communicated: only for the sake of of [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] lovingly saluting you and your way do I risk this line.</p>
<p>I had your Tuesday#x2019;s Letter, from amid the rain torrents; since which I have learned by the Papers that you did not go on; for the Thunder became awfully grand especially in the Puttoch region, nay Mrs Broatch locked her door (on the Electric Fluid) and took out the key!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Dumfries and Galloway <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi> of <date when="1831-09-13">13 Sept.</date> reported the storm of <date when="1831-09-06">6 Sept.</date>, which was so impressive that at Dunscore the inn was locked up and the key hidden for fear it would attract lightning. The landlord was William Broatch. The <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> for Sunday, <date when="1831-09-18">18 Sept.</date>, extracted the article from the <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi>, including the account of the hidden key.</note> All this has already transpired in the public Prints.&#x2014; Or was it all the Tuesday before?</p>
<p>I will have a Letter for you at your Uncle#x2019;s in Liverpool, on Saturday at latest. You will write (independently of it) what day and hour you are coming; and a certain man, among this million and half, will be on the outlook for you. Come, dearest Goodykin, come to my heart: I have been far too long parted from thee, and am all going to sixes and sevens without thee.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-05-440" n="05:440"/>The best news I can tell you today is that <hi rend="italic">Dreck</hi> is fairly getting into types. As you will see by that snip of a &#x201C;specimen page,&#x201D; which I inclose here, to gratify your pretty eyes. I know not what will become of the Book: indeed I have almost lost sight of it; let the Devil do his worst with it; I did my best.</p>
<p>I consigned the female Jeffreys yesterday to John; went over and saw the male one for about the third part of a minute. He was very kind-looking, poor little fellow, but seemed hampered and hurried. A pretty soul is there <foreign><hi rend="italic">umgestrickt</hi></foreign>;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ensnared. Carlyle has written <hi rend="italic">ge</hi> over the space after <hi rend="italic">um</hi>.</note> and the yarns will choke the life out it: yet who, alas, can cut them asunder? Himself only had he the heart, and he has not.</p>
<p>The Longmans have sent me up Godwin#x2019;s Book, and sent off for Hope#x2019;s:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310904-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1831-09-04">4 Sept.</date></ref> and <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310911-TC-JWC-01"><date when="1831-09-11">11 Sept.</date></ref></note> it is not to be had here let me take what steps I like, hitherto. Perhaps the damage is not great. It is not as a Critic of what others speak but as a Speaker for myself that I must appear. Something is gathering within me: I will set it forth when it is <hi rend="italic">ready</hi>, and we shall soon find a vehicle, Naso himself may find one. Meanwhile tho#x2019; several persons advise me to write Duds or Semi-duds, I will not.</p>
<p>On Saturday (being again at Murray#x2019;s, seeking <hi rend="italic">Hope#x2019;s</hi> Book, in vain) I called in on the Blacks<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The publishers who had backed William Fraser and his now defunct <hi rend="italic">Foreign Review</hi>.</note> as I returned. Truly no bad people; obliging rather, necessitous and foolish. Black himself is a figure that makes me laugh every time I look back on him. He sits in a back room under a fine glass dome (very dirty and overhung by brick walls); has a flowered nightgown, fashionable head, and two jewel buttons for his shirt-breast: clatters and jargons with a wonderful mixture of the Goodnatured, the Dandiacal the Frothy and the Stupid; with becks and wreathed smiles<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;L#x2019;Allegro,&#x201D; l. 28.</note> and an environment as disorderly as that of Teufelsdreck himself. The pudding Young<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Partner of the Blacks.</note> came in; looking lean, careworn, and apprehensive of the whole world: openly expressed their &#x201C;sorrow&#x201D; over Cochrane;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Editor of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Quarterly Review</hi>.</note> lent me two Books, and promised to try for Hope#x2019;s. Goethe#x2019;s <foreign><hi rend="italic">Lieferung</hi></foreign> [serial part] can be had, if you recollect the Volumes.&#x2014;&#x2014; Empson came rushing in yesternight, <foreign><hi rend="italic">blethered</hi></foreign> [talked foolishly] for an instant (about coming back) then rushed out again lest his horse ran off, and&#x2014;came not again.&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>
<p>O my Dearest would I h<supplied>[ad thee]</supplied> safe and sound out of these <pb id="pg-05-441" n="05:441"/>perils by land and by water! I will not think of them, since I cannot lighten them, and have nothing for it but Patience and Hope. God keep thee, my own, and bring thee soon to my heart.</p>

Pbd: Samuel Smiles, <hi rend="italic">Memoir of John Murray</hi> (London, <date when="1891-00-00">1891</date>), II, 353&#x2013;54. Murray#x2019;s letter of <date when="1831-09-17">17 Sept.</date> reads as follows:<lb/><lb/>
Dear Sir<lb/>
Your conversations with me, respecting the publication of your MS, led me to infer, that you had given me the <hi rend="italic">preference</hi> and, certainly not, that you had, already, submitted it to the greatest publishers in London&#x2014;who had declined to engage in it.<lb/><lb/>
Under these circumstances, it will be necessary for me also to get it read by some literary friend before I can in justice to myself engage in the printing of it.<lb/><lb/> 
I am Dear Sir / Your faithful Servant<lb/><lb/>
John Murray<lb/><lb/>
Carlyle#x2019;s revisions indicate the great care which he took in drafting his reply to Murray. The original draft without the revisions is given below:<lb/><lb/>
Sir, I am just favoured with your Note of the <date when="1831-09-17">17<hi rend="italic">th</hi></date> from Ramsgate, and beg to say in reply:<lb/><lb/>
First that the idea derived from my conversation of my giving you the preference, other things being equal, to all other Publishers was perfectly correct: I had heard you described as a man of honour and liberality, and knew you to be the most extensive [last five words cancelled] to have the most extensive and best connexions; and might have said and can still say that a Bargain with you would please me better than a similar one with any other member of the Trade.<lb/><lb/>
Secondly allow me to mention that your information (where derived is not worth while to conjecture) of my having offered my manuscript to the greatest Publishers in London if you mean thereby that after it first came out of your hands it lay two days in those of Messrs Longman and Rees, and was from them delivered over to the Lord Advocate,&#x2014;is also perfectly correct: if you mean anything else, incorrect.<lb/><lb/>
Thirdly that if you wish the Bargain, which I had understood myself to have made with you, unmade, you have only to direct your Printer to return my Manuscript to return the same forthwith safe and entire, and consider the business as finished.<lb/><lb/>
I remain / Sir / [no signature].</sourceNote><head>

<salute>My poor Goody,</salute>
<p>All yesterday my thoughts were with thee in thy lone voyage; which now, I pray the great Giver of Good, may have terminated prosperously. Never before did I so well understand my Mother#x2019;s anxious forecasting ways: I felt that my best Possession was trusted to the false sea, and all my cares for it could avail nothing. Do not wait a moment in writing; I shall have no peace till I know that you are safe. Meanwhile in truth there is no use in tormenting myself: the weather, here at least, was good; I struggle what I can to believe that it has all passed without accident, and that you are now resting in comparative safety in your Uncle#x2019;s house among friends.</p>
<p>Of rest I can well understand you have need enough. I grieve to think how harrassed [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] you have been of late; all which, I fear, has acted badly on your health; these bustlings and tossings to and fro are far too rough work for you. I can see by your two last Letters, especially, that it is not well with you: your heart is, as it were, choked <pb id="pg-05-443" n="05:443"/>up, if not depressed, you are agitated and provoked, which is almost the worse way of the two. Alas! And I have no soft Aladdin#x2019;s Palace here, to bid you hasten and take repose in: nothing but a noisy untoward Lodginghouse, and no better shelter there than my own bosom. Yet is not this the best of all shelters for you; the only safe place in this wild world? Thank God, this still is yours, and I can receive you there without distrust; and wrap you close, close, with the solacements of a true heart#x2019;s love. Hasten thither then my own Wife. Betide what may we will not despair; were the world never so unfriendly, <hi rend="italic">we</hi> are indivisible, and will help each other to endure its evils, nay to conquer them. I have still &#x201C;taken up with no other women,&#x201D; and can still say that I have seen none worth taking up with, furnished as I already am in that kind. It is not to make you vain, but to express my own gratitude and encourage you in well-doing that I repeat often, what is always my deliberate feeling, how much I owe you, how precious, how indispensable you have become to me.</p>
<p>How ma<supplied>[n]</supplied>y of my Letters you have got or missed I cannot well gather from what you write: the Letter containing four Scotch Notes, I think, you must have received before the date of your last, tho#x2019; contrary to wont you do not expressly say so: another would lie waiting you at Dumfries on Monday, unless the Carrier had taken it awry, or perhaps brought it the night before; it was full of package-orders, which would then be too late, my calculation having been that you would not leave home till the day before you sailed. A third Note (of small dimensions and no consequence) would arrive for you, under cover to my Mother, last Wednesday; whether too late or not I cannot know. Neither indeed is it clear to me whether you were to sail from Annan or Dumfries, tho#x2019; I think surely the former: however, in either case, I will hope and pray that your sailing may be happily over, which is the only thing of moment. Another four and twenty hours of land-journeying, and she is here!</p>
<p>In fact these <hi rend="italic">overlappings</hi> of the Posts, and indeed the whole matter of Letterwriting is but a poor succedaneum: let us trust, as you say, that we may not soon need to apply to it again! This present sheet, for example, I now incline to think had better have been sent off yesterday, had I not wished to be sure of its <hi rend="italic">finding</hi> you there, and giving you the latest news: it now, on better calculation, begins to be a painful uncertainty whether the Saturday Mail (not arriving till six o#x2019;clock) may be delivered that night. Probably, if not, you will have it asked for at the Office. I will hope the best.</p>
<p>To continue my Narrative in writing, with the hope of Speech so <pb id="pg-05-444" n="05:444"/>near, were but waste of effort. Come, and I will tell it to you with much more <hi rend="italic">to all lengths!</hi> Goody also will have much to tell.&#x2014; In the meantime, it is my (I know not whether painful or pleasant) duty to tell you that the Printing of <hi rend="italic">Teufelsdreck</hi> which I announced as commencing, and even (in my Scotsbrig Note) sent you a specimen of, has altogether stopt, and Murray#x2019;s Bargain with me has burst into the air. The man behaved like a Pig, and was speared perhaps not without art; Jack and I at least laughed that night <foreign><hi rend="italic">&#xE0; gorge deploy&#xE9;e</hi></foreign> [with splitting sides], at the Answer I wrote his base <foreign><hi rend="italic">glar</hi></foreign> of a Letter: he has written again in much politer style, and I shall answer him, as M#x2019;Leod<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> advised my Grandfather#x2019;s people, &#x201C;sharp but mannerly.&#x201D; The truth of the matter is, now clearly enough: Dreck cannot be disposed of in London at this time. Whether he lie in my trunk or in a Bookseller#x2019;s coffer seems partly indifferent, so that I shall give Murray perhaps another chance, if he be eager for it. Neither on the whole do I know whether it is not better that we have stopt for the present: money I was to have none; Author#x2019;s vanity embarked on that bottom I have almost none; nay some time or other that the Book can be <hi rend="italic">so</hi> disposed of is certain enough: thus, here again, we have our footing on the adamant, and smile upon poor Murray and all his tribe.</p>
<p>You will be amazed to learn that I have not succeeded in raising a copy of Hope#x2019;s Book in all London; till yesterday I could not so much as get sight of it, and then by special favour in the <hi rend="italic">Museum</hi>. It does seem possible that there may be an <hi rend="italic">Article</hi> in it; but we shall see.&#x2014; Failing in all literary schemes, for the time, and seeing poor Dreck at a standstill, I on Tuesday Night set out for Enfield to see Badams, and also to try whether I could not get a little quiet sleep there. I succeeded in both objects; have not had such a sleep for several weeks; found the Badamses so so in health, but evidently quite gratified to see me. The Lady, whose impetousity and volatility (your Mother is solid as iron in comparison) would have it that <hi rend="italic">we</hi> must come out to live there, and &#x201C;take a part of the house off their hands.&#x201D; <foreign><hi rend="italic">Himmel und Erde</hi></foreign> [Heaven and earth]! the house would take fire in three days. However it was settled that we were to come and see them; a duty which I think you will not find very fatiguing: Badams I continue to think a man of very great worth, mingled, alas, with alloy which is threatening to pull him <hi rend="italic">down</hi>. His Wife is honest as steel; but there her <hi rend="italic">unmixed</hi> merit ends.&#x2014; I came off yesterday, greatly against the wish of both; purely to see your Letter, which accordingly <pb id="pg-05-445" n="05:445"/>after a weary winding thro#x2019; these labyrinthic streets I found waiting me on the table, and Jack out; it was eight at night.&#x2014; I had called and got my Watch: she is regulated to perfection; cleaned; has her new chain, and has earned high praise by her conduct since mended. The damage to me was 12/.&#x2014;</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Dumfries Courier</hi> partly indicated to me that you had called at Macs<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John M#x2019;Diarmid was editor of the <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi>.</note> on Monday: it had come direct hither. This morning I saw in the Times that the Duke<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jeffrey: it was noted in a report of cases in the Appeals Court that he had a &#x201C;severe illness&#x201D; and &#x201C;looked very unwell.&#x201D; He voted on <date when="1831-09-22">22 Sept.</date> and spoke in Parliament the next day, but was to have an operation on an anal fistula.</note> was ill; went over the faster for my frank; and found the poor little fellow really far from well (it is his old complaint, concerning which <hi rend="italic">mum</hi>); yet better than he had been, and preparing to speak this night as introducer of the Scotch Reform Bill! he had three minutes talk about Murray (the Bookseller), and then withdrew. His ladies were driving out just as I came to the door. I conjecture it to be a villa<supplied>[i]</supplied>nous life, that of theirs yonder.</p>
<p>I do not know of any more news, or any reason why I should detain my poor weary Goody any longer. Inclosed lie some more &#x201C;goot worts&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310911-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1831-09-11">11 Sept.</date></ref></note> from the noble lady:<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mrs. Montagu wrote to Carlyle in a letter dated <date when="1831-09-23">23 Sept.</date>: &#x201C;What news of our dear Traveller<supplied>[?]</supplied>&#x2014; Emily was taken ill again at Richmond and I brought her home last night&#x2014; In the midst of my home perplexities my thoughts are &#x2018;ever on my Jean#x2019;&#x2014;let me have notice of her <hi rend="italic">arrival</hi>, or if her stay is protracted at Liverpool let me know how to address her there&#x2014;&#x201D;</note> they lay waiting here, when I returned home; and can easily be despatched onwards. What avail they? Thyself one day wilt judge.</p>
<p>The other inclosure is for the G. Johnstone<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Johnston#x2019;s brother who lived near Liverpool. Carlyle#x2019;s letter to him has not been found.</note> of whom you have so often heard me speak.

Grahame of Burnswark (in a letter to John) thanks me the other day for introducing him to one of the &#x201C;kindest hearted men he ever met with,&#x201D; or some such perhaps higher excellence; meaning thereby your worthy Uncle.

<ps><p><pb id="pg-05-446" n="05:446"/>I have Johnstone#x2019;s Letter still to write (on business), and the clock strikes half-past four.

Had I been informed, that during the interval in which I had returned the MS to you, it had been offered to Mess<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Longman, &#x26; sent back, after remaining with them two days, I certainly should have requested permission to have had it left with me for perusal, before I determined upon it#x2019;s [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] publication, and I only wish to be placed in the same position, as I should have been, had I been previously informed of that fact&#x2014;<lb/><lb/>

For me such things have of old done little; and I heartily rejoiced when it was over. Pleasant I have found it, and wholesome to see so many people kindly disposed to me, and thinking well of me; useful also to observe how the busy world is moving, and on what side one is to attack it and address it from his hill-top; but for the rest I find little benefit in Edinburgh talk. At best it is but a shallow matter. Even Jeffrey#x2019;s, however well-meant, is but an attempt to take from me my highest principles and advise me to exchange them for a piece of perishing money.
