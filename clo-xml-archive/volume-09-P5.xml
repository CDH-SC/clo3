<salute>My dear friend,</salute>
<p>It was not till Saturday Evening that I learned at secondhand thro&#x2019; the Newspapers what stroke had fallen on you.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, <date when="1836-06-25">25 June</date>, recorded James Mill&#x2019;s death &#x201C;at his house in Kensington, after a lingering illness.&#x201D;</note> In the last days, and that very morning, I had been writing trivialities to you; and your House was already the house of sorrow, and Time with its greatest was merged in Eternity!&#x2014; I had understood that there was danger; but not at all that it was imminent; not even that you were clearly persuaded of it.</p>
<p>Your Father is gone,&#x2014;to the ancient Fathers we had; to God who made us all! In such seasons I know well there are thoughts we cannot speak of, cannot bear to be spoken to about; most mournful but also very solemn, not without a blessedness in them. One thing only I will say, in the words my wife used: &#x201C;James Mill is gone; but he has left a brave Man&#x2019;s Life behind him.&#x201D; This it seems to me includes <hi rend="italic">all;</hi> the rest may remain unspoken: in silence, amid these sacred hopes and sacred tears, and mysteries and monitions, and lookings forward and lookings back, the pious heart will anew adjust itself when Nature has had her due. I pray God, in old devout language, that this sorrow may be <hi rend="italic">blessed</hi> to you: I bid you, in the same spirit, Live worthy of such a Father. Let that be his elegy and monument. We linger but a little way behind him.</p>
<p>These two last evenings, tho&#x2019; I knew not whether even my face could be other than burdensome to you, I was just on the road for Kensington, when unexpected interruptions occurred; twice over; last night, just before your packet came.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly Mill had sent Carlyle a note, now lost, along with his copy of Nicolle du Hausset, <hi rend="italic">M&#xE9;moires de Madame du Hausset, femme de chambre de Madame de Pompadour</hi> (Paris, <date when="1824-00-00">1824</date>), vol. 2 of Berville and Barri&#xE8;re&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Collection des m&#xE9;moires r&#xE9;latif &#xE0; la R&#xE9;volution Fran&#x26;ccedil;aise</hi>. For Carlyle&#x2019;s comments on the book, see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18360722-TC-JSM-01">TC to JSM, [<date when="1836-07-22">22 July</date>]</ref>.</note> This evening or Tomorrow Evening I purpose again; with more confidence now that you permit and invite me.</p>
<p>My wife is very poorly, and talks of going to Scotland for a month <pb id="pg-09-4" n="09:4"/>or two, to her Mother; which I recommend. The hot weather keeps me in durance all days till after sunset.</p>

<salute>My Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Will you excuse this smallest scrap of thinnest paper; for really the Frank will hold no more. I must assure you of our continued welfare, of our continued interest in yours; two things, I think, which on no scrap of paper could be indifferent to you. John also writes the other day, making all manner of inquiries about you. When we hear <foreign><hi rend="italic">Di tanti palpiti</hi></foreign>,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340225-TC-JAC-01"><sic>7:106</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1834-02-25">25 Feb. 1834</date></corr></ref>.</note> which now that the Piano has got into tune again is almost nightly, your sullen wilderness, your wild sojourn in it, come vividly before us. Take comfort! By God&#x2019;s blessing, it is only for a time.</p>
<p>Know that you are not forsaken of all the Earth, then: nay, if all the Earth had forsaken you, is not Heaven&#x2019;<supplied>[s]</supplied> ear open to all the unhappy? Cry to Heaven (I entreat you do); for there only is there mercy that will avail.</p>
<p>O my friend, we shall meet again, when these infernal clouds shall have rolled away; and the over-haughty heart, tamed by fiery suffering into meekness and patient humbleness, is what it was meant to [corner of letter torn away] &#x2026; and working one.</p>
<p>Give our regards to Peter&#x2019;s<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Peter Austin and his family.</note> peo<supplied>[ple;]</supplied> tell them we sympathize deeply in that late sore bereavement. May it be tempered to them, may it be blessed!</p>
<p>When you write to your Brother<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Archibald Glen in Glasgow.</note> send him our Address.</p>
<p>London is still as dusty and hot and tumultuous as of old. I study to gather myself together in the midst of it, and see what faculty I <pb id="pg-09-5" n="09:5"/>have for <hi rend="italic">doing</hi> something. &#x201C;Some useful plan or Book to make, or sing a sang at least.&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf.

<p><salute>Dear Jenny,&#x2014;</salute>I write you a few words in the greatest haste, with a worthy Mr. Gibson<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Gibson. See <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350817-TC-JCA-01">TC to JCA, <date when="1835-08-17">17 Aug. 1835</date></ref>.</note> even talking to me all the while; but I <hi rend="italic">must</hi> write, for there is not a post to lose, and I think the news will not be unwelcome to you.</p>
<p>Jane is getting ill again in this fiercely hot weather, and I have persuaded her to go home for a month to her mother. She is going by Manchester, and you. Off some time tomorrow (Saturday), and will be in your town, we calculate, on Sunday, and hopes to sleep in your house that night. <hi rend="italic">This</hi> is the news. Now we know not as yet by what coach she will come, or at what hour and what Inn she will arrive, but this Mr. Gibson, who has undertaken to go out and search over the city for the suitablest vehicle, and to engage a seat in that for her, will take this letter in his pocket. He, having engaged the seat, will mark the name of it on the outside (where see). I judge farther that this letter will reach you on Saturday evening or next morning soon, so that there will be time. The rest you will know how to do without telling. I think Robert, if he be not altered from what he was, will succeed in meeting the tired wayfarer as she steps out, which will be a great comfort to her. She calculates on being at full liberty to sit silent with you, or to sit talking, to lie down on the bed, to do whatsoever she likes best to do, and to be in all senses at home as in her own home. There are few houses in England that could do as much for her. I think she would like best to be&#x2014; &#x201C;well let alone.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Next day, or when once right rested, Robert will conduct her to the Liverpool Railway, and give her his &#x201C;Luck by the road&#x201D;; after which she has but a little whirl, a little sail,&#x2014;by the force of steam both ways,&#x2014;and is at Templand or Annan. She will tell you all our news and <pb id="pg-09-6" n="09:6"/>get all yours, so I need not add another word. Did you get a frank that I sent you some months ago? Did you ever send even a newspaper since? Jane has half a thought that she may find the Doctor and our mother with you. All good wishes to your Goodman.</p>

<salute>My Dear Mill,</salute>
<p>Jane went off for Scotland on Saturday evening; there came a token from her today that she had got safe to Manchester, where Friends would be ready to receive her: tomorrow I hope to learn that she is in Liverpool with her uncle; and in a few days more, at home. I proposed your kind scheme<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For Jane to accompany the Mill family to their cottage at Mickleham, near Dorking, Surrey. Mill also suggested a weekend visit to Carlyle (see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18360714-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1836-07-14">14 July</date></ref>).</note> to her, which she listened to with thankfulness; but her heart was, by that time, set on Scotland, as I anticipated: indeed she had got so weakened and dispirited that I too had to admit her Mother&#x2019;s house was the best for her. Your Sister Clara<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Clara Esther Mill (<date when="1810-00-00">1810</date>&#x2013;<date when="1886-00-00">86</date>).</note> repeats the invitation in friendly manner tonight; for which pray thank her in my name: it is a trouble which, had I done my duty to you, I should have spared her.</p>
<p>I like well the prospect of going with you on Saturday: and yet I hope nothing does or will depend on it; for my state is very unsure. I work all day, and awake occasionally at 5 or even at 3 in the morning; I am so dreary of mood (like a ghost rather than a man), and alive nowhere except over the paper, that it often seems quite foolish in me to think of going anywhither&#x2014;if not into total abstraction from mankind, into some Diogenes&#x2019; Herring-barrel, with not even the sun to shine on me. &#x201C;A place where you can be as stupid and as ugly as you please&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly a phrase of Mill&#x2019;s referring to the privacy of the cottage.</note> is in these circumstances an indispensable blessing. <foreign><hi rend="italic">C&#x2019;est le grand bonheur de la vie</hi></foreign> [&#x201C;It is the great happiness of life&#x201D;], said one of the Foreigners one day.&#x2014; I shall hear of you before Saturday, and answer more precisely.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-09-7" n="09:7"/>With this comes a handful of Scotch oatmeal.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jane had forgotten to send it (see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18360716-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1836-07-16">16 July</date>]</ref>).</note> The grand rule for making porridge is brief: The highest possible temperature; the meal introduced as nearly all at once as possible. That there be such rapidity of <hi rend="italic">stirring</hi>, and such a beautiful effusion of the meal from the end of the hand as to preclude <hi rend="italic">lumps</hi> and <hi rend="italic">knots</hi>,&#x2014;this lies in the nature of the case.</p>
<p>Heigho! God grant us better days my Friend; or, what were equally good, a lighter heart to bear these with!&#x2014; It is late; and I ought to be asleep.</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Your Letter came yesterday; most welcome to me: last night I was at Mrs Buller&#x2019;s rout (of &#x201C;the flower of Radicalism&#x201D;) and begged a frank, tho&#x2019; it was but little needful. Nothing but approval of your plans to send in it; but paper-scraps, mementos and good wishes.&#x2014; Consider, my dear fellow, I have sat here writing at my Book, till <supplied>[it]</supplied> is a quarter past three; and then that I have an Enclosure for Jane to write!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note></p>
<p>Jane, as you may have gathered one way and another, set off on Saturday Night for Templand: she was really getting utterly sick and miserable, and had need to do it. By a Newspaper on Tuesday I learned that she had got safe to Manchester (I suppose Hanning was waiting for her); by another Newspaper today I find her &#x201C;just this moment got to Liverpool: sick yesterday&#x201D;; and that she is to sail &#x201C;on Thursday&#x201D; (this day) tho&#x2019; whether for Dumfries or Annan I cannot tell. You must see her, and be as good to her as you can; do not say Medicine can do nothing (tho&#x2019; that I do believe is the truth); but question her, speculate with her, speak hope to her: she is very disheartened,&#x2014;that is her grand ailment, with hot London; acting and reacting. I fancy that whenever she sees Templand she will b<supplied>[egin to]</supplied> recove<supplied>[r]</supplied>&#x2014; And for you, come off hither with our Mother to Manchester <pb id="pg-09-8" n="09:8"/>at the set <supplied>[time or]</supplied> as near it as may be.

<p>Heaven be praised, here I am at last dear Husband, a most tired but not utterly demolished Goody. On the whole I have been mercifully dealt with; my journey has been assuaged for me in many ways which I had no reason to expect, and considering my want of sleep and all the rest of it I am in a wonderful state of efficiency already. The man you saw in the coach with me was my only fellow-passenger to Derby; so that during the night I had a whole side to stretch myself on, and <pb id="pg-09-10" n="09:10"/>from Derby to Manchester I might even recline diagonally having the whole coach to myself&#x2014;besides the ample-room and verge enough<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Gray, <hi rend="italic">The Bard,</hi> l.51.</note> I had also to congratulate myself on uninterrupted silence; for even while <hi rend="italic">the man</hi> was there, no speech went on; he rolled up his greatcoat to make a cushion for my back, presented me with three lemon lozenges, and for the rest took no notice of me whatever. On arriving in Manchester, I felt considerable apprehension for it had long been revealed to my recollection that, according to my late practice, I had come of<supplied>[f]</supplied> without Hanning&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">address!</hi> so that if noone awaited me at the coach I should be set down in the street with my trunk in one of the foolishest dilemmas imaginable! But Roberts happy face popped in at the coach window, even before we stopt, rescued me from the wellmerited punishment of my inadvertency&#x2014;he actually dropt a tear! of joy! at sight of me and looked as tho&#x2019; he were half minded to kiss me <foreign><hi rend="italic">br&#xfc;derlich</hi></foreign> [brotherly] but that I rather waved. We mounted into a hackney and in a few instants were opened to by <foreign>wee</foreign> Jenny, who welcomed me most cordially in her still way. Both indeed expressed a satisfaction that was highly consolatory to a wandering pilgrim, and so also was the excellent chicken broth which was served up to me in no time. Jenny makes a most sedate orderly satisfactory-looking <foreign>hausfrau</foreign> [housewife]&#x2014;and her little husband barring a little innocent vanity &#x26; <hi rend="italic">trustful forwardness</hi> is a most comfortable Landlord. But let no weary traveller ever dream of staying there with any view to <hi rend="italic">sleep!</hi> the house is a nice enough little house, and the bedroom <hi rend="italic">looks</hi> rather inviting even, but the bed is hard as a deal board, with a considerable elevation in the shape of Burnswark in the middle, there is mor<supplied>[e]</supplied>over a species of bug in it which raises lumps &#x201C;the size of a hazel nut&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Exaggerative phrase of mine; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> she used to quiz me for&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note).</note>&#x2014;and to crown all you are next door to &#x201C;a <hi rend="italic">Jerry</hi> [beer] <hi rend="italic">shop</hi>&#x201D; whence drunk people issue into the street all night long, trying who to rage loudest. Nothing would have tempted me to stay two <hi rend="italic">nights</hi> had I been able to proceed; but my head was horrible on the Monday. On Tuesday afternoon I reached Liverpool after a flight (for it can be called nothing else) of thirty four miles within an hour and quarter.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340518-TC-JAC-01"><sic>7:160</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1834-05-18">18 May 1834</date></corr></ref>.</note> I was dreadfully frightened before the train started; in the nervous weak state I was in it seemed to me certain that I should faint and then the impossibility of getting the horrible thing stopt!&#x2014;but I felt no difference between the motion of the steam carriage and that in which I had come from London; it did not seem to be going <pb id="pg-09-11" n="09:11"/>any faster. As I had sent no intimation to Maryland street I was left to my own shifts on landing&#x2014;the greatest difficulty was in getting my trunk from among the hundred others where it was tumbled&#x2014; &#x201C;You must take your turn Mam, you must take your turn&#x201D; was all the satisfaction I could get in pressing towards the heap&#x2014;at last I said &#x201C;stand out of the road will you, there is the trunk before my eyes and I will lift it away myself without troubling any one&#x201D;! Whereupon the Clerk cried out in a rage &#x201C;for Godsake give that Lady her trunk and let us be rid of her&#x201D; the omnibus man clutched it out of my hands, and promised to put me down within ten yards of Maryland street<supplied>[.]</supplied> He was better than his word for he drove me to the very door. Nothing could exceed the astonishment occasioned by my apparition in the room where they were sitting at their des<supplied>[s]</supplied>ert. There was wondering and laughing without end, but no tea&#x2014;no prospect of any&#x2014;till at last in e<supplied>[x]</supplied>treme thirst and despair I fell to work on a plateful of strawberries and cream! instead of killing me the mess agreed with me so well, that I had strawberries and cream <hi rend="italic">six</hi> times during the day and half I stayed!! They were in a great confusion with painters &#x26;c &#x26;c, but as kind as ever; and as inconsiderate about sleep&#x2014; I thought the bugs of Manchester had left the Liverpool ones nothing to do&#x2014;but I was mistaken<supplied>[.]</supplied> I had twenty new bites on my neck and arms the first night&#x2014; O darling thank heaven that we are without bugs! and see that Johns window be kept up when he returns and order Ann to take down his clothes and shake them in the garden; for he will go by Manchester&#x2014; On Thursday night at ten oclock I was to sail&#x2014;but the sea was a little rough and my Uncle had heard something of the boiler being unsafe, and so nothing would pacify him but that I should go by the Mail; as the most convincing argument that could be used he went and took a seat for me, and payed it himself: besides this, he layed out eight guineas on the largest, warmest, most beautiful shawl that ever was seen, to <hi rend="italic">regale</hi> me with, on my birth-day!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;(<date when="1836-07-14">July 14</date>)&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note).</note> the day I left Liverpool&#x2014; It was a most well-timed present for the weather is become intensely cold, and I left London in a most destitute condition with respect to wrappings&#x2014;I was obliged to buy a pair of drawers in Liverpool&#x2014;and since I came here there has been such a seeking out of warm stockings and flannel shifts!&#x2014;and with all I am in a continual shiver. I wrote to John and my Mother from Liverpool&#x2014;warning the former to meet me at Dumfries and expecting the latter to come without being asked&#x2014;as she did&#x2014; When the Mail stopt <pb id="pg-09-12" n="09:12"/>at the Kings Arms<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;(Dumfries)&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note).</note> I saw my trunk into the house and then ran over to the Commercial to tell M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Wilson that if my Mother should come I was gone out to Jane&#x2019;s&#x2014;for I was in at half after eight&#x2014;and the steam boat was not expected till eleven&#x2014;while I was waiting in the lobby for M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Wilson my Mother came down the stairs! such an embracing&#x2014;and such a crying! the very boots was affected with it and spoke in a plaintive voice all morning after. Mother looks well&#x2014;and is making a perfect fool of me with kindness. I was scarce home when she presented me with a purse she had worked me&#x2014;filled with sovereigns! for my birth-day present!!&#x2014;so that I shall not be poorer for my journey&#x2014; John came before we left Dumfries with Alick&#x2014;and astonished me considerably by announcing his intention of leaving the middle of next week without seeing more of me<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Off to visit me, it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> seem,&#x2014;and no real hurry that way, but his own?&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note). But Carlyle had just written to John on <date when="1836-07-14">14 July</date> that &#x201C;I had never more wish for you, than now in my loneliness.&#x201D;</note>&#x2014; My Mother pressed him much to go with us in the chaise to Templand but no!&#x2014;I might be as ill as I liked on landing it was not he that had any notion of helping me thro it. Alick and Jane were both very silent&#x2014; I supposed my Mother introduced an element of foreign<supplied>[n]</supplied>ess into the concern&#x2014;but I shall go and see them all at home as soon as I am able&#x2014;and then there will be more <hi rend="italic">out-come</hi> I expect. I did well enough on getting home till I dined&#x2014;and then I got deadly cold,&#x2014;and my Mother wrapt me in wrappings innumerable,&#x2014;and then I fell asleep and then I awoke with my head and body all in one cramp&#x2014;not Caliban but a cramp<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">The Tempest</hi>, V, i.</note>&#x2014;and then I did not know what I said or did&#x2014;for it was the third night I had not slept a wink&#x2014;and then they gave me tea and bathed my feet and put me to bed. I had a wonderful night but slept off and on to a considerable extent and today I am up&#x2014;and as you see able to write&#x2014;after a fashion&#x2014; You may expect John the end of next week&#x2014; I am going to be ill off with sour bread and boiled tea! and there are no peats to bake</p>
<p>I forgot to send the meal to John Mill<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Was for his Father&#x2019;s use. Father was now on his deathbed, and had taken a longing for the food of his childhood&#x2014; This I conclude w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be a supplementary or <hi rend="italic">second</hi> sending; no third, alas, was needed&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note). Perhaps some may originally have been sent to James Mill for this reason but Carlyle had sent this meal to John Mill with instructions for making porridge three weeks after James Mill&#x2019;s death (see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18360712-TC-JSM-01">TC to JSM, <date when="1836-07-12">12 July</date></ref>).</note>&#x2014;I hope you have done it. Write instantly and tell me how you get on to the minutest item&#x2014; I mourned to hear of the sleepless nights&#x2014;next letter, it is to be hoped <pb id="pg-09-13" n="09:13"/>will be more worth postage&#x2014;as yet I am not subsided into good sense&#x2014;or &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">proper feelings</hi>.&#x201D; Kind compliments to Ann&#x2014; I sent her letter by John<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;(To Annan)&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note).</note>&#x2014;and will take the Dolls<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;(For her Sisters)&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note).</note> myself&#x2014;her people were all well.

Neither the leisure not the fit humour comes. I looked at some of the <hi rend="italic">marginalia</hi> the day they came but not with a pen in my hand. That of <hi rend="italic">doomed</hi> I remembered not to have been right but also that at the moment I could not make it <hi rend="italic">righter:</hi> there is an alteration here on a little slip, which you may introduce if you can find it.

I also noticed (I think) something you had changed about St Simonism;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably deleted as no reference to St. Simonism remains.</note> here too your pencilling seemed better than the penwork. The rest I must leave you to manage yourself. Pray pardon me. It seems to my sick feeling, as if I could not open that fatal <hi rend="italic">Ms.</hi> again for a guinea; as if should I once break the skin of it again, I should only by much pain make it <hi rend="italic">worse</hi>.&#x2014; My opinion of Dumont<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Pierre Etienne Louis Dumont (<date when="1759-00-00">1759</date>&#x2013;<date when="1829-00-00">1829</date>), Swiss political writer, had met Mirabeau in <date when="1788-00-00">1788</date> and worked with him <date when="1789-00-00">1789</date>&#x2013;<date when="1791-00-00">91</date>; in <date when="1792-00-00">1792</date> he returned to England. He also edited Jeremy Bentham and after <date when="1814-00-00">1814</date> returned to a political career in Geneva. For Carlyle&#x2019;s opinion of him and his <hi rend="italic">Souvenirs sur Mirabeau</hi> (London, <date when="1832-00-00">1832</date>), see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XXVIII, 414&#x2013;15; and see also <ref target="volume-06/lt-18320828-TC-JSM-01"><sic>6:212</sic><corr>TC to JSM, <date when="1832-08-28">28 Aug. 1832</date></corr></ref>.</note> I think is not much different from yours;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Nevertheless &#x201C;Memoirs of Mirabeau,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">London and Westminster Review</hi>, XXVI (<date when="1837-01-00">Jan. 1837</date>), 390&#x2013;91, contained a long editor&#x2019;s note by Mill recording &#x201C;his dissent from such portion of [Carlyle&#x2019;s remarks] as seems to impute to M. Dumont a conceited assumption of merits not his own.&#x201D;</note> certainly not hostile, not disrespectful: he had a better notion of Mirabeau than the world had at that time, yet very far from a just one; and his <hi rend="italic">has</hi> now become a kind of ridiculous one, and ought to pay the penalty of having arranged itself, even so far, on the side of a little world against a great man. I feel however as if D. had got rather more than enough; and, justice above all being the rule, I will <pb id="pg-09-15" n="09:15"/>help him if I can in anything. I keep your Paper, and when the Proofsheets come, will take what account of it is possible.</p>
<p>Indeed, if we have any business of this kind to do again, I imagine it will be better to leave it altogether for that joyful stage of the process: one is in spirits about the thing; one&#x2019;s hand is <hi rend="italic">in</hi>. Write down whatsoever thing you have to remark; and let it lie before me <hi rend="italic">then</hi>. I think I can say that there is no man whose remark I should feel more bound to consider in such a case. There is no man living of whose remark I should know so certainly beforehand these two important particulars: that it meant <hi rend="italic">something</hi> and very clearly understood what it did mean; also that it had taken the pains to understand <hi rend="italic">me,</hi> and was, far beyond my deserts, generous and well-affected towards me.</p>
<p>As to my quarrel with the Nominative-and-verb,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In his letter Mill had said: &#x201C;The only general remark I have to make on the stile is that I think it would often <hi rend="italic">tell</hi> better on the reader if what is said in an abrupt, exclamatory, &#x26; interjectional manner were said in the ordinary grammatical mode of nominative &#x26; verb.&#x201D; The explanation which Carlyle gives in reply to Mill is certainly one of the most illuminating comments which he makes on his own style, especially his descriptive style treating places and persons.</note> I do assure you it is one that I daily reflect on with great sorrow; but it is not a quarrel of my seeking. I mean, that the common English mode of writing has to do with what I call <hi rend="italic">hearsays</hi> of things; and the great business for me, in which alone I feel any comfort, is recording the <hi rend="italic">presence,</hi> bodily concrete coloured presence of things;&#x2014;for which the Nominative-and-verb, as I find it Here and Now, refuses to stand me in due stead. Hence our quarrel; and separation, really an unblessed one! I do believe however that I have not taken all I could have got from this poor N.-and-V.: but I <hi rend="italic">will do it</hi>&#x2014;more and more as I grow wiser.</p>
<p>On the whole I am too much in the state the Scotch Pedlar thought the Londoners in: &#x201C;A very good people Ma&#x2019;am, very clever people; but <hi rend="italic">terribly aff for a l</hi><hi rend="small-caps">ang</hi><hi rend="italic">itch</hi>.&#x201D;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-04/lt-18271025-TC-JAC-01"><sic>4:271</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1827-10-25">25 Oct. 1827</date></corr></ref>.</note></p>

<salute>My dear Womannie,</salute>
<p>I promised on a Newspaper that I would write so soon as my Chapter was finished; and that great event having happened yesterday at two o&#x2019;clock, I with right good will proceed to fulfilment. You will first however get a Newspaper; sent off yesterday, indicating Jack&#x2019;s arrival; sent off in great haste in the evening: there was no time then to do more. He tells me the <hi rend="italic">former</hi> scrap of a Letter was not forwarded till Wednesday last; I was uncertain, from your Letter, whether you had not received it, at the meeting at Dumfries.&#x2014; Pity that this pen <hi rend="italic">spurts!</hi></p>
<p>There has nothing gone wrong since you went away; and now that I have news of your safe nestling beside your Mother, all is well. It was a sad shaking that of the long Coach-ride and whirling on Railways for a poor weak Goody, and would shatter her terribly; neither I fancy is the Country at its best, this rainy season: but still it is the Country; it is your Mother; and the infinite fret and tumult of this place is far behind you. Splash away in the shower-bath; drink new milk (with a little brandy in it); tolerate the Country gossips; possess your wearied soul in patience; and come back to me rested and well, and <hi rend="italic">all</hi> will be well. Hast thou recovered any Hope? O thou of little faith!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Matt. 14:31.</note>&#x2014; Your Uncle never did a more judicious thing in his life than buying you that shawl: for which I thank him with all my heart. I hope you delivered my &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">special</hi> compliments&#x201D;; it is a cheering kind of kind of [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] thing for me to remember a broad brave Annandale Man of that figure: how greatly different from the Formulas of Men one meets with, here and elsewhere!&#x2014; Have you <hi rend="italic">got</hi> baked Bread yet? I advise you to heat the oven with <hi rend="italic">coals,</hi> and on the whole to <hi rend="italic">realize</hi> Bread. Have you Cavaignac&#x2019;s Manuscript,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified. Cavaignac was presumably writing for the <hi rend="italic">London and Westminster Review</hi> and other journals.</note> or any kind of work? Be not solitary, be not idle.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-09-17" n="09:17"/>Here, however, lest I utterly forget elsewhere, I must mention two most important things. The first is; touching a <hi rend="small-caps">scrub</hi>.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A pot scrubber made of heather stalks tied together.</note> Anne, quite radiant when your Letter came, to hear that you were well and safe, said, or rather chaunted, about an hour after, in the querulous expostulatory tone: &#x201C;But, if ye please, Mrs Cairlile said&#x2014;she was to fetch us <hi rend="italic"><foreign>twae</foreign> Scrubs&#x2014;?</hi>&#x201D; Tho&#x2019; sunk into the depths at that moment, I could not restrain a visible smile; and answered, &#x201C;Surely surely, I would attend to <hi rend="italic">that</hi>.&#x201D; The second thing is, touching those shirt-collars: I find that, especially with the <hi rend="italic">stock</hi>, they do not answer on the <hi rend="italic">new</hi> shirts so well as they would do if <hi rend="italic">both</hi> the front buttons had holes, and got a hold. The collar rubs up behind, namely; and finally loses its place altogether. What you have to do therefore is to make the solid space in the front of the Collar (that is, the space where the tape is, in the old ones) a half inch <hi rend="italic">higher</hi> than perhaps you mean (three quarters of an inch will do no ill, even, and be useful otherwise): the second or upper button-hole you need not <hi rend="italic">cut</hi> till you return and see the thing. If you have made any already in the old way, I believe even that will do, and you need not disturb yourself with repentance or remonstrance. These are the two important things I was afraid of forgetting.</p>
<p>Since that Saturday Night,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1836-07-09">9 July</date>, when Jane had left London.</note> I have had the most private speechless life of perhaps all men in London. Gibson<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Gibson.</note> parted with me at the corner of Lad Lane; and I naturally did <hi rend="italic">not</hi> go to his walk next day. The weather then, as with you, became cool, became cold, wet; unfavourable for visitations; and hardly two or three mortals (always too at times when I was out) have come to stir the knocker. The French are occupied with <foreign><hi rend="italic">Ma m&#xE8;re et ma soeur;</hi></foreign><note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Julie and Caroline Cavaignac (see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18360714-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1836-07-14">14 July</date></ref>).</note> Cavaignac tho&#x2019; he had made an appoint<hi rend="italic">t</hi> with his Doonet<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified, possibly another French exile.</note> (the Advocate), and volunteered to that effect, did not make it out till three days after the time; and I have never seen him since, or got up yet to see his women, tho&#x2019; I meant to do it,&#x2014;last night, if Jack had not come. The weather catches you in showers; little or no complaint, even for me, of heat: it has rained many hours, even now, is raining and like to rain: I have resumed my flannels cotton-drawers, and write just now in the plaid-gown.&#x2014; But before quitting Cavaignac, I must tell you a thing I <hi rend="italic">saw</hi> at Mrs Buller&#x2019;s rout, but did not <hi rend="italic">discern</hi> till a day or two after. Charles <pb id="pg-09-18" n="09:18"/>Buller led C. away to introduce him to a large lady, whom I afterwards perceived to be Mrs Grote:<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Harriet Grote (see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350615-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1835-06-15">15 June 1835</date></ref>).</note> C. went, without struggling, tho&#x2019; verily like a sheep led to the slaughter; the presentation performed, he made I think <hi rend="italic">five</hi> successive low bows to Mrs Grote (a very shower of rapid bows); then, without uttering a word, reeled back, like a sheep <hi rend="italic">from</hi> the slaughter (or a <hi rend="italic">calf</hi>, for you know how he <hi rend="italic">goes</hi>), and landing in a very elegant attitude, stood, five paces off, with his hat behind his back, looking out into space and the general movement of the Rout,&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">this</hi> whole Introduction, Acquaintance, Friendship being begun, carried on, finished and abolished with such incredible brevity as I describe! It was two days before this phenonemon presented itself rightly before me; and it has tickled me ever since. That, I think, is the best method I have ever seen of being introduced to the large Mrs Grote; and to many other women and men.</p>
<p>Pepoli called also, one night; made Anne understand that he had been &#x201C;very ill&#x201D;; she <supplied>[told]</supplied> him that you were got home and about to get well. The only character that has actually got to see me here (for I was out, as you gather when Pepoli &#x26;c came) is Beatrice the <foreign><hi rend="italic">Pilgernde Th&#xF6;rinn</hi></foreign><hi rend="italic">:</hi><note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-08/lt-18360606-TC-JSM-01">TC to JSM, [<date when="1836-06-06">6 June</date>]</ref>.</note> she came and informed me, one day, that Lady Franklin<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lady Jane Franklin, <foreign>n&#xE9;e</foreign> Griffin (<date when="1792-00-00">1792</date>&#x2013;<date when="1875-00-00">1875</date>) second wife of Sir John Franklin (<date when="1786-00-00">1786</date>&#x2013;<date when="1847-00-00">1847</date>) Arctic explorer. Sir John had just been appointed lieutenant-governor of Van Diemen&#x2019;s Land. Lady Jane travelled extensively in Australasia and worked to improve the conditions of female convicts until <date when="1843-00-00">1843</date> when Sir John&#x2019;s term was completed. She continued to travel in Asia and after his disappearance on his expedition to the North West Passage organized several search expeditions.</note> had tried and investigated her, offered her the place; and that she &#x2014;?&#x2014; had declined it for the &#x201C;long <foreign><hi rend="italic">voyage de mer</hi></foreign> [sea voyage]&#x201D;! I was positively very angry at the hapless goose of a woman; and read her a vehement long lecture in bad French; advising her to go instantly and <hi rend="italic">un</hi>say such a folly: my words seemed to distress her, without benefit: she has never come back.<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Had Beatrice Novelli taken the post she would not have arrived in Hobart Town until <date when="1837-01-06">6 Jan. 1837</date>.</note> Miss Fergus<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350800-JWC-JCA-01">JWC to JCA, [<date when="1835-08-00">mid-Aug. 1835</date>]</ref>.</note> however sent for me, the other day; said that <hi rend="italic">another</hi> situation had turned up for the <foreign><hi rend="italic">gomeril</hi></foreign> [blockhead] (at Brighton I think in a Boarding school, the people are French); which it was to be expected she would be got buckled to. Meanwhile, Miss F. entrusted me with &#xa3;5 for her, was to send &#x201C;Clothes&#x201D; out of Scotland;&#x2014;I must go and see the poor creature, and make John speak Italian to her. My desire is that I saw her fairly <pb id="pg-09-19" n="09:19"/>sitting in the Coach. She may live a century without such an offer as this she has refused.</p>
<p>Of the <foreign><hi rend="italic">Stimabiles</hi></foreign><note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edward and Hester Sterling.</note> nothing; not a <foreign><hi rend="italic">Stimabile</hi></foreign> since I last wrote. It is a week past on Friday night since I saw John (I went thither): I suppose him busied with making his arrangements, poor fellow, and not at all in good heart. My plan was to go to him today; which if things allow I shall still be glad to do. Yesterday (after finishing) I knocked for Mrs S. the Elder; she was not in: I left compliments, and those three little volumes (<hi rend="italic">Maria Williams</hi>)<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Helen Maria Williams (<date when="1762-00-00">1762</date>&#x2013;<date when="1827-00-00">1827</date>), writer and advocate for the French Revolution. Her two works published in three volumes were <hi rend="italic">Letters concerning a sketch of the Politics of France</hi> &#x2026; 2nd ed. (Dublin, <date when="1796-00-00">1796</date>) and <hi rend="italic">The political and confidential correspondence of Lewis the sixteenth</hi> (London, <date when="1803-00-00">1803</date>).</note> you were so anxious about.&#x2014; One night also, being determined to <hi rend="italic">order</hi> myself a pair of shoes (<hi rend="italic">trash</hi> beyond utterance; ugly and <hi rend="italic">dear</hi>, are my late pairs), I called on Allan Cunningham to ask: Not in. Then forward to Willis, to ask: Not in. Wherefore, home;&#x2014;and the shoes are still unordered. Jack has offered me an old pair; which I think I shall accept. By the bye, James Aitken has a pair of Lasts lying ready, and a cast of my Foot; will you take down these Lasts that image of the Foot (&#x201C;roots of <hi rend="italic">trieys</hi>&#x201D;<note n="15" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;His brother Alick had once remarked that Carlyle&#x2019;s toes were so long that they were &#x2018;like the roots of <hi rend="italic">trieys</hi> (trees)&#x2019;&#x201D; (A. Carlyle&#x2019;s note).</note> and all), and considering it deeply, and consulting with James who is a judicious man see of you cannot order me a pair of shoes to be made off them? See if you cannot, Goody with that <foreign><hi rend="italic">hellen Blick</hi></foreign> [clear sure eye] of yours! Poor James has sent me two pounds of Mundell Tobacco, by Jack; a sort of thing, which I know not why, almost made me <foreign><hi rend="italic">greet</hi></foreign> [weep]: it was in huge coarse paper; the poor Brother had earned it by the toil of his right-hand: I remembered him a tow-headed judicious herd-boy; and so may many chancings and changings had gone on since then. Thank him <hi rend="italic">heartily</hi> from me (but not in the sad mood).&#x2014; I believe you had also better choose me a pair of winter trousers; <hi rend="italic">you:</hi> and set Shankland<note n="16" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Shankland, a tailor (see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18321112-TC-JWC-01"><sic>6:254</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1832-11-12">12 Nov. 1832</date></corr></ref>).</note> on them, if he have the measure: wide enough, long enough; not too heavy, and of a dim colour! I shall then have nothing to do with Cockney snips for another blessed winter,&#x2014;perhaps never more in time?</p>
 <p>I must tell you about the Mill visit, for I think I sent a token that I <hi rend="italic">was</hi> going.<note n="17" place="bottom" type="gloss" >To Mickleham, near Dorking.</note> I went accordingly; our arrangements only failing to this extent, that I did not meet Mill and Grant till we got to the end <pb id="pg-09-20" n="09:20"/>(thirty miles off), there being <hi rend="italic">two</hi> coaches that day. It is a pretty country, a pretty village, of the English straggling wooded sort: the Mills have joined some &#x201C;old Carpenter&#x2019;s-shops&#x201D; together, and made a pleasant summer mansion (connected by shed-roofed passages), the little drawing-room door of glass looking out into a rose-lawn, into green plains, and half-a-mile off to a most respectable wooded-and-open broad-shouldered Green Hill. They were as hospitable as they could be; I was led about, made attentive to innumerable picturesqueness &#x26;c &#x26;c; all that evening and next day: I awoke at <hi rend="italic">three</hi> the first morning; at five the next,&#x2014;when happily we had to return at seven. You would have done little good with the two sisters,<note n="18" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mill had five sisters who would all have been there: Wilhelmina Forbes (<date when="1808-00-00">1808</date>&#x2013;<date when="1861-00-00">61</date>), Clara, Harriet Isabella (<date when="1812-00-00">1812</date>&#x2013;<date when="1897-00-00">97</date>), Jane Stuart (<date when="1816-00-00">1816</date>?&#x2013;<date when="1883-00-00">83</date>) and Mary Elizabeth (<date when="1822-00-00">1822</date>&#x2013;<date when="1913-00-00">1913</date>). Carlyle presumably meant the two eldest.</note> tho&#x2019; they are worthy girls in their way. But <supplied>[it]</supplied> is a way!&#x2014;all riveted, and cased, and checked as by coats of mail. There was little sorrow visible in their house; or rather none, nor any human feeling at all; but the strangest <foreign><hi rend="italic">unheimlich</hi></foreign> [weirdly inhuman] kind of composure and acquiescence,&#x2014;as if under a deadly pressure of Fear, all human spontaneity had taken refuge in invisible corners. Mill himself talked much, and not stupidly, far from that, but without emotion of any discernible kind: he seemed to me to be withering or withered into the miserablest metaphysical <foreign><hi rend="italic">scrae</hi></foreign> [thin, shriveled creature], body and mind, that I had almost ever met with in the world. His eyes go twinkling and jerking with wild lights and twitches, his head is bald, his face brown and dry: poor fellow, after all!&#x2014;it seemed to me the strangest thing what this man could want with me, or I with such a man, so <foreign><hi rend="italic">unheimlich</hi></foreign> [dismal] to me. What will become of it? Nothing evil; for there is and there was nothing dishonest in it. But I think I shall see less and less of him. Alas, poor fellow, it seems possible too that <hi rend="italic">he</hi> may not be very long there seeable,&#x2014;that is one way of its ending; to say nothing of my own chances! He is for a Tour, however, of &#x201C;three months,&#x201D; with his two little Brothers; on the Continent: there is some hope in that. How Mrs Taylor adjusts herself I have not the slightest notion: Mill spoke of Switzerland; and hoped to be off &#x201C;in a fortnight&#x201D; (a week now).<note n="19" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Mill and his brothers Henry (<date when="1820-00-00">1820</date>&#x2013;<date when="1840-00-00">40</date>), also unwell, and George Grote (ca. <date when="1825-00-00">1825</date>&#x2013;<date when="1853-00-00">53</date>) left for Paris on <date when="1836-07-30">30 July</date>, where they joined Harriet Taylor and her children. The party travelled to Geneva and Lausanne where the children were left. Mill and Mrs. Taylor continuing as far as Genoa. They all returned to London in <date when="1836-11-00">November</date>.</note> Had I any chance to see him down at Chelsea some evening? &#x201C;Not the slightest: for&#x201D;&#x2014; And the <pb id="pg-09-21" n="09:21"/>Coach drew up at the Elephant &#x26; Castle, and I shook hands with him, and went my way. Little Grant was as assiduous as ever; rather deafer, rather sharper in the nose: really not very well, poor little fellow. My expedition cost me twelve &#x201C;white shillings&#x201D;; and I will not go again, by any means, till I be richer.&#x2014; Since that day, I have had my <hi rend="italic">Mirabeau</hi> returned with a sheet of &#x201C;remarks&#x201D; on it. The remarks are of no import or little; in a style of great fear-of-offence; accompanied by a Note that I am not to put myself out of humour, with the thing: but let it stand altogether as it is rather.<note n="20" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mill had ended his note &#x201C;I ask nothing but that you will deal with it as you like, disregarding all my observations if you do not think them just&#x2014;&#x26; in any case that you will not make the thing an annoyance to you. It is quite good enough &#x26; too good for us as it is&#x201D; ([<date when="1836-07-20">20? July</date>], Mineka, XII, 307).</note> I did not put myself out of humour with the thing: I let it lie eight and forty hours; sent it back with a Note that &#x201C;two&#x201D; of the things proposed were perhaps improvements; that I kept the &#x201C;remarks&#x201D; till the Proofsheets came, but felt as if I could not open &#x201C;that fatal Manuscript again, for a guinea.&#x201D; It was cheerfully written; but indicated that &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">remarking</hi>&#x201D; on the part even of Ablest Editors was a thing to be cautiously done: that if we wrote together, at all (with Hickson<note n="21" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Edward Hickson (see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18340218-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1834-02-18">18 Feb.</date></ref>) and presumably Thomas Falconer (see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18361020-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1836-10-20">20 Oct.</date></ref>) and others unidentified.</note> and Company), we must have very <hi rend="italic">considerable</hi> headway allowed us. Truly, it is &#x201C;impossible&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">otherwise:</hi> your whole soul dries up, and freezes in the miserablest manner. This went off to Mill yesterday morning; I suppose I shall have the proofs soon. He wishes me to write, I forget what more; I wish to feel myself infinitely better at home in the thing before writing much more; and indeed do not care much, if I never write more in it,&#x2014;nor in any beggarly &#x201C;dog&#x2019;s-meat cart&#x201D;<note n="22" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For an extension of this image for reviews and magazines, cf. <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370608-TC-JOST-01">TC to <sic>JS</sic><corr>JOST</corr>, <sic><date when="1837-06-09">9 June 1837</date></sic><corr><date when="1837-06-08">[8] June 1837</date></corr></ref>.</note> like it, but take <hi rend="italic">all</hi> manner of consequences rather.&#x2014; This thing I believe will look uglier to you than it is: be content, it is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> ugly at all, nor was; it was only <hi rend="italic">brief</hi>, and a thing one required to despatch, and put on a practicable footing.</p>
<p>As for the <hi rend="italic">Chapter</hi> entitled <date when="1836-09-00"><hi rend="italic">September</hi></date>, the poor Goody knows with satisfaction that it is <hi rend="italic">done</hi>. I worked all day, not all night; indeed oftenest, not at night at all: but went out, and had long swift-striding walks (till ten) under the stars. I also slept in general tolerably: for the last two days, however, I have been poisoned again with <hi rend="italic">veal</hi> <hi rend="small-caps">soup</hi> (beef being unattainable); I <hi rend="italic">will</hi> know again! The Chapter is some 36 close pages: not at all a bad Chapter;&#x2014;would the Goody had it to read! A hundred pages more, and this cursed Book is flung out <pb id="pg-09-22" n="09:22"/>from me. I mean to write with the force of fire till that consummation; &#x2014;above all, with the speed of fire; still taking natural <hi rend="italic">intervals</hi>, of course, and resting myself; the unrested horse or writer <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> work. But a despicability of a thing that has so long held me and held us both down to the grindstone is a thing I could almost swear at, and kick out of doors; at least, most swiftly equip for <hi rend="italic">walking</hi> out of doors. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Speranza</hi></foreign> [Hope], thou &#x2019;Spairkin [Despairing]<note n="23" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Despairkin, one of Carlyle&#x2019;s nicknames for Jane.</note> Goody; <hi rend="italic">Hope</hi>, my little Lassie, it will all be better than thou thinkest!&#x2014; For two or three days I am to have the most perfect rest now. Then Louis is to be tried and guillotined; then the <hi rend="italic">Gironde</hi> &#x26;c &#x26;c: it all stands pretty fair in my head; nor do I mean to <hi rend="italic">investigate</hi> much more about it, but to splash down what I know, in large masses of colours; that it may look like a smoke-and-flame conflagration in the distance,&#x2014;which it is.</p>
<p>The inclosed Minto Letter<note n="24" place="bottom" type="gloss" >From David Aitken announcing his marriage to Eliza Stodart on <date when="1836-07-13">13 July</date>.</note> was rather ill used by me; at the words &#x201C;great <supplied>[day,]</supplied> the <date when="1836-07-13">13<hi rend="italic">th</hi></date>,&#x201D; I (being indeed busy, and deprived of 15 pence) put it quickly into the drawer, and proceeded again: but at night I did take it out and read it; with remorse, with pious sensibility, How beautiful Nature is. Even to the <foreign><hi rend="italic">stoory</hi></foreign> [dusty] and the withered! And what does it cost <hi rend="italic">thee</hi>,&#x2014;unbrotherly Churl?&#x2014; If you thought there were any enjoyment for you at Minto, why not go? You are not writing a &#x201C;French R<hi rend="italic">n</hi> a History&#x201D;; nor living on veal-soup.&#x2014; In the Newspaper (Courier last) I read with a very sorrowful shock the notice of the Death of Mitchell.<note n="25" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In his <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi> (<date when="1836-07-00">late July</date>) Carlyle notes &#x201C;Poor R.

<p>Jack and I have talked immensely since he came; he has mounted up stairs now and is quiet. My mother and he passed thro&#x2019; Liverpool (on Monday, I think): he regretted much that it was so early (8 o&#x2019;clock, or some hour the Railway performed at) that he had to pass the Maryland-Street door, without knocking and brief greeting. He seems not in very high spirits, nor do I wonder at it. This morning, <pb id="pg-09-23" n="09:23"/>however, there came a Letter that W. Fraser is to be in Rome over winter. I think his medical way of treating you was unjust to himself and to you; tho&#x2019; the scientific fact it went on was <hi rend="italic">true:</hi> were our nerves better, we shall all be able to judge more justly. &#x201C;Also ye shall bear one another&#x2019;s burdens&#x201D;:<note n="28" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf.

<p>My dear little Janekin! I must leave thee now. Write a long Letter: they are all very pleasant, very good for me; but the &#x201C;reposing humour&#x201D; would give me most pleasure of all. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Gehab Dich wohl!

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Owing to such visiting and running about as there has been of late,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mrs. Carlyle had been with Jean in Dumfries and was now visiting Janet in Manchester.</note> you and I have fallen more out of correspondence than usual: <pb id="pg-09-24" n="09:24"/>it seems to me a long time since I wrote you a Letter. This day Jack and I have determined on both of us sending you our news, in the hope of getting a frank to carry them: he is busy upstairs, I down. As you have ventured so far Southwards, farther then you ever were before, a certain degree of <hi rend="italic">encouragement</hi> is more than ever due. I bid you, dear Mother, very heartily welcome into England. When they have got their Railways set up, which will whirl one to London in ten hours more, we may hope to get you even as far south as this.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Though Mrs. Carlyle lived until <date when="1853-00-00">1853</date>, she never visited the Carlyles in London.</note> You will &#x201C;see London&#x201D;; which, however, I apprehend is a <hi rend="italic">sight</hi> you will not be in great ecstacies with. The persons that are in it, particularly one &#x201C;long ill-put-together <hi rend="italic">cameral</hi>&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-08/lt-18351223-JWC-MAC-01"><sic>TC</sic><corr>JWC</corr> to MAC, [<date when="1835-12-23">23 Dec. 1835</date>]</ref>.</note> of a person in it, will be much welcomer as a sight. Six or seven whole Parishes covered with brick, a Town as long as from Scotsbrig to Colinn Tollbar:<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Collin, a village 4 miles east of Dumfries, was a toll point on the Dumfries to Annan road, and was about thirteen miles from Scotsbrig.</note> this is not a thing one rejoices much to see. I apprehend, there is plenty of it in Manchester without going farther.</p>
<p>Jack was extremely welcome to me on Saturday night, just as I had done my work, and was likely to begin feeling the solitude more. There was a wild <foreign><hi rend="italic">moss-hag</hi></foreign><note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Marshy hollows where peats have been cut. Perhaps Farries reminded Carlyle of fugitive Covenanters, who were called <foreign>moss-hagers</foreign> from frequenting such country.</note> of a man with me at the instant, extremely astonishing to see here: one <hi rend="italic">Farries</hi>, I think from Mosshead in Tundergarth;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A farm in Tundergarth parish, 3 miles SE of Lockerbie.</note> a son of the Peat-breast,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A peat-stack or face of a peat-bank. Presumably a nickname of Farries&#x2019;s father. Neither are further identified.</note> whom I had seen once at Alick&#x2019;s at Catlinns,&#x2014;whither he came <hi rend="italic">un</hi>invited, and sat silent getting a little tea. He had come up hither, he said, to see &#x201C;a Cousin who had made a fortune&#x201D;; and also to get a place for himself. The Cousin he had seen; the Place he had not got. I strongly recommended America; was really sorry for the poor smoke-dried dim-visaged wild man;&#x2014;but soon got him out of the house; proposing to <hi rend="italic">walk</hi> with him as far as the Post-Office with your Newspapers.&#x2014; On my return Jack had refreshed himself with mutton-chops; we made two Tumblers of brandy punch (Manchester brandy, if I mistake not); and were as comfortable as the circumstances allowed. Jack looked, and looks, very <foreign><hi rend="italic">gawsy</hi></foreign> [large and jolly]; seemed much improved by his Scotch journey: that first night, his &#x201C;nerves,&#x201D; of course, were greatly &#x201C;<foreign>dadded <pb id="pg-09-25" n="09:25"/>abreed</foreign> [worn to pieces]&#x201D;;<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; cf. <ref target="volume-09/lt-18371019-TC-JA-01">TC to JA, <date when="1837-10-19">19 Oct. 1837</date></ref>.</note> but he had a fine sleep, and all is right again. We have run far and wide; dined with the &#x201C;Reverend Mr Dunn&#x201D; (where was a wild Irish Navy Captain, overflowing with noise good-nature and absurdity); drunk tea with John Sterling, &#x26;c &#x26;c. For the rest of this week, I am idle as man can be; seeking only how I may repose and amuse myself.&#x2014; It is a cheerful circumstance which has turned up, that the day of departure is not till the <date when="1836-09-01">first of September</date> after all; and then that very probably Jack may return in Spring next.</p>
<p>My unfortunate Book goes on now, at a far quicker rate; I shall surely be done with it some three months hence: I have done the first Chapter of the last Volume: it is a long Chapter, and the worst there was to do. Besides I mean to splash along at a much swifter pace in this Volume, with less of care; for the kind of subject has altered, and requires that mode of treatment at any rate. &#x201C;It will not be a bad Book,&#x201D; as I always tell you! And so I shall get my dressing-gown paid at last; and have an unspeakable sorrow shuffled off my hands.&#x2014; The Article on <hi rend="italic">Mirabeau</hi> will be published in some two months or less; I will take care to send you a copy of it, which, after so long a fast from writings of mine, I hope you will read with great appetite.</p>
<p>This summer has not been nearly so hard on me here as last was: indeed the weather was not above one week oppressively hot; there have been great quantities of rain: I fear the Summer is far worse for the <hi rend="italic">Country</hi> than it has been for me. The crops they all say look <hi rend="italic">well;</hi> but one finds it difficult to credit that. There has never been any continuance of effectual <hi rend="italic">heat</hi> to nourish any growing thing as it needs. My confident prophecy is a <hi rend="italic">defective</hi> harvest; which will be good for some, but very bad for many. I was out, 30 miles at Mill&#x2019;s country place, the week before last: the wheat seemed all very healthy; but the <hi rend="italic">ears</hi> wanted, I thought, fully a third of their usual <hi rend="italic">length</hi>. From America also the harvest news are not good. Bad harvests are surely bad for the world; and yet <hi rend="italic">good</hi> harvests too are bad as we have sometimes seen: the poor man finds meal <hi rend="italic">cheap</hi> but no work to do, <hi rend="italic">no</hi> money to buy meal with. Many things are in a mad state among us in these times.</p>
<p>In the last Newspaper I read a notice of the death of my old Friend Mitchell. It gave me a very sorrowful emotion. He was the oldest friend I had; one of the most innocently, gently industrious, well-doing persevering men. John had written to me about him; and <pb id="pg-09-26" n="09:26"/>affected me, not a little, beforehand. He was just one year older than I am.&#x2014; John Sterling goes away on Saturday morning next: also a loved friend, one of my last; obliged to fly to warmer countries for his life, if indeed he can save it then. His family goes all with him; he has shifted and shifted of late years: we have a shifting time. I know not if I mentioned to you how an Uncle of his,<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Rev. Robert Coningham (<date when="1784-00-00">1784</date>&#x2013;<date when="1836-00-00">1836</date>); educated at Peterhouse, Cambridge, an Anglican priest, he had died on <date when="1836-05-21">21 May</date> at Chorley Wood, Herts.</note> an excellent man who came sometimes about us, was cut off suddenly, after a few days illness in Spring last: the old Grandmother<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Elizabeth Coningham, <foreign>n&#xE9;e</foreign> Campbell.</note> (<hi rend="italic">Mother</hi> of this one; young Sterling&#x2019;s Grandmother) is come hither to live with the elder Sterlings; a bent woman of ninety-one. They thought the shock of her favourite Son&#x2019;s sudden death would kill her; but Nature is kind, and makes the very old incapable of feeling much: the old Great Grandmother took it sweetly; chirrups and talks (I have seen her once) as lively as a cricket, and looks as if she might weather many a thing yet.</p>
<p>There has been a Letter from Jane; but hardly with later news than you already have: it was written only some two days after John saw her at Dumfries. She spoke of the great kindness of all people to her; had been exceedingly gratified to see Robert&#x2019;s face look into the Coach for her at Manchester; praised Jenny for her &#x201C;still ways&#x201D;;&#x2014;and on the whole was got well home, and had determined to <hi rend="italic">begin</hi> mending: that was all she could as yet tell me. I have little doubt she will get better fast; I do not press her to return till she be stronger again: sickly here so far from all help is a very bad way of it. She has indeed had too much of the Town: two years of it, without a week of interval. The very whirl of the thing, so long, is enough to shake a weak creature.&#x2014; Anne <foreign><hi rend="italic">ploosters</hi></foreign> [flounders] along here, without the smallest complaint or voluntary misdemeanour, and really does extremely well. She is considerably improved in all ways, I think: she does not want for sense, in her own rude way; above all things, she is good-natured, patient, robustly assiduous: usefuller to <hi rend="italic">me</hi> than the delicatest Cockney Servant within the &#x201C;four ports of Cockneydom,&#x201D; acquainted with all servant-work to a degree, but unable to do it to <hi rend="italic">my thank</hi> [deserve my gratitude]; nay needing rather (if there were no other resource) to be shoved softly out of doors, and bid depart from your sight forever and a day! To me a <hi rend="italic">Coal-John</hi> Establishment<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A &#x201C;Coal-jock&#x201D; was a coal miner and Carlyle may have based his phrase on the false assumption that as whole families worked down the pit each member would do his own housework.</note> <pb id="pg-09-27" n="09:27"/>(every man his <hi rend="italic">own</hi> dish-washer) used often to seem the only reasonable way of it here.</p>
<p>Jenny and you, aided by the assiduous Merchant,<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Hanning.</note> must get up a long Letter for us out of Manchester. There is no doubt but you must; and will?&#x2014; Jack comforts me greatly by his account of your health, of your customary ways at Scotsbrig. Take care of yourself, my dear Mother; take care of yourself for all our sakes!&#x2014; It seems the <foreign><hi rend="italic">Canns</hi></foreign> are up; but put on the <hi rend="italic">wrong</hi> vents as I learn: it is most barbarous, most shocking. The <foreign>cann</foreign> always goes <hi rend="italic">on</hi> the vent you want to save from back-smoke. I wish I were there for one half day. Also <foreign>Canns</foreign> are far better than Slates; there is no doubt of it: but &#x201C;fool fashions&#x201D; will come up.&#x2014;&#x2014; Jane was going to employ you to get me some new flannel drawers for the winter. The old stock are <foreign><hi rend="italic">wauked</hi></foreign> [shrunk], got cold and little and uncomfortable: they were very good for 2 winters. You will see Jane I hope: but do not tire of Manchester and your children till the <foreign>stour</foreign> and <foreign>reek</foreign> grow too bad for you. Tell Jenny what I say about writing. My blessing upon her and her young man; may their life prosper with them for Time and beyond Time!&#x2014; Now, you will write soon? <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign> dear Mother! Your affectionate</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>Dearest of friends&#x2014;</salute> I write the thanks which I cannot speak.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;One of Mrs Basil Montague&#x2019;s too stately preludes of a Letter to her in past years, while the &#x2018;Noble Lady&#x2019; was personally still a stranger&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note).</note> It may be true in most cases as you have often admonished me that &#x201C;he who <pb id="pg-09-29" n="09:29"/>gives quickly gives twice,&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Proverbial.</note> but in the matter of letters, I am very certain that he who gives <hi rend="italic">tardily</hi> gives three or four times. Your letter had been anxiously waited for, and all that anxious waiting told to its advantage: tho&#x2019; by the way, there is not much wisdom in telling you so: since I would rather that the next came to hand enhanced by no such fraudulent merit.</p>
<p>It will not be long however that there will be any need of letters passing between us either swiftly or slowly. Nothing could make living here at all expedient for me except the conviction that I was thereby gaining physical good. and such hope fades further and further into the distance every day. I shall get better in London or not get better as may please the upper powers. in any case <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;there is no use in rebelling against Providence&#x201D;</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;According B<hi rend="italic">r</hi> John, <foreign><hi rend="italic">saepius</hi></foreign> [often]&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note).</note> and I shall try all I can <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to rebel. but here!&#x2014; <foreign>Mio Caro</foreign>, the rain raineth every day; there is no <hi rend="italic">victualling</hi> to be had till ten every morning, at least not without an almost superhuman effort, and I awake quite regularly at four! there is no quiet to be had except in your bed room with the door locked, (for the children Maggie, Mary, and Johnny<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Three of the Welsh cousins from Liverpool.</note> are in perpetual movement, seeking whom they may devour) there is no bread to be had (that is not next thing to poison) for love or money or tears or supplications or even &#x201C;bursts of parliamentary eloquence.&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-06/lt-18330321-TC-JSM-01"><sic>6:350</sic><corr>TC to JSM, <date when="1833-03-21">21 March 1833</date></corr></ref>, <ref target="volume-09/lt-18330321-TC-JHLH-01">TC to <sic>LH</sic><corr>JHLH</corr>, <date when="1833-03-21">21 March 1833</date></ref> [letters placed unchronologically], and &#x201C;Chartism,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XXIX, 180.</note> You know my Mothers way&#x2014;she will give you every thing on earth except the thing you <hi rend="italic">want</hi>&#x2014;will do anything for you except what you <hi rend="italic">ask</hi> her to do. As for new milk you may have it in any quantity&#x2014;but then <hi rend="small-caps">only</hi> <hi rend="italic">immediately before</hi> your breakfast or immediately <hi rend="italic">after</hi> your tea; and the proposed sip of brandy in it&#x2014;without which I incline to believe it unwholesome&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">that</hi> is offered, is pressed upon you to your pudding, your water, plain, diluted, cold, and hot&#x2014;but to your milk (since the thing was mentioned,) it is impossible to have it without a sacrifice of one&#x2019;s modesty too cruel for so trifling a gain! All these things are against me! as I indeed anticipated they would be. and my greatest consolation is, that you are not also <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;in the midst of them!</hi>&#x201D;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;L<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Jeffrey, to Her, in the grand &#x2018;Reform&#x2019; time&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note).</note> You could not have lived here two weeks on the present principle (in spite of all your passionate longings for the country) and I see not how the present principle could have been altered without our all having been <pb id="pg-09-30" n="09:30"/>born anew. It is wonderful that one should vex and frighten oneself so much in anticipation of serious evils, when it is all the <hi rend="italic">little things</hi> of life which in reality make up our happiness or misery. One more fact let me mention having come off without any sufficient shoes, and the roads here being more like <foreign>kennels</foreign> [street gutters] than roads; I bought a pair&#x2014;not made in Northampton&#x2014;a shilling dearer than the best in London&#x2014;easy as possible to slide the foot into, and already they have lamed me, both heels and toes, to such an extent as I shall not soon recover from. Consider all this, dearest of friends, and imagine much more that I could tell you of the same sort, and infer from it if you be wise, that the thought you are apt to dwell on too exclusively: that &#x201C;God made the country and man the town&#x201D;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cowper, <hi rend="italic">The Task</hi>, I, 749.</note> is to be taken with large reservations; is indeed to be <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;strongly doubted&#x201D;</hi><note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Scotchman&#x2019;s phrase in an <hi rend="italic">Edgeworth</hi> Novel in frequent, or over-frequent, use by B<hi rend="italic">r</hi> John&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note).</note> You may depend upon it Sir, Man and even the Devil have had a very considerable hand in making the country also.</p>
<p>The most providential looking thing which has happened to me since I came here, was the other day, about an hour after the receipt of your letter, that a boy came to the kitchen door, offering for sale&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">two scrubs!!</hi><note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;The neat, effective and frugal enough Scotch &#x2018;scrub&#x2019; is a little trim sheaflet of <foreign><hi rend="italic">ling</hi></foreign>, tied firmly by a bit of split willow&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note).</note> Judge if I did not purchase them on the spot!&#x2014;scrubs so manifestly <hi rend="italic">destined</hi> for me and for no other&#x2014; They cost twopence and I hope soon to see them in brisk action at Chelsea&#x2014;in the mean while it will be something to keep Ann in heart.<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-09/lt-18360724-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1836-07-24">24 July</date></ref>.</note> Give her my compliments and say I am glad to hear she is doing well, and that I will not fail to rum<supplied>[m]</supplied>age out <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;<foreign>wee</foreign> Jen&#x201D;</hi><note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Ann Cook&#x2019;s &#x2018;misfortune&#x2019; belike,&#x2014;whose incipiency of speech had almost a &#x2018;French&#x2019; charact<hi rend="italic">r</hi> to stupid Ann?&#x2014;&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note). <foreign>Wee</foreign> Jen lived with Ann Cook&#x2019;s mother.</note> when I go to Annan, and will <hi rend="italic">speak french</hi> to her if need be.

One day, at breakfast-time, she was found sitting by the unlighted half-scoured grate,&#x2014;sunk overhead in <hi rend="italic">Goethe&#x2019;s Wilhm Meister</hi>, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> she had found lying ab<hi rend="italic">t!</hi> A fact strange and even touching in the poor soul.

<p>M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Crichton has been absent at Aberdeen but is returned I believe, and I think of going to ma<supplied>[ke]</supplied> a few days visit to her.

Let me know when John is to set out&#x2014; I do not know how I shall return&#x2014;by earth, air, or sea; if any cheap and safe conveyance offered, I should certainly try the air this time&#x2014;for the other two ways I have proved to be equally detestable&#x2014;and killing.</p>

I left London without any pattern calculating on getting one of those you forgot at Scotsbrig&#x2014;but now in your Mothers absence it is highly probable they may not be able to lay hands on it.&#x2014; do you therefore, take a penful of ink and, laying a collar on your next sheet, ere you begin to write, go round the edge of one half of it with a black line.</p>
<p>Poor John Sterling is gone<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;To Bourd<hi rend="italic">x</hi>, the very day this reached me&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note). John Sterling had written to Jane on <date when="1836-07-23">23 July</date> of his imminent departure for Bordeaux, the possibility of wintering in Madeira, and how he imagined it would be, a visit he had made to Knole House shortly after Jane&#x2019;s departure, and meetings with Carlyle, Mill, and Taylor.</note> I suppose&#x2014; He wrote me a long letter, with evident effort&#x2014;speaking of his future in a tone of sad gaiety or gay sadness, I know not which to call it; but it was grating to my feelings. I do not expect we shall ever see him again and we shall certainly never see a better man.&#x2014; Poor Mill! he really seems to have <pb id="pg-09-32" n="09:32"/><hi rend="italic">&#x201C;loved and lived&#x201D;</hi><note n="15" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf.

<salute><foreign><hi rend="italic">Du armes Kind</hi></foreign> [You poor child]!</salute>
<p>The Letter, which I opened with eagerness enough, made me altogether <foreign><hi rend="italic">wae</hi></foreign> [sad]. No rest for the poor wearied one; in her Mother&#x2019;s house too, she must wake &#x201C;at four in the morning,&#x201D; and have frettings and annoyances! It is very hard: the world is so wide; and for my poor Jean there is no place where she can find shelter in it. Patience, my poor Lassie; it is not so bad as that; it shall <hi rend="italic">not</hi> be so bad.</p>
<p>Since there is no good to be done in Scotland, what remains but that you came back hither with such dispatch as suits? We have bad <pb id="pg-09-33" n="09:33"/>weather; but not so bad probably as the Templand weather: there is quietude here, there is <hi rend="italic">liberty;</hi> you shall have <hi rend="italic">bread</hi> to eat: we can even procure you a little <hi rend="italic">milk</hi> (for the man comes <hi rend="italic">yowling</hi> regularly at the stroke of seven), and a drop of brandy in <hi rend="italic">it</hi> shall not be wanting. I wish to Heaven I were better, cheerfuller; but I take Heaven to witness I will be as cheerful as I can; I will do what is in me, and swim with myself and thee. I do not think the waves <hi rend="italic">can</hi> swallow us: open thy heart out again to me; have hope, courage (softness, not bitterness and hardness), and they shall not swallow us! In any case, what refuge is there but here? Here is the place for my poor Goody; let us sink or swim together.</p>
<p>If I did not know how little advice could profit in such matters, how it even exasperates, and makes the case worse, I would pray earnestly, in the meanwhile, for that very thing which we often laugh at in poor Jack: meekness, submission to the will of Heaven. Open thy eyes from these Templand windows: the Earth is green, jewelled with many a flower; the sky arches itself, also <hi rend="italic">beautiful</hi>, overhead: it is not, in the name of God, a place of bitter hopelessness for any living creature, but it is emphatically the Place of <hi rend="italic">Hope</hi> for all! O that &#x201C;Edinburgh style of mockery&#x201D;!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> Me too, with its hard withering influences, its momentary solacement fataller than any pain, it had well-nigh conducted to Hades and Tophet; but I flung it off, and am alive. O that my poor much-suffering Jane had done so too; flung it off from the very heart, forever; and, in soft devoutness of submission (wherein lies what the man calls the &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">divine depth</hi> of Sorrow&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-06/lt-18320216-TC-JAC-01"><sic>6:123</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1832-02-16">16 Feb. 1832</date></corr></ref>.</note>), had recognised once that the Stern Necessity was also the Just; that the Thing stronger than we was also the Thing Better, Wiser!&#x2014; But I will preach no more. I will pray and wish rather, in my heart of hearts. Nay I will prophecy too: for nothing shall ever make me believe that a soul so <hi rend="italic">true</hi>, and full of <hi rend="italic">good</hi> things, can continue strangling itself in that manner, sore, sore tho&#x2019; its perplexities may be. O my poor <foreign>Lassie</foreign>, what a life thou hast had: and I could not make it other; it was to be <hi rend="italic">that</hi> and not another!&#x2014; And so, &#x201C;after all&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >From John&#x2019;s phrase &#x201C;Poor fellow, after all!&#x201D;</note> then, what is to be done; but come back again by easy stages, and <hi rend="small-caps">do</hi> <hi rend="italic">the best we can?</hi><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-07/lt-18341224-TC-WG-01"><sic>7:350&#x2013;51</sic><corr>TC to WG, <date when="1834-12-24">14 Dec. 1834</date></corr></ref>.</note> This visit to Scotland will not have been in vain; it exhausts one other possibility, it renders one quieter. Nay, in spite of all these splashings of rain, weary waitings for some one rising, these annoyances and disappointments, <pb id="pg-09-34" n="09:34"/>I believe the very change of scene, of habitual speech and course of thought, will be of salutary influence. The din of London is stilled in you by this time; the mind will be fresh to take it up again, and find it more harmonious than it was.</p>
<p>I know not well what I am writing. It is towards 2&#x2019; o&#x2019;clock, and I had done a kind of <hi rend="italic">task</hi> before commencing; besides (as the Newspaper announced!) I had senna two days ago, and you know what that is!&#x2014; One thing however I must write: the other day, I noticed in some corner two pieces of spermaceti candles, or perhaps they were whole spermaceti candles;&#x2014;the sight of which had literally almost made me <foreign>greet</foreign>! Poor <hi rend="italic">craitur</hi>, she had tried then to make a small shine of Elegance, a kind of decorative sumptuosity on <hi rend="italic">this</hi> small scale! It was the old feeling of the Tin Mull bought long ago in the West Bow.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For the tin mull, see <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310914-TC-JWC-01"><sic>5:430</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1831-09-14">14 Sept. 1831</date></corr></ref>. For a later incident when Jane objected to Mrs Welsh&#x2019;s attempting some elegance with spermaceti candles, candles of superior quality, on her visit in <date when="1839-00-00">early 1839</date>, see <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi>, intro. I. Campbell, pp. 79 and 167&#x2013;68.</note> There is to me a meaning in these fragments of Poverty, such as no Pitt Diamond<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-05/lt-18290331-TC-HI-01"><sic>5:13</sic><corr>TC to HI, <date when="1829-03-31">31 March 1829</date></corr></ref>.</note> could purchase; Poverty appears holy to me, richer than all Riches. It is one of the compensations. O thou rebellious creature, dost thou not remember the Tin Mull?&#x2014;Be of heart and hope, I tell thee; and we will triumph yet over all things.&#x2014;</p>
<p>As to the method of journeying back, I can give no advice that is worth aught. The expense I suppose by Edinburgh or by Liverpool is about alike. If the weather were moderate, Edinburgh would offer advantages: but it is a blustery, blowing kind of season; and tho&#x2019; not absolutely dangerous, sailing is much more unpleasant in these circumstances. You will see what kind of weather it is. Consider, and determine. Announce punctually the ship or thing you come in, and I will be in waiting. I <hi rend="italic">alone</hi>, most probably: Jack learns yesterday that he is to go on the <date when="1836-08-18">18<hi rend="italic">th</hi></date> after all; that is, on Thursday come a week. I cannot regret it greatly; and yet I am very sad and sorry about it. In fact if &#x201C;good spirits&#x201D; be an offence (thou wretched Goody!) my spirits, internally, are not a whit too good.</p>
<p>Neither have I forgotten the Collar: but what is the use of sending it now? Perhaps I may trace the outline on the back of the <hi rend="italic">inclosed</hi> Note; tho&#x2019; when I tried yesterday, it was too small for the <hi rend="italic">present</hi> Pattern. But the present Pattern is perhaps at bottom really none of the best; its merit so far as I know is really the invention <hi rend="italic">we</hi> two superadded to it: a smaller size were decidely better;&#x2014;which <pb id="pg-09-35" n="09:35"/>perhaps the back of the Note may <hi rend="italic">hold</hi>.&#x2014; But guess from whom comes the Note? From the reverend Terrot!<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charles H. Terrot; see <ref target="volume-02/lt-18220525-JBW-TC-01"><sic>2:114</sic><corr>JBW to TC, <date when="1822-05-25">25 May 1822</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-06/lt-18320808-TC-SAI-01">TC to <sic>SA</sic><corr>SAI</corr>, <date when="1832-08-08">8 Aug. 1832</date></ref> [letters placed unchronologically].</note> I answered it directly; asking him to <hi rend="italic">tea</hi> for next night, or for next again if he liked it better: <hi rend="italic">next</hi> night he did not come; but next <hi rend="italic">day</hi> again (that is yesterday) he and Mr Wilson<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Wilson.</note> called, with strong solicitation that John and I would go dine; Terrot <hi rend="italic">otherwise</hi> held himself obliged to come &#x26;c &#x26;c: in fine, I consented to go this night, and Jack, not within at the moment, has ratified it; and so we wait hungry, and will go at half past six, and have an indigestion. I remembered afterwards that Rosen<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-08/lt-18360625-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, [<date when="1836-06-25">25 June</date>]</ref>.</note> (whom we had called on) was to come down that very night; but I, by a paid threepenny, have sent him an excuse.&#x2014; Terrot looked very well; unaltered except that I think his <hi rend="italic">whiskers</hi> are getting grey: he talked in his clear limited-healthy, honest sort of way about schoolmasters, Jamie Simpson,<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18211117-TC-JCE-01"><sic>1:396</sic><corr>TC to JCE, <date when="1821-11-17">17 Nov. 1821</date></corr></ref>.</note> and &#x201C;his horse and the <hi rend="italic">worl</hi>,&#x201D; very agreeably, for three quarters of an hour; then left many regards for you, and went his way. A sort of hope to meet you in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> still abides with him: but he did not give me <hi rend="italic">times;</hi> it must be left to chance, and should, which perhaps will guide it well.</p>
<p>Other threepenny I think I have not had, except a long Editorial rigmarole from Mill (very conciliatory and of no moment at all) prior to his departure, and a <hi rend="italic">scratch</hi> from Cavaignac, writing that he did not write, and could not for the <foreign><hi rend="italic">mort funeste</hi></foreign> [tragic death] <foreign><hi rend="italic">de</hi></foreign> <hi rend="italic">Carrel;</hi> tho&#x2019; I had asked him some questions about the National Convention.<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >His father, Jean Baptiste Cavaignac (<date when="1763-00-00">1763</date>&#x2013;<date when="1829-00-00">1829</date>), had been a member of the Convention, had voted for Louis XVI&#x2019;s death and had told Cavaignac of those years when he lived in exile in Brussels.

Though Carrel was assumed to have been defending the old style political press against the new vulgar journalism of <hi rend="italic">La Presse</hi>, in fact his challenge to Girardin was against the threat of information being published on his life with Madame &#xc9;milie Boudhors.

Another night (it was Wednesday last) I made a fierce effort, and got to Cecil Street: the Doctor would not go, but turned off before Charing Cross. The Cavaignacs were sitting in darkness; C. had to meet a Party at his own lodgings in few minutes; there was a <foreign>Monsieur</foreign>&#x2014;(Unknown) who also went very shortly; so I was left with <foreign>Mesdames</foreign>! We talked and talked; like Babel! The old Madame really seems to me a most cheery, shifty, indomitable little body;&#x2014;as like <hi rend="italic">you</hi> as I to Hercules. The <foreign>D&#xE9;moiselle</foreign> [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] fills me with pity. I think she must have had some hurt to her <hi rend="italic">mind</hi>. Palpitations, palpitations; a <foreign><hi rend="italic">soeur toujours souffrante</hi></foreign> [sister always suffering]! She has a great deal of intelligence, of spirit, vehemence, affection: in speaking, her rude face with its large blue eyes gets almost beautiful, her voice is clear musical; and she coughs (<foreign><hi rend="italic">toux nerveux</hi></foreign> [nervous cough]), and cannot sleep, and cannot &#x26;c; and looks as if she could not live. I sat with them till 10 o&#x2019;clock; asked them to come to Chelsea some night (as I had done by Note to C. before), but hope they will not <hi rend="italic">be able</hi> till you come.&#x2014; By the bye, the little Mephistopheles of a Tuner came on that same Wednesday; uncovered the Piano, put a new string in it (even employed <hi rend="italic">me</hi> and my mechanical skill or he would have stuck), went <foreign>fettling</foreign> [mending] and <foreign><hi rend="italic">thrimbling</hi></foreign> [grasping and groping] over it and over it for about an hour; made it sound sweet as the Nine Muses, and then charged me 3/6, which I paid. Speaking is catching with these people! However I think the Mephisto actually did it well. I will have floods of sound out of it when you return. Not a soul has struck it since you went. Indeed hardly a soul has been here: we see nobody and do not want to see any body.</p>
<p>John Mill went this day week; Mrs Taylor had gone before (a few days); Mill&#x2019;s two little Brothers will be very suitable: people have <hi rend="italic">ways</hi> of doing,&#x2014;which I do not judge of. Mill was full of desire to <pb id="pg-09-37" n="09:37"/>&#x201C;hear from me&#x201D; &#x26;c: poor fellow! John and I (rushing over that quarter of the Town for exercise &#x26;c) saw him the day before. I shall be idler than now if I write to &#x201C;Geneva <foreign><hi rend="italic">poste restante</hi></foreign>&#x201D; without something to say. Mill looked somewhat better that day. Pray Heaven he may get a little better by the journey. My feelings towards him are of a grateful sort altogether: but an Abstraction, how can one love it much, except against the grain?</p>
<p>The Sterling family departed that same day: I mean John&#x2019;s; John himself was detained by some miserable tagrag of business (I think about Lawsuits and those West India matters<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly connected with Hester Sterling&#x2019;s uncle&#x2019;s estate on St. Vincent which had been left to John and Anthony Sterling and a cousin about <date when="1831-00-00">1831</date> &#x201C;not without some intricacies, and almost caprices, in the conditions attached&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XI, 76).</note>); but he got it all settled amicably, and flew off by Coach on the monday morning. The <foreign>Stimabile</foreign> would needs accompany him, tho&#x2019; by another coach, by another route. Mrs S. had heard (the other day) that they were all got to Plymouth, and about to sail. We saw poor John the Sunday before he went: his air was &#x201C;sad-gay&#x201D;; he sent many compliments to you, &#x201C;in case he should not have time to write fully for a while.&#x201D; Some nights before that we were at his house, Miss &#x26; Mr Wilson, Morris [F. D. Maurice], Farish;<note n="15" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably James Farish (<date when="1803-00-00">1803</date>&#x2013;<date when="1853-00-00">53</date>) admitted to Trinity, Cambridge, <date when="1820-00-00">1820</date>, B.A. <date when="1825-00-00">1825</date>, M.B. <date when="1828-00-00">1828</date>, therefore overlapping with Sterling in <date when="1824-00-00">1824</date>&#x2013;<date when="1827-00-00">27</date> at Trinity. He became a fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons and &#x201C;was distinguished at once by his skill and his active benevolence&#x201D; (obituary, <hi rend="italic">Gentleman&#x2019;s Magazine</hi>, <date when="1853-00-00">1853</date>, I, 451). The son of William Farish (<date when="1759-00-00">1759</date>&#x2013;<date when="1837-00-00">1837</date>), professor of chemistry and of natural and experimental philosophy at Cambridge, his three brothers, Henry (<date when="1799-00-00">1799</date>&#x2013;<date when="1856-00-00">1856</date>), William Milner (<date when="1803-00-00">1803</date>&#x2013;<date when="1863-00-00">63</date>), and George (<date when="1809-00-00">1809</date>&#x2013;<date when="1836-00-00">36</date>), who attended Queens and Corpus Christi, seem less likely; George could have been in London studying law at this time, though he died in Madeira on <date when="1836-11-01">1 Nov.</date></note> and great talk; the next night, I called again; the whole house was sprawling with disorganised trunks &#x26;c, and I soon came away: he offered me a stick, &#x201C;to knock off the dogs,&#x201D; with a melancholy sudden movement when we were parting; I took the stick, and keep it. A beautiful Print of Albert Durer&#x2019;s,<note n="16" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A. Carlyle notes that this is &#x201C;Christ bearing the Cross,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">NL</hi>, I, 30; Mrs. Allingham notes two other D&#xfc;rer prints, &#x201C;Melancholia&#x201D; and &#x201C;Frederick the Wise,&#x201D; also hanging in the first floor drawing room, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle&#x2019;s House Catalogue</hi>, p. 105.</note> which he had heard me admiring, came down the day after he was gone; beautifully framed, and hangs now on the wall. Poor fellow!&#x2014; It seems not unlikely that he will be back here in a month, to go to Madeira, after all.&#x2014; Whither the old <foreign>Stimables</foreign> go I know not; perhaps nowhither. Mrs S. had a Twopenny from you<note n="17" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> one day, she <pb id="pg-09-38" n="09:38"/>said: it was before my Letter came, and I could have liked to see it, but she did not offer. It said &#x201C;that you were little or no better.&#x201D;</p>
<p>One day I did call at the degli Antoni&#x2019;s: she was gone to the country a week ago; I left a card: the name of the place she was gone to I did not catch; she was to return soon; whether for a time, or for the winter, or how, did not appear. No Pepoli: I wish he may not be ill somehow yet. Hapless Novelli<note n="18" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Beatrice Novelli.</note> comes still; she was here since I began writing. Bitter now is her repentance that she did not take <hi rend="italic">L&#xE8;die Frankelin&#x2019;s</hi> offer; but it is too late! John will speak to Lady Clare about her on Monday. The Brighton Boarding school business has gone all to smoke;&#x2014;as all these things do with her. Miss Fergus writes to me this morning; announcing a Box of Clothes for her by Steamboat; sends the Project of a new Advertisement: I augur nothing from that. The hapless Beatrice seems bewept, is <foreign><hi rend="italic">lutta ammalata</hi></foreign> [struggling sick person]; I pity her heartily, but her imbecillity and my own hurry and necessity agree ill. If Jack can do nothing, I see not what is to become of her.&#x2014; Garnier came one night: but it was the night I had gone up to <hi rend="italic">his</hi> street to the Cavaignacs&#x2019;.&#x2014; This, I think, is a most handsome allotment of News for you. Considering that &#x201C;the Town is quite empty&#x201D;;&#x2014;glory to Heaven for it, ones bones are not endangered by the quality coaches! September and October, except that they are always <foreign><hi rend="italic">wae</hi></foreign> months to me, are the two pleasantest months as to weather, and other externals, that London has.</p>
<p>I said I had <hi rend="italic">begun</hi> again; but I have yet <hi rend="italic">written</hi> nothing. I am tumbling and rummaging; taking notes; making the <hi rend="italic">whole</hi> thing plain to myself to the very end of it: I shall very probably write nothing other than notes till after Jack be gone. Nothing comes on the paper: yet it is not idleness, it is not work unproductive. Jack reads all morning; then dashes out. He lectures me still on submission &#x26;c, which (on <hi rend="italic">senna</hi> days) I have enough ado to bear. His love for me is great: but he knows not the meaning of <hi rend="italic">Silence</hi>. His own cheer poor fellow is far from the best; as is but natural: he too sees no aim that were adequate in life; is sceptical as to Medicine; has a great intelligence and faculty obscured by trivial faults<supplied>[;]</supplied> finds not what he is to <hi rend="italic">do</hi>. He has been to see Liston, and his Hospital;<note n="19" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Liston had been a surgeon at the new hospital attached to London University since <date when="1834-00-00">1834</date>.</note> likes him and it; is out again today on some similar expedition.</p>
<p>Sorrow on thee, thou little Gypsy! the time is fled. Why did I write so <hi rend="italic">much?</hi> It will now hardly be within my power to get up to Buller&#x2019;s <pb id="pg-09-39" n="09:39"/>and back in time to dress, let me do as I may. So many Novellis and fiddle-faddlings and interruptions!</p>
<p>Send me a Newspaper whenever this comes. Then a Letter, what you are to do, how you sleep &#x26;c what you found in Annandale. Would a day or two of bathing there do nothing? <foreign><hi rend="italic">Gehab dich wohl</hi></foreign> [Good go with you]! Be peaceable my poor wearied shattered <foreign><hi rend="italic">Bairn;</hi></foreign> harden not thy heart, but soften it; open it to Hope and me!&#x2014; Say all that is kind to your mother from me (Forgive her &#x201C;ways of doing&#x201D;: they are her ways; tho&#x2019; very tormenting).&#x2014; It is half past 4, and I am still in my dressing-gown.

<ps><p><hi rend="italic">Sunday morning</hi>.&#x2014; Yesterday afternoon having finished in the hasty manner you see, I had sealed too, and dressed myself, and was as far as the Butcher&#x2019;s door on my way to Buller&#x2019;s. A look at the watch, and a moment of candid consideration convinced me that the enterprise was bad. To go and return in time I must walk above 4 miles an hour; and then after all, should I find Buller at home, should I find him even in town? I turned back, like a wise man; rummaged out an old Newspaper (which the poor Goody gets on Monday): this morning I burst the seal, and write a word or two more on the new cover; the more the welcomer.</p>
<p>A thing I had forgot was to say that Austin has been appointed Legislator Lycurgus<note n="20" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Traditionally Lycurgus was a founder of the Spartan Constitution (ca. <date>ninth century <hi rend="small-caps">b.c.</hi></date>).</note> (Commissioner they call it, to overhaul what is doing in the Law way) at Malta;<note n="21" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Austin and Sir George Cornewall Lewis (<date when="1806-00-00">1806</date>&#x2013;<date when="1863-00-00">63</date>) were to be appointed joint commissioners on the administration and government of Malta on <date when="1836-09-10">10 Sept.</date> Their report is contained in <hi rend="italic">Parliamentary Papers</hi>, <date when="1837-00-00">1837</date>&#x2013;<date when="1838-00-00">38</date>, XXIX, and <date when="1839-00-00">1839</date>, XVII.</note> where upon Mrs Austin I believe is gone to Boulogne to pack up. I have not seen her or him, or wished to see them. John &#x26; I left cards one day. The appointment ought to cure poor Austin, but will not: a twanging, iracund, incompatible painful man,&#x2014;whom it requires a great effort to love. Theory wishes well to him; but Theory and Practice join to wish that you personally might be as little troubled with him as possible. As to the <hi rend="italic"><foreign>femme alors cel&#xE8;bre&#x2014;ach Gott</foreign></hi> [well-known woman&#x2014;oh God]!&#x2014;&#x2014; &#x2014; Another thing I will mention is the providential mercy as to my watch. The other day walking up towards Hyde Park, I pulled out the poor watch, and, <pb id="pg-09-40" n="09:40"/>finding the time quite spent, whirled round again with <supplied>[celer]</supplied>ity, sticking <hi rend="italic">in</hi> the watch (it was into the old brown breeches, not in the firmest state now): I had not <supplied>[taken two]</supplied> strides homewards when something announced itself running down my leg, hitting on the roof of my foot, jingling out upon the flagstones,&#x2014;a watch and the case of a watch, jingling along to two yards&#x2019; distance before me; to the admiration of men! Not a particle of ill was done; the roof of the foot and miraculous pre arrangements had saved all. Who will say that luck has deserted us!</p>
<p>But how went the dinner yesterday? The dinner, my dear <foreign>Bairn</foreign>, went pretty well. It was temperate and elegant; I most abstemious, and find today that I have got less mischief than usual. Morris [Maurice] arrived here about six by water, being also invited; the simple Brother Wilson: this with us and Terrot was the party. Morris wore his usual and more than his usual look of tremulence and terror; did or said nothing notable: Terrot took wine with him (being straitened I think a little in that point); but they could not communicate in any other thing. It was very curious to see healthy, cheerfully-composed lucidity and limitation looking over upon panting palpitating wiredrawnness and hysterical genius or quasi-genius<supplied>[.]</supplied> &#x201C;Pray-y, is he&#x201D; (Ritchie a man we were speaking of) &#x201C;the son of the reverend&#x2014;Ritchie of Glasgow?&#x201D;<note n="22" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> asked Morris, as if for God&#x2019;s sake. &#x201C;No,&#x201D; answered Terrot, in the stillest tone; &#x201C;he <supplied>[is]</supplied> the son of a Fishwife,&#x2014;as they say.&#x201D; Our company was too polite to yield the smallest vestige of smile.&#x2014; Terrot and I sat together and had much talk and snuff; he is to be here till the &#x201C;end of the month nearly,&#x201D; and still hopes to meet you some way.&#x2014; But alas dear Goody I <supplied>[am]</supplied> over the leaf! O my poor <foreign>Bairn</foreign>, I would I knew how thou went today! Here we have sunny weather, but not oppressively hot (wind, indeed, is in the East); the Garden has a few goose berries (not for thee, I fear); the grapes are beginning to swell; the sparrows eat <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the cherries; all that I know of but some three. Jack moves that there be walking this day and no study. Is it right?&#x2014;&#x2014; The Household goes on well enough in all ways; about the old <hi rend="italic">rate</hi>, I think: but I am very weary of holding the bag. Anne too seems very anxious to see you again. She is really not a bad servant, the poor slut, at this time; possessed of a contentment great and enviable. I am very attentive to <hi rend="italic">Chico;</hi> whom I hear singing at this moment down in the kitchen. The Kitten and he and Anne are the happiest creatures in this street.&#x2014; O what babble, <pb id="pg-09-41" n="09:41"/>my own <foreign>Lassie</foreign>! But I write as the pen runs: plenty of it, at any rate! They all sent many compliments &#x26;c &#x26;c last night; not even Miss Wilson forgot, tho&#x2019; I did not catch rightly the figure of her message: only &#x201C;hope&#x201D; &#x201C;health&#x201D; &#x201C;return&#x201D; and some such words: compliments enough from other quarters I have forgotten.&#x2014; Now when to write? Too soon is impossible. What to do? Whatsoever on sober calculation seems best. By Earth or by water: Air is impossible. Bless thee ever my little Jeannie! I do send the pattern collar having room for it.<note n="23" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Drawn over the text in pencil on the second last page.

<p><salute><foreign><hi rend="italic">Meine Liebe</hi></foreign> [My Dear],&#x2014;</salute> This sheet lies out on the table, seemingly <hi rend="italic">soliciting</hi> to be written, for the sake of the poor Goody; and tho&#x2019; I had, on second thoughts, determined to put it off till tomorrow, I cannot find in my heart to do that; but <hi rend="italic">will</hi> fling all aside, and proceed. The Revolution &#x201C;task&#x201D; (for you must know I am writing again) was doing little good at any rate,&#x2014;the nerves and head all out of sorts today: poor Goody will perhaps set me up better than the Book would; let her take me therefore, with a blessing. The Parliament being dissolved (prorogued, I believe) there are no franks; hence this <hi rend="italic">small</hi> writing, which I love not: Jack said, on Saturday: &#x201C;Here is a ticket Lady Clare has sent me; will you not go and see the King prorogue Parliament?&#x201D;&#x2014; &#x201C;Sir&#x201D; I answered, &#x201C;if he were going to blow up Parliament with gunpowder I would hardly go,&#x2014;being busy elsewhere.&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Parliament was prorogued in the House of Lords on <date when="1836-08-20">Sat., 20 Aug.</date>, until <date when="1836-10-20">20 Oct.</date> by William IV. According to the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, <date when="1836-08-22">22 Aug.</date>, &#x201C;the muster of female beauty and fashion was more than ordinarily numerous. The attendance of Peers was rather scanty. &#x2026; The body of the house presented a very animated and interesting scene.&#x201D;</note> To Jack&#x2019;s great affliction! However, let me mention that they have done one good thing: taken off the <hi rend="italic">penny</hi> we used to pay for our Newspapers, in these Threepenny-post districts; a big &#x201C;G.P.&#x201D; stamped <pb id="pg-09-42" n="09:42"/>on the outside comes now, and no penny to pay. Also you can put your Newspaper into the office <hi rend="italic">here</hi> without charge, and need not go to Sloane Street. I have already saved five pence by it, and two journies.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >These provisions were included in a bill &#x201C;to consolidate and amend the Laws relating to the Conveyance of Newspapers by the Post,&#x201D; <date when="1836-07-18">18 July</date> (see <hi rend="italic">Parliamentary Papers</hi>, <date when="1836-00-00">1836</date>, IV, 679).</note> It is the main advantage this Legislative Session, or indeed I think the whole Reform-Parliamentary New Era has yet produced for me. Note this; and encourage our Friends to send us old Papers, with two strokes on them: writing on them is not so safe.</p>
<p>What a miserable posture that at Annan, and on the crown of Annan Hill; which I could so well fancy! Poor Mary with her basket; poor Goody left alone, in that <foreign><hi rend="italic">fremd</hi></foreign> [strange] yellow Inn.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Described in a lost letter.</note> The Newspaper next day brought an <foreign><hi rend="italic">Ho dormito</hi></foreign> [sleep] and <foreign><hi rend="italic">meglio</hi></foreign> [better]; but I still knew it was far from well: a mere <hi rend="italic">repentance</hi> principally at having sent bad news the day before. Never lament such things, poor Goody: in suffering, to whom wilt thou complain if not to me? Till friday night, when I could fancy you safe home at Templand again, in a house without children or noise, my imagination had no rest. Lie still, thou poor wearied one; stir not till the hour come for travelling hither again! After all, I calculate the journey will not prove useless: a healthy influence lies in the very change of ideas and objects, such a total change as that; seated by one&#x2019;s own hearth again, much that was a <hi rend="italic">burble</hi> will begin to unravel itself. There are better days coming: I say it always, and swear it, with a kind of indestructible faith! But we must be ready for the bad, for the worse; and meet them not in bitter violence, but in courageous genial humour, as <hi rend="italic">quiet</hi> at least as may be. Poor Alick would be very <foreign>wae</foreign> and glad to see you: everybody has his battle here below. My Mother ought to be home by this time? But we have got no news.</p>
<p>The grand question now however is, when are you coming, and how? We have frightful Lammas Floods here just now, with rough North wind, which must be <foreign><hi rend="italic">gurly</hi></foreign> [squally] at sea. Were it not for that, or were that over, perhaps Edinburgh would be best for you? Your Mother would see you so far; or perhaps she will venture all the way, and try us again, at another season of the year: we are better thro&#x2019; winter than dark Nithsdale is! Once in the steamboat, you have nothing more to fret you; the sickness is sickness, but it is one thing, not a thousand things. Yet this is only my own feeling I am translating into your person: perhaps the infernal belly of the <pb id="pg-09-43" n="09:43"/><hi rend="italic">Umpire</hi><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Coach.</note> all the way from Liverpool does not make you shudder as it does me. Do what seems <hi rend="italic">easiest</hi> to do. The expense, which even we ought not to regard in this case much, is about the same both ways. The only thing I do decide is that if you come by Liverpool Coach, it must be by the Mail: the Mail goes many hours faster than that cursed Lumber (always full of Irish too); and on the last day every hour is like a century. Perhaps Manchester&#x2014;? No; Jenny will not be there. Or perhaps you could stop all night at Birmingham? Why not do that?&#x2014; I wish it were all over; and the poor Goody jumping out to me again.&#x2014;</p>
<p>We do well enough here; Ann behaving herself I think very handsomely, with great goodnature and goodhumour; nor I think does she cheat or pilfer, or otherwise go astray: but I am daily wearier of <hi rend="italic">holding the bag</hi>.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Proverbial: being responsible.</note> &#x201C;What wull a&#x2019; get to denner?&#x201D; Oh, steak, or chop, both, or anything under the sun! For the rest, we have very eatable potatoes; good tea and coffee (I <hi rend="italic">wrote</hi> again by Twopenny to Twinings,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >R. G. J. A. and R. Twining, tea merchants, 216 Strand, founded <date when="1710-00-00">1710</date>.</note> a second order, and they came the <hi rend="italic">same day,</hi>&#x2014;our prosperous and other Grocers proving <hi rend="italic">naught</hi>): the Lamp also is set up mostly now at night;&#x2014;and it is a still, smooth-gliding poor-man&#x2019;s-house as the circumstances admit. If a Goody were well, and a Good,&#x2014;<foreign><hi rend="italic">ach Gott</hi></foreign> [Oh God] why could not one be happy enough, in spite of twenty Poverties! Patience, <foreign>Lassie</foreign>; let us take it quietly: this Book will be done; I shall rest, be better, all will be better. Consider this fact too, which really has a truth in it, &#x201C;Great sorrow never <hi rend="italic">lasts&#x201D;;</hi><note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Samuel Johnson, <hi rend="italic">Rasselas</hi>, chap. XXXV: &#x201C;Sorrow is never long without a dawn of ease.&#x201D;</note> it is like a stream stemmed, <hi rend="italic">must</hi> begin flowing again&#x2014;there is really, I say, a truth in that, grounded in the nature of things. O my poor <foreign>Bairn</foreign>, be not faithless but believing! Do not fling life away as insupportable despicable; and let us work it out and rest it out together, like a true Two, tho&#x2019; under sore obstructions.<hi rend="italic">Fools</hi>, in all circumstances short of Tophet, nay probably in Tophet itself, have one way of doing; <hi rend="italic">wise</hi> have a different, infinitely better. I say <hi rend="italic">infinitely</hi>, for that also is a fact. And so God direct us, and help us; God send thee soon and safe back again; and here ends my Sermon.&#x2014; Poor Jack sits daily in expectation of being summoned to march for Dover: very probably on friday or saturday, tho&#x2019; he knows not yet what day. Her Ladyship has the ordering of the days and the weeks; summons you out of <pb id="pg-09-44" n="09:44"/>Scotland a fortnight sooner, then keeps you a week longer, &#x26;c &#x26;c: such is the power of cash in this world. Jack himself has ten times my patience with it; but he too, as he waits daily and cannot go out till Postie comes or passes, begins to grow impatient with it. He has been lecturing me, as his wont was, talking of &#x201C;false positions taken up,&#x201D; and so forth; but his <hi rend="italic">mildness</hi> now that we are to part again makes me very <foreign><hi rend="italic">wae</hi></foreign><hi rend="italic">:</hi> I find I shall feel as if utterly left alone when he goes. He has got a large Brass-plate &#x201C;Dr Carlyle,&#x201D;&#x2014;to be set up finally in the City of Rome! His Life too is overshadowed, obstructed; a great mass of Talent lies painfully imprisoned there, struggling out in all manner of whimsicalities and littlenesses, offensive and self-offensive. Let us pity the poor white man,<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-03/lt-18251019-TC-JBW-01"><sic>3:390</sic><corr>TC to JBW, <date when="1825-10-19">19 Oct. 1825</date></corr></ref>.</note> and hope always better of him. This day he had a Letter from Fraser<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Fraser.</note> in Munich: they are <hi rend="italic">not</hi> going to Rome, Cholera is in the way; but Mrs F. is going to Scotland and her Brother&#x2019;s at Stirling or near it; F. himself wandering without rest to the sole of his foot! He earnestly asks whither John is going, that he also may go thither. A poor aimless man; his wife a poor aimless woman, I gather; who demands society, excitement, on the whole happiness, and cannot find it.</p>
<p>Did I tell you that Ann had scoured my dressing-gown, taking off the collar; and made <supplied>[it]</supplied> as brisk as new? I have it on this day; and am removed up stairs, the heat being gone, above a week ago. I took to writing, a new delay of a week having come on Jack: I have got King Louis (the rough draught of him) condemned, not yet guillotined; but shall have him all finished off ere long. I go on much smoothlier; carrying less weight. Some five score pages m<supplied>[ore]</supplied> then!&#x2014; Another piece of good news I must tell you: yesterday, after long struggling which I <supplied>[knew]</supplied> nothing of while it went on, I have <hi rend="italic">got</hi> back that <hi rend="italic">Histoire Parl&#xE9;mentaire</hi> Review-paper from Fonblanque, and have it here:<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-08/lt-18360502-TC-JSM-01">TC to JSM, <date when="1836-05-02">2 May</date></ref>.</note> it is equivalent to &#xa3;10 more for us; a thing to be thankful for.&#x2014; We have had as nearly as possible no society; a thing also to be thankful for at present. The <foreign>Stimabiles</foreign> are in the Netherlands: that &#x201C;Saturday night&#x201D; of the Tea proved wet, or we were weary and did not go; going on the morrow, they were &#x201C;not at home, Sir,&#x201D; sailed for Antwerp. The Wilsons are going on Saturday, for Tunbridge. Miss Wilson, since I began writing, has sent me a book I had lent her, with a wish to see me &#x201C;before they go&#x201D;: she was ill lately <pb id="pg-09-45" n="09:45"/>when I called; there has been no meeting since the dinner one. Terrot called yesterday, also for the first time since then; to take leave. He goes by Cambridge, makes some stops on the road; has still a hope of meeting you at Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> &#x201C;precisely a fortnight&#x201D; hence, that being his date of arrival. Charles Buller has had a &#x201C;surgical operation&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">piles</hi>, I suppose); they are then for Switzerland direct; his mother looked worn and ill: of Mrs Austin or Austindom no news at all,&#x2014;gone I fancy to Boulogne to pack up. Taylor called one night; we not at home: not seen since; just one meeting since Miss Fenwick went. Morris [Maurice] came in, one night, late; he had been taking leave of the Bartons<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mrs. Susannah Barton, daughter of Nathaniel Weld Johnston of Bordeaux, John Sterling&#x2019;s mother-in-law, and her daughter Anna Eleanor, who was to marry Maurice in <date when="1837-10-00">Oct. 1837</date> (see <hi rend="italic">Life of Frederick Denison Maurice</hi>, ed. Frederick Maurice [London, <date when="1884-00-00">1884</date>], I, 227&#x2013;29). Mrs. Barton was the widow of Lt.-General Charles Barton (<date when="1760-00-00">1760</date>&#x2013;<date when="1819-00-00">1819</date>) of the 2nd Life Guards.</note> who were for Ireland; Sterling wrote in happy humour from Bourdeaux, no other news: we gave Morris a morsel of bread and cheese with a glass of ale, a spoonful of porridge too by way of trial, and sent him on his way. Pepoli has been here, not quite so lame; he said nothing of the Letter. Cavaignac too and the other: &#x201C;<foreign>Soeur toujours</foreign> &#x26;c&#x201D;; for the rest, C. talks of running out to Spain, and fighting there, some Democratic prospect opening now.<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Against the background of the war between Don Carlos representing reaction and Isabella II representing liberalism, <date when="1833-00-00">1833</date>&#x2013;<date when="1840-00-00">40</date>, disillusioned by defeats inflicted by the Carlists in <date when="1836-06-00">June</date> and <date when="1836-07-00">July</date>, the Sergeants of the Guard had mutinied at La Granja on <date when="1836-08-12">12 Aug.</date> and forced the queen regent, Maria Cristina, to promise a return to the radical constitution of <date when="1812-00-00">1812</date>. Presumably Cavaignac wanted to join in the coming struggle between the radicals and the moderates amongst Isabella&#x2019;s supporters.</note> C<hi rend="italic">g</hi> were he not so noisy I could do very well with: Marrast seems to me an impudent, dissolute yellow little body; an offence rather.&#x2014; One night the Willises<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. Robert Willis and his wife.</note> came, having volunteered to John; Hunt also came, by chance; whereupon the Piano was opened, there was singing, strumming, and Hunt&#x2019;s delight was great. So great that the Willises would needs have us all to tea with them: Monday night it accordingly took place; but on this second trial Mrs W. proved not half so charming,&#x2014;&#x201C;there is something I know not what&#x201D; insinuated Hunt as we came home; &#x201C;there is a quality of limitation,&#x201D; answered I. In fact it is singular how the beautifullest melody of voice is nothing at all without feeling: and out of lachrymose Webers<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-03/lt-18250411-JBW-EA-01"><sic>3:314</sic><corr>JBW to EA, <date when="1825-04-11">11 April 1825</date></corr></ref>.</note> and the <hi rend="italic">Church</hi> parts of Handel, the Willises are dead. Hunt tried goodnaturedly with zeal to convince them that <pb id="pg-09-46" n="09:46"/>Beethoven was the man and not Weber: rain-water on a glazed umbrella!</p>
<p>The poor Novelli is actually got out of London: well if she stay! The Perugini<note n="15" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> had found her some sort of Boarding school at Brighton (the mistress of which had <hi rend="italic">seen</hi> Beatrice); and had almost to force her off. Unhappy Beatrice came and told us on Sunday with many tears, how &#x201C;cruel&#x201D; Perugini had been to her &#x26;c, how <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;brusque,&#x201D;</hi> and had shaken her up with a long pole; <foreign><hi rend="italic">O Iddio, ch&#x2019;&#xE8; crudele</hi></foreign> [Oh God, how merciless]!&#x2014; We gave her a &#x201C;bottle of porter&#x201D; (literally) by way of sleeping draught and medicine for that night, and sent her off consoled as far as we could.&#x2014; W. Gibson <hi rend="italic">had</hi> us at dinner last saturday. He came down one morning, prosy as Lethe, kind as Summer; broke the eye out of a day for me: I grew quite savage at last. However there was one thing he had determined on, that &#x201C;your Brother and you&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;just drop a line&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;any day ye like&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;any hour.&#x201D; I had not the heart to drop a line of denial, when Jack came in; we went at 9 o&#x2019;clock and really were very well. Innumerable comp<hi rend="italic">ts</hi> went to Templand: you and your mother were pledged with full bumpers, not in solemn silence: the health of Gibson and his clean skin and imperturbable joyfulness of nature always does me good.&#x2014;&#x2014;This I think is my last item of chatter (not worth writing, were you not in such seclusion); and at all events, my paper is done. I daresay this or the other thing, of comparatively more importance, is forgotten; but I cannot help it.&#x2014; I was very glad to hear of the Game<note n="16" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hunting privileges at Craigenputtoch.</note> being let; in that case my Letter to M&#x2019;Diarmid falls to nothing. Have you never seen Aird?<note n="17" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Aird.</note> Send for him, if not.&#x2014; Let me have a Newspaper for a token; then a Letter&#x2014;to say <hi rend="italic">which day</hi>, and how.&#x2014; Or would you grow <hi rend="italic">better</hi>, now that all is quiet thro&#x2019; this Autumn time; staying <hi rend="italic">there?</hi> I doubt, not. But do always what is best in your own judgement; mine cannot act in the case, only my wishes can; my heart&#x2019;s desire that betterness <hi rend="italic">were</hi>. Poor Goody! rest thyself well: then set a stout heart to it, and determine <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to be ill; and so splash thro&#x2019; it, and get home.&#x2014; Have you heard anything of my Mother? Is there any prospect of meeting?&#x2014; All manner of kind remembrances and thanks to your Mother; and trial if she will not <hi rend="italic">come with you.</hi>&#x2014; <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign> dear Jeannie mine!</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Aunt</salute>
<p>Now that I am fairly settled at home again, and can look back over my late travels with the coolness of a spectator; it seems to me that I must have tired out all men, women, and children that have had to do with me by the road. The proverb says &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">there is much ado when <foreign>cadgers</foreign></hi> [itinerant dealers] <hi rend="italic">ride</hi>.&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Kelly</hi>, p. 315, &#x201C;There is <foreign>mickle</foreign> to do when Domine&#x2019;s ride.&#x201D;</note> I do not know precisely what <hi rend="italic">&#x2018;<foreign>cadger</foreign>&#x2019;</hi> means; but I imagine it to be a character like <hi rend="italic">me;</hi> liable to headach<supplied>[e]</supplied>s, to seasickness, to <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the infirmities &#x201C;that flesh is heir to,&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi>, III, i.</note> and a few <hi rend="italic">others</hi> besides: the friends and relations of <foreign><hi rend="italic">cadgers</hi></foreign> should therefore use all soft persuasions to induce them to remain at home. I got into that mail the other night, with as much repugnance and trepidation as if it had been a Phalaris&#x2019;s brazen bull,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Phalaris (ca. <date>570&#x2013;554 <hi rend="small-caps">b.c.</hi></date>), tyrant of Agrigentum, Sicily, reputed to burn people alive in a brazen bull with a fire under it.</note> instead of a christian vehicle, invented for purposes of mercy not of cruelty: There were three besides myself when we started, but two dropt off at the end of the first stage, and the rest of the way I had as usual half the coach to myself. My fellow passenger had that highest of all terrestrial qualities which, for me, a fellow passenger can possess, <hi rend="italic">he was silent</hi>.&#x2014; I think his name was Roscoe, and he read sundry long papers to himself with the pondering air of a lawyer. We breakfasted at Litchfield, at five in the morning, on muddy coffee and scorched toast, which made me once more lyrically recognise in my heart (not without a sigh of regret) the very different coffee and toast with which you helped me out of my headach<supplied>[e]</supplied>. At <hi rend="italic">two</hi>, there was another stop of ten minutes, that might be employed in lunching or otherwise&#x2014;feeling myself more fevered than hungry, I determined on spending the time in combing my hair and washing <pb id="pg-09-48" n="09:48"/>my face and hands <hi rend="italic">with vinegar</hi>,&#x2014;in the midst of this solacing operation I heard what seemed to be the mail resuming its rapid course, and quick as lightening it flashed on me &#x201C;there it goes!&#x2014;and my luggage is on the top of it!&#x2014;and <hi rend="italic">my purse</hi> is in the pocket of it!&#x2014;and here am I stranded on an unknown beech [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>], without so much as a sixpence in my pocket to pay for the vinegar I have already consumed!&#x201D; Without my bonnet, my hair hanging down my back, my face half dried, and the towel with which I was drying it firm grasped in my hand, I dashed out,&#x2014;along,&#x2014;down,&#x2014;opening wrong doors,&#x2014;stumbling over steps,&#x2014;cursing the day I was born,&#x2014;still more the day on which I took a notion to travel,&#x2014;and arrived finally, at the bar of the inn in a state of excitement bordering on lunacy. The bar-maids looked at me &#x201C;with weender and amazement&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-04/lt-18270416-JWCGW-TC-01"><sic>4:213</sic><corr>JWCGW to TC, <date when="1827-04-16">16 April 1827</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014; &#x201C;Is the coach gone?&#x201D; I gasped out.&#x2014; &#x201C;The coach? Yes!&#x201D; &#x201C;O! and you have let it away without <hi rend="italic">me!</hi> O! stop it,&#x2014;cannot you, stop it?&#x201D; and out I rushed into the street with streaming hair and streaming towel, and almost brained myself against&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">the Mail!</hi> which was standing there in all stillness without so much as horses in it!&#x2014;what I had heard was a heavy coach!&#x2014; And now having descended like a maniac, I ascended again like a fool, and dried the other half of my face, and put on my bonnet, and came back &#x201C;a sadder and a wiser&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf.

<p>I did not find my Husband at the <hi rend="italic">Swan with two necks;</hi> for we were <hi rend="italic">in</hi>, a quarter of an hour before the appointed time. so I had my luggage put on the backs of two porters and walked on to Cheapside, where I presently found a Chelsea Omnibus. By and by however, the omnibus stopt, and amid cries of &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">no room Sir&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;Cant get in</hi>&#x201D;&#x2014; Carlyle&#x2019;s face beautifully set off by a broad-brimmed white hat gazed in at the door,&#x2014;like the Peri who &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">at the gate-of heaven stood disconsolate</hi>&#x201D;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. &#x201C;Paradise and the Peri,&#x201D; II. 1&#x2013;2, in Thomas Moore, <hi rend="italic">Lallah Rookh</hi> (London, <date when="1817-00-00">1817</date>).</note>&#x2014;in hurrying along the Strand pretty sure of being too late,&#x2014;amidst all the imaginable and unimaginable phenomena which that immense thorough fare of a street presents; his eye (heaven bless the mark) had lighted on <hi rend="italic">my trunk</hi> perched on the top of the omnibus and had recognised it!

They were very kind to me, but on my life, every body is kind to me! and to a degree that fills me with admiration&#x2014;I feel so strong a wish to make you all convinced how very deeply I feel your kindness!&#x2014;and just the more I would say; the less I am able to say anything.</p>

<salute>My dear Sterling,</salute>
<p>One evening, almost a fortnight ago, returning home from a long solitary walk in the twilight, I found lying on the table a Letter,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> the superscription of which I <hi rend="italic">knew</hi>. Nothing could be welcomer, more opportune. My Brother had left me that morning,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Monday,<date when="1836-08-29">29 Aug.</date></note> we had waved hats sorrowfully at the St Katherine Docks; my Wife was still in Scotland; I had worked all day, able to <hi rend="italic">do</hi> no work: I felt unusually alone in this world. It is very sweet to hear a Brother&#x2019;s voice saluting us from the distance, in such mood; saying, &#x201C;Thank Heaven, with me it fares thus and thus: now How with thee?&#x201D; It were a very shabby Earth this, without a thing or two of that kind.</p>
<p>You paint me, so far as scenery and environment goes, a mere terrestrial Paradise there on the Garonne. Contrasted with the grinding dust and discord of this London it makes one sigh. Your own mood of mind too is all that one could expect: glad and sad. A sunny cheerfulness, continual activity; struggling to keep down an under-world of Unrest.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Carlyle&#x2019;s later descriptions of Sterling&#x2019;s character in his <hi rend="italic">Life, Works</hi>, XI.</note> It is beautiful to me but also mournful: alas, so are the brightest men made; their Life like golden sunshine on a black deep river! My dear Friend, there is but one doctrine of <foreign><hi rend="italic">Philosophia Prima</hi></foreign> [First Philosophy] that I would impress on you: <hi rend="italic">The necessity of sitting quiet</hi>. Could I but teach you that, you were verily without flattery one of the best fellows in this world. Nay as it is one finds you altogether exceedingly easy to tolerate; and prays you, in the name of Heaven to take care of yourself, and get the <hi rend="italic">body</hi> casehardened a little; that so, sitting or running, quiet and unquiet, you may rough it out like the rest of us,&#x2014;with fair play to you!</p>
<p>Meanwhile mourn not, my good Friend, to see yourself dissevered from all practical Activity, and put among the Supernumeraries (as Hypochondria will suggest). It is hard for the young soul, all budding with activities and capabilities, to hear it said, Thou shalt <hi rend="italic">not</hi> be <pb id="pg-09-51" n="09:51"/>active. Nevertheless I protest, and could demonstrate as Euclid, that it is, many times, most merciful, beneficial for the young soul (if there be rich promise there); that most probably for <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, in <hi rend="italic">your</hi> case, it may prove furthersome and not hindersome. Or perhaps you already believe it, and know it; and will not thank me for my demonstration? If so, know it well, then; blessing God for it: and let the thought of it be as Peace to you in these pilgrimings, which for the present are not joyous but grievous.&#x2014; I myself have been buried seven<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In fact six years, from <date when="1828-05-00">late May 1828</date> to <date when="1834-05-00">May 1834</date>.</note> long years among Peat-Bogs, nearly forty years now amid black obstructions and confusions too tedious to mention; and I can speak on the subject: I declare it to be all right and good. How the seed-corn seems lost when you bury it! And yet that is but an <hi rend="italic">inadequate</hi> similitude. On the whole <hi rend="small-caps">silence</hi> seems to me the Highest Divinity on this Earth at present. Blessed is <hi rend="small-caps">silence</hi>; the giver of all Truth, of all Good that has any substance or continuance in it! If a man is to work, indeed, as a Reviewer, or Pamphlet-Book writer, or as a Parliamenteer, or Town-crier, silence will not do for him at all. But if a man is not to work in any such way as these, but in a quite other and higher way, then let him sit seven years silent, or half a century silent (nay for that matter, all his days <hi rend="italic">silent</hi>),&#x2014;the <hi rend="small-caps">net-result</hi> cannot be got out of him otherwise. Seed-corn, as I said, is one thing; ground meal is another: this latter you must not bury. My faith as to John Sterling is that the fellow is not meant for <hi rend="italic">meal!</hi> Therefore that this snatching of him away from me, tho&#x2019; abundantly sorrowful, is even what it ought to be; that perhaps we shall both bless it yet; and finally&#x2014;that for the present my Sermon ought to terminate. Take it as a real <foreign><hi rend="italic">sermo</hi></foreign> [discourse], or word spoken in earnest. The grand Application and use of Improvement of the whole is: Sit quiet, or as near as may be <hi rend="italic">stagnant;</hi> in the stillness all blessed things will grow in you.&#x2014;</p>
<p>But probably it were far better if I sent you instead of Sermon a large bundle of News. You know my seclusion here; also how all people at this season are roaming out of Town. About ten days ago, my Wife came home: I descried her trunks outside an Omnibus in Fleet-Street, as I went to meet her; the Mail having come earlier than usual. She esteemed it a mark of great genius. The poor Dame had suffered very greatly, and did nothing but complain from Scotland: but she had done much better ever since her return, and is really now about as well as usual. She sends you many a kind remembrance, <pb id="pg-09-52" n="09:52"/>not by this Sheet only but by many a spiritual Conveyance on which no postage is charged. This day week I saw Mrs Austin; lately returned from Boulogne; and now making ready for Malta, of her Husband&#x2019;s appointment to which I fancy you have heard. It is an appointment to be the Minos and Lycurgus<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Minos was a legendary king of Crete who was made a judge in the infernal regions; for Lycurgus, see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18360806-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1836-08-06">6 Aug.</date></ref></note> of Malta, as I often say; for which he ought to bless the Powers continually; nay Minos and Lycurgus had to <hi rend="italic">enforce</hi> as well as legislate, and here is all Britain to enforce for Austin! Nevertheless one may doubt if it will do much for him; so <hi rend="italic">aci</hi><supplied>[<hi rend="italic">di</hi>]</supplied><hi rend="italic">fied</hi> a man has he grown; and <hi rend="italic">produces</hi> nothing but acid,&#x2014;perhaps of an antiseptic quality. That evening he was confined sick. Cornewall Lewis<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sir George Cornewall Lewis (<date when="1806-00-00">1806</date>&#x2013;<date when="1863-00-00">63</date>), also a commissioner on Malta (see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18360806-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1836-08-06">6 Aug.</date></ref>); M.P. for Herefordshire, <date when="1847-00-00">1847</date>&#x2013;<date when="1852-00-00">52</date>, and Radnor, <date when="1855-00-00">1855</date>&#x2013;<date when="1863-00-00">63</date>; editor of the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review</hi>, <date when="1852-00-00">1852</date>&#x2013;<date when="1855-00-00">55</date>; inherited baronetcy, <date when="1855-00-00">1855</date>; Chancellor of the Exchequer, <date when="1855-00-00">1855</date>&#x2013;<date when="1858-00-00">58</date>; Home Secretary, <date when="1859-00-00">1859</date>&#x2013;<date when="1861-00-00">61</date>; author of <hi rend="italic">An Inquiry into the Credibility of the Early Roman History</hi>, 2 vols. (London, <date when="1855-00-00">1855</date>), an attack on Niebuhr&#x2019;s methods, and many translations, essays, and books.</note> was there; Henry Taylor, beautiful man, and on the same sofa with him a Saxon Countess (L&#xF6;wenthal,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> I think) a beautiful woman. The conversation went on in French; and amounted to&#x2014;a pleasant time of music or Sonata: of which some crabbed Fontenelle might have asked, indeed: <foreign><hi rend="italic">Sonate, que me veux tu</hi></foreign> [Sonata, what do you want with me]?&#x2014; John Mill has written to somebody from Marseilles; to go thence by Leghorn, to Naples &#x26;c: his health unfortunately, appeared to be no better; I am not without my anxieties for Mill. By the bye, let me mention that his <hi rend="italic">Review</hi> does not come out till <date when="1836-10-00">October</date>: I have had the <hi rend="italic">Mirabeau</hi> Article in my hand; terribly defaced by the Printer; if I can I will manage to get you a copy of that at least, tho&#x2019; you will relish it but indifferently.&#x2014; Maurice has come twice athwart me: a man I like always for his delicacy, his ingenuity and earnestness: he is wonderfully patient of me, I often think; and I ought to esteem his way of thought at its full worth, and let it <hi rend="italic">live</hi> in me, if I could. Hitherto I regret to confess, it is mainly moonshine and <foreign><hi rend="italic">spitzfindigkeit</hi></foreign> [subtleness], and will not live. But the man is good, and does live in me.&#x2014; There are Books &#x26;c. but behold I have no room for them. One Book let me recommend to you as very well worth reading: R&#xE9;musats Translation of &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">The Two Fair Cousins</hi>&#x201D; from the Chinese. Would you like to see a man of real <hi rend="italic">genius</hi> struggling to express himself, and actually becoming discernible, under the figure of &#x2018;dragon-letter <pb id="pg-09-53" n="09:53"/>verses,&#x2019; Chinese formalities and formulas, buy this Book.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jean Pierre Abel R&#xE9;musat (<date when="1788-00-00">1788</date>&#x2013;<date when="1832-00-00">1832</date>), Chinese scholar. <hi rend="italic">Iu-kiao-li: or, the Two Fair Cousins</hi>, 2 vols. (London, <date when="1827-00-00">1827</date>), translated from R&#xE9;musat&#x2019;s French version (Paris, <date when="1826-00-00">1826</date>) of a Chinese work by Yu Chiao Li. In his letter of <date when="1836-10-26">26 Oct.</date> Sterling replied, &#x201C;I sent for the Chinese Cousins as soon as I received your letter but the answer was that the book is out of print.&#x201D; He later noted, &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Iu-Kiao-Li, ou les Deux Cousines;</hi> translated by Remusat;&#x2014;well translated into English also, from his version; and one of the notablest Chinese books. A book in fact by a Chinese <hi rend="italic">man of genius;</hi> most strangely but recognisably such,&#x2014;man of genius made on the dragon pattern! Recommended to me by Carlyle; to him by Leigh Hunt&#x201D; (Carlyle&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XI, 139).</note> A man who really <hi rend="italic">sees</hi> into objects; and under his silk gown and mandarin ways, has a certain impetuosity in him.</p>
<p>As to myself I am about as good as half done with the last volume of that unfortunate Book: I have at present no other history. My one wish is to have the miserable rubbish washed off my hands: the sole blessedness I expect or desire from it is that of being done with it. After which&#x2014; &#x2014;? No man in Europe perhaps has a blanker Future;&#x2014;which however we will prevent if possible from getting <hi rend="italic">black</hi>. Is one not <hi rend="italic">alive?</hi> Is not this Universe <hi rend="italic">his</hi> too, and this little sungilt Planet, in some measure&#x2014;tho&#x2019; the Record Offices, with their Attorney Parchments would fain persuade us of the contrary? Me they had long so persuaded; but, by God&#x2019;s blessing, shall never more do it. A fig for such Record Offices! There is a Record Office that I know of worth a thousand of them. &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Uns rufen die Geister, die Stimmen der Meister: Sie heissen uns</hi> <hi rend="small-caps">hoffen</hi></foreign>!&#x201D;<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;The spirits call to us, the voices of the Masters, they call to us to hope.&#x201D; Cf.

<ps><p>Your beautiful <hi rend="italic">D&#xfc;rer</hi> hangs over the sofa where you sat last: the stick you lent me that night is in the Lobby, an almost still kinder memorial. It says daily <foreign><hi rend="italic">Gedenke meiner</hi></foreign> [Remember me], as I go out.</p></ps>

<salute>Dearest Susan</salute>
<p>Your faith is very great: I have found the like in Lovers occasionally; but in a <hi rend="italic">female friend</hi> never any thing the least resembling it. No wonder then if I prefer you to all my female friends past, present, and to come! Long may you continue to entertain such kind thoughts of me! for it were a real grief to me should you ever fall away from them either thro my fault or your own.</p>
<p>Your letter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> reached me in Dumfriesshire only a fortnight ago, after more than one long rest by the road. And I would have answered it from there, had I not been over head in <hi rend="italic">packing</hi> &#x26;c at the time, and besides full of tremors about the long journey before me. During the hot weather some two months ago, a sudden thought struck me; that if I did not get out of London I should surely die! And you know how every thing must submit and arrange itself, when once &#x201C;a sudden thought&#x201D; strikes some women. In the present instance it was no sooner thought than done; I did what was comparable to taking up my bed and walking;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. John 5:8.</note> I rose from my sofa and got into a mail coach. And tho&#x2019; gentlemen, with more sympathy than insight, expressed their astonishment during the journey, that my &#x201C;friends should have been so ill advised&#x201D; as to let me travel alone; I nevertheless by dint of pure female <hi rend="italic">volition</hi> reached the place of my destination rather <hi rend="italic">more</hi> than half alive. I had not stayed to set my house in order; had not so much as considered <hi rend="italic">what clothes I should take</hi> which up to the remotest time of which we have any detailed tradition has been the usually primary consideration of Gentlewomen on the eve of a journey&#x2014; one or two thin muslin gowns, and pairs of gauze stockings and gloves, with a few more such flimsy articles better adapted for tropic heat than the sharp airs of Dumfriesshire, was all I carried with me,&#x2014;no shawl, not so much as a flannel petticoat! I felt as if I could never be cold, in this world again, and as if any clothes at all were to be henceforth worn merely for purposes of decency. &#x201C;To think&#x201D; once exclaimed a cousin of mine, a consum<supplied>[m]</supplied>ate <pb id="pg-09-55" n="09:55"/>fine gentleman,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Captain James Baillie (see <ref target="volume-03/lt-18240917-JBW-TC-01"><sic>3:149&#x2013;50</sic><corr>JBW to TC, <date when="1824-09-17">17 Sept. 1824</date></corr></ref>).</note> on letting fall one of a very fidgety Lady&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">best</hi> china cups, full of tea, on her span-new Brussels carpet: &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">to think of the elegant Jem Baillie doing a thing like that&#x201D;!!</hi> &#x201C;To think,&#x201D; may I not exclaim with the same propriety &#x201C;of the judicious Jane Carlyle doing a thing like this&#x201D;! By the time I reached Manchester I was shivering; at Liverpool I purchased flannel drawers; and the first thing my Mother saw necessary on my arrival at Templand was to encase me in flannel from head to foot. Having clothed my nakedness, she next proceeded to <hi rend="italic">nourish</hi> me with new milk &#x26;c, in season and out of season; that I might grow <hi rend="italic">immediately</hi> fat and strong; and strange to say instead of being braced and plumped out, as she expected, within four and twenty hours, or even in double that time, I became, for a series of weeks, only the more sleepless, the more headachy, the more profoundly stupid, and desperate of everything here below&#x2014; So another sudden thought struck me, and this time it was, to return the road I came; and here I am! &#x201C;a sadder and a wiser <hi rend="italic">woman&#x201D;!</hi> and for the present also, thank Heaven, a healthier one. I ought not however to regret my flight into Scotland, since it has made me take with such new relish to London&#x2014; It is a strange praise to bestow on the Metropolis of the world, but I find it so delightfully <hi rend="italic">still</hi> here! Not so much as a cock crowing in the mornings to startle nervous subjects out of their sleep!&#x2014;and during the day no inevitable M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> this or Miss that, brim-full of all the gossip for twenty miles round interrupting your serious pursuits (whatsoever they may be) with <hi rend="italic">calls</hi> of a duration happily unknown in cities! The feeling of calm, of safety, of liberty which came over me on reentering my own house was really the most blessed I had felt for a great while. Seen through the medium of this feeling, the house itself and everything about it, even my Annandale Maid presented a sort of earnest classic appearance to my first regards, which is hardly yet worn off. By the way it is the same sort of appearance which used to strike me in your room in Hill Street, and which I have often missed in rooms all be-pictured and <hi rend="italic">be-busted</hi> and evidently trying to look earnest and classic with all their might. And the impression is the more agreeable in as much as one cares not to analyze it. I do not remember a single article of furniture in that room of yours except the parrots cage; (to whom long life and prosperity, if he be still in the land <supplied>[of]</supplied> the living!) I could not have told what was in <supplied>[i]</supplied>t the next day after I had been there, but I remember well that the spirit of an elegant-minded Man <pb id="pg-09-56" n="09:56"/>looked th<supplied>[r]</supplied>o all its combinations and not the spirit of an Upholsterer. Had I been left alone in it I should have thought about Mr Jeffrey, and not of Trotter.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Either the firm of the Heirs of William Trotter, upholsterers and cabinetmakers, 9 Princes St., or R. and J.

<p><salute>My dear Brother,&#x2014;</salute> Now on this monday morning, having finished handsomely enough on Saturday night the Chapter I was engaged in when you went, I proceed to write, &#x201C;at my leisure,&#x201D; as you settled it should be. Tomorrow morning, if you keep your latest date, there will be packing up and departure from Paris; if this can overtake you, and be waiting for welcome at Geneva, it will be well; but any way I think it will find you there.</p>
<p>I plodded home that monday morning a weary kind of man. There was no omnibus running in my direction at that hour: it was near ten when I set myself down to a breakfast now grown solitary, with the <pb id="pg-09-58" n="09:58"/>rustle of your Steam-paddles in my imagination, and tumult enough whirling up and down in me. I struggled to work all day, and did sit working, tho&#x2019; with little effect, till almost six o&#x2019;clock: then out for a little ramble in the still dusk; at my return home from which there lay, welcome enough for me in that mood, a kind Letter from John Sterling.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> His Father and Mother were come home from the Netherlands, and had sent it me: John describes the country and people in that region as making good the name of his place, <place><hi rend="italic">Belsito</hi></place> [Beautiful Place]; his own humour seems hasty-esurient, vivid and full of activity, far too full; hope, cheerfulness, gladness, and a dark current of unrest running underneath. Next morning came your Dover Newspaper. I did not know what a day of weary watching you were just then getting there. Then came also (<hi rend="italic">behind</hi> the time!) the Proofsheets of the Article <hi rend="italic">Mirabeau</hi>. The Printer had botched and blotched it dreadfully with his improvements, improved punctuation (of <hi rend="italic">dashes</hi> &#x26;c, which I detest): all day was spent till near midnight, bringing it back to where it was; a &#x201C;new Proof&#x201D; was ordered;&#x2014;which I wrote about again yesterday, said new Proof not having come. Your Boulogne Newspaper did arrive like the rest; and cost me, I am pretty sure, nothing. On Wednesday there were news that Jane was on the road; that she would arrive by the Liverpool Mail on Thursday evening at seven! Little Edward Nelson<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ben Nelson&#x2019;s son (see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18330329-TC-JAC-01"><sic>6:366</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1833-03-29">29 March 1833</date></corr></ref>).</note> of Annan called on Thursday after dinner, on his way towards Germany: he is grown much more communicative, talkative; and on the whole seemed considerably improved. We saw him again last night: on the morrow he was to go for Rotterdam, for C&#xF6;ln and Heidelberg: you will most probably hear from him when you get to Rome. But on that Thursday evening he walked with me to Charing Cross; then I strode off at a great rate towards Lad Lane, being threatened a little with <hi rend="italic">lateness</hi>. In the rolling torrent of Fleet-Street, I descry a Trunk known to me; I stop the omnibus: my wife sits there! This exploit I tell everybody as wonderful. The poor Dame was full of headache: but we got home with the last streaks of day; she has grown better and better as yet ever since. She is now about as well as her average condition used to be. My best prophecy in this respect is fulfilled.&#x2014; The Paris Newspaper came on Tuesday (I think); then the <hi rend="italic">Letter</hi> and Newspaper on Wednesday last. I was very busy, but I would have written had you wanted it: I sent off a <hi rend="italic">Herald of Dumfries</hi>, which I had; it and the <pb id="pg-09-59" n="09:59"/><hi rend="italic">two strokes</hi> would do all the business of a Letter. And now you behold us <hi rend="italic">here</hi>.</p>
<p>Jane reported quite favourably of Dumfriesshire and Annandale. She had seen our Mother, safe returned; Jenny whose sickness had <foreign><hi rend="italic">Nichts zu bedeuten</hi></foreign> [nothing to worry about]: Alick and the whole clan of them with her own Mother had seen her into the Steamboat. She describes her suffering in that Steamboat as having been intense, near to <hi rend="italic">death;</hi> really very bad, as you would understand medically, could I explain it to you,&#x2014;proceeding from nervousness, I think. She rested at Liverpool two days; then off, as I have described.&#x2014; Since that, there has come an Annan Newspaper, or perhaps two, with Jenny&#x2019;s hand on it. No <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi> came last week: perhaps it was ill <hi rend="italic">wafered</hi>, and so lost; perhaps Jean and Jenny are over at Scotsbrig on some visit: the like has happened before now. M&#x2019;Diarmid, Jane says, appeared to be losing himself with <hi rend="italic">drink;</hi> not unlike growing <hi rend="italic">mad:</hi> I sincerely grieve for it. The Game of Craigenputtoch is let, for &#xa3;5 annually (it <hi rend="italic">had been</hi> let to that Clarke,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly the innkeeper Ambrose Clarke of Dumfries (see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18330112-TC-MAC-01"><sic>6:295</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1833-01-12">12 Jan. 1833</date></corr></ref>).</note> at the time I wrote): the money buys bits of clothes for the poor wife. &#x201C;What clothes of price they had&#x201D;; as it is always said, from the time of the <hi rend="italic">Nibelungen</hi>, and earlier!&#x2014; We have blustery damp weather; which I fear, in Scotland may be stormy and rainy; very unfurthersome for the Harvestwork. There will almost inevitably, this year, be a deficient Crop: which in itself is a bad thing; and yet coupled with other things, it often proves not so bad! What have the good Harvests done for the great multitude? Cheap bread; and then no work to buy it with. Things are madly ordered in this England, in this World.</p>
<p>Having told you that my Second Chapter<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Vol. III, Book II. &#x201C;Regicide.&#x201D;</note> is in the Drawer, I have brought up my own Biography completely enough. The Chapter is longer than I expected; not right, yet it must do. I have a great lesson to learn: that of <foreign><hi rend="italic">einmal fertig werden</hi></foreign> [finally getting through]. Much poring does but confuse, and reduce all to a caudle: Get it done, and let there be an end! The bricklayer does not insist on all being smooth as <hi rend="italic">marble</hi>, but only on all having a certain <hi rend="italic">degree</hi> of smoothness and straightness; and so he gets a wall done. As to what you admonished about <hi rend="italic">style</hi>, tho&#x2019; you goodnaturedly fall away from it now, there was actually some profit in it, and some effect. It reminds me once more that there are always two parties to a good style: the contented Writer and the contented Reader. Many a little thing I propose to alter with <pb id="pg-09-60" n="09:60"/>an eye to greater clearness. But the grand point at present is to get done <hi rend="italic">briefly</hi>. I find I have only 88 pages in all, and infinite matters to cram into them. I propose <hi rend="italic">investigating</hi> almost no farther; but dashing in what I already have in some compendious grandiose-massive way. There are some Three Chapters yet: the first the <hi rend="italic">Girondins;</hi> for Louis is now well guillotined. Forward! This week I will do off that <hi rend="italic">Hist. Parlementaire</hi> Article; bring up my Correspondence, clear the decks in that way; then, perhaps about the time you are reading this, to my <hi rend="italic">Girondins!</hi> I <hi rend="italic">had</hi> already found out the medicinal <foreign><hi rend="italic">Schachtel</hi></foreign> [box], and been at it; I feel really very well at present; and could almost persuade myself it were the natural state of <hi rend="italic">wellness:</hi> perhaps it is after all; and <hi rend="italic">stagnancy</hi> is the unwholesome state for me? The joy I anticipate in finishing this Book is considerable: Go thou unhappy Book, that hast nearly wrung the life out of me; go in God&#x2019;s name or the Devil&#x2019;s! One will be <hi rend="italic">free</hi>, after that; and look abroad over the world to see what it holds for one. <hi rend="italic">When</hi> I shall get finished it were not good to predict; all my settings of time hitherto have proved false: but surely in some few months now we <hi rend="italic">shall</hi> be over.&#x2014;&#x2014; I ought to tell you something of our Friends, however. John Mill is understood to be gone by Marseille towards Naples. He had written from Geneva that his Head grew not better; the Doctor here begins to have apprehension of organic mischief in that quarter. Mill has twice requested me to write: but I doubt whether I shall get it done. They say Mrs Taylor travels with him; which surely is a <foreign><hi rend="italic">gar beliches</hi></foreign> [very popular] arrangement: he has left the two little Brothers at Geneva, and is on with the wa<supplied>[ter-]</supplied>witch or Landwitch!&#x2014; Mrs Austin was here yesterday: you would not have found her at Boulogne; she came in to the St Katherine Docks that very day you went out thence, having finished her business at Boulogne. &#x201C;In a week&#x201D; they are now to be off for Marseille; a King&#x2019;s Ship is to take them up there, then forward to Malta. Austin for the present is &#x201C;very ill.&#x201D; Perhaps you may fall in with them in that Marseilles region; many a one&#x2019;s road seems pointing thither this autumn. John Sterling still hints at Madeira, but I think will not go; at least he will go direct from Bourd<hi rend="italic">x;</hi> or &#x201C;perhaps take a trip to the West Indies,&#x201D; in wintertime. They are in good hopes about him, that he will do well. Sterling <foreign>Stimabile</foreign> has come athwart me some twice: quick-tumbling on his erratic course with the old vigour and velocity. The sight of him once a fortnight does me a little good, and but a little. Miss Wilson writes pressing me to come to Tunbridge for a week. The weather is bad, it <pb id="pg-09-61" n="09:61"/>will cost me 25 / ; I will not go: but the invitation itself is worth something to me. Enough of news! I am reading <hi rend="italic">Eckermann&#x2019;s Conversations with Goethe;</hi><note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Johann Peter Eckermann, <hi rend="italic">Gespr&#xE4;che mit Goethe</hi> &#x2026; <date when="1823-00-00">1823</date>&#x2013;<date when="1832-00-00">32</date>, 2 vols. (Leipzig, <date when="1836-00-00">1836</date>). Vol. 3 was not published until <date when="1848-00-00">1848</date>.</note> borrowed from Mrs Austin: it does me great good for the time. Such a clean serene environment, so different from <hi rend="italic">this</hi> Revolution one; and yet it is not <hi rend="italic">my</hi> environment now; will not yield me <foreign><hi rend="italic">obdach</hi></foreign> [shelter] here and now! Goethe is great, brown-visaged, authentic-looking in this Book; yet <foreign><hi rend="italic">rathselhaft</hi></foreign> [enigmatic] here and there to me. The sending of Neureuther&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Handzeichnungen</hi> [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>]<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310806-JWC-TC-01"><sic>5:313</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1831-08-06">6 Aug. 1831</date></corr></ref>.</note> to &#x201C;Herrn Carlyle,&#x201D; the thought that it would give &#x201C;some pleasure <foreign><hi rend="italic">diesem Freunde</hi></foreign> [to this Friend]&#x201D; almost made me weep.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <date when="1831-04-05">5 April 1831</date>, Eckermann, <hi rend="italic">Gespr&#xE4;che mit Goethe</hi>, II, 339&#x2013;40.</note> I have done the <hi rend="italic">Exped</hi>n <hi rend="italic">of Cyrus;</hi> I am for the <hi rend="italic">Memorabilia</hi>.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> Jane is on the <hi rend="italic">Iou-Kiao-Li</hi>,<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-09/lt-18360911-TC-JOST-01">TC to <sic>JS</sic><corr>JOST</corr>, <date when="1836-09-11">11 Sept.</date></ref></note> and translating Cavaignac, on her <hi rend="italic">own</hi> strength nearly altogether. She gives me a little music at night, we have a fire and the Sinumbra:<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340912-TC-MAC-01"><sic>7:295</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1834-09-12">12 Sept. 1834</date></corr></ref>.</note> <foreign><hi rend="italic">sehr einsam, eingezogen</hi></foreign> [very lonely, solitary], which is the way I like for the time. Hunt I have not seen again; your Letter went to the Willises. Enough, enough.</p>
<p>Do not conjugate <foreign><hi rend="italic">ennuyer</hi></foreign> [to bore] dear Jack, if you can help it: conjugate <foreign><hi rend="italic">&#xE9;sp&#xE8;rer</hi></foreign> [to hope] rather. It will be the best news we can get that the Brass Plate is <hi rend="italic">up</hi> at Rome. Depend upon it, <hi rend="italic">working</hi>, trying is the only remover of <hi rend="italic">Doubt</hi>. It is an immense truth that. The Stream looks so cold, dreary, dangerous, you stand shivering; you plunge in, behold it carries you, you can swim! My decided belief is that if you felt yourself once working at all at your business <hi rend="italic">every</hi>thing would get fresher and wholesomer; your Life no longer a Theory round you but a Fact,&#x2014;even <hi rend="italic">such</hi> a Fact better or worse; and to continue a Fact, quackery, confusion and the world and the devil notwithstanding. You have had a long dreary time of it; but it can all turn for good yet; really for <hi rend="italic">good</hi>. Go try; take my blessing and brotherly prayers with you.&#x2014; How we are to manage our Letters till you get more settled? Of course it will depend on you: I hope you will make out Marseille; it seems so much preferable to clambering over Splugens[?] again and again. Tell me how I can manage to hit you, and I will do it. But before going farther I must tell you of a Parcel: a Parcel, flat square (about the size of of [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] a Volume of <pb id="pg-09-62" n="09:62"/>your <hi rend="italic">Barretti&#x2019;s Dicty</hi><note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Giuseppe Marc&#x2019; Antonio Baretti (<date when="1719-00-00">1719</date>&#x2013;<date when="1789-00-00">89</date>), Italian critic, <hi rend="italic">Dictionary of the English and Italian Languages</hi> &#x2026; 2 vols. (London, <date when="1760-00-00">1760</date>).</note>) consisting seemingly of various small Books, came precisely the Thursday after you were gone. Thro&#x2019; Fraser. I opened it: the second cover stood directed &#x201C;M. le Pasteur Gaussen aux Grottes &#xE0; Gen&#xE8;ve&#x201D;; there was a Letter from Dr Peebles<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably John Home Peebles, Fellow of Royal College of Physicians in Florence and Edinburgh, later Physician in Ordinary at the Royal Infirmary, of 11 Wemyss Place; author of <hi rend="italic">Cases of great enlargement of the stomach</hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1850-00-00">1850</date>) and <hi rend="italic">Observations on petechial fevers and petechial eruptions</hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1835-00-00">1835</date>).</note> &#x201C;Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>&#x201D; merely. The Letter (a small Note) is not very legible; but seems to say merely that you are to give that (&#x201C;religious books&#x201D;) and all kinds of Compliments &#x26;c to the Pastor at the Grottoes. The date is &#x201C;<date when="1836-08-24">24 Aug<hi rend="italic">t</hi></date> Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>.&#x201D; Now what am I to do? If I had known Peebles&#x2019;s address I would have sent the thing back: if I had known the address of any of your Roman Doctors going that way, I would have given it to them. Or shall I send off direct from the Regent&#x2019;s Quadrant<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Regent St., where there were three post offices.</note> here? He seems little other than a clattering <foreign><hi rend="italic">Gomeral</hi></foreign> [Blockhead] this Peebles; however one ought to do civilly (at all rates justly), to him. If you even forget all about it, I will do one way or the other.&#x2014; There has come this moment a Manchester Newspaper from Scotsbrig: &#x201C;All well&#x201D;; which is good. You may send me a Newsp<hi rend="italic">r</hi> from Geneva the day you get this? Then write at your own time afterwards: tell me how to write, or to send a Journal. And on the whole <foreign><hi rend="italic">&#xE9;sp&#xE8;re; ne t&#x2019;ennuie pas</hi></foreign> [hope; do not be bored]! my brave Boy: be determined that better days are coming; once so determined they are already <hi rend="italic">come</hi>. Who knows wh<hi rend="italic">t</hi> the next summer will bring forth. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Sie heissen uns hoffen</hi></foreign> [They bid us hope]!<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-09/lt-18360911-TC-JOST-01">TC to <sic>JS</sic><corr>JOST</corr>, <date when="1836-09-11">11 Sept.</date></ref></note> as you used to quote. At any rate, I think, this separation will not be so long as the last: one way or other, we shall either meet in early summer, or else be <hi rend="italic">glad</hi> that we do not meet. It is beautiful to have things arranged like that!&#x2014; All yesterday dear Jack, I was not across the threshold&#x2014;for Goethe and the Rain. Today there is a kind of semi-fairness; I must not play the same trick, but go, and so <hi rend="italic">leave</hi> the margins.</p>
<p>Fare well therefore my dear Jack! May a good token come soon.&#x2014; <closer><salute>Your affectionate&#x2014;&#x2014;</salute></closer><name>T. Carlyle.</name></p>
<ps><p>Perhaps I can send Peebles by Mrs Austin. Never mind it, if you chance to see no good way.

<p><salute>My Dear Miss Wilson,&#x2014;</salute>You are very good to think of me, to ask me down so kindly to see Tunbridge and you. Very loth am I to give up such a prospect, and say to it, &#x2018;Thou also art a Possibility of the impossible sort!&#x2019; These three days I have kept the matter hanging; but to-day I must let it fall, and admit to myself that it is a thing <hi rend="italic">not</hi> mine.</p>
<p>I have finished that Chapter I was on; and am now (if you know the predicament, which I hope you do not at all) like a conflagration that has gone out in smoke&#x2014;a very miserable conflagration. To lie hidden and forgotten &#x2018;in vacant interlunar cave&#x2019;;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Samson Agonistes</hi>, l. 89.</note> on the whole to feel that you can with a safe conscience be a <foreign><hi rend="italic">caput mortuum</hi></foreign> [dead head] and nonentity. This is the sole blessedness in these circumstances. My wife, who returned about ten days ago, encourages me much to go; but ah me! I feel altogether a &#x2018;man forbid,&#x2019;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Macbeth</hi>, I, iii.</note> bewitched very miserably, which indeed in my own way I am; as a man for whom to seek entertainment, pleasure or amusement were a solecism; who must even rise again, and sprawl forward again on this despicability of a journey, till either it be done, or <hi rend="italic">he</hi> be done trying to do it. Pity me! And yet as the Scotch say, &#x2018;there are brave days coming&#x2019;: that also is a hope which never forsakes one.</p>
<p>I can well believe in your beautiful green scenery: you may well wonder at my crabbed reminiscences of Scotch desolation in contrast with that. Men are queer creatures, and this earth is a queer earth in strange relation to them. I have read of Greenlanders that fled from our Europe to get back to their own regions of thick-ribbed ice. I do love England, however, for greenness is actually green; and hope to see it all some day. One of my darling day dreams in these years is that of wandering over the whole world in Tartar fashion; meting it out with steps of my own, taking possession of it as a heritage <pb id="pg-09-64" n="09:64"/>of mine.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A favorite concept of Carlyle&#x2019;s, which he associates with the Emperor Hadrian. Cf. Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi>, p. 176, and <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340418-TC-JHLH-01"><sic>7:131</sic><corr>TC to JHLH, <date when="1834-04-18">18 April 1834</date></corr></ref>.</note> One feels as if it would prove very remedial, a thing of that kind; as if, communing with the dumb old rocks, man&#x2019;s babblement and madness all left fairly in the rear, it would be well with one!</p>
<p>There is not that I know of any new thing that could interest you here. I had a letter from John Sterling; he expresses himself cheerfully, well contented with his neighbours and environment; but still speaks of a Madeira winter. My wife seems to recover herself daily since she returned. She salutes you and Mr. Wilson with all friendliness.</p>
<p>I have had the article <hi rend="italic">Mirabeau</hi> in my hands. Terribly maltreated by the Printers: if I can get a Copy of it before the latter end of this month, I will send it to you. If not, it will be awaiting your return.&#x2014; Enjoy the fair Autumn; return to us strengthened and refreshed. I recommend myself gratefully to your Brother.&#x2014;<closer><salute>Believe me always,</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>My dear Miss Wilson,&#x2014;</salute>There is no <hi rend="italic">Mirabeau</hi> for you: the unhappy Editors after breaking in upon me <hi rend="italic">four</hi> times with it, in hot haste, discover at last that it is above fifty pages long; and must be omitted till next Number!

<salute>My dear Sterling,</salute>
<p>Yesterday at Knightsbridge your good Mother chanced to mention that a Parcel was about setting out for you; which, I calculate today, may carry Letters; may carry one Letter, or slight Line from me among the rest. You are to understand that, in the present half-desperate posture of my affairs and humours, I have, for a while back, fallen into the literally <hi rend="italic">total</hi> abandonment of Letter-writing; finding Silence the suitablest: I write to nobody whatever, except once in the three weeks some word or two to my Mother; once in the month another word or two to my Brother. Consider any writing to you therefore as a proof that you also are of the kindred;&#x2014;which I hope you esteem an honour, of its sort.</p>
<p>The news we get of you are vague; much seems still dubious even for the nearest future. I grudge that you should quit your beautifully civilized <hi rend="italic">Belsito</hi> for a dull savage Land of Timber (<hi rend="italic">Materies</hi>,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Meaning &#x201C;materials&#x201D; or &#x201C;timber,&#x201D; from which &#x201C;Madeira&#x201D; is derived.</note> Madiera); but if the Doctors say it, why then we must submit. Meanwhile, they say you are jaunting about pretty pleasantly; which ought to content us for the time. You have been at Lilbourne, and looked doubtless into the caves of Saint-Emilion;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Libourne, a port on the Dordogne, 17 miles ENE of Bordeaux, and St. Emilion, 4 miles ESE from Libourne. Sterling described the latter in his letter of <date when="1836-10-26">26 Oct.</date>: &#x201C;St. Emilion I had not time to see or learn much of but it is a very old looking place<supplied>[.]</supplied> It is a very small town built of stone jostled into a sort of ravine or large quarry in the slope from the higher tableland towards the Dordogne. Of the Caves I only saw some entrances. I fancy they are all artificial but am not sure. The Dordogne is in sight below in the plain<supplied>[.]</supplied> I cannot lay my hand on any book that gives an account of the time the Girondins spent there or who precisely those were who made this their hiding place.&#x201D; See also <ref target="volume-09/lt-18361009-TC-JSM-01">TC to JSM, <date when="1836-10-09">9 Oct.</date></ref></note> where I likewise often am, in fancy,&#x2014;with these cursed Girondins of mine! Next year, if it please the upper Powers, why should not I come and see you face to face <pb id="pg-09-66" n="09:66"/>there, once more;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sterling replied, <date when="1836-10-26">26 Oct.</date>, &#x201C;Pray come in the first five days of spring or rather let us look forward to your coming&#x2014;for as to the fact where may both or either of us be before this day 6 months? I am not however resolute as to any plan of my own that would take me along the finite or into the infinite sea. &#x2026; When you slip the collar of the French Revolution &#x26; the fine weather comes round again &#x26; my life becomes insurable at less than 50 percent&#x2014;I hope to see you as merry as Philina or her husband <supplied>[in <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister&#x2019;s Apprenticeship</hi>]</supplied> in spite of your having somewhat more wisdom.&#x201D;</note> a knapsack on my back, a strong oakstick in my hand; this Earth with its greenness belonging to me as well as to another? By the bye, the oak-stick shall be the one you gave; <hi rend="italic">so</hi> much is settled: I have got a sufficient ferule for it, some days ago, not without difficulty, and fitted on the same with my own hand and ingenuity: I propose to walk with it, as long as it will hold together; and to think often of a certain beautiful little episode in my poor Life-Epos, which has not many such in it.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sterling replied on <date when="1836-10-26">26 Oct.</date>, &#x201C;The care you take of my old stick requires the acknowledgment from me which my care of its education had not succeeded in teaching it to express for itself. May your more genial &#x26; more masculine treatment be more effectual! I remember that I used to fling it along the broad walk in Kensington Gardens for Edward to run after it &#x26; I suspect that you will find the scars resulting from the process on the top of the hook.&#x201D; According to A. Carlyle this is the stick that hung in Carlyle&#x2019;s dressing-room, item 78, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle House Catalogue</hi>, p. 93, and <hi rend="italic">CMSB</hi>, p. 196.</note> Episode it has been; Fate cannot hinder it from having been: a kinder Power may make it <hi rend="italic">more</hi> yet, if such seem the <hi rend="italic">best</hi> method. I was remarking to Jane the other morning, that with Sterling I had unfortunately lost what was the flower of all that London had for me. But let there be no grumbling, no hypochondria: silent, cheerful of heart, wait what the Hours will bring.</p>
<p>John from whom I have a Letter<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1836-09-27">27 Sept.</date></note> (dated Geneva) this morning, sends the friendliest inquiries after you; charges me to inform him what you resolve upon for the winter. He says one of the secret reasons that determined him, perhaps more than he was aware of, to go back to Rome, was the hope of having Sterling there. I can readily believe it: people go upon strange reasons; our Doctor is one of the strangest of men.</p>
<p>No Review or Article <hi rend="italic">Mirabeau</hi> comes with this Parcel; which omission, or seeming omission, was the point principally I had to explain by scrawling today. The Article <hi rend="italic">Mirabeau</hi>, after fretting me I think four several times with unwelcome interruptions, of Proofsheet, <hi rend="italic">Ms</hi>. Copy &#x26;c &#x26;c all in hot haste, turns out to be &#x201C;too long for the present N<hi rend="italic">o</hi>&#x201D;; wherefore the unfortunate Able Editors omit it. Not till <date when="1837-01-00">January</date> therefore can you hope to behold this remarkable Production. <pb id="pg-09-67" n="09:67"/>As the French Advocate said, when the Judges ordered him into arrest: &#x201C;I begin to be weary of the treatment I experience here.&#x201D;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310911-JWC-TC-01"><sic>5:424</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1831-09-11">11 Sept. 1831</date></corr></ref>.</note></p>
<p>The Revolution History goes on about as ill as anybody could wish. I am really quite out of order; owing partly perhaps to this frightful splashing weather: I sit down to write, there is not an idea discernible in the head of me; one dull cloud of pain and stupidity; it is only with an effort like swimming for life that I get begun to think at all. Nevertheless the thing does go on; and shall by God&#x2019;s blessing go on till it is ended, or I am ended: other blessedness one cannot hope from it. My habitual conviction about the work is that it ought to be <hi rend="italic">burnt</hi>, that it will never be worth a farthing to any man or woman. Yet I do not burn it: I go floundering along; hoping that the heavy hand of this Enchantment shall be got loosened from me (for it is really like a spell), and I be <hi rend="italic">free</hi>, were <supplied>[it on]</supplied>ly with a possession, beyond that of freedom remaining now for me. Forward therefo<supplied>[re.]</supplied></p>
<p>Mill, they say, writes from Nice: he is not going into Italy, owing to Cholera and quarantine: his health is a little, and but a little improved; Mrs Taylor it is whispered is with him, or near him. Is it not very strange, this pining away into desiccation and nonentity, of our poor Mill, if it be so, as his friends all say, that this Charmer is the cause of it? I have not seen any riddle of human life which I could so ill form a theory of. They are innocent, says Charity; they are guilty, says Scandal: then why in the name of wonder are they dying broken-hearted? One thing only is painfully clear to me, that poor Mill is in a bad way<supplied>[.]</supplied> Alas, tho&#x2019; he speaks not, perhaps his tragedy is more tragical than that of any of us: this very item that he does not speak, that he never could speak, but was to sit imprisoned as in thick ribbed ice, voiceless, uncommunicating, is it not the most tragical circumstance of all?</p>
<p>I saw Taylor<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henry Taylor.</note> lately; very grave, and happy enough. He is devising new Dramas. He could not fancy why you were not delighted to be free from business,&#x2014;as he himself would be; for a time at least. It is the way with us all.&#x2014; the Wilsons are at Tunbridge; the Bullers are in Switzerland. I have not seen Maurice. Your worthy Mother looks ten years younger for her trip to the Netherlands: I think you will rejoice to have this under my hand. The Head of the House is also well; dashing along, in the old erratic manner, with the old impetuosity <pb id="pg-09-68" n="09:68"/>and velocity; on the whole, with a healthy vitality, which it does one good to look on. I grow to honour health of mind beyond all things in the world; health of body, which is generally the near relative of it, only a degree less. My dear Friend, let us both get well! I do hold it in my own case, a kind of disgrace and crime to be sick: is it not Nature herself with her great voice that says to me: Fool, seest thou not that thou art <hi rend="italic">astray;</hi> not in the right road there (tho&#x2019; all the world gabbling recommend it), but in the wrong one? Were the Book done, I will see into it.&#x2014; The sheet is done, my dear Sterling; and not the Book. Too suddenly! I beg a kind remembrance to Mrs Sterling; to the young Lady you permitted me to call &#x201C;Anne Barton,&#x201D;<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Susannah Sterling&#x2019;s sister: see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18360824-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1836-08-24">24 Aug.</date></ref></note> who I suppose is in Ireland.&#x2014; Think of me with tolerance; as of a sinful man who righteously loves you. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu!</foreign></salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle.</name></p>
<ps><p>My Wife is out walking, and does not know of this; otherwise her kind word had been here. She is not well; and yet not worse than you have been used to see her, far better than while in Scotland.</p>
<p>I read an interesting little Book in two Volumes: <hi rend="italic">Gespr&#xE4;che mit Goethe</hi> [<hi rend="italic">Conversations with Goethe</hi>] by Eckermann:<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-09/lt-18360912-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1836-09-12">12 Sept.</date></ref></note> did I mention it in the other Letter? It is very curious to see the <foreign><hi rend="italic">Welt-Dichter</hi></foreign> [World Poet] conditioned down into the Weimar Burgher and <foreign><hi rend="italic">Staatsrath</hi></foreign> [citizen and city councilman]. Many of his <hi rend="italic">measurements</hi>, of things and persons, I found utterly erroneous, his <hi rend="italic">footrule</hi> meanwhile a very correct one. In place and work, he and I part wider every day.<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sterling replied, <date when="1836-10-26">26 Oct.</date>, &#x201C;Have you seen the last number of the For. Review where there is an article on Eckermann&#x2019;s Conversations of Goethe written by a stupid man but giving extracts of much interest wherein you are honourably mentioned? Goethe&#x2019;s talk has been running in my head for the last fortnight &#x26; I find I am more inclined than I was to value the flowers that grow (as on the Alps) on the margin of his glaciers.&#x201D; See <hi rend="italic">Foreign Quarterly Review</hi>, XVIII (<date when="1836-10-00">Oct. 1836</date>), 1&#x2013;30, by J. S. Blackie. He introduces an extract about Carlyle, saying: &#x201C;We next encounter something good, on the character and exertions of a man whom the student of foreign literature can never name without respect&#x201D; (pp. 27&#x2013;28).</note> <foreign><hi rend="italic">Vivat</hi></foreign> [Long may he live] still!</p></ps>

<salute>My dear Mill,</salute>
<p>Friend Grant<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Horace Grant.</note> has taken the trouble to bring me this sheet of Paper ready-folded, with the request that I would write a few words on it: he is &#x201C;sure it will gratify you.&#x201D; Not to deprive you of even the chance of being gratified; at lowest, not to detain Grant&#x2019;s Supplement any longer, I scribble as requested. I had not forgotten your own kind invitation as to writing: but there was almost no chance, at least till you formally challenged me by example and a Letter of your own, of my profiting by it. For these many months I have absolutely ceased corresponding with all persons; two only excepted: my Mother and my travelling Brother; to each of whom I write, and that with difficulty, a mere domestic Bulletin some once in the month. What, in the present state of circumstances, known to you better than to most, could I write or say? <foreign><hi rend="italic">Pauca verba</hi></foreign>, Corporal Nym&#x2019;s Maxim,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-01/lt-18190215-TC-RM-01"><sic>1:161</sic><corr>TC to RM, <date when="1819-02-15">15 Feb. 1819</date></corr></ref>.</note> is the best. Where there is nothing to be made of speaking, let a man hold his peace; wait in silence what the dim Imbroglio will shape itself to. Surely to something <hi rend="italic">good!</hi> Better days are coming for us all. In the meanwhile, accept with your old friendliness, this present quasi-<hi rend="italic">mute</hi> sign of vitality and remembrance; and consider it as a speech <hi rend="italic">intended</hi> to be spoken.</p>
<p>There has fallen out almost nothing new with me since you went. I have been as sickly as heretofore; have sprawled along in my course of work as heretofore. With very poor progress, yet still with progress. I have my <hi rend="italic">Girondins</hi> not far from their Arrest and Calvados; nay not very far from their Guillotine and the Caves of Saint-Emilion.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >One of the places the last of the Girondins, Barbarous, Buzot, and P&#xE9;tion, had hidden until their violent deaths in <date when="1794-00-00">summer, 1794</date>. For this and the Girondin trial in Paris, see <hi rend="italic">The French Revolution, Works</hi>, IV, 197&#x2013;201.</note> After which there are but some three brief Chapters, which must not in all exceed sixty pages! Then <foreign><hi rend="italic">vivat</hi></foreign> [long may he live]! On the whole I am sick of the Girondins. To confess a truth, I find them extremely like our present set of respectable Radical members. There is the same cold clean-washed patronising talk about &#x201C;the masses&#x201D; (a word, expressive of a thing, which I greatly hate); the same Formalism, hidebound Pedantry, superficiality, narrowness, barrenness. I find that the <pb id="pg-09-70" n="09:70"/>Mountain<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <hi rend="italic">The French Revolution, Works</hi>, III, 207&#x2013;8, and for the conflict with the Girondins, <hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>., IV, 121&#x2013;30.</note> was perfectly under the necessity of flinging such a set of men to the Devil; whither also I doubt not <hi rend="italic">our</hi> set will go, tho&#x2019; I hope in a milder manner, our motion not being of that so extremely <hi rend="italic">rapid</hi> kind.&#x2014; In a word, I have engaged to begin Printing on or before Newyearsday; and can hope to have my hands washed of the thing some time in the Month of <date when="1837-03-00">March</date>. O that day when I send you back your Books with thanks and the Three Volumes among them,&#x2014;it will be a day to be marked with chalk, whatever the morrow of it prove!</p>
<p>Another piece of very minute literary news will give you pleasure: that they <hi rend="italic">are</hi> going to print that <hi rend="italic">Diamond Necklace</hi>; which accordingly if the humour still hold you may have a stroke at in the way of reviewing!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mill did not review it.</note> Fraser whom I saw the other day finds now that it will suit him very well &#x26;c; and means to have it promulgated in that elegant vehicle of his, some time between this and <date when="1837-03-00">March</date>.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;The Diamond Necklace&#x201D; was published in <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine</hi>, XV (<date when="1837-01-00">Jan.</date>&#x2013;<date when="1837-02-00">Feb. 1837</date>), 1&#x2013;19, 172&#x2013;89.</note> He himself is to judge when; Cavaignac, who was reading the thing, engaged to give it to him this day; with a blessing. Fraser made another very singular proposal; which I declined: that of publishing the whole Revolution Book in successive slips in his Magazine.&#x2014; I believe there has not been since the subsidence of Deucalion&#x2019;s Deluge<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Deucalion and Pyrrha, king and queen of Thessaly, the only human survivors of a deluge sent by Jupiter to punish man&#x2019;s impiety.</note> any quagmire and mud-slough of Despond of such curious properties, accidents antecedents and consequents, as this of British Literature at the date we now write. Which therefore let us quit altogether for the present,&#x2014;mindful of Corporal Nym.</p>
<p>My Brother went away about a fortnight after you; and my wife returned some three days after he was gone. She had fared miserably ill in Scotland, and worse than ever; but has notwithstanding reaped very considerable benefit from the journey; and grown better a great deal since her return. It is thus with journeys; especially flights out of London. There is a violent disruption of the old courses and habits; which may even prove aggravating while it lasts; but, once over, it is found to have <hi rend="italic">reposed</hi> the worn organs, perhaps dissipated altogether many an old distress; and on the whole yielded benefit. This I think will also be the way with you. None but your last Letter speaks of much present improvement: but at worst of all, we will still hope in <hi rend="italic">home</hi> when it comes to that. Avoid painful thoughts and cares; know <pb id="pg-09-71" n="09:71"/>the virtue of <hi rend="italic">idleness</hi>, for it really is a virtue, which some want. For the rest, never be discouraged by pain: you do not yet know what a fund of Life there is in one; what long corrosions one can stand, and not be worn <hi rend="italic">thro&#x2019;</hi> with them; nay <hi rend="italic">be</hi> worn purer and clearer by them, and see them one day as indispensable blessings!&#x2014; While on this subject of your travel, I ask myself whether it were still impossible that Brother John &#x26; you might meet? To him it would give real pleasure. The nearest I know of his motions, is that not improbably he will pass near you somewhere, on the way from Geneva to Marseille towards Italy. His present Address is &#x201C;Countess of Clare&#x2019;s, H&#xF4;tel des Bergues, &#xE0; Gen&#xEA;ve&#x201D;; which I suppose would carry a Letter even <hi rend="italic">after</hi> him, if so were he chanced to intersect you anywhere.</p>
<p>Poor Grant will get almost no good of this sheet;&#x2014;it will teach him to play such tricks again! However, I must end, lest I provoke him utterly.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Grant began his letter with the words &#x201C;Carlyle was to write you a few lines, &#x26; you see what he has done.&#x201D;</note> There are some news; but almost none worth writing. I met three of your Sisters in Piccadilly one day last week, in a pouring rain: there was Miss Mill and the one <hi rend="italic">like</hi> Miss Mill, and my little Latinist who was surveying Polydorus at Mitcham.<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-09/lt-18360724-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1836-07-24">24 July</date></ref>. Perhaps the third sister had been at school in Mitcham, a town 7 miles south of London.</note> All was well in your household; the new habitation in Kensington Square doing very well, of which I got the Number.&#x2014; John Sterling is at a place called <hi rend="italic">Belsito</hi> near Bourdeaux, a beautiful residence and neighbourhood; where as I hear yesterday, he seems now to <hi rend="italic">give up</hi> thoughts of Madeira for the winter: a thing I am very glad of.

<salute>My Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I have read the first two Cantos of your Poem. Being a bad hand at reading Manuscript, and also very busy at present, I prefer writing before I read it out. Would it were in my power to say some guiding word to you! It is very evident you are struggling vehemently on steep perplexed paths, where a little light were of all things the most <hi rend="italic">valuable</hi>.</p>
<p>One discerns without effort in this <hi rend="italic">Merton</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly Walter de Merton (d. <date when="1277-00-00">1277</date>), English prelate and founder of Merton College, Oxford, the first English college; Chancellor of England (<date when="1261-00-00">1261</date>&#x2013;<date when="1263-00-00">63</date>, <date when="1272-00-00">1272</date>&#x2013;<date when="1274-00-00">74</date>).</note> the impress of a mind possessing great sensibility, simplicity, clearness, piety; a fine sense for whatever is beautiful, a just way of thinking on men and things; in short, a harmonious, humane, <hi rend="italic">gifted</hi> mind. Whether Poetry, in times so prosaic as ours, might be the sole or even preferablest mode of utterance for such a mind, may indeed remain undecided. But it is very clear, the mind has found a certain degree of utterance by that mode. The versification is throughout of a highly respectable kind; the language natural, simple, transparent: in the vehicle of that Spenser-Stanza a variety of true lively thoughts emotions and delineations have found egress for themselves. My main criticism would be that the Biography of Merton, so far as I yet see, has almost no body or incidents; that the Poem should rather have Merton clean weeded out of it, and be called &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">London</hi>,&#x201D; or some such thing, after the nature of Cowper&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Task</hi>.</p>
<p>As to the question of publishing, however, I could say at once that I have seen things with not tenth-part of the merit of this put in Print and applauded there. So that <hi rend="italic">if</hi> you know of a Publisher that will undertake to print it without loss to you, then I would advise, since it is written, let it <hi rend="italic">be</hi> printed. But there is an <hi rend="italic">if</hi> in that, as you see; and it hangs all by that <hi rend="italic">if</hi>.</p>
<p>For if you know of no Publisher, then I surely would not advise you to have your heart grieved within you, and your mind withdrawn <pb id="pg-09-73" n="09:73"/>from useful work, in the miserable task of hawking about to seek one. I know the loathsome trade, and how you would feel in it! Also I think you would give it up in disgust before you sped in this instance. It seems to me farther that, in <hi rend="italic">any</hi> case, as times go, all hope of pecuniary profit from such a Publication were chimerical. Favour you might find with a certain class of readers; or even you might fail to find it: in a word there seems to me no prospect sufficiently solid to authorize your setting out in a disgusting, tedious and probably fruitless search of this kind; it were better to let your Soul&#x2019;s-fruit lie, waiting for clearer days. As for me I have quitted all trade with the thing called Literature, except it be in the way of deep protest against it: for example, I have sat these thirty months writing literally almost the life out of me, over a Book; which I am to have printed, and <hi rend="italic">for</hi> which I really do not calculate on ever getting one penny, or any kind of advantage (censures and stolidity are far likelier) to purse, person of character: solely, it is a thing I could do, and thought right to do, and so would do&#x2014;to my cost. But now bread being necessary for a man, I must look elsewhere than Literature for it; or else fail to find it. The Bookseller Fraser is to print this thing for me: I have not spoken to another Bookseller for a considerable number of years.</p>
<p>But what then are you to <hi rend="italic">do</hi>? Must your gift lie hid, buried in painful death-life; the insupportablest feeling man&#x2019;s soul can have? Not so; even if all I conjecture be true. You must be hopeful, you must be still and steadfast; and if this road be shut, try others, try many others. My opinion is that you could write useful and acceptable things, and give your mind course, in quite other fashion than this of Verse. The only things that are paid for, so far as I understand, are Articles in Periodicals. These may be of what grade you will: despicable, deserving only to be burnt; or they may be true <supplied>[and]</supplied> genuine, deserving to be honoured and preserved <supplied>[or they]</supplied> may even be <hi rend="italic">poetical</hi>, according to my notion of that. The only condition is that they must be written in the <hi rend="italic">shape of prose</hi>; and under certain conditions as to length.&#x2014; Did you ever attempt a little Prose Article? It requires a greater compression of thoughts than the other species; but, on the whole, that thought be <hi rend="italic">there</hi>,&#x2014;that is, for both species, and for all writing whatsoever, the one thing needful. If you thought of such a thing, I should reckon it a hopefuller method than this of Poems in our day: perhaps I might be able to lend some assistance in opening the way for you here; and surely it would be with right good-will that I would do it.</p>
<p>On the whole, you must come down to me, and explain in speech <pb id="pg-09-74" n="09:74"/>whereabouts you are. It will do you good to speak, even tho&#x2019; I could do nothing but listen. I am at home every day till about two o&#x2019;clock or later, and go out to walk at that hour: we could walk towards Kilburn together thro&#x2019; Kensington Gardens. Or every night, we have tea at six. Tuesday night for example at that hour.</p>

<p><salute>My dear Brother,&#x2014;</salute>It is a fortnight and three days since your last Geneva Letter came to hand; therefore, according to order, I proceed to answer you. It happened that precisely as the fortnight ended, on Monday last, I was ready for answering, having &#x201C;finished a Chapter&#x201D; that day; but I felt so shattered and excited that I determined to take two days of rest and promenading first: little way will be made in a <hi rend="italic">new</hi> Chapter, I think, till a new week begin.&#x2014; In what spot of the world you may be in this morning, almost in what element, of Earth or Water, you may be in, were hard to conjecture: I can only see you hastening on thro&#x2019; some dim vacuity; and hope that, one way or other, you may get safe to Rome about the same time with this, and receive it as a welcome there. Much journeying the poor Doctor has had: <foreign><hi rend="italic">ein ruheloser Marsch war unser Leben</hi></foreign> [our life was a restless march]!</p>
<p>There have been Letters from the North Country: a Letter partly by our Mother, partly by Jean, from Scotsbrig;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dated <date when="1836-09-22">22 Sept.</date> containing Mrs. Carlyle&#x2019;s advice on the writing of &#x201C;your revolution&#x201D; to &#x201C;take it <foreign>bonnily</foreign> and <foreign>cannily</foreign> and somethi<supplied>[n]</supplied>g fastish too.&#x201D;</note> then a Letter from Jenny<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> at Manchester. All was well at the date of these advices. Our Mother was congratulating herself on the stillness of home; Jean sent me an inventory of the good things there were in these two Scotsbrig Upper Rooms; our good Mother wrote cheerfully; charged me to &#x201C;thank the Doctor for the keg of ale he had sent,&#x201D; of which she was daily taking the benefit. &#x201C;He is a kind man,&#x201D; she added. Jean had scalded her foot, and come to Scotsbrig to have it reposed and dressed for a week; but it was getting fast better, both Mother and she were <pb id="pg-09-75" n="09:75"/>to be at the Roodfair, which fell in a day or two after that. The harvest weather was miserable: Jamie had in only two stacks;&#x2014;since that, it has been worse not better, till some three days ago, when it seems to have mended: so what has become of Jamie, and many like him, one can only uncomfortably conjecture.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In fact Mrs. Carlyle had reported that &#x201C;James has commenced his Hervest his crop is verry good but ripens sloly we have good weather here now.&#x201D;</note> It has been the worst harvest seen for many years; with a cold season to boot: there will inevitably be a deficient crop, and whatever consequences may follow therefrom. Jenny was back to Manchester, and recovered: she said, Alick expected to be there by and by with Cattle. All went on, you see, in its old average way: for which let us be thankful.</p>
<p>Here too it has been the old average; better rather and not worse. My third Chapter as you hear, is done; the <hi rend="italic">Girondins</hi> are flung out;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >He had finished either Book iii or iv of Vol. III. Book iv is called &#x201C;Terror&#x201D; but also deals with the end of the Girondins; cf. <ref target="volume-09/lt-18361009-TC-JSM-01">TC to JSM, <date when="1836-10-09">9 Oct.</date></ref></note> and now only <hi rend="italic">Terror</hi> remains for me; and the &#x201C;whiff of grapeshot&#x201D; in Vendemiaire <date when="1795-00-00">1795</date><note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, IV, 317&#x2013;20.</note> (two months before I was born!): in fact, there are not above 60 pages that I have left;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Books v to vii took 121 printed pages.</note> compression, therefore, utmost imaginable brevity will be the rule for me. &#x201C;On Newyearsday&#x201D; we are to begin to print; &#x201C;in the course of <date when="1837-03-00">March</date>,&#x201D; we are to be published! I stand the thing pretty well; anchored by my invincible bower-ancher [sic] of Desperate-Hope, I ride quite quietly, and let the winds pipe and whistle.&#x2014; The Article <hi rend="italic">Mirabeau</hi> is not printed, after all! The ninny of an Editor<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Falconer (<date when="1805-00-00">1805</date>&#x2013;<date when="1882-00-00">82</date>) Roebuck&#x2019;s brother-in-law, barrister, judge of county court circuits, <date when="1851-00-00">1851</date>&#x2013;<date when="1881-00-00">81</date>. Cf. Mill&#x2019;s letter to Falconer, <date when="1837-01-27">27 Jan.</date>, and to Sarah Austin, <date when="1837-04-26">26 April 1837</date>, for his view of Falconer&#x2019;s inefficiency (Mineka, XII, 293&#x2013;94, 333). Falconer resigned after the <date when="1837-04-00">April 1837</date> number.</note> (he is really that) discovered at the very close of the account that it was too long, there was not room for it. So it lies over till <date when="1837-01-00">January</date>; which indeed is perhaps a better arrangement; for the Town is empty at present, and the actual Review Number really excels in stupidity and sterility all that I have ever seen: enough to drag twenty <hi rend="italic">Mirabeaus</hi> down to the bottom of Fleet-ditch, where Oldmixon dived and was never heard of again, the &#x201C;mudnymphs sucked him in.&#x201D;<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Pope, <hi rend="italic">The Dunciad</hi>, II, 332.

Furthermore the <hi rend="italic">Diamond Necklace</hi> is now to be printed! I went up to your Hatter&#x2019;s, one very wet day, to get me a hat; wherein I succeeded: large, broadbrimmed; a <foreign><hi rend="italic">gawsy</hi></foreign> [ample] hat. This done, I went to Fraser&#x2019;s, on inquiry after these Paris Caricatures: Corrie<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Corrie or Currie, son of Sandy Corrie of Newfield, who worked for his uncle John Irving.</note> had not come with them, had sent them; wrote to me from Paris that they would be left at Fraser&#x2019;s. They were not there; but Fraser himself was there, and exceeding civil indeed; spoke even of publishing the whole Revolution History in slips, in his Magazine, <foreign>&#xE0; la</foreign> Teufelsdr&#xF6;ckh! This I considered to be wonderful, but unsuitable, and declined it: but the <hi rend="italic">Diamond</hi> is gone to be printed when he likes and as he likes,&#x2014;<foreign><hi rend="italic">subaudito</hi></foreign> [with the understanding of] &#xa3;20 a sheet as the price of it: so, in the month of <date when="1837-01-00">January</date>, probably, two Lights will be kindled; one in the fat <foreign><hi rend="italic">glar</hi></foreign> [mud] of Fraser&#x2019;s Toryism, another in the unfruitful rubbish-mound of Mill&#x2019;s Radicalism; saying, <hi rend="italic">Notice, good Christian blockheads!</hi> And then in <date when="1837-03-00">March</date> we have our hands washed of it; and go&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">whither</hi> Providence bids or beckons; <foreign><hi rend="italic">getrosten muthes</hi></foreign> [be of good cheer]!&#x2014; / / &#x2014;very singular: at this instant of time, comes in the <hi rend="italic">Censeur de Lyons</hi><note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A newspaper.</note> of the <date when="1836-10-14">14<hi rend="italic">th</hi> October</date>, price one half-penny; the cover is completely gone, but I conjecture it with much certainty to be from Jack; and that he is gone by Marseilles and sea, or else perhaps by Nice and Genoa: at all events towards Rome, and by a new more interesting route. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Quod bonum felixque sit</hi></foreign> [May it be good and fortunate]!<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-01/lt-18151211-TC-RM-01"><sic>1:67</sic><corr>TC to RM, <date when="1815-12-11">11 Dec. 1815</date></corr></ref>.</note> By the same knock of the Three-penny arrives a Dumfries Paper with the &#x201C;two strokes&#x201D; on it, for sign that all is still well there.&#x2014; I sent you off some Newspaper, I forget what, to Geneva; and hope you received it.</p>
<p>On this depa<supplied>[r]</supplied>tment of the subject, I have only to add that Peebles&#x2019;s Parcel was actually got off, a few days after I wrote. Mrs Austin would have taken it, but with difficulty; wherefore I excused her. One of the Frenchmen had an opportunity as far as Paris; so I sent it that way. Peebles had not bargained that you were to take it farther: if a <hi rend="italic">freak</hi> conveyance for Geneva occurred it would be profited by; if not, there were <foreign><hi rend="italic">voituriers</hi></foreign> [carriers]. Farther the Caricatures have actually come, about a week ago. Why did you lay out so much money for them and me? I have gone over the whole fascicle, <pb id="pg-09-77" n="09:77"/>Letterpress and all, and do find them documentary, but grudge the cash. Jane talks of making a <hi rend="italic">screen</hi>, out of canvas and folding frame of wood: in that case, they are to be pasted on the canvas, and astonish men.<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly this screen was later reworked as the screen which was made in <date when="1849-00-00">1849</date> (see <ref target="volume-24/lt-18490501-JWC-JCA-01">JWC to JCA, <date when="1849-05-01">[1?] May 1849</date></ref>, in Froude <hi rend="italic">LM</hi>, II, 38), described as &#x201C;the beautifullest and cleverest screen I have ever seen&#x201D; by Carlyle, p. 38 n., and as a leather screen in the first floor drawing room, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle&#x2019;s House Catalogue</hi>, p. 89.</note> Corrie wrote with great earnestness of civility; I shall be glad to see him here, if he return this way. Had you his address at Paris, or how did you find him?&#x2014; There is nothing farther to say of Chelsea, except that our Door is repainted, in the most exquisite green manner: and not only the Door but all the outer woodwork of the House, fore and behind; as we know to our cost, such a <foreign><hi rend="italic">plustering</hi></foreign> [splashing about] and mal-odorating there has been in the untowardly wet weather. But it is all done now, the day before yesterday.</p>
<p>Of friends and Biographic news here I can say little. They are almost all out of Town. The worthy Mr Dunn I have missed twice; and yesterday, that was the last time, he leaves word he is going to Brighton. I mean to try him tomorrow early, if the weather hold good. Do you remember an Engraver-Poet called John Bull, who engraved my old Schiller; and was first recommended to me by Edward Irving? I doubt it. Bull has been, since that, a candidate for poetic <hi rend="italic">fame</hi> by the Bookseller way, unsuccessfully; then a Preacher to an Independent Congregation somewhere (being very religious), unsuccessfully; two years ago, I met him in Cheapside, and he told me he was an Engraver again at Kilborn near this, and not very happy: so the other day, he raps sharply at <supplied>[the]</supplied> door, hands in a bundle of Manuscript, and vanishes. The <hi rend="italic">Ms</hi>. is a &#x201C;Poem in four Cantos<supplied>[&#x201D;]</supplied> w<supplied>[ith]</supplied> a letter full of vehement elegy on the lot of genius, happily very brief. I am really sorry for the poor man: his Poem of which I have read two Cantos is not at all without talent, goodness simplicity and unhappiness are visible in it; but to him such things can bring no benefit. I wrote to him in that strain; I have had in consequence another Letter,<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> equally elegaic, with promise of a visit: I think I shall transmit the whole thing to Mr Dunn; Bull is very pious, conservative; and probably not without hard <hi rend="italic">pecuniary</hi> pinches, that lie not in me to help.&#x2014; The Wilsons are still in the Country, whither I did <hi rend="italic">not</hi> go to join them, tho&#x2019; they requested it twice. Henry Taylor has also I find gone to the Country: I sent him a Letter for my Mother to frank; it contained <hi rend="italic">both</hi> yours, and one of mine; Taylor writes me what a journey it had, <pb id="pg-09-78" n="09:78"/>before the <foreign><hi rend="italic">franco</hi></foreign> could be put on it: our good Mother may perhaps be enjoying it, safe at last, this very day. John Mill seems to continue at Nice: Grant brought down a sheet some time ago, and forced me to write a few lines on it for Mill; I said there was little hope of your seeing him, but told him withal how he might address you at Geneva. The improvement in Mill&#x2019;s health is said to be perceptible, not great. Sterling now votes for <hi rend="italic">continuing</hi> at Bourdeaux; finds himself &#x201C;decidedly better&#x201D;: I sent him your regards and inquiries; in a little Note I was writing to him about the <foreign><hi rend="italic">ausbleiben</hi></foreign> [failure to come] of <hi rend="italic">Mirabeau</hi>, which he had asked for. Morris [Maurice] I have not seen. Cunningham I have: amid such laughter without basis as usual. Also Cavaignac has been here pretty regularly once a week: I grow to esteem him as a man of honest impulses, of talents and energy: but his Task in Life is utterly foreign to me; when he comes to know what I really think of the <foreign><hi rend="italic">Premi&#xE8;re Nature de l&#x2019;Univers</hi></foreign> [Primary Nature of the Universe] (poor universe!) I conjecture he will fly from me as a <foreign><hi rend="italic">horreur</hi></foreign>. Meanwhile I look at the impetuous Celtic man with interest, and make him welcome to my hearth as one in misfortune should be.&#x2014; And now let us turn from London all reeking with paint, sunk in premature fog and dulness, towards Rome; less as the Eternal City, than as the Temporary City where a certain Doctor&#x2019;s Brass-Plate is to be up! I shall beg of you to write to me the moment you get this: or perhaps if you are very <hi rend="italic">near</hi> getting Lodgings, you might wait two days or so, that the Address might be perfect. Willis, by the bye, I hear, is got to Down Street Piccadilly; but I have not seen him since that night you recollect of: Mrs Cunningham did not seem to augur extremely of his succeeding. But how will the Plate in Rome succeed? There is the question. Do the best possible, dear Doctor; and let it succeed as it can. Our Life both here and there is all hanging in the wind. For me however, against the next spring, I have it all so cunningly arranged that, as it were, neither ill-luck nor good-luck can be other than welcome to me. This really true; and very curious. Such an infinitude of different annoyances and menaces come pressing on me from all points of the compass, that I merely fortify my own <hi rend="italic">chest</hi> and rib-work, and say Messrs: the Annoyances, do if you please make out the <hi rend="italic">result</hi> among yourselves; my <hi rend="italic">ribs</hi> by Heaven&#x2019;s help will not yield, and I shall cheerfully be ready to move whichever way the <hi rend="italic">current</hi> goes. Here with only Literature for shelter there is I think no continuance. Better to take a stick in your hand, and roam the Earth, Teufelsdrockh-like. You will get at least <hi rend="italic">one</hi> of two things: a stomach to <hi rend="italic">eat</hi> bread; even that is denied one here.<foreign><hi rend="italic">Es wollte kein Hund so leben</hi></foreign> [no dog would live in this way]. Nor will I. The only rule is: <pb id="pg-09-79" n="09:79"/><hi rend="italic">Silence;</hi> uttermost composure, and open eyes! The beggarly economical part of this Existence on Earth seems to me the more beggarly the longer I look at; the Existence itself the more tragical, <hi rend="italic">sublime;</hi> not a hair of our heads but was given us by a God! I will run down to see whether Ja<supplied>[ne is]</supplied> in that she may write a margin. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Satis</hi></foreign> [Enough] here.</p>
<p>Jane is gone out to walk, to enjoy the brief blink of midday sunshine; I too must take this out with me that there be not a day lost: so you have still no <hi rend="italic">Postscript</hi>. She continues wonderfully well; quiet, tho&#x2019; not getting thro&#x2019; much work (the C<hi rend="italic">g</hi><note n="15" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cavaignac.</note> <hi rend="italic">Ms</hi>. advancing at the slowest rate); and really waits with great meekness for what the gods are to give us. She has hardly had one <hi rend="italic">bad</hi> headache since she returned: yesterday she had one which I suppose we are to call <hi rend="italic">good</hi>? My chief pity in general in these circumstances of mine is for her: she hoped much of me, had great faith in me; and has endured much beside me, not murmuring at it. I feel as if I had to swim both for her deliverance and my own. Better health will be granted me; better days for us both! It is my fixed hope at present either to go to Scotland or to Italy next summer, stick in hand! If any offer occur to detain me here, it shall be well: if none, it shall be almost better. This is what I meant above, by being <hi rend="italic">balanced</hi> amid annoyances &#x26; menaces. Therefore be of good cheer my brave Doil. The world shall not beat us, much as it may try. We will make a wrestle or two first at any rate. Thou seest I am to <hi rend="italic">have done</hi> with this sorrowful Enterprise of a Book, with France and Revolutions forevermore; then I take stick in hand; silently go to compose my body and soul a little; and so take the world on some <hi rend="italic">other</hi> side. I feel strong yet; as if I had years of strength in me. London has been like a <hi rend="italic">course of mercury</hi> to body and mind. Hard enough; but not unmedicative! We will not complain of London; not fear it, not hope from it; let <hi rend="italic">it</hi> go its way, we going ours. If thou prosper in Rome, I may come to thee: if not, why then come thou hither: it shall be good <hi rend="italic">either</hi> way.&#x2014; By the bye Buller is to have a Record Commission,<note n="16" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Buller had been chairman of a House of Commons Select Committee on the Record Commission, <date when="1836-02-18">18 Feb.</date> to <date when="1836-08-15">15 Aug.</date>, <hi rend="italic">Parliamentary Papers</hi>, <date when="1836-00-00">1836</date>, XVI; the Record Commission had been set up in <date when="1800-00-00">1800</date> to control public records and this select committee recommended its abolition because of its inefficiency, and the setting up of a new smaller Commission with some paid members and one building to house the records.

<salute>My dear Friend,</salute>
<p>You are very good to write to me, in my silence, in the mood you must be in.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle is replying to Emerson&#x2019;s letter of <date when="1836-09-17">17 Sept.</date></note> My silence you may well judge is not forgetfulness; it is a forced silence; which this kind Letter <hi rend="italic">un</hi>forces into words. I write the day after your Letter comes, lest the morrow bring forth something new to hinder me.</p>
<p>What a bereavement, my Friend, is this that had overtaken you! Such a Brother,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson&#x2019;s younger brother Charles Chauncy Emerson (<date when="1808-00-00">1808</date>&#x2013;<date when="1836-00-00">36</date>) had died of tuberculosis on <date when="1836-05-09">9 May</date>. He had been unable to write a review of <hi rend="italic">Sartor Resartus</hi> requested by the editor of the <hi rend="italic">Christian Examiner</hi> (see Slater, p. 147 n.).</note> with such a Life opening round him, like a blooming garden where he was to labour and gather, all vanished suddenly like frostwork, and hidden from your eye! It is a loss, a sore loss; which God had appointed you. I do not tell you not to mourn: I mourn with you; and could wish all mourners the spirit you have, in this sorrow. O I know it well. Often enough in this noisy Inanity of a Vision where <hi rend="italic">we</hi> still linger, I say to myself, Perhaps thy Buried ones are not far from thee, are with thee; they are in Eternity, which is a <hi rend="small-caps">now</hi> and <hi rend="small-caps">here</hi>! And yet Nature will have her right; Memory would feel desecrated <pb id="pg-09-81" n="09:81"/>if she could forget. Many times, in the crowded din of the Living, some sight, some feature of a face will recal to you the Loved Face; and in these turmoiling streets you see the little silent Church yard, the green grave that lies then so silent,&#x2014;inexpressibly <foreign><hi rend="italic">wae</hi></foreign>. O, perhaps we shall all meet <hi rend="small-caps">yonder</hi>, and the tears be wiped from all eyes. One thing is no Perhaps: surely we <hi rend="italic">shall</hi> all meet, <hi rend="italic">if</hi> it be the Will of the Maker of us. If it be not His Will,&#x2014;then is it not better so? Silence,&#x2014;since in these days we have no Speech! Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, in any day.&#x2014;</p>
<p>You inquire so earnestly about my welfare; hold open still the hospitable door for me.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson had written: &#x201C;And of you I think much and anxiously since Mrs. Channing, amidst her delight at what she calls the happiest hour of her absence, in her acquaintance with you and your family, expresses much uneasiness respecting your untempered devotion to study. I am the more disturbed by her fears, because your letters avow a self-devotion to your work, and I know there is no gentle dullness in your temperament to counteract the mischief. I fear Nature has not inlaid fat earth enough into your texture to keep the ethereal blade from whetting it through. I write to implore you to be careful of your health. You are the property of all whom you rejoice in heart and soul, and you must not deal with your body as your own. O my friend, if you would come here and let me nurse you and pasture you in my nook of this long continent, I will thank God and you therefor morning and evening, and doubt not to give you, in a quarter of a year, sound eyes, round cheeks, and joyful spirits.&#x201D; Susan Higginson Channing, who had been travelling in Europe with her son William Henry Channing and who had visited the Carlyles at least twice, wrote to a friend: &#x201C;They are, certainly, the most interesting couple I ever saw, and live in a style of the most charming, primitive simplicity. It was worth crossing the Atlantic to see such people&#x201D; (Slater, p. 148).</note> Truly <hi rend="italic">Concord</hi>, which I have sought out on the Map, seems worthy of its name: no dissonance comes to me from that side; but grief itself has acquired a harmony: in joy or grief a voice says to me, Behold there is one that loves thee; in thy loneliness, in thy darkness<supplied>[,]</supplied> see how a hospitable candle shines from far over seas, how a friendly heart watches! It is very good, and precious for me.</p>
<p>As for my health, be under no apprehension. I am always sick; I am sicker and worse, in body and mind, a little, for the present; but it has no deep significance: it is <hi rend="italic">weariness</hi> merely; and now by the bounty of Heaven, I am as it were within sight of land. In two months more, this unblessed Book will be <hi rend="italic">finished;</hi> at Newyearday we begin printing: before the <date when="1837-03-00">end of March</date>, the thing is out, and I am a free man! Few happinesses I have ever known will equal that, as it seems to me. And yet I ought not to call the poor Book unblessed: no, it has girdled me round like a panoply these two years; kept me invulnerable, indifferent, to innumerable things. The poorest man in London <pb id="pg-09-82" n="09:82"/>has perhaps been one of the freest: the roaring press of gigs and gigmen, with their gold blazonry and fierce gig-wheels have little incommoded him; they going their way, he going his.&#x2014; As for the results of the Book, I can rationally promise myself, on the economical, pecuniary or otherwise worldly side, simply <hi rend="italic">zero</hi>. It is a Book contradicting all rules of Formulism, that have not a Reality within them, which so few have;&#x2014;testifying, the more quietly the worse, internecine war with Quacks high and low. My good Brother, who was with me out of Italy in summer, declared himself shocked, and almost terrorstruck: &#x201C;Jack,&#x201D; I answered, &#x201C;innumerable men give their lives cheerfully to defend Falsehoods and Half-Falsehoods; why should not one writer give his life cheerfully to say, in plain Scotch-English, in the hearing of God and man, To me they seem false and half-false? At all events, thou seest, I cannot help it. It is the nature of the beast.&#x201D; So that, on the whole, I suppose there is no more unpromotable unappointable man now living in England than I. Literature also, the miscellaneous place of refuge, seems done here, unless you will take the Devil&#x2019;s wages for it; which one does not incline to do. A <foreign><hi rend="italic">disjectum membrum</hi></foreign> [scattered member];<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Horace, <hi rend="italic">Satires</hi>, I, iv, 62, and the eighteenth-century English phrase &#x201C;<foreign>disjecta membra</foreign>.&#x201D;</note> cut off from relations with men? verily so; and now forty years of age; and extremely dyspeptical: a hopeless-looking man. Yet full of what I call desperate-hope! One does verily stand on the Earth, a Star-dome encompassing one; seemingly accoutred and enlisted and sent to battle, with rations good, indifferent or bad,&#x2014;what can one do but in the name of Odin, Tuiskone [Tuisco],<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Tuisto, according to Tacitus, <hi rend="italic">Germania</hi>, para. 2, a god and founder of the German race with his son Mannus.</note> Hertha, Horsa, and all Saxon and Hebrew Gods, fight it out?&#x2014; This survey is thy idle talk.</p>
<p>As to the Book, I do say seriously that it is a wild savage ruleless very bad Book; which even you will not be able to like; much less any other man. Yet it contains strange things; sincerities drawn out of the heart of a man very strangely situated; reverent of nothing but what is reverable in all ages and places: so we will print it, and be done with it;&#x2014;and try a new turn next time.&#x2014; What I am to do, were the thing done, you see therefore, is most uncertain. How gladly would I run to Concord! And if I were there, be sure the do-nothing arrangement is the only conceivable one for me. That my sick existence subside again, this is the first condition; that quiet vision be re-stored me. It is frightful what an impatience I have got for many <pb id="pg-09-83" n="09:83"/>kinds of fellow-creatures. Their jargon really hurts me like the shrieking of inarticulate creatures that ought to articulate. There is no resource but to say: Brother, thou surely art not hateful; thou art loveable, at lowest pitiable;&#x2014;alas, in any case, thou art dreadfully wearisome, unedifying: go thy ways, with my blessing. There are hardly three people among these two millions, whom I care much to exchange <supplied>[words]</supplied> with, in the humour I have<supplied>[.]</supplied> Nevertheless, at bottom, it is not my purpose to quit London finally, till I have as it were <hi rend="italic">seen it out</hi>. In the very hugeness of the monstrous city, contradiction cancelling contradiction, one finds a sort of composure for oneself that is not to be met with elsewhere perhaps in the world: people tolerate you, were it only that they have not time to trouble themselves with you. Some individuals even love me here; there are one or two whom I have even learned to love,&#x2014;tho&#x2019;, for the present, cross circumstances have snatched them out of my orbit again mostly. Wherefore, if you <hi rend="italic">ask</hi> me, What I am to do? the answer is clear so far, &#x201C;Rest myself a while&#x201D;; and all farther is as dark as chaos. Now for resting, taking that by itself, my Brother who has gone back to Rome with some thoughts of settling as a Physician there, presses me to come thither, and rest in Rome. On the other hand, a certain John Sterling (the best man I have found in these regions) has been driven to Bourdeaux lately for his health; he will have it that I must come to him, and walk thro&#x2019; the South of France to Dauphin&#xE9;, Avignon and over the Alps next spring! Thirdly my Mother will have me return to Annandale, and lie quiet in her little habitation;&#x2014;which I incline to think were the wisest course of all. And lastly from over the Atlantic comes my good Emerson&#x2019;s voice&#x2014;we will settle nothing, except that all shall remain unsettled. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Die Zukunft decket Schmerzen und Gl&#xfc;cke</hi></foreign> [The future conceals sorrow and happiness].<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >From Goethe&#x2019;s &#x201C;Symbolum,&#x201D; st. 2: for Carlyle&#x2019;s translation, see <hi rend="italic">Past and Present, Works,</hi> X, 237, II. 6&#x2013;7.</note></p>
<p>I ought to say however that about Newyearsday I will send you an Article on <hi rend="italic">Mirabeau</hi>, which they have printed here (for a thing called the <hi rend="italic">London Review</hi><note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Since <date when="1836-04-00">April</date> the <hi rend="italic">London and Westminster Review</hi>.</note>); and some kind of Note to escort it. I think Pamphlets travel as Letters in New England, provided you leave the <hi rend="italic">ends</hi> of them open: if I be mistaken, pray instruct Messrs Barnard to <hi rend="italic">refuse</hi> the thing, for it has small value. The <hi rend="italic">Diamond Necklace</hi> is to be printed also, in <hi rend="italic">Fraser;</hi> inconceivable hawking that poor Paper has had; till now Fraser takes it&#x2014;for &#xa3;50, not being able to get it for nothing. The <hi rend="italic">Mirabeau</hi> was written at the passionate request of John <pb id="pg-09-84" n="09:84"/>Mill; and likewise for <hi rend="italic">needful</hi> lucre. I think it is the first shilling of money I have earned by my craft these four years: where the money I have lived on has come from while I sat here scribbling <foreign>gratis</foreign>, amazes me to think; yet surely it has come (for I <hi rend="italic">am</hi> still here), and Heaven only to thank for it,&#x2014;which is a great fact. As for Mill&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">London Review</hi> (for he is quasi-editor), I do not recommend it to you. Hidebound Radicalism; a to me well nigh insupportable thing! Open it not: a breath as of Sahara, and the Infinite Sterile, comes from every page of it. A young Radical Baronet<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sir William Molesworth (see <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340530-TC-MAC-01"><sic>7:196</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1834-05-30">30 May 1834</date></corr></ref>).</note> has laid out &#xa3;3,000 on getting the world instructed in <hi rend="italic">that</hi> manner: it is very curious to see.&#x2014; Alas, the bottom of the sheet! Take my hurried but kindest thanks for the prospect of your <hi rend="italic">second</hi> Teufelsd<hi rend="italic">h:</hi> the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> too is now in my possession; Brother John went to the Post-office, and worked it out for a ten shillings. It is a beautiful little Book; and a Preface to it such as no kindest friend could have improved.<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-08/lt-18360500-TC-JSM-01">TC to JSM, [?<date when="1836-05-00">late May</date>]</ref>. Emerson had written, &#x201C;My mercantile friend is vexed, for he says accurate orders were given to send it as a packet, not as a letter. I shall endeavor before despatching this sheet to obtain another copy of our American edition.&#x201D;</note> Thank my kind editor very heartily from me.</p>
<p>My wife was in Scotland in Summer, driven thither by ill health; she is stronger since her return, tho&#x2019; not yet strong; she sends over to Concord her kindest wishes. If I fly to the Alps or the Ocean, her Mother &#x26; she must keep one another company, we think, till there be better news of me. You are to thank Dr Channing also for his valued gift.<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-08/lt-18360500-TC-JSM-01">TC to JSM, [?<date when="1836-05-00">late May</date>]</ref>.</note> I read the Discourse, and other friends of his read it with great estimation: but the <hi rend="italic">end</hi> of that black question lies beyond my <foreign>ken</foreign>. I suppose, as usual, Might and Right will have to make themselves synonymous in some way. <hi rend="small-caps">canst</hi> and <hi rend="small-caps">shalt</hi> if they are <hi rend="italic">very</hi> well understood, mean the same thing under this Sun of ours.</p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Tho&#x2019; I have nothing any way special to say, I think of writing to you tonight, as I have an hour at my own disposal; and I am very sure you will be glad to hear me even say nothing. I am at the end of another Chapter in that weary Book of mine: writing to you is a little piece of recreation that I think always I have merited in those cases. I used to come driving over from Puttoch personally, when I had finished any small feat of that sort; so now I send off a written sheet; which, tho&#x2019; as old Parliament-Geordie<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. George Little (see <ref target="volume-01/lt-18210110-TC-AC-01"><sic>1:305</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1821-01-10">10 Jan. 1821</date></corr></ref>).</note> said of striking the Dog is but a &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">puir</hi> revenge,&#x201D; is the next-best I can do.&#x2014; There are franks <pb id="pg-09-86" n="09:86"/>attainable now too; certain &#x201C;honourable members&#x201D; having got back to Town again.</p>
<p>We have had a most quiet time of it, ever since I wrote last; very solitary, which when you are busy is not <hi rend="italic">dull:</hi> all people that can manage it run out of London in the Autumn; down to the sea-shore, over to the Continent, to Scotland, Wales &#x26;c; this they esteem an essential condition of existence. My way, could I manage it, would be to quit London in the broiling dog-days, of July, when all is like a furnace with heat and smoke; and to spend these <hi rend="italic">back-end</hi> months <hi rend="italic">in</hi> London, where they are usually as pleasant as elsewhere. But these people manage this, like much else, in a way of their own.&#x2014; One good consequence is that, being left so much alone, if you have <hi rend="italic">work</hi> to do, you get on faster with it then than at any other season. About this time, however, everybody is returning; almost all our friends are got back; and the old system resumes its course again. That it brings <hi rend="italic">franks</hi> with it you will not esteem the worst quality of it.</p>
<p>This Chapter which I have just ended carries me to within <hi rend="italic">forty-five</hi> pages of the end of the Book! I expect to have a bit of wrestling yet with it; but to <hi rend="italic">be</hi> thro&#x2019; about Newyears day. You must tell Alick and Jean and all my friends to be patient with me till then. I have no heart to write to any one, about anything, while in such a tumult. But were I once &#x201C;borne thro&#x2019; with an honourable throughbearing,&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech (see <ref target="volume-05/lt-18300928-TC-MAC-01"><sic>5:167</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1830-09-28">28 Sept. 1830</date></corr></ref>).</note>&#x2014;then it will be a very different matter.&#x2014; Under the article of Works, I must also tell you that the first half of my little History of the <hi rend="italic">Diamond Necklace</hi>, which I spoke of last time, is actually printed for <hi rend="italic">Fraser</hi>, and will appear next month with my name; the second half on the following month. Copies are to be kept for me (I mean, Separate-Copies), and I will take care to have one forwarded to you, as soon after as possible. Also the Article on <hi rend="italic">Mirabeau</hi> (his name is pronounced Mirab<hi rend="italic">o</hi>) will certainly appear in <date when="1837-01-00">January</date>; and likewise probably in the same Number of Mill&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Review</hi> another little Article I have written on the French Revolution, or rather on the <hi rend="italic">Books</hi> that have heretofore been written about it.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Parliamentary History of the French Revolution&#x201D; (see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18360502-TC-JSM-01">TC to JSM, <date when="1836-05-02">2 May</date></ref>).</note> The Copy of <hi rend="italic">Mirabeau</hi> will also be sent you; and of the last little thing too, if it seem to be worth anything. I rather think it will be worth almost nothing,&#x2014;except some ten or twelve guineas to <hi rend="italic">myself</hi>. Lastly they write to me from America that their Edition of <hi rend="italic">Teufelsdr&#xF6;ckh</hi> is altogether sold: poor <pb id="pg-09-87" n="09:87"/><hi rend="italic">Teufelsdr&#xF6;ck</hi>h!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson had written in his letter of <date when="1836-09-17">17 Sept.</date>: &#x201C;Why cannot you come here forthwith, and deliver in lectures to the solid men of Boston the <hi rend="italic">History of the French Revolution</hi> before it is published,&#x2014;or at least while it is publishing in England, and before it is published here. There is no doubt of the perfect success of such a course now that the <hi rend="italic">five hundred copies of Sartor are all sold</hi>, and read with great delight by many persons&#x201D; (Slater, p. 149).</note> Mill declares he is going to review it here.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mill did not review <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi>.</note> So that you see, with the commencement of the year, there is going to be quite an explosion! &#x201C;Not killed, my merry men&#x201D;! not at all: &#x201C;we&#x2019;ll lie and bleed a while, then rise and fight again.&#x201D;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. the ballads of &#x201C;Andrew Barton&#x201D; and some versions of &#x201C;Johnnie Armstrong.&#x201D;</note></p>
<p>Above a month ago there came to me a Painter, he is a man named Lewis<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-08/lt-18351204-TC-JCA-01">TC to JCA, <date when="1835-12-04">4 Dec. 1835</date></ref>.</note> whom I once saw for a moment in Dumfries; he is now come to settle in London; and did most earnestly request me to come and sit for my Picture, that he might exhibit it next Summer in the general Exhibition, and do himself good thereby. The Picture after that to be mine. Leigh Hunt&#x2019;s son&#x2019;s Picture, of which I think I once told you, came to nothing: after six sittings, it grew always the uglier without being the liker; whereupon I silently gave it up. Of this Lewis however, on looking at the Pictures he had already done, we could hope better: Jane earnestly persuaded me to go; nay the poor thing was determined to have me drawn with money out of her own poor Clothes purse&#x2014;&#x201C;before I grew quite old&#x201D;: so I went, and the thing is done. It is glaringly recognisable; has a distinct likeness of <hi rend="italic">you</hi> in it: he has drawn me sitting in a chair; down all the way to the knees and lower all is given; it is the size of your window and larger. I do not like it myself; but I do like much that I am done with it. The man Lewis has decidedly a kind of talent, I think; and with great good humour which he also has may make way here. I got considerable amusement from rugged Glasgow stories he kept telling me all the while; there is nothing of that kind to be had in Cockneydom. One of the anecdotes he gave is this, which I have laughed at, twenty times since: An old Coal-miner was bragging of the great depths he had been to in the heart of the Earth; a neighbour wished to know, <hi rend="italic">how</hi> deep specially? the other said, he could not tell <hi rend="italic">how</hi> deep it might be; but he had &#x201C;many a time heard <hi rend="italic">the Deevil hoasting</hi> [coughing]&#x2014;&#x201D; which certainly was deep enough!&#x2014; As for the Picture, I hope you will see it sometime, were it only for its likeness to the Mother of the Original. It is probable that it will go to Templand to be hung up <pb id="pg-09-88" n="09:88"/>ultimately: in this house, under my own eyes, I cannot suffer it.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not traced.</note> So now we will quit this business; and leave it to its fate.</p>
<p>Two or three days ago, there came here to call on us a Miss Martineau, whom you have perhaps heard of in the <hi rend="italic">Examiner;</hi> a hideous Portrait of her was given in <hi rend="italic">Fraser</hi>, one month.<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine</hi>, VIII (<date when="1833-11-00">Nov. 1833</date>), 576.</note> She is a notable Literary Woman of her day; has been travelling in America these two years, and is now come home to write a Book about it.<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For Harriet Martineau, see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18330112-TC-JSM-01"><sic>6:305</sic><corr>TC to JSM, <date when="1833-01-12">12 Jan. 1833</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340521-TC-JWC-01"><sic>7:175</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1834-05-21">21 May 1834</date></corr></ref>; the book was <hi rend="italic">Society in America</hi>, 3 vols. (London, <date when="1837-00-00">1837</date>), which contains strongly abolitionist views. She said of it, &#x201C;I was infected to a certain degree with the American method of dissertation or preaching; and I was also full of Carlylism, like the friends I had left in the western world,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Autobiography</hi> (London, <date when="1877-00-00">1877</date>), II, 103.</note> She pleased us far beyond expectation: she is very intelligent-looking, really of pleasant countenance; was full of talk, tho&#x2019; unhappily deaf almost as a post, so that you have to speak to her thro&#x2019; an ear-trumpet. I think she must be some five-and-thirty. As she professes very &#x201C;favourable sentiments&#x201D; towards this side of the street, I mean to cultivate the acquaintance a little, and see whether it will lead to aught. She invited me to dinner &#x201C;for Tuesday&#x201D;; but I had a Cold, that day she came; and do not think I shall venture.&#x2014; My cold indeed is about gone; but I must not tempt it back with night-air. It was one of the most effectual colds while it lasted; which, indeed, was properly only one day: water <hi rend="italic">poured</hi> from eyes and nose; I was one of the miserablest <hi rend="italic">sniftering</hi> objects: but by <hi rend="italic">blue-pill &#x26; senna</hi>, I expelled the enemy; confined myself two days (<hi rend="italic">writing</hi>, but holding my nose <hi rend="italic">off</hi> the paper), this day I was out again and had a long walk: I feel now as if I were better considerably than before the thing came at all. I had been <hi rend="italic">pining</hi> about, for two or three weeks; and I think all that salt rheum run out of me has taken some of the impurities with it. We have had the miserablest weather here; almost like yours, I fear. There was snow when you had snow; continual changes; drip, drip, nothing but damp and darkness. I suppose, that may account for worse health than ours has been. Jane holds up as well as possible: she has hardly had one bad head ache since she came back; her trip to Scotland, doleful as it was, has done her good.</p>
<p>You got a French Newspaper from Jack; and were able to make the word <hi rend="italic">Marseille</hi> on it? Marseille is the Southernmost Town in France, where they embark for Italy. Jack gave token of all being well there. I am daily expecting another Letter from him; perhaps from Rome itself. The <hi rend="italic">Cholera</hi> they say is gone from Italy; or at least the <pb id="pg-09-89" n="09:89"/>quarantine impediments have ceased. There would be a Letter from me, I hope, waiting at Rome. Jack was requested to write, directly &#x201C;when he had got a Lodging for himself.<supplied>[&#x201D;]</supplied> I sent two Newspapers also; according to the wish he expressed in that Letter to you, which he very considerately sent in by me. John Sterling, who is at Bourdeaux (also in the South of France but in the <hi rend="italic">West</hi> South) had had a Letter from Jack: but I believe our Marseille Newspaper was a day or two later. Sterling speaks of going to Italy perhaps; which would be a very great comfort to Jack.&#x2014; Whenever I get any farther word, I will give you notice of it, by Newspaper or otherwise.&#x2014; John Mill, who is just returned from these regions, and indeed was here with me a long while today, had lost no fewer than <hi rend="italic">ten</hi> Letters by the uncertainty of foreign Posts. Mill is very considerably improved in health; tho&#x2019; still complaining of his head somewhat.</p>
<p>I know not how much I would give for a bird&#x2019;s eye view of Scotsbrig, for one half hour, at present. Much <foreign><hi rend="italic">pluistering</hi></foreign> [working in mud] and splashing there has been there, no doubt, in this wild harvest: but better or worse, it is all got over now. With what results? Tell James to write a Postscript himself: or Isabella can do it. But it is you, good Mother, that must <hi rend="italic">begin</hi>. I many times wonder how you are getting on in the upper story yonder, amid the wild gusty winds. Has your health not suffered sadly in such weather? That there has been nothing serious going wrong, I infer always from James Aitken&#x2019;s Newspaper Address. But colds and the like are almost inevitable. Do you keep good fires? I think you have a kind of conscience that way. There is nothing like <hi rend="italic">fire</hi>, in such weather. I hope my saddle and you are very <hi rend="italic">dry</hi> there; and do not let the dreary winter take hold of you too much. There will be little Travelling practicable in these months; but they must travel to <hi rend="italic">you</hi>: it is a great thing also that you have a faculty for reading. I wish I knew any Books I could send you, or any thing else: I can only send Letters and Scrawls; but that is a reason the more why I ought not to neglect <hi rend="italic">them</hi>. Were the bright weather come back again, I have a hope of seeing you and Scotland again: a lighter-hearted man than I was last time!&#x2014; I have sent the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> forward these two last weeks, to Jenny at Manchester to be sent on to you: I know not how it answers; or whether I ought to continue that plan. If they are punctual, it will detain but one day for you; which I daresay you do not mind at all. I know not whether either Rob or Jenny care about reading Newspapers; but doubtless they will always like to see the <hi rend="italic">two strokes</hi> on the back. When I send <hi rend="italic">them</hi> two strokes, you are to take <hi rend="italic">their</hi> two strokes for a sign that all <pb id="pg-09-90" n="09:90"/>is well here too. I must write to them, and settle about it. <hi rend="italic">After</hi> Newyear!&#x2014; Has Alick ever <hi rend="italic">been</hi> to Manchester yet? Or what is he doing; how is he getting on, poor fellow? A Letter from him, full of news about himself, would be a great compliment to me; but I can hardly expect it till I write first. You must tell us also about Mary and her James and household. I can only <hi rend="italic">guess</hi> about you all. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Fen&#x2019;</hi></foreign> [Maintain yourselves] like <foreign><hi rend="italic">fell</hi></foreign> [sturdy] <hi rend="italic">bodies!</hi> and keep a good heart always. There is nothing in the world like a heart. &#x201C;If thou <foreign>tine</foreign> [lose] heart, thou <foreign>tines</foreign> a&#x2019;!&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x2014; I noticed in the Newspapers poor Andrew Lawson&#x2019;s death.<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Andrew Lawson (<date when="1791-00-00">1791</date>&#x2013;<date when="1836-00-00">1836</date>) ordained into the Burgher Church at Ecclefechan, <date when="1816-00-00">1816</date>, and inducted to Selkirk in <date when="1824-00-00">1824</date>.

<p><supplied>[W]</supplied>e are very sorry for a certain Cavaignac, an interesting very clever kind of Frenchman that <supplied>[com]</supplied>es here sometimes.

They returned to Paris; the Sister still very unwell. The Doctors all along wrote that there was no danger; the poor Mother had bid them do it, thinking her Son would come back at all risks, and be clapt hold of. And now all at once comes the news that the poor Sister is dead. We hear, the fiery Cavaignac is almost out of his wits; his poor Mother, to avoid his flying to <hi rend="italic">her</hi>, is coming over hither: she has now nothing else left, another Son only, who is far from her, an officer with the Army in Algiers.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Louis Eug&#xE8;ne Cavaignac (<date when="1802-00-00">1802</date>&#x2013;<date when="1857-00-00">57</date>), republican general, served in Algeria, <date when="1832-00-00">1832</date>&#x2013;<date when="1848-00-00">48</date>, ending as governor general.

<salute>My dear Mill,</salute>
<p>The seemingly subdued Cold I had that day you saw me rallied next day, thro&#x2019; my imprudence; became worse than ever; and was only beaten back to its old distance with difficulty and time. Yesterday&#x2019;s was my first venture out: today, in the frost-fog I must sit still.&#x2014; The <hi rend="italic">Diamond N.</hi> is to be printed <hi rend="italic">entire</hi>, this month, I think. The rest of my work makes rather shabby progress, in present circumstances.</p>
<p>Poor Cavaignac has had a heavy misfortune: a beloved sister, qui<supplied>[te une]</supplied>xpectedly to him, is just dead; his mother left alone, and he held cap<supplied>[tive]</supplied>. I have not seen him; he writes me a Note of grim brevity: the poor Sister, who <supplied>[was]</supplied> here in Autumn, was a person one remembered. I am very sorry for them all. The Mother, it seems, is coming over hither; to live here.</p>
<p>Can you, without much trouble, get me a frank for the enclosed?<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >His letters to his mother of <date when="1836-11-20">20</date> and <date when="1836-11-25">25 Nov.</date></note> It has lain imprisoned, with myself, these four days; my Frankers are inaccessible to me, so long as frost-fog and face-ake hold,&#x2014;ill-matched pair!</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>It is a very long while since I have sent you the smallest direct notice of myself; for many years there has not been such a gap in our correspondence. As I can do nothing else for you, one would think I might at least write you a Letter now and then! It seems so very easy to do; and yet it is never done. Tomorrow night will suit better than <hi rend="italic">this</hi> night: and so tomorrow after tomorrow passes away, and no line goes to paper.&#x2014; The truth is, I am and have been in the greatest <foreign><hi rend="italic">fry</hi></foreign> [tumult] I ever in the world felt myself in: not strong of body; uncertain as to all things; my whole head filled with one toilsome enterprise, which alone has kept me swimming in the confused whirlpool that has been about me and within me. I had no heart to open my lips to anybody. You must all excuse me, till a quieter time come. Were I free of this Book, then will be, as it were, a conflagration quenched in the head of me: I shall see the blue skies again, and look round on men and things as one having a part and lot among them.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, here has a Letter come from Jack, announcing his safe arrival at Rome.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> As I wrote only last week to our Mother, I resolve on addressing this to your care; and scrawl a few hasty words to go with it. Doubtless you will hasten to let our Mother know: very probably she is anxious about Jack&#x2019;s arrival; and brooding one knows not what in these dark winter months. I was extremely glad to get the Letter myself; I know not what had led me to fancy some mischance might have occurred. It came yesterday morning: I bespoke a Frank today; in hope of I scribble this for you over night.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-09-94" n="09:94"/>I mentioned to my Mother that I had had a cold; that it had come back on me, and again been driven away. I think it is gone in earnest now: nevertheless I have seen good to abstain altogether from writing these three days, in hopes that I should gain by it in the end. The head, from running water, had dried up; and there dwelt in it a dirty feverish headache, which always grew worse when I took to stooping or writing. So the day before yesterday, I flung down my tools; and struck out with long strides towards the rising-ground on the Northwestward here, and walked for four good hours. I also foreswore <hi rend="italic">senna</hi> and drugs; and instead of that, drew a bottle of liquor, and determined on taking a drop of it to do me good. Yesterday and today, the like. In consequence of which the headache is daily abating, and now all but off, and the feverish sickly feeling along with it: so that perhaps tomorrow I calculate on taking my pen again. It is but <hi rend="italic">one</hi> bold rush now, and the thing is <hi rend="italic">done.</hi> It has given <hi rend="italic">two years</hi> of a struggling (bad luck to it!) which I shall not soon forget.&#x2014; This Cold, which is very general among weak people at present, has been hanging about me, for weeks; but now I hope I am rid of it. One cause, added to others in my case, is undoubtedly the miserable weather. We have had such a year as I do not remember to have seen before. Incessant changes; no two days alike; wet, wet; cold and dark. There come, as indeed is usual in this months &#x201C;November fogs&#x201D; which surpass all that any mortal but a Londoner can from an idea of: mist, stagnation, darkness frost and soot can go no farther. Today on the other hand we have had a torrent of rain; and such a b<supplied>[l]</supplied>ast of wind as should clear us out a little! I waited in the house till it was over, but going out soon after, I found <foreign>canns</foreign> in abundance scattered along the streets, a huge Tree flung out of root in the Hospital Park here, three others in St James&#x2019;s Park their roots lying up to the Sun; and in the Strand (our most crowded street) a whole stack of chimneys (that is, an entire chimney-head with all its <foreign>canns</foreign> &#x26;c) blown into the street, or down thro&#x2019; the roof: a dozen masons were busy sorting it, as I went by.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >According to the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, <date when="1836-11-30">30 Nov.</date>, it was &#x201C;one of the most violent that London has experienced for several years.&#x201D; There followed a long article detailing one death, many injuries and narrow escapes, and extensive damage to property all over London.</note> So goes the weather. And who can mend it? One must <hi rend="italic"><foreign>jook</foreign> and let the <foreign>jaw</foreign> go by</hi> [duck and let the wave go by].<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Proverbial.</note> The worst feature of it, by far, is beginning to be felt here too: the defective harvest. Our fourpenny loaf has become a fivepenny already. The potatoes, we hear are sore ruined. The poor people have taken to <pb id="pg-09-95" n="09:95"/>begging with more zeal than usual. There is a class called &#x201C;Sweepers of Crossings,&#x201D; persons, women, men and children, that establish themselves with a besom where two streets cross, and sweep a clean passage for the footpassengers from flag-pavement to flag-pavement again: these are more numerous and more assiduous dunning you for halfpence than I ever saw them. There is one in a street I go by, an old sailor, very like <hi rend="italic">Rowantree</hi><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-06/lt-18320731-TC-MAC-01"><sic>6:198</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1832-07-31">31 July 1832</date></corr></ref>.</note> whom you remember, except that one leg is wood and leather: he bothers in a half-daft manner, enough to make you first swear at him, and then <foreign>griet</foreign> [grieve] for him.&#x2014; &#x201C;The living on Earth have much to bear.&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> Trade also is in a very insecure state: I do not advise you to make large ventures in any way; but to be <foreign><hi rend="italic">canny</hi></foreign> [careful]; <foreign>canny</foreign> and patient,&#x2014;and wait till we see what it will turn to.</p>
<p>Most of our friends are come back, and all stands about us here much as it did; but we do not as yet get much good of them; my sole care and occupation being to <hi rend="italic">have done with the Book</hi>. That is a thing that friends cannot help me in. I find I shall have the offer of work enough in the writing way, when this is over: but I do not resolve to take them; I resolve on nothing till once I am rested, and myself again. It is in a melancholy state that affair of writing; and wearies the heart of me to consider it. We will, if we see good, let it go <hi rend="italic">its</hi> way; we going ours. By the help of Heaven, there are other sections of the world with living in them for a man. We shall see.&#x2014; Two Pieces that are both printed now, of my writing, will be out about Newyearsday.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Mirabeau&#x201D; and &#x201C;The Diamond Necklace.&#x201D;</note> I mean to let you see them by some conveyance I shall contrive. The Book is to be printed forthwith after that; and published and off my hands in some two months or little more! <date when="1837-03-00">March</date> is the time for it. I shall be a happy man.</p>
<p>Jane is but sickly at present too. She is lying on the sofa here with a headache where I am writing. It is but temporary; she is better today than yesterday; tomorrow we hope she may be on her feet again. She is on the whole much stronger than when you had her with you in Scotland:&#x2014;so heavy a handful at Annan; of which she still speaks, with gratitude for the care you took of her. She returned with a huge deal-box, full of <hi rend="italic">Hams</hi> &#x26;c, which the Omnibus Drivers could hardly lift: we eat of them daily to breakfast; esteeming it wholesome. Our oatmeal subsists; but now, I think, is not strong as to quantity. It has held out well; and always continues good to the last.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-09-96" n="09:96"/>Without doubt there has been a sad confusion of Harvest-work &#x26;c in Scotland too and much <foreign><hi rend="italic">hubbling</hi></foreign> [troubled hustling] you have all had. I begin to feel very dark about it; and desire you very much to take a long sheet and without preface send me accounts. Especially tell me what you yourself are doing. Have you begun pork-curing again? Or what are you after? Jenny said you spoke of being at Manchester perhaps. Tell me very strictly whatever you attempt or do. Above all, be cheery and quiet. A man ought to button himself together, and step along without too much criticising of the way. Shakespeare says, &#x201C;A merry heart goes all the day, a sad one tires in a Mile O&#x201D;;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">The Winter&#x2019;s Tale</hi>, IV, iii.</note> which is very true and applicable to all life. Many times I think of you on the Hilltop<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Where Alick was living.</note> with the wild Atlantic winds piping round the little cottage. Shut them out, and put on a good fire!&#x2014; I hear no word of Grahame of Ben Nelson or of anybody. Pray write to me.&#x2014; I recommend myself to my Mother and to the whole Kindred, widespread as it is now: I have every one of them in my eye at this moment. Special compliments to little Jean and Tom, and Jenny their Mother. Good be with you my dear Alick!&#x2014;&#x2014; <closer><salute>Ever Your affectionate Brother&#x2014;</salute></closer></p>

<ps><p>Give that little Picture to Mary as a remembrance of me. It is Lichfield the Birthplace of Dr Johnson; the three Steeples are the Cathedral.&#x2014; I think I will send the two Printed Things to Jean&#x2019;s care or rather her James&#x2019;s. It will be in about a month. I mean to write to Jack forthwith. I have sent him at least Two Newspapers, which probably he has got before this time. Good night, my Boy! the paper is done.</p></ps>

<salute>My dear Alick,</salute>
<p>I shall begin to believe in our good luck: nothing could be luckier than this. I had written the inclosed last night;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><ref target="volume-09/lt-18361129-TC-AC-01">His letter to Alexander of <date when="1836-11-29">29 Nov.</date></ref></note> and the Frank was all <pb id="pg-09-97" n="09:97"/>ready for closing, when just in the nick of time this morning comes your good and welcome Letter,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dated <date when="1836-11-27">27 Nov.</date> The complete letter is in Marrs, pp. 408&#x2013;11.</note> which I can still acknowledge. Many thanks to you for it; for all the news you send me. It is a sad, obstructed Picture you give me; but a sincere one, a true one; that I can see. We must pluck up a heart, Boy; it will never do, that sort of existence: we must say to it, Thou must and thou shalt <hi rend="italic">alter!</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Much of Alexander&#x2019;s letter is an amplification of his sentence: &#x201C;I know not whether it lies in my own missmanagement or in the will of the <hi rend="italic">Fates</hi>, but hitherto one character has marked all my endeavours, namely signal want of success.&#x201D;</note></p>
<p>I do not like to give you any such weighty advice: but really, looking at the matter with all deliberateness, I should say our worthy Brother John&#x2019;s plan was the feasible one.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle refers to their half-brother, John of Cockermouth. Alexander had written: &#x201C;America is still open as a sort of refuge and really I now see little or nothing else for it but to bundle off in the spring. &#x2026; I was over at a fair at Cockermouth about two months ago and John our brother was fond of talking about nothing else&#x2014;he seemed <hi rend="italic">bent</hi> on going to the neighbourhood of New York in the spring of the year, where a number of his neighbours had gone before and were doing well.&#x201D; John of Cockermouth and his family left for America on <date when="1837-07-09">9 July 1837</date>, eventually settling near Brantford, Ontario. Alexander, though strongly tempted to go to America in <date when="1837-00-00">1837</date>, did not go until <date when="1843-00-00">1843</date>.</note> It is a country this, where as you say the Maker of Bread cannot get Bread to eat. It is a country smitten with a curse;&#x2014;which will not free itself therefrom without still worse pangs! Why not say: I leave thee, in the name of God? America is not a country of strangers; it is a country of our Brothers. I individually seem to have more Friends there than here. Besides they are, as it were, building a Bridge over: there is little doubt but there will be Steamboats ere long, and a passage of not many days. There is soil, at any rate: God will give you bread, if you plough there, and man shall not snatch it away. What if before you are yet forty, while your strength is at its best, you should actually with one brave effort cut yourself loose! I advise you to consider it, with calmness, with courage; long and well.&#x2014; Have nothing to do with Tom Grahame, and his clout of moss; hunger, hunger, nothing but hunger and toil lies there.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alexander had written: &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Tom Graham</hi> of Moat has a small farm on Annan Moor called Restow halo to lett (which John Ewart has farmed, or rather abused I believe, for some few years but is now to have it <hi rend="italic">no</hi> longer). I have not seen it yet but am told it is a poor beggarly spot of earth, scarcely perhaps worth looking at. &#x2026; I mean to look at Graham&#x2019;s Farm some of these days.&#x201D; Moat is 2 miles NE of Dunscore. Restow halo is untraced.</note>&#x2014; If you think seriously of America, I will write to John Greig<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-08/lt-18360205-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1836-02-05">5 Feb.</date></ref></note> (I once spoke of him, he is from Moffat), a powerful man in <pb id="pg-09-98" n="09:98"/>New York State: he may be able to do you all a service. It seems to me I shall be there, one day, myself. God direct you! God go with us all, whithersoever our course lies.&#x2014;&#x2014; I am better today, a little farther; and have done a bit of a Task, with headache much subdued: I am now for out; in spite of the <foreign><hi rend="italic">glar</hi></foreign> [mud]. Jane sends her kind remembrances and regards, especially to Jenny and the <foreign>Bairns</foreign>. <closer><salute>God be with you, dear Brother.</salute></closer></p>
<name>T. Carlyle</name>
<ps><p>That is my last letter out of America; that one from Emerson: one of the best people seemingly I have ever met with. You can read it, and give it to my Mother. His place is New England; you will find it in the Map.</p>
<p>Jane&#x2019;s headache too is improving today. Farewell again one and all of you!</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Your Letter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> came four days ago; very greatly desired: I do not remember that I had been so anxious to hear from you. The Avignon Letter to our Mother came, indeed, and all the Newspapers came duly; but it seemed to me long, after the date of your Marseilles embarkation; the winter winds were piping loud:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. &#x201C;Il Penseroso,&#x201D; 1. 126.</note> my turbid humour suggested to me ever and anon that something had befallen. Let us thank Heaven that it is all right at last. We are very lucky even in regard to Letters. Mill, while he was abroad in that Geneva, Nice and Lago-di-Como region, could not get the smallest particle of written intelligence from home: &#x2018;ten Letters&#x2019; were sent for him, to various Post-offices; and he did not receive so much as one. The people here had granted him three months more of absence too; but till he reached Paris, he could not hear of it; and then it was too late. He returned <pb id="pg-09-99" n="09:99"/>about a fortnight ago; seemingly very considerably recovered, but, as he says, without the hope of recovering completely for the present.&#x2014; Pepoli, I ought to mention also, had got tidings, by some curious roundabout road, several weeks ago, that the Packet you were to take to Bologna had got safe thither: apparently by some side-conveyance. Pepoli is now at Paris, these two weeks; looking after some new Opera<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Pepoli had written the libretto for <hi rend="italic">Malek Adel</hi>, a new opera by M. A. A.

<p>And so your large Brass Plate is up in the Piazza di Spagna; and all is settled so far! I trust it may produce fruit; and be the beginning of a better era for us. The times are still too uncertain for you; but we will hope the best as to Cholera and all things: chiefly, let us endeavour to <hi rend="italic">do</hi> the task. I pitied, many times, your waste wanderings; and waitings for these Spaurs;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Count Karl and Countess Th&#xE9;r&#xE8;se von Spaur, friends of Lady Clare&#x2019;s; see also <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370707-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1837-07-07">7 July 1837</date></ref>.</note> but all is well that ends well. You are in your own four-walls, at any rate; and have your head on your shoulders, and your ten fingers on your arms: we will wait cheerily for what the winter will bring.&#x2014; Did you get two Newspapers (I think)? I sent off a third, an <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, this very night; that you might try fairly. They cost two-pence here; and the office-people seemed to make no scruple that they would go. I am not sure that I did not forget the <hi rend="italic">two strokes</hi>; having made my wrappage in haste; but, so long as all <hi rend="italic">is</hi> well, I will not forget them again. For this last month, I have purchased an <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> from the Newsman here, for my Mother, and send it generally by Manchester; Hunt&#x2019;s having grown very irregular. Would you like <hi rend="italic">it;</hi> or another Paper better? Let us know what the fortune of the venture has been, and what we are to do about it in future. Also whether you can send <hi rend="italic">me</hi> no Newspaper, once a fortnight or so? With two strokes on it! For I am atrabiliar enough.</p>
<p>Your Avignon Letter was forwarded without delay; the Roman Letter<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Neither letter has been found.</note> I also bagged into a big frank Taylor had got me, with a great sheef of other Letters; directed to Alick: happily it was not sealed, when there came a long Annandale Letter from him. He reports most favourably of our Mother&#x2019;s health, and of the health of all. They have had such a Harvest, and have such times, in other respects, as man seldom saw. <foreign>Stooks</foreign> are out rotting, covered with snow; there came a <pb id="pg-09-100" n="09:100"/>frost in <date when="1836-10-00">October</date>, and destroyed fully a fourth of the Potatoes, a bad crop at any rate: trade threatened to stagger in the Country, and the money market: it is one of the sorriest outlooks.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi>, <date when="1836-11-30">30 Nov.</date>, noted that harvest might take 100 days from beginning to end instead of the usual 35 days.</note> Jamie, however, individually had got his stuff gathered in, and had rather a good crop of it. Our Mother, as I said, sat snug and well. There had come &#xa3;5 from the India Bishop Corrie for poor John that died; of which Mr Clyde was to write me.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-08/lt-18360218-TC-JCA-01">TC to JCA, <date when="1836-02-18">18 Feb.</date></ref></note>&#x2014; Poor Alick himself avowed that all went cross with him. His pork-gains had been swallowed up by perverse cattle-speculations: in a time of dearth he remained without wages for his labour; thoroughly at a loss which way to turn. He had been over to Cockermouth, at some fair, and seen our Brother John; who with other Cumberland neighbours were clear for New York next spring; and strongly advised him with them. I could not but chime in with the same advise, tho&#x2019; I did not like to give it direct. My growing persuasion is that Alick ought verily to go to New York: perhaps, as you say, may we not all have to go thither? If he did think of going he was to write, and I would communicate with John Greig about it. I doubt his money is perhaps worn lowish, at least <hi rend="italic">lower;</hi> but I do not doubt that you, for example, would help him with a little. I know few men in his way that have been more snubbed than poor Alick. One&#x2019;s heart gives a kind of bound to think that there <hi rend="italic">is</hi> a land under the sun, where if a man plough for corn he shall actually reap it. Alick had some vague eye to some dirty clout of Moss Farm belonging to Tom Grahame; but this I decidedly counselled him to have nothing to do with. You had better write to him?</p>
<p>These are the Annandale news. Now as to ourselves at Chelsea. The miserably bad weather has combined with other perplexities to shackle me a little: nevertheless I still hold on. A certain Painter Lewis (he is the Scotchman I once talked of giving a line to you at Rome) came down hither shortly after I wrote last, and insisted on taking my Portrait, &#x2018;to put in the Exhibition,&#x2019; and do himself good with; the thing to be ours after that. By Jane&#x2019;s urgency and his, I assented to sit; this, on alternate days, eat the heart out of three weeks for me. He has made a great glaring likeness; rather unlovely to me: it will probably go to Templand to hang ultimately. During all this time, a dirty catarrhal feeling hung over me, which I beat back once by shower-bath. Seizing its advantage, however, it returned in the shape <pb id="pg-09-101" n="09:101"/>of a decided cold. Blue pill and senna: the cold retired. Alas, the next foggy-frost it rallied again: <hi rend="italic">recipe</hi> once more, as above: which <hi rend="italic">second</hi> recipe proved really too hard for me; and I have as good as forsworn senna for a twelve month to come! There fixed itself such an inexpressible dead nausea, and <hi rend="italic">taste</hi> of senna, in the stomach of me; and in the head, now all dried up from being a very fountain, it went pulsing and hammering! So that when I attempted to write, it grew a very Vulcan&#x2019;s smithy (in the language of poetic-licence), and I had to sit in the house, doing nothing. Last Sunday I burst out, right-side of the brow beating and thumping; dashed desperately thro&#x2019; the fields towards Harrow for the space of four hours; drew our last Madeira bottle at my return; and <hi rend="italic">determined</hi> to be well. Ever since the thing has been gradually leaving me: these three last days I have done a kind of Task, and today I did a long one. Courage, Boy! There dwells still a most unneighbourly taste and smell in the interior of my head somewhere; so that morning coffee is quite spoiled to me: nevertheless I have recovered appetite, and feel about as well as usual: able for work, which is of itself much. I have not above <hi rend="italic">thirty pages</hi> to write; am on the last Chapter but one: Courage, Courage! I can still hope for daylight about the Newyear time; then two months more for printing; then&#x2014;! You will be gratified to hear that I meditate much on your suggestion of dividing the thing into small sections; and think I shall do it.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >What Carlyle had hitherto called &#x201C;Chapters&#x201D; became &#x201C;Books&#x201D; with a subdivision into short chapters.</note> What were the prophecies of Isaiah for example, if we had it not in <hi rend="italic">chapters!</hi> Let me add three other facts of a somewhat similar tenor: first, that I actually wear foot-straps to my trousers; second, that I have adopted your old braces, with the two buttons in front, and find them comfortable; third, that I frequently enough go your bye-road (by the Church region) towards Sloane street, having on reflexion found it <hi rend="italic">not</hi> absurd! On <hi rend="italic">reflexion</hi>, you see, there is a grain of reason in me.&#x2014; As to scribble, I will only add farther that Fraser has the <hi rend="italic">D. Necklace</hi> all printed, with Notes; to come out, by way of <hi rend="italic">splash</hi> I fancy, on Newyearsday: that Mill&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Mirabeau</hi> will likewise come then; and perhaps (if his promise keep good, which is not certain) the other little <hi rend="italic">Hist. Parlementaire</hi> thing in the same Number.<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Mirabeau&#x201D; came out in <date when="1837-01-00">Jan. 1837</date>, &#x2018;The Diamond Necklace&#x201D; in <date when="1837-01-00">Jan.</date> and <date when="1837-02-00">Feb.</date>, and the &#x201C;Parliamentary History&#x201D; not until <date when="1837-04-00">April</date>.</note> Mill is very anxious to get me to write more in time coming: I answer <pb id="pg-09-102" n="09:102"/>vaguely; being about disgusted with the beggarly trade, tho&#x2019; not knowing well what else to try. I had a very kind Letter from Emerson the American lately: he has lost an excellent younger Brother very suddenly, but takes it in a most gentle devout manner. A little Book of his called <hi rend="italic">Nature</hi> (really of fine spirit, and insight here and there) has come since; with a new copy of <hi rend="italic">Teufel</hi>k. The Edition of T. it seems is sold off. This copy I despatched instantly to Hamburg; to a certain Mr Parish who used to be my <foreign><hi rend="italic">Spedite</hi><supplied>[<hi rend="italic">u</hi>]</supplied><hi rend="italic">r</hi></foreign> [Shipping agent] to Goethe. If I can find a chance for Rome; you shall undoubtedly have these two pieces I spoke of above. Perhaps Rennie may be able to tell me of some man; but I doubt it.</p>
<p>There was a strange visiter [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] called here one day: Miss Martineau, the Poetess Political Economist! She is not half so ill-favoured as they represented her; indeed not ill-favoured at all; but a rather interesting woman: very shrewd, and very good; of the Unitarian friend-of-humanity species. She is deaf as a Post, but carries an ear trumpet, and manages quite handsomely. She has been to America, you know; and is now winnowing out the fruit of her harvest there. I have been to see her since; and mean to go back: a mouthful of talk even approaching to rational is not to be des<supplied>[pised]</supplied> in this city and time. For the rest I calculate on going to almost no Parties; to nothing that will hurt my health or hold me back in the thing that has now become sole business in England for me. To the goal! to the goal! &#x201C;Lick for lash thro&#x2019; the Rickergate and o&#x2019;er the Stanwix, lick for lash!&#x201D;<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >An unidentified person&#x2019;s phrase about a drive from Rickergate, a township within Carlisle, over the river Eden to Stanwix, a village nearby.</note>&#x2014; Charles Buller has been sick in Switzerland, but is better: they were expected home before this time; but whether they have come I know not. Poor Cavaignac&#x2019;s sister died (suddenly to him), and we have not seen him for a fortnight. The Doctor had been made to write that there was no danger; and so the fact fell like a bolt from the blue. He was hardly to be held from running to Paris at all risks. His Mother is coming over hither.&#x2014; John Sterling got your Avignon Letter; as he has announced to his Mother here: but it came too late for his hitting you with an answer. Before that, he had written to me, in great spirits this time; and ordered that I was to tell you he might probably enough still strike off for Pisa (I think) in Spring, and ultimately see you in Rome after all. It will be a great joy to both of you. He takes very well with Bourdeaux as yet; reads, writes; says he is &#x2018;giving up his Theology and Philosophy&#x2019; a little; which I rejoice much <pb id="pg-09-103" n="09:103"/>to hear of.

I do not think Austin will make much of that, or indeed of anything, being a thoroughly lamed man. Mill I have spoken of already: he has shifted into a cheaper house in Kensington Square; looks much clearer: I have seen him only once. The <hi rend="italic">Platonica</hi>,<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mrs. Taylor.</note> I think, was with him; her we have not seen at all. Morris [Maurice] was here once; as <foreign><hi rend="italic">spitzfindig</hi></foreign> [subtle], fidgeting, ingenious-unproductive as ever. Willis we have not seen; his wife Jane and I did meet one day in Piccadilly: he is in Dover Street (I think), has got two medical Pupils; and doubtless tries to adjust himself. Allan Cunningham was here about a fortnight ago; <hi rend="italic">guffawing</hi> in the old Nithsdale way; without result.

We see very little of Hunt; he has colds, headaches; a cheerful-sad look: he is to write for Mill&#x2019;s Review. Is this all my news? I will honestly give it up for this night; and fill gaps tomorrow: I am very wearied; I did not get out at all till after dinner, but scribbled, scribbled. I then ran, wrapt in cloak, by Pimlico thro&#x2019; Belgrave Square to the Park Corner and back; it did my cold no ill. Today we have wind, with occasional wet. This week we had a wind-storm, truly hurricanish; it blew down chimneys in the Strand &#x26;c; it was in the forenoon, and I doubt must have hurt lives: there were trees uprooted, and wreckage everywhere when I went out. Then came frost-fogs; <hi rend="italic">glazing</hi> you with soot; till the face stiffens under it, and you curse your day! Patience, Patience. I march inwardly humming often these words you taught me of Goethe&#x2019;s: <foreign>Stille / Ruhn oben die Sterne / Und unten die Gr&#xE4;ber</foreign>:<note n="15" place="bottom" type="gloss" >From &#x201C;Symbolum,&#x201D; translated as &#x201C;Mason-Lodge&#x201D; by Carlyle; &#x201C;Stars silent rest o&#x2019;er us, / Graves under us silent&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, X, 237).</note> they are more like a Psalm than any I have.</p>

<salute>My dear Mill,</salute>
<p>It is perhaps the briefest way, my haste being great, to <hi rend="italic">send</hi> you this Note of Hunt&#x2019;s.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> He seems to persist in <hi rend="italic">Wortley</hi> as the decidedly best, and makes out no other List. He understands that you can get him a loan of the Book from the Publisher, who is Bentley. My notion is that you should indulge him; that he will make you a very pretty Article on Wortley.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mill replied the next day: &#x201C;Let it be Wortley by all means, &#x26; I will immediately get the book&#x201D; (Mineka, XIII, 743).</note> The beckoning of one&#x2019;s own inward wish is generally the best of all indications. For the rest, would it not be well that you saw Hunt? Or is that superfluous? He is accessible I believe almost any evening that you like,&#x2014;and close by me.</p>
<p>Cavaignac and Marrast came; C. looking a little less sorrowful than on Sunday. He did not appoint any other night; but will be back <pb id="pg-09-106" n="09:106"/>soon; and you shall have warning. It is a wild matter Death; to a man of his <foreign><hi rend="italic">Credo</hi></foreign>.</p>

Would it interfere with you much to have at least Four of them ready <hi rend="italic">at Christmas</hi>, or the day after, for me? I want to send them into Scotland; and have no method except by the Magazines (thro&#x2019; Simpkin &#x26; Marshal),<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Publishers and Booksellers, 4 Stationers&#x2019; Hall Court.</note> which of course are all under way by the time a Number by the regular course can reach me here.</p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>It would give me much pleasure to meet you again; and I surely hope we shall,&#x2014;if not by the kind plan you propose, yet by some other that will offer itself.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-09-107" n="09:107"/>At present I am so excessively occupied, and independently of that, nay indeed partly by reason of that, in such an inflammatory, catarrhal, atrabiliar state of health, that I dare not venture out at night except under manifold conditions.</p>

<salute>My dear Jean,</salute>
<p>Tho&#x2019; it seems uncertain on what day you may receive this, our roads being all blocked with snow, yet I may as well send it off according to promise: very probably you expect it about this time; I have a little leisure today, and may not have so much tomorrow. Franks, I doubt, are uncertain at this un-Parliamentary time; but I have taken one of the longest sheets that can be written on; we will make His Majesty do the most we can for his money.</p>
<p>It is a weary long time since I have written to you, or heard from you: never in my days did I write fewer Letters; I have no heart to write to anybody, if it be not on some instant compulsion of business. Not that I have forgotten any Friend I ever had; nay perhaps you are all oftener and more vividly in my memory than usual: but in this pressure of foreign things round me, my head kept full of one weary work and thought, I can do nothing but passively remember and send silent good wishes: to write seems as if <supplied>[it]</supplied> were an <hi rend="italic">impossibility</hi>. Courage, however! We shall get the thing done, with the <foreign><hi rend="italic">gea</hi></foreign> [vigour] of life in us still; then come freer days, and matters take their old cour<supplied>[se.]</supplied></p>
<p>Yesterday I sent off a small bundle of Papers addressed to <pb id="pg-09-108" n="09:108"/><supplied>[M&#x2019;Kie,?]</supplied> the Dumfries Bookseller.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John M&#x2019;Kie (see <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340311-TC-JMK-01"><sic>7:113</sic><corr>TC to JMK, <date when="1834-03-11">11 March 1834</date></corr></ref>).</note> The Carriage-cost ought not to exceed fi<supplied>[ve-pence]</supplied> by Mail,&#x2014;when Mails <hi rend="italic">can</hi> come. I suppose they will struggle <supplied>[through?]</supplied> by and by. If the carriage be above five-pence I advise James <supplied>[to leave?]</supplied> the thing <supplied>[lying?]</supplied> and let M&#x2019;Kie keep it; for indeed it is worth little. You are to understand that a certain Article <hi rend="italic">Mirabeau</hi>, which has been spoken of sufficiently, is actually printed and to come forth in some three days; of which also they have promised me a few Separate Copies: but on applying for said Separate Copies, it appeared that they could not be had till <hi rend="italic">after</hi> the Article was published. All that <hi rend="italic">could</hi> be had in the interim was an ugly monster of a Proof-sheet of the thing; incorrect, defective, dirty; yet still partly legible: this, in defect of better, is what I have sent. Two Copies of this, without note or comment, is what James will receive from M&#x2019;Kie: one copy is for yourselves, the other is for my Mother. Had I waited another day, there was no conveyance for a month to come. Be content therefore with what you get! Next month, please Heaven, you shall get better copies: in the interim you can read these, and then light your pipes with them. In Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine there is farther to appear a Piece by me, called the <hi rend="italic">Diamond Necklace;</hi> but only the <hi rend="italic">half</hi> of it, this ensuing month; the next half not till <date when="1837-02-00">February</date>: of this not so much as a proofsheet could be had. But you shall get a copy of this too; I hope, by M&#x2019;Kie&#x2019;s <date when="1837-02-00">February</date> Parcel. Nay, not long after, if all go right, there will follow a Copy of <hi rend="italic">the Book</hi> itself! Of which, with my whole heart, I shall wish you and the degenerate Posterity of Adam joy.</p>
<p>I <hi rend="italic">have sent</hi> the First Chapter of that everlasting Book actually to the Printer! They have done nothing at it yet, all the men being &#x2018;engaged in drinking&#x2019; at this season of the year; besides that, there are some formalities as to type, shape, &#x26;c to be settled: but this once managed, we shall go along <foreign>skrieving</foreign> [scurrying], I hope; and wash our hands of the whole <date when="1837-03-00">early in March</date>. The Third Volume was brought up <hi rend="italic">to be as large</hi> as either of the preceding some two days ago: nevertheless it is not yet finished off; it is only like the sole of a stocking (in the hands of a Knitter) made ready for <hi rend="italic">taking in:</hi> one brief Chapter will rapidly close it now; this I shall expect to do very handsomely while the printing proceeds. Wherefore you will all wish me &#x201C;whole hands&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> for other two months; and after that, &#x201C;joy&#x201D; of being freed from the ugliest labour I ever went thro&#x2019; since <pb id="pg-09-109" n="09:109"/>I knew this world. A deliverance equal to that of Christian when his Burden fell off him (in the <hi rend="italic">Pilgrim&#x2019;s Progress</hi>), and he saw it bounding down hill, every leap longer than the last,&#x2014;down to (I suppose) <hi rend="small-caps">perdition</hi>, where it had arisen from.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Pilgrim&#x2019;s Progress</hi>, ed. J. B. Wharey, revised R. Sharrock (Oxford, <date when="1960-00-00">1960</date>), p. 38.</note> Or perhaps only to <hi rend="italic">Tchawos</hi>, a place known to James&#x2019;s old Schoolmaster?<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Chaos, as pronounced by the old schoolmaster; see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18351204-TC-JCA-01">TC to JCA, <date when="1835-12-04">4 Dec. 1835</date></ref>.</note>&#x2014;</p>
<p>After this, I had resolutely determined on having some rest; and am still determined, tho&#x2019; all should go to <foreign><hi rend="italic">Crowdie</hi></foreign> [thin porridge]: but some people here will have it that I should deliver a brief course of Lectures, say on <hi rend="italic">German Literature;</hi> in a place called the Royal Institution,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >21 Albemarle St., Piccadilly, originally founded in <date when="1799-00-00">1799</date>, &#x201C;for teaching, by courses of philosophical lectures and experiments, the application of science to the common purposes of life,&#x201D; contained a laboratory, museum and library as well as a lecture theatre. The lectures were not given there as it turned out to be fully booked (see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370217-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1837-02-17">17 Feb. 1837</date></ref>).</note> <supplied>[where]</supplied> all manner of fashionable people gather in the spring months to hear such! As I <supplied>[believe]</supplied> Book-writing to be utterly in a ruined state for all men except quacks at pre<supplied>[sent I am]</supplied> inclined to experiment likewise on this Lecturing business, and see<supplied>[. If t]</supplied>he preliminaries, therefore, be not all-too absurd (for there are Committee-<supplied>[men to deal]</supplied> with, and my temper at this time is none of the oiliest), it seems quite possible I m<supplied>[ay lecture]</supplied>:<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The words in square brackets from &#x201C;As I <supplied>[believe]</supplied>&#x201D; to this point are conjectural; the MS is badly torn.</note> it will not cost me much trouble, for I mean to speak the Lectures (having grown ill-haired [ill-tempered], and impudent enough for that), and there is tolerable payment; and more, an introduction to more extensive enterprise of the like. We shall see, we shall see! It will depend very considerably on what spirits I feel myself in when the time comes. As yet the whole cry is, Print, Print! We will wind up that; and <hi rend="italic">then</hi>.</p>
<p>As for health, I ought to say that it is wonderfully good, considering all. Some weeks I had a disagreeable cold, with headaches; but time and walking drove it off; and now again I hang together as well as others do, for everybody is complaining. Jane too, tho&#x2019; never strong, shifts forward better or worse; with, I think, fewer headaches than last year. We live in hope of the spring: always in hope! It has been, as with you, the worst weather ever seen, either &#x201C;for ripening corn or win&#x2019;ning hay.&#x201D; Cold fogs and smoke; splashings, rain, mist and frost. On Sunday morning last, after a preparation <pb id="pg-09-110" n="09:110"/>of Northwind the day before, we found it snowing; a thing rather unusual here. It was a hearty snow, however; howling, and wreathing itself, in a way that would have done honour to Craigenputtoch. It has dribbled and powdered away, almost ever since; no mails come in: we heard yesterday that the Brighton Mail had come in; but three passengers were missing, and the driver had died by the way!<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Based on a report in the <hi rend="italic">Standard</hi>, evening of <date when="1836-12-27">27 Dec.</date>, that the guard on the Sunday coach, <date when="1836-12-25">25 Dec.</date>, from Brighton, who had gone to fetch help when the coach was stopped by snow, returned to find no sign of the coach, coachman, or the three passengers. However the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, <date when="1836-12-28">28 Dec.</date>, quoting this report, indicated that the coachman and three passengers had been found and had to stay at Clayton, only seven miles from Brighton, leaving the coach in its snowdrift.</note> With you, it cannot well be better but worse; I suppose the whole country to lie sheeted in snow, one knows not for how long. London looks very curious; there is such a silence in it, the wheel-vehicles making no noise, very few of them indeed being out, the horses make such sprawling; many persons drunk at any rate, and a few others (not a fifth part of the usual numbers) tripping along muffled in cloaks, with blue noses. The citizens fling their snow from the roofs, the policemen forbidding it or not. Omnibuses lumber along, occasionally with springs broken; the horses smoking, sometimes <foreign><hi rend="italic">reested</hi></foreign> [stopped] altogether. Five men sung out in our street yesterday morning, as if the end of the world had arrived: &#x201C;Poo Gawnas (Poor Gardners!) Poo Gawnas! All froze <hi rend="italic">out!</hi>&#x201D; &#x2014;they had a huge cabbage-stock elevated on a pole by way of standard, and were begging with their whole heart and their whole soul, &#x201C;Poo Gawnas! Poo Gawnas!&#x201D; I could not help bursting into laughing at the zeal of them: they had but been &#x201C;froze out&#x201D; for <hi rend="italic">two days;</hi> and they seemed, by the sound of them, as if victual were a thing they had only heard of by tradition.&#x2014;Coals are greatly risen; the poor improvident people are like to be ill off.</p>
<p>There is no lack of socialities, parties &#x26;c: but I will <supplied>[not]</supplied> trouble with that. We go hardly to any: Jane has just been at <hi rend="italic">one</hi> since she returned. It was Miss Martineau&#x2019;s (the Literary Lady&#x2019;s who writes on Political Economy): great multitudes were there; a certain Mrs Butler (once Fanny Kemble)<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Fanny Kemble (<date when="1809-00-00">1809</date>&#x2013;<date when="1893-00-00">93</date>), actress, writer; she had married Pierce Butler of Philadelphia in <date when="1834-00-00">1834</date> and divorced him in <date when="1848-00-00">1848</date>.</note> was the heroine of the evening. She is but a dingy kind of heroine;&#x2014;as if <hi rend="italic">Craw Jean</hi><note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jean&#x2019;s childhood nickname.</note> were reduced six inches in stature, pitted with small pox, and washed with a thin coating of soot-water,&#x2014;and worst of all, the natural sense of h<supplied>[er <pb id="pg-09-111" n="09:111"/>tor]</supplied>tured into a wiredrawn theatrical <hi rend="italic">crotchetism!</hi> Would not that be a heroine? This <supplied>[cele]</supplied>brated Mrs Butler has called on <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, one day, most unexpectedly with some present of an A<supplied>[meri]</supplied>can Book. She came in riding-habit with cap and whip: Anne did not announce her properly; Jane (on coming home) rebuked Anne; Anne, apologizing, &#x201C;didna <foreign>ken</foreign> whether it was a Leddy or a Gentleman&#x201D;! I am to go and return the visit of this <supplied>[celebrated Mrs]</supplied> Butler, and then I think our intercourse may as well terminate.&#x2014; The <supplied>[celeb]</supplied>rated men here, above all, the celebrated women, are a class of mortals whom I get a<supplied>[lmost no]</supplied> good of <hi rend="italic">at all, at all</hi>.</p>
<p>A Roman Newspaper arrived from Jack on Saturday last with two strokes on it: a sign that he has got my Letter, and is well. I sent a token of it, to Mary I think. My Mother sent me a Letter,<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1836-12-07">7 Dec.</date></note> since I wrote to Alick: that is the last news I have from Scotland. Tell my Mother, I was right thankful to her: the Letter is a most <foreign><hi rend="italic">feat</hi></foreign> [clever] Letter, the only fault that it was not longer. Jamie also and Isabella shall be paid for their Postscript. I will hope that all continues as that left it, at Scotsbrig: I endeavour to banish away uncertain apprehension; tho&#x2019; surely evil is at all times possible. You now must write to me, and with unusual minuteness. I hope to see you all with the first rush of Summer: till then the longest Letter will be the welcomest. James must take my ineffectual thanks in return for the effectual gift he sent me:<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Tobacco (see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18360724-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1836-07-24">24 July</date></ref>).</note> I smoked over it many a week; it seemed to be better than what I could get here: perhaps because it was older;&#x2014;or perhaps the air of Scotland in it had improved it&#x2014;for me?&#x2014; I know not what the name of your little child is (nor of Alick&#x2019;s, nor of Jamie&#x2019;s).<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Carlyle Aitken, Janet Carlyle, and John Carlyle (James and Isabella&#x2019;s second son), three weeks younger than Janet.</note> I hope it is thriving, poor little thing: keep it warm, in whole webs of flannel, during such weather! How does James get on? The last report I heard of him was every way good. But it is a difficult time this, for a man in what line soever. Keep a cheerful heart and a courageous! The eye is then clear, and the hand ready. In all cases, this is one&#x2019;s sure chance.&#x2014; Alick seemed to be uncertain which way he would turn when I last heard from him. Do not forget to tell me specially about him; to remind him of my <hi rend="italic">constant</hi> desire to hear from him. I suppose him to be in the Bacon business again; a man must put out his hand. America wears a grim look to me, when it comes near the point! Courage! And God assist us all to <hi rend="italic">see</hi> clearly <pb id="pg-09-112" n="09:112"/>what is best, and to do it bravely!&#x2014; I send this as a general New Year&#x2019;s wish to you first, and thro&#x2019; you to one and all. You will convey my brotherly salutation, to Scotsbrig, to Annan; as if I had named every one of the household. I hope it will be there before <hi rend="italic">old</hi> Newyears day at any rate: my <hi rend="italic">wishes</hi> will surely be there; no thickness of snow can keep out them. Jane is this moment come in from a walk in the frost and snow-powder, in time to join her salutation. I must now out, with this; and will send it off, frank or no frank. Write to me soon, as I said, and very copiously; taking leisure hours, as you can find them. Has my Mother her Beer-keg still? Pray look to this. I beg you all to keep on good fires; and sit as thankful and hearty as you can. <closer><salute>God&#x2019;s blessing be with every one of you!&#x2014; Ever your affectionate Brother,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Mill,</salute>
<p>There had nothing come to Fraser&#x2019;s, on Saturday night, when I went to inquire: the Review had come hither in the interim. I begin now to suppose that these <hi rend="italic">Copies</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of &#x201C;Mirabeau.&#x201D;</note> have never been printed. Perhaps four, or three, were still procurable from the waste sheets still lingering in the Printing Office? If not, let them go,&#x2014;and <hi rend="italic">not</hi> take our good humour with them. We will mention them no more.</p>
<p>Leigh Hunt, whenever I saw him, for the last fortnight or more, was in a flutter of joyful expectancy about his <hi rend="italic">Wortley:</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-09/lt-18361125-TC-JSM-01">TC to JSM, [<date when="1836-11-25">25 Nov. 1836</date>]</ref>.</note> he is now grown quite <hi rend="italic">monosyllabic</hi>, my Wife tells me; the thing having never come. It is a great pity that errors of <hi rend="italic">this</hi> kind should be committed; which can be so easily avoided; which do more mischief than one is apt to imagine. The avoiding of them not only costs no labour but saves labour, a little tincture of Method being introduced, and sluggardliness flung out. I learn with satisfaction that you have it in view to change your <hi rend="italic">Personnel:</hi> the Printer<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Clowes and Sons, 14 Charing Cross (see <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310914-TC-JWC-01"><sic>5:429</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1831-09-14">14 Sept. 1831</date></corr></ref>). From <date when="1837-04-00">April</date> the <hi rend="italic">Review</hi> was printed by C. and W. Reynell, 16 Little Pultency Street. Mill continued to have trouble with the printers after the change (see Mineka, XII, 339). For the resignation of the editor, see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18361020-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1836-10-20">20 Oct. 1836</date></ref>.</note> also (Printer&#x2019;s Foreman) seems <pb id="pg-09-113" n="09:113"/>a great blockhead; makes the ugliest errors, on the whole the most sluttish printing I have seen.</p>
<p>Molesworth&#x2019;s Article<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Terms of Alliance between Radicals and Whigs,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">London and Westminster Review</hi>, XXVI (<date when="1837-01-00">Jan. 1837</date>), 279&#x2013;318.</note> pleases me very considerably. It has a sound spirit in it, resolute, temperate, quiet. Napier<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Napier, &#x201C;Reply to the Third Article in the Quarterly Review on, Colonel Napier&#x2019;s History of the Peninsula War,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">London and Westminster Review</hi>, pp. 541&#x2013;81.</note> is strong, but a little savage or so: he does not grow with me so fast as I could wish, the more I learn of him.

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Certain kind friends are very urgent with me to set about giving a short course of lectures on German literature in the Albemarle Street <pb id="pg-09-114" n="09:114"/>Institution;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-09/lt-18361229-TC-JCA-01">TC to JCA, <date when="1836-12-29">29 Dec. 1836</date></ref>.</note> that is the thing for me, they say, &#x26;c. &#x26;c. Without saying yes or no, I determine to ask about it a little. Remembering that you once took me there, I suppose you to be a member; and knowing what otherwise I know, it seems to me I can inquire of no one so fitly as of you. Will you tell me, therefore, something about the conditions and arrangements of such a business in that Institution? How you get liberty to deliver a course there; whether you fancy liberty were easily procurable for me; what the pecuniary <hi rend="italic">result</hi> is; how you think the enterprise will answer? Whatsoever you say on it will illustrate it for me; as at present I am altogether dark.</p>
<p>If you do not know of yourself, then surely you of all men can the most easily get to know; and no less surely you of all (satirical splenetic) men are the readiest to oblige a man.</p>
<p>When you have time to write answer, pray pack up the Quarterlies along with it; send your Famulus into Fleet Street, and he will see a Chelsea omnibus; the cad [omnibus conductor] will bring it me for sixpence within an hour.</p>
<p>I am still busy, but shall see King&#x2019;s Bench Walk<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For descriptions of Hayward&#x2019;s Chambers and his entertaining at 11 King&#x2019;s Bench Walk, in the Temple, where he had moved in <date when="1836-00-00">1836</date>, see <hi rend="italic">A Selection from the Correspondence of Abraham Hayward</hi>, I, 53&#x2013;56.</note> by-and-bye.

<p><salute>My dear Miss Wilson,&#x2014;</salute> Mrs. Carlyle was to have written to you yesterday that we would come: but she was taken with a cold and coughing, which she apprehends to be this Influenza.

<p>For on the whole the getting of a <hi rend="italic">place</hi> to lecture in is not the difficulty: the getting of a subject to lecture <hi rend="italic">on</hi>, and of a heart and impudence and general disposition to lecture at all,&#x2014;that is the difficulty.

<salute>My dear Sterling,</salute>
<p>This New-year&#x2019;s wish which I now send you is a pleasure to myself I have long looked forward to. Ever since your Letter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1836-10-26">26 Oct. 1836</date>.</note> came I have said to myself, were this malison of a Book done, I will write to John. Nay perhaps John will write to me a second time on credit in the interim? His Letter is like a warm sun-glance and breath of the South in this dreary London Fog!&#x2014; John has not written a second time on credit;&#x2014;which who could ask him to do? But here is this Book actually tied up under packthread, the burning Nessus&#x2019; Shirt<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-08/lt-18351102-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1835-11-02">2 Nov. 1835</date></ref>.</note> stript off one: and so now in a state of comfortable nudity and frigescence<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlylean neologism for &#x201C;coolness.&#x201D;</note> we write to him.</p>
<p>Do you know the Scottish word <hi rend="italic"><foreign>threep</foreign>?</hi><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A vehement affirmation or vow.</note> I had taken a <foreign><hi rend="italic">threep</hi></foreign> <pb id="pg-09-116" n="09:116"/>that I would write to no one, that I would not quit London, or know any rest satisfaction or pleasure of life till the despicability of a task were done. I declare, no man was ever so near being drowned, according to another Scotch Phrase, &#x201C;in a spoonful of water&#x201D;!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Untraced.</note>&#x2014;However, as I said, it is over: five days ago I finished, about ten o&#x2019;clock at night; and really was ready both to weep and to pray,&#x2014;but did not do either, at least not visibly or audibly. The Bookseller has it, and the Printer has it; I expect the first sheet tomorrow: in not many weeks more, I can hope to wash my hands of it forever and a day. It is a thing disgusting to me by the faults of it; the merits of which, for it is not without merits, will not be seen for a long time. It is a wild savage Book, itself a kind of French Revolution;&#x2014;which perhaps, if Providence have so ordered it, the world had better <hi rend="italic">not</hi> accept when offered it? With all my heart! What I do know of it is that it has come hot out of my own soul; born in blackness whirlwind and sorrow; that no man, for a long while, has stood speaking so completely alone under the Eternal Azure, in the character of man only; or is likely for a long while so to stand:&#x2014;finally that it has gone as near to choking the life out of me as any task I should like to undertake for some years to come; which also is an immense comfort, indeed the greatest of all.&#x2014; To wind up this part of the business, I may tell you that the Article <hi rend="italic">Mirabeau</hi> is published, and a thing called <hi rend="italic">Diamond Necklace</hi> is publishing (the latter in Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine); and that the &#x201C;Country Newspapers,&#x201D; as Fraser tells me, express extreme dissatisfaction. I shall have a separate Copy of each, in few days, for you; and leave it at Kinghtsbridge: and see <hi rend="italic">you</hi> then, if you dare for the life of you join with the Country Newspapers! Like a recreant, as you&#x2014;are <hi rend="italic">not</hi> altogether! We will now therefore turn a new leaf.</p>
<p>The news we get from Belsito, which one way and another come tolerably often, are for most part of a very favourable kind. Allowing that you study to shade for us a little the shady parts, we have still great reason to be thankful. Keep your heart quiet, my Friend; learn the great art of <hi rend="italic">resting:</hi> there is positively nothing else you want to bring you <hi rend="italic">all</hi> manner of good. But you do want that; you must learn it and acquire it that is the task set you at this time. My Brother&#x2019;s news of you are that your account of your health is not so good as he expected; that it is still possible he may see you in Rome: his joy for his own sake, not for yours, at such a possibility, again comes to words. When <hi rend="italic">I</hi> am to see you next? It is all uncertain as the wind this <pb id="pg-09-117" n="09:117"/>day twelvemonth; yet surely we shall meet again somewhere under the sun before long. May the Heavens turn it well! I will repeat you again the little song that goes humming thro&#x2019; my head, very frequently in these times; the only modern <hi rend="italic">Psalm</hi><note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Stanzas 2 and 3, 5 and 6 of Goethe&#x2019;s &#x201C;Symbolum&#x201D;; for Carlyle&#x2019;s translation see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, X, 237&#x2013;38.</note> I have met with for long:</p>

<p>It is not a piece of Psalmody that? It seems to me like a piece of marching-music of the great brave Teutonic Kindred as they march thro&#x2019; the waste of <hi rend="small-caps">time</hi>,&#x2014;thro&#x2019; that section of Eternity <hi rend="italic">they</hi> were appointed for; <foreign><hi rend="italic">oben die Sterne</hi></foreign> and <foreign><hi rend="italic">unten die Gr&#xE4;ber</hi></foreign>,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;The stars above&#x201D; and &#x201C;the graves beneath.&#x201D;</note> with the <foreign><hi rend="italic">Stimmen der Geister</hi></foreign>, the <foreign><hi rend="italic">Stimmen der Meister!</hi></foreign><note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;The voices of the Spirit&#x201D; and &#x201C;the voices of the Master.&#x201D;</note> Let us all sing it, and march on cheerful of heart. &#x201C;we bid you hope&#x201D;;<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The last line of &#x201C;Symbolum.&#x201D;</note> so say the voices. Do they not?</p>
<p>One of the announcements you made me was as welcome as any <pb id="pg-09-118" n="09:118"/>other: that you were rather <hi rend="italic">quitting</hi> Philosophy and Theology.<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sterling had said in his letter of <date when="1836-10-26">26 Oct. 1836</date>: &#x201C;I do not know why, but my thoughts have, since I reached this, been running more on History and Poetry than on Theology and Philosophy, more indeed than for years past&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XI, 139).</note> I predict that you will quit them more and more. Not surely till <hi rend="italic">the time;</hi> not till they have done for you what they needed to do. A man can do nothing but prosecute faithfully the thing that his soul points to: let no counsel or cacklement of friends and Country Newspapers slacken him in that: these mean well, but they know not what they say! Nevertheless I will give it you as my decided prognosis (grounded on good medical pathology and auto-pathology) that the two Provinces in question are become Theorem, Brain-web and Shadow; wherein no earnest soul can find solidity for itself. Shadow, I say; yet the Shadow <hi rend="italic">projected</hi> from an everlasting <hi rend="italic">Reality</hi> that is within ourselves: quit the Shadow, seek the Reality,&#x2014;this becomes the hest of one&#x2019;s whole nature by and by.&#x2014; For which reason, when I hear of my dear John getting into History, and writing Poetry, and on the whole worshipping and working in the real genuine Temple of Immensity, I will say to him <foreign><hi rend="italic">Euge</hi></foreign> [Good speed]! Antaeus-like, in the <hi rend="italic">air</hi> one cannot thrive: &#x201C;touch but with thy toe the surface, straightway thou art strong again!&#x201D;&#x2014; For the present I ask Antaeus&#x2019;s pardon, and appeal to Antaeus ten years hence; I see him clenching his fist at me for what I have said here,&#x2014;which nevertheless is as true as Gospel ! Fight away, thou Earth-born; only not with me, who am thy bottle-holder, and faithful, tho&#x2019; thou spurnest my <supplied>[light.]</supplied></p>
<p>No sheet ought to go to Bourdeaux less than half filled with what is called <hi rend="italic">gossip</hi><supplied>[<hi rend="italic">ing</hi>]</supplied>-<hi rend="italic">fractiuncles</hi> of Biography: which far excels any speculation one can hope to hear. My sheet is unhappily near done; and contains nothing but Autobiography.&#x2014; John Mill, as you perhaps know, is home again, in better health, still not in good. I saw him the day before yesterday; sitting desolate under an <hi rend="italic">Influenza</hi> we all have. I on the whole see little of him. He toils greatly in his Review; sore bested with mismanaging Editors, Radical discrepancies, and so forth. His <hi rend="italic">Platonica</hi> and he are constant as ever: innocent I do believe as sucking doves, and yet suffering the clack of tongues, worst penalty of guilt. It is very hard; and for Mill especially as unlucky as ever. The set of people he is in is one&#x2014;that I have to keep out of. No clan of mortals ever profited me less. There is a vociferous platitude in them; a mangy, hungry discontent,&#x2014;their very joy like that of a thing scratching itself under disease of the itch! Mill was infinitely too good <pb id="pg-09-119" n="09:119"/>for them; but he would have it, and his fate would. I love him much; as a friend <hi rend="italic">frozen within ice</hi> for me! Mrs Austin is making great noise in Corfu [Malta: ed.]; giving balls &#x26;c: <foreign><hi rend="italic">&#xE0; la bonne heure</hi></foreign>. I have not seen Taylor for a long time: the last time I saw him was accidentally in the Strand two months ago; when we walked a while together. Solemn and true as ever. He inquired zealously after you: a solemn true man; whom I love much. There has been a critique of his <hi rend="italic">Statesman</hi> in the Edinburgh Review;<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henry Taylor, <hi rend="italic">The Statesman</hi> (London, <date when="1836-00-00">1836</date>), reviewed by James Spedding in the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review</hi>, LXIV (<date when="1836-10-00">Oct. 1836</date>), 201&#x2013;31.</note> setting several things to rights on that head: it was by Spedding; I read some sentences of it, in your Father&#x2019;s Library, and thought it very rational and just. The Statesman is a Reality of its sort, and not a Cobweb; you may trample it a little thro&#x2019; the kennels, and it will still subsist. Miss Fenwick<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350227-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1835-02-27">27 Feb. 1835</date></ref>.</note> is again here; suffering much from our eminently bad winter. Happy you at Belsito! This day, down at Chelsea even, it is yellow all as illscoured brass; at noon, with three windows, hardly light enough: beyond Hyde Park Corner, think what it must be,&#x2014;Erebus, Nox<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >God of Darkness and Goddess of Night, brother and sister.</note> and the great deep of gases, miasmata, soot and despair; bipeds of prey reduced to hunt by torch-light!

He is the loveablest human creature, it seems to me, I have met for a long time. The present company always excepted! A man with such clearness, gentle lambent fire of humanity of him,&#x2014;and not flying out like Aurora-Borealis or sheet-lightning; like some persons I could name! On the whole I congratulate you on such a brother;&#x2014;and really could often wonder where you both came from; a couple of singular fellows in this world: born of the Tornado! Anthony has your Father&#x2019;s eyes tho&#x2019; black, and your voice; he was a strange beautiful vision to me.&#x2014;</p>
<p>My wife is miserably ill today, the <hi rend="italic">third</hi> day of headache and Influenza work. She can say nothing except &#x201C;her love&#x201D;; bids me say whatever I can for her: You are far out when you suppose she has given you up, or ever dreamt of that. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign> my dear Friend! write to me, and love me.

<salute>My dear Jenny,</salute>
<p>It is a long time since I heard directly of you at any length, or since you heard of me. To-day, tho&#x2019; I have not the best disposition or leisure, I will send you a line: there are no franks going, but the post is always going, and you will think a shilling might be worse spent.</p>
<p>We are very sorry, and not without our anxieties, at the short notice Robert sent us on the Newspaper; however, the next week brought confirmation on the favourable side, and I persuade myself to hope that all is getting round again to the right state.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Janet had a miscarriage. She had also been ill the previous winter (see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18351204-TC-JCA-01">TC to JCA, <date when="1835-12-04">4 Dec.</date></ref>, and <ref target="volume-08/lt-18351223-TC-JCHA-01">TC to <sic>JC</sic><corr>JCHA</corr>, <date when="1835-12-23">23 Dec., both 1835</date></ref>).</note> Your health is evidently not strong; but you are growing in years, and have naturally a sound constitution; you must learn to take care and precautions, especially in the life you are now entered upon, in that huge den of <foreign>reek</foreign> and Cotton-fuz,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-06/lt-18330326-TC-AC-01"><sic>6:355</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1833-03-26">26 March 1833</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-06/lt-18330418-TC-JSM-01"><sic>372</sic><corr>TC to JSM, <date when="1833-04-18">18 April 1833</date></corr></ref></note> where one cannot go on as in the free atmosphere of the Country. Exercise, especially exercise out of doors when it is convenient, is the best of all appliances. Do not sit motionless within doors, if there is a sun shining without, and you are able to stir. Particularly endeavour to keep a <hi rend="italic">good heart</hi>, and avoid all moping and musing, whatever takes away your cheerfulness. Sunshine in the <hi rend="italic">inside</hi> of one is even more important than sunshine without.</p>
<p>I do not understand your way of life so well as to know whether the Goodman is generally at your hand; in that case, you have both a duty to do, and society in the doing of it independently of others; <pb id="pg-09-121" n="09:121"/>but, at all events, frank communication with one&#x2019;s fellow-creatures is a pleasure and a medicine which no life should be without. Be not solitary, be not idle! That is a precept of old standing. <hi rend="italic">Doing</hi> one&#x2019;s duties (and all creatures have their solemn duties to do), living soberly, meekly, &#x201C;walking humbly before God,&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Micah 6:8.</note> one has cause to hope that it will be well with him, that he shall see good in the world. Write me a letter, full of all your concerns and considerations, when you can muster disposition. I shall always be right glad of such a message. In fine, I hope the spring weather will come and set us all up a little.</p>
<p>Before going farther, let me mention here that a Newspaper came to me last Monday, charged nineteen shillings and some pence! I, of course, refused it. I got a sight of it, but could not ascertain accurately from whom it was. Either Alick or your Robert, I thought, but the Post people had stamped it, and sealed it, and smeared it all over, and marked it &#x201C;Written on,&#x201D; so that I could make little of it. The cover, I noticed, was in writing paper scored with blue lines: it strikes me it may have been the Manchester paper, after all, and no writing in it but the copper-plate on a piece of one of Robert&#x2019;s account papers. At all events, when any more Newspapers come, the law is that the cover be of vacant blank paper; likewise we will cease writing or marking except two strokes on the cover, lest we get into trouble by it. I refused this nineteen shillings fellow; and they will be able to make no more of it, but it will make them more watchful in future. I mean to write into Annandale to the like effect.</p>
<p>The Doctor sends me word out of Rome that he wants a Dumfries Herald<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350501-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1835-05-01">1 May 1835</date></ref>.</note> forwarded to him thither. I have not yet arranged that; but I am thinking of having this Herald (if the days answer) sent by Manchester, thro&#x2019; your hands. I think it would reach you on Saturday. You could look at it, and send it on, the same day, whereby no time at all would be lost. The two strokes would always be a satisfaction. We shall see how it answers. If any such Herald, then, come your way, you know what to do with it.</p>
<p>It is several weeks since I had any direct tidings out of Scotland, except what James Aitken&#x2019;s address of the Courier gives me: it had the sign of well-being on it last week. I am to write thither shortly, having a letter of the Doctor&#x2019;s lying here, as I have hinted. The Doctor says he had written a few days before to our Mother, which <pb id="pg-09-122" n="09:122"/>has made me less anxious about speed with this to her. He is well and doing tolerably well,&#x2014;getting what Practice in Rome, a beginner can expect. The Cholera was about gone from Naples, and the panic of it from Rome, so that more English were coming in, and he hoped to do still better. You can send this news into the Scotch side when you have opportunity.</p>
<p>All people here have got a thing they call Influenza, a dirty, feverish kind of cold; very miserable, and so general as was hardly ever seen. Printing-offices, Manufactories, Tailor-shops, and such like are struck silent, every second man lying <hi rend="italic">sniftering</hi> in his respective place of abode. The same seems to be the rule in the North, too.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> contained reports throughout <date when="1837-01-00">January</date> and <date when="1837-02-00">February</date> of increased deaths and absence from work in London and the north due to the influenza, e.g., <date when="1837-01-18">18 Jan.</date></note> I suppose the miserable temperate of climate may be the cause. Worse weather never fell from the <foreign>Lift</foreign> [sky], to my judgment, than we have here. <foreign>Reek</foreign>, mist, cold, wet; the day before yesterday there was one of our completest London fogs,&#x2014;a thing of which I suppose you even at Manchester can form no kind of notion. For we are exactly <hi rend="italic">ten times</hi> as big as you are, and parts of us are hardly less <foreign>reeky</foreign> and dirty; farther, we lie <hi rend="italic">flat</hi>, on the edge of a broad river: and now suppose there were a <hi rend="italic">mist</hi>, black enough, and such that no smoke or emanation could rise from us, but fell again the instant it had got out of the chimneyhead! People have to light candles at noon, coaches have torch-bearers running at the horses&#x2019; heads. It is like a sea of ink. I wonder the people do not all drop down dead in it,&#x2014;since they are not <hi rend="italic">fishes</hi>, of a particular sort. It is cause enough for Influenza. Poor Jane, who misses nothing, has caught, fast hold of this Sunday last, and has really been miserably ill. She gets better these last two days, but is weak as water; indeed, the headache at one time was quite wretched. She has been, on the whole, stronger since you saw her, but is not at all strong. As for myself, I have felt these wretched fogs penetrating into me, with a clear design to produce cough; but I have set my face against it and said No. This really does a great deal, and has served me hitherto. I hope to escape the Influenza; they say it is abating.</p>
<p>The Book is <hi rend="italic">done</hi>, about a week ago: this is my best news. I have got the first <hi rend="italic">printed</hi> sheet, since I sat down to write this. We shall go on swiftly, it is to be hoped, and have it finished and forth into the world, say, before the month of <date when="1837-03-00">March end</date>. I care little what becomes of it then; it has been a sore Book to me. There are two things I was <pb id="pg-09-123" n="09:123"/>printing lately, which I would send to you, but there is no conveyance. I fear you would do little good with them, at any rate; not five shillings&#x2019; worth of good, which they would cost you. Besides, if Robert or you want to see them, you can let him go to a Circulating Library and ask for the <hi rend="italic">last Number of the London and Westminster Review</hi>. In it he will find a thing called Memoirs of Mirabeau: that thing is mine. The other thing is in Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine,&#x2014;half of it; the other half will be in the <date when="1837-02-00">February</date> Number: it is called Diamond Necklace.</p>
<p>This latter was written at Craigenputtock a good while ago. I see your Manchester Editor<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> feels himself aggrieved by it, worthy man, but hints that there may be some mistake on <hi rend="italic">his</hi> part; which I do very seriously assure him is my opinion, too. Other Editors, it would seem, sing to the same tune.</p>
<p>After this Book is printed, it remains uncertain what I shall do next. One thing I am firmly enough resolved on: not to spend the summer <hi rend="italic">here</hi>. I will have myself rested, and see the fields green and the sky blue yet one year, follow what may. Many things call me towards Scotland; but nothing can yet be determined upon. If I go Northward, Manchester is a likely enough step for me; nay, perhaps the Doctor may be home from Rome, and we shall both be there! Nothing is yet fixed; we will hope all this.</p>
<p>And now, my dear Sister, I must bid thee good day. Salute Robert from me with all manner of good wishes. I have known him as a &#x201C;<foreign>fell</foreign> [clever] fellow&#x201D; since he was hardly longer than my leg. Tell him to be diligent in business, and also (for that is another indispensable thing) fervent in spirit,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-05/lt-18301112-TC-JAC-01"><sic>5:189</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1830-11-12">12 Nov. 1830</date></corr></ref>.</note> struggling to serve <hi rend="italic">God</hi>. Make thou a good wife to him, helping him in all right things by counsel and act. Good be with you both! Jane sends you all good wishes from her sick bed, and &#x201C;was grieved to hear of what had happened you.&#x201D; She will be better in a day or two.</p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I fear I must seem an undutiful son for my silence of late; I have meant to write almost every day these two weeks; but really I have been very busy. Jack&#x2019;s Letter, which comes with this, signified to me that for you it would contain little new, as you had received one like it, shortly before, of your own. Tho&#x2019; accompanied only by this poorest <hi rend="italic">dud</hi> you ever read, it shall go off now, without waiting longer.</p>
<p>The best news I can send you is as it were conveyed without writing. Do you know the nature of that scrap of print? It is a piece of the Book! The Book is actually done, all written to the last line; and now after the usual <foreign>higgling</foreign> and <foreign><hi rend="italic">maffling</hi></foreign> [procrastinating], the Printers have got fairly afloat, and we are to go on with wind and sea. There is still a great deal of constant business for me, in correcting the Press,&#x2014;as much as I can do, we will hope; for they are to print with all the rapidity they are capable of; and I make a good many &#x201C;improvements&#x201D; as we go on, especially in the first volume. It will be <pb id="pg-09-125" n="09:125"/>six weeks yet; and then the Book will be about ready; and a copy will go off for Scotsbrig, I am thinking, as early as any other. Take that scrap of print, in the meanwhile, as a good omen; like the leaf that Noah&#x2019;s dove brought in the bill of it.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Gen. 8:8&#x2013;12.</note>&#x2014; I have had a very sore wrestle, for two years and a half: but it is over you see, and the thing is there. I finished about ten O&#x2019;clock at night on friday gone a week;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1837-01-13">13 Jan.</date></note> really with a feeling of thankfulness, of <foreign><hi rend="italic">wae</hi></foreign>ness [sadness], and great gladness. I could almost have <foreign><hi rend="italic">grat</hi></foreign> [wept], but did not. Jane treated me to &#x201C;a bread pudding&#x201D; next day; which bread pudding I consumed with an appetite got by walking far and wide, I daresay almost twenty miles, over this &#x201C;large and populous city.&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350130-TC-JCA-01">TC to JCA, [<date when="1835-01-30">30 Jan. 1835</date>]</ref>.</note> My health is really better than anybody could expect: the foundations of this lean frame of mine must be as tough as wire: if I were rested a little, I shall forget the whole thing; and have a degree of freedom and lightness of heart unknown to me for a long while.</p>
<p>As to the reception the Book is to meet with, I judge that there will <supplied>[be]</supplied> ten enemies of it for one friend; but also that it will find friends by and by; in fine, that, as brave old Johnson said, &#x201C;useful diligence will at last prevail.&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Samuel Johnson, &#x201C;Preface&#x201D; to <hi rend="italic">The English Dictionary</hi>, penultimate paragraph.</note> It is not altogether a bad Book. For one thing, I consider it to be perhaps the <hi rend="italic">sincerest</hi> Book this Nation has got offered it for a good few years; or is like to get for a good few. And so I say to them, &#x201C;Good Christian people, there it is! Shriek over it, since ye will not shout over it; trample it and kick it, and use it in all ways ye judge best: if ye <hi rend="italic">can</hi> kill it and extinguish it, then in God&#x2019;s name do! If ye <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi>,&#x2014;why then ye will not. My share in it is <hi rend="italic">done</hi>.&#x201D;&#x2014; That is the thing I propose to say, within my own mind, to &#x201C;ma&#x2019; friend Charles Little,&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified, but there were Littles known to the Carlyles in Ecclefechan (see earlier volumes). Charles Coffin Little (<date when="1799-00-00">1799</date>&#x2013;<date when="1869-00-00">1869</date>), Boston publisher in partnership with James Brown, was to publish <hi rend="italic">The French Revolution</hi>, by arrangement with Emerson in <date when="1837-10-00">October 1837</date>; but his name can hardly have meant anything to Mrs. Carlyle, and may not have yet been known to Carlyle himself.</note> and all manner of other friends and foes, about this matter. One infallible truth, most precious for us all, is, that I am <foreign><hi rend="italic">shot</hi></foreign> [<hi rend="italic">rid</hi>] <hi rend="italic">of it</hi>, and you are all <foreign><hi rend="italic">shot</hi></foreign> of it.&#x2014; So let us print with despatch till the <foreign><hi rend="italic">Finis</hi></foreign> is printed; and then shut our lips as to it for a twelvemonth coming.&#x2014;</p>
<p>Since Jack&#x2019;s Letter, I have incidentally had two notices of him. <pb id="pg-09-126" n="09:126"/>One was thro&#x2019; John Sterling, to whom in the South of France he had been writing; and reported himself well. The other was a Newspaper from himself at Rome within these three days. It had two strokes on it, in token that all was still tolerably right.&#x2014; Whether he is likely to get much practice in Rome one does not see hitherto; but he starts on a safe basis, that of being supported <hi rend="italic">already</hi>. It does seem he is getting somewhat to do. I wrote to him, requesting more explicit accounts next time.</p>
<p>I have sent you my best news; and must now send you my worst;&#x2014;which happily is not of a deadly nature either. It concerns this <hi rend="italic">Influenza</hi>, which all the world has; which poor Jane who never misses anything of that kind, could not escape. She took it, eight days ago precisely; with cough, pains in the back, &#x26;c; and being otherwise unwell at the time, she suffered really sharply for some days. There was the utmost weakness, incessant coughing; sometimes violent headache; really a hard business. However, for the last three days she has been decidedly better; the last two days especially she has got round fast: the cough is brought under; and we hope it is mainly over. She is sitting writing a little, behind me, at this moment.&#x2014; There never was any such universal thing seen here in my time; &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">everybody</hi> sick&#x201D; &#x26;c &#x26;c; as you will notice abundantly by the Newspapers. The truth is, our weather is the <hi rend="italic">nastiest</hi> that mortal need wish: fog, damp and frost and rain, in perpetual round. Many a time I think what is becoming of <hi rend="italic">you</hi> in Scotland; for the Disease seems to extend all over this quarter of the world; and your climate at Scotsbrig is not likely to be to be [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] much <hi rend="italic">better</hi> than ours. I pray you, dear Mother, to neglect no precaution. Avoid going out, especially in morning or evening; keep roaring fires on, to drive away this poisonous damp: above all, see that &#x201C;you take something to do you good&#x201D;; a <hi rend="italic">good garrison within</hi> makes always the best feature of the defence. I pray Alick, when he reads this, to <hi rend="italic">ascertain</hi> that you have a Keg of right ale; and to get you one directly if need be; that is, if one is not already <hi rend="italic">got</hi>. I am sure he will attend to this.&#x2014; If indeed you had already <hi rend="italic">taken</hi> the disorder!&#x2014; But I am going on the principle of <hi rend="italic">hoping</hi> to the last. At all events, somebody must write to me with all convenient despatch. A Letter: it is not safe to deal in Newspaper conveyance. There came a Newspaper here, last week, charged 19 shillings and odd pence, for being &#x201C;written on,&#x201D; as they had marked it. I looked at it; could not for my life say whose hand it was: it looked like Alick&#x2019;s; but might be Hanning&#x2019;s. I, of course, refused it (as indeed the Postman <pb id="pg-09-127" n="09:127"/>
directed me to do, being a very civil body): but I fancy we ought to take warning by it for they will be on the outlook now.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370119-TC-JCHA-01">TC to <sic>JH</sic><corr>JCHA</corr>, <date when="1837-01-19">19 Jan.</date></ref></note></p>
<p>I wrote to poor little Jenny at Manchester this last week: I try to believe that she is getting round again. I told them all my news that seemed likely to interest; and asked them to write. I also strove to impress on Jenny the necessity of careful regimen, exercise and attention to health, such as she had not been used to at Scotsbrig, but which that smoky confusion of a Manchester infallibly requires.</p>
<p>There are two bits of scraps for Dumfries,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><ref target="volume-09/lt-18370122-TC-TA-01">TC to TA, <date when="1837-01-22">22 Jan.</date></ref>, and a lost note to James Aitken.</note> which you must send on, under cover to James Aitken as soon as you can. They are about the <hi rend="italic">Herald</hi> Newspaper for John; as you will see explained in his Letter. I care nothing about it for myself: James and Jean, if they like, may take a glance of it at Dumfries, and then send it on to Manchester; it will still be in time here. I mentioned it to Jenny: it might be a kind of good to her where she is.&#x2014;&#x2014; Alick will now therefore understand how it is that he has been so ill dealt with about his <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi> of late: I have sent it always on to Jack; but the instant this Herald is set on foot, we return to the old plan. Tell him farther I wish much to have a Letter from him. What do <hi rend="italic">you</hi> say about America? I dare not say anything about it more. May a good Counsellor assist to judge what is best! Alick has had a sore enough wrestle, poor fellow; but we will not be beaten yet. We are nothing like beaten.</p>
<p>This unfortunate sheet is done, however! You seldom got a verier <hi rend="italic">dud;</hi> but it was all I could engage for. I thought I should have had more leisure while the Proof-correcting went on; but I must crave farther delay. I beg you all to remember me; and be good to me till you see me,&#x2014;and when you see me! I trust <hi rend="italic">that</hi> is coming too; not far off us now.&#x2014; The Lecturing Speculation, which I spoke of in my Letter to Jean, has taken no shape yet, and is neither off nor on: I cannot get it attended to for the present.

<salute>My dear Mill,</salute>
<p>The inclosed Note was given me on Saturday by Cavaignac, with vehement request to <foreign><hi rend="italic">appuyer</hi></foreign> [support] the prayer of it. I meant to give it you on Sunday. I do not know much or any more about it than what itself says; except that Cavaignac takes great interest in it, and will feel much obliged if you can forward what he wishes. The poor <foreign><hi rend="italic">Echapp&#xE9;</hi></foreign> [fugitive], it seems, is quite <hi rend="italic">demoralised</hi> (as they call dispirited), tho&#x2019; otherwise a <hi rend="italic">brave <foreign>gar&#x26;ccedil;on</foreign></hi> [good fellow] and good dyer of wool.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >His name was Caill&#xE9;.</note> They seem to think, you by your influence in the way they mention could contrive to get him put on trial as a workman: if he be not found fit, they will ma<supplied>[k]</supplied>e a <foreign><hi rend="italic">collecte</hi></foreign> [collection], and have him taught. Whether you can do anything in such a business I know not: I assured Cavaignac that your own charities would lead you to do what you could. If the man <hi rend="italic">can</hi> dye, he need not in a country of woolen clothiery <hi rend="italic">die</hi> for want of <hi rend="italic">dyeing</hi>. (I am growing Thomas-Hood-ish<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Hood (<date when="1799-00-00">1799</date>&#x2013;<date when="1845-00-00">1845</date>), English poet, essayist, humorist, famous for his puns, especially involved ones.</note>).&#x2014; Cavaignac&#x2019;s own address is 1. Tavistock Row, Covent Garden.</p>
<p>I have not surrendered to this Influenza, tho&#x2019; it incessantly besieges me. My Wife has been and is very ill of it. By your walking last Sunday, I inferred you were getting better. Thank Heaven, there is a little semblance of blue here and there in the sky today.</p>

<salute>My dear Mill,</salute>
<p>I have forwarded your Answer<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> to Cavaignac: it is my notion that Caill&#xE9; ought to try that dyeing of Leather, since no better is. If they think so, they will communicate with Grant about it.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370124-TC-JSM-01">TC to JSM, [<date when="1837-01-24">24 Jan.</date>]</ref>; Grant was Mill&#x2019;s colleague, Horace Grant, at India House.</note></p>
<p>Here is a copy of the <hi rend="italic">Necklace;</hi> which I wish you great good of. Fraser has given me two dozen made up in this manner. &#x201C;The Country Newspapers,&#x201D; he says, are in the greatest indignation.</p>
<p>If I had the Copies of <hi rend="italic">Mirabeau</hi> now, I could still find an opportunity of sending them off. They are for Scotland mainly; two are for America: I have promised them long ago; but can easily <hi rend="italic">explain</hi>, if impossibility have intervened.</p>
<p>Neither, in the other case, let your Printer hurry himself; shifting his types before the time. Whether he may be able to correct these <foreign><hi rend="italic">Errata</hi></foreign> marked on the accompanying piece of paper I know not; nor is that either of much moment: however, I have marked them, and will give him a chance. The little paragraph to fill up the <hi rend="italic">hiatus</hi> of Mirabeau&#x2019;s Hunt where the Extract was cut out, is the second I have composed for that end. The first was not fixed on with wafer: indeed it was left with the Editor either to insert that, or replace the Extract as might suit his space best;&#x2014;so it went the way of all paper; and the <hi rend="italic">hiatus</hi> fell together as it could.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Clowes, the printer of &#x201C;Mirabeau&#x201D; had omitted from &#x201C;Man being a venatory creature&#x201D; to &#x201C;all possible researches too: in a word,&#x201D; that is, Carlyle&#x2019;s introduction to and a long extract from the official report of the hunt, later reinserted (see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XXVIII, 459&#x2013;61). The concluding words of the report, from &#x201C;Monsieur, we have done,&#x201D; thus appeared in &#x201C;Mirabeau,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">London and Westminster Review</hi>, XXVI (<date when="1837-01-00">Jan. 1837</date>), 425, immediately after &#x201C;unmuzzling them, cries: Hunt!&#x2014;&#x201D; without explanation. Carlyle had presumably written a paragraph to clarify this which had been lost by the printer.</note></p>
<p>At the rate our Printer travels at, there seems to me small prospect that the French Revolution can be ready for your next N<hi rend="italic">o</hi>. Perhaps it will answer <hi rend="italic">me</hi> still better,&#x2014;to have a friend lying back a little, to silence marauders? Or perhaps it may not answer so well. I cannot guide it; need not take charge of it. The <hi rend="italic">third</hi> sheet is still lying on the mantel-piece here with &#x201C;To Press&#x201D; only <hi rend="italic">marked</hi> on it. Fraser has <pb id="pg-09-130" n="09:130"/>set a second Printer to work, on a separate volume;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Volumes I and II of <hi rend="italic">The French Revolution</hi> were printed by James Moyes, Castle St., Leicester Sq.; Vol. III by Levey, Robson, and Franklyn, 46 St. Martin&#x2019;s Lane.</note> and talks of setting a third on, if need be. I have been very heavy hitherto with corrections: but the worst of that is over now.</p>
<p>You never received the <hi rend="italic">Dulaure;</hi> which must have surprised you. I forgot to speak of it last time. The case was, I found <hi rend="italic">no</hi> paper of references in <hi rend="italic">Dulaure;</hi><note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jacques Antoine Dulaure (<date when="1755-00-00">1755</date>&#x2013;<date when="1835-00-00">1835</date>), French historian; possibly his <hi rend="italic">Histoire physique, civile et morale de Paris</hi>, 8 vols. (Paris, <date when="1821-00-00">1821</date>&#x2013;<date when="1825-00-00">25</date>).</note> and his Index being so extensive and complete, there is for the present considerable service to me in him. As your friend has hitherto been so good, he will perhaps continue it a few weeks longer. If not, let me know; and I will give up, as in duty bound. Nay, indeed I can do it without excessive sacrifice. The thing stands as I say.</p>
<p>Before &#x201C;taking one&#x2019;s rifle for the Back Woods of America,&#x201D;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370213-TC-RWE-01">TC to RWE, <date when="1837-02-13">13 Feb.</date></ref></note> it is proper that one <hi rend="italic">search</hi> the ground accurately as he goes, and exhaust the resources <hi rend="italic">it</hi> offers. To myself this project of Lecturing on German Literature in the Albermarle Street Institution does not seem to promise much: but some of my friends are amazingly fond of it. I have not yet succeeded in ascertaining two essential <hi rend="italic">pre</hi>liminaries: 1st <hi rend="italic">What</hi> any success in it might probably amount to: 2<hi rend="italic">nd</hi> what the difficulties are, what the means are of getting it <hi rend="italic">tried</hi>. Perhaps the Mr Singer<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Samuel Weller Singer (<date when="1783-00-00">1783</date>&#x2013;<date when="1858-00-00">1858</date>), author and editor; from <date when="1827-00-00">1827</date> he had been Librarian at the Royal Institute, Albemarle St., until his retirement in <date when="1835-00-00">1835</date> to Mickleham where the Mills&#x2019; country cottage was.</note> you mentioned could without much trouble enlighten me on these? I should then see whether it was worth while to stir, yea or no.</p>
<p>As you take an interest in Teufelsdr&#xF6;ckh, it will be good news to hear that they are printing a second edition of him in America;&#x2014;of 1000, the first having only been 500.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Ripley had told Carlyle this in his letter of <date when="1836-12-29">29 Dec. 1836</date> (see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370213-TC-RWE-01">TC to RWE, <date when="1837-02-13">13 Feb.</date></ref>). In &#x201C;Mirabeau&#x201D; Carlyle had acknowledged the American publication by introducing a quotation from <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi> thus: &#x201C;we quote from a New-England Book&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XXVIII, 409).</note> I even heard some whisper of an Edition coming out here by and by. But as it unfortunately will never procure me one pipe of tobacco in the way of advantage, but on the contrary will only confuse my already confused head still farther with foolish babblement and clatterment,&#x2014;it seems to be some other man&#x2019;s charge than mine.</p>
<p>I forget what lions and lionesses I saw very lately. I am sick of <pb id="pg-09-131" n="09:131"/>body, not healthy of mind; and desire above all things that I were covered under a tub.</p>

<salute>My ever dear John Sterling</salute>
<p>Here are thirty three pages of writing for you, which would divide into <hi rend="italic">ten</hi> letters of the usual size! so that you see I discharge my debt to you, handsomely enough in the long run. But even if you should not be complaisant enough to accept a nonsense-fairy-tale<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sterling presumably refers to this piece in his letter of <date when="1837-05-30">May 30</date> to Jane: &#x201C;I wish you would tell me who your hero with his weeping willows is meant for? &#x26; also whether you are dear enough to make me a present of it as if so I shall immediately get some rose-coloured bonbon box made to keep it in.&#x201D; &#x201C;This <hi rend="italic">&#x2018;Fairy Tale&#x2019;</hi> have never yet seen:&#x2014;must have been destroyed by her aft<hi rend="italic">ds?</hi> Make further search! Next bit of <hi rend="italic">Ms</hi>. sent (Dialogue &#x26;c) much admired by Sterling, is still here, and shall be given at the due place.&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note). For the &#x201C;Dialogue: The Bird and the Watch&#x201D; and the &#x201C;Remonstrance of my Old Watch,&#x201D; see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370900-JWC-JOST-01">JWC to <sic>JS</sic><corr>JOST</corr>, <date when="1837-09-00">Sept</date>&#x2013;<date when="1837-10-00">Oct.</date></ref> and Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi>, I, 78&#x2013;87.</note> in lieu of all the sense-letters I ought to have sent you; still you must not be after saying or thinking that <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;Mrs Carlyle has cut your acquaintance&#x201D;</hi> John Sterling &#x201C;is a man of sense&#x201D; (as M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Buller one day, in Carlyle&#x2019;s hearing, said patronizingly of the Apostle Paul) and must know that M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle is a woman of sense; by this token, that she perceived him John Sterling the very first time she ever set eyes on him to be no humbug after all that had been said and sung about him, but the <pb id="pg-09-133" n="09:133"/>very sort of man one desires to see, and hardly ever succeeds in seeing in this make-believe world! Now I put it to your candour, whether any woman of sense, in her right senses, having found a pearl of great price,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Matt. 13:46.</note> would dream of dissolving it in a tumbler of water and swallowing it all at one gulp? For such, in highly figurative language, would be the foolish use I should have made of your friendship, provided it were true, as you wrote, that I had already <hi rend="italic">cut your acquaint</hi>ance! O no! you have only to take a just view of your own merits and mine; to feel as convinced as tho&#x2019; I had sworn it before a magistrate, that my long silence has proceeded from some <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;crook in the lot&#x201D;</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">The Heart of Midlothian</hi>, chap. 12. (OED cites <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350920-JWC-SS-01">JWC to <sic>SH</sic><corr>SS</corr>, [<date when="1835-09-20">20 Sept. 1835</date>]</ref> as well as Scott.)</note> and not in the mind. The fact is since I became so sick and dispirited, I have contracted a horror of letter-writing almost equal to the hydraphobea [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] horror for cold water. I would write anything under Heaven fairy tales, or advertisements for Warren&#x2019;s blacking<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-02/lt-18230118-JBW-TC-01"><sic>2:272</sic><corr>JBW to TC, <date when="1823-01-18">18 Jan. 1823</date></corr></ref>.</note> even rather than a letter! A letter behoves to tell about oneself, and when oneself is disagreeable to oneself; one would rather tell about anything else; for alas one does not find the same gratification in dwelling upon one&#x2019;s own sin and misery as in showing up the sin and misery of one&#x2019;s neighbour.</p>
<p>But if ever I get agreeable to myself again, I swear to you I will then be exceedingly communicative: in preparation for which desirable end, I must set about getting into better health, and that I may get into better health I must begin by growing wise. Which puts me in mind of a boy of &#x2018;the English Opium Eater&#x2019;s<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William (<date when="1816-00-00">1816</date>&#x2013;<date when="1835-00-00">35</date>), who with his sister Margaret (b. <date when="1817-00-00">1817</date>), had been brought by De Quincey to visit Comely Bank on <date when="1827-11-21">21 Nov. 1827</date>.

<p>For the present we are all in sad taking with Influenza. People speak about it more than they did about Cholera; I do not know whether they die more from it. Miss Wilson not having come to close quarters with it, has her mind sufficiently at leisure to make philosophical speculations about its gender! She primly promulgates her opinion that Influenza is masculine; my Husband, for the sake of argument, I presume (for I see not what other interest he has in it) <pb id="pg-09-134" n="09:134"/>protests that Influenza is feminine; for me who have been laid up with it for two weeks and upwards, making lamentations of Jeremiah (not without reason) I am not prejudiced either way, but content myself with sincerely wishing it were neuter. One great comfort, however, under all afflictions, is that <hi rend="italic">The French Revolution</hi> is happily concluded; at least it will be comfort when one is delivered from the tag-rag<supplied>[g]</supplied>ery of printer&#x2019;s devils that at present drive one from post to pillar. <foreign>Quelle vie</foreign>[What a life]! Let no woman who values peace of soul ever dream of marrying an Author!&#x2014;that is to say if he be an honest one, who makes a conscience of <hi rend="italic">doing</hi> the thing he pretends to do. But this I observe to you in confidence: should I state such a sentiment openly, I might happen to get myself torn in pieces, by the host of my Husband&#x2019;s lady-admirers, who already I suspect, think me too happy in not knowing my happiness.&#x2014; You cannot fancy what way he is making with the fair Intellectuals here! There is Harriet Martineau<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Ripley in his letter of <date when="1836-12-29">29 Dec. 1836</date> had said of Harriet Martineau: &#x201C;She is a great friend of your book. &#x2026; She made the Sartor her constant companion in a delightful tour which Mrs Ripley &#x26; myself took with her last <date when="1836-05-00">May</date> to one of our beautiful lakes.&#x201D;</note> presents him her ear-trumpet with a pretty blushing air of coquetry which would almost convince one out of belief in her indentity [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>]!

<p>Having got rather into the sphere of scandal, I may mention before leaving it that John Mill and M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Taylor get on as charmingly as ever.

<salute>My dear Miss Wilson,</salute>
<p>You are infinitely kind to take so much trouble about these Lectures that are to be,&#x2014;or not to be. I am so beset, night and day, with Printers and Proofsheets, that the whole Business has got, as it were, <hi rend="italic">overlaid</hi>, and lies quite quiet in the background.</p>
<p>It is clear to me however that I cannot solicit any Note to Mr Faraday,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Michael Faraday (<date when="1791-00-00">1791</date>&#x2013;<date when="1867-00-00">1867</date>), scientist, had been connected with the Royal Institution since <date when="1813-00-00">1813</date> when he became Sir Humphrey Davy&#x2019;s assistant; he became director of the Laboratory, <date when="1825-00-00">1825</date>, and Fullerian professor of chemistry, <date when="1833-00-00">1833</date>, both at the Institution.</note> nor present one if I had it; nor indeed solicit at all in this stage of the business. Do not call me indolent; do not call me proud or unreasonable: I trust in Heaven it is not that. But my heart is sore and sick; and has to consider what things it can undertake to do; what things it will be easier to endure the penalty of not doing than to do.</p>
<p>I hope to learn by and by, in the way of free communication with somebody or other, what are the real conditions of the thing: this once done, I shall very speedily decide, and very speedily give you warnin<supplied>[g]</supplied> and <hi rend="italic">solicit</hi> (at that stage) of <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, and those that are worthy like you.</p>
<p>Mr Wilson promised me some volumes of the <hi rend="italic">Annual Register;</hi> for which the Bearer<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not identified.</note> of this will undertake,&#x2014;if I may rouse him from dinner for such a purpose. The volumes from <date when="1780-00-00">1780</date> to <date when="1790-00-00">1790</date> are the ones wanted; and these not for long.</p>
<p>I hope to get you a complete copy of th<supplied>[e]</supplied> <hi rend="italic">Necklace</hi>, one of these days, and to call with it.</p>
<p>My wife is still very sickly, tho&#x2019; the mai<supplied>[n]</supplied> brunt of the Influenza <pb id="pg-09-138" n="09:138"/>has passed. She has only crossed the threshold once, and not in this bitter North-East weather.

<salute>My dear Emerson,</salute>
<p>You had promise of a Letter to be despatched you about Newyear&#x2019;s-day; which promise I was myself in a condition to fulfil at the time set, but delayed it, owing to delays of Printers and certain &#x201C;Articles&#x201D; that were to go with it. Six weeks have not yet entirely brought up these laggard animals: however, I will delay no longer for them. Nay it seems the Articles, were they never so ready, cannot go with the Letter; but must fare round by Liverpool or Portsmouth, in a separate conveyance. We will leave them to the bounty of Time.</p>
<p>Your little Book and the copy of <hi rend="italic">Teufelsdr&#xF6;ckh</hi> came safely; soon after I had written. The <hi rend="italic">Teufelsdr&#xF6;ckh</hi> I instantaneously despatched to Hamburg, to a Scottish Merchant there, to whom there is an allusion in the Book;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Parish &#x26; Co. (cf. Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi>, p. 74).</note> who used to be my <foreign><hi rend="italic">Speditor</hi></foreign> [shipping agent] (one of the politest extant tho&#x2019; totally a stranger) in my missions and packages to and from Weimar. The other, former Copy, more specially yours, had already been, as I think I told you, delivered out of durance; and got itself placed in the Bookshelf, as <hi rend="italic">the</hi> Teufelsdr&#xF6;ck. George Ripley tells me, you are printing another edition;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In his letter of <date when="1836-12-29">29 Dec. 1836</date> (see Slater, <hi rend="italic">GRTC</hi>, pp. 344&#x2013;46). Ripley had written: &#x201C;A new edition of a thousand copies of Sartor is now in press; every copy (500) of the first edition being sold. &#x2026; You can, probably, form but a faint conception, on your side of the water, of the earnestness with which a true voice is welcome here, by those who recognize it; the greater, as such voices are seldom heard among us,&#x2014;the din of business &#x26; politics well nigh drowning all sounds from the heavenly mount.&#x201D;</note> much good may it do you! There is now also a kind of whisper and whimper rising <hi rend="italic">here</hi> about printing one. I said to myself once, when Bookseller <pb id="pg-09-139" n="09:139"/>Fraser shrieked so loud at a certain message you sent him,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350513-TC-RWE-01">TC to RWE, <date when="1835-05-13">13 May 1835</date></ref>.</note> &#x201C;Perhaps after all they <hi rend="italic">will</hi> print this poor rag of a thing into a Book, after I am dead it may be,&#x2014;if so seem good to them. <hi rend="italic">Either</hi> way!&#x2014; As it is, we leave the poor orphan to its destiny; all the more cheerfully. Ripley says farther he has sent me a critique of it by a better hand than the <hi rend="italic">North American:</hi> I expect it, but have not got it yet. The <hi rend="italic">North American</hi> seems to say that <hi rend="italic">he</hi> too sent me one. It never came to hand, nor any hint of it,&#x2014;except I think once before thro&#x2019; you. It was not at all an unfriendly review; but had an opacity of matter-of-fact in it that filled one with amazement.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ripley had written: &#x201C;You will not judge us by the foolish article on &#x2018;Sartor Resartus&#x2019; in the N. A. Review [by A. H. Everett: see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350800-TC-GRI-01">TC to <sic>GR</sic><corr>GRI</corr>, (<date when="1835-08-00">Aug. 1835</date>)</ref>]; &#x2026; the author told me he had sent you a copy. &#x2026; A wiser tribute is contained in the Review in the Examiner, written by a brother Unitarian clergyman [N. L. Frothingham, <hi rend="italic">Christian Examiner</hi>, XXI (<date when="1836-09-00">Sept. 1836</date>), 74&#x2013;84].&#x201D; Nevertheless Carlyle quotes from Everett&#x2019;s review in &#x201C;Testimonies of Authors,&#x201D; attached to the first English edition of <hi rend="italic">Sartor Resartus</hi> (London, <date when="1838-00-00">1838</date>), pp. vi&#x2013;ix.</note> Since the Irish Bishop who said &#x201C;there were some things in <hi rend="italic">Gulliver</hi>, on which he for one would keep his belief <hi rend="italic">suspended</hi>,&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Swift wrote to Pope from Dublin on <date when="1726-11-27">27 Nov. 1726</date>: &#x201C;A Bishop here said that book was full of improbable lies, and for his part, he hardly believed a word of it.&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Correspondence of Jonathan Swift, D.D.,</hi> ed.

However, he <hi rend="italic">has</hi> made out that Teufelsdr&#xF6;ckh is, in all human probability, a fictitious character; which is always something, for an Inquirer into Truth.&#x2014; Will you, finally, thank Friend Ripley in my name, till I have time to write to him and thank him.</p>
<p>Your little azure-coloured <hi rend="italic">Nature</hi> gave me true satisfaction.

He that cannot keep himself quiet is of a morbid nature; and the thing he yields us will be like him in that, whatever else it be.&#x2014; Miss Martineau (for I have seen her since I wrote) tells me you are &#x201C;the only man in America,&#x201D; who has quietly set himself down on a competency to follow his own path, and do the work his own <hi rend="italic">Will</hi> prescribes for him. Pity that you were the only one! But be one, nevertheless; be the first, and there will come a second and a third.

I declare, in History I find nothing more tragical. I find also that it will alter; that for me as one it has altered.

<p>The Paper is declining fast, and all is yet speculation. Along with these two &#x201C;Articles&#x201D; (to be sent by Liverpool; there are two of them, <hi rend="italic">D.

I did not cry; nor I did not pray: but could have done both. No such <hi rend="italic">spell</hi> shall get itself fixed on me for some while to come! A beggarly Distortion; that will please no mortal, not even myself; of which I know not whether the fire were not after all the due place! And yet I ought not to say so: there is a great blessing in a man&#x2019;s doing what he utterly can, in <pb id="pg-09-141" n="09:141"/>the case he is in. Perhaps great quantities of dross are burnt out of me by this calcination I have had; perhaps I shall be far quieter and healthier of mind and body than I have ever been since boyhood. The world, tho&#x2019; no man had ever less empire in it, seems to me a thing lying <hi rend="italic">under</hi> my feet; a mean imbroglio, which I never more shall fear, or court, or disturb myself with: welcome and welcome to go wholly <hi rend="italic">its own way;</hi> I wholly clear for going mine.<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. the catharsis at the end of &#x201C;The Everlasting No&#x201D; in <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi>.</note>&#x2014; Thro&#x2019; the summer months I am, somewhere or other, to <hi rend="italic">rest</hi> myself, in the deepest possible sleep.

There is a scheme here among Friends for my Lecturing in a thing they call Royal Institution; but it will not do there, I think. The instant two or three are gathered together under any terms, who want to learn something I can teach them,&#x2014;then, we will, most readily, as Burns says, &#x201C;loose our tinkler jaw&#x201D;;<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-01/lt-18200419-TC-AC-01"><sic>1:240</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1820-04-19">19 April 1820</date></corr></ref>.</note> but not I think till then; were the Institution even Imperial. America has faded considerably into the background of late: indeed, to say truth, whenever I think of myself in America, it is as in the Back Woods, with a rifle in my hand; God&#x2019;s sky over my head, and this accursed Lazarhouse of quacks and blockheads, and sin and misery, (now near ahead) lying all behind me forever more. A thing, you see, which is and can be at bottom but a day-dream! To rest thro the summer: that is my only fixed wisdom; a resolution taken; only the place where uncertain.&#x2014; What a pity this poor sheet is done! I had innumerable things to tell you about people whom I have seen, about books,&#x2014;Miss Harriet Martineau, Mrs Butler, Southey; Influenza, Parliament, Literature and the Life of Man&#x2014;the whole of which must lie over till next time. Write to me; do not forget me.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Your Letter,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1837-01-29">29 Jan.</date></note> which we had begun to weary for, reached us on Monday. Along with it came a Letter written altogether in my Mother&#x2019;s hand;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> of the old cheerful temper; reporting nothing but right out of Scotland. So that Monday was made a cheerful day. I have been held in such a welter of Proofsheets, flying paper-scraps, books, keep-lessons [obligatory tasks] and confusion ever since that now, on friday night, while the <hi rend="italic">Devil</hi> is absent, and off my hands for two hours at least, I have to snatch the otherwise not favourable time, and write while it is given me. I wearied for your Letter; and doubtless you will for this of mine. But really and literally this is about the first leisure good or bad I have had all week hitherto.</p>
<p>You will probably receive your first &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Herald</hi> Newspaper&#x201D; a day or two before this arrives. It was frightfully dirty, but not of my dirtying. I suppose Rob Hanning to have been the innocent author. The Postmark on the thing was &#x201C;Stockport&#x201D;;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >6&#xBD; miles SE of Manchester.</note> and it was three days later than due: in my total ignorance as to particulars and arrangements, I fancy Rob had forgotten it at his quarters, and some <hi rend="italic">snuffy-nosed drunkard</hi> had been reading it. The reason no <hi rend="italic">Herald</hi> came sooner I take to be this: that the Letter ordering had lain a long time at Ecclefechan. Our Mother dates from Mary&#x2019;s at Anna, where she has been staying this good while (Mary is expecting soon to be <hi rend="italic">confined</hi>): I had given the needful directions in a Note to James Aitken and in one to Aird; which of course lay at Ecclefechan till the Scotsbrig people chanced to call on Postie, and then forward them. As <hi rend="italic">no time</hi> would be lost by having the <hi rend="italic">Herald</hi> (a <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi> paper) lie a day at Manchester on its way hither, I empowered Jamie (Aitken) to arrange it that way: if the <hi rend="italic">snuff-drops</hi> continue or repeat themselves, we must alter it. But the <hi rend="italic">two strokes</hi>, I fancy after all, would make amends to you for everything. We got one Italian Newspaper from you, besides the <hi rend="italic">Diario</hi><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably <hi rend="italic">Diario di Roma</hi>, a newspaper published <date when="1809-00-00">1809</date>&#x2013;<date when="1848-00-00">48</date>.</note> formerly: the price of it, as being heavier I suppose, was a penny. You should send us one about once in the ten <pb id="pg-09-143" n="09:143"/>days or fortnight, I think. The Letter and Answer cannot be transacted in less than some five weeks; which is too long a time. I have despatched weekly, ever since you first so appointed it, a Dumfries Newspaper, the <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi> since I had no other: Alick gets his Courier back again this week for the first time. It arrived yesterday <hi rend="italic">without the strokes;</hi> but today Aitken forwarded a <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> with them. He is a most punctual man. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Ohe satis</hi></foreign> [quite enough]!</p>
<p>There has been really a most sad time here ever since I wrote last, with weather and <hi rend="italic">Influenza</hi>. The funeral bell never ceased here, nothing but funerals whenever you stirred; crawling along, dreary, thro&#x2019; the mud and fog. One day stepping out I saw a group in the King&#x2019;s Road: it was a young man and his wife who had both died, and were going together to their long home; that and the ragged groups about it made one of the dolefullest looking things I ever saw. The mortality here seems to have been far greater than by cholera: I suppose everywhere over the Island considerably greater.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Scotsman</hi>, <date when="1837-01-21">21</date> and <date when="1837-01-25">25 Jan.</date>, had noted that the death rate had been as great as during the cholera epidemic of <date when="1832-00-00">1832</date>. The obituary list of the <hi rend="italic">Dumfries Courier</hi>, <date when="1837-02-15">15 Feb.</date>, was twice the normal length. The editorial mentioned that while Dumfries was relatively unaffected, Gatehouse of Fleet, Sanquhar, and other parishes were severely hit by influenza.</note> <hi rend="italic">Dumfries</hi> however seems to have been gently dealt with. And yet M&#x2019;Diarmid&#x2019;s obituary this week is of woful length. Thank Heaven! The Sun again shews his face, and the blue sky of spring; the malady, which has greatly abated, will probably disappear in a little while. None that we were nearly interested in have been taken from us. My Mother had a kind of biliary complaint, she says, for three days; but has since been fully as well as usual: she speaks as if none of the rest had been tried at all. Mrs Welsh had it, but is well again. Jane, who never escapes anything that is going, had it really very ill; nay had it <hi rend="italic">twice</hi>, having gone out too early: but she is now, after a hard month of it, nearly thro&#x2019; again. She was as ill on the first occasion as I have almost ever seen her; had lost head, kept crying &#x201C;for her mother,&#x201D; and made a most doleful business of it. I for my own share would never <hi rend="italic">consent to accept it;</hi> yet have been obliged to go on with a series of snivelling colds and semi-colds; one of which (may it prove the last!) is still upon me. It reaches no deeper than the root of the nostrils, and top of the lar<hi rend="italic">nyx</hi> [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] and as I resist all temptation to cough, I think, if the Sun will hold out, I shall expel it in two days more. One of the persons nearest to us in this great list of deaths was old Mr Bradfute<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Bradfute (see <ref target="volume-01/lt-18191000-JBW-EA-01"><sic>1:204</sic><corr>JBW to EA, <date when="1819-10-06">6 Oct. 1819</date></corr></ref>). He had died on <date when="1837-01-16">16 Jan.</date></note> of Edinburgh. <pb id="pg-09-144" n="09:144"/>Perhaps you might see his name in the Dumfries Obituary: it was in that way we first heard of the event. His property &#x26;c has devolved I believe into the hands of David Aitken and the Stoddart people,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >David Aitken (see <ref target="volume-04/lt-18270217-TC-DA-01"><sic>4:192</sic><corr>TC to DA, <date when="1827-02-17">17 Feb. 1827</date></corr></ref>) had married Eliza Stodart in <date when="1836-07-00">July 1836</date>, having been appointed one of the trustees of Bradfute&#x2019;s will on <date when="1836-06-24">24 June 1836</date>. The main beneficiary was Eliza, and great care had been taken to ensure that the money did not simply go to any future husband but to see that it was administered by trustees for her benefit and that of any children she might have. The whole estate, excluding the George Sq. house and contents (which went to Eliza), was worth well over &#xa3;45,000. Her brother Robert, sister Margaret Dudgeon (David G. Ritchie&#x2019;s grandmother), and Samuel Aitken were among the other beneficiaries.</note> who seem to have felt at a loss how to address Mrs Welsh or Jane upon the subject. He has left Mrs. Welsh &#xa3;105. To Jane it would seem he has left with a still more epigrammatic felicity&#x2014;a Book; Boydell&#x2019;s Shakspear I think it is.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The bequest to Jane is not recorded in the will, and it was presumably left to Eliza&#x2019;s discretion. The book was probably Shakespeare&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, ed. John Boydell, 9 vols. (London, <date when="1802-00-00">1802</date>), illustrated with 100 engravings from paintings in the Boydell Shakespeare Gallery (<date when="1789-00-00">1789</date>&#x2013;<date when="1805-00-00">1805</date>). &#x201C;Mrs. Grizel Welsh&#x201D; was duly left &#xa3;105.</note> His death was of the gentlest<supplied>[.]</supplied> He went thro&#x2019; the world, one may say, doing as little <hi rend="italic">ill</hi> as any man that lived in it. Good he could not do much; yet he did do some; and has now, leaving the world, made a class of Aitkens and Stoddarts richer, or perhaps <hi rend="italic">rich</hi>, which is a kind of good too. If he had left my dame here a thousand pounds or two, it might have been of very considerable service; perhaps of disservice too; one does not know. Peace be with the old man; whose innocent countenance, and thin Edinburgh-Burgher figure I shall never behold more.</p>
<p>The grand news, of course, is as usual of this <hi rend="italic">Book</hi>. The Printer Moyes goes on, very briskly, as you have heard, for last week; but on the whole irregularly hitherto; and makes less way than one could wish. I have been very heavy on him with <hi rend="italic">corrections;</hi> but the worst of that is fairly over now. Fraser, resolute to <hi rend="italic">be out</hi> at some set time (I know not what, probably <date when="1837-04-01">April-fools day</date>) has set a <hi rend="italic">second</hi> Printer to work on the third volume: but of him, his type &#x26;c not being quite accurate conformable to Moyes&#x2019;s, I have not yet had any <hi rend="italic">Proof</hi>. We are got near the hot work<supplied>[;]</supplied> taking of the Bastille. I call each <hi rend="italic">chapter</hi>, that was, a <hi rend="italic">Book</hi>, and have subdivided all these into chapters: the longest list of Chapters as yet is <hi rend="italic">ten</hi>, the shortest <hi rend="italic">four</hi>. Each Chap. has a <hi rend="italic">brief</hi> (brief<hi rend="italic">est</hi>) title; generally with something of the epigrammatic character in it; each Book too has a title; and each volume: the <hi rend="italic">list</hi> of these will be the <hi rend="italic">Table of Contents</hi> without other Index or appendage. The Notes are merely <hi rend="italic">references;</hi> I do not add anything beyond the <pb id="pg-09-145" n="09:145"/>text. On the other hand, I am really consciencious [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] in <hi rend="italic">cutting out;</hi> you will be delighted to <hi rend="italic">miss</hi> not a few of your old friends. I have added piece<supplied>[s]</supplied> too as I went on (thro&#x2019; this <hi rend="italic">burnt</hi> part); have <hi rend="italic">divided</hi> many a paragraph, many a sentence; and so, with <hi rend="italic">chaptering</hi> too, have let a great deal of <hi rend="italic">daylight</hi> (of <hi rend="italic">blank</hi> at least) into it: and, on the whole, it seems to myself, incredibly improved it. We shall see what the Doctor says, by and by!&#x2014; My toil is great; but it is not a wearing toil, as that of writing was. As we get on too the references, which are the main toil when you have a conscience, get rarer: the <hi rend="italic">Ms</hi>. too is of a kindlier character, after we get out of the <hi rend="italic">ashes</hi>. I find &#x2018;on a general view&#x2019; that the Book is one of the <hi rend="italic">savagest</hi> written for several centuries: it is a Book written by a <hi rend="italic">wild man</hi>, a man disunited from the fellowship of the world he lives in; looking King and beggar in the face with an indifference of brotherhood, an indifference of contempt,&#x2014;that is really very extraordinary in a Respectable country. The Critic, of a respectable nature, cannot but be loud; <foreign><hi rend="italic">falls er nicht schweight</hi></foreign> [in the event he is not silent], which really I shall be well content that he do. But I think he will not. In that case, I will grant him free scope; there is no word in his belly harder than the words <hi rend="italic">it</hi> utters, by implication or directly, about him and his. A wild man;&#x2014;pray God only it be <hi rend="italic">a man!</hi> And then huff away; smite and spare not: the thing <hi rend="italic">you</hi> can kill, I say always, deserves not to live.&#x2014; Mill is clear for having a Review out <hi rend="italic">before</hi> the Book come; and has solicited Proofsheets: this not for the Book&#x2019;s sake, but his Review&#x2019;s.<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">The French Revolution</hi> was published about <date when="1837-05-09">9 May</date>; Mill&#x2019;s review appeared in the <hi rend="italic">London and Westminster Review</hi> for <date when="1837-07-00">July</date>.</note> There seems to have been rather a loud dissonance (if I am to credit Fraser) about these two Papers<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Mirabeau&#x201D; and &#x201C;The Diamond Necklace.&#x201D;</note> I emitted lately;&#x2014;great blame and also good praise is all that I could pray for; if indeed any prayers pointed in that direction at all! But shall I not <hi rend="italic">be d</hi><supplied>[<hi rend="italic">one</hi>]</supplied> <hi rend="italic">with it?</hi> That is a fact worth all the others. On the whole, I believe it is all right. Mill finds that &#x201C;the Mirabeau has done us a great deal of good&#x201D;; and wants continuance of favours.<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >At this time Mill was a great admirer and staunch defender of Carlyle. Sarah Austin had written from Malta about &#x201C;Mirabeau&#x201D;: &#x201C;M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Lewis &#x26; my husband are clamorous against poor Carlyle&#x2019;s article &#x26; say you will ruin the review if you admit any more. I am afraid this is a very general opinion,&#x201D; to which Mill replied on <date when="1837-04-26">26 April</date> &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">A propos</hi></foreign> of your remark on Carlyle&#x2019;s article Mirabeau: I am not at all surprised that M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Austin or that Lewis should dislike it, but it has been the most popular article we ever had in the review &#x26; I think has been extremely useful to us. Except Roebuck, Grote, &#x26; Senior, I have met nobody here, of any account, who disliked it; &#x26; those three dislike everything, the <hi rend="italic">style</hi> of which is not humdrum, &#x2026; Those who have disliked the article Mirabeau are those who cannot endure <hi rend="italic">any peculiarities</hi> of style&#x201D; (Mineka, XII, 333&#x2013;34).</note> Were this <hi rend="italic">done</hi>, I will see. Your plan about <pb id="pg-09-146" n="09:146"/>French Revolutionary characters, I doubt, will not answer:<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John had written: &#x201C;I am glad your History is at length finished and fairly in the press and approve much of your intended subdivision into little chapters. &#x2026; I wish that you could engage with Mill to write a series of articles on the most remarkable characters of the Revolution. It is a subject you are familiar with and you could make it very interesting. In that way you might also make the History plainer and give it detail and expansion.&#x201D;</note> there <hi rend="italic">are</hi> only two or three <hi rend="italic">characters</hi> (the rest being shadows and hearsays); then of these some are worn threadbare, others have no documents about them: and worst of all the <hi rend="italic">Revolution</hi> is a subject I am sick of for the present. There are other subjects plenty if I were in trim.&#x2014; Your two &#x201C;Articles&#x201D; lie here with your name on them; but there is no opportunity hitherto, nor any within sight. The rest are all sent off to Annandale &#x26;c. One or two to America.</p>
<p>The great business for me however is to <hi rend="italic">get well again</hi>. Jane has decided that she will prefer staying here thro&#x2019; summer; so her Mother has been written to, to take up her abode here with her; and I think will accede to the arrangement. It were much happier for all parties. She could bring her Mary with her, who is an excellent servant; our Anne has few qualities but her good nature: we might in many ways be greatly improved in posture. We shall see. I have yet determined on nothing; except that I will <hi rend="italic">not</hi> spend next summer here; that my first grand blessedness will be to get to some place where I shall be <hi rend="italic">altogether let alone for some time</hi>. This evidently is a blessedness <hi rend="italic">not</hi> unattainable. Sometimes I think of Scotland; oftenest indeed; but I make no appointments or fixed resolutions: all hangs in possibility under the sway of <hi rend="italic">Hope</hi>. A couple of months will have thrown light on it.&#x2014; As to the <hi rend="italic">Lecturing</hi>, I imagine it is almost off for this season. After much hithering and thithering, it was at last discovered about a week ago that the &#x201C;Institution&#x201D; was all filled up and completed for the present year. I wrote to Miss Wilson (the main Agent in this business) that the Institution, so far as I understood it did make but little difference in the enterprise, what it offered and what it withheld being only <hi rend="italic">houseroom</hi> and such like; that if she or other friends could find me forty or fifty human beings really desirous to know something about German Literature, I would with perfect promptitude actually open my mouth to them and tell them what I knew. Houseroom we could with all the ease in the world procure for ourselves.<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The lectures were given in Willis&#x2019; Rooms, 26 King St., St. James&#x2019;s St.; originally called Almack&#x2019;s, after the first proprietor in <date when="1765-00-00">1765</date>, they consisted of several rooms, including a ballroom.</note> I have not seen her since; but she asks me to &#x201C;come some <pb id="pg-09-147" n="09:147"/>evening.&#x201D; We shall see whether the thing is not <hi rend="italic">finished</hi> at least. Next year, if I be here and in the same position I really will try it.&#x2014; Good night, my dear Jack: this stooping provokes my <hi rend="italic">cough</hi> terribly. Besides supper is come. I will finish tomorrow. Good night my dear Brother!</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Saturday morning</hi>.&#x2014; Dear Boy, there came no <hi rend="italic">Devil</hi> last night (he means <hi rend="italic">double-tide</hi> tonight, I daresay); so I give you the top of the morning. My cough is still held in abeyance; <foreign><hi rend="italic">hat nichts zu bedeuten</hi></foreign> [it does not mean anything]. The sun will be out about noon; I had one of the finest walks conceivable yesterday in Hyde Park and that region: the first new-born brightness of Spring! It made me happy into the heart.&#x2014; But now to speak a word of Rome. Think not I <hi rend="italic">forget</hi> Rome: ah no! But my own history cannot be known to you; and my affection is well enough known. We are far from interpreting your Roman position as stingily as you seem minded to do. The <hi rend="italic">sixty pounds</hi> of clear fees, there is an item that outweighs many things.<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John had written: &#x201C;My &#x2018;plate&#x2019; has been shining brightly on the common street door inviting all men to come &#x26; be cured &#x26; he that runs may read; but whether the strangers are severally well &#x26; need no curing or go elsewhere to seek it I cannot ascertain. True it is however the invitation seems to produce no practical results. All the patients I have had were sent to me by some of my friends here, and there was nothing so striking about any of their ailments as to leave me room for gaining much credit by them.&#x201D; Nevertheless, he adds: &#x201C;From the above account of my medical prospects you are not to infer that I am altogether without occupation. On the contrary, more than I led you to expect in my last letter, has been already realized, even if I should not gain another farthing till the end of the season. Since my arrival here I have actually received upwards of sixty pounds st<hi rend="italic">g</hi> in fees.&#x201D;</note> I really reckon it very fair; and bid you cheerfully, Go on as you are doing. Never mind the ineradicable universal <hi rend="italic">quackism</hi> of men: so long as one has food and covering to go on with, he has all he ought to wish. By degrees too a man infallibly is known for what he is. If he can work honestly in the meanwhile, let him praise Heaven and work; letting the poor <hi rend="italic">world</hi> talk and welter as it can. Give us still again your authentic Practitioner-bulletin, not extenuating, not exaggerating; and go on with an assured heart. Our Mother sends you expressly her blessing; and will be, as always, right thankful to hear of you. Jenny they say is tolerably well again; but ever since that written Newspaper (which I think must have been Rob&#x2019;s) no direct notice or hint has come from them. I mean to write to my Mother today and send off your Letter. She speaks of Alick as being &#x201C;at Carlisle Market&#x201D;; so I suppose him to be in the Pork again, and to have postponed America;<note n="15" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370305-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1837-03-05">5 March</date></ref>.</note> but here too is nothing direct. A Letter from Jean, <pb id="pg-09-148" n="09:148"/>I find, has been <hi rend="italic">lost;</hi> sent thro&#x2019; some &#x201C;Bank clerk.&#x201D; Another will come soon.</p>
<p>I have not the slightest hint of Will<hi rend="italic">m</hi> Fraser from any side. Mr Dunn I have missed twice; Jane saw him the day before yesterday: Influenza &#x26;c; but he is well again. Anthony Sterling is to arrive at Bourdeaux this day; a visit of some weeks; then back hither. I had a Letter from John last week: he has had <hi rend="italic">two</hi> new attacks (sudden) of spitting of blood, and writes in an uncomfortable agitated manner. His Doctor declares it <hi rend="italic">not</hi> pulmonary yet; but poor John tries to keep himself ready for dying at a day&#x2019;s notice. He speaks with thankfulness of your Letter which he had not then got answered. I wish he were fairly into the summer again. Maurice we have hardly seen: he is writing &#x201C;12 pamphlets&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">one</hi> I have looked at) on some Quaker controversy and other; and advises all of them to&#x2014;return into the bosom of the Church.<note n="16" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Letters to a Member of the Society of Friends</hi> [to Samuel Clarke (<date when="1810-00-00">1810</date>&#x2013;<date when="1875-00-00">75</date>), a Quaker but later a clergyman], published in 12 parts beginning in <date when="1837-01-00">Jan. 1837</date>; later published as <hi rend="italic">The Kingdom of Christ</hi>, 3 vols.

We hope to see him one of these nights, however; Jane has promised him to a certain &#x201C;Erasmus Darwin&#x201D;<note n="17" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Erasmus Alvey Darwin (<date when="1804-00-00">1804</date>&#x2013;<date when="1881-00-00">81</date>) was Charles Darwin&#x2019;s elder brother. He had qualified as a Bachelor of Medicine, but weak health and sufficient means led him to choose a life of leisure: see Grace Calder, &#x201C;Erasmus A. Darwin, Friend of Thomas and Jane Carlyle,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">MLQ</hi>, XX (<date when="1959-00-00">1959</date>), 36&#x2013;48. He was to become the closest friend of the Carlyles outside their family: see K. J. Fielding, &#x201C;Froude&#x2019;s Revenge, Or the Carlyles and Erasmus A. Darwin,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Essays and Studies of the English Association</hi>, ed. W. W. Robson (London, <date when="1978-00-00">1978</date>), who explains that, as far as possible, Froude appears to have left Erasmus Darwin and the Wedgwoods out of his biographical record because of their mutual dislike.

<p>There came a Letter from one Ripley in Boston lately: They are printing a second edit<hi rend="italic">n</hi> of <hi rend="italic">Dr&#xF6;ckh</hi>, and somebody has &#x201C;reviewed it beautiful Ma&#x2019;am&#x201D; in some Yankee Review, which I am to see, please the pigs.

<p>Mill sits &#x2018;excessively busy&#x2019;; very much apart from us, secluded I suppose in Taylordom. I find my friendship for him continue stationary.

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>On Monday last your Letter came, and along with it the Inclosed from Rome: both of them you may guess how welcome. Yours was especially welcome: so wild and fatally unhealthy had the time been; and no news came from you, except James Aitken&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">two strokes</hi>, which served to assure us that nothing very far out of due course had happened. Thanks to Heaven that you are still all safe! Now too when the Spring weather cannot be far off, we will hope this Influenza is about gone; and things may move a little more smoothly. We have had the ugliest weather here too: mud and fog and drizzle. But <date when="1837-02-00">february</date> begins now and then to look out <hi rend="italic">blue;</hi> inexpressibly cheering to one: yesterday I went walking almost the whole day, in the sunshine, blessing Heaven that a New Year was born out of the winter blackness. Many have died; many in very sorrowful circumstances. The funeral bell never ceased <foreign><hi rend="italic">jowling</hi></foreign> [clanging] here for week after week: it was quite doleful to hear and see. Jane, as I told you, seemed to be getting round when I wrote last; but she went out too early, and fell back again, and had to struggle on amid great coughing tho&#x2019; not nearly so <hi rend="italic">sick</hi> as the first time: she is now very nearly clear once <pb id="pg-09-151" n="09:151"/>more: and all looks better round us. I never took the malady; I have twice had flying whiffs of cold, but they never got deeper than the <hi rend="italic">roots of the nose</hi> or thereby: I escaped in that way. Old Mr Bradfute, as you might perhaps notice, has been carried off in Edinburgh. We did not hear of it till thro&#x2019; the Newspapers.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In the <hi rend="italic">Dumfries Courier</hi>, <date when="1837-02-01">1 Feb.</date></note> He died sitting on his chair; in the gentlest manner. He has bequeathed to Jane a <hi rend="italic">Book</hi>, of which she was fond when a child! His property has gone mainly I suppose to Mr Aitken Minister of Minto, who married Miss Stoddart very lately;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Bradfute had taken particular care to ensure that his property remained Eliza&#x2019;s, though administered by his trustees, of whom David Aitken was one. See <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370217-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1837-02-17">17 Feb.</date></ref></note> an asthmatic, goodnatured, very innocent kind of man, whom you perhaps remember at Comley Bank.</p>
<p>Jean&#x2019;s Letter thro&#x2019; the Bank never came: I sent them a little Note last week in a frank Mrs Welsh was getting. The first <hi rend="italic">Herald</hi> came on Wednesday; dreadfully <hi rend="italic">dirty;</hi> and was instantaneously sent on. I have written this day to Jack. James Aitken forgot his <hi rend="italic">strokes</hi> on the Courier this week; which indeed set us a-guessing: but he sent off a <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> next day <hi rend="italic">with</hi> strokes,&#x2014;like a considerate man as he is. I send that <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> to you; it will perhaps come with the Letter; or at least only a day before it. Alick gets his <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi> back, now that the <hi rend="italic">Herald</hi> is under way. Does Jenny send you the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> rightly? I have twice forgotten to send it off on Mondays to her; tho&#x2019; it was lying wrapt up on the table: I sally out about two o&#x2019;clock, and then if I have forgot it, we are too late for that day before I get back. I know not if you care much for it; to me it is but dull enough: one is weary of the everlasting jargonning; and, when a thing has been said five hundred times, would fain have some <hi rend="italic">other</hi> thing said. But that is the trade of an Editor: to be <hi rend="italic">fresh</hi> always, as new-drawn wine, and ready to repeat his doctrine thousands of times if hundreds will not do. That is the nature of Fonblanque (the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> Editor); who is otherwise, I think, the cleverest man living of that craft at present. The <hi rend="italic">Dumfries Times</hi> man,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Harkness, who had succeeded Robert Douglas as editor in <date when="1835-00-00">1835</date>.</note> again, whom I have never chanced to fall in with before, seems if not the very dullest, not far from that. We will leave them, however, these Able Editors; to struggle on, and do the best they can.</p>
<p>Our printing gets forward here, not in the most regular way; yet gets forward. Sometimes they keep me busy, tumbling among all sorts of rubbish, broken pieces of paper, books, slips, ink and <pb id="pg-09-152" n="09:152"/>confusion,&#x2014;really like a man <foreign><hi rend="italic">dighting</hi></foreign> [sifting] chaffy corn in a barn, for the whole blessed day: then again they will give me holiday for two days. I endeavour to conform, &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">owther</hi> way.&#x201D; But so does the Book <hi rend="italic">go on</hi> at any rate; and comes out, like <foreign><hi rend="italic">dighted</hi></foreign> corn, tho&#x2019; only in <foreign><hi rend="italic">wecht</hi>fuls</foreign>,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The amount contained in a <foreign>wecht</foreign>, a wooden hoop, two or three feet in diameter and covered with stretched skin or canvas, which is used to winnow corn and also to carry or store potatoes or grain (cf. <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi>, intro. Ian Campbell, p. 14).</note> leaving cartloads of chaff and <foreign><hi rend="italic">cav</hi>ings</foreign> [short, broken straw]. I think it will not be so bad a Book, &#x201C;after all, Mother.&#x201D; It is a Book at any rate that makes no <hi rend="italic">complaint</hi> about itself; but steps out in a quite peaceable manner, hoping nothing, fearing nothing: indeed, I never knew till now on looking at it this second time, what a burly <hi rend="italic">torque</hi> of a thing it was,&#x2014;a perfect oak-<hi rend="italic">clog</hi> [log], which all the hammers in the world will make no impression on. Of human things it is perhaps likest a kind of civilized <hi rend="italic">Andrew Bishop</hi> the old crier of ballads!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Untraced.</note> The same invincible breadth of body; a shaggy smile on its face, and a depth of voice equal to that of Andrew! Many a man will find it a hard nut to crack. But it is <hi rend="italic">they</hi> that have to crack it; happily not I any more.&#x2014; We are hardly two-thirds thro&#x2019; the first volume yet. It will be a Book of almost the same size and shape as Wilhelm Meister; but with more in it; the type smaller, the volumes too a little thicker. So it flounders on, you see, towards fulfillment. Fraser has set a <hi rend="italic">second</hi> Printer to a new volume of it; being clear to have it &#x201C;out in time&#x201D;: this second Printer has a good lump of Manuscript, but has sent no printing yet.&#x2014; Did I tell you, they were printing a second edition of Teufelsdr&#xF6;ckh in America? This one is to be 1000 Copies; the first, which was but 500, being all sold. It is really curious enough to see how things have to struggle in this world,&#x2014;just as men have; and do struggle, and if there is any stuff in them do not struggle quite in vain.</p>
<p>I sent off a lot of <hi rend="italic">Diamond Necklaces;</hi> one for every individual of you, I think; the other day. They are to go by Edin<hi rend="italic">r,</hi> and then by Thornhill Templand; after that to Dumfries, from which to Annan and Scotsbrig. There are some <hi rend="italic">Mirabeaus</hi> too: not too many however. There is scarcely the slightest chance of your seeing aught of them till the <date when="1837-03-00">beginning of March</date>; very probably they will go no farther than Fraser&#x2019;s shop till the end of this month. I have even sent one to Jenny at Manchester. In fine if they never come at all these things (which, however, is not likely), do not regret them; for they are not <pb id="pg-09-153" n="09:153"/>worth much. I have sent one to Will<hi rend="italic">m</hi> Grahame; to whom I have not written for many long months.&#x2014; There has been considerable confused-noise made about these two Articles here, I believe; but happily I hear almost nothing of it. It is inane jargon in general, that sort of thing; and &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">can di&#x2019; thee neither ill na&#x2019; good</hi>.&#x201D;</p>
<p>I am sorry Alick was not with you to send a Postscript. I am very anxious to know what he is employed in, and how he speeds. Is he trying the Pork again? Tell him that he must find a little leisure, and write. But as for you dear Mother, I really will never more accept any excuses in the writing way from you. There is no better Letter-writer needed for me. And surely it is a great blessing that you have acquired that faculty, and can help yourself independently, now when it is so useful to many of us. With a set of <hi rend="italic">lines</hi> under your paper, or without lines, you have only to set to work any day you please, and produce a Letter, the emblem of your thoughts in some genuine sort; and then the Post will carry it to the end of the world for you, if your loved ones were there. I call it a great acquisition.</p>
<p>As to the Hams and Oatmeal, I believe it will be better for the present to do nothing. We have milk with milk-<hi rend="italic">sops</hi> to supper; this I find does well enough. Bacon one does not need always; and they have it tolerable in the shops. We are all so uncertain at present; it will be better to wait at least.&#x2014;&#x2014; Jane has written to her Mother to come off hither so soon as the weather mends (in <date when="1837-04-00">April</date> perhaps), and stay with her thro&#x2019; the summer; this is the arrangement that will suit her best; and I surely think Mrs Welsh will come. As for me, I have resolved on the other hand thus far that I will <hi rend="italic">not</hi> spend next summer <hi rend="italic">here;</hi> but go somewhere, where I can lie asleep and be forgotten and hidden from all persons, and on the whole <hi rend="italic">well</hi>, extremely <hi rend="italic">well let alone!</hi> This is literally the thing that I feel will profit me above all others. I think I shall really be much <hi rend="italic">better</hi>, both in mind and body, after this rough wrestle with the Book,&#x2014;if I were once well rested. Now the question rises therefore: Whitherward to go? I have fixed nothing; it depends on Jack, on many things: but surely I think of Scotland and Scotsbrig among the first! If I come to Scotsbrig, I will do nothing but <hi rend="italic">ride</hi>, and read a little; and speak no word to any man outside of those four walls. I am determined to be <hi rend="italic">well let alone</hi>. Jamie shall have notice to buy me some sort of swift quadruped in good time;&#x2014;not of the &#x201C;dwarf carthorse&#x201D; sort. It shall go hard but I will see you. Two months more will show us better how it can be, and should be.</p>
<p>The Lecturing project which I spoke of (did I not?) seems to <pb id="pg-09-154" n="09:154"/>have ended without effect for this year: the &#x201C;Courses of Lectures&#x201D; in that Royal Institution they were thinking of are &#x201C;all filled up for the present season.&#x201D; So much has been ascertained, only very lately. It is still possible it may be had <hi rend="italic">otherwise</hi> (perhaps in some &#x201C;Institution&#x201D; or Hired Apartment of our own); but not very likely now. Next year I have a great notion to try it. If nothing can be done that way, why then nothing can be done; and we must try another way.</p>
<p>But I must close this up: the sun is getting out in spite of a showery morning, and I ought to fare forth and take the good of it. Blessed sun! it is sent to all living; and the whole wealth of the Bank of England is not equal to a beam of it. We hope it will get the length of Annan too; I find our loud <hi rend="italic">wind</hi> last week was loud with you as well.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Dumfries Courier</hi>, <date when="1837-02-15">15 Feb.</date>, reported two gales in Dumfriesshire on <date when="1837-02-09">9</date> and <date when="1837-02-11">11 Feb.</date></note> Finally these hideous wet-blankets of cloud-vapours must get away, and summer come back to us.</p>
<p>We wish Mary well thro&#x2019; her task; and trust it <hi rend="italic">will</hi> be all right with her.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mary had given birth to William, about <date when="1837-02-14">14 Feb.</date> He died <date when="1838-04-05">5 April 1838</date>, after convulsions.</note> Jane sends kindest wishes to that effect,&#x2014;special thanks for Mary&#x2019;s little Postscript, it is a <hi rend="italic">hand</hi> she always likes. To you she bids me say she has been meaning to write this long while; but has grown &#x201C;wretched ill o&#x2019;t,&#x201D; of late; while you are grown so <hi rend="italic">good</hi>.&#x2014; By the bye will somebody tell me what the names of the three new children are? Jamie&#x2019;s, Jean&#x2019;s, Alick&#x2019;s?<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alick replied in his letter of <date when="1837-02-28">28 Feb.</date> (see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18361229-TC-JCA-01">TC to JCA, <date when="1836-12-29">29 Dec. 1836</date></ref>).</note> They have all names, not a doubt of it; and I hope will grow to carry them between five and six feet from the ground yet, and do credit to them:&#x2014;but it is really fit that I knew what they were!</p>
<p>If you see Ben Nelson give him my remembrances; and say John complains he has never yet heard of Edward. I have always a very genuine esteem for Ben.</p>
<p>And now with kind brotherly and filial affection to you all every one, I must lay down the pen. The <hi rend="italic">Printer&#x2019;s-devil</hi> (so they call the little Boy that comes and goes) will be here tonight with work, work!

<dateline><place>Chelsea</place>, Wednesday Night [<date when="1837-02-22">22 February 1837</date>]&#x2014;</dateline>
<salute>My dear Mill,</salute>
<p>Two days ago I undertook to write to you about that Article of Hunt&#x2019;s: I have not had time till now.</p>
<p>Hunt has carefully studied his <hi rend="italic">Lady Mary;</hi> has marked it and meditated it; but not yet put pen to paper. It is of considerable moment to him that he get published this Number (at least that he get <hi rend="italic">paid</hi> this Number). I told him my impression was that your rule did not admit of anything being given in to the Printer after the <date when="1837-03-12">12<hi rend="italic">th</hi> of March</date>. Hunt can be ready at the <date when="1837-03-12">12<hi rend="italic">th</hi> of March</date>: at the <date when="1837-03-01">1st of March</date> he cannot be ready. His Article he cannot yet guess at in regard to number of pages; but he thinks it will not be a short Article;&#x2014;it shall not be longer than there is good interesting stuff to carry him.</p>
<p>On these data I write to you, that taking them into estimate, and predicting from them, you may help so far as possible to spare the worthy man from disappointment,&#x2014;which lying unprinted always is, and will be to him more than to another. His address is 4. Upper Cheyne Row, Chelsea. Shall he get ready for the <date when="1837-03-12">12<hi rend="italic">th</hi></date>, with some assurance that you will be ready for him then? Or were it better that he delayed altogether till next N<hi rend="italic">o?</hi> If you do not like writing to him, write to me and I will communicate it.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mill replied to Carlyle the next day: &#x201C;Mr Hunt&#x2019;s Article will be in time if it be not later than the <date when="1837-03-12">12<hi rend="italic">th</hi> of March</date>: and whether it be printed or not in this No (tho&#x2019; I am anxious that it should) I undertake that he shall be paid for it&#x201D; (Mineka, XII, 328). It was published in the <date when="1837-04-00">April</date> issue (see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18361125-TC-JSM-01">TC to JSM, [<date when="1836-11-25">25 Nov. 1836</date>]</ref>).</note></p>
<p>The sheets of the First Volume of that F.R. will probably be ready for you in about a fortnight: surely not sooner. Our <hi rend="italic">second</hi> Printer has not &#x201C;the identical sort of types&#x201D; &#x26;c &#x26;c: I have not seen the mark of his existence yet.</p>
<p>The Copies of <hi rend="italic">Mirabeau</hi> had come about the time you wrote, tho&#x2019; I could not get to see for some days after, and they were not sent hither. They were just in the right season; a baker&#x2019;s-dozen of them: they are now all travelling on their various highways; and we happily have done with them.</p>

Because of exaggerated governmental fears of any remotely revolutionary activity their trials were blatantly rigged and their sentences of 14 years (for all but Palmer who was given 7) were out of all proportion to their supposed crime of sedition.

Fergus O&#x2019;Connor proposed an amendment in favour of &#x201C;universal suffrage&#x201D; as a more fitting memorial. According to the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, <date when="1837-02-21">21 Feb.</date>, the meeting became &#x201C;turmoil indescribable&#x201D; and, Hume having left the chair and the meeting after losing control, &#x201C;the ultra-Radicals then &#x2026; spoke until the room was completely empty.&#x201D; However the <hi rend="italic">Globe</hi>, <date when="1837-02-21">21 Feb.</date>, reports that both motion and amendment were duly and properly passed.

<salute>My dear Miss Wilson,</salute>
<p>I did not call, or send any message, yesterday because the day being so wet I had got nothing done. Today I called for Miss Martineau, who cheerfully undertook to negotiate with Saunders &#x26; Ottley for the opening of a Book. The Inscription I gave her (with power to anybody better informed in these things to alter it) was: &#x201C;Course of Lectures on German Literature by Mr Carlyle / (After Easter) /.&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The subject was unchanged and the lectures have not survived.</note> I suppose, she will settle it in the course of tomorrow: on Monday morning this Book-of-Fate will be lying opened.&#x2014; <supplied>[I]</supplied> must beg Mr Wilson to step forward here; and be Secretary and acting Manager,&#x2014;and in short to do all manner of things for me, which I am incapable of doing for myself.</p>
<p>Arriving at home, I found your Note.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> The list of Ladyships and honourable women inspires me with a kind of terror. I hope it is as intelligent daughters of Eve, desirous of learning somewhat, and not as mere Titular Divinities that they draw near to us: God knows it is in the <hi rend="italic">former</hi> capacity alone that I shall have anything comfortable to tell them.&#x2014; However, I suppose their names are of great importance, as an inducement to others. I am much obliged to Taylor.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably Henry Taylor.</note></p>
<p>As to Rooms &#x26;c I am <hi rend="italic">innocent</hi> as the babe unborn. Mr Wilson is again and again entreated to interpose between me and <hi rend="italic">Willis</hi>.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370217-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1837-02-17">17 Feb.</date></ref></note></p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>You will do us a real favour if you can consent to come over and take tea with us tonight. Two <hi rend="italic">violets</hi> are coming (in a voluntary manner);<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf.

This would suggest that Hunt had written it by now and shown it to Carlyle, to whom Hunt refers in the poem as &#x201C;some talker renown&#x2019;d,&#x2014;my Carlyle&#x201D; (Canto I, 57).</note> great friends of yours: Miss Martineau;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hunt refers to her in Canto II, 196&#x2013;200.</note> and Mrs Marsh,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Anne Marsh (see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370201-JWC-JOST-01">JWC to <sic>JS</sic><corr>JOST</corr>, <date when="1837-02-01">1 Feb.</date></ref>, where Jane describes her as one of Carlyle&#x2019;s &#x201C;fair intellectuals&#x201D;).</note> whose works I do not know, but whose face pleases me much. There are only these two; perhaps even these may not come.</p>
<p>Now your plan would be, if you had the proper audacity, to let us see your face about six, to tea with <hi rend="italic">ourselves:</hi> we should then have our own talk, independently of all people. When the <hi rend="italic">violets</hi> come, you could take a look of them; and, if you did not like them (which is infinitely improbable, for Harriet too is really an excellent creature), leave them to their fate!</p>
<p>Finally, my dear Sir, if you cannot come, scruple not for a moment to refuse. Alas, I know too well the moods one gets into; the engagements one may have, unseen save to oneself; and how impertinent a thing Speech may be, tho&#x2019; otherwise said to be cheerfuller than light itself.</p>
<p>I am held very busy with Printers Devils. <closer><salute>I remain always,</salute></closer></p>

Sometimes I am half persuaded that there is (in co<supplied>[c]</supplied>kney dialect) &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">a</hi> <hi rend="small-caps">do</hi> <hi rend="italic">at the bottom on it&#x201D;;</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-08/lt-18360401-JWC-HW-01">JWC to HW, <date when="1836-04-01">1 April 1836</date></ref>.</note> medical men all over the world having merely entered into a tacit agreement to call all sorts of maladies people are liable to, in cold weather, by one name, so that one sort of treatment may serve for all, and their practice be thereby greatly simplified. In more candid moments, however, I cannot help thinking that it has something to do with the &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">diffusion of useful knowledge&#x2019;:</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A mocking reference to the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge (see <ref target="volume-05/lt-18300320-TC-JPE-01"><sic>5:84</sic><corr>TC to JPE, <date when="1830-03-20">20 March 1830</date></corr></ref>); see also Mineka, XII, 33.</note>&#x2014;if not a part of that knowledge, at least that it is meant as a counterpoise, so that our minds may be preserved in equilibrium; between the consciousness of our enormous acquirements on the one hand, and on the other the <hi rend="italic">generally diffused</hi> experience, that all the acquirements in the world are not worth a rush to one compared with the blessedness of having a head clear of snifters! However it be; I am thankful to Heaven, that I was the chosen victim in this house, instead of my Husband. For had he been laid up at present, there would have been the very devil to pay. He has <hi rend="small-caps">two</hi> Printers on his book that it may if possible be got published in <date when="1837-04-00">April</date>; and it <hi rend="italic">will</hi> hardly be well off his hands when he is to deliver <pb id="pg-09-160" n="09:160"/>a course of lectures on German Literature to &#x2018;Lords and Gentlemen&#x2019; and &#x2018;honourable women not a few.&#x2019; You wonder how he is to get thro&#x2019; such a thing; so do I&#x2014;very sincerely, the more, as he purposes to speak these lectures <foreign>extempore</foreign>, Heaven bless the mark! having indeed no leisure to prepare them, before the time at which they will be wanted. One of his Lady-admirers (by the way he is getting a vast number of Lady admirers) was saying the other day that the grand danger to be feared for him was, that he should commence with &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">Gentlemen and Ladies</hi>&#x2019; instead of &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">Ladies and Gentlemen</hi>,&#x2019; a transmutation which would ruin him at the very outset. He vows however that he will say neither the one thing nor the other; and I believe him very secure on that side. Indeed I should as soon look to see gold pieces or penny loaves drop out of his mouth, as to hear from it any such hum-drum unrepublican-like commonplace. If he finds it necessary to address his audience by any particular designation it will be thus; &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">Men and Women</hi>&#x2019;! or perhaps in my Penfillan Grandfather&#x2019;s<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Her paternal grandfather, John Welsh; see <ref target="volume-02/lt-18230606-JBW-TC-01"><sic>2:369&#x2013;70</sic><corr>JBW to TC, <date when="1823-06-06">6 June 1823</date></corr></ref>.</note> style &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Fool-creatures come here for diversion</hi><supplied>[.]</supplied>&#x201D; On the whole if his hearers be reasonable, and are content that there be good sense in the things he says without requiring that he should furnish them with brains to find it out; I have no doubt but his success will be emminent [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>].

There are several things in this world which once set a-going, it is not easy to stop; and <hi rend="italic">the Book</hi> is one of them. I have been thinking that perhaps the readiest way of&#x2014;bringing him to a <foreign><hi rend="italic">cetera desunt</hi></foreign> [a stop, rather than a conclusion]&#x2014;(<hi rend="italic">conclusion</hi> is out of the question) would be <hi rend="italic">just</hi> as the clock strikes four to have a lighted cigar laid on the table before him&#x2014;we shall see! The <hi rend="italic">French Revolution</hi> done, and the Lectures done; he is going somewhere (to Scotland most probably) to rest himself a while&#x2014;to lie about the roots of hedges and speak to no man, woman, or child, except in monosyllables! a reasonable project enough considering the worry he has been kept in for almost three years back. For my part having neither published nor lectured, I feel no call to refresh myself by such temporary descent from my orbit under the waves, and in Shakespearean dialect, I had such a &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">bellyful</hi>&#x2019;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Cymbeline,</hi> II, i.</note> of travelling <pb id="pg-09-161" n="09:161"/>last year as is likely to quell my appetite in that way for some time to come.

<p>Early in <date when="1837-01-00">January 1837</date> it must have been when book on &#x2018;French Revolution&#x2019; was finished. I wrote the last paragraph of it here (within a yard of where I now am) in her presence one evening after dinner. Damp tepid kind of evening, still by daylight, read it to her or left her to read it; probably with a &#x2018;Thank God, it is done, Jeannie!&#x2019; and then walked out up the Gloucester Road towards Kensington way: don&#x2019;t remember coming back, or indeed anything quite distinct for three or four months after. My thoughts were by no means of an exultant character: pacifically gloomy rather, something of sullenly <pb id="pg-09-162" n="09:162"/>contemptuous in them, of clear hope (except in the &#x2018;desperate&#x2019; kind) not the smallest glimpse. I had said to her, perhaps that very day, &#x2018;I know not whether this book is worth anything, nor what the world will do with it, or misdo, or entirely forbear to do (as is likeliest), but this I could tell the world: You have not had for a hundred years any book that came more direct and flamingly sincere from the heart of a living man; do with it what you like, you&#x2014;&#x2014;!&#x2019; My poor little Jeannie and me, hasn&#x2019;t it nearly killed us both? This also I might have said, had I liked it, for it was true. My health was much spoiled; hers too by sympathy, by daily helping me to struggle with the intolerable load. I suppose by this time our money, too, was near done: busy friends, the Wilsons principally, Miss Martineau, and various honourable women, were clear that I ought now to lecture on &#x2018;German Literature,&#x2019; a sure financial card, they all said; and set to shaping, organising, and multifariously consulting about the thing; which I unwillingly enough, but seeing clearly there was no other card in my hand at all, was obliged to let them do. The printing of &#x2018;French Revolution,&#x2019; push as I might, did not end till far on in <date when="1837-04-00">April</date>&#x2014; &#x2018;Lectures,&#x2019; six of them, of which I could form no image or conjecture beforehand, were to begin with <date when="1837-05-00">May</date>.&#x2014;<name>T.C.</name></p></ps>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>You can judge whether your last Letter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dated <date when="1837-02-28">28 Feb.</date> Alick had said, in part: &#x201C;I think I mentioned to you when I last wrote; that I had again begun the trade of pork-curing &#x2026; it is still uncertain whether it pay or not. &#x2026; I did not offer for Graham&#x2019;s <foreign><hi rend="italic">clout</hi></foreign> [patch] of land I told you of. Indeed farms are grown deer and scarce out of all bounds this year&#x2014;so that there no longer remains any hope in that direction. I have also ascertained, to my own satisfaction at least that there is not any kind of opening whatever in or about Annan for a creature of my temprament. &#x2026; I may also remark here, that this <foreign><hi rend="italic">whiffling</hi> higgling</foreign> half villanous way of life I am leading, is a thing not at all to my mind. &#x2026; What I want, if I may be said to know my own wants, is a spot of mother earth, where by the labour of &#x2018;these four bones&#x2019; one could procure &#x2018;meat and cloaths and fire.&#x2019; Our beggarly task-masters in this poor country yield you readily enough the labour, but too often wish to withold the meat and cloaths and fire. But thank Heaven there are still room and rewards for honest industry in the uncultivated forests of America.&#x201D;</note> produced an impression on me. I have thought of little else ever since I got it. From hour to <pb id="pg-09-163" n="09:163"/>hour the thought of what you tell me comes up, whenever there is any cessation of the huge bustle I am kept in: a thought sorrowful and stern, yet not without some kind of stern blessedness in it. You have not prospered in this our Home-land tho&#x2019; making a manful long-continued effort to do it; you resolve that there are other lands where you may go and try anew. It is infinitely sad to me to remember how I was whirled away from your sight at Annan-foot last time we parted; and now&#x2014;when we may meet next, God in His goodness only knows! But it beseems us to do what is needful to be done. Quietly, however painfully, we should do it. Nay in America itself I will still trust to see you; and what is more, under better circumstances than our wont was. Neither should our dear Mother grieve,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alick had said: &#x201C;were it not for the love of our poor dear M<supplied>[other I could]</supplied> with comparative indifference, say farewell.&#x201D;</note> nor will she, as those that have not hope. She knows that on this side of the Ocean as on that, nay in Death itself as well as in Life, we <supplied>[are]</supplied> all alike under God&#x2019;s eye: our kind thoughts too can follow one another, constant unimpeded, tho&#x2019; our bodily footsteps cannot. My Mother too may perhaps go to America and the whole set of us root and branch! Far older Emigrants than she have gone. It is becoming a country this, which all quietly industrious poor and faithful men, ought, one would say, to be in haste to quit. No improvement in it, but the reverse and ever worse, down I doubt to mutual violence and killing, seems to be predictable.&#x2014; Your resolution, painful to me as it may well be, is one that I dare not say <hi rend="italic">Give up.</hi></p>
<p>I have written to Mr Greig;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Greig (see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18360205-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1836-02-05">5 Feb. 1836</date></ref>). Alick had asked Carlyle to write to him.</note> I have described accurately your situation, character, capabilities as to money, faculty, &#x26;c; and asked him, as a &#x201C;favour done to myself twice over,&#x201D; to give what furtherance he can. He lives in New York State; not far from the borders of Canada: the place is called Cana<supplied>[n]</supplied>daigua. I believe he owns much land, or did own and has settled it; and possesses great influence in that region. He seemed to me an especially good kind of man: of great sagacity, integrity; of a <foreign><hi rend="italic">douce</hi></foreign>, solid, sagacious very wholesome and sufficient make of mind. Grahame of Burnswark knows him and can tell you about him. Grahame also I think, has a Brother in New York.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Graham, a merchant; see also Marrs, pp. 43&#x2013;44.</note> Do not Emigrants go thither in the first place?&#x2014;Greig&#x2019;s Letter tho&#x2019; written cannot go off, I understand, till the <date when="1837-03-10">tenth of this month</date>. His answer at the very shortest will take another month and more. <pb id="pg-09-164" n="09:164"/>That brings us into the <date when="1837-05-00">middle of May</date> before we can hear from him. He is nearly sure to write, unless the Letter miscarry, which there is small danger of; and also to send us some advice which will be worth listening to. But whether it will do for you to wait so long in expectation of it? We should have had it off two months ago. And yet, I remember, there were Emigrants in the Steamboat I went off to London in three years ago, near the Whitsunday time; nay Jane still later found such. You will determine what it is possible and fit to do; tell me in what thing soever now or while we live I have power to help you, and it shall be heartily attempted, done if in me it be. It is fair, and my part; never in any difficulty did I speak to you but your help was ready, as if it had belonged to me by nature. Courage, therefore, my brave Brother! Let us stand to it; let us front it, fasten on it, this &#x201C;black imbroglio&#x201D;; and wrestle with it for life: it shall not <hi rend="italic">beat</hi> us while life, any fraction of life, is left.&#x2014; You must write to me as soon as you can possibly make up your mind as to the course you will follow, or as to any <hi rend="italic">part</hi> of the course; and on the whole, let me be in clear communication with you, and in possession of all your difficulties, resolutions and procedure.</p>
<p>For me it is determined that I am not to get to Scotland till <date when="1837-06-00">June</date> at soonest. That scheme of <hi rend="italic">Lecturing,</hi> that I have mentioned more than once, is to take effect here! The people of the &#x201C;Royal Institution&#x201D; (a kind of sublim<supplied>[e <hi rend="italic">Me</hi>]</supplied><hi rend="italic">chanics&#x2019; Institute</hi> for the upper Classes) were &#x201C;all filled up for this year,&#x201D; when my friends got the inquiry made: but I remarked thereupon that there was nothing in that&#x2014;&#x201C;forty or fifty human beings wanting to hear about German Literature, and one human being ready to tell them somewhat about it: <hi rend="italic">this</hi> is the soul and body of the business; we get house-room anywhere we want, and are independent of all the Institutions in the world!&#x201D; They snatched at this saying; and have set about it with might and main; and a room is secured, and <hi rend="italic">books</hi> are opened, and <hi rend="italic">tickets</hi> printing, and the Marchionness of Landsdowne<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Louisa Emma, <foreign>n&#xE9;e</foreign> Fox-Strangways (<date when="1785-00-00">1785</date>&#x2013;<date when="1851-00-00">1851</date>), 5<hi rend="italic">th</hi> daughter of 2nd Earl of Ilchester, wife of Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice, 3rd Marquis of Landsdowne (<date when="1780-00-00">1780</date>&#x2013;<date when="1863-00-00">1863</date>). She was principal Lady of the Bedchamber, <date when="1837-00-00">1837</date>&#x2013;<date when="1838-00-00">38</date>.</note> and great quantities of Ladyships volunteer to come; and it is fixed for the <date when="1837-05-00">first week of May</date>; and all going on like a house on fire! A kind of shudder runs thro&#x2019; my whole heart when I think of it. However, it is a thing I have long wanted and meant to try; and so now I will try it: and doubtless get thro&#x2019; it better or worse. On the <date when="1837-05-00">first week of May</date>, between 3 and 4 afternoon, two days each week, till my <hi rend="italic">six</hi> lectures are completed,&#x2014;there <pb id="pg-09-165" n="09:165"/>are to be happily only six: this is the arrangement. I am to <hi rend="italic">speak</hi> my Lectures (that is the terror!) I have not a moment&#x2019;s time to write them. We must and will be thro&#x2019; it; that is the short and the long!&#x2014;&#x2014; In the mean time nothing can excel the confusion I am kept in with my <hi rend="italic">two</hi> Printers; for they are both now at work, and most irregular workers they are. I sit sometimes, the whole day, up to the armpits as it were amid papers printed and manuscript; books, papers and paper-clippings! They <hi rend="italic">must</hi> however be done by and by,&#x2014;perhaps by the <date when="1837-04-00">middle of April</date>. The first Volume is nearly all <hi rend="italic">set up,</hi> I shall perhaps see the last of it forever in about a week. Then there is a Printer to each Volume; and gallop, &#x201C;lick for lash thro&#x2019; the Stanwix&#x201D;; we have left &#x201C;the Ricker-gate and Roan&#x2019;s&#x201D;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-09/lt-18361202-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1836-12-02">2 Dec. 1836</date></ref>.</note> a while ago. The Book is going to be very considerably thicker than I expected;&#x2014;as long to <hi rend="italic">read</hi> as a <hi rend="italic">Meister</hi> and a half, I will guess&#x2014; Did you get the two little things (pamphlets) I sent you (by Glasgow, Templand and Dumfries)? There was one of each sort for you. The <hi rend="italic">Necklace</hi> was the last thing I wrote at Puttoch, or ever shall write.&#x2014; James Aitken ought also to have got an American Review of Teufelsdr&#xF6;ckh; wh<supplied>[ich]</supplied> you will surely see, and like: they are extremely good to me these Yankees, and I am a great object there!</p>
<p>As you say nothing about health, I infer that your household has escaped this sad Influenza. We have had a bout of it here: at least Jane has; six weeks of pining and coughing: it never fairly laid hold of me; but kept <hi rend="italic">mining</hi> at the outworks, and has finally I hope gone its ways. The bitter bleak weather is not good for one. I wish I were stronger for my lecturing: but I must do as I can.&#x2014; If I prosper in this trial, I think I will let the Yankees hear me some day! Then comes <hi rend="italic">tea</hi> to be made by Jenny were it out of the Mississippi water!&#x2014; Courage my brave Alick! All lands are homes to the brave man. I feel as if the leaf were going to turn with me perhaps for the better with sickness of body and one thing and another I have had since I was fifteen, a very grim existence of it too. Let us hope and endeavour, and silently trust!&#x2014; Jane charges me to send you her most affectionate wishes. Do not forget me to to [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] the young Janet; nor nor [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] to the old. Tell our Mother those news of mine: I will write to her if I find a moment, but if I find none, she will easily understand and excuse. Many thanks for putting right the slates, for putting up the <foreign>swey</foreign>;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >As well as mending Mrs. Carlyle&#x2019;s roof Alick had &#x201C;hung her a little <foreign><hi rend="italic">swey</hi></foreign> [a metal bar that swings out for hanging pots over the fire].&#x201D;</note> and the little keg of ale! A <foreign><hi rend="italic">thrawn</hi></foreign> [perverse] body but a <pb id="pg-09-166" n="09:166"/>kind one!&#x2014; <closer><salute>God be with you, and guide you whither it is right to go, my dear Brother! I remain now and ever, Your faithful and affectionate,</salute></closer><name>T. Carlyle</name></p>
<ps><p>We both congratulate poor Mary after her fight; and trust the new William will do nothing but well.</p></ps>

<p>There is a frank going to M&#x2019;Diarmid about the House at Craigenputtoch, which a man, some man or other from East Lothian, speaks of probably &#x201C;taking for for [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] a time.&#x201D; Still more probably <hi rend="italic">not</hi> &#x201C;taking&#x201D;; only plaguing me with writing of!&#x2014; However I have snatched an hour to write this inclosed Letter for Alick; and surely a minute on the cover is due to you.&#x2014; You have not the smallest conception how busy I am kept. Since Alick&#x2019;s Letter was done, for example, just this minute there has come in the last Proofsheets of Volume First (two of them and more): abundant work for what remains of this day and the whole morrow. Happily they are the <hi rend="italic">last</hi> of that Volume! Two Printers are now busy: soon in <date when="1837-04-00">April</date> <supplied>[i]</supplied>t will be over.</p>
<p>Alick writes to me that you have had <hi rend="italic">jaundice;</hi> a miserable bilious complaint, proceeding from the liver. He represents you as better. I hope and pray you may get <hi rend="italic">well</hi> fully, without delay: ill health is a sad clog on every thing. On the other, &#x201C;little James&#x201D; he says is a fine thriving fellow: this will be a great comfort to you.&#x2014; I sent big James a Pamphlet by M&#x2019;Kie&#x2014;did he get it? It was an American Review of Teufelsdr&#xF6;ckh: a Bookseller shewed it me in a shop one day, and I could not but buy it, and send it for some comfort to you. When you have all seen it, or in the course of your seeing it, as the thing may suit, let Mrs Welsh get a glimpse of it. The Book is my Mother&#x2019;s: but she will not grudge Templand a week of it.&#x2014; Likewise there went off towards Templand and you a bundle of <hi rend="italic">Necklaces</hi> (&#x26; <hi rend="italic">Mirabeaus</hi> too, as it proved)<supplied>[.]</supplied> Have they ever come? Let James indicate by <hi rend="italic">one</hi> stroke on the next Paper that he has got the Yankee <pb id="pg-09-167" n="09:167"/>review (if he have got it); then, as before agreed on, by <hi rend="italic">three</hi> on some other Paper, when the Templand things come. Unless you will write a long Letter, or even a short Letter, without loss of time?&#x2014; I have written to America about poor Alick;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >To John Greig; not found.</note> and could <foreign><hi rend="italic">greet</hi></foreign> [weep] for <foreign><hi rend="italic">wae</hi>ness</foreign>, but that would serve purpose, I believe, at bottom, it is the only wise thing to be determined on. May God prosper it! I pray and hope!&#x2014; In Alick&#x2019;s Letter is an account how I <hi rend="italic">am</hi> to lecture here; the instant this Book is off! &#x201C;In the <date when="1837-05-00">first week of May</date>:&#x201D; I declare I shudder to consider it. Yet it is very right, and fit, and must be done: we will &#x201C;<foreign>welter</foreign> [stagger] thro&#x2019; it,&#x201D; one way or another; we never stuck in the middle of anything hitherto.&#x2014; The <hi rend="italic">Herald</hi> came in right time last week; tho&#x2019; I think James could have made no new arrangement with the Hannings. The week before it was <hi rend="italic">four days</hi> too late, and again dirty: <hi rend="italic">another</hi> day and it would not have gone at all. I understand Rob and Jenny have plenty of Newspapers quite accessible to them. It will be better therefore to send this same <hi rend="italic">Herald</hi> hither direct;&#x2014;unless some of you that are punctual, and without snuff-drops<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370217-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1837-02-17">17 Feb.</date></ref></note> can profit by it for a day? Monday is the soonest I <hi rend="italic">can</hi> get it; Monday corresponds to your Saturday. Your James appears to me to be the only entirely punctual man, except myself, of the whole set. I will see you this summer surely! Till <date when="1837-06-00">June</date> it is not to be tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> of now. <closer><salute>God bless you both!</salute></closer></p>

<ps><p>If this come to you on Wednesday, you may perhaps get the enclosure sent off directly. There is no pressing haste in it, nothing peculiar.&#x2014; Jane is gone out, or she would have some word.</p></ps>

<salute>Dearest Eliza</salute>
<p>Your Husband&#x2019;s letter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> written in Influenza found me in the same! I have had it severely and long; and am only now getting out in the heat of the day (if there be any such thing) while my head when it <pb id="pg-09-168" n="09:168"/>does not absolutely ache continues to feel much as if it had been brayed in a morter<supplied>[.]</supplied><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Prov. 27:22.</note> Happily myself and the cat are the only individuals that have been laid up in this house: and as neither it nor I have anything at press, or are acting upon the public in any particular way; &#x201C;the prevailing malady&#x201D; could not have made a more judicious election. Indeed I would rather have the whole to do over again a dozen times myself, than that my Husband should have anything to say to it at present he is so worried with other matters&#x2014; Two printers are on his book at the same time, and the life he leads between them puts me in mind of those unhappy &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">fish fish</hi>&#x201D; in <hi rend="italic">the Arabian Nights</hi> that were always a-frying and required to be &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">at their duty</hi>.&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See &#x201C;The Story of the Fisherman.&#x201D;</note> Besides this, he has a course of lectures on German Literature hanging over him, which it is evident to me he will not have an hour&#x2019;s leisure to prepare&#x2014; And how he is to get thro&#x2019; them successfully without preparation,&#x2014;or what is to become of poor me if he break down in the midst! are questions of no light concern to my forecasting mind. But &#x201C;I hope better things tho&#x2019; <supplied>[I]</supplied> thus speak<supplied>[&#x201D;]</supplied><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-04/lt-18260513-TC-JBW-01"><sic>4:94</sic><corr>TC to JBW, <date when="1826-05-13">13 May 1826</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014; A Lady was suggesting to me the other day that the danger of all dangers for him would be at the very outset, that if he only escaped saying &#x201C;Gentlemen and Ladies&#x201D; instead of &#x201C;Ladies and Gentlemen,&#x201D; the rest would be all plain sailing&#x2014; And he promises that he will certainly say neither the one thing nor the other: so I await what <date when="1837-05-00">May</date> shall bring forth with tolerable composure&#x2014;the more as it is the people who have asked <hi rend="small-caps">him</hi> to speak, rather than he who has asked the people to hear.</p>
<p>When the Book is done with, and the Lectures done with, he proposes going to Scotland, or somewhere, for a long rest&#x2014; But I do not think of accompanying him, having almost a cat-like attachment to my own house, as well as a constitutional incapacity for travelling, to say nothing of the preference I give to London before all other places. It is in fact a jewel of a place; for this reason, that if you want to be solitary you may have your humour out as completely as if you were at Craigenputtoch and if you are socially disposed you may have society to all lengths and of every possible <hi rend="italic">cut</hi> so that it is strange if you do not find something to suit you. For my part I go upon the principle that &#x201C;variety is charming&#x201D;;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Proverbial; cf. William Cobbett, <hi rend="italic">Rural Rides</hi> (London, <date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>) on <date when="1822-11-24">24 Nov. 1822</date>.</note> and as somebody was telling <pb id="pg-09-169" n="09:169"/>me of myself the other day, I have &#x201C;a whole <foreign><hi rend="italic">humanum genus</hi></foreign> (human race) of friends.&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>
<p>In fact if there is any one thing to be learnt more than another, by living in London it is a due Catholicism of taste. One sees so many things which one has been used to consider antagonists and irreconcilable, existing along side of one another in peace and harmony! and still more one learns to <foreign><hi rend="italic">lassen gelten</hi></foreign> [grant value] (ask your Husband&#x2014;happy that you have one who knows German) by the fair appreciation you find from people as different as possible from yourself and from one another. Never has it happened to me to hear in London that phrase which in small towns and even in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> one is constantly hearing; such and such people &#x201C;are not in <hi rend="italic">my</hi> way.&#x201D; People are content here with simply <hi rend="italic">having</hi> ways, without trying to persuade their neighbours that they are the only ones that lead to salvation. They have ascertained, that from the centre to the circumference there are many more radii than one, and they are only moved to astonishment and disapprobation when a fellow creature flies over the circumference into the infinite Inane. But this is unbearable; to philosophize and metaphorize all in a breath! You will agree however that it is not easy to keep oneself &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">a plain human creature</hi>&#x201D;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly coterie speech.</note> in the midst of so much example to the contrary. Positively for weeks together sometimes I do not set eyes on or exchange words with one &#x201C;plain human creature,&#x201D; but only with human creatures more or less ornamented, or&#x2014;perverted. Of all these ornamented human creatures the one I take most delight in is Harriet Martineau! The horrid picture in Fraser with the cat looking over its shoulder was not a bit like,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine</hi>, VII (<date when="1833-11-00">Nov. 1833</date>), 576.</note> and the Artist<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Daniel Maclise under his pseudonym Alfred Croquis.</note> deserved to have been hanged and quartered for so vile a calumny. Neither does the idea generally formed of the woman merely from her reputation as a <hi rend="italic">Political Economist</hi> do her more justice than that picture! They may call her what they please, but &#x2018;it is plain to me and to everybody of common sense&#x2019; (as my Uncle Robert said) that she is distinctly good looking&#x2014;warmhearted even to a pitch of romance, witty as well as wise, very entertaining and entertainable in spite of the deadening and killing appendage of an ear-trumpet, and finally, as &#x2018;our Mother&#x2019; used to finish off a good character &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">very fond</hi> of <hi rend="small-caps">me</hi>.&#x201D; I had a fly at Fanny Kemble (M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Butler) also this winter, but it would not do. She is green-room all over, and with a heart all tossed up into blank verse&#x2014;blank <pb id="pg-09-170" n="09:170"/>verse too of the &#x201C;fish-be it e-er so salt / &#x201C;is ne-er too salt for me,&#x201D;<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Untraced, probably Jane&#x2019;s invention.</note> sort. The longer I live the more I want naturalness in people&#x2014; I think M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Simpson<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly James Simpson (<date when="1781-00-00">1781</date>&#x2013;<date when="1853-00-00">1853</date>), see <ref target="volume-01/lt-18211117-TC-JCE-01"><sic>1:396</sic><corr>TC to JCE, <date when="1821-11-17">17 Nov. 1821</date></corr></ref>.</note> would say I keep &#x201C;my charming naivete&#x201D; to a wonder&#x2014;</p>
<p>I have filled my paper without a word on the subject nearest <hi rend="italic">your</hi> heart<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The death of Eliza&#x2019;s uncle, John Bradfute.</note>&#x2014;and nearest mine while I have been writing. But I do as I would be done by&#x2014; I offer no idle condolences for I never found such of any comfort to myself. And my regard for your Uncle is well enough known to you to make any assurances of sympathy from <hi rend="italic">me</hi> superflous. I hoped to have seen him again&#x2014; It was not to be. He is gone from us all, but the memory of his worth and his kindness will abide w<supplied>[ith]</supplied> some of us while we live.</p>
<p>Perhaps I should have written this to your Husband&#x2014;but it is not lost what a friend gets&#x2014;perhaps too I should have written it more legibly&#x2014;but &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">the weather is cold, and I am grown old</hi>&#x201D;<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Untraced, possibly Jane&#x2019;s coinage.</note> and so I have the paper on my knees in front of the fire which is not a way to make copperplate.</p>

<salute>My dear Mill,</salute>
<p>That sentence you deprecate shall disappear, root and branch, and never return.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A sentence which Mill had objected to in Carlyle&#x2019;s &#x201C;Parliamentary History of the French Revolution,&#x201D; XXVII (<date when="1837-04-00">April 1837</date>), 233&#x2013;47, which Carlyle did not replace when it was republished in his works.</note></p>
<p>On the other hand I must totally dissent from Falconer,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Falconer (see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18361020-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1836-10-20">20 Oct. 1836</date></ref>).</note> and you so far as you go with him, in regard to that of the Jacobins solemnity. It remains lively in my head, as one of the cheerfullest passages I met <pb id="pg-09-171" n="09:171"/>with in the whole H.P.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Histoire Parlementaire de la R&#xE9;volution Fran&#x26;ccedil;aise</hi>, vols. 1&#x2013;23 (Paris, <date when="1833-00-00">1833</date>&#x2013;<date when="1836-00-00">36</date>).</note> It is burlesque; but ought it not to be so? The Jacobins Society and their doings are not sublime to any man in England; to any man in the world, out of a small French clique. Intrinsically, and as it seems to me in final <hi rend="italic">reality</hi>, they are a mixture of truculence audacity and absurdity, not <hi rend="italic">without</hi> something of sublimity at the heart of it; which something, if the English are ever to get at it, <hi rend="italic">this</hi> vehicle, of banter and bluster, may sooner than another be the means of conveying to them.</p>
<p>And now, after this vigorous protest, I leave you King and master of the passage, to do with it as you will.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mill cut the whole passage on the Jacobins from &#x201C;As it is not fit&#x201D; to &#x201C;anything so dramatic as this.&#x201D; Carlyle replaced it when collected (see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XXIX, 15&#x2013;18).</note> Nay farther I have to beg as a special kindness that you will not let me see the thing at all till I read it baatified<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >So written as a joke or error for &#x201C;beatified.&#x201D;</note> into clear print; but that you will yourself correct the Proof; doing it in a kind, brotherly manner; but above all <hi rend="italic">doing</hi> it,&#x2014;my hurry and confusion in these days is so great.</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Yesterday your welcome Letter came; two <hi rend="italic">Diarios</hi> had come before; one of them the preceding week I had sent forward to our Mother, according to arrangement. I spread out my sheet last night with the purpose of answering without loss of a post: but just as I sat <pb id="pg-09-172" n="09:172"/>beginning, <hi rend="italic">rap</hi> there came a Printer&#x2019;s devil, and <hi rend="italic">this</hi> night, after a busy enough day, is the first leisure I have. And this only for an hour and half, as I compute: between nine and ten o&#x2019;clock, there will be a fresh devil. For I have <hi rend="italic">two</hi> Printers at present; who have been <hi rend="italic">bullied</hi> both of them not long since, and are doing their utmost to keep me without rest. Excuse all manner of hurry and the fruits of it, therefore; I have literally hardly time at present to know whether my head is on my shoulders. News for you, as fast as I can shovel them out! Poor Jane is sick again; I am here, alone with my <hi rend="italic">pipe</hi>.</p>
<p>There was word from Annandale last week; a Letter from Jean. All was well there. My Mother had got back to Scotsbrig, after a pretty long stay at Mary&#x2019;s, in waiting for an <hi rend="italic">event</hi> there; which had happily taken place. Mary had got a son, was well again, and our Mother as I say at home. She seemed to have suffered nothing particular from this universal sickness we have had in Britain: I had a Letter from her own hand not long ago, which ran in the same cheerful strain as formerly. Jean had herself had &#x201C;the jaundice&#x201D;; of which she professes to be quite recovered. The special object of her writing was the business of poor John Corrie and that India Bishop.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-08/lt-18360218-TC-JCA-01">TC to JCA, <date when="1836-02-18">18 Feb. 1836</date></ref>.</note> I know not if I mentioned that the benevolent Bishop Corrie did actually send a Letter, nay two Letters for surety-sake, and a remittance of &#xa3;5 in answer to that application of mine: the Letters and remittance came to Clyde<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Rev. James Clyde (see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18360218-TC-JCA-01">TC to JCA, <date when="1836-02-18">18 Feb. 1836</date></ref>).</note> in Dumfries, many months ago; and not the smallest answer was sent; finally they forwarded copies of them to me, which copies were lost by the way; and now at length three days ago I do get sight of the documents, and know what I am to do. It was done soon; the very night the Letter from Jean came. Nothing could exceed the kindly Christian spirit of that good message from Madras: I endeavoured to answer it in a corresponding spirit; at all events, without loss of time. The whole matter, when I think of this good Bishop&#x2019;s promptitude and how fate and want of knowledge had stept in to smite it with impossibility, wears a very <foreign>wae</foreign> aspect to me.&#x2014; A few weeks before, I had received a Letter from Alick. It is written in a mournful temper; and is of a mournful tenor: poor Alick, foiled everywhere in his attempts in this country, sees nothing for it, but &#x201C;taking America in the spring&#x201D;; and wishes me to write to Mr Greig with that view. The message made me sad, as a message could; but I complied with it directly; and wrote back to Alick that I had done so, but that by no possibility could there come an answer before the <pb id="pg-09-173" n="09:173"/><date when="1837-04-00">end of April</date>. I have not since heard a syllable of the business. Jean does not mention it; but indeed she seems to have been much in a hurry. Whether Alick will go this <date when="1837-05-00">May</date> or not I cannot know: the thing lay doleful in my head continually for two weeks; now lazy suggestions that perhaps he may put it off (which how can I <hi rend="italic">wish</hi> him to do?) have come in as a kind of worthless consolation. I sincerely am sorry for the poor Boy; and have no doubt but his real field is America: yet clearly it is a stern problem for him to go. No heart that I have known has keener affections in it; and his Mother&#x2014;and to go forever! It is a hard thing. May God give him and us all the strength to <hi rend="italic">do</hi> whatsoever thing we are called to do!&#x2014; Tom Clow spoke of going with him, he said; and even Clow of Land,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Tom Clow was presumably a brother of Alick&#x2019;s wife, and Clow of Land an older relative; the latter left in <date when="1837-08-00">August</date> with his five sons.</note> tho&#x2019; only as an <hi rend="italic">explorator</hi> he, to <hi rend="italic">see</hi> whether it would do or not. Alick did not seem to have any notion of <hi rend="italic">two</hi> journeys for his own share of it, but to contemplate going off direct. It is a sad thing that no one with a free pen dwells among them. I get the scantiest details, and really ought to be thankful that I get these. By the time I write next we shall know most probably how it is to be for this one year at least.&#x2014; There was nothing else in Annandale except what your dull <hi rend="italic">Herald</hi> will have told you better than I could. I sent it off today with two strokes <hi rend="italic">and a half</hi> on it; the half was to indicate (very obscurely) that your Letter was come and mine coming. James Aitken, Jean says, is still busy with chemistry,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jean had said in her letter of <date when="1837-03-14">14 March</date>: &#x201C;He had also a metal retort that did many strange things such as brewing Phosporous &#x26; producing gasses of all descriptions. Had even it is whispered a lecture ready to deliver at the Mechanicks Institute but lost heart at the sight of the audience.&#x201D;</note> and has got great benefit from the Dictionary you gave him.</p>
<p>It is cheerful news that you have found a conveyance from Paris for papers.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John had written in his letter of <date when="1837-03-07">7 March</date>, &#x201C;I have contrived a way of procuring the &#x2018;Articles&#x2019; and as many of the Proofs as may be ready when this reaches you. If you make a Parcel of them and address: <hi rend="italic">Mons</hi>r <hi rend="italic">G. B. Zangolli N</hi>o <hi rend="italic">5. Place Vend&#xF4;me, Paris</hi>, they will be forwarded immediately to Rome.&#x201D;</note> I went this day to Cavaignac&#x2019;s to speak for an opportunity to Paris: he is the man to find that; they are sending things almost every week. He was not at home; so I shall write to him tonight. If the Parcel go with anything like the speed of the post, I should think including all delays it cannot be ten days behind this in arriving. You shall have the Necklace, Mirabeau, and the whole of the First Volume in what the Printers call <hi rend="italic">perfect-copy</hi> state: pray keep it, and we will <pb id="pg-09-174" n="09:174"/>(if we prosper) bind it up together with the other two which I shall get, as a kind of memorial some day. I will add for you whatsoever Proof-sheets (black <hi rend="italic">they</hi> and blotted) of the Third Volume I can fish out of that closet; where there lies now a barrowful of paper-rubbish,&#x2014;to be all solemnly burnt when we get done. I think there are some five sheets of that 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi> vol. here. Of the 2<hi rend="italic">nd</hi> I have not yet got <hi rend="italic">one;</hi> tho&#x2019; it is 17 days now since the last of Vol 1<hi rend="italic">st</hi> was set up and shewn me! They have been delayed by &#x26;c &#x26;c; and I expect every day that they (that is, the <hi rend="italic">Moyes</hi> people too) will come gushing out on me more rapidly than I can bear. They are very provoking in that way; but good people and artists otherwise. So are my <hi rend="italic">second</hi> Printers, Robsons in St Martin&#x2019;s Lane.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For both printers of <hi rend="italic">The French Revolution</hi>, see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370128-TC-JSM-01">TC to JSM, [<date when="1837-01-28">28 Jan.</date>]</ref>.</note> One must <foreign><hi rend="italic">thole</hi></foreign> [endure], one must <foreign><hi rend="italic">thole</hi></foreign>. I stated in writing to Fraser and them that <hi rend="italic">after</hi> the <date when="1837-04-15">15<hi rend="italic">th</hi> of April</date> for reasons there explained, I would not correct any more, except altogether according to my own convenience, till the <date when="1837-06-01">first of June</date> again: so they were to bestir themselves! The result nevertheless I believe will be that I shall go on correcting and puddling (with what convenience you will see soon); and that the Book will struggle itself out towards the <date when="1837-05-00">end of May</date>. It is terribly troublesome; the references, above all. One sits up to the neck among rubbish of books and clippings; searching and searching. Moreover, it is growing far longer than I expected: the first vol. is 404 pages. I was afraid the two others would be much larger: but I think by management the third vol at least will not differ by many pages from that: if the second prove a little longer, it can best bear it, so far as look goes. The third vol. is the best. But on the whole I think the whole thing is not <hi rend="italic">naught</hi>, and I have it there as a thing <hi rend="italic">done</hi> by me. It will stand a great deal of <hi rend="italic">beating;</hi> the critics are welcome to lay on; there is a kind of <foreign><hi rend="italic">orson</hi></foreign> [wild]<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-06/lt-18311220-TC-JAC-01"><sic>6:72</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1831-12-20">20 Dec. 1831</date></corr></ref>.</note> life in it which they will not kill. Of course we were too late for being reviewed in Mill this time; a thing I bear with extreme philosophy. Mill&#x2019;s Review, I suppose, is just coming out: he is printing that <hi rend="italic">Histoire Parlementaire</hi> Article: I was treated again with a pleading, of extreme <hi rend="italic">maiserie</hi>, in the name of Falconer the Editor&#x2019;s-Cloak and of Mill the Editor, about some citation concerning the Jacobins Society, &#x201C;to be left out or to be kept in.&#x201D; I begged Mill, as a favour, to correct the whole thing with his own hand and never let me see it again till printed; which he is doing. I esteem his judgement in these things worth almost nothing. But he <pb id="pg-09-175" n="09:175"/>is very modest with it in my case; that also &#x201C;it is but fair to state.&#x201D;<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Francis Jeffrey&#x2019;s oft-repeated phrase in reviewing,&#x201D; according to A.

See also <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370217-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1837-02-17">17 Feb.</date></ref>, for the reception of &#x201C;Mirabeau.&#x201D;</note> the Bookseller would wish much to have a Book of that sort from me.&#x201D;&#x2014; Speaking of reviews I must add one word about an American Review of Teufelsdrockh<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >N. L. Frothingham&#x2019;s review (see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370213-TC-RWE-01">TC to RWE, <date when="1837-02-13">13 Feb.</date></ref>).</note> which I saw lately. It pleased me very much, tho&#x2019; it would have been very vain to believe it all. It <hi rend="italic">was</hi> here and there a kind of idealized image of me however, and had more true perception and appreciation than all the other critiques laudations and vituperations I had seen of myself. It is called <hi rend="italic">Christian Examiner</hi> (I think), and Miss Martineau says, has great vogue in Yankeeland, their best Review. I bought a copy, and sent it to my Mother: it was 3/, very dear. I will not treat you to one, but let you wait. Jamie Aitken expressly commissions one for himself: that is six shillings out of the family; more than the gear is worth.</p>
<p>But, alas, my dear Jack I go wandering about the bush; loth to tell thee the grand news of all: that I <hi rend="italic">am</hi> to lecture on G<hi rend="italic">n</hi> Liter<hi rend="italic">e</hi>, in <date when="1837-05-00">May</date> next! <foreign><hi rend="italic">Ach Gott!</hi></foreign> It makes my heart tremble when I think of it; but it is to be done. Royal Instit<hi rend="italic">n</hi> having failed, the Wilsons (it was Miss Wilson mainly) determined that we could get an audience of our own, and a Willis&#x2019;s Room of our own. So they have Tickets printed, and a &#x201C;Book&#x201D; open at Saunders and Ottley&#x2019;s,<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Saunders &#x26; Otley, public library and publishers, 50 Conduit St.</note> and the Marchioness of Landsdowne and honourable women have their names down, and Prospectuses circulate;&#x2014;and, on the whole, on Monday the <date when="1837-05-01">1st of May</date> from 3 to 4 O&#x2019;clock, and five lectures after that, two each week, I am to commence and speak! Heaven only knows what I shall say. There will not, with these dilatory Printers, be a single moment devotable rightly to preparation: I feel as if I were to be flung over board, and bid swim or drown. You will think of me that day, and wish me thro&#x2019; when the hour comes.&#x2014; On the whole however it is best. I have long wished to try that thing, and now it can be tried. Nay I am sure farther that I can succeed in it with a fair chance. Courage! swim or drown!&#x2014;&#x2014; My health is not to call bad, considering how others go: it is the frightfullest <hi rend="italic">East</hi> weather; smoke and bitter frost; today and yesterday we are all white with snow. I shall be refitted a little, before <date when="1837-05-00">May</date>. The thing that afflicts me most is as ever <pb id="pg-09-176" n="09:176"/>the <hi rend="italic">chilifactory<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A coinage from &#x201C;olfactory&#x201D; and &#x201C;chilly.&#x201D;</note> apparatus</hi>,&#x2014;sorrow on it! <hi rend="italic">Prolapsus;</hi> speck in eye, &#x26;c &#x26;c: only rest will cure me; which by God&#x2019;s blessing I shall have.&#x2014; Poor Jane is far worse than I: in great misery all this day. Her <hi rend="italic">third</hi> attack of cold or influenza cough; with headache, with face-ache: but now I hope, the snow having softened, she will get out of it soon again. It is a sad element in our lot that of health.</p>
<p>As to Summer arrangements, you see how it is with us. It would answer like a very tally if you were to be here in <date when="1837-06-00">June</date>, and bolt with me for Scotland! In <date when="1837-09-00">September</date> itself we shall be right glad of you, and I hope we too shall see Annandale together again. As for Switzerland,<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John had said that Lady Clare had not decided &#x201C;whether to spend the summer at Albano, 15 miles from Rome, or in Switzerland, but I think most probably the latter will be our destination. &#x2026; In that case we must see whether there is not any possibility of your paying me a visit.&#x201D;</note> I can make no program about it at present; my whole soul cries, Rest, Rest. We shall see better by the time <hi rend="italic">you</hi> are all settled what you are to do. The <hi rend="italic">Plate</hi> then will come down when I begin lecturing.<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John had said, &#x201C;I have also agreed to go back to Lady Clare on the <date when="1837-05-01">1<hi rend="italic">st</hi> of May</date>, that is to take down my &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">plate</hi>&#x2019; and retire from this my present establishment.&#x201D;</note> Pack it up, keeping the mood you are in; as a Knight hangs up his shield for future battle. This year we are in will possibly settle something as to me. I seem as if I were going to make what a servant of ours called &#x201C;an <hi rend="italic">explosure</hi> in the Kent Road, Ma&#x2019;am.&#x201D; I am driven not to care two straws whether or not. Fortune has had me <foreign>aux abois</foreign> [at bay] for a good while, and I have looked defiance in the teeth of her. The longer I live &#x201C;fame&#x201D; seems to me a more wretched <foreign><hi rend="italic">Kimmera;</hi></foreign> really and truly a thing to be shied if it came: I think of Rousseau&#x2019;s case sometimes; and pray God I might be enabled to break whinstones rather or cut peats, and maintain an <hi rend="italic">un</hi>fevered heart. God keep us all, I pray again, from the madness of Popularity! I never knew one it did not <hi rend="italic">injure;</hi> I have known strong men whom it killed.&#x2014; The Printer&#x2019;s devil <hi rend="italic">is</hi> here since the bottom of the page. <closer><salute>God bless thee my dear Brother; and good-night in thy far chamber!

<p>Wednesday 4 o&#x2019;clock afternoon.&#x2014; My dear Brother, here have I sat this whole day working at that first sheet of the <hi rend="italic">Feast of Pikes</hi> (blessings on it!) and have just got it done. I correct in the <hi rend="italic">Ms</hi> too; but there is always something to correct.&#x2014; Expect no margins, therefore. Jane continues in great suffering; had a bad night: I believe it to be bile, and have got her to take something. She is in a languid <pb id="pg-09-177" n="09:177"/>state today; more tolerable than yesterday&#x2019;s violent headache. I would to Heaven for both our sakes, she were well again.&#x2014; I will go and call for your money; I think I can recollect the Banker&#x2019;s name, Stone and Martin. I will dispose of it as you direct.

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Will you accept of the shortest Note I almost ever wrote to you; a longer at this time not being in my power.</p>
<p>The Printers are chacing me night and day; having now after <pb id="pg-09-178" n="09:178"/>long idling begun heartily to work. I toil from sun to sun keeping ahead of them: at this rate in some four weeks, <hi rend="italic">we are like to be done</hi>. Done! O what a blessing. Then I <hi rend="italic">am</hi> to lecture: actually and bodily to make my appearance, and begin lecturing on the <date when="1837-05-01">first of May</date>! They have got Tickets printed, Prospectuses printed; and are gathering an audience of Marchionesses, Ambassadors, ah me! and what not: all is going on like a house on fire; and I in the interim cannot get a moment bestowed on the business for these Printer people. At the day appointed nevertheless I must make my appearance! The comfort is that I know something about the subject; and have a tongue in my head. One way or other, doubtless I shall come thro&#x2019;.</p>
<p>But the thing that drives all this, and every other thing for the present out of my head, is the state my poor Wifie is in. She has taken this Influenza for the <hi rend="italic">third</hi> time. I really begin to be seriously uneasy for her. She has lain these six days, in great distress; with very little sometimes with no sleep; coughing considerably: and her strength, with so much suffering this last year and indeed these last five years, is sore worn. My poor Goody! We have got a Doctor; a skilful sort of man, I think; the Sterlings&#x2019;s Doctor:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Morrah, surgeon, 62 Sloane St.</note> he looks grave about it; says that at present there is no alarm, but that we must <hi rend="italic">take care</hi>. You can fancy me sitting up to the neck among books and papers; and hearing the sore cough on the other side of the wall!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Carlyle&#x2019;s study in those days was the room on the first floor, afterwards the drawing-room, and Mrs. Carlyle, being ill, was now occupying the bedroom immediately in rear of it&#x201D; (A. Carlyle&#x2019;s note).</note> I pray daily and hourly that the bitter north wind would become south and gentle. I believe it would set her up again for this time. It must come surely. I have sent for Mrs Welsh today; or rather I have told her to be getting ready, and in any case to lay her account with coming speedily to us. Anne is as willing and kindly as creature could be: but we are bad nurses she and I. Mrs Welsh will probably come very soon.&#x2014; It is a great blessing that my own health stands out so well. I feel the nasty east wind too in the fretted state I am in; but still keep on my legs, and feel as if I needed nothing but <hi rend="italic">rest</hi> to make me even better than I used to be. This is the state we are in; and I am, as it were, stealing the time it takes to tell you about it. Courage, Courage! In four weeks I shall at least have one weighty stone rolled off me: the good weather will be come and my poor Jane better a little.</p>
<p>Jack&#x2019;s Letter, you will see, sends us tolerable enough news from <pb id="pg-09-179" n="09:179"/>him. He is to take down his &#x201C;Plate&#x201D; again; we may probably hope to see him in the course of the warm weather yet. I have answered his Letter; and am to send off the printed sheets of Volume first tomorrow (I hope) by an opportunity I have got to Paris.</p>
<p>There came a long Letter from Jean not many days ago. It was mostly about poor John Corrie; and told me only in general that nothing very essential was wrong with any of you. The Bishop&#x2019;s two Letters affected me much; I answered him the very night Jean&#x2019;s Letter came. Will you tell her and James this; and that they must write to me again without waiting answer, my present confusion and hurry are so great.&#x2014; Often, in this [a line or two are missing] with<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >From this point to the end of the manuscript (MS: NLS, 511.44) is badly torn.</note> [line missing] which I am very thankful for<supplied>[.]</supplied> O dear Mother take care <supplied>[of yourself; a]</supplied>void sunset and sunrise in these bitter days. Clothe in flannel [fragment missing] and let us hope for summer.</p>
<p>Nobody says a word to me about Alick. What is becoming of his project, poor fellow? Many a time my thought flies towards him, inquiring. I can only send him my prayers, my heart&#x2019;s-wishes; no counsel have I except one, to call on God to help him, and to do manfully what God&#x2019;s hand seems to beckon. Let us all keep up our hearts. Better days, Better days! I never cease to say so, <hi rend="italic">are</hi> coming.</p>
<p>Whether I have forgotten anything essential I know not, but I must end now. Till Jane get round, they must all be content with <hi rend="italic">one</hi> stroke on their Newspapers. I trust and hope the <hi rend="italic">two</hi> will come back again soon.</p>
<p>Jack&#x2019;s money I have <supplied>[never]</supplied> been to seek yet. It is five miles off, and cuts up a day. I will wa<supplied>[it]</supplied> [fragment missing] only if there be anything for you to do in it. Farewell for this day my dear Mother! May God be with you and in you, one and all.</p>

<salute>My dear Sister,</salute>
<p>I must write you a word, tho&#x2019; it be one of the briefest. You have heard often how little time I have, how I am whipt from post to <pb id="pg-09-180" n="09:180"/>pillar; yet you probably form no idea of it that is not beneath the reality.</p>
<p>Your long Letter came duly; was thankfully read: I wrote to the Bishop the night it came. Those two Letters of his to poor Corrie were of a very excellent nature, and affected me not a little. That Bishop, I think, must be an honest and good man.</p>
<p>Since that date, I have written a Letter to our Mother, which perhaps you have seen; explaining the sad increase of trouble to us by Jane&#x2019;s sickness. For a week, I was in great alarm about her. She is out of danger for the present; but still confined to bed, and likely to be weak for an indefinite time. I wrote to Mrs Welsh about the same time, perhaps on the very same day: Mrs Welsh made no dallying; but put herself into the mail next afternoon; and <hi rend="italic">arrived here about six o&#x2019;clock on Saturday morning</hi>.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1837-04-01">1 April</date>.</note> &#x201C;Very <hi rend="italic">cauld</hi>,&#x201D; Anne Cook said, coming to awaken me and apprise me; but otherwise little worse for the expedition. She is much usefuller here than she could be elsewhere; and must stay till poor Jane get a great deal stronger. There has been nothing but one fit of illness after another, this long while; three attacks of Influenza, extending over some twelve weeks; headaches, coughing, and all wrong together. We must do the best we can; and wait, and hope.</p>
<p>My weary printing cannot last very long now. It is a wretched slavery. But the third volume is half printed; the first wholly; the second almost half: about the <date when="1837-05-00">beginning of May</date>, the Book must be fairly away from me. It was not with joy that I ended it, but with a kind of <foreign><hi rend="italic">wae</hi></foreign> thankfulness, thankfulness that it had not first ended <hi rend="italic">me</hi>. I am sore worn; but not in ill health, or otherwise hurt; nay rather I am considerably benefitted perhaps in many ways. I need only rest. I am still resolute for Scotland in summer; but there lies yet somewhat between me and that. On the <date when="1837-05-01">first day of May</date> I am to begin Lecturing! I cannot get a moment bestowed on preparing for it: I have a kind of feeling that I shall plunge thro it, one way or another. But after that, I <hi rend="italic">will</hi> rest a while, or it shall go hard with me.</p>
<p>The special reason of my writing tonight is touching certain money of John&#x2019;s. Last Saturday I transmitted a Hundred and Twenty pounds to his name in the Commercial Bank, payable to my Mother; you must therefore get her warning as soon as possible; and let her come up and transact this piece of business as she did the former more than once. I suppose there will be news of the sum at Dumfries <pb id="pg-09-181" n="09:181"/>by the time you get this; but it will lie till called for; only not at interest. You of course will <hi rend="italic">lose</hi> no time. Let James, when it is all <hi rend="italic">right</hi>, send the Newspaper with <hi rend="italic">one</hi> stroke; and I will take that as a token till you be able to write.</p>
<p>I was glad you had got all the bits of Pamphlets, and had found some pleasure in them. There is a Copy of that American Review announced long since as being on the road for myself; whenever it comes to hand, James shall have it as a present, and right welcome.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James had offered to reimburse Carlyle (JCA to TC, <date when="1837-03-14">14 March</date>).</note> I guess however that my Mother&#x2019;s will put you off very handsomely in the mean time. There is a considerable stir making and likely to be made about poor me in these days; but I declare truly it is a thing that rather sickens and grieves me than does me any good at all. &#x201C;What&#x2019;s ta use on&#x2019;t?&#x201D; as Sandy Corrie said.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-07/lt-18341224-TC-WG-01"><sic>7:349&#x2013;50</sic><corr>TC to WG, <date when="1834-12-24">24 Dec. 1834</date></corr></ref>.</note> What <hi rend="italic">is</hi> the use on&#x2019;t? It is a dozen years and more since in my misery I once said to myself, when somebody had been angering me by ill-natured speech about my sickness: &#x201C;Suppose all London were to rise at six in the morning, and do nothing else but <foreign><hi rend="italic">greet</hi></foreign> [weep] for thee the livelong day, would it <hi rend="italic">take away this pain?</hi> Would it bring peace into this heart? Not a bit of it! Let London go its gates [its own way] then; let all the world go its gates; go thou thine!&#x201D; I fancy a dike-back [back of a wall] in a su<supplied>[nn]</supplied>y day, in Annandale, and to be <hi rend="italic">well let alone</hi> there, were worth <supplied>[the su]</supplied>m-total of it.</p>
<p>You do not say anything about Brother Alick nor America; who is often in my thoughts of late. Has he given up the enterprise for this year? Or how does it stand; or what is he doing? How getting on at all? I wish you would explain to me next time clearly how the matter stands: you give me often more light about such things than I can get otherwise. I wish much Alick would write himself; but I suppose he is loth to do it, being perhaps in an uncertain state as to his own plans, and little inclined to speak about what he has not yet done with thinking of, and struggling with to <hi rend="italic">make</hi> it speakable.</p>
<p>It gives me great satisfaction indeed to hear of James&#x2019;s welfare and well-doing. What I can see of his studies, is that his <hi rend="italic">handwriting</hi> improves immensely; and that he is a man of strict punctuality; both of which are decided qualifications, the <hi rend="italic">latter</hi> above all. May he go on and prosper; may it be well with him and you!&#x2014; The <hi rend="italic">younger</hi> James it seems is a stirring fellow; which also is right at his time of life.&#x2014;&#x2014; I will write &#x201C;no more of <hi rend="italic">nought</hi>&#x201D; this night, my dear Jean; <pb id="pg-09-182" n="09:182"/>being quite tired out; and fittest for bed of all things. <closer><salute>Your affectionate Brother,</salute></closer></p>

In not many weeks, I hope, you will have a copy of the Book itself.&#x2014; Jane did not sleep so well last night: however, she goes on gathering strength, and now the wind seems turning more into the West which is a great point for us.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Here after rather more delay than I expected, comes off the Printed stuff you bargained for. The first Volume perfect; all but the last sheet, of which I have been obliged after long soliciting to go this day and take a half-corrected revise, ugly but readable: this and all the other horrid blotches of Proofsheets which I have been able to rummage out of this closet. The whole flanked by your Copies of <hi rend="italic">Mirabeau</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Necklace</hi>. I send it to Cavaignac <foreign><hi rend="italic">tel quel</hi></foreign> [just as it is]. I have missed one opportunity to Paris, waiting on that miserable Printer Moyes; and I will not miss another. It seems to me very doubtful whether after all, either it or this will ever get fairly into your hands: however I will do my part in it, and hope better things tho&#x2019; I thus speak.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; cf. <ref target="volume-04/lt-18260516-TC-JAC-01"><sic>4:94</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1826-05-16">16 May 1826</date></corr></ref>.</note> Send me a <hi rend="italic">Diario</hi> with <hi rend="italic">three</hi> strokes, if you do get it.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-09-183" n="09:183"/>This time four weeks, I must <hi rend="italic">have</hi> delivered my first Lecture. I sit quaking when the thought of it comes into my head; but quite unable to help myself, being kept in such a state of confusion and Press-correcting. We shall see what will become of it. A man usually does get thro&#x2019; one way or other.</p>
<p>Poor Jane since I wrote has been very ill. She was sick as I told you the day I wrote; a <hi rend="italic">third</hi> attack of that Influenza. But she grew ever worse; we were obliged to call in a Doctor (one Morrah from Sloane Street, the Sterlings&#x2019;s Doctor, a skilful-looking little elderly man); he looked rather grave over the business, did not like the cough; and I, reflecting on the tear and wear of the last five years, began to get really alarmed, and dejected: however, after five nights there did come a little sleep; and all began gradually to get better. Mrs Welsh to whom I had written did not send an answer, but came herself literally by return of Post; and has been here since Saturday morning. With the summer before us, it is to be expected that we shall still do well. Jane hitherto does not stir out of bed; but the cough is almost gone; the strength returning; all in a hopeful way. A hopeful way, alas, only for this once! The system of life is evidently much shaken with her; and she will require to be careful, and to have more care taken of her.</p>
<p>I got your money, and sent off a hundred and twenty pounds of it to Dumfries as directed. This day I wrote to Jean and Mother announcing that I had done so. There have no news come since I addressed you last; except the usual silent indications that all is <foreign>in <hi rend="italic">statu quo</hi></foreign>. With so little confidence of ever getting to actual audience of you, this scribble will not prolong itself. I am weary, and disgusted, with these sheets and with most things.

<salute>My dear Mill,</salute>
<p>The whole of the First Volume of the F. R. has now been in type for two or three days; I have got some ten sheets of it perfect; and shall get the remaining four or five in the course of the week. These with three or at most four of the <hi rend="italic">Third</hi> Volume (by the other Printer) are all I yet have. A Proofsheet or two of the <hi rend="italic">Feast of Pikes</hi> (Vol II) may also perhaps be attainable in the course of the week; but <hi rend="italic">perhaps</hi> only. That is where we are.</p>
<p>I suppose therefore it will now be necessary for you to decide on <hi rend="italic">not</hi> reviewing the Book for this Number.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mill reviewed it in the <date when="1837-07-00">July</date> issue of the <hi rend="italic">London and Westminster Review.</hi></note> If you decide <hi rend="italic">otherwise</hi>, let me know; and I will forthwith set about doing the needful.</p>
<p>It has been decided, in spite of Mr Singer&#x2019;s ill success,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Samuel Weller Singer (see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370128-TC-JSM-01">TC to JSM, [<date when="1837-01-28">28 Jan.</date>]</ref>).</note> that I am still to lecture! In Willis&#x2019;s Rooms; to begin with <date when="1837-05-00">May</date>! six Lectures; on my own footing. God only knows how I shall get thro&#x2019; it, in the hurry I am in; in the health I am in. But I must try; I have long had a thought of trying. I am on the whole got beyond fear, of anything. So soon as these Syllabuses or Prospectuses they are printing come into my hand, I will send you one or two of them.</p>
<p>In spite of my atrabiliar humours, I like the Book considerably better as it goes on in the printed state. It is not wholly a worthless Book; neither can it be wholly ignored forever. There will be men in England that will say <hi rend="italic">Yes</hi> here and there; and innumerably men and quasi-men that will most unmusically <hi rend="italic">shriek</hi>, and endeavour to say, <hi rend="italic">No, No.</hi> As I told my Brother once, when he remonstrated with me: &#x201C;Jack, there are some ten millions of men in this Island, who generation after generation spend their lives in <hi rend="italic">supporting</hi> Conventionalities and Quackeries of one sort or the other,&#x2014;why should there not once be one man who spent his life (were it his <hi rend="italic">life</hi> even) in declaring openly to whatsoever quackhood he met, Behold thou art a quackhood!&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x2014; Such a Book is <hi rend="italic">awful:</hi> it is itself like a kind of French Revolution,&#x2014;in its way!</p>

<p>Herewith I send you ten Prospectuses of that amazing Course of Lectures of mine.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Froude, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi>, III, 98&#x2013;99, for a list of the lectures which Froude appears to have copied direct from the prospectus as it does not include the unscheduled seventh lecture (see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370519-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1837-05-19">19 May</date></ref>).</note> One will suffice for yourself; but according as you have opportunity, you may leave the other nine with such persons as you think them likely to concern. How the others, for they have 500 of them, are getting distributed I do not very specially know:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. James Spedding&#x2019;s letter of <date when="1837-04-04">4 April</date> to Richard Monckton Milnes which enclosed a prospectus and asked Milnes to return to London early to help extend the list of subscribers: &#x201C;You are just the man to make it grow. As it is Carlyle&#x2019;s first essay in this kind, it is important that there should be a respectable muster of hearers. &#x2026; Learning, taste, and nobility are represented by Hallam, Rogers, and Lord Lansdowne. H. Taylor has provided a large proportion of family, wit, and beauty, and I have assisted them to a little Apostlehood. We want your name to represent the great body of Tories, Roman Catholics, High Churchmen, metaphysicians, poets, and Savage Landor&#x201D; (T. Wemyss Reid, <hi rend="italic">Life, Letters, and Friendships of Richard Monckton Milnes, First Lord Houghton</hi> [London, <date when="1890-00-00">1890</date>], I, 192).</note> but your section of the world, I think, must be nearly unvisited by them. If you can make use of more than ten, I suppose I can easily get you more. It is Miss Wilson and her Brother whom you once saw here; they, with Taylor chiefly, that are setting afoot this thing: one of the conditions of it is that I am not to hear a word of the business till the people are all met, we suppose three score or so, in Willis&#x2019;s Rooms.</p>
<p>I tremble to the very bone to think of it. For the Lectures are to be Speeches, that is one of the conditions; farther I have not, with Printers&#x2019; devils and <foreign><hi rend="italic">etceteras</hi></foreign>, a single moment to study them: you can fancy! But it is a thing I have long wanted to try; nay a thing internally that under certain conditions I have a considerable notion I could do. So, sick and jaded and exasperated and hurried; in this and not in another state of readiness, what can I do but try. It is like a man taken by neck and heels and flung over board, and bid swim or drown. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Ora pro me</hi></foreign> [Pray for me]!</p>
<p>The first day I have an hour&#x2019;s leisure I must be eastward in your region; and hope to make a clutch at the India House.</p>

<salute>My dear Jack,</salute>
<p>You must be content with a very hasty Letter from me today; and glad that you can get even that, as I am that I can give it you. Your Letter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dated <date when="1837-04-03">3 April</date>.</note> has been here six days: it turned out that I <hi rend="italic">might</hi> have found an hour that day (the Printers being all engaged with liquor); but I could not take advantage of it; could only fidget about, <hi rend="italic">waiting</hi> for work, and this is my first leisure since. Also I ought to add that my head seems to be all gone to dry wreck, and oblivious inanity. Such as I have give I unto thee.</p>
<p>We get always favourable news from Rome; which is a thing we cannot be too thankful for. Our other cares lie nearer, and can be more promptly inquired into, when they go awry. I could like however that you had as little as might be to do farther with men whom &#x201C;the Jesuits are in quest of,&#x201D; and who sleep with pistols under their pillow! Happy that you got this one sent on his travels without damage.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John had written: &#x201C;Last week I had a troublesome and rather dangerous mad patient who kept his other medical attendant and myself in more agitation than I had ever previously been engaged in or connected with in Rome. His madness took the turn of suspecting the Roman Govern<hi rend="italic">t</hi>, the Inquisition and especially the Jesuits of having organised a deep conspiracy against him &#x26; paid assassins to waylay &#x26; shoot or stab him. &#x2026; he took it into his head to procure a dagger &#x26; four pistols, and constantly slept with the dagger &#x26; one pair of pistols beneath his pillow, and carried the other in his pocket constantly loaded during the day. &#x2026; He called on the Governor on thursday evening to speak about the conspiracies, and then set out for Albano with his pistols &#x26; dagger. &#x2026; we followed him to Albano in the afternoon [Friday], got his arms from him by fair means, persuaded him to come with us to Rome, and when he wanted to get out had soldiers surround the carriage and threaten to lead him immediately to prison if he did not put himself under the guidance of the English Clergyman (who had gone with us &#x26; agreed to go to Florence) and leave the Papal states; and at half past two on saturday morning, he drove peaceably away from Rome with the clergyman &#x26; two servants &#x26; was taken to Florence without stopping.&#x201D;</note> I suppose &#x201C;the Plate&#x201D; to be coming or come down by this time; accordingly I directed the last Newspaper to you at Lady Clare&#x2019;s, as I shall do this Letter. The Newspaper was the <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi> not the <hi rend="italic">Herald</hi>, as your order bore: the <hi rend="italic">Herald</hi> does indeed excel most things in vociferous unreason and genuine <foreign><hi rend="italic">bona-fide</hi></foreign> stupidity;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John had said he preferred the <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi> as &#x201C;less dull and stupid&#x201D; than the <hi rend="italic">Herald</hi>.</note> I shall <pb id="pg-09-187" n="09:187"/>direct James Aitken to <hi rend="italic">un</hi>order it at the end of the current quarter; in the mean time, he may send it down to Alick first in order, for in truth it is rare here that I read many lines of it.&#x2014; It was not so agreeable to hear that there was fainter chance of seeing you this summer; indeed no chance for the summer, and only a certain degree of chance for the Autumn. But who can say you did wrong? God knows there is little here to come to: Commercial crash coming on, spreading wider and wider; the Paupers of Manchester <hi rend="italic">helping themselves</hi> out of shops, great bands of them parading with signals of want of bread!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Up to 4,000 handloom weavers had been thrown out of work in Manchester and the surrounding districts in the previous month. On <date when="1837-04-17">17 April</date> a meeting had been held on St. George&#x2019;s Field from which a march to the town centre was led by &#x201C;a man bearing a pole, to which were affixed two loaves&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Globe,</hi> <date when="1837-04-20">20 April</date>). Bakers&#x2019; shops were raided and bread demanded; a second meeting on <date when="1837-04-18">18 April</date> sent a deputation to the police office asking for relief. A meeting of the authorities on <date when="1837-04-20">20 April</date> recommended that parish officers be &#x201C;universally liberal&#x201D; to the deserving men (<hi rend="italic">Times,</hi> <date when="1837-04-22">22 April</date>). Troops were on standby during the week. The depression had begun in <date when="1836-00-00">1836</date> and exposed one of the flaws in the Poor Law Amendment Act: when large numbers were suddenly thrown out of work in industrial centres outdoor relief had to be granted because the workhouses were not big enough to house all the needy.</note> On the one hand, Miss Martineau and Secretary Chadwick celebrating their New Poor Law Bill as the miracle of recent Legislation;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Harriet Martineau had published four tales, <hi rend="italic">Poor Laws and Paupers illustrated</hi> (London, <date when="1833-00-00">1833</date>&#x2013;<date when="1834-00-00">34</date>) and could be identified with the new act and Edwin Chadwick in her role as a populariser of the political economy of Bentham and Malthus. She had become friendly with Chadwick when he was a member of the Poor Law Commission, <date when="1833-00-00">1833</date>, and her tales may have been partly based on information gained from discussions with him on &#x201C;the way in which country justices aggravated pauperism under the old law&#x201D;; with hindsight she did recognise &#x201C;that [Chadwick&#x2019;s] mind was an isolated one; and that his faculty <supplied>[was]</supplied> narrow and engrossed with detail&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Autobiography</hi> [London, <date when="1877-00-00">1877</date>], I, 409&#x2013;10).

Often enough I could long to be in sunny Italy, far away from such sights and sounds. We will wait patiently with closed lips and open eyes what the time will bring. If <date when="1837-09-00">September</date> bring us Jack, it will be well.</p>
<p>The best news for the present is that I have as good as done with printing. Yesterday only! Nay there are still some <hi rend="italic">Revises</hi> of the Second Volume to deal with; but they are a light matter: all the rest stands hard and fast in type.<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Harriet Martineau remarked in her <hi rend="italic">Autobiography:</hi> &#x201C;The sight of his proofs had more than once really alarmed me,&#x2014;so irresolute, as well as fastidious, did he seem to be as to the expression of his plainest thoughts. Almost every other word was altered; and revise followed upon revise&#x201D; (I, 385).</note> I have had such a time of it as man seldom had: but, God be thanked, it is <hi rend="italic">done</hi>. The Book will likely <hi rend="italic">succeed</hi> a little, I think. But &#x201C;Deevil may care&#x201D; whether it succeed, or <hi rend="italic">de</hi>ceed down even to <hi rend="italic">him</hi>; I being now fairly rid of it, after an honest duty done to it. Drunken Printers are about as bad an element as any; but they too are now over.&#x2014; The first Packet of Proofsheets, directed to Zangolli Place&#x2014;Vend&#xF4;me, went off about a fortnight ago. It had been detained till after Cavaignac&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">first</hi> opportunity passed by; owing to drunken Printers. I was at last obliged to take measure independent of their drunkenness. The thing contained D. Necklace, Mirabeau, two Pamphlets of Maurice&#x2019;s (for Bunsen<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370403-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1837-04-03">3 April</date></ref>. Bunsen and Maurice met in Switzerland in <date when="1840-00-00">1840</date> and, already knowing each other by repute, became warm personal friends; both were vigorous champions of liberal Christianity.</note> from me, worthless <hi rend="italic">for</hi> me); vol I. of F.R. and a bundle of black Proofsheets containing fractions of vol II and vol III: this I think was all. I should like much to know whether it has reached you. I think I shall venture, were the perfect-sheets and title-pages once in my hand, to send you off the other two volumes without waiting for answer from you? Shall I? You could then have the Book bound for yourself at Albano.<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A resort 15 miles SE of Rome where Lady Clare had decided to go for the summer until <date when="1837-09-00">September</date>, Jack having renewed his engagement until then.</note> It would amuse you a little in your summer solitude. I <hi rend="italic">will</hi>. If the <pb id="pg-09-189" n="09:189"/>Packet never reach you, or prove too dear when it reaches so that you have to refuse it, never mind. Probably in some week or so from this date it will be ready &#x201C;to wait for an opportunity.&#x201D; Cavaignac has some two or three, he says, every month. Enough about the Book!</p>
<p>On the <date when="1837-05-08">eighth after this</date> I am to make my appearance as a Lecturer ! Heaven alone knows how that is to be got thro&#x2019;. I have literally not yet had a moment&#x2019;s time to think about it. There is a partially free week for me now; and I must make use of that. The audience I suppose will be tolerably fair as to numbers, and certainly miscellaneous enough: do but take these three, Godefroi Cavaignac, the Marchioness of Landsdowne, and Henry Brougham Lord Brougham and Vaux! Some way or other we shall &#x201C;welter thro&#x2019; it&#x201D;; then, in four weeks hence, there will be a burden rolled off my shoulders; and I shall bound forth free.&#x2014; By the bye I continue to find Cavaignac a most truehearted well-gifted, natural genuine wild man and Frenchman; on the whole, one of the best Brother men I fall in with here. He comes about once in the ten days; a wild proud man; who takes considerably to me. Were I happier I could love him considerably. His Mother is here; half-distracted still by grief for her daughter:<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Caroline Cavaignac, who had died about <date when="1836-10-00">Oct. 1836</date>.</note> I have seen her twice; weeping, weeping, <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;Ah, <foreign>monsieur, c&#x2019;est un mauvais esprit qui r&#xE9;git ce monde</foreign></hi> [&#x201C;Ah, sir, it is an evil spirit who rules this world&#x201D;]! It is in all senses miserable to look upon. Of Mill I see very little; he does not come here, I do not go there: his talk is not edifying to me; dry husky formulas and nothing else <foreign><hi rend="italic">unerquicklich wie das Nebelwind</hi></foreign> [unrefreshing as the misty wind]. He would gladly, I believe, <hi rend="italic">do</hi> for me whatsoever he could; but he can nothing. The whole Radical fraternity, in fact, grow<supplied>[s]</supplied> insupportable to me. I have not seen even Buller these six months; and hardly ever tried except when a frank was not easily had elsewhere. They will go their way, thou goest thine. At Henry Taylor&#x2019;s one morning, I saw Sir Francis Head. It was a kind of reward of virtue. I had refused about four invitations from Taylor, who is always very good to me; this fifth I was, with an effort, minded to accept. But I awoke at five that morning; could not and would not wait till <hi rend="italic">ten</hi> for breakfast, were the King expecting me. Coffee, therefore, coffee O thou greasy but ever-ready <foreign><hi rend="italic">Pluister</hi></foreign> [muddler] of an Anne Cook! Coffee was no sooner swallowed and shaving over than I felt in great heart; and slowly dressing myself, slowly wending thro&#x2019; the windy Hyde Park, I did actually appear at Taylor&#x2019;s, and cunningly managed to enact <pb id="pg-09-190" n="09:190"/>eating breakfast, to perfect satisfaction, without eating any; and saw this Head and others, and had much pleasantly polite talk. Head is the <hi rend="italic">Br&#xfc;nnens of Nassau</hi> man, of whom you may have heard: a Navy Captain; about my own age or younger; a fine strong-built, blondelocked bluff, effectual Saxon-figure, of the right Bull character, in shag frock and trowsers; clear, fresh, full of laughter shrewdness, pepticity, heart and health. He seemed <hi rend="italic">rather</hi> to consider me as of too pungent a genus, genus oil-of-vitriol or so; but I saw well <hi rend="italic">he</hi> was of good Old-Christian Buckinghamshire fat; and liked him well.<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle had confused two different men. Sir Francis Bond Head (<date when="1793-00-00">1793</date>&#x2013;<date when="1875-00-00">1875</date>), who had served with the Royal Engineers, <date when="1811-00-00">1811</date>&#x2013;<date when="1825-00-00">25</date>, including Waterloo, and was not a naval captain as Carlyle thought. An assistant poor law commissioner in <date when="1834-00-00">1834</date>, he was now an unpopular and incompetent lieutenant-governor of Upper Canada, <date when="1835-11-00">Nov. 1835</date> to <date when="1838-00-00">early 1838</date>. He was the author of <hi rend="italic">Bubbles from the Brunnens of Nassau. By an old man</hi> (London, <date when="1834-00-00">1834</date>). Henry Taylor&#x2019;s friend was Edmund Walker Head (<date when="1805-00-00">1805</date>&#x2013;<date when="1868-00-00">68</date>), fellow of Merton College, <date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>&#x2013;<date when="1837-00-00">37</date>, friend of George Cornewall Lewis; also an assistant poor law commissioner, <date when="1836-00-00">1836</date>, he inherited a baronetcy, <date when="1838-00-00">1838</date>, became governor of New Brunswick, <date when="1847-00-00">1847</date>, and governor-general of Canada, <date when="1854-00-00">1854</date>&#x2013;<date when="1861-00-00">61</date>. For Henry Taylor&#x2019;s description of him see Taylor&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Autobiography</hi> (London, <date when="1885-00-00">1885</date>), I, 311&#x2013;12. Both men were from Kent and were distantly related; Carlyle obviously thought he was meeting Sir Francis Head who was in Canada, but was in fact meeting Edmund Head on a visit from Hereford where he had returned by <date when="1837-04-27">27 April</date>. For a discussion of the rumor, which Roebuck at least believed, that Lord Glenelg had intended to appoint Edmund Head as lieutenant-governor in <date when="1835-00-00">1835</date> but, like Carlyle, had confused him with Francis Head; see D. G. G. Kerr, <hi rend="italic">Sir Edmund Head</hi> (Toronto, <date when="1954-00-00">1954</date>) pp. 21&#x2013;22.</note></p>
<p>No more gossip; but swift, to needful news! Jane grew worse and worse after I wrote to you; for about a week she gave me a terrible fright. Coughing, coughing, weak as a sparrow; and no sleep to be had. We sent for a Doctor; the Sterlings&#x2019;s Doctor, one Morrah of Sloane Street, a &#x201C;Surgeon &#x26;c,&#x201D; of fifty, an Ulster Irishman I think: he proved really helpful; administered some mixture that h<supplied>[ad tur]</supplied>pentine in it; above all, sedulously inculcated good warm temperature, avoidances and observances, saved us &#x201C;if not from the disease yet from the bad Doctor.&#x201D; I had written to Mrs Welsh: literally by return of Post she was <hi rend="italic">here,</hi> one Saturday morning about six. The poor Goody was considered to be out of danger then, tho&#x2019; still very weak. She has been <hi rend="italic">nursed</hi> ever since; about a week ago she came out of her room first; she has now been twice out of doors, tho&#x2019; with caution, as the weather improves: we consider this <hi rend="italic">third</hi> fit of Influenza therefore to be past also. Morrah, I saw, dreaded consumption; the sound of the cough pleased him ill. He declared however, on ceasing his visits, which he did with great discretion when the time came for it, <pb id="pg-09-191" n="09:191"/>that there was nothing organic gone wrong; that it was the whole system weak irritable, and requiring to be gently dealt with. If you fancy us in the middle of all this; with Printers Devils knocking, knocking; I myself sick&#x2014;! But it is gone now. Mrs Welsh continues here without specific arrangement of times for the present; I surely am to fly the hot weather, probably almost surely to Scotland: the rest remains hanging.&#x2014; Anne Cook, it seems has been detected, pilfering, &#x201C;extensively cheating&#x201D; with shopkeepers: poor slut! Jane knows of another woman; one &#x201C;Eliza&#x201D; whom we already had; of great faculty in her calling, but of discontented temper.<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350800-JWC-JCA-01">JWC to JCA, [<date when="1835-08-00">mid-Aug, 1835</date>]</ref>.</note> Cook is really a terrible puddle, <hi rend="italic">without</hi> morality I think at all, except <hi rend="italic">good nerves</hi>.</p>
<p>I got your &#xa3;140 from Stone &#x26; Martin, and sent &#xa3;120 of it on to Dumfries as formerly: James Aitken testified by a signal agreed on that it had been properly received and bestowed. I kept the &#xa3;20 till we settle, lest I might run down. However, since that, Mill has sent me &#xa3;14 for the <hi rend="italic">Histoire Parlamentaire</hi> Article, and I am in funds sufficiently. Fraser too owes me for the D. Necklace; he shall pay up, were the Book fairly out.&#x2014; The very day your Letter came who should appear here but Ben Nelson, on his way towards Heidelberg! He is off this morning, I suppose, by way of Rotterdam: poor Edward is fallen sick (Influenza &#x26;c, tho&#x2019; now decidedly recovering), and sends for his Father to bring him home. Ben is grown <hi rend="italic">white,</hi> but looked brisk otherwise. An appointment in India has been got for Edward: he will probably be going off thither in few months; say about the time <hi rend="italic">you</hi> get back with Lady Clare. I got no news from Ben; being indeed driven like a swift-booming <hi rend="italic">sling</hi> all the time he was here. They are to return this way.&#x2014; Ben brought a Letter from Alick. He seems determined still for America, tho&#x2019; I think they rather throw impediments or discouragement in his way. He cannot be ready till after Whitsunday, nor can John of Cockermouth, who also is bent on going. Your Letter will do good in this business. I am to send it off this day to Alick, with a word of my own; the last word I mean to write till the Lectures are done. It is very true what you say; there is no use in regarding it as an <hi rend="italic">eternal separation,</hi> in a world so changeful as ours. Alick seems not to have <hi rend="italic">lost</hi> much money; but says, he shall gain nothing by this years trade either (bacon-trade), and will make haste to get his money out of it. It seems to me as if America would make him a new man. There is wonderful shift and energy enough in the little fellow; but he has been terribly browbeaten, <pb id="pg-09-192" n="09:192"/>terribly provoked; and whisky as a ready refuge-of-lies is so near. I cannot wish him to stay; I cannot bid him go. Clow of Land he says is also still set for going. Mary and Jamie Austin should go, he thinks; but Mary is greatly against it. She were a great loss to our Mother if she went.&#x2014; But now I must write to <hi rend="italic">them,</hi> O Jack, and leave thee. Send answer as prompt as last time. <closer><salute>Be well and busy, good Brother! Thine Ever affectionately&#x2014;</salute></closer><name>T. Carlyle</name></p>
<ps><p>For anything I know there may be a Foreign Post today too, Sunday tho&#x2019; it be. At any rate I will to Charing Cross with this. It may be open till I go. Margins, if time be.</p>
<p>5 O&#x2019;clock&#x2014; No time for margins, dear Jack. There have been a series of interruptions, Willis, Anthony Sterling &#x26;c; and on the whole at this hour I have not got Alick&#x2019;s Letter finished, nor any walk taken; so I must out, especially as the weather from rainy seems about to become dry. Willis gave us no news; he is recovered from a bad fit of sickness; is canvassing, he says, for some office or title of Physician to a &#x201C;Royal Hospital of Children&#x201D; somewhere.<note n="15" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably the Royal Infirmary for Children, Waterloo Bridge Rd., founded <date when="1816-00-00">1816</date>.</note> He seems to be doing well. He thought of you that you could not in any way be making a better introduction of yourself to London than by practising in Rome. Did you ever hear of a <hi rend="italic">Jock Forsyth</hi> from Ecclefechan? A card came to me the other week thro&#x2019; Fraser, with Jock&#x2019;s name on it, and appended thereto &#x201C;Surgeon and Accoucheur&#x201D; at Kingsland (somewhere in the uttermost East, I believe!<supplied>[)]</supplied> I have made no answer to it yet; nor shall till I be freer, <hi rend="italic">if then:</hi> he was much of a scamp.<note n="16" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not further identified.

<p>Poor Andrew Carruthers, Alick writes me, is dead of Influenza at Ecclefechan.<note n="17" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not further identified.</note> Poor Andrew!&#x2014; The disorder seems to be much abated now; we have after the coldest Spring within man&#x2019;s memory got some appearance of a promise of better.</p>

<salute>My dear Alick,</salute>
<p>Ben brought your Letter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1837-04-12">12 April</date>.</note> on Tuesday or Monday last; and right welcome it was after so long a silence. The inclosed from Jack had come not many hours before. I was in such haste as I had long been in at the time; but had at last the sure prospect of getting that over. I now enclose you Jack&#x2019;s Letter, to whom I have already written this day; and will send you a few words along with it. The Printing, after an <hi rend="italic">awful struggle</hi> really, with bullying of drunken Printers, with scraping and <foreign><hi rend="italic">scraffling</hi></foreign> and <hi rend="italic">doing</hi> what was in one, is over, or as good as over, yesterday! The Book is all in type, my share of it finished, except some slight hour or two of work, which I shall be ready for when it is ready for me. I suppose it will be out as a Book, in not many days. You shall have a Copy of it by the earliest chance after that; and good appetite I shall wish you with it. It is I think the most radical Book that has been written in these late centuries; &#x201C;cares not a rush for General Sharpe more than for any other man&#x201D;;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Obviously said by someone in the family during the days when the family lived at Mainhill about their landlord, General Matthew Sharpe (see <ref target="volume-01/lt-18210324-TC-AC-01"><sic>1:346</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1821-03-24">24 March 1821</date></corr></ref>, and cf. <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences,</hi> intro. I. Campbell, p. 32).</note> and will give pleasure and displeasure, one may expect, to almost all classes of persons. Let it take its fate: the great indisputable blessing is that I have done with it forever and a day.</p>
<p>Jack&#x2019;s Letter, as you will find, treats a little about the American speculation. On the whole I think what he says about it is very rational.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In his letter of <date when="1837-04-03">3 April</date> John had written: &#x201C;I should be quite clear for him going alone at first and looking at the country without taking any previous resolution about coming back or not. His wife and children could follow him if desirable with others that would be going, and he could see about him much more freely &#x26; cheaply if alone. &#x2026; People begin to think nothing of the passage now-a-days. There are Americans here who talk of going to New York &#x26; Philadelphia this summer and returning to spend next winter in Rome. &#x2026; It gives me much pain to think how &#x2026; he is losing the flower of his life in hopeless experiments where nothing is to be done. &#x2026; Tell him not to think of that parting forever which is a thing not to be borne, and ought not to be supposed in a world of such changeableness and uncertainty as this. Who knows but we may all go to America? &#x2026; It is only the rich and idle that are ill-off there.&#x201D;</note> There is no reason why we should regard such a thing as a <pb id="pg-09-194" n="09:194"/>perpetual separation; none at all: nay it rather seems to me as if in reality more of us would have to see America yet; as if the more of us that wended thither it were the better. This Country of England seems to me clearly enough to have a destiny before it of unknown degrees of blackness. There is a curse of God written upon the arrangements men live by in it. The fruitful land denies the toiling man food from it: <hi rend="italic">that,</hi> I make bold to assert in the face of all man, is a thing that neither can nor ought to continue. And quackery and dishonesty is in high places and in low: the voice of the quack speaks loud and louder. Let us in God&#x2019;s name leave it to <hi rend="italic">him;</hi> let us <hi rend="italic">go out of it,</hi> and fasten somewhere, were it at the Earth&#x2019;s end, on not a quackery but a <hi rend="italic">truth</hi>. In America there is this great truth which the all-nourishing Earth tells a man: &#x201C;Till me, and thou shalt have sustenance from me.&#x201D;&#x2014; On the whole, therefore, my dear Brother I bid you be of courage, of good heart and hope, and do cheerfully and quietly what you find admonished and guided to do.</p>
<p>That your trade this year has yielded you little or nothing is not surprising to me. Nay farther, I could like very well to know that you had got your money fairly out of it again, the sooner the better, without <hi rend="italic">loss</hi>. There is one of the things they call &#x201C;commercial crisis&#x201D; coming on, or rather come on: one does not know to what width it may reach, or what wretchedness in all ranks it may occasion. Get your ware made money therefore I would say, with all speed; but indeed that I suppose is a thing you are at any rate doing.</p>
<p>As to the payment or surety you speak of, or as to anything whatever in that strain, I beg you will speak of it no more at all.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In his letter of <date when="1837-04-12">12 April</date> Alick had said: &#x201C;I owe you something above two hundred pounds; and I supose after winding up the pork trade and paying that just amount, there would perhaps remain but little for so long a journey. Now I think of paying you the half and transferring to you my right to the houses in Eccl<hi rend="italic">n</hi> as a sort of surety [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] for the other.&#x2014; A poor surety in truth, but still the only one I can give.&#x201D; Alick had signed an IOU to Thomas for &#x201C;the sum of Two Hundred and Forty Pounds&#x201D; on <date when="1833-01-03">3 Jan. 1833</date> (MS: NLS, Acc. 2712).</note> It is distressing to me to hear of it. The whole sum you had from me would be consumed rapidly; I not benefited, left how poor, poor! Nay the truth is, I have less need of money far than has been long usual with me. I rather think I am at last going to get into the way of gaining a little money here: it really does seem possible; the rather perhaps as I have got into the way, of late, of regarding either that or the reverse of that with an equanimity unusual formerly. Many a time I have silently said within myself since I came here, &#x201C;Well then, O World, or Devil, <hi rend="italic">reduce</hi> me to a diet of potatoes, to any diet, or even to no <pb id="pg-09-195" n="09:195"/>diet at all, do it, I bid thee, do it; I will beat <hi rend="italic">thee</hi> after all: it is not to thee that I will yield.&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x2014; But to quit all this speculating I wrote to John Greig that I thought you would perhaps have &#xa3;300 or so to start with. A little money might save one great difficulties at starting. Jack has cash he is not using; nay who knows but I too may have a little cash: one way or other, poor Dillick<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alick&#x2019;s nickname.</note> shall and must be fitted out, if there be strength in us all to do it. As to the time of setting out, or as to Jack&#x2019;s plan which he is always insisting on that you should go by yourself first and <hi rend="italic">look,</hi> I cannot give any kind of advice. It must be regulated by many considerations, a greater part of which is of course before your own mind than before any other man&#x2019;s. Grahame&#x2019;s advice about John Greig&#x2019;s being fond of selling his own land dear<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alick had written that Graham had told him that Greig &#x201C;was every way a most worthy and deserving individual&#x2014;lived in a pleasant part of the country but sold his land <hi rend="italic">dear</hi>.&#x201D;</note> is a thing we can keep in mind; but need not, I fancy, pay any great regard to. I believe Greig to be a very honest and honourable kind of man, and of great practical good sense; and farther that he will be very glad to do you a service; for my sake were it for nothing else; indeed I understand I am grown a kind of one-and-somewhat in Yankee-land now, and Greig will reckon it ornamental to him rather than otherwise that he has a Brother of mine to advise and further. At all events we can listen to what he says, you can listen, but are not bound to believe more than your own eyes will verify. Nothing can be finally decided on I suppose till we hear from him. The instant his Letter comes I will send it you. Before very long it ought to be here: there is a Letter from him that somebody was shewing me other day; dated <hi rend="italic">New York</hi> where he seems to be at present: but doubtless he communicates with his Cana<supplied>[n]</supplied>daigua Letters; and there is little chance that my Letter to him should not arrive without delay, or that he should not answer it without delay. We will leave it lying in this state for the present.&#x2014;</p>
<p>Your news about my Mother were right welcome news.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alick had said: &#x201C;Our <hi rend="italic">good</hi> Mother is come to Mary&#x2019;s last night on her way to Dumfries, and continues in her normal health, having stood the wretched season uncommonly well.&#x201D;</note> I suppose she was on her way to Dumfries about Jack&#x2019;s money (&#xa3;120): I got a token on James Aitken&#x2019;s Newspaper that the thing was rightly settled; at least so I interpreted. It is a great blessing indeed, that our Mother has been so well this winter, while so many, whom one would have thought stronger, have suffered. You will tell her of this Letter from <pb id="pg-09-196" n="09:196"/>me by the first convenience, and give her Jack&#x2019;s too. Say farther that I will write to herself so soon as this Lecture <foreign>hurlyburly</foreign> is over; and will predict more accurately if I can what I myself am then to do.&#x2014; Jane continues to go on very fairly: she has got out of doors some twice when there happened to be any sun, which does not often happen; she is very <foreign>feckless</foreign> but has no cough or other distinct ailment, and may hope much from the warm weather. Mrs Welsh nurses her, and takes charge of household matters: how they two are going to arrange their summer is not yet fixed. Best wishes come to you all from them. Jane many a time says, &#x201C;Alick has ten times the stuff in him of a common man; it is miserable to see such a one held down, hindered, and driven desperate as he is: he will burst out from it, and get free field for himself over the sea.&#x201D; A year or two of tough manful struggling, and that verily is possible! Courage, my Boy: there is land in this old Earth yet for the free Plougher to till. Jenny shall make me tea yet out of some American clear stream. We are under God&#x2019;s blue Sky whithersoever we go: the brave heart the cunning hand and clear head are in all places at home.&#x2014;</p>
<p>My Lectures begin on the <date when="1837-05-01">first of May</date>; the Monday after you read this! How I am to do in it is still a mystery; but I have a kind of fre<supplied>[e]</supplied> week before me and will apply myself to consider. There will surely be the strangest set of people there that ever I talked to. The other night somebody told me of Brougham coming! I contemplate the withered <hi rend="italic">kippered</hi> countenance of that Ex-Chancellor twitching and jerking there on me (as its wont is) with a strange mixture of a shudder and a laugh on my part. It is like swimming; one must <hi rend="italic">dash in,</hi> strike out his limbs from him; then one does swim. Nay, as Goethe says, it is so with all that man undertakes in this world.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-04/lt-18260927-TC-JBW-01"><sic>4:138</sic><corr>TC to JBW, <date when="1826-09-27">27 Sept. 1826</date></corr></ref>.</note> <supplied>[N]</supplied>ext Letter to my brother will say, I hope, that <hi rend="italic">some</hi> way <supplied>[or]</supplied> other better or worse, it is got finished.</p>
<p>I was sorry to hear of poor Andrew Carruthers&#x2019;s death: I re<supplied>[mem]</supplied>ber he met you and me on Annan street last time I came from London; we shall now never more meet on Earth.&#x2014; A week or two ago, there came a card to me thro&#x2019; Fraser the Bookseller containing the address of, whom think you? <hi rend="italic">Jock Forsyth!</hi> H<supplied>[e n]</supplied>ow calls himself &#x201C;Surgeon and Man-midwife,&#x201D; and lives far away in the East her<supplied>[e ab]</supplied>out seven <supplied>[mi]</supplied>les from <supplied>[us]</supplied>. I shall perhaps someti<supplied>[me when thi]</supplied>ther in my travels go and take a look at the man, if it be suitable: I have no doubt he is still a <hi rend="italic">drunken scamp,</hi> or nearly so, as he <pb id="pg-09-197" n="09:197"/>formerly was.&#x2014; Jack now demands to have the <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi> Newspaper instead of the <hi rend="italic">Herald,</hi> which latter he finds too stupid. Stupid enough it is. Will you therefore tell James Aitken to <hi rend="italic">discontinue</hi> it at the end of the nearest term. Till such term he may if you like send it on direct to you at Annan instead of your <hi rend="italic">Courier:</hi> you having read it can forward it hither. I have not read three paragraphs of it for the last six weeks. I will also send forward the old <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> to you, as regularly as Hunt gives it me, which is not very regularly.</p>
<p>This I think my dear Brother is the substance of what I can get said at present. I will write again, <hi rend="italic">when</hi> I said; and then surely at more leisure. My affection to one and all; name by name. Good be with you ever!&#x2014; I send as usual a printed leaf one of the last: the next sending one may hope will be the Book itself.&#x2014; <closer><salute>Ever, dear Alick, Your faithful Brother</salute></closer></p>

<p>I have this moment got the last <hi rend="italic">Revise</hi> of that unblessed Book off my hands; and reckon myself to have now done with it forever more. The Bookseller has orders to send you the first copy he can get bound. I suppose you will get it at the India House one of these days.

The outcome of that is one of the chief mysteries of Fate in these weeks.</p>
<p>Your Books will revisit their shelves, so soon as I can find an hour to pack them. The Carrier I suppose must take them by instalments. It seems as if one horse could hardly draw them all, much less one box hold them. We shall see.</p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Yesterday Jean&#x2019;s Letter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dated <date when="1837-04-24">24 April</date>.</note> came to hand, with the good news in it that you were all struggling forward in the old way. A thing I was right glad to learn in that specified manner. I had received, some fortnight before, a Letter from Alick thro&#x2019; Ben Nelson: Alick saw you at Annan on your way to your present quarters. I wrote to Alick last week; or rather it was <hi rend="italic">this</hi> week, and the Letter is probably lying still at the Annan Post-Office. As you are so <foreign><hi rend="italic">black-baised</hi></foreign> [very concerned] about me, I determine to send off a small word today to relieve you; till Alick come or send. Alick&#x2019;s Letter contained a Letter from Jack too, with nothing but good news in it; here likewise all is going right enough: therefore, dear Mother, let your <foreign><hi rend="italic">black-baisement</hi></foreign> become a <hi rend="italic">white-baisement</hi> [optimism] with the smallest possible delay!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Although Mrs. Carlyle had sent a message in Alick&#x2019;s letter of <date when="1837-04-12">12 April</date> that &#x201C;she had no <hi rend="italic">grain</hi> of fear about your lecturing&#x201D; Jean now wrote that &#x201C;she says she is very anxious about you altogether first how Mrs Carlyle is and next how you are holding out yourself she is <foreign><hi rend="italic">black baised</hi></foreign> for you and the lectures she gives a long sigh when ever they are mentioned.&#x201D; &#x201C;White-baisement&#x201D; is a nonce word of Carlyle&#x2019;s.</note></p>
<p>The printing is entirely done; I suppose the Book will be out before many days: however, I have washed my hands of it; and try as much as possible to forget that there is such a thing in existence. The very first opportunity I have, you need not doubt I will send you off Copies of the wonderful performance; that you may read it in peace, and have done with all this clatter about it. They will come, most probably by steam to Edinburgh these Dumfriesshire Copies; after which I will direct them to be forwarded by Coach to James <pb id="pg-09-199" n="09:199"/>Aitken: so that there will not probably be much delay, after the publication here; the date of <hi rend="italic">which,</hi> however, I do not know yet.</p>
<p>Jane continues to go on very well; and gathers strength apace now that the wind has got itself round into the West. She goes out when the sun shines; taking care to keep on the sunny side of the pavement, and not to go far: in the evenings, sometimes she will walk as far as Battersea Bridge,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The bridge built in the 18th century was itself replaced by an iron suspension bridge.</note> and to and fro upon it for a little while. It is very cheerful there, in these fine evenings, for the Bridge has only iron railing, being itself a Bridge of wood; and commands a free sunshiny prospect far and wide: the broad River gushing down or up according as the tide is, with barges and painted pleasure-craft, the green woody regions about Richmond on the one hand, stirring Chelsea with shops and wheel-vehicles enough and the great whirlpool of London (like an Ocean of confused steeples and <foreign>reek</foreign>) rising up on the other. Our advantage in the West wind is that all the <foreign><hi rend="italic">reek</hi></foreign> is blown <hi rend="italic">from</hi> us, not to us. Mrs Welsh rather complains of late days; but it seems nothing of moment. We hope the good weather will set everybody up again and everything.</p>
<p>Jack as you will see when Alick presents himself is not to quit Italy; not at least before <date when="1837-09-00">September</date>. He seems still to have a hankering after Rome, and will perhaps try it another winter.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John had said in his letter of <date when="1837-04-03">3 April</date>: &#x201C;I may be induced to try my fortune another winter in Rome more especially if Cholera and Quarantines leave the roads clear and open so as to allow a sufficient number of English to come.&#x201D;</note> Perhaps it is as good a thing as he can do in present circumstances. He has down his <hi rend="italic">Brass-Plate,</hi> I suppose, by this time; and is living quietly again in Lady Clare&#x2019;s. Nobody need regret much that he is not in <hi rend="italic">this</hi> Country at present. It is one of the most straitened, difficult ill-situated Countries anybody ever lived in, as times go. They will improve it by and by; but it will be long first; and a terrible job to do!</p>
<p>As for me and my health, it is really all well enough with me. I lie quite quiet; and have the greatest appetite in the world to <hi rend="italic">do nothing at all</hi>. On Monday at three o&#x2019;clock comes my first Lecture; but I mean to take it as coolly as possible: it is neither death nor men&#x2019;s lives whether I speak well or speak ill, or even decline to speak at all, and do nothing but <hi rend="italic">gasp</hi>. One of my friends was inquiring about it lately. I told him, some days I could speak abundantly, and cared nothing about it; at other times I felt as i<supplied>[f when]</supplied> the Monday came, the natural speech for me would be this: &#x201C;Good <pb id="pg-09-200" n="09:200"/>Christia<supplied>[n folk]</supplied> it has become entirely impossible for me to talk to you about German or any Literature or terrestial thing; one request only I have to make, that you would be kind enough to cover me under a tub for the next six weeks; and to go your ways all with my blessing!&#x201D; This were a <hi rend="italic">result</hi> well worth remarking. But it is not likely to be <hi rend="italic">this</hi>.&#x2014; We are very much astonished where Anne Cook got her ideas about the Lectures. &#x201C;Two thousand tickets&#x201D; would really be a pretty thing; the <hi rend="italic">twentieth</hi> part of that will satisfy us tolerably.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jean had said: &#x201C;Mark Ann&#x2019;s account of this lecture business. She writes to some cousin in Annan Rob Brown tells me &#x2018;Our Maister has been treat by some of the greatest men in a&#x2019; Lunnin to deliver a course of lectures the tickets are a guinea each &#x26; they have disposed of two hundred some read it two thousand!!!&#x2019;&#x201D;</note>&#x2014; On the whole, dear Mother, fear nothing! I will send you word about Lecture-business too &#x201C;that I have got thro&#x2019; it.&#x201D;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jean had said: &#x201C;We all hope and trust you will be born thro&#x2019; with an &#x2018;honourable throughbearing.&#x2019;&#x201D;</note> One great blessing is that <hi rend="italic">in three weeks</hi> it <hi rend="italic">must</hi> be done one way or another. It will be over <hi rend="italic">then,</hi> and all well.</p>
 <p>Jane who is sitting by me, sends her affectionate regards and thanks to you and Jean and the rest. She says she will write to you by and by on her own footing; but is for the present <foreign><hi rend="italic">black-baised</hi></foreign> like yourself!&#x2014; You must very specially thank Jean for me; till I get leisure to thank her myself. Tell James to <hi rend="italic">discontinue</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Herald</hi> Newspaper at the first term there is. Such is Jack&#x2019;s order, who finds it inexpressibly <hi rend="italic">dull,</hi> as I do. The <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi> is to go to Rome instead. James, if Alick and he agree to it, can send the Herald first to Annan, and let Alick forward it. It is worth almost nothing, I think, to any man or woman.&#x2014; Today I am to go and <hi rend="italic">look</hi> at that Room, which is to be my Lecture-room. The hour I had appointed is just here (11 in the morning); so I must off. Good be with you all! I think I shall get a frank for this: you cannot get it before Monday at any rate. <closer><salute>Dear Mother ever yours, /</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name></p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I observe your Printers have again in the Magazine, and also in that yellow Announcement, put Bast<hi rend="italic">ile</hi> in place of Bast<hi rend="italic">ille</hi>.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The advertisement on the reverse of the title page of <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine,</hi> XV (<date when="1837-05-00">May, 1837</date>) read in part: &#x201C;vol. I.&#x2014; The Bastile.&#x2014;&#x201D;</note> Pray, when you advertise, take care to correct them in this mistake. It is one which all English Printers are prone to commit; and yet is an ominous kind of mistake; Bast<hi rend="italic">ile</hi> being literally no word at all; and only Bastille being tolerable to people that know anything of French.</p>
<p>I have got everything safe and sound out of the hands of the Robsons. It is my part to say of them that they are accurate punctual Printers, and have been extremely helpful to me in this business.

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I return you kind thanks for your kind Letter to me. I was much surprised to see your face listening there that day. Had I guessed beforehand that such a thing would bring you down from Kilburn at such an hour, surely you had not needed to <hi rend="italic">pay</hi> for coming, as now you unfortunately have. &#x201C;Dogs should not bite dogs,&#x201D; the Proverb says. If I ever lecture again in your neighbourhood, you shall have free ingress if no other have. Pray continue to hear me patiently: I really will try to do a little better.</p>
<p>Here is a copy of a thing I wrote not long since,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably &#x201C;Mirabeau&#x201D; or &#x201C;The Diamond Necklace,&#x201D; some copies of which had been set aside.</note> which perhaps you have not seen. I do not bind you to read it, much less to speak of it or write of it; but I do to receive it as a testimony of my true regard for you. Courage, Courage! Let us hold on as men and German Saxons ought. It is written, and is infallible: &#x201C;In due time ye shall reap if ye faint not.&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf.

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>When you quitted us last night with my astonishing &#x201C;worthy old friend,&#x201D; I knew not whether to begin crying or begin swearing, or what to do: but I finished, at least this morning I do finish with heartily laughing.</p>
<p>Who could have thought I was inviting you yesterday to meet a new Scioppius<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Latinized form of Kaspar Schoppe (<date when="1576-00-00">1576</date>&#x2013;<date when="1649-00-00">1649</date>), German classical scholar and controversialist, attacking Joseph Justus Scaliger, James VI and I, and others.</note> or Julius Caesar Nelson Scaliger<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Julius Caesar Scaliger (<date when="1484-00-00">1484</date>&#x2013;<date when="1558-00-00">1558</date>), scientist, classical scholar, famous for the virulence of his attack on Erasmus in two orations, <date when="1531-00-00">1531</date> and <date when="1536-00-00">1536</date>.</note> in the person of my astonishing friend with his three circulating Library Books, and his three thoughts which he thought he was thinking! My amazement was great. The instantaneously polemical side our Annan Scioppius turned up was the thing I was least of all prepared for. In fact I have seen little of him, and nothing at all of that, these three and twenty years; and had rashly supposed the thing was altogether extinct: that it could awaken in this instance was not more to be expected than one of those miracles of which Attile Schmelzle says &#x201C;there are examples in the history of the middle ages.&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Carlyle&#x2019;s translation &#x201C;Army-Chaplain Schmelzle&#x2019;s Journey to Fla&#xEB;tz,&#x201D; by Jean Paul Richter, <hi rend="italic">Works,</hi> XXII, 140.</note> But in truth the business brings back to me a very ugly side of Scotch existence, which in my solitude among the mountains I had lost sight of. God grant us all some more suitable <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;Moral Coolture,&#x201D;</hi> and &#x201C;restr<hi rend="italic">aient</hi>&#x201D; fit for guiding us in this life! And O heaven how the soft sheet lightning began playing about this rhinoceros, and the thick hide tho&#x2019; a non-conductor felt strangely <pb id="pg-09-205" n="09:205"/>tickled by it! I think there are few scenes in Ben Johnson [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] equal to such a combination. Absurder figure made by a man of some sense I do not remember to have observed. Nothing remains for my astonishing friend (a man of worth at bottom too) but to walk out with a pound of butter on his head, and bless heaven.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See also <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370530-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1837-05-30">30 May</date></ref>.</note></p>
<p>But you, I pray you in pity come over to me again without delay, this night if you can, and let us laugh together; and reduce the absurdity into the region of the absurd.</p>
<p>Since I began writing your messenger has come. I am for the <hi rend="italic">Guide</hi><note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hunt contributed &#x201C;Leigh Hunt&#x2019;s Sunday Lecture&#x201D; as a regular column and other unsigned work to the <hi rend="italic">Guide</hi>.</note> and a contemplative pipe of tobacco down-stairs. <closer><salute>Good be with you my dear friend; and many thanks.</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My Dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I fancy you will be glad to hear a word from me today; and so tho&#x2019; I have time but for a word (and seem to have got a very bad pen to boot), I will despatch you what I can. By various Newspapers that we have sent you would see how the Lectures were going on;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Times,</hi> <date when="1837-05-02">2 May</date>, by Edward Sterling, and the <hi rend="italic">Spectator,</hi> <date when="1837-05-06">6 May</date>, by John Crawfurd, had reported the first lecture and the <hi rend="italic">Times,</hi> <date when="1837-05-09">9 May</date>, the second lecture. The <hi rend="italic">Spectator</hi> report is reprinted in Shepherd&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi>, I, 169&#x2013;75.</note> very tolerably indeed to the surprise and satisfaction of parties interested. I found myself in an awful flurry at first; but gradually recovered; and can go on now with comparative comfort.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The first <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> review, <date when="1837-05-02">2 May</date>, said: &#x201C;The lecturer, who seems new to the mere technicalities of public speaking, exhibited proofs before he had done of many of its higher and nobler attributes, gathering self-possession as he proceeded.&#x201D; Harriet Martineau wrote later: &#x201C;Whenever I went, my pleasure was a good deal spoiled by his unconcealable nervousness. Yellow as a guinea, with downcast eyes, broken speech at the beginning. &#x2026; From the time that his course was announced till it was finished, he scarcely slept, and he grew more dyspeptic and nervous every day; and we were at length entreated to say no more about his lecturing, as no fame and no money &#x2026; could counterbalance the misery which the engagement caused him&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Autobiography</hi> [London, <date when="1877-00-00">1877</date>], I, 383.)</note> The audience seems to be between two and three hundred; a set of the discreetest, <pb id="pg-09-206" n="09:206"/>most attentive best-bred people I ever saw. It is very curious to hear the wild Annandale voice speaking down upon these high-cultivated dignitaries and marchionesses; and how patient and silent they sit under it. I have given them a variety of deliverances, upon Luther &#x26;c &#x26;c, which I was by no means sure they would receive so well. On the whole there is is [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] great reason to be thankful that we have got on so handsomely hitherto: reason above all to be thankful that one has got so near <hi rend="italic">done</hi> with it. I delivered my fifth Lecture yesterday; and had, by the bargain, only one more to give: however, the people seemed so anxious about it, I determined to give them another; and so, on Monday next and also on Friday, I have to make my appearance again; and <hi rend="italic">then</hi> it <hi rend="italic">is</hi> over and I am a free man!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle&#x2019;s lectures had begun on <date when="1837-05-01">Monday, 1 May</date>, and ended <date when="1837-05-26">Friday, 26 May</date>. This letter makes it clear that there were seven of them rather than six as stated in the prospectus, Froude, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle,</hi> III, 98&#x2013;99, and as usually assumed. The seventh lecture was on Goethe.</note> I will write to you before long after that; so soon as anything is settled about my motions. For the present, I think the best thing I can set about then will be <hi rend="italic">to dig the Garden</hi> here, which is lying very waste, and will offer a good steady job to calm me down again.&#x2014; You need not be <foreign><hi rend="italic">black-baised</hi></foreign> then, my dear Mother, about this thing; but take heart and be thankful with me that it all goes very well.</p>
<p>The Book too is fairly out some ten days ago, and I have sent away the few copies I had to give, and have cleared the house of all borrowed French Books, Mill&#x2019;s and others; and feel at last wholly delivered from the unspeakable burden I carried so long. What the Critics say of the work I take no pains to know, or rather would take pains not to know. It is enough for me that I have done my part in it; they can now do theirs, the best way they can. I rather conjecture that all the small fry of critics (a set of the despicablest mortals living) will be afflicted at the thing; and the better kind of critics on the whole pleased: which is exactly as it ought to be. Mill tells me he is busy at a Review of me even now; he calls himself much contented; and is no insufficient judge, especially on this subject which he has studied to great lengths. I calculated on not getting a penny or a pen<supplied>[ny]</supplied>worth in any way by the business; so I wait &#x201C;with unspeakable compos<supplied>[ure]</supplied>&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-04/lt-18271120-TC-ADBM-01"><sic>4:282</sic><corr>TC to ADBM, <date when="1827-11-20">20 Nov. 1827</date></corr></ref>.</note> which way it may go; safe am I at any rate.</p>
<p>It is above a week since I sent off your copies for James Aitken at Dumfries. They were ordered to be sent by Coach from Edinburgh. It is possible they may come very soon, or may have already come. <pb id="pg-09-207" n="09:207"/>James can indicate by a <hi rend="italic">single</hi> stroke on the Newspaper <supplied>[wh]</supplied>en he gets them safe. To write a Letter would be better; but that takes time; and I suppose all is especially busy at this season. But above all let no one <hi rend="italic">write</hi> on the Newspaper: it is a dangerous thing, and not altogether a just one. Yesterday no farther gone there came a Newspaper again all <hi rend="italic">splatched</hi> with Post-office seals &#x26;c, and charged 16 shillings and odds; which we refused. I was out when it came; and Jane could form no guess about whom it came from. I suspect Rob Hanning once more, unless it were some of the Annan people. Let us, while the play is good, give it up; and always write a Note rather, were it never so short.</p>
<p>Poor Ben Nelson has lost his son: he found him dead and buried when he got to Heidelberg; a melancholy thing as one can imagine. Ben bears it wonderfully. I saw him off yesternight, to Liverpool, where he ought to arrive tonight. I sent with him the little American Review promised to James Aitken which I had got a few days before, after long delays. Ben will probably send it forward not the next Wednesday, but the second: James&#x2019;s name and address is on it. There were only 3 copies of the French Revolution destined for the home Household: one copy for you; one for Alick; and a third marked &#x201C;for general use&#x201D;; which I intended should be sent from house to house among those of the brethren that wanted to <supplied>[read it]</supplied> and had no copy of their own. My Mother was to be <hi rend="italic">directress</hi> of it <supplied>[and see]</supplied> who was to get it after whom. At one time it was my clear purpose to send <supplied>[every one]</supplied> of you a copy: but when there came at last to be a kind of chance (as there now is) that the whole Edition might sell and a fraction of money lie at the bottom of it, I gave away none that did not seem absolutely needful, not above the third part of what I meant. Nobody in your region has got any; except the Churches of Kirkchrist who were good to me of old, and Mrs Johnstone of Grange who in her widowed forsaken state had a double claim on me. I gave copies here to three of the people who had been at the bottom of this my lecturing speculation:<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably Jane Wilson, Harriet Martineau, and Henry Taylor.</note> but all manner of rich people, Bullers &#x26;c, I left either to read the Book at their own cost, or to leave it altogether unread.</p>
<p>There is not yet <supplied>[an]</supplied> answer from Mr Greig in America; nor indeed is it very near the time yet for one. Forty days to go, forty to come, and the little intermediate delays; one may almost grant three months for Letter and answer. They have come in two sometimes but that is <pb id="pg-09-208" n="09:208"/>a rarity.&#x2014; It somehow strikes me that Alick will not go this summer; that I shall still find him to welcome me when I arrive. I can give no advice; only now as ever my hearty prayers and affection. I hope he sets a stout calm face to it; and that you and all of you study to cheer and encourage, and look at the best side of it. We may really with reason trust that it will be for good not for evil.&#x2014; I have of course no farther news from Jack. I have sent him a copy of the Book, by Paris and a path he marked out; but whether he will get it, seems rather uncertain to me.&#x2014; The sheet is full dear Mother and I must go. I force myself to believe that you are not out of order, that nothing is wrong. But you will write soon to say positively.</p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Your Letter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dated <date when="1837-05-23">23 May</date>.</note> reached me yesterday an hour or two before I went off to deliver my last German Lecture. I had written the week before a Letter to you at Jean&#x2019;s at Dumfries, a short scrawl, which perhaps you might receive and be reading just about the same hour. It was calculated to be in Dumfries on the Wednesday; and doubtless Jean would find some way of forwarding it. In the interim this fresh epistle from Jack<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> had come; testifying once more that all is well with him. I will now with such speed as is possible write you a line by way of winding up all these things.</p>
<p>Your brief expressions about Alick and yourself are full of sorrow, and go into my very heart for both of you. What can be done? Courage, my dear Mother; let us all pluck up a heart equal to the difficulty: the whole difficulty then is as good as done. One must have courage, and in the strength of the Giver of Strength dare and do what is fit and appointed. Jane and I have had a good deal of talk together about your scheme of transplanting Jamie to Craigenputtoch, that Alick might find room for himself in his own country.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle&#x2019;s mother had written: &#x201C;I came down from Dumfries last thursday bringing the long looked for Books with me which we had received the teusday before. I found them all in Confusion Alick preparing for America which I cannot think of almost on any account I have been thinking and thinking of Many things I was talking to Jamie about letting Him [Alick] have Scotsbrig next year provided Craigenp<supplied>[u]</supplied>ttick could be got for Himself [Jamie] when McAdams tack is done<supplied>[.]</supplied> I know well it is disagreeable to you to speak about it but think of me, there is too many of you far from me already I hope Mrs Welch would not have to repent it give my best love to her and Jane I hope they are both well now. Be so good as write as soon as you can as Alick is to flit on friday and will do nothing till we hear from you.&#x201D;</note> We both agree that it is quite needless to speak of it at all to Mrs Welsh at present;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In her capacity as life recipient of the rent for Craigenputtoch.</note> out of whom no practical result whatsoever could be got about it; at least none that we cannot quite as certainly <hi rend="italic">foresee</hi> without speaking about it. We are clear enough, then, that there could be no sort of objection to Jamie as a Tenant to succeed M&#x2019;Adam on such terms of rent as were going; that for us two it would of course be more agreeable to know our house &#x26;c in the possession of a Brother <pb id="pg-09-210" n="09:210"/>than of a stranger. There can be no question about all that. But I have great doubt myself whether the arrangement would be for good still; or only for temporary solacement, and then evil to all parties. In the first place is Scotsbrig itself a desirable position at present? Jamie contrives hitherto to pay the rent; but I think it very unlikely that more will ever be made of it, or of any other Scotch farm in our day; and very readily <hi rend="italic">less</hi> might be made, if the country go on as it threatens to do. And consider what Alick would think if he, having succeeded Jamie, were to prove unable to go on! It would go nigh to break his heart. And then on the other hand what does Jamie privately think about Craigenputtoch? Could he exist comfortably even if prosperous in those savage moors? I have preserved such a horror of the thing that I think I would fly to Newfoundland sooner than go back. Alas my dear Mother I fear it will not do. However as already said if the parties more immediately interested do resolve on venturing the Farm I have no doubt <supplied>[it]</supplied> can be had.&#x2014; But in good sooth my notion is that farming and all other industry in honesty is ruined in this country till some great black sea of troubles and uproar have been crossed; that bad days are in store for peaceable men here. It is a land suffering as under a Curse at present; that greatest curse that a <hi rend="italic">lying spirit</hi> has been put into the mouths and hearts of its people; a false lying spirit, not a true one, turn where you will! I question greatly whether the far wisest thing we could do were not to rise all as a family you still at the head of us, my dear Mother in spite of your years, and go <hi rend="italic">out of it</hi>. Beyond all doubt or cavil the man that is willing to work in America is sure of fair recompense for it. All evidence, of this colour or the other, goes to prove that at least. For those that are to leave families behind them in this England, it is a sad outlook<supplied>[.]</supplied></p>
<p>But on the whole what is to be done then? Poor Alick would be flitting yesterday while I was lecturing! I doubt he is at any rate too late for this year: no news still from Greig. My notion is therefore that he should either restrict himself to the enterprise of going himself and looking out this year as Jack has always been advising, or else to put it out of his plans till another spring. It is a year lost; but one cannot help it. At any rate he had better not fix on anything permanent till I come home; unless there be some necessity more pressing than I see. If there arise such a necessity, let him warn me, and I will come all the faster. If there be any inquiries that I can make for him at Liverpool, as I think there must be, he must put them on paper for me, and I will try to get to the bottom of them. <pb id="pg-09-211" n="09:211"/>You did not tell me where he was to be after Friday: is it at Annan still or where? Jenny and the <foreign>bairns</foreign> must have some quiet up-putting at any rate till spring next: for I think, as above said, that emigrating for this season is gone by.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alick postponed the decision again and opened a general store in one of Mrs. Carlyle&#x2019;s houses in Ecclefechan in <date when="1837-10-00">October</date>.</note> On the whole, my dear Mother, you must not discourage poor Alick; he is sore laden, I know, with many things: let him gird himself together with a resolution equal to them; there is heart and head in him to triumph over them <hi rend="italic">all</hi> yet. I never quit that hope for so brave a little fellow as I know him to be; <foreign>shifty</foreign> of hand and true of heart: but I do think America and not Scotland offers the far best chance for him.&#x2014;&#x2014; I write in such a confused state that you will hardly make out what I mean. But this is it in brief: That nothing as to Puttoch nor as to final emigrating to America be fixed till I come, if my advice be thought essential to it; that Puttoch be considered as attainable <hi rend="italic">if</hi> desirable; that Alick write to me if there be anything at all that I can ask about, here or at Liverpool: and on the whole that we all keep up our heart, and do not get dismal about it, or think it a thing of life and death; for it is not at all <hi rend="italic">that</hi> but quite other.</p>
<p>People have interrupted me, and my time is quite run without saying anything. My Lectures ended honourably; let us thank God for it! It is perhaps the beginning of better things for me. I have gained some &#xa3;135 or so by it.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >His mother had written: &#x201C;I was glad to learn by the times newspaper that you had got the first of your lectures honourably done I wept and read it again and again I hope they are finished by this time and you are preparing for comming home to see us soon.&#x201D; The <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, <date when="1837-05-02">2 May</date>, had ended its review, by Edward Sterling, thus: &#x201C;Mr. Carlyle would be pronounced, even by those who had nowhere seen him but in this unaccustomed theatre, to be a man of keen research, of independent and original powers of thought, of a genius fitted to grapple with difficulties, and to handle vigorously materials unwieldy and intractable. Those who have the advantage of knowing him elsewhere than in a lecture-room cannot but feel the most cordial interest in the success of a man so endeared by the virtues of his private character to all who know, in such a world as this, the value of truth, generosity, and honour.&#x201D; Fanny Wedgwood reported a slightly different verdict in a letter of <date when="1837-05-26">26 May</date> to Sarah Elizabeth Wedgwood: &#x201C;His lectures have succeeded as to money much better than we expected but from M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Empson&#x2019;s report who was here yesterday they are not highly rated &#x26; he does not take pains enough they are certainly much inferior to his conversation.&#x201D;</note></p>
<p>There is a franker come in (Sterling, one that can get franks); so I profit by him and rapidly close.</p>
<p>Ben Nelson got a Copy of the American Review<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >N. L.

<salute>My dear Jack,</salute>
<p>Your Letter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> came precisely eight days ago, the morning of my last Lecture but one; little Postie handed it to me on the street as I was going out to meditate. I have since heard from our Mother and written to her, enclosing that Roman despatch; and now the <foreign>hurly-burly</foreign> being in some measure over, I will answer you the first thing I do this day.</p>
<p>First therefore of Annandale. My Mother&#x2019;s Letter, written by her own hand from Annan the day before Whitsunday, was mostly about Alick and his going to America; against which step she protested in a very sorrowful way; and I could see had been talking and pleading with the old vehemence of affectionate fear, to all and sundry. She had brought it so far that Jamie, it seems, had consented to surrender Scotsbrig next year to Alick provided he himself could get Craigenputtoch to farm when M&#x2019;Adam was out of it: upon which our poor Mother wrote piteously to me to get this secured for her and them. I liked the look of all that badly. My conviction is that such an arrangement cannot prosper: but poor Alick is evidently very reluctant to quit home; and one cannot <hi rend="italic">drive</hi> him away even to his good. I answered my Mother that I feared it would never answer well; that for the rest Jamie <hi rend="italic">could</hi> certainly get Craigenputtoch on such terms as another when the time came, but that I had not spoken of it to Mrs Welsh as yet; that Alick being evidently too late for America this year, except as an <hi rend="italic">explorer</hi> by himself, ought to provide some up-putting for his family; and wait without any final determination at all till I came home, if he wanted my advice for deciding. But on the whole that I did decidedly counsel emigration, not for him only, <pb id="pg-09-213" n="09:213"/>but even if the whole clan went and Mother at the head of them I should think it well.&#x2014; So stands it. Alick was to quit his Hill house on friday last, but I did not gather whither he was going: indeed the whole matter will continue involved in obscurity till I go and examine it with my own eyes. The kindred seemed all well in health; our Mother had been at Dumfries for some weeks. I fear poor Alick will never do good in this country, encumbered and obstructed as it is: he ought to take a resolution; to <hi rend="italic">amputate</hi> where cure otherwise is desperate. There were no other tidings in my Mother&#x2019;s Letter: she longed to hear direct from you, and sent you her blessing; she was very glad about my Lectures &#x26;c, and seemed to be going on much as of old.&#x2014; Did I say last time that Ben Nelson passed thro&#x2019; this way on his road to Heidelberg where Edward lay ill? Poor Ben returned in 3 weeks a sad-hearted man: news met him at Mannheim that Edward was dead! He had died some two days before Ben got out of London. A young medical Scotchman had watched affectionately over him: he had died quite gently; saying himself that his life had all been smooth, that he had never known misery. Ben seemed to bear the matter with hard Dutch stoicism; not without natural emotion, yet not with very much of it. I never before had discerned what a dogged sort of man he is; obstinate, obdurate, and carries the mark of that too in his physiognomy. I studied to be as kind to him as I could, went to West<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Abbey &#x26;c with him, and saw him often: but he did not prove very presentable here; one night when I brought out Hunt to see him, he made an almost absurd figure; contradictory, pedantic, <foreign>a la</foreign> &#x201C;Ewart&#x2019;s shop&#x201D;;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-04/lt-18260414-TC-JAC-01"><sic>4:74</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1826-04-14">14 April 1826</date></corr></ref>.</note> at which poor Hunt could only arch his brows. I saw him safe into the Manchester Coach the friday before your Letter came. So ends poor innocent Edward!</p>
<p>My paper is filling with such rapidity that I must hasten to London business. The Book as you will have noticed has been out for several weeks. Your Copy (I have every reason to believe) got to No. 5. P.V. at Paris at least a fortnight ago; but what became of it after I do not guess. There were the two remaining volumes with the title-pages: it were good news for me to hear that you had them at Albano, and were reading them in these hot days you are like to have. As to the reception of the Book here I can say almost nothing: Fraser I think is not advertising it much; but of that he shall be left <hi rend="italic">free</hi> master for me: I do not think <hi rend="italic">any</hi>thing for or against, except as to <hi rend="italic">time</hi> merely, can depend on that. Some condemn me, as is very <pb id="pg-09-214" n="09:214"/>natural, for &#x201C;affectation.&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A hostile review in the <hi rend="italic">Athenaeum</hi>, <date when="1837-05-20">20 May</date>, said &#x201C;it is one thing to put forth a few pages of quaintness, neologism, and a whimsical coxcombry; and another, to carry such questionable qualities through three long volumes of misplaced persiflage and flippant pseudo-philosophy&#x201D; (p. 353).</note> Others are hearty, even passionate (as Mill) in their estimation. On the whole it strikes me as not unlikely that the Book may take some hold of the English People, and do them and itself a little good. Jeffrey writes me a very brisk Letter<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle had sent Jeffrey a copy of <hi rend="italic">The French Revolution</hi> and in his letter of <date when="1837-05-18">18 May</date> Jeffrey saw this as returning to &#x201C;that old kindness, which I had feared you were withdrawing from me.&#x201D; Most of the letter dealt with his first impressions of the book: &#x201C;which cannot be read anywhere without leaving the impression that the author (whatever else may be thought of him) is a man of Genius and originality. &#x2026; It &#x2026; is really, as Coleridge I think said of something else [in <hi rend="italic">Table Talk</hi> of Kean acting in Shakespeare], like reading a story by flashes of lightning!&#x2014; It is beyond all question the most <hi rend="italic">poetical</hi> history that the world has ever seen&#x2014;and the most moral also&#x2014;tho&#x2019; perhaps not the fullest of wisdom. The descriptions are the finest things in it. &#x2026; Your ratiocinations &#x2026; are less satisfactory, and not very intelligible&#x2014;you will be called affected. &#x2026; I do not myself approve of the style of the composition&#x2014; It is too odd, broken and ostentatiously irregular&#x2014; But what I object most to, is the tone of <hi rend="italic">mockery</hi>&#x2014;and Mephistephelestic <hi rend="italic">humour</hi>.&#x201D;</note> about it last week; full of good augury, of praise and blame, and how I shall infallibly be much praised and much blamed, and on the whole carry my point; really a kind hearty Letter from the little man; which I design to answer today or tomorrow. Mill is writing a review of me for his &#x201C;London &#x26; Westminster,&#x201D; so they call it now. I have given away very few copies, seeing there is some chance of sale now, and of money still lying in it. I sent one copy to the Churches of Kirkchrist; one to Mrs Johnstone of Grange; three to our own Kindred, two to Edinburgh (Inglis had <hi rend="italic">promise</hi> of one): the rest some twenty in all were distributed here, chiefly among those that had helped my Lecturing scheme. We shall see what the thing turns to. It is really rather welcome to turn as it likes. I have done with it; no longer does it strangle the life out of <hi rend="italic">me:</hi> there is the fact of facts!</p>
<p>As to the Lectures, I know not whether you saw in the Newspapers which I sent or which you might otherwise get hold of, what indications there were: but the truth is the thing went off not without effect; and I have great cause to be thankful that I am so handsomely quit of it. The audience, composed of mere quality and notabilities, was very humane to me; they seemed indeed to be not a little astonished at the wild Annandale voice, which occasionally got high and earnest; in these cases they sat as still under me as stones. I had, I think, 200 and odd. The pecuniary net-result is &#xa3;135, the expenses being great, and the mismanagement of Booksellers &#x26;c <pb id="pg-09-215" n="09:215"/>coming in for something. But the ulterior issues of it may by possibility be less inconsiderable. It seems possible I may get into a kind of way of lecturing or otherwise speaking direct to my fellow-creatures; and so get delivered out of this awful quagmire of difficulties in which you have so long seen me struggle and wriggle. We will wait what the days bring. Heaven be thanked that it is <hi rend="italic">done</hi>, for this time, so tolerably; and we here still alive! I hardly ever in my life had such a moment as that of the commencement when you were thinking of me at Rome. My Printers had only ceased the day before; I was wasted and fretted to a thread, my tongue let me drink as I would continued dry as charcoal: the people were there, I was obliged to stumble in, and start. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Ach Gott!</hi></foreign> But it was got thro&#x2019;; and so here we are.&#x2014; Our Mother was &#x201C;<foreign>black-baised</foreign>,&#x201D; tho&#x2019; I had written to her to be only &#x201C;white-baised&#x201D;; but she read the notice in the <hi rend="italic">Times,</hi> and &#x201C;wept&#x201D; she tells me, and again read it.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370428-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1837-04-28">28 April</date></ref>, and <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370527-TC-MAC-01"><date when="1837-05-27">27 May</date></ref>.</note> One ought to be thankful, and struggle on. Jane went to the last four Lectures, and did not faint.</p>
<p>And now I am delving the Garden to compose myself, and meaning to have things leisurely settled up here, and then start for Scotland. I should much approve of your scheme of going all in a bod<supplied>[y; in]</supplied>deed I have tried it every way: but it will not do. Quiet observation forces on me the conclusion <supplied>[that]</supplied> Jane and her Mother <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> live together. Very sad and miserable you will say. Truly; but so it <supplied>[is. I]</supplied> am farther bound to say that that chief blame does verily not lie at our side of the house. Nay who would be in haste to lay blame anywhere. But poor Mrs Welsh with literally &#x201C;the <hi rend="italic">best</hi> intentions&#x201D; is a person you cannot live with peaceably on any other terms I could ever discover than those of disregarding altogether the whims emotions caprices and conclusions she takes up chameleon-like by the thousand daily. She and I do very well together on <hi rend="italic">these</hi> terms (at least I do); but Jane and she cannot live so. They must not go to Templand together. And now whether she could do well at Scotsbrig with me or not is a question too. It seems best therefore that I go by myself; that we try for a few weeks and see. Mrs Welsh seems to think of going off home in a short time: but Jane I think prefers being left here, and thinks she should even do better without the perpetual pouting and fretting she is tried with let the rest go as it might: besides she will not be alone, having Mrs Sterling here, a kind warm friend. So then it seems to be settling itself: that I shall go shortly at <pb id="pg-09-216" n="09:216"/>any rate; that she shall stay here, alone if her Mother will not continue with her, and thereafter see how the thing turns. How long I shall be able to brook Scotsbrig is not certain either; but surely I do not design returning hither to the heats of London, which I detest as to summer climate above all places on Earth; not till the cold shew face again, or at least the coolness. Had you been here what pretty jaunts we might have made! But you are not here. I will get Books, perhaps take a little work with me; I mean to have some horse or <foreign>garron</foreign> [small, sturdy horse]; to hold my peace and rest myself, of which really I have some need. In the mean time I believe my health is not fundamentally hurt; rest will cure me. I must be a toughish kind of <foreign>lath</foreign> after all, for my life here these three years has been sore and stern, almost frightful, nothing but Eternity beyond it in which seemed any peace. Perhaps better days are now beginning.

What to do next we shall see better by and by. But here is the bottom of the paper! My <hi rend="italic">interior</hi> is hot, hot; I am not in mood for writing. Besides the paper is too small, and the pen bad; but I found no remedy on looking in the drawer. I grow better in health however, daily. I delve, as you heard; I walk much, generally alone, thro&#x2019; the lanes and Parks; the weather has been cold and suitable for <hi rend="italic">me</hi> if for nothing else; it is not yet grown intolerably hot; when it does I shall run. I have lived much alone for a long time; refusing to go anywhere; <pb id="pg-09-217" n="09:217"/>finding indeed no pleasure in going anywhere, in speaking with any one.

<p><salute>Dear John</salute> I do not find that my husband has given you any adequate notion of the success of his lectures; but you will make large allowance for the known modesty of the man. Nothing that he has ever tried seems to me to have carried such conviction to the public heart that he is a real man of genius and worth being kept alive at a moderate rate. Lecturing were surely an easier profession than authorship ! We shall see. My cough is quite gone and there <supplied>[is]</supplied> no consumption about me at present&#x2014;I expect to grow strong now that he has nothing more to worry him.

<salute>My dear Friend,</salute>
<p>A word must go to Concord in answer to your last kind word.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson&#x2019;s letter of <date when="1837-03-31">31 March</date>.</note> It reached me that word of yours on the morning of a most unspeakable day; the day when I half dead with fret agitation and exasperation was to address <foreign>extempore</foreign> an audience of London quality people on the subject of German Literature!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1837-05-01">1 May</date>.</note> The heart&#x2019;s wish of me was that I might be left in deepest oblivion, wrapt in blankets and silence, not speaking, not spoken to, for a twelvemonth to come. My Printers had only let me go, out of their Treadmill, the day before. However, all that is over now; and I am still here alive to write to you, and hope for better days.</p>
<p>Almost a month ago there went a copy of a Book called <hi rend="italic">French Revolution</hi> with your address on it over to Red-Lion Square, and thence, as old Rich<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350203-TC-RWE-01">TC to RWE, <date when="1835-02-03">3 Feb. 1835</date></ref>.</note> declared himself now <foreign><hi rend="italic">emeritus</hi></foreign>, back to one Kennet<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Richard James Kennett, bookseller, 14 York St., Covent Garden.</note> (I think) near Covent Garden; who professes to correspond with Hilliard &#x26; Company, Boston,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hilliard, Gray, and Co., publishers.</note> and undertook the service. The <pb id="pg-09-219" n="09:219"/>Book is not gone yet, I understand; but Kennet engages that it shall leave Liverpool infallibly on the <date when="1837-06-05">fifth of June</date>. I wish you a happy reading of it therefore: it is the only copy of my sending that has crossed the water. Ill printed (there are many errors, one or two gross ones); ill written, ill thought! But in fine it <hi rend="italic">is</hi> off my hands; that is a fact worth all others. As to its reception here or elsewhere, I anticipate nothing or little. Gabble, gabble, the astonishment of the dull public brain is likely to be considerable, and its ejaculations unedifying. We will let it go its way. Beat this thing, I say always, under thy dull hoofs, O dull Public; trample it and tumble it into all sinks and kennels; if thou canst kill it, kill it in God&#x2019;s name: if thou canst not kill it, why then thou wilt not.</p>
<p>By the bye speaking of dull Publics, I ought to say that I have seen a Review of myself in the <hi rend="italic">Christian Examiner</hi> (I think that is it, of Boston); the author of which, if you know him, I desire you to thank on my part.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >N. L. Frothingham (see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370213-TC-RWE-01">TC to RWE, <date when="1837-02-13">13 Feb.</date></ref>).</note> For if a dull million is good, then withal a seeing unit or two is also good. This man images back a beautiful idealized Clothes-Philosopher, very satisfactory to look upon; in whose beatified features I did verily detect more similitude to what I myself meant to be than in any or all the other criticisms I have yet seen written of me. That a man see himself reflected from the soul of his brother man in this brotherly improved way: there surely is one of the most legitimate joys of existence. Friend Ripley took the trouble to send me the Review, in which I detected an Article of his own;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ripley had reviewed James Martineau, <hi rend="italic">Rationale of Religious Enquiry</hi> (London, <date when="1836-00-00">1836</date>) in the <date when="1836-11-00">November</date> issue of <hi rend="italic">Christian Examiner</hi>, but, according to Slater, nothing in the <date when="1836-09-00">September</date> issue.</note> then came also some Discourses of his much to be approved of, a Newspaper passage-of-fence with a Philistine of yours;<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Professor Andrews Norton (<date when="1786-00-00">1786</date>&#x2013;<date when="1853-00-00">1853</date>), father of Charles Eliot Norton (<date when="1827-00-00">1827</date>&#x2013;<date when="1908-00-00">1908</date>), later Carlyle&#x2019;s friend and editor. Andrews Norton had denounced in the <hi rend="italic">Boston Daily Advertiser</hi> an article by Ripley in the <hi rend="italic">Christian Examiner</hi> as a &#x201C;step towards infidelity,&#x201D; and Ripley had replied in the <hi rend="italic">Daily Advertiser</hi>. See O. B. Frothingham, <hi rend="italic">George Ripley</hi> (Boston, <date when="1882-00-00">1882</date>), p. 96. In his letter of <date when="1836-12-29">29 Dec. 1836</date>, Ripley had said of Norton: &#x201C;one of the most violent enemies of the whole &#x2018;Teufelsdr&#xF6;ck&#x2019; school. In some respects, he may be justly deemed to stand at the head of our theological literature. He is an admirable scholar &#x26; a pure &#x26; vigorous writer. He has ruled the minds of his pupils with an iron rod for many years; his prodigious sarcasm &#x26; almost infallible accuracy spreading terror whenever he speaks. As he sustains such a relation to Goethe &#x26; yourself, &#x26; indeed to all the Germans, I dare say, you may be interested in a little &#x2018;passage at arms&#x2019; which has recently taken place between him &#x26; myself.&#x201D;</note> and a set of Essays on <pb id="pg-09-220" n="09:220"/>Progress-of-the-species and such like<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified. In his letter of <date when="1836-12-29">29 Dec. 1836</date> Ripley referred only to &#x201C;one or two books &#x26; pamphlets&#x201D; (Slater, <hi rend="italic">GRTC</hi>, p. 346).</note> by a man whom I grieved to see confusing himself with that. Progress of the species is a thing I can get no good of at all. These Books, which Miss Martineau has borrowed from me, did not arrive till three weeks ago or less. I pray you to thank Ripley for them very kindly; which at present I still have not time to do. He seems to me a good man, with good aims; with considerable natural health of mind, wherein all goodness is likely to grow better, all clearness to grow clearer. Miss Martineau laments that he does not fling himself, or not with the due impetuosity, into the Black Controversy; a thing lamentable in the extreme when one considers what a world this is, and how perfect it would be could Mungo once get his stupid case rectified, and eat his squash as a stupid <hi rend="italic">Apprentice</hi> instead of a stupid <hi rend="italic">Slave!</hi></p>
<p>Miss Martineau&#x2019;s Book on America is out,<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370530-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1837-05-30">30 May</date></ref>.</note> here and with you. I have read it for the good Authoress&#x2019;s sake, whom I love much. She is one of the strangest phenomena to me. A genuine little Poetess, buckramed, swathed like a mummy, into Socinian and Political-Economy formulas; and yet verily alive in the inside of that! &#x201C;God has given a Prophet to every People in its own speech,&#x201D; say the Arabs.<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. &#x201C;We have not sent any Apostle, save with the speech of his own people,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">El-Kor&#xe2;n, Surah</hi> XIV, verse 4, trans. J. M. Rodwell (London, <date when="1876-00-00">1876</date>), p. 236. Carlyle may have been following Goethe&#x2019;s translation (see Norton, <hi rend="italic">GC</hi>, p. 18).</note> Even the English Unitarians were one day to have their Poet, and the best that could be said for them too was to be said. I admire this good lady&#x2019;s integrity, sincerity; her quick sharp discernment to the depth it goes: her love also is great; nay in fact it is too great<supplied>[: the]</supplied> host of illustrious obscure mortals whom she produces on you, of Preachers, Pamph<supplied>[leteers,]</supplied> Anti-slavers, Able Editors, and other Atlases bearing (unknown to us) the world on their shoulder, is absolutely more than enough. What they say to her Book here I do not well know. I fancy the general reception will be good, and even brilliant. I saw Mrs Butler<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Fanny Kemble.</note> last night, &#x201C;in an ocean of blonde and broadcloth,&#x201D; one of those oceans common at present. <foreign>Ach Gott!</foreign> They are not of Persons these <foreign>soirees</foreign> but of Cloth Figures.<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson had written to Carlyle: &#x201C;I see plainly that our society, for the most part, is as bigoted as to the <hi rend="italic">respectabilities</hi> of religion &#x26; education as yours; that there is no more appetite for a revelation here than elsewhere; and the educated class are, of course, less fair-minded than others. Yet in the moments when my eyes are open, I see that here are rich materials for the philosopher &#x26; poet, &#x26;, what is more to your purpose as an artist, that we have in these parts no one philosopher or poet to put a sickle to the prairie wheat.&#x201D;</note></p>
<p><pb id="pg-09-221" n="09:221"/>I mean to retreat into Scotland very soon, to repose myself as I intended. My Wife continues here with her Mother; here at least till the weather grow too hot, or a journey to join me seem otherwise advisable for her. She is gathering strength, but continues still weak enough. I rest myself &#x201C;on the sunny side of hedges&#x201D;<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle quotes Jane (see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370304-JWC-JWE-01">JWC to <sic>JW</sic><corr>JWE</corr>, <date when="1837-03-04">4 March</date></ref>, and <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370625-TC-MWE-01">TC to <sic>MW</sic><corr>MWE</corr>, <date when="1837-06-25">25 June</date></ref>).</note> in native Annandale, one of the obscurest regions; no man shall speak to me, I will speak to no man; but have dialogues yonder with the old dumb crags, of the most unfathomable sort. Once rested, I think of returning to London for another season. Several things are beginning which I ought to see end before taking up my staff again. In this enormous Chaos the very multitude of conflicting perversions produces something more like a <hi rend="italic">calm</hi> than you can elsewhere meet with. Men let you alone, which is an immense thing: they do it even because they have no time to meddle with you. London, or else the Back-woods, of America, or Craigenputtoch! We shall see.</p>
<p>I still beg the comfort of hearing from you. I am sick of soul and body, but not incurable; the loving word of a Waldo Emerson is as balm to me, medicinal now more than ever. My Wife earnestly joins me in love to the Concord Household. May a blessing be in it, on one and all! I do nowise give up the idea of sojourning there one time yet. On the contrary, it seems almost certain that I shall. Good be with you.</p>

<salute>My dear Sterling,</salute>
<p>There came to my Wife a brave Letter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dated <date when="1837-05-30">30 May</date>: &#x201C;To Her (<date when="1837-05-20">May 20 [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] 1837</date>)&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note in his later hand).</note> the other day; which was read by us both with great pleasure. Your Father and Mother have it in their hands this very morning, as I calculate; reading it down at <pb id="pg-09-225" n="09:225"/>Ascot Races, whither they are all gone. Said Letter is not the cause of my writing at present, for I had long meditated that; but it perhaps accelerates me; surely it does not retard. By the bye, I wish you would write oftener, without waiting for answer and return of post; believe always that plenty of answers are flying towards you invisible thro&#x2019; the air, and write when your Daemon bids you, and there lies a pen ready. Is not that a modest request? I wish at present all manner of good men would speak to me by post or otherwise, and require no answer but a Turkish bow.</p>
<p>We rejoice to believe and see that you are much better in spirits and health than you were; shaking off the winter sediments; clearing yourself up into Life with the new Summer. Blackwood&#x2019;s Farrago shall be notable to me when the Table of Contents indicates any of those things.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sterling had told Jane: &#x201C;I have sent some short ones [poems] to Blackwoods Magazine where they will appear under the title of Lyric Leaves. &#x2026; He asked me for prose &#x26; I sent him some scraps which I had designated by the absurd title of Crystals from a Cavern &#x2026; and a couple of old Fancies I had by me called Legendary Lore.&#x201D; &#x201C;Crystals from a Cavern&#x201D; appeared in <hi rend="italic">Blackwood&#x2019;s Magazine</hi>, XLII and XLIII (<date when="1837-07-00">July 1837</date> and <date when="1838-03-00">March 1838</date>), 39&#x2013;43 and 354&#x2013;59; &#x201C;Legendary Lore&#x201D; became a series, the first appearing in XLII (<date when="1837-10-00">Oct. 1837</date>), 480&#x2013;87, the last in XLVII (<date when="1840-02-00">Feb. 1840</date>), 253&#x2013;59. No poems appeared under the title of &#x201C;Lyric Leaves&#x201D; but John Wilson used several of Sterling&#x2019;s poems in &#x201C;Our Two Vases,&#x201D; XLII (<date when="1837-10-00">Oct. 1837</date>), 562&#x2013;72, and in &#x201C;Poetry by our New Contributor,&#x201D; XLII (<date when="1837-11-00">Nov. 1837</date>), 573&#x2013;603. In the latter Wilson criticises <hi rend="italic">The French Revolution</hi> and offers two of Sterling&#x2019;s poems on Mirabeau and Louis XV &#x201C;which we venture to prefer to all he [Carlyle] has written about the same personages in his portentous prose. &#x2026; our excellent Carlisle [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] must admit that our New Contributor &#x2026; knows Louis XV., and what is more, Mirabeau, every whit as well as himself, without &#x2026; making as much fuss about the matter as if we had found a mare&#x2019;s nest, with a brood of foals just chipping the shells&#x201D; (pp. 592&#x2013;93). For Sterling&#x2019;s correspondence with <hi rend="italic">Blackwood&#x2019;s Magazine</hi>, see Margaret Oliphant, <hi rend="italic">Annals of a Publishing House</hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1897-00-00">1897</date>), II, 186&#x2013;92.</note> Otherwise for the last seven years I know little of Blackwood. One Number solely, by some accident, fell into my hands last winter: of entirely ditch-water character; Wilson himself weltering about in it like a thing that <hi rend="italic">had</hi> been. His palaver about &#x201C;Mrs Gentle&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mentioned briefly in his review of &#x201C;The Birth-day, a poem.

<p>I ought surely to send you a touch of practical terrestrial news before ending. But indeed I have small faculty, and suppose you better supplied already from other quarters. I have done nothing of late but dig earth and brick-rubbish in this little <hi rend="italic">Garden</hi> so-called; and walk solitary in the Lanes; rather avoiding than seeking the face of men. Very spectral I am every way. My purpose now is, directly when the weather gets too hot, to fly into Scotland, to my Mother&#x2019;s cottage, and lie buried there for some time. How long I cannot say: <foreign><hi rend="italic">ce sera selon</hi></foreign> [that will depend]. A beautiful hope is that you hold out to me, of rambling in the Pyrenees beside you!<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sterling had invited both Carlyles to visit him in Bordeaux, adding: &#x201C;I had some notion of running to the Pyrenees for a week or two &#x26; would wait for him as long as he pleased.&#x201D;</note> In very truth, I will inquire at Liverpool what Bourdeaux Ships sail thence, what the cost is, &#x26;c, &#x26;c; and keep the possibility lying by me, as one of the beautifullest the time offers.

B.&#x201D; My Wife continues here, with her Mother who came u<supplied>[p to]</supplied> us when the Influenza proved so hard. The poor Dame has a headache this morning; and knows not that I am writing to you, or her love were duly forwarded to all of you: she loves you all, I do know, so as people are not often loved at present here below. We are to lose Anthony;<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Apparently going to Switzerland, en route to Corfu where his regiment, the 73rd Foot, was posted.</note> which grieves us all. He is a right fellow, with those black eyes of his, so sharp and yet so quiet; a man it would do one good to look upon once daily. Can you explain to me rightly, where did these two fellows John and Anthony come from? They are very singular characters to see in this world in these times. Your Father and I go along very lovingly, with a sudden broadside of Logic now and then, each to shew the other that he does carry gunpowder. We are smoke over the masthead on these occasions; but it seems to purify the air between us, and then we sail along in the sweetest manner, gentle as Babes in the wood. Your Mother looks cheerful and well: it seems to be still uncertain whether she will not go and look at Switzerland with Anthony. I met Maurice in the Strand yesterday. He is growing broader, thicker, and gets a clerical <pb id="pg-09-228" n="09:228"/>air. I know not why I should not wish him clerical or an English Clergyman, yet I never do. His vehement earnestness in twisting such a rope of sand as I reckon that to be occasions me at times a certain misgiving. Written very legible to my eyes stands the doom of that thing. I will even praise Sterling&#x2019;s ill health which has taken <hi rend="italic">him</hi> out of it without damage. Excuse my insolence. But I do think what I say, and more than I say. A man like Sterling cannot stand on cobwebs; O Heavens, no, he must have adamant to stand on, there is so much to front! <foreign><hi rend="italic">Quittons cela</hi></foreign> [Let us leave that].</p>
<p>I cannot say a word to you, of the Book or of the Lectures, except that by the unspeakable blessing of Heaven they are <hi rend="italic">finished</hi>.<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sterling had said: &#x201C;I want far more details than I can get as to the people who attended&#x2014;&#x26; especially as to how they listened&#x2014;whether like statues in grand stolidity&#x2014;or like monkeys when they hear the rumble of the wheelbarrow bringing them nuts&#x2014;.&#x201D; He also suggested Carlyle published his lectures on German Literature along with suitable illustrations.</note> My hearers were Mixtiform, Dandiacal of both sexes, <hi rend="italic">Dryasdust</hi>ical (Hallam<note n="15" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henry Hallam (<date when="1777-00-00">1777</date>&#x2013;<date when="1859-00-00">1859</date>), historian, father of Tennyson&#x2019;s friend Arthur (<date when="1811-00-00">1811</date>&#x2013;<date when="1833-00-00">33</date>).</note> &#x26;c), ingenuous, ingenious; and grew on the whole more and more silent. As to the Book<note n="16" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sterling, having just received <hi rend="italic">The French Revolution</hi>, had only glanced at it: &#x201C;I saw enough however to give me fears &#x26; hopes&#x2014;hopes as to the book&#x2014;fears as to its readers.&#x201D;</note> I rather avoid hearing about it, what clack there may be about it; of lamentation, admonition: &#x201C;The style; ah, the style!&#x201D; These poor people seem to think a style can be put off or put on not like a <hi rend="italic">skin</hi> but like a coat! Now I refer it to Sterling himself (enemy as he is), whether a skin be not verily the product and close kinsfellow of all that lies under it; exact type of the nature of the beast: <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to be plucked off without flaying and death. The Public is an old woman: let her maunder and mumble.&#x2014; I have met with an excellent Arabian thing the other day: Hariri&#x2018;s <hi rend="italic">Ebu Seid</hi> translated into German by R&#xfc;ckert,<note n="17" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Friedrich R&#xfc;ckert (<date when="1788-00-00">1788</date>&#x2013;<date when="1866-00-00">1866</date>), <hi rend="italic">Die Verwandlungen des Abu Seid von Serug, oder die Makamen des Hariri</hi> (Stuttgart and T&#xfc;bingen, <date when="1837-00-00">1837</date>); al-Har<hi rend="overscore">i</hi>r<hi rend="overscore">i</hi> (<date when="1054-00-00">1054</date>&#x2013;<date when="1122-00-00">1122</date>), scholar and poet.</note> mark it down in your Notebook, and read it the first chance you have. A genuine living soul; fiery-vital in its kind; shining thro&#x2019; a most exotic Arab vesture: hardly any other kind of reading does me any good.

<p>My Brother writes almost every Letter that you ought to winter not at Pisa but at Rome: he declares again and again that Rome <pb id="pg-09-229" n="09:229"/>were better for you. I know not that he is quite incorrupt in that judgement: he has clearly a deep secret desire to have you near his own dwelling place. Yet do consult him, and take seriously into view what he will urge. He knows about that matter, as well as most do, and is a veracious man, not to be biassed beyond limits by any wish of his own in your case.&#x2014; O that I were in the Campan valley, Sterling sitting on one crag, I on another, the Pyrenean sky and cliffs overhead, a pipe in one&#x2019;s teeth, the Kensington stick<note n="19" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The stick which Sterling had given Carlyle (see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18361003-TC-JOST-01">TC to <sic>JS</sic><corr>JOST</corr>, <date when="1836-10-03">3 Oct. 1836</date></ref>).</note> at one&#x2019;s feet, and the world with its &#x201C;vociferous platitudes&#x201D; a thousand miles off!&#x2014; <foreign>Adieu</foreign> my Friend; may a good Guidance go with you whithersoever you wend.

<salute>My dear Dr Eckermann,</salute>
<p>A good many months ago I received a very kind Letter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> from you, which till now has never been answered. It contained a message for <pb id="pg-09-222" n="09:222"/>Mrs Austin about some business of Madam Bettina von Arnheim&#x2019;s;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Elisabeth or Bettina von Arnim (see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18360412-TC-JOST-01">TC to <sic>JS</sic><corr>JOST</corr>, <date when="1836-04-12">12 April 1836</date></ref>).</note> which message I remember walking off to deliver, with great punctuality, that very morning; the private afflictions and destinies which you recorded for me were read, and have been often thought of here, with true interest and sympathy: but there the matter rested; in words I answered nothing. It was very wrong; nevertheless I doubt not you can forgive me. My time has been overcrowded with toils here; my heart overloaded with cares: for a long while I gave up writing to all persons, except my Mother and a Brother I have in Rome. This literally is the first slake in my bottle; which I make use of to recal myself to your remembrance.</p>
<p>The great thing I have been doing, under sad enough circumstances, is a <hi rend="italic">History of the French Revolution</hi>; a Copy of which I will this day despatch to Weimar for your friendly perusal. The mode of conveyance is not very certain as to time and conditions: my Bookseller will entrust the Book to a Mr Black Importer of German Books here, whose representative at Leipzig is Herr Herbig, thro&#x2019; which latter the Packet will come to you.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For Black and Herbig, see <ref target="volume-05/lt-18291103-TC-G-01"><sic>5:28&#x2013;29</sic><corr>TC to G, <date when="1829-11-03">3 Nov. 1829</date></corr></ref>.</note> One would think you should have it in a few weeks. It is the same vehicle by which <hi rend="italic">Sartor Resartus</hi> reached you safely enough. If any unusual delay occur I will thank you to apply to Herr Herbig; or, should that yield nothing, to give me warning here, and I will see into it.&#x2014; As to the Book itself, they say it is likely to make a noise, to be abused, lamented, praised &#x26;c: you, on looking into it, will easily judge that my blessedness is in good part independent of that; the blessedness of a man who has <hi rend="italic">ended</hi> and shaken off from him a thing that was like to take his life with it! For in addition to all, I <hi rend="italic">lost my First Volume</hi> when it was finished, by a Friend&#x2019;s inattention and his housemaid&#x2019;s stupidity:<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350307-TC-JFR-01">TC to <sic>JF</sic><corr>JFR</corr>, <date when="1835-03-07">7 March 1835</date></ref>.</note> the First Volume was all burnt, and I had to write it over again; a thing I would never try to do a second time, nor advise any man to try. God be thanked&#x2014;therefore that is off my hands, I say always! Let it make noise, of what sort it likes, or of no sort but die in eternal silence: that is not my concern but other men&#x2019;s.</p>
<p>Of you I have heard more than once since you wrote. A Mrs Jameson,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Anna Brownell Jameson (see <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340506-TC-JPE-01"><sic>7:144</sic><corr>TC to JPE, <date when="1834-05-06">6 May 1834</date></corr></ref>).</note> who lived long at Weimar, in your circle came here into ours, and had much to tell. I listened with interest one afternoon to many things about you and Madam von Goethe and a place and <pb id="pg-09-223" n="09:223"/>Society that can never become indifferent to me. Mrs Jameson was clearly a loving reporter; but I saw thro&#x2019; her eyes more directly than I had done into the condition of several things. With Madam von Goethe she appeared to be really almost what one can call <hi rend="italic">in love</hi>. Will you, pray, offer my affectionate remembrances to that Lady, joined cordially with my Wife&#x2019;s. Her <foreign><hi rend="italic">Semainaire</hi></foreign>,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-05/lt-18291103-TC-G-01"><sic>5:27</sic><corr>TC to G, <date when="1829-11-03">3 Nov. 1829</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310914-TC-JWC-01"><sic>430</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1831-09-14">14 Sept. 1831</date></corr></ref>.</note> the work of her fingers, hangs on the wall here and many a graceful memorial of her. May all good always be with her and hers.</p>
<p>A still more direct glimpse of you we had thro&#x2019; the Book of <hi rend="italic">Gespr&#xE4;che</hi>.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-09/lt-18360912-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1836-09-12">12 Sept. 1836</date></ref>.</note> I succeeded early in borrowing a Copy of that Book, and read it with what zeal you can fancy. I know not what they said in Germany; but here all voices were unanimously favourable. The picture you unconsciously and with fore thought give of yourself caught all heads by the favourable side. I know nothing better in that kind than that <foreign><hi rend="italic">Jugendgeschichte</hi></foreign> [youth tale]: there is the simplicity of genuine goodness, the calmness and cheerfulness of real strength, victorious after great obstacles. And then the view we get of our Goethe in his household environment; our World-Poet conditioned down into a Weimar Burgher, what he says, what he does, how he looks and lives in that capacity: it was attractive to me beyond all Poems, <hi rend="italic">being</hi> indeed the best of Poems. For finally, as Mrs Jameson remarked, and as even a stranger may discover and believe, <hi rend="italic">all accurately true:</hi> if at any time the Author, his colloquy being ended, records that &#x201C;the summer dawn was streaming up over the heights,&#x201D; one <hi rend="italic">knows</hi> that such dawn was actually there, and it may continue streaming up in our imaginations safely forevermore. I predict that your Book will endure thro&#x2019; long centuries. I had but one regret over it: <supplied>[th]</supplied>at it was not four times as l<supplied>[ar]</supplied>ge a Book.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Eckermann published a third volume in <date when="1848-00-00">1848</date>.</note></p>
<p>We go on learning German at a very considerable rate still in this Country. My own views have been turned quite elsewhither of late years; but the fire is kindled which will not go out again. Nay we are beginning to discover now, not without amazement, that we also are Germans; that it is a credit to belong to such a kindred!&#x2014; I know not if you have chanced to hear that some Friends set me up in this huge Babylon in these late weeks to lecture on the subject. It was actually so; and went off, despite all drawbacks, in a surprisingly handsome manner. My audience I understand (for I durst hardly look at them, speaking <foreign><hi rend="italic">extempore</hi></foreign> was so ticklish for me) consisted of <pb id="pg-09-224" n="09:224"/>mere quality and notabilities, male and female; the flower of London: they sat, and listened as silent as possible; learnt from me that the characteristic of <foreign><hi rend="italic">Teutschen</hi></foreign> [Germanic] and <foreign>Teutons</foreign> was what Goethe called it, <foreign><hi rend="italic">Tapferkeit</hi></foreign> [valor] and all that goes along with that noble word; that Luther, K&#xEB;pler,<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18180728-TC-TM-01"><sic>1:136</sic><corr>TC to TM, <date when="1818-07-28">28 July 1818</date></corr></ref>.</note> Milton, Franklin<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Benjamin Franklin (<date when="1706-00-00">1706</date>&#x2013;<date when="1790-00-00">90</date>).</note> were properly <hi rend="italic">valiant</hi> men; all of one kindred; a great kindred, which did seem as if it were destined to subdue all things before it, and one day rule over the whole circuit of the world. Our last Lecture was on Goethe.<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The added seventh lecture.</note> German Literature has not before exhibited itself in so decisive a manner anywhere in this country.</p>
<p>Being literally quite worn out with one thing and another, I am now about running into Scotland for two months of rest. My Wife continues here with her Mother. She suffered greatly from that Influenza last winter; so much that at one time we were in real fright, and her mother hastened up to us. All is now better. She sends you her affectionate regards and wishes. <foreign>Adieu</foreign> my worthy Friend. I beg you always to believe me&#x2014;<closer><salute>most faithfully yours</salute></closer></p>
<name>T. Carlyle</name>
<ps><p>I may note on this margin a thing you can perhaps do for me. Of the <hi rend="italic">Nachgelassene Werke</hi> [<hi rend="italic">Posthumous Works</hi>] I have two <foreign><hi rend="italic">Lieferungen</hi></foreign> [instalments] which you sent me:<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340815-TC-JAC-01"><sic>7:274&#x2013;75</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1834-08-15">15 Aug. 1834</date></corr></ref>.</note> the third and last is still wanting and not to be had here. Half a year ago, Mr Black applied, by my earnest order, to the German <foreign><hi rend="italic">Buchhandlung</hi></foreign> [book dealers], but without any result; they cannot sell a separate <foreign>Lieferung</foreign>. Perhaps you could ask about it, and send me guidance.</p></ps>

<p>I make no doubt but you are wearying much to hear of me, what I am about, what I mean to do. My last Letter was hardly intelligible; written in such haste and confusion. I send you a short word today; it need not be a long one, as I hope to see you face to face so soon.</p>
<p>Ever since I wrote, I have been as idle as a man need be. The Garden is all dug and cleared, the bushes all pruned; I lie about on chairs and sofas, reading harmless books, or stroll out among the green hedges; and rest as well as I can. On the whole, I am better <pb id="pg-09-230" n="09:230"/>than I could expect. The late and cool summer too suits me, if it suit nothing else; we have moisture, we have wind; so long as that will last, this is a very good summer place for me, and my natural laziness has recommended me to lie still. Now however, I think, the hot weather is coming: in that case, I must actually bestir myself, and get under way.</p>
<p>Accordingly I have procured all manner of Coach Advertisement<supplied>[s,]</supplied> Steamboat Advertisements &#x26;c, and am seriously beginning to consider. I have fixed no day yet, nor no way; but I think I will go by Manchester; I think I shall have a chance to see in perhaps a fortnight hence, or less. The end of this week or the beginning of next; that is the time spoken of for departure. My likeliest route after all is by some Coach to Manchester at once. I will write of course to Jenny to give warning. My next Letter to you I hope will be a short one, somewhere from the north of England; announcing which day I shall come. You can keep asking from time to time. I hope to land safe at Annan Waterfoot,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340518-TC-JAC-01"><sic>7:161</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1834-05-18">18 May 1834</date></corr></ref>.</note> and see you all safe.</p>
<p>Jane goes on very well here, and gathers strength in the good weather. One would call her quite as well as usual; which is rather surprising, considering the state she was in not many months ago. Her Mother is to stay with her till I come back; unless a journey to me in Scotland should grow to seem advisable.&#x2014; I will bring a Book or two with me; I hope Jamie has some kind of quadruped, dwarf-carthorse or other; I mean to lie hidden from all the world, and not speak above three or four words in a day.</p>
<p>There is still no Letter from America, nor do I know certainly when one is to be looked for. What Alick has done with himself in the interim I often guess; but shall probably make out nothing till I see him with my eyes. If there is anything I can do for him in Lancashire he might have a Letter waiting for me at Hannings: mark &#x201C;to wait&#x201D; on it. It should be off from Annan or Ecclefechan before the <date when="1837-06-17">17<hi rend="italic">th</hi> of the month</date>; or if he direct &#x201C;Care of John Welsh Esq<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, 3. Maryland Street, Liverpool,&#x201D; a day or two later might still be in time. Tell him to possess his soul in calmness; there is still no danger of him, if he stand true to himself: nothing is ever desperate for a man, nay he knows not whether it is even calamitous and not a blessing in disguise, so long as his own heart and his own head have not deserted him.&#x2014; I had a Newspaper from Jack the day before yesterday; there were two strokes indicating that he was well. Whether he meant farther <pb id="pg-09-231" n="09:231"/>to indicate that the <hi rend="italic">French Revolution</hi> sheets which I sent off had arrived, I do not know, but rather hope yes. He is to direct next time to Scotsbrig.</p>
<p>Anne Cook is to leave us on Saturday or perhaps Friday.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >She was dismissed for stealing (see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370423-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1837-04-23">23 April</date></ref>), though Carlyle told this to none of his family in Dumfriesshire in his letters.</note> There is another servant coming on Saturday;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ellen who started on <date when="1837-06-17">17 June</date>.</note> a Country girl from Northamptonshire; whom Jane has got word of thro&#x2019; the Sterlings: it is probable she too will do well enough for a season. There goes a saying here that Country girls do very well in London for nearly two years; but the terror of the place having worn off, and unwise acquaintances having been formed in that time, the Country girl finds it suitable to shift. This poor Anne is a contented good-natured soul as need be wished, and has done well enough here, considering all things. I think she would fully as soon continue in London, in some other service since not in ours; but that will not readily do. We sent her yesterday to take counsel with one Richardson,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> a very decent corporal from Annan, how she should go home: he recommends Liverpool where she has friends, which is a route without any difficulty. He was to write to her friends, and undertakes to see her under way; she speaks about going out to some Tea-people of the name of Brown<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly James Brown, tea dealer and grocer, 204 Tooley St.</note> (I think, from St. Mungo) to stay with them a day or two before departing: Richardson after Saturday will know better about her movements than we, who do not expect to see her again. I hope she will get well home again to her people, and our connexion terminate as handsomely as is needful.</p>
<p>I might scribble away here, my dear Mother, for a long time, and throw light or no-light on many things: but the essential thing seems to have been said, That I am coming to you so soon, and shall explain all by word of mouth. My pen too is very bad, and I ought to be out in the air. Farewell then my dear Mother, I hope, for only a little while! Jane&#x2019;s love is for you all and sundry, as mine is. I rejoice greatly in the blessed prospect of summer days and kind friends. <closer><salute>Ever</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>My dear Jenny,&#x2014;</salute></p>
<p>I write to-day with one of the worst of pens and in the extreme hurry of packing, to say that I am just coming off for Annandale, and shall take Lancashire in my way. I think of taking the steamboat to-morrow morning for Hull. After that, I believe we go by Leeds and then to Manchester, where I hope to find you and your Goodman well. The times and the distances after getting to Hull, as we hope on Thursday, are unknown to me. Most probably, I should think, it will be on Saturday<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1837-06-24">24 June</date>.</note> that I get to you, but it may be the day after, it may be the day before, for all is yet uncertain; nay, there is a certain Dr. Hunter<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Adam Hunter, Jane&#x2019;s second cousin. Her paternal grandmother Elizabeth and his grandfather were the children of Thomas Hunter of Tynron in upper Nithsdale. Hunter had matriculated in medicine at Edinburgh University, <date when="1812-00-00">1812</date>&#x2013;<date when="1814-00-00">14</date>, and graduated in <date when="1816-00-00">1816</date> with a thesis, &#x201C;De Cruditate.&#x201D;</note> in Leeds, a cousin of Jane&#x2019;s, with whom I may (though that is not very likely) loiter an hour or two. We shall see. We shall hope to meet all in order some how or other at last.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-09-233" n="09:233"/>Jane is to stay here till I come back, her mother keeping her company. Jane, as you perhaps know, has been very ill. She has now grown much stronger again, but still not strong enough. Her mother hastily joined us when things were at the worst in the month of <date when="1837-04-00">April</date>, and will not quit us till we get together again.</p>
<p>I am not very eminently well at present, yet neither is anything special gone wrong with me. I want rest, and mean to have that now at Scotsbrig. I have got my book completely done. I gave a course of lectures too, &#x26;c., &#x26;c., and have &#x201C;got all by&#x201D; for the present. I seem to myself to require a little while of repose as the one thing needful.</p>
<p>A newspaper came the other day from the Doctor, indicating that he was well. He is not in Rome through the Summer, but in a place called Albano, not far from Rome. He seemed to consider it as not unlikely that he might be here in <date when="1837-09-00">September</date> again. He had succeeded pretty well at Rome as a Practitioner.</p>
<p>Last time I heard from Annandale our Mother and all the rest were well. It is not very long since&#x2014;some three weeks or little more. They also reported well of you at Manchester.</p>
<p>Give my compliments to Robert. Say I mean to ask his assistance in buying a quantity of <foreign><hi rend="italic">breeches</hi></foreign>, as I pass through that huge Weaving-shop of the World. I ought to get them there better than elsewhere.</p>
<p>Let us hope, therefore, that on Saturday, or some time near before or near after that day, I shall succeed in finding you at Bank Street and finding all right.</p>
<p>I have not a moment&#x2019;s time more. Indeed, what more is there to be said at present with such a pen?</p>

<salute>Dear Mrs Welsh,</salute>
<p>I have got thus far on my journey northward, by way of Hull and Leeds, hitherto with tolerable luck, which I hope need not alter now till we are fairly over the Frith; and at rest, as Jane used to say, &#x201C;on <pb id="pg-09-234" n="09:234"/>the sunny sides of hedges,&#x201D; with Cockneydom far enough behind one. I got here to my Sister&#x2019;s last night; and, finding that there is a Packet on Tuesday afternoon, and no other right one till Friday, I must make no delay. If all go right, you will see me some time tomorrow; then after that I am yours for four and twenty hours: no doubt you will welcome the coming guest; you must also speed him that has to go. I have a package and letter for Mr Welsh, and innumerable things to ask and answer in the interim. I will try to be with you some time in the afternoon. Whether it is worth while to write announcing such an event I think may be doubtful; but my time being short and my desire not to miss you great, I do decide in the affirmative. The whirl in my head and elsewhere is so great that if I went on writing, it would be to write only nonsense; wherefore the thing needful to say being said I will here terminate for this day.</p>
<p>Jane was a good deal better; indeed almost about as well as formerly. Her Mother also was well; meant to stay with her till my return. I am loaded with compliments for all of you. My respects till tomorrow.</p>

<salute>Dear Wifie Jane,</salute>
<p>It will be about a fortnight after my departure b<supplied>[efore]</supplied> you can get this; too long a time to remain without hearing of me. I meant <supplied>[to]</supplied> write on Friday last, my first day of leisure; but Clow of Land<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370321-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1837-03-21">21 March</date></ref>.</note> came stumbling in <supplied>[breaking?]</supplied> up my forenoon; next day I was bathing at Annan by engagement: not <supplied>[till?]</supplied> this Sunday morning can I get myself postured. I have sent Newspapers, three <supplied>[or?]</supplied> so; one of which came back to Annan yesterday, tho&#x2019; there was no &#x201C;N.B.&#x201D; on it <supplied>[nor]</supplied> were there any &#x201C;two strokes&#x201D;: nevertheless I will hope that with thee there, as <supplied>[with]</supplied> me here, all is tolerably well.</p>
<p>We had a hot day and a crowded Ship that Wednesday; a voya<supplied>[ge]</supplied> would have been uncomfortable exceedingly had it not been for the excellent weather. <supplied>[Berths]</supplied> the size of a large drawer, were 5 shillings a piece; in the course of the afternoon <supplied>[a]</supplied> young tender boy <pb id="pg-09-235" n="09:235"/>who seemed to have been asleep in one of them came on deck<supplied>[. On]</supplied> his face were above a dozen bug-bites: I did not deal in the drawer-berth <supplied>[and the]</supplied> women, ladies you could have called them, lay mostly on deck, wrapt in blankets stret<supplied>[ched on?]</supplied> rugs and mattrasses [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>]; their long bonnets sticking up like the bills of birds; they them<supplied>[selves]</supplied> with their party-coloured wings all folded in this manner had a certain resembl<supplied>[ance to]</supplied> birds, and our deck to the floor of a poulterer&#x2019;s shop. I lay down several times; a<supplied>[nd suc]</supplied>ceeded in sleeping once about two minutes. I spake no word to any mortal, except <supplied>[for a]</supplied> half dozen monosyllables in answer to questions: I meditated silently, How ill-natured I had <supplied>[been, wha]</supplied>t my poor Goody might be about, &#x26;c &#x26;c; and at rare intervals smoked. The pale brandy, one half <supplied>[of]</supplied> which still survives, did me occasional good service. Do not thou ever think of coming by Hull.&#x2014; <supplied>[It]</supplied> was eight-and-twenty hours, instead of four-and-twenty when we arrived there: the Selby &#x26; Leeds <supplied>[co]</supplied>nveyance was gone some six hours; and after infinite deception, confusion and argumentation, it be<supplied>[ca]</supplied>me evident in the course of the afternoon that one must needs stay at Hull till the morrow. I wrote <supplied>[to]</supplied> Adam Hunter, with my paper lying on the binnacle of a Selby Steamer; rushed off towards the Post-<supplied>[of]</supplied>fice, begging a wafer by the way; had tribulations enough in that Hull, and the worst of all the beds I <supplied>[ev]</supplied>er slept in in this world: of all which my Goody shall hear in due season. Nevertheless by unheard <supplied>[of]</supplied> magnanimity I did not lose my peace of mind; I even slept for an hour or two, and blessed Heaven <supplied>[at]</supplied> five o&#x2019;clock that the Sun had risen again, that in two hours more I should be again upon the <supplied>[w]</supplied>ay. The Humber river or <foreign>frith</foreign> is red as blood mixed with Spanish brown, and as thick; an infern<supplied>[al]</supplied> looking river: the Selby and Leeds Railway<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Opened for passengers on <date when="1834-09-22">22 Sept. 1834</date>.</note> amused me amazingly, the day was bright, the world green: <supplied>[at]</supplied> noon, so excellently had the measures been taken, a man in laced hat spoke into the Leeds <supplied>[om]</supplied>nibus, asking for &#x201C;Mr Carlyle&#x201D;; in three minutes more I was in the Doctor&#x2019;s Gig by the Doctor&#x2019;s side, <supplied>[dri]</supplied>ving thro&#x2019; the sooty streets to his dwelling place; and nothing would serve but I must stop till the <supplied>[m]</supplied>orrow, which I with small difficulty agreed to do. He is one of the absurdest worthy men I have seen <supplied>[fo]</supplied>r a good while this Dr Adam: an obstinate pepticity, hope, health and perseverance; this seems the <supplied>[n]</supplied>ucleus of him; with froth, of self-conceit, fair-speech, palaver and <foreign><hi rend="italic">blether</hi></foreign> without limit: cunning and <supplied>[s]</supplied>implicity beautifully wedded and imbedded,&#x2014;as in Archy Dunlop&#x2019;s case: I <pb id="pg-09-236" n="09:236"/>could see well enough how <supplied>[h]</supplied>e had succeeded so well. His Wife at this time was invisible: her Father a worthy old Yorkshire <supplied>[c]</supplied>lothmaker lives in the house with them; I withdrew to his room, and found warm welcome, when I would <supplied>[co]</supplied>nsent to join him in smoking. Adam, as I heard often, is &#x201C;first Physician in Leeds,&#x201D; and making mon<supplied>[e]</supplied>y fast: he seems half distracted with Toryism; otherwise prospering as man need. His inquiries were mani<supplied>[f]</supplied>old but desultory: he was kind both from natural sociality and ostentation. He wrote you a Letter overnight, which I have here, which he read to me before sealing: it will wait very well till we get a frank; <supplied>[co]</supplied>ntaining nothing but an invitation to you and your Mother, should you ever pass that way; with request that you would be so good as convert me to Toryism; which I told him you were of all persons <supplied>[th]</supplied>e least likely to do, being yourself the deepest radical now extant; whereat he stared, hair almost standing on end, and blew out a long breath thro&#x2019; his teeth, a habit he has. Three fourths of his whole talk to me was an argumentative sermon on the necessity there was for my becoming a Tory immediately; I answered at rare intervals in a way to extinguish hope. We did very well together, and parted good friends.&#x2014; On Saturday night I was at Manchester; Rob and Jenny both at their door to welcome me. They live now on the Northern verge of the Town, a very quiet clear little placekin, where I managed extremely well till monday night. The address is 7. Bank Street, Oldfield Road, Salford, if you should chance to need it: there are no bugs, noises or incumbrances, and poor Jenny still makes chickenbroth. She had nearly died in Edge-street, she says; but has grown better every day since. On Monday night about 7, I got to Maryland street: they were, contrary to my hope, still <hi rend="italic">at</hi> dinner, with a guest called M&#x2019;Corkindale; and I, to avoid confusion, had to start and eat a kind of second dinner. All were as hospitable as ever; the <foreign>lassie</foreign> Jeannie become a young lady with golden hair; the two young men looking graver and manlier; Helen, as I thought not so radiant; the Mother perennial; your Uncle looking quiet, steady and healthier than I expected, as healthy indeed as formerly. He has put Walter to the foot of the table; he takes little; retires to bed at a reasonable hour, let the others go when they will. He has still a kind of plan for seeing Scotland this summer, but it is not fixed: I offered to go and keep him company at Templand for a few days; your Mother would give us the Key, Mary would be assiduous, &#x26;c: we laughed over it, and left it hanging: he said he aimed rather towards Moffat this year. They accompanied me to the <pb id="pg-09-237" n="09:237"/>quay next night; and so on the Wednesday morning<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1837-06-28">28 June</date>.</note> about seven o&#x2019;clock, we came <foreign><hi rend="italic">snoring</hi></foreign> [rushing] up the river Annan; moored a<supplied>[t a]</supplied> wooden jetty; and after a time I got sight of a head bowing to me, and with great joy recogn<supplied>[ised it]</supplied> to be Alick&#x2019;s. In half an hour more I was at breakfast in the house he still temporarily has in Annan; and all was well. No pleasanter journey, no less unpleasant journey, have I made these many years. My health was decidedly improved by it: my spirits, still inexpressibly sad, pointed with more and more decision to the near remedy, that of being let alone.&#x2014; So Goody has my travel&#x2019;s history.</p>
<p>Things are going on here much as I anticipated: all grown older, the old a little feebler, the young a little noisier: Jamie&#x2019;s boy<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably James, the eldest boy.</note> one of the most mischievous I ever saw, whom I am forced to take sharp measures with, and keep aloof from my premises somewhat. Alick seems still not to know what the course will be. He shudders a good deal at parting with our Mother; she, in her old age, makes piteous complaint about it: yet I think it will have to be. The Craigenputtoch speculation is as good as flung out. Alick&#x2019;s mood is sad and dispirited, as is natural: but his habits seem improved not worsened. I am extremely sorry for him; but have good hope that America will prove a free new field wherein he may prosper better than he has ever yet done. He is here with me today; came up yesterday: Grahame called yesternight, and engaged us two to dinner this afternoon. My Mother and the rest give many thanks for your Mother&#x2019;s gifts and yours: she is also &#x201C;<foreign>muckle</foreign> obliged by the bits of letters, they were o&#x2019;er short but very welcome and kind.&#x201D; She regrets much that you are not here to enjoy the quiet with me. We had a Letter from Jack<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dated <date when="1837-06-12">12 June</date> at Albano.</note> the night before last; he has some prospect of being in London in <date when="1837-09-00">September</date>: he wishes you to send him the <hi rend="italic">Guide</hi> Newspaper, I sending the <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi> too: I know not well what to do in that; but think you had better send him a N<hi rend="italic">o</hi> or two of it (tho&#x2019; under the new management)<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The new proprietors are not identified, but cf. Mineka, XIII, 614, where it is implied that Cole, the editor, and Mill had paid some debts when the paper ended in <date when="1838-04-00">April 1838</date>, indicating that there had been some continuity of editing if not of ownership.</note> till I write next: the address is D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> &#x26;c Countess of Clare&#x2019;s, Poste Restante, Rome, and must be written <hi rend="italic">very plain</hi> and large, the cover fixed with <hi rend="italic">wafers</hi> and tight: also do not forget the <hi rend="italic">two strokes</hi>, nor to me either! <pb id="pg-09-238" n="09:238"/>Ellis<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> will get you the paper: if on reading a N<hi rend="italic">o</hi> or two of it, you decidedly think it bad, give up sending it without word from me.&#x2014; Do you write daily a piece for me? I fear not. If yes, then there must be a frank-ful by this time. My poor Goody: <foreign>ach Gott!</foreign></p>
<p>I regret daily that you are not here with me, or somewhere where you could be as wholesomely situated. The greenness of these fields, the tune of that clear Scotsbrig <foreign>burn</foreign> is beauty and melody to me: I am as yet fast growing better.

Amusement or resource there is absolutely none: but one is left at peace, O heaven at peace. Tell me candidly what you yourself wish and think. Is not London far too hot for you too? I feel as if I would rather tend cattle on the wayside here, than be a potentate amid everlasting soot and din. I have read almost none; literally not above a few pages. I am going daily to Annan to bathe all next week; Jamie has a coarse little Galloway that carries me well enough: <hi rend="italic">that</hi> occupies my day in <foreign><hi rend="italic">far niente</hi></foreign> [doing nothing]. While this will last it is good for me.</p>
<p>I know not why I should not enclose this to Buller; but I somehow feel reluctant, and shall take the post.

Better days surely <hi rend="italic">are</hi> now coming for us; nameless miseries and all manner of obstruction, surely we were not doomed to them always. O why am I so cross? Why is my whole being such a perpetual fret and misery from the beginning of it even till now. Enough of this. Do thou get firmer, then stronger, lastly fatter; as thou wert doing! Perhaps the Upper Powers did not me<supplied>[a]</supplied>n to crush us down, but only to try us how much we could carry. Courage, courage ever; and march by my side. More specially still, write me directly what thou art about.&#x2014; I have Mary&#x2019;s best thanks to your Mother, my Mother&#x2019;s compliments and thanks, many thanks and last not least my own: tell her to interpret <pb id="pg-09-239" n="09:239"/>silence into the best that silence may mean<supplied>[;]</supplied> there is no room for speech here.

<salute>My dear Brother</salute>
<p>There is no larger paper within my command at present; neither indeed am I in good case for using such: I must write my straitest hand, and manage to send you most of my news in miniature. I have not written one Letter for a long time back except on sheer compulsion: my laziness, my weariness are very great; yet not perhaps the better for indulging altogether. Your Letter arrived here some three days ago. Many things are still uncertain, but somewhat seems to be settled; if we wait till all be settled, it will be like the Rustic with the River.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-02/lt-18221118-TC-JBW-01"><sic>2:208</sic><corr>TC to JBW, <date when="1822-11-18">18 Nov. 1822</date></corr></ref>.</note></p>
<p>I left London on Wednesday morning gone a fortnight<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1837-06-21">21 June</date>.</note> (this is Friday). I descended the Thames with your old boatman into the Hull Steamer: I took the 10/ set of Steamers, which I thought might be more select: it was a dreary squeeze for eight and twenty hours after all. I slept about one minute in a horizontal posture on the main hatchway, and above half an hour afterwards sitting on a folding-stool. We had to wait, after infinite jangling false-speaking and reprimanding, <pb id="pg-09-240" n="09:240"/>all night at Hull; but after that, the conveyance by river and railway was beautiful; as indeed the weather all along was of the best, and the stir with every drawback beneficial to me. A Dr Hunter, Jane&#x2019;s Cousin, was waiting for me in the <foreign>reek</foreign> and dust of Leeds; where he hospitably detained me all day: a flourishing medical man with endless perseverance, assiduity, decision and <foreign>blarney</foreign>; a medical man with the talent that leads to success. He seemed half-cracked with Anti-Radicalism; otherwise a man that did not bore me so much as seemed probable. I learned that Geordie Jeffrey<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18140618-TC-TM-01"><sic>1:15</sic><corr>TC to TM, <date when="1814-06-18">18 June 1814</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-01/lt-18150614-TC-RM-01"><sic>49</sic><corr>TC to RM, <date when="1815-06-14">14 June 1815</date></corr></ref>.</note> was prospering amazingly over about Grimsby in Lincolnshire; keeping three horses, &#x26;c: they were plaguing him about the Apothecary act.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly Jeffrey, who was not a medical graduate of Edinburgh, was acting as an unlicensed apothecary. The Apothecaries&#x2019; Society had the power to examine and license in England and Wales since an act of <date when="1815-00-00">1815</date>. The most recent Apothecary Act for regulating the practice of Apothecaries had been in <date when="1833-00-00">1833</date>.</note> On Saturday night I got to Manchester and Jenny &#x26; Rob&#x2019;s. They have now a clean little cottage in a new street on the Northwestern skirts of the town: 7. Bank street, Oldfield Road, Salford: Jenny has been better ever since they went thither; Rob, in the present commercial crisis, has withdrawn very dextrously out of his cloth-business, and restricts himself to the trade in tea. They seemed well enough together; as happy as one can expect mortals to be. He is of vulgar nature Rob; but not without shrewdness, firmness; of a hoping healthy character; likely to find himself a road in the world. On Monday afternoon I left them for Liverpool: the Steamer was to sail next evening. The Maryland Street people were in their usual way; I saw George Johnstone, hardened very much into a kind of routine man; not entertaining to me. His Mother now lives with him; he seems to flourish well rooted. He was at that very time attending poor Margaret Irving (Edward&#x2019;s Sister, Ferguson&#x2019;s Widow), who was lying at her Brother-in-law&#x2019;s house, in the extremity of incurable consumption.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >She died by <date when="1837-09-00">September</date> (see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370921-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1837-09-21">21 Sept.</date></ref>). For George Johnston, see <ref target="volume-01/lt-18200419-TC-AC-01"><sic>1:241</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1820-04-19">19 April 1820</date></corr></ref>.</note> Ah me! I saw her last a blooming young woman and wife; I remember her a merry-faced pretty <foreign>lassie</foreign> at school with me: <foreign>tempus edax rerum</foreign> [time devourer of all things]<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Ovid, <hi rend="italic">Metamorphoses</hi>, XV, 234.</note>!&#x2014; On the morrow morning (Wednesday, precisely a week after starting) about 8 o&#x2019;clock at the end of the new Jetty at Waterfoot, I at length descried a broadhatted head nodding to me, which I recognised to be Alick&#x2019;s. Ben Nelson too was waiting at the Hill End. Alick took me to his house (engaged in a <pb id="pg-09-241" n="09:241"/>vague way, just round the corner Northward from Mary&#x2019;s), where Jenny had breakfast nigh ready: we half walked half rode on a pony of Jamie&#x2019;s up to Scotsbrig in the evening; my Mother stood in the yellow light waiting for me at the corner of the Shed with Isabella and grandchildren: all, by God&#x2019;s blessing, as well as they usually are. So ended my travel hither. Jean at Dumfries is the only one I have not yet seen; but we had a line from her this morning, with all right. I have sent you off two Dumfs <hi rend="italic">Couriers</hi>, one only yesterday. The weather, after a long miserable spring, is the beautifullest I ever saw; the trees wave peaceful music in front of my window here, which is shoved up to the very top; Mother is washing in the kitchen apartment to my left; the sound of Jamie building his Peat-stack is audible; and they are stirring beat-potatoes down below. I write to you so.</p>
<p>There is nothing hitherto fixed about Alick; but this I think I can see slowly ripening out of the confused uncertainty, that he will <hi rend="italic">not</hi> go to America at present. His determination that way was at any rate of the faint sort; and the opposition my Mother makes, her tears, brokenhearted lamentings, all the sadder that she sees him not drawn but driven and going with little heart, are sufficient to extinguish the enterprise. I have said far more than I intended to say about the unwisdom, the cowardice of lying rotting here, when there is free life elsewhere: but our poor Mother answers &#x201C;All that is true, but it&#x2019;ll do nothing for me: I&#x2019;ll never see him mair.&#x201D; When I talk of weakness, she says Yes, she is grown quite old and weak, and can stand nothing: Alick I think evidently will continue in this country. His situation too is very unsatisfactory, unwholesome, to be accounted dangerous. I do not think his habits are worse, nor do I know that they are better, as to the matter of drink: but he is involved in a coil of difficulties, and could not evince to himself his resolution and his power to be free; sour internal discontent is likely to have grown, not abated, by this ineffectual project. I design next time I see him, probably this afternoon, to counsel for one thing that he altogether dismiss America from his speech and thoughts: it will be one chimera the fewer for him. Nothing can be more disagreable to me in my present mood than the consultations we hold under my arbitership; long drawn confused inconclusive colloquies, wherein no speaker evinces any fixedness of determination, and so nothing can be determined. There is life too, they all agree, here for a man that will take it up in the skilful way: but Alick&#x2019;s temper and way of operating is not favourable to him: besides he has really had ill-luck. He must even try once more; and profit by the lessons he has had. <hi rend="italic">What</hi> he will do, or how <pb id="pg-09-242" n="09:242"/>he will try, is all a problem. There are farms to let, but he views them without hope, with a kind of disgust. Jamie is quite willing to shift into Craigenputtoch at M&#x2019;Adam&#x2019;s rent: with endless reluctance I had decided accordingly to write to Mrs Welsh and secure it for him for next Whitsunday: my scheme was to ask simply that he might have the preference with the highest rent that could be got (I myself to pay what difference there might be, under hand): this was the issue of our conference on Wednesday last at Annan, where Mother also was; but on our journey homeward, late with Jamie in a cart, it turned out in answer to my question that Alick had not above half the money that would stock Scotsbrig, Jamie not a sixpence more than he would need at Puttoch! That therefore is again all at sea. On the whole, I find it will be expedient for me to hold back out of the affair as much as possible, and let it ripen silently of its own accord. A thing that a man undertakes on other than his <hi rend="italic">own</hi> resolution is apt to be ill undertaken. What I like worst in the Scotsbrig project is the air of defeatedness it has on Alick&#x2019;s part, which I fear will do him mischief. We must hope and wait. Luck changes; much is possible for a man that will be wise. Our Mother is obeyed; as she ought to be in such case, for really it seemed quite to break her down. John of Cockermouth sets out on Sunday first; I procured him an introduction to Grahame&#x2019;s Brother at New York; and recommend him to Greig, whose answer as to Alick has never come yet: I sent all off in a double-letter to Cockermouth yesterday. Clow of Land is fixed to go in <date when="1837-08-00">August</date>; has his Property advertised for sale;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Dumfries Courier</hi>, <date when="1837-06-28">28 June</date>, had an advertisement for Land as 80 imperial acres, dwelling house and steading, the sale to be in Annan, <date when="1837-07-27">27 July</date>.</note> will take five sons with him.</p>
<p>I have literally spoken to no extraneous mortal here but Grahame and Ben. G is w<supplied>[eary]</supplied> exceedingly, but friendly as ever. If I were rested I mean to call on Cressfield and Arnott,<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. William Little of Cressfield (see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18351127-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1835-11-27">27 Nov. 1835</date></ref>); Dr. Archibald Arnott (see <ref target="volume-04/lt-18270419-TC-JWCGW-01"><sic>4:218</sic><corr>TC to JWCGW, <date when="1827-04-19">19 April 1827</date></corr></ref>).</note> hardly on an<supplied>[yone,]</supplied> if even on these. My soul&#x2019;s one wish is to be left alone; to hear the rustle of the trees, the gushing of the <foreign>burn</foreign>, and lie vacant as ugly and as stupid as I like. There is soothing and healing for me in the green solitude of these simple spaces. I bless myself that the broiling horror of London is far, far. Jane has not written to me yet, but will probably this week. Her Mother ultimately volunteered to <hi rend="italic">stay with her</hi> at Chelsea till I returned or a new light rose. Jane can do very well with her, Jane being mistress of the house; otherwise it is really <pb id="pg-09-243" n="09:243"/>bad work. I have written to Jane that if she could <hi rend="italic">pig in</hi> with me, we might manage for a month between Templand and this; but I have left it to herself. This lovely peaceful weather were surely good for her; but she amuses herself in London, and does not suffer much from heat. Anne Cook is come back to Annan without outbreak on either side; a very nice Northamptonshire girl had been got (thro&#x2019; the Sterlings and Cunninghams) some days before I came away: she promised to do very well indeed; at least till London spoiled her. Anthony Sterling was gone; to Switzerland &#x26;c; he hoped to have the luck to meet you somewhere in Lombardy in the <date when="1837-08-00">end of August</date>: if he heard of Lady Clare he would make for you; he was about that time to be drawing nigh a certain port on the Adriatic whence a Steamer sails to Corfu. John Sterling was expected very shortly in London; then to return and take up his family, across the South of France, to Pisa he still says.&#x2014; It was the <foreign>Stimabile</foreign> that wrote that thing in the <hi rend="italic">Times;</hi><note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370519-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1837-05-19">19</date></ref> and <ref target="/lt-18370527-TC-MAC-01"><date when="1837-05-27">27 May</date></ref>.</note> Hunt was the <hi rend="italic">Guide</hi> writer;<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370530-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1837-05-30">30 May</date></ref>.</note> the <hi rend="italic">Spectator</hi> paragraph was by one Crawford, a hard East-Indian Scotchman, struggling always towards Parliament, whom I know slightly.<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Crawfurd (see <ref target="volume-07/lt-18341121-JWC-MAC-01"><sic>7:340</sic><corr>JWC to MAC, <date when="1834-11-21">21 Nov. 1834</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370519-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1837-05-19">19 May</date></ref>).</note> I am much mistaken if I did not send you all the <hi rend="italic">Guides</hi> that treated of me (some three); but perhaps they were lost on the way.

Perhaps he would answer, that a man&#x2019;s style, like his nose, is his own.&#x201D; They also quoted Harriet Martineau&#x2019;s praise of Carlyle in <hi rend="italic">Society in America</hi> (London, <date when="1837-00-00">1837</date>), III, 220&#x2013;21.</note> Arnott had politely sent it over to my Mother. &#x201C;A favourable review in the <hi rend="italic">Chronicle</hi>&#x201D;<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably of <hi rend="italic">The French Revolution</hi> but not found.</note> (which Grahame had heard of at Waterbeck), a &#x201C;favourable review in the L. &#x26; Westminster,&#x201D; &#x26;c &#x26;c: no one of them have I yet set eye on. I find it, at bottom, hurtful to look after the like: one has a prurient titillability in that kind; extremely despicable; which it is better wholly to steer clear of. The &#x201C;Westm<hi rend="italic">r</hi>&#x201D; Article is by Mill; I will get that at Annan and read it. The <hi rend="italic">Guide</hi> was a Paper set up by Buller and some of that set, in which Hunt was engaged as a writer: it was spreading and succeeding but did not yet pay, and their money was done; so they sold it, and a quite new management has it:<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370702-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1837-07-02">2 July</date></ref>.</note> I told <pb id="pg-09-244" n="09:244"/>Jane to send it on to you for a time or two, but to discontinue it if she found it very dull.

I was very sorry for him. One of the most harmless men; but quite unsettled <hi rend="italic">in himself;</hi> the root of all other unsettlement.</p>
<p>Paper fails altogether. Arbuckle had been heard of lately from Maranham; was well liked, doing well.&#x2014; Poor Ben Nelson seems much sadder about Edward than when the bustle of London was round him. His money affairs too are said to be bad. He always asks for you. A Letter would do no harm but good. Poor Ben.</p>

I felt an unprecedented dulness and stupidity for the last month I spent there and my excursions to Fiumicino &#x26; Tivoli gave me but a very partial and temporary relief. I went to the latter place one fine day with Wordsworth and Crabbe Robinson, and under my guidance our expedition succeeded as well as it could have done. Wordsworth was talkative, and enjoyed every thing with almost boyish heartiness. We sauntered about Adrian&#x2019;s [Hadrian&#x2019;s] villa, on this side of Tivoli, for about an hour and a half, and then at the Falls of the Anio and round by Horace&#x2019;s villa for two hours. Afterwards Wordsworth for health&#x2019;s sake, and Crabbe by way of complaisance, slept half an hour, and, when I had given the necessary orders to waiters, I established myself upon two chairs and looked on the sleepers, stretched on the mattrasses [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] of decomposed beds, with their faces upwards and mouths open, sounding along with the <foreign><hi rend="italic">praeceps</hi></foreign> [precipitous] <hi rend="italic">Anio</hi> which falls at a short distance from the <hi rend="italic">Antico Albergo della Sibilla</hi> where we were: Antonio, the head-waiter an old acquaintance of Robinson&#x2019;s, whose face reminded us all of poor Hazlitts, came punctually to rouse us from our slumbering and dreaming. He had prepared an English dinner for us, the best any of us had seen since leaving the mother land, and we had cheerful pleasant talk over it and after it, and then walked to the villa d&#x2019;Este and the ruins of Mecenas&#x2019; villa, and across olive-fields to the place where our carriage met us. Wordsworth left a much more favourable impression upon me that day than he had done on my first seeing him again. He is not really so much bound up in Toryism &#x26; Church of Englandism as I conceived him to be, and does by no means worship the gods of this world after a base fashion. The thing that strikes one most about him is his extreme narrowness. He himself is a formula; and one might live a century with him, without getting any real good of him in such times as these. Robinson came to me every day as long as they staid, and brought a welcome flood of talk, though I observed that I should soon have got tired of it. There is a limit to every thing that is <hi rend="italic">included</hi> as R. has been all his life long, and there is no possibility of admiring at second hand for any great length of time. R. seemed to have some idea of your being offended by something he had written about your article on Taylor&#x2019;s Survey of G<hi rend="italic">n</hi> Poetry, which I assured him was extremely unlikely as you were by no means apt to take offense in such trivialities, and I had never heard you speak of any such thing. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Die Anecdote &#xfc;ber Wordsworth, die Sie von Wilson geh&#xF6;rt, scheint mir unstreitbar auf gutem Grunde zu ruhen.

Far less still than Goethe can one designate Wordsworth a believer].&#x201D;</note></p></ps>

<p>The writing-every-day plan is a nonsense&#x2014;it is liking [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] mixing the whole penny-worth of milk with the coffee instead of taking only the cream&#x2014;impairing the clearness and flavour of the liquor, for sake of &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">whiteness</hi>&#x2019;&#x2014;an error which (in the case of the coffee), we have discovered and discarded, as you may perhaps remember; even amid your present affluence of cream, which might make a less reflective man than yourself forget that he is come out of scarcity and into scarcity must return.</p>
<p><foreign><hi rend="italic">Tout va bien</hi></foreign> [All goes well], here; the wind mostly in the east.&#x2014; If you ran away from heat, I can only say, the heat has surely followed you&#x2014;for we have none overmuch to complain of&#x2014;I have on all my flannels still; and the temperature has even helped me out of the dilemma I was in when you left; whether or no I should make any pretension to <hi rend="italic">mourn</hi>.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For the death of William IV on <date when="1837-06-20">20 June</date>.</note> I was going to have made a questionable sort of figure in the general blackness, when the thermometer fell to the level of <hi rend="italic">black velvet</hi>, and I &#x2018;<foreign><hi rend="italic">trat hervor glorreich</hi></foreign>&#x2019; [came forward in splendor], as black as a crow from head to foot, without the least <hi rend="italic">outlay</hi> in the world! Once or twice only I have found it more suitable to put on white but my black crucifix and a charming little black silk mantilla edged with lace, (which my Mother with her usual wisdom gave <hi rend="italic">four pounds</hi> for (as much as would have bought a new carpet)) saves my loyalty, or rather I should say my gigmanity, from reproach&#x2014;for devil a morsel of the sentiment of loyalty were discoverable, I believe, if one were to ransac<supplied>[k]</supplied> all the bombazeen and crape which makes the noble City at this moment look like a City &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">gone to the undertaker</hi>.&#x2019; Among ill bred people the talk about &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">the young queen</hi>,&#x2019; is sufficiently tiresome. The only criticism I put the least faith in is John Fergus,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Fergus of Kirkcaldy (d. <date when="1865-00-00">1865</date>).

To be sure she will! what else can a &#x2018;young queen&#x2019; do? By the way John Sterling came to me one day, in a perfect ecstasy at an article which <hi rend="italic">the <pb id="pg-09-247" n="09:247"/>Chronicle</hi> (I think) had on <hi rend="italic">you,</hi> containing this rather remarkable deliverance&#x2014;&#x201C;Whence we have great pleasure in infer<supplied>[r]</supplied>ing ourselves fully Authorised, to claim M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Thomas Carlyle as a staunch supporter of church and state&#x201D;!!!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found but possibly in the same article as William Graham had seen (see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370702-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1837-07-02">2 July</date></ref>).</note> After this one may expect to see you claimed as a staunch supporter of animal magnetism, phrenology, witchcraft even; or any thing that mankind in the <hi rend="italic">rudest age</hi> has been known to support.</p>
<p>I see none of all these criticisms&#x2014;<foreign>tant mieux</foreign> [so much the better] perhaps. I expect we shall have Sartor running the round of the journals presently: for Harriet Martineau has absolutely set up a thriving trade on that sole singular item! She has imported what Mr. Darwin calls a <hi rend="italic">houseful</hi> of copies, which she is selling off at fifty per cent! the profits (I understand) being considered as pertaining to you. One copy I have received from her <hi rend="italic">in gift!</hi> and not designing to part with it I have applied for another, on purchase, thinking you will be pleased to give one to Mr Wilson.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Wilson.</note> My own which was lent to Cavaignac, I never expect to see more of. he left it at some house from which (so far as I could make any sense of his grumbling) he had since withdrawn himself, and, &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">there is no</hi> <hi rend="small-caps">possibility</hi> <hi rend="italic">of getting it now</hi>.&#x201D; I never saw a man lose other people&#x2019;s books with such a sublime coolness. He will reply to your message himself; is to give me a letter for you next week. He came a day or two after your departure and was going to have <hi rend="italic">flared up</hi> amazingly at your going off without writing or coming when my explanation fell like oil upon his wrath&#x2014;he was here again yesterday and I showed him the line in your letter whereupon he grumbled unintelligibilities and finished off with the proposal to write&#x2014;<foreign>Madame ma <hi rend="italic">Mere</hi></foreign><note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Julie Cavaignac.</note>&#x2014;was here too, one day last week! actually had screwed up her energies to the pitch of paying a visit to the Fergu<supplied>[s]</supplied>es and myself! the Ferguses! what do the Ferguses know about her!

One day that Elizabeth took me an airing she asked if there was anyone I wished to call on&#x2014;I told her yes&#x2014;Madame Cavaignac&#x2014;and then entered a little into the history of her misfortunes&#x2014;nothing more was necessary to make Elizabeth the devoted of Madame&#x2014; She <pb id="pg-09-248" n="09:248"/>went in with me&#x2014;we made a sort of Sabine rape of her, carried her up and down <foreign><hi rend="italic">in carrozza</hi></foreign> [in a carriage] showed her the National Gallery&#x2014;overwhelmed her with our <foreign><hi rend="italic">gentilezza</hi></foreign> [kindness]. And repeatedly since has the Angelica Elizabeth gone alone or with sisters<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jessie; no other mention of more sisters has been found.</note> and subjected the bewildered Madame to the same process of being amused! All which attention has so far gained on her, that she finds Elizabeth (C tells me) &#x201C;a good enough woman; not entirely destitute of sense&#x201D;&#x2014; Surely &#x2018;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Ma Mere</hi></foreign>&#x2019; and <hi rend="italic">you</hi> have learned to praise in the same school!</p>
<p>I have been very quiet all last week, to get rid of the snifters I caught in the Sterling&#x2019;s carriage&#x2014;(which is gone back to the coachmaker&#x2019;s, on my representation that it blew a hurricane in it in the calmest weather)<supplied>[.]</supplied> My care however seemed to be doing no good so last Wednesday night I indulged in a concert (as I could get it) and there I suppose the cold was fairly stewed out of me&#x2014;for next morning I awoke quite free of it.

<salute>My dear Jenny,&#x2014;</salute>
<p>According to promise, I set about writing you a word of Scotch news, now that I am fairly settled here and know how things are. The railway train whirled me away from you rapidly that evening. Next evening, about the same hour, we were getting out of Liverpool harbour, and on the following morning, between seven and eight o&#x2019;clock, I had got my eye upon Alick waving to me from the end of the Jetty at Annan. It is almost three weeks now that I have been here and found all well, but it was only the day before yesterday that we got our first visit to Dumfries made out, and could rightly report about matters there. I fancied a newspaper with two strokes would communicate the substance of what was to be said in the interim.</p>
<p>There has been a good deal of discussion about Alick and his going to America. He himself seemed of mind to go, but not very strongly or hopefully set on it. Our Mother, again, was resolute against it, and made such a lamenting as was sufficient to dishearten <pb id="pg-09-253" n="09:253"/>one more inclined than he. So now I think it seems fixed so far as that he <hi rend="italic">will not go</hi>. What he is to do here one does not so well see, but it will evidently be a great point gained for him that he give up thinking about departure, and direct his whole industry to ascertaining how he can manage here where he is. Men of far less wit than he do contrive to manage, when once they have set their heart on it. Jamie is quite ready to go to Puttock and give up Scotsbrig to him, but I still rather think there will nothing come of that; nay, some think Alick himself does not at bottom wish that, but is satisfied with finding Jamie so far ready to accommodate him and keep him at home. He seems very tranquil, cheerfuller than he was and altogether steady; likelier to have a little fair luck than he was a while ago. He must persist where he is. There is nothing that can prosper without perseverance. Perseverance will make many a thing turn out well that looked ill enough once. John of Cockermouth is gone off to America about a fortnight ago with all his family. I got him a letter from Burnswark to a brother of his at New York.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Graham.</note> I doubt not he will do well. Clow of Land has his property advertised for sale; means to be off about the <date when="1837-08-00">end of August</date>, which also I reckon prudent. With two or three thousand pounds in his pocket and four or five strong sons at his back, a man may make a figure in America. James Austin and Mary were at one time talking of America, but they also have given it up.</p>
<p>We had a letter from the Doctor shortly after my arrival here. He is well, living at Albano, a summer residence some twenty miles from Rome. He speaks of it being possible, or probable, that he may get back to England in <date when="1837-09-00">September</date>, but it is not certain. He will be pretty sure to come by Manchester and you if he come Northward. The rest, as I have already hinted, are all well and following their usual course. Jamie and his wife and two sons go along very briskly. His crops look well. He had his Peat-stack up (and mother&#x2019;s little one beside it) and his hay mown, though the late rains and thunder have retarded that a little. The country never looked beautifuller in my remembrance, green and leafy; the air is fresh, and all things smiling and rejoicing and growing. Austin is busy enough now with work. He had a bad time of it in spring, when horse provender was so dear. The children are well,&#x2014;even the eldest looks better than I expected,&#x2014;and Mary, their mother, seems hearty and thrifty. I mentioned that we had been at Dumfries. Alick took up our Mother and me on <pb id="pg-09-254" n="09:254"/>Friday last in a rough &#x201C;Dandycart&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A kind of spring cart.</note> of Mrs. Scott&#x2019;s with a beast of Jamie&#x2019;s. One of the first questions my Mother asked of Jean was, &#x201C;Hast thou had any word from Jenny?&#x201D; To which the answer was &#x201C;No.&#x201D; Jean&#x2019;s child is running about quite brisk, though a little thinner than it once was; from teeth, I suppose. James Aitken has plenty of work, three or four journeymen. In short, they seem doing well. Finally, Jamie (Maister Cairlill) authorizes me to report that he this day met with a brother of thy Robert&#x2019;s, who said that the <foreign>Peat-knowes</foreign> [peat-mounds] too were all well. The day after my arrival here I fell in with William Hanning, the father,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of Robert, Janet&#x2019;s husband.</note> on Middlebie Brae, measuring some Dykes, I think, with a son of Pottsfowns.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> He looked as well as I have seen him do. The same man as ever, though he must be much older than he once was. The tea parcel was forwarded to him, or sent for, by my desire, that same night.</p>
<p>Our good Mother here is quite well in health; indeed, as well every way as one could expect, though doubtless she is a little lonelier now than when you were with her. She complains of nothing, but does her endeavour to make the best of all things. She wishes you &#x201C;to write very soon and tell her how the world is serving you.&#x201D; She would have sent a word or two to that effect in her own hand, she says, but &#x201C;having a good clerk&#x201D; (me, namely) &#x201C;she does not need.&#x201D; I am to confirm her promise of coming with me when I return southward, and staying till you tire of her. There was word from Jane on Sunday gone a week. She wrote in haste, but at great length, and seemed very cheerful. She will not come hither this time, I think. Her mother is to return home about the end of this month. Jane appears quite prepared to stay by herself. She has some friends yonder whom she is much with, and she rather likes the treat. Mrs. Welsh expects Liverpool people with her to Templand, and can stay no longer.</p>
<p>I have ended my paper, dear Jenny, and given one of the meagrest outlines of our news. You will see, however, that nothing is going wrong with us; that we are thinking of you and desirous to hear from you. Be a good <foreign>bairn</foreign> and a good wife, and help your Goodman faithfully in all honest things. He is a thrifty fellow with a good whole heart. There is no danger of him. Help one another. Be good to one another. God&#x2019;s blessing with you both. All here salute you.</p>

<salute>My Dear Mill,</salute>
<p>An obliging Neighbour had, on failure of the Simpkin-and-Marshal conveyance,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Booksellers and publishers, 4 Stationers&#x2019; Court, Ludgate St., through whom Mill had also sent Carlyle books in the Craigenputtoch years.</note> sent me up your Review<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <hi rend="italic">The French Revolution, London and Westminster Review</hi>, <date when="1837-07-00">July</date>.</note> from Annan: on Friday last the Copy intended for me, with your Letter in it, got to hand, by way of Edinburgh. My Wife says, &#x201C;He did not send it to <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, the careless wretch&#x201D;;&#x2014;but seems nevertheless to have made good amends, in an oblique way. Indisputably the careless wretch has gratified all friends of mine.</p>
<p>No man, I think, need wish to be better reviewed. You have said openly of my poor Book what I durst not myself dream of it, but should have liked to dream had I dared. It is a courageous Article; carries its right to speak on the face of it; and speaks <hi rend="italic">so</hi>. Innumerable dissonant small-deer of Newspaper columns must feel the wind struck out of them thereby, and keep silence or change their note. What good a Criticism can do to a Book may be considered as done. To a Book or to an Author: for I have literally not read any other Criticism at all, and even heard little of them; and consider myself well off indeed. Jane reports to me of Heraud<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably in Jane&#x2019;s second letter of <date when="1837-07-00">July</date>, not found. Heraud&#x2019;s review was in <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine</hi>, XVI (<date when="1837-07-00">July 1837</date>), 85&#x2013;104. In his letter of <date when="1837-06-30">30 June</date>, Mill had said: &#x201C;He labours a good deal to prove, that you are very like him, &#x26; therefore very good; but that you want something of being entirely like him, &#x26; therefore are not altogether perfect; &#x26; towards the end he prophecies for you &#x26; other writers in Fraser (apparently himself) present neglect &#x26; future undying fame&#x201D; (Mineka, XII, 339&#x2013;40).</note> quite as you do, &#x201C;a shrill sound of Glory to Heraud in the Highest&#x201D; which forced her to break down in the middle without likelihood of resuming. He is to me, that poor Heraud, one of the disagreeablest mortals going. Related somehow to whatsoever is highest, but only as a hateful parody of it: as an Ape is related to a Man. Such products also Nature has felt bound to evolve. And yet withal it is a most kindly product; full of hope (sure &#x201C;to rise again on sunday&#x201D;), of sociality, loquacity and a kind of happiness: were it not so, it had ere this been trait-waistcoated hard and fast in St Luke&#x2019;s. Let us leave him dedicating Epics to the <pb id="pg-09-256" n="09:256"/>Creator,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340521-TC-JWC-01"><sic>7:175</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1834-05-21">21 May 1834</date></corr></ref>.</note> at &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">A</hi>-Highgate&#x201D; or elsewhere; dead on friday, but sure to rise again on sunday.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mill had added: &#x201C;There is in Heraud a placid disregard of contemporary opinion, which would be greatness if he were not so <hi rend="italic">quite</hi> sure of living for ever. But now he reminds one of the dying penitent&#x2019;s answer to his confessor who proposed to him, as a motive for patience, the example of Christ: &#x2018;<foreign>Ah, mon p&#xE8;re, quand J. C. mourut le vendredi, il savait bien qu&#x2019;il resusciterait le dimanche</foreign> [Ah, father, when J. C. died on Friday, he knew well he would rise again on Sunday].&#x2019;&#x201D; Heraud was a devout Coleridgean and cherished as a shrine the Gillman home at Highgate where Coleridge had spent the last years of his life.</note>&#x2014; On the whole I find it to be a very sad thing this of writing Books. I can very well understand how old Clergymen and such like, as I have known them, after working for forty years at some Commentary on the Revelations, have finished it, and then in few weeks gone mad, and died. As for me, I do not mean to do that; but, on the whole, I find no health except in driving the useless rubbish and all that is said of it as much as possible out of my head. Half a dozen reviews like yours even would tend to do me incalculable mischief: I should have to say, as the Dumfries Weaver did when they made him Deacon of the Weavers, and drank his health, &#x201C;Gentlemen, consider that I am still but a man.&#x201D; If one knew where on Earth or under it there was Rest to be had,&#x2014;O Rest, Rest!&#x2014;one would fly thither and stay there.</p>
<p>I like the rest of this Review Number tolerably well. Bulwer does what he can;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Bulwer had contributed &#x201C;The Works of Thomas Gray&#x201D; and &#x201C;The Letters of Charles Lamb,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">London and Westminster Review</hi>, XXVII (<date when="1837-07-00">July 1837</date>), 1&#x2013;16 and 229&#x2013;43. Mill had remarked to Leigh Hunt on <date when="1837-07-07">7 July</date>, &#x201C;I now wish that you had written an article for us on Lamb, instead of Bulwer, who has done it very little to my liking&#x201D; (Mineka, XII, 341).</note> in the right direction; and, as you said, &#x201C;more than one expects.&#x201D; There is nothing absolutely false or bad that one falls in with in any of the Articles. Buller on the Pickwick business surprised me by speaking of Smollett; I fear that is loose speaking, but I have sent for the Pickwick on the faith of it, and will see.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Buller had reviewed <hi rend="italic">Sketches by Boz, The Posthumous Papers of the Pickwick Club</hi>, and the first six numbers of <hi rend="italic">Bentley&#x2019;s Miscellany</hi> in which appeared the first half of <hi rend="italic">Oliver Twist</hi>. He had said of Dickens that &#x201C;the renown of Fielding and Smollett is that to which he should aspire, and labour to emulate, and, if possible, to surpass&#x201D; (p. 213).</note> An intelligent kind of youth in Dumfries expressed his amazement that &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">this</hi> Review,&#x201D; as he reverently named it, had taken notice of Pickwick at all. I wish you would get Sterling to do something, if you could find the fit thing. This is not <hi rend="italic">right</hi> Radicalism yet; tho&#x2019; indeed what in the world is right! There is no right Radical in the company if it be not yourself, and perhaps still more <hi rend="italic">my</hi>self. &#x201C;<foreign>Je ne trouve que moi qui aie <pb id="pg-09-257" n="09:257"/>toujours raison; faut avouer, ma ch&#xE8;re</foreign> [I never find anyone but myself who is always right; one has to say so, my dear],&#x201D; said the Duchess de la Fert&#xE9;,<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Marie-Th&#xE9;r&#xE8;se Geoffrin, Marquise de la Fert&#xE9;-Imbault (<date when="1715-00-00">1715</date>&#x2013;<date when="1791-00-00">91</date>), literary hostess and opponent of the Encyclopedists.</note> &#x201C;<foreign>personne que moi</foreign> [no one but me]!&#x201D; Occasionally-erroneous Radicalism, like other things, must struggle on. By the bye, does not Fonblanque too seem to <hi rend="italic">have</hi> culminated? I find no free fighter for the truth in him, so much as a <foreign>soldado</foreign> [soldier] for the Durham-and-Melbourne Concern.<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John George Lambton, first Earl of Durham (<date when="1792-00-00">1792</date>&#x2013;<date when="1840-00-00">1840</date>), M.P. for Durham, <date when="1813-00-00">1813</date>&#x2013;<date when="1828-00-00">28</date>. He had helped in preparing the <date when="1832-00-00">1832</date> Reform Bill, and was identified with the radical section of the Whigs. He became first Earl of Durham, <date when="1833-00-00">1833</date>, ambassador to St. Petersburg, <date when="1835-00-00">1835</date>&#x2013;<date when="1837-00-00">37</date>, and high commissioner in Canada (with Buller as an assistant) in <date when="1838-00-00">1838</date>, but resigned in the same year when his policies were criticised at home. Melbourne had been urged to introduce Durham to the Cabinet &#x201C;as proof of a better tendency&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">London and Westminster Review</hi>, quoted in the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, <date when="1837-06-25">25 June</date>). Durham had written a letter, <date when="1837-07-08">8 July</date>, to the electors of Durham, extensively published in the press, e.g., <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, <date when="1837-07-13">13 July</date>, <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, <date when="1837-07-16">16 July</date>. Fonblanque had two leading articles in the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, <date when="1837-07-02">2</date> and <date when="1837-07-16">16 July</date>, in support of Durham: &#x201C;none more prompt and resolute in vindicating the rights of the people; and none more ready fearlessly to rebuke and restrain their errors and excesses.&#x201D; However Melbourne ignored all this advice and left him out of Victoria&#x2019;s first Cabinet.</note> Has he <hi rend="italic">got</hi> what he could carry, then? Every man has his limits: Hitherto shalt thou come; so much of evil and of good fortune shalt thou stand unlamed, but no more! As the Scotch Preachers say: &#x201C;I hope better things, tho&#x2019; I thus speak.&#x201D;</p>
<p>It gives me real satisfaction to learn that you will publish a Book.<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">A System of Logic, Ratiocinative and Inductive, being a connected view of the Principles of Evidence and the Methods of Scientific Investigation</hi>, 2 vols. (London, <date when="1843-00-00">1843</date>).</note> It seems impossible that you should publish on any subject however artificial without illustrating innumerable things that are natural and perennial; of interest to all sincere men. In writing a Book you will get far more of your general mind uttered than in a series of Articles of equal length. I will read your Treatise on Logic with an attentive expectation which no other man&#x2019;s could give me; nor all other men&#x2019;s on a matter I am growing so estranged from. If we had a week&#x2019;s time to talk, there were much to be said of Logic between us! I call it the &#x201C;Art of telling other men <hi rend="italic">what</hi> you believe<supplied>[.&#x201D;]</supplied> Whether our Aristotle fashion of it, is, in <hi rend="italic">any</hi> province except Euclid&#x2019;s Geometry, the best or even the good method: herein I suspect we should have many things to argue. But in the meanwhile write, I say earnestly; write, print, and let me read. To get thoroughly master of a subject; or even, if it so prove (as with me and French Revolution perhaps), to deliver oneself altogether from it, there is no plan like writing a Book <pb id="pg-09-258" n="09:258"/>on it. At any rate, what rule has one except to write on the thing he knows about, has somewhat to say about?<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In replying to Carlyle on <date when="1837-08-08">8 Aug.</date>, Mill said: &#x201C;You call Logic the art of telling others what you believe. I call it, the art, not certainly of knowing things, but of knowing whether you know them or not: not of finding out the truth, but of deciding whether it is the truth that you have found out. Of course I do not think that Logic suffices for this without any thing else. I believe in spectacles, but I think eyes necessary too. Neither do I mean by Logic, the Aristotelian way solely, or even mainly; nay, <hi rend="italic">that</hi> I <hi rend="italic">do</hi> consider to be only a way of stating a process of thought, not itself a process of thought at all&#x201D; (Mineka, XII, 347).</note></p>
<p>I can give you no account of my doings here; for in very truth they are a Do-<hi rend="italic">nothing</hi>. I lounge about the green places, look at the waving of the trees, the gushing of the clear <foreign><hi rend="italic">burns</hi></foreign>; myself the placidest, saddest of men. Nothing more <hi rend="italic">ghost</hi>-like, I fancy, dwells on the Earth at present. It is a sadness not the painfullest yet I do think the deepest I have ever known in the world. Yet I feel it to be healthy, the natural return to a kind of health. In time and Silence surely I shall grow better. All speech, if it be not the voice of the Solway tide-waves or of these summer winds, is more or less an offence to me. I could say with Job: Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O my friends!<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Job 19:21.</note> Or better it might be: Have patience with me, have patience with me.</p>
<p>My dear Mill, this is not worth twopence this Letter, and I have not a frank in this time of dissolution. Put up with it, I pray you; in hope of improved times. The Good Heavens will be merciful to me. Take my thanks, hearty as they well may be, for all the good I have got of you first and last. <closer><salute>Pity me, farewell, and love me. Yours ever</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>Many thanks, my dear <foreign>Bairn</foreign>,</salute> for thy two long lively Letters; the faithful reflex of that Cockneyland Phantasmagory, all glittering and whirling with changeful sights and sounds, from Opera <foreign>soirees</foreign> [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] to Madhouse cells; in which, however, this one satisfactory fact evinces itself, That my poor Jeannie is tolerably well in it, and enjoys herself a little there. Poor Bechetti, poor Pepoli, poor everybody! <pb id="pg-09-259" n="09:259"/><foreign><hi rend="italic">Sauve</hi></foreign> [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] <foreign><hi rend="italic">mari magno</hi></foreign>.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Lucretius, <hi rend="italic">De Rerum Natura</hi>, 2, 1: &#x201C;how pleasant it is, when over a great sea the winds trouble the waters, to gaze from the land upon another&#x2019;s great tribulation!&#x201D; Carlyle had misread Bechetti for Rossetti; see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370717-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC [<date when="1837-07-17">17 July</date>]</ref>.</note> I, sitting here on the safe brink, have not had two gladder hours than those thy two franks gave me. It is a pity, and perhaps not a pity, that so lively a pen did not turn itself to writing of Books? My <hi rend="italic">coagitor</hi> too might become a distinguished female. Nay, after all, who knows? But perhaps we are better as we are. &#x201C;Probably just as well.&#x201D;</p>
<p>I know not why, did pure utilitarian intellect rule us, I should write a Letter today; a Newspaper and two strokes, to indicate from the bottom of my ditch, that nothing is wrong with me; and a third, if that were at any time needful, to indicate that I do with my whole soul &#x201C;wish you well&#x201D;: this really is the amount of all that with quires of paper I could write. I am doing nothing, witnessing nothing. My stupidity is great, my sadness, my tranquillity. Nothing more ghostlike diversifies anywhere the green surface of July in this world. But yet if to anybody on Earth then surely to thee its partner of good and evil does the poor worn-out soul of me turn. I will clatter and croak with thee for an hour, as the hour yields. They say, I am growing better, looking better; I do believe it is a kind of road towards betterness that I am travelling: <hi rend="italic">this</hi> is the sum of all my news.</p>
<p>Your first Letter came on a Sunday night. An old teacher of mine,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Rev. John Johnstone, Jr.</note> the first teacher I had, the son of the venerable old man that baptised me, was preaching at Ecclefechan that night: my Mother had gone, I not; she returned with the Letter. The preacher in person, along with one David Hope of Glasgow a Kinsman of his,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Elsewhere Carlyle notes that David Hope was a nephew of Adam Hope, his teacher at Annan (e.g., <ref target="volume-01/lt-18210130-TC-JAC-01"><sic>1:319</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1821-01-30">30 Jan. 1821</date></corr></ref>).</note> called one evening; I returned in from an unearthly walk on the moor after sunset, and found them: fat, loquacious, full of good cheer; they interested me considerably for about an hour. Graham<supplied>[e]</supplied> has almost given up plaguing me: I positively refuse to go, and be bored and prove a bore; my sole ambition is to be let alone. Very generally the history of my day is somewhat thus: Breakfast shortly after such hour as I awake at (any time from seven to nine); shaving, dawdling, reading, smoking, till dinner about two or three; a ride on a little violent walking pony of Jamie&#x2019;s, oftenest to the top of Blaweary<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> (you remember the road to Catlinns), where I have the benefit of <pb id="pg-09-260" n="09:260"/>total solitude, and a prospect of wide miles of earth sea and air; then tea; suceeded again by dawdling, smoking, reading and clatter till porridge come and el<supplied>[e]</supplied>ven o&#x2019;clock and sleep. No man need <hi rend="italic">do less</hi>. The weather in general is noble, verging of late towards rain and thunder; but with sunbursts that Poussin or Claude<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Nicolas Poussin (<date when="1594-00-00">1594</date>&#x2013;<date when="1665-00-00">1665</date>), French historical painter in the classical manner, and Claude Lorrain (<date when="1600-00-00">1600</date>&#x2013;<date when="1682-00-00">82</date>), French landscape painter.</note> might profit by. I cannot be said to <hi rend="italic">think</hi> of anything; I merely look and drowsily muse. When tide and weather serve (as yesterday) I ride down to bathe: poor Nelson is much sadder about his son than when we saw him; he is always extremely kind, but also rather tiresome. Alick or Mary gets me up some victuals; I smoke a pipe, and amble home again. At Annan I one day did make out the call on Mrs Irving;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edward Irving&#x2019;s mother.</note> she, her Daughter and Son-in-law,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert and Janet Dickson (see <ref target="volume-03/lt-18240625-TC-AC-01"><sic>3:94</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1824-06-25">25 June 1824</date></corr></ref>).</note> all Dicksondom, were at home: a most melancholy wreck. Poor Margaret (Mrs Ferguson), a widow these two years, is dying at Liverpool in the house of a Brother-in-law. Dickson&#x2019;s eyes have been operated on again; he sees a little with one of them: the old woman is broken down into a chaos of gossip, impertinent curiosity, tears, clatter and confusion. Embarrassment and rigour looks from the once bright eyes of Mrs Dickson: ah me! I also fell in with Waugh yesterday: he stood for an hour looking over the steamboat Jetty; motionless, perhaps occasionally spitting into the tide. When I spoke to him his words were hardly intelligible for the ornamental <hi rend="italic">lisp;</hi> which seems to have aggravated itself much: he is publishing a new theory of human life or the nervous system at three and sixpence (<hi rend="italic">thickthpenth-a</hi>):<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Science of the Cerebro-Spinal Phenomena attempted</hi> (London, [printed in Annan], <date when="1838-00-00">1838</date>); cf. <ref target="volume-08/lt-18351006-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1835-10-06">6 Oct. 1835</date></ref>.</note> I left him to his fate in a minute or two. One evening, I rode in by Dr Arnott&#x2019;s: he was sitting with a face like the setting Sun; quite private over a tumbler of Glenlivet,<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A malt whisky from George Smith&#x2019;s distillery at Upper Drumin, Glenlivet, legally set up in <date when="1824-00-00">1824</date>.</note> his new gravel-walks silent and weedy; a blank Immensity all round him; very dull, very kind. Old Cressfield, my Father&#x2019;s last surviving friend, I have not got to yet; but will by some favourable tide.&#x2014; On friday last we made out Dumfries for the first time: a &#x201C;dandy-cart,&#x201D; one of Jamie&#x2019;s horses, and Alick to drive my Mother and me; the finest evening in the world; I silent as the yellow sunlight, not unhappy. Jean and her James are <foreign>huggermuggering</foreign> along not unprosperously; rational sufficient people both; Jean, I always say, excepting <pb id="pg-09-261" n="09:261"/>only another <hi rend="italic">Jean</hi>, is the woman of most natural faculty I know. Also you <hi rend="italic">can</hi> tell whether she is a leddy or a gentleman.<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ann Cook&#x2019;s phrase about Fanny Kemble; see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18361229-TC-JCA-01">TC to JCA, <date when="1836-12-29">29 Dec. 1836</date></ref>.</note> We did not get off till Sunday evening; I, even then, having to take the sin on me. These are the only two nights I have been out of this bed. M&#x2019;Diarmid was new-shaved, clear, and not drunken-like; poured out on the floods of jargon about electioneering and the like; unprofitable highly. His wife is the same drawling victim of sensibility; &#x201C;expects you to dinner then&#x201D;; but does not attain you. Mac&#x2019;s best, indeed only good news was that he had rescued your Puttoch-game pin-money,<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The money due Jane for giving shooting rights at Craigenputtoch.</note> tho&#x2019; Clarke sits in jail a bankrupt:<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not recorded in the <hi rend="italic">Dumfries Courier</hi>.</note> clever indeed; Mac had taken Madeira for it. He was going to pay; but did not, the Clerk having gone out: I shall have to call again. He has a fresh advertisement in this week&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Courier;</hi> hopes to let the game this year at a higher rent: his charge of commission is 5 per cent; he seems to think it no favour, tho&#x2019; it is one. Aird too I found, tho&#x2019; with difficulty. He is not succeeding I think in any way. His mouth stood twisted into helpless-looking curvature; he was growing grey on the temples: my presence seemed to give him a moment of pleasure; he spoke of Heraud&#x2019;s Review; expected the Westminster: neither he nor Mac had got their copies of the Book; Aird was to send and seek. The last word M&#x2019;Diarmid spoke to me was from the top of the stairs, &#x201C;Now if you&#x2019;ve anything to write you know&#x201D; (with a knowing glance), &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">I</hi>&#x2019;ll publish!&#x201D; What on Earth can the man mean, thought I, as I walked away: not till next morning did it grow clear that he meant me to review <hi rend="italic">myself</hi> in that widely circulating Journal of his. <foreign>Ach Gott im Himmel!</foreign>&#x2014; Of Mrs Richardson he could tell me nothing, except that she was still in her old place: Oliver<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably Mrs <sic>Caroline</sic><corr>Catherine E.</corr> Richardson&#x2019;s son.</note> he had recommended to a contributorship in Chamber&#x2019;s Journal, and some other still thinner thing which I have forgot. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Requiescant</hi></foreign> [Let them rest]! Thou shalt hear no more of them this day. Mrs Crichton&#x2019;s Madhouse is nearly built, and looks very beautiful; one haven at least open!<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Crichton Institution, on 45 acres 1&#xBD; miles SSE of Dumfries, was a &#x201C;lunatic asylum for affluent patients&#x201D; being built by Elizabeth Crichton on a bequest of &#xa3;100,000 left by her husband Dr. James Crichton of Friars Carse. It opened in <date when="1839-00-00">1839</date>.</note></p>
<p>Alick&#x2019;s American speculation, after a good deal of discussion upon it, had to be given up and abolished from speech. My Mother sank silent when the affirmative had been decided on; did nothing but <pb id="pg-09-262" n="09:262"/>sigh and sit silent, with ejaculations of &#x201C;I&#x2019;ll never see him mair&#x201D;: she owned to me when I remonstrated, &#x201C;I&#x2019;m grown old and weak; I have not long to live.&#x201D; Alick&#x2019;s own heart was faintly resolved, not drawn by hope but driven by ill luck. I was forced to say, Let there be no more speech of it then. Jamie professes his entire readiness, nay almost a kind of wish, to go to Craigenputtoch at M&#x2019;Adam&#x2019;s rent; he thinks it a decidedly cheaper place than this! Alick again, with an angry glance of his eye, was &#x201C;convinced he could do in Scotsbrig.&#x201D; Short of saving my Mother&#x2019;s life there is nothing that shall induce me to put finger again in that unblessed quagmire of things; but in case of extremity I have schemed out a proposal I can make to your Mother; it is &#x201C;a small request,&#x201D; or rather it is no request at all: but even this I hope to keep clear of, and maintain the <hi rend="italic">silence</hi> I have prescribed for myself. Silence alone is wholesome for me on that matter.&#x2014; In the mean time Alick <supplied>[is]</supplied> steadier in his habits than formerly; and having now cut himself off from America, may perhaps be able to <supplied>[find]</supplied> some other course here, by persevering in which he may save himself. I have seldom been sorrier for any man. But what can I do for him? Yesterday when I went down to bathe, I found suddenly that he was off to Liverpool, he and another man a kind of Merchant in Annan; Jenny did not know well for what. It was in waiting for a glimpse of them that I saw Waugh spitting into the tide. After long waiting, I got eye on Alick; found that it was for the Herring-fishery he was bound; the other man possesses a sloop, now at Liverpool; they were to take a cargo of salt there, then exchange it for a cargo of salted herrings on the Western shores; Alick to be Captain of the enterprise; not to return for three weeks! I could only grasp the poor fellow&#x2019;s hand, and pray God that it might be the beginning of better things for him. <hi rend="italic"><foreign>Ay de mi!</foreign></hi> these are hard things to be borne by men in this world. I think Alick&#x2019;s dispiritment is almost equal to mine; and he poor fellow has nothing to shew for it; not even a F. Revolution; nothing but long years of toil and chagrin and the traces they have ploughed in his own soul. Yet even now I do not despair of him, for he is good stuff. His and Mary&#x2019;s remembrances of you are particularly affectionate: I cannot kiss any children; but I told them you had bid me do it. Anne Cook arrived about a week after me: she declared she &#x201C;would go to serve you again to any length if she should <hi rend="italic">die by the road</hi>.&#x201D; The greatcoat cape is safe. I spoke to An<hi rend="italic">e</hi> one day; tell all people merely that &#x201C;her term was done.&#x201D; What a blessing that new Ellen must be to you; like a new Broom, sweeping clean!&#x2014;ah me the Paper, the Paper!&#x2014; Cavaignac has not <pb id="pg-09-263" n="09:263"/>written, nor I think will not.<note n="15" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cavaignac wrote on <date when="1837-07-24">24 July</date>.</note> I will send him a Newspaper. What an absurdity that about <hi rend="italic">Teufel</hi>k!<note n="16" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370717-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, <date when="1837-07-17">17 July</date></ref>.</note> And is it finished off in that way? Methink one ought to say that the Book is specially valuable to us, and had better be got <hi rend="italic">back</hi>. I have written a short dull Letter to Mill; my only one since I got here, yours excepted. The Dumfries Mill-Parcel failed; but Nelson sent me the Review from Annan: it is good as good need be for my share in it; I told Mill so, and that I thanked him from the bottom of my ditch, and begged to be left in repose. His Dumfries Parcel <hi rend="italic">had</hi> come before that, and a Letter in it; all about the Book, the Book: otherwise I should hardly have written, tho it was my duty. He has been very <hi rend="italic">courageous</hi>, I think; and cannot but do good.&#x2014; I wish you had been a little more minute about John Sterling: it was a melancholy tense for me that of the verb &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">came</hi>,&#x201D; which you used; from which I gathered that he had left London! I was just about writing to him; to him alone of men. From Clifton, whatever he may be doing there, I shall perhaps hear from himself.&#x2014; The Liverpool people (your Uncle, I think) send me a Newspaper now and then. Your Mother will be home still about the <date when="1837-08-00">beginning of August</date>? I think if you <hi rend="italic">could</hi> then get away into the country a little with Mrs Sterling, it would be a very pretty arrangement indeed: about the time of your return, I might be thinking of returning; and so from opposite directions we might get h<supplied>[old?]</supplied> of one another again; and so and so <foreign>niente</foreign> [nothing]. O thou [word obscured]! In any case and all cases, take care of thyself; grow stronger, as I try to do. Perhaps the times are mending for us; <foreign>esperance</foreign>, courage!&#x2014; This is the dullest sad Letter I ever wrote; let its very dulness be proof of my &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">wish</hi> to send.&#x201D; write soon, write soon.

<salute>My dear Jean,</salute>
<p>James Austin is here today, helping Jamie with his hay, and has brought my Mother a cartload of peats; there will be an opportunity by him of sending back the Boxes, and with them a little Book-parcel I wrapt up for you at Annan: I write you a line or two to go and accompany them. There was no right chance, or I would have written to you last Tuesday night.</p>
<p>We got very handsomely home that Sunday afternoon; driving the rain literally before us; for the trees were all dripping when we got to Hoddam, and it still rained over in the Eastward. Hot tea, speedily prepared, set us all right; and none of us had caught hurt from our jaunt. The glass was all whole; next day Alick and I with infinite caution and effort got it all puttied in; where it now stands, we hope for a long while. The pipes had perished, about a half of them; the other half sore frittered about the edges, reduced to half their original dimensions. &#x201C;It is probably just as well&#x201D;; they are of a sort of clay I do not like much; they will serve at the rate of one per day till I get others. Thursday morning was the first time I got the bathing tried again; so wet had the weather proved; I packed the American Book<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James had asked for a copy of N. L. Frothingham&#x2019;s review of <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi> for himself (see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370321-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1837-03-21">21 March</date></ref>, and <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370402-TC-JCA-01">TC to JCA, <date when="1837-04-02">2 April</date></ref>).</note> for you then, which I hope you now <hi rend="italic">will</hi> get. Considerable difficulty of communication exists here, in this busy time; we have a small <foreign>Lassie</foreign> that goes on <hi rend="italic">wet</hi> days for a penny; on other days, her Mother being at hay and she <foreign><hi rend="italic">trysted</hi></foreign> [entrusted] with children to keep, we are at the mercy of favourable accident.</p>
<p>On my return that Thursday night I found your wicker kit all arrived safe. Thomas Carlyle&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Pickwick</hi>,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">The Pickwick Papers</hi> appeared in monthly numbers from <date when="1836-04-00">April 1836</date> to <date when="1837-11-00">Nov. 1837</date>. Carlyle had borrowed one of them from his cousin, Thomas Carlyle (see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18351021-TC-HI-01">TC to HI, <date when="1835-10-21">21 Oct. 1835</date></ref>).</note> which also I now return read, was brought to us next day. Thank him for it; and say he may send the others if he can: completer <hi rend="italic">dud</hi> exists not in Nature; but in <pb id="pg-09-265" n="09:265"/>my present transcendent state of idleness it is in place if ever. The <hi rend="italic">Athenaeum</hi> you sent Thomas will unfortunately never get back: Isabella and my Mother had read in your Letter &#x201C;you need not <hi rend="small-caps">return</hi> it&#x201D;; whereupon we, doing just judgement on a mean <foreign><hi rend="italic">messin</hi></foreign> [cur] of an enemy such as said <hi rend="italic">Athenaeum</hi> seemed,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly the <hi rend="italic">Athenaeum</hi> of <date when="1837-05-20">20 May</date> with its hostile review of <hi rend="italic">The French Revolution</hi> (see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370530-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1837-05-30">30 May</date></ref>).</note> straightway&#x2014;boiled the kettle with it, and it existed no more! On looking myself at your Letter shortly after, I was shocked to discover very legible these words, &#x201C;you need not <hi rend="small-caps">burn</hi> it&#x201D;! But the evil was done.&#x2014; For the rest, our Mother&#x2019;s Boddice, I am charged to say, fitted and fits extremely well. I can also testify that the black Carlisle Loaf is the agreeablest Bread I have eaten for months; my thanks to you for it; and for the white one, which tho&#x2019; of the old unexceptionable quality I leave to my Mother. They are not two-thirds done yet: further, you must not send any more till we speak: Mary has sent up a cargo of Poor-Will loaves<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unexplained.</note> this day; and we are like to be <hi rend="italic">mouldy</hi> even as we are. Next week very probably you may receive an application.</p>
<p>On Friday I went back again to Annan: on my arrival I was amazed to find Alick just on the wing for Liverpool with Jamie Ewart. Jamie has a sloop; they two were to go together, get a cargo of salt for said sloop which was expected to be lying ready there: Alick with the cargo of salt was then to go on board, if the expedition on inquiry seemed promising, and proceed therewith to the western Coast where the Herring-fishery is going on; there selling his Salt and buying their Herrings, he was to do the best he could; and expected to be back with the venture finished in some thre<supplied>[e]</supplied> week<supplied>[s]</supplied> hence. Ewart was to be back on Tuesday (tomorrow) night: if Alick be not with him, it will be a sign that they have judged the <supplied>[spec]</supplied>ulation good, and that we shall probably not hear of Alick till the time I mention. He seemed anxious at setting out; he was very unhappy staying at home: I sincerely wish it may be the beginning of a new kind of luck and occupation for him. God grant it, poor fellow! There is plenty of business here, I believe, for one far less shifty than he; but his temper is sore, his heart is not hopeful towards such things: he must become more patient; above all, he must <hi rend="italic">persist</hi> and persevere, there is nothing to be done without that. Of America as I think there will now be no more mention.</p>
<p>My Mother is very brisk; has been working all afternoon in the Hayfield. She and Austin are both here; fetching and carrying, packing <pb id="pg-09-266" n="09:266"/>and consulting: in this room, writing has become as nearly as may be impossible, even were the Paper <hi rend="italic">not</hi> done.&#x2014; Send the <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi> with one stroke on it, if you receive all right. Nay stop: there is still another thing about shirt-collars. It seems you have a special talent for cutting out shirt-collars, with the top part of them all stitched according to one thread. Well here is a piece of cloth; here too is a collar that fits very well: will you cut as many as it will be; and give them out to some semstress with clean fingers: beautiful collars will be the result. You do not make the <hi rend="italic">lugs</hi> of them <hi rend="italic">longer</hi> than this model, otherwise they hang, like swine-lugs.</p> 
<p>I had a Letter again from Jane. She reports and indicates all to be well. Mrs Welsh I conjecture to be coming about the end of the month as she purposed.&#x2014;When I shall be at Dumfries? Dear Jean, I know not; but it will not be long. My kind regards to the two Jameses, the speaking and the silent. May they both and all of you prosper and increase. I have not a moment for more; nor time to read this over, if it be readable. <closer><salute>Your affectionate Brother,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Sterling,</salute>
<p>Every time the Boy, these last two weeks, has returned from the village Post-office, I have looked expectantly for some trace of your handwriting; but there comes none.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sterling had written from Knightsbridge on <date when="1837-07-25">25 July</date>, but Carlyle had not yet received the letter.</note> I may well say, it was one of my greatest regrets in quitting Babylon when I did, that I was not to meet with you there. Alas, there are so few people one cares to meet anywhere, so few whose speech is not a jargon and an affliction to one! Where are you, my good Friend? Is it appointed that you return over seas without seeing me, depart and make no sign? My Wife writes of you copiously, but in the lyrical rather than the historical style; except these notices of hers I have none; and indeed can have <pb id="pg-09-267" n="09:267"/>none, having ceased in these weeks to write Letters to any mortal. I know you are not at Knightsbridge, but at some one of the sundry &#x201C;Cliftons&#x201D; there are in this Isle: pray tell me which of them, what your humour and position is, what your plans are.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sterling was planning visits to Clifton, near Bristol, to South Wales where he had lived as a child, to Oxford, and to Brighton.</note> I would right gladly see you, and would even make an active effort that way, impossible as effort seems at present. At all events write me a Letter or Line, specifying your orbit for the next weeks, and where the minimum of distance and impediment between us may be expected to lie. I dare not promise to myself that I will <hi rend="italic">do</hi> anything considerable in consequence of knowing; but I should like to know it. The sum of the matter is, write if you have any time for such a thing; if not, behold I have asked you to do it; you shall live well and voyage well, remembering me as one by whom you are always like to be remembered.</p>
<p>And now having stated this, I ought to consider my actual enterprise complete. To write of myself, which is the only subject in this quarter, were at present one of the saddest Essays on <hi rend="italic">Nothing;</hi> unprofitable to do, distressing to see done. <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;Silence&#x201D;:</hi> to how many thousand things in this world of ours, in this life of mine, is that the only word I can utter without fault! In fact, I have thoughts some day of writing one of the powerfullest discourses I can on <hi rend="italic">Silence:</hi> all speech, even a seraph&#x2019;s, is a triviality compared with it; our age has <hi rend="italic">entirely</hi> lost feeling of it, or all but entirely, and is become empty, and of the nature of a drum; &#x26;c, &#x26;c: all this I have had thoughts of writing; how much more in my present interlunar condition ought I to practice it! There is no idler, sadder, quieter, more <hi rend="italic">ghost</hi>like man in the world even now than I. Most weary, flat, stale<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi>, I, ii.</note> seem to me all the electioneerings and screechings and jibberings that the Earth is filled with, in these or indeed in any days. Men&#x2019;s very sorrows, and the tear one&#x2019;s heart weeps when the eye is dry, what is in that either? In an hour, will not Death shake it all still again?&#x2014; Nevertheless the old Brook, Middlebie Burn we call it, still leaps into i<supplied>[t]</supplied>s &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Caudron</hi></foreign>&#x201D; here, gushes clear as crystal thro&#x2019; the chasms and <foreign>dingles</foreign> of its &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Linn</hi></foreign>&#x201D;; singing me a song, with slight variations of score these several thousand years; a song better for me than Pasta&#x2019;s!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370717-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, <date when="1837-07-17">17 July</date></ref>.</note> I look on the sapphire of St Bees Head and the Solway mirror from the gable-window; I ride to the top of <hi rend="italic">Blaweary</hi> and see all round from Ettrick Pen to <pb id="pg-09-268" n="09:268"/>Helvellyn, from Tyndale and Northumberland to Cairnsmuir and Ayrshire: <foreign><hi rend="italic">voir c&#x2019;est avoir</hi></foreign> [to see is to possess]: a brave old Earth, after all;&#x2014;in which, as above said, I am content to acquiesce without quarrel, and at lowest hold my peace. It is what one ought to do. One night, late, I rode thro&#x2019; the village where I was born. The old &#x201C;Kirkyard Tree,&#x201D; a huge old gnarled ash, was rustling itself softly against the great Twilight in the North; a star or two looked out; and the old graves were all there, and my Father&#x2019;s and my Sister&#x2019;s: and God was above us all. I really, as I said, have no words to speak.</p>
<p>I read little or nothing, hear of little or nothing. I brought M&#xfc;ller&#x2019;s History (<hi rend="italic">Schweizerischen Eidgenossenschaft</hi>) with me: a work of endless research, of great talent; but unsuitable for me; unedifying, with its high Tacitus-philosophy and classicality, not without a touch of pedantry. I am still in the third volume. On the other hand, I did read&#x2014;Pickwick! what of it I could get; one whole day; Buller having recommended it in the <hi rend="italic">Review</hi>.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370718-TC-JSM-01">TC to JSM, <date when="1837-07-18">18 July</date></ref>.</note> Thinner wash, with perceptible vestige of a flavour in it here and there, was never offered to the human palate: I will henceforth call Buller not the worst critic in Britain, but a critic whom I will not be led by. On the whole, however, is it not to be considered that I, for instance, did read Pickwick, and have not yet read Johannes von M&#xfc;ller? I sat almost a whole day reading it. Ought there not to be Books of that kind? It is not certain <hi rend="italic">Yes;</hi> and yet not certain <hi rend="italic">No:</hi> the Turks endeavour &#x201C;to combine exercise with total passivity of indolence&#x201D;; the human constitution has many wants. <foreign>Requiescat</foreign> [Let rest] Pickwick!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I am for Annan this afternoon, whither I sometimes go seabathing; I am sure of the ride at all events: your Letter can go in my pocket; by steam or horse-power, I calculate, it will find you out, and bring a welcome response to me. I have seen nothing of Blackwood<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <date when="1837-07-00">July</date> issue of <hi rend="italic">Blackwood&#x2019;s</hi> with Sterling&#x2019;s &#x201C;Crystals from a Cavern&#x201D; (see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370608-TC-JOST-01">TC to <sic>JS</sic><corr>JOST</corr>, <date when="1837-06-08">9 [8] June</date></ref>).</note> or the verses which my Wife pronounces beautiful.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370717-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, <date when="1837-07-17">17 July</date></ref>.</note> Tell me what you are doing: for I suppose <hi rend="italic">it</hi> to be something.

<salute>Dearest</salute>
<p>I sit down to write to you in a considerable draft, and in rather low spirits; both of which conditions are induced by one and the same cause: I am on the eve of a great journey&#x2014;very great indeed; to judge from the preparations and talk about it&#x2014;and with a sublimity of uncertainty over its details and ultimate issues which gives it, to my excitable imagination, very much the air of a voyage into a Future State.&#x2014; If I consulted only my inclination in the matter, I should decidely adhere to the <hi rend="italic">Present State,</hi> which I know,&#x2014;can calculate the good and evil of,&#x2014;and, to a certain extent, predict the result of&#x2014;but the general sentiment being so strongly in favour of <hi rend="italic">a change of air</hi> for longer or shorter, for better or for worse, and my grounds of opposition so inconclusive to every mind except my own; I have succumbed for once in my life to the force of public opinion, not without a secret misgiving that I shall find cause to repent my complaisance.</p>
<p>On Saturday morning then, the auspices having been duly taken and every rite performed with a <foreign><hi rend="italic">romor&#xE9;</hi></foreign> [noise] that mocks description; we start,&#x2014;the Inevitable,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Another nickname for Edward Sterling.</note>&#x2014;Mrs Sterling,&#x2014;and myself,&#x2014;in &#x201C;the handsomest carriage in all London,&#x201D; with a months provision of clothes, and <hi rend="italic">five</hi> country-maps in cases! From the purchase of so much geographical furtherance, as well as from the talk about people and places that are to be visited; you would infer that we are going on <hi rend="italic">a Tour,</hi> an enterprise which for one with my small gift of travelling seems little short of madness. But then again, we carry the chessmen with us, and&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">Il Principe of Machiavelli!</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >(Rome, <date when="1532-00-00">1532</date>).</note> with Italian grammars and dictionaries, by help of which (and thro the interposition of divine <pb id="pg-09-270" n="09:270"/>Providence) it is proposed that I should enliven <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;our retirement at Malvern&#x201D;</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >8&#xBD; miles SW of Worcester.</note> in transforming <hi rend="italic">the Thunderer of the Times</hi> into an Italian <foreign><hi rend="italic">Tortorella</hi></foreign> [turtle dove]!

And as for him one can only account for his eagerness in the cause by supposing him bewitched&#x2014;given over, for the punishment of his political sins at the age of sixty five, into the hands of the deepest Radical young woman that lives, who leads him the life of a dog!</p>
<p>That I might give you even this much half-certainty as to my movements, is one reason of my delay in answering your dear letter; <pb id="pg-09-271" n="09:271"/>another is to be found in the circumstance that no frank was procurable till after the <date when="1837-08-04">4th of August</date><note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Because of the General Election.</note>&#x2014; And it is so much more agreeable to me, to write in the &#x201C;flow on thou shining river-fashion&#x201D;<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> than with the concentration of Tacitus or of the Author of the French Revolution&#x2014;</p>
<p>Apropos of <hi rend="italic">the French Revolution;</hi> I have read Thacker<supplied>[a]</supplied>y&#x2019;s article in proof<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, <date when="1837-08-03">3 Aug.</date> Presumably Sterling had given her the proofs before publication.</note>&#x2014;and as Tommy Burns<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> said of Eliza Stodart&#x2019;s leg&#x2014;&#x201C;it&#x2019;s nae great tings&#x201D;! so small a <hi rend="italic">ting</hi> indeed that <hi rend="italic">one</hi> barrel of the Inevitable-Gun may be decidedly said to have missed fire&#x2014; He cannot boast of having, in any good sense, &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">served Thacker</hi><supplied>[<hi rend="italic">a</hi>]</supplied><hi rend="italic">y</hi>&#x201D; however he may have &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">served Carlyle</hi>.&#x201D; When you consider that this is Thacker<supplied>[a]</supplied>y&#x2019;s <foreign><hi rend="italic">coup d&#x2019;essai</hi></foreign> [first attempt], in his new part of political renegade,<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >To the radical cause. Thackeray considered himself a radical at this time and had helped Charles Buller in his <date when="1832-00-00">1832</date> election at Liskeard. His stepfather Henry Carmichael Smyth (<date when="1780-00-00">1780</date>&#x2013;<date when="1861-00-00">1861</date>) part owned <hi rend="italic">The Constitutional and Public Ledger</hi>, <date when="1836-09-00">Sept. 1836</date> to <date when="1837-07-00">July 1837</date>, a radical newspaper which employed Thackeray as its Paris correspondent until he returned to London in <date when="1837-03-00">March</date>. He had met the Sterlings through his wife Isabella Shawe (<date when="1818-00-00">1818</date>&#x2013;<date when="1893-00-00">93</date>). Edward Sterling had introduced him to Thomas Barnes, editor of the conservative <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, and Thackeray&#x2019;s criticism of <hi rend="italic">The French Revolution</hi> was the first of many contributions. Jane may be referring not only to the conservatism of Barnes and the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> but also to Thackeray&#x2019;s concluding three paragraphs where he offers stern advice to English republicans: the &#x201C;hottest Radical&#x201D; should take note from the French Revolution that &#x201C;the authority &#x2026; by which he retains his head on his shoulders and his money in his pocket&#x201D; is &#x201C;more necessary for him even than his mad liberty.&#x201D; America&#x2019;s republic survived only because there was no hunger: &#x201C;People America like England, and the poor weak rickety republic is jostled to death in the crowd.&#x201D;</note> you will however make some allowance for the strange mixture of bluster and platitude which you will find in his two Columns,<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The three-column article consisted of about two columns of criticism and one of quotation. Jane is unfair to Thackeray, whose review was friendly, well-intentioned, and balanced, though slightly mocking the book&#x2019;s most ardent supporters. He sums it up as: &#x201C;written in an eccentric prose, here and there disfigured by grotesque conceits and images; but, for all this, it betrays most extraordinary powers&#x2014;learning, observation, and humour. Above all, it has no CANT.

<salute>My dear Mill,</salute>
<p>Your Letter,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In his letter of <date when="1837-08-08">8 Aug.</date> Mill had asked Carlyle for his letter of <date when="1833-11-25">25 Nov. 1833</date> (see <ref target="volume-07/lt-18331217-TC-JSM-01"><sic>7:53&#x2013;54</sic><corr>TC to JSM, <date when="1833-12-17">17 Dec. 1833</date></corr></ref>) for the &#x201C;freshness of my impressions&#x201D; of Armand Carrel to use in his article on Carrel, <hi rend="italic">London and Westminster Review</hi>, XXVIII (<date when="1837-10-00">Oct. 1837</date>), 66&#x2013;111.</note> which I remember well, does almost indubitably exist, safe in some repository about Chelsea; but so far as I can see it will be impossible to get hold of it, at least for some four weeks. My Wife, who has charge of all these things, is just gone with the Sterlings to Malvern: I do not, till she write again, yet know her precise address; but I fear at any rate there would be little use in applying to her; for the thing will be locked up somewhere, in some involution of security penetrable only to herself. It is very unlucky. I remember you spoke of Carrel&#x2019;s air of sincerity, of his precise determinate character, of a certain mild tone of dogmatism noticeable in his manner (like me, you said); for the rest, how <hi rend="italic">practical</hi> he was, exclusively devoted to his <foreign><hi rend="italic">metier de journaliste</hi></foreign>, so unlike the speculative Cavaignac and other Frenchmen in this respect. On the whole you gave me pretty much the notion of him that his medal did when <pb id="pg-09-276" n="09:276"/>I looked at it long afterwards. I do not think there was very much more in your account than I have here given. I doubt it will be all that we can recover for the present.</p>
<p>Your Letter has just come to hand at this late hour of 11 p.m.; and as I am bound for Nithsdale tomorrow early, not to return for two days, I write you this in great haste, rather than write nothing for so long.</p>
<p>I rejoice to hear that the Book<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370718-TC-JSM-01">TC to JSM, <date when="1837-07-18">18 July</date></ref>.</note> prospers according to your mind. Go on <foreign><hi rend="italic">getrosten muthes</hi></foreign> [cheerfully]. We shall see where we differ as you say; and find, I doubt not, that there is a very broad ground of agreement between us if we go deep enough to seek it. I suspect our present difference is a partially accidental one, originating in a twist of my own. I am conscious of a kind of semi-unreasonable aversion to <hi rend="italic">spectacles</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370718-TC-JSM-01">TC to JSM, <date when="1837-07-18">18 July</date></ref>.</note> altogether, of a kind of practical unbelief in spectacles. Multiplied errors that had well nigh killed me (this is literal truth) got into my hand by spectacles; on dashing the spectacles off, I found that it was all false, and that I was still alive. On the other hand, hardly any truth that I set much store by has happened to come to me by way of spectacles. Hence my feeling that way in part. Nevertheless I know withal that there are or might be spectacles. I am curious to hear what <hi rend="italic">you</hi> say they should be, and how one may help his eyesight with them; I will read you even with interest and profit.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> critique did get hither; it is a helpful friendly sort of thing. I cannot get the Book swept out of my head nearly so clean as I should wish. What good is now in it for me? But the Future is all so blank, really aimless (so far as this world goes) and as it were both hopeless and fearless, one turns into the Past and fractions of it cling to one. I look upon the curse of all curses that man bears in this world to be self-conceit: how often does one cry bitterly to be delivered from it; and yet it is ineradicable; cut it down <supplied>[as]</supplied> you will or as others will for you, it springs eternal. The <foreign>mythus</foreign> of Lucifer<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The patristic and poetic myth of Satan&#x2019;s pride.</note> is one of the wisest ever conceived. <foreign>Ach Gott!</foreign>&#x2014;</p>
<p>My Brother brings news from the village how there is a talk of Sir James Grahame&#x2019;s<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sir James Graham (<date when="1792-00-00">1792</date>&#x2013;<date when="1861-00-00">1861</date>), a landowner in Cumberland, had been returned as a liberal for Carlisle in <date when="1826-00-00">1826</date>, against the influence of Lord Lonsdale. From <date when="1827-00-00">1827</date> he had been a reforming M.P. for Cumberland. First Lord of the Admiralty, <date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>, he resigned office in <date when="1834-00-00">1834</date>, and from <date when="1835-00-00">1835</date> was increasingly identified with the Tories and denounced as a renegade (e.g. <hi rend="italic">Globe</hi>, <date when="1837-08-05">5 Aug.</date>). He was ultimately welcomed back as M.P. for Cumberland in <date when="1852-00-00">1852</date>.</note> coming over to this County, Hope Johnstone <pb id="pg-09-277" n="09:277"/>(just elected amid hisses) resigning in his favour;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >He did not take the place of Hope Johnstone who had just retained Dumfries County, but a seat was found for him in Pembroke in <date when="1838-00-00">1838</date>.</note> how in that case Ewart of Liverpool<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Ewart (<date when="1798-00-00">1798</date>&#x2013;<date when="1869-00-00">1869</date>), radical M.P. for Liverpool since <date when="1831-00-00">1831</date> had just been defeated by the Tory Sir Cresswell Cresswell (<date when="1794-00-00">1794</date>&#x2013;<date when="1863-00-00">1863</date>). He became M.P. for Wigan, <date when="1839-00-00">1839</date>, and in <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date> replaced General Sharp as M.P. for Dumfries Burghs. He later opposed capital punishment and proposed examination entrance for the civil service, the army, and the diplomatic service, and the opening of free public museums, galleries, and libraries.</note> will be started against him, and an immense explosion will take place. Poor Sir James has got himself beaten in Cumberland as well as heart could wish.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Graham had been thoroughly defeated by Francis Aglionby, formerly Yates, (<date when="1780-00-00">1780</date>&#x2013;<date when="1840-00-00">1840</date>) of Nunnery who retained the seat until his death, and William James (<date when="1791-00-00">1791</date>&#x2013;<date when="1861-00-00">1861</date>) of Barrock Lodge who had been M.P. for Carlisle, <date when="1820-00-00">1820</date>&#x2013;<date when="1826-00-00">26</date>, and was M.P. for E. Cumberland, <date when="1836-00-00">1836</date>&#x2013;<date when="1847-00-00">47</date>. Both were reformers.</note> He would have stout resistance here too: but we have no <hi rend="italic">statesmen</hi> (estates-men) as Cumberland has; and Buccleugh&#x2019;s tenants are all at rack rent.<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably Carlyle thought Walter Francis, 5th Duke of Buccleuch and 7th Duke of Queensberry (<date when="1806-00-00">1806</date>&#x2013;<date when="1884-00-00">84</date>) could influence his tenants&#x2019; voting more effectively.</note> Whether Ewart or Sir James be intrinsically the shabbier mortal one would not undertake to say. I will tell M&#x2019;Diarmid tomorrow to propose Peyronet Thomson, I think.<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Perronet Thompson (see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18321016-TC-JSM-01"><sic>6:239</sic><corr>TC to JSM, <date when="1832-10-16">16 Oct. 1832</date></corr></ref>), who had been defeated at Maidstone on <date when="1837-07-27">27 July</date> by Wyndham Lewis and Benjamin Disraeli, both Conservatives.</note> Sir James&#x2019;s defeat yielded me a perceptible pleasure; and yet now, poor fellow, I am almost sorry for him, so signal was it.</p>
<p>When I leave this solitude is not certain; but perhaps it will not be many weeks. I was thinking of Switzerland had my Brother been returning; however he now writes me that that is unlikely. I feel decidedly better, tho&#x2019; sad as ever. A Letter from you especially a long thick-written Letter will be very gratifying if your time allow. <closer><salute>Good night my dear Mill.&#x2014;Yours always</salute></closer> <name>T.

Honourable members are such <foreign><hi rend="italic">rari aves</hi></foreign> [rare birds] here as yet, that even Mr. Gibson<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Gibson; cf. <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350817-TC-JCA-01">TC to JCA, [<date when="1835-08-17">17 Aug. 1835</date>]</ref>.</note> could not get me a common <pb id="pg-09-278" n="09:278"/>frank; so I was constrained to address myself to <hi rend="italic">the Government</hi>. On the faith that it is all right I shall take up the thread of narration where I broke off at Chelsea; under no very comfortable circumstances, for my head was so bad that I had to go to bed three times while writing that letter, tho&#x2019; I would not tell you so <hi rend="italic">then</hi> for fear of making you anxious. By the way it is a great <foreign><hi rend="italic">sottise</hi></foreign> [stupidity] that of the <hi rend="italic">two strokes</hi> on the newspaper&#x2014;the less one is <hi rend="italic">all well</hi> the more careful one is that no want of strokes shall let the truth be suspected; it is when one is well enough to be taking no thought of wellness or illness that the strokes are apt to be forgotten.</p>
<p><foreign>Allons donc</foreign> [Let&#x2019;s go on then]! my run-away husband&#x2014;On Monday (being the <date when="1837-08-07">7th of August 1837</date>) I arose and put on clean raiment, and having for the hundredth time recommended to Ellen my roses and silver spoons, and myself to the Great disposer of all, I seated myself beside Mr. and Mrs. Sterling in their new carriage, with much the same sensations as I might have felt beside Mr. and Mrs. Graham in their new balloon;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mr. and Mrs. Graham had ascended from Rosemary-branch Gardens, Islington, on <date when="1837-07-31">31 July</date> and landed at Ilford, Essex. Mrs. Graham had also made an ascent, her thirty-third, with Mrs Adams and Miss Dean from Hackney on <date when="1837-08-07">7 Aug.</date></note> to drive wheresoever the wind listed, and be landed where it should please the pigs: so great was the horror of doubt and fluctuation which involved our whole expedition to my thinking! The same day however, about eight in the evening, we actually gained Oxford as proposed; and descended <foreign><hi rend="italic">&#x2018;da carroza&#x2019;</hi></foreign> [from the carriage] less fatigued and more pleased with our day&#x2019;s-work than <hi rend="italic">&#x2018;I as one solitary individual&#x2019;</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle&#x2019;s father&#x2019;s phrase.</note> had anticipated.&#x2014;On my life, there is <hi rend="italic">&#x2018;a fund of vitality&#x2019;</hi> in that man, which covereth a multitude of sins. What a taste he still has for <hi rend="italic">&#x2018;innocent pleasures&#x2019;!</hi> I, who at half his age have already exhausted all that, can do nothing but stare at his preternatural effervescences and raptures.&#x2014; <hi rend="italic">The Angel Inn,</hi> where we staid at Oxford, gave me a rather unpleasant impression of the <hi rend="italic">tone</hi> of that place (for travellers always get very decided and of course infallible impressions of places from the Inns where they eat or sleep)&#x2014;not that the bread butter <foreign>et cetera</foreign> was not first rate, and the silver forks in &#x2018;good&#x2019; style: what disgusted me was to observe in every bed room, <hi rend="italic">laid before the looking glass, a bible</hi> and <hi rend="italic">book of prayers</hi> with a small hassock underneath (and this preparation I was told was universal thro&#x2019; all the Inns at Oxford) <hi rend="italic">my</hi> particular hassock (of green cloth) had a drawing printed on it, which I was at pains to examine&#x2014;it represented a sportsman (for consistency&#x2019;s sake <pb id="pg-09-279" n="09:279"/>let us hope <hi rend="italic">a parson</hi>) in the midst of a stubble field taking aim at three birds which he could not fail to hit, the tips of their wings being touching the muzzle of his gun! Moreover the Waiters, all large elderly men, had a sort of &#x2019;mazed abstractedness and sad gravity of look which gave one a notion they must have some time or other been unsuccessful graduates: while the maids <hi rend="italic">my-adied</hi> at us at such a rate, and made their reverences so profoundly that the free Breton-blood rushed to my face in very shame for them&#x2014; From all which I inferred that Oxford was a place much under the domination of Cant&#x2014;Cant in its two most killing shapes, of <hi rend="italic">Religion</hi> that <hi rend="italic">keeps its hassock</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Respectability</hi> that <hi rend="italic">keeps its gig</hi>.</p>
<p>The Colleges however, which we saw the best part of during Tuesday forenoon under the guidance of Jacobson, interested me beyond measure&#x2014;not only as being a splendid memorial of past ages but as shaping for me into actual stone and mortar, and painted glass, and illuminated manuscripts and square-capp&#x2019;d blackgowned figures <foreign>et cetera</foreign>, the vague notions I had gathered in my girlhood, out of novels and histories, of a Great English University.&#x2014; But nothing of all that I saw gave me so lively an emotion of pleasure as&#x2014;a very small thing indeed&#x2014;neither more nor less than <hi rend="italic">Guy Fox&#x2019;s Lantern</hi><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Guy Fawkes (<date when="1570-00-00">1570</date>&#x2013;<date when="1606-00-00">1606</date>), conspirator in the Gunpowder Plot, <date when="1604-00-00">1604</date>&#x2013;<date when="1605-00-00">5</date>, to blow up the Houses of Parliament. His lantern (in the Ashmolean Museum since <date when="1887-00-00">1887</date>) was in the Picture Gallery, now the Upper Reading Room, at the Bodleian.</note> preserved under a glass case! and what gave Mr. Sterling the liveliest emotion of <hi rend="italic">dis</hi>pleasure, was a question I addressed, with no ill intention but in pure unsophisticated curiosity, to the gentleman who showed us the Bodleian Picture Gallery, <foreign>viz</foreign>: &#x2018;how came it that I saw no picture of Oliver Cromwell there, seeing that they had raked together so many insignificant persons of his time?&#x2019;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The question was peculiarly tactless as Oxford was still self-consciously royalist and high church.</note> A broad stare was all the answer I received to this natural enquiry, from which the gentleman&#x2019;s features did not relax so long as I remained in his company. I hope he is now more at ease. There were also many gloriously illuminated manuscripts shown me, which I could have spent much more time in looking at than Mr. Sterling would allow&#x2014;especially a Plato and Tacitus&#x2014;and a greek testament bound in solid silver having a carved ivory Monk in relief on one side and on the other a Greek inscription purporting the &#x2018;that Maker thereof particularly wished God would bless himself and his family.&#x2019;&#x2014;And there was Queen Elizabeth&#x2019;s Latin exercise-book (putting me very <pb id="pg-09-280" n="09:280"/>much in mind of my own) along side of Tippo Saib&#x2019;s gold-lettered <hi rend="italic">Koran!</hi><note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Tipu or Tippoo Sahib (<date when="1753-00-00">1753</date>&#x2013;<date when="1799-00-00">99</date>), sultan of Mysore, fought the British in India till his death in battle.</note> But I should need more sheets than one to enumerate all the curiosities and niceties I saw.</p>
<p>With all its magnificence it seems to me that the Bodleian Library must be a most perverse place to study in; for this reason above all, that the numerous private libraries left to it in donation, of which it is chiefly composed, are and <hi rend="italic">must be</hi> kept <hi rend="italic">apart</hi> and <hi rend="italic">entire;</hi> so that instead of <hi rend="italic">one</hi> great Library arranged under general heads, you have as it were a great many little libraries arranged under one general roof. They told me the inconvenience of this was obviated by the perfection of the catalogues to which I can only say the perfection of the <hi rend="italic">catalogues</hi> must be much beyond the perfection of the <hi rend="italic">Librarians</hi>. One of whom, grown grey in the service, I made as red as a lobster with asking him simple questions which he could nowise answer.</p>
<p>On the Afternoon of the same day we visited Blenheim where amidst much that was note-worthy I remarked most note-worthy of all, and a sort of epitome of the whole, two pictures hung on the same wall,&#x2014;the one, Old Sarah<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sarah Churchill, <foreign>n&#xE9;e</foreign> Jennings, first Duchess of Marlborough (<date when="1660-00-00">1660</date>&#x2013;<date when="1744-00-00">1744</date>), from <date when="1683-00-00">1683</date> to <date when="1708-00-00">1708</date>&#x2013;<date when="1710-00-00">10</date> a close friend of Queen Anne, but after their estrangement she lived in lonely and quarrelsome retirement. It could have been one of the two portraits by Kneller.</note> in her loneliness and her pride,&#x2014;the other Miss Glover in&#x2014;her blue satin! (Miss Glover, for to be sure you do not know it, being a trashy actress&#x2019;s daughter,<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Julia Glover (<date when="1779-00-00">1779</date>&#x2013;<date when="1850-00-00">1850</date>), a respected established actress, had two daughters; one, Miss P.

About <date when="1860-00-00">1860</date> there was a portrait &#x201C;of a Lady, by an unknown Artist&#x201D; in the Gallery at Blenheim which is possibly the one Jane refers to.</note> at present officiating as Mistress to his grace of Marlborough,<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Spencer, fifth Duke of Marlborough (<date when="1766-00-00">1766</date>&#x2013;<date when="1840-00-00">1840</date>).</note> a man of Seventy with a wife<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Susan Stewart (d. <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>), second daughter of the Earl of Galloway, married since <date when="1791-00-00">1791</date>.</note> living in London) I could not but wish that a picture might have spoken for once, and the beautiful termagant might have there and then opened her tinkler-jaw<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-01/lt-18200419-TC-AC-01"><sic>1:240</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1820-04-19">19 April 1820</date></corr></ref>.</note> on that trumpery damsel, and asked her in the Devil&#x2019;s name what <hi rend="italic">she</hi> was doing in <hi rend="italic">her</hi> Blenheim as <hi rend="italic">&#x2018;one of the family&#x2019;</hi> (to use our Cicerone&#x2019;s delicate phraseology)?&#x2014;but so is it ever, pride before destruction&#x2014;the haughty spirit before a fall!&#x2014;We slept that night at a country Inn near Burford some sixteen miles on the other side of Blenheim, and proceeded hither, next <pb id="pg-09-281" n="09:281"/>day, by Cheltenham and Tewksbury (not without poking into every crevice of the old church at the latter place)&#x2014;across the Severn (a marvellously clear flowing river for England) and so thro&#x2019; a country as full as it could cram of apple-orchards growing on the greenest sward,&#x2014;patches of the yellowest corn,&#x2014;thatched homesteads up to the knees in hollyhocks,&#x2014;and all soft, sweet, picturesque objects, which Nature in her profusion could be suffered to have flung together. For Malvern itself, it only half pleases me&#x2014;the situation is magnificent, it stands a little way up on a hill or hills, from the top of which you see over <hi rend="italic">ten</hi> counties, and the window of our sitting-room commands the richest, most extensive prospect I ever saw with my eyes&#x2014;but as a village it is preposterous&#x2014;at a little distance it looks as if it had been built with a pack of cards&#x2014;all so white and twostoried and formal! at hand you find it consists of a great many smart, roman-cemented cockney-built <hi rend="italic">Villas</hi> with a sprinkling of <hi rend="italic">&#x2018;gin pallace&#x2019;</hi>-looking Hotels, grouped stupidly, or in strait lines at regular distances&#x2014;all which seems so out of character on the slope of a romantic hill and alongside of a fine old Monastery and some two or three <hi rend="italic">old</hi> houses in the gothic style!&#x2014;But it will do well enough for all I am likely to <hi rend="italic">want</hi> with it&#x2014;Pray heaven you may not find me fallen into that arch-sin&#x2014;a taste for description of natural scenery&#x2014; For the present then you are to figure your <foreign><hi rend="italic">povera piccola</hi></foreign> [poor little one] settled in one of these gin-pallace Hotels (<hi rend="italic">of course</hi> the most aristocratic&#x2014;when my Lord this and My Lady that breathe the same atmosphere that we breath&#x2014;) tolerably well off as to things temporal, but for the spiritual part looking forward to better times; we have private rooms like the rest of the <hi rend="italic">great</hi> people, and are served with excellent food, and Mrs. S. sews at her worsted work, and I work at your purse and the <supplied>[<foreign>Stimabile</foreign>]</supplied> exclaims <hi rend="italic">&#x2018;By Jove Hester this tranquillity is&#x2014;delicious,&#x2019;</hi> but from the fierce tone he begins in, tho&#x2019; sinking into dieaway softness at the close, I am always expecting the <hi rend="italic">&#x2018;delicious&#x2019;</hi> will come out a <hi rend="italic">&#x2018;damnable&#x2019;</hi>&#x2014;and when there is no more to be done &#x2018;we go about worship&#x2019; and so to bed where I for one, tho&#x2019; quiet enough, sleep no better than at Chelsea&#x2014;that is to say badly as can be.

<salute>My dear Brother</salute>
<p>Your Letter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dated at Albano and Rome, <date when="1837-07-23">23</date> and <date when="1837-07-24">24 July</date>.</note> has been two days here; I take the first opportunity there is of answering it. Mother and I had many a computation about the time of its coming; but happily before my pleadings for delay had lost effect, the welcome sheet itself arrived, and told us all was well. My Mother&#x2019;s anxiety was always great, and is now grown greater than ever: she had failed to get a Newspaper while I was journeying hither, and had almost made up her mind, they told me, that I would never come, but was drowned in the Humber. It is beautiful to see old age produce no worse effect; only weaken the force of hope, not that of affection.&#x2014; My pen is sharp enough in the point, and I have started with a small hand; nevertheless it is to be feared you will get small good of me this time too; my sharp pen is embarrassing and <pb id="pg-09-283" n="09:283"/>uncomfortable, my flat table itself is against me;&#x2014;worst of all, O Doctor, <hi rend="italic">blue pill and senna</hi>, and the chagrins and heats which have driven me to that! However, <foreign><hi rend="italic">allons</hi></foreign> [let&#x2019;s go on].</p>
<p>I was in hopes, as the <hi rend="italic">cholera</hi> seemed to be girdling you in, that Lady Clare in her known apprehension of it, would surely come home in <date when="1837-09-00">September</date>. But it seems there is less hope than ever of that. Having no map here, I do not rightly know at what distance the danger is from you;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >There were reports in <date when="1837-08-00">early August</date> of cholera epidemics in Palermo and Naples.</note> but I conclude somehow or other that you will not remain there exposed to risks which were almost needless on your part. One who had duty to do would do it in the middle of ten choleras, but without duty there is no wisdom in staying where it is. Has Lady Clare lost her terror of it? I wish the <foreign>Gn&#xE4;dige Frau</foreign> [Gracious Lady]<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The term applied to Lady Z&#xE4;hdarm (see Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi>, p. 125). Carlyle is using it here not in reference to Lady Clare but to a friend of hers, Frau von Spaur, expecting a child in <date when="1838-02-00">Feb. 1838</date> and urging Lady Clare to remain in Rome until after her confinement. John wrote: &#x201C;The probable number of English at Rome next winter cannot be determined, but I think it is not likely to be much greater than it was last winter on account of the fear of cholera and quarantine. I shall not likely renew my engagement with Lady Clare only for a month or two if she resolves on staying, as that would throw me into the winter without sufficient recompense; but if circumstances do not unexpectedly change, I should hardly think myself justifiable in refusing to accept the same terms as last year for the whole season with the view of returning in spring to England. I should still like to see what Rome w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> do for me in a favourable year.&#x2014; However it is by no means certain that Lady Clare will not be home in <date when="1837-10-00">October</date>.&#x201D;</note> had put off her <foreign><hi rend="italic">Gute Hoffnung</hi></foreign> [good hope] for a little, if she could! However, I will not afflict myself without known ground; let us hope that it will again be all well.&#x2014; In other respects, I really do not see what better you can do than try Rome again, as you propose. The conditions for settling in London are really frightful to a man; you have on the whole to say to yourself: I will either succeed or die! There is no other way of succeeding there. Now at Rome and in your present position you go on without such terrible pitch of resolution; spite of all discontents you are at lowest laying by a little money annually; very soon, see, you will have a purse of &#xa3;1000, and are then secured at least against want, and can <hi rend="italic">live</hi> either working or not working all the rest of your days. This is something; it is not all, but in these days it is something considerable. Do the best thou canst therefore; and may the good Powers speed it! The only other thing I know about Rome for the present is that John Sterling persists yet in going to Pisa rather. I had a Letter from him lately, written in great haste, of hand and mind, not momentary but continual haste; in which <pb id="pg-09-284" n="09:284"/>without mentioning Rome, he speaks of Pisa as decided on; for the <date when="1837-09-00">end of September</date>. His Brother Anthony, who knows Pisa and him, has mainly influenced this result. I could have wished another one for your sake: nay I think you will still see Sterling once at least at Rome; he is a restless man. He is at Bourdeaux again by this time. His main errand to England, it seems, was the negociating of a marriage between his friend Maurice and his sister-in-law Anne Barton whom I think you saw: the high Barton family thought it lowish; John had to remonstrate and demonstrate; and all is now got settled, and they are to be as happily united as need be.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370803-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, <date when="1837-08-03">3 Aug.</date></ref></note> She is a fine sensible-looking girl Anne; Maurice too is not without superior qualities, but at bottom I fear always very much of a burble of wiredrawings. His intensity far exceeds his proportion of strength<supplied>[;]</supplied> there is something ominous in men that cannot <hi rend="italic">rest</hi>. No tidings of Fraser:<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Fraser.</note> he too looked very restless; soft, unstable as water.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Gen. 49:4.</note></p>
<p>But to speak of Scotsbrig. Our good Mother keeps very well here. What she suffers from when none of us are with her, is solitariness; but of course she has nothing of that at present. She and I have been out once or twice, for two hours, helping Jamie with his hay; she is &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">waul</hi></foreign> [nimble] as an eel&#x201D; while working. We have also made experiment on your <hi rend="italic">pills</hi> (happily that is very rare with her); but they seem to have entirely lost their virtue. She cooks our little meal, which we eat peacefully together; she mends clothes, bakes soda-scones, is very fond of Newspapers, especially radical ones, and stands up for the rights of man. She has toiled into near the end of the second volume of the F. Revolution, not without considerable understanding of it, tho&#x2019; the French names are a sad clog: she will make it out pretty completely by and by. No other of them has got so far, or indeed entered at all; except Alick, whose impression seems to be a deep but confused one of battles and trials and a whole Nation rioting for hunger. For his own share, Alick has now formed a scheme.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370722-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1837-07-22">22 July</date></ref>, for Alick&#x2019;s plan. <hi rend="italic">The Globe</hi> (<date when="1837-08-05">5 Aug.</date>) reported that demand had not been great because of the availability of cheap salmon, though the herring fishing in the coming season was expected to be good in quantity and quality.</note> The American speculation being renounced, and that of the Puttoch and Scotsbrig farming, he set off some four weeks ago with Jamie Ewart for Liverpool, on some project of going thence in Ewart&#x2019;s Sloop to the Herring-fishery. At Liverpool, however, the tidings from <pb id="pg-09-285" n="09:285"/>the Fishery-stations was such that nothing could be hoped; so Alick after waiting for some ten days found good to come home again, and nothing done in that line. He had lived in Jamie&#x2019;s Sloop, in Liverpool Harbour; he had seen the Election riots;<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On <date when="1837-07-25">25 July</date> in Liverpool a &#x201C;Whig mob &#x2026; smashed the windows of the Conservative houses, tore to pieces one of the Conservative committee-rooms, and maltreated many of the police;&#x201D; the Mayor read the riot act but was suspected of sympathising with the mob as a Whig. However, as the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> reported (<date when="1837-07-27">27 July</date>), &#x201C;Liverpool has shaken off the trammels of Popery and Socinianism&#x201D; and Lord Sandon and Cresswell, the Conservatives, triumphed over the Whigs Ewart and Elphinstone.</note> and been out for a day or two at Manchester. The thing then that he had set his intent upon, guided I suppose by what he saw of wholesale merchandise, and talk with Hanning, was the old scheme of a shop in Ecclefechan.<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In his mother&#x2019;s houses (see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18320522-TC-JAC-01"><sic>6:161</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1832-05-22">22 May 1832</date></corr></ref>).</note> One could not find in one&#x2019;s heart to say a word against it; nay it seems to be agreed upon that there is a kind of opening there; also wholesale goods were never so cheap as now in this great wreckage of trade. Alick seems steadier than he once was; with a hearty appliance of himself, with patience, with thrift and perseverance, may he not do something? The immediate increase to his happiness will be great. For he starts instantly. Hall Moffat<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Hall Moffat, bootmaker.</note> who has fallen quite behind with his rent agrees to pay up arrears as far as Whitsunday, and <hi rend="italic">flit</hi> immediately; whereupon Alick, in the course of next week, will start repairing and remodelling. He can shift from his Annan house at a day&#x2019;s warning. In a couple of months he may be fairly under way in that new enterprise; as my Mother&#x2019;s tenant; to <hi rend="italic">whom</hi> at least he will be of great comfort there. He has not seen your Letter yet, but shall, probably tonight; your brotherliness will be a real comfort to him. I think his demeanour in these painful windbound circumstances of his does him credit. I have thought for long that the only quite fatal peril for him was that of learning to drink; but there seems distinctly less tendency that way, so far as I can judge: sore affliction was needed for training the headstrong nature of the man. We will still hope good for him, poor Dillick; a brave little fellow, and one of the lovingest hearts there ever lived with such &#x201C;a dibble of a temper.&#x201D; Clow<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Clow of Land.</note> has sold Land (&#xa3;4,000); is about <foreign>rouping</foreign> [selling by auction] his stuff &#x26;c, and goes to America in a fortnight. Ben Hawkins the Smith says, &#x201C;It is a terrible pity such a man should have his <hi rend="italic">grun&#x2019;</hi> to sell to Irvims [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] of Burnfoot,<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Irving of Burnfoot (see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18320831-TC-JAC-01"><sic>6:222</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1832-08-31">31 Aug. 1832</date></corr></ref>).</note> a set of persons rich indeed, but <pb id="pg-09-286" n="09:286"/>sprung from the worst stock, known, in his Father&#x2019;s time, as mere <hi rend="italic">thiefs&#x201D;!</hi> Clow is resolute tho&#x2019; agitated; I give him a line to Greig; he will be able to buy an estate cheap at present, and with five or six sons may readily do well. Our half-brother John went off, as perhaps I mentioned in last Letter.&#x2014; The rest of our people here go on as they were wont. Austin has always a little work, seldom enough; a well-conditioned, innocent toilsome man; Mary one of the thriftiest of wives. I was at Dumfries shortly after writing; Alick, Mother and I, in a kind of spring-cart, with one of Jamie&#x2019;s horses: the weather broke down there into rain for three weeks or more, and I never got back; till now I begin to resolve about it again. Jean and Jamie were doing very well; a prosperous <foreign>shifty</foreign> fellow Jamie, and Jean healthy and hearty, full of shrewd stubborn remarks with a great deal of natural fun and stuff in them. Painting is worse than ever at Dumfries; but Jamie makes it do very cleverly for him. They have a little boy called Jamie; perfectly silent as yet, but with a singular share of wit in the eyes and movements of it. At Scotsbrig here all is as when you saw it, or nearly so. A new gravelled road has been shaped from the Fairy-<foreign>brae</foreign>, along the top of the steep to the clayey corner where the Plantation begins and the ground all on to the Stack-yard is then smooth. It is quite sheltered that road; a dike pared down till it is grown very high on the north side of you; the burn and the bushes and branches sounding on the other side of you, with views of Criffel<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A mountain range in SE Kirkcudbrightshire.</note> and the Solway; the road itself qu<supplied>[ite]</supplied> dry: I used often to walk there in the wet weather. The season, in spite of the bad spring, promises to be gr<supplied>[eatly]</supplied> bountiful; potatoes all excellent; the poor people have fallen to them everywhere, doubtless with thankfulness<supplied>[. I]</supplied> understand many of them have hardly known for many long months what it was to be satisfied with food! Such I believe is literally the case with hundreds of thousands of British men at this moment: there is no kind of peace to be expected, or to be desired, while that, or the risk of that, continues at its present height&#x2014;I have hardly seen any other person here in Annandale. Graham is kind, but <foreign><hi rend="italic">hebetated</hi></foreign> to a degree. Ben Nelson I see a little of when at Annan; I understand his pecuniary affairs are in the worst state; his son&#x2019;s money all seized by Carlyle of Waterbeck:<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Carlyle (see <ref target="volume-04/lt-18260202-ACTC-JAC-01"><sic>4:31</sic><corr>ACTC to JAC, <date when="1826-02-02">2 Feb. 1826</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340612-TC-MAC-01"><sic>7:206</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1834-06-12">12 June 1834</date></corr></ref>).</note> a Bankruptcy, in order that <hi rend="italic">all</hi> his creditors may have their share, is understood to be the thing he is striving after. I saw Robert Dixon,<note n="15" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Also spelled Dickson.</note> his Wife and Mother-in-law, one <pb id="pg-09-287" n="09:287"/>day. Sad enough to see: the old woman all gone to tears and clatter, the daughter hard with sore distresses of many kinds; Dixon himself is still lively, has had an operation on his eyes at Glasgow with marked <hi rend="italic">improvement</hi>. Waugh was standing by the jetty of the Steamer on that day when Alick &#x26; Ewart went off for Liverpool; I had run down thither to see Alick before going: nothing could excel the absurdity of Waugh; who is printing a new Theory of Vitality or Nerves or something (price three and sixpence), and could hardly articulate intelligibly for a kind of ornamental <hi rend="italic">lisp</hi> he had adopted!<note n="16" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370722-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1837-07-22">22 July</date></ref>.</note> I left him with promptitude. Cressfield I have never seen yet, tho&#x2019; I still mean it some night when in heart. Dr Arnott I did see; fat, quiet, stupid: one of his neaphews [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] more is going out to India, or gone; one of the old ones returning. I think there are no more Annandale news. You have a sheet-ful!</p>
<p>On Tuesday last (this is Saturday) when at Annan I learned that Mrs Welsh with her Brother and three other Liverpool relatives had just passed thro&#x2019; for Thornhill out of the Steamer; they had accidentally seen Ben Nelson, and reported all well. Next day there came a long and long-expected Letter from Jane herself: she had delayed writing till she could give me some account of her motions, which had only just then got decided on. She, her Mother being gone, was to go with the Sterlings to a place called Malvern, a watering-place in Worcestershire (I think), the Wilsons &#x26;c were also to be there. She was to go round by Oxford, to stay with &#x201C;Archdeacons&#x201D; and such like; and, on the whole, appeared to have been half constrained to go. I am to hear from her again in a day or two. The expedition was to last some four weeks or so; but she threatened to run home in the Mail sooner than that. She represents herself as better than she was, but far enough from well. I do not at all like the state she is in; but I cannot alter it; I try always to hope that it will alter. She writes in great spirits, but there is no fund of real cheerfulness, there is not even a serious melancholy visible.<note n="17" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly a puzzling judgment in light of Jane&#x2019;s letters to Carlyle of this time.</note> My poor Jane!</p>
<p>I wrote to Cavaignac, he has written to me that the last Parcel went punctually off to Paris on the <date when="1837-06-02">2<hi rend="italic">nd</hi> of June</date>. It is pity that you have never got them; the Book would have interested you in your solitude. Cav<hi rend="italic">gc</hi> is angry with me for my treatment of the Seagreen <pb id="pg-09-288" n="09:288"/>Man and my <foreign><hi rend="italic">impartialit&#xE9;</hi></foreign> generally: I take no side in the matter; how very singular! As to the success of the Book I <hi rend="italic">know</hi> almost nothing, but suppose it to be considerably greater than I expected. Mill&#x2019;s Review was in a great style of eulogy, the best review a man could wish of himself. I understand there have been many reviews of very mixed character. I got one in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> last week; thinking it might be worth more to you than the postage I sent it forward. The writer is one Thack<supplied>[e]</supplied>ray, a half-monstrous Cornish giant; kind of painter, Cambridge man, and Paris Newspaper Correspondent, who is now writing for life, in London: I have seen him at the Bullers&#x2019; and at Sterling&#x2019;s; his article is rather like him, and I suppose calculated to do the Book good. I wish you had the Book itself. Cavaignac has renounced <hi rend="italic">his</hi> review (I think) in favour of somebody or other, or even some<hi rend="italic">bodies</hi>, in <hi rend="italic">National</hi> and elsewhere; about whom he wrote me largely.<note n="18" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robespierre (cf. <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, III, 167). Cavaignac had written in his long letter of <date when="1837-07-24">24 July</date>: &#x201C;In short you are free&#x2014;that is to say, the only master you now have is the harshest of them all, the <hi rend="italic">self</hi>. &#x2026; Enjoy yourself, then, to your heart&#x2019;s content. Take walks. When you have had a good dinner, go out and worship nature, burning for incense, in this temple of your god, tobacco in pipe or cigar, and saying as your prayer: &#x2018;Oh, God, deliver me from this devil that you have placed in each of us, as if hell were not large enough or as if we must serve as a corridor for those wandering demons who run about the earth and end by settling down with us.&#x2019;<lb/><lb/>
&#x201C;<foreign>Apropos</foreign> of criticism and heavenly bodies, I would say of your book &#x2026; that on the <date when="1837-06-15">fifteenth of June</date> I sent my own copy by Dorn&#xE8;s to a young Parisian writer, Mr. Haur&#xE9;au, who is better qualified to appreciate your way of writing and your ideas than anyone else, asking him to write articles on it for the <hi rend="italic">National</hi>, with which he is on good terms, something I have not been lately, which explains why I have not done it myself.<lb/><lb/>
&#x201C;Ah, Mr. Carlyle, you are <hi rend="italic">impartial!</hi> Good. I shall make you smart for this. You judge our revolution as if it were an ordinary lawsuit, and in spite of all your vigorous aptitude and honesty you evince no passionate preference for the good or the bad people. A fig for passionate preference, say you? When one writes history he must etc. etc. I think I can hear you from here. But there are situations where, as Moli&#xE8;re puts it, justice is quite unjust. Seriously, my grudge against you is that such an eminent and conscientious man refuses to take sides. The genius that there is in your book only makes me harder to please. In my opinion you are particularly at fault with regard to Robespierre. We must respect the memory of those unusual men who have borne the burdens of public necessities. They are the victims that modern times sacrifice to fate.&#x201D; Transl. Frederick W.

My ambition is small, that of being allowed to live. No duty is so clear for me at present as the necessity of letting my perturbation subside, Which really I hope it is doing, tho&#x2019; slowly. I look much better in health, and several of my symptoms have abated. The black speck itself is sometimes away altogether. Into my mind too there comes occasionally a glimpse of insight; as if old clouds were parting. I keep silent; am very sad still, but make no tumult. All will grow better. My Mother is here, come to write her P.S. &#x201C;if thou wad tell me what to say!&#x201D; I give up the pen to her</p>

<p>I do not see very well how you should address your next Letter. Chelsea will be the safest, I think. Jane will be there at any rate; I either there, or accessible therefrom.

No time is yet set for my going off; while the good weather lasts I shall not be in haste.</p>
<p>Had you been coming home, I once thought of meeting you in Switzerland. But that is up.

<salute>My good Wife,</salute>
<p>If I seem dilatory in writing, it is but appearance, not reality: this is literally the first possibility I have had since your new address got hither. The Government Frank came as fast as it could; greatly to the quieting of my anxieties; after which I waited in sure hope. On monday morning last I set out on a journey too long delayed to Dumfries and Templand. Passing thro&#x2019; the Village on my galloway, Postie there and then handed me out the Malvern Letter; a Letter from your Mother earnestly encouraging my Templand expedition; finally a Newspaper seemingly directed in Goody&#x2019;s hand too, but marked ominously with red ink, with a huge brown seal, and the charge of some five shillings and odds. This latter I declined; the two former I accepted, and set to reading in the bright sunny morning, heedless of men. Your Mother&#x2019;s was despatched in few paces; but Goody&#x2019;s served me ambling along in alternate sunshine and shadow of trees till I was fairly over Hoddam Bridge. A blithe man it made me; for the poor little <foreign>Lassie</foreign> seemed really to be enjoying her travels, and did not, as was too apt to be her wont, &#x201C;ride thro&#x2019; the country with her eye fixed merely on the apron of the gig.&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably quoted from Jane herself on some previous occasion.</note> &#x201C;She can write a grand Letter when she likes,&#x201D; said my Mother, last night when I read it over to her on my return. The former account I had got of the <foreign>feckless waefulness</foreign> attendant on packing and departing dwelt sad within me; it is such a counterpart of what I have felt so often, or rather do always of late feel: one is ashamed to claim pity, and yet one could <foreign><hi rend="italic">greet</hi></foreign> [weep] for very misery, and might deserve to be prayed for in all churches. The nerves of man are a fearful piece of machinery.&#x2014; Not till last night at ten o&#x2019;clock, wearied foredone and the saddest man in all Scotland, did I get to any table where an inkstand and ten minutes of composure might be mine. This morning (steeped to the heart in nauseous Doctors&#x2019; stuff, <foreign><hi rend="italic">ach Gott!</hi></foreign>) I write as I can. My galloway was small, of violent temper and no breeding; I had awakened, on my Templand night, at three in the morning, on my Dumfries ones at five each, and had to fight my way home again out of the kindnesses of those people with the suspicion resting on me that I was a kind of churl. The old grey walls of Scotsbrig rose tranquil from amid the green branches <pb id="pg-09-291" n="09:291"/>from the babble of the &#x201C;<foreign>caudron</foreign>,&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Pool at the foot of the waterfall at Scotsbrig.</note> in the moonshine and silence last night; and my Mother&#x2019;s candle was burning in the front window: it seemed all a <hi rend="italic">vision</hi>, fast very fast departing; but it was beautiful to me; I shall not be long behind it. O Jane, O my Jane!&#x2014; But now let me get to work.</p>
<p>The Templand people were all comfortably at breakfast on the Tuesday morning when I arrived; your Mother looking really ten years younger than when I left her. She is clear in complexion, assiduous to provide felicity, joyful as one altogether in her element; and had your Uncle under a short course of <hi rend="italic">castor</hi>. He, spite of the <hi rend="italic">castor</hi> against which he kicked reluctant, seemed well to live, hearty and jovial as ever; &#x201C;one of those strong men that can <hi rend="italic">rest</hi>.&#x201D; The girls are beauties in their way; the gold-haired one<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jeannie Welsh.</note> a conscious beauty; pleasant phenomena to see flitting about on this Planet; doubtless of the pleasantest one can behold there. Walter himself seemed to me a very good kind of lad, intelligent withal, and of a fine pacific quiescent nature. What will recommend him greatly to you, he has read the <hi rend="italic">French Revolution</hi>, and even was speaking of it with some considerable understanding! Your Letter, read aloud, had &#x201C;great success&#x201D;; especially the &#x201C;By Jove, Hester, this tranquillity&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370811-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, <date when="1837-08-11">11 Aug.</date></ref></note> produced an explosion of laughter.&#x2014; My first purpose, as I knew the scarcity of beds, was to get away that night; then, that failing, in the fore noon while heat had not rendered riding impossible: but it would not do; we had all to go and see &#x201C;Crichope Linn&#x201D;;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-06/lt-18330907-TC-JWC-01"><sic>6:434&#x2013;36</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1833-09-07">7 Sept. 1833</date></corr></ref>.</note> it was sunset before I could force my way out, and then only with semi-promises to come back, which I have no purpose of fulfilling. Mrs Creighton<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mrs Crichton of Dabton; she died on <date when="1837-09-21">21 Sept.</date></note> was ill and greatly out of spirits; your Mother went thither while we visited the Linn; I saw no one. Mrs C. I think has written for Elizabeth Fergus; I heard also that Pepoli was to go to Kirkcaldy.&#x2014; At Dumfries on the Monday I had managed beforehand to see M&#x2019;Diarmid for three minutes, and get a settlement of him. The Game-rent, poor Goody&#x2019;s addition of pinmoney, was eaten away by some 30/ of expences; I received, deducting the price of the Newspaper, just 3 shillings of balance. But it is straight now, and I will account to thee. Also I have to say that Major Scott<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably the same Scott who had taken the shooting in <date when="1834-00-00">1834</date>; see <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340828-TC-AC-01"><sic>7:279</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1834-08-28">28 Aug. 1834</date></corr></ref>.</note> has taken the thing this year, <pb id="pg-09-292" n="09:292"/>with privilege of houseroom, for &#xa3;10, deducting &#xa3;1 for the goodwill of Nannie Macqueen,<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-04/lt-18270414-TC-JWC-01"><sic>4:204&#x2013;5</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1827-04-14">14 April 1827</date></corr></ref>.</note> who seems to occasion some difficulty, Scott being a man that wishes to have all things straight and no croaking in it. I said what I could to explain the footing Nannie stood on,<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340815-TC-JAC-01"><sic>7:273</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1834-08-15">15 Aug. 1834</date></corr></ref>.</note> and added withal that it would be free to take a complete lease of next year. It seems the woods also need new cutting, but nothing can be done in it this season. On <hi rend="italic">re</hi>passing thro&#x2019; Dumfries I was too miserable to be troubled with anybody; and <hi rend="italic">business</hi> being all done, I rode off direct out of Jean&#x2019;s house; towards Annan, for a bathe; and so home, forlorn as you have seen. I must write to poor Mac some note of apology; and also to put in writing the Nannie Macqueen business. Aird I had had a walk with on the monday night; not entertaining: greatly amazed at the F. Revolution, a &#x201C;most extraordinary Book&#x201D; &#x26;c &#x201C;destruction of conventionalities; but then what is to come in the place of them?&#x201D; He tells me he means to save a little money, and then to retire, <hi rend="italic">not</hi> marrying, to his native village. With a feeling of great thankfulness, I quitted that confused <foreign><hi rend="italic">crowdie</hi></foreign> [mess] of persons and relations of persons; to sit here, like Cowper&#x2019;s crow on the belfry, and say over it all: &#x201C;Caw!&#x201D;<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. William Cowper, <hi rend="italic">The Jackdaw</hi>, stanzas 1 and 5.</note></p>
<p>Such, dear Jean, is my travel&#x2019;s history;<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Othello</hi>, I, iii.</note> literally no history at all, the due record of which were entire <hi rend="italic">silence</hi>, had one not a Goody to write nothings to. Regret not that thou hast not been near me; O no! I have been in the hospital here, in the <hi rend="italic">mud-bath</hi>, where it is far better to be left alone. The inexpressible feeling of sadness and life weariness that overloads one is not base nor unendurable if it do but keep good-natured, if it issue not perversely in hard words to those we love! It is medicinal, I do believe. Much irritation has subsided; my feeling towards all mortals is most usually one of pity again, &#x201C;beginning with William Corson&#x201D;;<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310606-TC-JAC-01"><sic>5:285</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1831-06-06">6 June 1831</date></corr></ref>, where he is called a &#x201C;great goose.&#x201D;</note> to my loved ones,&#x2014;O Heaven!

We shall see what will come of it. I cannot here estimate my new capabilities, or what even approximately my position in London may now be.

If an Angel were to demand with all the crowns and laurel-garlands that ever girt the heads of Adam&#x2019;s sinful posterity in the one hand, and in the other an offer of Peace, the Power to be at Peace,&#x2014;O Angel, I would say, keep thy garlands, let me, were it as a breaker of whinstones, have peace! Enough of this.</p>
<p>I have had no Letters that you have not sent except a short one from Mill, and a long one from John. Mill writes to ask me for an old Letter of his about Carrel and Paris; which Letter, I replied, was unattainable, being in your keeping, and you gone to Malvern. He is busy writing a Book &#x201C;on Logic&#x201D;; and seems anxious for my verdict in favour of the enterprise. Write surely, since thou hast a mind to write: that is the rule. He says in reference to Thackeray&#x2019;s Article, which he attributes to Sterling, it will get me many new readers: <foreign><hi rend="italic">esto</hi></foreign> [so be it]! By the by this Article did us all some good here. It was a sunny Monday morning; Alick had been up here, Jamie and I were escorting him homewards: daily for above a week had the little messenger flown to the Post Office without any effect at all; what was Goody about, why was there no tidings or token? Lo, on the top of the Potters Knowe (the height immediately behind Middlebie), Betty Smeal unfastening her luggage; presenting two Newspapers with their strokes in Goody&#x2019;s hand; one of which was this <hi rend="italic">Times!</hi> They made me take place under the shade of the head and beechtrees, and read it all over to them, amid considerable laughter and applause. One is obliged to men in these circumstances who say even with bluster and platitude greater than Thackeray&#x2019;s, Behold this man is not an ass.&#x2014; I wrote to Cavaignac;<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >This letter has not been found.</note> I think his Letter very sprightly and unsound; but I do value the man as among the manfullest I know. John Sterling&#x2019;s Letter you doubtless read? An inarticulate blast of music: your criticism of his Life and way of doing seemed to me very just. But there is more hope of him now; hope of his <hi rend="italic">living</hi>, which includes all other hope for him. My brother John&#x2019;s long Letter held out no prospect of his return in <date when="1837-09-00">September</date>, nor fixed determination of any kind; Ladyship waiting on a certain Frau von Spaur,<note n="15" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Th&#xE9;r&#xE8;se von Spaur (see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370707-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1837-07-07">7 July</date></ref>, and <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370812-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1837-08-12">12 Aug.</date></ref>).</note> undecided &#x26;c; Jack himself not guessing how it would be. The likeliest seemed to be his trying Rome another winter, and returning perhaps in spring. The cholera was girdling them in, in spite of all the Pope&#x2019;s <pb id="pg-09-294" n="09:294"/>industry: it had struck me they would be retreating before it, but they were not. Alick here has resolved at last on opening a shop in Ecclefechan, in my Mother&#x2019;s main house in that village. It is a forlorn prospect; but I cannot say to him it is not the <hi rend="italic">best</hi>. Some hundreds of thousands in this country this year, as I learn too indubitably, have not known for ten months past what it is to be satisfied with food. The condition of the lower classes is frightful, and we have mere <foreign><hi rend="italic">Io-poeans</hi></foreign> [cries of joy] on the Poor Law. I am sorrier for no man than for Alick; but hope still of him: the face he shows is even <hi rend="italic">good</hi>, considering all.</p>
<p>As for thee, my poor Goody, sole possession that I have in the world, close knit to me tho&#x2019; so cruelly separated, do thou, my little dear, take all care of thyself, and be well and hopeful when we meet again. Enjoy Malvern while it is good; the second day after it has grown tiresome, take coach and go home. Have the house swept for me; I think I will soon meet thee there. <date when="1837-09-00">September</date> is supportable in London, at least the end of it. At all events it were as well we met soon now. If too hot, we might run over to Boulogne on our own account? Write directly, so soon as there is any distinct prediction to be made. I wish I were near thee, O I wish&#x2014;I wish&#x2014;many things. Write any way, directly. I can no farther: my soul and my body are alike sick today. <foreign>Adieu</foreign> dear Wife! Keep a good heart: be sincerely cheerful when there is real fun; sincerely sad when the misery is real. Sad is serious, the beginning of insight, of conduct.<closer><salute>God be with thee, my own.</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Jenny,&#x2014;</salute>
<p>Your letter to Mary at Annan got this length on Saturday night. As you appear to be impatient for news from this quarter, not unreasonably, having had none for six weeks, I am appointed to write you a few lines without any loss of time whatever,&#x2014;a thing I can easily enough do, being even idler to-day than common.</p> 
<p>We were not so well pleased to hear of your <foreign>fecklessness</foreign> and pain in the stomach during the last fortnight, but we hope it is but something derived from the season and will not continue. There is very often a kind of &#x201C;British Cholera&#x201D; in this harvest time. It is even very frequent at present in this region, owing partly to the air (as they say), and chiefly, perhaps, to the new potatoes and other imperfectly ripened substances which people eat. Jamie, here, had a cast of it for two days just a week ago, rather sharp, but he is free now. Our Mother too was taken with it,&#x2014;came home rather ill from Ecclefechan one day,&#x2014;but by aid of Castor and some prime Brandy has got quite round again. You do not say that the disorder has got that length with you, but very probably it is something related to the same business. The only remedy is to be careful of what one eats, to take due moderate exercise in the open air, in case of extremity employing a little medicine. Cold, especially cold feet are very bad; but the great thing is to take care of one&#x2019;s self, especially to take care what one eats. New potatoes are very unwholesome for some people.</p>
<p>We are now all well here, and with the slight exception mentioned above have been so ever since I wrote last. Alick brought us news of you. Alick&#x2019;s news are the main ones I have now to send you. He quitted Annan on Monday last (this day gone a week), and has been in the Big house at Ecclefechan ever since. I suppose he explained to you and Robert the plan he had of setting up a shop there. He has gathered himself together, and is all alive after that same enterprise now. We had him and little Tom over here all yesterday. Mother, Jamie, and I walked with them to Cleughbrae in the evening. To-day, as we understand, he has got masons and actually broken in upon the house to repair it and arrange it for that object; Hall Moffet<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Hall Moffat (cf. <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370812-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1837-08-12">12 Aug.</date></ref>).</note> and his <pb id="pg-09-296" n="09:296"/>retinue having been got out. It is in a sad state of wreck, the poor house, but Alick expects to put a new face on it with great despatch indeed; and then, &#x201C;shop drawers&#x201D; and all the rest being provided, and James Aitken&#x2019;s brush having given the last touch to it, he will unfold his wares and try the thing in the name of Hope. We all pray heartily that it may prosper beyond his expectations. Ecclefechan is a sad Village: only last Friday night some Blackguard broke 14 panes of the Meeting House windows. Fancy such an act of dastardly atrocity as that! But it lies in the centre of a tolerable country, too, and certain there is <hi rend="italic">need</hi> of some good shop and honest Trader there.</p>
<p>I have seen Mary pretty frequently, the last time on Friday last. She is very well, and all her <foreign>bairns</foreign> are well. James has always some work, though seldom enough, and Mary is the brightest, thriftiest little creature that can be. They go on there as well as one could hope in these times. We had a letter from the Doctor, too: still in the same place,&#x2014;Albano, near Rome; still well; uncertain as to his future movements or engagements, though it must be settled some way before this date, if we know how. He seemed to think it very unlikely that he would be here in the present autumn, the likeliest of all that he would try to return next spring. The Cholera was in that country, but had not got to them. We fancy they will not fail to fly out of the road of it, if it advance too near.</p>
<p>I was at Dumfries since I wrote: up to Templand, and then again at Dumfries on my return. Mrs. Welsh came home several weeks ago, and had at the time I was up, and has still, her Liverpool friends with her. The house was very crowded. I was not very well, and stayed only four and twenty hours or so, cutting out my way in spite of all entreaties. Jean and her two Jamies are very tolerably well: the elder Jamie a thrifty, effectual, busy man; the younger as yet altogether silent, staggering and tripping about,&#x2014;one of the <foreign><hi rend="italic">gleggest</hi></foreign> [liveliest] little elves I have seen. There is talk of her coming down to Annan this very week to have the benefit of the tide for sea bathing. Jamie of Scotsbrig, who goes up to-morrow to pay his rent, will bring us word.</p>
<p>The other morning, walking out, I met Robert&#x2019;s father<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Hanning.</note> at the &#x201C;Lengland&#x2019;s Nett,&#x201D; coming down from Dairlaw Hills with a row of bog-hay carts he had been buying at Dairlaw Hills. He was hale and well to look at, and reported all well. I suppose he has been very busy of late; seldom were so many <foreign><hi rend="italic">roups</hi></foreign> [sales] seen in one season; <pb id="pg-09-297" n="09:297"/>all the farmers selling off, none of them having money for their rent day; Land farm, and now all the stock, crop, and household furniture have been sold off. Poor Clow goes off for America on Wednesday morning by the Liverpool steamer. People are all sorry. The Burnfoot Irvings, or Sandy Cowie for them, have bought his land: &#xa3;4000.</p>
<p>Betty Smail, bound for Ecclefechan, has been waiting this half hour till I should be done; I did not know of her when I began. The needfullest thing, therefore, that I can do is to tell you about our coming. It will be soon, but is still uncertain when. I should say in about a fortnight,&#x2014;nay, in a day or so <hi rend="italic">less;</hi> but it depends somewhat on a letter we look for from Jane which has not yet come to hand. Jane, you must know, after her mother&#x2019;s departure went into the country with the Sterlings, friends of hers. I wish her to stay there while she likes, and would get home about the same time as she; a month was the time she first spoke of, and that I have little doubt will suffice,&#x2014;so my guess is as above given. A newspaper with one stroke on it will come to you (barring mistakes) two days before you are to look for us. This shall be a token, and we need not write any more. Alick has some talk of coming with us to get his goods ready <hi rend="italic">then</hi>, but I think <hi rend="italic">he</hi> will hardly be ready. The butter and another <foreign>firkin</foreign> of butter has been talked of and will be forthcoming, but it seems dubious whether any of it will get with us. It can come before or after, I believe safe and with little expense. Mother will bring &#x201C;some pounds of it&#x201D; in her box. I shall perhaps be obliged to go back by Liverpool, and must not calculate to stay more with you than a day. My Mother sends you both her love (she is smoking here); she &#x201C;will tell you all her news&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech.

<p>I have been too long waiting for certainties&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">hithering and thithering</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Is gone on a Tour with the elder Mr &#x26; Mrs Sterling, while I am in Scotland rusticating &#x26; vegetating&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note).</note> being a condition under which I find it almost impossible to write or indeed to do any thing except fret myself to fiddlestrings. What I generally do in such cases is to shape out a decision with all despatch for <hi rend="italic">myself</hi>, and leave the others to welter on after their own fashion; accordingly when I found on our arrival at Clifton, that it was all in the wind whether we should stay there one week or two or three, and whether we should return straight to London, or by Brighton, or by the Isle of Wight, or first making &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">a run over to Dublin</hi>,&#x201D; I immediately announced my intention of descending by <hi rend="italic">parachute</hi>, and was only prevented from carrying it into effect by humane consideration for the Parties in the Balloon, where there was evidently going to be an alarming explosion in case of my departure. Mrs Sterling having set her heart on a visit of some length to the Bartons, and his Whirlwindship finding the whole Barton generation &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">creatures without stimulus</hi>&#x201D; whom he was desirous to cut and run from by &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">feeling it his duty to see poor Mr</hi><supplied>[s]</supplied> <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi> <hi rend="small-caps">ome</hi>!&#x201D; His secret purpose was evidently to take himself and me back in the carriage and leave M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> S to follow as she could&#x2014;and this I felt would have been a very ungracious proceeding towards that good soul who treats me with such kindness and consideration. I now perceive the use my company is of to them both, better then [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] I did when we set out&#x2014;I furnish, as it were, the sugar and ginger which makes the alkali of the one and the tartaric acid of the other effervesce into a somewhat more agreeable draught for &#x2018;the <hi rend="italic">effervescing</hi> of these people&#x2019;!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;&#x2018;I&#x2019;m sure, the kindness of these people&#x2014;!&#x2019; (<foreign><hi rend="italic">vide supra</hi></foreign>)&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note).

So entirely <foreign><hi rend="italic">unheimlich</hi></foreign> [dismal] I felt myself that the day I got your letter I cried over it for two or three hours. In other more favourable circumstances I should have recognised the tone of sadness that ran all thro&#x2019; it, as the simple effect of a tiresome Journey and a doze of physic at the end, but read at Malvern with headach<supplied>[e]</supplied> and sleeplessness and <foreign>ennui</foreign> for interpreters!&#x2014; Alas what could I do but fling myself on my bed and cry myself sick. I said to myself you were no better than when you left me and all this absence was gone for nothing. I wanted to kiss you into something like cheerfulness and the length of a kingdom was betwixt us&#x2014;and if it had not&#x2014;the probabilities are that <hi rend="italic">with the best intentions</hi> I should have quarrelled with you rather.

This is a fair specimen of our talk at Malvern from dewy morn to balmy eve.</p>
<p>My procedure at Worcester (where we passed two days and whence I sent a newspaper) was unexpected and <hi rend="italic">disappointing</hi> in the extreme. I walked into the house of the illustrious Archdeacon, along a lengthy passage, down two steps into an antique looking drawing room or suit of drawingrooms; without giving proof of being anything out of the common&#x2014;I cast my <foreign>nota-bene</foreign> eyes over the man&#x2014;a large portly figure belonging to the rotund school&#x2014;the very <foreign>beau ideal</foreign> of an old Abbot&#x2014;with a countenance full of twinkling intelligence and gregarious good humour, having a high metallic tone of voice, and a whisking sudden<supplied>[n]</supplied>ess of movement accompanied by a peculiar fling of the coat-skirts which reminded me forcibly of the <hi rend="italic">Archivarius Lindhurst</hi><note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In E. T. A. Hoffman&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Goldne Topf</hi> (the &#x201C;Golden Pot&#x201D;) (see Carlyle&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XXII, 23&#x2013;114).

In vain the prim archdeaconian <hi rend="italic">Perpetua</hi> came at stated intervals to know &#x2018;if I wanted any thing&#x2019; receiving always for answer &#x201C;to be let alone&#x201D;&#x2014;and in vain the Whirlwind himself came at intervals not stated, to ask in a tone of deep tho&#x2019; loud pathos (for it was from outside the door) &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">if I <pb id="pg-09-301" n="09:301"/>believed that he</hi> was <hi rend="italic">exceedingly</hi> sorry,&#x201D; receiving also one unvarying answer &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Yes Yes</hi>&#x201D; My headach<supplied>[e]</supplied> refused to listen to the voice of either charmer till it had run its course. It was indeed a strange preternatural night the first I passed in <supplied>[t]</supplied>hat prebendary establishment, right under the stroke (it seemed to me) of the great Cathedral clock, which strikes even the quarters, haunted by the images of the large Archdeaconus and large pigeon pie I had seen below, and taken together had to my overexcited imagination a cast of magic! especially in the dead of night, with a rushlight dimly lighting the chamber and my head quite mistified [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] between this Worcester Archdeacon and the german Archivarius&#x2014;and could by no possibility <hi rend="italic">decide</hi> whether Archdeacon Singleton was not also the father of a green serpent and could make his face into a bronze knocker<supplied>[!]</supplied><note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;[See Hoffmann&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Novel</hi>]&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note).

<salute>Dear little Wife,</salute>
<p>On Monday there came no Newspaper, such as I had some hope of getting; but yesterday the wished-for token lay duly ready; not one Newspaper but two or indeed three; and all, I will persuade myself, is right. No longer is the poor Goody lodged in time of headache with Archivarius Lindhorsts,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Archdeacon Singleton at Worcester.</note> bejangled with the ding-dong of Cathedral bells; but safe in her own cell at Chelsea: home is home were it never so homely. God be thanked that nothing bad has befallen; that <pb id="pg-09-303" n="09:303"/>there is a near prospect of getting the ravelled threads of our little household knit together again! I suppose, after all your tribulations by the road, there will actually be some benefit traceable now that you are settled. It was the way last year when your journey was far ruder, your health far worse. I pray thee be well my little Goodykin; I will come and see almost instantly,&#x2014;whether thou be <hi rend="italic">firm</hi> at least!</p>
<p>There indeed lies the great question now, the sole prospect and result of all that I could write today: when am I purposing to come home? To embark on Wednesday next, by the first Steamboat there will be that week; we hope all to be on the waters then. My Mother is going with me to Manchester, as I said long ago; Alick too now proposes to accompany us, and take that opportunity of laying in his shop-merchandise: so <hi rend="italic">on this day week</hi>, if nothing prove adverse, we expect to be in Liverpool. Is that soon enough, or is it too soon? What the subsequent motions are to be cannot yet admit of prediction. Your Uncle, as perhaps I mentioned last time, insisted on my stopping to see the &#x201C;Scientific humbugs,&#x201D; who meet, I find, on Monday next.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The British Association for the Advancement of Science (see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18311021-TC-JAC-01"><sic>6:30</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1831-10-21">21 Oct. 1831</date></corr></ref>) held its annual week of meetings in Liverpool beginning <date when="1837-09-11">11 Sept.</date>, at which there were 1700 members.</note> I shall land naturally in the middle of their scientific week; and who knows but really I ought to take a look at them, even tho&#x2019; against the grain. My own feeling would lead me to rush directly from the Steamboat to the Railway, and having set my Mother down at Manchester to start next morning for London all at a stretch. But I must continue to <hi rend="italic">call</hi> at Liverpool; it would be an offence otherwise. I think of sending Alick and my Mother on, and waiting till next day with the Maryland people, at least till evening. In short it seems to me, O thou infatuated creature (so much better without me than with me) that I shall be home about Saturday night: thou canst see what thou wilt make of me! If I do <hi rend="italic">not</hi> get on Saturday, I shall send some Letter, explaining and predicting better. But on the whole, the thing, with Scientific meetings, with new Railways,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370702-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1837-07-02">2 July</date></ref>.</note> and what not, is got so complicated that I can at present say almost nothing; do not be alarmed therefore if in my hurry and confusion I cannot keep my day, nor even <hi rend="italic">announce</hi> farther that I cannot. According to my computation, the last chance of writing to London for Saturday may easily enough fall while I am on the Manchester and Liverpool Railway. But if you <hi rend="italic">do</hi> get a Newspaper on Saturday with <hi rend="italic">one</hi> stroke on it, <pb id="pg-09-304" n="09:304"/>take it as a sign that I intend to be there that night; at what hour no man can say.</p>
<p>As to my news, what health I am in, my dear Goody will see and know it all when I come. Probably I am at bottom very considerably better. Quieter I infallibly behove to be: no life so like being buried alive have I ever in my days led for so many weeks. It is a life totally blank, as if I had spent the whole time in one unbroken <supplied>[&#x201C;]</supplied><hi rend="italic">treaclesleep</hi>.&#x201D; Awakening out of which, what object have I in the world but my poor Goody to hasten to; my poor Goody! But I shall be quieter now; courage my <foreign>lassie</foreign>, let us march together stoutly, on such road as is given us. I fancy on the whole our prospects are much bettered; but we shall see: we can do with very bad prospects; we <hi rend="italic">have</hi> done with the worst. God help us, and teach us to help ourselves and one another.</p>
<p>I bought you a <hi rend="italic">Scots Worthies</hi> for four shillings; it was as if a kind of Letter that I sent to your unknown address that night at Annan. The Book will require to be bound; and is then quite legible, and presentable as a Scotch <foreign><hi rend="italic">Volksbuch</hi></foreign> [popular book]. Is it for the metallic Archivarius, or for whom?&#x2014; This little purchase; and two final bathings in the Solway: these literally are <hi rend="italic">all my news</hi>. Nothing happens here; nothing will happen till I awake again beside you. My Mother has had a Letter from Jack: he is still at Albano; encircled by approaching <hi rend="italic">cholera;</hi><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >By <date when="1837-09-03">3 Sept.</date> cholera had reached Albano and N of Rome. &#x201C;Lady Clare was amongst those who could not leave the country&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Annual Register</hi>, <date when="1837-00-00">1837</date>, p. 97).</note> has nevertheless engaged anew with her Ladyship till <date when="1838-05-00">May</date> next. Her Ladyship seems to me <hi rend="italic">suspect</hi> of want of <supplied>[wis]</supplied>dom. What quarantines she has undergone, what flights and stoppages; and here she has flown into the very throat of the thing avoided! Jack, I believe however, is wise to continue: he is fast gathering a purse, and will be able to take his own way by and by.&#x2014; Here is a little <foreign>Lass</foreign> &#x201C;gawn to Ecclefechan&#x201D;; by whom, as the day is wet, I must profit; and hasten.</p>
<p>Your Mother has sent a considerable &#x201C;Box of Sweets&#x201D;; which I think I must carry forward without opening it. She wrote me since you heard last, inquiring with great cheerfulness and heartiness, What day I would <hi rend="italic">come</hi>, and for a longer time? I was obliged to answer in the negative. They had made ready, she said, for a journey to Moffat; I was not to come during that. Probably the Liverpool friends will be returning about this very time. Mrs Creichton is still very poorly; Miss Fergus I think is now with her.&#x2014; My sister Jane is coming from <pb id="pg-09-305" n="09:305"/>Dumfries today to Annan; I could not go thither again, so she is coming hither. Mary and she are to come with their little ones probably tomorrow. Alick had a terrible fit the other night; I thought, of deadly inflammation: I found poor Jenny and him and the household in the saddest condition, and had to get a doctor and wait till midnight: but it is all right again and subdued now. Biliary disorders, cholera &#x26;c, are very frequent here at this season.</p>
<p>Good Goody to mind the <hi rend="italic">Argus</hi> and its criticism!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In the <hi rend="italic">Glasgow Argus</hi>, <date when="1837-08-28">28 Aug.</date>, <date when="1837-08-31">31 Aug.</date>, and <date when="1837-09-04">4 Sept.</date> They concluded that if the lessons of the French Revolution were not learnt &#x201C;let Mr. Carlyle furnish himself with note books: it may be his lot to write a second and more astounding &#x2018;history.&#x2019;&#x201D; They were apparently by neither Hunt (see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370922-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1837-09-22">22 Sept.</date></ref>).</note> I see, it is by Hunt, or Thornton Hunt (the style being diluted); it is well-aimed and dreadfully ill-printed, and will do very well: send the 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi> N<hi rend="italic">o</hi>, if you get it, to Rob Hanning&#x2019;s 7. Bank Street, Oldfield Road, Salford, Manchester,&#x2014;with <hi rend="italic">two strokes</hi> if you can. You said John Sterling would be home again on the <hi rend="italic"><date when="1837-09-12">tweth;</date></hi><note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370829-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1837-08-29">29 Aug.</date>]</ref></note> did it mean <hi rend="italic"><date when="1837-09-12">twelfth</date>?</hi> I will hope to see him; and shall rejoice greatly to do that. He is a very unsettled man indeed; and ought really to hang lead to himself if he could.&#x2014; There is no more room, nor time. My Mother sends kind regards and is &#x201C;right glad to hear that you are safe home again.&#x201D; I have said all that can be said as yet about my homecoming. O Goodykin mine, would I were there; safe in thy arms. <closer><salute>God keep thee, and forever bless thee, my good <foreign>Lassie</foreign>!</salute></closer></p>
<name>T. Carlyle</name>
<ps><p>There has not a word been said about provender, butter &#x26;c: all that is to be settled by Letter after I come; the <hi rend="italic">time</hi> for such produce is not arrived yet here.</p></ps>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Here is the <hi rend="italic">Atlas</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A Sunday paper begun <date when="1826-05-00">May 1826</date>.</note> with many thanks and apologies.

<p><salute>My dear Miss Wilson,&#x2014;</salute> I know not whether it can by any means be philosophically considered as other than an impertinence, my writing you a letter at present. Nevertheless finding your Address on the table, I do venture to announce in this manner that I have returned <pb id="pg-09-307" n="09:307"/>to Chelsea some days ago; that Eccleston Street and the Northwest House still stand entire so far as the eye can judge; that the climate here has grown delightful; that I and many friends think you ought to lose no time in coming back to it.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jane and Thomas Wilson were still at Malvern.</note> Our streets are cool, clean, and can be walked on without danger of life: London is become like Paradise, which the Frenchman says must surely &#x2018;be a village,&#x2019;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> so that all the people may see one another when they like! In a word, you are to come back, the sooner the welcomer.</p>
<p>My stay in Scotland was almost three months; the longest period of absolute idleness I can remember to have had. What benefit was in it we shall see. For a week or two, the very greenness of fields and trees, the rustle of winds and sound of genuine brooks was happiness to me. Afterwards it grew very stagnant, occasionally rather barelooking; all along it was of extreme sadness, but of perfect stillness. I did nothing, thought nothing, said almost nothing. Sun and sky are everywhere; and the vicissitudes of Time,&#x2014;fearful to behold. I felt in general extremely like a ghost; and dwelt too often, as Jean Paul says he and the woodpecker do, <hi rend="italic">in a scull</hi>.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> And now it is over: I left my Mother at Manchester, the last look of her face deeply abiding with me; and am here again, to see what farther it is that the Good Heavens and their kind Earth have in store for me.</p>
<p>The worst is, my wife is not well. She is again coughing somewhat; evidently in no strong way: Malvern and all friendliness of friends have availed little on that side. However I study not to alarm anybody; neither has she any cowardice about the matter; we will go on as I say &#x2018;doing our best and hoping our best.&#x2019;</p>
<p>I saw Frederick Elliot<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For Thomas Frederick Elliot, see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18311113-TC-JAC-01"><sic>6:49</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1831-11-13">13 Nov. 1831</date></corr></ref>.</note> the day before yesterday: brisk as ever; full of dainty speculation, speech and ingenuity: he is not to leave Town again. Taylor also was in his place, but just about departing for Dover with Miss Fenwick, who being shut out from Italy is to winter in that quarter. All this you most likely know better than I. Likewise that Mr. Maurice is to be wedded straightway to a sister-in-law of John Sterling&#x2019;s; and that John himself waits here to do the ceremony, and then fly off to Madeira? These little pieces of Biography are &#x2018;parts of Universal History,&#x2019; tho&#x2019; small ones; to us they have more interest than the greatest Waterloos far off.</p>
<p>People want me to write this or the other &#x2018;Article&#x2019;; I have yet <pb id="pg-09-308" n="09:308"/>begun nothing. My Wife says I must infallibly betake me to lecturing again on some subject or other next spring.</p>
<p>There will be &#x2018;popularity,&#x2019; there will be &#x26;c.&#x2014;&#x2014;. On the whole, it was a strange thing that Miss Wilson should have happened to find me in my bewilderment, and fling me forth into that arena; which really does promise better than the other would ever do! We shall see and try. But always, be the issue what it may, the goodness of that good guide remains with me, a possession which nothing can take away.</p>
<p>Knocks come to the door; I hope John Sterling&#x2019;s. I let you [letter torn] for this time. Excuse my hurried writing; excuse my writing at all&#x2014;come soon back to us. <closer><salute>Be well and happy till then, you and Mr. Wilson (to whom also our united regards); and believe me ever, Dear Miss Wilson, / Yours most truly,</salute></closer></p>
<name>T. Carlyle.</name>
<ps><p>My brother, writing from Albano near Rome where all is in the confusion panic and peril of cholera, he and his still safe,&#x2014;desires to be very kindly remembered to Mr. Wilson and you.</p></ps>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Your Letter to Jane dated <date when="1837-09-04">4<hi rend="italic">th</hi> Sept<hi rend="italic">r</hi></date> arrived here yesterday; the one to my Mother<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> was likewise duly received and read by me at Ecclefechan. The latter was pierced thro&#x2019; in two places, and appeared to have been fumigated; the Chelsea one of yesterday had escaped that formality. Communication being so obstructed, I lose not a day&#x2019;s time in sending my answer. You have me here with the top of the morning, in my old up-stairs establishment; I will tell you everything that I can call to mind.</p>
<p>That cholera business seems to be a very frightful one; the cholera itself, and then the precautions against it, and panic on account of it. Men are great blockheads and very miserable. Your last Letter is the true emblem of a country suffering dreadfully by Heaven&#x2019;s visitation, and still more by its own folly and frenzy. We <pb id="pg-09-309" n="09:309"/>remember well enough how it was in Dumfriesshire, yet with this difference in our favour, that village was not shut against village, and we had only the madness of Fear in an isolated inorganic shape. God preserve you, my dear Brother, in the middle of these perils! As I used to say for myself, Are we not at all times <hi rend="italic">near</hi> to Death; separated from it by a mere film? God will preserve us till our days and their work are done: therefore at least we will not live in bondage to the vile tyranny of Fear. Expose not yourself without duty to do; that is very clear: but with duty again, one will dread no exposure. And for the rest, hope and let us all hope that it will quickly pass. As for you, you had a call to go thither where you now are: the distinct call to go and seek your daily bread. As for the rest of your party, that, flying about at their will, have flown into the threat of such a danger,&#x2014;what can one do or say but pity them, but help them with all faculty one has? Would to Heaven it were well over for you all! I will not send this last Letter of yours to my Mother; but only some general abstract of it, drawn in my own way: she gets terror enough out of the Newspapers; in which no horrors of Palermo, no massacre of an Englishman at Rome is omitted.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Globe</hi>, <date when="1837-09-15">15 Sept.</date>, carried a report of the killing of George Houseal. Cholera was officially denied in Rome and cholera deaths were therefore popularly ascribed to &#x201C;poison&#x201D;; after he had touched a child in the street, he was attacked by the mob as a poisoner, and died of his wounds.</note> I will write to her today or tomorrow; and say that you were still well, that she must trust to Heaven for you still. But on the whole do not neglect, as you prescribe for us, to write and convey us assurance by all methods. How much were a weekly Newspaper worth at present! But we cannot get it; we must go on as we can without it: I will keep up what obstinate trust I can that nothing has befallen. And so no more of cholera.</p>
<p>I continued at Scotsbrig till Wednesday gone a week<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1837-09-13">13 Sept.</date></note> (this is Thursday); much in the old way till the last. Nothing had gone wrong, or had altered notably. Jamie was getting on with his harvest, with very tolerable prospects of crop, with good weather till the last week. He then in the dark rains had begun talking of the &#x201C;last three&#x201D; drowned harvests; but I think it is all altered now; there is a steady dry East-wind blowing here, which indicates drought for the whole Island. The potatoe-crop was excellent everywhere; a great blessing for the poor. Trade also seemed partially reviving. Alick had, some four or five weeks since, taken possession of the House at Ecclefechan, and was laying all flat with flagging &#x26;c: the day before my departure <pb id="pg-09-310" n="09:310"/>Jamie Aitken was there glazing, and the whole House lay open. In ten days more Alick calculated on being off for Manchester and Liverpool to buy goods. They seem all to think he has a fair kind of chance there; he himself is in full activity about it; doubtless much happier than he was. Jean and her child had come down to see us before my departure; then Aitken, as hinted, to fetch her back, and do Alick&#x2019;s glazing; he had a gig, and went off at nightfall of the Tuesday. The night when your Letter to my Mother came, I was at Alick&#x2019;s, and wanted yourself much there. I had walked over in the evening, understanding that Alick was a little unwell: some kind of cholic or &#x201C;British cholera&#x201D; which many people had, which Jamie for one had a two-days trial of. Poor Alick on my arrival lay not a little unwell, but very ill; crazy in utter delirium, his skin all red and hot, and nothing but pain confusion and contradiction to be got out of him. The house was all rubbish and disorder; poor Jenny alone, with two children at her feet and another on her arm. It was one of the ugliest scenes I ever saw. I dreaded violent inflammation of some sort; and on my own responsibility went directly for Simpson.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. Simpson; see <ref target="volume-04/lt-18281126-TC-JAC-01"><sic>4:419</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1828-11-26">26 Nov. 1828</date></corr></ref>.</note> A doctoring-bout followed; four hours work: but we learned that the delirium came partly from whiskey-punch which Jenny had remedially administered (as she confessed with tears) at the beginning of the business; Simpson&#x2019;s senna <hi rend="italic">et-ceteras</hi> did their duty; and next morning all danger was over. Alick at the time of my departure, and all of them, were quite well in health.&#x2014; But as I was saying we did bundle, my Mother and I, on the Wednesday morning, in a spitting East rain, and got under way for Annan and the Steamer, Alick driving us in one of Jamie&#x2019;s carts. Breakfast at Mary&#x2019;s: a most tidy, dextrous little creature Mary, her husband too one of the best-conditioned men: there is a speculation, I may say here, about getting them into Stenniebeck Farm<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-06/lt-18311204-TC-AC-01"><sic>6:61</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1831-12-04">4 Dec. 1831</date></corr></ref>.</note> this year; which I hope will take effect; I engaged to help, and you had already promised to help. Ben Nelson too accompanied us to the Jetty; we splashed on board, and said farewell. My Mother stood her voyage excellently; hurrying direct thro&#x2019; Liverpool next morning, we got to Hanning&#x2019;s to breakfast, and all was happily over. Our Mother is to stay there probably for a number of weeks; &#x201C;till she tire.&#x201D; Rob and she do very well together, tho&#x2019; he is as coarse a cub as I ever had to do with: kindly disposed, obliging, but coarse as hemp; I had all the difficulty possible to prevent him from calling me &#x201C;thou,&#x201D; &#x201C;will-<hi rend="italic">ta</hi>&#x201D; &#x26;c! My Mother looked sad enough when I <pb id="pg-09-311" n="09:311"/>went off, but behaved herself well; the last <foreign>wae</foreign> looks she had abide with me as such things do. She sent many blessings to you, and charges that I was to send her word when you wrote. My stay in Manchester was of some thirty hours: on the Friday night I got safe into the inside of a Coach (the same you came in), and with less flurry than usual, arrived here by omnibus, next night to tea; finding all clean and tight, a fire burning, and Jane hid behind the outer door to welcome me. I had been absent twelve weeks and some days.</p>
<p>So ends my travel&#x2019;s history<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Othello</hi>, I, iii.</note> for this season. I must gather myself together now, and see what I will do. There is surely more possibility for me than there was. Much has improved since my departure: yet unhappily there is one chief thing not right, my poor Jane&#x2019;s health. She had taken slightly to coughing again, ten days before I came; a phenomenon that saddened me much. Had there been no cholera in Italy I think I should almost have urged her to go and try it. As it is, she <supplied>[feels? no]</supplied> cowardice, no despondency; we will do the very best we can, and hope all things. I myself beli<supplied>[eve]</supplied> she is really grown stronger since we parted; this cough too has abated very visibly since my return. Having no <hi rend="italic">Book</hi> to write this year, I shall not feel so fretted, shall not fret any one: there will be a cheerfuller household than of old. What I am to do,&#x2014;except clean the Garden in the first place? Mill wants me to write him an Article on Walter Scott;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Memoirs of the Life of Scott,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">London and Westminster Review</hi>, XXVIII (<date when="1838-01-00">Jan. 1838</date>), 293&#x2013;345; collected as &#x201C;Sir Walter Scott,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XXIX, 22&#x2013;87.</note> most probably I shall do that: there is no promise in it, but also no prohibition: it will bring a few pounds into my pocket, and my hand in again. They are very desirous to have me write; but their Review is a most barren one, neither are they themselves fruitful. Seemingly my best money resource will be in new Lectures in the Spring season. To this I will sedulously turn myself, to see what is practicable, in good time. Meanwhile I am to be considered as a kind of successful man. The poor Book has done me real service; and in very truth has been abundantly reviewed and talked about and belauded: far more than I had any expectation of. Neither, apparently, is it yet done. There is last week a very high-toned thing in the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>,<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, <date when="1837-09-17">17 Sept.</date>, pp. 596&#x2013;98. Forster said of the style: &#x201C;consider it as the intense outpouring of the heart of a great thinker made in the manner of a soliloquy as of one thinking aloud.&#x201D; He continued the review in <date when="1837-10-01">1 Oct.</date>, pp. 629&#x2013;30. Forster&#x2019;s copy of the <hi rend="italic">French Revolution</hi>, with interesting marginalia noted on reading for the review, is in the Forster Collection (Victoria and Albert Museum).</note> which I have <pb id="pg-09-312" n="09:312"/>joyfully sent off to my Mother; I will also try to get you a Copy: the joy one has in the pleasure one&#x2019;s friends will have to read such things is the only legitimate joy belonging to them. Did you get the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> review I sent? There were since then three (very shallow, laudatory) articles in the <hi rend="italic">Glasgow Argus</hi> that I saw; several others that I heard of: on the whole, a well-received Book; <hi rend="italic">hands</hi>omely off one&#x2019;s hands; thank Heaven! The critic in that <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> is one Fo<supplied>[r]</supplied>ster as I learn, the man I gave liberty to think of Goethe whatsoever he reckoned fittest, a blustering <foreign>bubbly-jockish</foreign> [like a turkey] kind of man, from <hi rend="italic">whom</hi> surely I expected not praise.<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Forster (see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18320215-TC-GE-01"><sic>6:118</sic><corr>TC to GE, <date when="1832-02-15">15 Feb. 1836</date></corr></ref>), whom Carlyle did not yet know, though he had read some of his work (see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18360412-TC-JOST-01">TC to <sic>JS</sic><corr>JOST</corr>, [<date when="1836-04-12">12 April 1836</date>]</ref>). Carlyle&#x2019;s reference to Forster and Goethe is unexplained.</note> Let me lastly thank your unknown Scotch lady (of Mr Wright&#x2019;s Correspondents) for her eulogy; which surely is the highest of all.<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not in John&#x2019;s letter to Jane of <date when="1837-09-04">4 Sept.</date>; so presumably a reference to something in John&#x2019;s lost letter to his mother.</note> And now good-b&#x2019;ye to the Book; with gratitude to Heaven.&#x2014; John Sterling has indeed been in Bourdeaux, but is now here again with all his family! Wife and children are to stay with his Father; he himself the cholera excluding them from Italy is to winter in Madeira. He waits only till he have married Maurice; not to be for a fortnight or three weeks yet, everybody regretting that he should linger so long. I see him almost daily the good John; one of the welcomest sights any man could have. Mill is just going into Monmouthshire to rusticate; many Friends are still here, have returned hither, Miss Martineau &#x26;c; all of them very kind to us. Poor Mr Dunn is lying not well; the Wilsons are still in Worcestershire. I will trouble you with no more of them at present:&#x2014;for a reason that you may see.<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >He is near the end of his sheet.</note> O my dear Jack, take care of yourself, and pray Heaven the next Letter may bring us better news. We can do nothing more but wish and hope. The &#xa3;190 business was given in charge to James Aitken, who I doubt not, has transacted it before this: you will have above &#xa3;1000 in the Bank now; a thing <hi rend="italic">useful</hi>. Jane is down stairs, sewing table-covers, not much troubled today; some Mrs Crawford<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably the wife of John Crawfurd.</note> is to come and give her a drive in the sunshine: perhaps she may write you her own salutation. Now a Letter with the soonest. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign> dear Brother; may God keep you!&#x2014; Your ever affectionate&#x2014;</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle.</name></p>
<ps><p>Jane &#x201C;feels wearied&#x201D; today; desires me to send her love and say <pb id="pg-09-313" n="09:313"/>that next time she hopes to write a considerable postscript. We shall see.&#x2014; I should have told you there were manifold remembrances sent from Nelson and Graham. I had them both with me, to deepen the confusion, at Scotsbrig the night before I went off. Poor Ben could scarcely deliver his message for you with clear articulation; &#x201C;if ever you went thro&#x2019; Heidelberg&#x201D;&#x2014;he could say no more. He is sunk into great sorrow; which however he can cast behind him ever and anon. I believe a Letter from you would give him real satisfaction; tho&#x2019; he hardly looks for it. Grahame continued to the last stupid and kind. He <hi rend="italic">accomplished</hi> the bringing of Menzies<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-06/lt-18330329-TC-JAC-01"><sic>6:365</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1833-03-29">29 March 1833</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340518-TC-JAC-01"><sic>7:162</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1834-05-18">18 May 1834</date></corr></ref>.</note> to Scotsbrig! A dull glass-eyed reverend man, of great good humour, who talked and took his tea, without offence to any one. Clow of Land is off, near America we hope by this time. They had a rude passage across the Solway to begin with; I sent him a Note for Greig: all men wished him well.</p>
<p>I saw old Mrs Irving once at Annan: full of tears, of clatter, of curiosity and confusion; a melancholy wreck. Dixon<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Dickson.</note> saw [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] a little better. Poor Margaret (Ferguson) is dead at Liverpool.

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>It is yet hardly a week since we parted, and I am sending you a Letter: I know very well it will be welcome at any time; and my hand being still unoccupied with regular work, nay still more a Letter having just arrived from Rome, what better can I do than write even now this morning before setting to anything else?</p>
<p>There are no franks at present; therefore I cannot send you Jack&#x2019;s Letter, but must content myself with a summary. On the whole indeed I may also say there is nothing whatever in it except what we heard at Ecclefechan, together with the new assurance that our good Doctor still continues well and hearty, and is eagerly desirous to have me write to him. It is addressed to Jane here; the Doctor not knowing for certain whether I should have arrived yet. They have sad work with the cholera, especially with the absurd measures taken by his Holiness <hi rend="italic">against</hi> the cholera.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370812-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1837-08-12">12 Aug.</date></ref></note> You would see in the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> perhaps how a young man was massacred by the mob at Rome on suspicion of his meaning to poison the people and <hi rend="italic">infect</hi> them with this pestilence!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370921-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1837-09-21">21 Sept.</date></ref>, and the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, <date when="1837-09-10">10 Sept.</date>, p. 585.</note> Jack mentions the same anecdote; and adds that there is not a village but is shut up each against intercourse with the others; guards at the gate; strangers refused admittance; and all the natural hubbub, ignorant panic and confusion one can so well fancy in such a case. The best is, Jack is himself in good heart, with his whole party; and of opinion that the misery is past the worst. The weather he says is grown cooler, and not likely to be so hot again. They have <hi rend="italic">no</hi> cholera where he is in Albano; and suffer only from the stupidity and panic of the people, being restricted in their drives to the immediate neighbourhood of their own village. We must hope the best, dear Mother; and that the misery will pass soon, without hurt to those we love. I wrote to Jack yesterday, and sent him the last Number of the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, with strict charges to lose no time in writing. It is surely a wretched thing in Lady Clare to have flung herself <pb id="pg-09-315" n="09:315"/>right into the sphere of such a thing, after flying from it so long; as for Jack, poor fellow, he is seeking daily bread for himself, and was obliged to go.&#x2014; The only other news he writes, is a wish that Jane &#x201C;would seek him a wife,&#x201D; whereby his solitude might be lessened!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jack&#x2019;s friend Dr. Brunn (see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350216-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1835-02-16">16 Feb. 1835</date></ref>) was getting married and John had said: &#x201C;I wish I were out of such a prostrate worn out country as this is, and had some house and home of my own. If you could but procure me a good wife, something might perhaps yet be done!&#x201D;</note> We may calculate on some five weeks before we hear from him again: if aught were to go wrong, of course we should hear of it directly. We must trust always in One that has preserved us long.</p>
<p>That friday night, after leaving you all, we went prosperously on, with occasional showers; finally with a bright moonshiny night, thro&#x2019; pleasant country; the Coach sometimes left altogether to myself, then occasionally filled for a stage or two, but never so as to crush one. On the whole I got along with less suffering than usual; and was landed safely at the door next night between five and six; Jane waiting for me behind the door, and soon getting tea ready. She had not received the Newspaper; it had been too late, and did not arrive till next day. Your Manchester Newspaper I doubt would be in the same case, tho&#x2019; I did what was possible, and got it put into the very first office we passed. On the Monday I sent you another more authentic with two strokes on it. I despatched one of the same to Dumfries, to Annan and Ecclefechan and Templand. This is the first Letter I have written Northward yet. My news are not great hitherto: I found all well but one thing, the health of my poor Goody. She has a little cough again for the last ten days; not much, but yet far more than I want. It seems to abate perceptibly since I came back, and I think will ere long disappear; but it is an ill omen for commencing the winter with; it must lead us to take double and treble care, and first of all to let nothing fail for want of <hi rend="italic">flannel</hi>. She is in good heart otherwise, and I do think on the whole stouter than when I went. The new Servant has also been ailing; she was rather seriously ill, and very much frightened at it, while Jane was absent: she is now better again, but not understood to be without danger of relapses: Jane has taken the precaution of writing to Kirkcaldy, to the Fergusses there, so that she can have, in case of extremity, a new Scotch servant sent thence at a week&#x2019;s war<supplied>[ning.]</supplied> This one is a very good girl, I believe; and we have still good hope that she will be able to hold on.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ellen.</note> Before Martinmas (the best time for Kirkcaldy) it will be decided. Jane was <pb id="pg-09-316" n="09:316"/>very proud of her umbrella; and says, it is a thing &#x201C;to make one almost long for a rain to put it up in.&#x201D; I told her of the attempted purchase of dressing-gowns, and made her laugh at the failure. As for my <hi rend="italic">shoes</hi>, dear Mother, do not vex your heart another instant about them. I find the old ones can be soled again and will serve another year: nay the List <supplied>[selvage cloth]</supplied>-shoes themselves are so thick and warm there is hardly need of any other.&#x2014; As to myself, I am hardly out of the fever of my travels yet; but as I said the road did me less ill than usual; and were I once at work again, I shall be strong enough for anything required of me. Mill&#x2019;s people are wanting me much to give them an Article on Walter Scott: I have no great appetite for that, yet know not but I may do it; something or other I shall certainly fall to soon. But the Lectures, I suppose, will be the thing; I ought to make ready for <hi rend="italic">them</hi>. Meanwhile I find John Sterling here, and many friends; all kinder each than the other to me; with talk and locomotion the days pass cheerfully till I rest, and gird myself together again. They make a great talk about the Book; which seems to have succeeded in a far higher degree than I looked for. I have not got to Fraser yet to hear what his report is; but everybody is astonished at every other bodys being pleased with this wonderful performance! You would notice the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> criticism last week: it is said to be by one Fo<supplied>[r]</supplied>ster whom I do not know. The Glasgow <hi rend="italic">Argus</hi> was not by Hunt&#x2019;s son, nor I know not by whom. The next Examiner I will send sooner; you might forward them to Alick, or keep them till he come.&#x2014; Alas, dear Mother, I was interrupted at the top of the second page (at great length by John Sterling), and it is now clearly too late for this day&#x2019;s post! I will keep the sheet till tomorrow, and then finish. Jane says she will then write a postscript herself. Good night then my dear Mother. Oh me, how many things I would say, and have nothing but a miserable scrap to say them on! May the good Father, who knows all hearts, keep you always and comfort you in all your wayfarings! We shall meet, if it be His will, and not part again.</p>

<p><salute>My dear Mother,</salute> you know the saying &#x201C;it is not lost what a friend gets.&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. the Scots proverb &#x201C;it is not <foreign>tint</foreign> [lost], a Friend gets.&#x201D;</note> and in the present case it must comfort you for losing him&#x2014; Moreover you have others behind&#x2014;and I have only him&#x2014;only <pb id="pg-09-317" n="09:317"/>only him in the whole wide world to love me and take care of me&#x2014;poor little wretch that I am.

God bless you all&#x2014; If I am not strong enough this winter to go out in the rain I will make a slight drizzle with the shower-bath and stand under it with my fine new umbrella&#x2014;I will write you a letter all to yourself before long God willing<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;(<hi rend="italic">No room for signature</hi>) &#x2018;J.W.C.&#x2019;&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note).</note></p>

<p>[TC&#x2019;s postscript:]</p>
<p>Saturday morning.&#x2014;My dear Mother, this is the greatest dud of a letter I ever wrote; but you must take it for want of another. I hope the man will give it you tomorrow morning; then you will go and hear Gadsby<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Gadsby (<date when="1773-00-00">1773</date>&#x2013;<date when="1844-00-00">1844</date>), a strict and particular Baptist after whom the Gadsbyite Sect was named. He had been the preacher at Back Lane Chapel, Angel Meadow, Manchester, since <date when="1805-00-00">1805</date>; &#x201C;a rough and clownish-looking ribbon weaver. &#x2026; He preached in coarse brown coat and drab trousers, eschewed the title Reverend and instrumental music in chapel. &#x2026; He was a humorous and direct labourer who preached to labourers in their broad language.&#x201D; See Owen Chadwick, <hi rend="italic">The Victorian Church</hi>, part 1 (London, <date when="1966-00-00">1966</date>), p. 415. In fact Gadsby was ill with an attack of inflammation in <date when="1837-09-00">late Sept.</date> See also the Memoir in <hi rend="italic">Works of William Gadsby</hi> (London, <date when="1851-00-00">1851</date>), I, 5&#x2013;120.</note> with better appetite. I am going to clear out the Garden today; and then bethink me next week what <hi rend="italic">is</hi> to be done.</p>
<p>We have hard sunny Eastwind weather, which will dry all manner of <foreign>stooks</foreign>, and bring Jamie and the other Harvesters bravely thro&#x2019;. I find it still warm enough. Jane has brightened up the house in my absence, and made it all like a new pin. Also there is far more <hi rend="italic">money</hi> in it than I expected. Let us be thankful! About the beginning of the month I will try to send some Books. I will write again soon.</p>
<p>Mr Martin the minister of Kirkcaldy is dead.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370921-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1837-09-21">21 Sept.</date></ref></note></p>
<p>Jenny will hardly ever be able to make out all this. Give my love to her; take care of yourself and her; and let R. be a <foreign>douce</foreign> Goodman. Here ends.</p>

<p>A long gap occurs here;<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle had not found many of Jane&#x2019;s letters which we now have. These notes follow those for <ref target="volume-09/lt-18360730-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1836-07-30">30 July 1836</date>]</ref>.</note> nothing but a few bright frag<hi rend="italic">ts</hi> to kindle into visibility the oblivious darkness of 5 or 6 once busy years,&#x2014;busy enough to both of us, and heavy-laden with anxious emotion and continual endeavour, while they passed! I cannot find when her next visit; but mine, I know was to Annandale, in Autumn <date when="1837-00-00">1837</date>: I will note some of the main occurrences.</p>
<p>Early in <date when="1837-01-00">Jan<hi rend="italic">y</hi> 1837</date>, it must have been, when Book on <hi rend="italic">Fr</hi>h <hi rend="italic">Revolution</hi> was finished. I wrote the last paragr<hi rend="italic">h</hi> of it here (within a yard of where I now am), in Her presence, one ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi> after dinner, damp tepid kind of ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi>, still by daylight; read it to her (or left her to read it? probably with a &#x201C;Thank God, it is done, Jeannie!&#x201D;)&#x2014;and then walked out, up the Glo&#x2019;ster road Kensington way; don&#x2019;t remember coming back, or indeed anything of quite distinct for 3 or 4 months after. My tho<hi rend="italic">ts</hi> were by no means of exult<hi rend="italic">t</hi> character; pacifically gloomy rather, something of sullenly contemptuous in them, of clear hope (except in the &#x201C;desperate&#x201D; kind) not the smallest glimpse. I had said to her, perhaps that very day, &#x201C;I know not whether this Book is worth anything, nor what the world will do with it, or misdo, or entirely forbear to do (as is likeliest); but this I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> tell the world, you have not had, for 100 years, any Book that came more direct and flamingly sincere from the heart of a living man;&#x2014;do with it what you like, you &#x2014;&#x2014;!&#x201D; My poor little Jeannie and me, hasn&#x2019;t it nearly killed us both! This also I might have said had I liked for it was true. My health was much spoiled; hers too, by sympathy, and more than sympathy, by daily helping me to struggle with the intolerable load. I suppose, by this time our money too was near done; busy friends, the Wilsons pri<supplied>[n]</supplied>cipally, Miss Martineau and various hon<hi rend="italic">ble</hi> women, were clear that I ought now to lecture on &#x201C;German Literature,&#x201D; a sure financial card, they all said; and set to shaping, organising, and multifariously Consult<hi rend="italic">ng</hi> about the thing; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I, unwillingly enough, but seeing clearly that there was no other card in my hand at all, was obliged to let them do&#x2014; The Printing of F.R<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, push as I might, did not end till far on in <date when="1837-04-00">April</date>; &#x201C;Lectures,&#x201D; 6 of them, of wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I could form no image or conjecture beforehand, were to begin with <date when="1837-05-00">May</date>.</p>
<p>&#x2018;<date when="1837-05-01">Monday, May 1st, 3 p.m.</date> in Willis&#x2019;s Rooms&#x2019; is marked (by Nephew John, from <hi rend="italic">Abstract of Letters to Mother</hi>) as date of my first <hi rend="italic">Lecture</hi>. It was a sad planless jumble, as all these 6 were; but full enough of <pb id="pg-09-319" n="09:319"/>new matter, and of a furious determinat<hi rend="italic">n</hi> on the poor Lecturer&#x2019;s part not to break down. Plenty of incondite stuff, accordingly, there was; new, and in a strangely new dialect and tone: the audience intellig<hi rend="italic">t</hi>, partly fashionable, was very good to me; and seemed, in spite of the jumbled state of things, to feel it entertain<hi rend="italic">g</hi>, even interesting. I pitied myself, so agitated, terrified, driven desperate or furious! But found I had no remedy, necessity compelling:&#x2014;on the <hi rend="italic">proceeds</hi> we were financially safe for another year. That was my one sanct<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, in the sad enterprise.</p>
<p>Mrs Welsh from Templand, was certainly with us a second time at pres<hi rend="italic">t</hi>, tho&#x2019; I nowhere find it marked in writing: returning to dinner from that first <hi rend="italic">Monday&#x2019;s</hi> performance, I gave to my Darling &#x26; her, from some of the gold that had been handed me, a sovr<hi rend="italic">n</hi> each, &#x201C;to buy something with, as hansell of this novelty,&#x201D;&#x2014;wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> little gift created such pleasure in these generous Two, as is now pathetic to me and a kind of blessing to remember! When this second visit of our kind Mother&#x2019;s began, or how long it lasted, I have no recollect<hi rend="italic">n</hi>. Probably I left her here for Company,<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;[&#x2a;Yes (<hi rend="italic">Letter to Mother</hi>, No 133, <date when="1837-06-11">11 June 1837</date>); she was to stay &#x2018;till I returned,&#x2019; but that proved too long for <hi rend="italic">Her</hi>]&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s notes).</note> setting off for Annandale; whither I made all haste, impat<hi rend="italic">t</hi> for shelter and silence, so soon as the <foreign>hurlyburly</foreign> c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be got to end. One wish I had, Silence, silence!&#x2014; In the latter half of <date when="1837-06-00">June</date> (by Manch<hi rend="italic">r</hi> or how, is abolished for me) I certainly got thither. My health had suffered much by <hi rend="italic">Fr</hi>h <hi rend="italic">R</hi>n and its accompani<hi rend="italic">ts;</hi> especially in the later months, when I used to ask myself, Shall I ever actually get this savagely, cruel bus<hi rend="italic">ss</hi> flung off me, then, and be <hi rend="italic">rid</hi> of it? A hope wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> seemed almost incredible.</p>
<p>Mind and body were alike out of order with me; my nervous system must have been in a horrible state. I remember, in walking up from the Livr<hi rend="italic">pl</hi>-Annan Steamboat with Br<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Alick (what is still a luminous point, and nearly the sole one for many weeks thereab<hi rend="italic">ts</hi>), Alick had to call for a moment in some cottage at Landhead;<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >2 miles N of Annan; cf. <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi>, intro. I. Campbell, p. 350.</note> and I waited, leaning on the mile-stone, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I knew so well from my schooldays, and looking back towards Annan, and the unrivall<supplied>[ed]</supplied> prospect of sea and land wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> one commands there,&#x2014; Solway Sea to St Bees Head, and all the pretty Cumberland villages, towns, and swelling amp<supplied>[h]</supplied>itheatre of fertile plains and airy mount<hi rend="italic">ns</hi>, to me the <hi rend="italic">oldest</hi> in the world, and the loveliest,&#x2014;what a changed meaning in all that! Tartarus itself, and the pale Kingdoms of Dis, c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not have been more <hi rend="italic">preter</hi>natural to me; and I <hi rend="italic">felt</hi> that they c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not be more so. Most <pb id="pg-09-320" n="09:320"/>stern, gloomy sad; grand and yet terrible; steeped in woe!&#x2014; This was my humour while in Annandale; except riding down to Whinnyrigg<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >1 mile SE of Annan.</note> for a plunge in the sea (7 miles &#x26; back) daily, when it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> serve, I can recollect of nothing that I did then; all speech (except, doubtless, with my Mother) I did my utmost to avoid. Some Books I probably had,&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">Pickwick</hi> &#x26; <hi rend="italic">Johannes M&#xfc;ller</hi> (in strange combinat<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Pickwick</hi> the preferable to me!) I do partly recollect of here: but the reading of them was as a mere opiate. In this foul torpor, like flax thrown into the steeping-pool, I seem to have staid above two months, &#x2014;staid in fact till ashamed to stay longer. As for &#x201C;recovery,&#x201D; that had not yet consid<hi rend="italic">bly;</hi> in truth it never fairly came at all. The year before this (nay it was in <date when="1835-00-00">1835</date>, two years before) I noticed a faint mote immoveable, tho&#x2019; always on wing, flickering betw<hi rend="italic">n</hi> me and the page I was reading;&#x2014; a &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">musca volitans</hi></foreign>,&#x201D;<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Literally &#x201C;a fly on the wing.&#x201D;</note> as I aft<hi rend="italic">ds</hi> learned to call it; and there, disregarded now, but never long absent, it still flickers, and will. On the underlid of one eye, I also noticed, for long years coming, a cert<hi rend="italic">n</hi> tiny brown-yellow spot, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I nicknamed <hi rend="italic">Fr</hi>h <hi rend="italic">Rev</hi>n; and there, I suppose it might be noticed this day, except that I have long ceased shaving, and now never look. Enough, enough!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Of my Darling&#x2019;s beautiful recept<hi rend="italic">n</hi> of me when I did return, there was something said already; to me all speech of it is inadequate; for now, in my sad tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi>, it is like a little glimpse of Heaven, in this poor turbid Earth, I all-too unworthy of it; alas, how thrice unworthy!&#x2014; A day or two ago, I discover, crowded into my first Letter from Chelsea as her Postscript, these bright words, touching and strange to me, of the like purport!&#x2014; &#x2014; A little keepsake of an umbrella (no doubt the prettiest Dumfries w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> yield) had come along with me,&#x2014;wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I have now forgotten.</p></ps>

<p>Being a sending of more dialogue&#x2014;it were downright extravagance to send a letter as well&#x2014;so I shall merely say (your Father being <pb id="pg-09-321" n="09:321"/>sitting impatiently beating with his stick) that you are on no account to understand that by either of these Dialogean&#x2019;s I mean to shadow forth my own personality&#x2014;I think it not supurfluous [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] to give you this warning because I remember you talked of <hi rend="italic">Chicco&#x2019;s</hi> Philosophy of life as my philosophy of life which was a horrible Calumny&#x2014;</p>
<p>You can fancy how one must be hurried when your Father is in the case.</p>

<ps><p><title><hi rend="small-caps">Dialogue i</hi>.</title></p>
<p><title><hi rend="italic">The Bird and the Watch</hi>.</title></p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Watch</hi>. &#x2018;Chirp, chirp, chirp;&#x2019; what a weariness thou art with thy chirping! Does it never occur to thee, frivolous thing, that life is too short for being chirped away at this rate?</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Bird</hi>. Never. I am no philosopher, but just a plain canary-bird.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Watch</hi>. At all events, thou art a creature of time that hast been hatched, and that will surely die. And, such being the case, methinks thou art imperatively called upon to think more and to chirp less.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Bird</hi>. I &#x2018;called upon to think&#x2019;! How do you make that out? Will you be kind enough to specify how my condition would be improved by thought? Could thought procure me one grain of seed or one drop of water beyond what my mistress is pleased to give? Could it produce me one eighth of an inch, one hair&#x2019;s-breadth more room to move about in, or could it procure me to be hatched over again with better auspices, in fair green wood beneath the blue free sky? I imagine not. Certainly I never yet betook myself to thinking instead of singing, that I did not end in dashing wildly against the wires of my cage, with sure loss of feathers and at the peril of limb and life. No, no, Madam Gravity, in this very conditional world, depend upon it, he that thinks least will live the longest, and song is better than sense for carrying one handsomely along.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Watch</hi>. You confess, then, without a blush, that you have no other aim in existence than to kill time?</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Bird</hi>. Just so. If I were not always a killing of time, time, I can <pb id="pg-09-322" n="09:322"/>tell you, would speedily kill me. Heigh ho! I wish you had not interrupted me in my singing.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Watch</hi>. Thou sighest, &#x2018;Chico;&#x2019; there is a drop of bitterness at the bottom of this froth of levity. Confess the truth; thou art not without compunction as to thy course of life.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Bird</hi>. Indeed, but I am, though. It is for the Power that made me and placed me here to feel compunction, if any is to be felt. For me, I do but fulfil my destiny: in the appointing of it, I had no hand. It was with no consent of mine that I ever was hatched; for the blind instinct that led me to chip the shell, and so exchange my natural prison for one made with hands, can hardly be imputed to me as an act of volition; it was with no consent of mine that I was fated to live and move within the wires of a cage, where a fractured skull and broken wings are the result of all endeavour towards the blue infinite, nor yet was it with consent of mine that I was made to depend for subsistence, not on my own faculties and exertions, but on the bounty of a fickle mistress, who starves me at one time and surfeits me at another. Deeply from my inmost soul I have protested, and do and will protest against all this. If, then, the chirping with which I stave off sorrow and <foreign>ennui</foreign> be an offence to the would-be-wise, it is not I but Providence should bear the blame, having placed me in a condition where there is no alternative but to chirp or die, and at the same time made self-preservation the first instinct of all living things.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Watch</hi>. &#x2018;Unhappy Chico!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;The name was of my giving&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note).</note> not in thy circumstances, but in thyself lies the mean impediment over which thou canst not gain the mastery.&#x2019;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Goethe&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister</hi>&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note); cf. Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XXIII, 444.</note> The lot thou complainest of so petulantly is, with slight variation, the lot of all. Thou art not free? Tell me who is? Alas, my bird! Here sit prisoners; there also do prisoners sit. This world is all prison, the only difference for those who inhabit it being in the size and aspect of the cells; while some of these stand revealed in cold strong nakedness for what they really are, others are painted to look like sky overhead, and open country all around, but the bare and the painted walls are alike impassable, and fall away only at the coming of the Angel of Death.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Bird</hi>. With all due reverence for thy universal insight, picked up Heaven knows how, in spending thy days at the bottom of a dark fob, I must continue to think that the birds of the air, for example, are tolerably free; at least, they lead a stirring, pleasurable sort of <pb id="pg-09-323" n="09:323"/>life, which may well be called freedom in comparison with this of mine. Oh that, like them, I might skim the azure and hop among the boughs; that, like them, I might have a nest I could call my own, and a wife of my own choosing, that I might fly away from, the instant she wearied me! Would that the egg I was hatched from had been addled, or that I had perished while yet unfledged! I am weary of my life, especially since thou hast constituted thyself my spiritual adviser. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Ay de mi!</hi></foreign> But enough of this; it shall never be told that I died the death of Jenkin&#x2019;s hen.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Annandale comic proverb, originating I know not how&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note); but see TC&#x2019;s explanation in <ref target="volume-01/lt-18211002-TC-TM-01"><sic>1:385</sic><corr>TC to TM, <date when="1821-10-02">2 Oct. 1821</date></corr></ref>.</note> &#x2018;Chico, <foreign><hi rend="italic">point de faiblesse</hi></foreign> [no weakness].&#x2019;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;&#x2018;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Danton, point de</hi></foreign>,&#x2019; &#x26;c&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note); see Carlyle&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, IV, 259.</note></p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Watch</hi>. It were more like a Christian to say, &#x2018;Heaven be my strength.&#x2019;</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Bird</hi>. And pray what is a Christian? I have seen poets, philosophers, politicians, bluestockings, philanthropists, all sorts of notable people about my mistress; but no Christian, so far as I am aware.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Watch</hi>. Bird! thy spiritual darkness exceeds belief. What can I say to thee? I wish I could make thee wiser, better!</p> 
<p><hi rend="italic">Bird</hi>. If wishes were saws, I should request you to saw me a passage through those wires; but wishes being simply wishes, I desire to be let alone of them.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Watch</hi>. Good counsel at least is not to be rejected, and I give the best, wouldst thou but lay it to heart. Look around thee, Chico&#x2014;around and within. Ascertain, if thou canst, the main source of thy discontent, and towards the removal of that direct thy whole faculties and energies. Even should thy success prove incomplete, the very struggle will be productive of good. &#x2018;An evil,&#x2019; says a great German thinker, &#x2018;ceases to be an evil from the moment in which we begin to combat it.&#x2019;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified but cf. &#x201C;Chartism,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XXIX, 192, for Carlyle&#x2019;s use of the same thought.</note> Is it what you call loss of liberty that flings the darkest shadow over your soul? If so, you have only to take a correct and philosophical view of the subject instead of a democratic sentimental one, and you will find, as other captives have done, that there is more real freedom within the walls of a prison than in the distracting tumult without. Ah, Chico, in pining for the pleasures and excitements which lie beyond these wires, take also into account the perils and hardships. Think what the bird of the air has to suffer from the weather, from boys and beasts, and even from other birds. Storms and snares and <pb id="pg-09-324" n="09:324"/>unknown woes beset it at every turn, from all which you have been mercifully delivered in being once for all cooped up here.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Bird</hi>. There is one known woe, however, from which I have not been delivered in being cooped up here, and that is your absolute wisdom and impertinent interference, from which same I pray Heaven to take me with all convenient speed. If ever I attain to freedom, trust me, the very first use I shall make of it will be to fly where your solemn prosy tick shall not reach me any more for ever. Evil befall the hour when my mistress and your master took it into their heads to &#x2018;swear eternal friendship,&#x2019; and so occasion a juxtaposition betwixt us two which nature could never have meant.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Watch</hi>. My &#x2018;master&#x2019;? Thou imbecile. I own no master; rather am I his mistress, of whom thou speakest. Nothing can he do without appealing to me as to a second better conscience, and it is I who decide for him when he is incapable of deciding for himself. I say to him, It is time to go, and he goeth; or, There is time to stay, and he stayeth. Hardly is he awake of a morning when I tick authoritatively into his ear. &#x2018;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Levez-vous, monsieur! Vous avez des grandes choses &#xE0; faire;</hi></foreign>&#x2019;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;St. Simon (he of <date when="1825-00-00">1825</date>, n.b.!)&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note); see <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340526-JWC-TC-01"><sic>7:192</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1834-05-26">26 May 1834</date></corr></ref>.</note> and forthwith he gathers himself together to enjoy the light of a new day&#x2014;if no better may be. And is not every triumph he ever gained over natural indolence to be attributed to my often-repeated remonstrance, &#x2018;Work, for the night cometh&#x2019;?<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. John 9:4.</note> Ay, and when the night is come, and he lays himself down, I take my place at his bed-head, and, like the tenderest nurse, tick him to repose.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Bird</hi>. And suppose he neglected to wind thee up, or that thy main-spring chanced to snap? What would follow then? Would the world stand still in consequence? Would thy master&#x2014;for such he is to all intents and purposes&#x2014;lie for ever in bed expecting thy <foreign><hi rend="italic">Levez-vous</hi></foreign>? Would there be nothing in the wide universe besides thee to tell him what o&#x2019;clock it was? Impudent piece of mechanism!

A heart is a spontaneous, impulsive thing, which cannot, I would have thee know, be made to beat always at one measured rate for the good pleasure of any time-piece that ever was put together.

<p>This is the piece mentioned in <hi rend="italic">Sterling&#x2019;s Life</hi>, p. 304<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Now <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XI, 148&#x2013;49. Carlyle gave Sterling&#x2019;s letter to him of <date when="1837-11-16">16 Nov.</date> in which Sterling says: &#x201C;Tell Mrs. Carlyle that I have written since I have been here &#x26; am going to send to <hi rend="italic">Blackwood</hi> an humble imitation of her Watch &#x26; Canary Bird&#x2014;entitled The Suit of Armour &#x26; the Skeleton [<hi rend="italic">Blackwood&#x2019;s Magazine</hi>, XLIII (<date when="1838-02-00">Feb. 1838</date>), 161&#x2013;66]&#x2014; But I am conscious that I am far from having reached the depth &#x26; fulness of Despair &#x26; mockery which distinguish the original. But in truth there is a lightness of touch about her style which I hold to be invaluable&#x2014;where she makes hairstrokes I make blotches.&#x201D;</note> (he had seen it; I never did till now, she refusing me, as usual; nor did I know for certain that it was in existence still). &#x2018;Chico&#x2019; (<hi rend="italic">Tiny</hi>, in Spanish) was our canary bird, brought from Craigenputtoch hither on her knee. The &#x2018;Watch&#x2019; had been her mother&#x2019;s; it is now (<date when="1866-08-00">August, 1866</date>) her mother&#x2019;s niece&#x2019;s (Maggie Welsh&#x2019;s, for two months back). A &#x2018;Remonstrance,&#x2019; now placed here, is from the same &#x2018;Watch,&#x2019; probably several years later. Or perhaps this is the &#x2018;farther sending&#x2019; letter referred to in Letter No. 39 (<date when="1837-00-00">1837</date>) vaguely as in second bit of dialogue? No &#x2018;second&#x2019; otherwise, of any kind, is now discoverable. (<date when="1869-08-15">August 15, 1869</date>, my last day at present on this sad and sacred task.)&#x2014; T.

<p>What have I done to you, that you should dream of &#x2018;tearing out my inside&#x2019; and selling me away for an old song? Is your heart become hard as the nether millstone, that you overlook long familiarity and faithful service, to take up with the new-fangled gimcracks of the day? Did I ever play thee false? I have been driven with you, been galloped with you over the roughest roads; have been &#x2018;jolted&#x2019; as never watch was; and all this without &#x2018;sticking up&#x2019; a single time, or so much as lagging behind! Nay, once I remember (the devil surely possessed you at that moment) you pitched me out of your hand as though I had been a worthless pincushion; and even that unprecedented shock <pb id="pg-09-326" n="09:326"/>I sustained with unshaken nerves! Try any of your new favourites as you have tried me; send the little wretch you at present wear within your waistband smack against a deal floor, and if ever it stirred more in this world, I should think it little less than a miracle.</p>
<p>Bethink you then, misguided woman, while it is yet time! If not for my sake, for your own, do not complete your barbarous purpose. Let not a passing womanish fancy lead you from what has been the ruling principle of your life&#x2014;a detestation of shams and humbug. For, believe me, these little watches are arrant shams, if ever there was one. They are not watches so much as lockets with watch faces. The least rough handling puts them out of sorts; a jolt is fatal; they cost as much in repairs every year as their original price; and when they in their turn come to have their insides torn out, what have you left? Hardly gold enough to make a good-sized thimble.</p>
<p>But if you are deaf to all suggestions of common-sense, let sentiment plead for me in your breast. Remember how daintily you played with me in your childhood, deriving from my gold shine your first ideas of worldly splendour. Remember how, at a more advanced age, you longed for the possession of me and of a riding-habit and whip, as comprising all that was most desirable in life! And when at length your mother made me over to you, remember how feelingly (so feelingly that you shed tears) I brought home to your bosom the maxim of your favourite Goethe, &#x2018;The wished-for comes too late.&#x2019;<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Untraced.</note> And oh! for the sake of all these touching remembrances, cast me not off, to be dealt with in that shocking manner; but if, through the caprice of fashion, I am deemed no longer fit to be seen, make me a little pouch inside your dress, and I am a much mistaken watch if you do not admit in the long run that my solid merit is far above that of any half-dozen of these lilliputian upstarts.</p>
<p><closer><salute>And so, betwixt hope and fear, I remain,</salute></closer></p>
<closer><salute>Your dreadfully agitated /</salute></closer> <name>WATCH.</name>
<p>I find so much reason as well as pathos and natural eloquence in the above that I shall proceed no further with the proposed exchange.</p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>A second Letter has arrived from Jack, with better tidings rather than the last.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dated <date when="1837-09-20">20 Sept.</date></note> A Newspaper came about ten days ago, and was forwarded to you; I knew not very well whether you would understand what it meant, but fancied you might make out the date and <hi rend="italic">three</hi> strokes, and so sent it. Jack, in this new Letter, not only reports himself still well, but confirms the account we otherwise have <hi rend="italic">that the cholera at Rome is abating</hi>. The main mischief they still labour under seems to be the absurd notions and practices of the people in regard to it. But these of course will abate too, with the cause of them; and next Letter we will trust in all thankfulness to learn that the peril is altogether over. The two Letters both together have little in them beyond what the Ecclefechan one had, and their new dates and new successive assurance that our poor Doctor is well. I hope to get a frank today; and so will send them that you may read.</p>
<p>I wrote to Jamie at Scotsbrig last week<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> about sending us some butter and meal. Except the address of the Newspaper from Dumfries, I on my side have not had the slightest scrape of a pen out of Scotland. I study to keep hoping that all is well. I will beg <hi rend="italic">you</hi> however to get an old Newspaper of <hi rend="italic">any</hi> kind, directly on your receiving this, and address it to me, either yourself or Jenny and you; adding two strokes if the truth will permit: it will be a great satisfaction to me, till once you get the length of writing. The <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> back again will serve, if you have no other paper ready.</p>
<p>As for us we go on very quietly; not worse certainly than we were. It has taken me most of this time to <foreign><hi rend="italic">heft</hi></foreign> [accustom] myself again to my new <foreign><hi rend="italic">gang</hi></foreign> [surroundings], so wondrous is the change from Scotsbrig hither; I have <hi rend="italic">written</hi> nothing yet; neither indeed am I in haste to begin so long as I can help it; my poor wearied nerves are really, I believe, better employed <hi rend="italic">idling</hi> than in any other way while they still can. However the Life of Scott has now actually got the length of my table here; I must read it carefully over, and then <hi rend="italic">see!</hi> People <pb id="pg-09-328" n="09:328"/>all say &#x201C;How very much better you look!&#x201D; It is a way they have of talking; which I do not mind much: the grand improvement I trace is that of being far <hi rend="italic">calmer</hi> than I was; the immense <foreign><hi rend="italic">fuff</hi></foreign> [flurry] having subsided into composure. It is a blessed change.&#x2014; With respect to Jane, she is and must continue very weakly; but precaution will maintain her in a tolerable state: she has determined not to go out at all except in the middle of the day thro&#x2019; winter; and then oftener to <hi rend="italic">drive</hi> than to walk. Friends with carriages are ready enough to second her when she likes; or at worst one can have six miles of driving in an omnibus for a shilling. She sleeps a good deal better, she says, since I came; the cough I spoke of is nearly altogether gone: on the whole I find her improved; and will hopefully aid her to do the best she can. We heard from Mrs Welsh, very briefly; Mrs Crichton of Dabton, who was ill while I staid with you, is dead: all was now solitary at Templand, and unoccupied save with that.</p>
<p>I have seen most of my friends that are here; a good many are still roving about the country. All people are very good to me. Doubt not, dear Mother, I shall be able to do better now. I am better known now; have a far better chance. My Book has been abundantly reviewed, praised and discussed; Fraser also tells me it is steadfastly making way, imparting itself from hand to hand, and on the whole doing well: I may really say I have got handsomely rid of it. You saw the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> articles<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370921-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1837-09-21">21 Sept.</date></ref></note> doubtless; I think it will now be little matter whether they review it farther or not: reviewing they say does almost no good except in the way of announcing; the Book as Fraser says, has hitherto &#x201C;made its <hi rend="italic">own</hi> way.&#x201D; By way of final trial however, if it is to be final, I enclose you this copy of a Letter which came yesterday from an unknown Quakeress near Liverpool;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Phoebe Chorley (<date when="1801-00-00">1801</date>&#x2013;<date when="1863-00-00">63</date>), eldest child of John (d. <date when="1816-00-00">1816</date>) and Jane, born Wilkinson (d. <date when="1851-00-00">1851</date>) Chorley of Lancashire. According to her youngest brother, Henry, the family was only nominally Quaker. She and her mother lived in Liverpool, <date when="1820-00-00">1820</date>&#x2013;<date when="1845-00-00">45</date>, then moved to London to live with John Rutter Chorley in Chester Sq. Phoebe, a friend of Mrs. Gaskell, was crippled by a spinal disease about <date when="1850-00-00">1850</date>. Henry records that as children &#x201C;we invented names, and plays, and novels (my sister was a famous inventor, and much in request)&#x201D; and that later when crippled she was noted for her indomitable fortitude. See Henry G. Hewlett, <hi rend="italic">Henry Fothergill Chorley: Autobiography, Memoir, and Letters</hi> (London, <date when="1873-00-00">1873</date>), I, 5, 29, and II, 253&#x2013;54.</note> a very singular epistle: Jane will not let the original go, so takes the trouble of copying to save it.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See the <ref target="volume-09/lt-18371009-TC-MAC-01">following letter</ref>.</note> Do you not call that a warm reception?

<p>The best news is, that I have actually got, and do now wear a pair of carpet-shoes exactly of the sort you were seeking for me! Therefore seek you no more; except a pair of them for yourself. They are of black shag cloth, with three buttons, soft as wool; warm light and comfortable beyond anything I have ever had on of that kind. They cost but some 5 / 6 a pair out of the shops; mine were 9 /, being made to order, and of a much larger size, the generality being for women only. They are just the old snow-boots, without cork sole. Get a pair of them, dear Mother; I wish you to do it; and wear them within doors and without in the winter time.</p>
<p>Has Alick been with you? What is he, what are all of them, and you to begin with, doing? Jamies harvest must be happily over; the weather has been excellent. I wish Alick would write; he must write.</p>
<p>And what &#x201C;picture&#x201D; is this? Dear Mother, it is to buy you a little keg of ale, and some warm things thro&#x2019; the winter. The money that I gave you last you gave wholly away again, or almost wholly; it is a thing totally absurd: I beg you to accept this, and I insist upon it; and write me when you next take up the pen, not useless speech, but an account of all the warm clothing and furnishings Jenny and you have laid in by my order. A supply of ale I must insist on your getting when you go home again. Also I think you must rather go in the inside of the Coach than by the Steamer. It will be too cold and rough so late in the year.&#x2014; Give &#x201C;Jenny the Good&#x201D; &#xa3;1 of it from me.</p>
<p>What is Jenny doing? How does her health stand it?&#x2014;I know not when or from whom I am to look for a Letter. My kind love to all, south of the Solway or North. I will write again at latest when a Letter comes from Jack: let us hope it will be all well. Did you get a little packet of Magazines thro&#x2019; some Bookseller? They were sent, and must be in Manchester a week ago. In case they have <hi rend="italic">not</hi> arrived, <pb id="pg-09-330" n="09:330"/>Robert,<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jenny&#x2019;s husband.</note> by inquiring at any Bookshop what Bookseller it is that furnishes <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine</hi> (distributes it over Manchester, and is Fraser&#x2019;s Bookseller there), will discover where it is lying. But probably it is come, for it was well directed. Farewell dear Mother for today. I will see to get a frank. Jane has added a P.S. to her copy of the Letter. May Good and that only be with you all always! I am ever My dear Mother&#x2019;s</p>

<p>Thus to venture unbidden into thy presence may seem somewhat startling to thee in a woman, and member of the quiet, unobtrusive Society of Friends, but thou must thank the originality, the firstrate talent, the taste, the poetry of thy 3 wonderful volumes on the french Revolution for drawing on thee the infliction, it may be, or mere commonplace sentences, in my endeavour to express however inadequately the deep the unspeakable interest with which I am perusing thy admirable narrative of the Events which astonished and horrified the civilized world, 45 years ago</p>
<p>The style described to me before I saw the work as &#x201C;peculiar and uninviting&#x201D; I deem of all others calculated to convey the fervour, the fierceness and the atrocity alternately possessing the feelings of those the chief actors in that most sanguinary Drama. So perfectly graphic too, a Painter need desire no better study to improve his art. I can distinctly see the ancient Merovingian Kings on their Bullock Carts, and the Chamber of the dying Louis Quinze, with all its accompaniments, and <supplied>[the]</supplied> new Korff Berlin,<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <hi rend="italic">The French Revolution, Works</hi>, III, 168 ff.</note> and its wretched vaccillating Inmates&#x2014;the poor Queen issuing into the Street and lost there; Oh the breathless anxiety of that Journey, how one longed to speed them forward specially I think for <hi rend="italic">her</hi> sake, whose curse it was, in a new era, when the light broke thro the Cimmerian darkness of ages, to be united to a man of that mediocre sort which is incapable of reading the fiery Language of of [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] passing events, and yet not content to be wholly passive.

<salute>My dear James,</salute>
<p>The night before last, late after ten o&#x2019;clock, there came a single-knock to the door, a slow-rolling-vehicle having first been heard to pause on the street; a little stump of a man thereupon, after due formalities and the charge of 3/5, introduced a considerable deal-box with an address in your hand; and it contained&#x2014;the Pipes! All had come safe, not a tenth part of them, I think, injured; right good pipes, and the whole job very effectually managed. You have been very active and adroit; and I really am much obliged to you. The old Chelsea stock of pipes was within a dozen of being done, and most poor pipes they were in comparison: had the <hi rend="italic">half</hi> of those Glasgow <pb id="pg-09-334" n="09:334"/>ones been broken, I calculate it would still have been a good bargain for me.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably from William White, tobacco pipe maker, Gibson St., Glasgow.</note> As it is, the Box stands safe in an upper closet, and will furnish me for years, and always bring a kindly remembrance of you along with them. So note down the money they have cost you, that I may punctually defray it next time we meet; and for this and all your good management on my behalf accept my kind thanks. I have waited these two days in hopes of a Frank; but finding none, the Members being all out after partridges,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The partridge season began on <date when="1837-09-01">1 Sept.</date></note> I thank you by such means as there are.</p>
<p>My hope is that you may have succeeded as well about the Craigenputtoch house and the <foreign>burble</foreign> [confusion] <hi rend="italic">it</hi> seemed getting into. But in any case I beg you to manage as well as you can, and <hi rend="italic">keep it off me!</hi> I would gladly hear no farther tell of it. Indeed I can do nothing earthly in it that you cannot better do. For the rest as you are so accurate and skilful a man, there is another Craigenputtoch commission I will give you. It relates to the woods there. I believe they again stand in great need of cutting and sorting. Now there is a certain man, Laurie (John Laurie, I think, in Dunscore Parish)<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not further identified.</note> who was formerly employed in that way; and needs only to be spoken to again, and set agoing with full charge of the matter: Alick knows him, and Peter Austin; pray do you speak to him what is needful to be spoken, and see that the thing be <hi rend="italic">done</hi>. It pays its own expense and more; the time too I believe is not till spring; nevertheless as Laurie is in request, it will be good to engage him as soon as possible, for they say the necessity of the poor woods is pressing. I say no more, but leave you to <hi rend="italic">act;</hi> and make no doubt but you will do it with your usual success.</p>
<p>There have two Letters and a Newspaper come from the Doctor, the last about ten days ago. He is well, tho&#x2019; in bad circumstances as to place; the cholera prevailing over all that region, and what is still worse the people and their governors acting like madmen in their management of it. The mortality does not seem at all so great as it was with you; but the panic even greater, the very villages all shut up against each other, guards mounted, &#x26;c &#x26;c. Our Doctor seemed to keep up his heart perfectly, but was evidently in a confused element of things. The good news however was that the cholera had decidedly abated, which the Newspapers say it still continues to do; so that I wait with some trust to hear next time that our good Doctor is out of <pb id="pg-09-335" n="09:335"/>peril, and matters come round to their old course again. I despatched both the Letters to our Mother at Manchester, and got back from her, on urgent request, a Newspaper (in Jenny&#x2019;s hand) with <hi rend="italic">two strokes:</hi> this and your <hi rend="italic">Couriers</hi> are all the tidings I have yet had out of Scotland. I wrote to Jamie of Scotsbrig about meal and proviant; I have written twice to my Mother: I ask always what Alick is doing, but hear nothing yet.</p>
<p>My Goodwife was coughing and weakly when I arrived. There is now a perceptible improvement and the cough gone. She purposes to take all the precaution possible and to front the winter with hope and courage. As for me, I have been hitherto <supplied>[as]</supplied> unprofitable as ever. I read and talk more, but do not yet write any more, or <supplied>[not]</supplied> much more. My health is in its old way; sound at bott<supplied>[om]</supplied> but with perpetual superficial disturbances, dispiritments and so forth. The grand improvement I trace is a <hi rend="italic">determined internal composure;</hi> I say to myself in my worst moods, Well then, be it this way be it that and as bad as bad can be I will not fling myself into fury and struggle about it; let the Devil do his worst! &#x201C;Dinna <foreign>dad</foreign> tysel&#x2019; a <foreign>abreed</foreign> for them&#x201D;:<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech: &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t shake yourself to pieces for them.&#x201D;</note> this, Lizzy Herd&#x2019;s advice, seems to me the best that could be given. I regard that resolutely quiet mood I am got into as my chief good-symptom. No words can express to you the torturing fret I was sometimes in while busy with these old tasks. For the rest, I have some two or more things in my head, but nothing is yet got on the anvil, nothing is yet in a state to be spoken of. The <hi rend="italic">Book</hi> goes off famously, with praise far higher than need be, compliments from right and left. As one new instance, the Manager of Covent Garden Theatre has sent me a free-ticket to his boxes for this season. He is one Macready; I almost think he was in Dumfries once;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Macready had played in Dumfries in <date when="1813-00-00">1813</date>, <date when="1817-00-00">1817</date>, and <date when="1823-00-00">1823</date>.</note> a very clever and altogether respectable man; who is making a struggle this year to redeem the Theatre from that stupidity and degradation the system of puffery and baseness of all sorts had brought it into; and for this reason wishes to rally round him all manner of intelligent persons,&#x2014;the present writer among others!<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-09/lt-18371017-TC-WCM-01">TC to WCM, <date when="1837-10-17">17 Oct.</date></ref></note> I went last night, it was really very good (and soon done, if you <hi rend="italic">leave</hi> the Farce);<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle saw Beaumont and Fletcher&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">The Bridal</hi>, adapted by Macready and Knowles.

<p><pb id="pg-09-336" n="09:336"/>You see, dear James, how my paper serves me! There will be franks were the Parliament met.

<ps><p>Jane sends her best regards and wishes; her thanks for the good-intention of the <hi rend="italic">hair</hi>-machines;<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably some new device for curling hair; &#x201C;malisons,&#x201D; curses, thus &#x201C;cursed things.&#x201D;</note> I brought up what fragments of them were attainable, for a sign! But indeed when I think of the jingling and jumping of these <foreign><hi rend="italic">malisons</hi></foreign>, the wonder seems that anything whatever is got done,&#x2014;except indeed it were the setting of the house on fire.&#x2014; Would you like to see the London weekly Paper? Perhaps not, <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> tho&#x2019; it were. If <hi rend="italic">yes</hi>, I can arrange with my Mother when she comes back that you should have it always on Wednesday, and then send it to Scotsbrig or to Alick. But perhaps it were more <foreign><hi rend="italic">fash</hi></foreign> [trouble] than enough. I saw in the Courier poor old <hi rend="italic">Pate Irvin</hi>&#x2019;s death.<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Peter Irving (<date when="1765-00-00">1765</date>&#x2013;<date when="1837-00-00">1837</date>) had died on <date when="1837-10-04">4 Oct.</date> He had been the town Bellman of Ecclefechan for thirty years.</note> You did not know him, but Jean did. Poor old Pate! The last day I was in Ecclefechan his old white head met my eye; I gave him sixpence for a dram, thinking it might be the last time. He never had coin of mine before.

<salute>My dear Mill,</salute>
<p>Mr Robertson<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Robertson (d. <date when="1875-00-00">1875</date>), born in Aberdeen, succeeded Thomas Falconer as editor of the <hi rend="italic">London and Westminster Review</hi> in the spring of <date when="1837-00-00">1837</date> and remained as nominal editor until <date when="1840-00-00">1840</date>. Educated as a lawyer, he had previously worked for the <hi rend="italic">Morning Chronicle</hi>. For an account of Robertson&#x2019;s relation to Carlyle, see David Masson, <hi rend="italic">Memories of London in the &#x2019;Forties</hi> (Edinburgh and London, <date when="1908-00-00">1908</date>), pp. 4&#x2013;12, and Espinasse, pp. 124&#x2013;30.</note> and I have met twice or oftener: I find him a young man of sense and energy, good-natured, well-intentioned; I discern or augur much worth in him; I like especially the honest <hi rend="italic">laugh</hi> he has. &#x201C;Laughter,&#x201D; says Teufelsdr&#xF6;ckh, &#x201C;is the cipher-key of the whole man.&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi>, p. 33.</note> Whatsoever in years or experience this Editor of yours may want, he is of course daily getting added.</p>
<p>He has sent me <hi rend="italic">Scott</hi> long since, which I have attentively read; and seems very anxious that I should write upon it for next Number. It is a small enterprise; upon which, or rather upon the things involved in it and connected with it, I am now, according to agreement, to take <hi rend="italic">your</hi> decision. For the question with me is not, Scott or no Scott? but, To review or not to review? As to which there were very many things I could say to you in fit mood and circumstance: here however I will restrict myself to the essential.</p>
<p>Doubtless I have often told you how the Editorial world found it convenient to deal with me some five or six years ago. Today, work, work in breathless superfluity; tomorrow, whistled down the wind,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Othello</hi>, III, iii.</note> left to go and die if you like, you know not for what! It is one of the damnablest positions a man can find himself in. After some reflexion, I have resolved not to get into it again. I think I either ought to make some engagement of some permanence, we will say for a year; or not to intermeddle with the Periodical concern farther at all.</p>
<p>The thing I want to ask you therefore is, contrasting honestly in your mind my capabilities with the wants of your Enterprise, What is the utmost amount of employment (I mean money-amount, at so much per page, or otherwise reckoned on what principle you liked) your Review could afford me, say from this <date when="1837-12-00">December 1837</date> till the same date of <date when="1838-00-00">1838</date>? That is the first of all questions. If (which is very likely) you can promise <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi>, this Article only, and the rest on <pb id="pg-09-338" n="09:338"/>peradventure,&#x2014;then my decision must be also, at least till there come something pressing me for utterance thro&#x2019; this vehicle more than another, nothing. At present nothing presses me, nor is like to do it. God knows how much has already sunk into the dreariest frozen quiescence for want of some right vehicle of utterance; much that might perhaps still be resuscitated were it encouraged; which in a little time more will not be capable even of that! On the whole I have got a good piece of my mind uttered; and ought now to look about me whether I cannot find something to live upon withal. Nay this, by the great mercy of Heaven, is not such a problem as it once was with me here.</p>
<p>If, on the other hand, you answer Something; and your <hi rend="italic">maximum</hi> of wages will meet my <hi rend="italic">minimum</hi> of necessities, then I will joyfully say <hi rend="italic">Done</hi>, and set myself forthwith to perform, to see on what terms performance may be possible, may be useful and pleasant for all of us. I have that faith in Robertson and in his <hi rend="italic">laugh</hi> that I think we could go on lovingly. My whole tendencies, you long since know, are analagous enough to your own. My depth of Radicalism goes on without abatement; my aversion to Benthamism, to all Formulism, and indeed I am sorry to add to many hollow Formalists, with their barren jangling, their bigotry, vanity and &#x201C;vociferous platitude,&#x201D; who call themselves Radicals, has sensibly increased on nearer acquaintance. Farther I should desire, indeed I should need, to have if not my own choice of subjects, yet something very l<supplied>[ike]</supplied> that; also I doubt if I could stand much <hi rend="italic">editing!</hi> Yet withal I am not a wild Orson,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-06/lt-18311220-TC-JAC-01"><sic>6:72</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1831-12-20">20 Dec. 1831</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-06/lt-18330210-TC-JAC-01"><sic>320</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1833-02-10">10 Feb. 1833</date></corr></ref>.</note> but a tame reasonable man, who long above all things and aim henceforth to act not reasonably only but with a practical view.&#x2014; There are difficulties;&#x2014;which on the whole we will look at more straitly, and see how to <hi rend="italic">conquer</hi>, when your decision shall say they need to be <hi rend="italic">fronted</hi>.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle and Mill discussed this on <date when="1837-11-09">9 Nov.</date> when Mill explained the Review&#x2019;s difficult financial position and the impossibility of any long term agreement with Carlyle despite his strong desire for an article &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">every other No</hi>,&#x201D; (see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18371212-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1837-12-12">12 Dec.</date></ref>).</note></p>
<p>And now, my dear Mill, I will beg only one other thing of you: that you meditate this question not as my Friend but as the manager of your own Review; this with all freedom and singleness of view. It is really much the same to me how you decide. Important it will be this Yes or this No of yours; but whether the No will be good for me or the Yes will, I am content to leave to the Powers.</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>We have received some three <hi rend="italic">Diarios</hi>, two of them within the last ten days; likewise a Letter addressed to Jane, then a Letter to myself, both of which were forwarded to our Mother; and now finally there came yesterday a new more deliberate Letter to me,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dated at Albano, <date when="1837-10-18">18</date> and <date when="1837-10-23">23 Oct.</date></note> much longed for: whereupon I proceed without delay to answer. The <hi rend="italic">Diarios</hi> cost only one penny, and will even as I believe travel afterwards to Annandale <foreign>gratis</foreign>; we are always right glad to see them. I send them to our Mother (who now understands what they mean) generally the same day. The one with the three strokes, indicating that you are settled one way or another, will be especially welcome. We are all tolerably well, and you are all tolerably well; God be thanked for it: I hasten to communicate so much.</p>
<p>You have had a doleful confused time, in the midst of perils and distractions, such as we could easily conceive; it was very good of you never to let us be long without some token or tidings; and now we will rejoice the more that the <foreign>hurlyburly</foreign> is about over, and things returning to the old course again.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The cordons between villages were down, the harvests were good, and normal life had been resumed.</note> May the dulness of it never more be relieved in <hi rend="italic">that</hi> way! Danger of death is something, but the madness of mortals under base panic, storming round one, is more insupportable than any danger. We had a report here last week that cholera was in London too;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, <date when="1837-10-30">30 Oct.</date>, in Limehouse, a slum area of East London.</note> but the news did not take; indeed Cockneydom is too <hi rend="italic">busy</hi> to yield lightly to panic: so now it has been ascertained that there <hi rend="italic">is no</hi> cholera &#x201C;in Limehouse&#x201D; or elsewhere, but singular good-health for the season!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Reported in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, <date when="1837-11-01">1 Nov.</date></note> Cholera, as I used to tell the gabbling blockheads, holds nothing in it that the pitifullest catarrh, the fall of a rooftile, the breakdown of a hackney-coach may not hold: <hi rend="italic">Death</hi>, that is the utmost the crash of the whole solar and stellar system could bring on us; and to that we have been used six thousand years now, or nearly so. For the rest we will honour the Jesuit and other poor <pb id="pg-09-340" n="09:340"/>Priests; and pity the Monsignores and the Holiness of our Lord,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John had written: &#x201C;The Jesuits &#x26; Capuchins, by the way, behaved like men and Christians during the cholera, assisting the sick in every way &#x26; even helping to bury the dead. Two Cardinals <hi rend="italic">Odescalchi</hi> [Carlo (<date when="1785-00-00">1785</date>&#x2013;<date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>), cardinal since <date when="1823-00-00">1823</date>] and Micara [Louis (b. <date when="1775-00-00">1775</date>, a Capuchin, cardinal since <date when="1824-00-00">1824</date>] did the same, the rest with the Pope at their head shut themselves up in their palaces making all that entered fumigate themselves. &#x2026; Many of the physicians at Rome behaved very ill. Almost all the lower orders of the clergy behaved well.&#x201D;</note> to whom the faith of a common Russian soldier seems not to have been vouchsafed in this instance. But it was so at Dumfries too; only one clergyman durst enter their horror of a Hospital there,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The cholera hospital opened temporarily during the cholera epidemic of <date when="1832-00-00">1832</date>.</note> and he was an old Roman Catholic; Walter Dunlop<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Walter Dunlop (<date when="1775-00-00">1775</date>&#x2013;<date when="1846-00-00">1846</date>), minister of the Burgher Church, Buccleuch St., Dumfries, <date when="1810-00-00">1810</date>&#x2013;<date when="1845-00-00">45</date>; see also Robert Small, <hi rend="italic">History of the Congregations of the United Presbyterian Church</hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1904-00-00">1904</date>), I, 258.</note> carried it at length so far that he ventured on praying thro&#x2019; the window,&#x2014;with or without benefit. Well ended is well.</p>
<p>I have had two Letters from Scotland; almost simultaneous; from Alick and from Jean:<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alick&#x2019;s was dated <date when="1837-10-22">22 Oct.</date>; Jean&#x2019;s has not been found.</note> all is well; good harvest, handsomely got in; fair health, industry struggling on in the old wont. Alick&#x2019;s Letter was properly not from Scotland but from Manchester whither he had gone to buy goods; he wrote on the sunday and monday morning, and was to <hi rend="italic">open shop</hi> the Thursday following which was Michaelmas Market day! What success he had is yet to be learned. His Letter indicated hope and tolerable heart: the goods, especially of the Manchester sort, were as cheap as could be wished; perseverance and good guidance would force itself into some share of trade along with the others. Alick had thoroughly repaired both his own house and the rest,<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Owned by his mother at Ecclefechan.</note> especially (he said) had thoroughly <hi rend="italic">cleaned</hi> them, and taken measures for habits of cleanliness: what can we do but again hope that the poor fellow may do better than he has heretofore done, that his toiling, this time, may yield some fruit for him. By a Letter from Burnswark<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >From William Graham, not found.</note> two days ago I learn that our Half-brother John had got to New York, and shewn himself to Grahame&#x2019;s Brother, to whom I had got him a letter; by mistake and ill-luck he went off towards the interior, to Greig&#x2019;s probably, just when John Grahame had got a situation offered which would have suited the new Emigrant extremely well. We shall not doubt nevertheless but he will get thro&#x2019; <pb id="pg-09-341" n="09:341"/>handsomely enough some way, being a <foreign>shifty</foreign> steady man. No news of Clow yet. John Greig I think must never have <hi rend="italic">received</hi> my Letter about Alick.&#x2014; As to the rest, in Scotland, Jean reported all favourably as I say; her James had succeeded in getting me sent hither the most magnificent cargo of <hi rend="italic">Glasgow Pipes</hi>, which will serve me for years; a sort of Pipes not to be surpassed in the world! It was in answer to the thankful announcement of these that Jane wrote; Jamie added a few words, late at night, wearied &#x201C;making out accounts,&#x201D; and apparently much horrified with the death of Robespierre wherewith he had been summing up his day&#x2019;s labours. I was to send them instant word of you; which I must do, even should no frank be procurable. Our Mother has sent me two Newspapers from Manchester; in reply to two Letters, one containing both of yours, and to a cargo of Reviews and Magazines: Alick represented her as fully in her usual strength of health, comfortably <foreign><hi rend="italic">hefted</hi></foreign> [settled] in Rob&#x2019;s house, and minded to stay there in quiet till the shortest day were past; after which Jenny was to attend her into Annandale for a visit: all of which Alick seemed to think was judiciously arranged. I send her a Newspaper every monday. Tomorrow or next day I will delight her with your Letter; at least with an account of it in defect of frank privilege. Mrs Welsh was well when she wrote; the Mrs Crichton, whose death you noticed, <hi rend="italic">was</hi> she of Dabton: a sorrowful event that. Did you see since, that poor old <hi rend="italic">Pate Irvin</hi> of Ecclefechan was dead?<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mrs Crichton&#x2019;s death was reported in the <hi rend="italic">Dumfries Courier</hi>, <date when="1837-10-04">4 Oct.</date>, and Peter Irving&#x2019;s on <date when="1837-10-11">11 Oct.</date></note> I saw him with long white hair the last day I was there, and flung him sixpence to drink. Old Tipler Morrison<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> too I saw there; brisk and hale, tho&#x2019; considerably dimmed in the eyesight. Poor Ecclefechan! It was the saddest of all terrestial places for me. In fact, in the humour I was of, it more resembled vacant <hi rend="italic">Hades</hi> than an earthly place.</p>
<p>But we must to London now. Jane is decidedly better; this is the best news we have. Her cough has been gone these three or four weeks; she takes all manner of care, intends not to go out at all in the evening; has got a warm red-tartan dressing-gown for the room, fur-tippet for the street: on the whole, by means of such precaution and the quietest life we can give her, there is a prospect that she may get over this winter better than she has done any of the late ones. Irritability of temperament, general weakness; this and no specific affection of any organ seems to be her ailment. She reads, sews, writes a <pb id="pg-09-342" n="09:342"/>little, and does tolerably enough, the best she can. For myself there is little to be bragged of, but yet nothing specially to be complained of. I feel a great change in me, accomplished and going on; a state of humour in many points new, unnamed; of which in its present state it is above all unpleasant and useless to <hi rend="italic">speak</hi>. My life is full of sadness, streaked with wild gleamings of a very strange joy; but habitually sad enough. The dead seem as much my companions as the living; Death as much present with me as life. The only wise thing I can do is to <hi rend="italic">hold my tongue</hi> and see what will come of it. In regard to <hi rend="italic">temporals</hi>, I believe if I had these two Health and Impudence, I might make great way here; but having neither of them, one sees not so well how it will be. One knows not which may be <hi rend="italic">best</hi>. Alas, I trac<supplied>[e in]</supplied> myself such a devilish disposition on many sides, such abysses of self-conceit, disgust and insatia<supplied>[bil]</supplied>ity, I think many times it were better and safer I were kept <hi rend="italic">always</hi> sunk, pinched in the ice of poverty and obscurity, till Death quietly received me, and I were at rest! If you call this hypochondriacal, consider the unutterable discrepancy that lies in these two facts: a man becoming notable as a light or rush-light of his generation, and possessed of resources to serve him three or four months, without so much as an outlook beyond! I suppose I shall have to lecture again in Spring; God knows on what: no blessing in the world were dearer to me than that of being allowed to hold my peace now for a twelvemonth. If I had wings I would fly to Italy, I think, I would fly to Saturn; <hi rend="italic">some</hi>whither where I could be let alone. And yet, dear Jack, thro&#x2019; all this black welter of sorrow and imbecillity there is verily one glance of improvement very generally discernible: the deep, settled invincible determination I have got to <hi rend="italic">be at rest</hi>. In my saddest moment, I say, well then, we shall go to ruin, to death if thou wilt; but we will not rage about it, we will <hi rend="italic">rest</hi>, there will be rest <hi rend="italic">then</hi>. I hope, and really almost believe, there is the beginning of new life for me in this symptom, which is a deep and genuine one. But O why do I <hi rend="italic">talk</hi> of all this, even to thee? The day is foggy too, and I have a kind of cold, and in one ear a kind of deafness, extremely new and disagreeable to me. It will as heretofore prove far better than we think.&#x2014; In this mood, you may readily conjecture, I am not working much. I am reading, I am running about; as yet <hi rend="italic">doing</hi> nothing. There is a feeling in me that I ought to do nothing. Work, with the pen, is always as a fever to me; this I shun with a sort of shudder. Mill&#x2019;s W<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Scott stands on its basis yet; or rather <hi rend="italic">has</hi> come to an alternative, which I daily wait for the decision of. After great soliciting on the one side, opposed by deep reluctance <pb id="pg-09-343" n="09:343"/>indifference and even disgust on the other, I about a week ago wrote to Mill asking How much he would give me for contributing to him <hi rend="italic">for a year?</hi> He has not yet answered; being at Brighton, being probably at a loss what to answer. If he say &#xa3;200 (which will keep me living for a year), I will start not only with Scott but with a great many other things, despicable as they mostly seem to me; if he <hi rend="italic">say less</hi>, I will respond <foreign><hi rend="italic">&#xc0; la bonne heure</hi></foreign> [very well] then; and let his Radical and all manner of Periodical business take its own course for me.<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-09/lt-18371030-TC-JSM-01">TC to JSM, <date when="1837-10-30">30 Oct.</date></ref></note> Starvation <hi rend="italic">without it</hi> is at least better than with it, the beggarly <foreign><hi rend="italic">pluister</hi></foreign> [muddle] that it is. So I wait Mill&#x2019;s answer really <foreign><hi rend="italic">unbeschreiblich ruhig</hi></foreign> [indescribably calm]. Radicalism, as professed by that set of men, does little but disgust me; vain jangling, godless selfconceit, the spirit of a most barren delusion. Besides, in another point of view, I believe Lecturing, were I once girded up for it exclusively, has far greater capability in it now, very much greater; also if I ever <hi rend="italic">write</hi> again, I may do far better than sell my alcohol for small-beer by the Periodical gallon-measure in that way! So it shall be <hi rend="italic">either</hi> way, my Boy; and we will stand well prepared for it. There is better stuff in me still than a French <hi rend="italic">Revolution</hi>, if I have life to bring it out. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Festina lente</hi></foreign> [Hasten slowly]! We shall see.&#x2014; Meanwhile I get <hi rend="italic">praise</hi> enough, if that will do; Fraser says the Book is &#x201C;moving, moving&#x201D;: I suppose it has a long way to move yet, and that he has many copies; but I never asked him, indeed I rather avoid speaking or even thinking about that business.<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Frances Allen had written from North Wales on <date when="1837-10-31">31 Oct.</date> to Fanny Wedgwood that &#x201C;I have ordered Carlyle&#x2019;s French Rev. these 6 weeks but it is not yet arrived&#x2014; I have been very much struck by some extracts which the Examiner has given out of it&#x2014;and I feel impatient to get the work.&#x201D; She also felt &#x201C;more and more strengthened in my opinion that Teufesldroech is Coleridge&#x201D; (MS: University of Keele). Fraser had printed 1,000 copies.</note> The only real indisputable blessing I have got out of it is to <hi rend="italic">be</hi> done with it, in very deed done with it, never to be tortured with <hi rend="italic">it</hi> more! Nay I ought to add another blessing and benefit to the extent of about &#xa3;5 sterling: Macready the Manager of Covent Garden, a classical man wishing to banish the wild beasts and gather &#x201C;Intellect&#x201D; round him, has most unexpectedly sent me too a Free admission for the season; and I go some once a week hitherto to see some Shakspear notability or the like; really not without some enjoyment: last night we had Macbeth, deeply impressive in some parts, totally distracted in others. I skip the Farce<note n="15" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">The Parole of Honour</hi>.</note> and get home about eleven.

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I have waited two days for a frank, but not succeeding hitherto I will wait no longer; the news will be worth the postage to you: news from Jack, that he is well, and all well, and the cholera over at Rome! His Letter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1837-10-18">18 Oct.</date></note> came, as I say, two days ago, to that effect; written with much more appearance of composure and deliberation than the last two. He had been in Rome more than once with Lady Clare, seeking for lodgings there for the winter; with intention to remove thither about the end of last month: the Town, he said, was all composed again, the narrow streets cleaned out and white-washed, the weather bright and beautiful; the only trace of the pestilence was the greater quiet of the people, and the numerous black dresses you met. None of Jack&#x2019;s particular acquaintances had suffered; the madness and confusion was all gone. The poorer sets of Priests had uniformly behaved with courage, with heroism, in the business; two Cardinals also, one of whom habitually lives in his cell like the poorest of the poor:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John had said: &#x201C;Card<hi rend="italic">l</hi> Micara is here living at the Capuchin (his order&#x2019;s) convent like a common friar after the antique fashion.&#x201D;</note> the old Pope<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Gregory XVI (<date when="1765-00-00">1765</date>&#x2013;<date when="1846-00-00">1846</date>), Pope since <date when="1831-00-00">1831</date>.</note> and the other Cardinals, these with the upper classes generally had shewn the greatest cowardice. Jack had not yet fixed upon Lodgings to his mind; but expected to make it out in a day or two; and shortly after that they were to remove into Rome, and be settled for the winter. Whenever they got settled he was to send me an Italian Newspaper with <hi rend="italic">three</hi> strokes: this, if it be not lost by the way, I will take care to forward to you, and you will know what it means on seeing it.</p>
<p><title>&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;</title></p>
<p><salute>My dear Mother,&#x2014;</salute>Since I began writing, John Mill has come in, has taken me into the country for a long walk; and, before parting, undertaken to <hi rend="italic">get</hi> me a frank &#x201C;in a day or two.&#x201D; I will therefore break off abruptly from Jack and Rome, and instead of all description <hi rend="italic">send</hi> you the Letter itself; and proceed now forthwith to write about myself.</p>
<p>We are decidedly better than when I wrote formerly. Jane&#x2019;s <pb id="pg-09-346" n="09:346"/>cough is quite gone away for the present, indeed for these four or five weeks past; she has only her old now-and-then allowance of headaches to complain of; a kind of ailment which painful as it is we are more used to, and do not dislike so much. She is very feeble and delicate; but, being determined this winter to take every precaution, not to go out at all at nights, and so forth, she can hope to get thro&#x2019; perhaps a little more handsomely than usual rather than less so. This is a great care taken off me in some measure. She rises at present generally first, and makes the coffee herself; she sews, reads, writes, does not stir out in dangerous weather; and manages very peaceably, and not at all in bad spirits. Let us be thankful for it! At present we reckon ourselves in one of the very worst seasons of the year: cold fogs; &#x201C;London fogs,&#x201D; of which we had one instance yesterday: dirty frosty mists that pierce you to the bone, that are loaded too with <foreign>reek</foreign> and every black confusion: nevertheless she takes no harm as yet; we will go on hoping and endeavouring. I ought to add for your satisfaction that the <hi rend="italic">red tartan</hi> which last year officiated as a gown has this year been converted into its original object, a <hi rend="italic">dressing-gown</hi> and does now serve in that capacity, really one of the warmest snuggest looking things of the sort I have ever seen. I wish only farther that I could hear of <hi rend="italic">your</hi> having one precisely like it: I am sure it would be of great benefit and comfort to you. Take care of cold, you and Jenny! It is the root of all manner of maladies; especially at this season when one is not yet prepared for it.</p>
<p>As to me I have little to complain of in the way of health; the only thing at present is a kind of deafness or rather outward obstruction in the left ear; which I attribute to cold, caught as I came from Mr Dunn&#x2019;s one evening; a business not much above the <hi rend="italic">glass in the thumb</hi> I fancy, but which annoys me by its singularity. I will let it alone; to stay its time, and then go. By the way, in reference to that same <hi rend="italic">thumb</hi>, I should have told you last time that <hi rend="italic">it</hi> is got well now. The inflammation that was on it when I left you soon hardened into a little speck of <hi rend="italic">scab;</hi> which little speck in process of time peeled itself off, and sticking to it there was a little bit of glass about the bulk of a pin-head: this once out the whole difficulty was over. Might all the mischief that is in us but come out as cleverly!&#x2014; I have not yet written anything; I have been reading &#x26;c; I am occupied <hi rend="italic">scheming</hi> what course I am to strike into: it was not till today when I saw Mill (who has been in the country almost ever since I came) that I had the means of deciding whether I would write any more for his Review or not. But now in a few days I shall either <hi rend="italic">be</hi> actually writing, <pb id="pg-09-347" n="09:347"/>or have determined that I am not to write there; but set to work preparing for courses of Lectures, &#x26;c. The state I was in, all thro&#x2019; my visit to you, and am still in partly, was one that required rest more than anything; I am in some measure satisfied with myself that I can be quiet doing so little; doing nothing at all in the scribbling way. I had a pretty good fill of that.&#x2014; It seems to be settled at all rates that I am to try lecturing again. I hope to be better prepared for it than last year, and get thro&#x2019; it with less pain and more profit. We shall see, and try. Our friends are getting into Town again; and are all kind (the <hi rend="italic">half</hi>-friends <hi rend="italic">kinder</hi> than ever, if one minded them); we have quite enough of society, and might quite readily have too much.</p>
<p>A cargo of the choicest Glasgow Pipes arrived here several weeks ago, by the kind instrumentality of James Aitken: most welcome to me; and fit to be smoked with for the King&#x2019;s hundred!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unexplained.</note> I wrote to thank James; and had an immediate answer: they spoke of you and Manchester, how they had had a Newspaper one week without strokes, and were alarmed at it, but hoped it was only a mistake; I had heard better news thro&#x2019; Alick just about the same time. You should not forget your strokes, when there is authority for them! Also let no man, as some of you did, venture to send an <hi rend="italic">unstamped</hi> Newspaper; it is &#x201C;clean again law,&#x201D; and even justice: the &#x201C;Ladies Paper<supplied>[&#x201D;]</supplied> did indeed come without accident; but it might quite easily have foundered, and led to consequences.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle presumably means a newspaper that had not paid the stamp tax though since the tax&#x2019;s reduction in <date when="1836-00-00">1836</date> unstamped newspapers were less frequent. The &#x201C;Ladies Paper&#x201D; might be <hi rend="italic">The Lady&#x2019;s Magazine and Museum of Belles Lettres</hi> though it seems unlikely that it was an unstamped magazine.</note> As to any shape of a Letter, I suppose there is none such to be thought of for me, but my Mother&#x2019;s right hand has lost its cunning? Is it not so? Not it: a letter will come by and by, and that will be seen.&#x2014;&#x2014; By the bye I was to tell James Aitken and Jean straightway when there came satisfactory news from Jack: I wish Jenny or you would write to them forthwith, and say I bade you; which will be killing two birds with one stone. They had some plan about my sending <hi rend="italic">your</hi> frank (this letter, for instance) up to<hi rend="italic">them</hi>, that they might read it and then forward it by the same post; but I doubt greatly whether that would answer, and do not like to risk it.</p>
<p>Alick&#x2019;s Letter from Manchester<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1837-10-22">22 Oct.</date></note> was most welcome to me. He says, you are to stay over the short days; and that then Jenny will attend <pb id="pg-09-348" n="09:348"/>you back to Scotsbrig and see her friends there. I think it is a plan that will do very well indeed; my only advice to both of you in the meanwhile is to nestle close into the fireside, and study to be in good case for the spring and the voyage. You should get Books, get seams of woollen and linen; and on the whole be thankful that Manchester has coals in it, and is what it is.&#x2014; Alick&#x2019;s new enterprize must be commenced a fortnight ago; I would give something to know how it is prospering. I wrote to him directly to Ecclefechan; but have no answer, or news since that. He had repaired and cleared up all the premises, he said; he must do the very best he can; and we will all wish him right good speed. His Manchester goods seemed to have been bought on advantageous terms; there is evidently a chance for him as for others.</p>
<p>Grahame of Burnswark writes to me the other day that he has Letters from New York; that Cumberland John our Half-brother has got thither safe, and presented himself to John Grahame there, intending to go forward to Mr Greig&#x2019;s place. John Grahame had advised him to change his gold sovereigns (200 of them) into an American bank-bill, which would have been useful; but unfortunately our John seems to have taken up some suspicion against the proposal, and did not come back again at all; a thing the more to be regretted as John Grahame had the very next day found a situation for him as Farmer which would have suited completely. But there was no remedy: ten days had passed when he wrote, and the Emigrant had never shewn face again, but seemed to be gone his own road, with his sovereigns still all in gold. He will have more tumbling on that account; but there is little doubt he will do well ultimately.</p>
<p>Mrs Welsh wrote to us lately; there was also a Box that arrived from her the other night, by sea from Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, with seamstress articles for Jane. She is very lonely we fancy, now that her friends have all left her; still more now that Mrs Crichton of Dabton whom she used to be much about has been summoned out of the world. I know not whether you noticed her death in the Newspaper: she was a woman of much worth, but of an impatient indignant temper, of an untoward destiny, and had to suffer much in the world. There is nobody now about Templand with whom Mrs Welsh is intimate.</p>
<p>Our Barrel of Oatmeal has never come from Scotsbrig: it is the last of the foreign Packages we expect; Jane especially is impatient to see it, that we may have salt butter, that we may have porridge again, which last article failed us about a week ago. There seemed to be a blessing in poor Mary&#x2019;s <foreign>poke</foreign>; but it did run down at last.</p>
<p>I am getting fast on with my last page, and must draw to a conclusion <pb id="pg-09-349" n="09:349"/>now. I desire you to gather yourself together, dear Mother, and write to me so soon as may be. At all events send me a Newspaper when you get this; and let me know by some token from time to time that you are well: if indeed it so be that you are well; which in the absence of all light <hi rend="italic">pro</hi> or <hi rend="italic">con</hi>, I study always to believe. Take care of yourself, I say always! One of my chee<supplied>[rful]</supplied>lest thoughts about you is that you are <hi rend="italic">among people</hi> now; that you are <supplied>[in]</supplied> the way of cheerful speech and communication: it is not good to be alone. Old Gadsby<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370922-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1837-09-22">22 Sept.</date></ref></note> too, and his preachings, I regard as a true benefit. I have made several people stare here with my account of him.&#x2014; About the beginning of the month I will send you a Magazine or two again; it seems you got the last: they are worth little, but better than nothing. I send generally a Newspaper every Monday. The <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> is grown quite worthless comparatively; and I am trying about to see if I can find another; but I doubt whether aught will come of it, they seem all to be scandalously bad;&#x2014;at worst we will return to the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> again. You can send it on, to Alick or to Dumfries, in the course of the week; that as many as possible may get the good of it. I ought not to turn the leaf; yet here I am on the wrong side of it [with reference to the last page of the letter, on which the address is also written]. Jane is sewing beside me; with a kind of headache tonight; she sends you her love, has nothing more or she would send it. You have not opportunities to Annan or Annandale: I will beg to be affectionately remembered to little Missus,<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jenny.</note> whose health I will hope the best of; tell her to be diligent, to be cheerful, truthful, and good to her Goodman who is good to her. All good be with you dear Mother, and with all whom you love! I am ever&#x2014;<closer><salute>Your affectionate&#x2014;</salute></closer><name>T. Carlyle</name></p>
<ps><p><hi rend="italic">Friday Morning</hi>.&#x2014;I add a word to say that we are still well (all but Jane&#x2019;s headache) before sealing. Do not forget the message to James Aitken. Do not forget to keep yourself warm and snug! Jane bids me say that our maid-servant is now well and doing well; &#x201C;you will be fretting yourself about that.&#x201D; We heard nothing of Queen Victoria and her dinner yesterday except the jowling of the bells.<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On <date when="1837-11-09">9 Nov.</date> Queen Victoria made a state visit to the city. The <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, <date when="1837-11-10">10 Nov.</date>, carried three pages of description of the procession through the city and the Queen&#x2019;s reception by the people, the state banquet at Guildhall, and the street illuminations. George Grote was among the banquet guests.</note></p>
<p>I have written to Jack; I can yet find no conveyance for the Book to him. He will have the <hi rend="italic">sheets</hi> I suppose by this time; and may read it in that state. Be well, and let me hear that you are well, dear Mother!</p></ps>

<salute>My dear Mill,</salute>
<p>Here is the Letter you consented to take charge of. The scratch of an Honourable Member&#x2019;s pen will make a heart glad on the morrow this time; more than can be always said of Members&#x2019; pens.</p>
<p>In reference to what we talked of yesterday, I answer that for the present it seems to me I must <hi rend="italic">do</hi> this Life of Scott, and leave the rest to take what settlement it can. Pray send me the First volume therefore; I have all the rest hitherto published: I mean to begin on Monday morning.&#x2014; If you chanced to fall into any possibility of getting me these Books of Crockett&#x2019;s they would be very welcome to me; I am not sure but something good might be made of them.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In a letter to John Robertson dated by Mineka <date when="1837-11-11">11 Nov.</date>, Mill wrote: &#x201C;To my great satisfaction Carlyle consents to do at least the Scott, and wishes to begin on Monday morning. &#x2026; He has also a great wish to have the two books of and about Colonel Crockett, and I think has a &#x2018;month&#x2019;s mind&#x2019; to write about them&#x201D; (Mineka, XII, 357). David Crockett (<date when="1786-00-00">1786</date>&#x2013;<date when="1836-00-00">1836</date>).

<p>Pray come back soon, and let us have some speech; there pass many days without one day in them so good as yesterday. Wherefore? Therefore!&#x2014;</p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>The Italians have a saying &#x201C;round as the O of&#x201D; &#x2014;some Painter, who dashed one off very round indeed at one stroke of his brush. Can you <pb id="pg-09-351" n="09:351"/>tell me the Painter&#x2019;s name?

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Tonight I have a few minutes to myself; and feel that I ought certainly to write to some of you, tho&#x2019; in no good trim for such an enterprise. I will do it before the time slip. A line as short as I like; for there are franks now.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-09-352" n="09:352"/>We had word from Jack something like a fortnight ago, that the cholera was over at Rome, and they all safe out of many perils and distresses. There has been a dreadful panic and confusion over all that region: I forget the number of deaths, which was great; but the cowardly selfishness and cruelty of men given up to terror, as nearly <hi rend="italic">all</hi> but the poorer kind of Priests there were, seems to have <supplied>[been]</supplied> even more dreadful than the pestilence. No doubt Jack and the rest are right glad that is done. They were about removing into Rome for the winter just at the time I wrote; and since that, there has come a Roman Newspaper with the <hi rend="italic">mark</hi> on it which Jack had appointed to signify that their removal was effectuated. I sent on this Newspaper to Jean at Dumfries; who I hope received as a good token, and understood what it signified in some measure. The Letter itself I had previously despatched to Manchester, with strait injunctions that they should convey some extract of it over to the Scotch side; but whether this was done I have no means hitherto of knowing. At a still more early date, Mrs Welsh to whom Jane was writing, had some message entrusted to her for Jean: so that I hope, one way or another, you were pretty soon apprised of the good news. Jack writes this time with far greater composure, and seems quite in his old way again. He did not expect much from Roman practice this winter, but was minded to try. He thought it likely they might be returning to England about <date when="1838-05-00">May</date> next; that is to say, &#x2019;bating <hi rend="italic">changes</hi>, which however seem to be very frequent with them.</p>
<p>Since that message was sent off to Manchester, we have a Letter thence from Jenny and my Mother; which if there be room in this cover, I will inclose for you; perhaps your own tidings from that quarter are rather scanty. There was nothing but favourable news; all quiet and well; Mother not to return till Spring, and Jenny coming with her, as your Letter too had indicated. Hanning, it seems, had been over with you; helping you to set the shop in order! He reported favourable augury of everything; may it all turn out so! I long extremely to hear how you get on; how you like it, how you manage in it, what your own prognostics of it are. Do not feel discouraged at first, nor over-annoyed with the <hi rend="italic">new</hi> kind of difficulties; in every new vocation there is a quite new set of difficulties, which we are apt to think worse than the old: but one gets to <hi rend="italic">fit the harness</hi> better by and by; and also new capabilities rise up in the enterprise itself; all enterprises must have time to <hi rend="italic">spring</hi> before they can <hi rend="italic">grow</hi>. Go on and prosper, my dear Brother! You have had a long tract of <hi rend="italic">dirtyish</hi> road; <pb id="pg-09-353" n="09:353"/>but they say, it is a long lane that has <hi rend="italic">no</hi> turn. As long as one does not lose heart and lose head, there is probably nothing lost.</p>
<p>In the Manchester Letter, it was farther mentioned that the Scotsbrig Barrel had been sent off &#x201C;a fortnight before&#x201D;; so that our expectations of it directly mounted high. In some three days more they were gratified, the Barrel actually came groaning along in the big Pickford Waggon, and was safely carried in! All safe; seemingly not the smallest thing damaged: the cost of carriage in all, 11/6. I recognised your handwriting on the address; with my joiner tools (a very poor stock now) I got off the girds, out the end: lo, Parcels not a few from the new shop! We opened them with smiles, very glad and serious: many thanks to little Jane from her Aunt, to Jenny, and all of you! Jane takes of her &#x201C;peppers&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Peppermints.</note> from time to time, and has determined to make the eminent piece of flannel into a &#x201C;bed-gown,&#x201D; whatever that may be: I have tried my tobacco, and locked it by safe till what I otherwise have be done; with intent to &#x201C;smoke&#x201D; it then, and &#x201C;think&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-05/lt-18300615-TC-HI-01"><sic>5:115</sic><corr>TC to HI, <date when="1830-06-15">15 June 1830</date></corr></ref>.</note> of many things.&#x2014; If I have no time tonight to write to Jamie (as I ought to do) pray tell him and Isabella of this. The meal is equal to any I have ever tasted; unsurpassable meal. The Butter on the very top where we yet are has a <hi rend="italic">mealy</hi> taste; but we make no doubt it will be excellent were we down a little.</p>
<p>This I think is almost all the <hi rend="italic">indispensable</hi> announcements I had to make. How many more are the things I would speak of, ask and tell, if I had you here! Poor Annandale, birthland, and home of my loved ones, is an inexhaustible topic. My Mother tells me, poor John Minto is dead.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified; see also <ref target="volume-09/lt-18371212-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1837-12-12">12 Dec.</date></ref></note> Last week but one I read with a great shock the death of James Johnston at Haddington!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle wrote in his <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi>, <date when="1837-12-07">7 Dec</date>: &#x201C;Poor James Johnston, as I read lately in the Dumfries Paper [<hi rend="italic">Courier</hi>, <date when="1837-11-15">15 Nov.</date>] quite unexpectedly, is dead. Ah me! He was the first friend, or among the first, I had in the world; a most worthy guileless man. Latterly we got drifted asunder; he towards quiet creeks, I into rough seas. I saw him last when we were last in Edinburgh: he came and staid a night with us, one Saturday. On the Sunday afternoon (I think) at the end of Princes Street I saw him on the top of his Coach, a cousin of his wife&#x2019;s with him; and he rolled away from me&#x2014;forever? &#x2026; Johnston&#x2019;s wife too is dead; poor Jenny: she was a friend of my Sister&#x2019;s who now also rests.&#x2014;&#x201D;</note> I had not heard a whisper that he was unwell; I have sent him several Newspapers since I came here first, but never got any return; I always meant to write, but now it is too late. Ah me, I feel very much often as if I myself were not alive <pb id="pg-09-354" n="09:354"/>but become a kind of half-ghost! No one of you can know what a strange half-dead humour that long struggle had left me in; what a stupid piece of rubbish I used to feel myself; nor is it nearly over yet, tho&#x2019; on the way towards being over. But you were all very good to me, while I went <hi rend="italic">hunching</hi> about there: God knows I had need of rest somewhere or other.</p>
<p>As to procedure and fortune here I have still cause to report favourable things. Jane&#x2019;s health, by virtue of great precaution, continues <hi rend="italic">much</hi> better than I once anticipated: in fact she is as well as I have seen her for several years: this too is reckoned one of the trying months. My own poor carcase again is not in good order at all; a degree or so below <hi rend="italic">average</hi> order.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle had written in his <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi>, <date when="1837-11-15">15 Nov.</date>: &#x201C;I am dyspeptic even more than usual; I have cold also, and am in a new cold room (the back one, down stairs), am deaf in the left ear (the left eye has had a speck in it for many months); in short am an altogether wrecked individual.&#x201D;</note> &#x201C;The steam is not yet up,&#x201D; that is it; I am not struggling, like one quenching fire this winter, but suffering for having done that so long: a dirty kind of general cold works about me (the weather frost-foggy &#x26;c); and for the present has settled mainly in one of my <hi rend="italic">ears;</hi> producing not absolute deafness in it, but a queer disagreeable obstruction of hearing on that side. I study to be <hi rend="italic">quiet;</hi> in fact, I am far quieter, I hope, than I ever before was. At bottom probably I am distinctly <hi rend="italic">better</hi> than last year: nay for that matter, I could soon &#x201C;get up the steam&#x201D; again, and feel as well and happy as I then was: but I shudder at such &#x201C;happiness,&#x201D; knowing what will follow it.&#x2014; Meanwhile, for one thing, I am busy over head and ears again, writing an Article! It is on <hi rend="italic">Walter Scott</hi>, for the London Review; you will see it by and by. I <hi rend="italic">study</hi> really to write it with as <hi rend="italic">little</hi> care as possible; yet it bothers me in my present stupid state. It will be worth <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> or next to that,&#x2014;except indeed to <hi rend="italic">me</hi> so many pounds as there are pages in it.&#x2014; For all the rest, Book, people &#x26;c, it goes well with me. I rejoice very considerably in the Book; and think very often, among other considerations, well, <hi rend="italic">that</hi> cannot plague me any more. I am not a galleyslave now but free. People come about me, fully as much as I want; a little more, and one would be obliged to take his bolt and bar! But indeed they are quite a superior kind of people hitherto for most part; and gather round me not a lion but as a man worthy of some regard from them. Some say I must deliver Lectures this year on the French Revolution; that would be a subject! They really do talk of it. We shall see, when this Article is done; that is, in a fortnight hence or so; it is more than half-way already. Something <pb id="pg-09-355" n="09:355"/>I must lecture on, and struggle for a little money;&#x2014;and then cower away some whither, and lie quiet and rest for a long time!</p>
<p>I must end, dear Alick, for here is the porridge; and writing <hi rend="italic">after</hi> takes away sleep. Tell all of them my news, give all of them my love. I finish out tomorrow morning. Good night, dear Brother!&#x2014;</p>
<p><date when="1837-11-27">27<hi rend="italic">th</hi></date> (Monday) near two o&#x2019;clock.&#x2014; My task is about done for this day; I will add a word before going out. Give my affection to all. Were this article once done, I will write again to some of you; probably to Dumfries. There was a talk of Austin being got into Stenniebeck&#x2019;s farm.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370921-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1837-09-21">21 Sept.</date></ref></note> I pray you do not neglect this. I said something to my Mother about it which she will mention at the right time. I should like much to see it done: Jamie of Scotsbrig regarded it as very possible.&#x2014; No more at present. Jane <supplied>[sends h]</supplied>er love to you all, great and little. <closer><salute>Bear a hand my brave brother; write to me; and m<supplied>[ay]</supplied> God bless you all!&#x2014; Your affectionate</salute></closer></p>

<ps><p>I enclose a Portrait of Queen Victoria poor little thing, whom I have never seen yet; they say it is as like her as another. It will need pasting together at the edges (the edging will); it was too big to go into the letter,&#x2014;&#x2014;or lo, Jane has done it with no need of pasting!</p></ps>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Jenny&#x2019;s Letters and yours came in due course;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> and right welcome it was, and told me much I was anxious to know. I like very well your staying where you are till the sun get out again. They are dead days these at Scotsbrig in all senses; so dark, so motionless, so <foreign><hi rend="italic">clarty</hi></foreign> [dirty] and cheerless: you will be warmer and livelier where you are. Do not venture out too much, however, even in Manchester; not without good wrappage, and your mud-shoes on! It is full of fog, damp frost, <foreign>reek</foreign> and <foreign><hi rend="italic">glar</hi></foreign> [mud]: be thankful that you are on the outer skirt of it. And so let Jenny <hi rend="italic">marble</hi> her hearth, scour the grate bright, and put a good fire in it; while Robert like a brisk man goes his <foreign>gates</foreign> [journeys], and rests himself when the day is done: and draw all round the <hi rend="italic">ingle;</hi> and be cozy, and thankful to Heaven that sends us any comfort.&#x2014;&#x2014; I despatched a packet of Books, some eight days ago; by the old address; which I may hope would bring them. They are not much worth; but will serve to shorten a long <hi rend="italic">&#x2019;fore-supper</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The time between the end of work and supper, for rest and recreation.</note> harmlessly enough. I sent your Letter on to Alick, and wrote him another along with it not long since. I have heard nothing direct out of Annandale. The Newspaper with its <hi rend="italic">strokes</hi> comes duly; that is my only token. The Roman Newspaper with <hi rend="italic">three</hi> strokes that Jack spoke of, that was to indicate his arrival in Rome, did come; but I sent it on to Jean,&#x2014;the rather as the last had failed with you, tho&#x2019; there <hi rend="italic">was</hi> a very sufficient Stamp on it, had the people looked well. But indeed it was altogether as good to you shewn at the door and refused, as if <pb id="pg-09-357" n="09:357"/>you had had it to read it, and distil, and boil broth of it;&#x2014;nothing more lay in it to be <hi rend="italic">got</hi> out of it.</p>
<p>And now here is a new Letter from the good Doctor;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1837-11-21">21 Nov.</date></note> and again nothing but good news in it: let us be thankful. He has had some <foreign><hi rend="italic">fash</hi></foreign> [difficulties] with his lodgings, but that is over now. His Lady, by the by, seems to be a very make-<hi rend="italic">myself</hi>-comfortable sort of lady; and would have provoked me several times, where Jack (far more wisely) keeps his temper.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >After John had experienced difficulties in finding lodgings near Lady Clare in Rome, he had offered &#x201C;to live in the house with her.&#x201D; She had taken a night to consider it and then had said it would be impossible &#x201C;without rendering herself uncomfortable.&#x201D; He had found lodgings &#x201C;on a third search.&#x201D;</note> It is right and indispensable. If a person whether lady or gentleman be of disobliging temper, it is really far <hi rend="italic">worst</hi> for that lady&#x2019;s or gentleman&#x2019;s own self; one ought to remember that always. The quality ways in this world will need a &#x201C;radical reform,&#x201D; I think, however; and they are like to get it, one would say! &#x2014;I will write to Jack tomorrow or next day.</p>
<p>Directly after or very soon after my last Letter to you went off, I did begin to <supplied>[write]</supplied> that Article on Walter Scott, which there was talk of then. I felt disgusted with the task, but in some measure bound to do it. Accordingly it <hi rend="italic">is</hi> done, last night, thank Heaven!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle wrote in his <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi>, <date when="1837-12-07">7 Dec.</date>, before he wrote to his mother: &#x201C;It was written with the real <hi rend="italic">wish</hi> to be careless and free, but at least the steam got rather <hi rend="italic">up</hi> nevertheless, and I am in the old sham-happy nervously excited mood,&#x2014;too well known to me! It is a disgusting Article for most part.&#x201D;</note> A long, occasionally rather stupid Article; for which however I shall likely get a matter of &#xa3;50, always useful here. There will I think be some uncertainty about the time of its coming out; perhaps not till <date when="1838-04-00">April</date> next;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >It came out in <date when="1838-01-00">Jan.</date></note> that is no matter. Here the thing lies, fairly sealed up and finished, and will be out of my hands in an hour; you shall see it, as I hope, <hi rend="italic">when</hi> it comes out; I will take care to have it forwarded in some way. I have been obliged to say several rather crabbed things about Sir Walter, and to take down the pegs greatly in respect of the admiration many have of him: but there is nothing malicious or unjust; nay I end, as one should do with all men, in sincere love and pity for him.</p>
<p>Before quitting Literature, I must tell you a still better thing. Fraser the other day sent for me, to propose that he should reprint Teufelsdr&#xF6;ckh and my Review Articles collected into volumes. The wind is changed there, at any rate! The last time he heard of <pb id="pg-09-358" n="09:358"/>Teufelsdr&#xF6;ckh and the proposal to print it, he shrieked at the very notion. Seriously, it is good news this; an infallible sign that the other Book, the F. Revolution, prospers: nay still better, a sign that I shall either now or some time get a little cash by these poor scattered Papers. I have resolved that Fraser, for his old scream&#x2019;s sake, and for my own sake, shall not have the printing of the volumes without<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Without&#x201D; has been inserted by Jane. For Fraser&#x2019;s &#x201C;scream,&#x201D; see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350513-TC-RWE-01">TC to RWE, <date when="1835-05-13">13 May 1835</date></ref>.</note> some very respectable sum of money now:&#x2014;he should have done it formerly, and not screamed!&#x2014; How it may be settled is very uncertain yet; I have not got the negociation started, but will proceed to it now.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi>, <date when="1837-12-07">7 Dec.</date>, says: &#x201C;Changed times! I will not without payment in money. I will go warily and tightly to work with the man.&#x201D; At about this time Carlyle wrote to Jeffrey requesting his permission to reprint his articles from the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review</hi>. Jeffrey replied on <date when="1837-12-12">12 Dec.</date> that Napier, as the current editor, was willing, and on <date when="1837-12-31">31 Dec.</date> enclosing &#x201C;Longman&#x2019;s license to reprint.&#x201D; Saunders and Otley published the first English edition of <hi rend="italic">Sartor Resartus</hi> as a book (the 58 stitched copies of <date when="1834-00-00">1834</date> excepted) in <date when="1838-00-00">1838</date>; Carlyle&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Critical and Miscellaneous Essays</hi>, 4 vols., were first published by James Munroe and Co., (Boston, <date when="1838-00-00">1838</date>), and then by James Fraser (London, <date when="1839-00-00">1839</date>).</note> So much for business.</p>
<p>We got the Scotsbrig barrel, two days after your Letter came. All was right and tight as could be. The butter is very good; the meal is of the best that can be made. The cheese I think must be still lying at Mary&#x2019;s: tell her not to mind, a whit; but cut into it, and consume it. There were some <hi rend="italic">sweeties</hi>, peppermints and a pound of tobacco from Alick&#x2014;poor Alick, the first of his shop-goods; we received them with a most wishful thankfulness, glad and <foreign><hi rend="italic">wae</hi></foreign> [sad].&#x2014; I wrote to warn Jamie and him (it was to him I wrote) that all was right. I hope he will answer me soon; with good accounts&#x2014; The charge of carriage was 11/6; very cheap.</p>
<p>As to health, Jane holds out wonderfully well, without cough at all; better hitherto than for several winters back. She takes great care; never ventures out at all except the day be good. I question whether even in <foreign>reeky</foreign> Manchester you have any idea of some of our days here: the London Fogs! We have had two right ones or three, this year; the last only a few days ago.<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On <date when="1837-12-02">2</date>&#x2013;<date when="1837-12-03">3 Dec.</date></note> It is nothing at Chelsea; yet I had to send for a candle to write with, a little before noon: up in town a man (for example) drove a carriage into a grand corner shop in one of the best streets (St James&#x2019;s Street); and broke two and forty panes of glass, among other things!<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Hastings coach leaving Old White Horse Cellar had smashed into G. Hoby, Boot &#x26; Shoemaker, 48 St. James St.</note>&#x2014; Today, and always since yesternight, <pb id="pg-09-359" n="09:359"/>we have had a kind of faint dirty sleet, which I doubt may be effectual <hi rend="italic">snow</hi> northward with you. Cower close in the warm place, dear Mother! It is winter, and we must be content with bad weather.</p>
<p>My ear is not right yet, tho&#x2019; it is better. The hearing is not greatly dulled, [written between lines, in JWC&#x2019;s hand: &#x201C;indeed so little dulled, that the fai<supplied>[n]</supplied>test &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">squirting</hi>&#x2019; of my pen drives him to despair&#x201D;] but there is a confusing <hi rend="italic">stuffed</hi> sensation in the place; and thin wax runs: I keep cotton in it; and have grown now to heed it little. Indeed during all the <date when="1837-11-00">November</date> month, while writing that thing, I have had a kind of uneasy hardly perceptible cold, which did not grow a right cold, and yet would not let me go: I mean to fling it off now.</p>
<p>But I must go, dear Mother, my time is about run, and the sheet ends here. Thank Jenny, and thank yourself, very specially for the letter; and see to get another up before long. Good be among you; good be with every one of you! Jane joins her loving regards. I am ever and ever,</p>

<salute>My dear Emerson,</salute>
<p>How long it is since you last heard of me I do not very accurately know; but it is too long.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle&#x2019;s last letter to Emerson was dated <date when="1837-06-01">1 June</date>.</note> A very long, ugly, inert and unproductive chapter of my own history seems to have past since then. Whenever I delay writing, be sure matters go not well with me; and do you in that case write to me were it again and over again,&#x2014;unweariable in pity.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A rather gloomy summary; Carlyle was at last beginning to gain recognition.</note></p>
<p>I did go to Scotland, for almost three months; leaving my Wife here with her Mother. The poor Wife had fallen so weak that she gave me real terror in the spring time, and made the Doctor look very grave indeed: she continued too weak for travelling: I was worn out as I had never in my life been. So on the longest day of <date when="1837-06-00">June</date>, I got back to my Mother&#x2019;s cottage; threw myself down, I may say, into what we may call the &#x201C;frightfullest <hi rend="italic">magnetic sleep</hi>,&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hypnotic sleep; cf. &#x201C;Signs of the Times,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XXVII, 60.</note> and lay there <pb id="pg-09-360" n="09:360"/>avoiding the intercourse of men. Most wearisome had their gabble become; almost unearthly. But indeed all was unearthly in that humour. The gushing of my native brooks, the <hi rend="italic">sough</hi> of the old solitary woods, the great roar of old native Solway (billowing fresh out of your Atlantic, drawn by the Moon): all this was a kind of unearthly music to me; I cannot tell you how unearthly.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Just as in the pen portraits Carlyle often senses in human beings a quality and a power that makes them creatures of infinitude, in his descriptions of places, especially of the Solway Firth and surrounding country, he feels perhaps as strongly as Wordsworth himself the mystic affinities between places and man&#x2019;s subconscious life.</note> It did not bring me to rest; yet <hi rend="italic">towards</hi> rest I do think: at all events, the time had come when I behoved to quit again. I have been here since <date when="1837-09-00">September</date>: evidently another little &#x201C;chapter&#x201D; or paragraph, <hi rend="italic">not</hi> altogether inert, is getting forward. But I must not speak of these things. How can I speak of them on a miserable scrap of blue paper?<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not literally but metaphorically &#x201C;blue.&#x201D;</note> Looking into your kind eyes with my eyes, I could speak: not here. Pity me, my friend, my brother; yet hope well of me: if I can (in all senses) rightly <hi rend="italic">hold my peace</hi>, I think much will yet be well with me. <hi rend="small-caps">silence</hi> is the great thing I worship at present; almost the sole tenant of my Pantheon. Let a man know rightly how to hold his peace. I have to repeat to myself, &#x201C;Silence is of Eternity.&#x201D;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. &#x201C;Sir Walter Scott,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XXIX, 27.</note>&#x2014; Ah me, I think how I could rejoice to quit these jawing discords and jargonings of Babel; and go far, far away! I do believe if I had the smallest competence of money to get &#x201C;food and warmth&#x201D; with, I would shake the mud of London from my feet, and go and bury myself in some green place, and never print any syllable more. Perhaps it is better as it is.</p>
<p>But quitting this, we will actually speak (under favour of &#x201C;Silence&#x201D;) one very small thing; a pleasant piece of news. There is a man here called John Sterling (<hi rend="italic">Reverend</hi> John of the Church of England too), whom I love better than anybody I have met with, since a certain sky-messenger alighted to me at Craigenputtoch, and vanished in the Blue again.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For Emerson&#x2019;s visit to Craigenputtoch, see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18330827-TC-JAC-01"><sic>6:425</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1833-08-27">27 Aug. 1833</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340812-TC-RWE-01"><sic>7:262&#x2013;63</sic><corr>TC to RWE, <date when="1834-08-12">12 Aug. 1834</date></corr></ref>.</note>. This Sterling has written; but what is far better he has lived, he is alive. Across several unsuitable wrappages, of Church-of-Englandism and others, my heart loves the man. He is one, and the best of a small class extant here, who nigh drowning in a black wreck of Infidelity (lighted up by some glare of Radicalism only, now growing <hi rend="italic">dim</hi> too) and about to perish, saved themselves into a Coleridgian Shovel hattedness,&#x2014;or determination to <hi rend="italic">preach</hi>, to preach <pb id="pg-09-361" n="09:361"/>peace; were it only the spent <hi rend="italic">echo</hi> of a peace once preached. He is still only about thirty; young; and I think will shed the shovel-hat yet perhaps. Do you ever read <hi rend="italic">Blackwood?</hi> This John Sterling is the &#x201C;New Contributor&#x201D; whom Wilson makes such a rout about, in the <date when="1837-11-00">November</date> and prior month: &#x201C;Crystals from a Cavern&#x201D; &#x26;c,&#x2014;which it is well worth your while to see.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370608-TC-JOST-01">TC to <sic>JS</sic><corr>JOST</corr>, <date when="1837-06-08">9 [8] June</date></ref>.</note> Well, and what then, cry you?&#x2014; Why then, this John Sterling has fallen overhead in love with a certain Waldo Emerson; that is all. He saw the little book <hi rend="italic">Nature</hi><note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >(Boston, <date when="1836-09-00">Sept. 1836</date>).</note> lying here; and, across a whole <foreign><hi rend="italic">silva silvarum</hi></foreign> [dense forest] of prejudices, discerned what was in it; took it to his heart,&#x2014;and indeed into his pocket, and has carried it off to Madeira with him; whither unhappily (tho&#x2019; now with good hope and expectation) the Doctors have ordered him. This is the small piece of pleasant news, that two sky-messengers (such they were both of them to me) have met and recognised each other; and by God&#x2019;s blessing there shall one day be a trio of us: call you that nothing?</p>
<p>And so now by a direct transition I am got to the &#x201C;Oration.&#x201D;<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Oration, Delivered before the Phi Beta Kappa Society, at Cambridge, <date when="1837-08-31">August 31, 1837</date></hi> (Boston, <date when="1837-00-00">1837</date>); from <date when="1849-00-00">1849</date> it was known as <hi rend="italic">The American Scholar;</hi> see <hi rend="italic">Collected Works of Ralph Waldo Emerson</hi> (Cambridge, Mass., <date when="1971-00-00">1971</date>), I, 49&#x2013;70. Emerson had sent Carlyle one of the first edition of 500 which Carlyle received in <date when="1838-01-00">Jan. 1838</date>. In his <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi>, <date when="1837-12-07">7 Dec.</date>, he wrote: &#x201C;Beautiful &#x2018;Oration&#x2019; from Emerson in New England; really glorious; and right cheering to me.&#x201D;</note> My friend! you know not what you have done for me there. It was long decades of years that I had heard nothing but the infinite jangling and jabbering and inarticulate twittering and screeching, and my soul had sunk down sorrowful, and said there is no articulate speaking then any more, and those art solitary among stranger-creatures! and lo, out of the West, comes a clear utterance, clearly recognisable as a <hi rend="italic">m</hi><supplied>[<hi rend="italic">an&#x2019;s</hi>]</supplied> voice, and I <hi rend="italic">have</hi> a kinsman and brother: God be thanked for it! I could <supplied>[have]</supplied> <hi rend="italic">wept</hi> to read that speech; the clear high melody of it went tingling thro&#x2019; my heart; I said to my wife &#x201C;There, woman!&#x201D; She read; and returned, and charges me to return for answer, &#x201C;that there had been nothing met with like it since Schiller went silent.&#x201D; My brave Emerson! And all this has been lying silent, quite tranquil in him, these seven years, and the &#x201C;vociferous platitude&#x201D;<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See also <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370608-TC-JOST-01">TC to <sic>JS</sic><corr>JOST</corr>, <date when="1837-06-08">9 [8] June</date></ref>, and <ref target="volume-09/lt-18371030-TC-JSM-01">TC to JSM, <date when="1837-10-30">30 Oct.</date></ref></note> dinning his ears on all sides, and he quietly answering no word; and a whole world of Thought has silently built itself in these calm depths, and the day being come, says quite softly, as if it were a common thing, &#x201C;Yes, I <hi rend="italic">am</hi> <pb id="pg-09-362" n="09:362"/>here too.&#x201D;<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >From <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister;</hi> cf.

But for you, my dear friend, I say and pray heartily: May God grant you strength, for you have a <hi rend="italic">fearful</hi> work to do! Fearful I call it; and yet it is great, and the greatest. O for God&#x2019;s sake <hi rend="italic">keep yourself still quiet</hi>. Do not hasten to write; you cannot be too slow about it. Give no ear to any man&#x2019;s praise or censure; know that that is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> it: on the one side is as Heaven if you have strength to keep silent, and climb unseen; yet on the other side, yawning always at one&#x2019;s right-hand and one&#x2019;s left, is the frightfullest Abyss and Pandimonium! See Fenimore Cooper,&#x2014;poor Cooper, he is <hi rend="italic">down in it;</hi> and had a climbing faculty too.<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle presumably refers to Cooper&#x2019;s prolific output, its contentious nature, after his return to the States in <date when="1833-00-00">1833</date>, his quarrel with his fellow townspeople of Cooperstown, and his litigations with New York newspapers. His <hi rend="italic">England with Sketches of Society in the Metropolis</hi> (London, <date when="1837-00-00">1837</date>) had been severely noticed in the journals: <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s</hi>, XVI (<date when="1837-08-00">Aug. 1837</date>), 233&#x2013;41, and <hi rend="italic">Quarterly Review</hi>, LIX (<date when="1837-10-00">Oct. 1837</date>), 327&#x2013;61. Cf. also the first sentence of &#x201C;Sir Walter Scott.&#x201D;</note> Be steady, be quiet, be in <hi rend="italic">no</hi> haste; and God speed you well! My space is done.</p>
<p>And so <foreign>adieu</foreign>, for this time. You must write soon again. My copy of the <hi rend="italic">Oration</hi> has never come: how is this?<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle had read Harriet Martineau&#x2019;s copy (see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18371225-TC-JOST-01">TC to <sic>JS</sic><corr>JOST</corr>, <date when="1837-12-25">25 Dec.</date></ref>).</note> I could dispose of a dozen well.&#x2014;&#x2014; They say I am to lecture again in Spring, <foreign><hi rend="italic">Ay de mi!</hi></foreign> The &#x201C;Book&#x201D; is babbled about sufficiently in several dialects. Fraser wants to print my scattered Reviews and Articles; a pregnant sign. Teufelsdr&#xF6;ckh to precede. The man &#x201C;screamed&#x201D; once at the name of it in a very musical manner. He shall not print a line, unless he give me <hi rend="italic">money</hi> for it more or less. I have had enough of printing for one while,&#x2014;thrown into &#x201C;magnetic sleep&#x201D; by it!<closer><salute>Farewell my brother.&#x2014;</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle.</name></p>
<ps><p>O. Rich,<note n="15" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson had asked Carlyle to remind Rich, the Bookseller, of an overdue account. &#x201C;If he persist in his self-denying contumacy, I think you may immortalise him as a bookseller of the Gods&#x201D; (Slater, <hi rend="italic">CEC</hi>, p. 169).</note> it seems, is in Spain. His representative assured me, some weeks since, that the Account was now sent.&#x2014; There is an Article on Sir W. Scott: shocking; <foreign>invitissim&#xe2; Minerv&#xe2;</foreign> [without inspiration]!</p>
<p>Miss Martineau charges me to send kind remembrances to you and your lady: her words were kinder than I have room for here.&#x2014; Can you not, in defect or delay of Letter, send me a Massachusetts Newspaper? I think it costs little or almost nothing now; and I shall know your hand.</p></ps>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>It is exactly eight days since your Letter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1837-11-21">21 Nov.</date></note> reached us; right welcome as all your Letters are. I sent it off to Manchester and our Mother, where I suppose it has been since yesterday. The <hi rend="italic">Diario</hi> with three strokes had arrived duly: that I sent forward to Dumfries for a sign of you. By the last Courier you would see that I had got your new address. Were I to wait a few days longer, this Letter might bring you more conclusive news about some things; but there is no propriety in waiting, at such a distance as we now correspond; besides conclusion of one thing is but beginning of another: <foreign><hi rend="italic">rusticus expectat: civicus</hi></foreign> [the rustic waits: the city dweller] ought to do other.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-02/lt-18221118-TC-JBW-01"><sic>2:208</sic><corr>TC to JBW, <date when="1822-11-18">18 Nov. 1822</date></corr></ref>.</note></p>
<p><pb id="pg-09-364" n="09:364"/>There has no opportunity turned up of forwarding the French Revolution; the more vexatious this as Rennie<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Rennie (see <ref target="volume-02/lt-18220100-JBW-EA-01"><sic>2:17</sic><corr>JBW to EA, <date when="1822-01-15">15 Jan. 1822</date></corr></ref>).</note> got word of a Painter who had just <hi rend="italic">gone</hi> off for Rome two days before! Rennie is still on the outlook, but with lessening hope. Nay he thinks, at bottom, no traveller would be very prudent in taking charge of a Book with such a title: the Austrian toll-men might boggle at it, and so forth. Let me hope the sheet-copy from Paris may have arrived. Fraser to whom I also spoke recommended that the Volumes should simply be wrapt up as a Parcel; addressed; and sent off from the Spread Eagle in Regent Circus: they did that the other day, he said, with certain Books for a Lord Somebody at Milan. Shall I? I will if you bid me. It is but the loss of a Copy of the Book. But perhaps the <hi rend="italic">three strokes</hi> may still come; that will be best of all.</p>
<p>At the time I wrote last, there was a question about Mill and Articles: M. called almost the next day, and at great length unfolded his pecuniary position with regard to that Review; which Molesworth, after spending some thousands on it, quits altogether in <date when="1838-04-00">April</date> next, leaving it in Mill&#x2019;s keeping; not in a very solvent state. Many of the Articles <hi rend="italic">must</hi> be <foreign>gratis</foreign>: from me an Article <hi rend="italic">every other N</hi>o. would be most acceptable, &#x26;c &#x26;c: in short, it was quite clear that here lay no bread for me; hardly salt to my bread. Meanwhile poor Mill looked dolefully anxious that I should not desert him. In brief, I answered next day that I <hi rend="italic">would</hi> do that <hi rend="italic">Scott</hi>, and leave the rest hanging. To work therefore: and so <hi rend="italic">Scott</hi> is done (on Wednesday night last); and they profess great satisfaction with it; and&#x2014;it will bring me in somewhat like &#xa3;50; that is the only use of it.

I wrote in great chagrin and plague; my deaf ear made as if the half of my head had been wooden; catarrhs, November fogs like Erebus:&#x2014;but in short, it is <hi rend="italic">done</hi>; and my nerves are coming back to their old tone again. Whether anything and what thing more I shall do for them is uncertain, is indifferent to me. They have got a new Editor, one Robertson an Aberdeen man; a &#x201C;religious radical,&#x201D; and great admirer of mine: but the whole business is still an extremely despicable one; radicalism must shake off these people, if it be not itself shaken off by all good men.

Not so long ago, all this was far as the North Pole from James&#x2019;s ideas. He shrieked literally at the very hint of it. And now he is willing, nay eager; there even seemed to lie <hi rend="italic">money</hi> in him, if I could bring it out. No Review-puff whatsoever can come up to this. Well, I said I would consider it; and so, having considered it, and taken counsel about it with my Goody, with Miss Martineau (a very shrewd creature)<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See also Harriet Martineau, <hi rend="italic">Autobiography</hi> (London, <date when="1877-00-00">1877</date>), I, 384&#x2013;85.</note> and made up my mind, I yesterday wrote Fraser<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >This letter has not been found.</note> that there were, including <hi rend="italic">Teufel</hi>k, some Five sufficient Volumes of those things; that he should have a 750 Edition of them on paying me down &#xa3;50 per volume <hi rend="italic">baar;</hi><note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unclear but possibly mimicking Fraser&#x2019;s pronunciation of &#x201C;bare&#x201D; as in &#x201C;bare minimum.&#x201D;</note> on not paying it, not. This is the thing I alluded to as likely to settle itself if I waited a day or two. My notion of the probabilities is that Fraser will boggle, will refuse; and that therefore the thing will drop for the present: yet one cannot say. At all events, I feel decidedly as if there were no good for me in printing any more without money; being a thoroughly wearied, a half-killed man (as Mrs Jeffrey would say) &#x201C;I have no <hi rend="italic">wish</hi> to print.&#x201D; Under fifty pounds a volume, I simply will not plague myself with it at present. Miss Martineau is <hi rend="italic">importing</hi> Teuf<hi rend="italic">k</hi> from America by the fifty, by the five-and-twenty:<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Harriet Martineau, <hi rend="italic">Autobiography</hi>, I, 383&#x2013;84.</note> if my repute will not spread to such extent that I can get a little victual while correcting the press, why then in Heaven&#x2019;s name it may take its own way,&#x2014;and I also will take mine.
There is nothing I am thankfuller for than to feel myself pretty well assured that neither the staying out of &#x201C;fame,&#x201D; nor still more the coming of it, in any quantity, can at this time <supplied>[of]</supplied> day do me much mischief. The liveliest image of Hell-on-Earth that I can form to myself is that of a poor bladder of a creature blown up by popular-wind; and bound to keep himself blown, under pain of torment very severe, and <hi rend="italic">with</hi> torment all the while and the cracking to pieces of all good that was in him! I have looked on this close at hand; and do shudder at it as <hi rend="italic">the sternest</hi> doom that can befal a Son of Adam. Let me break stones on the highway rather, and be in my own heart <hi rend="italic">at peace!</hi> It is this that I <pb id="pg-09-366" n="09:366"/>reckon to be the great reward of my fierce fight of these latter years; I do feel peaceabler, and with a peace not dependent on other men or outward things but on myself: God be thanked for it, and make it grow!&#x2014; There is still talk about Lecturing; which probably I <hi rend="italic">shall</hi> have to try again. Some (Henry Taylor for one) will have it to be on the French Revolution: a very ticklish subject! Others vote for German again. I myself sometimes dream of a Series of Literary characters, Homer, Virgil, Dante, Shakspeare Cervantes, Voltaire &#x26;c.<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle did lecture on the latter, calling the series &#x201C;On the History of Literature.&#x201D;</note> Ah me, I have no wish but to be silent;&#x2014;not to have my nerves &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">dadded a&#x2019; abried</hi></foreign> [shaken to pieces]&#x201D; again! We shall see. I have never yet, in truth, got it steadily looked at.&#x2014; But see how the sheet goes! I must escape from myself and this class of topics. Our health is no worse than it was; mine fully better, the catarrhal deafness almost gone. Jane wearies considerably of the foggy confinement, ten days together sometimes, and gets headachy towards the end of it; but she has never yet had a<supplied>[ny]</supplied> more cough, she continues to do well, and take care. At present she is out, in a sunny <supplied>[day]</supplied> of cold weather, to see Mrs John Sterling. I was to send her love, if she did not get in again before my conclusion. The Sterlings and all the rest (Maurice very fidgety and wiredrawn) go on as usual. No news from John Sterling yet: great praise of him in <date when="1837-11-00">November</date> Blackwood as our &#x201C;new Contributor.&#x201D; <foreign><hi rend="italic">Satis jam</hi></foreign> [Enough of this].</p>
<p>A Letter from our Mother and Jenny since I wrote. She sends good reports of herself, many blessings to you (it was written on receipt of your Letter last but one), great thankfulness that you are out of the perils of cholera, and in a state of composure again. She calculates on staying in Manchester till Spring come; not a bad plan; for they seem to be very warm and snug, and to do wonderfully well together. I send always a Newspaper on Monday; and bundles of Books from time to time. Jenny is to go with her into Scotland on the return. They spoke of Rob having been over to assist at opening Alick&#x2019;s shop. Alick seemed one of the briskest little shopkeepers. I have written to him (on occasion of Scotsbrig oatmeal having come), I communicated to him your precept about penmanship with approval, spake what cheer I could: there is yet no reply, no tidings what the aspect of the matter is. I rather augur well.&#x2014; Did you see poor James Johnston&#x2019;s death in the Paper? I had never heard of it, and have not yet heard much more; he had been ill for a while; he <pb id="pg-09-367" n="09:367"/>has left one child. Poor James! No innocenter man lived in the world. John Minto is dead, Mother tells me; his wife Kate was lying dead when I left that country; it was a tragical house with poverty and sorrow: how could one <hi rend="italic">live</hi> if it were not for Death? <foreign><hi rend="italic">Der ernste Freund</hi></foreign> [The stern companion]!&#x2014; I am to write to Jean tomorrow; I have long owed them a Letter: Jean is my best correspondent in that quarter. We heard from Mrs Welsh lately; all tolerably right; lonely, no doubt, after Mrs Crichton&#x2019;s death. Elizabeth Fergus of Kirkcaldy is sending us a Scotch servant-<foreign>lass</foreign> one of these days: our present fat damsel does not please herself here, and goes off on Sunday. G.<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Graham.</note> of Burnswark wrote to me: our half-brother John had got safe to New York, and gone into the interior; no great fear of him.</p>
<p>Dear Jack, it is a shining bright hour (the first this week), 2 o&#x2019;clock, and I must out, with margins or with none. The essential is told. Rejoice that you are got into a tolerable kind of lodging, <hi rend="italic">anchored</hi> there at any rate. If practice come, well; if not, also well; never fret your heart. Come home, and let us meet again in <date when="1838-05-00">May</date>! Home, sweet home; and leave all manner of <hi rend="italic">Gig</hi>ships, male and female, to roll as they list. Courage my brave Jack; thou art right patient really; quiet and diligent, as it beseems. Better days are perhaps beginning for us all. A great comfort I have had in thee, for one: otherwise, many a time, the Earth had <hi rend="italic">seemed</hi> as good as vacant, not one mortal creature in it that could give me any help. One should be thankful to Heaven for such a Brother&#x2014;People all ask for you, in fit time; I have no room to specify them. Jane still is not here. Write without delay that you can help. Take my love and brotherly blessing. <closer><salute>Ever your affectionate</salute></closer></p>

I was very kind to him, but could not ask him to come and see me, in the usual mood I am in. He would drive me by and by near killing him.

He said, however, some striking things &#x2026; as that <supplied>[no]</supplied> man ever did any great good to society under the influence of benevolent motives. &#x2026; He was &#x2026; personally civil to me, and though I shunned particular conversation with him I said nothing discourteously that I am aware of.&#x201D; Possibly slavery was discussed because of an antislavery meeting at Exeter Hall on <date when="1837-11-23">23 Nov.</date> for the complete abolition of slavery throughout the British dominions which 1,200 to 1,300, including Charles Buller, attended.</note></p>
<p>Tom Holcroft has taken to sending me French Newspapers from Paris. Very curious in Tom. I send them forward into the interior of Scotland for most part.

<salute>My dear Sister,</salute>
<p>Your welcome Letter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> has been too long unanswered; but I hope you have been living in the constant faith that it <hi rend="italic">would</hi> be answered when the time came: I myself have calculated on doing it so soon as a certain A<hi rend="italic">r</hi>ticle was off my hands; which is now fairly gone (with a blessing to it!) about a week ago. The plan of sending Jack&#x2019;s Letter to my Mother &#x201C;at Dumfries&#x201D; did not seem quite safe; the frank would have been too <hi rend="italic">dear</hi> had it gone back to Manchester, and then found itself no frank! I made <hi rend="italic">them</hi>, that is my Mother and Jenny, promise to write to you without loitering. Mrs Welsh likewise was charged to let you know that all was well at Rome and here. So I hope, one way or other you did not altogether want for tidings. Probably Alick may have shewn you our Mother&#x2019;s Letter to me here, before now; it is the first and only one I have had from her; a Newspaper last week indicates however that they are well, and that certain books I had sent them have arrived safe. You got the Roman Newspaper, and understood it? It was to indicate that Jack had now shifted his quarters to Rome (out of Albano, some 15 miles off), and that all was quiet and right about him. Since that, eight days ago, I have had a Letter from him; which I sent off to our Mother. He writes with deliberation, in a quiet mood of mind; how he has had to seek new lodgings, his lady wishing him to be nearer her; how he expects no great practice this winter, but still hopes to make it pay, &#x26;c. &#x201C;N<hi rend="italic">o</hi> 189. Corso, Rome,&#x201D; that is his address, if James or you should ever gird yourselves up to writing a Letter to him, full of Scotch news: he would be right glad to see it. He seems well in health, but not very happy: indeed it is wonderful he can be so little unhappy, dangling idle at the skirts of idle people in that manner,&#x2014;&#x201C;tied to it,&#x201D; as poor Waffler Geordie<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Farries, the Ecclefechan to Edinburgh carrier.</note> said, by the necessity of earning money! He expects to be home in <date when="1838-05-00">May</date>; that is the best news. And now for a little of London.</p>
<p>We keep up a tolerable style of health here both of us; tolerable considering the season. You have small idea what a business foggy Winter sometimes is in London. Every day, these several weeks, is the direct contradiction of its neighbour: thou art black frost, therefore I will be dank mist; sleet thou, sunshine I, &#x26;c &#x26;c. We have had <hi rend="italic">a Fog</hi> <pb id="pg-09-370" n="09:370"/>or two; coaches driving thro&#x2019; shop-windows;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-09/lt-18371207-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1837-12-07">7 Dec.</date></ref></note> blackness of darkness: a smoke-air, like a condensation of the element of darkness, &#x201C;such that you might lift it with shovels.&#x201D; In spite of all this, Jane keeps reasonably well hitherto: no cough; only headaches getting a little too frequent. She abstains altogether from going out at night, and except in dry noon-times from going out even by day. This confinement, when it lasts ten days, breeds headaches: but one must struggle on; hoping that there is a gentler, at all events a steadier kind of weather coming. As for me, I have had paltry sneaking colds all over me, have been <hi rend="italic">deaf</hi> in the left ear, and so forth; but that is mostly gone now; and while it continued I still kept working, and growling a little. The deafness in particular was extremely disagreeable; as if that side of my head had been all suddenly cased in wood, or indeed half changed into wood! I was scribbling all the while, in that state of half-stupefaction.</p>
<p>The thing I have been working in was an Article on Sir Walter Scott; Lockhart his <supplied>[son-]</supplied>in-law is publishing a very long Life of him, and many people talking about it. The Article is done; to come out in the London Review<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">London and Westminster Review</hi>, XXVIII (<date when="1838-01-00">Jan. 1838</date>), 293&#x2013;345. Carlyle reviewed vols. I&#x2013;VI, the seventh not being finished until <date when="1838-00-00">1838</date>. Jeffrey, who knew of Carlyle&#x2019;s disappointment when he was unable to meet Scott and deliver Goethe&#x2019;s medal in person in <date when="1828-00-00">1828</date> (<ref target="volume-04/lt-18280413-TC-SWS-01"><sic>4:352&#x2013;55</sic><corr>TC to SWS, <date when="1828-04-13">13 April 1828</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-04/lt-18280523-TC-SWS-01"><sic>375</sic><corr>TC to SWS, <date when="1828-05-23">23 May 1828</date></corr></ref>) but who did not know that Carlyle had reviewed Lockhart&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Scott</hi>, wrote to Carlyle on <date when="1837-12-31">31 Dec.</date>: &#x201C;Do you read Sir Walter Scotts life?&#x2014;. &#x2026; I think the Diary, which is the best of it, will interest you&#x2014;and give you a juster and a kinder impression of that extraordinary man than you used to have&#x2014;&#x201D;</note> in some two months: I will send it to James, as soon as there is opportunity. But he need not be in haste; there is nothing in it of any moment. Its worth is that it will bring &#xa3;50 or so, and keep &#x201C;mall in shaft&#x201D; [things going] a while longer here: there is little other worth in it. I wrote it with stupefaction, disgust and indignation;&#x2014;tho&#x2019; after all, it is well enough too, and the paymaster people are satisfied with it, which is sufficient. But I have no wish to write anything more at all at present, but to lie dormant and silent; which indeed I hope to get to do for a while by and by. O the unspeakable wearing-out, the sickliness, dispiritment and dull misery of a poor scribbler heartily <hi rend="italic">tired!</hi> You know not what it is; may you never know anything tenth part as ugly. The people keep talking here about another course of lectures: alas, I suppose, there will be no remedy: but it lies at a safe distance yet, and I as seldom as possible think of it.</p>
<p>James gratified me by his hold he had taken of the bloody jaw of<pb id="pg-09-371" n="09:371"/>
Robespierre.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, IV, 284.</note> That thing<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">The French Revolution</hi>. Frances Allen wrote to Fanny Wedgwood on <date when="1837-12-05">5 Dec.</date>: &#x201C;I have at length got my copy from another bookseller, and am in the midst of the 1<hi rend="italic">st</hi> Vol. I like it very much&#x2014;it lays hold of ones attention. &#x2026; I am rather amused by the style also, not at all angry with it.&#x201D; She also commented: &#x201C;You have established a very nice society about you of the Scotts, Carlyles, and M<hi rend="italic">r</hi>. Dunn. If M<hi rend="italic">r</hi>. C. pretends to be Teufelsdroech he is an imposter&#x201D; (MS: Wedgwood Papers, University of Keele).</note> goes on still, very much as one would wish it to do here. Nay the best of all testimonies about it came the other day: in a proposal from Bookseller Fraser to <hi rend="italic">reprint</hi> Teufelsdr&#xF6;ckh and the Review and Magazine Papers, in Volumes! It is a change of tune on the part of Fraser. I have answered him that I would print nothing more for any mortal without sight of <hi rend="italic">ready money;</hi> that he must give me &#xa3;50 a volume (there are 5 volumes), otherwise he could not strike at all. No answer to <hi rend="italic">this</hi> as yet. The probable answer I think will be refusal, and a dropping of the speculation for the present. But it <hi rend="italic">will</hi> come to that some day, as I calculate; at all events we will let it lie, and see whether it will not; in the mean while if one has no money, one has at least no toil: puddling in the middle of printers and trash, without a coin to show for it, has ceased to be of any use to me now: Heaven be thanked for that.&#x2014; And so, as I meant to say, you and James will work your passage thro&#x2019; that <hi rend="italic">Revolution</hi> in the winter nights, and I hope get your share of good from it; to me it has done great good. It was like making a <hi rend="italic">clean breast:</hi> &#x201C;Gentlemen, <hi rend="italic">that</hi> is what I had to say, be so kind as treat it exactly according to your own sweet will; and we will see what comes of it. To me has come at least the most sincere desire of holding my peace for a while!&#x201D;</p>
<p>Of our London people here I say nothing. They have all got back to their smoking Babylon again; are giving dinner-parties, evening-parties, and <foreign>jannering</foreign> [chattering] and jargoning in the old way. To me they are extremely kind; yet I avoid their gatherings as much as I can with good grace. Clever men may live here; but very few peaceable well-conditioned men in those circles of life. Rejoice, my dear Jean, with your industrious goodman, that you are out of all that. Happy is the man healthfully busy; not whirling, in that way, like sand in the wind! It is deplorable to think of&#x2014;therefore I do not think of it. Be busy ye, and consider your lot <hi rend="italic">enviable</hi>, tho&#x2019; in it too are cares sorrows and ever-returning labour: it is the universal lot of man, not to be complained of, that.

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Your courteous Gift,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Literary Leaves</hi> (Edinburgh and Calcutta, <date when="1836-00-00">1836</date>). He had also sent a copy to Lockhart about <date when="1837-10-00">Oct.</date>&#x2013;<date when="1837-11-00">Nov.</date></note> with the Letter<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found; two letters from Richardson to Carlyle, <date when="1838-07-07">7 July 1838</date> and <date when="1843-06-24">24 June 1843</date>, are in the NLS. The first of these, dated at Calcutta, is in reply to this letter, the only letter from Carlyle to Richardson that has been found. Richardson thanks Carlyle for his generous encouragement and praises his essays on Scott, Burns, and Croker&#x2019;s edition of Boswell&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Johnson</hi>. Referring to his students he adds: &#x201C;These native boys possess a singular delicacy and acuteness of mind and read with wonderful elegance and propriety. &#x2026; I have introduced some of your own criticisms to them&#x2014;with your name and character as a writer they have been long familiar&#x2014;and they saw at once what a mass of <hi rend="italic">thought</hi> you have compressed into them, though they were startled by the novelty of the style. &#x2026; Mr Macaulay, when he examined them expressed great surprise and pleasure at their attainments.&#x201D; Richardson also writes: &#x201C;The political horizon is blackening around us. We are threatened by the Burmese, the Nepaulese, the Persians and the Russians. &#x2026; Perhaps I shall now have to throw aside the pen and take up the sword.&#x201D;</note> accompanying it, reached me only about a week ago, tho&#x2019; dated <date when="1837-06-20">20<hi rend="italic">th</hi> June</date>, almost at the opposite point of the year<supplied>[.]</supplied> Whether there has been undue delay or not is unknown to me; but at any rate on my side there ought to be no delay.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-09-373" n="09:373"/>I have read your volume&#x2014;what little of it was known to me before, and the much that was not known&#x2014;I can say, with true pleasure. It is written, as few volumes in these days are, with fidelity, with successful care, with insight and conviction as to matter, with clearness and graceful precision as to manner: in a word, it is the impress of a mind stored with elegant accomplishments, gifted with an eye to see, and a heart to understand;&#x2014;a welcome, altogether recommendable Book. More than once I have said to myself and others, How many parlour firesides are there this winter in England, at which this Volume, could one give credible announcement of its quality, would be right pleasant company! There are very many, <hi rend="italic">could</hi> one give the announcement! But no such announcement <hi rend="italic">can</hi> be given; therefore the parlour firesides must even put up with&#x2014;&#x2014;, or what other stuff Chance shoves in their way, and read, tho&#x2019; with malediction all the time. It is a great pity; but no man can help it. We are now arrived seemingly pretty near the point when all criticism and proclamation in matters literary has degenerated into an insane jargon, incredible, unintelligible, inarticulate as the cawing of choughs and rooks;&#x2014;and many things, in that as in other provinces, are in a state of painful and rapid transition. A good Book has no way of recommending itself except slowly, and as it were accidentally from hand to hand. The man that wrote it must abide his time. He needs, as indeed all men do, the <hi rend="italic">faith</hi> that this world is built not on falsehood and jargon, but on truth and reason; that no good thing done by any creature of God was, is, or ever can be <hi rend="italic">lost</hi>, but will verily do the service appointed for it; and be found among the general Sum-total and All of Things after long times, nay after all Time, and thro&#x2019; Eternity itself. Let him &#x201C;cast his bread upon the waters,&#x201D; therefore, cheerful of heart; &#x201C;he will find it after many days.&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Eccles. 11:1.</note>&#x2014;I know not why I write all this to you, it comes very spontaneously from me. Let it be your satisfaction, the highest a man can have in this world, that the talent intrusted to you did not lie useless, but was turned to account and proved itself to be a talent; and the &#x201C;publishing world&#x201D; can receive it altogether according to their own pleasure, raise it high on the housetops, or trample it low into the street-kennels; that is not the question at all; the <hi rend="italic">thing</hi> remains precisely what it was after never such raising and never such depressing and trampling; there is no change whatever in <hi rend="italic">it</hi>. I bid you go on and prosper.</p>
<p>One thing grieves me: the tone of sadness, I might say of settled <pb id="pg-09-374" n="09:374"/>melancholy, that runs thro&#x2019; all your utterances of yourself. It is not right, it is wrong; and yet how shall I reprove you? If you knew me, you would triumphantly <supplied>[see]</supplied> for any spiritual endowment bestowed on a man, that it is accompanied, or one might say <hi rend="italic">preceded</hi> as the first origin of it, always by a delicacy of organisation which in a world like ours is sure to have itself manifoldly afflicted, tormented, darkened down into sorrow and disease.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Shepherd omits this sentence.</note> You feel yourself an exile in the East; but in the West too it is exile. I know not where under the sun it is not exile. Here in the Fog-Babylon, amid mud and smoke, in the infinite din of &#x201C;vociferous platitude,&#x201D; and quack outbellowing quack, with Truth and Pity on all hands ground under the wheels,&#x2014;can one call it a home, or a world? It is a waste chaos, where we have to swim painfully for our life. The utmost a man can do is to swim there like a man, and hold his peace. For this seems to me a great truth, in any exile or chaos whatsoever, that sorrow was <hi rend="italic">not</hi> given us for sorrow&#x2019;s sake, but always and infallibly as a lesson to us from which we are to learn somewhat; and which, the somewhat once <hi rend="italic">learned</hi>, ceases to be sorrow. I do believe this, and study in general to &#x201C;consume my own smoke&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi>, p. 148.</note>&#x2014;not indeed without very ugly out-puffs at times! Allan Cunningham is the test; he tells me that always as one grows older, one grows happier: a thing also which I really can believe.</p>
<p>But as for you, my dear Sir, you have other work to do in the East than grieve. Are there not beautiful things there, glorious things; wanting only an eye to note them, a hand to record them? If I had the command over you, I would say, Read <hi rend="italic">Paul et Virginie</hi> then, read the <hi rend="italic">Chaumi&#xE8;re Indienne</hi>;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Both by Bernardin de St. Pierre; Carlyle perhaps sees them as suitably uplifting tales set abroad; <hi rend="italic">Paul et Virginie</hi> (Paris, <date when="1788-00-00">1788</date>) is somewhat inappropriate with its tale of tragic love in the Mauritius; <hi rend="italic">La Chaumi&#xE8;re Indienne</hi> (Paris, <date when="1791-00-00">1791</date>) is perhaps more apt; in it a learned traveller finds truth and wisdom in the cottage of an Indian pariah. John had translated <hi rend="italic">Paul et Virginie</hi> (see <ref target="volume-02/lt-18230509-TC-JAC-01"><sic>2:348</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1823-05-09">9 May 1823</date></corr></ref>).</note> gird yourself together for a right effort, and go and do likewise or better! I mean what I say. The East has its own phases; there are things there which the West yet knows not of; and one Heaven covers both.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle&#x2019;s interest in India was intensified by his links with friends such as Kitty Kirkpatrick (see <ref target="volume-03/lt-18241004-TC-JCE-01"><sic>3:166</sic><corr>TC to JCE, <date when="1824-10-04">4 Oct. 1824</date></corr></ref>), who was half Indian, Charles Buller Sr. and Edward Strachey Sr. (see <ref target="volume-02/lt-18220112-TC-JCE-01"><sic>2:4&#x2013;5</sic><corr>TC to JCE, <date when="1822-01-12">12 Jan. 1822</date></corr></ref>), both retired Anglo-Indian judges, Mill and Grant who worked at India House, and Thackeray, soon to be a friend, who had spent his early childhood there.</note> He that has an eye let him look! I hope you forgive me this style I have got into. It seems to me on reading your Book as if we had been long acquainted in some measure; as if one <pb id="pg-09-375" n="09:375"/>might speak to you right from the heart. I hope we shall meet some day or other. <closer><salute>I send you my constant respect and good wishes; and am and remain,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Before the Parliamenters go all out of town with their franks, I will write a hasty line to satisfy myself and you about the last Letter that went. It fell just about the time of your flitting; and, I think, must have been in Manchester before your Letter to me left you.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found. The Hannings had moved back to Manchester and a new job for Robert.</note> Robert, it seems, had made arrangements about such Post-matters; but there would be some delay. Since that, indeed, I have had a Newspaper from him with <hi rend="italic">three</hi> strokes, from which I infer that all is probably right. However, I will make assurance doubly sure.</p>
<p>Understand then that a Letter did go off towards you just about the flitting time; that it contained a Letter from the Doctor, who had got fairly settled in Rome; that it reported all well of him and of us. There was nothing more of importance in the Frank; so that even if it should be lost (which I judge highly unlikely), you need not give yourselves any uneasiness about it, but let it go. And so enough about <hi rend="italic">it:</hi> I shall suppose that you have got it, all right.</p>
<p>Since then there has nothing of great importance fallen out, and nothing at all that was wrong. Jane still continues tolerably well; taking great care of herself. I too am well, better than I was; the deafness has entirely left my ear; a considerable relief to me, for it was very confusing and annoying. My Article on <hi rend="italic">Walter Scott</hi>, which will be printed before long, gives much satisfaction to the Editors, and they are very desirous and urgent that I should do them some more forthwith: but my appetite in that direction is not great at present; I rather think I shall look mainly in the <hi rend="italic">lecturing</hi> side of things for some time. Fraser the Bookseller, I said in last Letter, wanted to collect my scattered pieces and print them: well, I wrote to him that there were five <pb id="pg-09-376" n="09:376"/>volumes, and that he should have them for &#xa3;50 apiece; that is, one small edition of them for that; the entire copyright I would not sell him at any price. Poor Fraser was thrown into a terrible strait; &#x201C;could not give&#x201D; so much; I could not take a fraction less; and so I said &#x201C;Well, Sir, good b&#x2019;ye, then,&#x201D; and he answered almost at the greeting, &#x201C;Good b&#x2019;ye&#x201D;; and there the matter rests at present. My persuasion is that &#xa3;50 a volume will one day be got for those things, if not today then tomorrow; and it may easily be at a day when I want it more than at present. So we will just leave it standing where it is (please the pigs),<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A favorite expression of Carlyle&#x2019;s, probably his own coinage (cf. <ref target="volume-06/lt-18321016-TC-JSM-01"><sic>6:240</sic><corr>TC to JSM, <date when="1832-10-16">16 Oct. 1832</date></corr></ref>).</note> and not strike in it at all <hi rend="italic">till</hi> somebody offer these terms, however far off that may be,&#x2014;these terms, or something like these. I have no wish or notion to print any more without wages: no wages, then shall be at least no working and toiling.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Johnson&#x2019;s &#x201C;no man but a blockhead ever wrote, except for money&#x201D; (Boswell&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Life of Johnson</hi>, eds. Hill and Powell (Oxford, <date when="1964-00-00">1964</date>), III, 19). Cf. Carlyle&#x2019;s earlier thoughts on <foreign><hi rend="italic">Entsagen:</hi></foreign> &#x201C;Make thy claim of wages a zero, then; thou hast the world under thy feet&#x201D; (Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi>, p. 191). Carlyle delighted in polarity, in this instance a reconciliation of the practical with the ideal.</note> My own persuasion is that Fraser will come back to the charge, and try me again; but he shall be right welcome to do <hi rend="italic">either</hi> way.&#x2014; I believe I ought to begin getting a Course of Lectures prepared in some measure: that will be the best for me. We shall see.</p>
<p>There has been a change of Servants here since you heard of it: greatly for the better in my opinion. The young Englishwoman (whose grand recommendation, it always seemed to me, was like that of George Lowther&#x2019;s<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> man, the extent of her &#x201C;porridge-bowl&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Appetite&#x201D;?</note>) had no sooner recovered fairly out of her sickness than she began to grow discontented ambitious of rising in the world; and so ended by giving up her place, and nearly failing altogether to get another, even a far worse and lower one. She went off, the great glutton sack, last week; and next day, there arrived (by previous appointment with Miss Fergus of Kirkcaldy) per Edinburgh Steamer as they say, a fresh hand,&#x2014;<foreign>gleg</foreign>-looking [sharp-looking] as a needle, honest-looking, and with a <hi rend="italic">Scotch</hi> tongue in her head; an entirely passable kind of character, as I conjecture; who will do for her time, far more to my mind than ever the other did. They call this new one Helen Mitchell;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Kirkcaldy Helen&#x201D; who stayed until <date when="1846-11-00">Nov. 1846</date> and returned <date when="1848-00-00">1848</date>&#x2013;<date when="1849-00-00">49</date>. The maid who had left was Ellen.</note> she is one of the queerest-looking antics you ever saw; calls herself <pb id="pg-09-377" n="09:377"/>eight-and-twenty, but must be turned of forty, one would think; and really is very cle<supplied>[ver]</supplied>, and I doubt not will do well enough.</p>
<p>Jane is rummaging very much, packing a box for Templand; I am in great haste otherwise. Thank Jenny and Robert for their share in the Letter; especially thank <hi rend="italic">yourself</hi>. I have written to Jack, and sent him your messages. I received a Newspaper from Alick with strokes; no other news: it was the <hi rend="italic">Preston Chronicle</hi>, which I sent back to Manchester whence it had come. I wrote to Jean at Dumfries. I will write to you again when more news come from Rome. There was a Newspaper with strokes since the Letter came.&#x2014;&#x2014; I hope and expect this new enterprise of Robert&#x2019;s will turn out well. He is the man for standing to it; with diligence, with fidelity, discretion and honesty above all. Give him my best wishes for it.&#x2014; O dear Mother, how many things I omit here, which were to be said; which I must leave your own kind heart to fancy for me! Tell me what sort of house this new one is; whether you sleep rightly in it, you and Jenny (as for him he could sleep in a Railway engine I daresay), whether it is warm, smoky, &#x26;c &#x26;c; in short, how you get on, and are. Jane sends you her best regards, and wishes for the new year: she is in an awful <hi rend="italic">fizz</hi> today, getting this &#x201C;box&#x201D; off,&#x2014;which contains, I think, two muslin <foreign>mutches</foreign> [close-fitting day caps] and sundries!&#x2014; The inclosed Letter is my last from America; you can keep it; after reading it, give it a place in your trunk. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Mother; keep youself well; snug among kind friends.

<salute>My dear Sterling,</salute>
<p>The tidings from Madeira were right welcome to us all.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sterling&#x2019;s letter of <date when="1837-11-16">16 Nov.</date></note> The delay and silence had been somewhat longer than we counted on; then <pb id="pg-09-378" n="09:378"/>newspaper accounts of shipwrecks and disaster, with possibility of evil to which poor man is ever liable: all this had alarmed some of us. But now happily there was nothing of that; and everything is as it should be. We can fancy you cantering along there, by the foot of the interior rock-country capped with mist, the sun shining on you, the ocean singing to you;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sterling had written of &#x201C;the bold rough mountains with mist about their summits verdure below &#x26; a bright sun over all.&#x201D;</note> and how with tender reminiscences and hopeful prospections, with poetic dreamings and interpretings, you pass the winter altogether tolerably; and return to us strong in the spring, and not leave us any more. May the Heavens grant it well! I think there are few prayers about any man that are more earnest in me. The South of England, a snug house there, with books, pens, friends, and composed (unclerical) activity,&#x2014;it is a consummation to be wished. Patience, and shuffle the cards.</p>
<p>The packet they are sending off in these days will be an immense <foreign>olla-podrida</foreign> of message, letters, pamphlets; too much for you at one meal; only that like the Prophet Elishah you are to live on it for forty days.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. 1 Kings 19:8.</note> Satiety alternating with starvation: it is a bad but an unavoidable arrangement. This moist Christmas morning, behold, I in my dreariness will add one mess to the Pot,&#x2014;as it were, one cold potatoe to the <hi rend="italic">Irish stew</hi>. Reject it not; seeing the poor contributor has no other.</p>
<p>Nothing can excel my languor, my silent stagnation, since you went. I have been half deaf for a good part of the time; my head as if the left side of it were made of wood. In this state I wrote a long rigmarole on Walter Scott; a thing deserving instant fire-death, but which they are going to print. No mortal could have less wish to speak a syllable about Scott, or indeed about anything in Heaven or in Earth than I then and now; but the will of Destiny must be obeyed. My sole wish is that I could get to hold my tongue for twelve months to come. It is a wish, and almost necessity; for which I am occasionally devising schemes. A little money is requisite: how to gain a little money? Lecture! cries all the world; Lecture on German Literature, on European Literature, on the French Revolution, on Things in General!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi>, p. 18.</note> I can yet make nothing of London lecturing; I want two things, yea three; I want knowledge, of my audience, of myself; I want impudence. I want health. Others there are that say I should give a course on German in Oxford and Cambridge to the young men! <pb id="pg-09-379" n="09:379"/>I really believe I shall stir in that, and ascertain what hope is in it; there seems to me no Lecturing I could understand so well. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Ach Gott!</hi></foreign> But on the whole, it is useless to kick against the pricks.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Acts 9:5.</note> If a man is to be doomed to death because he will not get upon the housetops, and cry, <foreign><hi rend="italic">me voil&#xE0;</hi></foreign> [here I am], I suppose, he must get up, and cry it&#x2014;to the requisite extent. They send me letters, commendations about that Book, how glorious it is and will be; to which I have to answer with the poor French man: <foreign><hi rend="italic">Gloire, donne-moi du pain</hi></foreign> [Glory, give me bread].<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The expression of a starving French poet in a novel, according to Jane Carlyle (see Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM,</hi> II, 39).</note>&#x2014; But this is a bad strain I am getting into. I wish of all men that I had my John Sterling here at present. We will go on hoping, the thing I used to call &#x201C;desperate hope.&#x201D; Nay on the whole I really do always believe that I am on the way towards peace, and health both of body and mind. I go along like a Planet Jupiter with his five Belts, which are supposed to be five Storm-Zones full of tempest, rain, and thunder and lightning,&#x2014;Jupiter himself very tranquilly progressive in the middle of them. There! See if you can do the like, you clear Phosphoros<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Morning star.</note> smiling always in the Sun&#x2019;s face; clear Mercury, living always in the Sun&#x2019;s arms, at a temperature, they say, hotter than redhot iron! Such planets, are they not extremely peculiar in the world?&#x2014;</p>
<p>Long before this you will have read Wilson&#x2019;s leading-article, and your own poetry beatified.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370608-TC-JOST-01">TC to <sic>JS</sic><corr>JOST</corr>, <date when="1837-06-08">9 [8] June</date></ref>.</note> Wilson&#x2019;s great heart never shews itself better than when he falls in with a man like you. My counsel is, Accept his recognition of <hi rend="italic">you</hi> (for that is not so high even as my own), and rejoice in it as a man has right to do: but as to <hi rend="italic">your vocation</hi> for writing in verse,&#x2014;do not believe Wilson a whit! His impressions of all things are vivid, fiercely emphatic, but indefinite, vague, not in the least to be depended on for practice. And yet I look to see you now write a great quantity more of verses. Well, my friend, you must then. Nothing can convince a man, nothing ought to convince him, except his own experiment: let him <hi rend="italic">try;</hi> send out radii, in what directions his own daimon and judgement orders, till the <hi rend="italic">cirmumference</hi> make him bound back again! And so good speed to you, my brave brother John; and this one counsel (which I have a mind to tattoo on the back of each of your hands so all-momentous is it), <foreign><hi rend="italic">Festina lente</hi></foreign> [Hasten slowly]. I declare, it depends all on that.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-09-380" n="09:380"/>I read the R&#xfc;ckert Translations from the Chinese last week:<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Friedrich R&#xfc;ckert, <hi rend="italic">Schi-King: Chinesisches Liederbuch gesammelt von Confucius</hi> (Altona, <date when="1833-00-00">1833</date>).</note> they are very interesting, very beautiful: harvest-songs, drinking-songs, songs of household calamity and felicity; an authentic melodious human voice from the distance of the Yellow Sea, from the time of Quang-fu-tchee<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Confucius, Latinized form of K&#x2019;ung Fu-tze: philosopher K&#x2019;ung.</note> and the Prophet Ezekiel! Authentic <hi rend="italic">sincere:</hi> there is almost no other merit for me in written things. The sacred Scripture itself is sacred and divine because it is more sincere than any other Book. This R&#xfc;ckert shall abide with me in love, for its own sake and yours. I have read a great many other things; but they are worth next to nothing: trash, trash! One little Paper only there is which I hope to send you by and by; a thing of very great merit and notability indeed: by your friend Emerson, the American, author of that little Book called <hi rend="italic">Nature</hi>. It is in the form of an &#x201C;Oration&#x201D; to some general assembly of the Transatlantic brethren of Letters, calling itself &#x201C;Phi Beta Kappa<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Love of wisdom, guide of life.&#x201D;</note> Society,&#x201D;&#x2014;have <hi rend="italic">you</hi> Greek enough to interpret that? I have not. But for the rest, as I say this &#x201C;Oration&#x201D; to the &#x03C6; &#x03B2; &#x03BA; is a right thing, such a tone in it as never came across the water before; as I have not heard in the world of late years. &#x201C;Some call it mad, some inspired,&#x201D; says Miss Martineau; whose copy is the only one I have yet seen. When mine comes I will send it you. I introduced you to Emerson the other week; told him that &#x201C;Nature&#x201D; was gone to Madeira, in the hands of a very unmanageable kind of fellow, and that he must look in Blackwood and make friends with him. O it is blessed, most blessed, to hear a man&#x2019;s articulate voice, in the infinite Babylonish jargon which is like to drive one entirely desperate at times.</p>
<p>Your horror of Goethe, your love of him and dread of being swallowed by him, does not in the least hurt my feelings.<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sterling had written: &#x201C;As to reading I have been looking at Goethe, especially the <hi rend="italic">Life</hi>&#x2014;much as a shying horse looks at a post&#x2014; In truth I am afraid of him,&#x2014;I enjoy and admire him so much I feel I could easily be tempted to go along with him&#x2014; And yet I have a deeply rooted &#x26; old persuasion that he was the most splendid of anachronisms&#x2014;a thoroughly nay intensely Pagan Life in an age when it is men&#x2019;s duty to be Christian. I therefore never take him up without a kind of inward check as if I were trying some forbidden spell, while on the other hand there is so infinitely much to be learnt from him &#x26; it is so needful to understand the world we live in &#x26; our own age &#x26; especially its greatest minds that I cannot bring myself to burn my books as the converted Magicians did or sink them as did Prospero. There must as I think have been some prodigious defect in his mind to let him hold such views as his about women &#x26; some other things&#x2014;&#x26; in another respect I find so much coldness &#x26; hollowness as to the highest Truths &#x26; feel so strongly that the heaven he looks up to is but a vault of ice&#x2014;that these two indications leading to the same conclusion go far to convince me he was a profoundly immoral &#x26; irreligious spirit with as rare faculties of intelligence as ever belonged to any one. &#x2026; I never take him up without high admiration or lay him down without real sorrow for what he chose to be.&#x201D; A. Carlyle gives evidence that Sterling&#x2019;s opinion of Goethe became more favorable before his death in <date when="1844-00-00">1844</date> (see <hi rend="italic">CMSB</hi>, p. 212). Moncure D. Conway wrote in his <hi rend="italic">Autobiography</hi> (London, <date when="1904-00-00">1904</date>), I, 355: &#x201C;At every moment I was impressed by the truth of John Sterling&#x2019;s characterisation of Carlyle in &#x2018;The Onyx Ring,&#x2019; [<date when="1838-00-00">1838</date>] where as Collins he figures along with Goethe (Walsingham). I had read the story in my youth, and although in later years I do not accept the censorious estimates of Goethe, John Sterling&#x2019;s Carlyle has appeared to me as profound as Carlyle&#x2019;s Sterling.&#x201D;</note> It is all right on <pb id="pg-09-381" n="09:381"/>your part; and yet it must not continue there. Study the man, my friend; get acquainted with him; you will most probably be obliged to get acquainted with him yet. Then; I think, you will find him not an Anachronism in any wise, but a <hi rend="italic">Chronism</hi>, nay the only one hitherto discovered on this Planet of ours in these distracted days of ours. No other man whatever, as I say always, has yet ascertained what Christianity is to us, and what Paganity is, and all manner of other <hi rend="italic">anities</hi> whatsoever; and been alive at all points in his own year of grace with the life appropriate to that. This in brief is the definition I have always given of the man since I first knew him: the sight of such a man was to me a Gospel of Gospels, and did literally I believe save me from destruction outward and inward. We are far parted now; but the memory of him shall ever be blessed to me as that of a Deliverer from death.&#x2014; But, on the whole, O friend John, what a belief thou hast <hi rend="italic">in the Devil!</hi> I declare myself an entire sceptic in that faith. Was there, is there, or will there be a great Intellect ever heard tell of without first a true and great Heart to begin with? Never; if my experience and faith in this God&#x2019;s world have taught me anything at all. Think it not, suspect it not. Worse <hi rend="italic">blasphemy</hi> I could not readily utter. Nay look you in your own heart, and consider! <supplied>[The]</supplied> Devil&#x2019;s name is Darkness and that only; <foreign><hi rend="italic">Eigend&#xfc;nkel</hi></foreign> [Self-conceit], the blackest kind of <supplied>[Dark]</supplied>ness, and wicked enough for any purpose. Fear no seeing man, therefore; know that <hi rend="italic">he</hi> is of Heaven, whoever else be not; that the Arch-Enemy, as I say, is the Arch-stupid: I call this my Fortieth Church Article,&#x2014;which absorbs into it, and covers up in silence, all the other Thirty-nine!</p>
<p>Since I began writing John Mill has been here; he is of purpose to write to you himself, and get your help in his <hi rend="italic">Review</hi>, which has now become wholly his. What will you do? Mill himself means really well, and according as you mean all the way he goes: he is also parting <pb id="pg-09-382" n="09:382"/>from the Anatomical-preparation Radicals, deadest of men; which is a good symptom.</p>

<p><salute>My dear Sir,&#x2014;</salute>Will you accept, after too long delay, my hearty thanks for your kind and estimable gift,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The first 2 vols. of <hi rend="italic">Denkw&#xfc;rdigkeiten</hi>, and Eckermann&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Gespr&#xE4;che mit Goethe</hi> (see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18360912-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1836-09-12">12 Sept. 1836</date></ref>).</note> which, a good many weeks ago, on returning hither out of Scotland, I found awaiting me here? The name Varnhagen von Ense was long since honourably known to me; in the book &#x2018;Rahel&#x2019;s Gallery,&#x2019;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Galerie von Bildnissen aus Rahel&#x2019;s Umgang und Briefwechsel</hi>, 2 vols. (Leipzig, <date when="1836-00-00">1836</date>).</note> as in a clear mirror, I had got a glimpse of the man himself and the world he lived in; and now, behold! the mirror-image, grown a reality, has come towards me, holding out a friendly right hand in the name<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Goethe.</note> of the ever dear to both of us! Right heartily I grasp that kind hand, and say again and again, &#x2018;Be welcome, with thanks.&#x2019;</p>
<p>If it were suitable or possible to explain amid what complexity of difficulties, engagements, sicknesses, I struggle to toil along here, my slowness in answering would not seem inexcusable to you. I wished to <pb id="pg-09-383" n="09:383"/>read the book first. A book unread is still but the <hi rend="italic">offer</hi> of a gift; I needed first to take it into me, and then tell you with proper emphasis that it had in very truth become mine. Not till these late days was the leisure and the mood for such an enjoyment granted me. The two volumes of &#x2018;Denkw&#xfc;rdigkeiten&#x2019; remained like a little kindly inn, where, after long solitary wandering in bad weather, I should find repose and friends. Once more I say to you, and now with proper significance, Many thanks.</p>
<p>Insight, liveliness, originality, the hardy adroit spirit of a man who has seen and suffered and done, in all things acquitting himself like a man, shines out on me, in graceful coherence, light, sharp, decisive, from all parts of this as of your other books. It is a great, and to me a most rare, pleasure in these times to find that I agree wholly on all important matters with a writer; that in many highest cases his words are precisely such as I should wish to hear spoken. But, indeed, your view of Goethe being also mine, we set out as it were from a great centre of unity, and travel lovingly together towards all manner of regions. For the rest, nothing pleases me more than your descriptions of facts and transactions, a class of objects which grows continually in significance with me, as much else yearly and daily dwindles away, in treating which a man best of all shows what manner of man he is. I read with special interest your Doctor Bollmann,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Justus Bollman (<date when="1769-00-00">1769</date>&#x2013;<date when="1821-00-00">1821</date>), born Hoya, Hanover, came to the United States, <date when="1796-00-00">1796</date>, where he became the confidential agent of Aaron Burr.</note> a name not altogether new to me; I could read volume after volume of such autobiography as that you give us&#x2014;such Halle universities,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Halle, Saxony, one of the German Universities attended by Varnhagen.</note> such Battles of Wagram,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In <date when="1809-00-00">1809</date>, when Napoleon defeated the Austrian Army. Varnhagen was wounded there.</note> such Fichtes,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18210316-TC-RM-01"><sic>1:343</sic><corr>TC to RM, <date when="1821-03-16">16 March 1821</date></corr></ref>.</note> Wolffs,<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Friedrich August Wolf (<date when="1759-00-00">1759</date>&#x2013;<date when="1824-00-00">1824</date>), classical philologist, professor at Halle University, <date when="1783-00-00">1783</date>&#x2013;<date when="1807-00-00">1807</date>.</note> Chamissos,<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Adelbert von Chamisso (see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350615-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1835-06-15">15 June 1835</date></ref>).</note> and the high, tranquil-mournful, almost magical spirit of your Rahel shining over them with a light as of stars! You must not cease; you must continue. That we might <hi rend="italic">see</hi>, eyes were given us; and a tongue, to tell accurately what we had got to see. It is the Alpha and Omega of all intellect that man has. No poetry, hardly even that of a Goethe, is equal to the true image of reality&#x2014;had one eyes to see that. I often say to myself, the highest kind of writing, poetry or what else we may call it, that of <pb id="pg-09-384" n="09:384"/>the Bible for instance, has nothing to do with fiction at all, but with beliefs, with facts. Go on, and prosper.</p>
<p>If you see Herr Criminal director Hitzig,<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-05/lt-18301023-TC-G-01"><sic>5:180</sic><corr>TC to G, <date when="1830-10-23">23 Oct. 1830</date></corr></ref>.</note> pray remember me very kindly to him. Your friend Chamisso is also one I love. Dr. Mundt<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably Theodor Mundt (<date when="1808-00-00">1808</date>&#x2013;<date when="1861-00-00">61</date>), journalist, novelist, critic, and later professor at Breslau and Berlin.</note> will mourn with me that the brave Rosen,<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Professor of Oriental Literature at London University, he had died on <date when="1837-09-12">12 Sept.</date> See also <ref target="volume-08/lt-18360625-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1836-06-25">25 June 1836</date></ref>.</note> his friend and mine who brought him hither, has been so suddenly summoned for ever away. He is one whom many regret. Do you know Friedrich R&#xfc;ckert? If you stand in any correspondence with him, I will bid you tell him that I got acquainted altogether unexpectedly with his &#x2018;Hariri&#x2019; last summer, and rejoiced over it for weeks as over a found jewel.<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370608-TC-JOST-01">TC to <sic>JS</sic><corr>JOST</corr>, <date when="1837-06-08">9 [8] June</date></ref>.</note></p>
<p>No such book had I seen for years; it set me searching, tho&#x2019; with little effect, thro&#x2019; Sylvestre de Sacy<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Antoine Isaac Silvestre de Sacy (<date when="1758-00-00">1758</date>&#x2013;<date when="1838-00-00">1838</date>), translator from Arabic including <hi rend="italic">Les s&#xE9;ances de Hariri</hi> (Paris, <date when="1822-00-00">1822</date>).</note> and others; it remains a distinct acquisition for me that I shall never part with.</p>
<p>His Chinese Song-book I have been enjoying in these very weeks.<note n="15" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-09/lt-18371225-TC-JOST-01">TC to <sic>JS</sic><corr>JOST</corr>, <date when="1837-12-25">25 Dec.</date></ref></note> He is a man whose heartiest friends must lie wide-scattered in such an era as ours, and ought to speak out as they have opportunity.<note n="16" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The last two paragraphs follow the paragraph beginning &#x201C;perhaps you sometimes&#x201D; in <hi rend="italic">Last Words</hi>, but the sense indicates that they follow Carlyle&#x2019;s first comments on R&#xfc;ckert and they have therefore been replaced there.</note></p>
<p>Perhaps you sometimes write to Weimar; if so, pray offer our peculiar regards, my wife&#x2019;s and mine, to Madame von Goethe. I sent Dr. Eckermann a packet and letter, six months ago,<note n="17" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370609-TC-JPE-01">TC to JPE, <date when="1837-06-09">9 June</date></ref>.</note> to which there is yet no answer. His &#x2018;Gespr&#xE4;che&#x2019; and your remarks on them were right welcome.</p>
<p>I have been writing a Book on the French Revolution, which will perhaps get to Berlin by and by. German Literature diffuses itself here and in America, rapidly, lustily, without further effort of mine. Its consequences, as I calculate, will be great and beneficial, on the new generation now rising into activity. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Deutschland</hi></foreign> will reclaim her great Colony; we shall become more <foreign><hi rend="italic">Deutsch</hi></foreign>, that is to say more <hi rend="italic">English</hi>, at same time.</p>
<p>The <foreign><hi rend="italic">Deutsche Stamm</hi></foreign> [German race] is now clearly in the ascendant; seems as if it were destined to take the main part of the <pb id="pg-09-385" n="09:385"/>earthly globe, and rule it for a time! <foreign><hi rend="italic">Tapferkeit</hi></foreign> [Valor], their characteristic according to Goethe, deserves to do it.</p>
<p><closer><salute>With true esteem, with thanks and affectionate wishes, I subscribe myself in hopes of meeting again some time, my dear Sir,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Miss Wilson,</salute>
<p>Ever since I saw you, as before, I have been half deaf, very busy,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Writing &#x201C;Sir Walter Scott&#x201D;; see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370921-TC-JAC-01"><sic>9:311</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1837-09-21">21 Sept. 1837</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-09/lt-18371110-TC-JSM-01"><sic>350</sic><corr>TC to JSM, <date when="1837-11-10">10 Nov. 1837</date></corr></ref>.</note> and almost altogether miserable: I seem, as it were wrapped in a <hi rend="italic">case</hi> of catarrh, which will probably last me thro&#x2019; the foggy months. There is nothing for me but to crouch low, and keep quiet tho&#x2019; the sky came down. Taylor<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henry Taylor (see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18311110-TC-MAC-01"><sic>6:40</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1831-11-10">10 Nov. 1831</date></corr></ref>), who wanted TC to lecture on the French Revolution (<ref target="volume-09/lt-18371126-TC-AC-01"><sic>9:354</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1837-11-26">26 Nov. 1837</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-09/lt-18371212-TC-JAC-01"><sic>366</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1837-12-12">12 Dec. 1837</date></corr></ref>).</note> was here one night in my absence, speaking about Lecturing;&#x2014;it makes me shudder to the marrow of the bone.</p>
<p>I remember an innocent looking young lady<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> who came here once with the Misses Somerville:<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mary and Martha; see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370717-JWC-TC-01"><sic>9:249</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1837-07-17">17 July 1837</date></corr></ref>.</note> she shall see me again to her innocent <pb id="pg-12-394" n="12:394"/>heart&#x2019;s content, since it will give you a little satisfaction that she do it. Thursday the <date when="1837-12-14">14<hi rend="italic">th</hi></date><hi rend="italic">,</hi> or any day. Only I must beg that you would say tea instead of Dinner; the latter being, in my present catarrhal state, a very serious enterprise.</p>
<p>My Wife, with thanks and compliments to you, reports favourably of herself; and indeed seems by dint of care to do wonderfully well.</p>
 <p>I will hope to see you one of these afternoons, for my hurry of work will abate ere long.&#x2014; (A shocking pen!)</p>

 <salute>My dear M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Wedgewood [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>]</salute>
 <p>Will you wear this little fashionable crotchet for my sake&#x2014;or if that be too much to ask of the rational mind, will you at least give it house-room, that the <hi rend="italic">flare</hi> of it may sometimes catch your eye, and remind you of one, who would continue to remember you, tho&#x2019; you should be much longer absent than I can bring myself to believe that you will be.</p>
 <p>I feel as if I had a thousand things to say to you, but when I would shape them into words they all resolve themselves into this; I love you dearly, and am very sorry you are going away.</p>
 <p>You will return however before long&#x2014;of that I have almost no doubt; but whether <hi rend="italic">I</hi> shall be here to rejoice with others at your return is a question, which I can do nothing so wise with, as try to keep as much as possible out of my thoughts.</p>
 <p>Meanwhile will you be pleased to reflect, that as it has not been <hi rend="italic">undesignedly</hi> you have gained my affection, you are in some sort bound to make it as little as possible a source of regret to me. When you are settled in your new place you will write to me; will you not?&#x2014; You will tell me of your country life, and let me tell you, now and then, of <hi rend="italic">our</hi> life (such as it is) and how we wish for you back?&#x2014; God bless you dear M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Wedgewood&#x2014;wherever you go, my thoughts will often follow you, and it will be the gladdest news for me that I am to see you again.</p>
