<p><salute>My poor little Goody</salute> ought surely to have slept after writing me such a Letter!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <ref target="volume-19/lt-18450928-JWC-TC-01"><date when="1845-09-28">28 Sept.</date></ref>, written near midnight, and after which she did not sleep well.</note> Virtue is not its own reward; something particular always occur to prevent it!&#x2014; My Mother handed me in the Packet this morning shortly after six,&#x2014;a welcome interruption to my watching; for I sleep ill here, as the general rule, and had been awake today from five. It was worth being awake for such a message; which I was not in the least looking for, till ten o&#x2019;clock at soonest; the tailors had forestalled the Post this time.</p>
<p>Poor old Sterling! It is really very melancholy that sinking down of his in so isolated and forsaken a condition. Alone, left alone in the theatre of Life, <pb id="pg-20-4" n="20:4"/>the fellow actors almost all gone, the lights almost all snuffed out! Certainly if one can in any way alleviate him, poor old fellow, it is one&#x2019;s clear call to do it. Anthony wanders at large; but I suppose if he even were at home, he could be of next to no comfort, such is the relation between them. Poor old Thunderer! There were worse men, whose ill qualities did not lie so apparent. Of course you will do for him whatever you can. We will still hope the poor old fellow may get to his feet again.&#x2014;</p>
<p>I am very glad to hear of your visit at Bath House, &#x201C;gay firm about the feet!&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. JWC&#x2019;s &#x201C;guy <foreign>ticht</foreign> aboot the head.&#x201D;</note> There is nothing to hinder you, in spite of Mrs Buller&#x2019;s prediction, to get on very well there, I should hope. Persons of sense, with no talebearer or other piece of concrete Insanity between them, can get on very well. The Lady Harriet has a genius for ruling? Well, I don&#x2019;t know but she may. And on the whole did you ever see any Lady that had <hi rend="italic">not</hi> some slight touch of a genius that way, my Goodykin! I know a Lady&#x2014; But I will say nothing, lest I bring mischief about my ears. Nay, she is very obedient too, that little Lady I allude to, and <hi rend="italic">has</hi> a genius for being ruled withal, Heaven bless her always! Not a bad little Dame at all. &#x201C;She and I did ay very weel together; and &#x2019;tweel it was not every one that could have done with her!&#x201D;&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p><foreign>Eheu</foreign> [Alas]! This day I have walked twice; one of the times above ten miles: round by Blawerry (you may remember it on the wild hilltop by the moor road from Lockerby hither); by Banks Hill, and home by the mountains again. Solitary almost as Arabic Petrea,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In ancient geography, NW Arabia.</note>&#x2014;only some straggling reaper-fields visible in the distance; and the mountains all coated in grey <hi rend="italic">woolen</hi> (or fog); a wild grey wind howling and moaning. For rain of late I have had no right walking. My health in spite of sleeplessness and mud-weather does certainly not deteriorate. I am very idle, however; and ought to think of returning.&#x2014; &#x2014; The four Tailors are struggling to have done this night. We have only been moderately successful; the dressing-gown <hi rend="italic">looks</hi> better than I expected, but I fear hardly fits so well; and seems as if it would need <hi rend="italic">lining</hi> farther. Black coat seemingly rather tolerable; two waistcoats tolerable, two pairs of trowsers really worthy of praise! I long for Goody&#x2019;s vote upon the subject of them all. I do wish I were beside her again, Sorrow of my Life as she is.</p>
<p>It begins to strike me I shall perhaps have to go in one of those wretched Steamers after all. I have no wrappage worth a farthing; nothing that can in the least stand the outside of a Coach at this Season; and except perhaps Mackintoshes I do not see what is to be <hi rend="italic">bought</hi> here. I wish I had a P. <pb id="pg-20-5" n="20:5"/>jacket;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Pea or pilot jacket.</note>&#x2014;but wishing won&#x2019;t bring it: I must wait till I get home.&#x2014; &#x2014; Miss Julia&#x2019;s<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Julia Paulet&#x2019;s.</note> Letter is very like herself; but the hand, something of a <foreign><hi rend="italic">quidquid</hi></foreign> as Sam Aitken<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >(<date when="1790-00-00">1790</date>&#x2013;<date when="1847-00-00">1847</date>), Edinburgh bookseller; see <ref target="volume-01/lt-18200000-JBW-EA-01"><sic>1:219</sic><corr>JBW to EA, <date when="1820-01-01">1 Jan. 1820</date></corr></ref>.</note> would say, is against the effect of it. One feels as if it might be very sad to stand <hi rend="italic">her</hi> chances of a Destiny in this putrescent world,&#x2014;poor Julia; and yet to herself the outlook is doubtless beautiful enough. &#x201C;The cheek of that young enthusiasm.&#x201D;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. &#x201C;beautiful enthusiasm,&#x201D; <ref target="volume-19/lt-18450803-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1845-08-03">3 Aug.</date>]</ref>.</note>&#x2014; Poor Mrs Paulet herself is really interesting to me, and her situation not without its <foreign>pathos</foreign>. A musical genial soul like that, planted amid the Calvinist Gigmanity of Liverpool: it is really like Life under a nightmare,&#x2014;which, alas, all Life is, and has been, for us all!</p>
<p><closer><salute>Good night, my brave little Wifie. Grey shades are gathering behind Burnswark; the wind piping mournfully thro&#x2019; every crevice. My Mother enters to bid me send &#x201C;her kindest respects and not forget.&#x201D; Good night my own little <foreign>Dame</foreign>. Blessings always&#x2014;</salute></closer><name>T. C.</name></p>
<ps><p>Emerson&#x2019;s Letter<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson wrote, <date when="1845-09-15">15 Sept.</date>, that he was about to give six lectures in Boston and, not having heard from TC in a long time, wished to have news of him. He wrote again, <date when="1845-09-30">30 Sept.</date>, acknowledging TC&#x2019;s letter of <ref target="volume-19/lt-18450829-TC-RWE-01"><date when="1845-08-29">29 Aug.</date></ref>, asking for a copy of <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi>, and offering &#x201C;very glad congratulations to Jane Carlyle on an occasion, I am sure, of great peace &#x26; relief to her spirit.&#x201D;</note> is hardly worth sending: however, here it is. I had already as it were answered it.</p></ps>

<p><salute>Well!</salute> now I am subsided again&#x2014;set in for a quiet evening&#x2014;at leisure to write, and with plenty to write about, I know not how it is; I seem to myself to be leading a most solitary and <hi rend="italic">virtuous</hi> and eventless life here at this <hi rend="italic">dead</hi> season of the year; and yet when I sit down to write, I have so many things to tell always that I am puzzled where to begin! Decidedly, I was meant to have been a subaltern of the Daily Press&#x2014;not &#x201C;a Penny-Lady,&#x201D; but a Penny-a-liner<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;In Scotland the &#x2018;Penny Ladies&#x2019; (extraneously so-called) were busy, &#x2018;benevolent&#x2019; persons; subscribers of a penny a week for educating, &#x26;c. &#x26;c., not with much success&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note in <hi rend="italic">LM</hi>). A penny-a-liner was a hack journalist poorly paid by the line.</note>&#x2014;for it is not only a faculty with me but a necessity of my nature to make a great deal out of nothing!</p>
<p><pb id="pg-20-6" n="20:6"/>To begin with something I have been treasuring up for a week (for I would not <foreign>hollo</foreign> till we were out of the wood) I have <hi rend="italic">put down the Dog!</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Oh, my heroine! Endless were her feats in regard to all this, and her gentle talent too! I could not have lived here but for that, had there been nothing more&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note in <hi rend="italic">LM</hi>).</note>&#x2014; &#x201C;The Dog?&#x2014;wasn&#x2019;t he put down at Christmas&#x2014;with a hare?&#x201D;&#x2014; it seemed so, and &#x201C;we wished we might get it&#x201D;!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Variant of coterie speech, &#x201C;don&#x2019;t you wish you may get it.&#x201D;</note> But on my return, I found him in the old place, at the back of the wall, barking &#x201C;like&#x2014;like&#x2014;anything&#x201D;!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech.</note> &#x201C;Helen!&#x201D; I said, with the calmness of a great despair, &#x201C;is not that the same Dog&#x201D;? &#x201C;Deed is it!&#x201D; said she &#x201C;and the whole two months you have been away its tongue has never lain!&#x2014;it has driven <hi rend="italic">even me</hi> almost distracted&#x201D;! I said no more; but I had my own thoughts on the subject&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">poison!</hi>&#x2014;a pistol-bullet!&#x2014;the Metropolitan Police!&#x2014; One way or other that Dog&#x2014;or <hi rend="italic">I</hi>&#x2014;must terminate!

Helen was sent off with the note and the whiskey&#x2014;and I sat all concentrated, awaiting her return as if the fate of Nations had depended on my diplomacy&#x2014;and so it did&#x2014;to a certain extent!&#x2014;would not the inspirations of &#x201C;the first man in Europe&#x201D; be modified<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Quiz</hi>, mainly this, and glad mockery of some who deserved it!&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note in <hi rend="italic">LM</hi>).

At Christmas they &#x201C;had sent it into the Country for three months, <hi rend="italic">to learn to be quiet</hi>&#x201D;&#x2014;and then chained it in the old place&#x2014; Now they would take some final measure&#x2014; Next morning came a note from the Washerman himself&#x2014;written on glazed note-paper, with a crowquill&#x2014;apologizing&#x2014; promising&#x2014;he could not put it away entirely as it is &#x201C;a great protection&#x201D; to him and &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">belonged to a Relation</hi>&#x201D; (who shall say where <hi rend="italic">sentiment</hi> may <hi rend="italic">not</hi> exist?) but he &#x201C;had untied it&#x201D; and would take care it gave me no further trouble&#x2014;and he &#x201C;returned his grateful thanks for <hi rend="italic">what AS been sent</hi>&#x201D; It is a week ago, and one may now rest satisfied that <hi rend="italic">the typing up</hi> caused the whole nuisance&#x2014;the Dog is to be seen going about there all day in the yard, like any other Christian Dog&#x2014;&#x201C;carrying out&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">your</hi> principle of <hi rend="italic">Silence</hi> not merely &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">platonically</hi>&#x201D; but <hi rend="italic">practically</hi>&#x2014; since that night, as Helen remarks, &#x201C;it has not said one word&#x201D;!

<p>I took tea with Sterling on Monday night&#x2014;walked there and he sent the <pb id="pg-20-8" n="20:8"/>carriage home with me. It is very difficult to know how to do with him&#x2014; He does not seem to me <hi rend="italic">essentially mad</hi>&#x2014;but rather <hi rend="italic">mad with the apprehension of madness</hi>&#x2014; A state of mind I can perfectly understand&#x2014;<foreign>moi</foreign>&#x2014; He forgets something Anthony&#x2019;s name; for example, or mine, or how many children he has, and then he gets into a rage that he cannot recollect, and then he stamps about and rings the bells and brings everybody in the house to &#x201C;help him to remember&#x201D;&#x2014;and when all will not do; he exclaims&#x2014; &#x201C;I am going <hi rend="italic">mad</hi> by God&#x201D;! and then he <hi rend="italic">is</hi> mad&#x2014;as mad as a March hare.&#x2014; <hi rend="italic">I</hi> can do next to nothing for him beyond cheering him up a little, for the moment. Yesterday again I went a little drive with him&#x2014;of course not without Saunders<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Evidently a servant.</note> as well as the Coachman&#x2014; He told me that he when he heard I had written about him he &#x201C;cried for three days&#x201D; Anthony&#x2019;s desertion seems the central point around which all his hypicondrical Ideas congregate&#x2014; Anthony has never written him the scrape of a pen since he left him insensible at Manchester nor ever <hi rend="italic">written about him</hi> so far as himself or his Manservant knows&#x2014;</p>
<p>Yesterday I had a call from&#x2014;Nell Gwyn<note n="15" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC&#x2019;s nickname for Susanna Arethusa Milner-Gibson; see <ref target="volume-19/lt-18450923-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1845-09-23">23 Sept.</date></ref>].

<p>Who else have I seen&#x2014;? nobody else I think except Mazzini, whom I was beginning to fancy the Jewess must have made an <foreign><hi rend="italic">enlevement</hi></foreign> [kidnapping] of&#x2014;and <foreign><hi rend="italic">enlev&#xE9;</hi></foreign> he had been, sure enough&#x2014;but not by the Jewess&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">by himself</hi>&#x2014;and only the length of Oxford or rather he <hi rend="italic">meant</hi> to go only the length of Oxford&#x2014;but with his usual practicality let himself be carried sixty miles further&#x2014;to a Place he called <hi rend="italic">Swinton</hi>(?)<note n="16" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Swindon&#x201D; (note in <hi rend="italic">LM</hi>). Mazzini apparently traveled by mistake as far as Swindon, 78 mi. W of London and ca. 28 mi.

<p><salute>Blessings on thee,</salute> dear little woman under difficult circumstances! Here is my second letter received duly this morning, and nothing but good news comes from an indefatigable Goody. That Dog was more or less the sorrow of my life all the time you were away, tho&#x2019; I said nothing of it: Bow-wow-wow! at all hours of the day, especially at night when one was shut in, expecting a little composure. Never was bottle of whisky better bestowed, if it quiet the damnable brute even for a month or two.&#x2014; Alas, one cannot get much quiet in this world. Here, in mornings when one awakes before five, there is a combination of noises, the arithmetical catalogue of which might interest a mind of sensibility. Cocks, pigs, calves, dogs, clogs of women&#x2019;s feet, creaking of door-hinges, masons breaking whinstone, and carts loading stones! But I have learned to care nothing about it: I think, &#x201C;It is the law of Nature; and are not thy poor Brothers and Sisters, thy poor old Mother too, toiling away in the midst of it!&#x201D; Once or twice I have fallen sound asleep in the middle of the whole concert of Discords. We shall be quiet one day; the Destinies, I think, do mean that at least for us.&#x2014;</p>
<p>This day we are in the tail of <hi rend="italic">sixty hours</hi> of continuous rain; a little uncertain whether we shall give it up, or continue for another twenty-four! Nobody got out yesterday; except persons totally aquatic: happily the fire did not smoke in this room; I had &#x201C;books, tobacco and <foreign>gugkuk</foreign>,&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;An academical&#x2014;beer&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note, Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi> 15).</note>&#x2014;passed, when fairly left private, really very happy and not useless hours. Dined on two eggs, a slice of bread (half an ounce in extent), and a small bowl of curds and cream. Today, however, I decided that not even Annandale rain should keep me altogether destitute of a walk under the sky; set out accordingly after breakfast, with an umbrella, to meet the Post; met him on Middlebie Brae, got my Letter from him, read it under the umbrella, then splashed along, thro&#x2019; the Hamlet of Middlebie,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#xBE; mi. S of Scotsbrig.</note> up towards Burnswark, a fair <foreign>modicum</foreign> of walk, and have here returned, gone thro&#x2019; my letter a second time. And now the rain may end or not, as it likes. Few modes of life are more in contrast with each other; than my present temporary mode with my usual one! Instruction lies in it, profit may lie in it:&#x2014;at any rate, it is swiftly ending. I wait for the <hi rend="italic">final</hi> Proofsheets of my <hi rend="italic">Index</hi> &#x26;c (not wishing to hear of that subject after my return at all): and then I think of lifting my luggage again with my face homeward. You are still safe in <pb id="pg-20-11" n="20:11"/>answering this Letter: answer it; but observe in the next Letter what is said about Addresses.&#x2014; <foreign>Eheu</foreign>! I wish I were at anchor again.</p>
<p>Poor old lonely Sterling&#x2014;poor Nell Gwyn, Maria Magdalen <hi rend="italic">without</hi> the penitence! If you can manage it as you predict, there will be no harm: but otherwise Maria, as the Queen of all that is <hi rend="italic">pinchbeck</hi> in London Quality, is not a good connexion! Poor Nell!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Shall I go by Liverpool or not? You, I suppose, have no interest in it; can advise me only to please myself? I really am defective in wrappage; contemplate with some horror the being bottled up for 24 hours all in a piece. We shall see. The Tailors have all ended, in a satisfactory manner; nothing but the Proofsheets, which may now come any day; and then if the weather improve not, I really <hi rend="italic">ought</hi> to be off.</p>
<p>If you promised Lady Harriet to stay &#x201C;the whole winter,&#x201D; there will be no possibility of keeping such a promise! Indeed, as Mr Croaker<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Character in Goldsmith&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">The Good Natur&#x2019;d Man;</hi> see <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340627-TC-AC-01"><sic>7:226</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1834-06-27">27 June 1834</date></corr></ref>.</note> says, I wish we may be all as well at the end of that business as at the beginning! For which purpose we will try to take in our ground well; and dealing wisely hope to get thro&#x2019; well too: why not? Decidedly it is a good the gods provide,&#x2014;&#x201C;and a credit to you,&#x201D; as Mahomet says!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <hi rend="italic">Heroes and Hero-Worship, Works</hi> 5:68. For &#x201C;a good the gods provide,&#x201D; see Dryden, &#x201C;Alexander&#x2019;s Feast.&#x201D;</note>&#x2014; Here is her Note; a free-flowing merry thing: put it into a drawer, for there are some dates in it, and an answer must be sent.&#x2014; What <hi rend="italic">are</hi> the Moons and Stars for? Thou ever-inventive Goody!&#x2014; <closer><salute>Blessings on thee my brave little woman! <foreign>Ewig</foreign> [Always]</salute></closer> <name>T.C.</name></p>

<p>A Day of the brightness of Silver; all Nature, after her terrible washing, grown quite a Beauty!

If the weather <hi rend="italic">were</hi> again to brighten up, I could improve in health to an amazing <pb id="pg-20-12" n="20:12"/>extent by a little tarrying in the Silence!

<salute>Dear Jean,</salute>
<p>I am much obliged by your Note; and doubly so by your keeping off of that &#x201C;<foreign>Troubadour</foreign>,&#x201D; who would have been a very awkward customer here at present!&#x2014; Mr Johnston<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably &#x201C;Mr. Johnstone the teacher or Editor&#x201D; who, by <date when="1846-05-00">May 1846</date>, had gone to Leghorn to teach in a Free Church school (MS: NLS 1775A.325).</note> deserves thanks too for his good sense in that matter.</p>
<p>I got your Letter on Middlebie Brae yesterday morning; we have a Post now that brings our Letters on, daily at 10 o&#x2019;clock, to Backburn. I took a very long walk in the bright beautiful morning with your news in my <pb id="pg-20-15" n="20:15"/>pocket; met our Mother and Jamie bound to the Preaching, and gave them notice of you,&#x2014;for my route lay (after Middlebie) by the Rig, by Langtether, and the silent moors far and wide.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Places NW of Scotsbrig.</note> This day I have sat some 5 hours correcting an <hi rend="italic">Index;</hi> the <hi rend="italic">last</hi> botheration I am to have with that Book of mine: I could have written more at large but for that long detention within doors: daylight is now very nearly gone.</p>
<p>As for health I am certainly no worse since I came to the country; possibly a little better; but it would take a long spell of country to make any impression on so tough a subject. Our Mother too is fully as well as when you saw her,&#x2014;has been busy all day assisting Jenny to wash: we all do very tolerably well except when the rain grows excessive; then it flattens our spirits a little! During the last Sixty-Hours bout, which sent the sheaves floating past your windows, we were very ill off here too. But the last two days have been bright as diamonds, two of the beautifullest days of the year; to expect a third, I doubt, would be rather too much!&#x2014; My Mother daily praises the <hi rend="italic">Toaster;</hi> laments, however, that you had to send your own away to us, and still worse that you&#x2019;re &#x201C;no paid yet,&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;neither for it nor for the <hi rend="italic">paper!</hi>&#x201D;</p>
<p>Jack is gone into his old <hi rend="italic">Lodgings</hi> at Chelsea; continues to intimate, however, that he will be down in this part, &#x201C;later in the Season&#x201D;; <date when="1845-11-00">November</date>, I suppose.&#x2014; As for me I at one time thought of being off this week; then the beautiful bright weather struck out;&#x2014;and if that were to continue! It is a real truth, I was not far from taking my umbrella, and bundling off to Dumfries this day on foot. But the Proofsheet came; then the Cattle-shew suggested itself.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi>, <date when="1845-10-06">6 Oct.</date>, announced active preparations in Dumfries for the annual meeting of the Royal Highland and Agricultural Soc., beginning with a public breakfast and ball, Tues., <date when="1845-10-07">7 Oct.</date></note>&#x2014; Good night, dear Jean. I will not yet say Farewell: if the weather hold up, it is almost certain I shall see you again.

<p>Meanwhile I am going to dine with Elizabeth Pepoli&#x2014;she met Darwin here yesterday and asked him to fetch me; and, tho&#x2019; I made great eyes at him, he answered &#x201C;with all the pleasure in life&#x201D;!&#x2014;and so for want of moral courage to say <hi rend="italic">no</hi> on my own basis, I am in for a stupid evening and Italian cookery&#x2014;but I shall take some sewing with me, and stipulate to <supplied>[be]</supplied> brought away early.

<p><salute>Dearest,&#x2014;</salute>Perhaps you will be anxious if I do not write a word this night; you shall have a little bulletin, therefore,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; otherwise there is almost <hi rend="italic">less</hi> than nothing to be said. For in truth I am not very well,&#x2014;which means first of all, that I am dreadfully lazy, indisposed for any exertion but that of breathing: nay, at any time here, could I persuade <hi rend="italic">you</hi> to go to on without needing a reply, I think I should have little temptation to write. <hi rend="italic">Idleness;</hi> &#x201C;bone-idle,&#x201D; to the uttermost extent of the word, that is the definition of my life in these regions; which is in itself somewhat disgraceful, and naturally produces an indisposition to talk about it. I go strolling out every morning; wind round generally till I intercept the Post; if I find a Letter from you in his pocket, it is the event of the day: I return home with it glad; get into the easiest combination of chairs, with some silly Book in my hand, or without any Book, except my own foolish faculties of Memory and Anticipation; and so, with a few dawdlings out and in, to the hilltop or further, pensively pass the day. Tomorrow I hope to be brisker; tonight, not having yet had walking enough I propose to go to Ecclefechan with this: walkings under cloud of night being still much to my taste. Our <pb id="pg-20-18" n="20:18"/>weather yet continues dry; all the world has a certain mournful beauty, and sings strange unrhymed stanzas to me as I rove about in it.&#x2014; I thank you for reminding me that I must write to Mrs Russel; I will certainly do it tomorrow, if all go right.</p>
<p>The Printers sent me my <hi rend="italic">Index;</hi> another day had to be spent on that; it is now all fairly finished, and I hope never to hear of it more. Probably tomorrow the Title-page with the other adjuncts will arrive: then I shall bid good-b&#x2019;ye to the whole business,&#x2014;heartily sick of it, as I ever was of any. What next? We shall see by and by. My appetite for writing is considerably modified: but I have no other trade;&#x2014;Why should I wish any other? I will stick by my trade; and say a thing or two yet, if I live!</p>

I admire his catholicity of humour too: &#x201C;would prefer a <hi rend="italic">lady</hi>, but&#x201D; &#x26;c! I rather prophecy he will never even get a servant maid.&#x2014; By the bye, was it not I that first spoke of that Pension, and set it afloat in the world! In that case, it may be defined as our <foreign><hi rend="italic">ukase</hi></foreign> not less than Peel&#x2019;s. This world is a most singular place!&#x2014; Thank you also for settling that Christie question so neatly. We are a spirited woman, of very democratic tendencies, and cannot much stand being patronised out of a mere wooden-spring gig! The Christie fraternity male or female&#x2014;<foreign><hi rend="italic">ach Gott</hi></foreign> if one did incline for Patronage, it would need to be by <foreign><hi rend="italic">bonnier</hi></foreign> people, as Jamie says! Leave them to rest on their own basis.&#x2014; For the rest, keep out of Helpdom, O Goody! One&#x2019;s constitution never changes in that particular; ah no! I went one night to Tea with poor Helps; and have the liveliest remembrance of the adventure yet.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>Did you ever hear of Jane Johnston,&#x2014; or of Mr Johnston her Father, the drunken Surgeon at Moffat who used to beat his Wife (a Carlyle of the Satter),<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Carlyles of Satter (Satur), ca. 1 mi. S of Scotsbrig, are unidentified. Johnston of Moffat, not further identified, but possibly the same as &#x201C;old Johnston of Ha&#x2019;bank&#x201D; who &#x201C;ended his brutal career upon the floor of an alehouse&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-01/lt-18181217-TC-MAC-01"><sic>1:154</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1818-12-17">17 Dec. 1818</date></corr></ref>). There was also Dr. David Johnston, of Hawbank, Satur, then of Banks Hill, who likewise drank (see <ref target="volume-03/lt-18240625-TC-AC-01"><sic>3:95</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1824-06-25">25 June 1824</date></corr></ref>) and was probably a relative rather than Jane&#x2019;s father.</note> and forced her at last to leave him, with this one child; who was at School with me forty years ago and more. I daresay you know whom I mean. She became the Beauty of Annan; really a clever girl I believe: she went to see an Aunt in France, who had married some <hi rend="italic">Titular-Herr</hi> of that country, and gone over with him at the Peace: Jane married there too, and retired to the South of France with her Husband, as I think you already know too. Well; some time ago there came news hither of this tragic tenor: Husband and Jane went out to drive by some mountain path one evening; <pb id="pg-20-19" n="20:19"/>the horse took fright, or misbehaved; all was overset; Jane alighted on the road or caught by bushes; husband and gig went down into the chasm: Jane on clambering down found him laying stone-dead; had to watch there all night to guard his body from wolves!&#x2014; She has two children; she is older a little than I. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Sunt lachrymae rerum</hi></foreign> [There are tears for human affairs].<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Aeneid</hi> 1:462.</note></p>
<p>My <hi rend="italic">Friedrich der Grosse</hi> went done last night: I read it with many reflexions; mean to inquire yet farther about the man. <hi rend="italic"><foreign>Der Grosse</foreign> Fritz</hi> [The Great Fritz]:<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Frederick II, known as Frederick the Great (<date when="1712-00-00">1712</date>&#x2013;<date when="1786-00-00">86</date>), king of Prussia, <date when="1740-00-00">1740</date>&#x2013;<date when="1786-00-00">86</date>.</note> if I had any turn for travelling I should hold it very interesting indeed to go to Berlin, and try to make more acquaintance with him and his people. They are both of them very strange. Alas, what is the meaning of this that they call Literature? &#x201C;German Literature&#x201D; should have contrived to give us some melodious image of this greatest German Man, living in very difficult circumstances, next door neighbour to it! German Literature too is but a smallish matter in comparison.&#x2014;</p>
<p>Not a word tonight about my home-coming. This is not a night for taking resolutions: all I can say is, The time is now nigh. Total Idleness does not answer me long. <hi rend="italic">Mud</hi> super-added would almost instantly send me off. For the rest I really am getting a little better in health,&#x2014;really but very slowly. You would smile to see my <hi rend="italic">diet:</hi> two light-boiled eggs with a cup of curds and cream, I have dined twice upon that.&#x2014; &#x2014; Jamie advances rapidly in shearing.

<p><salute>Dear Goodykin,</salute> you shall have more money and no mistake; the thriftiest Goody cannot do without money! Neither let the Dog and its howlings distress you at all: hang the Dog, we will live in spite of it,&#x2014;or even if it bark and torment us, and send us sheer away out of London into some friendlier Country retirement, who knows if it will not turn out to be a blessing? Be content; I am coming back directly. Next Wednesday I sail by the Victoria,&#x2014;will try if I can visit Pauletdom; but you shall hear more precisely before that time. What is important at present, is to bid you write <pb id="pg-20-20" n="20:20"/><hi rend="italic">on Sunday</hi>, and give it to Jack in the evening to put into the <hi rend="italic">Sloane Street</hi> or some other Town Post-Office. Left there any time before Monday morning (about 8, I think), it will find me here on the Scotsbrig frontiers precisely about 10 on Tuesday morning. Do not neglect this. Whitherward to write next, you shall hear in good time. To Pauletdom? I really do not know. The Steamer hour (11 a. m from Annan) is the best; and means about 9 p. m. that same night; but nobody can appoint accurately the hour of such a Steamer;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >To arrive in Liverpool. According to the <hi rend="italic">Dumfries Courier</hi>, the &#x201C;elegant and powerful steamship&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Royal Victoria</hi> left Annan Waterfoot, 11 <hi rend="small-caps">a.m.</hi>, <date when="1845-10-15">15 Oct.</date>, evidently arriving in Liverpool at 9 <hi rend="small-caps">p.m.</hi></note> and in fact if the Paulets do not very authentically want me (which may be much doubted), I for my own share had rather hold on without turning aside. I will consider better of it.</p>
<p>Today I am just off for Dumfries again; round by Gill home again tomorrow. My farewell visit; it is principally calculated for my Mother,&#x2014; my own wish would rather be to sit still by the sunny side of some whinstone boulder, and do nothing but dream. We have, since that fit of sixty hours, the beautifullest weather I have seen any where for some years: bright, transparent, silent; the Country people all carrying their <foreign>locks</foreign> [bundles] of corn, the sound of them alone breaking the stilness of the world. The trees are getting red at the ends of the leaves;&#x2014;and Time, that never sleeps, is rushing on. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Allah akbar</hi></foreign> [God is great]!</p>
<p>I have written to Mrs Russel, will send funds when I have seen you. Yesterday I <hi rend="italic">saw</hi> my Titlepage again; but it and the beggarly <hi rend="italic">Table of Contents</hi> still hang unfinished. It is possible you may hear of them on Tuesday still at Chelsea: but that <hi rend="italic">is</hi> the last,&#x2014;my malison on them!</p>

<p>I wish Dear you had got the letter which was lying at the point of my pen <pb id="pg-20-21" n="20:21"/>for you last evening, when M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Browning came and sent it all to &#x201C;the Back of Beyond.&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. &#x201C;whirl&#x2019;s them to the back o&#x2019; beyont&#x201D; (Scott, <hi rend="italic">The Antiquary</hi> ch. 2).</note> <hi rend="italic">This</hi> evening I am too tired &#x201C;for anything&#x201D;&#x2014;and no shame to me; for I had to choose betwixt a walk of something like eight miles and a <hi rend="italic">cold</hi>, and of course like a prudent woman I prefered the evil which I was likely to be soonest rid of&#x2014; I had streamed off, as soon as the post had brought your letter to a place called Meard Court, off Wardour Street, in quest of one John Jones!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In Soho, occupied by antique and pseudo-antique furniture dealers. John Jones, mattress maker, 13 Meard&#x2019;s Ct., 56 Wardour St.</note> a humble individual much wanted here at present to finish off those confounded matrasses, the <hi rend="italic">wool</hi> of which has been finally <hi rend="italic">got dried</hi>, under the anger of Heaven, and will be finally <hi rend="italic">teazed</hi> by the time John Jones comes to act upon it; my programme had been to walk all the way there and ride from Coventry Street back&#x2014;but by the time I got back to Coventry Street the rain had made a mess of it, and my thin boots were soaked quite thro, and I knew that if I <hi rend="italic">sat</hi> with wet feet I should infallibly catch a cold&#x2014;whereas if I continued <hi rend="italic">walking</hi> with them I should probably get off with the fatigue&#x2014;and so I walked resolutely home&#x2014;only before I could get up stairs I had to transact a sort of little <hi rend="italic">swoon</hi> on one of the lobby chairs and drink &#x201C;a goblet&#x201D; of&#x2014;water! I have had both dinner and tea since, but feel still in a very pounded condition, so &#x201C;you must just excuse us the day&#x201D; The dinner at the Pepolis &#x201C;went off <hi rend="italic">with</hi> effect.&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Elizabeth and her husband, Count Carlo Pepoli (<date when="1796-00-00">1796</date>&#x2013;<date when="1881-00-00">1881</date>), Italian exile; see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350800-JWC-JCA-01"><sic>8:194</sic><corr>JWC to JCA, <date when="1835-08-13">13 Aug. 1835</date></corr></ref><sic>&#x2013;95</sic>.</note> well cooked, well served, and well eaten. it was really a little &#x201C;work of art&#x201D; the whole thing&#x2014;no incongruities, no <hi rend="italic">ver</hi>failed<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Ver-&#x201D; is a German intensive.</note> attempts&#x2014;never did a new house bring a more marked blessing with it.

I do not pretend to get much &#x201C;good joy&#x201D; from witnessing &#x201C;the happiness of <hi rend="italic">others</hi>&#x201D;; but it was really a sort of a pleasure for me to see the light and order which Elizabeth has managed to bring out of the chaos given her to rule, and to hear her innocent genuine thankfulness for her small mercies! Darwin remarked as we drove home that &#x201C;things seemed to be going on there <hi rend="italic">very nicely indeed!</hi>&#x2014;a little too much disparity in the ages still&#x2014;but as Pepoli was growing regularly older and <hi rend="italic">Madame</hi> younger, even <hi rend="italic">that</hi> would come right too at last&#x201D;! I have made no other visit not even to old Sterling&#x2014;he came today while I was out&#x2014;but as he forgets that he has seen me, so soon as I am out of his sight; it did not matter. Last Sunday I walked up to see him and sat with him half an hour, and before I was well home again, I received a visit from him here&#x2014; &#x201C;anxious to know how I had been.&#x201D;</p>
<p><pb id="pg-20-22" n="20:22"/>Miss Leslie the Governess whom M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Sterling used to be so kind to&#x2014; daughter of an old military friend of Sterlings own&#x2014;goes about him a great deal and would have been a very likely person to take the principle charge of him, were there reason or humanity enough among them to make this practicable for a woman earning her bread. But when she wrote to Anthony offering to give up her teaching for this object provided only that he would pay her house rent&#x2014;the answer was, that &#x201C;Captain Sterling entirely declined interfering in his Fathers concerns in any manner whatever&#x2014;&#x201D; Short and <hi rend="italic">not</hi> sweet!&#x2014;</p>
<p>The only News afloat is the marriage of my old acquaintance Ubiquity-Young.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably Thomas Young, No. 3 I The Albany.</note> He has married actually&#x2014;at sixty&#x2014;but not wholly without excuse to his own mind at least&#x2014; He wrote to Miss Allan<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Frances (Fanny) Allen (<date when="1781-00-00">1781</date>&#x2013;<date when="1875-00-00">1875</date>), Frances Wedgwood&#x2019;s aunt.</note> (M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Wedgwood&#x2019;s Aunt) that, &#x201C;as he was now growing old he had felt very lonely on returning to the Albany at nights, and the Lady he had married was immensely rich&#x201D;! Another little bit of quite obscure news I heard from Elizabeth. She was in a carriage with her Cousin old M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Rhoid<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably a cousin of Elizabeth Pepoli&#x2019;s sister Jane Royd&#x2019;s husband.</note> the other day, when he showed her a man walking along, who he said was once the reigning Dandy of London, &#x201C;he had seen that man following the hounds in silk stockings and pumps and always taking the lead of the whole hunt nevertheless&#x201D; Elizabeth asked his name&#x2014; &#x201C;James Baillie&#x201D;!&#x2014; &#x201C;He has been sadly reduced since then&#x201D; said M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Rhoid, &#x201C;but I am told he is now getting up in the world again by speculating <hi rend="italic">in railway shares!</hi>&#x201D;&#x2014; Dont you remember my predicting <hi rend="italic">that</hi> course of industry for him?

<p><pb id="pg-20-23" n="20:23"/>Here has just been John Mill&#x2014;but hearing you were not at home he would not come in&#x2014;&#x201C;would call again&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>
<p>&#x201C;<hi rend="italic">If</hi> I promised to spend <hi rend="italic">the</hi> whole winter with Lady Harriet&#x201D;! Bah!

<p>I had a very nice letter from Harriet Martineau the other day but I will not send it to you for either you would not read it, or you would call it&#x2014; what shall I say&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">twaddle!</hi> if you did read it. But on the whole the great event of my life in these latter times has been the entire and signal failure of my moon-and-star enterprise.

<p><salute>My Dear,</salute> I arrived last night from the Dumfries Expedition; a weary and a sad one, consisting mostly of Farewells. My Sisters both <hi rend="italic">wept</hi> when I came away; there sit they, fighting along in their obscure department, amid clouds of children and confused elements of destiny; I have to go else-whither and fight otherwise. I did not weep; but there is a stony sadness which I think is much sadder than tears. Thou hast to be <hi rend="italic">here</hi>, I have to be <hi rend="italic">there;</hi> seest thou not, it is appointed us <hi rend="italic">to part!</hi> My Mother and I got home after nightfall, safe and without rain. Country balls were at Dumfries; an immense cattle-shew just concluding itself, horse-races concluding: I had gone to nobody, except two minutes to Adamson&#x2019;s Bank; spoken to nobody except for half an hour, not very profitably, to poor lazy Aird. Our diamond weather is broken here into mud showers again; today windless, rainless, but very damp, all hands gone to Church,&#x2014;we wait tomorrow for our fate as to rain. Jamie is well on with his crop, and has seven ricks built.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-20-25" n="20:25"/>I have settled to depart by Wednesday&#x2019;s Steamer; I hoped never to have gone into that thing again; but find it now the bad best for me. Carlisle and its Waiters with their mountains of hat-cases; and the tumbling over Shap in the dark cold,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The difficult route from Carlisle to Lancaster (terminus since <date when="1840-00-00">1840</date> of the railway from London) lay over Shap, a hill pass (914 ft.). It meant leaving Shap at 5 <hi rend="small-caps">p.m.</hi> and arriving Preston, 2 <hi rend="small-caps">a.m.</hi> The railway from Carlisle to Lancaster was to open <date when="1846-12-00">Dec. 1846</date>.</note> and out of one unhappy vehicle into another: it is better to go to the Whale again, and say &#x201C;Swallow me at once, <hi rend="italic">thou</hi> dost it at once!&#x201D;&#x2014; We sail about Noon on Wednesday next; 11 o&#x2019;clock is the advertised hour: likely to arrive in Liverpool about nine or ten that night. I have written to Mrs Paulet <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to send a vehicle for me, the hour being very uncertain;&#x2014;yet I do not know but she will do it; in fact, I shall be ready either way. I mean to see the Lady next day at any rate. <hi rend="italic">Heartiness</hi> like that of Pauletdom is worth something in this world; and &#x201C;Betsy&#x201D; herself must be admitted to be a luminous object,&#x2014;luminous, harmonious, like a bit of rainbow in such skies as ours.&#x2014; What becomes of me after Thursday I will in due course predict, if needful.</p>
<p>No Letter today or yesterday from thee. One cannot expect a Letter every day; I hardly hoped today, and sent a messenger only, who came with &#x201C;nothink.&#x201D; Tomorrow there will be one? Tomorrow and next day I must be busy packing, adjusting: &#x201C;tremendous energy&#x201D; as Fuz would call it, will be needed! Courage!</p>
<p>Today if I mean to catch Monday Night and Goody at tea, the Post hour is as good as <hi rend="italic">here</hi>. Wherefore, my blessing dear Jeannie, and not a word more. Last night as we passed &#x201C;the Hill,&#x201D; my Mother said, &#x201C;There, it was coming up by that hedge that I first saw thy Jane, that morning long since!&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-03/lt-18250902-JBW-TC-01"><sic>3:375</sic><corr>JBW to TC, <date when="1825-09-02">2 Sept. 1825</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-03/lt-18250902-JBW-TC-01"><sic>378</sic><corr>JBW to TC, <date when="1825-09-02">2 Sept. 1825</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014;a fact which brought whole Histories into my head again. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign> dear little <foreign>Bairn</foreign>; I will never forget thee, I think; I for one!</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>Dearest,</salute> one word more before I wrap up my Papers, and take flight from these regions. My purpose holds for the Steamer or Whale&#x2019;s Belly of tomorrow; when you read this, I hope to be in Liverpool. I might have had a Letter from you waiting me there: but I forgot that circumstance of time yesterday; and today it is too late. A mistake occurred, too, about the last Letter to you: you did <hi rend="italic">not</hi> get it on Monday to tea; not till Tuesday after breakfast. The Waterbeck Merchants, it appears, had signified to the Post that he need not come this way on Sundays <hi rend="italic">collecting</hi> Letters; on my return home from my walk, the message waited me that the Letters were <hi rend="italic">not</hi> off, and the hour of the Mail was now past! But for that, I might have had some Answer from Mrs Paulet this morning: I got your <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> Newspaper, but nothing more. On Sunday night, however, our Express Messenger (who had gone over with the disappointed Packet) brought me over your Letter of Friday: thanks for it. Tomorrow morning before we set out, I will catch what Letters there may be: probably you may have written me one on Monday; if so, that will be the last. My next news from Goody will be by her lips, I hope.</p>
<p>The weather is good; has again become bright: if tomorrow be as this day, we may hope to get comfortably across the mud frith; and if the Paulets are in waiting, I will cheerfully go with them. If they are not, I will cheerfully go to an Inn. On the morrow (which will be Thursday) I mean to see them at any rate: I think I can hardly be home before Friday at soonest. But I will try to write to you, when there is an opportunity of Post: on Friday you may expect to hear of me, or else to see me. But in fact, do not <hi rend="italic">expect</hi> anything: sit quite quiet, and be piously confident I will walk in,&#x2014; right glad to get back again.&#x2014; &#x2014; I have done another magnanimous thing since you heard last of me: Written to the Stanleys (who live somewhere on the edge of the railway) that if they will very pressingly invite me, and <hi rend="italic">if</hi> some other circumstances answer, I will turn aside and pass 24 hours with <pb id="pg-20-28" n="20:28"/>them!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edward John Stanley (<date when="1802-00-00">1802</date>&#x2013;<date when="1869-00-00">69</date>; <ref target="volume-20/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/26267"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), whig statesman, m. to Henrietta Maria, b.

TC meant to call on them at Alderley Park, 14 mi. S of Manchester.</note> Was not that great? I believe they were seriously angry with me that I never called for them last year; this will be a kind of propitiation. Besides I should like to put on my black clothes <hi rend="italic">once</hi> in this long Tour of many weeks, and not have taken them for nothing! The chances of my actually <hi rend="italic">going</hi> are in any case, I think, not very great. For it lies all loose, and can still be either way. Friday will tell you about it.&#x2014; &#x2014; &#x2014; My packing is over; quite a small matter. I have also taken leave of Grahame, who was <hi rend="italic">here</hi>.

<p>You got the Note <hi rend="italic">addressed</hi> by me, and written by Jamie, to say that I was actually off by the Carlisle Coach? My adventures since that have been altogether prosperous: but the Steamer itself was a wonderful business! First, the good Mrs Paulet, in spite of my prohibition did send the carriage: carriage waited till past midnight, no Steamer came; the Steamer did not arrive till Noon next day (yesterday), and the carriage was again there, to no purpose! They do not seem to care for all that botheration, the kind souls. As for myself I am right glad I chanced to escape that detestable Cattle Ship: four-and-twenty hours there would have almost driven me mad.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning I found myself in the little bedroom of the Inn at Lancaster,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >46 mi. N of Liverpool.</note> where at 2 o&#x2019;clock last I had thrown myself down very weary; there being <hi rend="italic">no</hi> train on to Liverpool till the morrow. I had then the choice either to come round hither, according to partial bargain, or to go dashing direct home. I hope you duly appreciate my magnanimity in deciding for <pb id="pg-20-29" n="20:29"/>the call of <hi rend="italic">duty</hi>. At half past 4 o&#x2019;clock here, after a pleasant journey, I found a most Cordial Welcome. The<supplied>[re]</supplied><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letters omitted.</note> lay also a very kind Letter from Mrs Stanley; but, as you will see, it contained room for an excuse: so I write today, after studying the railway and myself, &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">I answer, <foreign>ce n&#x2019;est pas possible</foreign></hi> [it is not possible].&#x201D; Alderley is not <hi rend="italic">her</hi> house, it seems, so I <hi rend="italic">ought</hi> not to go, even if I liked, till asked by the real Mistress.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >H.

<p>Whether your Uncle is in Town yet I have not learned; but shall in an hour; Mrs Paulet is going to take me, in spite of the wind. Poor Paulet is almost totally blind! They seem to be both coming up to London, to have an operation tried, next week.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Julia Paulet had mentioned, [<date when="1845-09-25">25 Sept.</date>], that her father&#x2019;s &#x201C;good eye&#x201D; was weak, &#x201C;having all the work of both to do.&#x201D;</note> It is very grievous for poor Paulet; puts the House itself into kind of eclipsed state. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, Dearest.

<p><salute>Alas, dear Mrs Stanley,</salute> I have to be <hi rend="italic">home</hi> tomorrow night; I could have come to you today, tho&#x2019; I have been much detained by foul weather, lazy Steamers, and other accidents: but now it will not do; I must give up the beautiful adventure till a better season, which we hope will not always refuse to shew itself. I pray you be sensible of my regrets; let all parties interested be so: what can be easily understood need not be written down in words on so hurried an occasion as this.</p>
<p>You say you have a &#x201C;favour&#x201D; to ask of me which will require all the music of your voice, and cannot be put into black-on-white lest it be refused! Pray make the trial! I know not what favour, that lay within the compass of one&#x2019;s activity, a rational philosopher could refuse to the like of you, whether asked in writing or in speech. Try!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Yesterday at Wigan I saw the little melancholy physiognomy of Ewart, about getting into the carriage where I was, tho&#x2019; on second thoughts he decided otherwise, and better;&#x2014; an Election or some Political matter, I <pb id="pg-20-30" n="20:30"/>understood, was going on there: but no Mr Stanley anywhere turned up for me.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Hon.

<p><salute><hi rend="small-caps">My dear Mother</hi>,&#x2014;</salute>I hope you have, this morning, got the little Note I pushed into the Post Office for you at Lancaster, and consoled yourself with the assurance that all the difficult part of my journey was well over. I am quite safe, and in good quarters here, since yesterday afternoon; and will now write you another word with a little more deliberation than yesterday. My journey hither was altogether really pleasant: a fine bright day, and a swift smooth carriage to sit in, nothing wanted that one could wish on such an occasion. I got along to this house about half past four, when dinner was ready and a welcome as if it had been home,&#x2014;real joy to me. It has all gone much better than I could have expected since I quitted Kirtlebrig<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ca. 2 mi. SSE of Scotsbrig, where the Hannings used to live; see <ref target="volume-11/lt-18391123-TC-JCA-01"><sic>11:214</sic><corr>TC to JCA, <date when="1839-11-23">23 Nov. 1839</date></corr></ref>.</note> and Jamie, that night.</p>
<p>I find the good people here <hi rend="italic">did</hi> send their carriage for the Steamer; and a very wild adventure that was, and much better that <hi rend="italic">I</hi> had but little to do with it, and could plead that I had forbidden them to do such a thing! The Paulet carriage went duly to the Clearance Dock, after inquiring at the Steamer Office too, and waited for the Royal Victoria from half past 8 on Wednesday night till past 12, when the Docks <hi rend="italic">close;</hi> but no Royal Victoria came! She did not make her appearance till noon <hi rend="italic">yesterday</hi>, owing to fog or wind, or what cause I have not yet heard,&#x2014;not till twelve o&#x2019;clock yesterday; when the Paulet carriage was again in attendance: but of course there was no guest there; the guest was advancing by another much less uncomfortable route! On the whole it was a good luck I did not get into that greasy Whale&#x2019;s Belly (as I call it); twenty-four hours there would have reduced me to a precious pickle!</p>
<p>Our journey to Lancaster as I told you was decidedly prosperous, almost <pb id="pg-20-31" n="20:31"/>pleasant thro&#x2019; the moonlight country, with plenty tobacco to smoke! The wild solitude of Shap Fell<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The hill above Shap pass; see <ref target="volume-20/lt-18451012-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1845-10-12">12 Oct.</date></ref></note> at midnight is a thing I really like to have seen. And then the railway yesterday was all the welcomer, and the daylight. At Carlisle I got myself a pound of tobacco from Irving,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Irving, 61 English St., Carlisle.</note> so do not fret your heart, dear Mother, about that! I also took out my old dressing-gown there and wrapt it well round my legs, which was useful. A small proportion of corn, you may tell Jamie, was still in the fields here and there all the way; but to-day and last night there is a rustling <foreign><hi rend="italic">thuddening</hi></foreign><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably a misreading of Scottish &#x201C;<foreign>thuddering</foreign>&#x201D; (gusting).</note> North wind which must have dried it.</p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>The two Notes I sent you on the journey hither have, I hope, arrived; and prepared you for this, which is to announce that I got safe home last night (Saturday night); all safe, tho&#x2019; about an hour later than was anticipated at starting. The train was very large and heavy; that was the thing that retarded us: we left Liverpool at eleven, and I did not reach Chelsea till half past ten. Jane was waiting for me; and had tea and all accommodations ready; and the house all bright as a new pin, for she has been very creditably improving it in my absence.&#x2014; She thanks you very kindly for your gifts; likes the stockings and the little napkin very much, and is really pleased with that mark of your attention to her.</p>
<p>Jack had been here last night, but had tired of waiting for me. He did not come this morning; and was gone out when I went to him: however he did come to tea,&#x2014;all well,&#x2014;and is now sitting smoking down in the kitchen where I have left him: that is the reason why I have to write with more brevity than I intended. The needful is, That we are all well, and safe here once more, with all these many miles of journeying now behind us. My own mood, as you may fancy, is still a little confused; but I have got some sleep, got a complete <hi rend="italic">washing</hi> of myself effected; must set about winding up a number of little matters I find here; and shall soon get into my old track again. My visit to Annandale has been <hi rend="italic">full</hi> of interest to me,&#x2014;and could not but be, while I have you there, my dear good Mother. Let me be thankful for all the good things a gracious Giver is still providing for me in <pb id="pg-20-32" n="20:32"/>this changeful world, where there <hi rend="italic">is</hi> no joy without its corresponding sorrow!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Jack is evidently very well in health; he has set vigorously to working <hi rend="italic">at Dante</hi> again, and seems much agog about that for the present. He still talks about Annandale, and I rather think will come to you in not many weeks; but I cannot get a positive answer, Yes or No, tonight: he will himself write to you by and by. You got Alick&#x2019;s new Letter, I hope? I have not yet seen it.&#x2014; You will get the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> on the <hi rend="italic">Wednesday</hi> morning this time; in future weeks, it will be regularly at the Backburn, I hope, on the <hi rend="italic">Tuesdays</hi>. Jamie&#x2019;s Letter to Jane came punctually. Thank them all for me, the good kind souls; thank Jenny and every one. <closer><salute>I pray for all blessings on you, and so say Good Night.</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Lady Ashburton,</salute>
<p>Your Note lies waiting for me here; you are always very kind. I only returned on Saturday Night late; much broken down by the vicissitudes of travel, and swift succession of things good and evil; and sit ever since in that black ruined humour which the public is acquainted with on such occasions. Humour comparable to universal London Fog; black weather, prefiguring no lightnings, no rainbows, nothing but soupy streets, and universal mud and drizzle, for a time and times and half a time!&#x2014;</p>
<p>The Grange, I think, has temptation enough for me altogether independent of M. Thiers:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Louis Adolphe Thiers (<date when="1797-00-00">1797</date>&#x2013;<date when="1877-00-00">1877</date>), French politician and historian; see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18330112-TC-JSM-01"><sic>6:302&#x2013;3</sic><corr>TC to JSM, <date when="1833-01-12">12 Jan. 1833</date></corr></ref>.

Such is its general habit. Under the circumstances what can I say?</p>
<p>If the Grange (which has very original tastes now and then) will actually have my Wife and me, for three days, any time between this and a <pb id="pg-20-33" n="20:33"/>fortnight hence,&#x2014;then let the Lady of the Grange choose her own time, and appoint, and it shall be so. But would any one who knew the market bargain for a cargo of London Fog when it could be avoided?&#x2014;</p>
<p>Another stipulation is, the Lady Harriet must drive me, on those two tremendous little animals, to see that &#x201C;unknown water&#x201D; again, and the &#x201C;chapel&#x201D; recently erected there.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-18/lt-18440912-TC-JWC-01"><sic>18:201</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1844-09-12">12 Sept. 1844</date></corr></ref>.</note> A word of thanksgiving for our and the Pony-chaise&#x2019;s preservation from destruction there, would well beseem her and me.</p>

<salute>Dear Mrs Rich,</salute>
<p>Certainly it is a very lamentable piece of mismanagement this that has befallen M<hi rend="italic">lle</hi> Daulion in the matter of the Cromwell sheets: the most insignificant subaltern part of the business failing, the whole has failed;&#x2014; like the death of a General and loss of the campaign caused by the neglect of a horse-shoe nail!</p>
<p>However, what I have now to say is that M<hi rend="italic">lle</hi> Daulion is to <hi rend="italic">keep</hi> those sheets and do with them whatsoever she will; that the Book is to be out here about the 15<hi rend="italic">th</hi> of next month; and that I cannot enter into any negociation with M.

<p>Will you dear Mrs Rich be so kind as manage this for me; and then <hi rend="italic">we</hi>, at least, shall be out of the affair. I have lost my English middle-man&#x2019;s Address, and so must trouble you to that length.</p>
<p>Darwin and Mrs Wedgwood were here yesterday; both well, all well; but I unluckily was out. I only came from Scotland two days ago; and have much confusion lying here, and many petty things to do,&#x2014;and am in very great haste at present; with a very bad pen too!</p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>You have again, as you are on all occasions doing, deserved many thanks from me. The German Books, all right and fit according to the requisition, were announced to me as safe arrived, three weeks ago, while I was in Scotland on a visit to my native place there. They were sent straight to the fair hands to whom they now belonged;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lady Harriet Baring.</note> and due thanks, the real ownership of which was <hi rend="italic">yours</hi>, were paid me by return of Post. The <hi rend="italic">Friedrich der Grosse,</hi> I find, was perfectly correct; not less so, I will hope, the <hi rend="italic">Geist der Kochkunst</hi> [Essentials of the Art of Cooking]!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-19/lt-18450819-TC-KAVE-01">TC to KAVE, <date when="1845-08-19">19 Aug.</date></ref></note> In fact you have very much obliged me by your goodness in this matter; and now if the Bookseller will send his account, it will complete the favour; and this important little matter, more important than some greater ones, will be well and kindly finished.</p>
<p>A few days after I wrote last, there came to me, from Lewis, your Book on <hi rend="italic">Hans von Held</hi>.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Hans von Held, ein preussisches Karakterbild,</hi> 3 vols.

Hans von Held (<date when="1764-00-00">1764</date>&#x2013;<date when="1842-00-00">1842</date>), Prussian official who protested against the Prussian system of govt. during the early nineteenth cent.; associated with the <foreign><hi rend="italic">Sturm und Drang</hi></foreign> ambience of mystical aspiration which characterized Prussian life under Frederick William II (<date when="1744-00-00">1744</date>&#x2013;<date when="1897-00-00">97</date>). &#x201C;Lewis&#x201D; is G. H. Lewes.</note> Lewis had been unwell; had hoped always to bring the Book, and never till then decided on sending it. For this Book also I will very heartily thank you. It it like a Steel Engraving;&#x2014;has vividly printed on my mind the image of a Man and his Environment; and in its hard outlines, bound up by the rigours of History and Authenticity, one traces indications enough of internal harmony and rhythm. As in the Tirynthian Walls,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Walls of Tiryns, a prehistoric citadel in E Peloponnesus, S Greece. The uncovering of ruins of massive walls, etc., had given valuable information of pre-Homeric life in Greece.</note> built of dry stone, it is said you may trace the Architectural Tendencies that build a Parthenon and an Iliad, of other materials!&#x2014; I found much to think of in this <hi rend="italic">Life of Held:</hi> new curiosities awakened as to Prussian Life; new intimation that the soul of it as yet lay all dumb to us English, perhaps to the Prussians themselves. They begin to seem to me a great People: a kind <pb id="pg-20-35" n="20:35"/>of German-English, I sometimes call them; great <hi rend="italic">dumb</hi> Titans,&#x2014;like the <hi rend="italic">other</hi> Mecklenburgers that have come to this side of the Channel so long since!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Anglo-Saxon invaders of Britain from the Baltic coast of Germany.</note>&#x2014;</p>
<p>In my Scotch seclusion I read Preuss&#x2019;s two Books on <hi rend="italic">Friedrich,</hi> which you sent me a long time ago.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >As well as his five-vol. <hi rend="italic">Life</hi> (<ref target="volume-20/lt-18451113-TC-KAVE-01">TC to KAVE, <date when="1845-11-13">13 Nov.</date></ref>), Preuss wrote several books on Frederick, <date when="1837-00-00">1837</date>&#x2013;<date when="1840-00-00">40</date>. TC may mean his two-vol. <hi rend="italic">Die Lebensgeschichte</hi> (<date when="1837-00-00">1837</date>) (see <ref target="volume-19/lt-18450917-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1845-08-17">17 Aug.</date></ref> [<date when="1845-09-00">Sept.</date>]), or it and another unidentified. TC acknowledged Preuss&#x2019;s preeminence in his <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi>, speaking of him as being &#x201C;devoted wholly to the study of Friedrich for five-and-twenty years past&#x201D; and having written &#x201C;besides that <hi rend="italic">Lebensgeschichte</hi> just cited, three or four small Books, of indistinctly different titles, on the same subject.&#x201D; He was &#x201C;a meritoriously exact man; acquainted with the outer details of Friedrich&#x2019;s Biography &#x2026; as few men ever were or will be&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 12:32 4n).</note> The liveliest curiosity awoke in me to know more and ever more about that King. Certainly if there is a Hero for an Epic in these Ages,&#x2014;and why should there not in these ages as well as others,&#x2014;then this is he!&#x2014; But he remains still very dark to me; and Preuss, tho&#x2019; full of minute knowledge and seemingly very authentic, is not exactly my man for all purposes. In fact I could like to know much more about this King; and if of your own knowledge, or with Herr Preuss&#x2019;s help, you could at any time send me a few names of likely Books on the subject, they would not be lost upon me.</p>
<p>About the middle of next month, the <hi rend="italic">Cromwell,</hi> which is waiting for a Portrait, and also for the return of London Population from the Country, is to make its appearance; and your Copy shall have the earliest conveyance I can find. You will, of course, try to read it; and if you can get across the rind of it, will find somewhat to interest you. <closer><salute><foreign><hi rend="italic">Gl&#xfc;ck und Segen</hi></foreign> [Good luck and blessings] always!

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Will you accept of this Book<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The new edn. of <hi rend="italic">Past and Present</hi>. TC also inscribed a copy to JWC: &#x201C;To Jane Carlyle, with my blessing. T.C., Chelsea, <date when="1845-10-26">26 Oct. 1845</date>&#x201D; (offered for sale by Maggs Bros., catalogue no. 624 [<date when="1936-00-00">1936</date>], item 49).</note> from me, which probably you have already examined, but may put now on your shelves as a symbol of regards that will not be unwelcome to you.</p>
<p>For a good while past, especially in late weeks during a rustication in Scotland, I have read punctually your own part, or what I understand to be <pb id="pg-20-36" n="20:36"/>such, of the <hi rend="italic">Nation</hi> Newspaper; and always with a real sympathy and assent. There reigns in that small-type department a manfulness, veracity, good sense and dignity, which are worthy of all approbation. Of the much elsewhere that remains extraneous to me, and even afflictive to me, I will here say nothing. When one reflects how, in the History of this World, the noblest human efforts have had to take the most confused embodiments, and tend to a beneficent eternal goal by courses <hi rend="italic">they</hi> were much mistaken in,&#x2014;why should we not be patient even with Repeal! You I will, with little qualification, bid persevere and prosper; and wish all Ireland would listen to you more and more. The thing you intrinsically mean is what all good Irishmen, and all good men, must mean; let <hi rend="italic">it</hi> come quickly, and continue forever. Your coadjutors also shall persevere, under such conditions as they can; and grow clearer and clearer according to their faithfulness in these.</p>
<p>My Wife, while I was absent, received a little Book<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-19/lt-18450915-JWC-CGD-01">JWC to CGD, <date when="1845-09-14">14 Sept.</date> <date when="1845-09-15">[15 Sept.]</date></ref></note> from you, with much thankfulness; and answered with light words, she says, in profound ignorance of the great afflictions just then lying heavy on you, which had made such a tone very inappropriate!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;The calamity to which Carlyle alludes &#x2026; was among the heaviest of my life. My young wife and Thomas Davis, the friend I loved best on the earth, died within a week&#x201D; (Duffy 10). Duffy had married Emily, b. McLaughlin, in <date when="1842-00-00">1842</date>. Thomas Osborne Davis (<date when="1814-00-00">1814</date>&#x2013;<date when="1845-00-00">45</date>), Irish poet and politician; with Duffy a founder of the <hi rend="italic">Nation</hi> and of the Young Ireland party.</note> Forgiveness for this:&#x2014;you may believe always that there is a true sympathy with you here, a hearty goodwill for you here.</p>
<p>When you come to London again, fail not to let us see you. If I ever visit Ireland, yours is a House I will seek out.</p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>You will take a short word from me rather than none at all, to tell you that we are all struggling along here without disaster; which indeed is all that is to be told. I write also to see if I can induce you to make use of one of those Letter-Covers which I left, and to send me a small line about yourself and how you are. Except one short line from Jamie to the Doctor, I have heard nothing at all since I left you.</p>
<p>There has been no rain, or almost none whatever since I left Scotsbrig; so that, I hope, tho&#x2019; your weather can hardly have been so favourable, Jamie is now over with his harvest, and fast getting all secured under <foreign><hi rend="italic">thack-and-rape.</hi></foreign><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thatch and rope; cover for stacks against wind and rain.</note> The Potatoe-business, as I learn from the Newspapers, proves very serious everywhere, in Ireland as much as anywhere; and over all Europe there is a rather deficient crop; besides which the present distracted railway speculation and general fever of trade is nearly certain to break down soon into deep confusion: so that one may fear a bad winter for the poor; a sad thing to look forward to! They are best off, I think, who have least to do with that brutal chase for money; which afflicts me wherever I go in this country. &#x201C;Give me neither poverty nor riches, feed me with food convenient for me!&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Prov. 30:8.</note>&#x2014;</p>
<p>Our freedom from rain has not hindered the <date when="0000-11-00">November</date> Fogs from coming in, somewhat before their time. The weather is not wholesome; many people have got cold in these late days. I advise you dear Mother to put on your winter clothing, and be cautious of going out except when the Sun is shining. In the morning and evening do not venture at all. This is the most critical time of all, I believe; these weeks while the change to winter is just in progress. I thought myself extremely well here, for a week <pb id="pg-20-38" n="20:38"/>after my return; and indeed was so, and hope again to be so,&#x2014;much improved by my journey: but last Sabbath, paying no heed to these frost-fogs I caught a little tickling in my nose, which rapidly grew into a <foreign><hi rend="italic">sniftering</hi></foreign>, and by the time next day came I had a regular ugly <foreign><hi rend="italic">face-ache</hi></foreign>, and fair foundation for cold in all its forms; which required to be energetically dealt with, and resisted on the threshold. Next day accordingly I kept the house, strictly, and appealed to medicine and thin diet; and so on Wednesday morning I had got the victory again, and have been getting round, and growing nearer the old point ever since;&#x2014;in fact reckon myself quite well again, except that I take a little care of going out at night &#x26;c. Jane has had a little whiff of cold too; but it is abating again. We are taught by these visitations to be upon our guard.&#x2014; The Doctor is quite well, tho&#x2019; I think he sits too much in the house; being very eager upon his <hi rend="italic">Dante</hi> at present.</p>
<p>They are not to publish the <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> till &#x201C;the middle of next month, &#x201D;&#x2014; about a fort<supplied>[night]</supplied>.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >MS ends here; remainder from Copeland.</note></p>
<p>It lies perfectly ready, but the Town is still very empty; besides they are getting ready a Portrait, the <hi rend="italic">rudiments</hi> of which John and I went to see the other day, but did not very much like. I fear it will not turn out much of an ornament to the Book or a <hi rend="italic">true</hi> likeness of Oliver; but we cannot help that. Nor does it very much matter.&#x2014; For the rest, I am and have been nearly as <hi rend="italic">idle</hi> as possible; merely reading Books, and doing other small <foreign>etceteras</foreign>.</p>
<p>There is an invitation to go down to the Grange (where I was the other year), for Jane and me both, &#x201C;for a few days&#x201D; (perhaps three); but I think it is not certain whether we can accept in such a state of the weather, etc. It will be within the next ten days if at all. We are very quiet here at home; hardly anybody yet coming about us: and indeed in general it is, the fewer the better, with us.</p>
<p>I cannot yet learn with the least distinctness whether John is for Scotsbrig or not; but I continue to think he will after all come down and plant himself there with his <hi rend="italic">Dante</hi> for a while. I have fully expressed your wishes to him in regard to that; and certainly if he do not come it will not be for want of wish to be there.</p>
<p>Jenny, I suppose, is home again: all is grown quiet in the upstairs rooms! My dear good Mother, let us not be sad, let us rather be thankful,&#x2014;and still hope in the Bounty which has long been so benignant to us. I will long remember your goodness to me at Scotsbrig on this occasion, and the sadness that is in it I will take as inevitable,&#x2014;every joy has its sorrow here. &#x2026; <note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ellipsis in Copeland.</note></p>

<salute>Dearest Babbie</salute>
<p>The first of your two letters found me just set in for reaping Virtues Own Reward in the shape of a violent cold&#x2014;my virtue had been strenuous so the cold has been proportionately excruciating&#x2014;pain in my breast and sore throat, enough to frighten one to death (figuratively speaking) even independently of association of ideas which is always the most discouraging part of colds for me&#x2014;and independently also of the annoying consideration that I had fallen ill exactly at the wrong moment&#x2014;when I should have been girding up the nerves of my soul and my wardrobe to carry into effect that visit to the Grange&#x2014;but Destiny considers none of these things &#x201C;the least in the world&#x201D;&#x2014; I am better somewhat, and Carlyle has written to say that I shall be well and up to the enterprise in a few days&#x2014; Of course he knows&#x2014; so I have nothing to do but keep myself easy&#x2014;and warm&#x2014;till the few days are over&#x2014;the last week however has sadly abated my courage for eight-oclock dinners&#x2014;and dressings&#x2014;and sittings in state&#x2014; I look round on my snug little room here with a sigh&#x2014;and am not so grateful to Providence as might be expected for having opened to me the Golden gates of the Aristocratic Paradise&#x2014;such as it is!&#x2014; Another vexatious feature of the business is the uncertainty I am in about M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Paulet&#x2014;if she should arrive in London with her blind Husband, during my <hi rend="italic">absence</hi> it would be a real grief to me&#x2014;and at one time I had every reason to fear such a <foreign><hi rend="italic">contretemps</hi></foreign>&#x2014; but she writes to me that Alexander <note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henry Alexander (<date when="1783-00-00">1783</date>?&#x2013;<date when="1859-00-00">1859</date>), surgeon to the Eye Infirmary, 6 Cork St.; surgeon oculist to the queen, <date when="1838-00-00">1838</date>&#x2013;<date when="1859-00-00">59</date>; F.R.S., <date when="1847-00-00">1847</date>.</note> is going down to Liverpool to see another patient he has there, and M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Paulet will await his coming in the first instance&#x2014;perhaps he may even perform the operation <hi rend="italic">there</hi>&#x2014; So this news which would have been disappointing in other circumstances neutralizes the necessity of my going as soon as I am fit for it&#x2014;&#x201C;two afflictions put together making a consolation&#x201D;&#x2014;according to the adage&#x2014;</p>
<p>It seems to me I must have a volume of things to tell you by this time&#x2014; but my head is of the muddiest at present&#x2014;and I have no facilities for writing such as I used to have&#x2014;Carlyle sits always in the same room with me since he returned, with no work on-hand&#x2014;and you know I cannot write <pb id="pg-20-40" n="20:40"/>in the presence of a fellow creature&#x2014;especially one who is apt to say when I have finished a letter: &#x201C;now read it to me&#x201D;!

<p><salute>Dear Lady,&#x2014;</salute>We are much concerned for this sad affair of poor Lady Ashburton&#x2019;s illness; the more so as I think she is a little liable to that complaint; and it is one which, in its ulterior developments, is by no means to be trifled with. Certainly it will be very fit that all Guests depart as soon as possible, that there be complete composure in her neighbourhood. Sea air, Bay House; quietness itself, which is perhaps equal to all the rest; there should be no delay in your recourse to all these!&#x2014;</p>
<p>As for us we have fog daily and nightly; attended of late with poisonous damp-frost, and east-wind, seasoning our bad atmosphere with a taste of all the London chimnies, your friend Montefiore&#x2019;s<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly Sir Moses Haim Montefiore (<date when="1784-00-00">1784</date>&#x2013;<date when="1885-00-00">1885</date>; <ref target="volume-20/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/19042"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), Jewish philanthropist who did much to help Jews in various parts of the world; knighted, <date when="1837-00-00">1837</date>: created bart., <date when="1846-00-00">1846</date>. Or possibly Mrs. Henrietta Montefiore, 4 Gt. Stanhope St.</note> among the rest,&#x2014;a very despicable atmosphere indeed! Colds do not rapidly mend in these circumstances; my voice has still a considerably <hi rend="italic">metallic</hi> character, and the poor wife continues to cough a little; however we do not retrograde; we decide to be well in a few days, human nature is bent on being well. Most days for a couple of hours about Noon the poor Sun does struggle into visibility; announces to us, in a very distressed manner, &#x201C;I <hi rend="italic">am</hi> shining elsewhere; out of this abominable Brewer&#x2019;s-Vat, and its exhalations and its fermentations; there are bright things, if you were out of this!&#x201D; &#x2014; We will make but one journey of it, to Alverstoke direct; we are anxious enough to be upon the road as soon as possible! To go afterwards to The Grange, once or more than once, when or how the parties there and the escort thither judge best, will be a real pleasure to us. I will see the Bookseller today; I will write to you tomorrow or next day, specifying with what exactness there may be the horoscope of our times. &#x201C;The middle of the month&#x201D; was the man&#x2019;s last prediction,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For publication of <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi>.</note> and they are busy still with a miserable Portrait of Cromwell: but today I will see more definitely what can be done and what cannot.</p>
<p>To call at the London Library: no, it is not too much trouble; singular to say, it is not half trouble enough! I will announce the Lady Harriet as a Subscriber there; it will be worth two guineas a year to her at any rate: but with regard to new books at present I am sorry to predict that there is next to no chance. At any time, I understand there is a great scramble for such, and the rule with our old heavy Librarian<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >J. G. Cochrane.</note> (a very lazy heavy man) is &#x201C;Serve <pb id="pg-20-42" n="20:42"/>the <hi rend="italic">loudest;</hi>&#x2014;take my life, but do not disturb my peace, ye beautiful people!&#x201D;&#x2014;for it is women always that are scrambling. So that I believe it is but an imperfect resource in that particular. Besides just at present they are shifting all their books to a new house (in St. James&#x2019;s Square),<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >From 49 Pall Mall to Beauchamp House, St. James&#x2019;s Sq., where it is today.</note> and the Library is absolutely shut till the end of this month. Nay you cannot be <hi rend="italic">admitted</hi> for about a fortnight yet; not till some Committee have, for form&#x2019;s sake, seen the application, and said Yes.&#x2014; I will try the man if, on my own footing, he can do anything (everybody&#x2019;s books are <hi rend="italic">returned</hi> at present, lying wrapt up in bales) but I doubt the answer will be negative.</p>
<p>Who is <hi rend="italic">Fl&#xE9;chier;</hi><note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Valentin Esprit Fl&#xE9;chier (<date when="1632-00-00">1632</date>&#x2013;<date when="1710-00-00">1710</date>), bishop of N&#xee;mes, best known for his funeral orations.</note> what else can be tried to help you in this small but needful matter? Employ me, do, order me this way or that, it is all I am good for at present!&#x2014; Is there among Lord Ashburton&#x2019;s books or yours any account of the <hi rend="italic">Bayeux Tapestry?</hi> I am somewhat in quest of that lately for my own behoof too. William the Conqueror&#x2019;s Wife, while her Husband was conquering England, set about <hi rend="italic">sewing</hi> the History of that affair; and there it actually yet is, tho&#x2019; somewhat worn now; laid carefully up in the Cathedral of Bayeux in Normandy; an immense web of ancient sampler-work, divided into scenes and compartments, which used to go round the whole nave of the Cathedral, when exhibited on some Anniversary day:&#x2014; one of the strangest Historical monuments that exist in this world, to my knowledge; and certainly one of the most interesting to all English persons! It has been engraved, with historical annotations, by more than one party; and I am on the trace of it; but I have not yet learned exactly who is the best and real authority in the matter. Would not that be a pretty book; the sewing of the ancient Queen and her maids,&#x2014;brave Queen!<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Made of linen 20 inches wide and more than 230 ft. in length, the Bayeux tapestry shows events in the life of the Saxon king Harold (<date when="1022-00-00">1022</date>?&#x2013;<date when="1066-00-00">66</date>) from the time of his mission to William (<date when="1027-00-00">1027</date>?&#x2013;<date when="1087-00-00">87</date>), duke of Normandy, ca. <date when="1064-00-00">1064</date>, till his death at Hastings.

From <date when="1842-00-00">1842</date> the tapestry had been exhibited in the Biblioth&#xE8;que Publique, and before then at the H&#xF4;tel de Ville in Bayeux. Espinasse says that he inferred from talking to TC that, after finishing <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi>, TC looked for a subject in &#x201C;England of the eleventh century &#x2026; and that William the Conqueror &#x2026; was to be his new hero. &#x2026; His keen interest in the Conqueror &#x2026; had apparently been first aroused by Thierry&#x2019;s well-known History&#x201D; (79&#x2013;80).</note> &#x2014;On the whole employ me, order me; see if I will not obey!</p>

<p><salute>My dear Lady,</salute> You are a member of the London Library, or will be on Saturday first;&#x2014;and you will never get out of it without paying &#xa3;6 sterling! If it bring on a financial crisis,&#x2014;alas, we must apply to your richer friends, we will never see you bankrupt among us, no! The sleepy Librarian has got the <hi rend="italic">Fl&#xE9;chier</hi> of Thiers (an old Political Manuscript of the <hi rend="italic">Esprit Fl&#xE9;chier&#x2019;s</hi>, not of much interest I should doubt);<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably a vol. from Fl&#xE9;chier&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Oeuvres Compl&#xE8;tes</hi>, 10 vols. (Paris, <date when="1825-00-00">1825</date>&#x2013;<date when="1828-00-00">28</date>), referred to by Thiers on his visit to the Grange.</note> but the sleepy Librarian has tied it up somewhere among his bales, and cannot get it out. Here is what he has of attainable according to the List he sent me last night: over any or all of these you can command if they be of the smallest value; these are not yet put up into bales pray note what of them you would like, and they shall be ready for Mr Baring on Monday next. For the <hi rend="italic">Fl&#xE9;chier</hi> also I will make another attempt; tho&#x2019; I fear it will come to nothing with this fat gouty man of ours: slumber and dust and unswept cobwebs reign over his book-dominion; and when you poke him up, he merely utters good words, and rocks from side to side. Tell me if there is any other direction I can endeavour in.&#x2014; Mr Baring, I think, will find at Stanhope Street the Titlepages, Indexes, and other outskirts of your Cromwell sheets; which, if they are all complete, a Gosport Binder will soon stitch to a book.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Bay House is nr. Gosport, Hants.</note> A <hi rend="italic">clean</hi> copy will be ready before long: but this present one we are to keep too, for a memorial, are we not? There will be no <hi rend="italic">Portrait</hi> in it; which, as matters threaten to turn out, is perhaps an advantage. Today I am to go and look after the unfortunate Mechanic (&#x201C;Artist,&#x201D; as he calls himself) who is managing that,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The engraver, Francis Holl.</note> and decide finally whether his whole work is not to be thrown into the fire. If it were not for breaking the poor Booksellers&#x2019; heart, I should at once decide that way: at all events, I shall know him and his &#x201C;Artists&#x201D; another time</p>
<p>As to his &#x201C;day of Publication&#x201D; I find there is no certainty in it till &#x201C;between the 15th and 20th&#x201D;; happily however I have discovered a way of managing that matter without staying here: so we will come independently of that. Another small matter out of Scotland seems to plead for a little delay: but this also we will cunningly eschew:&#x2014;and on the whole, <foreign><hi rend="italic">O Freundin</hi></foreign> [Friend], we will decide to come, we will actually hope to see your face, &#x201C;about the end of next week,&#x201D;&#x2014;say &#x201C;Friday or Saturday&#x201D;!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC is writing on Wed.</note> The <pb id="pg-20-44" n="20:44"/>day and the hour shall be duly specified, that none of your bounties may fall to the ground. And the Heavens, if they are kind, shall turn it to good; and evil shall not dwell in it;&#x2014;for surely it does come out of Heaven, in a sense?</p>
<p>&#x201C;All winter&#x201D;:&#x2014;O my Lady! Have you considered what the cares of sovreignty are; internal administrations, defence from foreign enemies; rule and management in general;&#x2014;and that the Fall of Man is an anciently established fact? You have magnificent ideas; for which the Heavens and I will bless you;&#x2014;and we will realize the same victoriously, so far as we may. But &#x201C;three weeks&#x201D; seems to me a much more reasonable date; in fact that is the general limit we have vaguely had in view here: and such it may continue,&#x2014;as a Bill read a first time; and the sovereign lady and Estates of Parliament can fix it decisively when the term draws nigh.&#x2014;</p>
<p>Have you decided what German Book you are to read? Let me know it, that I may bring a copy too&#x2014; Have you a good German Dictionary? You ought to have a good one:&#x2014;I think you learn all things very fast, German among others. Can I do anything other in the book way for you? Predict as exactly as you yet can.</p>
<p>For my own behoof I wish you would ask Lord Ashburton to lend me over to Bay House his copy of <hi rend="italic">Matthew Paris</hi> and <hi rend="italic">William of Malmesbury</hi>, old Latin Historians of England, (especially the latter, if he have him):<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The English historians Matthew Paris (<date when="1200-00-00">1200</date>?&#x2013;<date when="1259-00-00">1259</date>), author of <hi rend="italic">Chronica Majora</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Historia Anglorum</hi>, and William of Malmesbury (<date when="1096-00-00">1096</date>?&#x2013;<date when="1143-00-00">1143</date>), compiler of <hi rend="italic">Gesta Regum Anglorum</hi>. The latter work was pbd. by the English Historical Soc., <date when="1840-00-00">1840</date>; Paris&#x2019;s commentaries on Roger of Wendover&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Flores Historiarum</hi> were in an appendix of the society&#x2019;s edn., <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>&#x2013;<date when="1844-00-00">44</date>.</note> I think they are both at The Grange; among a long row of white new Books (<hi rend="italic">Historical Society</hi> Books, or some such title) between the end of that Piano where we heard the fine Scotch tune, and the window near the Drawing room door.</p>
<p>How is Lady Ashburton; is Lady Harriet still well? Here is a bright noon: cold abating fast on my part; cough otherwise rather on the increase;&#x2014;but the wind has turned to the south which will help. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign> dear Lady.</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Lawrence,</salute>
<p>I yesterday, some hours after your Letter arrived, got sight of the Engraver and his Plate; and also, for the first time, of your Sketch. The <pb id="pg-20-45" n="20:45"/>Sketch is Capital,&#x2014;the <hi rend="italic">right</hi> face, or very near it, I have no doubt! I have just been begging it from Chapman, to have it put in a frame here; I hope it will prove attainable. It is really very good.</p>
<p>The Plate too, I am happy to say, will probably prosper after all! It is already much improved; the man (Francis Holl, 11. Cornwall Place, Brecknock Street, New Camden Town) is to come down hither and see the <hi rend="italic">mask</hi> &#x26;c before he finish.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A &#x201C;cast of Oliver Cromwell&#x2019;s face taken after death&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-17/lt-18431112-JWC-JW-01"><sic>17:172</sic><corr>JWC to JW, <date when="1843-11-12">12 Nov. 1843</date></corr></ref>).</note>&#x2014; The <hi rend="italic">Mask</hi> lies in your Face too, only a little overlaid; also another Engraving (by Vertue) from Cooper,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Vertue (<date when="1684-00-00">1684</date>&#x2013;<date when="1756-00-00">1756</date>), engraver and antiquary, and Samuel Cooper.</note> which I have here. The principal defect I noticed in your Sketch was a <hi rend="italic">paring-off</hi> of the angle of the jaw; the Mask has an under-jaw like a lion&#x2019;s! The <hi rend="italic">attitude</hi> of your head does not shew that much; and a little touch of shading I suppose would make all the difference. Further it did not seem to me very apparent whether you had given a slight <hi rend="italic">moustache</hi> on the upper lip, or none. The Mask, and all good Portraits that I have seen, give not only a Charles-First on the underlip, but a modest soldier&#x2019;s-moustache on the upper. Lastly your <hi rend="italic">nose</hi> was a little too big,&#x2014;the right kind of nose too; but uncertain whether it was not going to somewhat of a <hi rend="italic">bottle-nose</hi>&#x2014;which is not the character of it, tho&#x2019; under certain aspects a miniature might easily give it so. Indeed Vertue has taken it so. Your eyes too are Vertue&#x2019;s eyes; only the expression of sorrow, affection and anxiety in Vertue&#x2019;s is considerably aggravated.&#x2014; I am well satisfied it is a good Portrait of Cromwell. I will advise the man to have regard to these particulars that I have mentioned. I hope we shall get moderately well thro&#x2019;, after all.</p>
<p>Meantime will you send to Chapman <hi rend="italic">the Correct Copy of the Writing</hi> that is to go to the bottom of the Plate: I know it not,&#x2014;I always forget the Proprietor&#x2019;s title, as Fitzgerald reproaches me for doing:</p>

<p>My Wife and I are going out of Town probably on the very day of your appearance on those boards. Till our return I suppose there will be no hope of seeing you&#x2014;</p>

<p>I owe your Partner at Berlin (unless Mr Varnhagen von Ense have paid him, in which case I owe Mr Varnhagen) for Books got there, the sum of 9 Thaler 15 sgn. I called yesterday to pay you, as I am instructed to do, but <pb id="pg-20-47" n="20:47"/>found nobody there who could tell me what the amount in English money was.</p>
<p>Will you be kind enough to apprise me, as soon as possible, that I may settle it; for I am going out of Town, and want to have a receipt which I can enclose to H<hi rend="italic">n</hi> Varnhagen. I left you the model of one yesterday, and expected to have heard farther of it today.</p>

<salute>Dear Jean,</salute>
<p>I might as well have left you that imperfect Copy of the Cromwell Book; the delay in publication has been greater than I anticipated. However it <hi rend="italic">is</hi> now about coming out; if all go right you will receive a big Packet in the early days of <date when="1845-12-00">December</date>, and one of the Copies for yourself, to read at your leisure in the winter time. They have <hi rend="italic">advertised</hi> it to come out on the 22<hi rend="italic">d</hi> of this month. They are getting a <hi rend="italic">Portrait</hi>engraved,&#x2014;which I fear will not do much for it; the Engraver seemed a very <hi rend="italic">feckless</hi> creature when I went to overhaul him. What is still worse, you will find it a surprisingly dull Book;&#x2014;and you and the Public must make up your minds for a piece of hard work in reading it, or else you will make nothing of it!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I felt myself in rather good case when I arrived here, and so was Jane too: but the cold fogs came upon us unawares about a fortnight ago; and both of us, I first, caught an ugly dose of cold! Mine in a few days was subdued, and is now gone; but Jane has not got off so easily; a troublesome little dry cough still hangs about her occasionally, tho&#x2019; she is otherwise pretty well, and that too is going. Our climate about this season is very bad; dirty fogs with eastwind seem to me far worse than rain itself. We have now however got westerly airs again; and the weather, for <date when="1845-11-00">November</date>, is beautiful;&#x2014;only great apprehensions of scarcity are justly entertained. The Potatoes are clearly a failure everywhere; and food will infallibly be scarce.</p>
<p>No work, or anything deserving the name, is likely to come out of me for a great while yet! I do nothing hitherto but read a little; and &#x201C;dauner [stroll] about.&#x201D; Nay on Friday or Saturday next we are to set off for our visit to the South Coast: great folks, very kind to us, and extremely rational wealthy people;&#x2014;they promise me &#x201C;a horse, and all manner of nice things&#x201D;; and the winter climate I believe is the best or one of the best in England, a thing that may be very useful, especially for Jane. How long we shall be <pb id="pg-20-48" n="20:48"/>able to stand it, is not settled yet; <hi rend="italic">so</hi> long as it is pleasant; and that will depend on several things,&#x2014;on my going idle, or being allowed fairly to work a little, for one thing!&#x2014; If you hear no more, you suppose us to be there on Saturday next;&#x2014;the place is near Portsmouth, close by the seashore, a mile or two from the Isle of Wight; about 70 miles, by railway, from this. You will write to us there by and by; the Address is T.C. &#x26;c / Hon. W. Bingham Baring / Bay House / Alverstoke / Hants/.&#x2014;</p>
<p>The Doctor is very busy, working at a Translation of <hi rend="italic">Dante.</hi> A long job: but now that he has got fairly fastened, I think he will complete it, and it may be really good for something,&#x2014;better than <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi>, as I say! <closer><salute>Good be with you, dear Jean.</salute></closer></p>
<closer><salute>Ever your affectionate</salute></closer> <name>T. C.</name>
<ps><p>Will you tell Mr Aird that we have his Book,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Aird, <hi rend="italic">The Old Bachelor in the Old Scottish Village</hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1845-00-00">1845</date>); a prose work.</note> with many thanks; and are travelling thro&#x2019; it in the evenings.</p></ps>

<salute>Dear Christie,</salute>
<p>My recollection of the matter is not very perfect; but I think the <hi rend="italic">best</hi> Copyist I ever had, some two years ago, received at the rate of three-pence per 100 words (which is perhaps 1&#xBD; <hi rend="italic">d</hi> for a common folio page), and was well satisfied with the bargain.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-16/lt-18430314-TC-MRI-01"><sic>16:84</sic><corr>TC to MRI, <date when="1843-03-14">14 March 1843</date></corr></ref>, <ref target="volume-16/lt-18430315-TC-RWE-01"><sic>85</sic><corr>TC to RWE, <date when="1843-03-15">15 March 1843</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-16/lt-18430324-TC-MAC-01"><sic>96</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1843-03-24">24 March 1843</date></corr></ref>.</note> Another very stupid-looking man, from the British Museum, proposed, I think, two-pence per 70 words; but I did not employ him. This is about the highest rate they get when working by the piece. Last year, I had for a long time a very useful man, who could work with his <hi rend="italic">head</hi> as well as his fingers when you shewed him the way: his rate was 6 hours a-day of any kind of labour for a guinea a week. His name is Dr Christie; an Aberdeen Scotchman; a very faithful industrious and intelligent young man: I think he has got, or is about getting, some permanent appointment since I had done with him.</p>
<p>I know no Letters or Documents of the time of Charles II that are worth publishing; I know huge masses of putrid rubbish, already published about him and his affairs, which are worth eternal suppression; which call earnestly for the aid of <hi rend="italic">fire</hi>, to deliver the air from the smell of them! I beseech you have a strict and even stern regard to that great and for the present forgotten truth!&#x2014; In the <hi rend="italic">old</hi> editions of Collins&#x2019;s Peerage (about <date when="1760-00-00">1760</date> or <pb id="pg-20-49" n="20:49"/>earlier,&#x2014;2<hi rend="italic">d</hi> edit<hi rend="italic">n</hi> is of <date when="1741-00-00">1741</date>), you will fall in with various things; generally very correct, which is a great distinction to them.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For Collins&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Peerage of England</hi>, see <ref target="volume-18/lt-18441210-TC-EF-01"><sic>18:281</sic><corr>TC to EF, <date when="1844-12-10">10 Dec. 1844</date></corr></ref>.

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Many thanks for your good little Letter;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Margaret Carlyle wrote, <date when="1845-11-02">2 Nov.</date>: &#x201C;Jenny left us that day week after you left so I was alone again I felt rather dull for a while I am wonderfull well thank God Isabella is a good deal better and stirs about a little &#x2026; Jamie has got his crop all in which is a tolerable good one except the potatos they are nearly usles.&#x201D;</note> which was very welcome to us here. You need never let us want for a Letter: the essential of the news we require, you have only to take a bit of paper, and write them down for us at any time! &#x201C;Dear Tom, I am tolerably well&#x201D;: whenever you can say that, surely it will be well worth its postage to us here!&#x2014; Isabella&#x2019;s Letter too was very comfortable news; she must be very considerably improved indeed since I first arrived: let us hope the busi<supplied>[ness]</supplied><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letters omitted.</note> will go on in that way, till she be fairly <hi rend="italic">herself</hi> once again.</p>
<p>Jack says he wrote to you lately. He is well, and very busy; was here last night, and I had a walk with him. He is working really hard at a Translation of <hi rend="italic">Date</hi>,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Espinasse says that John Carlyle had almost given up practicing medicine and turned his attention to Dante, noting how he had seen &#x201C;much of Italy and the Italians&#x201D; when a traveling physician and acquired a &#x201C;thorough mastery&#x201D; of the language (108&#x2013;9). Yet, while he was working on Dante, &#x201C;Carlyle rather pooh-poohed his zeal as expended on an &#x2018;obsolete&#x2019; theme&#x201D; (109). On the other hand, A. J. Symington, in <hi rend="italic">Some Personal Reminiscences of Carlyle</hi> (Paisley, <date when="1886-00-00">1886</date>), claimed that TC told him that he had &#x201C;long &#x2026; unsuccessfully urged his brother to set about&#x201D; the trans., until he artfully assured his brother that he was too old and should give it up. Forthwith, said TC, he set to work &#x201C;and produced one of the very best translations of Dante to be found anywhere&#x201D; (112&#x2013;14). Again, in <date when="1863-00-00">1863</date>, TC told Symington that, apart from the English Bible, &#x201C;he knew of no translation so good as his brother&#x2019;s&#x201D; (31). See also John Carlyle&#x2019;s pref. to his <hi rend="italic">Dante&#x2019;s Divine Comedy</hi> (<date when="1849-00-00">1849</date>), including his acknowledgement of TC as the &#x201C;highly accomplished friend, whose name I am not allowed to mention&#x201D; (xi).</note> and I think will likely persist till he end it; which is really an <pb id="pg-20-50" n="20:50"/>improvement upon his late way of living: the Translation may turn out to be useful for somebody or other; at all events, as I say, it is very clearly, at the lowest computation, much better than <hi rend="italic">nothing at all,</hi>&#x2014;which is the other branch of the alternative at present! I think he will persist; he is obstinate enough when he once begins. Of course if I could do him any good in it, I gladly would.&#x2014; He seems to me to mean decidedly to come to you by and by, tho&#x2019; he does not positively say so. Probably next month, I should guess. But the weather is very fine here at present; better than is usual in Annandale in <date when="1845-11-00">November</date>: moreover he arrives at a kind of <hi rend="italic">stage</hi> in his business about the end of this month, and will be disinclined to move till then.</p>
<p>Our colds are about gone here; mine altogether gone; Jane has still some remains of a kind of cough, but that also is fast going. The change of the wind into the South and West is very useful for us in that respect; indeed the weather in the country hereabouts at present is quite bright, dry and warm.&#x2014; I have done next to nothing since my return hither except run about superintending some details of my Book, the <hi rend="italic">Portrait</hi> of Cromwell, and other small <hi rend="italic">etceteras</hi>. The Book is now actually advertised to &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">come out</hi> on the 22<hi rend="italic">d</hi>&#x201D;; so that I shall have <hi rend="italic">altogether</hi> done with it before long, and never in my life be plagued with it more! Your Copy, copies for all of you will come to Dumfries about the beginning of <date when="1845-12-00">December</date>, I hope; and you may set to it in the short days tooth and nail!&#x2014;</p>
<p>We did not go to the Lord Ashburton place which they call The Grange; the Lady fell unwell, and had to give up that project. And now we are to go at the end of this week for the <hi rend="italic">long visit</hi> I was telling you of, to L<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Ashburton&#x2019;s son and daughter-in-law: it is settled we are to be there on friday or Saturday next. How long, remains entirely unfixed; I should think perhaps three weeks or so. It is close by the Isle of Wight, a narrow arm of the sea lying between: they call the Place Bay House; it is near Portsmouth also; some sixty or seventy miles from London, by railway; one of the dryest climates and pleasantest places, I hear; and the people are very fond of us,&#x2014;and promise me &#x201C;a horse&#x201D; &#x26;c! certainly one of the likeliest places for <hi rend="italic">hourying,</hi><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Either &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">hourying</hi></foreign>&#x201D; or &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">lourying</hi></foreign>&#x201D;: meaning uncertain. See also <ref target="volume-20/lt-18451126-TC-JCA-01">TC to JCA, <date when="1845-11-26">26 Nov.</date></ref></note> if one had a turn that way! How we get on there will depend on my finding any sort of employment (reading or the like) that I can prosecute withal. We shall see; and I will let you know how we come on, before long. It is a great privilege to get out of London and its sooty fogs and confusions for a while; and may do the health of both of us, some good.</p>
<p>The meal &#x26;c is not likely to arrive in time for us now. Jenny&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">flannel things</hi> will be the only disadvantage in that. However, we can do with what flannels are still discoverable here; and the other things can be forwarded <pb id="pg-20-51" n="20:51"/>to us to Bay House whenever they do arrive. It will be best for Jamie just to proceed in the matter at his own pace; and all will be right whether the cargo come to hand a week sooner or a week later.&#x2014; Meal will be meal, I suppose, this year: there is every prospect of a scarcity; indeed a <hi rend="italic">scarcity</hi> cannot fail; there are even fearful apprehensions of a famine in some quarters. Let us hope, not.&#x2014; &#x2014; I mean to write to Alick before I leave Chelsea: they have never yet sent me his last Letter. I do not very well know how to send his Copy of the Book, but shall find some way.&#x2014; I hope the Stable is now covered in, and the litter in some measure cleared from the doors. <closer><salute>Take care of yourself; dear Mother! I will write soon again. Your affectionate</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>We are going out of Town for a while, on Friday; and are in a considerable bustle here. The <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi>, I understand, is announced for the 22<hi rend="italic">d</hi>: it will therefore be necessary to adopt the plan you recommended about the Presentation Copies. If you could send your man tomorrow with 25 of them, I would write the Names on them, and send you the correct List of Addresses on another Paper; by which means they could be forwarded with<hi rend="italic">out</hi> delay when the Book comes out. I owe many persons some acknowledgement for help received in the course of the Work; but these are all I can make a List of at present: if I recollect of more, I must apply to you again.</p>
<p>This morning I have a Letter from Lawrence, and have written pressingly to the Engraver<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Laurence and Holl.</note> to come down to me without delay that I may shew him this Letter and the Prints &#x26;c I have got here.</p>
<p>Nutt <hi rend="italic">is</hi> the man for Varnhagen&#x2019;s Parcel; which I hope is in a state of forwardness.</p>
<p>Our Address on and after Saturday next if you hear no farther, is:</p>
<p>Hon. W. B. Baring<lb/>
Bay House<lb/>
Alverstoke<lb/>
Hants.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-20-52" n="20:52"/>Tomorrow till past noon I wait for the Engraver, and other purposes, here.</p>
<closer><salute>In haste / Yours always truly</salute></closer>

<ps><p>Will you be so good as pay the Enclosed &#xa3;1.9 to Nutt&#x2019;s people, and get me that receipt <hi rend="italic">of</hi> theirs <hi rend="italic">signed;</hi> and then return it along with the Sheets of the 25 Books tomorrow.&#x2014; The Post Office Draft is in your <hi rend="italic">own</hi> name.</p></ps>

<salute>My dear Emerson,</salute>
<p>I have had two Letters from you since I wrote any; the latest of them was lying here for me when I returned, about three weeks ago; the other I had received in Scotland: it was only the last that demanded a special answer;&#x2014; which, alas, I meant faithfully to give it, but did not succeed!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC had last written on <ref target="volume-19/lt-18450829-TC-RWE-01"><date when="1845-08-29">29 Aug.</date></ref> and had received Emerson&#x2019;s letters of <date when="1845-09-15">15</date> and <date when="1845-09-30">30 Sept.</date></note> With meet despatch I made the Bookseller get ready for you a Copy of the unpublished <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> Book; hardly complete as yet, it was nevertheless put together, and even some kind of odious rudiments of a <hi rend="italic">Portrait</hi> were bound up with it; and the Packet inscribed with your address was put into Wiley and Putnam&#x2019;s<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >N.Y. publisher with a bookshop at 6 Waterloo Pl., specializing in American books.</note> hands in time for the Mail Steamer;&#x2014;and I hope has duly arrived? If it have not, pray set the Booksellers a-hunting. Wiley and Putnam was the Carrier&#x2019;s name; this is all the indication I can give, but this, I hope, if indeed any prove needful, will be enough. One may hope you have the Book already in your hands, a fortnight before this reaches you, a month before any other Copy can reach America. In which case the Parcel, <hi rend="italic">without</hi> any Letter, must have seemed a little enigmatic to you! The reason was this: I miscounted the day of the month, unlucky that I was. Sitting down one morning with full purpose to write at large, and all my tools round me, I discover that it is no longer the <date when="1845-11-03"><hi rend="italic">third</hi> of November</date>; that it is already the <date when="1845-11-04"><hi rend="italic">fourth</hi></date>, and the American Mail-Packet has already lifted anchor! Irrevocable, irremediable! Nothing remained but to wait for the <date when="1845-11-18">18th</date>;&#x2014;and now, as you see, to take Time by the forelock,&#x2014;<foreign><hi rend="italic">queue</hi></foreign> [tail], as we all know, he has none.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The arrangement was to be a muddle. Indignant with Wiley &#x26; Putnam for withholding his presentation copy, Emerson hastened to send TC&#x2019;s letter on to his lawyer-brother in N.Y., <date when="1845-12-14">14 Dec.</date>, and asked him to retrieve the book (Rusk 3:315&#x2013;17). As Emerson was to explain, he also tried to persuade Horace Greeley (<date when="1811-00-00">1811</date>&#x2013;<date when="1872-00-00">72</date>) of the <hi rend="italic">New York Tribune</hi> to publish the work, but found it was too late (see <ref target="volume-20/lt-18451229-TC-EC-01">TC to EC, <date when="1845-12-29">29 Dec.</date></ref>). He soon learned from Wiley &#x26; Putnam that they had bought the right to first American publication from Chapman &#x26; Hall for a mere &#xa3;10. This was confirmed in <ref target="volume-20/lt-18460103-TC-RWE-01">TC to RWE, <date when="1846-01-03">3 Jan. 1846</date></ref>, when TC had to admit that the confusion was the result of his own hurry and carelessness.</note></p>
<p><pb id="pg-20-53" n="20:53"/>My visit to Scotland was wholesome for me; tho&#x2019; full of sadness, as the like always is. Thirty Years mows away a Generation of Men. The old Hills the old Brooks and Houses are still there; but the Population has marched away, almost all; it is not there any more. I cannot enter into light talk with the survivors and successors; I withdraw into silence, and converse with the old dumb crags rather, in a melancholy and abstruse manner.&#x2014; Thank God, my good old Mother is still there; old and frail, but still young of heart; as young and strong <hi rend="italic">there</hi>, I think, as ever. It is beautiful to see affection survive where all else is submitting to decay; the altar with its sacred fire still burning when the outer walls are all slowly crumbling; material Fate saying, &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">They</hi> are mine&#x201D;!&#x2014; I read some insignificant Books; smoked a great deal of tobacco; and went moping about among the hills and hollow water-courses, somewhat like a shade in Hades.

Of which, in fact, I am getting more and more weary; sometimes really impatient. It seems to me the reign of Cant and Spoonyism has about lasted long enough.

<p>The Book on Cromwell is not to come out till the 22<hi rend="italic">d</hi> of this month.

<salute>My Lady,</salute>
<p>We will come on Saturday, if we hear nothing from you: on Saturday, by the Eleven-o&#x2019;clock Train, which professes to arrive at Gosport at a quarter past Two. This is the arrangement. The rest is with the <hi rend="italic">Nornas</hi>&#x2014;Norse-Teutonic Destinies, who are said occasionally to favour them that deserve well!&#x2014; I will bring my Goethe; we will read together, if it please those said Weird Sisters.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Macbeth</hi> 1.3.

<p>Mr Baring did not call, faithless that he is. May the Tories soon bodily be out of Office, as by and by they will be, without prayer of mine!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alarmed by the failure of the potato crop, the main means of subsistence of the Irish, Sir Robert Peel concluded that duties must be removed from imported grain.

The <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> wrote, <date when="1845-11-13">13 Nov.</date>: &#x201C;The recent decision, or, rather, indecision of the Cabinet is as inexplicable as it is unfortunate. No one pretends to say that things can remain as they are. Sooner or later a suspension of the duties on imported grain must take place &#x2026; and so evident is this, that most people are astonished at the procrastination which Ministers have interposed between popular expectation and an inevitable necessity.&#x201D; William Baring, Lady Harriet&#x2019;s husband. was paymaster gen. in Peel&#x2019;s ministry; but, meanwhile, Peel had authorized Baring Bros. &#x26; Co. to buy &#xa3;100.000 of maize from the U.S.</note></p>

<salute>My Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Again accept many thanks for your kind Letter, for your kind punctuality in sending me that little Note of Monies, which completes our small Book-operation, and perfects your service to me in regard to it. Here is Bookseller Nutt&#x2019;s receipt for the amount; and so we conclude with the Scotch Wish on glad occasions, &#x201C;May never worse be among us!&#x201D;</p>
<p>Your commission for the Schiller Portraits was very easily executed. I have made the Bookseller send you Six, that you might have Two still on hand, since Four were already disposed of: they are put into a copy of the little Book itself, and are to leave London, by Nutt&#x2019;s Parcel, on Tuesday next, four days hence. I hope they will come all right; and be a momentary pleasure to your friends and you. I have not been able to see them myself; but Chapman the Bookseller is a punctual man. About the beginning of <date when="1845-12-00">December</date> he will send you, by the same conveyance, a copy of the Cromwell: a rather bungling Engraver is busy with a Portrait of the old Puritan Hero,&#x2014;which I am somewhat afraid he will spoil. Our artists are, for most part, properly <hi rend="italic">Mechanics;</hi> and excel, if at all, only in that latter department!&#x2014;</p>
<p>We have <hi rend="italic">Preuss&#x2019;s</hi> big Book in our library here,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Friedrich der Grosse; eine Lebensgeschichte</hi>, 5 vols. (Berlin, <date when="1832-00-00">1832</date>&#x2013;<date when="1834-00-00">34</date>).</note> tho&#x2019; not quite accessible at present: I design to consult it and others by and by. <hi rend="italic">Archenholz</hi> is an old friend of mine; the first Book I ever read in German,&#x2014;many years ago now!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Johann Wilhelm von Archenholz, <hi rend="italic">Geschichte des Siebenj&#xE4;hrigen Krieges in Deutschland</hi> (Frankfurt, <date when="1788-00-00">1788</date>); see <ref target="volume-01/lt-18190825-TC-JOFE-01"><sic>1:193</sic><corr>TC to JOFE, <date when="1819-08-25">25 Aug. 1819</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-01/lt-18210600-TC-LIST-01"><sic>7:370&#x2013;71</sic><corr>TC to LIST, <date when="1821-06-04">4 June 1821</date></corr></ref>; much cited in TC&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi>.</note>&#x2014; &#x2014; By the way, would you on some good occasion send me a complete List of all your Writings. We have most of them here in our London Library, a favourite reading for all manner of intelligent men and women: but I think they are hardly all here, and we ought to have them all. Pray do not forget this.&#x2014; I have lately been reading B&#xfc;low-Cummerow <pb id="pg-20-56" n="20:56"/>on Prussia:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ernst Gottfried Georg von B&#xfc;low-Cummerow, <hi rend="italic">Preussen, seine Verfassung, seine Verwaltung, sein Verh&#xE4;ltniss zu Deutschland</hi> (Berlin, <date when="1842-00-00">1842</date>).</note> a somewhat commonplace, longwinded, watery man: out of whom, however, I glean some glimpses of Prussian Life, which are very strange to me. Almost the <hi rend="italic">converse</hi> of ours: full of struggle, fully of energy and difficulty; so like and so unlike!</p>
<p>Our wanderings here are not yet concluded. The day after tomorrow we go down to the Sea-Coast in Hampshire, for a week or two of winter sunshine, and the sight of kind friends, in a climate much superior to London at this season. One of our gracious Hosts is the Lady to whom that <hi rend="italic">Friedrich</hi> Book of Prints you sent us has gone.&#x2014; I should have told you long since that my Wife made friendship with Miss Wynne, of whom we hope to see more in time coming.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charlotte Williams Wynn.</note></p>
<p><closer><salute>And so for the present, Farewell. I will wish strength and good-speed; courageous resistance to the Winter, and to all other enemies and obstacles, of which a man finds always enough! With true regard Yours always</salute></closer></p>

My personal connection with Reviews, &#x26;c., has altogether ceased, for a long while; nor indeed is there any very clear way of seeking to give furtherance to a man of real merit, amid the crowd of empty pretenders and of false judges that we have at present. But it is the more incumbent on one to do what is possible; and in that I will endeavour not to fail as occasion serves. &#x2026; Reviews, I believe, do little good nowadays, except by the <hi rend="italic">extracts</hi> they give, which keep alive some memory of the Book till people judge of it for themselves. Our address for the next two or three weeks is&#x2014;Hon. W. B. Baring, Bay House, Alverstoke, Hants (we are setting out thither for a little more of the country tomorrow). Or Chelsea, the old address, will always find us after a short delay. John is still &#x2018;gravitating&#x2019; towards you; will alight in Dumfries, I believe, by-and-by&#x2014;when the fogs have become heavy enough. He is very <pb id="pg-20-57" n="20:57"/>busy with Dante, &#x26;c., at present, and seems lazy to move. This, in spite of its fogs, is the Paradise of &#x2018;men at large,&#x2019; this big Babylon of ours.</p>
<p>We have in the evenings gone over the &#x2018;Old Bachelor in his Scottish Village,&#x2019;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-20/lt-18451109-TC-JCA-01">TC to JCA, <date when="1845-11-09">9 Nov.</date></ref></note> and find him a capital fellow of his sort.

<salute>Dearest Babbie</salute>
<p>I must not leave you so good a pretext for not writing to me as doubt about my actual address&#x2014; Of course a letter addressed to Cheyne Row would be sent after me even to Timbuctoo&#x2014;but these simple ideas are slow of suggesting themselves to those who find the state of uncertainty favour their natural tendency to sit still, with their hands gracefully crossed in Indian-God-like adoration of the Force of Circumstances&#x2014; Know then, to leave you without excuse, that I am <hi rend="italic">here</hi>&#x2014;very accessible to letters&#x2014;and much in want of them&#x2014;here being&#x2014;Bay House&#x2014;a large fantastical looking <hi rend="italic">New</hi> Building on the shore of the Sea &#x26; belonging to Lord Ashburton but made over for this winter to Lady Harriet&#x2014; It is not <hi rend="italic">in</hi> the Isle of Wight as I had fancied but opposite to it&#x2014; I dare say it is a charming place in Summer but in winter all that body of cold water which immense ranges of windows look out on makes me feel like William Gibson &#x201C;rather chilly&#x201D;&#x2014;and then the gardens about it have lost their bloom for this year and the <hi rend="italic">woods</hi> are as yet prospective&#x2014;more like nursery-grounds than anything else&#x2014; Inside, it is warm enough and magnificent as money and taste can make it&#x2014; Carlyle and I have <hi rend="italic">two</hi> rooms which I stipulated for before I would undertake to come at all&#x2014;and the first principle of living comfortably in another persons house is granted one amply <foreign>viz</foreign>: one is &#x201C;well let alone&#x201D;&#x2014;may do as one likes within reasonable limits&#x2014; But the grand happiness of friendly intercourse&#x2014;<foreign>viz</foreign>: leave to be &#x201C;as ugly and stupid and disagreeable as one likes&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">that</hi> of course is out of the question here&#x2014;<foreign><hi rend="italic">tanto peggio per me</hi></foreign> [so much the worse for me]! My cold thanks God was considerably abated before I left home&#x2014;and is no worse for the &#x201C;fine change&#x201D; (as Helen would say)&#x2014;and I <pb id="pg-20-58" n="20:58"/>was cut out of my complication with M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Paulet in the most unexpected manner&#x2014; As I had feared just when we were on the eve of setting off they arrived in London for the Operation!&#x2014;giving me just twelve hours notice&#x2014; I was in the horriblest <hi rend="italic">quandary</hi>; to go away and leave them alone there with their troubles was impossible for me&#x2014;to renounce the visit here equally <hi rend="italic">impossible</hi>&#x2014;in another sense&#x2014; I meditated a sort of compromise between the two impossible&#x2014;to let Carlyle go without me and follow in a week or two&#x2014;but the following morning in rushed M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Paulet fresh and rosy like a lump of coral and told me they were all to go back the road they had come that very day&#x2014;the eyes were not ready to be operated on. Instead of sympathizing in their provocation I was heartily thankful that all that money had been spent and trouble undertaken for no end&#x2014;by the time they return I hope that I also shall be returned&#x2014;in a month or six weeks she said&#x2014; Lady Harriet insists we are to stay here &#x201C;all the winter&#x201D;&#x2014; to stay &#x201C;till parliament meets in <date when="1846-02-00">February</date>&#x201D;&#x2014;but I fancy Carlyles need to be ugly and stupid and disagreeable without restraint never to speak of my own, will send us back to London in a month or so&#x2014;</p>
<p>I feel as if I should get on here in an even, middlingly pleasant sort of a way. I am not in the horribly excitable state I was in when I went to Addiscombe<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For four days at the end of <date when="1845-06-00">June</date> and beginning of <date when="1845-07-00">July</date>.</note>&#x2014; I take things now very calmly&#x2014;almost coolly&#x2014; Lady Harriet seems a woman of <hi rend="italic">good sense</hi> and perfect good breeding&#x2014;and with a person of that sort one need not, unless one be a fool oneself have any <hi rend="italic">collisions</hi>&#x2014;at the same time she seems to me so <hi rend="italic">systematic</hi> and <hi rend="italic">superior</hi> to her <hi rend="italic">natural feeling</hi> that however long and pleasantly I may live beside her I am sure I shall never feel <hi rend="italic">warm affection</hi> for her nor inspire her with warm affection&#x2014;her intercourse will remain <hi rend="italic">an honour for me</hi> never be a heartfelt delight&#x2014;as it might be if she were as loving as she is charming&#x2014;and Bay House will consequently not suit me so well as Seaforth House&#x2014;</p>
<p>Plattnauer returned from Germany some weeks ago&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">not changed</hi> the least in the world&#x2014;except that he is now entirely in his natural senses&#x2014; He had in rummaging in a Cabinet of his Brother in law<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Count Oskar von Reichenbach.</note> come upon all my letters about his madness!! read them&#x2014;and even &#x201C;taken a copy of one of them&#x201D;&#x2014;his vexation had been considerable&#x2014;especially over my &#x201C;excessive eagerness to have him kept in Germany for the rest of his life&#x201D;&#x2014;but he spoke even of this <foreign><hi rend="italic">contretemps</hi></foreign> with a courtesy and justness which proved as much as anything his sane state of mind&#x2014;he brought me a beautifully embroidered card case from his Sister&#x2014;it might have been done by Titania Queen of the Fairies!</p>
<p>And now it will behoove me to go and dress for dinner&#x2014;at <hi rend="italic">seven</hi> in these <pb id="pg-20-59" n="20:59"/>days instead of <hi rend="italic">four</hi> Lady Harriets usual hour&#x2014;but after tomorrow thank goodness we are to return to christian habits&#x2014; A M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Senior who is here causes the present formalities</p>

<p>A poor meritorious Scotchman, a Burgher Minister in Dundee, of the name of Gilfillan, has published a Book,&#x2014;I believe at his own expense too, poor fellow,&#x2014;under the Title, <hi rend="italic">Gallery of Literary Portraits</hi>, or some such thing; and is about sending, as in duty bound, a Copy to the <hi rend="italic">Quarterly</hi>.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Quarterly Review</hi>, of which Lockhart was ed.</note> I know not whether this poor Book will in the least lie in your way: but to prevent you throwing it aside without so much as looking at it, I write now to bear witness that the man is really a person of superior parts; and that his Book, of which I have read some of the Sections, first published in a Country Newspaper that comes to me,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Dumfries Courier.</hi></note> is worthy of being looked at a little by you,&#x2014;that you may decide then, with cause shewn, whether there <hi rend="italic">is</hi> anything to be done with it. I am afraid not very much! A strange Oriental, Scriptural style, full of fervour, and crude gloomy fire,&#x2014;a kind of <hi rend="italic">opium</hi> style However you must look a little, and say.</p>
<p>This testimony I have volunteered to send, having seen the man as well as his writing;&#x2014;and now this is all I have to say. The antecedents to this step, and the corollaries that follow from it on your part and on mine are not needed to be written. I believe you will do me the honour (a very great honour as times go) to <hi rend="italic">believe</hi> what I have written: and the helping of a poor fellow that has merit, when he can be helped,&#x2014;this I take it is at all times felt to be a pleasure and a blessing by you as by me. And so enough of it.</p>
<p>We are here on the Hampshire Coasts, hiding with kind Friends from the London Fogs for a while: a pleasant place in comparison,&#x2014;especially when one has tobacco and nothing to do! When I return to Town I design <pb id="pg-20-60" n="20:60"/>again to try Sussex Place;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >No. 24, Regent&#x2019;s Pk., Lockhart&#x2019;s home.</note> tho&#x2019; my successes there are rather far between, of late. Why do you never come to see me?&#x2014;</p>

<salute>Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I have got your two Notes and thank you for them, only wishing they had been longer. I have also had this little Note from Scotsbrig, and will enclose it to you.</p>
<p>And now there are two things which I want you to do, so far as you find them doable. <hi rend="italic">First</hi>, to deliver that Note of Childs&#x2019;s, any day you are passing Bohn&#x2019;s shop,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Childs (<sic><date when="1783-00-00">1783</date></sic><corr><date when="1784-00-00">1784</date></corr>&#x2013;<date when="1853-00-00">1853</date>; <ref target="volume-20/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/5302"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), printer of Bungay, Suffolk; see <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410924-TC-JCHI-01"><sic>13:262</sic><corr>TC to JCHI, <date when="1841-09-24">24 Sept. 1841</date></corr></ref>.

(see <ref target="volume-18/lt-18440805-TC-JAC-01"><sic>18:166</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1844-08-05">5 Aug. 1844</date></corr></ref>).

He is not to be confused with Dr. John Christie, later set to make better copies covering several hundred pages, which were nevertheless highly imperfect and incomplete. It is these to which TC refers; they survive (with TC&#x2019;s marginalia and comments) in FC 48.8.23&#x2013;26, discovered by D. J. Trela; see Trela, &#x201C;The Writing of &#x2018;An Election to the Long Parliament&#x2019;: Carlyle, Primary Research and Book Clubs,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Norman and Charlotte Strouse Lectures on Carlyle and His Era,</hi> vol. 4 (Santa Cruz Univ.

John Carlyle sent the MS to Bruce (see <ref target="volume-20/lt-18451201-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1845-12-01">1 Dec.</date></ref>), who was strongly impressed and took lengthy extracts for what evidently began as a review of J. O. Halliwell&#x2019;s edn. of D&#x2019;Ewes&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Autobiography</hi> in the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review</hi> 84 (<date when="1846-07-00">July 1846</date>):76&#x2013;102. The review consisted almost entirely of extracts from D&#x2019;Ewes&#x2019;s journal in the Harleian MSS at the British Museum, taken no doubt from Christie&#x2019;s transcript. No acknowledgments were made, presumably at TC&#x2019;s wish, but Bruce developed his account in an eloquently Carlylean manner, declaring that he wanted to direct attention to D&#x2019;Ewes&#x2019;s notes on the part of the public and of the &#x201C;private Publishing Societies&#x201D; (101&#x2013;2). Eventually the first part of the journals of the Long Parliament was pbd. as <hi rend="italic">The Journals of Sir Simonds D&#x2019;Ewes</hi> (New Haven, Conn., <date when="1923-00-00">1923</date>), ed. Wallace Notestein, who explained that TC and Bruce failed to publish them simply because there was too much material, which was also difficult to decipher. TC later passed the transcripts to Forster, who kept them but said that he found himself unable to make satisfactory use of the work in his <hi rend="italic">Historical and Biographical Essays</hi>, 2 vols.

That latter point you are to ascertain for me. The Transcript lies in two volumes or sewed masses in one of the Drawers of the little Cabinet or Chest-of-Drawers in the Closet of my bedroom. The Drawers there are all locked but one: if the <hi rend="italic">Ms</hi>. lie in that one unlocked Drawer (it is the short Drawer, next the window I think, the second from the top), you will be able to attain it, and can then deal with it as directed in Note N<hi rend="italic">o</hi> 2:if it do <hi rend="italic">not</hi>, we must consider it as unattainable.

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Accept many thanks for your continued remembrance of me, for your continued kindness to me. I have sent your missive by a sure hand to Bohn, and expect to find the Book waiting for me when I return to Chelsea. The Address there is, 5. Cheyne Row; when you yourself come to Town, it would be a kindness if you called and asked for me.</p>
<p>The Book on Cromwell will prove very dull, but I hope very authentic; and may, either soon or by degrees, put an end to large quantities of brutal error and confusion which at present deface the memory of that Hero.

It was not acted on, though a statue of Cromwell was erected outside the Houses of Parliament in <date when="1889-00-00">1889</date>.</note> I think it may be as well for him <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to be seen among such company as he is like to find there.</p>
<p>We are down here on a visit, happily escaping the London Fogs for a while at this bad season. In a week or two we shall have to front them again.</p>

<salute>Dear Jean,</salute>
<p>We got hither on the day specified, which was Saturday gone a week; and have now got ourselves moderately adjusted to our new quarters; from which, in considerable haste, I will write you a word about our proceedings and condition.</p>
<p>On that subject indeed there is not much to be said; for our whole life here might be defined as one continual course of <hi rend="italic">Handsomely doing nothing;</hi> which to persons occasionally busy is not so absurd now and then. This is a beautiful fantastic new Mansion, close by the shore of a beautiful narrow arm of the Sea, looking over to the towns and hills of the Isle of Wight (some four or five miles off) with all the Shipping of Portsmouth coursing to and fro on it as their winds and destinations prescribe. Our beach for miles on either hand is clear flinty gravel, with <foreign><hi rend="italic">whin</hi></foreign> [furze] bushes and beautiful tracts of green sward,&#x2014;sprinkled a little with fantastic sea-mansions and bathing-quarters; but for the rest very solitary, very agreeable to one that wishes to be let alone. Our two hosts, Mr Baring and his Wife, are generally alone with us; excellent friendly polite people; there are horses, carriages, all manner of conveniences:&#x2014;and tho&#x2019; the multitude of Flunkies and general parade of the place somewhat confuses us, we contrive to do very well; and shall be able, I think, to do the <foreign><hi rend="italic">hourying</hi></foreign><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-20/lt-18451110-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1845-11-10">10 Nov.</date></ref></note> function with tolerable effect till the time for handsomely ending it arrive. A good swift ride every day is a very great convenience to me: I ought to grow better, if I had once learned to <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi>, which however I have not yet quite succeeded in. Jane is pretty well; and does well with the <pb id="pg-20-63" n="20:63"/>Lady, who is a very great, noble and imperious person, capable I think of being <hi rend="italic">either</hi> all sunshine of the brightest, or all lightning of the hottest: not every one that she can do with! In case of &#x201C;lightning,&#x201D; of course, there would remain for us nothing but the Railway Train, and foggy Chelsea again!&#x2014;</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> is coming out in London tomorrow. You <hi rend="italic">will</hi> get it in the beginning of the month.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC later listed those to whom copies of the first edn., the Supplement, and the second edn. were sent, heading it &#x201C;List of Letters / 1<hi rend="italic">st</hi> and 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.&#x201D; It begins with &#x201C;Scotsbrig / Mother / James / Jenny, Jean, Mary / James Stewart&#x201D;; then &#x201C;Liverpool 2,&#x201D; &#x201C;Grange 2,&#x201D; John Mill, and numerous others, including those such as Bruce who had helped him (Yale MSS).</note>&#x2014;&#x2014; Pray tell James to address the <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi> direct to Alick, &#x201C;Brantford, Hamilton, Upper Canada&#x201D;; I can get no good of it here, and there are considerable delays.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Inclosed here is a Key which will open for you the general frame of the little &#x201C;Pedestal Chest of Drawers&#x201D; which stands between the two Windows in the Drawing-room or Library room where I write. In the top Drawer of that said &#x201C;Pedestal,&#x201D; you will find either <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the Keys of the Cabinet that is in my sleeping-room closet, or at least a Key to one of the Drawers of that Cabinet which will introduce you to <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the Keys. I think the former is what you will find. But in either case you will with a little industry get access to all the Drawers of the Cabinet in this way; the Keys of <hi rend="italic">it</hi> have leather labels N<hi rend="italic">o</hi>1, N<hi rend="italic">o</hi>2 (Counting from the top): and you can open any one you like. Now of a certainty in one of these Drawers, I think perhaps in N<hi rend="italic">o</hi>2 or N<hi rend="italic">o</hi>3, you will find the two masses of D&#x2019;Ewes <hi rend="italic">Ms</hi>. very conspicuously lying: pray, pick them up for me, tie a string round them with the address of Bruce, and leave them with the Bookseller specified in his Note;&#x2014;so that this business, if it be not too much trouble for you, may be finished. Then be so kind as replace all the Keys where you found them, and return me the Master-Key; and then it will be all right. Can you do all this for me?</p>
<p><pb id="pg-20-64" n="20:64"/>I also wish you would take distinct charge of the Newspapers: nothing but confusion attends them as at present. For example they have just arrived this morning, not till now; and the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> has never either this week or last arrived at all! What I want you to do is to take charge of having them forwarded <hi rend="italic">without</hi> ever coming to me at all: The <hi rend="italic">Tablet</hi> to Dobbie, <hi rend="italic">Herald</hi> to Jamie, <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi> to Alick, <hi rend="italic">Nation</hi> to Brother John &#x26;c; you know their destinations; and as for us here, we have some half dozen newspapers daily, not one of which do I ever read,&#x2014;so that here any new arrival of that kind is superfluous. Yesterday I sent off a <hi rend="italic">Spectator</hi> to our Mother; I thought she might have got the <hi rend="italic">Examr</hi>s otherwise.</p>
<p>My sleeping powers continue limited; my idleness complete: but all else goes well. Yesterday I cantered to Titchfield<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ca. 9 mi. NW of Alverstoke.</note> and back; a delightful ride <hi rend="italic">by myself:</hi> and we dine always at half past four.&#x2014; I am to see your friend Dr Richardson, the poor Widower, who is in the Haslar Hospital here;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Richardson.

<p><salute>Ah my dear little Friend!</salute> I am so sorry for the disappointment that is awaiting you! and yet,&#x2014;should I like that you were not to feel some disappointment on finding me no longer there to welcome you back?&#x2014; Certainly not&#x2014;</p>
<p>I shall have been here a fortnight on Saturday&#x2014; How much longer we remain depends on others than me&#x2014;for <hi rend="italic">me</hi> I never can do long well in idleness&#x2014;unless indeed in the idleness of Seaforth-House which feels to be a sort of preparation for future exertion, a gathering of new strength from touching the bosom of Mother Earth&#x2014; But at Seaforth House it is not so much <hi rend="italic">idleness</hi> as <hi rend="italic">indolence</hi>&#x2014;and the difference is immense. the one is a <pb id="pg-20-65" n="20:65"/>repose for the faculties the other a <hi rend="italic">strenuous</hi> waste of them.&#x2014; M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Charles Buller is here&#x2014;no other visitor for the present besides ourselves&#x2014;</p>
<p>Lady Harriet is <hi rend="italic">perfectly</hi> kind for me and I <hi rend="italic">admire</hi> her more and more&#x2014; but do not feel to be more intimate with her&#x2014; I fear she is too <hi rend="italic">grand</hi> for ever letting herself be <hi rend="italic">loved</hi>&#x2014;at least by an Insignificancy like me,&#x2014;I <hi rend="italic">could</hi> love her immensely if she looked to care for it&#x2014;</p>
<p>I have a very stupefying headach today and afraid of having to betake myself to bed but I would in the first place send you this scrap that you might have some shadow of a welcome from me on your return&#x2014;</p>
<p>By and by I shall be back and <hi rend="italic">then!</hi></p>

<salute>Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I am glad you found the D&#x2019;Ewes <hi rend="italic">Ms</hi>. and sent it off to Bruce. I have this day written to him to say that it is coming. You did not send me the Key back by that Letter; but doubtless you have it lying ready for being sent.</p>
<p>We live here in the most complete state of Donothingism that I have ever in my life had experience of. The day goes along in consulting how the day shall go. For most part I snatch an effectual ride upon my strong horse out of the whirlpool; I read a little German with the Lady after Dinner; listen to some music, to much witty talk;&#x2014;and that is all. I seem to improve in health a little; but still do not sleep: the habit of utter <hi rend="italic">idleness</hi>, getting possession of me, is very strange! How long we shall be able to stand such a regimen is not yet made out:&#x2014;one would think not <hi rend="italic">very</hi> long! The prospect of such a thing <hi rend="italic">for life</hi> were absolutely equal to death! Meantime it cannot but be said to be pleasant enough, and perhaps not useless, for a season.</p>
<p>Here is a Letter from Scott,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A. J. Scott.</note> which you can return to me. We have got a Copy of the <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> here; Mr Baring bought it in a shop: it looks well enough. And <hi rend="italic">now</hi> that Business, one may hope, <hi rend="italic">has</hi> ended. I am much pleased with Scott&#x2019;s approval of me, which has a sincere air. But on the whole, all that department of the thing is grown surprisingly small to me: not momentous, one way or the other.</p>
<p>Buller is going to Town tomorrow; to return on Wednesday or Thursday. My Tobacco is done; my Fusees not far from done. Would you therefore go <pb id="pg-20-66" n="20:66"/>to our old Tobacco-shop; get me two quarter-pounds of Returns, and a groat&#x2019;s worth of <foreign>fusees</foreign>; and leave them addressed to me at Buller&#x2019;s, 2. Chester Place. Do, and help me. Tuesday Ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi> will be safest.</p>
<p>&#x2014;Will you also take this Rate-paper, and pay the &#xa3;2. 0. 6 for me. Keep a true List of all those outlays, and we will settle it punctually by and by.</p>
<p>They want me &#x201C;instantly&#x201D; to go and ride! <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign> dear Brother. Your aff<hi rend="italic">e</hi></salute></closer></p>

</bibl><sourceNote>TC-JLS, <date when="1845-12-04">4 Dec.</date> Addr: 37. Mecklenburgh Square / London. MS: NLS 23167. Hitherto unpbd. John Langton Sanford (<date when="1824-00-00">1824</date>&#x2013;<date when="1877-00-00">77</date>; <ref target="volume-20/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/24655"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), law student, later a historian; joint ed. of the unitarian <hi rend="italic">Inquirer</hi>, <date when="1852-00-00">1852</date>&#x2013;<date when="1855-00-00">55</date>; wrote for the <hi rend="italic">Spectator</hi>, <date when="1861-00-00">1861</date>&#x2013;<date when="1877-00-00">77</date>. His contributions to TC&#x2019;s revision of <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> are remarkable, though barely acknowledged. Already, at the age of twenty-one, he had found in only two years&#x2019; study more letters than TC; see his <hi rend="italic">Studies</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Illustrations of the Great Rebellion</hi> (<date when="1858-00-00">1858</date>) iii&#x2013;vi. Apparently he obtained an early copy of <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi>, since he wrote TC, in a letter dated &#x201C;<date when="1845-10-02">2<hi rend="italic">nd</hi> October</date>,&#x201D; to say: &#x201C;Although personally a stranger to you, I hope you will think the circumstances of the case warrant me in intruding on you on the present occasion.&#x201D; He had been interested &#x201C;for some time&#x201D; in the civil war and Cromwell, and &#x201C;had collected together as many of his letters as I could, in order to draw some surer conclusions regarding his conduct than I had been able to obtain otherwise. The publication of your late work has led me again to the subject, &#x26; I find upon a comparison that while your volumes contain about 24 letters which are new to me, they do not contain about 70 which I have perused. My sources of information are so limited and commonplace, that I was led to think that you must have had some particular reason for this omission, but in one or two instances at least I can hardly think that this is the case; and if you would be so kind as to let me know whether the others were intentionally omitted I would feel much obliged. The first of Cromwell&#x2019;s letters to Mr Henry Downhall (<date when="1626-10-14">Oct. 14<hi rend="italic">th</hi> 1626</date>) the MS of which you allude to is printed at length in Mr. Forster&#x2019;s Statesmen (Vol. IV, p. 40). There is also one to Mr. Hitch of Ely [<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 6:179] printed &#x2026; in a number of the Gentleman&#x2019;s Magazine&#x2014;being given from the person in whose possession it then was.&#x201D; He mentioned the joint letter from Cromwell and John Lowry and the accompanying &#x201C;Protestation&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 9:212&#x2013;15) and said further: &#x201C;As I possess a list should it be of any use to you I shall be most happy to forward the same.&#x201D; He could not resist referring to letters to Oliver St. John, the Committee at Derby House, and William Lenthall (see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 6:168&#x2013;69, 203&#x2013;5, and 7:293&#x2013;94), hoping that he was not exposing himself &#x201C;to the imputation of impertinence towards one so much better acquainted with the subject than myself.&#x201D; Adding that the letter of Thomas Knyvett (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 6:246) could now be correctly dated, he closed: &#x201C;Perhaps you will excuse the liberty which I have thus taken, &#x26; attribute it to the Zeal in a good cause of a young student of history.&#x201D;</sourceNote><head>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I did not, in my Book about Cromwell, wilfully omit any Letter of his that was known to me as genuine, and seemed to have the smallest significance: but of course, I had to hope and anticipate that the appearance of the Book itself would bring me tidings of various others which had not before turned up for me, or been noted at the moment when they <pb id="pg-20-67" n="20:67"/>did turn up.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Replying courteously and perhaps with some anxiety, TC continued to maintain good relations with Sanford. After the evident delay in this reply, Sanford sent several letters, which included long lists and transcripts that TC annotated and used. Replying, <date when="1845-12-22">22 Dec.</date>, to a letter from TC now lost, Sanford said that the &#x201C;most convenient form&#x201D; in which he could comment on the new work would be &#x201C;a running Commentary &#x2026; solely with respect to the Condition of the Letters &#x26; the Completeness as a Collection&#x201D;; he sent seven pages, adding that &#x201C;these thirty-eight Letters complete my additions to your first Volume.&#x201D; Additions to the second volume soon followed. Sanford wrote, <date when="1846-01-09">9 Jan. 1846</date>, to send &#x201C;various readings&#x201D; from his own copies and his own British Museum library slip for Cromwell&#x2019;s long &#x201C;Declaration &#x2026; for the Undeceiving of Deluded and Seduced People&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 7:115&#x2013;32); and ended: &#x201C;I am afraid to overburden you with useless papers and shall be glad to know what you are now most in need of for the completion of your new edition.&#x201D; He wrote, <date when="1846-01-10">10 Jan.</date>, that TC should have by then &#x201C;all my Copies of Letters omitted in yr edition,&#x201D; thus answering &#x201C;the question in your last as to what I have copied &#x2026; I should be glad to know if my Copies of the Letters which I noted as containing errors &#x2026; are of any use.&#x201D; On <date when="1846-01-15">15 Jan.</date> he sent the &#x201C;&#x2018;easy annotations&#x2019; on the 2<hi rend="italic">nd</hi> Vol of yr Collection,&#x201D; with a lengthy list of comments and page references. According to his list of recipients (Yale MSS), TC sent Sanford a copy of the <hi rend="italic">Supplement</hi> and the second, revised edition, but his prefatory acknowledgment was singularly ungracious: &#x201C;The First Edition &#x2026; has brought obliging contributions, and indications both true and fallacious, from far sources and from near; and, on the whole, has disinterred from their widespread slumber a variety of Letters not before known to me, or not before remembered by me &#x2026; They were not, in general, of much, or almost of any intrinsic importance&#x201D; and did not &#x201C;modify, in any essential particular, what had already been set down &#x2026;&#x201D; Subsequent additions were to be deposited in the &#x201C;loose lumber-room&#x201D; of the appendices (v&#x2013;vii).</note> Besides your &#x201C;seventy&#x201D; all of which seem to be printed, and most of which have probably been read by me at one time or other, I have already had notice of three in Autograph, one of which I find would have been very welcome to me had it come in time.</p>
<p>My own researches on the History of Oliver have terminated for the present. However, all Letters and authentic documents concerning him, even if only confirmatory of what is already known, much more if in any point corrective of what may have been wrong-stated of him,&#x2014;all these are and will be very welcome to me. If it would not cost you too much trouble to give me an exact List of your Seventy Letters, with date and address, and precise citation of the Books they are found in, I would lay up the Document carefully, and turn it to use if I could. Many of the seventy, I think, must be <hi rend="italic">Official</hi>, and little more than <hi rend="italic">signed</hi> by Oliver: but in any case your List, if you pleased to forward it to Chelsea at your leisure, could do no harm whatever, and might to me or to some other do real good, and demand new thanks from me.</p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>This day I will write you a word, however great the whirl of <hi rend="italic">idleness</hi> about me; I meant to have done it days ago, and every day passes over without its being done,&#x2014;till this which is my Birthday arrives! I reflect with great seriousness this morning that I have lived half a hundred years. What thoughts lie in that,&#x2014;dear good Mother; thoughts that fill one&#x2019;s heart beyond speech! May God continue to be good to us; and guide us by His wisdom into the Eternities thro&#x2019; what of this Time-pilgrimage remains to us. To be well guided: it lies all there. Whether we have good <hi rend="italic">weather</hi> or bad, pleasant roads or painful, is really of no moment at all; but only if we arrive at the right mark. God be gracious to us all!&#x2014;</p>
<p>We continue here, in a state of <hi rend="italic">perfect</hi> or almost perfect <hi rend="italic">Donothingism;</hi> otherwise getting on very tolerably well. Jack, I find, forwarded you the Letter I sent him; so you will know a little what kind of establishment it is. We have no fogs or frost, not very much rain; today (Thursday) is bright as summer, and I am writing in my bedroom quite warm without a fire. A fire stands ready for lighting; but I do not care to spend a <hi rend="italic">spunk</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A match tipped with sulfur.</note> on it. In the way of temperature we do exceedingly well. The people also are altogether kind, pleasant and friendly; we dine at half-past four, and I have a long ride daily: all, in fact very suitable, except that I sometimes fail of sleep a little still:&#x2014;but, alas, we are all quite <hi rend="italic">idle;</hi> that is a state that cannot suit <hi rend="italic">us</hi> very long! No day or even week is yet set for our departure; but one feels it in the distance as a thing that must be before very long!</p>
<p>Tell Jamie the Meal came all in admirable order to Chelsea; nay what is very singular the <hi rend="italic">half</hi> of it has come <hi rend="italic">hither</hi>, and is now in this house,&#x2014;excellent meal; and porridge and oatcakes have been made of it here, much approved of by the natives! The fact is they had a kind of childish curiosity after these articles of diet, after oatmeal to make them; and we made offer of this. I am sorry they got so much of it, for I perceive it will be but wasted here: however I believe there is about enough for us still at home.</p>
<p>The only other news is that your <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> must be almost at Dumfries about this time;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >She wrote to John Carlyle, <date when="1845-12-04">4 Dec.</date>: &#x201C;I am much bette in health than I have been &#x2026; tell your Brother this and thank them in my name for the little good Book they sent me&#x201D; (MS: NLS 1775A.316).</note> and you will not lose your place in it now! Here is a Letter <pb id="pg-20-69" n="20:69"/>I got from Paris about it, the other day, from one Scott of Woolwich (once Edw<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Irving&#x2019;s fellow-preacher) a good man;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably A.

Oh dear Mother, every night in these superb rooms I think of you in your poor little contented corner at Scotsbrig far off, and from my heart send blessings to you. Keep near the fire, dear Mother; you have not such weather as we. Jack sent us Isabella&#x2019;s Letter,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Carlyle also forwarded, <date when="1845-12-08">8 Dec.</date>, Isabella Carlyle&#x2019;s long letter of <date when="1845-12-04">4 Dec.</date> (with Margaret Carlyle&#x2019;s postscript) about building work at Scotsbrig and the sale of a little black pony, bought when TC was there, &#x201C;not to the satisfaction of his female friends here&#x201D; because it was &#x201C;a good runner in the gig.&#x201D;</note> we were right glad to see such proof of her improvement. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Mother.

<salute>Dear Scott,</salute>
<p>Your Letter reached me here a few days ago; and I may truly say has given me very great pleasure. That you adopt the view I have taken up about Oliver, and approve of my most ungainly ineffectual labour in regard to him, and give me your kind and hearty &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Euge</hi></foreign> [Bravo]!&#x201D; from over the water,&#x2014;this is a really precious thing to me. The first voice of approval I have heard on the matter; of a sincerity and an insight not to be doubted. I will take it as the omen that by and by many more such, nay in a certain sense at last all such, will be added; and the poor Work turn out to be actually worth something. It has been a work of infinite disgust and hopeless toil; on the whole really a kind of <hi rend="italic">pious</hi> work,&#x2014;more like a work of piety than any other I have done. So far as this <hi rend="italic">is</hi> the case, it already has its reward: and for the rest, if the practical English mind do gradually come to understand, and believe as a very fact, that it once had a Hero and Heroism in this man and his work, my poor dry-bones of a Compilation may prove to be a better &#x201C;Poem&#x201D; than many that go by that name! We will leave it with the Destinies; right glad that we, not entirely disgracefully, have got done with it,&#x2014;ungainly as it is in these bad days.</p>
<p>You ask me how I proceed in taking Notes on such occasions. I would very gladly tell you all my methods if I had any; but really I have as it were none. I go into the business with all the intelligence, patience, silence and other gifts and virtues that I have; find that ten times or a hundred times as many could be profitably expended there, and still prove insufficient: and as for plan, I find that every new business requires as it were a new scheme of operations, which amid infinite bungling and plunging unfolds itself at intervals (very scantily, after all) as I get along. The great thing is, Not to stop and break down; to know that <hi rend="italic">virtue</hi> is very indispensable, that one must not stop because new and ever new drafts upon one&#x2019;s virtue must be honoured!&#x2014; But as to the special point of taking Excerpts, I think I universally, from habit or otherwise, rather avoid <hi rend="italic">writing</hi> beyond the very minimum, mark in pencil the very smallest indication that will direct me to the thing again; and on the whole try to keep the whole matter simmering in the <hi rend="italic">living</hi> mind and memory rather than laid up in paper-bundles or otherwise laid up in the inert way. For this certainly turns out to be a truth: Only what you at last <hi rend="italic">have living</hi> in your own memory and heart is worth putting down to be printed; this alone has much chance to get into the living heart and memory of other men. And here indeed, I believe, is the <pb id="pg-20-73" n="20:73"/>essence of all the rules I have ever been able to devise for myself. I have tried various schemes of arrangement and artificial and helps to remembrance; paper-bags with labels, little paper-books, paper-bundles &#x26;c &#x26;c: but the use of such things, I take it, depends on the habits and humours of the individual&#x2014;what can be recommended universally seems to me mainly the above. My Paper-bags (filled with little scraps all in pencil) have often enough come to little for me; and indeed in general when writing, I am surrounded with a rubbish of papers that have come to little:&#x2014;this only will come to much for all of us, To keep the thing you are elaborating as much as possible actually <hi rend="italic">in</hi> your own living mind; in order that this same mind, as much awake as possible, may have a chance to make something of it!&#x2014; And so I will shut up my lumber-shop again; and wish you right good speed in yours.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Though the practice varied with each major work, this account agrees closely with what can be seen in the surviving books he used for <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi>, marked for easy reference with marginalia. These are related to &#x201C;reading notes,&#x201D; lists, and indices to the books used, such as those that survive, rarely in pencil, in the Forster MS, together with drafts usually written without close dependence on original texts. As they accumulated, they appear to have been gathered into paper folders, as with the Strouse MS drafts, most of which were pbd. in TC&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Historical Sketches</hi>. As with most of his other books, once <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> was finished, TC destroyed the final MS.</note></p>
<p>In fact it seems to me this <hi rend="italic">Life of Dante</hi>, if you were once fairly in the heart of it, would prove an excellent thing for you; the beginning of still better things; for yourself and for all of us. Can you not begin straightway to <hi rend="italic">write?</hi> There is no end to inquiring; you never know what course you will go in, till you begin to experiment: it is a <hi rend="italic">battle</hi> between the material and you.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Scott never pbd. a biography of Dante, although he lectured on him.</note> Do not aim too much at perfection; to you I believe I may give this advice. On the whole, try, try; it is all a <hi rend="italic">trial</hi>, with many failures and a few successes: &#x201C;all walking is a succession of <hi rend="italic">falls</hi>.&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. &#x201C;Sir Walter Scott,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 29:30.</note>&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>My Wife and I are here on the mild Hampshire coast on a visit to the Barings, a very strange existence for us; pleasant enough for the time;&#x2014;and utterly <hi rend="italic">idle</hi>. One wonders how a human Day is made to eat its own head off in so complete a manner! Most beautiful, most elegant, friendly; but in the long run it would be suicidal. I contrive to save a long ride out of it for my own behoof; &#x201C;a few reasonable words&#x201D; as Goethe says;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister&#x2019;s Apprenticeship, Works</hi> 23:321.</note> and at night a long spell of music, which, in the silence, brings innumerable strange old thoughts, scenes and emotions, up into the private-theatre again, to parade there, actually not much different from <hi rend="italic">spectres</hi> I think!&#x2014; This life is to last yet for an indefinite number of days.</p>
<p>My Wife sends many kind regards to you and yours. Take care of the Parisian cold; and do not be impatient that you make small progress <pb id="pg-20-74" n="20:74"/>towards health in this season. The Sun will reach his turningplace before long.</p>
<p>All hands here are rejoicing since yesternight that Peel has decided to abolish the Corn-Laws: total and immediate!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >While Peel&#x2019;s cabinet was at odds over repeal of the Corn Laws, Lord John Russell (<date when="1792-00-00">1792</date>&#x2013;<date when="1878-00-00">1878</date>; <ref target="volume-20/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/24325"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), leader of the whigs, issued, <date when="1845-11-22">22 Nov.</date>, a document, known as his &#x201C;Edinburgh Letter,&#x201D; declaring for free trade: &#x201C;Let us unite to put an end to a system which has been proved to be the blight of commerce, the bane of agriculture, the cause of penury, fever, mortality and crime among the people.&#x201D; In spite of this declaration by the opposition, Peel again attempted to persuade his cabinet to suspend the Corn Laws and summon parliament to vote on it. The <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> reported, <date when="1845-12-04">4 Dec.</date>: &#x201C;The decision of the Cabinet is no longer a secret. Parliament, it is confidently reported, is to be summoned for the first week of <date when="1846-01-00">January</date>; and the Royal Speech will &#x2026; recommend an immediate consideration of the Corn Laws, preparatory to their repeal.&#x201D; But, unable to win over his cabinet, Peel offered his resignation, <date when="1845-12-05">5 Dec.</date>, remaining prime minister till a successor could be found. Russell was unable to form a govt. Accordingly, Peel returned to office, <date when="1845-12-20">20 Dec.</date></note> There is really something brave in poor Peel. His actions point all or mostly towards truth; and his words&#x2014;we will call them <hi rend="italic">meaningless;</hi> a thing intended for the Morning Papers and the 27 million Blockheads merely.</p>

<salute>Dear Forster,</salute>
<p>You are very kind and mindful.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Forster wrote, <date when="1845-12-06">6 Dec.</date>: &#x201C;I write to vent a little mortification upon you. It is not my fault that this week&#x2019;s Examiner does not contain a proper notice of Cromwell. It is written and printed &#x2026; but, being rather lengthy, has been at the last moment thrown over by the printer for supposed want of room and other shorter things of inconceivable flatness substituted in its place.&#x201D; Forster&#x2019;s review appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, <date when="1845-12-13">13 Dec.</date>; see <ref target="volume-20/lt-18451214-JWC-JF-01">next letter</ref>.</note> I pray you do not think I expect my friends to review me when I write Books: that seems to me a most unreasonable requisition upon friends! But since you have voluntarily been so beneficent, certainly I will accept it as a bounty from the Heavens and you, whatever you may say of me;&#x2014;and to complete the matter, let me ask this other favour: A Copy of next <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, a Saturday&#x2019;s-Post Copy, directed hither; that there may be no delay about it. Our own copy for the last two weeks goes direct into Scotland to my Mother; and in this house, precisely at the same time (the wrong time for us) they have discontinued the Paper,&#x2014;being tired of its abuse of Peel, I suppose. Mind therefore: By the Saturday&#x2019;s Post. As you value the approbation of the female mind, not to speak of my own!&#x2014;</p>
<p><pb id="pg-20-75" n="20:75"/>We are leading a peculiar life here on these mild costs: kind elegant people; the beautifullest <date when="1845-12-00">December</date> weather I ever saw; a beautiful House, beautiful sea, and Isle of Wight with its ships and towns: all very &#x201C;beautiful&#x201D;; but amounting to the most perfect state of <hi rend="italic">Donothingism</hi> the mind of man could well conceive! That is the drawback of it: alas, you cannot do hard work and be quite beautiful; labour, says the Apostle, is not joyous, it is grievous!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Heb. 12:11.</note> On the whole, I suppose one&#x2019;s conscience, if nothing else, will send one home, with the tear in one&#x2019;s eye, before long. You shall hear of us then.</p>
<p>If you see Dickens, tell him I had his Note yesterday; and was very glad indeed that he had written to the brave Bamford; which I had silently hoped that he would do.&#x2014; You also, I suppose, are deep in this new Enterprise?<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Samuel Bamford (<date when="1788-00-00">1788</date>&#x2013;<date when="1872-00-00">1872</date>; <ref target="volume-20/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/1256"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), poet and former weaver; see <ref target="volume-16/lt-18430124-TC-JAC-01"><sic>16:30</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1843-01-24">24 Jan. 1843</date></corr></ref>. Evidently Dickens had asked Bamford to be one of his Manchester correspondents for the <hi rend="italic">Daily News</hi>, which was to begin publication <date when="1846-01-21">21 Jan. 1846</date>. Although one of the organizers and ed., Dickens resigned his position, <date when="1846-02-09">9 Feb.</date>, Forster taking his place.</note> Clear aim and right good speed to it and you!

<salute>Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I got your little Note last night; I now send back the Poor-rate Paper,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A notice of the parish assessment for poor relief.</note> and will request you to be so good as pay it for me,&#x2014;and be hanged to it! One is never done with &#x201C;Pay, Pay!&#x201D; I will settle everything at my return.&#x2014; Jenny&#x2019;s money was left with her in the shape of a Bank checque payable at the due time; which I think is already past.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC and John Carlyle had been paying Janet Hanning &#xa3;10 a year in two installments; &#x201C;checque&#x201D; thus in MS.</note></p>
<p>We did not go to The Grange at all; the figure of our party, always fluctuating, had already arranged itself otherwise before the Ashburtons went away. The old man too is not well either in health or spirits; considerably agitated by the late figure of Peel&#x2019;s proceedings: it was settled at last that we were not to go on this occasion. I went one day with Mr Baring to Winchester; roved about there in bitter wind-cold, some four hours; saw the School<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Winchester College is the earliest great public school in England, founded by William of Wykeham, ca. <date when="1382-00-00">1382</date>.</note> &#x26;c and then returned, a very wearied man. Indigestion and want of sleep have decided to continue constant with me while here. I think of going over, some day, to Ryde,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Isle of Wight.</note> which lies hourly in my view by day and by night: that I fancy may include all my travelling till the home-journey come. <hi rend="italic">Except</hi> for want of sleep, no quarters could be pleasanter than these: but it is a great &#x201C;exception!&#x201D;&#x2014; Dr Richardson was here waiting that day I returned from Winchester: he is a great favourite with Jane and me, and with all the rest here. [&#x2026;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The letter was probably completed in four pages, folded octavo, but the signature has been cut away so that three lines are missing here, and probably about three at the end.</note> It is questionable whether] Lord Johnny<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lord John Russell.</note> accepts the Ministry at all: my own notion all this while is that perhaps Peel will himself come back again, and do it all his own way. I shall <pb id="pg-20-78" n="20:78"/>be rather glad,&#x2014;rather; not overjoyed or enchanted at all: the controversy seems to me but a very sorry one, if we consider everything.</p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>This morning there has come to me from John a very good Letter of Alick&#x2019;s, which I have read with pleasure, and will now straightway forward to you. Poor Alick seems struggling on, not without his own difficulties, but in a very brave wholesome and manful manner. I am very glad to see him so; his outward success, good or not so good, is a small matter in comparison.&#x2014; Jack too is coming, I think; he says in his little Note to me, &#x201C;coming soon,&#x201D; if Isabella&#x2019;s answer to his queries be favourable.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-20-79" n="20:79"/>I got your Letter the morning before yesterday; I need not say how glad I was of the news. In spite of the bad weather, you are pretty well: it is a thing we have all to be thankful for. And you are busy reading <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> again, and liking what he says. There will be no danger of losing your place this time; and you will otherwise enjoy it better on a second perusal. I think, with confidence, the Book will ultimately do good; and am not sorry but glad that I spent so much labour on it. There are better times coming when Cromwell&#x2019;s work will be better understood than at present.&#x2014; I get various Letters about it; but they are not worth much. One from an American Bookseller, offering me some money for the Copyright of it in New York, did not arrive till too late.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Homan &#x26; Ellis, 295 Broadway, according to <ref target="volume-20/lt-18460103-TC-RWE-01">TC to RWE, <date when="1846-01-03">3 Jan. 1846</date></ref>. On the back of Emerson&#x2019;s letter, <date when="1845-10-30">30 Oct.</date>, TC wrote: &#x201C;1 half the profits&#x2014;10 percent on the retail price of the work. Messrs Homes &#x26; Ellis, Publishers&#x2014;295 Broadway N<hi rend="italic">w</hi> York <date when="1845-11-15">15 Nov<hi rend="italic">r</hi> 1845</date>.&#x201D;</note> Some fifty pounds or so are perhaps missed thereby; but for that I do not care,&#x2014;much <foreign><hi rend="italic">fash</hi></foreign> being also missed.</p>
<p>We are still here, as you see; still utterly idle, roving to and fro on the Coasts here; &#x201C;clatching up and down the country on <foreign>cuddy</foreign>-asses!&#x201D; But we are going home again now; tomorrow week (Friday the 26<hi rend="italic">th</hi>), it is settled that we return to Chelsea, and take to some kind of work there. Jane looks much better; I too shall find myself better, tho&#x2019; I have never rightly got into the way of sleeping yet. Our weather is altogether bright and mild, hardly any frost yet; and the people are extremely pleasant and kind. All greatly agitated about Peel, and his Corn-Laws and change of ministry, at present! The Corn-Laws are certainly to go, but there is nothing more yet certain; and that, I think, will make to great difference to any of us. Tell Jamie, when you thank him for his Letter to me, not to mind the Corn-Laws, for they will not much mind him.</p>
<p>We eat some Scotsbrig oatcake here every day; the Cook is to be taught by Jane before we go. An official man in this quarter who is grinding great quantities of Oatmeal for the Government says he will apply to me for a right Scotch Miller by and by. I think of recommending Robie of the S<hi rend="italic">atur</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Satur Mill; see <ref target="volume-13/lt-18411015-TC-JC-01"><sic>13:280</sic><corr>TC to JC, <date when="1841-10-15">15 Oct. 1841</date></corr></ref>.</note> if he do. Would Robie answer, think you; would he come if applied to&#x2014; &#x2014; I will send you a Newspaper one of these days; and then my next letter probably from Chelsea. Keep out of the cold air, dear Mother; warm by the fire; and be warm and well for all our sakes!&#x2014; Our love to Isabella and every one. <closer><salute>My blessings on you all, dear Friends. /</salute></closer> <name>T.

In the <hi rend="italic">Historical Sketches</hi>, where she is referred to several times, Alexander Carlyle quotes from what he calls &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">an unused MS. of Carlyle&#x2019;s &#x2018;Cromwell&#x2019;</hi>&#x201D; the comment that she was &#x201C;by some considered as an improper or partially improper female&#x201D; (181n).</note> and no error that I can sweep out shall have leave to continue there.</p>
<p>I do not wish to hurry you, being anxious to have the <hi rend="italic">full</hi> benefit of you: but as already hinted, the <hi rend="italic">sooner</hi> your help arrives, it will be the welcomer. For the rest, as the plan of the Book, and whole substance, temper and structure of it are already given, it is chiefly in <hi rend="italic">corrections as to fact</hi> that I am to be benefited: furthermore, if beggars might be choosers, I would solicit, as I do of all my correspondents on this matter, &#x201C;Your clearest hand and your briefest convenient style.&#x201D;&#x2014; I think there will be some forty or fifty new Letters which have turned up since I was last at the business; perhaps fifty, some one or two of which are not without importance.</p>

<salute>Dearest Babbie</salute>
<p>Your letter and the beautiful purse were a great Godsend to me on the Christmas morning&#x2014;it was my only letter&#x2014;and away there&#x2014;amongst entirely new people and new things I felt dreary to death on that day, so unlike any Christmas day that I had ever lived before; and your letter was a link between past and present that I could have ill dispensed with. On Friday I was on the road&#x2014;yesterday I rushed off immediately after breakfast, to see M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Paulet meaning to go be home in time to write you a word by yesterdays post&#x2014;but I found on reaching Hanover Street that M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Paulet had set off exactly at the same moment for Chelsea&#x2014;so I had to await her return and when I got home finally at three I was blind with headach and had to spend the rest of the day in bed&#x2014; Today I have still been in a bad way with my head&#x2014;up however and not a moment free from company till <pb id="pg-20-82" n="20:82"/>now betwixt dinner and tea that Carlyle has carried off John to smoke&#x2014; M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Paulet came after breakfast in a cab thro&#x2019; the rain&#x2014;then M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Fleming then Plattnauer <hi rend="italic">mad</hi> again&#x2014;and then old Sterling <hi rend="italic">far from sane</hi>.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sterling had written to either TC or JWC, probably from Brighton, <date when="1845-12-01">1 Dec.</date>: &#x201C;Dearest friend / I am in despair almost about our ever speaking another rational word&#x2014; The Doctors tell me I am to mend one day&#x2014;but I live in vague expectation of it&#x2014;I remember all my friends and love them&#x2014;as much as ever&#x2014;but all accuracy of mind is gone&#x2014;&#x2026; I know every one but care for few&#x2014;&#x2026; Heaven bless you.&#x201D; On the MS is written &#x201C;to TC,&#x201D; but the tone seems more suited to JWC.

<p>Carlyle is as cross as the Devil since we came back because&#x2014;they already want a new Edition of his cromwell&#x2014;the whole twelve hundred being almost sold off!!

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Returning on friday last from the Hampshire Coast, where we had been sojourning with friends for a good many weeks past, the first object that struck us in the Lobby here, was the never-failing Christmas Box from Cowbridge, safe arrived as usual! We say often, Of all our admirers you are the sensiblest; you do us always a little real benefit, and there is no hurt or loss in you whatever! That is a fact;&#x2014;and your honest modest kindness has, I hope, a proper value set on it in our estimations here. Many thanks; and may the <hi rend="italic">worst</hi> of our Christmasses be behind us!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; cf. <ref target="volume-06/lt-18311204-TC-AC-01"><sic>6:63</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1831-12-04">4 Dec. 1831</date></corr></ref>.</note> You look mournfully <pb id="pg-20-83" n="20:83"/>forward upon the Inevitable; as is my wont too: yet it beseems the Son of man to <hi rend="italic">hope</hi>. We are, I believe, in good hands. Courage!&#x2014; For the rest, this Welsh mutton is unanimously voted to be the <hi rend="italic">best</hi> the culinary memory can charge itself with, for years past. That too is a small fact to be recognised. Thanks again.</p>
<p>I find there is to be a new Edition of the Cromwell Book. A good many new Letters have come to me, or give tidings of coming; some forty or fifty I suppose; but none of much intrinsic importance; tho&#x2019; I must in some way insert the genuine of them; which operation will again involve me in confusions I thought I had got forever free of. I am once more very busy with that, and other accumulated arrears of things;&#x2014;and in much haste must end for the present.</p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Here is an ugly falsehood on the part of Wiley and Putnam in New York; to which I shall beg you to send me your explicit contradiction,&#x2014;or a clear account of how the matter was, if there was any matter. Read Mr Emerson&#x2019;s Letter,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson was still wrongly informed about the arrangement made by Chapman &#x26; Hall with Wiley &#x26; Putnam for their reprinting of <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi>, and TC himself misunderstood them; see <ref target="volume-20/lt-18451111-TC-RWE-01">TC to RWE, <sic><date when="1845-11-15">15 Nov. 1845</date></sic><corr><date when="1845-11-11">11 Nov. 1845</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-20/lt-18460103-TC-RWE-01">TC to RWE, <date when="1846-01-03">3 Jan. 1846</date></ref>. Emerson wrote <date when="1845-12-15">15 Dec.</date>: &#x201C;I have just received &#x2026; your new book &#x2026; I first heard of this parcel by your letter of <date when="1845-11-11">11 Nov.</date> which came &#x2026; a week or more ago, and announced that the book had come by the steamer leaving Liverpool <date when="1845-11-04">4 Nov<hi rend="italic">r</hi></date>. thro&#x2019; the hands of Wiley &#x26; Putnam. I wrote instantly to these men at New York, and enclosed my letter to Horace Greeley there, editor of the N.Y. Tribune, the great Whig paper, telling him the facts &#x26; bidding him receive the book of W. &#x26; P. &#x26; print it himself, &#x26; give you the best share of profit he could. This, because there was no time for the slower presses of Munroe,&#x2014;the book being in N.Y. &#x26; the next steamer to be looked for soon. Greeley went to W. and P., &#x26; wrote me that &#x2018;they decline delivering the book as they were reprinting it, having bought it in London of Chapman &#x26; Hall, &#x26; would deliver my copy as soon as they could safely do so.&#x2019; This was cool enough, I thought; &#x26; I wrote immediately to my brother William in N.Y., a lawyer, to go &#x26; demand my copy, &#x26; take such steps as to make his demand effectual. Now, before I have yet heard from him, they have got far enough on with their printing, it seems, to render up my book, &#x26; it comes with the civilest letter, saying, that not possibly can any blame attach to Mr Putnam, their agent in London, but if any wrong has been done to Mr Carlyle, the blame must attach to Chapman &#x26; Hall, his publishers, by whom this course of their printing the book (&#x26; witholding mine) was authorized. Meantime they have got a double edition forward in N.Y. one cheap 12mo the other 8vo &#x26; dearer; and, of course, will possess the American market. I am not in possession of their entire statement, for they refer to a letter which they have written to me, but which I have not received.&#x2014; I shall bethink myself how to prevent these men in future from withholding parcels addressed to me by name; And I beg you will not again employ them as carriers. Little &#x26; Brown in Boston, &#x26; also J. Munroe &#x26; Co&#x2014;best, are in correspondence with John Chapman in Newgate Street.&#x201D;</note> and you will see what I want.&#x2014; Your answer, I suppose, can <pb id="pg-20-84" n="20:84"/>be published in the New York Papers; to point out the said Wiley and Putnam there, and stamp them publicly for the hungry thievish hyaenas that they are;&#x2014;and this, I farther suppose, is all the amends we shall get of them. This, and knowing to avoid them another time!</p>
<p>Pray mention also (but on a separate scrap of paper) the name of the Montreal Bookseller, who got charge of my Canada Brother&#x2019;s copy of Cromwell:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-20/lt-18460102-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1846-01-02">2 Jan. 1846</date></ref>.</note> I have mislaid your former Note that recorded it.</p>
<p>This Fraction of a Catalogue records a late Sale (by Sotheby,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sotheby&#x2019;s, Leigh &#x26; Co., auctioneers, 3 Wellington St., Strand, center for the sale of rare books and MSS.</note> I believe) of two Letters by Oliver, as you will see. Petherham of Chancery Lane<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Petheram (<sic>d.</sic><corr><date when="1807-00-00">1807</date>&#x2013;</corr><date when="1858-00-00"><sic>18</sic>58</date>; <ref target="volume-20/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/22035"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), antiquary and publisher of 71 Chancery Lane.

I want you to inquire of Sotheby, who now has the Letters?&#x2014;and, if possible, to get me a sight of them, a copy of them with the minimum of botheration.&#x2014; I think there will be fifty or sixty new Letters in all and &#x201C;botheration&#x201D; enough with them again!</p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I find you have done an excusable but to me every unfortunate transaction. What I said, on the occasion referred to, which I well enough remember, was by no means an authorization of you to sell an edition of my Book in America or elsewhere; it was a mere private statement of my own private purpose Not to trouble my friend Emerson with editing or bargaining for me, but to send him a copy of my Book so soon as it had become possible, and to leave him to do therewith according to his own friendly pleasure. What his friendly pleasure was, and would have been, is now very evident.</p>
<p>Indisputably the &#x201C;&#xa3;10&#x201D; belong to me: and if you will read the enclosed Letter, which arrived too late for being made use of, you will see that the market-price of <foreign>Mssr.</foreign> Wiley and Putnam&#x2019;s &#x201C;two editions&#x201D; in America is liker &#xa3;100 (or more) than &#xa3;10! However, by that &#x201C;strong measure,&#x201D; they have us now in their hand.</p>
<p>I will request you to shew that Letter to the Mssr. Wiley and Putnam here; and to say from me that if they will behave like honourable men, <hi rend="italic">here</hi> is the clear market-value of the goods they have smuggled from me: let them still give me these terms offered by <foreign>Mess<hi rend="italic">rs</hi></foreign> Homan &#x26; Ellis, and I will still say, It is well. If <hi rend="italic">not</hi>, they can keep their &#xa3;10 bargain, and I will say, It is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> well!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Be so good as return me that New York Letter.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A copy of the letter in TC&#x2019;s hand (NLS 1796.66) reads: &#x201C;Be so good as return the Homs &#x26; Ellis Letter.&#x201D;</note></p>

<p>Instead of your own uncut Second Volume of <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> I think you must have got a cut and soiled one of mine. Will you be so kind as make the due exchange with me, which cannot but be beneficial to both of us, so soon as you can get out to me.

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Your Letter came duly to hand; for which, and for the energetically kind and honest sentiments conveyed in it, I return you many thanks. The same evening, the Parcels Company delivered us two copies of the beautiful pathetic little Book,&#x2014;concerning which I must feel much more than I speak at present! It is a wise pure little word;&#x2014;and will not be lost altogether, or at all. None such ever was; nor the Speaker of any such. Courage, Courage!&#x2014; Surely I will comply with your request in regard to that little Book; nay in great part have already done so,&#x2014;my Wife along with me; not without various thoughts. If it can cheer your brave Daughter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Childs had only one da., &#x201C;an exceptionally gifted and glorious creature <supplied>[who]</supplied> &#x2026; died early, leaving but one son, Mr. Crisp&#x201D; (J.

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Returning from the country a few days ago, I find your very courteous and obliging Communication lying for me here. I am much your debtor for what you have done, and for what you kindly promise to do. It will give me much pleasure, and be of real use to me at present, to possess a Copy of your <hi rend="italic">Annals of Cambridge,</hi> if you will bestow one upon me. Thanks for the List of <hi rend="italic">Cromwell Letters</hi> too. I have got another List, still longer, to which yours is partly supplemental; from various quarters various unexpected Letters shew themselves; as indeed by the nature of the case the Collection can never be <hi rend="italic">complete:</hi> however I am naturally anxious to possess as many as I possibly can; and in some way or other, even at this stage of the business, must still try to deal with them all. It was stupid enough of me to <pb id="pg-20-89" n="20:89"/>forget <hi rend="italic">Carey</hi> altogether!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henry Cary, <hi rend="italic">Memorials of the Great Civil War in England, from <date when="1646-00-00">1646</date> to <date when="1652-00-00">1652</date>,</hi> 2 vols.

TC had missed ten letters.</note> I had read the Book over, years ago; but finding it a mere torpid Darkness, had thrown it down again, and avoided it thenceforth. For which impatience I now pay my penalty.&#x2014; What of Oliver&#x2019;s Letters, there or elsewhere omitted by me, have any meaning, I must try to work up in some shape of Appendixes or otherwise. Wherein all help from the helpful shall be very welcome to me;&#x2014;and the sooner the better.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Cambridge Portfolio</hi> is not very accessible to me here; the <hi rend="italic">Baker Ms.</hi> of course not at all.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Cambridge Portfolio</hi>, ed.

And pray mention, as exactly as may be, the year of the <hi rend="italic">edition</hi>, the particulars of the Address, date, signature &#x26;c&#x2014;for example in what College the <hi rend="italic">Baker Ms.</hi> lies, and any details about the nature of it you may reckon interesting.&#x2014; All this trouble you as it were volunteer to take; and I, not without some grudge, venture to lay it upon you. With respect to t<supplied>[he]</supplied> Letters in the <hi rend="italic">Portfolio,</hi> I ought to add this: some of them (one of them <supplied>[at]</supplied> least I noticed) seem to be copied from the <hi rend="italic">Gentleman&#x2019;s Magazine</hi> and that Book is easily procurable here. Pray look in the Catalogue of it; and save yourself what trouble is avoidable.</p>
<p>In Forster&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">British Statesmen</hi> IV. 40, I have found a Copy of the Letter which I mention (Vol I. p. 81) as stolen from the <hi rend="italic">Ashmole Museum</hi>.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Forster, <hi rend="italic">Lives of the Statesmen of the Commonwealth,</hi> 5 vols.

Can you specify for me what &#x201C;Cambridge Papers lately (a dozen years ago) published&#x201D; there are? The authenticity of the Letter is unquestionable; but there ought to be exactness in the editorial details. As Downhall or Down<hi rend="italic">tell</hi> was a Cambridge Tutor, perhaps some particulars of him might still be ascertainable at Cambridge; at lowest what his real name was!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henry Downhall (d. <date when="1669-00-00">1669</date>), fellow of St. John&#x2019;s College, Cambridge, and vicar of St. Ives when Cromwell went there, <date when="1635-00-00">1635</date>; opposed puritans; see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 9:209&#x2013;10.</note>&#x2014;</p>

<p>The Book on Cromwell seems to meet with much more acceptance than could have been anticipated: it appears I am not to get free of it yet; not without a second edition, and some new inquiries.

<p>For one thing, a small question has arisen about the &#x201C;Henry Downhall, at St John&#x2019;s College, Cambridge,&#x201D; in <date when="1626-00-00">1626</date>; of whom there is mention in p. 81 vol I. of the Book on Cromwell.

Pray look, if you have opportunity, at that passage in <hi rend="italic">Forster</hi>.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Will you accept from me a very hasty Note, conveying almost nothing. I <pb id="pg-20-91" n="20:91"/>am again, and especially at this moment, very busy,&#x2014;contrary to my expectation, for I have had weeks of idleness since you last heard of me; but I did not think they were to end again so soon.</p>
<p>The essential message I have to deliver you at present is, That a Copy of the Book on Cromwell addressed to you was duly despatched (by the New York or Boston Steamer, I think) five or four weeks ago, To the Care of<lb/>
<title>Mess<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Armour and Ramsay, Booksellers,<lb/>
Montreal,&#x2014;</title><lb/>
where doubtless it is now lying; waiting that you should send for it. The <hi rend="italic">Address</hi> was the common one on your Letters. I did not write earlier to announce it, because I did not know <hi rend="italic">how</hi> the Booksellers were to contrive sending it,&#x2014;not till after the last Packet had sailed. I do not know if this is a good way? I meant it to get to you free of expense: but the Booksellers tell me this &#x201C;Armour and Ramsay&#x201D; will very likely charge carriage for it, and may even keep it till they see clearly how they are to be paid. The carriage of such a bulk, by way of separate Parcel, might come to 10 or 15 shillings, some say;&#x2014;which I am very sorry to hear! The selling value of the Book is but 36/,&#x2014;and probably you could get a Yankee Copy <hi rend="italic">cheaper</hi> than the carriage (for they have already pirated two editions from me, I hear<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson wrote TC, <date when="1845-12-15">15 Dec. 1845</date>, that Wiley &#x26; Putnam had brought out two edns.&#x2014; &#x201C;one cheap 12 mo and the other 8vo &#x26; dearer,&#x201D; apparently costing 50&#x26;cent; and $1.00. Dyer 64 seems to confirm this; Tarr 112 does not. See also <ref target="volume-20/lt-18451229-TC-EC-01">TC to EC, <date when="1845-12-29">29 Dec. 1845</date></ref>. The situation is uncertain.</note>): on the whole, you must do what you find desirable; and I shall be very glad if you get that small memorial of my love to you, on any moderate terms.</p>
<p>John has told you, there is to be a new edition of the Book; for, contrary to all human expectation, it proves rather popular here! A new edition with improvements, with a good many <hi rend="italic">new</hi> Letters &#x26;c that have turned up in consequence of the first edition:&#x2014;I am extremely busy once more, endeavouring to gather these, and see what I am to do with them. Of this new edition also you shall have a Copy, and I will try to send it by some better conveyance. I dislike the work I am again upon very much;&#x2014;yet surely ought not to grudge that I am set upon it!&#x2014;</p>
<p>John has pretty fully told you all our important news here; especially the good accounts from Annandale, for which you will be as we are very thankful. Newspapers will teach you what Political changes are afloat,&#x2014; promised abrogation of the Corn-Laws &#x26;c. For indeed there is little other than a prospect of famine in various quarters of this Kingdom at present. The Potatoes seem totally ruined; either rotted, or else irretrievably rotting. They are at 4 for three half-pence in Chelsea at present, near a halfpenny apiece! And even at that price they are next to uneatable; the rot <pb id="pg-20-92" n="20:92"/>in them all. Judge what Ireland will be! Happily there are capital wages in Scotland (owing to railway work) and plenty of employment. Our weather too is very mild.</p>
<p>Jane and I have been almost six weeks away, living with &#x201C;great people,&#x201D; very friendly to us, down in Hampshire. It did not suit us too well, that totally <hi rend="italic">idle</hi> life, beset with <hi rend="italic">flunkies</hi> at every hand; but the people too <hi rend="italic">were</hi> very good and friendly;&#x2014;they are the Lord Ashburton people (the Son and his Wife). It struck us with an almost sacred feeling to read your last brave toilsome manful Letter in that grand idle drawingroom of theirs!&#x2014; <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign> my brave Brother: may God&#x2019;s blessing be with you all.</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Emerson,</salute>
<p>I received your Letter by the last Packet three or four days ago:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1845-12-15">15 Dec. 1845</date>.</note> this is the last day of answering, the monthly Packet sails towards you again from Liverpool tomorrow morning; and I am in great pressure with many writings, elsewhither and thither: therefore I must be very brief. I have just written to Mr Hart of Philadelphia; his Draft (as I judge clearly by the Banker&#x2019;s speech and silence) is accepted, all right; and in fact, means <hi rend="italic">money</hi> at this time: for which I have written to thank him heartily. Do you <pb id="pg-20-93" n="20:93"/>very heartily thank Mr Furness for me;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Henry Furness (<date when="1802-00-00">1802</date>&#x2013;<date when="1896-00-00">96</date>), unitarian clergyman of Philadelphia, Emerson&#x2019;s friend since schooldays, whose chief interests were abolition and the life of Christ. He was largely responsible for negotiating TC&#x2019;s publishing arrangements with Carey &#x26; Hart; see Slater, <hi rend="italic">CEC</hi> 374, 381, 383. TC&#x2019;s devoted admirer since the appearance of <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi>, he was always eager to read TC&#x2019;s letters to Emerson; see <hi rend="italic">Records of a Lifelong Friendship</hi>, ed. H. H. Furness (New York and Boston, <date when="1910-00-00">1910</date>).</note>&#x2014;Furness and various friends, as Transatlantic matters now are, must accept a <hi rend="italic">silent</hi> gratitude from me. The speech of men and American hero-worshippers is grown such a babblement: in very truth, <hi rend="italic">silence</hi> is the thing that chiefly has meaning,&#x2014;there or here. Another Letter was in answer to a certain New York Bookselling House, &#x201C;Homan and Ellis, 295. Broadway,&#x201D; if I read it right;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-20/lt-18451218-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1845-12-08">18 Dec. 1845</date></ref>, and <ref target="volume-20/lt-18451231-TC-EC-01">TC to EC, <date when="1845-12-31">31 Dec. 1845</date></ref>.</note> who, quite too late, made offer to me for an edition of the Cromwell Book,&#x2014;plundered without &#x201C;offer&#x201D; by our vulpine friends <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;Wily</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Put-on-him!&#x201D;</hi><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Wiley &#x26; Putnam; see <ref target="volume-20/lt-18451229-TC-EC-01">TC to EC, <date when="1845-12-29">29 Dec. 1845</date></ref>.</note> Of whom now a word.</p>
<p>My Friend, I am grieved to see your vexation; and, according to this Broadway Offer just mentioned, it may be a loss of some &#xa3;90 or &#xa3;100, this trick of the Wilies: but otherwise it is not of any consequence at all,&#x2014;nor, in that way either, is it properly of any consequence. I did, however, write instantly to Chapman and Hall, giving them a sight of your Letter, and requiring from them an instant distinct contradiction of the Wiley statement, &#x201C;That Chapman and Hall had given liberty&#x201D; &#x26;c.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson wrote TC, <date when="1845-12-15">15 Dec. 1845</date>, of receiving a letter from Wiley &#x26; Putnam stating that &#x201C;if any wrong has been done to Mr Carlyle, the blame must attach to Chapman &#x26; Hall, &#x2026; by whom this course of their printing the book &#x2026; was authorized&#x201D;; see <ref target="volume-20/lt-18451229-TC-EC-01">TC to EC, <date when="1845-12-29">29 Dec. 1845</date></ref>.</note> The answer to this comes out rather <hi rend="italic">in favour</hi> of the Wiley and Putnam, whose procedure seemed very like highway robbery at first; wherefore it is right that I should put you in possession of it.</p>
<p>Just before the sailing of the Nov<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Packet, the Book being now quite completed, and the engraving<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Francis Holl&#x2019;s frontispiece.</note> on the way towards completion, I hastily called on Chapman; wrote your name on a Sheet of Paper, and directed him to have a Copy bound for you with that autograph in it; and to despatch the same by the Packet about to sail. Chapman suggested that &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">un</hi>bound, the Book would do as well <hi rend="italic">for reprinting?</hi>&#x201D; I said hastily, &#x201C;I do not wish to bother him with that; bind it!&#x201D; Cursory words; which poor Chapman interpreted to mean that the American Edition of my Book was a thing thrown out into the streets, lying disowned there like a yellow cabbage-leaf,&#x2014;which <hi rend="italic">he,</hi> therefore, might pick up, and sell for a penny if he could in a private way! Accordingly he goes across to Wiley here, or Wiley comes across to him,&#x2014;in short he gives Wiley another Copy of the Book for his <pb id="pg-20-94" n="20:94"/>New York friends (with instruction that they need not <hi rend="italic">hasten</hi> your Copy of it,&#x2014;which was rather a bold stroke of his,&#x2014;but with no Authority, as he avers, to <hi rend="italic">retain</hi> it when demanded); and for this service receives the reward of &#xa3;10, and buttons the same into his pocket nothing doubting. Such is his Official Narrative, a very penitent Piece wherein he eagerly restores to me the buttoned &#xa3;10, and really seems very sorry for himself, poor greedy creature. Nay I may as well inclose it for you, and then so far you will have the case before you.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >This letter cleared up the earlier muddle and misunderstanding. Emerson was so convinced that the mistake was not Wiley &#x26; Putnam&#x2019;s that he wrote them, <date when="1846-01-27">27 Jan.</date>: &#x201C;I am very happy to see that Mr Putnam has acted quite correctly in the affair.&#x201D; To his brother William he wrote, <date when="1846-01-29">29 Jan.</date>, that Putnam was &#x201C;quite guiltless&#x201D; in this matter that had put him to much unnecessary trouble (Rusk 3:324&#x2013;25).</note></p>
<p>In reply to that Note I have signified to Chapman how <hi rend="italic">he</hi> commercially stood in selling that waste article, too rashly judged to be thrown into the street; that I did <hi rend="italic">not</hi> throw it into the street, but into the hands of R. W. E. to do unbiassed his own friendly pleasure with it,&#x2014;which pleasure, and the calculable results thereof, have now become very evident! For I enclose him the Homan &#x26; Ellis Letter, offering me (I think) &#x201C;Half-profits, or the Tenth part of the retail-price at once,&#x201D; for an Edition: and I bid the poor man go over to his Wileys here, shew them these terms, say These are very clear due from them: are they ready as honourable men to give me these? If <hi rend="italic">so,</hi> it shall still be well: if <hi rend="italic">not,</hi>&#x2014;they may go to&#x2014;a Certain Person, and it shall not be well!</p>
<p>Was not here a magnanimous proceeding; looking for grace from a graceless face? I despatched that Note, two days ago; expecting of course no answer but &#x201C;Hum-m-ha!&#x201D;&#x2014;but as yet I have not even got that; and it rejoices my mind to think that I have the dogs in a kind of fix! Enough of them: let us not waste another syllable upon them, now or henceforth, the wretched hungerstruck hyaenas that they are.</p>
<p>To my very great astonishment, the Book <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> proves popular here; and there is to be another edition very soon. Edition with improvements&#x2014;for some 50 or so of new (not <hi rend="italic">all</hi> insignificant) Letters have turned up, and I must try to do something rational with these;&#x2014;with which painful operation I am again busy. It will make the two volumes about <hi rend="italic">equal</hi> perhaps,&#x2014;which will be one benefit! If any American possibility lie in this, I will take better care of it.&#x2014;&#x2014; &#x2014; Alas, I have not got one word with you yet! Tell me of your Lectures;&#x2014;of all things</p>
<closer><salute>Ever yours</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name>
<ps><p>We returned from Hampshire exactly a week ago; never passed six so totally idle weeks in our lives.&#x2014; Better in health a little? Perhaps.</p></ps>

<salute>Dear Jean,</salute>
<p>We came home about a week ago; so you can now direct the poor <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi> hither again: the <hi rend="italic">two strokes</hi> on the back of it will at least be welcome to me!</p>
<p>We had six very idle weeks down in Hampshire yonder;&#x2014;the <hi rend="italic">idlest</hi> I can remember of my Life; really nothing done at all, day after day, except dress, talk, eat and sleep (the <hi rend="italic">latter,</hi> alas, rather imperfectly in my case!),&#x2014; with flunkies running about you, and superfluous accommodations, at all hours! However the place was beautiful, the people were beautiful, and the climate:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >About this time TC remarked: &#x201C;The English aristocracy seem to me to be wasting some of them very fine faculties &#x26; active intelligencies in the sole pursuit of living a handsome zero-life of diversion &#x2018;<foreign>de jour en jour</foreign>&#x2019; &#x26; being graceful &#x26; easy in their deportment to one another&#x201D; (Ian Campbell, &#x201C;More Conversations with Carlyle: the Monckton Milnes Diaries, Part 2,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Prose Studies</hi> 9 [<date when="1986-00-00">1986</date>]:24).</note> and here we are again, safe thro&#x2019; it all; safe, or even perhaps slightly improved in some particulars.</p>
<p>I expected some composure here, and no great press of business; but am again obliged to fall to work, full tilt. Contrary to all expectation the Book on <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> proves <hi rend="italic">popular;</hi> there is to be a new Edition of it before long! New Letters &#x26;c have turned up for me, which tho&#x2019; of no great importance intrinsically, I am loth to omit: so, once more, I am obliged to duck into those horrid quagmires from which I had fancied myself forever escaped,&#x2014; and am again making a considerable &#x201C;<foreign>swatter</foreign> [untidy heap]&#x201D; there! Happily it will not be long till the brunt of this second bout is over; and, at any rate (for there is nothing essential to be changed), I can make it as short as I like. Nobody has a right to <hi rend="italic">complain</hi> that a Second edition of his Book is needed! It means more cash to him, among other things.&#x2014; Considerable reviewing of the Book goes on; very little of which do I see, no jot of it seek after. Here, in that <hi rend="italic">Nation</hi> Newspaper which I send you today, is some balderdash of O&#x2019;Connell&#x2019;s on the subject:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >At the weekly meeting of the Repeal Assoc., <date when="1845-12-21">21 Dec. 1845</date>, the <hi rend="italic">Nation</hi> reported, <date when="1845-12-27">27 Dec.</date>, O&#x2019;Connell attacked TC&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> as by an author &#x201C;remarkable for writing a species of broken German, as harsh-sounding and grating on the ear as the pounding of blue-stones for the repairs of roads. Thus Dr. Carlyle, in a chapter headed &#x2018;Irish Wars,&#x2019; speaking of Cromwell, says&#x2014;&#x201C;They rejected his summons and terms at Tredah; he stormed the place, and according to his promise, put every man of the garrison to death.&#x2019; And, further on this writer says&#x2014;&#x2018;But let us take the letters themselves, and read them with various emotions, in which wonder will not fail. What a rage, wide-sweeping, inexorable as death, dwells in that heart&#x2014; close neighbour to pity, to trembling affection and soft tears! &#x2026; To our Irish friends we ought to say, likewise, that this garrison of Tredah consisted mostly of Englishmen. Perfectly certain this; and, therefore, let &#x201C;the bloody hoof of the Saxon,&#x201D; &#x26;c., forbear to continue itself on that matter.&#x2019;&#x201D; O&#x2019;Connell then quoted passages from the Rev. John Nalson, <hi rend="italic">An Impartial Collection of the Great Affairs of State</hi>, 2 vols. (<date when="1683-00-00">1683</date>), &#x201C;vol. II. (Introduction), p. vii&#x201D;: &#x201C;I have heard a relation of my own, who was captain in that service, relate that no manner of compassion or discrimination was showed either to age or sex; but that little children were promiscuously sufferers with the guilty; and that if any who had some grains of compassion reprehended the soldiers for this unchristian inhumanity, they would scoffingly reply, &#x2018;Why? Nits will be lice!&#x2019; and so would despatch them.&#x201D; O&#x2019;Connell also quoted Thomas Carte (2:84) on the Drogheda slaughter, who said that Cromwell&#x2019;s troops did offer the defenders quarter, but that finally Cromwell gave orders that none should be given. He also cited the Marquess of Ormonde&#x2019;s subsequent protests and the historian John Lingard, who followed Carte in saying that not only was the acceptance of quarter violated but that &#x201C;one thousand unresisting victims were immolated together within the walls of the Great Church, whither thay had fled for protection.&#x201D; Finally, O&#x2019;Connell declared: &#x201C;I tell Mr. Carlyle that the inhabitants of Drogheda were massacred as well as the soldiery&#x201D; and that the House of Commons approved Cromwell&#x2019;s action &#x201C;in slaughtering the Irish.&#x201D; The authorities quoted were John Nalson (<date when="1638-00-00">1638</date>?&#x2013;<date when="1686-00-00">86</date>), English royalist historian and pamphleteer; Thomas Carte (<date when="1686-00-00">1686</date>&#x2013;<date when="1754-00-00">1754</date>), English Jacobite historian, author of <hi rend="italic">A History of the Life of James, Duke of Ormonde</hi>, 2 vols.

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I find the Second Edition of the Book on <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> is to go on much sooner than I expected; in fact it has become necessary for me to set the Printers to work without delay,&#x2014;and of course, as an indispensable preliminary, to have before me a complete Collection of all the new Letters &#x26;c which are to be introduced.</p>

<p>I. In the Letter to Mr Hand of Ely (O.C.&#x2019;s Memoirs 4<hi rend="italic">0</hi> p. 230), there is reference made to a kind of Charitable Institution at Ely called <hi rend="italic">Feoffees Fund</hi>, and in the page preceding the Letter an Extract is given from the Books of that Institution,&#x2014;which seem still extant?<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Hand was a gov. of Parsons&#x2019; Charity fund of Ely, a continuation of the &#x201C;Feoffees&#x2019; Fund.&#x201D; For Cromwell&#x2019;s letter to Hand, <date when="1638-09-13">13 Sept. 1638</date>, see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 9:210&#x2013;12.</note> If so I should like well to have it the Extract dated, as of course in the original it is likely to be. Farther, What has become of that Feoffees Fund? Is it still extant in any shape; or when did it disappear? Do the Books specify Mr Hand as Acting Secretary of it; or is any other notice discoverable of Mr Hand?&#x2014;&#x2014; I have not the advantage to know directly any intelligent person in Ely, to whom these queries could be addressed; but as you are comparatively a neighbour to that City, perhaps it might be in your power so far to help me.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cooper lived in Cambridge, 16 mi. from Ely.

<p>2. In the Letter of Cromwell and Lowry to the Cambridge Corporation (Cromwell, 226) there is no date given; and moreover in the date &#x201C;<date when="1641-05-11"><hi rend="italic">May</hi> 11, 1641</date>&#x201D; which stands as the day of <hi rend="italic">reading</hi> the Letter, I find some questionability: it is the day before Strafford&#x2019;s Execution; and I do not at present remember any &#x201C;Protestation&#x201D; going on precisely at that time: in a word, I should like well to know that it <hi rend="italic">is</hi> indisputably &#x201C;<date when="1846-05-00">May</date>&#x201D; in the Cambridge Town Books;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Lowry (d. <date when="1669-00-00">1669</date>), chandler and common councillor of Cambridge, M.P. for Cambridge, <date when="1640-00-00">1640</date>&#x2013;<date when="1653-00-00">53</date>.

<p>3. Can you inform me Whether, in the Town Books, or elsewhere, there is any trace of the &#x201C;Cambridge Committee&#x201D;; General Committee for the Eastern Association; which I find had its seat habitually there?&#x2014; In a recently discovered Letter of Oliver&#x2019;s (printed, with one word wrong &#x201C;feudall&#x201D; for &#x201C;several,&#x201D; in the <hi rend="italic">Athenaeum</hi> of 13 Dee<hi rend="italic">r</hi> last) addressed to the &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Ely</hi> Committee&#x201D; I find that, to make sense, we must suppose the Ely <pb id="pg-20-99" n="20:99"/>Committee sitting at Cambridge too,&#x2014;which I do not yet clearly know otherwise that it did.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cromwell&#x2019;s letter of <date when="1644-09-01">1 Sept. 1644</date> was printed in the <hi rend="italic">Athenaeum</hi>, <date when="1845-12-13">13 Dec. 1845</date>, and later edns. of <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi>, with the note that &#x201C;The Committee for the Isle of Ely,&#x201D; to whom the letter was addressed, consisted of M.P.s &#x201C;connected with that region, and has its sittings in London&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 6:190&#x2013;91). The Eastern Association was an assoc. of counties formed, <date when="1642-00-00">1642</date>, for defense against the royalists; it consisted of Norfolk, Suffolk, Essex, Cambridgeshire, and Herts. (see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 6:128).</note> Nor indeed most likely will it prove very discoverable now!&#x2014;</p>
<p>In regard to the <hi rend="italic">Second</hi> of these queries I find prospect of some elucidation from your <hi rend="italic">Cambridge Annals</hi> itself: in regard to the others I will beg you not to take more trouble than enough, or indeed any inconvenience trouble at all; and shall with real thankfulness accept whatever you can give me.&#x2014; Perhaps, if you do not forbid, there may be other questions to apply to you upon. <closer><salute>For the present I have done; and remain (in much haste)</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I did not mean to hurry you; but it seems we are just going to Press again with this Book on Cromwell: wherefore if you have any emendations for me on the first portions of the business, I will ask you to send them straightway, or to get them ready for me so soon as your convenience will serve.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-20/lt-18451228-TC-DL-01">TC to DL, <date when="1845-12-28">28 Dec. 1845</date></ref>. This letter seems to be a response to Laing&#x2019;s reply to the earlier letter.</note> In about another week the Printer may probably be at work again:&#x2014; but he will not reach the Scotch Part (where I principally expect you) for a good many weeks yet. Do what you can for me.</p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I am very much obliged by your kind attention to my wants,&#x2014;your valuable Parcel of Books with your lucid Copies and Comments, which arrived on Saturday; your new Letter which arrived this morning.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cooper wrote from Cambridge, <date when="1846-01-09">9 Jan.</date>: &#x201C;I am gratified to learn that your new edition is called for so soon&#x201D; and &#x201C;herewith forwarded&#x201D; the <hi rend="italic">Annals of Cambridge</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">Cambridge Portfolio</hi>, vol. 2, the &#x201C;Report on Cambridgeshire Charities (being part of the 37<hi rend="italic">th</hi> Vol. of Commissioners Reports on Charities),&#x201D; &#x201C;Transcripts of the Letters in Mss Baker,&#x201D; along with &#x201C;other transcripts &#x26; notes with reference to your various inquiries,&#x201D; and &#x201C;Corrections of the First Edition with Hints &#x26;c.&#x201D; He apologized for sending an unbound and used copy of the <hi rend="italic">Annals</hi>, and assured TC that he had already written to Dr. Peacock &#x201C;about the Letter to Mr. Hand.&#x201D; Finally, &#x201C;I shall be at the British Museum on Wednesday or Thursday &#x26; shall perhaps be enabled to clear up the obscurity respecting the Letter to Downhall or Downholme who I dare say little thought in <date when="1636-00-00">1636</date> that two centuries afterward that letter would be the subject of doubt and enquiry.&#x201D;</note></p>
<p><pb id="pg-20-100" n="20:100"/>By and by, most probably, I shall have various new inquiries to trouble you with, if your patience will hold out: but for the present I will restrict myself, being in great haste, to the request of one other favour: It is that you would if possible procure me a <hi rend="italic">Copy</hi> of that Letter of Lord Willoughby&#x2019;s to which you refer, as to a thing known, at p. 354 vol III of your <hi rend="italic">Annals</hi>. Cromwell&#x2019;s brief Letter, given by you in the next page, is one of the best I have. I have just been copying it; and shall much want the Enclosure too, if any way procurable.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The enclosure was the letter to Cromwell of <date when="1643-08-05">5 Aug. 1643</date> from Francis Willoughby (<date when="1613-00-00">1613?</date>&#x2013;<date when="1666-00-00">66</date>), 5th Baron Willoughby of Parham, parliamentary commander, which Cromwell sent with his letter of <date when="1643-08-06">6 Aug. 1643</date> to the commissioners at Cambridge. TC&#x2019;s note indicates that his source is the Baker MSS at Trinity; see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 6:159&#x2013;60.</note>. As you are just on the way to Town, I will not interrupt your other affairs with this extraneous one, till you return; but once at leisure again, pray do not neglect to make an effort for me. I hope the Baker <hi rend="italic">Mss</hi> have it. I have not yet had time to study your account of that Repository, what part of it may be in Cambridge, and what in London: and indeed this night, the instant I have got Cromwell&#x2019;s own Letters extracted, I shall send your Book off to be bound, that I may consult it more freely in future; which promises to be a very useful step for me. The <hi rend="italic">Portfolio</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Charities</hi> Book shall be punctually returned.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Cambridge Portfolio</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Report of the Commissioners Concerning Charities</hi> (<date when="1837-00-00">1837</date>).</note></p>

<p>I am much obliged by your discovery of Downhall for me. If you could, <pb id="pg-20-101" n="20:101"/>when you are writing on some other occasion, mention the Volume &#x26;c of the Baker Mss from which your information is derived, and also the Authority for that Archdeaconry of Huntingdon (curious if indubitable,&#x2014; Downhall must at least have been 74 then?)&#x2014;it would handsomely finish off this part of the business.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-20/lt-18460101-TC-JL-01">TC to JL, <date when="1846-01-01">1 Jan.</date></ref>, and <ref target="volume-20/lt-18460101-TC-CHC-01">TC to CHC, <date when="1846-01-01">1 Jan.</date></ref></note></p>

I shall not however go &#x2026; ; and as your proof-sheets are come, I send them back as well corrected as could by word of mouth.&#x201D; He thought TC should add &#x201C;some more graphic sketch of Naseby battle,&#x201D; and enclosed notes TC had sent him, <date when="1842-09-18">18 Sept. 1842</date> (see <ref target="volume-15/lt-18420918-TC-TCNBN-01"><sic>15:92&#x2013;94</sic><corr>TC to TCNBN, <date when="1842-09-18">18 Sept. 1842</date></corr></ref>), a &#x201C;very good and spirit-stirring brief of the battle&#x201D; (Terhune, <hi rend="italic">LEF</hi> 1:520). In a letter of late <date when="1846-01-00">Jan.</date> he admonished TC: &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Do</hi> put in the sketch of the Battle; you see you <hi rend="italic">must</hi> alter your present account. Stick in an appendix, if the printer cannot nudge in an extra page.&#x201D; Further, he reminded TC that he had sent him in <date when="1842-00-00">1842</date> (see <ref target="volume-15/lt-18420924-TC-EF-01"><sic>15:101</sic><corr>TC to EF, <date when="1842-09-24">24 Sept. 1842</date></corr></ref>&#x2013;2 and Terhune, <hi rend="italic">LEF</hi> 1:353) a sketch showing the location of the graves (Terhune, <hi rend="italic">LEF</hi> 1:517&#x2013;18). TC added his &#x201C;sketch&#x201D; in Appendix 8, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 9:229&#x2013;31.</note> and as you are, in small matters and in great, a friend to light and correctness, and an enemy to darkness and error,&#x2014;I will bid you rectify the phraseology in that bit of printing till, if it cannot convey the right impression, it at least convey no wrong one to the uninstructed reader. There!&#x2014; &#x2014; And as the Printer is coming on, you may as well lose no time about it. For the rest, as I have another Copy of the Leaves here, do not mind how you blot these,&#x2014; correct them at large, and at your ease (explaining to <hi rend="italic">me</hi> what you mean): I will adopt what of your suggestions is adoptable, and send it to the Printer in my own shape, on a diff<hi rend="italic">t</hi> paper.</p>
<p>These &#x2018;new Letters&#x2019; and botherations are really very distressing to me: <pb id="pg-20-103" n="20:103"/>intrinsically hardly of any importance;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Among them was one about a Cromwell letter in the &#x201C;Rawdon Papers (London, <date when="1819-00-00">1819</date>), p. 408,&#x201D; sent from Cambridge, <date when="1846-01-04">4 Jan.</date>, by a S.

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I am about to do what to another kind of man than you I should myself <pb id="pg-20-104" n="20:104"/>regard as a very strange thing: I am sending you the &#x201C;Curse of Cromwell&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Traditional Irish expression for Cromwell&#x2019;s conquest of Ireland; used here as to mean TC&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi>.</note> to get it <hi rend="italic">improved</hi> for me! The case is, I am very busy preparing a second edition of that Book; and am anxious, this being the last time that I mean to touch it, to avoid as many errors as may be avoidable. In the Irish part of the business I could not, after considerable search and endeavour, procure any tolerable Irish Atlas; and in spelling out the dreadful old Newspaper Letters from that scene, which are nearly indecipherable sometimes, I felt now and then my footing by no means secure. Other errors there may be which an intelligent punctual man, acquainted with the localities, might put me on the way of rectifying; but these of the Names of Places and such like he could himself rectify. For <hi rend="italic">Geographical Corrections</hi>, I see nothing that I can do so wise as depend upon you and your help! If you cannot help me, the thing must stand as it is; for I know no other man connected with the scene to whom I can apply; and for my own share I have already, with my small means (<hi rend="italic">Frazer&#x2019;s Handbook</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Fraser, <hi rend="italic">Handbook for Travellers in Ireland</hi> (Dublin, <date when="1844-00-00">1844</date>).</note> and such like), had a toughish wrestle with it, and done pretty much what I could in the matter.</p>
<p>My chief dubieties regarded Tipperary, Waterford and that region;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >S Ireland.</note> but in all Irish regions I should like well to have help. Where you know a truehearted intelligent man on any of the scenes treated of, who will take so much trouble for a man seeking truth,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; under questionable aspect,&#x2014;if you would send him the sheet referring to his locality, and solicit for me his humane help as soon as convenient,&#x2014;certainly I should regard it as a real kindness, and good and not evil would be done by it. Error of every kind ought to be extinguished wherever one finds it; that is the mission of a human intelligence in this world!</p>
<p>Situated as I know you to be at present, it seems a shame to trouble you with such things! Accordingly, do not go farther in it than your occasions will allow; I have very specially to beg you, Not If nothing come of this my endeavour,&#x2014;I will say to myself, &#x201C;Nothing could come of it; I tried what seemed possible.&#x201D; And so I will leave it with you.</p>
<p>We read your review of <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> in the <hi rend="italic">Nation</hi> last week;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The review, <date when="1846-01-06">6 Jan.</date>, was not by Duffy, although a friend in London (evidently John O&#x2019;Hagan) had urged him to undertake it: &#x201C;I could not help plunging into the Irish parts; there is a damnable deal of truth in what he says, but I also incline to think considerable ignorance and prejudice. &#x2026; Do you review it; say the truth and the whole truth&#x201D; (Duffy, <hi rend="italic">Four Years of Irish History, <date when="1845-00-00">1845</date>&#x2013;<date when="1849-00-00">1849</date></hi> [<date when="1883-00-00">1883</date>] 83). In the event, however, Duffy passed the review to John Mitchel. It expressed a remarkable combination of Mitchel&#x2019;s admiration for TC and his writing and sharp criticism of TC&#x2019;s understanding of Ireland as shown in his commentary on Cromwell&#x2019;s letters. It began: &#x201C;A book to be opened with reverence. &#x2026; The greatest writer, and profoundest philosopher, now living upon English soil, with eloquence, the like of which has not uttered itself in English speech since John Milton&#x2019;s time, deals in this book with the most glorious and terrible epoch of his country&#x2019;s history, and the divine (or diabolic) man, who is at last recognised, and will through all time be acknowledged, as the type of that heroic (or fanatic, or fanatico-heroic) age of England. / To English historical literature this is a precious accession; and the inhabitants of that country will do well to study it with what earnestness yet remains amongst them, in hopes of curing &#x2026; that loathsome disease, half mealy-mouthed cant, and half sneering facetiousness, which is fast eating away the old heart of England.&#x201D; There is more in praise of Cromwell and his biographer until it turns to Ireland. It ends with a personal tribute to TC, long &#x201C;our venerated and beloved preceptor&#x2014;at whose feet we have long studied and learned&#x201D; much that he &#x201C;never thought to teach us.&#x201D; Mitchel adds that though &#x201C;a determined Repealer and Irish Nationalist,&#x201D; he would never have been so &#x201C;but for his reverent study of the same great writer. Yet Carlyle considers Repeal an insane dream, and Ireland (God forgive him!) a nation of very poor creatures.&#x201D; John Mitchel (<date when="1815-00-00">1815</date>&#x2013;<date when="1875-00-00">75</date>: <ref target="volume-20/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/18828"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), Irish nationalist and writer; matriculated, Trinity Coll., Dublin, <date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>. After practicing as a solicitor, he was influenced by Thomas Osborne Davis, joined the Repeal Assoc., <date when="1843-00-00">1843</date>, and the staff of the <hi rend="italic">Nation</hi> under Duffy, <date when="1845-00-00">1845</date>. He took an important part in arguing for the ultimate use of &#x201C;physical force&#x201D; advocated by Young Ireland. In the face of the famine he grew more extreme; withdrew from the <hi rend="italic">Nation</hi>, <date when="1847-12-00">Dec. 1847</date>; and started the weekly <hi rend="italic">United Irishman</hi>, <date when="1848-02-12">12 Feb. 1848</date>. His fiercely seditious articles and speeches attacking the govt. and viceroy led to his arrest, trial, conviction (by a packed jury), and sentence to transportation for fourteen years; see vols. 22 and 23. TC strongly sympathized with him personally, though rejecting his aims, while Mitchel remained TC&#x2019;s convinced admirer. He is said to have imitated TC&#x2019;s style, though this is misleading in spite of Mitchel&#x2019;s many allusions to TC. Eventually he was sent to Tasmania but escaped to the U.S., where he supported the South during the Civil War. His countrymen elected him to the British parliament, <date when="1875-00-00">1875</date>, but on return to Ireland he was declared ineligible as a &#x201C;convicted felon.&#x201D; His <hi rend="italic">Jail Journal</hi> (first pbd. in his newspaper, the New York <hi rend="italic">Citizen</hi>) is a remarkable and well-written work. TC held to the more conservative Duffy when he split with Mitchel, though Duffy says that he told TC to his face that TC was to blame for having taught Mitchel &#x201C;to oppose the liberation of the negroes and the emancipation of the Jews&#x201D; (Duffy 117). See K. J. Fielding, &#x201C;Ireland, John Mitchel, and his &#x2018;Sarcastic Friend&#x2019; Thomas Carlyle,&#x201D; in <hi rend="italic">Literatur im Kontext&#x2014;Literature in Context. Festschrift f&#xfc;r Horst W. Drescher</hi>, ed. J. Schwend, S. Hagemann, and H. V&#xF6;lkel (Frankfurt, <date when="1992-00-00">1992</date>) 131&#x2013;43.</note> and could not <pb id="pg-20-105" n="20:105"/>but pronounce it heroic! The pain you were to get by these remarks of mine was very present to me while I wrote; but it was not to be avoided. I do deliberately consider that Ireland is actually called upon to know the <hi rend="italic">truth</hi> about Oliver Cromwell; that it for the present does not at all know the truth about him, and about the meaning of him,&#x2014;and ought, the sooner the better, to know it. That you, across such a mahlstrom<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> of Irish indignation, have nevertheless discerned for yourself that the man <hi rend="italic">was</hi> a Hero, full of Manhood, Earnestness and Valour,&#x2014;this, I think, is the creditablest thing I have yet known of you, and to me also is a very great satisfaction. Depend upon it, such a man, wherever he goes in God&#x2019;s Creation, means <hi rend="italic">good</hi> and not ill,&#x2014;and also, if we will understand him right, <hi rend="italic">does</hi> good and not ill! Alas, alas, that is a long crabbed chapter: but it seems to me certain that you are yet to change your views in regard to many matters in that province and what depends on it. For example, how would you like if, after all these denunciations by such witnesses as Clarendon, <pb id="pg-20-106" n="20:106"/>Carte &#x26;c who had no kind of chance to know about the matter,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In the course of his criticism of the part on Ireland Mitchel makes the same point as O&#x2019;Connell had (see <ref target="volume-20/lt-18460104-TC-JCA-01">TC to JCA, <date when="1846-01-04">4 Jan.</date></ref>) about Cromwell&#x2019;s massacres after the storming of Wexford and Drogheda, also citing Thomas Carte and Clarendon&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">History of the Rebellion and Civil Wars in England</hi> (Oxford, <date when="1702-00-00">1702</date>&#x2013;<date when="1704-00-00">4</date>, from transcript; Oxford, <date when="1826-00-00">1826</date>, from original MS). He rejects TC&#x2019;s excuses for Cromwell, saying that he saw Ireland as &#x201C;a blind promiscuous shambles and a place of sculls; to his enthusiastic editor it is merely a blackness and a blot.&#x201D;</note> it should turn out to be the actual God&#x2019;s Fact that Cromwell did not in any respect depart from the established rules of War while in Ireland; did not as he himself says (in a Paper I have lately got within reach of) &#x201C;sanction or order the death of any one not found in arms?&#x201D;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mitchel&#x2019;s other authorities, apart from tradition, apparently included &#x201C;Philopater Irenaeus, a contempory history of that war,&#x201D; and &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Deux cents femmes</hi>,&#x201D; by James Mac-Geogegan, who wrote an <hi rend="italic">Histoire de l&#x2019;Irlande</hi>, 3 vols. (Paris, <date when="1758-00-00">1758</date>&#x2013;<date when="1763-00-00">63</date>). Mitchel&#x2019;s own <hi rend="italic">History of Ireland</hi> (<date when="1868-00-00">1868</date>) was a continuation of MacGeogegan&#x2019;s.</note> I believe you would like very ill to be found defending what <hi rend="italic">is not</hi>, even with all Ireland, England and Scotland joining chorus with you!</p>
<p>My surmise is, that this will yet turn out to be the acknowledged fact: evidence to the contrary I must say I have yet found none that seems at all conclusive;&#x2014;and if you will give me or get me a list of the witnesses to the fact, I will actually go again to the Museum and do my best to sift the truth out of them. But alas there is no fact at all about the History of Cromwell that I have been able to satisfy myself about but I had first of all to bid an insane shrieking whirlwind of exasperated and astonished witnessers, &#x201C;Be silent you, till we see!&#x201D;&#x2014; I have taken down your Authorities from the <hi rend="italic">Nation;</hi> pray give more if you have them.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In spite of their differences O&#x2019;Hagan reported to Duffy that TC and JWC were &#x201C;greatly pleased with the review. &#x2026; They both considered it honest and manly in the extreme, especially in the way the <hi rend="italic">English</hi> Cromwell was judged; not, as they said they might naturally have expected by the light of what we consider him to have done in Ireland. &#x2026; Lucas was very glad when I told him that the article was M.&#x2019;s, for he said that you did not require anything to raise you in the opinion of your Chelsea friends, and that it was well to let them see that there was another man in the country&#x201D; (Duffy, <hi rend="italic">Four Years of Irish History</hi> 86).</note></p>
<p>Excuse all this. I could like much to talk weeks with you on those subjects. For it seems to me, as I have said already, Ireland, which means many millions of my own brethren, has again a blessed chance in having made a man like you to speak for her,&#x2014;and also (excuse the sincerity of the word) that your sermon to her is by no means yet according to the real Gospel in that matter.</p>
<p><closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign> my dear Sir. We greatly regretted Not to be at home when you were here. Good be with you: a patient brave heart, and a clear candid head, and all manner of good. Yours very sincerely</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name></p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Your new Work, which you have very kindly sent me a Copy of, arrived here two nights ago; for which, and for the kind Letter accompanying it, please to accept my sincere acknowledgements.</p>
<p>To be esteemed by an estimable man, occupying in many respects so very different a point of vision, is a real satisfaction. I am afraid, if you saw into all corners of my spiritual smithy, your approbation of the Smith and his hammerings might much diminish! However, I will beg for a continuance of those kind sentiments so long as that can be granted me. We have each his own labyrinth in this dim arena of ours; and must struggle towards the eternal Pole-stars each of us as we best may.</p>

<salute>Dearest Babbie</salute>
<p>It will be one way of bringing &#x201C;good out of evil&#x201D; to occupy a part of this extremely wet day in writing to you. When the weather is at all <hi rend="italic">gait-going</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Suitable for walking out.</note> at present, my time is cut up into shreds in the saddest manner&#x2014; First the Paulets look for me, naturally, in Hanover Street,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Leading W off Regent&#x2019;s St. to Hanover Sq., just S of Oxford St.</note>&#x2014;not forming in their innocent minds, I believe, the least conception of the exertions I have to make and the things I have to leave undone in <hi rend="italic">rendering myself</hi> there almost every day&#x2014;just consider&#x2014;it takes me an hour to go another hour to return&#x2014;and allowing myself on the average an hour to stay&#x2014;there goes the whole heart out of my <hi rend="italic">Before-dinner!</hi> to say nothing of the physical fatigue which, some days, when I am not up to much, runs away with my evenings also, as I can do nothing after coming in but sprawl on the sofa&#x2014; However <pb id="pg-20-108" n="20:108"/>now that the operation is over, and the eyes going on Alexander says &#x201C;in the most <hi rend="italic">splendid</hi> manner,&#x201D; there is a prospect of M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Paulet being able to get off here occasionally&#x2014;and at all events their case is not so much in need of the sympathy and attentions of friends as hitherto. The operation was only performed on saturday week&#x2014;the last four days of delay being caused by the poor little man himself having gone bang against an open door, with one eye, and so long as it was ever so little swelled; it was not judged safe to meddle with it. The pain appears to have been insignificant, he <hi rend="italic">counted aloud</hi> (at Alexander&#x2019;s desire) all thro&#x2019; it&#x2014; Nor has he suffered much from smarting or itching since,&#x2014;but he is very low and sorrowful, thro&#x2019; a fortnight of spoon-meat!&#x2014; The bandages were removed last Thursday but he is not allowed to open his eyes yet&#x2014;indeed the process of opening them is so painful that he is not tempted to try&#x2014; I hope he will soon be quite recovered and, above all things, following his business again from nine of the morning till seven at night!&#x2014; I do not believe Betsey ever knew till now how thoroughly and irretrievably married she was! Having him to <hi rend="italic">listen to all day long</hi> is a dreadful strain on anyone&#x2019;s spirits&#x2014;tho he <hi rend="italic">is</hi> a kindhearted man as need be&#x2014;&#x201C;and not a fool&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf.

<p>Meanwhile Julia has <hi rend="italic">come out</hi> poor Child! with a proviso that she is to <hi rend="italic">go in</hi> again on her return home&#x2014; She has been to two Balls and is going to a third this week!&#x2014;nay, she has had an <hi rend="italic">anonymous bouquet</hi> sent her after one of them!

I saw her get herself dressed for one of these Balls&#x2014;such a &#x201C;rough and ready&#x201D; dressing as I never assisted at! M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Paulet had bought a quantity of thin muslin in the forenoon and whipt it up into a frock&#x2014;fitting better or worse&#x2014; This was put on her with about as much nicety as one would bestow in mounting a &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">straw-boggle</hi></foreign> [scarecrow]&#x201D;&#x2014;and her hair got three <hi rend="italic">strokes</hi> of the brush&#x2014;and <hi rend="italic">voila tout!</hi>&#x2014;and I could wager a prettier creature did not take the shine out of her that night! Certainly a <hi rend="italic">calmer</hi> could not be&#x2014;</p>
<p>Old Sterling also takes up much of time&#x2014;his state does not improve&#x2014; and it is impossible to refuse to drive with him now when he asks me&#x2014;he is so utterly desolate on this earth&#x2014;(that Cast mettle&#x2014;Anthony still in Rome&#x2014;his wife I understand gone mad again there) His body is frail enough&#x2014;but that is nothing to his mind&#x2014; He often forgets his own name&#x2014; <pb id="pg-20-109" n="20:109"/>the last day we were out he ordered them to &#x201C;drive home&#x2014;home to <hi rend="italic">South Place</hi> you know&#x201D;&#x2014;South Place having been no home of his poor old soul these two years!</p>

<p>Geraldine by the way is all in a blaze of enthusiasm about Miss Cushman the Actress&#x2014;with whom she swore everlasting friendship at Manchester just when she had got jealous of me and M<hi rend="italic">r</hi>s Paulet&#x2014; Ever since her letters have been filled with lyrics about this woman&#x2014;till I could stand it no longer&#x2014;and have written her such a screed of my mind as she never got before&#x2014;and which will probably terminate our correspondence&#x2014;at least till the finale of her friendship for Miss Cushman.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charlotte Saunders Cushman (<date when="1816-00-00">1816</date>&#x2013;<date when="1876-00-00">76</date>), American actress, notable for the roles of Lady Macbeth, Rosalind, Meg Merrilies, and Nancy in <hi rend="italic">Oliver Twist</hi>. She was managing a theater in Philadelphia in <date when="1844-00-00">1844</date> when she met Macready, then touring the U.S. (see <ref target="volume-17/lt-18430821-JWC-TC-01"><sic>17:74</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1843-08-21">21 Aug. 1843</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-17/lt-18430827-TC-WCM-01"><sic>88&#x2013;89</sic><corr>TC to WCM, <date when="1843-08-27">27 Aug. 1843</date></corr></ref>), and was persuaded to act in London, making her debut, <date when="1845-02-14">14 Feb. 1845</date>. She opened at the Haymarket as Romeo with her sister Susan as Juliet, <date when="1845-12-30">30 Dec. 1845</date>, performing the play for eighty nights followed by a tour. She stayed in England till <date when="1849-00-00">1849</date>, and made several return visits. Jewsbury wrote about her to JWC in <date when="1846-02-00">Feb.</date>: &#x201C;You got bored about Miss [Cushman] because I had not skill to tell you of her.&#x201D; At the same time she wrote, probably in answer to JWC&#x2019;s &#x201C;screed&#x201D;: &#x201C;I cannot tell the pain you give me when you make any allusion to the past &#x2026; but so far as I am concerned you are wrong, mistaken. Your compass is turned completely round, and points to nothing right. It is no good your getting up a theory about me. I was born to drive theories and rules to distraction, and I want to beat yours to powder and then stamp upon it&#x201D; (Ireland 189, 191). Cushman&#x2019;s biographer calls Jewsbury, who had met her in <date when="1845-00-00">1845</date>, &#x201C;one of Miss Cushman&#x2019;s earliest friends in England,&#x201D; and quotes from some of Jewsbury&#x2019;s reminiscences: &#x201C;I suppose Miss Cushman was not handsome, but the beautiful, true, and firm gray eyes gave me the impression of beauty, and supplied the lack of it, if it were lacking. To me she always looked beautiful. Her voice, too, was true and real like herself, and of a <hi rend="italic">tone</hi> that was very pleasant to the ear. She conveyed the impression of protection and strength. &#x2026; In Manchester she made many friends, quiet, domestic people, who regarded her with affection and respect. She was noble and generous, and gave help to whoever needed it&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Charlotte Cushman, Her Letters and Memories of Her Life</hi>, ed.

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I am again busy with that unfortunate Book on <hi rend="italic">Cromwell;</hi> a second edition printing; various notices of new Letters of Oliver&#x2019;s (highly unimportant for most part, and highly embarrassing as I now stand),&#x2014;each new Letter with its commentaries somewhat like an ancient rusty nail imbedded in half a ton of dust, of which I am to see what I can make!&#x2014; All that <hi rend="italic">are</hi> genuine I decide to make an effort towards disengaging, and printing in some Appendix, for the benefit of the Owls and others,&#x2014;and as this is the last time I mean ever to bring operative hand on that Book, I feel anxious to have it as exact as I can, as complete too as I can.</p>
<p>Here has a List of 5 Letters to the University of Oxford come-in this morning. I never heard of them before, and do not fancy they are of much moment: however, if they be procurable I ought to have them. Not knowing any so charitable person I again apply to you.</p>
<p>The List seems abundantly specific. If you could inquire of Dr Bliss (to whose consummate accuracy and clearness as an Editor I am much indebted in these unspeakable inquiries), of Dr Bliss, or of what other competent person there may be, perhaps it would not be difficult to get me either copies of those old Letters, or else a good assurance that they do not exist now.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Philip Bliss (<date when="1787-00-00">1787</date>&#x2013;<date when="1857-00-00">1857</date>; <ref target="volume-20/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/2654"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), keeper of the Oxford Univ. archives, <date when="1826-00-00">1826</date>&#x2013;<date when="1857-00-00">57</date>, registrar, <date when="1824-00-00">1824</date>&#x2013;<date when="1853-00-00">53</date>, and holder of various other univ. offices; principal of St. Mary Hall, <date when="1848-00-00">1848</date>&#x2013;<date when="1857-00-00">57</date>; ed. of many antiquarian works, including <hi rend="italic">Athenae Oxonienses</hi> (see next letter). In the revised <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi>, TC included five letters from the &#x201C;Archives of Oxford University. Communicated by the Rev. Dr. Bliss&#x201D;; see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 7:287&#x2013;88, 289&#x2013;90, 9:269, 271&#x2013;72, 292&#x2013;93.</note> In the former case some marginal word or two from the pen of Dr Bliss, to make the Letters dimly intelligible again, would be a very great favour.</p>
<p>Excuse this new trouble I lay on you;&#x2014;in fact you ought to pity me.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jacobson replied from Oxford, <date when="1846-01-27">27 Jan.</date>: &#x201C;I have the pleasure of enclosing you Copies of the Documents which you desired to have. My friend Dr. Bliss has had the goodness to make them for me himself, so that you may rely on the corrections. / I found, on further examination that the remaining Paper which I had prepared to copy from the Somers Collection was addressed not to Cromwell but to Fairfax, so that there was no need for me to trouble you with it.&#x201D;</note></p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Your reference to Wood, concerning Downhall&#x2019;s death, is correct to the letter;&#x2014;a small Appendix, wanting in the other two Editions of Wood, contains that column in the Second Edit<hi rend="italic">n</hi>.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Anthony &#xE0; Wood (<date when="1632-00-00">1632</date>&#x2013;<date when="1695-00-00">95</date>), compiler of <hi rend="italic">Athenae Oxonienses</hi>, 2 vols.

(<date when="1721-00-00">1721</date>); new edn., ed. Philip Bliss, 4 vols. (<date when="1813-00-00">1813</date>&#x2013;<date when="1820-00-00">20</date>). TC noted of Cromwell&#x2019;s letter to Downhall: &#x201C;MS. communicated by Mr. Cooper, resting on the following formidable mass of documentary Authorities,&#x201D; among which was &#x201C;Wood&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Athenae</hi> (2d edition, passage wanting in both the 1st and 3d).ii. <date when="1179-00-00">1179</date>&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 9:210).</note> We have now completely managed Downhall.</p>
<p>I have written to Mr Wells of the Fen Office at Ely about that &#x201C;Letter to Mr Hand.&#x201D; O. C (I.351 third edit<hi rend="italic">n</hi>),<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Oliver Cromwell, <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of the Protector</hi>, third edn., 2 vols. (<date when="1822-00-00">1822</date>).</note> the confused man, does not specify with any distinctness <hi rend="italic">where</hi> he found that Letter, whether it does belong to the Parsons&#x2019;s Charity or not,&#x2014;who or what &#x2018;Mr Hand&#x2019; may be supposed to be.</p>
<p>I can make tolerable sense of it all except the phrase &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Town</hi> money&#x201D;; of &#x201C;Town&#x201D; I can make nothing; and begin to suspect O. C. may have read wrong,&#x2014;as, it seems, he is used to do. On the whole I wish much a competent man could get his eye on that Letter, and report to me about it.</p>
<p>If Dr Peacock write, I shall of course hear from you: meanwhile Mr Wells if on the spot will do what he can. It is a frightful labour this of elucidating Letters of Cromwell; but I am bound to it yet for a while!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I did not by forethought omit the <hi rend="italic">Speech</hi> you point out:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Appendix No. 30, &#x201C;Speech Should-be &#x2018;XV,&#x2019;&#x201D; <date when="1657-05-27">25 May 1657</date>, &#x201C;FINAL Speech on that matter of the Kinship,&#x201D; from <hi rend="italic">Commons Journals</hi>, vol. 7; see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 9:290&#x2013;92.</note> I had infinitely uglier Speeches than that to deal with; and will certainly insert that, now that I know of it.</p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>In your valuable edition of <hi rend="italic">Baillie</hi>,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Letters and Journals of Robert Baillie</hi>, 3 vols. (Edinburgh, <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>&#x2013;<date when="1842-00-00">42</date>); see <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410924-TC-DL-01"><sic>13:261</sic><corr>TC to DL, <date when="1841-09-24">24 Sept. 1841</date></corr></ref>.</note> at p. 218 vol ii, you have a Note upon Major-General Crawford. I do not care very much about that windy individual; but having fallen into some unlucky connexion with him for a moment, I would rather be exact in the business than not.</p>
<p>Now you well explain there how it comes that Godwin (Hist<hi rend="italic">y</hi> Commonwealth i. 380) calls this man <hi rend="italic">Skeldon</hi> Crawford; which is one error swept out of the way. But you yourself call him <hi rend="italic">William</hi>, and say he was a <hi rend="italic">Major</hi> of Horse in <date when="1642-00-00">1642</date>; which, as he came in feb<hi rend="italic">y</hi> <date when="1643-00-00">1643</date>&#x2013;4 to be Major-<hi rend="italic">General</hi> of the Earl of Manchester&#x2019;s Army, seems rather unlikely.</p>
<p>Anthony Wood (<hi rend="italic">Life</hi> p. viii, Bliss&#x2019;s edit<hi rend="italic">n</hi>) names him <hi rend="italic">Laurence</hi>;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Laurence Crawford or Crawfurd (<date when="1611-00-00">1611</date>&#x2013;<date when="1645-00-00">45</date>), son of Thomas Crawford of Jordanhill; commanded a foot regt. in Ireland, <date when="1641-00-00">1641</date>&#x2013;<date when="1643-00-00">43</date>; second in command to 2d earl of Manchester (see <ref target="volume-17/lt-18440216-TC-HC-01"><sic>17:271</sic><corr>TC to HC, <date when="1844-02-16">16 Feb. 1844</date></corr></ref>) at Marston Moor; killed at the siege of Hereford. Wood refers to him as Laurence Crafford of Jordanhill (d. <date when="1645-00-00">1645</date>). According to the <ref target="volume-20/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/6641"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref> (which cites Baillie) he had a kinsman, Skeldon Crawford, major of Lord Montgomerie&#x2019;s horse, <date when="1642-00-00">1642</date>. Laing notes him as William Crawford of Nether Skeldon, Ayrshire (d. <date when="1646-00-00">1646</date>), and does not differentiate between the two men. William Godwin, <hi rend="italic">History of the Commonwealth of England</hi>, 4 vols. (<date when="1824-00-00">1824</date>&#x2013;<date when="1828-00-00">28</date>; see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18401211-TC-JF-01"><sic>12:361</sic><corr>TC to JF, <date when="1840-12-11">11 Dec. 1840</date></corr></ref>), refers to Skeldon Crawford&#x2019;s appointment to maj.-gen. of Manchester&#x2019;s army as breaking the harmony between Cromwell and Manchester (1:380), apparently also confusing the two. For TC&#x2019;s treatment of him and Cromwell&#x2019;s letter to him, see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 6:180&#x2013;85. TC never did discover his Christian name.</note> and has <pb id="pg-20-114" n="20:114"/>another story about him generally, which but for you I should have at once believed.</p>
<p>Would you be so kind as glance again at that matter, and set it right for me.&#x2014; &#x2014; I have followed Crawford all thro&#x2019; Baillie under your guidance, thro&#x2019; the Commons Journals &#x26;c &#x26;c, and do not anywhere find his Christian name. Probably Wood is right?&#x2014; I have got, under most abstruse envelopements, a Letter of Cromwell&#x2019;s, old <hi rend="italic">Copy</hi> of a Letter, which seems to have been addressed to this blustering Whiskerando: otherwise I should leave him most willingly in eternal darkness, &#x2018;buried in the Cathedral of Hereford, with his monument removed.&#x2019;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Crawford was buried in Gloucester Cathedral with &#x201C;a very fair monument,&#x201D; removed at the Restoration (Wood, Bliss&#x2019;s edn. 1:viii).</note></p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I have to bid you give my very kind thanks to the Gentleman who furnished those little French Documents of Cromwell.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Three notes to Cardinal Jules Mazarin (<date when="1602-00-00">1602</date>&#x2013;<date when="1661-00-00">61</date>); see <hi rend="italic">Supplement</hi> 210&#x2013;11, 213&#x2013;14 and <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 9:274&#x2013;78, from the &#x201C;Archives du Ministre des Affaires Etrang&#xE8;res, at Paris. Communicated by Thomas Wright, Esq. [(<date when="1810-00-00">1810</date>&#x2013;<date when="1877-00-00">77</date>; <ref target="volume-20/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/30063"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), antiquary].&#x201D;</note> In some work or other I shall perhaps find room for them: the first of the three, if it had been in English, or one were perfectly sure of the translation, would be rather curious, dated as it is. I suppose there is no doubt of the <hi rend="italic">authenticity</hi> of your friend, tho&#x2019; he perhaps would rather not have his name mentioned?&#x2014;</p>
<p>I have been so busy with Proofs and Cromwell rubbish of various kinds, I have not found time to write, till now when I am otherwise bound to find it. I am getting ready the Sheets of the <hi rend="italic">new</hi> edition for America, if Mr Emerson see good to publish a new one there. I have volunteered to send them duly to him every month. The Packet sails on the 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>,&#x2014;that is to say, a Letter put into our Post-Office that day will be forwarded to Liverpool by the evening mail (I <hi rend="italic">think</hi> that is it), and go by the Packet on the morrow.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-20-115" n="20:115"/>I will direct Robson to send you all the sheets he has ready on the evening of the 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi> next (and following months, till we get done). And now in the meanwhile could you be so good as ascertain how they are to go,&#x2014;and send them off in due time, addressed &#x201C;R. Waldo Emerson Esq / Concord / Boston / Massachusetts&#x201D;;&#x2014;and let me know on or before the morning of the third by <hi rend="italic">what</hi> conveyance they are gone.&#x2014; I remember he spoke of your Namesake in Newgate Street;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Chapman.</note> that Mr Chapman too knows me, and is a faithful obliging man: he if you would speak a word with him, would do excellently well, and perhaps save you any farther trouble in the matter but what your Clerks could undertake. At all events, choose some safe way. And for one thing let us have no more to do with the <hi rend="italic">Wily and Put-on-him</hi> Firm,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Wiley &#x26; Putnam.</note>&#x2014;in that or in any other matter! We have had enough of acquaintance with them. I believe; and can easily extend our connexion with that genus of persons, if we ever incline it!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Of course I shall be very glad to talk with you on such a matter as the <hi rend="italic">Miscellanies</hi>.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The 3d edn., 4 vols., pbd. by Chapman &#x26; Hall, <date when="1847-00-00">1847</date>, added three essays to previous edns. and increased the price.</note> There has a certain small addition (about the &#xBC; of a volume perhaps) accumulated since the last printing.

<salute>Dear Emerson,</salute>
<p>One word to you before the Packet sail;&#x2014;on business of my own, once more; in such a state of <hi rend="italic">haste</hi> as could hardly be greater. The Printers are upon me, and I have not a moment.</p>
<p>Contrary to all human expectation, this Book on Cromwell proves saleable to mankind here, and a Second Edition is now going forward with all speed. The publication of the First has brought out from their recesses a <hi rend="italic">new</hi> heap of Cromwell Letters;&#x2014;which have been a huge embarrassment to me; for they are highly unimportant for most part, and do not tend to alter or materially modify anything. Some Fifty or Sixty new Letters in all (many of them from Printed Books that had escaped me): the great majority, with others yet that may come in future time, I determine to print simply as an Appendix; but several too, I think about Twenty in all, are to <pb id="pg-20-116" n="20:116"/>be fitted into the Text, chiefly in the early part of the First volume, as tending to bring some matters into greater clearness there. I am busy with that even now; sunk deep into the Dust-abysses again!&#x2014; Of course I have made what provision I could for printing a Supplement &#x26;c to the possessors of the First Edition: but I find this Second will be the <hi rend="italic">Final</hi> standing Edition of the Book;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-20/lt-18451228-TC-DL-01">TC to DL, <date when="1845-12-28">28 Dec. 1845</date></ref>.</note> decidedly preferable to the First; not to be touched by me <hi rend="italic">again</hi>, except on very good cause indeed. New Letters, except they expressly contradict me, shall go at once into the back apartment, or Appendix, in future.</p>
<p>The Printers have sent me some five or six Sheets, they send me hitherto a sheet daily; but perhaps there are not above 3 or 2 in a perfect state: so I trouble you with none of them by this Packet. But by next Packet (<date when="1846-03-03">3<hi rend="italic">d</hi> of March</date>), unless I hear to the contrary, I will send you all the Sheets that are ready; and so by the following Packets, till we are out of it;&#x2014;that you, on the scene there, may do with them once for all whatsoever you like. If <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> can be done with them,&#x2014;believe me I shall be very glad of that result. But if you can so much as oblige any honest Bookseller of your or my acquaintance by the gift of them, let it be done; let Pirates and ravenous Bipeds of Prey be excluded from participating: that of itself will <supplied>[be]</supplied><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> a comfortable and a proper thing!&#x2014; You are hereby authorized to promulgate in any way you please. That the Second Edition will be augmented, corrected, as aforesaid; and that Mr (Any Son of Adam you please to name) is, so far as I have any voice in the matter, appointed by me, to the exclusion of all and sundry others on what pretext soever, to print and vend the same to my American Friends. And so it stands; and the Sheets (probably near 30 in number) will be out with the <date when="1846-03-00">March</date> Packet:&#x2014; and if nothing can come of it, I for one shall be very glad! The Book is to be in Three Volumes now; the first ends at p. 403 vol I; the Third begins at p. 155 vol II, of the present edition.</p>
<p>What are you doing? Write to me: how the Lectures went,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-20/lt-18451111-TC-RWE-01">TC to RWE, <date when="1845-11-11">11 Nov. 1845</date></ref>.</note> how all things went and go!&#x2014; We are over head and ears in Anti-Corn-Law here; the Aristocracy struck almost with a kind of horror at sight of that terrible Millocracy,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The powerful new manufacturing interest; cf. <hi rend="italic">Past and Present, Works</hi> 10:140, which the <hi rend="italic">OED</hi> records as its first use.</note> rising like a huge hideous Frankenstein<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Popularly thought to be the name of the monster in Mary Shelley, <hi rend="italic">Frankenstein</hi> (<date when="1818-00-00">1818</date>), but in fact the name of its creator.</note> up in Lancashire,&#x2014; seemingly with boundless ready-money in its pocket, and a very fierce humour in its stomach! To me it is as yet almost uglier than the Aristocracy; <pb id="pg-20-117" n="20:117"/>and I will not fire guns when this small victory is gained; I will recommend a day of Fasting rather, that such a victory required such gaining.</p>

<salute>Dear Mrs Hawes,</salute>
<p>Unluckily I am engaged to dine on Saturday, and cannot come to you. Alas, I am again sunk deep in the Puritan Abysses (unexpectedly, after I <pb id="pg-20-118" n="20:118"/>seemed to have escaped alive), and can hardly get anywhither! With kind regards to Mr Hawes, and regrets enough to myself for one</p>
<closer><salute>I remain always / Yours very sincerely /</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name>

<salute>Dearest Babbie</salute>
<p>Would that it had been only &#x201C;good Samaritanism&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Visiting the Paulets.</note> which has stood in the way of my writing all this while&#x2014;but <hi rend="italic">that</hi> has been the least of it! My liver has been in a state more easily conceived than described. I have really been <hi rend="italic">too sick</hi> and <hi rend="small-caps">physically sorrowful</hi> &#x201C;for anything. have hardly been able to get to the Paulets even&#x2014;tho&#x2019; their outlooks get to seem daily more questionable for me. Alexander perseveres in saying &#x201C;it is <hi rend="italic">all right</hi>,&#x201D; only M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Paulet being a very <hi rend="italic">torpid</hi> subject the healing does not go on so quickly as in the generality of cases. If he found him so very &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">torpid</hi>&#x201D; why, I wonder, did he restrict him to gruel and all that sort of thing for two or three weeks? And tho&#x2019; the bandages were taken off his eyes after a few days he is still not suffered to go out even in a carriage, and the confinement affects his health and spirits as one may suppose. He professes to be able to see <hi rend="italic">if he could open his eyes</hi>&#x2014;but then he <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> open his eyes, and something is continually occurring to &#x201C;throw him back&#x201D; as Alexander&#x2019;s phrase is&#x2014;for instance the other day he <hi rend="italic">sneezed</hi>&#x2014;contrary to orders&#x2014;but as he sorrowfully remarked&#x2014;&#x201C;how is one to help sneezing in the midst of constant draughts&#x201D;? The result was a little bladder of water formed on the eye&#x2014; In short I do not augur well of this slowness of the eyes to <hi rend="italic">heal</hi>&#x2014;and meanwhile you may fancy his poor wife has a bad time of it&#x2014; She hardly ever gets out long enough to come here&#x2014;and the noise and closeness, and strangeness of her London-house quite ruins her digestion&#x2014; She puts a good face on things, as is her way, but she gets to look thiner and more <hi rend="italic">bewildered</hi> every time I see her.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jewsbury wrote, [<date when="1846-02-23">23 Feb.</date>]: &#x201C;She is not in her natural element in London, or rather, not in the element in which you and I have known her, and I can easily fancy you get little good out of each other. She complains of the short and unsatisfactory interviews she gets with you&#x201D; (Ireland 190).</note></p>
<p><pb id="pg-20-119" n="20:119"/>Lady Harriet is returned and seems disposed to keep up our country intimacy&#x2014; She sends her carriage for me often in the evenings and sends me back&#x2014;treats me in all respects with <hi rend="italic">a consideration</hi> for which I cannot but be grateful to her.&#x2014; She never <hi rend="italic">says</hi> to any one that she likes them&#x2014; she goes upon <hi rend="italic">the silent system</hi> as to all the thoughts of her <hi rend="italic">heart</hi>&#x2014;it is only the thoughts of her <hi rend="italic">head</hi> which she gives one the benefit of&#x2014;and so she has never <hi rend="italic">said</hi> what one could call a <hi rend="italic">kind</hi> word to <hi rend="italic">me</hi>&#x2014;but she proves by all her behavior that she is rather fond of me&#x2014;the mere fact of her having <hi rend="italic">kissed</hi> me at parting and meeting again proves more affection for me than twenty reams of protestations from a Geraldine would do&#x2014;for her Ladyship is <hi rend="italic">sincere</hi> to death&#x2014;and would think much less of boxing the ears of a person indifferent to her than of kissing her! for my part I <hi rend="italic">love</hi> her now as much <supplied>[as]</supplied><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> I <hi rend="italic">admired</hi> her in the beginning<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jewsbury wrote, [<date when="1846-02-23">23 Feb.</date>]: &#x201C;I do really feel pleased that you have someone near at hand to love, and who desires to be loved by you. &#x2026; She was not brought up by a mother, you once told me, and that&#x2019;s the secret of her! She was not treated kindly, and was driven within herself, and then she had no one to trust. She learned to look through everybody, and her own thoughts have ever been a secret&#x201D; (Ireland 188&#x2013;89).</note>&#x2014; She is the only woman of <hi rend="italic">Genius</hi> I have found amongst all our pretenders to it&#x2014; I only wish I had got to know her twenty years ago when I was better capable of enjoying the advantages of such an acquaintance&#x2014; The &#x201C;getting-on-in-Society&#x201D;-part of it looks to me often enough a practical irony at this time of day rather than a good fortune to thank my stars for&#x2014;</p>
<p>You would be amused to see the increase of charm I have for the smaller gentry since Lady Harriet took me up!&#x2014;I could not help answering a <hi rend="italic">kind</hi> note I had from Lady Monteagle<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mary Anne, b. Marshall (<date when="1799-00-00">1799</date>&#x2013;<date when="1889-00-00">1889</date>), Baroness Monteagle; see <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380215-TC-MAC-01"><sic>10:28</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1838-02-15">15 Feb. 1838</date></corr></ref>.</note> the other day <hi rend="italic">after a twelve-months silence</hi>&#x2014;in a tone of very frank <hi rend="italic">sarcasm</hi>.</p>
<p>I think you should write to Ann Sommers to enquire about the money&#x2014; She acknowledged the receipt of mine very gratefully&#x2014;not at once indeed but in the course of a week or two and she excused the delay I remember by saying that the shock of <hi rend="italic">my</hi> letter had brought on an illness<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-20/lt-18450709-JWC-JW-01">JWC to JW, [<date when="1845-07-09">9 July 1845</date>]</ref>.</note>&#x2014;</p>
<p>I congratulate you on the prospect of getting Helen to bed&#x2014;for tho&#x2019; you do not say it&#x2014;of course if she did not go earlier to bed she could not be indulging in a shower bath at nine in the morning. That sort of grievances are very hard to bear and might well ruffle the temper even of a &#x201C;blessed Babbie&#x201D;! for one can never feel &#x201C;virtues own reward&#x201D; in bearing them&#x2014; must always have ones private doubts whether one should not be acting more dutifully in rushing on them with a stick and putting down the <pb id="pg-20-120" n="20:120"/>unreasonable thing <foreign><hi rend="italic">par vive force</hi></foreign> [by main force]&#x2014; There is so much that <hi rend="italic">must</hi> be born!&#x2014;no wonder that one gets rather frantic now and then in bearing the <hi rend="italic">not</hi> inevitable!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I would have written immediately on receiving your letter yesterday&#x2014; had it been only to express my thankful sense of my uncles misgivings about me&#x2014;it is such a comfort to think that anybody can be made anxious about me!&#x2014;but alas! yesterday I had blue pill in me and <hi rend="italic">salts</hi> beside&#x2014;and was getting sicker and more sick till I made a faint of it in the evening&#x2014; Will you tell James Carson when you see him that Carlyle &#x201C;received his letter&#x2014;that <hi rend="italic">he</hi> (James Carson) had discharged <hi rend="italic">his</hi> duty in the matter and that he (Carlyle) is obliged to him.&#x201D;</p>
<p>I had almost forgotten to tell you that some weeks ago, walking thro&#x2019; Piccadilly one day, I came bang against&#x2014;William Chrystal!<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Identified by Huxley as the brother of Andrew Chrystal.</note>&#x2014;our eyes met&#x2014;so I saw nothing for it but to speak&#x2014; He told me in a pettish sort of way that he &#x201C;did not know me&#x201D; and when I laughed at that, he asked &#x201C;how are your friends up there&#x201D; nodding towards Hyde Park Corner! I supposed he meant at Liverpool and answered accordingly&#x2014; When we had gone our several ways Mazzini who was with me, asked &#x201C;who is he?&#x201D; &#x201C;A distracted lover of my two Cousins&#x201D; said I&#x2014; &#x201C;are these his children?&#x201D; said Mazzini&#x2014; &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">What</hi> children&#x201D;? &#x201C;The two little, little things&#x2014;so high&#x201D;&#x2014;pointing to his knee&#x2014;&#x201C;and dressed both alike. whom he was leading when you stopt him&#x2014;and whom he joined again&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;I tell you said I the man is a lover of Jeanies&#x2014;was not married before that I know of&#x2014;how then can <hi rend="italic">he</hi> have little things dressed both alike&#x201D;&#x2014; &#x201C;Oh said Mazzini&#x2014;I did not know&#x2014; I thought perhaps by your laws <hi rend="italic">poligamy</hi> might be allowed to <hi rend="italic">a Mad</hi>.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Do <hi rend="italic">you</hi> understand about these &#x201C;little things&#x201D;&#x2014;it certainly had a suspicious appearance.</p>
<p>God bless thee Babbie a kiss&#x2014;a hundred of them to my Uncle love to Maggie&#x2014; I felt rather jealous the other day when Mrs Russell wrote to me that <hi rend="italic">they</hi> got newspapers addressed in <hi rend="italic">my Uncles own hand</hi></p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I hoped to have been able to send you a deliberate kind of Letter tonight; but here has been one interruption and another; and the result is, A brief hasty word once more, as better than none at all.</p>
<p>I have got thro&#x2019; my first volume,&#x2014;to p. 402 of the <hi rend="italic">present</hi> vol. I; have, with very much unpleasant labour, stuck-in some 22 Letters; and must now begin the Second. In the Third is like to be little change. I hope to get thro&#x2019;, in some weeks, without doing the Book much mischief; and that is all I can hope.</p>
<p>Our weather here too has been very wet and muddy; we have now got Northwesterly wind; and are growing drier, tho&#x2019; still with showers. The Town is very much crowded, as usual; great noise going on about Corn-Law <pb id="pg-20-122" n="20:122"/>&#x26;c (but it is understood Peel will be able to do without a new Election, too),&#x2014;about all which I trouble myself very little. We keep pretty fairish in health, tho&#x2019; Jane does not take quite well with the change into Spring, now and then.&#x2014; Take care of my good Mother! What is she doing? Tell me about her and Isabella.</p>
<p>The other day in St James&#x2019;s Park I met Brandes:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-20/lt-18451227-TC-CKJB-01">TC to CKJB, <date when="1845-12-27">27 Dec. 1845</date></ref>.</note> quite dark, poor fellow; they had brought him out in a cab, I think, and there he was walking. Nothing <hi rend="italic">visibly</hi> wrong in his eyes: incurable amaurosis, I fear. His <hi rend="italic">nails</hi> were grown very <hi rend="italic">long</hi>,&#x2014;nobody to pare them, poor creature! Will you be sure to tell me his Address; which I forgot to ask him. I have not seen lately a more pitiable object. He still speaks of going to Bonn; but there are still delays at Copenhagen &#x26;c &#x26;c; in fact one discerns nothing for certain except that the poor soul is left here moneyless, hopeless, dark!&#x2014; Jane says she would drive to see him some day: a sovereign or two is really due to him from me, if he come to absolute straits.</p>
<p>Robertson does not come our way of late:&#x2014;not much comes, I think, that you would be interested in. Thomas Spedding, James&#x2019;s Brother, is here: we are engaged to an <hi rend="italic">indigestion</hi> at the Wilsons&#x2019; on that score;&#x2014;no getting off. The Barings are also come up to Town; the &#x26;c &#x26;c.</p>
<p>I am inclined to approve of Jenny&#x2019;s adventure; at all events she ought to have the freest scope for exercising her <hi rend="italic">own</hi> judgement about it.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Carlyle wrote to Janet Hanning, [early <date when="1846-00-00">1846</date>]: &#x201C;I heard you had asked James [Austin] to look after a house in Annan, but that he had not found one. I have desired Jean [Aitken] to look also at Dumfries, which on the whole might be the preferable place for you, being entirely out of the way of that grievance of which you spoke as an object of your fears, &#x26; Jean being there besides. You will think of the matter matern<supplied>[al]</supplied>ly enough I daresay before coming to final decision. You would have better schools at Dumfries than at Annan, &#x26; one is always freer in a larger town&#x201D; (MS: Yale).</note> The increase to her little allowance shall be most cheerfully made on my part,&#x2014;whatever you judge wise in that matter. Poor little Jenny!&#x2014;&#x2014; I have no room more. I send my blessing to all;&#x2014;my heart&#x2019;s love to my dear Mother in particular. I again commend her to your Care, medical and other; write to me soon what she and the rest are doing. Surely I shall have more time by and by! <closer><salute>My regards to Jamie.

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Here is a small piece of Paper which I have already had, under my <pb id="pg-20-123" n="20:123"/>Clerk&#x2019;s management, at the British Museum: but he reports &#x201C;a big <hi rend="italic">Evans</hi> in two volumes 4<hi rend="italic">to</hi>,&#x201D; and can make nothing of my inquiry.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The enclosure, in TC&#x2019;s writing, reads: &#x201C;Evans&#x2019;s History of Bristol (a small modern Book) p. 181: What he says of <hi rend="italic">Humphry Hook Esq</hi> (be very exact,&#x2014;and as swift as you please)&#x2014;.&#x201D; Redwood had lent TC John Evans (<date when="1774-00-00">1774</date>&#x2013;<date when="1828-00-00">1828</date>), <hi rend="italic">A Chronological Outline of the History of Bristol</hi> (Bristol, <date when="1824-00-00">1824</date>) in <date when="1842-00-00">1842</date>; see <ref target="volume-15/lt-18420917-TC-CR-01"><sic>15:87</sic><corr>TC to CR, <date when="1842-09-17">17 Sept. 1842</date></corr></ref>. John Christie probably mistook this octavo vol. for a work by another John Evans (d. <date when="1832-00-00">1832</date>), also a native of Bristol: <hi rend="italic">The History of Bristol</hi>, 2 vols. (<date when="1816-00-00">1816</date>), the first vol. of which was written by John Corry and the second by Evans. Humphrey Hooke (ca. <date when="1580-00-00">1580</date>&#x2013;<date when="1659-00-00">1659</date>), M.P. for Bristol, <date when="1640-00-00">1640</date>&#x2013;<date when="1642-05-12">12 May 1642</date>, when he was expelled because of his connection with Bristol&#x2019;s Society of Merchant Venturers, which parliament viewed as monopolistic; see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 7:175, and M.

<p>You once sent me an <hi rend="italic">Evans</hi>, did you not; &#x201C;a small modern Book&#x201D;? Which I <hi rend="italic">left</hi> for you at Llandough, when I was there?&#x2014; If so, and you can again lay hands on it, I will ask you to look at p. 181, and see what there is. &#x2018;Humphry Hook&#x2019; Alderman of Bristol, a &#x2018;Monopolist&#x2019; and as such dismissed from the Long Parl<hi rend="italic">t</hi>,&#x2014;has got a Letter from Cromwell in his favour (sorrow on him!) and concerns me for a moment.&#x2014; &#x2014; If you can find nothing; neither <hi rend="italic">Evans</hi> nor p. 181, nor Humphry Hook,&#x2014;let it even rest so, in the name of Oblivion; and Hook shall do with what light he has!&#x2014;</p>
<p>These new Letters of Cromwell, hardly of any intrinsic consequence at all, but necessary to be intercalated <hi rend="italic">without</hi> hurting the Book, occasion me infinite bother. With Printers in the rear, and paper-clippings up to the chin, I am again in a pickle! But it is piety to the Memory of a Hero; and this time it <hi rend="italic">shall</hi> be the last. One must be patient for a month or two!&#x2014;</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Last night I received your Letter; I had got an agreeable little Note from Jean, about the same business, by the morning Post. I am very glad poor little Jenny has got a promising place for herself at Dumfries: it was much the eligiblest for her of all the proposed Towns; and I have a hope she will find it do well for her. Let her in all ways be encouraged, poor little Sister Jenny, and given to understand that she shall not be deserted, but screened and helped, while she conducts herself as heretofore.&#x2014; I rejoice greatly to hear from all sides that our Mother&#x2019;s health is so tolerable this winter. She might write a little Note herself some day;&#x2014;but I suppose she is busier than usual, and thinks <hi rend="italic">you</hi> are there to write. Tell me of Isabella too, next time. Scotsbrig must be much amended by these small acts of <pb id="pg-20-124" n="20:124"/>civilization: my half of the outlay they occasioned shall be very cheerfully sustained. Give Jamie two sovereigns for me, if that be the sum, and I will pay you when first there is opportunity. The Foot bridge is really the repair of a very ugly defect, which had lasted already far too long!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Carlyle wrote to Janet Hanning, [early <date when="1846-00-00">1846</date>]: &#x201C;We have got our roads somewhat repaired on the Middlebie side, &#x26; are to have a bridge over the burn on saturday first&#x201D; (MS: Yale).</note></p>

<p>I <hi rend="italic">bore</hi> along here, conquering as I can a very numerous and very despicable set of confusions, in behalf of this <hi rend="italic">last</hi> service for Oliver; which I promise myself shall be the <hi rend="italic">last</hi>, in the Letter way. I have now got to the end of the <hi rend="italic">Irish Campaign</hi>, all but one Piece which Christie is copying for me at the Museum,&#x2014;which, till I <hi rend="italic">see</hi> it, I cannot fully decide what to do with. There are some 30 new Letters introduced; must be a few more,&#x2014; but the remainder will not now occasion me so much difficulty. Of the <hi rend="italic">Daily News</hi> I know nothing by sight; and not much by hearing: I learn only, when Craik or some such man comes athwart me, that it is very commonplace, not considered to be a promising affair &#x26;c &#x26;c Indeed few speak of it, I think.

<p>Sunday, yes my Beneficent, it shall be then:&#x2014;the dark man shall again see the daughter of the Sun, for a little while; and be illuminated, as if he were not dark! Which he very justly reckons among the highest privileges he has at present. Poor creature!&#x2014;</p>

<salute>Dear Jean,</salute>
<p>I got your good Letter, and was very well satisfied indeed at what you had done for Jenny. I think she can hardly fail to be much more wholesomely situated there, now that she has herself resolved on it, than she ever was at Gill.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Janet Hanning was moving to Maxwelltown, opp. Dumfries on the river Nith; see <ref target="volume-20/lt-18460303-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1846-03-03">3 March</date></ref>.</note> I need not commend you to look affectionately towards her always, and do for our poor little innocent Sister whatever your happier situation puts in your power. She may be well assured of backing and support from those that are bound to her; you can let her understand this in what<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Page(s) missing.</note></p>
<p><pb id="pg-20-127" n="20:127"/>John&#x2019;s Proposal and the manful sad answer to it has made me also sad. Of the actual &#x201C;Letter in <date when="1846-05-00">May</date>&#x201D; I did not hear; but of the Proposal I have often had to hear,&#x2014;and could and can treat it in no other way than as utterly unwise!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Carlyle&#x2019;s proposal is unknown, but possibly an offer of money to Alexander Carlyle, which was refused; see <ref target="volume-20/lt-18460303-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1846-03-03">3 March</date></ref>.</note>&#x2014;</p>
<p>We are decidedly of opinion here that Jenny should <hi rend="italic">not</hi> be made acquainted with that Hanning business.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Apparently Alexander Carlyle had sent some discreditable news about Robert Hanning; see <ref target="volume-20/lt-18460303-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1846-03-03">3 March</date></ref>.</note> She would interpret it her own way, in spite of all that <hi rend="italic">we</hi> could say. Our course is, Not to mention the name of that scamp any more, if we can help it. If her own sense in silence will not guide her to some just estimate of him, words of ours will only make the matter more insoluble for her.</p>

<p>I must not complain; I am bound to rejoice rather: but I did not so much need the new money I am to get; and I can honestly say the feeling of faithfulness to a hero&#x2019;s great memory and to my own small task in regard to that is nearly the only consideration that practically weighs with me. The unmusical or musical voice of critics, totally ignorant of the matter for most part, and of most insincere nature at any rate, gives me little pain and little pleasure any more. We shall be dead soon, and then it is only the fact of our work that will speak for us through all eternity. One thing I do recognise with much satisfaction, that the general verdict of our poor loose public seems to be that Oliver <hi rend="italic">was</hi> a genuine man, and if so, surely to them a very surprising one.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Admiration of <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> had emanated from unlikely sources.

I know not if a more commanding word has been spoken by Mortal since Cromwell&#x2019;s time. It is counsel for all men. All my past reading seems languid and pale beside those strenuous and flashing thoughts of Carlyle. It comes quite opportunely too. Cromwell and his Time are admirable studies for us, fierce Republicans as we are; and may help us see the vast difference between Royal Self-Rule and a Government of Brutes and Clowns. His time is a Class of ours. Our Country is no less charged with Revolt, no less luxuriant the crop of Unbelief. Sorcery and Confusions dire, shooting forth in the Social Hotbed. Our fortunes too seem fearfully forecast in those of the English Commonwealth&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Letters of A. Bronson Alcott</hi>, ed. R. L. Herrnstadt [Ames, Iowa, <date when="1969-00-00">1969</date>] 125).</note> It will do them much good, poor bewildered blockheads, <pb id="pg-20-128" n="20:128"/>to understand that no great man was ever other; that this notion of theirs about &#x201C;Machiavelism,&#x201D; &#x201C;Policy,&#x201D; and so forth, is on the whole what one might call blasphemous&#x2014;a real doctrine of devils.</p>

<p>Writing or not writing, my devotions, in good weather and in bad, are very constant. <closer><salute>Good be with you, Lady dear.</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute><hi rend="small-caps">My dear Mrs</hi>. <hi rend="small-caps">Welsh</hi>,&#x2014;</salute>Curiously enough the thought you impute to me; &#x2018;what mishap has befallen her now&#x2019; was <hi rend="italic">the very</hi> thought that passed thro&#x2019; my mind in opening your letter: but without reference to <hi rend="italic">you</hi> the least in the world! the idea of any new sorrow having happened to <hi rend="italic">you</hi> would have put itself into some kinder words. The fact is, your handwriting <pb id="pg-20-129" n="20:129"/>is very similar to that of a German friend of mine, here in London, from whom I hardly ever receive a note except to tell me something has gone wrong with her&#x2014;thro&#x2019; the cruelty of Destiny as <hi rend="italic">she</hi> thinks&#x2014;thro&#x2019; her own want of patience and commonsense say others. Accordingly when I came to the words &#x2018;only unqualified good to tell of&#x2019; and &#x2018;quite naturalized in this family&#x2019; I stopt in astonishment and said to myself; &#x2018;Miss B&#xF6;lte must be <hi rend="italic">going to die!&#x2019;</hi> nothing short of what we call &#x2018;<foreign>fee</foreign> [on the verge of death]&#x2019; in Scotland, could have made <hi rend="italic">her</hi> sensible of any &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">good</hi>&#x2019; in her lot, or satisfied with people&#x2019;s treatment of her&#x2014; (She is a Governess this Miss B&#xF6;lte&#x2014; much esteemed in every family she has lived in&#x2014;but too <hi rend="italic">exacting</hi> ever to be content with the best treatment that one can get <hi rend="italic">in a conditional</hi> World<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; from Goethe, <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister, Works</hi> 24:37, but also see <ref target="volume-18/lt-18440711-TC-JADO-01"><sic>18:120</sic><corr>TC to JADO, <date when="1844-07-11">11 July 1844</date></corr></ref>.</note>)&#x2014; Then my eye lighted on the date&#x2014;and the puzzle was cleared up at once!&#x2014;for it was just as <hi rend="italic">like you</hi> as it was <hi rend="italic">unlike her</hi> to make the best of things&#x2014;and to get the better of Destiny by a patient, hopeful, loving heart. Oh yes my dear friend you <hi rend="italic">have much</hi> to be thankful for! thro&#x2019; all your troubles which might have saddened and embittered many a one, so as to have destroyed all her future comfort and usefulness in life, <hi rend="italic">you</hi> have not <hi rend="italic">lost</hi> but <hi rend="italic">gained</hi>, in all that is most essential in life! When I think of you as I first knew you&#x2014;a pretty gentle girl, but without any apparent capability for getting thro&#x2019; the world, otherwise than by the help of others and the favour of a mild Destiny, and compare you as you were then with what I see you now&#x2014;a thoughtful, quietly courageous, cheerfully and lovingly struggling <hi rend="italic">woman</hi>, I can hardly regret for you the stern trials which have been the means of working this advancement. Not that I give all the credit of your present manner of being to <hi rend="italic">Misfortune!</hi>&#x2014;had the good qualities not <hi rend="italic">lain in you</hi> even misfortune could not have developed them&#x2014;we see plenty of people from whom trials seem only to take away the little strength they had to begin with&#x2014; But had you been left to lead a tolerably easy life with my poor uncle&#x2014;carried along by <hi rend="italic">him</hi>, instead of having him to nurse and comfort and then to supply his place to helpless children&#x2014;had you even never known the harassing cares of downright poverty&#x2014;and been forced to look into your own soul to see what possible help lay there&#x2014;and into the soul of what one calls <hi rend="italic">Society</hi> to see how <hi rend="italic">there</hi>, no help lies except for those who can help themselves&#x2014;if all that had not been, I doubt if you would ever have grown into the estimable woman which all your late letters to me prove you to be. One thing I especially love you for&#x2014;the way in which you speak&#x2014;or rather&#x2014;do <hi rend="italic">not</hi> speak of Mrs. Robert!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Welsh, widow of JWC&#x2019;s paternal uncle Robert; see <ref target="volume-14/lt-18420708-JWC-MW-01"><sic>14:217</sic><corr>JWC to MW, <date when="1842-07-08">8 July 1842</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014;the bitterest expressions respecting that woman would have been excusable from you&#x2014;but how much better is your silence!&#x2014; When one can so bear injustice, one is in a <pb id="pg-20-130" n="20:130"/>manner proof against injustice. I fear the money-advantages she has endeavoured to secure for her children will be sorely counterbalanced by the taint of dishonour they are coupled with, and by the example of a self-seeking unjust Mother. Her eldest son John<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John May Welsh.</note> showed himself to me last spring&#x2014;and until I am pretty well assured of his having <hi rend="italic">entirely altered his figure</hi> will never be seen&#x2014;willingly&#x2014;by me again!&#x2014; He wrote me a most flourishing letter, all about &#x2018;natural affection&#x2019; and that sort of thing&#x2014;concluding with an intimation that he intended shortly to be in London <hi rend="italic">or a few days</hi> and hoped to be permitted to <hi rend="italic">renew</hi> or acquaintance&#x2014;commenced at four years old on <hi rend="italic">his</hi> side.</p>
<p>Tho&#x2019; my Husband&#x2019;s extreme occupation at the time, as well as the quiet and regular habits of a studious man&#x2019;s house were against my receiving a young, and <hi rend="italic">probably restless</hi> and <hi rend="italic">certainly</hi> sight-seeing stranger into it, I nevertheless let myself be seduced by his professions of &#x2018;natural affection&#x2019;; and urging on myself that if he was his Mother&#x2019;s son he was also his Father&#x2019;s and my Uncle&#x2019;s, I wrote inviting him to occupy my spare room during his stay&#x2014;a position instantly accepted in a style that showed me the former letter had been written with no other motive but to provide himself a lodging free of expense&#x2014; He arrived in due course&#x2014;I was horribly agitated in the first moment of seeing him&#x2014;so many old thoughts hung on him! but the first five minutes satisfied me that I had found no <hi rend="italic">cousin</hi> here except in name. In fact one stood amazed before the obtuse assurance and barefaced egoism of that boy! He contradicted my husband&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">lectured</hi> him even, as if he had been the Angel Gabriel come amongst us! all my visitors he tried a wrestle at accursed Edinb. Logic with&#x2014;whilst <hi rend="italic">they</hi> were wondering at what ignorant savage I had picked up!&#x2014; The <hi rend="italic">wittiest</hi> and most high-bred woman of her time&#x2014;a woman who is a sort of queen in London society&#x2014;and <hi rend="italic">deservedly</hi>&#x2014; the Lady Harriet Baring&#x2014;coming to tea one vening&#x2014;was <hi rend="italic">put to rights</hi> at every word&#x2014;one might say <hi rend="italic">bullied</hi> by this presumptuous youth as if she had had no more sense than a clucking hen! He staid <hi rend="italic">three weeks!</hi> keeping me sitting up at nights for him till two and three in the morning&#x2014;rushing out in without regard to anyone&#x2019;s convenience but his own&#x2014;and finally took himself off&#x2014;leaving me privately determined never to suffer him to sleep under my roof again thro&#x2019; all eternity.</p>
<p>We are going on here much as usual&#x2014;my husband busy over the 2nd edition of his Cromwell&#x2014;and I doing the best I can in a state of health that never can be called good&#x2014; This winter however I have avoided colds&#x2014; partly from the mildness of the season and partly from having been out of London during <date when="1845-11-00">November</date> and <date when="1845-12-00">December</date> our most trying months&#x2014;we <pb id="pg-20-131" n="20:131"/>were staying opposite the Isle of Wight at a beautiful place close on the Sea&#x2014;with that same Lady Harriet Baring whom John Welsh <hi rend="italic">amused</hi> beyond all the <hi rend="italic">savage animals</hi> that she had ever seen! I went to Liverpool in <date when="1845-07-00">July</date> and remained till <date when="1845-09-00">September</date> at another sea place&#x2014;Seaforth House&#x2014; six miles from Liverpool with a Mrs. Paulet who is one of my dearest friends. <hi rend="italic">Now,</hi> I hope we shall be stationary a while&#x2014;for I cannot get used at all to the London fashion. &#x2026;

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Dr Christie will present you a certificate which I have drawn up for him; every word of which I wish to have understood as true. If you need any service of the kind now or afterwards; or failing that for the present, you could give him any direction as to how and when be might apply with hope of employment,&#x2014;you would do a benefit to a man of real merit, and to others who may stand in need of one like him.</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>This is American Post-day; and tho&#x2019; they are probably writing you from Scotsbrig where Jack still is, yet I know you will like to see a short line from me also; and so here I send one,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; my time is literally measured by <hi rend="italic">minutes,</hi> and you must put up with merely a word.</p>
<p>We got your Letters here last month, directly after they had been at Scotsbrig: your reply to Jack&#x2019;s Letter (which was very kind, but I think not <pb id="pg-20-132" n="20:132"/>very wise) affected us deeply;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-20/lt-18460222-TC-JCA-01">TC to JCA, <date when="1846-02-22">22 Feb.</date></ref></note> filled us with approval. Your resolution on it is manful; good and genuine; and you will not fail yet to reap the benefit of that piece of virtue. No:&#x2014;in fact, my dear Brother, it grows with every Letter more apparent to me that you are doing well and nobly in your new place; and, in spite of all your sorrow, are <hi rend="italic">prospering</hi> much more than many who count their gains by much larger figures of arithmetic than yours! Never mind a whit what &#x2018;monies&#x2019; you make or fail to make: that is not the question at all. So long as you stand on your own feet by your own industrious toil and the bounty of our common Father alone, no man is <hi rend="italic">richer</hi> than you in the money sense; many are not half so rich. Wretched slaves with big bags of dollars or guineas; and not a thought or a purpose within the skin of them that can make a <hi rend="italic">man</hi> rich! Plough the Earth, my Brother, and comport yourself like a wise husband, father and man; and never mind all that.&#x2014;</p>
<p>I have to observe also how very much your writing is improved. You <hi rend="italic">spell</hi> now nearly with perfect accuracy; write currently in a clear excellent fashion&#x2014;and really tell one a good clear story about all things. I want you farther to get some blacker <hi rend="italic">ink</hi>, and some good paper: you will then send us many <hi rend="italic">long</hi> pieces I hope, of which we shall all get enjoyment and benefit by and by. Your descriptions of the Country and its ways are far the most intelligible to me I have ever read.</p>
<p>I have to gratify you by news that our friends in Scotland are all reported well; our good old Mother &#x201C;better this winter than she has been for a number of years.&#x201D; The good old Mother!&#x2014; Jack as I said is still there; very gratifying to her, I have no doubt; in spite of the considerable racket he will keep up.&#x2014; Jenny has decided on removing to Dumfries at Whitsunday; has got a small commodious place to live in, &#x201C;looking out upon green ground,&#x201D; somewhere in Maxwelltown. We all think she will do better there: be on her own footing at least; perhaps get some <hi rend="italic">sewing</hi> work, and be in nobody&#x2019;s way. She has behaved herself to perfection all along, poor little Jenny. We judged that it might be best <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to tell her what you had seen of the wretched Scamp she is connected with.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Hanning.</note> There has never come any profit from mentioning his name to her: and by a kind of tacit accord all mention of him is avoided by all of us. He will probably write himself to her; and on the whole, it is on <hi rend="italic">her own sense</hi> that she must depend for forming a judgement of him.</p>
<p>My terrible <hi rend="italic">hurry</hi> with this Second Edition of <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> will not last so very long now. Perhaps in two months the things will be quite finished. There is new matter going into it; and my <foreign><hi rend="italic">fash</hi></foreign> [bother] is reall<supplied>[y]</supplied> enormous <pb id="pg-20-133" n="20:133"/>at present.&#x2014; I could like well to hear that you had ever got your Copy from Montreal. But if you have not, never mind over much. You shall at any rate have a Copy of the new Edition sent by some good conveyance,&#x2014;and that will be better. They are making a great noise about it here; which seems to me somewhat strange. Dear Brother, my paper is done; my time is more than done! Jane has come in here from her walk; she sends many kind loves to you all, especially to her namesake Jane the Second. <closer><salute>Blessings be with you and yours, dear Brother!&#x2014; Ev<supplied>[er]</supplied> your affectionate</salute></closer> <name>T.

<salute>Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I want news again out of Annandale; it is not that I can promise you much or almost anything of my own, in such a confusion as I am still surrounded with! I believe I have a natural <hi rend="italic">talent for being in a hurry</hi>; which is a very bad talent. I might go along much more leisurely at present: yet I am always in a bustle; always feel as if, except at the top of my speed I were not making any progress at all.&#x2014; You must send me some farther tidings of Scotsbrig and my Mother, and what you are all about there: that is the purport of my writing at present. I wrote a hasty sheet to Alick today too, as well as many things else: and I wind up the night with this little word of request to you.</p>
<p>The Printers have got pretty well thro&#x2019; the First Volume; have some of their men busy upon the second, I believe. I, for my part of it, am got into the second Invasion of Scotland as far as Dunbar Battle:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC evidently wrote to Samuel Aitken, who replied <date when="1846-03-16">16 March</date> about &#x201C;the location of Long Niddery, near Musselburgh,&#x201D; where part of Cromwell&#x2019;s army is said to have been camped before the battle of Dunbar. Aitken&#x2019;s letter is said to be inserted in TC&#x2019;s copy of Daniel Neal, <hi rend="italic">The History of the Puritans</hi> (<date when="1754-00-00">1754</date>), bequeathed to Harvard (W. C. Lane, <hi rend="italic">The Carlyle Collection</hi> [No. 26, Harvard Lib. Bibliographical Contributions; Cambridge, Mass., <date when="1884-00-00">1884</date>] 4).</note> I have clapt-in a variety of things; got the <hi rend="italic">Supplement</hi> to First Edit<hi rend="italic">n</hi> &#x26;c organised: and on the whole seem as if I had the back of the work broken; as if after about a month more of <foreign><hi rend="italic">fiking</hi></foreign> [bothering about trifles] and <foreign><hi rend="italic">cobbling</hi></foreign> (in a most painful <foreign><hi rend="italic">fasheous</hi></foreign> [troublesome] manner), I should have little left but to correct the Proofs that might remain. For my third volume is to have almost no change, that I yet know of. But something or other always starts <pb id="pg-20-134" n="20:134"/>up; and every new thing, is like fitting-in a new <hi rend="italic">stave</hi> into a made <hi rend="italic">stoup;</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Wooden pail for carrying water, narrower at the top.</note> an excessively unpleasant kind of work!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I got your Copy of the <hi rend="italic">Daily News:</hi> the only Copy I have yet seen of that Novelty. The Review seemed to me to be by Dickens;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The first no. of the <hi rend="italic">Daily News</hi> had appeared, <date when="1846-01-21">21 Jan.</date>; in <date when="1846-02-00">Feb.</date> Dickens resigned; he wrote no reviews for it.</note> and was all very well and good-natured, poor little <foreign><hi rend="italic">Schn&#xfc;spel</hi></foreign> [silly fellow]! I did not hear any body whisper a word about it. Somebody told me the other day that he, Dickens, had quitted the <hi rend="italic">Editorship</hi> of the Paper, being nearly worn to death by it; that Forster was now Editor; and on the whole that the concern was rather in a staggering state, as was supposed. Hardly anybody in our circle speaks of it at all.</p>
<p>Jane is gone up to Lady Harriet&#x2019;s tonight; the Lady sends her carriage of an evening for Jane, and they spend a couple of hours, talking, reading a thought of German (this I believe is rather <hi rend="italic">rare</hi>), more frequently playing <hi rend="italic">chess</hi> than doing German. Jane is sent home again between ten and eleven,&#x2014;safe by the same conveyance.</p>

<salute>Dear Emerson,</salute>
<p>I must write you a word before this Packet go, tho&#x2019; my haste is very great. I received your two Newspapers (price only twopence); by the same Ship there came, and reached me some days later, a Letter from Mr Everett enclosing the <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> portions of the same printed-matter, clipt out by scissors; written, it appeared, by Mr Everett&#x2019;s nephew;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edward Everett Hale (<date when="1822-00-00">1822</date>&#x2013;<date when="1909-00-00">1909</date>), American unitarian minister and author; ordained, <date when="1846-04-29">29 April</date>, Church of Unity, Worcester, Mass. He was to commemorate TC&#x2019;s death by his <hi rend="italic">Thomas Carlyle</hi>. A <hi rend="italic">Sermon Preached in Boston, <date when="1881-02-13">Feb. 13, 1881</date></hi> (Boston, <date when="1881-00-00">1881</date>). His father, Nathan Hale, had bought the <hi rend="italic">Boston Daily Advertiser</hi>, <date when="1814-00-00">1814</date>, and was ed. till <date when="1854-00-00">1854</date>. The <hi rend="italic">Advertiser</hi> gave a two-part review, &#x201C;Oliver Cromwell,&#x201D; 12 and <date when="1845-12-29">29 Dec. 1845</date>, and another notice, &#x201C;Letters and Speeches of Oliver Cromwell,&#x201D; <date when="1846-01-21">21 Jan.</date></note> some of whose remarks, especially his wish that I might once be in New England, and see people &#x2018;praying,&#x2019; amused me much! The Cotton Letter &#x26;c I have now got to the bottom of; Birch&#x2019;s Copy is in the Museum here,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A copy of John Cotton&#x2019;s letter (see <ref target="volume-20/lt-18460220-TC-GLC-01">TC to GLC, [ca. <date when="1846-02-20">20 Feb.</date>]</ref>) made by or for the historian Thomas Birch (<date when="1705-00-00">1705</date>&#x2013;<date when="1766-00-00">66</date>) was among the papers he bequeathed to the British Museum.</note>&#x2014;a better edition than I had.

The jingle of it, as it did at last get under way, and go down, was almost my one consolation in those unutterable operations.&#x2014; I am again over head and ears; but shall be out soon: never to return more.</p>
<p>By this Packet, according to volunteer contract, there goes out by the favour of your Chapman a number of Sheets, how many I do not exactly know, of the New Edition: Chapman First and Chapman Second (yours and mine)<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John and Edward, respectively.</note> have undertaken to manage the affair for this month and for the following months;&#x2014;many thanks to them both for taking it out of my hands. What you are to do with the article you already know. If no other customer present himself, can you signify to Mr Hart of Philadelphia<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Abraham Hart.</note> that the sheets are much at his service; his conduct on another occasion having given him right to such an acknowledgement from me? Or at any rate, <hi rend="italic">you</hi> will want a new Copy of this Book; and can retain the Sheets for that object.&#x2014; Enough of them.</p>
<p>From Mr Everett I learn that your Boston Lectures have been attended with renown enough: when are the Lectures themselves to get to print?<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not pbd. till <date when="1850-00-00">1850</date>, as <hi rend="italic">Representative Men</hi>.</note> I read, last night, an Essay on you, by a kind of &#x201C;Young Scotland&#x201D; as we might call it, in an Edinburgh Magazine; very fond of you, but shocked that you were Antichristian:&#x2014;really not so bad.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The unsigned and wide-ranging review of Hugh Murray, <hi rend="italic">The United States of America</hi>, 3 vols.

Perhaps TC knew who the reviewer was. The Wellesley Index identifies him as William Cunningham (<date when="1805-00-00">1805</date>&#x2013;<date when="1861-00-00">61</date>; <ref target="volume-20/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/6937"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), prof. of church history, New College, Edinburgh, a strict Calvinist and evangelical, and an active controversialist; but not in any sense a representative of &#x201C;Young Scotland,&#x201D; on the analogy of &#x201C;Young Italy&#x201D; or &#x201C;Young Ireland.&#x201D;</note> The stupidities of men go crossing one another; and miles down, at the bottom of all, there is a little veinlet of sense found running at last!&#x2014;</p>
<p>If you see Mr Everett, will you thank him for his kind remembrance of me, till I find leisure (as I have vainly hoped today to do) to thank him more in form.

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Your old Newspaper came in time, and just barely in time, to get the Cromwell Letter cut from it, and stuck in beside another of the like purport and like address, which I had got from an Attorney at Warrington in Lancashire: thanks to you for it!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Laing&#x2019;s letter is of <date when="1648-08-23">23 Aug. 1648</date> (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 6:354&#x2013;55, and <hi rend="italic">Supplement</hi>, 41&#x2013;42), as from &#x201C;Newspaper, <hi rend="italic">Packets of Letters from Scotland and the North</hi>, no. 24 (London, printed by Robert Ibbitson in Smithfield, <date when="1648-08-29">29th August, 1648</date>). &#x201C;The attorney was &#x201C;W. Beaumont, Esq., Warrington,&#x201D; and his letter was of <date when="1648-08-20">20 Aug. 1648</date> (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 6:353&#x2013;54, <hi rend="italic">Supplement</hi>, 40&#x2013;41).</note> I send the Newspaper back, having no farther need of it. The gathering of these old Letters is like that of the Valley of Jehosaphat!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Joel 3:2.</note> My one prayer is, that I were out of it again,&#x2014; forever.</p>
<p>In Clarendon State-Papers ii (Oxford <date when="1773-00-00">1773</date>) 551&#x2013;2, is a Letter from Oliver to Col<hi rend="italic">l</hi> Strahan the <hi rend="italic">Remonstrant</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Protester</hi>, which I am about to insert (at p. 78 vol ii). I have tried as I could to find <hi rend="italic">Strahan&#x2019;s</hi> Letter with the &#x201C;Six Queries&#x201D; that were in it: but have not yet succeeded, and have no sure hope of succeeding&#x2014;except thro&#x2019; you.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC did not find the letter, but gives the queries and Cromwell&#x2019;s letter &#x201C;To Colonel Strahan,&#x201D; <date when="1650-10-25">25 Oct. 1650</date>, in <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 7:250&#x2013;53. Archibald Strahan or Strachan (d. <date when="1652-00-00">1652</date>) served under Cromwell at Preston and fought against him at Dunbar. The Remonstrants or Protesters were extreme convenanters who, in a Remonstrance of <date when="1650-10-17">17 Oct. 1650</date>, denounced more moderate covenanters, and who, though still his allies, suspected Charles II&#x2019;s attitude toward the Covenant. Strahan was to rejoin Cromwell.</note> Pray look at it; and help me if you easily can. A <hi rend="italic">correct reference</hi> to any Book or Collection where Strahan&#x2019;s Letter may exist, would accomplish the most of my desire: I do not suppose the Letter itself to be worth much, or indeed almost anything except as elucidatory of this Cromwell one; but if you have a Clerk at hand, I would gladly pay him for a Copy. Give me the reference at least if you can,&#x2014;and some short abstract so far as it may bear of<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> this <hi rend="italic">reply</hi> of Cromwell&#x2019;s to it.</p>

Four nights in one week I never <hi rend="italic">once</hi> closed my eyes, and <hi rend="italic">henbane</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A sedative for nervous irritability.</note> even in large quantities of no more use to me than cold water&#x2014; The consequence was such a state of nervous excitation as nobody ever saw me in before&#x2014;Carlyle declares me to have been &#x201C;quite mad&#x201D; for half an hour&#x2014;and I can well believe him&#x2014;I have for a long while back been dreadful haunted with the apprehension of going <hi rend="italic">mad</hi> some day&#x2014;and I am only too thankful to have got off with &#x201C;half an hour&#x201D; of it thus far. For the last week I have been sleeping&#x2014;and in the reactionary state&#x2014; that is to say <hi rend="italic">dead stupid</hi>. Oh! the blessedness of <hi rend="italic">stupidity</hi> at times! I feel as if I would not make &#x201C;a wit&#x201D; just now for fifty guineas. On the 20th I am going with Lady Harriet to Addiscombe for a month. and that will be good for me I suppose&#x2014; Carlyle is so hard at work that he will not miss me&#x2014; besides if he takes a notion of seeing me at any time he can be there by railway in half an hour&#x2014; We two <hi rend="italic">women</hi> go alone&#x2014; M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Baring&#x2014;and Charles Buller of course&#x2014;will be there on the Saturdays and Sundays&#x2014; &#x2014; And we are to come up to town once a week <hi rend="italic">for two hours</hi>, her Ladyship to take a Drawing lesson(!) I to bless my family with a sight of me and regulate the weeks accounts&#x2014; If all proceeds according to Programme it will be a pleasant month but I cannot fancy Lady Harriet anywhere leading <hi rend="italic">a life of privacy</hi>; however she may propose it to herself She needs the excitement of company, imagining all the while that she is bored with it&#x2014;and so many people are ready to follow her into Siberia&#x2014;if she chose to take her flight even there!&#x2014; She is &#x201C;a bit of fascination&#x201D; (as the Countryman said of &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Tagg</hi>lioni&#x201D;) a very <hi rend="italic">large bit</hi>. I profess never to this hour to have arrived at a complete understanding of her&#x2014;but <hi rend="italic">that</hi> I fancy is just a part of her fascination&#x2014;the insoluble phsycological puzzle which she is and bids fair to remain for me!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC&#x2019;s apparently changing response to Lady Harriet is reflected in Jewsbury&#x2019;s letter to JWC, [<date when="1846-02-23">23 Feb.</date>], cited earlier, and in her letter of [<date when="1846-03-07">7 March</date>]: &#x201C;I fancy if she ever lets you into her inner case, you would only find just what has been tormenting and dragging your own life out of you. &#x2026; I cannot help fancying that Lady [Harriet] cares a great deal more for you than you suspect&#x201D; (Ireland 197).</note></p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I have received the Annotated Sheets this day;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC had sent parts of <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> dealing with Ireland to Duffy; see <ref target="volume-20/lt-18460119-TC-CGD-01">TC to CGD, <date when="1846-01-19">19 Jan</date></ref>.</note> and am abundantly sensible of the trouble you have taken,&#x2014;in reference especially to such a matter, which many good feelings in you, in the <hi rend="italic">twilight</hi> we yet look at it under, call upon you to hate and not to love! In spite of all obstructions, my <pb id="pg-20-141" n="20:141"/>fixed hope is, that just men, Irish and English, will yet see it as God the Maker saw it; which I think will really be a very point gained for all of us, on both sides of the Water. It is not every day that the Supreme Powers send any <hi rend="italic">Missionary</hi>, clad in light or clad in lightning, into a Country, to act and speak a True Thing there:&#x2014;and the sooner all of us get to understand, to the bottom, what it was that <hi rend="italic">he</hi> acted and spoke, it will most infallibly be the better every way! Nations, and men, that <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> understand Heaven&#x2019;s Message, because (which very often happens) it is not agreeable to them,&#x2014;alas, the <hi rend="italic">sum</hi> of all National and Human <hi rend="italic">sins</hi> lies there; and our frightful doom is, &#x201C;To follow the message of the <hi rend="italic">other</hi> place, then!&#x201D;&#x2014; &#x2014; I believe you to be a good man, and one of the Chosen of Ireland, or I would not write these things to you. Certainly if you could abolish the scene of <hi rend="italic">Portnadown Bridge</hi>,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Early in <date when="1641-11-00">Nov. 1641</date> at least eighty protestants, including children, were murdered by rebels at Portadown bridge, ca. 9 mi. NE of Armagh. The incident has been much discussed and disputed, as have the events of the <date when="1641-00-00">1641</date> rebellion. Robert Kee writes that &#x201C;on balance historians seem to think that about 12,000 Protestant men, women, and children were either murdered or died in the early days of the <date when="1641-00-00">1641</date> rebellion,&#x201D; and notes that &#x201C;to this day&#x201D; Belfast Orange Ledge banners display colorful representations of the Portadown massacre (<hi rend="italic">Ireland: A History</hi> [<date when="1980-00-00">1980</date>] 42&#x2013;44).</note> and other such, out of my mind, you would do <hi rend="italic">me</hi> a real kindness; and indeed it is mostly gone, or altogether gone, out of the memory of England, fierce as it once stood there: but out of the memory of Ireland it ought never to go&#x2014;Oh no, not till Ireland be very much other than it yet is! And a just and faithful Son of Ireland has something quite other to do with it than tell his countrymen to <hi rend="italic">forget</hi> it.</p>
<p>I also find, on evidence which you will see by and by, that the Wexford &#x2018;200 women,&#x2019; the &#x2018;massacre&#x2019; at Tredah,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-20/lt-18460119-TC-CGD-01">TC to CGD, <date when="1846-01-19">19 Jan.</date></ref>, and <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 7:63&#x2013;64. &#x201C;By the strict rules of war,&#x201D; sparingly invoked and apparently not what Cromwell chiefly felt justified him, he &#x201C;had the right to refuse quarter to a town carried by storm after rejecting a call to surrender&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">A New History of Ireland</hi>, ed. T. W. Moody, F. X. Martin, and F. J. Byrne [Oxford, <date when="1976-00-00">1976</date>] 3:340).</note> and indeed any massacre at all on Cromwell&#x2019;s part,&#x2014;is indisputable <hi rend="italic">Fable</hi>; and can do nothing but <hi rend="italic">mischief</hi> till it vanish from all heads and tongues. You, I believe, are individually as far lifted above the rubbish of Papistry as I am above that of Protestantry;&#x2014; and might <hi rend="italic">understand</hi>, by much meditating, what it was that Cromwell (a man also lifted far above all &#x201C;rubbish,&#x201D; in his time) did <hi rend="italic">mean</hi>, and the eternal Heaven along with him, in Ireland:&#x2014;if you cannot, there is no other Irishman yet born, I suppose, that can;&#x2014;and we shall have to wait for him; perhaps with terrible penalties for his not being here!</p>
<p>Some friendly critic upbraids me, on one of those sheets, That I do not admit the Irish to be a Nation. Really and truly that is the fact. I cannot find that the Irish were in <date when="1641-00-00">1641</date>, are now, or until they conquer all the English, <pb id="pg-20-142" n="20:142"/>ever again can be, &#x201C;a Nation,&#x201D; anything but an integral constituent <hi rend="italic">Part</hi> of a Nation,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Meaning not just that the Act of Union (<date when="1801-00">1801</date>) joined Ireland to Britain but that the Irish were not one nation any more than, as TC saw it, Scotland was before the Reformation, when it was &#x201C;a poor barren country, full of continued broils, dissensions, massacrings; a people in the last state of rudeness and destitution, little better perhaps than Ireland at this day &#x2026; a country as yet without a soul&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Heroes, Works</hi> 5:144).</note>&#x2014;any more than the Scotch Highlands can, than the Parish of Kensington can. Alas, the Laws of <hi rend="italic">Nature</hi> in regard to such matters (what used to be called God&#x2019;s Laws) are very diff<hi rend="italic">t</hi> indeed from those written down in Books of Sentiment;&#x2014;as many a poor Polander, and the like, finds to his cost!&#x2014; &#x2014; Nay, do not stamp this Note under your feet:&#x2014;or at least pick it up again; and read my thanks, my real regard for you&#x2014;and best wishes in all things.</p>
<closer><salute>Yours very sincerely /</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name>
<ps><p>The Printer I believe has most of the &#x2018;Irish Campaign&#x2019; in types: but I will profit carefully by your corrections still.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Which were mainly topographical, but, says Duffy, along with them &#x201C;I sent him some notes on the character of Owen Roe O&#x2019;Neill [<date when="1590-00-00">1590</date>?&#x2013;<date when="1649-00-00">1649</date>], the general on whom the Irish relied at that era but who died &#x2026; before Cromwell landed in Ireland&#x201D; (15).

<salute>My dear good Mother,</salute>
<p>I am getting on better here than, I suppose, you sometimes apprehend <pb id="pg-20-143" n="20:143"/>by my blameworthy silences. In fact, it is not strenuous heavy labour at all that I have to do with; it is rather infinite <foreign><hi rend="italic">fash</hi></foreign> and <foreign><hi rend="italic">fikery</hi></foreign> [concern with detail], writing innumerable Notes to stupid people &#x26;c &#x26;c, which provokes me much, and consumes all my time.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Correspondents continued to press their help on TC, some foolish such as an anonymous or &#x201C;unknown Commentator,&#x201D; who sent, <date when="1846-03-03">3 March</date>, assurance of his admiration for Cromwell and his &#x201C;painstaking perfect Editor.&#x201D; Others were more helpful. John William King of Dublin sent, on behalf of Edward Crawford of Dublin, a copy of Cromwell&#x2019;s letter to the commander-in-chief of Wexford (now in <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 7:76, where Crawford is acknowledged). King wrote TC, <date when="1846-03-10">10 March</date>: &#x201C;Its publication will tend to extinguish the lying fable of the slaughter of three hundred virgins at that siege&#x2014;a lie industriously propagated to malign the character of the Illustrious Dead and having no authority to rest upon but that of Lingard.&#x201D;</note> However, the Printer is now fairly done with the First Volume; and <hi rend="italic">I</hi> have, this moment, got done with the Second, and have it all ready for him; and as for the Third Volume, it is a much lighter job, and requires very little in comparison. So about ten days hence, I expect really to have only the <hi rend="italic">Appendix</hi> to do;&#x2014;and in no great length of time to be free of that also; and have only Proofsheets to read; which will give me a deal more of leisure, and be a very welcome change!&#x2014; I have added some 45 Letters or more;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-20/lt-18451228-TC-DL-01">TC to DL, <date when="1845-12-28">28 Dec. 1845</date></ref>.</note> and done the Book no ill. Some of the new Letters you will like much: indeed I am not sure but you will have to read the whole Book again!&#x2014; Considering the frivolous humour of most men, it is matter of great surprise to me how so many have taken to read this Book; and how very universally my char<supplied>[acter of the man]</supplied> has been recognised as actually <supplied>[correct.]</supplied> So I must not grudge my labour upon it. In all probability this is the usefullest business I shall ever get to do in the world; this of rescuing the memory of a Noble and Thricenoble Man from its disfigurement, and presenting him again to a world that stands much in need of the like of him: I do not know any worthier work a poor Son of Adam that pretends to write at all could <hi rend="italic">do</hi>, in the writing way!&#x2014;</p>
<p>We have beautiful Spring weather here, tho&#x2019; occasionally dim: I stay much within doors, and heed little the external babblements of Corn-Law and the like. Indeed I <supplied>[do not think of]</supplied> them. I go up to visit the <supplied>[Baring family]</supplied> once a week and that is almost my only outgoing.&#x2014; Jane is going with the Lady Harriet out to the Country, next week, about ten miles off; to stay for a month, going and coming: I too am to go and come occasionally. It is a very pleasant place, and will do her good. You can tell John: The Paulets have about done with their Eye-doctor; are to go &#x201C;next Tuesday.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Dear Mother, I wish you would write me a little line, were it never so <hi rend="italic">shaky</hi>. I wish at least somebody would tell me specifically how you are! Take care of the cold East winds; they are not good at this season; take care of yourself, dear Mother!&#x2014; I will write again soon. Thank John for his <pb id="pg-20-144" n="20:144"/>Letter; and bid him send another. <closer><salute>My blessing to you all. Jane is out, and cannot send her regards. Ever your affectionate</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>You once kindly pointed out to me Three Letters of Cromwell&#x2019;s given in a Book called <hi rend="italic">Bibliotheca Gloucestrensis;</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-19/lt-18450105-TC-JHA-01">TC to <sic>JH</sic><corr>JHA</corr>, <date when="1845-01-05">5 Jan. 1845</date></ref>.</note> which Book (a very ignorant one) I am acquainted with, but have not by me. Neither can I now find among your old Notes the precise indications of those Three Letters. For the first edition of my Book I had, it may be presumed, found them unsuitable,&#x2014;some Official kind of Burgh matter, or else in my possession already otherwise;&#x2014;and so had thrown them aside. For this second Edition, however, which is to have an Appendix, it is possible they might not be altogether inadmissable: at all events, I should like to see the Documents themselves again, and try.</p>
<p>As you are always very ready to Oblige me, perhaps it will be my shortest method to ask if you could be so helpful as copy me the Letters out of that <hi rend="italic">Bibliotheca</hi>;&#x2014;on Paper of sufficient size, and written only on one side; with as few <hi rend="italic">contractions</hi> as you like. I mean, that there be room for interlineation &#x26;c, in case the Articles <hi rend="italic">be</hi> sent to the Printer.&#x2014; &#x2014; I have indication likewise of an &#x201C;Oliver Letter&#x201D; (most probably some totally worthless, official rag) of date &#x201C;Whitehall <date when="1657-12-02">2 De<hi rend="italic">cr</hi> 1657</date>,&#x201D;&#x2014;printed in <hi rend="italic">a</hi> Bristol Guide!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 9:294, where the source given is the <hi rend="italic">Bibliotheca Gloucestrensis</hi>.</note> If you <hi rend="italic">happen</hi> to know this, this too might be sent: but if you do not, by no means think of going in chase of it thro&#x2019; such a <foreign><hi rend="italic">terra incognita</hi></foreign>. The rather as I can get it elsewhere, at the mere expense of writing a new Letter.</p>
<p>This new Edition is to be in Three Volumes: I have already done two of them, and the Printer has done one. The botheration and confusion of such a business is nearly unendurable; not to be fronted, in fact, except for the sake of an Oliver. I have had to introduce some forty or fifty new Letters into the body of the Text (of which new Letters you will get a separate Copy); an operation&#x2014;which in fact I never will repeat for any cause!</p>
<p>I looked over Mr Dawson&#x2019;s Lectures, for most part, as they arrived; but could not form much image or conjecture about him or his audience out of <pb id="pg-20-145" n="20:145"/>them,&#x2014;except that he seemed to have a really great capacity of utterance.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Because of doctrinal differences with his congregation at Mt. Zion Baptist Chapel, Birmingham, George Dawson left his ministry there at the end of <date when="1845-00-00">1845</date>. Many of his supporters undertook to build him a new chapel in Birmingham, where he would be free to preach as he liked. While this Church of the Saviour was being built, his congregation met in temporary quarters, and he continued to gain fame in the north of England as a remarkable lecturer on literary and historical subjects. Alexander Ireland, as director of the Manchester Athenaeum, had asked him to lecture there, beginning in <date when="1846-01-00">Jan.</date> with a series on TC, which he repeated for the Sheffield Mechanics Inst., <date when="1846-03-02">2</date>&#x2013;<date when="1846-03-04">4 March</date>. The <hi rend="italic">Manchester Guardian</hi> reported that the first Athenaeum lecture was &#x201C;altogether one of the most extraordinary and deeply interesting extemporaneous addresses we have ever heard&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Biographical Lectures by George Dawson</hi>, ed. G. St. Clair [<date when="1886-00-00">1886</date>], pref. vi; see also its &#x201C;The Genius and Works of Thomas Carlyle&#x201D; 354&#x2013;437, which ends with the criticism that &#x201C;there is a misty religionism rather than a clearly defined religion&#x201D; about TC). Yet Dawson is said to have done more than anyone to aid &#x201C;in popularising the theories of Carlyle&#x201D; (W. Wilson, <hi rend="italic">The Life of George Dawson</hi> [Birmingham, <date when="1905-00-00">1905</date>] 212). Dawson himself was to set out his strong demand for freedom of belief in his sermon <hi rend="italic">The Demands of the Age Upon the Church</hi> (<date when="1847-00-00">1847</date>) when his new church opened, <date when="1847-08-08">8 Aug. 1847</date>; he asked for freedom of thought, Christian unity, brotherhood, and equality, and even &#x201C;a Church for THE DOUBTERS. In nothing is there more necessity for reform than in this. &#x2026; Many whose belief has become afterwards strong, have had to &#x2026; feel the &#x2018;Everlasting No&#x2019; before they came &#x2026; to a land of belief&#x201D; (13, 26). It brought down on him the severe disapproval of the orthodox, but Harland became his friend as well as admirer, and used his skill as a shorthand reporter to make verbatim reports of Dawson&#x2019;s lectures in the <hi rend="italic">Manchester Guardian</hi> from <date when="1850-00-00">1850</date> (Wilson, <hi rend="italic">Life</hi> 159).</note> Which is something; but by no means the best thing!&#x2014;<closer><salute>Yours always truly</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I was very glad of your Letter the other night:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dated Scotsbrig, <date when="1846-03-18">18 March</date>.</note> an image lay in it for me of many old Annandale things. Poor Grahame with his &#x201C;O Whow!&#x201D; Tom Thomson and his poor Wife whom I remember thirty years back:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Carlyle said that he and William Graham had ridden to Rammerscales, a mansion in Dalton parish, Dumfriesshire: &#x201C;A dull ride &#x2026; no conversation being possible. Interruptions of <hi rend="italic">Ohwhow!</hi> &#x26; a bundle of sorrows &#x26; obstructions very grievous to hear. Now that Grahames position at Burnswark seems defined &#x26; certain for life he looks more depressed than ever.&#x201D; Thomas Hunter Thomson (d. <date when="1853-00-00">1853</date>; see <ref target="volume-03/lt-18251215-TC-JAC-01"><sic>3:434</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1825-12-15">15 Dec. 1825</date></corr></ref>), minister of Dalton, 4 mi. W of Ecclefechan. His wife, Elizabeth, b. Ramsay (d. <date when="1848-00-00">1848</date>), m. <date when="1823-00-00">1823</date>, had &#x201C;quite recovered from her derangement&#x201D;; since the death of their only son, John (<date when="1823-00-00">1823</date>&#x2013;<date when="1843-00-00">43</date>), she had &#x201C;taken to studying Sanskrit &#x2026; knows Greek, Hebrew &#x26;c &#x26; gets therefrom some suitable nourishment &#x26; occupation.&#x201D;</note> all these things were significant to me. And the Linn Road, it appears, is actually getting mended; we shall not be in danger of tumbling into the Caldron henceforth!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Linn is a waterfall nr. Scotsbrig. The Cauldron is a pool at its foot.</note>&#x2014; I liked very much the wild sad-featured Spring I had in Dumfriesshire, after a long interval, some years ago.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In <date when="1841-04-00">April 1841</date>.</note></p>
<p>I wish I could send you my Horse up! But he is coming here; and I do not want him: to be obliged to go riding every day, in these tumultuous roads, is a real bother. We are making some arrangements with the Stable-people Nodes for a <hi rend="italic">neat fly</hi> to put the animal in; this I think will take effect; and Jane shall then mainly have the riding of him.&#x2014; John Chorley has sold his horse: at worst I can sell mine, and so be rid; but I do not quite like to do <pb id="pg-20-148" n="20:148"/>that yet. We are speculating often about getting out altogether into the Country to live; which I do believe would be a great improvement. Do you never hear of any eligible dwelling in the Annandale or Dumfries region? One is now free to go almost anywhither; railways are ready for one everywhere.&#x2014; I wish you would look after little Jenny, and the furnishing of her bit house: see that due encouragement be given her, poor little Jenny, and I will be prompt and thankful with my part of it.</p>
<p>Little Espinasse, who has been useful to me of late in the Museum, quarrelled the other day with Panizzi, and threw up his situation. I tried to advise a reconciliation, hope it is not yet desperate; but have not seen poor E. for a day or two. He is a very intelligent honest little fellow; but of atrabiliar humour, shy, fierce, and very proud. He talked of returning to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> again, where, I doubt, there is little for him.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Espinasse left the British Museum in part because he did not like Panizzi, who had been made Keeper of Printed Books over the head of TC&#x2019;s friend the Rev. Henry Cary, a move that &#x201C;gave great dissatisfaction to the English world of letters in general&#x201D; (Espinasse 15). Espinasse found him overbearing, inclined to favoritism, and sycophantic to those in higher authority. TC apparently disliked both Panizzi (though he did not know him) and what Espinasse called the museum&#x2019;s &#x201C;confused and almost chaotic catalogue&#x201D; (72), which it was Panizzi&#x2019;s task to remake, so &#x201C;sympathy and antipathy combined to induce him to interest himself in my behalf&#x201D; (113). In fact, Panizzi was an admirable librarian, and not all their objections were justified.</note>&#x2014; Robertson and the Paulets came here the other night; the Paulets to <hi rend="italic">take leave:</hi> R<hi rend="italic">n</hi> looked very <foreign><hi rend="italic">bursten</hi></foreign> [tired out], not unlike Blackguardism in some features. It chanced there came at the very same time &#x201C;Mrs Richardson&#x201D; (whom you have forgotten?) the disconsolate Indian Widow, who wrote me two Letters.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Otherwise unidentified. John Carlyle replied, [<date when="1846-03-23">23 March</date>]: &#x201C;Would that I had been on the spot to see your &#x2018;beautiful &#x26; interesting little widow whose letters I recollect quite well!&#x201D;</note> An exceedingly beautiful little woman, of perhaps 25; has already by mere time got wonderfully &#x201C;consoled,&#x201D;&#x2014;and we suppose will soon marry again. She <hi rend="italic">sang</hi> with Mrs Paulet, and we had a pleasant enough evening.&#x2014; &#x2014; Anthony Sterling has just come home: his Wife fell raging mad at Rome; he was obliged to bring her off by force, an English Doctor with him &#x26;c,&#x2014; the journey thence &#x2018;costing &#xa3;600.<supplied>[&#x2019;]</supplied><note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Quotation mark omitted.</note> She is now a little calmer; he purposes still to keep her at home; has sent the children to Brighton for that end.

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I was very glad indeed to see your dear old hand again, and to hear such good news of you.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Her letter undated but sent with John Carlyle&#x2019;s of <date when="1846-03-18">18 March</date> in an envelope (PM: <date when="1846-03-19">19 March</date>) addressed by TC, on which he later added; (old Letter <hi rend="italic">to</hi> me; / from One &#x2014;&#x2014;!&#x201D;</note> John&#x2019;s Letter also was very good and entertaining: it is not every evening that I get so pleasant a message as that, after dinner.</p>
<p>Today I send you a small Gift, which you must get yourself something good with. You say always, You want for nothing;&#x2014;but there are always bits of things one would be the better for: so I pray you, dear Mother, do me this kindness, and let me think I have procured you some little comfortable thing which would not have been there otherwise! Surely I have a good right to do it, if any man ever had. And now when money is not at all so scarce with me as we have known it, and things are beginning to look a little prosperous on the money side,&#x2014;shame and woe on me if I forget you who love and would have loved me ever truly, had I been reduced to beg my bread, nay I suppose to die on the gallows! It is not every one that has such a Mother. For which, as for one of the chiefest mercies allotted to a man, I desire to be always thankful.</p>
<p>My Cromwell work is not quite so far advanced as I hoped it would be: but on the whole there is no such breathless haste; I may plod on, more at my leisure if I like. Today too there has occurred an interruption. Last night we had to go and dine with the Ashburtons (whom the Dr can explain to you); a grandish affair, very late and <hi rend="italic">unwholesome;</hi> which has lamed me somewhat. And now Jane is going off to the Country (a place about 10 or 12 miles off<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Addiscombe.</note>) to stay for three weeks or so with their Daughter-in-law, the Lady Harriet;&#x2014;and I, as it turns out, am to escort her thither this day: to go off at 4 o&#x2019;clock; and not return till <hi rend="italic">Monday</hi>, perhaps Monday Evening;&#x2014;so if your Newspapers are somewhat late, you will understand what the matter is. Nothing wrong, you may hope! I had much rather have staid at home today; but it won&#x2019;t do so I must be content.&#x2014; The weather is very cold and blustery: yesterday morning we had two inches of excellent <hi rend="italic">snow;</hi> but it went all off again in the course of the day. I pray you take care of yourself dear Mother; this weather is very bad for everybody. I could like to know more specially how Isabella is too. John will tell you what news there are. <closer><salute>Blessings with you all.</salute></closer></p>

Perhaps from it M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Forster may be able to decide whether M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Espinasse possesses intelligence adequate for the kind of employment he is in search of.&#x2014;&#x201D;</note> and next day your charity is to be so far drawn upon as to receive, for a few minutes, if you can, the young man himself. Pray do not grudge him; do him a little good, poor fellow, if you can!</p>
<p>You already guess he wants to be employed in that kind of business; in any kind of literary business he may seem fit for. Of his fitness in that particular I can say nothing; but will testify freely that he is an honest-hearted, ingenious and ingenuous young man; knows German, and all manner of Edinburgh knowledges and tongues; has lived three years here, under Panizzi&#x2019;s wing, from which he has at last broken loose,&#x2014;being, as you will see, of a shy proud temper, not without affections, not without indignations:&#x2014;in short he seems a good young man; fit, one would say, for various kinds of work; and certainly very eager to try!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of TC&#x2019;s introduction of him to John Forster, Espinasse wrote: &#x201C;Goethe has said somewhere that the most trying situation for a man is to find himself in completely altered circumstances without being mentally and otherwise in the least prepared for the change. One fine day this was my painful predicament. With goodwill towards me Carlyle harboured a strong dislike for the person [Panizzi] to whom the perplexities of my position were mainly due, so that sympathy and antipathy combined to induce him to interest himself in my behalf. &#x2026; He offered &#x2026; to introduce me &#x2026; to two friends of his, both of them connected with the newspaper press, John Forster and John Robertson. / Forster was then one of the busiest of London journalists, and Carlyle&#x2019;s influence was needed to procure for an obscure aspirant easy access to him. &#x2026; It is also true that he imitated in everyday life the stage mannerism of Macready, &#x2026; <supplied>[the]</supplied> &#x2018;great tragedian,&#x2019; of whom he was the intimate friend. I remember being in this way rather overpowered at one of my first interviews with him. I called on him by appointment, and he kept me a few minutes waiting. Then he strode into the room and striking an attitude, exclaimed in a tragic tone: &#x2018;It is with infinite regret that I have caused you this delay. Believe me,&#x2019; and here he placed his hand upon his heart, &#x2018;I feel it sensibly&#x2019;&#x201D; (Espinasse 113&#x2013;16).</note> Pray say a wise word to him<supplied>[;]</supplied> you can throw some light on his path, which doubtless is abstruse enough at present: for my sake be kind to him if you have any outlook of <pb id="pg-20-151" n="20:151"/>help; at all events, be candid, and severe as Rhadamanthus,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Who, in Greek mythology, showed so much justice in life that in death he became a judge in the underworld.</note> if you have none. Like a charitable man as you are.</p>
<p>I have nearly ended this unspeakable Second Edition: no such job ever came my way in this world before. A transcendent species of <hi rend="italic">Cobbling;</hi> no higher craft! To which one is not altogether bred. I shall remember it while I live.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Too late for the <hi rend="italic">Supplement</hi> or second edn. was a letter (now in <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 9:233, where its owner is acknowledged) sent to TC by the Rev. W. S. Spring Caseborn, of Newhouse, Pakenham, nr. Ixworth, <date when="1846-03-18">18 March 1846</date>: &#x201C;I received your note through our friend M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Donaldson this afternoon. / It gives me great pleasure to comply with the request you make. On reading your work a few weeks ago, I regretted we had not previously communicated with each other. / I trust my copy is exact.&#x201D;</note></p>
<p>My Wife has mainly quitted me for four weeks to come; went on Saturday last, to Addiscombe in the Croydon region, to the people we were with in Hampshire;&#x2014;is to come and go, while I continue a bachelor here. Up to the chin in Paper-clippings, and not very far from distracted</p>

<p><salute>Dear good Wifie,</salute> I am very lonely here without thee;&#x2014;oppressed with Cromwell shoe-parings, bad spirits and many considerations. I have done three Proof-sheets; and a despicable fraction of a Letter, worth nothing, and cramp to manage as if it were a Petrarch&#x2019;s sonnet. It is now 4 o&#x2019;clock; and I must out without saying anything.</p>
<p>Yesterday I dined exclusively on <hi rend="italic">soup</hi>. Slept well, and in spite of my spirits am better today. Little Espinasse had not come when in dropped little Ballantyne of Manchester, last night. A fine cheery sensible &#x201C;bit Paisley body&#x201D;!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Ballantyne was from Paisley.</note> They kept me idle the whole evening; and tired me to the <pb id="pg-20-152" n="20:152"/>edge of sleep.

<p>These Letters, all but Buller&#x2019;s to which I answer Yes,&#x2014;were waiting for me yesterday. None for thee; till these two this morning. I have another nearly unreadable Letter, about some small Cromwell matter, from Lord Lovelace (that is the Byron Son-in-law?)&#x2014;which so soon as I have done with it shall come; tomorrow probably. Burn the rest; with or without reading. Nickisson&#x2019;s people have brought down the Shilling Magazine;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George William Nickisson, publisher of <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine</hi> and bookseller, 215 Regent St. Jewsbury&#x2019;s &#x201C;Today,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Douglas Jerrold&#x2019;s Shilling Magazine</hi> 3:223&#x2013;25, the first of four articles signed &#x201C;G.E.J.&#x201D; pbd. there.

<p><salute>Dear Goody,&#x2014;</salute>I am a very wearied Good! <hi rend="italic">Four</hi> Proofsheets (two of them not yet quite done); a visit of Miss Wilson; a <hi rend="italic">talking</hi> walk with Helps, a talking Tea with Dodds&#x2014;<foreign><hi rend="italic">ach Gott!</hi></foreign> And I awoke with a headache, and have been stupid, spiritless, and not <hi rend="italic">happy</hi>, all day!&#x2014; They are going on at a brave rate with the Book, thank Heaven!

<p>Your Letter came at 3 o&#x2019;clock. I know not when this will reach you: one may hope, tomorrow morning, almost as soon as if I had sent it off in the afternoon. I did surely mean to come tomorrow, and even do still; but really am in such wretched case, I know not what to say about it. I should have written to the Lady giving some account of myself. <hi rend="italic">Dinner</hi> there does not seem at all probable; and I tried in vain today to ascertain the times of the <hi rend="italic">Croydon</hi> railway: some way or other it is like I shall come.&#x2014; Miss Wilson&#x2019;s visit was for a Dinner with Courances or Currants or whatever <pb id="pg-20-153" n="20:153"/>they are called;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably Francis Thomas Corrance (<date when="1781-00-00">1781</date>&#x2013;<date when="1850-00-00">1850</date>), vicar of Great Glenn, Leicestershire, <date when="1814-00-00">1814</date>&#x2013;<date when="1850-00-00">50</date>, and his wife, not further identified.

<p>No Letters today, but one for an autograph (bless the mark!), and an assignation with Helps. Creek joined us in the lanes:&#x2014;the <hi rend="italic">sky</hi> at least was heavenly: let there be no reflexions.&#x2014; I have sent Helen to bed; have hot milk simmering on the hob; and will now to the Post-Office, and not say another word. <closer><salute>God&#x2019;s blessing be on all people,&#x2014;poor Goody especially.</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle</salute>
<p>Carlyle has sent me the enclosed letter, with a hint to forward it to you. For me, I am so used to Lady-adorers of all sorts turning up for him, that the fact of a new one or of a new half dozen occasions me no particular emotion. my chief thought about them, is whether they will not sooner or later be left on <hi rend="italic">my</hi> hands&#x2014;for he makes no conscience of turning them over to <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, whenever he finds them becoming bores to himself&#x2014; This one however seems a good woman enough &#x201C;an owl innocently&#x201D; as she modestly says of herself&#x2014; At all events her letter gives me a natural occasion for giving you my kind regards at first hand&#x2014;</p>
<p>I am glad to hear you have got over the winter so well&#x2014; I also have been unusually well&#x2014;in the matter of colds at least&#x2014;and for the rest&#x2014;the headachs and all that sort of things, like the pigs to having their throats cut, one &#x201C;gets used to it.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech.</note></p>
<p>I have been here for a week with Lady Harriet Baring whom you have doubtless heard Carlyle speak of with enthusiasm. A very clever woman, and very lovable besides&#x2014;whom it is very pleasant to live with&#x2014;if she likes you&#x2014;and if she does not like you, she would blow you up with gunpowder rather than be bored with your company&#x2014; So that one clearly understands one&#x2019;s footing beside her.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC probably expressed less unease to Margaret Carlyle than she may have done to Geraldine Jewsbury, who wrote to JWC, [<date when="1846-03-07">7 March</date>]: &#x201C;What you tell me of her now just squares with what I had figured to myself from your former letter. &#x2026; She is good for you; she has had long practice in standing on her own basis. &#x2026; &#x201D; (Ireland 196). JWC and Jewsbury seemed to agree that William Baring&#x2019;s seriousness, &#x201C;shyness,&#x201D; and &#x201C;lavish submission&#x201D; (as Lord Houghton speaks of his qualities as a husband in his <hi rend="italic">Monographs</hi> [<date when="1873-00-00">1873</date>] 234&#x2013;35) were not dissimilar to TC&#x2019;s.</note> I am to stay three weeks longer until she returns <pb id="pg-20-154" n="20:154"/>to town and Carlyle comes on the Saturdays and goes back on Mondays&#x2014; Generally Charles Buller also&#x2014; The second edition of the book will soon be done it is to be hoped&#x2014;for Carlyle has worked too hard at it and is got quite out of strength and spirit&#x2014; His horse is to return next week and that will at least force him to take more exercise&#x2014;being too much inbued with our national virtue <hi rend="italic">thrift</hi> to let it stand in the stable eating off its own head, as the phrase is&#x2014;</p>

<salute>Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I got your Letter, with much thankfulness to hear that my Mother and all the rest of you were going on well. I have been terribly busy all week, and am still! The Printers, going on like a whirlwind, have sent me <hi rend="italic">seven sheets</hi> since Tuesday morning;&#x2014;very troublesome, one or two of them. They (the Printers) are about half thro&#x2019; the second volume: I suppose Chapman is in haste. We <hi rend="italic">shall</hi>, before long, have done; thank Heaven!</p>
<p>I am now just about setting off on foot to Addiscombe, where Jane is, where I have not seen her since Monday. I think the walk in the Spring day may do me good. I am considerably fagged; and have been in an infirm kind of condition all week. We are very quiet at Addiscombe; and the people very good to me.</p>
<p>Paulet has got <hi rend="italic">both</hi> his eyes; all right, safe in their blue spectacles now. Alexander did well in sum; but seems to be a kind of fool too. Jane has heard from Seaforth, not I; her Letter was forwarded unread by me the other day.&#x2014; &#x2014; <hi rend="italic">Dodds</hi>, of Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, was here last night; up on railway business; a prosperous Clerk: he had tea with me; was not bad company at all.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dodds was to move to London later in <date when="1846-00-00">1846</date> to become a Scottish parliamentary agent, the main part of his business being to help bring railway bills connected with Scotland before parliament.</note></p>
<p>My time is come for being off. This letter of yours came today. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, <pb id="pg-20-155" n="20:155"/>dear Brother. Commend me to my dear Mother,&#x2014;O be good to her; and to them all. Ever yours</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Nobody can well have less time than I at present! But it seems uncertain whether there is any Letter going for you by this Packet: so I, in never such haste, will send you a little fraction of a Line, to assure you that nothing has gone wrong here. I received that Note from Jack at Scotsbrig this morning: that will be an assurance to you, and well worth its postage by itself.&#x2014; Jenny, you perhaps know, is to flit into Dumfries at Whitsunday; she has got a small comfortable kind of house, they say, in Maxwelltown there. The <pb id="pg-20-157" n="20:157"/>rest of the hasty Note (Jack seldom writes <hi rend="italic">deliberately</hi>) you will understand by its own light.</p>
<p>I am still terribly busy with the Second Edition of this Book, and <hi rend="italic">new</hi> Letters I have got to crush into it: but now I am drawing towards the end of my difficulties in that. <hi rend="italic">Did</hi> your Copy ever come? I gave you the Montreal address (which I have forgotten now): but probably a <hi rend="italic">Yankee Copy</hi> was cheaper than the carriage of that other: they are selling it for a half-a-dollar in Yankeeland, tho&#x2019; it costs 36 / here.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-20/lt-18460102-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1846-01-02">2 Jan.</date></ref></note>&#x2014; The people have made a considerable buzz about it in this Country; and indeed I believe it will do them a great deal of good, poor blockheads:&#x2014;at all events, I am right glad it has nearly got out of my hands at last.</p>
<p>The people are toiling along in the most wearisome Debates about their Corn Law; which is very sure to <hi rend="italic">be</hi> abolished, as Peel has appointed: nothing can be more entirely wearisome than their &#x201C;debates&#x201D; upon it. And in the meanwhile there is an indubitable Famine coming upon Ireland; a Scarcity upon all places of this Empire: the potatoes are fast running out everywhere;&#x2014;and we are a good way off <date when="1846-08-00"><hi rend="italic">August</hi></date> yet! Our season hitherto is very good as to weather; and several weeks ahead of what it usually is in point of vegetation</p>
<p>Jane is staying out in the Country with some Friends, for a week or two; about ten miles off: she comes in on the Wednesdays; sees how I am getting on. She is pretty well in health; as I am too,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; much fagged. Dear Brother, you must write to some of us; if you have not very lately written! How are Jenny and the little new Stranger?<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A son, James Carlyle (<date when="1846-00-00">1846</date>&#x2013;<date when="1924-00-00">1924</date>). Marrs (629) quotes the &#x201C;Family History&#x201D;: &#x201C;After farming for a time he sold out and went to live in Toronto.&#x201D; He never married.</note> I have heard no tidings specially since that event. I suppose you too are busy in these Spring days; tilling the face of old Mother Earth,&#x2014;urging her, far off, by Annandale Art, to grow you a little corn! It is an honest function for a man, and God the Maker looks on it well-pleased! <closer><salute>I pray for all blessings on you, Dear Brother, here and hereafter. Ever Yours</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Mrs Wedgwood,</salute>
<p>I will by no means give up the hope of what you propose; but we must not try to name any day at present. At present, alas, I am in the death-throes of Printers&#x2019; Devils of unspeakable confusions; very unwell too;&#x2014;and obliged to shrink into the corner, and hide myself as deep as possible!</p>
<p>I have got my Horse back from the Country, in a very lean and rough condition; mean to get some old neat-fly or shandrydan, and set <hi rend="italic">my Wife</hi> to do the exercise of that untoward animal, and drive about with him! That <pb id="pg-20-159" n="20:159"/>will be the time for dining with Friends,&#x2014;then, when I have got my Second Edition done too, and am free of Cobbling for a while!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I have no idea Where the <hi rend="italic">Morning Post</hi> of half a century back, since it is not in the Museum, could be found. There is an Establishment called Peel&#x2019;s Coffeehouse where, I have heard, such things are kept.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >177&#x2013;78 Fleet St., founded early <date>eighteenth cent.</date>, where old newspapers were filed.</note> Has due trial been made there?</p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I have had the pleasure to receive your obliging Letter, with the Copy of the Vevey Epitaph, which I am very glad to possess by your kindness and Mr Erskine&#x2019;s.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Vevey is on the N shore of Lake Geneva, 11 mi. ESE of Lausanne. Erskine, presumably because of TC&#x2019;s reference to Ludlow&#x2019;s monument there (<hi rend="italic">Cromwell, Works</hi> 9:203&#x2013;4), had suggested to Vinet that he should send TC a copy of the inscription on Broughton&#x2019;s monument &#x201C;immediately&#x201D; for the second edn. (Bonnard 71).</note> Pray allow me to return many grateful acknowledgements; and if you write to Mr Erskine before I do,&#x2014;as is possible, your geographical position being favourable to correspondence at present,&#x2014;I will ask you to thank him also for this kind remembrance of me.</p>
<p>Andrew Broughton was Clerk of the Court for trial of the King, and <hi rend="italic">read</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Sentence</hi> of Charles Stuart: this I suppose is what the Epitaph may mean by &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Sententiam regis regum profari</hi></foreign>,&#x201D;&#x2014;intimating also obliquely that it was a <hi rend="italic">just</hi> sentence, ratified in Heaven by the &#x201C;King of Kings.&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The epitaph of Andrew Broughton (<date when="1603-00-00">1603</date>?&#x2013;<date when="1687-00-00">87</date>) over his tomb in the nave of the church of St. Martin at Vevey: &#x201C;<foreign>Depositorium / Andreae BROUGHTON, Armigeri, / Anglicani Maydstonensis / in comitatu Canty, / ubi bis praetor urbanus / dignatusque etiam fuit sen- / tentiam Regis Regum profari.

<salute>Dear Jean,</salute>
<p>Some ten days ago I sent you off a small bundle of very useless Books,&#x2014;which were not worth their carriage from Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>. I have meant, ever since, to enclose you 12 stamps, and cover that charge; and withal explain what was to be done with the Books: and behold, it is but now that I can muster for such an enterprise! Here are the <hi rend="italic">stamps;</hi> which you actually are to take without any grumbling; for the Books were, as I say, not worth their carriage. As for your disposing of them,&#x2014;send to my Mother the two Reviews of <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> (the Doctor may <hi rend="italic">suppress</hi> the rest of the &#x201C;Prospective Review,&#x201D; so soon as that part is read, I think!):<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >[John J. Tayler], &#x201C;Oliver Cromwell&#x2019;s Letters and Speeches,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Prospective Review</hi> 2 (<date when="1846-02-00">Feb. 1846</date>):119&#x2013;58. Its theology is assumed to be too liberal for TC&#x2019;s mother, since the opening review defends Robert Chambers&#x2019;s anon. <hi rend="italic">Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation</hi>.</note> and as for the others, I have forgotten what they rightly were; and have only to bid you keep them, or divide them with Scotsbrig Jamie,&#x2014;in short, do what you like with them.</p>
<p>I am thro&#x2019; the <hi rend="italic">Text</hi>, as they call it, of my Second Edition, after another <hi rend="italic">distressing</hi> struggle (for my whole impulse towards the job is spent, and converted into a kind of weariness and even <hi rend="italic">disgust</hi>,&#x2014;especially in these bilious spring months): and I am now fast working up the Appendix;&#x2014;the whole business, Printing and all, ought to be done, about a month hence, and the Book fairly <hi rend="italic">out</hi>. I need not now be in any hurry about it; all I have to do henceforth is mere tatters and tagraggery, about which for most part I can take my own time. But we are of a <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;hasting&#x201D;</hi> disposition: that was known of us from of old!&#x2014;</p>
<p>These are not healthy months; our weather too has been very wet, for ten days back, till yesterday: however, we hold out pretty well; struggling to keep out of the <hi rend="italic">noise</hi>, if one could, which is the worst element of all for a poor thinskinned creature like me! I am seriously thinking of getting away into the Country somewhere, to rest up there;&#x2014;but it is very difficult to do. One is fretted all raw, and cannot take kindly to any place. In poor old Scotland, when I come there, I feel myself very much like a <hi rend="italic">ghost</hi> now. Indeed I am getting very languid about many things; desirous chiefly to <hi rend="italic">keep quiet:</hi>&#x2014;in fact getting old, which I have a kind of right to do.&#x2014; Jane is away out of Town mostly these three weeks; some ten miles off, with the quality people we were guests of in winter: this gives me freer room for all manner of grave reflexions; they are not unprofitable at all. I go out every Saturday; but get myself all &#x201C;<foreign>dadded abreed</foreign> [shaken to pieces],&#x201D; by the <pb id="pg-20-162" n="20:162"/>foreign ways there; and come back no joyfuller than I went. Jane is to return in ten days now.&#x2014; &#x2014; I have got my Horse back, and was out today upon him: a bright day among the buds and blossoms I expect to grow fresher and fresher now; I have no intention but of working <hi rend="italic">very</hi> gently indeed thro&#x2019; the rest of the summer if this job were done.&#x2014; You may send this on to my Mother, or send her word about it: Jack and she were with you lately. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign> dear Sister. Blessings with one and all of you.</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name></p>

<salute>Dear Fitzgerald,</salute>
<p>I have now put the little Sketch of Naseby Fight, rough and ready, into its place in the Appendix:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-20/lt-18460119-TC-EF-01">TC to EF, <date when="1846-01-19">19 Jan.</date></ref></note> it really does pretty well, where it is fairly written out; had I had time for that, it might almost have gone into the Text,&#x2014;and perhaps shall, if I ever live to see another Edition. Naseby Field will then have its due honour;&#x2014;only you should actually raise a Stone over that Grave that you opened (I will give you the <hi rend="italic">shin-bone</hi> back and keep the <hi rend="italic">teeth</hi>):<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-19/lt-18450818-TC-EF-01">TC to EF, <date when="1845-08-18">18 Aug. 1845</date></ref>.</note> you really should,&#x2014;with a simple Inscription, saying merely in business English: &#x201C;Here, as proved by strict and not too impious examination, lie the Slain of the Battle of Naseby. Dig no farther. N.L.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;New Line.&#x201D;</note> E. Fitzgerald,&#x2014; &#x2014;<date when="1843-00-00">1843</date>.&#x201D;&#x2014; &#x2014; By the bye, <hi rend="italic">was</hi> it <date when="1843-00-00">1843</date>, or 2, when we did those Naseby feats? tell me, for I want to mark that in the Book. And so here is your Paper again, since at any rate you wish to keep that. I am serious about the Stone!</p>
<p>You sent me several Queries;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >FitzGerald wrote, [<date when="1846-01-22">22 Jan.</date>]: &#x201C;They all relate to the Civil War time.&#x201D; For his seven questions, see Terhune, <hi rend="italic">LEF</hi> 1:521.</note> of hardly above one of which could I at the moment say anything satisfactory: wherefore, being in huge haste, and known by you to be in such, I said nothing;&#x2014;waiting till you came to Town, and we could at leisure discuss the several affairs, by word of mouth, and clean pipes and good tobacco! Several things may be explained then!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >FitzGerald was in London from the end of <date when="1846-04-00">April</date> until <date when="1846-06-00">June</date>.</note>&#x2014;</p>
<p>I have had again a most distressing business with this Book of Cromwell, and the new Letters for it: but I must not grudge; Labour, I think, is <hi rend="italic">well</hi> invested there, a very safe place. Those <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> will most probably survive all my other Books, and my contemporaries&#x2019; other Books;&#x2014;and do more good perhaps than anything I ever tried or could try in the &#x201C;literary&#x201D; way. <pb id="pg-20-163" n="20:163"/>That is no extravagant supposition. If they put poor mortals off that thrice accursed notion of theirs, That every clever man in this world&#x2019;s affairs must be a bit of a liar too, the consequence would be invaluable! A truly accursed Notion; all false too; and a &#x201C;Doctrine of Devils,&#x201D; if there ever was one! Witness Peel, poor fellow, this day,&#x2014;to go no farther. I hope to do a little towards kicking that Notion into Chaos yet: we have had quite enough of it here in the terrestrial European regions, for a couple of centuries past!&#x2014;</p>
<p>W. Browne,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Kenworthy Browne.</note> the most courteous and obliging of men, has sent me back my Horse: I was on the brute today for the first time;&#x2014;thin and rough, but airy as a Kangeroo:<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> too airy, and be hanged to it! I think of yoking it into some old <foreign>shandrydan</foreign> [rickety old vehicle], and setting my Wife to tame it by driving: I really do.&#x2014; When are you coming up to Town? I expect to be well thro&#x2019; with the weight of this Printing business in a week or two: in about a month, they ought to have the Book <hi rend="italic">out</hi>.</p>

<p><salute>Dearest,&#x2014;</salute>I had your Note today to breakfast: with the exception of two hours when I rode and dined, I have been busy ever since; and it is now striking ten. Many Notes to write: a considerable gap, too, made in the Cromwell rubbish; it is fast disappearing before me. Heigho!&#x2014; But my existence is not now so haggard as it was for some days past: the sun is shining, the work going on, all day;&#x2014;one has many sad reflexions, but they are not unprofitable wholly, not the worse for being sad. &#x201C;No man <hi rend="italic">can</hi> help another!&#x201D; sighed the melancholy Pestalozzi.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi (<date when="1746-00-00">1746</date>&#x2013;<date when="1827-00-00">1827</date>), Swiss educational reformer.</note> Which is partly true, and yet not true; a kind and trustful word is very helpful from one to another. O my poor Goody, let us endeavour to <hi rend="italic">be</hi> wise and just and good: nothing <hi rend="italic">more</hi> is required of mortals! That is a fact one forgets sometimes.</p>
<p>I am very sorry to hear of you &#x201C;pitted against Chaos&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Apparently a phrase from her last letter.</note> all night, and coming off second-best. My poor little woman! But you will be home again soon; I will at least <hi rend="italic">try</hi> to help you against Chaos: now and henceforth as heretofore, I will do my best in that.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-20-164" n="20:164"/>For one thing, I really wish you <hi rend="italic">could</hi> find an eligible House somewhere out under the quiet sky,&#x2014;removed fairly from these tumults and loud-braying discords of every kind; which it is growing really horrible and miserable to me to spend the remnant of my days among! &#x201C;Like living in a Madhouse,&#x201D; as the Lady says. Truly so;&#x2014;and one has nothing to do with it either: one does <hi rend="italic">not</hi> subscribe to Hudson&#x2019;s Column-of-honour; one has no trade except disgust with all that! May the gods grant&#x2014;I was going to say; but it requires only that one&#x2019;s own mind &#x201C;grant,&#x201D; so soon as one has got to clearness on the matter.&#x2014;</p>
<p>Robertson came in last night before my two Proofs were done; consumed the whole evening for me. He had taken charitably to Espinasse; wanted consultation about that; wanted also to have me &#x2018;dine at the Reform Club&#x2019;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Liberal club, Pall Mall.</note> some day in my solitude, which latter project I diplomatically waved into the vague. For the rest, poor R. was looking decidedly less of the reprobate; told me about the <hi rend="italic">Daily News</hi>, about the &#x2018;Scotch-Entail Question&#x2019; &#x26;c:<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Since <date when="1685-00-00">1685</date> Scots law allowed the entail of land so that, though the heir in possession was the nominal proprietor, his powers of management were not much more than those of a life-renter. From <date when="1747-00-00">1747</date> to <date when="1845-00-00">1845</date> various acts relaxed the strictness of the entail; but the new Corn Law bill led to concern that the many holders of entailed property in Scotland would be particularly disadvantaged in meeting &#x201C;the expected competition of foreign corn,&#x201D; and a committee was set up, <date when="1846-03-12">12 March</date>, in Edinburgh to push for &#x201C;a legislative remedy for the evils of the entail law&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Caledonian Mercury</hi>, <date when="1846-03-16">16 March</date>). Eventually the Rutherford Act, <date when="1848-00-00">1848</date>, was to give the heir in possession the power to disentail.</note> and at last I got him away.&#x2014;&#x2014; No Letter much worth sending. Write to me what time dinner is on Saturday. My Horse seems thin enough, fresh off the straw: yet he is &#x2018;light and airy,&#x2019; almost reminds me of Mr Barings Kangaroo in lightness! It is one of my cheerfullest hopes to get <hi rend="italic">you</hi> and him well fixed in the shandrydan; and so be rid once for all! <closer><salute>Blessings on thee, and a better night.</salute></closer></p>

<p>How hast thou slept? Will there be no line this afternoon to tell? I fear not.

<p>Nothing come this morning but that poor Note from poor Brandes, to whom I have written a word of farewell: poor creature, I am really sorry for him.

<p>Thanks, Dearest, for your little <foreign><hi rend="italic">canty</hi></foreign> [cheerful] Letter: it helps me thro&#x2019; the solitude of my otherwise not very profitable day:&#x2014;day spent in cobbling-in <hi rend="italic">another</hi> Oliverism, which, accidentally turning up, duty importunately calls for!

<p>I hope you got your <hi rend="italic">Order,</hi> or rather her Ladyship&#x2019;s, safe; I hope I did not send <hi rend="italic">it</hi> to the Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Pipemaker, and the price of the Pipes to Addiscombe! But indeed I had both Letters <hi rend="italic">open</hi> in my pocket; and the day was wet, and Chorley, and the White-Owl<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >J. G. Cochrane at the London Library.</note> (on whom I had called for a taper and seal) were very confusing to me. No doubt, after all, it went. It serves for any <hi rend="italic">day</hi> to the Dulwich Gallery,&#x2014;was given me in exchange for Mr Baring&#x2019;s card without, I think, the expenditure of one word on the Colnaghi side.

<p>Here is a leaf slit from a Yankee Newspaper sent by Emerson; also a Letter from Emerson; both of which will be worth reading.

<salute>Dear Jean</salute>
<p>I was very glad of your Letter, which came to me duly the other evening in my solitude here. I believe I shall be better by and by,&#x2014;if indeed there were anything but <hi rend="italic">fatigue</hi> that ailed me at present:&#x2014;for I ride very diligently, on one of the liveliest black horses, 15 miles at a stretch; and the weather is often very bright and genial.

<salute>Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Your Letter has just come to hand: I hope you have got better again,&#x2014; the weather has been very bad here too; and this season of the year is in itself none of the healthiest as you know. We have much unconstant rain: this very day, out riding, I got myself wetted to the skin, and am now sitting in a thoroughly <hi rend="italic">fresh</hi> slough of apparel from the flannel outwards. Happily our Mother seems still not to be out of order materially: I think it a pity you have not something you can drive her with in a way she likes;&#x2014;will not gentle <hi rend="italic">methods</hi> make that Pony do gently for her?&#x2014; I heard from Jean the other day: all seemed well with her.</p>
<p>My lazy Printers are hardly yet thro&#x2019; the second volume: they will not be <hi rend="italic">done</hi> this day month, I doubt. I in a languid trailing way go on cobbling up the Appendix,&#x2014;which is not work at all; it is a mere picking of <hi rend="italic">work</hi> out of rubbish, and laying it down, to <hi rend="italic">be</hi> done if anybody liked. That is the law of it. I have it all done now except some four &#x201C;N<hi rend="italic">os</hi>,&#x201D; which need not take me above a day.&#x2014;&#x2014; Emerson has made me a bargain for this edit<hi rend="italic">n with Wiley and Putnam:</hi> no other would suit; and it seems to promise very fairly there. I must write to Emerson a small line tomorrow.&#x2014; You will likely see his Letter straightway, or perhaps have seen it: Jane was to send it, and a bit of a Yankee Newspaper, on to my Mother.</p>
<p>Tomorrow I go out to Addiscombe again; and we <hi rend="italic">all</hi> return on Monday: that ends the business for the present; which I am not sorry at. Most elegant people, and full of graceful kindness; but far too <hi rend="italic">idle</hi> in their ways for me.&#x2014; Did I tell you I dined one day with Cobden not long since? At Buller&#x2019;s here: Milnes, Stanley, Baring &#x26;c: C. is a clear, modest, very intelligent, but essentially not uncommon Manchester man. I got, as usual, an <hi rend="italic">indigestion</hi> by the business. Ude (now the <hi rend="italic">late</hi> Ude)<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Louis Eustace Ude, author of <hi rend="italic">The French Cook</hi> (<date when="1813-00-00">1813</date>, often reprinted).</note> and his Art, and all the wealth of Royal kitchens, are very superfluous for me!&#x2014; Plattnauer is gone quite mad again. Six weeks ago he broke into the Palace; said The Queen was just about to be confined,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Victoria was expecting a child, b. <date when="1846-05-25">25 May.</date></note> and had sent for him (man-midwife, I suppose?)&#x2014;he knocked down one of the ushers; was thereupon carried to the Police-office, and of course laid up somewhere; he was seen last week on the streets again, very mad-looking, but has not been here,&#x2014; poor creature!&#x2014; Old Sterling has had another fit or shock, had to be bled &#x26;c: he came here a week ago, looking pale and worn; poor old man, I think we shall lose him altogether soon. Anthony has since his return been very <pb id="pg-20-170" n="20:170"/>good to him; means to take him into his house; has already offered, and is trying to persuade, to <hi rend="italic">decide</hi> in fact whether it will be good for the old man himself. Mrs Anthony he tells me is getting very wild again: I have only seen him <hi rend="italic">once</hi> since the day after his return,&#x2014;he went one day to ride with me, and talked a good deal; I was very sorry for him on the whole.&#x2014; My horse, of which I think there was mention, performs very well; is perfectly good-natured, wonderfully swift for a <hi rend="italic">strawyard</hi> horse, in fact quite a galloper; and seems to be quitting all his old freaks as he gets acquainted with my sedate character. Yesterday I was at Dulwich; came upon Jane and the Baring Party at the Gallery there! They did not expect me, I partly knew of <hi rend="italic">them</hi>.&#x2014; Miss Lambert is thumping at a great rate!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mary Emily Lambert on the piano next door.</note> <closer><salute>Affection to my dear Mother and the rest; blessings on you all!&#x2014;</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Having again got a Note from Jack just last night, which in a rough way conveys the latest intelligence from Annandale, and an account of your Letter to me as received there,&#x2014;I will send it off, and a hasty word of my own to go with it. I did the like by last Packet: we should use the benefits of the Post-Office, when for a little coin it will carry friendly news in never so rough a state.</p>
<p>Your Letter by Boston came about a week ago,&#x2014;not conveyed, I think, by <hi rend="italic">steam:</hi> but right welcome when it did come. The &#x201C;price,&#x201D; which you ask after, was 8 pence: a very cheap price! Do not neglect to send us the smallest word when you can, whatever the price be.&#x2014; &#x2014; Your Letter pleased me much; and your new name of <hi rend="italic">Bield,</hi>&#x2014;&#x201C;better a wee bush than nae bield&#x201D;;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Proverbial. Bield means &#x201C;shelter.&#x201D;</note> across the Water too, the same great sky envelopes us all! I am very glad, and very sad both in one, to figure you toiling like a man, in your vocation, far away there. Brother Jack seems to lament that you are not merry of humour or of situation: alas, there is not any &#x201C;mirth&#x201D; for any of us any more! A serious heart can hope to be calm in this most serious world; but need not long to be joyful: joy is not our portion here; grim battle is; and some victory,&#x2014;and what of peaceable and good the Great Father, in the Eternities, has appointed for us, <hi rend="italic">after</hi> battle! Courage, my brave Brother. We will try to work well and wisely, whether sad or cheerful, each in his task here; and look not to changeful Fortune, but to something far beyond that, for our blessedness.&#x2014; And withal let us not be <hi rend="italic">sad,</hi> but quiet, clear and free; prepared for all things.</p>
<p>I also liked little Jane&#x2019;s Letter immensely! Poor little creature: it seems but yesterday when I first saw her on your knee at Scotsbrig, with little hands like her Father&#x2019;s; and now she is growing a young Canada lass, full of sense and spirit I see; and will do a pretty part there, I hope! The Letter is to be returned from Scotsbrig for Jane&#x2019;s (my Jane&#x2019;s) especial perusal, who being in the Country still has not yet seen it. She comes home now in two days; and that is ended. I have sent <hi rend="italic">little</hi> Jane a Newspaper today, or kind of three-halfpenny Journal, as memorial of me.</p>
<p>The Irish are starving; there will be bad work before the new food of the year can come! Our Parliament meanwhile goes on debating its Anti Corn-Law; perfectly plain that Peel must prevail,&#x2014;so that few people read their jargon: nevertheless there it goes on, and will go, it is said, throughout the whole Session.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The bill was going through the process of three readings in each of the Houses of Parliament, and it was bound to be carried eventually in the Commons, in spite of the almost savage opposition of the protectionist members of Peel&#x2019;s own conservative party. TC had now begun to appreciate Peel&#x2019;s integrity and the concern they shared for what Peel called &#x201C;the social condition of the masses of the population who earn their subsistence in the manufacturing towns. &#x201C;TC agreed with what Peel said, <date when="1846-03-27">27 March</date>, on the second reading: &#x201C;You may talk of improving the habits of the working classes, introducing education amongst them, purifying their dwellings, improving their cottages; but believe me the first step toward improvement of their social condition is an abundance of food.&#x201D; Peel&#x2019;s opponents hoped for rejection by the Lords, or possibly his defeat in the Commons on another issue.</note>&#x2014; I am very glad you got the Book on <hi rend="italic">Oliver</hi>, tho&#x2019; it cost <pb id="pg-20-172" n="20:172"/>you <hi rend="italic">enormously</hi>. An American Copy can be got for half a dollar! You shall have some way or other a Copy of the <hi rend="italic">Second edition</hi> free of cost: you can then give the First to Brother John if he care for it.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Their half-brother in Canada.</note> I go still fagging in attendance on my Printers: I think it will be a month yet or more before we end.

<salute>Dear Emerson,</salute>
<p>Your two Letters have both come to hand, the last of them only three days ago. One word in answer before the Packet sail; one very hasty word, rather than none.</p>
<p>You have made the best of Bargains for me; once again, with the freest contempt of trouble on my behalf; which I cannot sufficiently wonder at! Apparently it is a fixed-idea of yours that the Bibliopolic Genus shall not cheat me; and you are decided to make it good. Very well: let it be so, in as far as the Fates will.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson was angry with Wiley &#x26; Putnam and was trying to find another American publisher for the second edn. of <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi>. He enlisted the help of Horace Greeley, who wrote him, <date when="1846-03-17">17 March</date>, that nothing could be done: &#x201C;No&#x2014;we are beaten in this business and the fault is Carlyle&#x2019;s own. He ought to have known better than to give any one authority to throw away the American market for his book&#x201D;; see Slater, <hi rend="italic">CEC</hi> 394 and <ref target="volume-20/lt-18451229-TC-EC-01">TC to EC, <date when="1845-12-29">29 Dec. 1845</date></ref>. The difficulty was soon cleared up; see <ref target="volume-20/lt-18460430-TC-RWE-01">TC to RWE, <date when="1846-04-30">30 April</date></ref>.</note></p>
<p><pb id="pg-20-173" n="20:173"/>Certainly I will conform in all points to this Wiley-and-Putnam Treaty, and faithfully observe the same. The London Wileys have not yet sent me any tidings; but when they do, I will say Your terms on the other side of the sea are the Law to us, and it is a finished thing.&#x2014; No Sheets, I think, will go by this mid-month Packet, the Printer and Bookseller were bidden not mind that: but by the Packet of <date when="1846-05-03">May 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi></date>, I hope the Second Volume will go complete; and, if the Printers make speed, almost the whole remainder may go by the <date when="1846-06-00">June</date> one. There is to be a &#x201C;Supplement to the First Edition,&#x201D; containing all the new matter that is <hi rend="italic">separable:</hi> of this too the Wileys shall have their due Copy to reprint: it is what I could do to keep my faith with purchasers of the First Edition here; but, on the whole, there will be no emulating of the Second Edition except by a reprint of the whole of it; changes great and small have had to introduce themselves everywhere, as these new Letters were woven in.&#x2014; &#x2014; I hope before <date when="1846-05-03">May 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi></date>, I shall have ascertained whether it will not be the simplest way (as with my present light it clearly appears) to give the Sheets direct to the Wiley and Putnam here, and let <hi rend="italic">them</hi> send them? In any case, the cargo shall come one way or other.</p>
<p>Furthermore,&#x2014;yes, you shall have that Sun-shadow, a Daguerrotype likeness, as the sun shall please to paint it: there has often been talk of getting me to that establishment, but I never yet could go. If it be possible, we will have this also ready for the 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi> of <date when="1846-05-00">May.</date><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Reprod. frontispiece.</note>. <hi rend="italic">Provided</hi> you, as you promise, go and do likewise! A strange moment that, when I look upon your dead shadow again; instead of the living face, which remains unchanged within me, enveloped in beautiful clouds, and emerging now and then into strange clearness! Has your head grown greyish? On me are &#x201C;grey hairs here and there,&#x201D;&#x2014;and I do &#x201C;know it.&#x201D; I have lived half a century in this world, fifty years complete on the <date when="1845-12-04">4<hi rend="italic">th</hi> of December</date> last: that is a solemn fact for me! Few and evil have been the days of the years of thy servant,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Gen. 47:9.</note>&#x2014;few for any good that was ever done in them. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Ay de mi!</hi></foreign></p>
<p>Within late weeks I have got my Horse again; go riding thro&#x2019; the loud torrent of vehiculatory discords, till I get into the fields, into the green lanes; which is intrinsically a great medicine to me. Most comfortless riding it is, with a horse of such <hi rend="italic">Kangeroo</hi> disposition, till I do get to the sight of my old ever-young green-mantled Mother again; but for an hour there, it is a real blessing to me. I have company sometimes, but generally prefer solitude, and a dialogue with the trees and clouds. Alas, the speech <pb id="pg-20-174" n="20:174"/>of men, especially the witty-speech of man, is oftentimes afflictive to me: &#x201C;in the wide Earth,&#x201D; I say sometimes with a sigh, &#x201C;there is none but Emerson that responds to me with a voice wholly human!&#x201D; All &#x201C;Literature&#x201D; too is become I cannot tell you how contemptible to me. On the whole one&#x2019;s blessedness is to do as Oliver: Work while the sun is up; work <hi rend="italic">well</hi> as if Eternities depended on it; and then sleep,&#x2014;if under the guano-mountains of Human Stupor, if handsomely <hi rend="italic">forgotten</hi> all at once, that latter is the handsome thing! I have often thought what W. Shakspeare would say, were he to sit one night in a &#x201C;Shakspeare Society,&#x201D; and listen to the empty twaddle and other long-eared melody about him there!&#x2014;<foreign>Adieu</foreign>, my Friend. I fear I have forgotten many things: at all events, I have forgotten the inexorable Flight of the Minutes, which are numbered out to me at present. <closer><salute>Ever yours</salute></closer></p>

<ps><p>I think I recognise the Inspector of Wild-beasts, in the little Boston Newspaper you send! A small hatchet-faced grey-eyed goodhumoured Inspector, who came with a Translated Lafontaine, and took his survey not without satisfaction?<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Elizur Wright (<date when="1804-00-00">1804</date>&#x2013;<date when="1885-00-00">85</date>), American reformer, abolitionist, and actuary, had just returned from England, where he had peddled his trans. of the <hi rend="italic">Fables of La Fontaine</hi> (Boston, <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>), and was now ed. and publisher of the <hi rend="italic">Weekly Chronotype</hi>. In the issue of <date when="1846-03-18">18 March</date> he printed an account of his visit to TC: &#x201C;It was my special desire to sound him on the subject of chattel slavery. And I did, to the bottom, easily. The result would have delighted John C. Calhoun. He thinks men ought to be thankful to get themselves governed, if it is only done in a strong and resolute way&#x201D; (Slater, <hi rend="italic">CEC</hi> 396n).</note> Comfortable too how rapidly he fathomed the animal, having just poked him up a little. <foreign>Ach Gott!</foreign> Man is forever interesting to man;&#x2014;and all men, even hatchetfaces, are <hi rend="italic">globular</hi> and complete!</p></ps>

<salute>Dearest Babbie</salute>
<p>You are saying to yourself with as much of a sarcastic smile as your good little face is capable of; that I must have been full of occupation indeed, if <hi rend="italic">this</hi> be the &#x201C;first <hi rend="italic">possible hour</hi>&#x201D; for writing that has come to me. I do not however take my stand on a position so little tenabale&#x2014;several hours or at least quarters of hours &#x201C;came to pass&#x201D; (like Mazzini&#x2019;s sweep)<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-18/lt-18440625-JWC-TC-01"><sic>18:82</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1844-06-25">25 June 1844</date></corr></ref>.</note> during my last week at Addiscombe in which I <hi rend="italic">might</hi> have written to an indulgent Babbie&#x2014;but only with a mind all churned into froth, and since Monday evening that I have been here again, in my own quiet establishment, I have purposely put off, that my letter might get double welcome by reaching you on your Birthday.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1846-04-25">25 April</date>.</note> Good luck to it (the Birthday) my dear Babbie! And may the &#x201C;good resolutions&#x201D; which are <hi rend="italic">sure</hi> to come up in you on its advent not go altogether to the paving of the Place that is nameless! but some little fraction of them go to the building of a tight little wind-and-weather-proof house for the Babbies soul to live in long and happily. And here is a piece of <hi rend="italic">Lady&#x2019;s work</hi>&#x2014;of all things in the world&#x2014;to remind you that &#x201C;all is vanity&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Eccles. 1:2.</note>&#x2014;I confess I do not see much other <hi rend="italic">use</hi> it is for; but it is very beautiful; is it not!&#x2014; Is it the fruit of my intercourse with fine people?&#x2014;have <hi rend="italic">I</hi> at last taken into this sort of thing? Thanks God! No!&#x2014;I did not work a stitch of it&#x2014;and yet you may regard it as the proof of my active virtue or virtuous activity which you like&#x2014;for it was the <hi rend="italic">reward</hi> sent by the Gr&#xE4;fin von Reichenbach for my kindnesses to her Brother!&#x2014;which Brother, by the way, is again entirely distracted&#x2014;and what is some comfort&#x2014;his insanity has now taken a form which greatly diminishes one&#x2019;s interest in him&#x2014;the form namely of bottomless <hi rend="italic">vanity</hi>. The day before I went to Addiscombe&#x2014;a Gentleman with whom we were dining at Lord Ashburtons mentioned as the news of the day that a young Prussian&#x2014;Plattnauer by name, had just been forcing his way into Buckingham Palace and when laid hold of, and asked his business by Lord Somebody, had said &#x201C;the Queen was just going to be confined and had sent for <hi rend="italic">him&#x201D;!</hi> The Police had to be called in to remove him and he was carried away to the Marlbough Station House&#x2014; I looked in all the newspapers for some days to see the issue of the business&#x2014;to strike into it <hi rend="italic">practically</hi> with the prospect of figuring in Police-reports was more than human friendship felt <hi rend="italic">up to</hi>&#x2014; <pb id="pg-20-176" n="20:176"/>besides the Government takes excellent care of the <hi rend="italic">insane</hi> destitute however it may leave the <hi rend="italic">sane</hi> to shift for themselves only they must <hi rend="italic">seem</hi> to have <hi rend="italic">no friends</hi>&#x2014;otherwise the Government washes its hands of them. So that, unless I meant to take the charge of him again myself, I was doing best for his interest in leaving him in the hands into which he had fallen&#x2014; Somebody however must I suppose have interfered for the case did not appear in the newspapers&#x2014; A week ago M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Fleming met him on the street &#x201C;looking extremely ill and dreadfully dirty&#x2014;his hat broken in the brim&#x2014;he said he had just come from Paris the day before, for the purpose of superseding Peel and that he was to return to Paris next day to settle Poland&#x201D;!&#x2014; A Lady of his friends writes to me that she had had a letter from him wanting money to carry on his political affairs in which he stated that &#x201C;during the preceding week he had been in several Asylums and Prisons in France&#x201D;&#x2014; I doubt however if he has ever been out of London&#x2014;probably in some Public Asylum <hi rend="italic">here</hi>&#x2014;and dreaming all his travels&#x2014; Fortunately for <hi rend="italic">me</hi> I provoked him so much the last day he was here by <hi rend="italic">putting down</hi> his pretensions that he went away in great wrath&#x2014;and is not I think likely to come near me while this fit lasts.</p>
<p>My visit to Addiscombe went off quite well&#x2014; Her Ladyship was as usual without caprices or any sort of questionabilities for me&#x2014; Carlyle came every Saturday and staid till Monday&#x2014; Charles Buller and M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Baring did the same&#x2014;and besides there were other incidental visitors&#x2014;on the other days Lady Harriet and I were <foreign>tete-a-tete</foreign>&#x2014;but for ten days at the end&#x2014;the Easter Holydays&#x2014;the house was quite full&#x2014;It was very interesting to me to make acquaintance <hi rend="italic">there</hi> with a young Grandee from my own East Lothian&#x2014;M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Charters&#x2014;prospective Earl of Weyms&#x2014;he has the beautifulest young creature for wife I ever set my eyes on<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Francis Richard Charteris Douglas (<date when="1818-00-00">1818</date>&#x2013;<date when="1914-00-00">1914</date>; <ref target="volume-20/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/36833"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>) and his wife, Lady Anne Frederica (d. <date when="1896-00-00">1896</date>), m. <date when="1843-00-00">1843</date>; he succeeded as 10th earl of Wemyss, <date when="1883-00-00">1883</date>.

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Mr Emerson writes me that he has made a Bargain with <hi rend="italic">Wiley and Putnam</hi> about the 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi> edition of Cromwell; and Mr Putnam has just been here himself, engaging to do all that is honourable (in fact, just what I proposed thro&#x2019; you<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-20/lt-18451231-TC-EC-01">TC to EC, <date when="1845-12-31">31 Dec. 1845</date></ref>. George Palmer Putnam (<date when="1814-00-00">1814</date>&#x2013;<date when="1872-00-00">72</date>), American publisher; partner in Wiley &#x26; Putnam, <date when="1840-00-00">1840</date>&#x2013;<date when="1847-00-00">47</date>, and ran the first agency for the sale of American books in Britain, <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>&#x2013;<date when="1847-00-00">47</date>; friend of Mazzini; began publishing firm in New York, <date when="1848-00-00">1848</date>.</note>) relative to the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> edition too: so that we are now all straight there. Which is all more comfortable than it was!&#x2014;</p>
<p>The next packet of Sheets, therefore, you may send <hi rend="italic">direct to Wiley and Putnam</hi>, on <date when="1846-05-01">Saturday 1st May</date>; and not trouble Chapman<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Chapman.</note> with it.&#x2014; There will be the 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Volume complete, and a sheet or two more.&#x2014; I wish to Heaven we had done with it!</p>
<p>Today or tomorrow I shall finish the last bit of the <hi rend="italic">Appendix</hi> itself: Robson will then have the <hi rend="italic">whole Copy</hi> of all kinds in his hands,&#x2014;the Third Volume very easy too, in comparison;&#x2014;and I hope and pray he may end it before May end. If I could add wings to him, I would.&#x2014; Christie too is busy with the new <hi rend="italic">Index</hi>, as he can get a chance.</p>
<p>In the <hi rend="italic">Inscription</hi> on the Copperplate there will be a slight change needed:</p>
<p>Instead of &#x201C;Letter XIII. see Vol I. p 214,&#x201D; there will now have to be Letter XXIV. see Vol I. p.234.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >To have gone on the frontispiece portrait, which reproduces the date and signature from this letter; but no reference to the printed text was made.</note></p>
<p>It will be good to get that change effected as soon as you like that there may be in it no delay.</p>

<salute>Dearest Helen</salute>
<p>I would have answered your letter in <hi rend="italic">the enthusiasm of the moment</hi> if the moment had not been between needed for more practical purposes. There was much to be put straight on my return <hi rend="italic">morally</hi> as well as <hi rend="italic">materially</hi>, and I <pb id="pg-20-179" n="20:179"/>had not even my <hi rend="italic">normal</hi> amount of force either moral or material to bring to the work: for the excitement of a houseful of the most exciting and excited people during the last ten days had been a prodiguous overbalance to the &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">pure</hi> air&#x201D; and other advantages of Addiscombe. The more I see of aristocratic life, the more I wonder how people with the same system of nerves as oneself, and with the same human needs, can keep themselves alive in it&#x2014;and <hi rend="italic">sane!</hi> Lady Harriet especially, who is the woman of largest intellect I have ever seen&#x2014;how <hi rend="italic">she</hi> can reconcile herself to a life which is after all a mere dramatic representation, however successful, fills me with astonishment and <hi rend="italic">a certain</hi> sorrow. But like the pigs they &#x201C;are used to it.&#x201D; and nobody, I fancy knows till he try how difficult it is to tear himself loose from the network of Lilliputan packthreads in which our nobility grow up from their earliest days. a <hi rend="italic">poor</hi> woman has enough of serious occupation cut out for her by the nature of things&#x2014;sometimes <hi rend="italic">more</hi> than is good for her&#x2014;and therein lies <hi rend="italic">her</hi> grievance&#x2014;we in <hi rend="italic">our</hi> sphere have also something given us to <hi rend="italic">do</hi>&#x2014;how far it may suit our taste is another question and a secondary one&#x2014;we see at least how our activity may be turned to account better or worse. but a great Lady&#x2014;should <hi rend="italic">she</hi> take a notion to wrap herself in a blanket and go to sleep like <hi rend="italic">Beauty</hi> for a hundred years;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In the nursery tale &#x201C;The Sleeping Beauty&#x201D; by Charles Perrault (<date when="1628-00-00">1628</date>&#x2013;<date when="1703-00-00">1703</date>).</note> what would stand still that needs to go forward?&#x2014;only herself!&#x2014;and should she take the better notion to put away Great-Lady-things and lead a rational useful life how is she to set about it? how extricate herself from the imposed <hi rend="italic">do-nothingism</hi> of her <hi rend="italic">position?</hi>&#x2014; As Lady Harriet herself once said to me &#x201C;one would have to begin by quarrelling with all one&#x2019;s husbands relations and one&#x2019;s own&#x201D;&#x2014;a beginning that one may be excused for finding rather questionable!&#x2014; No! it is not <hi rend="italic">easy</hi> for a Great Lady in these days to be anything but &#x201C;an ornament to Society in every direction,&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18351026-JWC-TC-01"><sic>8:245</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1835-10-26">26 Oct. 1835</date></corr></ref>.</note> and <hi rend="italic">that</hi> her Ladyship succeeds in being&#x2014;to perfection! The old illustration of the camel passing thro&#x2019; the eye of a needle<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Matt. 19:24.</note> still holds good&#x2014; Let those who are not in the camels shoes, among whom are you and I, be thankful&#x2014;tho&#x2019; cooks may sometimes give one a deal of trouble&#x2014;and holed stockings may accumulate into a small Ben Lomond<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mountain 3.192 ft.; on E side of Loch Lomond, cen. Scotland; the dominating peak of the region.</note> while one is away on a visit&#x2014;and other the like nuisances render ones carreer of household activity often enough anything but a <hi rend="italic">pleasurable</hi> one!&#x2014; Now, what has tempted me into this moral-essay style, I have not the slightest conception!&#x2014; when I sat down to write I did not feel at all <hi rend="italic">preachingly</hi>-disposed But I am in the habit of letting my pen go its own way, and this is the way it has gone.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-20-180" n="20:180"/>The Cromwell-turmoil is again subsiding and the second edition will be out in a few weeks. &#x201C;Tha<hi rend="italic">nks</hi> God&#x201D;! And now I hope we shall really be done with that man! if he had been my Husband&#x2019;s Own Father he could not have gone thro&#x2019; more hardship for him! We have lived &#x201C;in the valley of the shadow&#x201D; of Cromwell now, as of Death, for some three years&#x2014; But every thing comes to an end if one have patience&#x2014; What is to come next Heaven knows&#x2014; We have been enquiring all about for houses in the country&#x2014; without, it seems to me, much chance or even <hi rend="italic">much intention</hi> of a practical result&#x2014; Sometimes&#x2014;in desperately bilious days Carlyle speaks of returning to Scotland and living <hi rend="italic">there</hi> &#x201C;in seclusion for his few remaining years&#x201D;&#x2014; I do not look for much practical result to <hi rend="italic">that</hi> idea either&#x2014; Still this perpetual talk of moving takes away all ones pleasure (such as it was) in Chelsea&#x2014; I feel myself no longer in a <hi rend="italic">home</hi> but in a <hi rend="italic">tent</hi> to be struck any day that the commanding officer is sufficiently bilious.

<p>The Ferguses are here&#x2014; I have not seen them yet&#x2014;most likely shall on Sunday evening and then I will inform Miss Jessie that she may again have an opportunity of &#x201C;cultivating Jeanie&#x2019;s acquaintance.&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jeannie Welsh was visiting her brother Walter (ca. <date when="1799-00-00">1799</date>&#x2013;<date when="1879-00-00">1879</date>; see <ref target="volume-16/lt-18430108-JWC-JW-01"><sic>16:12</sic><corr>JWC to JW, <date when="1843-01-08">8 Jan. 1843</date></corr></ref>), minister in Auchtertool, nr.

<p><salute>Dear Sir&#x2014;</salute>I have received your copy of the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> to-day;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Manchester Examiner</hi>, of which Ballantyne was printer and publisher, was started, <date when="1846-01-10">10 Jan.</date>, by John Bright (<date when="1811-00-00">1811</date>&#x2013;<date when="1889-00-00">89</date>; <ref target="volume-20/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/3421"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>) and others as a more advanced newspaper than the <hi rend="italic">Manchester Guardian</hi>. &#x201C;Ballantyne sent Carlyle regularly newspapers and private letters containing reports of anything specially interesting in the proceedings and progress of the [Anti-Corn Law] League, and Carlyle responded sympathetically&#x201D; (Espinasse 241).</note> and am very glad indeed to see you get along so handsomely. Continue to tell a straight manful story about what comes before you; and people will not fail to listen. They are getting every day more prepared to hear one&#x2019;s full mind spoken about all manner of matters.</p>
<p>Since I saw you I have passed an evening with Mr. Cobden; whom I found, what all the world find him, a most distinct, ingenuous, energetic well-conditioned man;&#x2014;very like getting through <hi rend="italic">work;</hi> of which he has already done a good spell, and will yet have more to do. Nobody here seems in the least to understand what will become of the Parliament and Peel&#x2019;s Bill; nobody that I see reads a word of the Debates, all men seem sick of them, none knows where they will end. The confusion seems deepening every day; and to me at times issues lie visible in it which are very far from exhilarating! We must even let the Destinies do their will.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-20-182" n="20:182"/>The new edition of <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> is now out of my hands, all but the Proofsheets; the Printers say they will have it ready about the beginning of <date when="1846-06-00">June</date>. It has met with a very unexpected reception in the world:&#x2014;I fancy in fact it will far survive all my other Books; and may be the beginning of great benefit to this bewildered world, in various ways.</p>
<p>Since Mr. Espinasse is still with you, I wish you would impart to him (send after him to Edinburgh if necessary) the following tidings: That there are to be, either here or in America, or in both countries, new editions straightway of these Books of mine, The <hi rend="italic">Miscellanies, Sartor, Heroes, French Revolution;</hi> the whole of which I have to read over again for errors. Mr. Espinasse knows what is expected of him, according to his opportunities, in that case.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably Espinasse would help TC with revisions. He had written to TC, [<date when="1846-04-25">25 April</date>], while still in London: &#x201C;Thanks for your kind recommendation, which I have transmitted to Manchester; whither I shall follow it tomorrow. Seven persons have been selected as likely fellows. &#x2026; I am among the seven, and submit myself &#x2026; to the &#x2018;considerate scrutiny&#x2019; of the Committee; on Tuesday evening.&#x201D; See also <ref target="volume-20/lt-18460503-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1846-05-03">3 May</date></ref>.</note> <hi rend="italic">Heroes</hi> and <hi rend="italic">F. Revolution</hi> I believe come <hi rend="italic">first</hi>. If you will tell him this, it is all the message.&#x2014; I am very glad you made him halt a while in Manchester: I hope you will find some good work for him there yet. He will quit his &#x201C;Sarcasms&#x201D; by and by; and open himself abroad to more genial recognitions, which will come out in a fruitfuller dialect.</p>

<p>I have now got done with <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi>, all but the Proofs; and am ready any day to hear what you have to say about those other Books you were once talking of.</p>
<p>Meanwhile will you be so good as send me a Copy of the <hi rend="italic">Hero-worship</hi> and of the <hi rend="italic">F.

<p>Mr Putnam, really a very intelligent, modest and reputable-looking little fellow, got at last to sight of me about a week ago;&#x2014;explained with much earnestness how the whole origin of the <hi rend="italic">mistake</hi> about the First Edition of <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> had lain with Chapman my own Bookseller (which in fact I had already perceived to be the case);<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-20/lt-18451231-TC-EC-01">TC to EC, <date when="1845-12-31">31 Dec. 1845</date></ref>.</note> and farther set forth, what was much more important, that he and his Partner were, and had been, ready and desirous to <hi rend="italic">make good</hi> said mistake, in the amplest most satisfactory manner,&#x2014;by the ready method of paying me <hi rend="italic">now</hi> ten percent on the selling-price of all the Copies of Cromwell sent into the market by them; and had (as I knew already) covenanted with you to do so, in a clear, <hi rend="italic">bon&#xe2;fide</hi>, and to you satisfactory manner, in regard to that First Edition: in consequence of which you had made a bargain with them of like tenor in regard to the Second. To all which I could only answer, That such conduct was that of men of honour, and would, in all manner of respects be satisfactory to me.&#x2014; Wherefore the new Sheets of <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> should now go by <hi rend="italic">his</hi> Package direct to New York, and the other little Parcel for you, he <pb id="pg-20-184" n="20:184"/>could send to Munroe:&#x2014;that as one consequence? &#x201C;Yes, surely,&#x201D; intimated he; but there were other consequences, of more moment behind that.</p>
<p>Namely that they wanted (the Wiley &#x26; Putnam house did) to publish certain other Books of mine, the List of which I do not now recollect; under similar conditions: viz that I was to certify in a line or two prefixable to each Book, That I had read it over in preparation for their Printer, and did authorize them to print and sell it;&#x2014;in return for which ten per cent on the sale-price (and all manner of facilities, volunteered to convince even Clark of Boston, the Lynx-eyed Friend now busy for me looking thro&#x2019; millstones, that all was straight, and said Ten percent actually paid on every copy sold): This was Putnam&#x2019;s Offer, stated with all transparency, and in a way not to be misunderstood by either of us.</p>
<p>To which I answered that the terms seemed clear and square and everyway good, and such as I could comply with heartily,&#x2014;so far as I was at liberty, but not farther. Not farther: for example there was Hart of Philadelphia (I think the Wileys do not want the <hi rend="italic">Miscellanies</hi>) there were Munroe, Little and Browne &#x26;c;&#x2014;in short there was R. W. Emerson, who knew in all ways how far I was free and not free, and who would take care of my integrity and interest at once, and do what was just and prudent; and to <hi rend="italic">him</hi> I would refer the whole question, and whatever he engaged for that and no other than that I would do. So that you see how it is, and what a coil you have again got into! Mr Putnam would have had some &#x201C;Letter,&#x201D; some &#x201C;exchange of Letters,&#x201D; to the effect above-stated: but I answered &#x201C;It was better we did not write at all till the matter was clear and liquid with you, and then we could very swiftly write,&#x2014;and act. I would apprise you how the matter stood, and expect your answer, and bid you covenant with Mr Wiley what you found good, prompt I to fulfil whatever <hi rend="italic">you</hi> undertook for me.&#x201D;&#x2014; This <hi rend="italic">is</hi> a true picture of the Affair, the very truest I can write in haste; and so I leave it with you&#x2014;<foreign><hi rend="italic">ach Gott!</hi></foreign></p>
<p>If your Photograph succeed as well as mine, I shall be almost <hi rend="italic">tragically</hi> glad of it. This of me is far beyond all pictures; really very like: I got Laurence the Painter to go with me, and he would not let the people off till they had actually made a likeness. My Wife has got another, which she asserts to be much &#x201C;more amiable-looking,&#x201D; and even liker! O my Friend, it is a strange Phantasmagory of a Fact, this huge tremendous World of ours, Life of ours!&#x2014; Do you bethink you of Craigenputtoch, and the still evening there?<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >25&#x2013;<date when="1833-08-26">26 Aug. 1833</date>.</note> I could burst into tears, if I had that habit: but it is of no use The Cromwell business will be ended about the end of <date when="1846-05-00">May</date>,&#x2014;I do hope!</p>
<p>You say not a word of your own Affairs: I have vaguely been taught to <pb id="pg-20-185" n="20:185"/>look for some Book shortly;&#x2014;what of it? <closer><salute>We are well, or tolerably well, and the Summer is come: <foreign>adieu</foreign>. Blessings on you and yours.</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Laurence,</salute>
<p>We have several chairs here, three I think of some likelihood: but I doubt it will be difficult to get into the <hi rend="italic">identical</hi> posture (which you seem to insist on) in any chair but the <hi rend="italic">one</hi> primary chair the Photograph itself came from,&#x2014;if even in that! However, you had better come here tomorrow evening and try. From four o&#x2019;clock till the end of daylight, you shall have all manner of scope.</p>
<p>I bethink me of another thing. There is still a Photograph to be sat for; one that is to go to my Mother. Suppose we sent down a chair of our own to Beard&#x2019;s and sat in that;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Beard&#x2019;s Photographic Studio, 85 King William St., City, advertised itself as &#x201C;the sole Patentee of the Daguerreotype&#x201D; and offered &#x201C;coloured photographic portraits&#x201D; taken daily at 34 Parliament St., Westminster, and at the Royal Polytechnic Inst., Regent St. and at the City address.</note> and then taking back with us both chair and Shadow, did our best with that?&#x2014; Tomorrow evening we shall hear what you say, and study to obey it.</p>

<salute>Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>On friday night last I began a Letter to you; but had proceeded only the length of the second sentence, when the entrance of Darley, followed very soon by that of Alfred Tennyson and Moxon, and in a few minutes more by that of Anthony Sterling put a hopeless stop to the enterprise! They sat till past 11; talking in a wide-flowing very desultory way. With puffs of tobacco too. Alfred looks haggard, dim and languid: they <hi rend="italic">have</hi> got him however to go and <hi rend="italic">draw</hi> his Pension;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Civil List pension granted in <date when="1845-09-00">Sept. 1845</date>; see <ref target="volume-20/lt-18451005-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1845-10-05">5 Oct.</date>]</ref>.</note> that is reckoned a great achievement on the part of his friends! Surely no man has a right to be so lazy in this world;&#x2014;and none that is so lazy will ever make much way in it, I think! Darley has been in France all this while; about Paris &#x26;c, &#x201C;gathering strength&#x201D;; is the same <pb id="pg-20-186" n="20:186"/>old gasping ingenious well-meaning miserable man. He asked very kindly after you; as many do.&#x2014; Old Sterling is now gone over to <hi rend="italic">live</hi> with Anthony: he has had another attack in late weeks; looked altogether worn and broken when I saw him above a fortnight since.&#x2014; Espinasse, after poking about on the surface of Literary work here for a while, in a rather hopeless-looking way, has decided to try <hi rend="italic">Lecturing in Lancashire</hi> (which I too recommended as eligibler for him), and has gone home to Edinburgh to prepare. This is the most of what I know about your acquaintances here: Cochrane in the Library said, &#x201C;Many were asking after you; where you were, what you&#x201D; &#x26;c.&#x2014; Christie, I should add, writes me the other night of good prospects with a &#x201C;natural son of Lord Byron&#x2019;s&#x201D; who is about writing his Father&#x2019;s Life: I hope it may turn to something!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A person calling himself Major George Gordon Byron and claiming to be the illegitimate son of the poet and a Spanish lady whom Byron met in Spain in <date when="1809-00-00">1809</date> forged a number of the poet&#x2019;s letters and proposed writing a biography of his &#x201C;father&#x201D;; see T. G. Ehrsam, <hi rend="italic">Major Byron, The Incredible Career of a Literary Forger</hi> (<date when="1951-00-00">1951</date>).</note> Meanwhile C&#x2019;s best outlook seemed to me the fact that he was getting a little Medical Practice, Midwifery &#x26;c, and <hi rend="italic">had</hi> actually &#xa3;14 in the Savings Bank! There is small fear of Christie.&#x2014;</p>
<p>I have now got nearly quite done with my part in the <hi rend="italic">Cromwell;</hi> and the Printers too are dashing along with great rapidity,&#x2014;undertaking to have <hi rend="italic">done</hi> by the middle of <date when="1846-05-00">May</date>. We will say <hi rend="italic">end</hi> of <date when="1846-05-00">May</date>; and be very glad too.</p>
<p>American Putnam has been here; a small, longheaded, thin-necked intelligent Man, and very modest for a Yankee. He, after much apologetic preambling which he would not cut short, undertook at length with all clearness of statement to accept the second Edition of Cromwell on the terms specified by Emerson; and also,&#x2014;as preparatory for farther operations,&#x2014;to account to me for all the Copies already sold of the First, on the <hi rend="italic">same terms</hi> which I of course told him was abundantly satisfactory. He then proceeded to offer still the same terms (ten-percent on the selling-price of every Copy) for three other Books of mine, the <hi rend="italic">F. Revolution, Sartor</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Heroes</hi>, provided I would read them over for their Yankee Printer, and <hi rend="italic">say</hi> I had done so and authorized him! Which of course I was very willing to do, <hi rend="italic">in so far</hi> as Emerson, who knew all my American affairs, should pronounce me <hi rend="italic">free</hi> from engagements with other Booksellers to that length. So Emerson is written to; and I suppose will answer Yea,&#x2014;and so we are like to have a piece of work there too; and I suppose there may some considerable money come out of all that in the course of time.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Later TC added an asterisk here and wrote above the line: &#x201C;There never came one sixpence, Putn<hi rend="italic">m</hi> a mere plundering Fox (<date when="1869-00-00">May 1869</date>).&#x201D;</note> For which too let us be thankful!</p>
<p>Indeed I am rather on the prospering hand this year otherwise so far as <pb id="pg-20-187" n="20:187"/>money goes. Chapman was here yesterday to settle about a new Edition of <hi rend="italic">Heroes</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Miscellanies</hi> for the English Market: we have not yet come to close quarters about the <hi rend="italic">monies</hi> there; but I will make him do what is just and handsome if I can.&#x2014; All these things are a wonderful change when we think of ten or seven years back! It is really a blessing and deliverance not to be haunted by the base Terror of Beggary any more;&#x2014;a considerable deliverance: but farther I do not see that it goes; and masses of money in any quantity would really now not be of any use to me at all. I do thank Heaven I have got entirely <hi rend="italic">above</hi> that poor region of things; and do not value it, one way or the other! When I think of Hudson&#x2019;s Memorial, and look at the scrambling all the world carries on, I find that <hi rend="italic">this</hi> too is a great deliverance; perhaps the <hi rend="italic">greatest</hi> of all!&#x2014; By the bye are you aware that Hudson lives in one of those Tower Houses (the white monsters) at Albert Gate, Knightsbridge? The old stone <hi rend="italic">stags</hi> that used to be in Piccadilly are brought up thither, which has given rise to some bad wit here and there.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A new opening into Hyde Park was made in <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date> and named after Prince Albert. The iron gates were fixed on <date when="1845-08-09">9 Aug. 1845</date> and the stags from the Ranger&#x2019;s Lodge in Green Park were set up about the same time. Hudson bought the house on the E side of the gate for &#xa3;15,000.</note> I am told poor Hudson is one of the ugliest things you can see in a summer day: a big-bellied, swoln-faced, waddling <foreign><hi rend="italic">hushel</hi></foreign> [sloven]; &#x201C;with little arms like fins,&#x201D; says Charles Buller; and not a word of sense, or hardly even of grammar, to be got out of him:&#x2014;this is for the present the English Almighty; and I am very glad indeed that they are doing a Memorial to him; I hope they will make it very <hi rend="italic">high,</hi> that all men may the better know what they are and what he is!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Our visit ended fully about a fortnight ago; and we have now at last got very gentle weather too:&#x2014;pretty well both of us. I have my horse, getting into excellent order; and go riding pretty duly: but we have put him into one of the Nodes Carriages too where with a good driver he goes very well;&#x2014;and I mean that Jane shall have fully the <hi rend="italic">half</hi> of him, and take him off my hands, while he continues here. It is a terrible expense; which I grudge not a little: but I think it does do my health some small perceptible good; and so the horse and opportunity being here, I am willing not quite to reject it.</p>
<p>How is my dear good old Mother? I wish you would write me with all minuteness about her. The good weather, I hope, will now do her good. Jamie too, I am always glad to hear what he is about, to get some image to myself of Scotsbrig. I hope he comes <hi rend="italic">early</hi> home when he happens to be out! Really whatever may be said or sung, it is a decided duty lying on a man. The curse of Drink is literally that of the Devil in these times.&#x2014; Yesterday there came a well-dressed woman walking with three children <pb id="pg-20-188" n="20:188"/>forward to Battersea Bridge.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Leading from Chelsea across the Thames to Battersea.</note> It appears she was a House-Painter&#x2019;s Wife; it is thought had been drinking, quarrelling with her Husband in consequence, who in his just rage had said &#x201C;Might I never see your face again!&#x201D; The wretched woman, in <foreign><hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi></foreign> or some such horror of nerves and mind, walked to the middle of the Bridge; pitched all her children over into the river,&#x2014;somebody noticed the <hi rend="italic">third</hi> as she threw it over: she herself was laid hold of, but none of the children could be saved!<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Eliza Clark, aged 24, wife of William Clark, journeyman painter or porter, living in Chelsea, was taken to Westminister police court and remanded to Newgate prison.

According to the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, <date when="1846-05-04">4 May</date>, it was the husband who was the drunkard.</note>&#x2014; Did you ever hear of such a horror and abomination? <hi rend="italic">What</hi> is there in Hell, by whatever name we call it, that could do <hi rend="italic">worse</hi> to a human creature than <hi rend="italic">Gin</hi> has here done? The name of the Chief Devil at this time is Gin!&#x2014; Which I hope none of us will ever have <hi rend="italic">any</hi> concern with except in its <hi rend="italic">just</hi> and altogether <hi rend="italic">indisputably</hi> just place. Much better to err on the inside than on the out as to that.&#x2014;</p>
<p>I have had a Photograph done of me, and sent it off to Emerson: they have very much improved that affair since you used to be at it. This seems to me very successful indeed. Jane has a Copy,&#x2014;properly another and better <hi rend="italic">Original</hi>. I have fully determined to sit again for one to my Mother: I hope it will be ready against next Magazine day.</p>
<p>You are not very well. I hope the clear weather will induce you to more activity, which I suppose to be the chief remedy&#x2014; Poor Robby Irving!<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-20/lt-18460418-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1846-04-18">18 April</date></ref>.</note>&#x2014; Do you know how fond of you Paulet is?&#x2014; My blessings on my Mother and you all!</p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Accept many kind thanks for your kind remembrance of me from beyound <pb id="pg-20-189" n="20:189"/>the Sea.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-20/lt-18460303-TC-RWE-01">TC to RWE, <date when="1846-03-03">3 March</date></ref>.</note> I should long ago have said in words what pleasure it gave me: but I have been so hurried and confused this long while, I waited always till the Printer&#x2019;s Devils should abate a little. And now, after all, there is no leisure, what one can call leisure,&#x2014;which indeed I think is somewhat of a rarity in this world;&#x2014;and I must still content myself with writing you a very hurried word.</p>
<p>The thing I have been about in these last months is a new Edition of the Book on Cromwell,&#x2014;augmented, this time, by some fifty or sixty <hi rend="italic">new</hi> Letters of his which had turned up in all manner of places: a very dreary and confused operation for me; but one inherent in the nature of the case, and necessary to be gone into; and on the whole not to be grudged,&#x2014;for I believe the History of Oliver is a very good investment for Literary industry; one of the best! My part in the business is finished the other day, all but Proofsheets which also will soon be finished here: I will then crave leave to hold myself <hi rend="italic">quit</hi> of this Enterprise; new Letters of Cromwell, should such again turn up, must seek a new Editor, or be content at once to go into an Appendix, and stand there on their own legs. The Fifty or Sixty I have now had such trouble with are by no means intrinsically of proportionate importance; indeed they are altogether unimportant many of them, not elucidating much, hardly altering anything; my chief care had to be, all along that they should do the Book no <hi rend="italic">harm</hi>. You will see what they are, you too, from New York, I suppose; in not many weeks hence.&#x2014; Mr Everett Junior&#x2019;s two little Oliver Documents are in the Appendix:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably Edward Everett Hale and probably the &#x201C;two poor American scraps&#x201D; in<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 9:286&#x2013;87.</note> I also found a better (not third-hand but second-hand) Copy of John Cotton&#x2019;s Letter in the Museum here, and have substituted that; not forgetting the fact you gave me at Addiscombe, by far the memorablest fact there is in regard to Cotton, that it was he who carried the name of <hi rend="italic">Boston</hi> over the Sea, a very memorable performance on his part!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-20/lt-18460303-TC-RWE-01">TC to RWE, <date when="1846-03-03">3 March</date></ref>.</note> Not long since I got upon the trace of his <hi rend="italic">Commentary on St John</hi> (John Cotton&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Commentary on St John</hi>, London, <date when="1656-00-00">1656</date>,&#x2014;some three years after his decease); and hoped to have procured it for New England: but the Bookseller answers unluckily, It is already sold.&#x2014; &#x2014; There has been a good deal of noise about this Book on Cromwell among us; rather discordant and sometimes pretty <foreign><hi rend="italic">longeared</hi></foreign> noise: but on the whole the confused verdict is, You are partly right about this Cromwell. Which, for all manner of reasons high and low, I am very glad of.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The interest in Cromwell aroused by TC&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Letters and Speeches</hi> is perhaps suggested by two entries in the diary of the naturalist Richard Owen (<date when="1804-00-00">1804</date>&#x2013;<date when="1892-00-00">92</date>; <ref target="volume-20/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/21026"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>; see <ref target="volume-15/lt-18420826-TC-JWC-01"><sic>15:51</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1842-08-26">26 Aug. 1842</date></corr></ref>). At the end of <date when="1846-04-00">April</date> the Carlyles had come to inspect a copy of a portrait of Cromwell in the Pitti Palace that Owen had had made: &#x201C;Mr. Carlyle has a portrait of Cromwell, but in quite a different style; he greatly admired our picture, and studied it attentively. It is curious how like his books Carlyle&#x2019;s conversation is.&#x201D; A few days later Owen noted: &#x201C;More people to see Cromwell. He has held quite a levee&#x201D; (R. S. Owen, <hi rend="italic">The Life of Richard Owen</hi> [<date when="1894-00-00">1894</date>] 1:283).</note> High and highest reasons:&#x2014;alas, this brutal Old-Jew method <pb id="pg-20-190" n="20:190"/>of treating Heroes as Caitiffs and Caitiffs as Heroes, is it not simply the wellhead of all the sorrowful confusion one sees under the Sun!&#x2014;</p>
<p>We are very busy here, debating and re-debating our Anti-Cornlaw; to the infinite tedium, distress and uncertainty of all the world. No mortal, if it be not a Printer&#x2019;s Devil, thinks of reading that distracted jargon: but in the meanwhile there is universally obstructed Trade, railway gambling fallen prostrate into railway ruin, danger of Famine near at hand; and as yet nobody can guess the <foreign><hi rend="italic">finis</hi></foreign> of all this Parliamentary eloquence, <hi rend="italic">when</hi> it will end, or how it will end. Parliaments in an epoch like ours are a very singular class of entities!&#x2014; Human creatures ought to be tolerant of a good deal of Nonsense in this world: yet at length there comes a point when they have to grow <hi rend="italic">in</hi>tolerant, and peremptorily bid the Nonsense go its ways! The clear discernment of this point ahead of us all at present, one cannot say how near, often fills me with a kind of terror.</p>
<p>Surely, my dear Sir, you are happy to be out of all that; honourably free of it; raised from it at once into a station far higher and far quieter. I shall henceforth fancy you in your New Cambridge, enjoying a calm life, and withal accomplishing much benefit which otherwise would have been impossible. Education, if it is with you as with us, does stand in need of much improvement. Alas, an Age which has flowered out into Black-or-White Surplice Controversy<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Whether preachers should wear just a black cassock or a white surplice over it.</note> and a Monument to Hudson,&#x2014;cannot be expected to be very good at educating! One day it will shake off its Eighteen and odd Centuries of <hi rend="italic">rags;</hi> emerge from the dingy fetid <hi rend="italic">Monmouth Street</hi> it has too long dwelt in; and, getting sight of the Eternal Firmaments again, be much astonished at itself!&#x2014; Did you ever read <hi rend="italic">Meister&#x2019;s Travels</hi> by Goethe? If not, let me recommend it to your good attention. It is very beautiful and wise; beautiful not as an idle Picture on the Wall, but as a Symbol (I think) of extremely precious truths too.</p>
<p>We hear of you often, from the Bath-House quarter and elsewhere.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Bath House, 82 Piccadilly, was the Ashburtons&#x2019; London home.</note> A word from you at any time will give me great pleasure; double, if I can in anything be useful to you. I will beg a continuance of your friendly regard; and can very faithfully promise you the like. <closer><salute>Sincerely Yours</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Long ago, at the appointed day, the Horse was faithfully delivered here;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On <date when="1846-04-03">3 April</date>.</note> and, after a little refection and medicine, has been in use ever since. I found him in altogether surprisingly good condition; able and willing, almost too able and willing, from the very first, to do all kinds of work. He is much improved in his habits too; every way an excellent Horse. I am surely very much obliged to you for all the trouble you have taken;&#x2014;in which your comfort is, that it has been successful trouble. A real comfort to a man in such case.</p>
<p>If you will now be so kind as send me the account of monies, or the net amount of money, for that is all I want, I will bid my Scotch Banker pay your London one; and so we shall be clear on <hi rend="italic">that</hi> side.&#x2014; The day the Horse came I was roused from <foreign><hi rend="italic">siesta</hi></foreign> to receive him, and hardly knew what was what. It struck me soon after by some symptoms I remembered, that the man who brought him was <hi rend="italic">not</hi> a hired conductor of horses, but your <pb id="pg-20-192" n="20:192"/>own Groom,&#x2014;to whom I had, what was really a grief to me, omitted giving some poor five-shillings as a token of my satisfaction with him. The poor lad had a right to expect this of me; and it is not to the like of him that one would be found a defaulter! You must save me a real mortification, and be so very obliging as pay this debt for me, and add it to the other amount. I especially request it for my own peace of mind!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Fitzgerald was here the other night; as hearty and cheery as ever; very brisk among London Gaieties at present I believe.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Writing to a friend, <date when="1846-05-05">5 May</date>, FitzGerald said: &#x201C;Tomorrow Tennyson and I are going to get a pint or two of fresh air at Richmond: and we are to wind up our day at Carlyle&#x2019;s by way of a refreshing evening&#x2019;s entertainment. I met C. last night at Tennyson&#x2019;s; and they two discussed the merits of this world, and the next, till I wished myself out of <hi rend="italic">this</hi>, at any rate. Carlyle gets more wild, savage, and unreasonable every day; and, I do believe, will turn mad. &#x2018;What is the use of ever so many rows of stupid, fetid, animals in cauliflower wigs&#x2014;and clean lawn sleeves&#x2014;calling themselves Bishops&#x2014;Bishops, I say, of the Devil&#x2014;not of God&#x2014;obscene creatures, parading between men&#x2019;s eyes, and the eternal light of Heaven,&#x2019; etcccccc. This, with much abstruser nonconformity for two whole hours!&#x2014;and even as it was yesterday, so shall it be to-morrow, and the day after that&#x2014;<foreign>in saecula saeculorum</foreign>!&#x201D; (Terhune, <hi rend="italic">LEF</hi> 1:534).</note> When he goes your way I do not yet know.</p>

<salute>Dearest Babbie</salute>
<p>Few deaths could have surprised me more than M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Liddle&#x2019;s; he had so little the look of one born to die young! I can well believe that all who were in habits of intimacy with him will long mourn the loss of such a cheerful kindly soul. For me; I am got to that with it now, that I can no longer feel sorry for the one who <hi rend="italic">dies</hi> but only for the friends he leaves behind to miss him&#x2014; One escapes so much suffering by dying young!&#x2014;all the good one <hi rend="italic">could possibly</hi> have enjoyed in longer life is not it seems to me to be put in the balance against the evil which one <hi rend="italic">must necessarily</hi> have suffered. Surviving one after another of all one loved&#x2014;one after another of all one&#x2019;s beautiful illusions and even most reasonable hopes, surv<supplied>[iv]</supplied>ing<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letters omitted.</note> in short one&#x2019;s original self!&#x2014; You cannot understand yet how life may grow to look no such blessing&#x2014;even for those who have no claim to be considered exceptionally unfortunate&#x2014;long may it be before you feel this as I do! it is a weary, dreary feeling, almost making one regret the feelings of acute sorrow out of which it grows&#x2014; And yet it is well to be prepared for it&#x2014;that one may have it in as gentle a degree as possible by beginning early to pitch ones hopes from the world rather low&#x2014;and by laying in as many good thoughts and good actions as one possibly can to look back upon for comfort, when one ceases to feel any comfort in looking forward. I have not got into a Socinian zeal for the &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">pleasures of a good conscience</hi>&#x201D; tho&#x2019; the foregoing sentence might lead you to that idea&#x2014; I do not pretend to know by experience what the &#x201C;pleasures of a good conscience&#x201D; may really be&#x2014;but I fancy them like all other <hi rend="italic">pleasures</hi> that I <hi rend="italic">have</hi> experience of, a feeble refuge against the pressure of existence as it hardens gradually into old age&#x2014;stript of <hi rend="italic">all</hi> its early poetical illusions. but without any Socinian selfconceit I <hi rend="italic">may</hi> say to you, of my own knowledge, that the natural sadness of the latter part of ones life may be cruelly <hi rend="italic">embittered</hi> by the reflection, that ones best years, which might perhaps have produced something good have been suffered to run to waste, fertile only of tares and nettles!&#x2014; But enough of moralising&#x2014;</p>
<p>I have not been well&#x2014;as M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Paulet said&#x2014;but not more ill than when M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Paulet spread such fine news of my improved looks!&#x2014; People must talk&#x2014;about other peoples looks and much else that comes readiest&#x2014;but what they say <hi rend="italic">for talkings sake</hi> is not worth a minutes recollection <foreign>Ach <pb id="pg-20-194" n="20:194"/>gott!</foreign> how little even those who like one <hi rend="italic">divine</hi> of one&#x2019;s actual state!&#x2014;unless one <hi rend="italic">put oneself into words</hi> and hardly even then, can the generality of one&#x2019;s friends tell whether one is glad or sorrowful&#x2014;feeling pain or pleasure!&#x2014; I called at the Macreadys the other day&#x2014;in a humour that a person under sentence of death need hardly have envied&#x2014; For days and weeks a cheerful feeling had not been in my mind&#x2014;but of course one does not make calls to show oneself as <hi rend="italic">a spectacle of woe</hi>&#x2014; I talked talked&#x2014;about the feats of Carlyle&#x2019;s horse &#x26;c&#x2014;and they laughed till their tears ran down <hi rend="italic">I</hi> could not <hi rend="italic">laugh</hi>&#x2014;but no matter&#x2014;perhaps my own gravity made the things I was saying only more amusing by contrast. By and by M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Macready who is in the family-way began to talk of the dreadful &#x201C;depression of spirits&#x201D; she occasionally laboured under&#x2014; &#x201C;Ah said I, everyone I suppose has their own fits of depression to bear up against if the truth were told&#x201D;&#x2014; &#x201C;Do you say so&#x201D; said Miss Macready&#x2014; &#x201C;Oh no surely!&#x2014;some people are never out of spirits&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">yourself</hi> for example I really believe you do not know what it is to be ever sad for a minute!!! one never sees you that you do not keep one in fits of laughter!&#x201D; I made no answer&#x2014;but congratulated myself on having played my part so well&#x2014; I wish I could find some hard work I <hi rend="italic">could</hi> do&#x2014;and saw any sense in doing&#x2014; If I do not soon it will be the worse for me&#x2014;</p>
<p>Meanwhile all <hi rend="italic">around</hi> me goes on as usual&#x2014; C is just getting done with <hi rend="italic">his</hi> work&#x2014;speculating about &#x201C;where to go&#x201D;&#x2014; The usual people come about; but seldomer I think&#x2014;seeing that I am less disposed to amuse them&#x2014;new people come&#x2014;but I have lost my talent for &#x201C;swearing everlasting friendships&#x201D;&#x2014; All my talents seem to be going one after another&#x2014;</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Yesterday I got the American Letter, which I was very glad of, and sent off instantly to Dumfries; a day or two before, I had got your other Letter: I am always much obliged to you for the shortest line you can afford me, of news from Scotsbrig and yourself. Little Tom&#x2019;s American Letter was very good:&#x2014;I found nothing questionable in the news at large, except that notice of the foundered or otherwise spoiled &#x201C;horses,&#x201D; a sort of ware poor Alick has too much dealt in from of old! If he be short up for money, poor fellow, it would be very well done to furnish him with a little more, to avoid such necessities: and I should be very happy to do it, could one find a good way,&#x2014;and be certain that it would not do more ill than good. I think he is certainly in a better way yonder than we have ever before known him in.</p>
<p>This morning came the inclosed Letter, which I judge to be from George Johnston;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Johnstone, physician-turned-farmer, living in Gloucester; see <ref target="volume-15/lt-18421125-TC-JAC-01"><sic>15:203</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1842-11-25">25 Nov. 1842</date></corr></ref>. His letter, from Sandhurst, <date when="1846-05-19">19 May</date>, was sent to John Carlyle at TC&#x2019;s address (MS: Yale). He was &#x201C;getting money, &#x26; practice &#x26; farming both pay better than when you were here.&#x201D;</note> the old hand used to be familiar to me.&#x2014; About an hour ago too, as you must tell my Mother, our huge Bacon-ham arrived in full size! A most effectual-looking article: price of the carriage 4/11, net; which seems very cheap conveyance. Tomorrow morning, if all go well, we will try what quality it is of; and report accordingly before long. Our good Mother! You must thank her in the mean time; and say how precious <hi rend="italic">any</hi> gift of hers is to us. If the value of gifts be that they are symbols of a generous affection, then no gift can be so valuable. Bid her take good care not to fall ill again; and say I will write soon.&#x2014; Let me not forget <hi rend="italic">again</hi> to mention something else: Your trunk came duly the very day after you went, and is here safe and sound;&#x2014;what a stupidity never to have told you till now!</p>
<p>We have very wet <foreign><hi rend="italic">clashy</hi></foreign> weather; the change from bitter dry north-east to more genial south-west,&#x2014;which latter we hope will now be permanent. I take a ride pretty duly: but Jane gets out a light open vehicle from the stable of the Nodes people, &#x2018;two days in the week,&#x2019; and takes me driving with her; that now is one of the chief benefits of this horse. He goes extremely well; and is better worth his great expense to me so.&#x2014; At the end of the season, one can sell him?</p>
<p>The Printers have never yet quite done with <hi rend="italic">Cromwell:</hi> this week I think will nearly end it, and so relieve me of a very ugly <foreign>burble</foreign> of business. I have little more to do with it but <hi rend="italic">Proofs</hi> when they arrive. For some time I <pb id="pg-20-196" n="20:196"/>have been busy in much the same way otherwise, <hi rend="italic">revising</hi> those old Books of mine, <hi rend="italic">Heroes, Sartor</hi> &#x26;c for the Yankees, and some of them for both Yankees and English. I am now in the <hi rend="italic">F. Revolution;</hi> shall have done with it this week. The <hi rend="italic">Miscellanies</hi> is about ready.&#x2014;</p>
<p>Cochrane still tells me, &#x201C;Many people inquire&#x201D; after you. I find you are not well,&#x2014;bothered I suppose as to what shall next be done. Did you never think of a Country-house and Farm?<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Carlyle replied, <date when="1846-05-23">24 [23] May</date>: &#x201C;The project of a farm has often occurred to me, but I could not farm myself, &#x26; farming is a very disagreeable business when one has to depend on servants.&#x201D; He wanted &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">certain</hi> employment&#x201D; in his profession, and if that took him &#x201C;out of doors some hours daily&#x201D; but left him free &#x201C;for literary occupations, it would come up&#x201D; to his &#x201C;highest wishes.&#x201D;</note> Alas, no man can help another,&#x2014;it is a very sad truth! I hope to hear better news from you, however, before long.&#x2014; We have to go to the Wedgwoods tonight: Helps has just come in; waits <hi rend="italic">till I end</hi>. <closer><salute>Remember me affectionately to Jamie and Isabella; help poor Jenny what you can;&#x2014;and take care of my Mother!

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I have a little moment today; and will write you a word, which I have owed you for some time now. We are to thank you for the Ham! Dear kind Mother, it is an excellent Ham; of first rate quality,&#x2014;and far better than that, it is a beautiful proof to us of your care for us, of your affection to us which knows no decay. We eat of it every morning, and many kind thoughts there are to give a relish to it over and above. Thanks, thanks, dear Mother; the very best we have to give!&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>
<p>John does not speak quite so favourably of your health in his late Letters: I fear you are in a fretted weak condition;&#x2014;could not John take you down somewhere to the Shore, now that the weather is grown so warm? If there were a good lodging to be had, the Sea air might be of benefit to both of you. But good lodgings, I fear, are scarce on the Solway shores. Surely the warm weather itself will be favourable to you.&#x2014; It has grown very warm, first fairly like <hi rend="italic">Summer</hi> in London this very day.

<p>What a frightful tragedy was that at Annan! Poor Dobie, I can remember <pb id="pg-20-197" n="20:197"/>his first coming there; and now his poor old Father (whom I saw as an old man at the ordination) is left alone without his son there.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Dobbie (<date when="1766-00-00">1766?</date>&#x2013;<date when="1846-00-00">1846</date>), educ.

According to Glasgow Univ. matriculation lists, his father was James, a craftsman from Glasgow.</note> And our Jamie appears not to have been far himself from that fatal article:&#x2014;there is room enough in it for reflexion to all of us! I am sorry for poor Jamie Ewart too: his miserable thrift has been terribly punished. A very sad affair indeed, in every way: yet as I was in alarm at first that there might be some <hi rend="italic">voluntary</hi> agent in the business, I could not but feel how much <hi rend="italic">more</hi> horrible that would have been!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Carlyle wrote TC, <date when="1846-05-25">25 May</date>, the following account of the tragedy: &#x201C;Since writing to you on Saturday [<date when="1846-05-23">23 May</date> but dated <date when="1846-05-24">24 May</date>] we have had sure information of a most distressing case of poisoning at Annan, which I did not choose to mention on vague hearsay. Mr Dobbie, the burgher minister, it appears invited Wm Pool, one of his elders to lunch with him last friday afternoon at 3 o&#x2019;clock &#x26; sent for a bottle of porter from James Ewart (who belongs to the congregation &#x26; was once at Bogside long ago, as you may recollect). After drinking of the porter both were taken ill &#x26; also Mrs Dobbie who had drunk less than a wineglassful. Dobbie after much fearful suffering died the same evening at seven o&#x2019;clock. Pool, who was less healthy &#x26; had at once vomited freely, after some time thought himself well enough to go home, but fell down on the road near Millfield &#x26; was carried in to a house from wh he could not bear removal. How he &#x26; Mrs Dobbie now are we hear not. Dobbie was a very energetic useful man in his way, &#x26; greatly liked by his whole congregation. He has left an old father who lived with him, &#x26; a large family. You can conceive the horror of all concerned. James Ewart is an inoffensive quiet honest man &#x26; has painfully saved a few hundred pounds of money. It is said that he purchased the bottles into which he put his porter from one of the Annan doctors. He w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> thereby save a few pence &#x26; the doctor gain a shilling or two &#x2026; Other bottles of the same porter have been found good &#x2026; Jamie was at Ewart&#x2019;s last thursday &#x2026; Porter was proposed as the drink on the occasion, but their time was not come &#x26; ale was taken instead.&#x201D; James Ewart, grocer, High St., Annan.</note>&#x2014;</p>
<p>We get along here tolerably well. I have got myself a big <hi rend="italic">crockery</hi> tub, or bath in which I can sit; there I wash myself twice or thrice a week, all over, with soap and cold water, which I find does me a great deal of good. The horse too is very beneficial in the hot weather; abler to carry me in the heat than I should be to carry him! Jane has two days weekly of driving, but always takes me with her. The horse performs nobly; quiet as possible, and very good natured and swift; a healthy, nimble, excellent horse.&#x2014; My Printers are still haggling in the rear of the Cromwell concern; busy just now with the <hi rend="italic">Index</hi>, all done now but that. I shall not have a Copy ready for you by the <date when="1846-06-00">June</date> Magazines, as I hoped; it will have to wait till next month. Nor have I yet got the lazy Painter to go with me for a new <hi rend="italic">Sun</hi>-Picture for you; indeed the Painter talks of a <hi rend="italic">Pencil</hi> Sketch which (if I <hi rend="italic">will sit to him</hi> for an oil-Picture) <hi rend="italic">he</hi> will give you: this of course, if it fall to my share, I will by no means neglect.&#x2014; Emerson had tried the<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >NLS 521.40 ends here.</note> sun at Boston, but not succeeded <pb id="pg-20-198" n="20:198"/>(so he writes me yesterday); but is to try again, or send me a <hi rend="italic">Drawing</hi> of his countenance if nothing else will prosper.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC had probably just received Emerson&#x2019;s letter of <date when="1846-05-14">14 May</date>, which said: &#x201C;I was in Boston the other day &#x26; went to the best reputed Daguerrotypist, but though I brought home three transcripts of my face, the housemates voted them rueful, supremely ridiculous, I must sit again, or, as true Elizabeth Hoar said, I must not sit again, not being of the right complexion which Daguerre &#x26; iodine delight in. I am minded to try once more, and if the sun will not take me, I must sit to a good crayon sketcher Mr Cheney, &#x26; send you his draught.&#x201D;</note> E. had not yet got my Picture; or seen farther into those Bookseller Bargains he was managing for me.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson wrote TC, <date when="1846-05-14">14 May</date>: &#x201C;For Wiley &#x26; Putnam, I am glad if you like the bargain. It has this drawback it is nothing yet. Ever since they learned anything about an appendix, they have said we will not print till that comes. In the interim their book sells but not for you. Certainly by all means let the sheets be given to Putnam in London.&#x201D;</note> So his Letter is not worth sending.</p>
<p>I have been busy all this while <hi rend="italic">revising</hi> all those Books that are to be reprinted in America or here. I have now got thro&#x2019; them all but the <hi rend="italic">Miscellanies,</hi>&#x2014;and this, after some consideration, I decide to leave standing exactly as it is, and trust altogether to the <hi rend="italic">Bookseller</hi> Printer,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Putnam.</note> for it seems quite correct, and he is himself an extremely accurate man. Christie is doing an <hi rend="italic">Index</hi> for the <hi rend="italic">F. Revolution:</hi> as soon as that is <hi rend="italic">done,</hi> I fling the thing off my hands. I shall then be, I think, at liberty for some time; I do not mean to go into any new business all at once. When the weather grows too hot, we can fly if we like.&#x2014; I really care little about what mostly goes on here. The other night they got their Corn Bill (or Anticorn Bill) <hi rend="italic">read a second time</hi> in the Lords with a majority of <hi rend="italic">Forty-seven:</hi><note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On <date when="1846-05-28">28 May</date>.</note> so that it is now perfectly sure to pass, and we shall get rid of that sad jargon at last!</p>
<p>Dear Mother take care of yourself; endeavour to get into at least your old degree of strength again! Bid John write to me punctually how you are, how himself and they all are.</p>
<p>Tell Jenny she need not in the least hurry about those shirts; they are not at all wanted here: I wish I had told her this some time ago.</p>

<p><title><hi rend="small-caps">Memoranda</hi></title></p>
<p><title><hi rend="small-caps">concerning Mr</hi>. <hi rend="small-caps">Leigh Hunt</hi></title></p>
<p>1. That Mr. Hunt is a man of the most indisputedly superior worth; a <pb id="pg-20-199" n="20:199"/><hi rend="italic">Man of Genius</hi> in a very strict sense of that word, and in all the senses which it bears or implies; of brilliant varied gifts, of graceful fertility, of clearness, lovingness, truthfulness; of childlike open character; also of most pure and even exemplary private deportment; a man who can be other than <hi rend="italic">loved</hi> only by those who have not seen him, or seen him from a distance through a false medium.</p>
<p>2. That, well seen into, he <hi rend="italic">has</hi> done much for the world;&#x2014;as every man possessed of such qualities, and freely speaking them forth in the abundance of his heart for thirty years long, must needs do: <hi rend="italic">how</hi> much, they that could judge best would perhaps estimate highest.</p>
<p>3. That, for one thing, his services in the cause of Reform, as founder and long as editor of the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> newspaper;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> was founded by Hunt and his brother John in <date when="1808-00-00">1808</date> and ed. by him till <date when="1821-00-00">1821</date>.</note> as poet, essayist, public teacher in all ways open to him, are great and evident: few now living in this kingdom, perhaps, could boast of greater.</p>
<p>4. That his sufferings in that same cause have also been great; legal Prosecution and Penalty (not dishonourable to him; nay, honourable, were the whole truth known, as it will one day be):<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In <date when="1813-00-00">1813</date> Hunt was sentenced to two years in jail for articles sharply satirizing the Prince Regent.</note> unlegal obloquy and calumny through the Tory press;&#x2014;perhaps a greater quantity of baseless, persevering, implacable calumny, than any other living writer has undergone. Which long course of hostility (nearly the cruellest conceivable, had it not been carried on in half, or almost total misconception) may be regarded as the beginning of his other worst distresses, and a main cause of them, down to this day.</p>
<p>5. That he is heavily laden with domestic burdens, more heavily than most men, and his economical resources are gone from him.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hunt had been ill and so had his wife, Marianne, who has been described as &#x201C;mendacious, self-indulgent,&#x201D; and alcoholic; see Edmund Blunden, <hi rend="italic">Leigh Hunt, A Biography</hi> (<date when="1933-00-00">1933</date>) 297. His brother John had died, <date when="1845-00-00">1845</date>, leaving a widow and children needing support.</note> For the last twelve years he has toiled continually, with passionate diligence, with the <pb id="pg-20-200" n="20:200"/>cheerfullest spirit; refusing no task; yet hardly able with all this to provide for the day that was passing over him; and now, after some two years of incessant effort in a new enterprise<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hunt remained an extremely active writer, but it is not clear what this &#x201C;new enterprise&#x201D; was, except that it was not, as an insertion in the printed text states, &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">(The London Journal)</hi>,&#x201D; which ran <date when="1834-00-00">1834</date>&#x2013;<date when="1835-00-00">35</date>.</note> that seemed of good promise, it also has suddenly broken down, and he remains in ill health, age creeping on him, without employment, means, or outlook, in a situation of the pain-fullest sort. Neither do his distresses, nor did they at any time arise from wastefulness, or the like, on his own part (he is a man of humble wishes, and can live with dignity on little); but from crosses of what is called Fortune, from injustice of other men, from inexperience of his own, and a guileless trustfulness of nature:&#x2014;the thing and things that have made him unsuccessful make him in reality <hi rend="italic">more</hi> loveable, and plead for him in the minds of the candid.</p>
<p>6. That such a man is rare in a Nation, and of high value there; not to be <hi rend="italic">procured</hi> for a whole Nation&#x2019;s Revenue, or recovered when taken from us, and some 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year is the price which this one, whom we now have, is valued at; with that sum he were lifted above his perplexities, perhaps saved from nameless wretchedness! It is believed that in hardly any other way could 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. abolish as much suffering, create as much benefit, to one man, and through him to many and all.</p>
<p>Were these things set fitly before an English minister, in whom great part of England recognises (with surprise at such a novelty) a man of insight, fidelity and decision, is it not probable or possible that he, though from a quite opposite point of view, might see them in somewhat of a similar light; and, so seeing, determine to do in consequence? <closer><salute><foreign><hi rend="italic">Ut fiat</hi></foreign> [So let it be]!</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Half an hour ago I receive this Note from Scotsbrig, which calls upon me to write to you&#x2014;now when there is not a minute of deliberation for doing it in! I will enclose you the Note itself as the last news from Scotsbrig; which being good news will be welcome to you, and supply all the uses of a more formal letter.</p>
<p>I have seen at least two Letters of yours since I wrote last; the Second of <pb id="pg-20-201" n="20:201"/>the two was one to Jenny, I think;&#x2014;as they both went immediately round to Dumfries, I have not the dates of either of them here. I must not forget poor little Tom&#x2019;s Letter either, which interested us very much here! I suppose he is not &#x201C;little Tom,&#x201D; at least not so little any more; but is growing a great hulk of a fellow, able to help his Father in all manner of things, and make a figure, honestly equal to his strength, on the face of that new Country! Tell him we all heartily love him, and wish the best speed to him there. By Heaven&#x2019;s blessing, he shall do his part well in the world yet, when ours is done.&#x2014;</p>
<p>I know not if you saw in the <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi> the mournful tragedy of poor Dobbie the Burgher Minister, who was poisoned one day by a glass of porter got from Jamie Ewart&#x2019;s shop to give to one Pool (whom I do not know). Pool was nearly killed by his share; and Mrs Dobbie too by hers: poor Dobbie died the same day! It is supposed Jamie Ewart had bought the <hi rend="italic">bottles</hi> from some Doctor&#x2019;s Roup<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A public sale or auction.</note> (a Doctor Moffat I think, who was removing to Liverpool), and by undue <hi rend="italic">thrift</hi> ventured to put porter in them; giving them only an insufficient <hi rend="italic">rincing:</hi> the <hi rend="italic">poison</hi> would be <hi rend="italic">sticking</hi> on the glass, and would only slowly dissolve itself in the liquor. It is a most shocking thing.&#x2014; What may well add to our feeling about it, moreover, is this: Jamie of Scotsbrig, it seems, was paying somebody an account only a day or two before in Ewart&#x2019;s, and was just about ordering <hi rend="italic">porter</hi> (whereby this fatal bottle might possibly have fallen to his share), but on consulting they preferred <hi rend="italic">ale</hi>.&#x2014; This will enable you to understand what Jack&#x2019;s Note<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1846-05-25">25 May</date>.</note> is mainly taken up with.</p>
<p>My poor Book is never yet entirely out of the hands of the Printer; tho&#x2019; in a day or two it now must and will. The work people are all drinking at present and keeping the &#x201C;Whitsuntide holidays.&#x201D; I shall be glad enough to be <hi rend="italic">free</hi>. The weather has grown terribly hot; neither of us yet well inured to it; with Jane however it usually <hi rend="italic">agrees</hi>. Of course you have it far <hi rend="italic">hotter</hi>. The Corn bill here is as good as <hi rend="italic">passed:</hi> never fear that it can do you any ill in Canada; on the contrary I think it possible you may get a great <hi rend="italic">accession</hi> of traffic by this and the Free Trade generally which is sure to follow. The Irish are many of them living on Indian Corn this year; and probably we shall all give up potatoes and take to that. Farewell dear Brother. I will write again before long. <closer><salute>Yours ever affectionate</salute></closer></p>

Whitherward? is a question not yet in the least answered: Ireland, I think, does not grow much in favour; but in fact all is yet uncertain.</p>
<p>The Printer&#x2019;s men have all gone to drink in the Whitsuntide rejoicings, and left him and <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> sticking within a single step of the end.</p>
<p>Pity the &#x201C;Children in the Furnace,&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The people of London; cf. Dan. 3:21&#x2013;22.</note>&#x2014;near two millions of us! My poor horse has got a cold too, and cannot ride.</p>

<p>I have this day received a letter from Mr. Emerson by which I gather that he seems to think there is, except in the case of Mr. Hart of Philadelphia and the <hi rend="italic">Miscellanies,</hi> nothing to prevent my engaging with your firm in the way you propose.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >G.

Putnam summarized the letter at this point: &#x201C;He goes on to make reference to my father&#x2019;s proposition to pay a royalty on the <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> and on certain further books which were recommended by Mr. Emerson. &#x2026; On Emerson&#x2019;s suggestion, Carlyle appointed Mr. E. P. Clarke of the New England Bank of Boston to supervise on his behalf these authorized American editions.&#x201D; Emerson wrote to TC, <date when="1846-05-31">31 May</date>: &#x201C;I am heartily glad that you are in direct communication with these really energetic booksellers Wiley &#x26; Putnam. I understood from Wiley&#x2019;s letter to me, weeks ago, that their ambition was not less than to have a monopoly of your books. I answered, It is very desireable for us too; saving always the rights of Mr Hart of Philadelphia.&#x2014; I told him you had no interest in Munroe&#x2019;s &#x2018;Sartor&#x2019; which from the first was his own adventure, and Little &#x26; Brown had never reprinted Past &#x26; Present or Chartism. The &#x2018;French Revolution,&#x2019; &#x2018;Past &#x26; Present,&#x2019; &#x2018;Chartism,&#x2019; &#x26; the &#x2018;Sartor,&#x2019; I see no reason why they should not have. Monroe &#x26; L. &#x26; B. have no real claims, &#x26; I will speak to them But there is one good particular in Putnams proffer to you, which Wiley has not established in his (first &#x26; last) agreement with me, namely, that you shall have an interest in what is already sold of their first Edition of Cromwell. By all means close with Putnam of the good mind, exempting only Hart&#x2019;s interest. I have no recent correspondence with Wiley &#x26; P. and I greatly prefer that they should deal directly with you. Yet it were best to leave an American reference open for audit &#x26; umpirage to the staunch E. P. Clark of the New England Bank.&#x201D;</note> &#x2026;</p>
<p><pb id="pg-20-203" n="20:203"/>I have had two of the books, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Heroes</hi>, carefully revised for your printer. Copies for him are now in readiness precisely identical with those that our English printer will bring out when new editions are arranged by ourselves. The <hi rend="italic">French Revolution</hi> I have also revised in the same manner and am now getting an Index made of which you in America will have the benefit. We in England will copy you when our time comes. &#x2026; In <hi rend="italic">Past and Present</hi> (second English edition),<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >(<date when="1845-00-00">1845</date>).</note> I have no change at all to make; if it is necessary for form&#x2019;s sake, I will read the book over but I believe I can be of no benefit to it. My printer<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charles Robson.</note> (an excellent artist in his line) printed the last time without any proof sheets shown, and will again, in this and the other cases that concern us, so print. For the rest as I understand it, I have to announce at the beginning of each book &#x201C;that I have read this book for the behoof of your printer and that I authorize you (so far as I have any authority) and you alone, to print and to vend the same for me in the United States.&#x201D; Those I consider the main elements of what I hope will now straightway be an agreement between us. &#x2026; <closer><salute>Believe me,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dearest Helen</salute>
<p>This is certainly small encouragement for you to &#x201C;carry out&#x201D; your good resolutions. but alas! my Dear such is the usual fate of good resolutions in <pb id="pg-20-204" n="20:204"/>the world!&#x2014; No encouragement for them to speak of! Nay in the teeth of every sort of <hi rend="italic">discouragement</hi> must they get themselves carried out&#x2014;if at all&#x2014;it is all very well to tell <hi rend="italic">children</hi> about virtue being its own reward; their weak volition cannot have too many motives given it for being virtuous: but grown people with the least faculty &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">How to Observe,</hi>&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech, from Harriet Martineau, <hi rend="italic">How to Observe Manners and Morals</hi> (<date when="1838-00-00">1838</date>).</note> soon get to see thro&#x2019; all that sort of twaddle, and have to <hi rend="italic">go ahead</hi> at Virtue with a prospect of being <hi rend="italic">knocked on the head</hi> rather than <hi rend="italic">rewarded</hi>&#x2014; Still virtue is, as the country man said of Taglioni &#x201C;a bit of fascination&#x201D; somehow&#x2014;and those of good taste among us cannot do other than go after her&#x2014;so help us God!</p>
<p>As to my individual agency in accomplishing the will of Destiny in your particular instance&#x2014;I have only to say in Carlyles favourite phraseology &#x201C;Ah! if you knew how I have been situated!&#x201D;&#x2014;certainly my situation for some weeks has been exceptionally severe&#x2014;bilious to death with the warm weather&#x2014;floundering in an element of uncertainty&#x2014;and &#x201C;troubled about many things&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Like Martha; Luke 10:41.</note> (as women who have more imagination than good sense are apt to be)&#x2014; All talk of taking or building a permanent house in the Country is over again for this season&#x2014;and I now feel pretty sure that we shall not give up <hi rend="italic">this</hi> house till the Landlord raises the rent which he will probably do in two years&#x2014;so long, he is under written obligation to leave it to us at the actual rent, but the uncertainty about the next months is perfectly awful; when the heat is intense there are fervent wishes that a certain American Bookseller would send a certain letter that is expected; that we may &#x201C;bundle off&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;Where?&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;Oh any where&#x201D;!&#x2014; There are plenty of towns and villages in England where one may be <hi rend="italic">out of this</hi>&#x201D;&#x2014; Then comes a cool day like the present and all assumes an air of durability again&#x2014;but these are but <hi rend="italic">little worries,</hi> which like <hi rend="italic">the pigs</hi> one is used to&#x2014; The great misfortune is that I have <hi rend="italic">a shocking bad liver</hi>, and am also very much of a fool! cannot take the world as it comes to hand and make the best of&#x2014;but am always wishing in a moral sense as C in a material one that I were &#x201C;out of this&#x201D;&#x2014;into &#x201C;any where&#x201D;!&#x2014; Well! one shall have ones wish to <hi rend="italic">that</hi> extent any how&#x2014;with time&#x2014;</p>
<p>On Sunday we went to Addiscombe to stay over night&#x2014; You know what a day of heat Sunday was&#x2014;well we first stewed about an hour in a crowded Steamboat&#x2014;then on reaching the Railway-Station we found ourselves just five minutes too late for one train, and that another would not start for fifty five minutes and all that time we must hang about on our legs in the burning-sunshine the Station being closed on Sundays except at the times for starting&#x2014;at last we got off&#x2014;but there our <foreign>contretemps</foreign> did not end for <pb id="pg-20-205" n="20:205"/>on arriving at the Croydon Station no <hi rend="italic">fly</hi> was procurable to take us to Addiscombe and Carlyle was quite desperate so I declared magnanimously I could <hi rend="italic">walk</hi>&#x2014;and I did walk and up to my bedroom too&#x2014;and there, struggling with illness, washed and dressed myself, and when all ready, had like the cucumber to be thrown&#x2014;not out of window but into bed where I remained till next morning with a splitting headach&#x2014;without sleep&#x2014;the most wretched of mortals&#x2014;for I fancied myself <hi rend="italic">taking a fever</hi>&#x2014;and Lady Harriet has &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">a perfect terror of infection</hi>.&#x201D; Why had I not stayed at home?&#x2014;I did get home<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The rest of the letter is on a torn half sheet, and though bound as if it belonged here, it may not do so.</note></p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I suppose you published the Book yesterday,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Chapman &#x26; Hall&#x2019;s advts. in the <hi rend="italic">Athenaeum</hi>, <date when="1846-06-13">13 June</date>, state that the second edn. of <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi>, in 3 vols., &#x201C;With many Additional Letters,&#x201D; &#x201C;Will be published on Tuesday, <date when="1846-06-16">June 16th</date>.&#x201D; &#x201C;Also, / The ADDITIONAL LETTERS, / Separately, to complete the First Edition.&#x201D;</note> and will now have copies about you. I find I shall need 25 for giving away: if you could send your man over with the <hi rend="italic">first volumes</hi> of so many, and let him stay here an hour or less, I could send him back with the In<supplied>[s]</supplied>criptions on them and the Addresses; and so this part of the business were finished.</p>
<p>There will be a Copy of the Supplement due to every one that got an <pb id="pg-20-206" n="20:206"/>Author&#x2019;s copy of the First Edition: the Addresses of these, so far as I can remember them, I send now; they will not need any Inscription. For one or two who are also to get copies of this second edition, I will mark tomorrow on the address that a supplement for the First is also to be inclosed. You can forward them by your earliest opportunity.</p>
<p>This hot weather is so severe on me, I believe I shall be obliged to leave Town in a week or two if it continue.&#x2014; I have got the <hi rend="italic">Miscellanies</hi> ready for Printing; <hi rend="italic">Heroes</hi> has been in Robson&#x2019;s hands for a good while: I do not design to trouble him with any Proofsheets for either. It will be good that we have a settlement as to these and other matters before I go. I have nearly finished my American and various other affairs; and in fact, in a fortnight or so, shall expect to be free to go when I will. Some morning, almost any morning between this date and that, my Strand business<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Chapman &#x26; Hall were at 186, the Strand.

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Here is a Letter from Alick<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dated <date when="1846-05-23">23 May</date>.</note> which came yesterday; it should have been forwarded to you last night, but something came in the way, and your satisfaction comes a day <hi rend="italic">later</hi> than due. I will try to take care another time. Poor Alick is very well; and, I think, in a good mood of mind too, very serious and very diligent; making a fair figure in that new home of his. I wrote to him by the last Packet as the Dr requested: I inclosed your good little slip of writing which you had made for me;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dated &#x201C;Friday, [end of <date when="1846-05-00">May</date>].&#x201D;</note> a welcome certificate to him, as it had been to me. I hope the hot weather does not hurt you, but that you continue as well as you were. I have had no news at all out of Dumfriesshire since that small Note of yours arrived here.</p>
<p>This day, I believe, they have actually <hi rend="italic">published</hi> that weary Book of mine: after much haggling and delay, we have at length got so far. There will be a Copy for you by the next month&#x2019;s Parcel; a <hi rend="italic">Supplement</hi> for all the others that have already got copies: I have also marked a Copy of the new Book for Jack. The people have but to pay me, and then I have done with <hi rend="italic">it</hi>. <pb id="pg-20-207" n="20:207"/>We have two other Books (new editions of Books) to bargain about; and then I am loose from them. Yesterday I had a Note from Emerson too about my American Books; I expected the American Bookseller<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >G. P. Putnam.</note> today that we might have entered upon our negociation, but he has not come: that once ended, I gather an immense quantity of tagrags as it were into a heap, and fling them <hi rend="italic">all</hi> away from me at last. All this Spring and Summer I have had that kind of work; revising old Books, sorting, settling &#x26;c &#x26;c: rather <hi rend="italic">cobbling</hi> than real generous work. I shall be very glad to be free of it, and look round me in composure for a while again.</p>
<p>Our weather here has grown terribly <hi rend="italic">hot;</hi> really &#x201C;gay ill to do with&#x201D;;&#x2014; today is the hottest of all, wind easterly, Sun blazing like a furnace,&#x2014;I do not venture out at all till evening today, being otherwise not quite so well as usual. Indeed if we have not rain soon, it will be good for us to get away into the Country somewhere; which indeed, so soon as I have fairly got my affairs winded up, all my Books settled &#x26;c, it is my purpose to do. We have not yet settled any <hi rend="italic">place:</hi> but I think the Paulet quarters at Seaforth look somewhat the most inviting,&#x2014;and then it is but a little sail into a Scotland after! We shall see before long.&#x2014; I have sent away my Horse yesterday to be <hi rend="italic">sold</hi>. There was no riding possible except in the evening and morning, neither of which suited me; the Beast too was taking <supplied>[harm]</supplied><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> with the hot<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >NLS 521.41 ends here.</note> Confined stable they have here; and I thinking to get away out of this, far away: on the whole I shall be better rid of him;&#x2014;he was a terrible expense, and a great <hi rend="italic">fash</hi> besides all.</p>
<p>Everybody here is agog about a change of Ministry, concerning which there is much rumour but no certainty at all.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The bill for the repeal of the Corn Laws had passed the Commons, <date when="1846-05-15">15 May,</date> and was to pass the Lords, <date when="1846-06-25">25 June</date>. But Peel had also introduced a coercion bill to treat with the distress in Ireland caused by the famine, which was to pass in the Lords but be defeated in the Commons, resulting in his ministry&#x2019;s downfall.</note> Peel&#x2019;s Corn-bill, it is expected, will be carefully saved; and then, it is said, the Whigs will come in again, and Peel will go. But even that is not entirely certain;&#x2014;and at any rate I think the Whigs will not stay long, and Peel will come back again. I consider him, with all his faults, a man worth any dozen of them.</p>
<p>What is the Doctor doing? He might write me a Letter at any rate, and say!&#x2014; Jane salutes you all. Good b&#x2019;ye, dear Mother: I will write soon again; nay I hope to see you, and all of them again, before very long! Give my kind affection to all from youngest to eldest. Does the Dr take you out to drive? Avoid the extreme heat, for you too I think must have it very hot: the evening will be cheerfullest for you, and do you real good. Take care of yourself, dear Mother.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-20-208" n="20:208"/>That Letter came the other day from certain people: I think they must be statuaries or Stucco-men;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sculptured figures or casts.</note> I answered them as faithfully as I could.&#x2014; You can tell Jack the Countess Hahn-Hahn is here and a great lioness at present:<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ida, Countess von Hahn-Hahn, was in London, staying &#x201C;five of the most tumultous weeks of my life there, whirling like an atom through this universe of diamonds and mud&#x201D; (quoted in J. Pope-Hennessy, <hi rend="italic">Monckton Milnes: The Years of Promise. <date when="1809-00-00">1809</date>&#x2013;<date when="1851-00-00">1851</date></hi> 224). She brought with her the Baron Adolf von Bystram, whom, Milnes told Varnhagen von Ense, she at first &#x201C;called her cousin, then her secret husband, then her guardian, then I don&#x2019;t know what &#x2026; If she had been handsomer, we might have permitted it&#x201D; (Pope-Hennessy 224). Amalie B&#xF6;lte wrote Varnhagen, <date when="1846-07-13">13 July</date>, that the countess had taken London by storm and, unaware of anything odd about her behavior, had inquired why George Sand had not been received in London. TC, she wrote, had made her acquaintance and had been impressed by her naturalness, even though she appeared not to have heard of TC or read his works (<hi rend="italic">Amely B&#xF6;ltes Briefe aus England an Varnhagen von Ense</hi>, ed. W. Fischer and A. Behrens [D&#xfc;sseldorf, <date when="1955-00-00">1955</date>] 39). According to Milnes, Samuel Rogers called Hahn-Hahn and Bystram &#x201C;the ugliest pair of adulterers he had ever had in his house,&#x201D; and Lady Harriet Baring remarked that &#x201C;Madame Hahn-Hahn&#x2019;s teeth quivered like the diamonds our grandmothers used to wear on their heads&#x201D; (Pope-Hennessy 224). Geraldine Jewsbury, writing to JWC, [<date when="1846-06-21">21 June</date>], said of Hahn-Hahn: &#x201C;I feel very interested about her, although I have not read a line of her books &#x2026; I fancy, after all, the world has sense to know realities when it actually sees them (though it puts up with make-believes with wonderful faith)&#x2014;and that &#x2018;Hahn-Hahn&#x2019; and the Baron, being really respectable and neither feeling nor seeming ashamed of themselves, it makes no fuss! I think it is a very good sign of the times, for people just as high in rank have been tabooed, and her being an authoress hardly explains the charitable solecism! &#x2026; But Carlyle putting up with her is the most wonderful thing possible; I thought he was of a real Scotch strictness in those matters, and could not stand &#x2018;George Sandism&#x2019; in theory, let alone practice.&#x201D;</note> well enough, but can &#x201C;<foreign>di&#x2019; tha naither ill na&#x2019; guid!</foreign>&#x201D; <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign> my dear Mother.</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Jameson</salute>
<p>It was not want of common sense that put me on calling for you at <hi rend="italic">that</hi> hour the other evening&#x2014;I knew it was an unlikely hour for finding you&#x2014; but I absolutely cannot move during the heat of the day and I thought it just possible you might be going somewhere to a late dinner and not yet gone. I have been feeling all these days as Darley described himself under the heat of Munich &#x201C;like a serpent trying to stand on its tail&#x201D;!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Darley&#x2019;s expression had become coterie speech.</note></p>
<p>But <hi rend="italic">that</hi> is nothing to the purpose&#x2014;the purpose is will you come here to breakfast tomorrow-week that is <hi rend="italic">Wednesday</hi> of next week. at half after ten? <pb id="pg-20-209" n="20:209"/>Hahn Hahn has promised to come and another Lady whom I should like you to meet<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The other lady is unidentified. Anna Jameson had already met Countess von Hahn-Hahn, in Dresden. She wrote to her mother and eldest sister, <date when="1845-08-27">27 Aug. 1845</date>: &#x201C;I have been introduced to Countess Hahn, and drank tea with her last night, and found her very agreeable and ladylike&#x201D; (G. MacPherson, <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of the Life of Anna Jameson</hi> [<date when="1878-00-00">1878</date>] 211). She wrote to Ottilie von Goethe, <date when="1846-07-19">19 July</date>, that &#x201C;Countess Hahn Hahn has been in London very much <foreign>f&#xEA;t&#xE9;e</foreign>, very fashionable&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Letters of Anna Jameson to Ottilie von Goethe</hi>, ed. G. H. Needler [<date when="1939-00-00">1939</date>] 158).</note>&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>

<salute>Dear Emerson,</salute>
<p>I have had two Letters of yours, the last of them (<date when="1846-05-31">31st May</date>) only two days, and have seen a third written to Wiley of New York.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson&#x2019;s letters to TC, <date when="1846-05-14">14</date> and <date when="1846-05-31">31 May</date>; to Wiley, presumably of <date when="1846-05-08">8 May</date> (see Rusk 3:332).</note> Yesterday Putnam was here, and we made our bargain,&#x2014;and are to have it signed this day at his shop: two copies, one of which I mean to insert along with this, and give up to your or E. P. Clark&#x2019;s keeping.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson gave it to Clark; see his letter to TC, <date when="1846-07-15">15 July</date> (Slater, <hi rend="italic">CEC</hi> 403).</note> For, as you will see, I have appointed Clark my representative, economic plenipotentiary and factotum, if he will consent to act in that sublime capacity,&#x2014;subject always to your advice, to your <hi rend="italic">controul</hi> in all <hi rend="italic">ultra</hi>-economic respects, of which you alone are cognisant of the circumstances or competent to give a judgement. Pray explain this with all lucidity to Mr Clark: and endeavour to impress upon him that it is (to all appearance) a real affair of business we are now engaged in; that I would have him satisfy his own sharp eyes (by such methods as he finds convenient and sufficient, by examination at New York or how he can) that the conditions of this bargain <hi rend="italic">are</hi> fairly complied with by the New York Booksellers,&#x2014;who promise &#x201C;every facility for ascertaining <hi rend="italic">how many</hi> copies are printed,&#x201D; &#x26;c &#x26;c; and profess to be of the integrity of Israelites indeed, in all respects whatever! If so, it may be <pb id="pg-20-210" n="20:210"/>really useful to us. And I would have Mr Clark, if he will allow me to look upon him as my <hi rend="italic">man of business</hi> in this affair, take reasonable pains, be at any reasonable expence &#x26;c (by himself or by deputy) to ascertain that it <hi rend="italic">is</hi> so in very fact! In that case, if something come of it, we shall get the something and be thankful; if nothing come of it, we shall have the pleasure of caring nothing about it.&#x2014; I have given Putnam two Books (<hi rend="italic">Heroes &#x26; Sartor</hi>) ready, corrected;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Wiley &#x26; Putnam edns. of <hi rend="italic">Heroes</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi> have the imprimatur, dated <date when="1846-06-18">18 June 1846</date>: &#x201C;This Book &#x2026; I have read over and revised into a correct style for Messrs. Wiley and Putnam of New York, who are hereby authorized, they and they only, so far as I can authorize them, to print and vend the same in the United States.&#x201D;</note> the others I think will follow in the course of next month;&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">F. Revolution</hi> waits only for an <hi rend="italic">Index</hi> which my man<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Christie.</note> is now busy with. The <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi>, Supplement and all, he has now got,&#x2014;published two days ago, after sorrowful delays. Your Copy will be ready <hi rend="italic">this afternoon</hi>,&#x2014;too late, I fear, by just one day: it will lie, in that case, for a fortnight, and then come. Wiley will find that he has no resource but to reprint the Book; he will reprint the Supplement too, in justice to former purchasers; but this is the <hi rend="italic">final</hi> form of the Book, this second edition; and to this all readers of it will come at last.</p>
<p>We expect the Daguerrotype by next Steamer; but you take good care not to prepossess us on its behalf! In fact, I believe, the only satisfactory course will be to get a Sketch done too; if you have any Painter that can manage it tolerably, pray set about that, as the true solution of the business&#x2014;out of the two together we shall make a likeness for ourselves that will do. Let the Lady Wife be satisfied with it; <hi rend="italic">then</hi> we shall pronounce it genuine!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Promised by Emerson in his letter of <date when="1846-05-31">31 May</date>, when he protested that all three photographs he had had taken were poor: &#x201C;My wife protests against the imprints as slanderous. My friends say, they look ten years older, and, as I think, with the air of a decayed gentleman touched with his first paralysis. However I got yesterday a trusty vote or two for sending one of them to you, on the ground that I am not likely to get a better.&#x201D; Lydia Emerson, b. Jackson (d. <date when="1892-00-00">1892</date>), Emerson&#x2019;s second wife; see <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410221-TC-LEM-01"><sic>13:40</sic><corr>TC to LEM, <date when="1841-02-21">21 Feb. 1841</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014;</p>
<p>I envy you your forest-work, your summer umbrages, and clear silent lakes.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson wrote to TC, <date when="1846-05-14">14 May</date>: &#x201C;Last fall I bought a piece of more than forty acres on the border of a little lake half a mile wide &#x26; more, called Walden Pond &#x2026; In these <date when="1846-05-00">May</date> days, when maples poplars oaks birches walnut &#x26; pine are in their spring glory, I go thither every afternoon, &#x26; cut with my hatchet an Indian path through the thicket all along the bold shore, &#x26; open the finest pictures &#x2026; At a good distance in from the shore the land rises to rocky head, perhaps sixty feet above the water. Thereon I think to place a hut, perhaps it will have two stories &#x26; be a petty tower &#x2026; There I hope to go with book &#x26; pen when good hours come. I shall think there, a fortnight might bring you from London to Walden Pond.&#x201D;</note> The weather here is getting insupportable to us for heat. Indeed if rain do not come within two weeks, I believe we must wind up our affairs, and make for some shady place direct:&#x2014;Scotland is perhaps likeliest; but <pb id="pg-20-211" n="20:211"/>nothing yet is fixed: you shall duly hear.&#x2014; Directly after this, I set off for Putnam&#x2019;s in Waterloo Place; sign his papers there; stick one Copy under a Cover for you, and despatch.&#x2014; Send me word about all that you are doing and thinking. <closer><salute>Be busy, be still and happy.

<salute>Sir</salute>
<p>Will you be pleased to accept from a very private citizen of the Community this Copy of a Book,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The second edn. of <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi>. Somewhat earlier TC had said to Espinasse that Peel had &#x201C;the courage of a lion&#x201D; and &#x201C;would set up a permanent establishment in this country&#x201D; (Espinasse 89). TC&#x2019;s views of Peel can also be traced in the Spedding brothers&#x2019; letters; see K. J. Fielding, &#x201C;Carlyle and the Speddings: New Letters,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Carlyle Newsletter</hi> 7 (<date when="1986-00-00">1986</date>):12&#x2013;20. See also Jules Seigel, &#x201C;Carlyle and Peel: the Prophet&#x2019;s Search for a Heroic Politician and an Unpublished Fragment,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Victorian Studies</hi> 26 (<date when="1983-00-00">1983</date>):181&#x2013;95, which quotes TC&#x2019;s later comment that he had &#x201C;such a respect&#x201D; for Peel&#x2019;s qualities &#x201C;as I cannot pretend to entertain towards any other of the class called statesman that have walked this stage of St. Stephens in my time.&#x201D; It was a dramatic change from his satire of Peel as Sir Jabez Windbag in <hi rend="italic">Past and Present</hi>.</note> which he has been engaged in putting together, while you our most conspicuous citizen were victoriously labouring in quite other work. Labour, so far as it is true, and sanctionable by the Supreme Worker and World-Founder, may claim brotherhood with labour; the great work and the little are alike definable as an extricating of the true from its imprisonment amid the false; a victorious evoking of order and fact from disorder and semblance of fact. In any case, citizens who feel grateful to a citizen are permitted and enjoined to testify that feeling, each in such manner as he can. Let this poor labour of mine be a small testimony of that sort to a late great and valiant labour of yours, and claim reception as such.</p>
<p>The Book, should you ever find leisure to read and master it, may perhaps have interest for you;&#x2014;may perhaps, who knows, have admonition, exhortation; in various ways, instruction and encouragement for yet other labours which England, in a voiceless but most impressive manner, still expects and demands of you! The authentic words and actings of the noblest Governor England ever had may well have interest for all Governors of England; may well be, as all &#x201C;Scripture&#x201D; is, as all genuine words and <pb id="pg-20-212" n="20:212"/>actings are, &#x201C;profitable,&#x201D;&#x2014;profitable for reproof, for correction, and for edifying and strengthening withal!&#x2014;</p>

Loud-sounding clamour, and rhetorical vocables, not grounded on fact, not even on belief of fact,&#x2014;one knows from of old whither all that, and what depends on it, is bound! But by and by, as I believe, all England will say, what already many a one begins to feel, that whatever were the spoken unveracities in Parliament,&#x2014;and they are many on all hands, lamentable to gods and men,&#x2014;here has a great veracity been <hi rend="italic">done</hi> in Parliament, considerably our greatest for many years past; a strenuous, courageous and manful thing,&#x2014;to which all of us that so see it are bound to give our loyal recognition and such furtherance as we can.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Peel replied from Whitehall, <date when="1846-06-22">22 June</date>: &#x201C;Whatever may have been the pressure of my public Engagements, it has not been so overwhelming as to prevent me from being familiar with your exertions in another department of Labour as incessant and severe as that to which I have undergone. / I am the better enabled therefore to appretiate [sic] the value of your favourable opinion, and to thank you, not out of mere courtesy but very sincerely, for the Volumes which you have sent for my acceptance, most interesting as throwing a new Light upon a very important Chapter of our History and gratifying to me as a token of your personal Esteem.&#x201D;</note></p>

<p>It only remains now that I return you very hearty thanks once more for all your courtesy and helpfulness to me in this matter; and earnestly urge you to go on with your own researches, which cannot fail, when gone into with such exactness, to become more and more interesting, the more the public feeling is awakened to the meaning of those old times. I find more clearly than before that Cambridge, as Chief Town and Garrison of the Eastern Association, was a very important place during the Civil War; and I persuade myself there remain yet many points of its history to be elicited in that respect.</p>

<p>Greathirst had asked &#xa3;40 and &#xa3;50 for the Horse: on reading your Note, which agrees with our experience here, I decided that we would not sell on those terms; that I had better take the animal into the country with me, have the good of him in the meanwhile, and dispose of him there. He is likely to get a ride in the railway to Liverpool, where a friend of mine is in want of such an article: I may have some good galloping along the sands there; and poor Bobus (so we name him), if he do not suit Lancashire either, may get across into Dumfriesshire, and rest there.

<salute>Dear Jenny,</salute>
<p>I heard of your arrival in your new place at Dumfries a day or two ago; and on Saturday I sent you a Newspaper which I suppose you will receive this morning. You will understand it as a hasty token that we are in our usual way, and still mindful of you, tho&#x2019; there has been little express writing of late.</p>
<p>No doubt you will feel a little lonely, unaccustomed, and now and then dispirited and anxious in your new situation: yet I do consider it a very fit change for you to have made; and believe confidently you will find yourself much more comfortable than you have been in your old place, if once you are fairly <foreign><hi rend="italic">hefted</hi></foreign> [adjusted] to the new one. Do not be discouraged, my little Jenny; I know you will behave always in a <foreign><hi rend="italic">douce</hi></foreign> [gentle], prudent, industrious and wise way; and there is no fear of you, if so. You will be mistress of your own little hearth at any rate; free to follow your own wisest purposes. I think you will gradually find work too, which may be useful to you;&#x2014;in short this is a fact always, in Maxwelltown and in all towns and situations, A person that does act wisely will find wise and good results following him, in this world and in all worlds. Which really is the comfort of poor struggling creatures here below.&#x2014; And I hope you understand firmly always that you have friends who will never forsake you, whom all considerations bind to help you what they can in the honest fight you are making. So do not fear, my poor little Sister; be wise and true, and diligent to do the <hi rend="italic">best</hi> you can; and it shall all be well yet, and better than we hope.</p>
<p>Getting into a new House, it strikes me, you must find various things defective and not yet in order, so you must take this bit of paper from me which James Aitken, on Wednesday first, will change into three sovereigns for you;&#x2014;and you must lay them out in furnitures and bits of equipments such as you see needfullest: I know nobody that could lay them out better, and make more advantage of them than you will do. Only you are to consider that this is a supernumerary thing, a clear <hi rend="italic">gift;</hi> and that your regular income<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Paid semiannually by TC and John Carlyle</note> (which John said was to be enlarged,&#x2014;whatever he may <pb id="pg-20-216" n="20:216"/>have settled it) will arrive at the usual time, independently of this. And so my blessing with you, dear little Jenny; and right good days to you in this new dwelling,&#x2014;right <hi rend="italic">wise</hi> days, which are the only good ones!&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>I have owed Jean a letter this long time. Tell her a box of <hi rend="italic">Supplements</hi> to Cromwell (one for each of you) and two new Copies of the whole Book (one for my Mother, the other for Jack) will reach her in a day or two; which she will know how to dispose of. For the rest, I am fast getting through my work, it is mere <hi rend="italic">tatters</hi> of work now; and expect to be off northward before long. <hi rend="italic">Northward</hi> we do mean; Jane sometimes talks of being off this week, and I to follow in a week or two. To Seaforth, Liverpool, is Jane&#x2019;s first place. I of course, will soon be across, if once there. Good be with you dear Sister.</p>
<closer><salute>Yours always, /</salute></closer> <name>T.C.</name>
<ps><p>Do <hi rend="italic">you</hi> address the next Newspaper to us, if this come all right: that will be a sufficient sign to us.</p></ps>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I should have written to you before now; at all events I might have taken an earlier hour of this day, which has been a very idle one with me, and it is now past nine at night:&#x2014;however, I have decided not to make bad worse by neglecting my purpose altogether. <supplied>[And]</supplied> so here I sit, with Jane and the two candles removed up stairs, and will walk to the Post-Office with a word for you before I sleep.</p>
<p>The Horse, of the sale of which I spoke to you last time with uncertainty, came back to me next day <hi rend="italic">un</hi>sold; and is now mine again, and is certainly to go Northward before I part with him. The Paulets, it appears, are in actual want of a horse; will be glad to receive this of mine, if I go thither; to Paulet&#x2019;s therefore I think this animal will go,&#x2014;taking his passage in the railway most likely. As we have a good bit of the Summer still before us, and are not ill off for money at present, I like this settlement of the question well enough, and expect we shall still find a pennyworth in keeping a riding and vehiculating servant for our wants: but after the Summer is done, I shall desiderate being <hi rend="italic">quit</hi> of my equestrian dignity, and do not think I shall soon venture on a riding apparatus for London again. The roads about this region, with so many railways &#x26;c, are getting ever more unpleasant for riding; for which too, I suppose, I am getting too old: at any rate the expense and trouble are in a very high proportion indeed to any benefit for health that one can trace in the affair. So much for the &#x201C;settlement of the Horse.&#x201D;</p>
<p><pb id="pg-20-218" n="20:218"/>The Book <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi>, as I told you last time, is out, and doing well; the Bookseller was here on Saturday, and <hi rend="italic">paid</hi> me for it: so that this too is now all settled. Our other republications, <hi rend="italic">Heroes</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Miscellanies</hi> are also gone to press; but about the latter we have still some haggling about prices to transact; in which however I expect the bibliopolic genius will have to yield to mine. I have said &#xa3;400 for the <hi rend="italic">Miscellanies</hi>, and I will make the man comply if I can. As I do not intend to trouble myself with <hi rend="italic">proofsheets</hi> for either of these Books, we may consider this likewise as pretty nearly settled.&#x2014; There remains some fraction of American matter to settle,&#x2014; Christie is doing an <hi rend="italic">Index</hi> for the <hi rend="italic">F. Rev</hi>n for one thing:&#x2014;this once done, I am as it were free to quit London, and take m<supplied>[y]</supplied> holiday for a little when I like. Christie promises to be ready about Friday; after which another week might finish all that American concern, if I were very diligent at it. But in fact I am not diligent; I am as it were taking my holiday already, and indeed often think, in this fine <foreign><hi rend="italic">caller</hi></foreign> [fresh] weather, I may be as well here as in another place. The day after I wrote (I think), we had our thunderstorm here too; change of wind to the west,&#x2014;where it still continues, with occasional showers, very brisk and pleasant weather indeed.&#x2014; &#x2014; Poor Jane, however, has not been well, and the hot weather lies very hard upon us both: and now that I am go<supplied>[t]</supplied> fresh again, she still continues weakly; indeed within the last three days she has got a <hi rend="italic">cold</hi> over and above, which however is now abating again. She had settled to set off to Pauletdom on <hi rend="italic">Saturday first</hi>, and still talks of going, I to follow in a week or two: but it seems a little uncertain now whether all her punctuality of appointment will prevail for that day. As to my own departure I cannot yet speak of any day or even week (a blaze of hot weather would send me off at once): but I mean in general to go thither, so soon as my miscellany of small tagraggeries here are knit up into any kind of finish.&#x2014; &#x2014; This long story with little in it is all I can tell you about our plans or projects at present.</p>
<p>Peel, as you will have heard, is out; has retired in what is considered a very triumphant and promising manner. I and many others think he will probably come in again soon. Above a week ago, taking counsel about the thing, I decided on sending him a Copy of the <hi rend="italic">Cromwell;</hi> which I did, along with the Letter here copied; and received the Answer which I also send you to read to my Mother: you can then return the Letters, or keep them safe till we meet.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In the margin of the first page John Carlyle wrote: &#x201C;Scotsbrig Friday <date when="1846-07-03">3d July</date>. My dear Jean, I think you will like very much to see these two letters. Return them without an avoidable delay to our brother in London. They need not be shown to any but your own household &#x26; Jenny; and must in no case be trusted to Dan [unidentified]. Our mother is better&#x2014;&#x26; stirring about in her usual way. She greatly regrets that your visit was so hurried.&#x201D;</note> It was on the whole a successful adventure this; well received by the &#x201C;Governor of England&#x201D;; and expressive of a feeling <pb id="pg-20-219" n="20:219"/>sincerely enough entertained in my own mind:&#x2014;all right, therefore, this too.&#x2014; Today there came all in all in a <supplied>[word missing]</supplied> four Yankee Newspapers (Albany, New York) with a wonderful Controversy about me,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In response to Elizur Wright&#x2019;s attack on TC (see <ref target="volume-20/lt-18460418-TC-RWE-01">TC to RWE, <date when="1846-04-18">18 April</date></ref>), Beriah Green (<date when="1795-00-00">1795</date>&#x2013;<date when="1874-00-00">1874</date>), American clergyman and abolitionist, defended TC in the Albany, N.Y., <hi rend="italic">Patriot</hi>. William Goodell joined the controversy, reported in full in the <hi rend="italic">Weekly Chronotype</hi>, <date when="1846-06-17">17 June</date>. See Slater, <hi rend="italic">CEC</hi> 406n.</note>&#x2014; which Jane magnanimously declines to read a word of, really not unwisely I believe: tomorrow or next day I will clip out the passages, and send them for the benefit of Scotsbrig I think. &#x201C;<foreign>Di&#x2019; tha naither ill na&#x2019; guid</foreign>.&#x201D;</p>
<p>I wrote a bit Letter to Jenny, poor little Jenny: I think she will do better in Dumfries; one feels a true sympathy with her in her poor little <foreign><hi rend="italic">hadding</hi></foreign> [dwelling] yonder. This weather, I think, is good for my Mother, and for all affairs at Scotsbrig? I hope before long to see with my own eyes what is going on there. The &#x201C;Photograph,&#x201D;&#x2014;alas, it is never yet done, owing to my own idleness and that of Lawrence;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-20/lt-18460430-TC-SL-01">TC to SL, <date when="1846-04-30">30 April</date></ref>.</note> but it <hi rend="italic">shall</hi> be done by and by if I prosper! That is certain.&#x2014; One of the things I am busy meditating at present is a Box for Alick,&#x2014;long promised, now to be performed. I find <hi rend="italic">Liverpool</hi> will be the best place to send it from. The Paulets undertake to get it well forwarded: I will tell you more of it next time. <closer><salute>Goodnight, dear Brother, dear Mother &#x26; you all!</salute></closer> <name>T. C.</name></p>

<p>This Index,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For <hi rend="italic">The French Revolution</hi>, prepared by John Christie.</note> unfortunately rather indistinctly written, is nevertheless legible, and essentially (I think) very correct withal. It will require to be read, and attended to, at the Printing-Office, by an intelligent assiduous man, who is to verify the entries, and alter the pages (for the new Edition), with all exactness. The best Index, if the <hi rend="italic">pages</hi> in it are wrong, is worth simply <hi rend="italic">nothing:</hi> let him remember that.&#x2014; If he examine accurately the English <hi rend="italic">Index to Cromwell&#x2019;s Letters &#x26; Speeches</hi> 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Edition, which is done by the same hand, he will get to understand what this aims to be, and find all obscurities (I hope) yield to him. The places where there is a <hi rend="italic">change into a new volume</hi>, ought to be (as then) conspicuously indicated (by a <hi rend="italic">dash</hi> or black line); I also give him charge of helping the uniformity of Capital Letters, Italics and Punctuation;&#x2014;and on the whole earnestly request the exertion of punctuality, faithful intelligence and vigilance, in this matter: <pb id="pg-20-220" n="20:220"/>qualities which of course my said reader and compositor ought to <hi rend="italic">have</hi> before starting, otherwise he cannot exert them.</p>

<p><salute>My Dear,</salute> I hope it is only displeasure or embarrassed estrangement from me, and not any accident or illness of your own, that robs me of a Note this morning. I will not torment myself with that new uneasiness: but you did expressly promise at our parting to announce your arrival straightway.&#x2014; This is not good; but perhaps an unfriendly or miserable Letter would have been worse: so I will be patient as I can.&#x2014; Certainly we never before parted in such a manner! And all for,&#x2014;literaly,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS. As explained in <ref target="volume-20/lt-18460629-JWC-HW-01">JWC to HW, [<date when="1846-06-30">30 June</date>]</ref>, JWC had decided to stay with the Paulets at Seaforth, for which she left on Sat., <date when="1846-07-04">4 July</date>. According to Froude (<hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi> 3:379), &#x201C;there was a violent scene when they parted,&#x201D; for which he seems to have no direct evidence but these letters. He reasonably ascribes it to JWC&#x2019;s jealousy of TC&#x2019;s absorption with Lady Harriet Baring as much as with the second edn. of <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi>. He seems right in believing that she expressed herself bitterly and that TC, in the letters that follow, was &#x201C;struggling in a cobweb, and was not on the way to extricate himself&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-03/lt-18251019-TC-JBW-01"><sic>3:388</sic><corr>TC to JBW, <date when="1825-10-19">19 Oct. 1825</date></corr></ref>). A. Carlyle, on the other hand, says that &#x201C;there was &#x2026; a trifling misunderstanding between Mrs. Carlyle and her Husband regarding their intimacy with Lady Harriet; but it was only a fleeting cloud, and was almost immediately dispelled. Mr. Froude &#x2026; has made a mountain of a molehill in writing of the Lady Harriet episode. Nothing could exceed his exaggeration, inaccuracy, and, I fear I must add misrepresentation, in treating of this affair&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">NLM</hi> 1:186). In spite of Froude&#x2019;s occasional inaccuracies this is unfair; and A. Carlyle himself withheld several of the original letters written at this time, which have still not come to light. From JWC&#x2019;s letters earlier in the year it can be seen that she was depressed, ill, suffering from insomnia, finding relief in drugs, and exasperated at TC&#x2019;s preoccupation with work and the Barings. Whatever the truth of the matter, it was not &#x201C;trifling.&#x201D;</note>&#x2014;Nothing! But I will not enter upon that at all. Composure, and reflexion, at a distance from all causes of irritation and freaks of diseased fancy, will shew us both more clearly what the God&#x2019;s Truth of the matter <hi rend="italic">is:</hi> may God give us strength to follow piously and with all loyal fidelity what that is!&#x2014;</p>
<p>On coming home on Saturday, in miserable enough humour, the saddest I think I have been in for ten years and more, I directly got out my work, <pb id="pg-20-221" n="20:221"/>and sat down to <hi rend="italic">it</hi> as to the one remedy I had. All day I toiled at Christies <hi rend="italic">Index</hi> (a very ugly <foreign><hi rend="italic">burbly</hi></foreign> [intricate] job indeed), and all next day; and have just finished it, five minutes ago. These two Notes were lying for me, Redwood&#x2019;s with a breath of something like comfort in it: I thought of sending them off to you for your Sunday morning; but delayed till too long,&#x2014;felt indeed that I could <hi rend="italic">write</hi> little along with them that would be comfortable. I was in fact in very bad health too. Robertson interrupted me in the evening; not very welcome;&#x2014;and ended in a late walk. Yesterday I suppose you fancied me very happy at Addiscombe; alas, I was in no humour for anything of that laughing nature: I sat digging all day in the rubbish-heaps of Christie,&#x2014;a frightfully hot forenoon; then wind and clouds rising, I went out to ride, had decided on riding to settle with Greathirst and his Portland-Place Stable-keeper; did ride thither, and settle, forcing myself, tho&#x2019; horribly indisposed to it;&#x2014;attempted to gallop home again, seeing thunder nigh; was overtaken by thunder, by rain &#x26;c, but got home little worse notwithstanding; and dined upon a <hi rend="italic">bread-pudding</hi>, which has agreed very ill with me. John Chorlie<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cherley.</note> about 8 p.m. came and roused me from my <hi rend="italic">Christie</hi>, smoked, clattered, and finally went out to walk with me (Helen&#x2019;s time for coming in being at hand): this was my only company throughout the day;&#x2014;a day of the <hi rend="italic">resurrection</hi> of all sad and great and tender things within me; sad withal as very death, yet not unprofitable, I believe. Perhaps not.&#x2014; There had come a Letter from Dunlop too;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably John Dunlop (<date when="1789-00-00">1789</date>&#x2013;<date when="1868-00-00">1868</date>), Scottish poet and temperance reformer; see <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410122-TC-JDU-01"><sic>13:22</sic><corr>TC to JDU, <date when="1841-01-22">22 Jan. 1841</date></corr></ref>.</note> and today there are other babble-babbles, worth nothing at all. I now wait for my Horse in a short time; shall have wind enough and probably rain. The weather, since the sharp thunderstorm, is considerably cooled. I was awake about 5 o&#x2019;clock: if not in too bad spirits still, I am due at Stanhope-Street in the evening;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >At the Barings&#x2019;.</note> if otherwise I will walk to Putnam&#x2019;s with my completed <hi rend="italic">Index</hi>.&#x2014; Nothing here will suit the Picture at Laurence&#x2019;s;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The portrait of TC to be sent to his mother; see <ref target="volume-20/lt-18460714-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1846-07-14">14 July</date></ref></note> I am obliged to get a new Box made. I wish there were any work for my Horse beside you; any <hi rend="italic">grass</hi> for him even: he is doing no good here; is even sickly still, and unthriving in the heat. At worst, I must send him off to Scotsbrig soon.&#x2014; <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign> my Dearest (for that <hi rend="italic">is</hi>, and if madness prevail not, may forever be, your authentic title): be quiet, do not doubt of me, do not yield to the Enemy of us all, &#x2014;and may God bless thee always!</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>My Dear&#x2014;</salute>I was not up to writing yesterday &#x2026; To-day I am more awake, and entertain a devout imagination of going to see my Uncle and Cousins; but something whispers to me that it will be <hi rend="italic">no go</hi>.</p>
<p>My journey was highly prosperous; the <foreign><hi rend="italic">Bubechen</hi></foreign> and <foreign><hi rend="italic">Madechen</hi></foreign> [little boy and girl] who were in the carriage with me felt no temptation to address me in articulate speech, nor to address one another; so that we came from London to Liverpool in profound silence. Before the train had well stopt, the Navigator&#x2019;s face was grinning welcome in at the window on me,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#xc9;tienne Paulet, according to A. Carlyle.</note> and Betsy waited a few yards off, that she might not fuss me till the Navigator had possessed himself of my luggage.</p>
<p>Seaforth looks beautifully calm and green, except when it thunders and lightens, which it almost continually does. Betsy has got a cough, and seems to be rather out of spirits, for <hi rend="italic">her</hi>. Paulet has renewed his age, and has two clear eyes, and is, with the best intentions, always wearisome as heretofore.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Variation of coterie speech &#x201C;always unfortunate, with the best intentions.&#x201D;</note> I shall do quite well here for a while, as I have the amplest tolerance granted me to be as ugly and stupid and disagreeable as ever I please,&#x2014;the only satisfaction in life which I aspire to for the moment. For <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, you must feel as if a millstone had been taken off your breast.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Apparently JWC wrote despairingly to Mazzini. His replies, of <date when="1846-07-10">10</date> and <date when="1846-07-15">15 July</date>, were printed in part in Froude, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi> 3:380&#x2013;82, 384&#x2013;85 and then in full in <hi rend="italic">Scritti</hi> 30:69&#x2013;73, 372&#x2013;75. He wrote, <date when="1846-07-10">10 July</date>: &#x201C;My dear Friend, I was yesterday almost the whole day out, and did not receive your note except in the evening when it was too late to answer them. Your few words sound sad, deeply, I will not say irreperably sad, and the worst of it is that none can help you but yourself. It is only you who can, by a calm dispassionate fair re-examination of the past, send back to nothingness the ghosts and phantoms you have been conjuring up: it is only you who can teach yourself that, whatever the <hi rend="italic">present</hi> may be, you <hi rend="italic">must</hi> front it with dignity, with a clear perception of all your duties, with a due reverence to your immortal soul, with a religious faith in times yet to come that are to dawn under the approach of other cloudless suns. I could only point to you duties the fulfilment of which can make Life not happy&#x2014;what can?&#x2014;but earnest, sacred, and resignated; but I would make you frown or scorn: we have a different conception of Life, and are condemned here down to walk on two parallels. Still, it is the feeling of those duties that saves me from the atheisms of Despair. &#x2026; Awake and arise, dear friend: beset by pain or not, we must go on with a smile and a practical encouragement from one another &#x2026; Your life proves an empty thing, you say? Empty! do not blaspheme; have you never done good? have you never loved? Think of your mother and do good. Let the rest to Providence. It is not as a mere piece of irony that God has placed us here; not as a mere piece of irony that he has given to us those aspirations, those yearnings after happiness, that are now making us both unhappy. Cant you trust him a little longer? / How long will you remain at Seaforth? Does he propose to go himself anywhere? I was coming to see you on Saturday.&#x201D; It has been supposed (e.g., by Fred Kaplan, <hi rend="italic">Thomas Carlyle, A Biography</hi> [<date when="1983-00-00">1983</date>] 278, 311) that JWC asked Mazzini whether she should leave TC and that he advised her not to, but there is no real evidence that this is so.</note></p>
<p><closer><salute><pb id="pg-20-223" n="20:223"/>My kind regards to Helen. I will write to herself soon, giving her some directions for her practical activity, which I had not head for before I left. &#x2026;</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>Thousand thanks, dear Goody, for thy good little Letter!</salute> I was right thankful for the Newspaper, which came alone, at the usual time of Post; the Note afterwards, with a ring of the bell for itself, arrived at one. So kind and good a little message! It has lifted a mountain from my poor inner-man. O if you could see <hi rend="italic">there</hi>, the real fact of the thing, verily it would all be <hi rend="italic">well</hi>, it would indeed,&#x2014;as by God&#x2019;s blessing it shall yet be! And so, let us say not a word more of it; but pray earnestly from our very inmost heart that we <hi rend="italic">may</hi> be enabled to do all that is true and good and helpful not hindersome to one another; and, in spite of our anomalous lot, be found as wise ones not as foolish. For <hi rend="italic">thy</hi> great unwearied goodness and true ever-watchful affection, mixed as it is with human infirmity,&#x2014;O my Dearest, woe to me forever, if I could forget it, or be in any way unjust to it! But let us say nothing; let us each try to see, try to do,&#x2014;better always and better. And one thing does remain ever clear to me, ever sure for both of us, No honourable truly good and noble thing we do or have done for one another but <hi rend="italic">will</hi> bear its good fruit. That is as true as Truth itself: a faith that should never fail us. And so enough.&#x2014;</p>
<p>Today Chapman has been here; <hi rend="italic">agrees</hi> to the &#xa3;400.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edward Chapman had agreed to the sum TC asked for the new edn. of the <hi rend="italic">Miscellanies;</hi> see <ref target="volume-20/lt-18460630-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1846-06-30">30 June</date></ref>.</note> I have made <hi rend="italic">Chartism</hi> ready for the Yankee market,&#x2014;or at least ready for Robson&#x2019;s making it. <hi rend="italic">Your</hi> Copy I will make him return to me; we will not send that to America, but keep it.&#x2014; I do not ride today; my Horse was so weak yesterday. If the Paulet&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">have</hi> work for a horse, really Bobus is fit to do it, and might be worth his hay there: but for the rest, how can one dream of making their kindness a convenience in that matter! &#x201C;Neva&#x2019;!&#x201D; Nay Bobus, so long as I am here, <hi rend="italic">will</hi> be of <hi rend="italic">some</hi> use to me: and his keep, were he of none, will not ruin us for a while!&#x2014;</p>

<p><salute>My dear Husband</salute><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A. Carlyle curiously notes that while at Seaforth JWC generally used notepaper with &#x201C;My dear Husband&#x201D; printed at the top of the page. He is evidently referring to the comic, fancy notepaper, of which there are examples in <ref target="volume-19/lt-18450813-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1845-08-13">13</date>&#x2013;<date when="1845-08-14">14 Aug. 1845</date>]</ref>, and <ref target="volume-19/lt-18450820-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, <date when="1845-08-20">20 Aug. 1845</date></ref>. It evidently belonged to the Paulets, possibly the adolescent Julia. Since we do not have the originals of this period. A. Carlyle&#x2019;s comment cannot be verified, but if true it is a sign of friendly informality rather than formality.</note><salute>&#x2014;</salute> Your two Letters, the one dated Tuesday and the other Wednesday, are both come together this morning. The Seaforth Post does not appear to do its duty so well as England might expect. The Newspaper which you only received on the same day with my Note was sent off on Sunday in good time for the Post.</p>
<p>&#x2026;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A. Carlyle omits passages in this letter and in <ref target="volume-20/lt-18460706-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, <date when="1846-07-06">6 July</date></ref>. Since we do not have the MS of either letter, his excisions suggest that the missing passages may have weakened his argument that there was no serious quarrel between JWC and TC before she left for Liverpool.</note> My Cousins Helen and Mary spent the day here yesterday. My Uncle I have not yet seen,&#x2014;he was out when I called. They all find me looking shockingly, especially Betsy, who told me the other night (with the same want of tact which put her on telling Geraldine that she &#x201C;had lost her looks very soon&#x201D;) that I had &#x201C;got exactly the look of her Sister Marianne before she died of brain fever!&#x201D; I suppose I shall improve in appearance, however, since I am certainly &#x201C;eating above two ounces a day,&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-20/lt-18460700-TC-LHB-01">preceding letter</ref>. Mary Ann Newton had died of typhus fever.</note> and taking Dr. Christie&#x2019;s medicine very faithfully. My cough is still very tiresome; but I have no pain with it, so that it may take its time.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-20-226" n="20:226"/>The horse department is in the greatest confusion still; but I do not see that it would be at all <hi rend="italic">remedied</hi> by the addition of Bobus&#x2014;without his Master. A carriage horse is still to be bought; but it must be seventeen hands high, to match a great strong beast that is already here,&#x2014;the new carriage weighing nearly <hi rend="italic">two</hi> tons! You are a greater man than Abdel Kadir,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Abd-al-Kadir (<date when="1807-00-00">1807</date>?&#x2013;<date when="1883-00-00">83</date>), emir of Mascara, who fought against the French for Algerian independence and was to surrender, <date when="1847-12-00">Dec. 1847</date>.</note> but not so identified with your <hi rend="italic">horse</hi> that a visit from <hi rend="italic">it</hi> should be aspired to as the next best honour to a visit from yourself. Still they are very good-natured here, and if you are in a decided difficulty with your horse, send it.</p>
<p>We have almost constant rain hitherto, and our exercise has to be taken in the verandah.</p>
<p>I feel myself a dreadful bore&#x2014;though Betsy&#x2019;s patience is immense.</p>

<p>The second edition of &#x2018;Cromwell&#x2019; which has kept me sunk all spring and summer in a very ignoble kind of labour, is now off my hands for ever. The lively interest the people have taken in that heavy book&#x2014;the numbers that read, and in some good measure understand something of it; all this is really surprising to me. I take it as one other symptom of the rapidly <pb id="pg-20-227" n="20:227"/>deepening seriousness of the public mind, which certainly has call enough to be serious at present. The conviction, too, among all persons of much moment seems to be pretty unanimous, that this is actually the history of Oliver; that the former histories of him have been extraordinary mistakes&#x2014; very fallacious histories&#x2014;as of a man walking about for two centuries in a <hi rend="italic">universal masked ball</hi> (of hypocrites and their hypocrisies spoken and done), with a mask upon him, this man, which no cunningest artist could get off. They tried it now this way, now that: still the mask was felt to remain: the mask would not come off. At length a lucky thought strikes us. This man <hi rend="italic">is in his natural face</hi>. That is the mask of this one! Of all which I am heartily glad. In fact, it often strikes me as the fellest virulence of all the misery that lies upon us in these distracted generations, this blackest form of <hi rend="italic">incredulity</hi> we have all fallen into, that great men, too, were paltry shuffling Jesuits, as we ourselves are, and meant nothing true in their work, or mainly meant lies and hunger in their work, even as we ourselves do. There will never be anything but an <hi rend="italic">enchanted</hi> world, till that baleful phantasm of the pit be chased thither again, and very sternly bidden abide there. Alas! alas! It often seems to me as if poor Loyola and that <hi rend="italic">world</hi> Jesuitry of which he is the sacrament and symbol,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >St. Ignatius of Loyola (<date when="1491-00-00">1491</date>&#x2013;<date when="1556-00-00">1556</date>), Spanish ecclesiastic, founder of the Society of Jesus (Jesuits).</note> was the blackest, most godless spot in the whole history of Adam&#x2019;s posterity: a solemn wedding together in God&#x2019;s high name of truth and falsehood&#x2014;as if the two were now one flesh and could not subsist apart&#x2014;whereby, as some one now says, we are all become Jesuits, and the falsity of them has, as it were, obtained its apotheosis and is henceforth a consecrated falsity.</p>
<p>My wife went off a few days ago to Lancashire. She had been in a very weakly way ever since our summer heats came on, had much need of quiet and fresh air &#x2026; I, too, am tattered and fretted into great sorrow of heart; but that is partly the nature of the beast, I believe&#x2014;that will be difficult to cure in this world.</p>

<salute>Dearest M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Russell</salute>
<p>Your note found me again at Seaforth where I have been for the last week. The Great heat of London in the beginning of <date when="1846-06-00">June</date> had made me quite ill again, and as my Husband could not make up his mind yet, <hi rend="italic">where</hi> to go, or <hi rend="italic">when</hi>, I made up my own mind independently of him one fine morning, and started off hither, which has become a sort of <hi rend="italic">house of refuge</hi> for me of late years. My Husband talked of following me in a week or two and then taking me with him to Scotland&#x2014;but whether I shall be able to bring my mind to <hi rend="italic">that</hi> when the time comes heaven knows. The idea of Scotland under the actual circumstances is so extremely desolate for me that I should need to get a little more strength here, both physical and moral, before it were possible for me to entertain it practically. I fancy it were easier for me to go to Haddington than to Dumfriesshire&#x2014; I <hi rend="italic">have</hi> been <hi rend="italic">there</hi> since <hi rend="italic">it</hi> was all changed and myself become a sort of stranger in it&#x2014; A family of good women who were dearly attached to my Mother are very desirous that I would pay them a visit<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;The Misses Donaldson&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note in <hi rend="italic">LM</hi>).</note>&#x2014;and I have not yet said positively that I <hi rend="italic">will not</hi>&#x2014; We shall see&#x2014;</p>
<p>Meanwhile Tuesday is my birthday&#x2014;when I must not be forgotten by those who have been used to remember it&#x2014; I send a little parcel for Margaret to your kind care&#x2014;and will thank you to give Mary five shillings for me.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Margaret Hiddlestone, the excellent widow servant.&#x201D; &#x201C;Mary Mills, who used to depend on charitable Templand, weeding the garden, &#x26;c. To me who know the matter, what a piercing beauty in those rigorously punctual small gifts; sad as death, and grand, too, as death&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note in <hi rend="italic">LM</hi>).</note> or rather to lay it out for her on a pair of shoes or tea or what you think fittest. I will send a post office order in repayment the first day I go to Liverpool&#x2014;</p>
<p>I spent part of the day there yesterday&#x2014;and saw my Uncle who was absent on my first visit&#x2014; He looks pretty well, and is very patient under the feebleness of age&#x2014; My Cousins Helen and Mary were here on Wednesday and promise to come and see me often, without taking it ill of me that I prefer staying here in this quiet roomy country house, to <hi rend="italic">being cooped</hi> up in Maryland Street which is worse for one&#x2019;s health than Cheyne Row&#x2014; Margaret<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;&#x2018;Maggie&#x2019; <foreign><hi rend="italic">hodie</hi></foreign> [today]&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note in <hi rend="italic">LM</hi>).</note> goes to Scotland to Walter<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Welsh, in Auchtertool.</note> on Wednesday My kind <pb id="pg-20-229" n="20:229"/>regards to your Husband and father&#x2014; I could not help smiling when I thought of your Father receiving his newspaper all in mourning for&#x2014;the Pope!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;The (Irish-Catholic) <hi rend="italic">Tablet</hi>, which came gratis to me (from Lucas, founder and editor, a great &#x2018;admirer,&#x2019; &#x26;c.), and was sent regularly till his [the Rev. Edward Dobbie&#x2019;s] death&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note in <hi rend="italic">LM</hi>). Bartolommeo Alberto Cappellari (<date when="1765-00-00">1765</date>&#x2013;<date when="1846-00-00">1846</date>), Pope Gregory XVI (<date when="1831-00-00">1831</date>&#x2013;<date when="1846-00-00">46</date>), died <date when="1846-06-01">1 June</date>.</note></p>

<p><name>Jane Carlyle</name><note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;After Alverstoke, <date when="1846-02-00">February 1846</date>, I had rallied to a second edition of Cromwell (first had been published in <date when="1845-10-00">October preceding</date>), enterprise in which, many new letters having come in, there lay a great deal of drudgery, requiring one&#x2019;s most exquisite talent as of shoe-cobbling, really, that kind of talent carried to a high pitch, with which I continued busy all summer and farther. She, in the meanwhile, had been persuaded into Lancashire again; not till late in <date when="1846-08-00">August</date> could I join her at Seaforth for a little while. Whence into Annandale for another silent six weeks, grown all to grey haze now, except that I did get rid of my horse &#x2018;Bobus&#x2019; there on fair terms, and had no want of mournful reflections (sad as death at times or sadder) on my own and the world&#x2019;s confusion and perversities, and the tragedies there bred for oneself and others.

<p><salute>Dearest,</salute> I hope the Seaforth Post-Office will exert itself, and endeavour to be punctual on this occasion for once! I send thee a poor little Card-case, a small memorial of Bastille-day,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Bastille prison was seized and sacked <date when="1789-07-14">14 July 1789</date>.</note> and of another day also very important to me and thee!

That <hi rend="italic">is</hi> a fact, if it can be of any use to thy poor soul to know it.

<p>I meant to write a longer Letter; but the moments are counted for me; <pb id="pg-20-230" n="20:230"/>and I am nearly roasted to death before starting.

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Yesterday I got the Doctor&#x2019;s Letter, which informed me you had got the new <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi>, and were going on pretty well in your usual way. I bid you thank him for the good tidings; which were very grateful to me here in my solitude, where sad and affectionate thoughts are chiefly my companions, and if I yielded to imagination I could take all manner of whims into my head.&#x2014; I will now, while the day is still before me, write you in few words some account of myself so far as I can yet chalk out my scheme of procedure for the coming weeks.</p>
<p>My business here is in great part finished; nothing but some poor tatters of it remaining, which I think I can overtake in a few days if I exert myself. But I am apt to be very lazy; to sit in the shadow of our back walls here, and looking up into the hot sky spend day after day in doing little but dream and remember;&#x2014;not entirely a useless way of spending a day either; but not to be indulged in beyond limits! I have read over and corrected all my Books for the American market; and fairly delivered the last of them to Putnam the New-York Bookseller&#x2019;s man in the end of the past week: so that is a thing <hi rend="italic">done</hi>. Some money may come of it; I know not whether much; indeed I do not greatly care: I am not now in want of money at all; I have got more money this year than I ever did in any year before, and find that I <pb id="pg-20-231" n="20:231"/>need not pester myself any farther on that head at present. I have had a good deal to do with poverty in my time; but <hi rend="italic">have</hi> learned this invaluable lesson from it and from victory over it: Never be <hi rend="italic">its</hi> slave, nor Wealth&#x2019;s slave either, but to try if I can keep myself <hi rend="italic">free</hi> between them! That will be the plan, if I can hit it.&#x2014; We went, before Jane&#x2019;s departure, as John would inform you, to get that Picture done for you at the Photograph Establishment; but after many trials nothing would come of it: so we gave it up; and Laurence the Painter (whom John knows) offering me the Oil Picture (known also to the Doctor) which he had painted of me some years ago,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>; see <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380711-JWC-JOST-01"><sic>10:118</sic><corr>JWC to JOST, <date when="1838-07-11">11 July 1838</date></corr></ref>, <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410321-TC-AC-01"><sic>13:60&#x2013;61</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1841-03-21">21 March 1841</date></corr></ref>, and 10:frontispiece, where wrongly dated.</note></p><p><figure><graphic url="volume-10-frontispiece.gif"/><p>Frontispiece, CL Volume 10</p><p><hi rend="italic">Oil portrait of Thomas Carlyle by Samuel Laurence, 1838.</hi></p><p><hi rend="italic">The original is privately owned; reproduced by kind permission of the owner.</hi></p></figure></p><p> I determined to send you that instead,&#x2014;really a Picture of very considerable worth, and far superior to any Photograph. That I have now got beside me; screwed fairly into its box, only wanting the lid nailed on: that shall come to my dear Mother, along with the <hi rend="italic">Original</hi> or perhaps sooner; we will have a proper frame made for it at Dumfries,&#x2014;and so it will hang up in some good place, and give your eyes a little satisfaction now and then. This too therefore is finished;&#x2014;as very many other things are. In fact I think of getting out of London, in one way or other, within a week to come, perhaps before this week end; and of being on the road towards you, <hi rend="italic">some</hi> road more or less direct.</p>
<p>One very troublesome item in my affairs is the Horse I have. I did not sell him, could not find a good merchant, as I told John: the Paulets were delighted at the prospect of my sending him up to them for my own riding there; but now again the poor Animal and<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> stands useless in the stable for a week past: they tell me he will not be fit for going in the railway to Liverpool before about friday or saturday,&#x2014;and certainly when <hi rend="italic">there</hi> he will be no great shakes at riding for some time. My own notion is that his ailment is the hot close stable and the hard food; and that he would get well as he used to be, very soon, on grass: but neither am I certain of this, or more than able to guess of it. The price of his carriage to Liverpool is &#xa3;2. 12. 6; they have grass there, but no work or use of their own for this Beast. I believe he could easily be got across to Scotsbrig after that: but the question is, Has James any kind of accommodation for him; would there be any fair likelihood of selling such an animal at the Road Fair or earlier? He can ride, he can run well too (but needs a goodish driver, being <hi rend="italic">thin-</hi> skinned, tho&#x2019; very goodnatured,&#x2014;nay perhaps he would go <hi rend="italic">altogether</hi> <foreign>doucely</foreign> on grass): but on the whole, I do not expect <hi rend="italic">very</hi> much benefit from riding or driving of him; so the question would lie somewhat with Jamie also, Can the beast be kept at Scotsbrig, can he be sold to any purpose there? I wish you would bid Jamie, the very night you get this, <pb id="pg-20-232" n="20:232"/>take serious counsel with himself and with the Doctor; and bid the latter write me the issue <hi rend="italic">straightway</hi>. It will throw <hi rend="italic">some</hi> light on<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Yale portion of the MS ends here.</note> the business. I must decide about Saturday:&#x2014;as on the whole I think the Doctor will have to write <hi rend="italic">immediately</hi>, if I am to get the answer in time. At bottom it is likeliest I may take the creature to Liverpool at any rate: he cannot be sold here except at a terrible disadvantage at present&#x2014;&#x2014; Jamie&#x2019;s word at any rate, his candid view of the matter, can do me no ill. I have decided to be quit of the Horse this winter, should I even take a pistol and shoot him: furthermore I think it is not likely I shall be in a hurry getting another!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Since I began writing, there has come a Letter from Jane: she does not seem to be at all strong; but I think is getting a little better too.</p>
<p>I will write again before I set off; in fact, very soon. I have various projects as to my <hi rend="italic">mode</hi> of travel northward; and do not like altogether to admit at once that it will be by the <hi rend="italic">common railway method</hi>,&#x2014;which, however, is probably the likeliest after all my pro-</p>

<p><salute>O my poor bewildered Goody,</salute> what misery is that, all for the want of a penny-stamp judiciously put upon a cover! I did think to write on Saturday;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1846-07-11">11 July</date>.</note> but I had spent such a time on Thomas Erskine and other trifles, and my plans for the walk were still so vague, I found there was no time left. Little time;&#x2014;and not the smallest word that was important to be said! I missed properly only two days; the third possible day I wrote. Do not, O do not fret thyself in that way about nothing at all.&#x2014; I will not &#x201C;burn&#x201D; this Letter either; I will keep it, and take good care of it, till better days come. In thy tragic sorrows and black confusions there is a noble element peering thro&#x2019;; a gleam of something divine and true, which is <hi rend="italic">worth</hi> following. By God&#x2019;s blessing we shall yet look back on all those miserable things, and find that a blessing beyond price did lie in them. As for the Redeemer,&#x2014;yes &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">the</hi> Redeemer liveth&#x201D;:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Job 19:25.</note> he is no Jew, or man, or image of a man or Jew or Surplice or old Creed: but the Unnameable Maker of us, voiceless, formless within our own soul,&#x2014;whose voice <hi rend="italic">is</hi> every noble and genuine impulse of our souls: <hi rend="italic">he</hi> is yet there in us and around us, and <hi rend="italic">we</hi> are there: no abbess, eremite, or fanatic whatever, had <hi rend="italic">more</hi> than we have; how much <pb id="pg-20-233" n="20:233"/>less had most of them! That is a fact. And the <hi rend="italic">use</hi> of these, the divine worth that lies in them as in all miseries, is that we should recognise that: think if it be not even so.&#x2014; But preaching is very bad. &#x201C;Physician, heal thyself&#x201D;:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Luke 4:23.</note> you may say so to me also; and I can only answer, God assist me to <hi rend="italic">try</hi> it honestly! There cannot any other do it, or much help in doing it.&#x2014; Come out, my Dearest, O come out into the light of day; and leave these brainwebs lying!&#x2014;</p>
<p>My &#x201C;rubbish&#x201D; yesterday consisted of Manchester Newspapers (insignificant paragraphs there) which I sent off to Dumfries: insignificant Chorley Letter about the <hi rend="italic">Miscellanies</hi>, which was thrown into the Basket; and confused burble of Free Kirk matters, pamphlets and Letters and Extracts, sent me by a certain Minister &#x201C;Jas Macaulay,&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Almost certainly the Rev. James Macaulay, minister of the Presbyterian Church, Edward St., Wardour St., Soho, author of <hi rend="italic">I am a Presbyterian, or, Reasons for Belonging to the Presbyterian Church in England</hi> (<date when="1846-00-00">1846</date>).</note> whom I could hardly fish out of my memory at all, but recollected at last to be an insignificant Scotch Parson introduced not long since by W<hi rend="italic">m</hi> Hamilton one morning. Him and his litter I, on examination, hurled down stairs to light fires, <hi rend="italic">without</hi> answer. And so, a little after nine, got out into the tepid moonshine; and walked about; called on poor Chorley, according to promise, who loyally joined me in my walk, and even furnished an indifferent cigar. That was my history last night: the best fruit of which was a moderately good sleep, worth really something to me; the best I have had for a good while. I took coffee about nine; have written a long Letter to my Mother since; and am not quite so depressed as usual by the Prince of the Power of the Air.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Satan; see Eph. 2:2.</note> The weather is again very hot; but there is a bea<supplied>[u]</supplied>tiful<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> brisk west-wind, nay occasionally a welcome veiling of clouds; and I have on my janes and cobwebs.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Twilled cotton (janes) and flimsy cloth (cobwebs).</note>&#x2014; I am very lonely; I find it not worst to be so. Innumerable sad but profitable thoughts take possession of me, which would not so easily get access otherwise. One night Helps called; sat a long time; made Helen get him chocolate, tried smoking, poor Helps; and was dreadfully cold, so that I had to fit him out with my old grey Tweed at his departure. He had come up for one day,&#x2014;a tremendous <hi rend="italic">secret</hi> this,&#x2014;to <hi rend="italic">refuse</hi> Lord Morpeth&#x2019;s proffer of a secretaryship; magnanimously he had just refused it, and was returning to Hampshire again to labour at his true vocation, that of improving society by Books.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George William Frederick Howard (<date when="1802-00-00">1802</date>&#x2013;<date when="1864-00-00">64</date>; <ref target="volume-20/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/13902"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>; see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400227-TC-JAC-01"><sic>12:58</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1840-02-27">27 Feb. 1840</date></corr></ref>), Lord Morpeth, 7th earl of Carlisle from <date when="1848-00-00">1848</date>. Helps had been Morpeth&#x2019;s private see. previously, in <date when="1839-00-00">1839</date>. He next published <hi rend="italic">Friends in Council</hi> (<date when="1847-00-00">1847</date>), dedicated to Lord Morpeth. He had come up from Vernon Hill, nr. Bishop&#x2019;s Waltham, Hampshire.</note> Do not whisper a word of this. Really there is <pb id="pg-20-234" n="20:234"/>something good and just in poor Helps; the sound of him, that night was more like that of a rational soul than any I had heard for some considerable time here.</p>
<p>My Horse is giving me some degree of trouble still! They have <hi rend="italic">blistered</hi> his throat, and the Leech says with me, Grass will be the cure for him; but he will not be fit to take the Railway till about Friday or Saturday! I really often wish to Heaven I <hi rend="italic">had</hi> no Horse;&#x2014;and do mean soon to attain that blessing. I have written today to inquire into Jamie&#x2019;s capabilities at Scotsbrig: I can leave the Horse here, and order them to shoot him, or to have him sold at Tattershall&#x2019;s by auction for &#xa3;20:<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Tattersall&#x2019;s, the Knightsbridge horse market.</note> really I am not in the least skilful to know what is wise in the matter; and very desirous to be delivered into a better field for the deploying of my intellectual faculty! The comfort is, one cannot be entirely destroyed, decide it how one will; and the memory of all this will dwell with me in future years when I take to longing for a horse again! Of course you can throw no light on the business for me: but I suppose you can ascertain or have already ascertained that when I leave Town or sooner I <hi rend="italic">may</hi> without impropriety send Bobus on to the care of Robert<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A Paulet servant.</note> and the Grassfield of Seaforth; &#x2014;or had I better not do that? Say plainly. You can also ask Paulet whether there is not somewhere a weekly auction of horses in Liverpool? At <hi rend="italic">which</hi>, I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> think, as readily as anywhere in London, one <hi rend="italic">could</hi> wash one&#x2019;s hands of Bobus if that seemed the fittest. Pray write of that.&#x2014; And for the present&#x2014;see there is the end of the paper! God bless thee Dearest; be good, be good. I have a serious speculation to be out of this place in the course of a week,&#x2014;, but how? For a pedestrian tour? By rail to Seaforth?&#x2014;or how, how?&#x2014; Would to Heaven I had no more of these beggarly arrangements to make; but had a place where I could <hi rend="italic">stay</hi> in! I really am not well at this work I!</p>

<p><salute>Oh my dear Husband</salute> Fortune has played me such a cruel trick this day!&#x2014;but it is all right now! and I do not even feel any resentment against fortune for the suffocating misery of the last two hours. I know always, even when I seem to you most exacting, that whatever happens to me is nothing like so bad as I deserve&#x2014; But you shall here all how it was&#x2014;</p>
<p>Yesterday in coming back from the Post office where I had gone myself with the letter to you, my head took to aching and ached ached on all day in a bearable sort of fashion till the evening when Geraldine came over from Manchester&#x2014;and the sudden bounce my heart gave at sight of her finished me off on the spot&#x2014; I had to get myself put to bed and made a bad wakeful night of it&#x2014;so that this morning I was nervous as you may figure&#x2014;and <pb id="pg-20-236" n="20:236"/>despairing of all things&#x2014;even of the letter from you that I expected so confidently yesterday.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Encourage</hi>ment came however from a quarter I was little dreaming of&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">before</hi> the post time&#x2014;before I was dressed in fact&#x2014;heaven knows how she had managed it&#x2014;there was delivered to me a packet from&#x2014;Bolte! at Cambridge!&#x2014;a pretty little collar and cuffs of the poor things own work with the kindest letter&#x2014;after all my cruelties to her!&#x2014; Well I thought if <hi rend="italic">she</hi> can be so loving and forgiving for me&#x2014;I need not be tormenting myself with the fear that <hi rend="italic">he</hi> will not write today either&#x2014; And I put on the <hi rend="italic">collar</hi> there and then, and went down to breakfast in a little better heart&#x2014; At ten&#x2014;the post hour I slipt away myself to the post office but was &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">detected</hi>&#x201D; by Betsy and Geraldine who insisted on putting on their bonnets and accompanying me&#x2014; I could well have dispensed with the attention&#x2014;however I trusted there would be a letter and their presence would only hinder me reading it for a little&#x2014; And <hi rend="italic">two</hi> were handed out which <hi rend="italic">I</hi> stretched <hi rend="italic">my</hi> hand to receive&#x2014;both for Betsy!&#x2014; <hi rend="italic">None</hi> for <hi rend="italic">me</hi> the postmistress averred!&#x2014;not a line from you on my Birthday&#x2014;on the fifth day! I did not burst out crying&#x2014; did not faint&#x2014;did not <hi rend="italic">do</hi> anything absurd so far as I know&#x2014;but I walked back again without speaking a word, and with such a tumult of wretchedness in my heart as you who know me can conceive&#x2014; And then I shut myself in my own room to fancy everything that was most tormenting&#x2014; Were you finally so out of patience with me that you had resolved to write to me no more at all?&#x2014;had you gone to Addiscombe and found no leisure <hi rend="italic">there</hi> to remember my existence?&#x2014; Were you taken ill so ill that you <hi rend="italic">could</hi> not write? that last idea made me mad to get off to the railway and back to London&#x2014; Oh mercy what a two hours I had of it!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Oh, my darling little woman!&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note in <hi rend="italic">LM</hi>).</note>&#x2014; And just when I was at my wits end, I heard Julia<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Paulet.</note> crying out thro&#x2019; the house&#x2014; M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle! Are you there? here is a letter for you!&#x201D; And so there was after all!&#x2014;the Postmistress had overlooked it&#x2014;and given it to Robert when he went afterwards not knowing that we had been. I wonder what <hi rend="italic">love-letter</hi> was ever received with such thankfulness!&#x2014; Oh my dear I am not fit for living in the World with this organisation&#x2014; I am as much broken to pieces by that little accident as if I had come thro an attack of Colera or Typhus fever&#x2014; I cannot even steady my hand to <hi rend="italic">write</hi> decently&#x2014; But I felt an irresistible need of thanking you by return of post&#x2014; Yes I have kissed the dear little cardcase&#x2014;and now I will like down a while and try to get some sleep&#x2014;at least to quieten myself will try to believe&#x2014;oh why can I not believe it once for all&#x2014;that with all my faults and follies I <hi rend="italic">am</hi> &#x201C;dearer to you <pb id="pg-20-237" n="20:237"/>than any earthly creature&#x201D;&#x2014; I will be better for Geraldine here she is very quite and nice become&#x2014;and as affectionate for me as ever</p>

<p><salute>My poor little Goody,</salute> you are still very unwell! Pray, for Heaven&#x2019;s sake, compose yourself: what is the matter whether I write to you or not? Does the whole past history of my life depend upon that wretched puddle of a Seaforth Postmistress? Whom may the gods&#x2014;amend! The unfortunate Blockhead, spilling all one&#x2019;s best contrivances; afflicting one&#x2019;s poor little Jeannie in that way!&#x2014; Tomorrow for example I will not write a word, nor next day,&#x2014; till I hear from you what is to become of Bobus a little!</p>
<p>My work here, unless it be that I am resting <hi rend="italic">here</hi>, is really as good as ended; <hi rend="italic">could</hi> end whenever I lustily bestirred myself in a space of four-and-twenty hours. But I grudge to pack myself into the rail-train like luggage again; if I had any real courage, I should take a stick and plunge forth into green England at large, as I am always engaging to myself to do!&#x2014; I have written to Miss Fergus, to indicate the possibility of <hi rend="italic">our</hi> being at Kirkcaldy; nothing was fixed; if she write to you, answer vaguely as you like.</p>
<p>Yesterday Darwin came, and then Anthony Sterling; detained me till half-past four: with difficulty I got away with Darwin at last, for a small drive, with walking back, as my bit of exercise before Helen&#x2019;s soup came.

<salute>Dear Fitzgerald,</salute>
<p>I am now about quitting London in a few days;&#x2014;very much in want of a specific route, having only two quite certain elements in my projects: <hi rend="italic">first</hi> that I ought as soon as possible to be among the green fields, wandering about for a while there; <hi rend="italic">second</hi>, that I must <hi rend="italic">end</hi> my wanderings, however they may circle in the interim, at a place called Seaforth House near Liverpool, where my Wife now is. She left me ten days ago, quite worn out with the hot confusions here; and that is to be our place of meeting. Six hours of rail <hi rend="italic">could</hi> carry me thither; but I feel as if I ought to take a little roaming in the interim,&#x2014;perhaps even a few days of <hi rend="italic">walking,</hi> with knapsack and umbrella! Is not that latter a bold idea? I assure you it comes into my head every year;&#x2014;but, alas, one&#x2019;s courage always fails.</p>
<p>The fact is, however, <hi rend="italic">if</hi> I could meet you at Naseby in about a week hence, I would now actually undertake that adventure, and finish <hi rend="italic">it</hi> for one thing. I might walk or ride thither by rail as I liked: I imagine we could spend two very pleasant days there, go and see Holmby House &#x26;c &#x26;c;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Holmby House, also known as Holdenby House, ca. 6 mi. N of Northampton, built <date when="1583-00-00">1583</date>, where Charles I was kept in custody for four mos., <date when="1647-00-00">1647</date>; see <hi rend="italic">Cromwell, Works</hi> 6:258.</note> and then depart refreshed for farther enterprises whatsoever these might be. What say you?</p>
<p><pb id="pg-20-239" n="20:239"/>Of course I hardly expect that you will say anything but at once &#x201C;No, not at all!&#x201D; However it seemed to me I would ask and ascertain. I want a little walking and adventuring, sinner that I am. If you have anything else of that kind in view, independently of Naseby, but merely tending somewhither towards the North, let me hear of it, let me examine it. If nothing, give me your blessing, and let me depart alone in peace. I understood you were due <hi rend="italic">here</hi> before now?</p>

By <date when="1846-10-19">19 Oct.</date> she was &#x201C;writing away at my book, and &#x2026; got two or three more chapters done&#x201D; (Ireland 217).</note> and in walking about the room&#x2014; It is best, under these rather exceptional circumstances, to &#x201C;do nothing today that can be put off till tomorrow&#x201D; (the Wedgwood Motto)&#x2014;but you seem to want a speedy answer about the horse&#x2014;so <hi rend="italic">that</hi> at least you shall have before I go to Liverpool <hi rend="italic">for a drive</hi>. From all I hear and see; horses sell quite as cheap or cheaper here than in London&#x2014; M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Paulet expects confidently to get a good carriage horse 17 hands high for from thirty to forty pounds!&#x2014;with respect to <hi rend="italic">grass</hi>&#x2014;the grounds here have been so much curtailed for building that, as I learnt incidently, the other day, they have not <hi rend="italic">grass</hi> enough for their own two cows without <hi rend="italic">buying it to spread on the field</hi>. When you find it suitable to send the horse I can answer for his being either well-fed <hi rend="italic">in the stable</hi> or sent on to Scotsbrig whichever you may wish&#x2014; If you were here yourself he would certainly be a great accommodation for <hi rend="italic">you</hi> to ride upon&#x2014;and no burden as in that case they would send away a <hi rend="italic">small</hi> carriage-horse they have <foreign><hi rend="italic">en attendant</hi></foreign> a larger one&#x2014;and as the carriage (the old one) the new has never been used at all!! is not taken out above once a week or so, Bobus might supply <hi rend="italic">its</hi> (the temporary horse!) place in drawing&#x2014; But unless he were here for <hi rend="italic">your</hi> use, I am afraid nobody else would be the better for him and he himself would hardly be the better for exchanging one stable for another, with this only difference that here he would get no exercise. I begin to think you had better have taken thirty pounds for him in London <hi rend="italic">if you could have gotten it</hi>&#x2014; I do not believe you will get more any where <pb id="pg-20-240" n="20:240"/>else; and his travelling expences will &#x201C;make that little less&#x201D; To be sure if you wish to have him anywhere to ride upon&#x2014;he were well worth the expence and trouble of his transport&#x2014; But as to <hi rend="italic">that</hi> you do not seem to have arrived at any conclusion yet. Jeanie writes me from Auchtertoul that the old minister is suddenly dead<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Rev. David Guild (<date when="1765-00-00">1765</date>&#x2013;<date when="1846-00-00">1846</date>) was minister at Auchtertool from <date when="1800-00-00">1800</date> till his death, <date when="1846-07-09">9 July</date>. Walter Welsh had been ordained his asst. and successor, <date when="1843-09-13">13 Sept. 1843</date>.</note>&#x2014; So Walter is now in possession of the appointments of his office as well as of the labours&#x2014; There is something rather shocking in one person&#x2019;s death being necessarily a piece of good fortune for another&#x2014;but it is all one to the old man himself <hi rend="italic">now</hi> whether they make sad faces at his departure or gay ones&#x2014;and who knows! perhaps Somebody loved that pig and will give him a genuine tear or two<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Sentimental cockney (mythical) that, trotting past, saw a clean&#x2014;washed pig with a ribbon round its neck, and exclaimed, &#x2018;Somebody,&#x2019; &#x26;c.&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note in <hi rend="italic">LM</hi>).</note>&#x2014; Poor mortals &#x201C;after all&#x201D;! What a mighty pother we make about our bits of lives, and Death so surely on the way to cut us out of <hi rend="italic">all that</hi> at least&#x2014;whatever may come after! Yes nobody out of Bedlam even <hi rend="italic">educated in Edin</hi>r can continue to doubt of <hi rend="italic">Death</hi> One may go a fair way in Scepticism&#x2014;may get to disbelieve in God and Devil, in <hi rend="italic">Virtue and in Vice,</hi> in Love, in one&#x2019;s own Soul, never to speak of <hi rend="italic">Time and Space Progress of the Species Rights of women&#x2014;Greatest Happiness of the greatest number&#x2014;isms</hi> world without end everything in short that the human mind ever believed in or &#x201C;believed that it believed&#x201D; in&#x2014;only <hi rend="italic">not</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Death!</hi> the most outrageous Sceptic&#x2014;even I after two nights without sleep cannot go ahead against <hi rend="italic">that</hi> fact&#x2014;a rather cheering one on the whole&#x2014;that let one&#x2019;s earthly difficulties be what they may, Death will make them all smooth sooner or later and either one shall have a trial at existing again under new conditions, or sleep soundly thro all eternity. That last used to be a horrible thought for me&#x2014;but is not so any longer&#x2014; I am weary weary to such a point of moral exhaustion that <hi rend="italic">any</hi> anchorage were welcome even the stillest coldest where the wicked should cease from troubling and the weary be at rest,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Job 3:17. JWC had evidently written to Mazzini again along the same lines, for in his reply to her, <date when="1846-07-15">15 July</date>, he said: &#x201C;Yes; &#x2018;sad as death, but not basely sad.&#x2019; That is what you must be, what I want you to be, and what a single moment of truly earnest thought and faith will cause you to be. Pain and joy, deception and fulfilled hopes are just, as I often said, the rain and the sunshine that must meet the traveller on his way. Bless the Almighty if He has thought proper to send the latter to you. Button or wrap your cloak around you against the first, but do not think a single moment that the one or the other have anything to do with the <hi rend="italic">end</hi> of the journey. You know that; but you want the <hi rend="italic">faith</hi> that would give you strength to fulfil the task shown by the intellect. These powers will give you that too, if you properly apply to them&#x2014; affection, a religious belief, and the dead. You have affection for me, as I have for you: you would not shake mine? &#x2026; You believe in God &#x2026; You had, have, though invisible to the eyes of the body, your mother, your father too. Can&#x2019;t you commune with them? I know that a single moment of true fervent love for them will do more for you than all my talking! &#x2026; Did we not often agree about these glimpses of the link between ours and the superior life? Shall we now begin to disagree? Be strong then. &#x2026; Get up and work; do not set yourself apart from us. When the Evil One wanted to tempt Jesus, he led him into a solitude.&#x201D;</note> understanding both by the <pb id="pg-20-241" n="20:241"/><hi rend="italic">wicked</hi> and the weary&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">myself</hi>&#x2014; But if I had been meaning to moralize I should have taken larger notepaper&#x2014; <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign> then.</salute></closer></p>

<p>Still very unwell, my poor Goody:&#x2014;but you will be <hi rend="italic">better</hi> in a day or two? It is very sad work; watching thro&#x2019; sleepless nights, in company with these haggard thoughts,&#x2014;alas, but what can we do in the interim?&#x2014; Death is indeed very indisputable; but <hi rend="italic">Life</hi> too, Life I should think is not less so, and that is our present concern. Compose thy poor soul; and <hi rend="italic">know well</hi> that to the wise no sorrow is in vain, no sorrow is not precious. God be with thee!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Bobus shall go, I think, on Saturday: I am to make final arra<supplied>[n]</supplied>gements<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> today; and if all be as I suppose, five o&#x2019;clock on Saturday afternoon will be the time when Robert will find poor Bobus, &#x201C;in a new position,&#x201D; at the Liverpool terminus. Grass or soft food is what the poor brute demands; grass and occasionally a little smear of lard upon the blister-wound;&#x2014;for the rest it seems his disease is gone, and he will be willing to do a little work for anybody. I will write tomorrow precise indications. Greathirst undertakes to supervise the business at Euston Square:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >I.e., loading the horse on the train at Euston Station.</note> all will be managed well, I doubt not. About tuesday or wednesday I think myself of starting: if Bobus <hi rend="italic">be</hi> in the way in the interim, he can go to Scotsbrig at once. I expect still to get some good of him.</p>

<p><salute>Dearest,&#x2014;</salute> Bobus being now all fairly settled, I write to announce that important fact. Greathirst, as you see by his sublime Letter, takes charge of seeing the Animal safe under way; I have been at Euston Square myself; the Nodes Groom too has just been here:&#x2014;and so now finally, Bobus I suppose at this moment is travelling along the streets towards Greathirst&#x2019;s stable; from which he will start tomorrow (Saturday) morning, to get into the Railway Box at <hi rend="italic">half past eight,</hi> with full intention to arrive in Liverpool at <hi rend="italic">five</hi>. He has all his accoutrements upon him, Horsecloth and roller, saddle and bridle, mud&#x2014;leathers (<foreign><hi rend="italic">gambadoes,</hi></foreign> so-called)<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Long protective boots attached to the saddle instead of stirrups.</note> included. There hangs a Ticket upon him, analogous to <hi rend="italic">this</hi> which I now inclose; Robert, on presenting this at five o&#x2019;clock on Saturday afternoon,&#x2014;will there get delivery of Bobus and all his equipments: and so one sorrow will be rolled off <hi rend="italic">me</hi> for a while!&#x2014; Eaves the groom says, Grass will be the life of Bobus; but he ought for a night or two to be brought in at sunset, and to have plenty of appropriate <hi rend="italic">liquor</hi> within reach of him. Devil give him good of it and so enough!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I am writing to Yankeeland today; full of correspondence. Last night I was at Creek&#x2019;s; after nearly killing poor Darwin at the Picture-room. The Portraits were interesting; and I never thought of poor Darwin&#x2019;s deadly <foreign>ennui</foreign> for two hours and more!&#x2014;</p>
<p><pb id="pg-20-243" n="20:243"/>The foreign Letter (of today) must be from Mrs Buller, I suppose: the other little Note, which came last night, looks terribly like a dinner-invitation from Miss Wilson!

The weather was sunny in the morning; but is now grey and breezy with slight showers: for me beautiful weather.</p>
<p>Wednesday or Tuesday I still vaguely aim at: but I must not fling myself into the Train like luggage (as the natural man wishes much to do); no, I feel as it were a real call of duty to make some <hi rend="italic">active</hi> debate for myself; to try if I cannot shake some of this frightful biliary humour out of me by some method! I will go and see Naseby if Fitzgerald consent to meet me there; but I do not think he will: today I <hi rend="italic">might</hi> have heard from him, but he yet says nothing.</p>

<salute>Dear Emerson,</salute>
<p>Since I wrote last to you,&#x2014;I think, with the Wiley-and-Putnam Covenant enclosed,&#x2014;the Photograph, after some days of loitering at the Liverpool Customhouse, came safe to hand.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-20/lt-18460530-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1846-05-30">30 May</date></ref>.</note> Many thanks to you for this punctuality: this poor Shadow, it is all you could do at present in that matter! But it must not rest there, no. This Image is altogether unsatisfactory, illusive, and even in some measure tragical to me! First of all, it is a bad Photograph; no <hi rend="italic">eyes</hi> discernible, at least one of the eyes not, except in rare favourable lights: then, alas, Time itself and Oblivion must have been busy. I could not at first, nor can I yet with perfect decisiveness, bring out any feature completely recalling to me the old Emerson, that lighted on us from the Blue, at Craigenputtoch, long ago,&#x2014;<foreign>eheu!</foreign> Here is a genial, smiling energetic face, full of sunny strength, intelligence, integrity, good humour; but it lies imprisoned in baleful shades, as of the valley of Death; seems smiling on me as if in mockery, &#x201C;Dost know me, friend? I am dead, thou seest, and distant, and forever hidden from thee;&#x2014;I belong already to <pb id="pg-20-244" n="20:244"/>the Eternities, and thou recognisest me not!&#x201D; On the whole, it is the strangest feeling I have:&#x2014;and practically the thing will be that you get us by the earliest opportunity some <hi rend="italic">living</hi> pictorial sketch, chalk-drawing or the like, from a trustworthy hand; and send <hi rend="italic">it</hi> hither to represent you. Out of the two I shall compile for myself a likeness by degrees: but as for this present, we cannot put up with it at all; to my Wife and me, and to sundry other parties far and near that have interest in it, there is no satisfaction in this. So there will be nothing for you but compliance, by the first fair chance you have: furthermore I bargain that the <hi rend="italic">Lady</hi> Emerson have, within reasonable limits, a royal veto in the business (not absolute, if that threaten extinction to the enterprise, but absolute within the limits of possibility): and that she take our case in hand, and graciously consider what can and shall be done. That will answer, I think</p>
<p>Of late weeks I have been either idle, or sunk in the sorrowfullest cobbling of old shoes again; sorrowfully reading over old Books for the Putnams and Chapmans, namely. It is really painful, looking in one&#x2019;s own old face; said &#x201C;old face&#x201D; no longer a thing extant now!&#x2014; Happily I have at last finished it; the whole lumber-troop with clothes duly brushed (<hi rend="italic">F. Revolution</hi> has even got an Index too) travels to New York in the Steamer that brings you this. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Quod faustum sit</hi></foreign> [Let the outcome be lucky]:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18151211-TC-RM-01"><sic>1:67</sic><corr>TC to RM, <date when="1815-12-11">11 Dec. 1815</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014;or indeed I do not much care whether it be <foreign><hi rend="italic">faustum</hi></foreign> [lucky] or not; I grow to care about an astonishingly small number of things as times turn with me! Man, all men seem radically <hi rend="italic">dumb;</hi> jabbering mere jargons, and noises from the teeth outwards; the inner meaning of them,&#x2014;of them and of me, poor devils,&#x2014;remaining shut, buried forever. If almost all Books were burnt (my own laid next the coal), I sometimes in my spleen feel as if it really would be better with us! Certainly could one generation of men be forced to live without rhetoric, babblement, hearsay, in short with the tongue well cut out of them altogether,&#x2014;their fortunate successors would find a most improved world to start upon! For Cant does lie piled on us, high as the zenith; an Augean Stable with the poisonous Confusion piled <hi rend="italic">so</hi> high:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >One of the labors of Hercules was to cleanse the stables of King Augeas, which housed 3,000 oxen, for the first time in thirty years.</note> which, simply if there once <hi rend="italic">could</hi> be nothing <hi rend="italic">said</hi>, would mostly dwindle like summer snow gradually about its business and leave us free to use our eyes again! When I see painful Professors of Greek, poring in their sumptuous Oxfords over dead <hi rend="italic">Greek</hi> for a thousand years or more, and leaving live <hi rend="italic">English</hi> all the while to develop itself under charge of Pickwicks and Sam Wellers,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >As in Dickens&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">The Pickwick Papers</hi> (<date when="1836-00-00">1836</date>&#x2013;<date when="1837-00-00">37</date>).</note> as if <hi rend="italic">it</hi> were nothing and the other were all things: this, and the like of it everywhere, fills me with reflexions! Good Heavens, <pb id="pg-20-245" n="20:245"/>will the people not come out of their wretched Old-Clothes Monmouth-streets, Hebrew and other; but lie there dying of the basest pestilence,&#x2014; dying and as good as dead! On the whole, I am very weary of most &#x201C;Literature&#x201D;:&#x2014;and indeed in very sorrowful abstruse humour otherwise at present.</p>
<p>For remedy to which I am, in these very hours, preparing for a sally into the green Country, and deep silence; I know not altogether how or whitherward as yet; only that I must tend towards Lancashire, towards Scotland at last. My Wife already waits me in Lancashire; went off, in rather poor case, much burnt by the hot Town, some ten days ago, and does not yet report much improvement. I will write to you somewhere in my wanderings. The Address &#x201C;Scotsbrig, Ecclefechan N. B.,&#x201D; if you chance to write directly or soon after this arrives, will, likely, be the shortest: at any rate, that, or &#x201C;Cheyne Row&#x201D; either, is always sure enough to find me in a day or two after trying.</p>
<p>By a kind of accident I have fallen considerably into American History in these days; and am even looking out for Am<hi rend="italic">n</hi> Geography to help me. Jared Sparks, Marshall &#x26;c are hickory and buckskin; but I do catch a credible trait of human life from them here and there; Michelet&#x2019;s genial champagne <hi rend="italic">froth,</hi>&#x2014;alas, I could find no fact in it that would stand handling; and so have broken down in the middle of <hi rend="italic">La France</hi>, and run over to hickory and Jared for shelter!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jared Sparks (<date when="1789-00-00">1789</date>&#x2013;<date when="1866-00-00">1866</date>), American historian, author of numerous historical and biographical works (including a life of Washington) dealing with American subjects.

<salute>Dear Jean,</salute>
<p>Here is a Canadian Letter, with news from Alick and his household, which I am to forward to you directly. All still intrinsically goes well with <pb id="pg-20-246" n="20:246"/>him in that quarter. Jack accompanies the Letter, with a very brief message to me that at Scotsbrig also all is in the usual state. There was a brief Note from Jenny too which had just arrived there, which farther assures me that at Dumfries there is nothing wrong. I had your Letter a while ago; for which I was greatly obliged to you: I meant to have answered sooner; but I have been, and still am, a good deal tumbled about by one thing and another; and have had much otherwise to write and arrange.</p>
<p>Just a fortnight ago Jane went off to Lancashire; in a rather weakly way, much worn down by the hot confusions of this place: she is with the Paulets ever since, and very quiet by the seashore; which, I hope, will by and by tell upon her; but as yet she does not report much improvement.&#x2014; I myself am busy getting anchor lifted; decided to quit this scene of noise in about three days hence; but not yet very completely certain as to what mode of travel I shall adopt, or where my stages are to be. I feel a kind of call to get into green places for a few days, if possible into deep solitude and silence! I even think of getting a knapsack and stick, and setting out for a few days of <hi rend="italic">walking;</hi> I have a terrible reluctance to any <hi rend="italic">active</hi> adventure whatever; but this perhaps really would compose me a little,&#x2014;perhaps I <hi rend="italic">ought</hi> to do it! In any case, I must land at Seaforth House Liverpool some way or other not many days hence; over from which to Annandale &#x26; Nithsdale my course is not likely to be long delayed. The probablest way, after all, is that I shall stow myself like luggage, in the old fashion, into the Liverpool railway, and so be bowled along: that is the shortest plan, but it has grown very disgusting to me.&#x2014; If you will send a Letter addressed &#x201C;Mrs Paulet&#x2019;s, Seaforth House Liverpool,&#x201D; in a week hence, I shall be very glad to see it. About Wednesday or Thursday I think I shall leave this, by one mode or another.</p>
<p>Today I sent off my Horse; he is now rolling along rapidly in a Railway Box for Liverpool! I think he will come over to Dumfriesshire at last; and end in the Rood Fair! I tried to sell him here; but there was no demand, no price attainable better than a country one. So I thought we might have a little more use of the Galloper (who can run well in harness too, and is a very respectable horse),&#x2014;for Jane too has some thoughts of coming into Scotland, to visit East Lothian &#x26;c. The animal has been unwell in this hot weather and hard food, and is specially recommended to get abroad into grass.&#x2014; When you write next, will you make James tell you what he gave for his Gig,&#x2014;what the price of a reasonable stout well-going Gig in Dumfries may be: I believe the Horse (Bobus, we call him) might draw us along in such a vehicle;&#x2014;and with the Dumfries prices we could compare those of Liverpool.</p>
<p>One of the items of luggage I am bringing with me is an oil Picture of <pb id="pg-20-247" n="20:247"/>myself for my Mother!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-20/lt-18460714-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1846-07-14">14 July</date></ref>.</note> It was drawn some years ago by Lawrence, and is really rather good,&#x2014;infinitely better than common. It will need to be framed at Dumfries; and, I think, may be as well sent over to you from Liverpool <hi rend="italic">direct</hi>.</p>
<p>From Pauletdom, when I get thither, I will write again,&#x2014;I hope in more composure than today! <closer><salute>Kind love to all. <foreign>Adieu</foreign> O dear Sister.&#x2014; Your affectionate</salute></closer> <name>T. C.</name></p>

<p>No news from you today yet, poor Goody; which, I fear, is a sign there was not much of improvement to announce. However, I will hope for a better account on Monday morning. I think I have written every day this week, more or less?</p>
<p>Bobus, I have no doubt, went off this morning at half-past eight; a very wet morning for him; but from Greathirst&#x2019;s stable the distance was not far, and G<hi rend="italic">t</hi> to a certainty would take all manner of precautions. If Robert succeed in getting him tonight, home to you, about six o&#x2019;clock, safe, it will be one ugly burble <hi rend="italic">fewer</hi> in one&#x2019;s affairs. Enough remain, Heaven knows! I am this day paying off Bobus&#x2019;s last bills here;&#x2014;and find, as once I did in a former case, that if I had ordered Brown<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >W. K. Browne.</note> to <hi rend="italic">shoot</hi> him for me at Bedford last autumn, it would have been a real advantage! However we will now go thro&#x2019; with it handsomely to the end;&#x2014;and we shall know another time! By Jack&#x2019;s Letter you will see what outlooks there are in Annandale; grass at least to be had: if you find Bobus, or at all <hi rend="italic">suspect</hi> him, to be in the way at Seaforth, I need not bid you scrupulously respect the hospitalities and the delicacies,&#x2014;and <hi rend="italic">instantly</hi> despatch him by the Steamer to Scotsbrig. Pray <hi rend="italic">attend</hi> to this for me. You have only to find out the day of the Annan Steamer, either of them, and write in time to Jamie. Send the Animal and all his trappings, if you find that the course,&#x2014;swiftly. On the other hand I have written to Jean at Dumfries about the price of Gigs there: so we have hold of the affair by <hi rend="italic">both</hi> handles, and will not spill it between us.</p>
<p>My route remains still unfixed. Fitzgerald, as you see, will not go with me to Naseby; nor have I any notion to go voyaging into Suffolk to him. I will go somewhither in a few days,&#x2014;that only is fixed! My disgust at the necessity of <hi rend="italic">going</hi> at all, of not being in a place where one can <hi rend="italic">stay</hi> and be at <pb id="pg-20-248" n="20:248"/>rest, and follow one&#x2019;s affairs all the year round,&#x2014;is, as it has often been to small purpose, again considerable.</p>
<p>I was at the Barings&#x2019; last night; saw Buller &#x26;c. I do not go to Addiscombe today nor tomorrow, nor indeed for an indefinite perhaps infinite time to come! To the Lady I have of course told nothing, except that you are very unwell; but she seems to have discerned pretty clearly for herself that our intercourse is to be carried on under different conditions henceforth, or probably to cease altogether before long; to which arrangement she gives signs of being ready to conform with fully more indifference than I expected,&#x2014;with no unkindness at all, but with no discernible regret either; on the whole with the most perfect politeness, and graceful conformity to destiny, such as beseems all people.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Froude, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi> 3:387, speaks ambiguously about this letter, as if TC refers only to their holiday arrangements. Yet TC also evidently means that he is ready to consider that their friendship with the Barings be in future &#x201C;under different conditions.&#x201D;</note> Such as I too am ready for, if it come to that;&#x2014;that perversity of fate too I can adopt and accept, as I have had to do a few in my time.&#x2014; An opening is left for my meeting them about Carlisle or Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> on their Scotch Tour; but it seems to be with little expectation on either side that it will take effect. We shall endeavour to see what the real monition of the matter is when the time arrives.&#x2014; &#x2014; Buller is already getting official in his sentiments,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >As judge-advocate gen.; see <ref target="volume-20/lt-18460707-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1846-07-07">7 July</date></ref>.</note> or one thinks so! He has &#xa3;2,000 a-year while the game lasts; which will be a useful thing to <hi rend="italic">him</hi> at any rate.</p>
<p><closer><salute>I am over head and ears in beggarly confused business: dear Jeannie, <foreign>adieu</foreign>. I beg and entreat thee to be quiet, to be clear and wise! So thou shalt yet be, by God&#x2019;s blessing. So shall we all be!&#x2014; Have you a thought to go and see Cousin Walter in his new manse? Kind regards to &#x201C;Betsy&#x201D; and Geraldine, and to all. Yours ever</salute></closer></p>

<ps><p>Alick&#x2019;s Letter is forward<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> to Dumfries; there was nothing special in it,&#x2014;the old details and fundamentally all well.</p></ps>

<p>The Fate of Bobus?&#x2014;I sincerely wish he may be safe at Seaforth! but I do not <hi rend="italic">know</hi> that he is &#x201C;the least in the world&#x201D;! Only as I left injunction that an <pb id="pg-20-249" n="20:249"/><hi rend="italic">express</hi> should be sent after me, in the case of his having arrived dead or <hi rend="italic">mad</hi>, or not arrived at all and no express has yet come, I may reasonably hope that all has gone well with the poor brute, and that along with this letter you will receive one from Charles (the only member of the family besides Pup<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >There were two Paulet sons: Charles and Frank, now aged about sixteen and nine, according to the <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date> census records.</note> who has remained at home) to give you positive news of your <hi rend="italic">worser half</hi> (I mean the fourfoot half)&#x2014;Charles promised that he would write to you, and foolish as he looks I have never found him neglect anything he undertook to do. Had I been told in time I should certainly have remained at Seaforth to welcome the creature&#x2014;but when I got your note of Friday morning I was already engaged to dine here on Saturday and stay till Monday. The rest had accepted M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Brereton&#x2019;s<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Joseph Brereton, otherwise unidentified, but the tenant of the Hall owned by Richard Watt (d. <date when="1865-00-00">1865</date>).</note> invitation on the understanding that I would accompany them, and chiefly indeed on <hi rend="italic">my</hi> account; thinking it might amuse me perhaps to pass two nights in a haunted house: Had I afterwards drawn back for the horse&#x2019;s sake I should have occasioned an amount of disappointment and perplexity which I did not feel <hi rend="italic">up</hi> to fronting. So after a good deal of silent cogitation, I decided with <hi rend="italic">a certain</hi> trust in Providence on fulfilling my engagement!</p>
<p>But who <hi rend="italic">is</hi> M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Brereton? &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">God knows&#x201D;</hi>! I never saw him with my Eyes till he received me yesterday on the threshold of his own drawing-room&#x2014; He seems a harmless man enough&#x2014;polite, hospitable, and &#x201C;not without&#x201D; a sort of slow sense. And certainly he lives in the most interesting house that I ever fell in with out of the Romances of M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Radcliffe<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ann Ward Radcliffe (<date when="1764-00-00">1764</date>&#x2013;<date when="1823-00-00">1823</date>), author of gothic romances, <hi rend="italic">The Mysteries of Udolpho</hi> (<date when="1794-00-00">1794</date>) being the best known.</note>&#x2014;so dead-old, so rickety and crumbly and <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;Elizabethian&#x201D;</hi> in every feature; that it would scarcely surprise me when a door opens if the Maiden Queen and all her court should walk in in their winding-Sheets and seat themselves on the high backed chairs to have &#x201C;a little comfortable talk&#x201D; with me about the other world. There are screech-owls behind the Tapestry in some of the bedrooms, who <hi rend="italic">breath</hi> and <hi rend="italic">moan</hi> all night long in a way to freeze your blood! And once when a Liverpool Dandy was sitting alone in the old drawingroom the plaster of the ceiling began to shower down on him, and then the whole ceiling <hi rend="italic">beams</hi> and all discended slowly slowly <hi rend="italic">not</hi> killing him for he had time to save himself but nearly frightening him to death. The bed-room in which I have passed one night, without any supernatural adventure I am sorry to say, is all tapestried over with gigantic figures in a <hi rend="italic">tremendous</hi> state of excitement&#x2014;about <hi rend="italic">what</hi> I have not yet made out; but <hi rend="italic">shall</hi> perhaps before I have done with them. I was sure there must be a <pb id="pg-20-250" n="20:250"/>secret door behind this tapestry, and after I had gone to my room for the night I began to tap and feel all about, like the Heroine of the <hi rend="italic">mysteries of Udolpho</hi> and Oh joy! I actually found one!&#x2014;and discovered the trick of the spring after half an hour puzzling&#x2014;and stept in expecting to find myself in a spiral staircase&#x2014;but I only found myself in a closet <hi rend="italic">newly shelved</hi>&#x2014;where no object was discoverable except&#x2014;my own bonnet!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >There is a secret passage entered from a small panel in &#x201C;the Green bedroom,&#x201D; which rises to a priest&#x2019;s hole or way of escape via the roof.

<p><salute>Thanks, dear Goody,</salute> for your cheerful Letter which is a great relief to me; the one cheerful item of my history this morning. You must thank Charles Paulet also for his punctual announcement and other care about that unfortunate Horse,&#x2014;concerning which, it seems, we are by no means yet out of our adoes!</p>
<p>Unfortunate Bobus, he seems to have been foaled for my especial misery in these last two years! I am tempted to say, For God&#x2019;s sake, shoot him; fling his carcase into the Mersey, and let me never hear more of him in this world or the next! But that will not at all do either: we must finish the adventure in some handsomer way than that. Listen therefore.</p>
<p>I have never seen the Brute since Tuesday or Monday Ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi> last when I rode him: next morning the Ostler, on his report, got orders to do &#x201C;whatever was reasonable for making the creature ready to be sent away as soon as possible to grass&#x201D;; Greathirst saw him, thought there was little wrong; on Friday Bobus was reported ready to go,&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">had</hi> been blistered, it appeared tho&#x2019; contrary to what Greathirst had tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> would be necessary: however, here now he was, fit to go to grass at last: on Saturday, much to my amazement, I received a Horse-leech&#x2019;s bill; by which it appeared at least that &#x201C;medical treatment&#x201D; had not been spared till the cure was <pb id="pg-20-252" n="20:252"/>brought about! This too I paid, with entirely silent but very deep disgust: I now send it to you, with a small Note of Greathirst&#x2019;s by way of last word to me,&#x2014;as all the &#x201C;medical&#x201D; or other light I have got about the unfortunate quadruped,&#x2014;whom I do in my heart wish dead, if he would only die soon. But the question is not that; the question is, What is now to be done?</p>
<p>If the Brute were now able to travel at all, I should say, Put him into the very first Annan Steamer, and let Jamie take charge of him. Failing that, my strict advice is To call in no new &#x201C;medical treatment&#x201D;; but to bid Robert, or any other rational groom, give the creature what purgative medicine (the most Common is as good as the best) he sees him by the indubitablest evidence <hi rend="italic">want;</hi> and for the rest to turn him out into a grass field, and there let him live or die which ever he (Bobus) finds handiest! That really is the summary of all I have to advise: my wishes in the matter may be said to limit themselves to one point, That the catastrophe would arrive <hi rend="italic">soon</hi>. And so enough of him, the monster!</p>
<p>I am totally broken down today; <hi rend="italic">physic</hi> in me, &#x26;c; have not the strength of the ninth part of a taylor,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Proverbial.</note> either in body or mind; and therefore must restrict myself rigorously to <hi rend="italic">doing nothing</hi>, and saying <hi rend="italic">almost</hi> nothing. <closer><salute>God bless thee, dear Jeannie.</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>Dear Goody mine,</salute> I am in violent hurry, <hi rend="italic">packing, actually</hi> packing,&#x2014;and here has Creek been who has stolen away an hour-and-half of my time. I am coming tomorrow (Thursday, the day you read this) by the mail-train: that is the essential; recover that!&#x2014; I meditated as a <hi rend="italic">duty</hi> that I ought actually to go and <hi rend="italic">walk</hi> for a few days somewhere or other&#x2014;the Chiltern Hills <pb id="pg-20-254" n="20:254"/>(which is Hampden&#x2019;s Country,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Hampden.</note> in Buckinghamshire), Oxford, Naseby,&#x2014;all these were earnestly in my poor heart: but on awakening on Monday morning so totally broken down, I did avow to myself, &#x201C;Thou art too great a coward; thou <hi rend="italic">canst</hi> not go!&#x201D;&#x2014;and so set myself to prepare for other arrangements. Nay Oxford (as Jacobson writes to me) and Naseby (as Fitzg<hi rend="italic">d</hi> wrote) are out at any rate: and for walking the Chiltern hills; once for all, I cannot just now. In fact I am low enough, body and soul; in fact I can&#x2019;t and won&#x2019;t! So I go tomorrow, like luggage as I am; and you will get me at 5 o&#x2019;clock; and, I hope, make much of me!&#x2014; Thanks for your care of Bobus, thank everybody; and send him off instantly to Jamie; I will write thither too tonight. For the rest I contemplate a run to <hi rend="italic">Dublin</hi> still, with a return by the Steamer from <hi rend="italic">Belfast to Annan;</hi> that will be a little scrap of an Irish tour, as much as I am up to: I write to Duffy about that tonight, and really think I <hi rend="italic">should</hi> try to execute that.</p>
<p>I took leave of the Barings last night: all is handsome and clear there; and nothing is wrong, except <hi rend="italic">your</hi> and my ill-genius may still force it to be so a little! To the Lady I &#x201C;said&#x201D; simply nothing; and her altered manner, I suppose, might proceed altogether from the evident chagrin and depression of mine. Was that unnatural in me? In fact, I myself was heartily weary of a relation grown so sad; and in my mind almost repented that it had ever been. But you may take it as a certainty if you like, that there is nothing of unkindness or injustice harboured to you there: and if you chose to write a little word of news to Lady Harriet, as to how you are, and what things you are amidst, I do believe it would be a real and very welcome kindness to her. Her intents towards you and towards me, so far as I can read them, <hi rend="italic">are</hi> charitable and <hi rend="italic">not</hi> wicked: my relation to her is by a very <hi rend="italic">small</hi> element of her position, but by a very just and laudable one; and I wish to retain that if I can, and give it up if I cannot, <foreign>voil&#xE0; tout</foreign>. <closer><salute>O Goody dear, be wise and all is well.</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Jamie,</salute>
<p>I am just about done with my packing; setting off for Liverpool tomorrow morning. I expect to be there at 5 o&#x2019;clock tomorrow (Thursday) evening, if all go well. Jane as you know is already there; I think I gather by her <pb id="pg-20-255" n="20:255"/>Letters that she is a little better of late days. But it appears you are to hear from herself, in reference to that unfortunate Horse of mine; and indeed it is on that subject chiefly that I must write to you at present.</p>
<p>I got Jack&#x2019;s Letter with your advices: the Horse was already gone that morning to Liverpool. He has had a cold in him, either visible or in his bones, ever since that blaze of hot weather and east wind in the early part of summer; and for a good many weeks here, it is chiefly expense and <foreign><hi rend="italic">fash</hi></foreign> that I have had with him: one good ride about a fortnight ago is the last I had: he was declared to have sore-throat next day; and I ordered them to get him immediately ready for being turned out to grass. He is at Liverpool accordingly; and, it appears, is still quite useless for work, with a raw (blistered) throat, and there is no free <foreign><hi rend="italic">outrake</hi></foreign> [open space] for him at Liverpool either; so he must go to Scotsbrig to you. Of course you will take what care of him you can; get him into plenty of grass,&#x2014;that, I believe, is the real remedy: for the creature has all along been extremely healthy; and I impute his sickness just now to nothing but the fierce heat, the hard food, and dirty close stables they have here.&#x2014; If you have green meat yourself, it will be best; if not you must get him turned into Kirkconnel Parks<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably Kirkconnel Hall, &#xBC; mi. N of Ecclefechan, ca. 1&#xBD; mi. SW of Scotsbrig.</note> or somewhere: I need not say that whatever cost the keep of him may amount to shall be at <hi rend="italic">my</hi> charge so soon as I see you. There is no knee-mark, or any kind of injury about the animal: indeed I think a little grass will set him fairly on his feet again. If you think he can eat any oats, get oats for him: I am not without hope he will be somewhat roadworthy when I come into Annandale, and we may get a little riding and gigging out of him,&#x2014;the scoundrel! In short, dear Brother, you must just do the wisest you can with that poor animal; as if you, with your experience in that matter, were <hi rend="italic">myself</hi> acting on the spot there. And so enough of <hi rend="italic">him:</hi> Jane and you can settle the rest.</p>
<p>I will write to some of you after getting to Liverpool,&#x2014;very soon; Saturday or so. I think of making a small cut across to Dublin and coming home by the <hi rend="italic">Belfast</hi> Steamer; but that is still only a theory, tho&#x2019; in fact I have considerable need of some stirring up, and ought to go somewhere or other. I meant to have a little solitary <hi rend="italic">walking</hi> among the Beach Hills in this southern part of England, before I came finally North; but I find I have not heart for that at present.&#x2014; Ireland too is rather a task with me than anything else: but I believe I shall try to do it. About the beginning of <date when="1846-08-00">August</date> I expect to see you all again: of course I will send you regular word before that, as the course of motion or of <hi rend="italic">rest,</hi> goes on.</p>
<p>My <hi rend="italic">first</hi> work at Liverpool is to get a <hi rend="italic">Box</hi> ready for Alick in Canada. Paulet says he can send it safe; I promised it to Alick long ago. What to send <pb id="pg-20-256" n="20:256"/>I do not well know: a good <hi rend="italic">gun</hi> is likely to be the main thing; some <hi rend="italic">books</hi> (very few only have I fit, or can I get carried with me home), some warm <hi rend="italic">clothes</hi>,&#x2014;in fact I know not well what to send. If any of you want to contribute, any smaller or larger thing, Jack knows the Paulet Address, and it can come by the Steamer, still in very good time.</p>
<p>Nothing more occurs to me as <hi rend="italic">indispensable</hi> tonight; and being, as you may fancy, in a very great bustle, I will not go beyond that. Tell the Doctor to write; the sooner the better. I will write to my Mother or him from Seaforth. My Mother I hope is still well&#x2014;good Mother! Isabella they report to be considerably better than on my last visit. We shall see soon. <closer><salute>Good night to you all.</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I am just about escaping out of London, for a little movement and free summer air, of which I have rather need at present for more reasons than one: tomorrow afternoon I expect to be in Lancashire with some friends, where my Wife now is; the sea-breezes and the instantaneous total change of scene will be good so far as they go. My next goal, for another rest of longer or shorter continuance, must be my native place, Dumfriesshire on the other side of the Solway Frith, where I must aim to be about the first week of <date when="1846-08-00">August</date>.</p>
<p>One of my intermediate projects was a short flight over to Ireland; upon which I wish to consult you at present. A swift Steamer, I know, takes one over any evening (or I believe, morning) with the Mail bags: there is Dublin to be looked at for a day or two, there is &#x201C;Conciliation Hall&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Headquarters of the Repeal Association, built in <date when="1843-00-00">1843</date>.</note> to be seen, <hi rend="italic">once;</hi> there <hi rend="italic">you</hi> are to be seen, and talked with, oftener than once if you like:&#x2014;many other things no doubt; but this is nearly all of definite that rises on me at present, and this, if other things go right, will abundantly suffice. In Dublin, and all places, I get nothing but pain out of noise and display; and insist, even at the expense of some breaches of politeness, on remaining altogether private; strictly <foreign><hi rend="italic">incognito,</hi></foreign>&#x2014;if there is any need of putting an &#x201C;IN&#x201D; to it, which sometimes (for poor mortals are very prurient, and run after Pickwicks and all manner of rubbish) I have found there was.&#x2014; From Dublin I could get along, by such route as seemed pleasantest, to Belfast; and then on the proper day a Steamer puts me down at <pb id="pg-20-257" n="20:257"/>Annan, on the Scotch Border,&#x2014;my old School-place; within six miles of the smoke of my Mother&#x2019;s cottage; very well known to me, all dead and a few living things, when once I am at Annan!&#x2014;</p>
<p>This is the extent of my project; which may or may not become an action,&#x2014;though I do hope and wish in the affirmative at present. What part of it chiefly depends on you is, to say whether or not <hi rend="italic">you</hi> are in Dublin; how a sight of Conciliation Hall (I want nothing more but a <hi rend="italic">sight</hi> with somebody to give me the names) in full work is to be obtained; and what else, if anything, you could recommend to the notice of a very abstruse and lonesome stranger taking a two-days glimpse of such a place. Do this for me if you please, so soon as you find an hour of leisure: my address is &#x201C;Mrs Paulet&#x2019;s, Seaforth House, Liverpool,&#x201D;&#x2014;whither also if you could make your people send the <hi rend="italic">Nation</hi> till new notice, it would save a little time and trouble to certain parties. But that latter point is, of course, not important.</p>
<p>Mr O&#x2019;Connell, I am not much concerned to find, is somewhat palpably deserting &#x201C;Repeal&#x201D;;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Once Lord John Russell replaced Peel as prime minister, O&#x2019;Connell aroused the antagonism of the Young Ireland group by allying himself with the new whig administration. Both O&#x2019;Connell and Young Ireland courted the support of the leading nationalist figure William Smith O&#x2019;Brien (<date when="1803-00-00">1803</date>&#x2013;<date when="1864-00-00">64</date>; <ref target="volume-20/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/20471"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), while their differences sharpened. These focused on the issue of the permissibility of physical force. On <date when="1846-07-13">13 July</date> O&#x2019;Connell carried a meeting of the Assoc. with him in support of nothing but moral force (<hi rend="italic">Nation</hi> <date when="1846-07-15">15 July</date>), and this was to lead to debate, <date when="1846-07-27">27&#x2013;28 July</date>, and the withdrawal of Young Ireland in company with O&#x2019;Brien.</note> and getting into a <hi rend="italic">truer</hi> relation, I suppose, towards the earnest men of Ireland, who do mean what they talk. I cannot say any man&#x2019;s word that I hear from your side of the water gives me anything like an unmixed satisfaction, except for most part your own: there is a candid clear manfulness, simplicity and truth in the things you write for your people (at least I impute them to you), which seems to me the grain of blessed unnoticed wheat among those whirlwinds of noisy chaff,&#x2014;which afflict me as they pass on their way to Chaos, <hi rend="italic">their</hi> fated inevitable way; but the wheat, I say to myself, will grow! So be it.&#x2014;&#x2014; <closer><salute>Expecting a word from you soon / Yours always truly</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Jamie,</salute>
<p>I find here, all of a sudden, that the Post is just going; so I fling down my <hi rend="italic">gooseberries</hi> (eating of which is the thing I have been engaged in), and <pb id="pg-20-258" n="20:258"/>write you the word to announce that I am safe, that all is well enough here. I arrived a little behind my time last night (my Letter to you would be in the same train with me, which was a very <hi rend="italic">long</hi> train too); and after some small looking found the Paulet carriage in waiting for me, and so got very comfortably along thro&#x2019; the grey windy Evening. Jane is certainly better than when she left me; but she has still a disagreeable kind of cough, and is not otherwise quite up to the mark. But the air here is cool and gentle, the sea near too, and the people are altogether kind and good: she will certainly continue, one hopes, to get better here.</p>
<p>The Horse is now out in the field here; and seems doing very well: I meant to have a ride upon him this afternoon; but the groom advises not, till tomorrow. Probably he will wait upon you about this day week or so,&#x2014; in fact they have no <hi rend="italic">grass</hi> to spare here; and as Bobus is not fit for hard food and a close stable, we mean to send him by the first <hi rend="italic">convenient</hi> Steamer. Jane did not write to you; for <hi rend="italic">last</hi> night did not suit the creature to sail,&#x2014;at least they were afraid it would not have suited.&#x2014;&#x2014; I still think of returning by Ireland:&#x2014;but there is nothing settled yet; you will hear farther soon.&#x2014;&#x2014; &#x2014;&#x2014; I had a Letter this morning from Jean (about the &#x201C;Gig&#x201D; &#x26;c): all is well there. <closer><salute>Tell Jack to write; and commend me to my Mother, and say I will see her soon, and be a good boy!&#x2014;</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Fitzgerald,</salute>
<p>After much futile consultation with myself, about walking in the Chiltern Hills and other equally promising speculations, Naseby having failed, and Suffolk lying on the wrong side of the Country for me,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Evidently FitzGerald had written that he was unable to meet TC at Naseby but would be glad to receive him at Boulge Cottage, Suffolk.</note>&#x2014;I decided last monday morning that I was too much of a spooney at present for any of those adventures; that I ought once for all to stow myself like luggage, which was my real character, into the Liverpool train, and so be bowled off straight to my destination, with no effort but that of packing my boxes, and paying so much cash. On Thursday accordingly I did, not without an effort, get seated in the mail train; and that same afternoon, was honourably carried hither,&#x2014;safe so far, and without exertion more than even a spooney was equal to. That is the history of my travels hitherto; which I meant to <pb id="pg-20-259" n="20:259"/>have given you some days sooner, had not indolence still prevailed. In fact I do nothing here, but smoke a good deal of tobacco, bathe once daily in the Mersey brine, dawdle about among the shady groves, and listen to the great voice of the sea and the winds. An extremely indolent man indeed.</p>
<p>Suffolk and Boulge House I do by no means score out of my Books, tho&#x2019; on this occasion I could not entertain the kind offer: such hospitality as you describe really seems as if it would suit me right well; and at some other time the thought of running out from Cockneydom thither will certainly strive to realize itself;&#x2014;a good time, which we hope <hi rend="italic">is</hi> coming at no very great distance.</p>
<p>The beautiful fresh air and quiet are nerving me here a little: before getting into Scotland, in about a week hence, I think of a flying glance at Ireland,&#x2014;over to Dublin, then up the coast to Belfast, and so home:&#x2014;but we shall see whether that proves executable or not! After that, for aught I know, I am in Scotland till I go to Chelsea again. &#x201C;Scotsbrig, Ecclefechan N. B.&#x201D; is always a central address for me in those regions, should you or your thoughts by good chance happen to wander thitherward.</p>
<p><closer><salute>Heaven love you.</salute></closer></p>
<closer><salute>Yours very truly /</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name>
<ps><p>My Horse (<hi rend="italic">Bobus</hi> we call him) goes across with me to Scotland; ends his carreer<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> there. Greathirst has been most helpful and faithful in all manner of emergencies connected with the Bobus department. A really worthy man.</p></ps>

<salute>Dear Jamie,</salute>
<p>I yesterday went into Liverpool, doing various small matters; and made among other things due inquiry about the transport of the Horse Bobus across to you by the Steamer. It appears the Steamer went last night; and had we known in time to warn you, the Horse might have gone then. There is now no convenient time for us till <hi rend="italic">Monday</hi> first: the Victoria does go on Friday, but it is at two o&#x2019;clock in the morning, which we naturally find an incommodious hour. On Monday the sailing hour is six in the evening; about six next morning the hour of arrival at Annan-foot: that will do very well for us. On <hi rend="italic">Tuesday morning</hi> therefore, unless you hear <pb id="pg-20-260" n="20:260"/>farther, you will expect the Horse and his furniture, in one condition or the other, at the Victoria landing-place there. There are bridle and saddle (with mud-leathers, <foreign><hi rend="italic">gambadoes</hi></foreign> as they call them fixed to the stirrup-leathers), with horse-cloth and roller (a kind of belt I think that <hi rend="italic">fastens</hi> the horse-cloth round; that is the &#x201C;roller&#x201D;): there will be all that, with a black horse,&#x2014;much astonished at his new situation, I dare say! The Beast is going about at grass here; quite recovered from his cold, but good for nothing yet to ride upon; being quite weak and timorous, when I tried him a few miles on the sand last Saturday. He is very gentle-tempered, but full of <hi rend="italic">fancy</hi> in his present weak state:&#x2014;you must turn him out to grass; and <hi rend="italic">there,</hi> I do hope, our very considerable botherations with him are about <hi rend="italic">done!</hi>&#x2014; Let the Doctor write me a little word between us and that time; and so we may know that all is right.</p>
<p>I am busy making up Alick&#x2019;s Canada Box! I yesterday got two Pilot-Coats, and surprising stormproof caps, a big and a small, intended as gifts for Alick and Tom; cloaks also for Jenny and Jane; today I am to see about getting a right <hi rend="italic">gun</hi>.&#x2014; Alick Welsh, whom we are to dine with today, is to be put on the subject: a strong sufficient Gun. I have <hi rend="italic">two</hi> Books (a <hi rend="italic">Spectator</hi> a <hi rend="italic">Plutarch</hi>), and no other definite thing yet whatever; nor indeed can I think of anything more very suitable, which could be attainable here.&#x2014; &#x2014; A Steamer, you will see by the card, leaves Annan on Saturday, and might still bring any Package in time for us here; but I <supplied>[doubt?]</supplied> that there will be any. The address for Packages is &#x201C;E. Paulet Esq, Dale Street.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Tell Jack to write to me, what is going on! How my Mother is; whom I hope soon to see. I believe I ought to go round by Ireland; Duffy (at Dublin, whom John knows) cordially invites me to be his guest; but that I think will hardly do. We shall see.&#x2014; I bathe here daily; find the fresh gentle wind, and indolent quiet, very wholesome. On or before the end of the first week of <date when="1846-08-00">August</date>, I consider myself due in Annandale.</p>
<p>Jane is somewhat livelier; evidently taking well with her quarters here. She means to stay a while longer, and then make for East Lothian, before she return. I did not get the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> till today: commend me heartily with it to my dear old Mother. The <hi rend="italic">Portrait</hi> is gone to Dumfries: I wrote to Jean and heard from her. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Brother</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name></p>

<p>Ever since Thursday Evening last, according to program, I have lain entirely dormant here; idle as the sands of the Mersey, or only chafing to and fro in aimless motion as the sea-waves do, which might as well sleep if they could. It is one of the most perfect Castles of Indolence<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. James Thomson&#x2019;s poem <hi rend="italic">The Castle of Indolence</hi> (<date when="1748-00-00">1748</date>).</note> this; a spacious square mansion, with verandahs, with quiet lawns, and trees or at least bushes all round; rocked by the softest western breezes under grey warm skies; and the perpetual humming lullaby of seas and woods, all day and night, inviting you to lie quite still, and meditate a little on the various madnesses of Human Life, and of one&#x2019;s own among the number! Add to which that we are free-and-easy almost to the degree of Gypsies; <hi rend="italic">soap</hi> in moderation; talk in moderation (none at all if you like); and yet a kind of real politeness welling up copiously everywhere as from natural fountains: it is the very place for lying <hi rend="italic">dormant</hi>. I smoke a great deal of tobacco; bathe once daily in the Atlantic brine, which is almost of tepid quality at present; read some withered American Biographies, or the like dry <hi rend="italic">buckskin</hi> Books totally harmless to the mind;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-20/lt-18460717-TC-RWE-01">TC to RWE, <date when="1846-07-17">17 July</date></ref>.</note>&#x2014;and think or dream of all imaginable and unimaginable things. A thousand salutations go from me daily towards Stanhope Street; not one of which you get to hear of! On the whole, what poorer are you? Last Wednesday this day week, late, past midnight, while you were at Lansdown House, all radiant to me and beautiful there, I, very ugly at Chelsea, amid my packages and lonesome wrecks, wrote you a Note: but that also you never heard of; I put it straightway in the fire, and went to sleep in silence.&#x2014; O Daughter of Adam most beautiful: O Son of Adam, in several respects, most <hi rend="italic">un</hi>beautiful!&#x2014;</p>
<p>But the essential thing is to tell you that my Wife is considerably better, and still in the way of improving; that she means to continue here for certain weeks yet, and then proceed to East Lothian (Haddington) before she return. We have talked of you: do not suppose that she does other, or ever did other, than respect and even love you,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; with some degree of terror. Baseless, I do believe.</p>
<p>As for me I go to Ireland; uncertain yet on what day or for how many days: certain only that I mean to be in Annandale fairly in wait to intercept you in that region. About the <date when="1846-08-10">10<hi rend="italic">th</hi> or 12<hi rend="italic">th</hi> of August</date> you cross the Border: at Carlisle I am only 20 miles from you, at Langholm only 14;&#x2014;twice as far <pb id="pg-20-262" n="20:262"/>would I walk on foot at any time for &#x201C;one blink of your bonny face,&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. &#x201C;But steal me a blink of your bonnie black e&#x2019;e&#x201D; from st. 2 of Burns, &#x201C;O whistle and I&#x2019;ll come to ye.&#x201D;</note> as the Scotch songs very justly call it. You will duly warn me, will you not? You are full of charity to me;&#x2014;for which the Supreme Destinies will certainly reward you. I, if I could ever reward you, Oh, would I not! But it is a vain hope that. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign> dear Lady mine,&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">mine</hi> yes, and yet forever no!</salute></closer></p>
