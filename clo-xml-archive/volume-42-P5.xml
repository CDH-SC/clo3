<p>Volume 42 of <hi rend="italic">The Collected Letters of Thomas and Jane Welsh Carlyle</hi> covers the period from <date when="1865-05-00">May</date> to <date when="1865-09-00">September 1865</date>. Of the 189 letters in this volume, 119 are from Thomas Carlyle, and 70 from Jane Welsh Carlyle, including two written by Geraldine Jewsbury for JWC when her hand was too painful for her to write. TC and JWC were apart for most of this period, so many of the letters are written to each other.</p>
<p>The letters of this volume dramatize the beginning of the end of the Carlyles&#x2019; long relationship. While neither TC nor JWC could know that JWC&#x2019;s death (in <date when="1866-04-00">April 1866</date>) was so close at hand during the writing of these letters, their often melancholic tone (especially evident in the earlier letters of this volume) appears to foreshadow this coming event. The note, for example, that TC wrote later to JWC&#x2019;s letter to him, <date when="1865-08-11">11 August</date>, outlines his post-<hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> feelings as he visited a friend in the Lake District: &#x201C;Nothing could exceed my private weariness, sadness, misery, and depression.&#x201D; But he then added the retrospective comment: &#x201C;Little thought it was, within few months, to be all sharpened into poignancy and tenderest woe, and remain with me in that far exceeding if somewhat nobler form&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note in Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi> 3:280). As the summer months of <date when="1865-00-00">1865</date> progressed, however, the couple experienced a welcome and surprising lightening of their physical infirmities and a return to relatively good health. With this restoration of bodily health came renewed mental well-being and a real sense of hope that, as they approached their later years (TC reached his seventieth birthday in <date when="1865-12-00">December 1865</date>), a healthful and productive Indian summer of their lives might be in store. Although JWC&#x2019;s death clearly removed this possibility, a number of the letters written in the second half of this volume anticipate a happier outcome than that which ultimately faced them. Illustrations of this remarkable, if brief, final act of their lives as a couple are evident in JWC&#x2019;s lively and witty letters that were written in the months after Dr. Russell had told her that she would be unlikely to regain the use of her right hand. This revival of bodily spirit and energy also foreshadowed TC&#x2019;s acceptance of the rectorship of the University of Edinburgh (in <date when="1865-11-00">November 1865</date>), only a short time after his oft-repeated declarations of retirement from public life following the completion of <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> in <date when="1865-02-00">February 1865</date>. These late letters in many ways reinstate the characters of two individuals that those readers who have followed the <hi rend="italic">Collected Letters</hi> in sequence will immediately recognize: JWC, tender, solicitous, and intimate (&#x201C;Yours lovingly&#x201D; she signed the letter to TC of <date when="1865-08-11">11 August</date>, quoted <pb id="pg-42-xii" n="42:xii"/>above); TC, engaged with his family and Scottish friends, shrewd and often spiky. He commented to JWC, 10 August, on Edinburgh: &#x201C;nay Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> itself I find to have left Town! They have clipt &#x26; dug away every feature that used to make Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> vernacular and interesting to me: Adieu to <hi rend="italic">it</hi> also!&#x201D; Their welcome return to familiar patterns of textual self-fashioning provides a pleasing and in many ways unexpected renaissance for a couple whose lives had earlier seemed played out.</p>
<p>The first words of a letter appearing early in this volume captured well the physical strain under which much of JWC&#x2019;s life in <date when="1865-00-00">1865</date> was lived. Writing from London to TC, who was then staying with his sister Mary Austin at The Gill, JWC declared that she could not use her hand &#x201C;without <hi rend="italic">extreme</hi> pain&#x201D; and that she had been &#x201C;quite wild with the pain the last two nights and days&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-42/lt-18650601-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1865-06-01">1 June</date>]</ref>). This infirmity affected not only the tone of Jane&#x2019;s ensuing letters but also their physical appearance. On the page, when she was unable to employ the services of an amanuensis, her uncharacteristically unsteady handwriting offered a visible endorsement of the weakness she described (for an example of her left-handed writing, see <ref target="volume-42/lt-18650608-JWC-TC-01">71</ref>). The brevity of many of Jane&#x2019;s letters also offered testament to the difficult circumstances under which they were composed. Her frustrations, captured in her good-natured but pathetic salutation to the letter quoted above&#x2014;&#x201C;Your lamed Goody&#x201D;&#x2014;are easily imaginable when taking into account the pleasure and flair with which she customarily entered into correspondence. TC&#x2019;s reply to this letter offered his characteristic counterpoint to her own account of pain and infirmity. While his genuine distress at JWC&#x2019;s condition was evident and his solicitousness for her welfare was quite sincere (&#x201C;Oh that this Note c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> find my poor tormented Darling to have had some better sleep when it arrives tomorrow morning!&#x201D;), he seemed drawn to take an equal part in her misery. In a line that can have done little to cheer up his ailing wife, TC opined: &#x201C;Oh what a fight we have, Dear;&#x2014;nothing for us but to cleave to one another, and fight side by side!&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-42/lt-18650602-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1865-06-02">2 June</date></ref>). But in this rather melodramatic aside, we have a revealing confirmation of the mutually dependent nature of their relationship. The need for TC and JWC to cleave to each other in the face of debilitating ill health (on her side), and the wearisome demands made upon a public intellectual (on his side), made the letters they exchanged vital tools for their mutual survival. With friends, and even with family, some level of polite distance needed to be retained, but between themselves the license offered by their long intimacy gave its own enduring therapy. If the benefits of this therapy are sometimes difficult to trace in the day-to-day exchanges of letters that took place when the couple was apart, they can be witnessed at those moments when the vagaries of the postal system prevented the arrival of an anticipated letter. One senses here both disappointment and anxiety on <pb id="pg-42-xiii" n="42:xiii"/>the part of the thwarted recipient, and in these qualities we can apprehend their profound mutual need for reassurance and support.</p>
<p>If the lives of the Carlyles had conformed to the plotting of a conventional Victorian novel, JWC&#x2019;s arrival in Scotland during <date when="1865-06-00">mid-June</date> would have restored her health rapidly, and likewise, TC&#x2019;s return to his homeland after completing the <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> volumes would have produced a similarly swift restorative effect. But JWC&#x2019;s last visit to Scotland before her death brought little in the way of immediate restoration of her bodily strength. Her quest for health-giving sleep while staying with old friends in Thornhill (Mary Russell in Holmhill and Mrs. Ewart in Nithbank) proved in the main as elusive as it had been when she stayed with the Macmillans in Tooting during the <date when="1865-06-00">earlier part of June</date>; only a week into her Scottish sojourn, and despairing of the repose she sought, JWC wrote to Lady Ashburton, telling her that she longed &#x201C;for home&#x201D; and that she &#x201C;would just rush back [to Chelsea] if it were not for the mad look of the thing!&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-42/lt-18650625-JWC-LLA-01">JWC to <sic>Lady A</sic><corr>LLA</corr>, <date when="1865-06-25">25 June</date></ref>). JWC&#x2019;s mood was further depressed during her stay in Scotland when Dr. Russell gloomily and incorrectly predicted that her &#x201C;right hand [had] gone to the dogs <hi rend="italic">for good</hi>&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-42/lt-18650725-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1865-07-25">25 July</date>]</ref>). TC&#x2019;s return to his native land following the conclusion of his work on <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> was similarly unproductive, at least initially, in terms of rejuvenating his mind and body; in a letter written to Lady Stanley in <date when="1865-07-16">July</date>, he lamented: &#x201C;I have lain here for these 6 weeks, the <hi rend="italic">mutest</hi>, laziest &#x26; most stagnant of all the sons of men. Never in my life so <hi rend="italic">tired</hi> before&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-42/lt-18650716-TC-LST-01">TC to <sic>Lady S</sic><corr>LST</corr>, <date when="1865-07-16">16 July</date></ref>). But the return of JWC to London, <date when="1865-07-00">late July</date>, and TC&#x2019;s own return a month later brought about a marked improvement in their wellbeing. JWC&#x2019;s own improvement was apparently the result of a remarkable act of will on her part, as a letter written on her return to Cheyne Row testified; writing to Lady Stanley following Dr. Russell&#x2019;s pessimistic prognosis about her hand, JWC recalled her imagined reply to that doctor: &#x201C;I
<hi rend="small-caps">will</hi>
 have back my hand, say what you may,&#x201D; and then, as she continued to Lady Stanley, &#x201C;the <hi rend="italic">Spirit of Contradiction</hi>, which seemed to rush over me to the finger ends, acted like a shock of electricity on the lamed hand, bracing it up to do or attempt things that had seemed impossible&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-42/lt-18650729-JWC-LS-01">JWC to <sic>Lady S</sic><corr>LST</corr>, [<date when="1865-07-29">29 July</date>]</ref>). Only a few days later JWC was able to write to TC of the &#x201C;relief of this comparative ease after <hi rend="italic">five months</hi> of constant wearing pain and helplessness&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-42/lt-18650802-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, <date when="1865-08-02">2 Aug.</date></ref>). The improvement in JWC&#x2019;s sleep during this period appeared key to the restoration of her bodily strength, and her claim, while staying in Folkestone in <date when="1865-08-00">mid-August</date>, that she had slept better there than she had for the previous three years, underpinned her subsequent comment to Jessie Hiddleston that she was now beginning to sleep &#x201C;actually like a human-Being&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-42/lt-18650819-JWC-JH-01">JWC to JH, [<date when="1865-08-19">19 Aug.</date>]</ref>). While this somewhat miraculous restoration of health was prone to periodic relapses into familiar weakness and listlessness during the <pb id="pg-42-xiv" n="42:xiv"/>early autumn of <date when="1865-00-00">1865</date>, the general trend in JWC&#x2019;s health over this period was towards improvement.</p>
<p>Some of TC&#x2019;s friends commented on what they felt his post-<hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> mood should be; Thomas Woolner wrote to Lady Ashburton, <date when="1865-09-04">4 September</date>, that although TC looked well physically, &#x201C;I think the almost entire want of intelligent notice of his great work now completed must make him feel depressed. When a man has brought the full force of a colossal spirit to bear on one subject, and overcoming incredible difficulties, at last without a word of encouragement brings his labours to a conclusion, he wants something besides the consciousness of having done his duty; a few words to show that his toilsome struggle has at least been recognised would surely be not too much to expect&#x201D; (see <ref target="volume-42/lt-18650829-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1865-08-29">29 Aug.</date></ref>). But, while TC was generally pessimistic about his own health and mood while staying in Scotland, following his return to Chelsea he appeared to re-evaluate the effects of his return to his homeland. Writing to his brother John in <date when="1865-09-00">mid-September</date>, TC noted material improvements in his own health in an uncharacteristically optimistic register: &#x201C;I am getting back my sleep ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi>. &#x2026; My feet have not been so easy in their shoes for 10 years back; my power of walking too is considerable&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-42/lt-18650914-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1865-09-14">14 Sept.</date></ref>). In addition, in the same letter, TC confirmed his own sense of his wife&#x2019;s physical and mental restoration: &#x201C;Jane is doing well, too; drives ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> unwearily (ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> twice a week I go with her); and really seems to be <hi rend="italic">better</hi> than we have seen her for a long time past&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-42/lt-18650914-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1865-09-14">14 Sept.</date></ref>). The generally optimistic mood of TC and JWC in the letters written during the latter stages of this volume appear some distance from the ill-humor that had prompted TC in early August to lament gloomily while writing to his brother Alexander in Canada: &#x201C;The truth is, I am much worn out; also very old; and ought now to know well that the <hi rend="italic">end</hi> cannot and even sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not be far off&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-42/lt-18650806-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1865-08-06">6 Aug.</date></ref>).</p>
<p>With the lifting of TC&#x2019;s spirits came the first signs that he might be ready to return to work. His acceptance of the offer of the rectorship of the University of Edinburgh (made <date when="1865-11-00">November 1865</date>, early in the period covered by vol. 43) may have been due to the improvement to his spirits following his Scottish sojourn. Indeed, TC&#x2019;s self-imposed removal from the public sphere during much of <date when="1865-00-00">1865</date> can be registered in the relative lack of political argument in the letters in this volume. Those readers anticipating TC&#x2019;s pronouncements here on public events&#x2014;and in particular on the American Civil War, which was then entering its final phase&#x2014;will be disappointed. One of his rare pronouncements on the war, in a letter written to his brother John A. Carlyle, registered his world-weary mien in the wake of Lincoln&#x2019;s assassination: &#x201C;(poor old Lincoln, and [thus in MS] innocent simple man, of considerable faculty &#x26; sense, the very <hi rend="italic">best</hi> man I have heard of in these American murderings &#x26; massacrings for no cause!)&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-42/lt-18650501-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1865-05-01">1 May</date></ref>). What broader political commentary we do gain here indicates the ossification of his existing attitudes <pb id="pg-42-xv" n="42:xv"/>rather than the emergence of fresh perspectives; in a peppery letter written to Joseph Neuberg in <date when="1865-07-08">July</date>, TC railed against &#x201C;the old detested element, of Penny Newsp<hi rend="italic">rs</hi>, Philanthropy, Italian Organs, and [the] railway miracle ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi>,&#x201D; before castigating John Stuart Mill: &#x201C;A most clear, ingenuous, logically limpid soul; and of such a <hi rend="italic">depth</hi> as to believe in the Suffrage of Niggers and persons that can do a sum in the Rule of Three!&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-42/lt-18650708-TC-JN-01">TC to JN, <date when="1865-07-08">8 July</date></ref>). Elsewhere we gain only an occasional glimpse of TC engaging with the good and the great of the day; a letter to Emerson written from Annan in <date when="1865-06-00">mid-June</date> reflected gloomily upon his own life and prospects before offering his old friend a more positive salutation: &#x201C;I have entirely lost count &#x26; reckoning of y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> enormous element, and its d<hi rend="italic">o</hi> affairs &#x26; procedures, for some time past; &#x26; can only wish (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> no man more heartily does) that all may issue in as blessed a way as you hope&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-42/lt-18650614-TC-RWE-01">TC to RWE, <date when="1865-06-14">14 June</date></ref>). Elsewhere, TC admitted in a letter to his brother John in <date when="1865-09-00">mid-September</date> that while recent company he had kept included old friends John Ruskin, John Forster, and James Froude, there &#x201C;seldom comes any one whom I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> prefer to my <hi rend="italic">Racine</hi> &#x26; the fresh air!&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-42/lt-18650914-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1865-09-14">14 Sept.</date>)</ref>.</p>
<p>While TC might confess (as he did to his sister Jean Aitken in <date when="1865-09-00">late September</date>) that &#x201C;all my Work seems done&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-42/lt-18650927-TC-JCA-01">TC to JCA, <date when="1865-09-27">27 Sept.</date></ref>), there are glimpses in these letters of the celebrity status he continued to enjoy in Victorian society. The majority of these glimpses are offered in JWC&#x2019;s wry reflections on TC&#x2019;s fame and its consequences; witness, for example, the effect of TC&#x2019;s presence on &#x201C;ever so many young drapers&#x201D; who, Mrs. Ewart&#x2019;s housemaid tells her, had &#x201C;run frae Thornhill to the station to get a bare look o&#x2019; Mr. Carlyle!&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-42/lt-18650711-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1865-07-11">11 July</date>]</ref>). Four days later, writing again to TC after his visit to Nithbank, JWC commented, &#x201C;You were immensely admired yesterday! Poor little Christie declared it &#x2018;the proudest day of his Life&#x2019;!&#x201D; and Mrs. Ewart (with whom JWC was staying) proclaimed, &#x201C;its made the <hi rend="italic">Creturs</hi> rale happy! If M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle isn&#x2019;t the waur for&#x2019;t it was worth while to gie them the chance!&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-42/lt-18650715-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1865-07-15">15 July</date>]</ref>). Although this &#x201C;local hero&#x201D; status might be anticipated in TC&#x2019;s native Scotland, JWC&#x2019;s discovery of her own image in a London photographer&#x2019;s shop window prompted a characteristically witty reflection to TC on her public place in his shadow: &#x201C;it proves the interest or curiosity <hi rend="italic">you</hi> excite&#x2014;for being neither a &#x2018;distinguished Authoress,&#x2019; nor a &#x2018;celebrated murderess,&#x2019; nor an actress nor a &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">Skittles</hi>&#x2019; [courtesan], the four classes of women promoted to the shop windows it can only be as <hi rend="italic">M</hi>rs Carlyle that they offer me for sale&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-42/lt-18650730-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, <date when="1865-07-30">30 July</date></ref>). These small acknowledgments of TC&#x2019;s enduring fame are important in helping to remind us that he still attracted a level of interest that few other public figures of the day could expect. We can recognize, in these illustrations of his enduringly high regard among the public, the potential platform that still awaited TC if he chose to step out of the shadows and return to the limelight.</p>
<p>But while TC&#x2019;s own hero status evidently remained strong into the late <pb id="pg-42-xvi" n="42:xvi"/><date when="1860-00-00">1860</date>s, it is JWC who emerges as the heroic figure in this volume of letters. Although she clearly wrote the majority of her letters in this volume while under immense physical strain, her capacity to convey real warmth and affection in her correspondence&#x2014;and her ability to inspire affection in others&#x2014;remained largely intact. One remarkable illustration of this can be witnessed in a letter that she wrote to Isabella Barnes Simmonds after hearing that Isabella&#x2019;s young daughter had died. While JWC was then at a very low physical ebb herself, she still managed to muster a formulation of words (written with her left hand) capable of offering genuine and touching sympathy to a friend on her bereavement: &#x201C;Oh try to bear up for your Husband&#x2019;s sake and for the sake of the Baby unborn who is soon to come and comfort you for the little Sister taken away&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-42/lt-18650710-JWC-IEB-01">JWC to IS <corr>[IEB]</corr>, <date when="1865-07-10">10 July</date></ref>). The qualities of kindness and empathy, evident in this short but moving letter, remain a feature of JWC&#x2019;s letters. Evident also is the keen sense of humor with which her letters (and particularly those written on her return from Scotland) are peppered. A single choice exhibit might suffice to convey the endurance of her comic touch in this, her last summer; in a letter written to TC in <date when="1865-08-00">early August</date> (which incidentally provides further eloquent commentary on TC&#x2019;s undiminished celebrity status), JWC reflected upon her taking the ink spots out of his writing table: &#x201C;Had It been going straight to any Literary Museum, I shouldn&#x2019;t have meddled with the
<hi rend="small-caps">ink</hi>
, which Hero-worshipers might have regarded with <hi rend="italic">a certain</hi> adoration; but for your <hi rend="italic">own</hi> use, I thought you would like it better <hi rend="italic">clean</hi>!&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-42/lt-18650908-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1865-08-09">9 Aug.</date>]</ref>). Also evident in this volume, in which TC and JWC are physically apart for an extended period of time, is TC&#x2019;s acknowledgment of the debt he owed to his wife&#x2019;s selfless management of his welfare. The strength and importance of their partnership was something of which TC appeared increasingly aware during their geographical separation and JWC&#x2019;s failing health. The manner in which TC opened his first <date when="1865-08-00">August</date> letter to JWC&#x2014;who had just reported to him a brief respite in her sleeplessness&#x2014;conveyed the extent to which his own spirit was lifted at the thoughts of her improving health: &#x201C;Y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Letter of this morn<hi rend="italic">g</hi> is charming; a thing really to thank Heaven for! Oh may it continue; and our poor little &#x2018;arm&#x2019; only soon get well!&#x201D; The ending of this letter (&#x201C;Oh Darling, what is this patch of paper, with iron pen &#x26; hand shaky, in face of all I had to say to thee!&#x201D; [<ref target="volume-42/lt-18650801-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1865-08-01">1 Aug.</date></ref>]), with its naked affection and pathetic tenderness, seems to take us back to the beginnings of their relationship forty years before. Those of us reading this letter can, with hindsight, see it as looking forward to the despair TC would feel in <date when="1866-04-00">April 1866</date> when JWC&#x2019;s death drew the curtain down on the last act of their lives together.</p>

<p><hi rend="italic"><date when="1865-05-00">May</date></hi>. TC writes to his brother John A. Carlyle of his sadness at hearing of the assassination of Abraham Lincoln (<date when="1865-05-01">1</date>). He discusses investments with John and the best way to send &#xa3;20 to his sister Jenny Hanning in Canada (<date when="1865-05-02">2</date>). JWC tells Mary Russell, &#x201C;there has been such a <hi rend="italic">Sitting</hi> to Photographers as never was heard of! Woolner wants a variety of Photographs to work from; and the Photographers want a variety to
<hi rend="small-caps">sell</hi>
!&#x201D; (<date when="1865-05-04">4</date>). JWC is considering her own holiday plans once TC finalizes his trip to Scotland (<date when="1865-05-04">4</date>). The Carlyles dine at Dean Stanley&#x2019;s (<date when="1865-05-05">5</date>). TC writes to his brother James Carlyle that he has arranged for Noggs to travel by train to Scotland (<date when="1865-05-08">8</date>) and tells his brother John that he is reading David Laing on John Knox (<date when="1865-05-11">11</date>). TC apologizes to John Ruskin for his over-emphatic condemnation of Holman Hunt&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">The Light of the World</hi> (<date when="1865-05-13">13</date>). JWC writes Margaret Hiddleston&#x2019;s daughter Jessie to sympathize on her mother&#x2019;s death and to ask if she would like to come to Chelsea as maid (<date when="1865-05-15">15</date>), but then has second thoughts ([<date when="1865-05-19">19</date>]); she finally invites her to come as her servant in <date when="1865-07-24">July</date> ([<date when="1865-05-24">24</date>]). TC takes the train from London to Dumfries to visit his sister Jean Aitken (<date when="1865-05-22">22</date>). JWC stays at home, tries remedies for her painful right arm, has a plumber in to repair leaks, prepares for decorators, and is visited by several people including Charles Gavan Duffy (<date when="1865-05-30">30</date>). TC pays a visit by train to Thornhill to see the Russells (<date when="1865-05-30">30</date>). JWC&#x2019;s painful arm begins to make writing difficult.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic"><date when="1865-06-00">June</date></hi>. TC moves to The Gill, home of his sister Mary Austin (<date when="1865-06-01">1</date>); &#x201C;my prospects are better here&#x201D; TC tells JWC (<date when="1865-06-02">2</date>). JWC goes for advice to Dr. Quain about her painful arm and hand; he recommends that she go to Scotland. She visits the Macmillans in Tooting, leaving painting and the fitting of bookcases to be done in her absence (<date when="1865-06-02">2</date>). TC writes to Lady Ashburton about the Woolner bust of him that she has commissioned: &#x201C;the features seemed accurately there; but the whole was a little stony and terrible.&#x201D; TC writes to encourage JWC to come to Scotland and to stay with the Russells in Thornhill (<date when="1865-06-05">5</date>). He rides Noggs, relaxes, and enjoys the quiet (<date when="1865-06-05">5</date>), though eating porridge at night gives him indigestion (<date when="1865-06-06">6</date>). JWC&#x2019;s sleep improves with the help of whisky toddy; she has Geraldine Jewsbury and Mrs. Macmillan write letters to TC on her behalf, such is the pain in her writing hand (<date when="1865-06-06">6</date>), but is able to add postscripts or sign the letters with her left hand (<date when="1865-06-08">8</date>). JWC&#x2019;s horse and carriage have an accident, apparently without her ([<date when="1865-06-12">12</date>]). TC feels very gloomy, telling JWC that &#x201C;the <pb id="pg-42-xxvi" n="42:xxvi"/>world has become, in many parts, hideous to me&#x201D; (<date when="1865-06-13">13</date>); he admits to Emerson that since finishing <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> he is a &#x201C;totally worn-out man&#x201D; (<date when="1865-06-14">14</date>). JWC, back in London, stays with the Blunts in Chelsea Rectory while painters are busy in Cheyne Row, and then travels overnight (<date when="1865-06-16">16</date>&#x2013;<date when="1865-06-17">17</date>) by train to Carlisle, then to Thornhill to stay with the Russells. TC, overjoyed, visits her (<date when="1865-06-22">22</date>) and begs her to stay longer, but JWC tells Lady Ashburton that the trip has done nothing so far to alleviate her pain (<date when="1865-06-25">25</date>). TC visits Scotsbrig to see his brother Jamie and family (<date when="1865-06-26">26</date>). JWC writes to her housekeeper, Mrs. Warren, in Chelsea, asking her to keep an eye on the carpenter, and to use the Carlyles&#x2019; absence to mend the sheets (<date when="1865-06-29">29</date>).</p>
<p><hi rend="italic"><date when="1865-07-00">July</date></hi>. JWC, too weak to visit The Gill, takes the train to Dumfries and spends three hours with TC at his sister Jean&#x2019;s (<date when="1865-07-01">1</date>). She moves to Nithbank to stay with Mrs. Ewart (<date when="1865-07-03">3</date>), still complaining of pain in her right arm and sleeplessness, and TC visits her there (<date when="1865-07-06">6</date>). TC&#x2019;s sister Jean visits him at The Gill. TC writes Thomas Spedding asking about a possible visit to Mirehouse (<date when="1865-07-08">8</date>); he writes to Neuberg with answers to his enquiries about various books and offers Neuberg Noggs, his horse, as a gift (<date when="1865-07-08">8</date>). JWC is taking various medicines to no avail; she considers a holiday in Folkestone with Caroline Davenport Bromley while TC considers going to the Western Isles. JWC writes Isabella Simmonds to console her on the death of her child (<date when="1865-07-10">10</date>). TC visits JWC in Nithbank for dinner (<date when="1865-07-14">14</date>). JWC writes Ruskin to thank him for a book (<date when="1865-07-15">15</date>), gives up her scheme of visiting Betty Braid in Edinburgh en route back to London (<date when="1865-07-15">15</date>), and returns to Holmhill for a further week (<date when="1865-07-16">16</date>). TC and his brother John are still considering a trip to the Hebrides via the Orkneys and to visit Sir George Sinclair in Thurso (<date when="1865-07-15">15</date>). JWC writes to Lady Ashburton, &#x201C;dearest, kindest of Friends,&#x201D; saying how sorry she is not to see her before she goes abroad (<date when="1865-07-18">18</date>). TC goes to Mirehouse (<date when="1865-07-17">17</date>&#x2013;<date when="1865-07-20">20</date>), back to Ecclefechan by rail, to Scotsbrig (<date when="1865-07-20">20</date>&#x2013;<date when="1865-07-22">22</date>), and then to The Gill. JWC leaves Scotland (<date when="1865-07-24">24</date>); she is invited to stay a few days with the Stanleys at Alderley on her way home, but decides to travel directly to London with the new servant, Jessie Hiddleston, meeting TC briefly at Dumfries station en route. The trip to the Hebrides is abandoned (<date when="1865-07-26">26</date>) to TC&#x2019;s relief; he goes instead to Edinburgh. In London JWC visits Caroline Davenport Bromley (<date when="1865-07-25">25</date>), and manages to see Lady Ashburton who had postponed her trip (<date when="1865-07-26">26</date> and <date when="1865-07-27">27</date>), and visits the Macmillans at Tooting (<date when="1865-07-30">30</date>). TC declines Henry Inglis&#x2019;s invitation to his home near Melrose, but hopes to see him in Edinburgh (<date when="1865-07-30">30</date>).</p>
<p><hi rend="italic"><date when="1865-08-00">August</date></hi>. TC is resting at Scotsbrig, visiting locally; JWC is in Chelsea in improving health, driving out daily, TC advises three hours (<date when="1865-08-01">1</date>), visiting a sick Forster (<date when="1865-08-01">1</date> and <date when="1865-08-03">3</date>) and sorting onto the new shelves TC&#x2019;s numerous books that have been brought down from the attic study (<date when="1865-08-07">7</date>). TC visits a neglected Craigenputtoch with his brother James (<date when="1865-08-05">5</date>). He writes to his brother Alexander: <pb id="pg-42-xxvii" n="42:xxvii"/>&#x201C;I am much worn out; also very old&#x201D; (<date when="1865-08-06">6</date>). TC and his brother John go to Edinburgh (<date when="1865-08-08">8</date>). JWC goes to Folkestone to visit Miss Bromley (<date when="1865-08-14">14</date>). TC visits Edinburgh acquaintances and goes sea-bathing in Portobello; he visits Betty Braid and JWC&#x2019;s Morningside aunts (<date when="1865-08-12">12</date>), then goes to Stow to see Henry Inglis after all (<date when="1865-08-14">14</date>). He then goes to Linlathen to visit Erskine (<date when="1865-08-16">16</date>&#x2013;<date when="1865-08-19">19</date>), to Keir to the Stirling Maxwells (<date when="1865-08-19">19</date>&#x2013;<date when="1865-08-22">22</date>), back to Edinburgh, to Lord and Lady Lothian at Newbattle, Dalkeith, for the day (<date when="1865-08-23">23</date>), then back to Scotsbrig and The Gill; he returns to Chelsea (<date when="1865-08-28">28</date>), though JWC (who was enjoying her Folkestone trip) wishes he would stay away longer; she also returns to Chelsea (<date when="1865-08-28">28</date>) in order to arrive before TC.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic"><date when="1865-09-00">September</date></hi>. TC and JWC visit the Ruskins (<date when="1865-09-01">1</date>). TC sleeps badly, but walks better; he still feels exhausted and nervous after finishing <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> (<date when="1865-09-10">10</date>). In the hot weather JWC tells Lady Lothian, &#x201C;[w]e lie about on sofas: languid, stupid, sick&#x2014;physically and morally&#x201D; (<date when="1865-09-10">10</date>). TC writes to his brother John, enclosing photographs he has just received from their brother Alexander Carlyle in Canada, and comments on how welcome must be John&#x2019;s gift of &#xa3;100 to help Alexander&#x2019;s son Tom through difficult times. TC has many visitors, even &#x201C;tho&#x2019; the Town is said to be &#x2018;empty altogether&#x2019;&#x201D; (<date when="1865-09-14">14</date>).</p>

His behaviour was that of an illiterate, vulgar, and drunken rowdy, and, could it have been displayed before any other legislative assembly in the world, would have led to his arrest by the serjeant-at-arms, if not to his ignominious expulsion by the deliberate vote of his insulted colleagues&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, <date when="1865-03-20">20 March</date>).</note>

,</salute>&#x2014;Two or three days ago, I saw a letter from you to Sister Jean;
<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jean Carlyle Aitken.</note>
 which was very welcome here, as bringing more definite news of you than we had got for a good while before. I have now got done with my Book (a copy of it probably in your hands before this);
<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The final vols. of <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi>, 5 and 6, were pbd. <date when="1865-03-00">mid-March</date>, with copies sent out <date when="1865-03-00">late March</date> and <date when="1865-04-00">April</date>; see <ref target="volume-41/lt-18650329-TC-JF-01"><sic>41:199</sic><corr>TC to JF, <date when="1865-03-29">29 March</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-41/lt-18650406-TC-JAC-01"><sic>203&#x2013;4</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1865-04-06">6 April</date></corr></ref>.</note>
 and am not henceforth to be so dreadfully hampered in writing a little note to my friends from time to time. I am still in a huge fuss, confusions of all kinds lying about me, and indeed I am just about running off for Scotland (to Jean&#x2019;s, in the first place), to try and recover a little from the completely shattered state these twelve years of incessant drudgery and slaving have reduced me to. But there is something I had meant, this long time and here it is&#x2014;just come to hand. Inclosed is a Paper which will bring you the amount of Dollars for &#xa3;20, on your presenting it at the Hamilton Bank.
<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-42/lt-18650502-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1865-05-02">2 May</date></ref>.</note>
 If by way of &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">identifying</hi>,&#x201D; they ask you who <hi rend="italic">sends</hi> the money, you can answer with my name, and if further needful, add that the Negotiator for me with the Edinr. Bank, was <hi rend="italic">Dr</hi>. Carlyle of that City. Nothing more, I suppose, if even that much will be necessary. Let me know by return that it is safe in your hand (a newspaper with <hi rend="italic">three</hi> strokes will serve if you are short of time for the moment). And so with my best blessings, dear little Jenny, accept this poor mark of my remembrance.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-42-7" n="42:7"/>My Jane is very frail and feeble, but always stirring about, and has got blessedly away out of the horrible torments she had (and all of you had on her account) last year. Scotsbrig, Gill, Dumfries, Edinburgh;
<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Where TC and Janet Hanning&#x2019;s siblings lived; James Carlyle lived at Scotsbrig, near Ecclefechan; Mary Carlyle Aitken at The Gill, near Annan; Jean Carlyle Aitken at The Hill, Dumfries; and, John A. Carlyle in Edinburgh.</note>
 all is going in the usual average way there. To you I can fancy what a distress the removal of your poor little Mary and her Husband to the Far West
<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mary, Jenny&#x2019;s second da., and her husband, Charles Coates Holden, were apparently moving to Iowa in the U.S midwest.</note>
 must be! These things happen and are <hi rend="italic">inevitable</hi> in the current of life. That your son-in-law is a good man, this should be a great joy to you. Do not you be <hi rend="italic">too</hi> hasty to follow to Iowa; consider it well first.</p>
<p>You see what a shaky hand I have; you do not see the bitter hurry I am still in! With kindest wishes to you and all your household,</p>

<p><salute>Darling.</salute> When I camein today and saw a letter from you on the table; I felt myself make as near an approximation to a <hi rend="italic">blush</hi> as my sallow complexion is capable of! It was a little &#x201C;coal of fire&#x201D; heaped on my head!
<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Prov. 25:22.</note>
 For days back, I had been thinking how neglectful I must seem to you, making no answer to that kindest of letters and of invitations,&#x2014;written too when you were ailing, and &#x201C;looking at the Dark of Things&#x201D;!
<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC&#x2019;s variant of the phrase &#x201C;the dark [or &#x201C;bright&#x201D;] side of things.&#x201D;</note>
 You had still managed to look at the Bright of <hi rend="italic">me</hi>; since you could believe that my presence would &#x201C;cheer you&#x201D;&#x2014;instead of boring you! But it was not that I was <hi rend="italic">really</hi> not caring to write. Nor yet, that I was giving way to physical languor (tho that has been considerable) It was, that for the last week or two, I have been kept in a whirl of Things, that made it out of the question for me to sit down quietly and make up my mind what to say. Lady Ashburton has been in Town again; and the Miss Dempster, who staid with us at Seaton, is in London for a short time; and I have had, for Lady A&#x2019;s sake, to <hi rend="italic">devote</hi> myself to her a good deal. And Duffy (the Irish <pb id="pg-42-8" n="42:8"/>Patriot) is home from Australia and had to be asked to dinner. And old Sir George Sinclair
<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sir George Sinclair was visiting his son, John George Tollemache Sinclair, who lived in Upper Norwood, SE London; see <ref target="volume-40/lt-18640411-TC-JWC-01"><sic>40:63</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1864-04-11">11 April [1864]</date></corr></ref>.</note>
 had to be asked to a three o&#x2019;clock dinner! And M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> George Welsh
<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Margaret Welsh, widow of JWC&#x2019;s paternal uncle George.</note>
 came for &#x201C;a long day.&#x201D; And once I had to go out to dinner! <hi rend="italic">Me</hi>!&#x2014;the first time for two years and a half! And I am going out to dinner again tomorrow at the Dean of Westminsters,
<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Arthur Penrhyn Stanley who lived at Dean&#x2019;s Yard, Westminster.</note>
 and all this with a running accompaniment of Sculpture and Photography! M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C has been sitting to Woolner for his Bust&#x2014; And it seems he &#x201C;is as difficult to catch a likeness of, as a flash of lightening&#x201D; is, so that it is a trying business for both Sitter and Sculptor. and I am afraid the Bust will never be worth the hundred guineas Lady A will pay for it! Meanwhile I have had to drive up to Woolner&#x2019;s every two or three days and climb steep endless stairs; to tell what faults I see! and in connection with this Bust, there has been such a <hi rend="italic">Sitting</hi> to Photographers as never was heard of! Woolner wants a variety of Photographs to work from; and the Photographers want a variety to
<hi rend="small-caps">sell</hi>
! and M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle yields to their mutual entreaties. And then, when they have had their will of <hi rend="italic">him</hi>, they insist on <hi rend="italic">doing me</hi>;
<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For John Watkins&#x2019;s photographs, taken in <date when="1865-04-00">April</date>, see <ref target="volume-41/lt-18650421-TC-JOWA-01"><sic>41:213&#x2013;16</sic><corr>JWC to JOWA, <date when="1865-04-21">21 April</date></corr></ref>; Elliott &#x26; Fry also took photographs of both Carlyles; see <ref target="volume-42/lt-18650529-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1865-05-29">29 May</date></ref>.</note>
 (for my <hi rend="italic">name&#x2019;s</hi> sake) And M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C insists too; thinking always the new one may be more successful than former ones! So that with one thing and another&#x2014;I have been worried from morning till night&#x2014;and postponed writing till I should have got leisure to <hi rend="italic">think what was to be written</hi>.</p>
<p>But I must not put off any longer since you are getting uneasy about me. I am not worse&#x2014;indeed as to the sickness and the sleeplessness, I am <hi rend="italic">rather</hi> better in both respects. But I am weak and languid, have little appetite and am getting thinner The best thing for me would be to get away&#x2014;and away to <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, rather than anywhere else! I know <hi rend="italic">that</hi> well enough in both my heart and my head! But&#x2014;one cannot do just what one likes best, and even what is best <hi rend="italic">for</hi> one! I could not go with M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C for several reasons. First having made up his mind to go off &#x201C;at his own sweet will&#x201D;
<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; cf. Wordsworth, &#x201C;Composed upon Westminster Bridge&#x201D; line 12.</note>
 &#x2014;and having understood that I was to stay behind; he would now find it a great incumbrance to take me with him. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi> I have invited D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Blakiston and Bessey, to pay me a visit so soon as I have a Bedroom for them; and they have promised to come for a few days.
<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;They never came&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note in Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi> 3:252). Dr. Peyton and Bessy Blakiston with whom JWC stayed at St. Leonards, <date when="1865-03-00">March</date> to <date when="1864-04-00">April 1864</date>; see vol. 40.</note>
 About the <date when="1865-05-00">end of May</date> is the D<hi rend="italic">r</hi>&#x2019;s leisurest time at St Leonards. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi> M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C wants the Dining Room papered and fitted up with Bookcases, from the Study at <pb id="pg-42-9" n="42:9"/>the top of the House, which is too long a <hi rend="italic">climb</hi> for him now that Frederick is done, <hi rend="italic">That</hi> he expects me to &#x201C;see to&#x201D; in this absence. And how long it will take me to &#x201C;see to it&#x201D; will depend on the workmen!</p>
<p>For the rest; I am uncertain how long he will be away. If &#x201C;months&#x201D; (as he speaks of), there might still be time for me, after I had finished my business here, to rush off to Holm Hill, and stay as many <hi rend="italic">weeks</hi> with you, as I staid <hi rend="italic">months</hi> last year! I would so like it!</p>
<p>And M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C wouldnt <hi rend="italic">object</hi>, tho he would find it very absurd to be taking such a long journey so soon again. I put out a <hi rend="italic">feeler</hi> the other night. Miss Dempster was pressing him to visit <hi rend="italic">her</hi> when he should be in Forfarshire (he is going to Linlathen
<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >To visit Thomas Erskine.</note>
 amongst other places) and I said, &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">I</hi> shall perhaps be nearer you than <hi rend="italic">he</hi> will be! Lady Airlie was pressing me so hard today to come to Cortachy Castle,
<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Dempster family home was at Dunnichen in Forfarshire, about 9 mi. (14.5 km.) N of Linlathen (in Monifieth parish); Cortachy Castle is about 8 mi. (13 km.) NW of Dunnichen.</note>
 that there is no saying but I will follow him North. &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Indeed</hi>!&#x201D; he said, not with a frown but a smile. And I added&#x2014;&#x201C;If he stays away long I may at least get the length of Dumfriesshire.&#x201D;</p>
<p>I havent the remotest idea of going to Lady Airlie. I <hi rend="italic">like</hi> her very well but <hi rend="italic">living</hi> with her would fatigue me too much! She is for ever on the strain to be somebody else than <hi rend="italic">herself</hi>! Only I thought if I accustomed him to the possibility of my going all the way to Cortachy He wouldnt think so much of my going to Thornhill.
<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Holmhill was in Thornhill, Dumfriesshire.</note>
 But till I get my workmen out of the House, and know something definitive of M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Cs plans, I can determine nothing. Will you let me leave it open? I like so ill to say positively and absolutely &#x201C;No, I cannot come this year!&#x201D;&#x2014; Because you see, having a charachter for standing by my word to keep up; I could not, after an absolute &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">No</hi>,&#x2019; said <hi rend="italic">now</hi>, avail myself of any facilities for going to you which may turn up later. So may I leave the question open?</p>
<p>Oh I am grieved to the heart for that poor Margaret Hiddlestone! What a state to be reduced to, when the best wish one can have for her is that she were fairly <hi rend="italic">dead</hi> and out of her misery!
<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Margaret Hiddleston d. <date when="1865-05-04">4 May</date>; the <hi rend="italic">Dumfries and Galloway Courier</hi> reported, <date when="1865-05-16">16 May</date>: &#x201C;At 62 West Morton Street, Thornhill, on 4th inst., Margaret, relict of Mr. William Hiddlestone, tailor, aged 65 years.&#x201D;</note>
 And when the Queen herself could <hi rend="italic">do</hi> nothing for her&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">give</hi> her nothing to make Life as desirable as death.</p>
<p>Whata fearful trial it must be for the poor Daughter;
<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Either Margaret McCaig, the da. with whom Margaret Hiddleston lived (see <ref target="volume-40/lt-18640810-JWC-TC-01"><sic>40:177</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1864-08-10">[10 August 1864]</date></corr></ref>), or her other da., Jessie, who apparently gave up her job in Edinburgh and also helped care for her.</note>
 since she has a <pb id="pg-42-10" n="42:10"/>heart in her after all. Did you see the article in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, apropos of Constance Kent about young women at a certain age being all as good as devil possessed!
<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Constance Kent (<date when="1844-00-00">1844</date>&#x2013;<date when="1944-00-00">1944</date>) had just confessed to the murder of her half-brother, Francis Saville Kent (b. <date when="1856-00-00">1856</date>), <date when="1860-06-29">29 June 1860</date>, at Road Hill House, Wiltshire. &#x201C;From twelve or fourteen to eighteen or twenty is that period of life in which the tide of natural affection runs the lowest, leaving the body and the intellect unfettered and unweakened in the work of development, and leaving the heart itself open for the strong passions and overwhelming preferences that will then seize it. Youth, it must be confessed, does not feel much; and, sad to say, it is the softer sex especially which is said to go through a period of almost utter heartlessness&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, <date when="1865-04-27">27 April</date>).</note>
 I believe there is some truth in it!</p>
<p>Will Jessy return to her Place in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> after she is no more needed by her poor Mother?
<note n="15" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jessie was possibly employed at 8 York Place where her future husband, Robert Broadfoot, was butler.</note>
 If she have no settled arrangement in her head, I wonder if she would care to come to <hi rend="italic">me</hi>? and if she would suit me supposing she did? I remember thinking her very good looking, and very <hi rend="italic">noisy</hi> and <hi rend="italic">headlong</hi>! but I have heard you say she became a good Servant and I should like a <hi rend="italic">scotch</hi> Servant so much and one <hi rend="italic">known about</hi> provided she were otherwise qualified. (It is clear you will <hi rend="italic">never</hi> give me little Mary!)
<note n="16" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mary Russell&#x2019;s servant Mary of whom JWC was very fond; see <ref target="volume-42/lt-18651010-JWC-MR-01">JWC to MR, [<date when="1865-10-10">10 Oct</date>.</ref>].</note>
 I wish you would take the matter into consideration&#x2014;if Jessey be at liberty&#x2014;and <hi rend="italic">sound</hi> her about it. Most girls like the idea of coming to <hi rend="italic">London</hi>, but she would need to be warned that it would be very dull for her unless she have someone she knows here, and a faculty of adapting herself to her circumstance.</p>
<p>I shall not keep Fanny, in any case. I didn&#x2019;t <hi rend="italic">like</hi> her at the beginning,
<note n="17" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Fanny came to Cheyne Row as the maid <date when="1864-11-00">Nov. 1864</date>.</note>
 and since I had her with me at Seaton my dislike has grown to positive repugnance. Ever since that time of <hi rend="italic">guzzeling</hi> and <hi rend="italic">doing nothing</hi> she has been full of discontents; &#x201C;Lady Ashburton&#x2019;s Servants had <hi rend="italic">hot butchers meat</hi> three times a day&#x201D;; she is always complaining to M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Warren!
<note n="18" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Eliza Warren, cook and housekeeper since <date when="1864-11-00">Nov. 1864</date>.</note>
 and &#x201C;fried kidneys to breakfast and all sorts of things&#x201D;! M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Warren thinks Butcher&#x2019;s meat <hi rend="italic">once</hi> a day &#x201C;is much as is good for one, if there be <hi rend="italic">plenty</hi>.&#x201D; And so they have constant disputes, ending with Fanny declaring that she will give M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle warning. She doesnt
<hi rend="small-caps">mean</hi>
 to &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">leave</hi>&#x201D;&#x2014;only to be disagreeable and <hi rend="italic">try</hi> how much consequence she is of! But <hi rend="italic">I</hi> mean to not keep her. She is not so <hi rend="italic">very</hi> good a servant as to make up for being so very <hi rend="italic">nasty</hi> a woman! M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Warren continues a great success. I see no falling off in her since the first week&#x2014;when my fear was that she was too charming to last!</p>
<p>How absurd! in telling you on the other sheet how I was&#x2014;bodily&#x2014; I quite forgot to mention my most <hi rend="italic">serious</hi> ailment for the last six weeks. My <hi rend="italic">right</hi> arm <pb id="pg-42-11" n="42:11"/>has gone the way that my <hi rend="italic">left</hi> arm went two years ago.

<p><salute>Oh my Darling!</salute> It is not fair to speak in that way of going, and staying abroad indefinitely because you are not needed and cared for here! In fact it is &#x201C;a tempting of Providence&#x201D; to say such things! You cannot but know in your heart, that not one woman of a thousand has as much love laid at her feet as you have! or is as important to her fellow-creatures as you are! Go by all means, and even stay away ever so long; if your health and Spirits are to be the better for it; but at least gave one the comfort of thinking that you will miss one a little; and that you will be perfectly sure of our missing <hi rend="italic">you</hi> a great deal!</p>
<p>You will tell us when it is all fixed? I cannot give up the hope that you may be here again before starting.

<salute>Dear Jamie,</salute>
<p>The Horse &#x201C;Noggs&#x201D; will be with you on <hi rend="italic">Wednesday Morning</hi>. He is to leave London tomorrow ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi> at 9: he courses on, all night; is at Carlisle (if he prosper) by 6&#xBD;6 a.m.;&#x2014;thence at Ecclefechan (I &#x201C;suppose&#x201D;) bet<hi rend="italic">n</hi> 8 and 9. It has hitherto been impossible for me to ascertain <hi rend="italic">at</hi> what hour precisely: I bo<hi rend="italic">t</hi> a Bradshaw,
<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Bradshaw&#x2019;s Monthly General Railway and Steam Navigation Guide</hi>.</note>
 &#x26; have had it tried by two people, in vain; a third (Chorley),
<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Rutter Chorley.</note>
 still skilfuller, now has it, and his ans<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> will reach me before this goes, shall be reported to you, if it have anything of definite. Possibly the Ecclefechan station-master
<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Gordon (b. ca. <date when="1820-00-00">1820</date>).</note>
 c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> tell you <hi rend="italic">this</hi> much: &#x201C;Does the morning mail-train <hi rend="italic">stop</hi> at Ecclef<hi rend="italic">n</hi>;&#x2014;and is there <hi rend="italic">time</hi> at Carlisle to fasten a horse-box to it?&#x201D; I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> think, yes. There is no doubt, I believe, but Noggs &#x26; his Box will be shoved on punctually to Ecclef<hi rend="italic">n</hi> by the very first convenience there is at Carlisle after 6 a.m.; but that is all I can yet say. Inclosed is what the Clerk said at Euston Square here, on the Groom&#x2019;s going up to ask him; nothing farther is hitherto ascertainable. Some time in the morning of Wedn<hi rend="italic">y</hi> (8&#x2013;9 o&#x2019;clock most likely), the astonished Noggs will turn up;&#x2014;considerably exhausted, I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> think, for at the lowest, he will have had 14 or 13 hours of solitude with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> meat or drink; and no doubt, will be very glad of a cann of water, and a lock of honest corn. But he is a very healthy fellow; and I hope will take no harm.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-42-15" n="42:15"/>There will be an Address upon him, to <hi rend="italic">you</hi> at Scotsbrig, written on one of my cards (I meant to enclose <hi rend="italic">you</hi> a card of the same, had <hi rend="italic">Carlisle</hi> been the place;&#x2014;but of course at Ecclefechan, there can be no mistake): Noggs will have a saddlecloth (little white cloth <hi rend="italic">under</hi> the saddle for keeping saddle fixed), also an old saddle (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> get mended for me, it is well known to you!), d<hi rend="italic">o</hi> bridle; and he will carry anybody quietly enough,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; better sometimes for the looking to. He has an excell<hi rend="italic">t</hi> appetite for victual, especially for grass: his fore-feet at pres<hi rend="italic">t</hi> are shod with leather under each shoe; but that is totally superfluous <hi rend="italic">hence</hi>; any smith is equal to shoeing him, &#x26; his <hi rend="italic">hoofs</hi> &#x26;c are perfectly good.&#x2014;&#x2014; Please write me a word, one word to say that the Creature is come safe to hand; &#x26; that I have <hi rend="italic">done</hi> with this burble for once. At this moment my <hi rend="italic">third</hi> Bradshaw man sends ans<hi rend="italic">r</hi> (not quite indubitable to me); &#x26; I inclose it.&#x2014; Good be with you all, &#x26; a happy arrival to Noggs!&#x2014;

He cannot yet go out to graze as the weather is much too cold for him, but as soon as possible we will cut some grass for him and in the meantime he has plenty of fresh oats and excellent hay.

<p><salute>Dear Sister,</salute>&#x2014;The Horse &#x201C;Noggs&#x201D; is safe at Scotsbrig since Wedn<hi rend="italic">y</hi> morning! That is a sign his rider is soon to follow if he luck. You will receive from John, probably by this same post, a couple of Photographs; both of wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I consider to be good and one quite excell<hi rend="italic">t</hi>: along with them is some frail sketch of my indolences, dispiritments, and incipient purposes so far as these point to immediate practice. I mean, if it will at all do, to be with you next week! But the roaring tumult of the passage makes me really shudder. I have sometimes tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> of going to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> &#x26; by sea: but, on closer inspection, that also is horrible,&#x2014;more horrible. On the whole, I must and will lift anchor presently. I have been struggling to devise now some set of Books for gathering here to employ my <pb id="pg-42-18" n="42:18"/><pb id="pg-42-19" n="42:19"/>void hours while with you: but I am absolutely incapable of any vigorous resolution on such a matter at present; and the end, I suppose, is, I shall take my chance of Jack&#x2019;s Books,

 and come with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> any of my own! Oh dear!&#x2014; There is only one thing I must try to see <hi rend="italic">done</hi> before leaving: that is &#x201C;the investing&#x201D; of some money, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> the Broker

 is <hi rend="italic">halfway</hi> in, and ought to <hi rend="italic">end</hi> before I quit sight of him.

You will find me a very untowardly article I fear; far <hi rend="italic">more</hi> worn down &#x26; wrecked into final uselessness by my 12 years of toil &#x26; torment than you have any idea of!&#x2014;

<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Woolner wrote to Lady Ashburton, <date when="1865-05-13">13 May</date>: &#x201C;I took my last sitting of Carlyle yesterday and now have only to finish it up, merely 2 or 3 days work. I am profoundly thankful to have got over my task at last, for the difficulty has been so great that it has made me feel quite ill and depressed from the constant strain upon my thoughts; but I suppose it would not have been to do so great a man adequately without something like this severe expenditure. I can only say that rather than do such work as this all my life I would be a policeman or gamekeeper or lead any life that enabled me to breathe open air. &#x2F; But I am happy to say that the bust gives enthusiastic delight to most persons who have seen it, and now it is quite a different thing to what it appeared when you saw it some time back; in fact no one ought ever to see my busts done from life till finished for they are so totally different during the process from the actual finished results. Carlyle himself said yesterday that it looked &#x2018;a most impressive thing&#x2019; and he did not think it could be better. He was never sanguine as it proceeded, so that his testimony comes more welcome at the end. I think it one of the best things I have ever done, and it is certainly the most strange and mighty looking. I have now to hope that it may have the good fortune to please your ladyship and I shall care for no other opinion to a very serious extent&#x201D; (MS: NLS Acc. 11388).

 as well as ever; my only sorrow being that I have only spoonfuls of it, instead of large draughts endless in quantity fit for a thirsty soul!</p>
<p>I have, on bended knees, to crave pardon of you for two things: 1<hi rend="italic">°</hi> for my mad emphasis to you on that <hi rend="italic">Light of the world</hi>
<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Holman Hunt&#x2019;s painting <hi rend="italic">The Light of the World</hi> (<date when="1853-00-00">1853</date>).</note>
 the other night. Me to you on such a subject, it was greatly absurd &#x26; wrong;&#x2014;and alas, 2<hi rend="italic">°</hi> I yesterday saw ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, and for the first time in good light, the Picture itself; and had to say (<hi rend="italic">emphasis</hi> apart, &#x26; as a sin by itself), &#x201C;In many points, <hi rend="italic">peccavi</hi> [I have sinned], and the mild Ruskin was intrinsically right!&#x201D;
<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ruskin replied: &#x201C;It breaks my heart to get such a letter from you&#x2014;yet it is quite like you&#x2014;very monumental of you&#x2014; Only how could you think I did not understand your emphasis&#x2014;I know how you feel things&#x2014;and that what you were feeling was right, though you had not had time to see other things in the picture.&#x201D;</note>
 Beautiful painting (such a <hi rend="italic">jewelling</hi> of that cloak, such a light from the lantern &#x26;c), the &#x201C;crown&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">not</hi> intrinsically of <hi rend="italic">thorns</hi> but extrinsically only;
<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >According to Hunt, TC&#x2019;s first reaction to the painting had been highly negative; he later recalled TC speaking about it at great length, denouncing it as &#x201C;a poor misshaped presentation of the noblest, the brotherliest, and the most heroic-minded Being that ever walked God&#x2019;s earth&#x201D; and criticizing the figure of Jesus for being &#x201C;bedizened in priestly robes and a crown, and with yon jewels on his breast, and a gilt aureole round His head&#x201D; (Holman Hunt, <hi rend="italic">Pre-Raphaelitism and the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood</hi> [<date when="1905-00-00">1905</date>] 1:355).</note>
 &#x26; the Xt [Christ] by no means such a ghastly <pb id="pg-42-21" n="42:21"/>abortion as I had tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi>!
<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hunt later claimed to have used TC &#x201C;furtively&#x201D; as one of the many models for Christ&#x2019;s head in the painting (Anne Clark Amor, <hi rend="italic">William Holman Hunt: The True Pre-Raphaelite</hi> [<date when="1989-00-00">1989</date>] 255).

<salute>Dear Jessey</salute>
<p>I have just received from M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Russell the news of your poor Mother&#x2019;s death.
<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-42/lt-18650504-JWC-MR-01">JWC to Mary Russell, <date when="1865-05-04">4 May</date></ref>.</note>
 I am not surprised; She (your Mother) looked so mortally ill, when I saw her last <date when="1864-08-00">August</date>; and the accounts of her from time to time since had left no hope of ultimate recovery or release from pain in this life.</p>
<p>Good, industrious, brave-hearted Margaret! Her Children may well mourn the loss of such a Mother! But even her Children could not wish her life prolonged when it had become for herself a constant and terrible torture.</p>
<p>And you have the consolation, your Sister
<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Margaret McCaig.</note>
 and You of knowing you were kind to your Mother whilst she was with you; and that you did all you could to sooth the dear Life which it was not god&#x2019;s will to save!</p>
<p>M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Russell tells me you will return to service, now your sad duty is paid. and that you would come to London, to <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, if we can come to an agreement. <hi rend="italic">That</hi> is difficult at this distance. Face to face we could get to understand each other in a few minutes; but we may write questions and answers thro&#x2019; the Post <pb id="pg-42-22" n="42:22"/>till we are both tired; and, when all is written, there will still be much to take on trust, on both sides, and <hi rend="italic">you</hi> will have but a vague idea of the &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">Situation</hi>,&#x2019; and <hi rend="italic">I</hi> as vague an idea of your fitness for it.</p>
<p>But I will do my best to be explicit.</p>
<p>First, let me tell you <hi rend="italic">why</hi> I have turned my thoughts on <hi rend="italic">you</hi> for a Housemaid, in preference to any one here who I <hi rend="italic">could</hi> transact with face to face. It is because you are Margaret Hiddlestone&#x2019;s Daughter. <hi rend="italic">She</hi> was known in my family for a capital Servant and a well conducted woman; and I have great faith in <hi rend="italic">breed</hi>, and as great faith in upbringing. Nor does my connection with you date only as far back as your Mother and Uncle.
<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably a brother of Margaret Hiddleston; not further identified.</note>
 Your Grandfather,
<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably Margaret Hiddleston&#x2019;s father-in-law, with whom she and the girls lived in Thornhill for some time; see <ref target="volume-17/lt-18430826-TC-JWC-01"><sic>17:84</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1843-08-26">26 Aug. 1843</date></corr></ref>; not further identified.</note>
 when a Servant to my Grandfather,
<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC&#x2019;s maternal grandfather, Walter Welsh.</note>
 was very good to me when I stayed at Castlehill,
<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Castlehill, in Durisdeer parish, about 6 mi. (9.5 km.) N of Thornhill, where Walter Welsh farmed at one time; see Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> 125.</note>
 a child of eight years old. No wonder I recollect him perfectly; for it was he who first set me on the back of a pony and taught me to ride! There seems thus, an old fashioned, hereditary connection between you and myself that <hi rend="italic">ought</hi> (at least) to make <hi rend="italic">you</hi> a kinder Servant to me, and me a kinder Mistress to you, than any servant and mistress chosen from among strangers was likely to be.</p>
<p>For the rest; I remember you at M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Russell&#x2019;s&#x2014;a <hi rend="italic">bonnie</hi> young woman, who dashed about with great activity; but who made a noise with the fire irons, and skuttle, and doors, that kept me constantly jumping I dare say you have learned quietness and much else since then!</p>
<p>What my Housemaid has to do, is just I suppose what other Housemaids have to do, where there are only two Servants kept. She has to do the House work, to answer the door, to wait at table, to be the least bit of Lady&#x2019;s Maid to me, and the least bit of valet to M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle. As the house is of moderate size, and as we have no dinner-parties&#x2014;and as both M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C and myself are <hi rend="italic">orderly</hi>; the work is certainly not heavy for any one who understands her business. The Washing is all given out; only the Servants wash their own clothes&#x2014;there is a little garden to dry them in. I give my Housemaid twelve pounds a year and one pound ten for <hi rend="italic">beer money</hi> which she may drink or save&#x2014;as she likes. tea and sugar of course is given.</p>
<p>I do not know what wages you had in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> or what number of Servants you were along with. But I should not like you to come to me, if you could do better for yourself.</p>
<p>Neither should I like you to come, if you cannot make yourself happy <pb id="pg-42-23" n="42:23"/>among Strangers, and at the same time have nobody of your own to visit in London. For I dislike a gloomy discontented looking servant quite as much as an inefficient one.</p>
<p>There!&#x2014; Till I have your answer to what I have already written, I think this is enough!</p>
<p>It will be time enough to specify the when and how, when I know your mind to be in favour of coming. Take time to consider well.</p>

<salute>Dearest</salute>
<p>I wrote to Jessie by this day&#x2019;s post; and &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">splained</hi> and <hi rend="italic">spounded</hi>&#x201D;
<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. John Ross Dix, <hi rend="italic">Pulpit Portraits, or Pen-pictures of Distinguished American Divines</hi> (Boston, <date when="1854-00-00">1854</date>) 219.</note>
 to the best of my ability. It is very difficult to satisfy oneself in writing to an uneducated person. The need of using only the commonest and clearest expressions, that one may be understood, oppresses one like having to write in a foreign language that one has not quite learnt. I would rather write to the cleverest best informed person of my acquaintance than <hi rend="italic">compose</hi> a letter to a <hi rend="italic">child</hi> or a <hi rend="italic">servant maid</hi>! It is to be hoped however that Jessie will be able to extract from my letter a tolerable idea of the <hi rend="italic">work</hi> I require from my Housemaid, and the <hi rend="italic">wages</hi> I am in the habit of giving. I took pains to throw no rose-colour over the &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">Situation</hi>,&#x2019; that might lead to future disappointment. If she come, and is disappointed, the fault will be her own&#x2014;not mine.</p>
<p>I should like to have asked some questions, had there been a likelihood of getting candid answers to them. Whether she had given up making unnecessary noises? whether she had left off the practice of smashing china What sort of temper she has? Whether she is impertinent when found fault with? (for <hi rend="italic">that</hi> is a style of breeding I
<hi rend="small-caps">never</hi>
 tolerate)&#x2014; Whether she is what is called <hi rend="italic">willing</hi>? Does <hi rend="italic">the Doctor</hi>
<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. James Russell.</note>
 think she would
<hi rend="small-caps">do</hi>
?</p>
<p>For the rest it would surely be a pleasant thing to have a Scotchwoman for Housemaid and a Scotchwoman whose family&#x2019;s name has been familiar to me since I was a Child at Castle Hill! And between whose forebears and mine there has been so much connection! if only she is a good Servant as well! I mean to inclose a Photograph for you to look at, and return. It is&#x2014;M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Warren <pb id="pg-42-24" n="42:24"/><pb id="pg-42-25" n="42:25"/>my &#x201C;Cook and Housekeeper&#x201D;!!!
<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For the photograph of Eliza Warren, see <sic>opp.</sic><corr>above.</corr> It was placed in vol. 4 of JWC&#x2019;s photograph albums.</note>
 She is pleasanter looking in real life, and quite as like a gentlewoman. Her mouth in the Photograph is unnaturally <hi rend="italic">primmed</hi> over those teeth which&#x2014;she has lost!

<p>It is very extraordinary that M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle <hi rend="italic">will</hi> hang on here always declaring himself &#x201C;going in a few days,&#x201D; when <hi rend="italic">that</hi> is what he has been saying for the last six weeks! I am kept in a perpetual meditation of Flight (<hi rend="italic">his</hi> flight) and get no good of the <hi rend="italic">present</hi>&#x2014;everything having to be postponed till he is gone. Did the Doctor receive the lovely Gorillas

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I am thinking to be off ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Saturday <hi rend="italic">or</hi> Monday next: I will of course write to Jean fixing day and hour; but cannot just yet, had I even more heart than I have. A little more of <hi rend="italic">heart</hi> might easily be conceivable; and w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> indeed be very useful at this time!</p>
<p>George Cooke has been almost a fortnight &#x201C;investing&#x201D; my things; and cannot yet tell me wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> day he will have done. I signed two of his Papers this morning; but there is a third remaining, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> he &#x201C;hopes will be finished in the course of Friday&#x201D;: if it hang much farther, I will leave it to <hi rend="italic">follow</hi> me. I am not much in love with Cooke&#x2019;s invest<hi rend="italic">ts</hi>: three separate railways;&#x2014;in that <hi rend="italic">written</hi> Note (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> please <hi rend="italic">keep</hi> till after next Letter from me) you will see what kinds &#x26; quantities. Not having you to help me, I was obliged to let Cooke <hi rend="italic">schalten</hi> <pb id="pg-42-26" n="42:26"/>&#x26; <hi rend="italic">walten</hi> [do as he liked]; and tho&#x2019; I dare <hi rend="italic">say</hi> it is all quite right &#x26; well, yet in my dreary mood, the tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> of it is quite uncomfortable, you c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not think how unwelcome to me!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I have given up the notion of <hi rend="italic">bringing</hi> Books; I will mainly take chance with what I find. Don&#x2019;t send <hi rend="italic">Knox</hi>:

 I have got the whole <hi rend="italic">6</hi> volumes here; and have read of the 6th all that I at pres<hi rend="italic">t</hi> can face. By the bye, a <hi rend="italic">Giannone</hi>

 He has had a good deal of experience <pb id="pg-42-27" n="42:27"/>in Newspaper Criticism, as well as in far higher matters. It strikes me he might possibly be useful in some of the operat<hi rend="italic">ns</hi> in the <hi rend="italic">Reader</hi>,

<salute>Dear Maccall,</salute>
<p>Mr Craik&#x2019;s speculation has proved useless, so far as I can judge.
<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Lillie Craik; see <ref target="volume-41/lt-18650222-JWC-GLC-01"><sic>41:174</sic><corr>JWC to GLC, <date when="1865-02-22">22 Feb.</date></corr></ref>.</note>
 I wrote to Lewes on the matter, last week;

 his answer, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> comes today, and is here inclosed, does not seem of promising nature. I make <hi rend="italic">him</hi> no answer at all; you, if you like to try, have the power, but I think you hardly will. Froude is a much more promising party;

 who really respects y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> qualities, &#x26; will be desirous to find in you something suitable for him.</p>
<p>Mr Pollock (eldest son of the L<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Chief Baron, and a man of really worthy &#x26; kindly character and open mind), is, it appears, Editor of <hi rend="italic">The Reader</hi>, since some months:*

 I know not whether it may be worth y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> while to get into communication with him; but I incline to think it may: at all events, if you care to seek an interview with him, and explain frankly what you c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> and c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not do for him in that field, here is a Note that will introduce you.

 I do not remember <pb id="pg-42-28" n="42:28"/>any other likely person in that Depart<hi rend="italic">t</hi> of Affairs; with wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> indeed I have next to no acquaintance for many years back.</p>
<p>I am greatly tired out; and hope to be off to Scotland and silence far away in a few days. With the truest wishes, if these were good for anything,

<salute>Dear Jessie</salute>
<p>Your letter had been posted after the first post-hour; so it was not delivered here till the afternoon, too late for being answered by return of Post. And Sunday being a blank day at the Thornhill post-office, this will not reach you till Monday Morning. I am sorry you should be kept so many hours in uncertainty. But it cannot be helped on my part.</p>
<p>Having studied your letter with all the deliberation I could bring to bear on it, I am come to the conclusion that my idea of having you for housemaid was more romantic than discreet. I have no doubt whatever that you would satisfy me as a servant. The stock you come of, M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Russells recommendation of you, my own recollection of your looks&#x2014;all assures me on that head. But I have every doubt whether <hi rend="italic">you</hi> would be satisfied with the Place! And your being ever so good a servant would only make the thing more disappointing, if after I had been at the expense of bringing you to London, and had invested a great deal of hope and kind feeling in you; you should find the place &#x201C;not good enough&#x201D; for you, and too <hi rend="italic">dull</hi> to be <hi rend="italic">staid</hi> in.</p>
<p>And, from your account of the last service you were in,
<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-42/lt-18650504-JWC-MR-01">JWC to MR, <date when="1865-05-04">4 May</date></ref>.</note>
 I cannot but forsee such would be the case&#x2014;the trifle of difference in the wages wouldnt signify. Tho&#x2019; I have never given more than twelve pounds hitherto; I shouldn&#x2019;t mind increasing the wages, if the Servant were worth more. But it is the plainness <pb id="pg-42-31" n="42:31"/>and quietness of a house like ours that after having been &#x201C;very happy&#x201D; in a houseful of Servants, where your chief work was <hi rend="italic">waiting</hi>, and no friends within reach to enliven your service here;&#x2014;it is
<hi rend="small-caps">that</hi>
 which raises a difficulty which I cannot overcome for you,&#x2014;or for myself.</p>
<p>Do you see what I mean? and agree with me; that it would be too great a risk for <hi rend="italic">you</hi> to accept a place so inferior to your last in outward respects; and too great a risk for <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, to bring any one so far without a tolerable certainty of <hi rend="italic">keeping</hi> her.</p>

<p>By the foregoing Letter (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> please burn when read) you will see that Mr <pb id="pg-42-32" n="42:32"/>Chapman (as indeed becomes otherwise apparent to me) is responsible for the Nicolai Books.

 (from whom I got them, &#x26; who is a Public Man in Berlin):
<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Neuberg wrote, <date when="1865-05-19">19 May</date>: &#x201C;I have been <hi rend="italic">caged</hi>, all this week, by somewhat severe indisposition, which has left me very weak, and unable to move about, perhaps for some days yet. &#x2F; So far as I know, you sent the Nicolai Books, months ago, thro&#x2019; your Publishers, to M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Abeken. And if the parcel went by one of the <hi rend="italic">Continental Parcel Expresses</hi>, it would reach Berlin in 2 or 3 days. As soon as I am able to stir, I will make enquiries at Chapmans. I am not aware that I could do anything else. &#x2F; It is just possible that the <hi rend="italic">Geheimer Legations Rath</hi> [Privy Councillor] Abeken, deeply engaged with intricate Bismarck Diplomacies, retains the Books from D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Parthey. On that supposition, a line <hi rend="italic">from you</hi> to D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Parthey, referring him to Abeken, would be the most satisfactory step.&#x201D; TC noted at the top of Neuberg&#x2019;s letter: &#x201C;rec<hi rend="italic">d</hi>, <date when="1865-05-20">20 May 1865</date> &#x2F; T.

Above &#x201C;M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Abeken&#x201D; he wrote &#x201C;&#x2018;Herrn Abeken in Berlin&#x2019; I never knew any other Address.&#x201D; Bernhard Rudolf Abeken, a Prussian foreign office official as well as a scholar, had sent TC various books and the catalog from the Nicolai library; see <ref target="volume-42/lt-18650518-TC-JN-01">TC to JN, <date when="1865-05-18">18 May</date></ref>.

 that perhaps may account for the delay? Mr Chapman (193. Piccadilly) is charged to report to you by what Conveyance he sent them. I hope you will be so obliging as <hi rend="italic">insist</hi> upon an answer, sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> that be needful; and on the whole relieve me by finishing at once an affair so distressing to me.

<p><salute>My darling,</salute> I must put you off ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi> with a most brief word;&#x2014;in reality there is nothing to say! I did not sleep at all last night,&#x2014;till towards 6 a.m, and then after not quite half an hour, the accidental bark of a dog awoke me for good. So that it has been a <hi rend="italic">dies non</hi> [worthless day]. One of the finest mornings, hottest &#x26; quietest days I have had for long. And I am better than you c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> expect; have managed to get ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> 3 hours of sleep in the fore part of the day (after a long walk &#x26; innocently goodish breakfast); have dined on chicken-broth: and hope to do a great deal better tonight</p>
<p>Oh my Dearest, I tremble for y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Note tomorrow. How are <hi rend="italic">you</hi>? that is the anxiety with me! As for myself, upon inquiry &#x26; investigation, I believe I shall pretty soon get adjusted to the new fittings, and do quite well for some of the warm weeks here. The House

 is really good, my bedroom especially, and I seldom was in a place so quiet. The utter stillness of last night, the silence of all the day, no company but mute green fields nurseries &#x26;c, and d<hi rend="italic">o</hi> Hills, has been agreeable &#x26; surprising to me. Never mind <hi rend="italic">me</hi>; Oh that you, poor little soul, c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> get into y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> sleep again, and out of that sad toothache of the arm. Alas, alas!&#x2014;</p>

<salute>Dear Jessie</salute>
<p>I like your last letter; there is both Sense and Heart in it; and it has made me less apprehensive of the &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Situation</hi>&#x201D; proving unsuitable to you. In every human relation entered on between two people, there is always something to be <hi rend="italic">risked</hi> on both sides and something to be put up with on both sides; but as far as can be ascertained at this distance, it seems to me the risk to us two in taking one another for Mistress and Servant, is too trifling to be made a final objection; and that neither of us will find the other too <hi rend="italic">trying</hi> to mortal patience!</p>
<p>So; let it be concluded that you are to come to me:and I will send you <hi rend="italic">a shilling</hi> (in shape of postage-stamps) after the good old Scotch fashion of engagement&#x2014;unknown in London&#x2014;but which I have always kept up; to the surprise and sometimes to the <hi rend="italic">terror</hi> of the person receiving it&#x2014;who supposed it might <hi rend="italic">bind</hi> her to Heaven knew what,&#x2014;like the shilling given to enlist a Soldier!
<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;A retaining fee was &#x2026; [i]n principle &#x2026; identical with the payment of the shilling, still given in rural districts, to domestic servants on an agreement for service, and with the transfer of the queen&#x2019;s shilling given to every soldier on enlistment&#x201D; (John Cordy Jeaffreson, <hi rend="italic">A Book About Lawyers</hi> [<date when="1867-00-00">1867</date>] 101).</note>
</p>
<p>About the <hi rend="italic">when</hi>;&#x2014;I am not in any haste&#x2014;so you may pay your visits and make them as long as you like. Six weeks hence will be time enough! For our dining room needs to be painted; and until two visitors,
<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC expected a visit from Peyton and Bessy Blakiston, but they did not come; see <ref target="volume-42/lt-18650504-JWC-MR-01">JWC to MR, <date when="1865-05-04">4 May</date></ref>.</note>
 I expect,have come and gone, the painting cannot be set about. And when it <hi rend="italic">does</hi> get commenced I must fly my own house till the smell is gone!</p>
<p>It will be better that you should find <hi rend="italic">me</hi> at home when you come&#x2014;and also that you should find <hi rend="italic">something to do</hi>!</p>
<p>M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle is in Dumfries at present, and is going to travel about, &#x201C;all the summer&#x201D; he says. And while <hi rend="italic">I</hi> am here <hi rend="italic">alone</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">need</hi> any housemaiding, I can keep my present Housemaid.</p>
<p>If I could only summon courage for the long journey, I would go down to dear Holm Hill for a week or two&#x2014;and then I might fetch you back with me. But all that is very unsettled as yet&#x2014;</p>
<p>The people here engage servants only by the <hi rend="italic">month</hi>. A very bad plan I think, <pb id="pg-42-35" n="42:35"/>giving opportunity to people to fly asunder in any moment of ill humour on either side, when, had they been bound together for six months, they would have just had to make the best of it and found their account in <hi rend="italic">that</hi> in the long run&#x2014; For everlasting <hi rend="italic">changing</hi> is not good for the Soul of either Mistress or Maid I am sure!</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Our</hi> engagement then should be for the term you have been used to&#x2014;six months&#x2014; I will pay your journey&#x2014;in the first instance. But should you take it in your head to try for something <hi rend="italic">new</hi> after the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> six months, I should require you to bear <hi rend="italic">half</hi> the expense of your journey yourself.</p>
<p>I need to make this stipulation to guard against <hi rend="italic">flightiness</hi>! though I don&#x2019;t know&#x2014;have not the least reason in the world to believe <hi rend="italic">you</hi> flighty!</p>
<p>I will tell you the particulars of your journey when the time comes. And when I know my own movements better</p>
<p>I have written in a great hurry, having an appointment at some distance, and in great <hi rend="italic">pain</hi>, having got something like <hi rend="italic">toothache</hi> in my <hi rend="italic">arm</hi>! But I think I have not forgotten anything essential.</p>
<p>I will just add this if on longer reflection youfeel any hesitation about taking the place just give <hi rend="italic">the shilling</hi> to some poor person and write to me you have done so. I shall not be the least displeased with you.</p>

<p>I wonder if you will get this letter tomorrow, should it be put in the pillar

 and perhaps frightened besides! the Figure I cut on Monday morning was not encouraging! When I had cried a very little at being left by myself, I lay on the sofa till midday, not sleeping, but considering what to do for the best with this arm, which had got to a pitch! and was reducing me to the state of last year in point of sleep. And the result of my considerations was, first, a note to D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Blakiston urging him &#x26; Bessey to keep their promise of spending a couple of days with me as soon as possible; and next, in the meantime, a call at Quillers
<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Quiller&#x2019;s pharmacy, 15 Sloane Sq.</note>
 to order the old Quinine pills and a bottle of Castor <pb id="pg-42-36" n="42:36"/>oil! If I am to be kept awake all night, at any rate, by the pain; I may as well have recourse to the only prescription which did any good to the <hi rend="italic">other</hi> arm;

<p>That first day I also called at the Carpenters.

They did not provoke the war; for all the provocation &#x2026; came from the Northern Abolitionists&#x201D; (8).

 nor my <hi rend="italic">own Daily Telegraph</hi>!!</p>
<p>on my return I came upon Geraldine in Cheyne Row&#x2014;and she&#x201C;could not leave me&#x201D; till ten at night, I &#x201C;looked such a ghost&#x201D;!</p>
<p>On Tuesday I had to take M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Blunt to make calls at Fulham. And then I did the civil thing to M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Froude. Froude was in, and talked much of <hi rend="italic">your</hi> &#x201C;gentleness and tenderness&#x2014;of late&#x201D;&#x2014;and the &#x201C;much greater <hi rend="italic">patience</hi> you had in speaking of every body and every thing&#x201D;&#x2014; And I thought to myself &#x201C;if he had only <hi rend="italic">heard</hi> you, a few hours after that walk with him in which you had made such a lamb-like impression He expressed a wish to read M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Paulets Novel. And I have sent it to him.</p>
<p>A very curious, clever, &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">excessively ridiculous</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">perfectly unnecessary</hi>&#x201D; Book is M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Paulets novel!&#x2014;so far as I have read in the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> volume! And M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Paulet herself I don&#x2019;t know what to make of! For I have seen her! In my saintly Forgiveness, and beautiful Pity, I left a card for her yesterday, and she came a few hours after.

 throwing a quite different and rosier colour on the project. I will inclose the letter, and you will read it, and tell me if you think I was right in being moved thereby to engage her. For that is what I have done this forenoon in the middle of my sorrows of Castor-oil!</p>
<p>For the rest; I have no doubt you will get better and do well <hi rend="italic">there</hi>,&#x2014;for a time. Perhaps I shall take flight myself&#x2014;if my terrible nights continue too long for endurance, and this wearing pain lasts! It is pulling me down sadly and neuralgia has such an effect on the Spirits.</p>
<p>One thing I have to say that I beg you will give ear to! I have not recovered yet the shock it was to me to find after six months all those weak wretched letters I wrote you from Holmhill, &#x201C;dadding about&#x201D; in the Diningroom!&#x2014;and should you use my letters in that way again, I shall know it by instinct and not write to you at all!
<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC apparently responded by keeping JWC&#x2019;s letters of this summer in his writing case; he wrote later: &#x201C;To-day (<date when="1866-08-08">August 9, 1866</date>) I have discovered in drawers of pedestal these mournful letters of my darling in <date when="1865-00-00">1865</date>. They had lain torn in my writing-case, till their covers were all lost, and there is now no correct dating of them. I have tried to save the sequence and be as correct as I could. Here are the cardinal dates. About <date when="1865-05-20">May 20</date> I went to Dumfries, thence to the Gill; and she, here at home (courageous little soul!), began doing this room (the very beauty of which now pains and amazes me). &#x2F; <date when="1865-05-00">Beginning of May</date> her right arm took ill, as her left had done last year, and she painfully went and came between Streatham and here for some time (perhaps near a fortnight), writing with her left hand. <date when="1865-06-17">June 17</date>, she passed me (little guessing of her in the rail) and went to Holm Hill; very ill then too, still left hand; and thence in <date when="1865-07-00">July</date> to Nithbank, and after about ten or twelve days (middle or farther of <date when="1865-07-00">July</date>) went home somewhat better; got her room done, recovered her right hand, and went to Folkestone to Miss Bromley&#x2019;s [Caroline Davenport Bromley] for a few days (which proved her last visit, little as I then anticipated). Her beautiful figure and presence welcoming me home (end of <date when="1865-08-00">August</date>) will never leave my memory more.&#x2014;T.C.&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note in Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi> 3:254&#x2013;55).</note>

<p>Oh what a relief tonight by the<hi rend="italic">8 o&#x2019;clock</hi> mail! I have been quite distressed and at intervals alarmed &#x26; miserable all day. Had the Letter <hi rend="italic">not</hi> come in at 8 o&#x2019;clock, what I had hardly any hope of, I meant to write to Mrs Warren expressly for a word about you. Don&#x2019;t neglect ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi>; and understand always that if you do miss the afternoon despatch (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> finds me here next morning), the <hi rend="italic">Pillar</hi> at Cadogan Pier

But the morning is always better; and I am going to adopt the <hi rend="italic">morning</hi> too,&#x2014;were I once got steadied in my courses a little.&#x2014; You say nothing ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> the sore-<hi rend="italic">arm</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi>; only of the <hi rend="italic">remedies</hi> (quinine &#x26; castor), nothing of the <hi rend="italic">diseases</hi>: <pb id="pg-42-39" n="42:39"/>but you write so cheerfully I feel quite relieved in comparison. Don&#x2019;t bother yourself writing tomorrow; write me a word on Saturday (no <hi rend="italic">Pillar</hi> or delay for that, recollect), &#x26; I shall get it on Sunday.
<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Although there was no postal delivery in much of Scotland on Sundays (cf. <ref target="volume-42/lt-18650519-JWC-JHI-01">JWC to <sic>JH</sic><corr>JHI</corr>, [<date when="1865-05-19">19 May</date>]</ref>), in Dumfries mail apparently could be collected from the station.</note>

<p>My Sleeping arranget<hi rend="italic">s</hi> are not yet <hi rend="italic">complete</hi>, but we hope they are daily progressing: the last improve<hi rend="italic">t</hi> is that of taking off the bed-<hi rend="italic">roof</hi> (an invention due to a very cunning creature, not of these parts!)&#x2014; I am also today upon strict diet (no <hi rend="italic">dinner</hi> but curds &#x26; cream), and have had a good spell of walking, at morning &#x26; midday, with a third walk still to come. The country is beautiful, &#x26; everybody is kind: Oh I unthankful!</p>
<p>I dare say your Hiddlestonespeculation will do <hi rend="italic">as</hi> well as any other you c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have fallen upon; very <hi rend="italic">possibly</hi> better: that is all one can require for decision in such a case.

<p><salute>My Darling! My Darling!</salute> My <hi rend="italic">heart</hi> is full of things to say to you; and I cannot get them said for my
<hi rend="small-caps">arm</hi>
! Oh that arm! It keeps me miserable and incapable day after day! week after week! And the worst is, the pain of it has got to such a pitch that I cannot <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi> ten minutes together! That morning after M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C went away, I sat down and <hi rend="italic">cried</hi>! I felt so little <hi rend="italic">up to</hi> taking care of myself by myself!&#x2014; I have not however suffered from <hi rend="italic">Solitude</hi>, whatever else! People feel it is their duty to look me up when left alone. Especially George Cooke, who came and took M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C to the Railway, and got him &#x201C;a carriage all to himself,&#x201D; and saw to his luggage; and to whom M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C, at parting, &#x201C;consigned his Wife, for protection&#x201D;!! begging him &#x201C;to go and see her as often as he possibly could&#x201D; a request which George Cooke seemed to consider, like Lady Augusta&#x2019;s marriage, &#x201C;exceedingly ridiculous, and perfectly unnecessary&#x201D;!
<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lady Augusta Stanley had been woman of the bedchamber, personal secretary, and friend of Queen Victoria; furious about Lady Augusta&#x2019;s marriage to Dean Stanley, Victoria wrote to her uncle, King Leopold I (<date when="1790-00-00">1790</date>&#x2013;<date when="1865-00-00">1865</date>), king of the Belgians: &#x201C;my dear Lady Augusta, at <hi rend="italic">41</hi>, without a previous long attachment, has, most unnecessarily, decided to <hi rend="italic">marry</hi> (!!)&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Letters of Queen Victoria</hi>, 2d ser. 2 vols.

<p><salute>I think, Dear,</salute> you must have lost a day, this week&#x2014;must have&#x2014;stop!&#x2014;no!&#x2014;I should have said&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">gained</hi> a day!&#x2014; You bid me &#x201C;not bother myself writing <hi rend="italic">tomorrow</hi>; but send a word on Saturday&#x201D;&#x2014; And the tomorrow is <hi rend="italic">Saturday</hi>. This day on which I am not to &#x201C;bother myself writing&#x201D; is Saturday I posted a letter to you yesterday at the right time. That night-post is later than you think&#x2014; It was past <hi rend="italic">nine</hi> when Fanny put in the pillar the letter you received the following evening at eight.</p>
<p>My Quinine andcastor oil has quite failed of doing the good to my <hi rend="italic">right</hi> arm which they formerly did to my <hi rend="italic">left</hi>. The pain gets more severe and more continuous from day to day. Last night it kept me almost entirely awake. I often wonder that I am able to keep on foot during the day, and take my three-hours drives, and talk to the people who come to relieve my loneliness; with that arm always in pain as if a dog were gnawing and tearing at it! But <pb id="pg-42-45" n="42:45"/><hi rend="italic">anything</hi> rather than the old nervous misery which was not to be called <hi rend="italic">pain</hi> at all! <hi rend="italic">positive</hi>, <hi rend="italic">natural pain</hi> I can bear as well as most people&#x2014; But I wish D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Blakiston would come! Perhaps he can deal with a <hi rend="italic">reality</hi> like this; tho&#x2019; he could &#x201C;do nothing against <hi rend="italic">hysterical Mania</hi>&#x201D;!

 &#x2014; I got the thing he mentioned, <hi rend="italic">veratrine</hi> linament, yesterday from Quiller&#x2014;and Geraldine rubbed it in for an hour last night. But as I said; last night was the worst! Quiller also procured me an apparatus for <hi rend="italic">making</hi> potash water&#x2014;Soda water or any sort of water I like. It cost twenty five shillings but will be a great saving in the end; making for three hapence as much potash water as would cost sixteenpence, bought in bottles.</p>

<p><salute>My poor Darling,</salute>&#x2014;Y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Letters are full of saddish news to me, yet of very cheery tone; and welcome to my heart, in spite of the history they give. You are a brave little creature; that is certain; and I always persuade myself your shifty bits of industries and strength of spirit will carry you thro&#x2019;. That weary arm, those weary wasteful nights! I always <hi rend="italic">hope</hi> there will come better news soon, but one&#x2019;s disappointments continue long too. It was surely wise to send for the B[l]akistons, to try <hi rend="italic">quin</hi>ine &#x26;c: I wait with anxiety to hear what becomes of the <hi rend="italic">new</hi> Blakiston remedy, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> Quiller was to read and make ready:&#x2014;if Blakiston, by any art, can put away that bad arm, I will call him my best benefactor just now!&#x2014; One fear, however, I have: that their visit may so fuss you in y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> weak state &#x26; with a Fanny for practical lieutenant, that you may get more ill of it than good. I request you earnestly to <hi rend="italic">let it</hi>, for your own part, <hi rend="italic">very much go as it can</hi>: take Bessy
<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Bessy Blakiston.</note>
 outto drive &#x26;c, let <hi rend="italic">her</hi> do the talking, bid Mrs Warren <hi rend="italic">provide</hi> and keep Fanny to her tools:&#x2014;on the whole, I shall be glad to learn that the adventure is <hi rend="italic">done</hi> and has left no harm behind it. Oh dear, what a feckless pair of bodies we two have grown, my Jeannie! Let us be the dearer to one another the farther down we go.</p>
<p>Tomorrow I think of going to Thornhill; I write a word today to announce myself to Mrs Russell. Probably John will feel called to go with me; but that is little matter. I want to have that done, as the one bit of business lying nearest me: I have then to get some materials for clothing; and then got to go down to The Gill, &#x26; &#x201C;superintend the Tailoring,&#x201D;&#x2014;that is the figure I give it, tho&#x2019; otherwise too I want rather to be <hi rend="italic">there</hi> for the pres<hi rend="italic">t</hi> than here. My sleep, in spite of all industries, has not quite come back to me; indeed <hi rend="italic">I</hi> (miserable &#x201C;I&#x201D;) turn out to have the appointed instrument for rendering that grand &#x201C;Bedroom&#x201D; <pb id="pg-42-47" n="42:47"/>and its flagrant upholsteries, habitable to human nature: ventilat<hi rend="italic">n</hi> plus quiet &#x26; moderate darkness, all the cranks &#x26; quirks of that problem, it is poor I that have had to meet them:&#x2014;and my last goodish sleep turns out to have been much the best I have yet had. But the air &#x26;c, the silent walks, the kindness of everybody do good: I really feel rather <hi rend="italic">better</hi>; don&#x2019;t bother [your]
<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC&#x2019;s omission.</note>
 poor head ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> me at all!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Sudden news that not &#x201C;six o clock but &#x201C;on Sundays 2 o&#x2019;clock&#x201D; is the post hour of sunday:&#x2014;and that I have only 3 minutes left!</p>
<p>God bless thee Darling Jeannie; take care of thyself for my poor sake.</p>

<p>That poor little arm,&#x2014;alas, I wish it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> get a little better! Nothing seems to improve it hitherto; and the constant pain of it is sad to think of for my poor little Jeannie, heavy-laden otherwise enough. We hope Blakiston, who really has much ingenuity, may be able to contrive something. Your patience under it, your courage and spirit are worthy of all praise.</p>
<p>There has been nothing possible for Thornhill today, tho&#x2019; yesterday I had written of it to Mrs R. as a thing intended. But it has rained incessantly from before six o&#x2019;clock this morning (after a good dose yesterday too), &#x26; is still raining,&#x2014;my <hi rend="italic">third</hi> walk still to execute; after <hi rend="italic">two</hi> done under umbrellas this third (carrying the pres<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Note to Post-Office withal) will have a <hi rend="italic">mackintosh</hi> to it, for I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> endure the weighty umbrella no longer. I don&#x2019;t so much dislike the rain if a machintosh be forthcoming; I insisted honestly, these last two <hi rend="italic">goes</hi>, tho&#x2019; the thing was wearisome, two miles out to Torthorwald
<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Village and parish NE of Dumfries.</note>
 and back, the second of them, &#x26;c &#x26;c. Being the idlest of all mortals, I am bound at least to do my walks. Sleep seems improving; I most days fish out my 6 hours in pieces somewhere from the 4 and 20; I am very careful ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> diet &#x26;c; a sad funct<hi rend="italic">n</hi> but a necessary!</p>
<p>The enigmaab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> my last Note is&#x2014;in short, is that it must have been a minute too late in getting into the Post-Office her[e]:
<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC&#x2019;s omission.</note>
 so instead of getting it on Friday <hi rend="italic">afternoon</hi> you did not get it till Saturday morning! That must be it. &#x201C;Jessie&#x2019;s Letter&#x201D; (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I suppose to be y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> new Nithsdale maid&#x2019;s) is utterly extinct; gone <pb id="pg-42-48" n="42:48"/><pb id="pg-42-49" n="42:49"/>as pipe-spills,&#x2014;in sheer mistake! The &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">outer</hi> key&#x201D; of the Pigeon-hole Desk in the study is simply the <hi rend="italic">inner</hi> one itself: the lid shuts if you push it to; if you want to lock it, the same key fits <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the locks it has. Where that lies, (if not at pres<hi rend="italic">t</hi> in Goody&#x2019;s own pocket) I presume you know: old <hi rend="italic">Templand</hi> Drawers,
<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The desk originally belonged to JWC&#x2019;s father, John Welsh; see <ref target="volume-41/lt-18640914-TC-JWC-01"><sic>41:23&#x2013;24</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1864-09-14">14 Sept. 1864</date></corr></ref>.

<p>But the <hi rend="italic">time</hi> is hastening on; and I have a great deal of difficult shoeing (shoe-<hi rend="italic">horse</hi> needed for the one water-tight pair I have; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> are new,&#x2014;pity me!)&#x2014;I must close at once. Oh dear, oh dear, I wish you were sitting here,&#x2014;or rather I sitting <hi rend="italic">there</hi>; tho neither of these w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> do! My tho<hi rend="italic">ts</hi> are very sad, Dear; but they are not so miserable either; &#x26; really I feel rather <hi rend="italic">improving</hi> in spite of all. Tomorrow we ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi> intend Thornhill. I hope to be considerably better, were I at The Gill, given up to my own reflexions &#x26; moody ruminat<hi rend="italic">ns</hi> such as they are. Fry&#x2019;s Photograph of you (thanks!)

<p>I have had the Carpenter to measure the paint work of the diningroom. No use trying to make the room look decent without beginning with clean paint.</p>
<p>There are a hundred and ten square yards&#x2014;if painted with two coats of selfcoloured paint it will cost sixpounds ten. if done in wainscot with two coats of varnish, the cost will be thirteen pounds. You had best consult James Aitken

<p><salute>Oh my Darling,</salute> I am very <hi rend="italic">wae</hi> for thee, if that c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> help at all! That miserably shaking hand; the incessant misery; those &#x201C;two hours&#x201D; nightly of sleep! Things do seem going hard with us both; but we must not yield. No more of &#x201C;linament&#x201D; then, no more of quinine; they required to be tried, if only to <hi rend="italic">dismiss</hi> them reasonably; that too is a piece of work <hi rend="italic">done</hi>. Courage, courage!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be clear for the <hi rend="italic">effectual</hi> (&#xa3;13) kind of painting: but I cannot now listen to the project of any kind at all. Have the rooms thoroughly <hi rend="italic">cleaned</hi>, and do <hi rend="italic">nothing more</hi> in it till I return. &#x201C;Painting&#x201D; with its horrid smells, and multifarious noisy preliminaries &#x26; accompanim<hi rend="italic">ts</hi>, w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be enough to kill thee:&#x2014;­besides I am not arranged at all as to the <hi rend="italic">Bookcases</hi> (shiftable from the Study); wait till I come back, before going farther than cleaning. Those waterpipes, those miserable failures &#x26; human quackeries:&#x2014;my poor Darling is not at pres<hi rend="italic">t</hi> equal to striving with them; it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> distress me hourly to think they were aggravating her other intolerabilities.&#x2014; Let me not forget, however, to tell you where the Pigeon-hole Key is: if I can! Pull out the left hand upper-drawer of the old Templand Desk or Drawers; there, among old gloves &#x26;c, you will find a key with leather label &#x26; probably &#x201C;1&#x201D; marked on it; open the narrow upper (<hi rend="italic">long</hi>) drawer with that, all the keys of that Desk are in it,&#x2014;among others the key (a big one with hollow filed in the side of it) wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> opens the general <hi rend="italic">lid</hi> (or top part of Desk): lid open, you see to left hand, a small-small drawer with white paper-label on it &#x201C;keys&#x201D;; <hi rend="italic">Pigeon-hole</hi> key is <hi rend="italic">there</hi>, or I cannot tell in the least where it is! For certain, I left <hi rend="italic">it</hi> in some safe place (was almost flattering myself I had given it to <hi rend="italic">you</hi>) on taking out the &#x201C;keys&#x201D; of trunk, writing-case &#x26; carpet-bag, with the strange <hi rend="italic">key</hi> attached, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> you made Fanny or somebody <hi rend="italic">remove</hi>. This is all I can say: forgive my imperfections in that whirl of hurries I was in! And this is all the &#x201C;bus<hi rend="italic">ss</hi>,&#x201D; is it not? Let me add that you may as well call at Chapman&#x2019;s door, &#x26; make him say positively whether <hi rend="italic">now</hi> all the Books (American &#x26;c) are really &#x26; truly <hi rend="italic">off</hi>, or whether some do not yet lag forgotten, <pb id="pg-42-52" n="42:52"/>to bother me ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi> and ever ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi>! It is totally absurd; and much unlike what used to be accounted <hi rend="italic">bus</hi>ss in that house, you <hi rend="italic">may</hi> add from me: but it will do no good. Duffy&#x2019;s bracelet I am glad of for y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> dear sake: to him a fair journey; he is very polite &#x26; good, but his pres<hi rend="italic">t</hi> notions and operat<hi rend="italic">ns</hi> are rather rather
<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The second &#x201C;rather&#x201D; has been lightly struck through, possibly by TC.</note>
 wearisome than interesting to me.Here is a paltry Newspaper Scrap (Glasgow <hi rend="italic">Daily</hi> Something) wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> if the idle wretches take to quoting
<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly the <hi rend="italic">Glasgow Herald</hi>, <date when="1865-04-08">8</date> and <date when="1865-04-15">15 April</date>, which quoted extracts from the final vols. of <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi>; otherwise untraced.</note>
 w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be like a squirt of dirty water on me, did I read <hi rend="italic">them</hi> (as I don&#x2019;t): dumb Tom bro<hi rend="italic">t</hi> it in to me last night, poor soul; his dumb master (in their ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi> crack, by <hi rend="italic">fingers</hi>)
<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jean&#x2019;s son Tom, who was deaf, and his teacher (not further identified), using sign language.</note>
 had given it him him.
<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word repeated with line over it at turn of page.</note>
 Another thing I will very particularly add: namely, to <hi rend="italic">try</hi> every afternoon or ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi> to get a little wink of sleep; were it but a 1/4 hour, it is an important addition to your small stock! Do now, try <hi rend="italic">always</hi>; that has been my chief resource the majority of days since I came hither.</p>
<p>Yesterday bet<hi rend="italic">n</hi> 5 &#x26; 6 was <hi rend="italic">still</hi> raining, and the wind a perfect <hi rend="italic">roar</hi>; too <hi rend="italic">much</hi> of ventilat<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, after my weary walks the day before! I arose &#x26; shut my window (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> needs a long pole with hook) &#x26; other two in next room (<hi rend="italic">this</hi>), where I smoked; and afterw<hi rend="italic">ds</hi>, with rug <hi rend="italic">added</hi>, crept into bed ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, and almost determined to lie there all day, and <hi rend="italic">call</hi> myself sick, to be out of the bothers elswhere. Strange to say, I actually, after a long while, fell into stony sleep for two hours, <hi rend="italic">stony</hi> but actual; &#x26; did not appear to breakfast till after ten or near 11. The windy day was now dryish; but, for Thornhill, there was no train except 4 (4.<hi rend="italic">55</hi>!) p.m. &#x26; return by 8 (8.1. I determined to go; John <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to accompany: I went accordingly; and it was the <hi rend="italic">event</hi> of the day: the pleasantest I may well say since I arrived here. Very pensive, my ride up was, the ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi> brightening into <hi rend="italic">shine</hi>, old memories crowding on me. I got to Holmhill at 6; good Mrs Russell all smiles to see me, the little maid running in to name me (&#x201C;by the Picture,&#x201D; she said; viz. by the <hi rend="italic">wide-awake</hi> Photograph);

 who were come to tea; &#x26; seemed to take me as a pleas<hi rend="italic">t</hi> sauce in addit<hi rend="italic">n</hi>. We did beautifully well, for our hour and half, and my &#x201C;thanks&#x201D; to Dr &#x26; Wife did not want for sincerity. In fact they evid<hi rend="italic">tly</hi> <pb id="pg-42-53" n="42:53"/>like you very well;&#x2014;their chief anxiety seemed to be to get you <hi rend="italic">back</hi>, &#x201C;soon, this summer, whenev<hi rend="italic">r</hi> you c<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.&#x201D; Really perhaps you c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not do so well: <hi rend="italic">come</hi> if you don&#x2019;t get better; huddle up everything &#x26; come? We shall get some way contrived of paying them; &#x26; probably it is far the best you c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> do? Twenty min. to 8, the Dr drove me up to the station; and I returned with the feeling that there had been the pleasantest two hours since I quitted home.</p>
<p>Tomorrow you will perhaps get nothing, Dear; tomorrow I am fairly shifting to The Gill, where, with the aid of Noggs &#x26; total solitude, I count to recover my <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi> &#x26; other composure; tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> sad, but silent attending me in quantity.

<p><salute>My poor lame Goody,</salute>&#x2014;your Letter is indeed full of misery; and except that [of] the good Macmillans, there is nothing of hopeful or consolatory in the sad Post of Today. Blakiston&#x2014;his <hi rend="italic">absence</hi> at the moment may perhaps be something of benefit: the good Polly too awakens a kind of human remembrance in me: but the gaping gazing blockhead of a Moffat,
<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified; possibly people connected with Lady Ashburton mentioned in the enclosure (untraced) sent with <ref target="volume-42/lt-18650601-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1865-06-01">1 June</date>]</ref> (see <ref target="volume-42/lt-18650602-TC-LLA-01">TC to <sic>Lady A</sic><corr>LLA</corr>, <date when="1865-06-02">2 June</date></ref>); presumably not a reference to Margaret Graham or Mrs. Moffat whom TC met at Holmhill; see <ref target="volume-42/lt-18650531-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1865-05-31">31 May</date></ref>.</note>
 &#x26;c; all that is like rain from the East (such as wehave here today), wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> never ceases. Dr Quain too will, as usual in y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> sad case, have been either <hi rend="italic">zero</hi> or worse; of course, you had to consult him: but I hope he confined himself to confirming the resolut<hi rend="italic">n</hi> you had already formed. Sad, sad, that all these kind people can do nothing, tho&#x2019; with effort! With something of a real <hi rend="italic">hope</hi>, however, I address this to &#x201C;Streatham Lane&#x201D;:
<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Macmillans&#x2019; address.</note>
 complete change of place has generally benefited you; and in the London circle, it is impossible to do it anything like so well as thither. I need not bid you totally <hi rend="italic">avoid</hi> the &#x201C;seven-O&#x2019;clock dinners&#x201D; (never dream of such a thing!), and to beware of much talking even over tea,&#x2014;but indeed you have the art of refusing to speak far beyond me, who are often seriously damaged by it. Pity you had not a better Maid than Fanny; the stupid Pig, you will reflect she is not for long;
<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Fanny was under notice to leave; see <ref target="volume-42/lt-18650504-JWC-MR-01">JWC to MR, <date when="1865-05-04">4 May</date></ref>.</note>
 &#x2014;and the two Mrs Macm<hi rend="italic">ns</hi>

 have every appearance in your favour. Oh that this Notec<hi rend="italic">d</hi> find my poor tormented Darling to have had some better sleep when it arrives tomorrow morning! Yes, if <pb id="pg-42-55" n="42:55"/>they <hi rend="italic">can</hi> set you up a little, and assuage y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> wretchedness to the old pitch, I swear they shall not be &#x201C;distinguished visitors&#x201D; in any but the kindest sense, and my gratitude to the House &#x26; them will last with my life. Oh what a fight we have, Dear;&#x2014;nothing for us but to cleave to one another, and fight side by side! Tomorrow I can hear nothing from you (nor is it
<hi rend="small-caps">certain</hi>
 <hi rend="italic">I</hi> shall have a chance on Sunday); but do you inquire strictly ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> the &#x201C;Tooting Pillar&#x201D;
<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The postbox in Tooting.</note>
 &#x2014; Alas, no; I shall not hear ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi> at any rate, in this <hi rend="italic">Country</hi> part, till <hi rend="italic">Tuesday</hi> morn<hi rend="italic">g</hi>: you, if I <hi rend="italic">can</hi>, shall on Monday morning; and, in the interim, I will ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi> try hope.</p>
<p>You areclearly of my mind that my prospects are better here; where in fact, rain &#x26; all, I feel really relieved to be. My beginning (in the <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi> way) is ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi> baddish; but I persuade myself it is only accidental (due to bad feeding yesterday, especially I think to some very vile, perhaps <hi rend="italic">overdrawn</hi> Tea,&#x2014;or even to excess in excell<hi rend="italic">t</hi> porridge and sweet-sour;

<p><salute>Dear Lady Ashburton,</salute>&#x2014;I have been dreadfully ill off for <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi> since coming into these parts, and kept generally in such continued perturbat<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, or I w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> sooner have acknowledged y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> beautiful little Note. Truly you are are very kind to think it a &#x201C;favour&#x201D; of me to have such a Bust done of me at y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> expense! The honour of y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> having wished such a thing w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have been compensation thrice over for all my trouble. Woolner himself had infinite botheration, and exerted every industry and faculty with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> stint or grudge; but seemed to think (as do others) that he had prevailed at last.

 I am a little anxious for your own first sight of the thing; but let us hope! To myself the features seemed accurately there; but the whole was a little stony and terrible!&#x2014; You know into what a state my poor Wife is fallen ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi>; and I see (by what she incloses me today), that you do not neglect her in her sore distress. She has been continually declining, I think, since we quitted Seaforth Lodge;

 still faster, as I rather collect, since she was left alone. No Doctor&#x2019;s recipe appears to be of the least value. Today she is to go over to cert<hi rend="italic">n</hi> Macmillans who are very good people, &#x26; have a nice old-fashioned villa at Tooting, less than 4 miles from her own home, if she don&#x2019;t find it answer. But I soothe myself with hopes she will; complete change (and this is really Country too, tho&#x2019; so near Town) has often a singular efficacy in these sad cases. Poor creature, poor creature; what she suffers &#x26; suffered might melt a stone! Day before yesterday I saw the old Nithsdale Doctor
<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. James Russell; JWC stayed with Dr. James and Mary Russell <date when="1865-07-00">mid-July</date> through <date when="1864-09-00">Sept. 1864</date>; see vols. 40 and 41.</note>
 who did her so much good. If things don&#x2019;t mend, she must return hither.&#x2014;&#x2014; This is in <hi rend="italic">Annandale</hi> (within ten miles of my birthplace); yesterday I left my Dumfries Sister, and took shelter with this quieter, elder &#x26; graver one,&#x2014;in my intense need of being left altogether <hi rend="italic">silent</hi>: this is neat little Farm House, of humble pretensions; but the quietest and loneliest for me in all the world.</p>
<p>You too are ailing; &#x26; on these terms we are all getting scattered to east &#x26; west.

<salute>Dearest</salute>
<p>You are so good about writing that you deserve to be goodly done by. So I write a few lines today &#x201C;under difficulties&#x201D;

 &#x2014; Tho&#x2019; you gave me an excuse for putting off, in saying you could not hear from me till Tuesday.</p>
<p>But I must study brevity&#x2014;the soul of wit;
<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi> 2:2.</note>
 for the cost of phisicalpain at which I write is something you can hardly conceive!</p>
<p>When I got your letter telling me to hold my hand; it was too late! I had set my heart on doing one more stroke of work (<hi rend="italic">my</hi> sort of work) fitting up one more room before I died!
<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Alas, and this was it: often have I remembered that word&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note in Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi> 3:261).</note>
 And the Bookcases were already in a transition state and the carpets up&#x2014;preparatory to painting and papering! It was all very well to say &#x201C;give the room a good cleaning&#x201D; But no amount of mere <hi rend="italic">cleaning</hi> could give that room a <hi rend="italic">clean</hi> look, with that <hi rend="italic">oory dingy</hi> paint and paper&#x2014; &#x2014; To put clean paper <hi rend="italic">without</hi> fresh paint would only have made the dirtiness of the paint more flagrant&#x2014;and if the painting was not done whilst you were away, when was there a chance of doing it? I knew I couldnt <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi> in <hi rend="italic">wet paint</hi>&#x2014;but I looked to finding a bed somewhere&#x2014;and the offer of one here, came most opportunely.</p>
<p>The day before leaving home I went to Dr Quain, who did me at least the good of being extremely kind and eager to help me. He said I had &#x201C;much fever&#x201D; and gave me a Prescription for <hi rend="italic">that</hi> and two other prescriptions&#x2014;and when I returned from here I was to tell him and he would &#x201C;run over.&#x201D; I said to him that D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Blakiston had declared I had no organic disease, but only a strong <pb id="pg-42-58" n="42:58"/>predisposition to <hi rend="italic">gout</hi>! &#x201C;Quite right, he said, that is the fact.&#x201D; &#x201C;Then, I asked, perhaps this affair in my arm, so much more painful than what I had in the left arm, is <hi rend="italic">Gout</hi>. &#x201C;I have not the least doubt that is!!&#x201D; was his answer. Pleasant!</p>
<p>Well! I came here about five yesterday and the good simple people welcomed me most honestly&#x2014;and M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Macmillan sang Scotch Songs
<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alexander Macmillan was b. in Irvine, Ayrshire, and his family was from Arran, island in the Firth of Clyde.</note>
 which would have charmed you all the evening. The Governess
<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified further.</note>
 playing an accompaniment.</p>
<p>At eleven I retired to my beautiful bedroom. The largest prettiest freshest bedroom I ever was put to sleep in! And then they left me to the society of a watch dog chained under my window!!! <hi rend="italic">It</hi> barked and growled and howled in the maddest manner till they set it loose about seven in the morning. Of course I never closed my eyes for one minute all the night!&#x2014;and I got up this morning a sadder and a wiser woman!

Samuel Taylor Coleridge (<date when="1772-00-00">1772</date>&#x2013;<date when="1834-00-00">1834</date>; <ref target="volume-42/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/5888"> <hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi> </ref>), &#x201C;Rime of the Ancient Mariner&#x201D; (<date when="1798-00-00">1798</date>).</note>
 &#x2014; How to get away without hurting feelings? I was the wretchedest of women till I got it settled <hi rend="italic">softly</hi>, that when the carriage comes for me today to take me home for an inspection of the <hi rend="italic">Work</hi> it should <hi rend="italic">not</hi> bring me back but leave me to sleep or wake in my own quiet bed&#x2014; And come out tomorrow to spend the day, and sleep <hi rend="italic">here</hi> or <hi rend="italic">there</hi> after, as I liked best&#x2014;the dog to be &#x201C;removed to a greater distance&#x201D;&#x2014; So address to Cheyne Row&#x2014;</p>
<p>D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Quain said I must go as soon as possible to Scotland&#x2014;&#x201C;as it had agreed so well with me last year.&#x201D; I said, I shuddered at the length of journey. He reminded me I had &#x201C;made it with impunity last year when I was weaker than now&#x2014;&#x201D;

<p><salute>Oh my Dearest,</salute> what a time of sleeplessness &#x26; tribulation you have; Letter after Letter, hope after hope, and no improve<hi rend="italic">t</hi> hitherto! In my life I have heard nothing madder than that of putting a poor sick nervous creature, after every attention to her, into the glorious bedroom,&#x2014;with a watchdog to bark all night under her window! I have myself heard that dog as I passed the place; and shuddered at the tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> of proximity to <hi rend="italic">it</hi>, even in the Garden of Eden. Of course there was nothing for you but to cut and run: nevertheless c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not you contrive politely to make it <hi rend="italic">triable</hi> once ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi>; only hint that the watchdog must be utterly <hi rend="italic">locked</hi> out of hearing; that the first hint of it ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi> w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> spoil y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> sleep for a week? They are infinitely desirous, I doubt not, to do you good; the <hi rend="italic">dog</hi> lodged in their own kitchen, w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not be much of a sacrifice. By no means try it, with<hi rend="italic">t annihilation</hi> of the dog &#x26; its noises. But I had set my heart on y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> getting some real relief there; and am much disappointed at the issue hitherto had. Oh do try something: it is heartbreaking to think of you lying nightly in miserable pain, added to misery of sleeplessness, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is itself so intolerable.&#x2014;&#x2014; For the rest, I continue to vote: Give up the painting. <hi rend="italic">Unless</hi> you can manage at MacMillan&#x2019;s, <hi rend="italic">it</hi> is not once to be tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> of. <hi rend="italic">Clean</hi> the rooms really (or Mrs Warren will); let them <hi rend="italic">look</hi> as dirty as they must, I care little ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> their looks; also shift the Book-cases (if too far gone, for drawing back), I will <hi rend="italic">see</hi> how the adjust<hi rend="italic">t</hi> ans<hi rend="italic">rs</hi>: by Heaven&#x2019;s blessing, there will occur another fortnight when we are both away (at Melchet or somewhere) and yet able to supervise more or less. In short, you cannot do it, Dear; and must hold in for the pres<hi rend="italic">t</hi>. You <hi rend="italic">found</hi> the Desk-<hi rend="italic">key</hi>, I conclude? All right and conclude y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> bits of operations on that side.</p>
<p>Today I was much surprised and muchdelighted by the sight of y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Note, quite unexpected,&#x2014;&#x26; in a <hi rend="italic">hand</hi> perfectly firm;

 wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> was all I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> learn of it for some time; being just on the <hi rend="italic">run</hi> out after <hi rend="italic">bath</hi>, at too late an hour, cold, into the stormy breezes also cold &#x26; threatening to be rainy. Alas, that of the <pb id="pg-42-61" n="42:61"/>steady <hi rend="italic">hand</hi> (added to the easy-cheery spirit) was all the good news it held: Macm<hi rend="italic">n</hi> grown into a watchdog. Quain full of windy hope, and Blakiston &#x26; his &#x201C;gout&#x201D; perfectly true! As you say, it must come to Holmhill again; &#x26; probably the sooner the better. As to railway, you will really have no difficulty: for a bribe of a 2 sh<hi rend="italic">gs</hi>, I got the whole huge carriage to myself (except one short stage somewhere ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Preston); I w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> meet you at Carlisle (5&#xBD; p.m.), conduct you to Dumfries (7&#xBD; p.m.), where the Russell brougham w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> wait; &#x26; so, before 10 o&#x2019;clock, you w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be in y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> nice little Lodging (new <hi rend="italic">ventilator</hi> in it, the D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> shewed me) &#x26; all safe,&#x2014;instead of frousy Fanny the new little Huddlestone

<p>Yesterday I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> <hi rend="italic">not</hi> get a Letter despatched, or not with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> a degree of trouble &#x26; uncertainty wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> after weighing, I found to be quite out of proportion; &#x26; so at length candidly gave it up.

<p>I got on Noggs when John went, meaning to accompany him to the Station, &#x26; then go on an extensive canter to and fro. Noggs knew me very well; &#x26; the instant he had me on his back, testified such exuberance of joy, as did not indeed disturb me who knew him, but as threw the bystanders into momentary terror; poor good Noggs!

<salute>Dearest</salute>
<p>It is rather hard to know a letter from you will be lying at Cheyne Row at the moment, and I not to get hold of it till M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Silvester
<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Silvester, livery stable owner, who drove JWC&#x2019;s carriage.</note>
 comes at two oclock. <pb id="pg-42-64" n="42:64"/>It is also rather hard to think what blessings you will have bestowed on me this morning when your magazines and Papers were delivered; all charged double!
<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Items sent unstamped were charged double on receipt. The Carlyles took several newspapers and magazines among which were <hi rend="italic">British Quarterly</hi> (see <ref target="volume-29/lt-18541107-TC-JF-01"><sic>29:192</sic><corr>TC to JF, <date when="1854-11-07">7 Nov. 1854</date></corr></ref>), the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> (see <ref target="volume-26/lt-18511018-TC-JAC-01"><sic>26:212</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1851-10-18">18 Oct. 1851</date></corr></ref>), <hi rend="italic">Public Opinion</hi> (see <ref target="volume-40/lt-18640521-TC-HL-01"><sic>40:103</sic><corr>TC to HL, [<date when="1864-05-21">21 May 1864</date>]</corr></ref>), and <hi rend="italic">Punch</hi>; the latter had been sent to Betty Braid&#x2019;s invalid son, George, until his death in <date when="1865-02-00">Feb.</date></note>
 It was not entirely <hi rend="italic">my</hi> fault; I made them up on the Sunday morning before I left for Tooting, having had some sleep, more or less refreshing, in my own quiet Bed, and therewith gained courage to try again my beautiful Bedroom here, under the new condition of that Dog shut up in a distant Wash House. I had no stamps with me, and on <hi rend="italic">Sunday</hi> could not get any. So I laid the packets all together in a corner to have the stamps put on them when I should come in next day to inspect my painters, if indeed another wholly sleepless did not drive me home for good. At night it flashed on me that Mrs Warren or Fanny seeing the heap might take them to the post office before I came. And so I got M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Macmillan to write a note to M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Warren bidding her <hi rend="italic">not</hi>
<hi rend="small-caps">to</hi>
. But when the note reached Cheyne Row, the things had been already all posted by M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Warren when she had gone out at <hi rend="italic">seven</hi> of the morning to fetch the sweeps!!!
<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Either chimney sweeps or sweeping brushes.</note>
</p>
<p>I must &#x201C;hasten to the catastrophe.&#x201D;

 I would not for anybody&#x2019;s sake but yours, give myself such horrid pain as <hi rend="italic">writing</hi> at present causes me. If by letting alone writing I could only escape the pain! but it is continual, and poig­nant even when I do nothing.</p>
<p>The two last nights, nothing <hi rend="italic">Outward has</hi> disturbed me&#x2014; A better sleeping place could not be desired now the dog is removed if only one could take advantage of its freshness and its silence. But the wretched arm awakes me like an evil conscience! These two last nights however I have made out some <hi rend="italic">three</hi> hours by help of a stiff tumbler of very good whisky toddy which M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Macmillan mixes for me and is given me after I get into bed. They are good, kind, simple people, and would take any trouble to relieve me&#x2014; I will inclose a plan of treatment from D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Blakiston but must <hi rend="italic">beg</hi> you <hi rend="italic">not to lose it</hi>, but to <hi rend="italic">send it back in the next letter</hi>! I may need it by and by&#x2014;but just yet, it would be unfair to D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Quain to interrupt <hi rend="italic">his</hi> prescriptions with a new and violent remedy&#x2014;</p>
<p>I also inclose two Vignettes of me,

<p>I am delighted, my poor Dear, to understand you to be again at Tooting, and to hope you are getting a little sleep there, now that your howling foe is quashed, and safe in his wash-house! There c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not be a nearer approach to <hi rend="italic">Country</hi>, had you gone 20 miles from London; and one of the surest alleviations always has been that of altogether changing place and ways. I only wish you had more completely <hi rend="italic">done</hi> with <place>Chelsea</place> &#x26; its cares &#x26; circ<hi rend="italic">s</hi> in the interim: but you seem to be going on with your &#x201C;painting&#x201D; there just the same,&#x2014;you disobed<hi rend="italic">t</hi> little Cutty! And you jeer at me, and call me some name (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I cannot quite read, but wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> seems abundantly bad, and unworthy of the dignity of genius)

 because I did not detect Geraldine&#x2019;s handwriting, but took poor Mary&#x2019;s glad word for it, and laid it by on the mantel-piece as a blessed memorial,&#x2014;till this morning, when indeed it plainly enough appeared to be G.&#x2019;s, and I burnt it. Oh you&#x2014;!&#x2014; But if you sleep a little, I will forgive you everything.</p>
<p>Last night, by great precautions, and by a narrow miss, I recovered my own sleep in some measure; and am no longer in the hag-ridden condit<hi rend="italic">n</hi> of yesterday: c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> I once fairly get assured reasonably of my 6 hours sleep (alas, poor soul, and you have to be doing with 3! as I often recollect while watching); <pb id="pg-42-66" n="42:66"/>or if, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is the same thing, I come <hi rend="italic">fitted</hi> into my new style of diet, and sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> get a great benefit here. I have continually (&#x26; silently) the kindest treat<hi rend="italic">t</hi> from every soul ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> me; the silence of the roads, the fields, the rides &#x26; walks, is perfectly divine.

<salute>Dearest</salute>
<p>I wonder that weare not brought up to use our two hands equally, the same as our two eyes and two ears, there is no natural impossibility, and &#x201C;it would be a great advantage&#x201D;

 anyhow I must learn to write with my left hand legibly at least, the right having entirely struck work; for it is not now a question of pain merely; but of utter powerlessness as well. I foresaw that it would come to <hi rend="italic">that</hi>! so I am not shocked as you may fancy, I dare say a quarter of an hour&#x2019;s practise two or three times a day for a week or so, will deliver me from the absurd necessity of having to call in the assistance of the neighbourhood to communicate my bits of news to you; not to say that dictation is only a degree less awkward than left handed penmanship, having never tried it before in my life</p>
<p>You perceive that I amstill here and you will infer from that, that I find it good to be here but as it is M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Macmillan who is writing for me, it would be too barefaced to give any glowing description of either the pleasantness of the place or the kindness of the people; I shall only say what you will be glad to hear that I am getting into the way of sleeping for <hi rend="italic">snatches</hi>, <hi rend="italic">after</hi> three o&#x2019;clock, <pb id="pg-42-70" n="42:70"/>which I attribute, under Providence, to a wine glassful of essence of beef, which is placed by my bed side every night and which I take when I awake at three with the feeling of doing it for good; it is simply the juice of beef without any water at all. As for the pain I am sorry I cannot compliment myself on its being in the least better, it has been and continues more severe than I ever had it before, it wears me to fiddlestrings and takes all &#x201C;good joy&#x201D;

<p><salute>Thanks, Dearest,</salute> for the struggle you have made to get me a word of authentic tidings sent. I can read perfectly your poor little left-hand &#x201C;Lessons,&#x201D;
<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See 71.</note>
 &#x26; really wonder atthe progress you have made. Don&#x2019;t be &#x201C;impious,&#x201D; however! Y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> poor right hand will be restored to you, please God; and we may depend upon it, neither the coming nor the going in such cases goes by the rule caprice. Alas, what a time have we all got into! I finished, last night, the dullish thick Book (longwinded tho&#x2019; intellig<hi rend="italic">t</hi>) of <hi rend="italic">Lyell</hi>; and the tendency of it, very impotent, was upon the whole to prove that we are much the same as Apes; that Adam was probably no other than a fortunate Ourang-Outang who <hi rend="italic">succeeded</hi> in rising in the world.
<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lyell&#x2019;s argument in <hi rend="italic">The Geological Evidence of the Antiquity of Man</hi> (see <ref target="volume-42/lt-18650605-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1865-06-05">5 June</date></ref>) was more cautious than TC indicated. He was primarily interested in geological evidence for the antiquity of the human race, but in the final five chapters of the book, he discussed the Darwinian controversy &#x201C;as to the degree of resemblance between the brain of man and that of apes.&#x201D; He concluded: &#x201C;Separated as a group of ordinal value, placed at the same distance from the ape as the latter from the carnivore, Man is at once too near and too distant from the higher mammalia;&#x2014;too near if we take into account those elevated faculties, which, raising Man above all other organized beings, accord to him not only the first, but a separate place in the creation,&#x2014;too far if we merely consider the organic affinities which unite him with the quadrumana; with the apes especially, which, in a purely physical point of view, approach Man more nearly than they do the lemurs&#x201D; (475).</note>
 May the Lord confound all such dreary insolences of loquacious Blockheadism entitling itself &#x201C;Science&#x201D;! <hi rend="italic">Science</hi>, or the understanding of things worth <hi rend="italic">knowing</hi>, was once a far diff<hi rend="italic">t</hi> matter from this melancholy maundering, &#x26; idle poking into the Unknowable (an[d]
<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note>
 apparently the <hi rend="italic">not</hi> worth knowing)!&#x2014; But to return.</p>
<p>In spite of the <hi rend="italic">swelling</hi>, there is no abate<hi rend="italic">t</hi> of the pain, it seems, alas, my hopes go faster than the facts;&#x2014;but I still keep assuring myself that this of <hi rend="italic">swelling</hi> is a preliminary to good. And you do sleep a little, if only by snatches: <pb id="pg-42-73" n="42:73"/>thank Mrs Macm<hi rend="italic">n</hi> for me; &#x26; let us both be thankful to Heaven. I will address to Chelsea after this: tomorrow it will be needless; nor is Sunday (y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Monday) a day to be depended on, but I will neglect no chance that may rise.</p>
<p>I am again richer by 7 hours of (piecemeal) sleep, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is an unspeakable favour to me! I <hi rend="italic">tried</hi> on porridge ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi> last night, having really no other resource; went to bed trembling,&#x2014;and by steadiness &#x26; good luck did fall asleep. I dare not yet trust in a continuance, so <hi rend="italic">kranky</hi> is all my footing and environ<hi rend="italic">t</hi> here; but if I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> steadily conquer sleep, <hi rend="italic">it</hi> too w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> surely &#x201C;be a great advantage&#x201D; to me. On the whole I have been sorrowfully bothered with that fundamental item ever since leaving Chelsea; &#x26; that was a point I had no doubt ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi>, little knowing what was ahead. Things are sombre &#x26; sad to a degree, when sleep goes, &#x26; this &#x201C;Hades,&#x201D; in such case, c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not call itself an Elysium by any means! The Dumfries people

 do not come near me; out of respect to my solitude, I do know; for I am in the tacit obligat<hi rend="italic">n</hi> to give them permission &#x26; notice when I want visit.</p>
<p>Yesternight, <hi rend="italic">before</hi> tea, a <hi rend="italic">gurly</hi> windy ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi> with Sun gone veiled, I took Noggs a canter of 10 or 12 miles: ride swift mostly, and on roads all my own (over the place where your crazy vehicle came in two)

<p><salute>My Darling,</salute>&#x2014;Alas, that poor right-hand, lamed swollen, &#x26; full of pain! This morning, after a blink of bright hope, I had to take my bit of disappoint<hi rend="italic">t</hi>. Poor Mary, in her silent way, had despatched an Express to Annan this morning, to be in attendance at the <hi rend="italic">half-hour</hi> there is of Post-Office (from 9 to 9&#xBD; a.m., letters given out, if you are <hi rend="italic">there then</hi>): ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> 11, breakfast done, Mary came out with a small Letter, accordingly; in Geraldine&#x2019;s hand,&#x2014;and with the Bramah Pencil duly in it, &#x26; the <hi rend="italic">Harrow-Speeches</hi> bus<hi rend="italic">ss</hi>,
<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Harrow &#x201C;Speech Day&#x201D; was an annual event at which extracts from the classics and modern literature were declaimed, encouraging the pupils in public-speaking skills; in <date when="1865-00-00">1865</date> it was to be on <date when="1865-07-06">6 July</date>; the &#x201C;bus<hi rend="italic">ss</hi>&#x201D; is unexplained; the &#x201C;Speech Bill&#x201D; for Harrow, <date when="1865-00-00">1865</date>, listed various Greek and Latin trans., various prizes, the speech of Sir Robert Peel (<date when="1788-00-00">1788</date>&#x2013;<date when="1850-00-00">1850</date>; <ref target="volume-42/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/21764"> <hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi> </ref>) on resigning office, <date when="1846-06-00">June 1846</date>, and the speech of William Pitt (<date when="1759-00-00">1759</date>&#x2013;<date when="1806-00-00">1806</date>; <ref target="volume-42/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/22338"> <hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi> </ref>) against the slave trade, <date when="1792-04-00">April 1792</date>. The <date when="1862-00-00">1862</date> speeches had been focused on the French Revolution; possibly TC&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">The French Revolution</hi> was used then.</note>
 &#x26; nothing more whatever. <pb id="pg-42-75" n="42:75"/>Not a stroke even, much less a word. But I deserved it all; c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> understand sadly that it meant for me, &#x201C;No change, especially none <hi rend="italic">for the better</hi>!&#x201D; And so it has to stand till Tuesday morning at soonest.</p>
<p>I know not that I can do <hi rend="italic">you</hi> the least good by writing this word; but, if I ride to Annan before 4 p.m., it will arrive before you quit Tooting, as a poor useless salutation from me; and it will do my own heart good to take the little trouble tho&#x2019; fruitless. I am out of my Sleep-quandaries ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, or nearly so; had a fine share of not <hi rend="italic">much</hi>-disunited sleep last night,&#x2014;w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> my poor worn wearied Goody c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have had the half of it!&#x2014;and am so pointed and attentive to my eatings, to my ridings, walkings and procedures, I expect now really to begin reaping profit; &#x26; indeed seem to feel that I am already on a clearer way after my late complicated crisis. My rides are very strange, in the mood so foreign as mine.

<salute>Dearest</salute>
<p>I will write before returning home. There will be neither peace nor time <hi rend="italic">there</hi>. Thanks! I never needed more to be <hi rend="italic">made</hi> of! I must tell you about my hand. You think the <hi rend="italic">swelling</hi> more important than it is. The two middle fingers were much as now for some weeks before you left; but with the thumb and forefinger I could still do much; <hi rend="italic">now</hi> the forefinger is as powerless and pained as the other two&#x2014;that is all the difference. But a conclusive one for one can do nothing <hi rend="italic">with only</hi> a thumb! I could sometimes sit down and cry. The pain&#x2014;the chief pain&#x2014;that which wakes me from my sleep is in the shoulder and forearm. Even hopeful D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Quain does not tell me I shall soon get back my hand&#x2014;only tells me blandly I must learn to write with my left, and it was he who told me to take a black lead pencil.
<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;In pencil, with the left hand, and already well done.&#x2014;T.C.&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s headnote in Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi> 3:265).</note>
 I went to him on Friday by appointmentwhen I had finished the antifebrile powders. I think they <hi rend="italic">have</hi> quietened me. He gave me a bumper of Champagne was kind as kind could be. Desired me to try the quinine once more. Said D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Blakiston&#x2019;s prescription was an &#x201C;admirable suggestion&#x201D; and well worth my trying but as it would cause me a good deal of pain and feverishness I had better wait &#x201C;till after my journey to Scotland&#x201D; He does me real good by his <hi rend="italic">kindness</hi>.</p>
<p>My visit here has been as great success so far as depended on my Host and Hostesses and I am certainly better in my <hi rend="italic">general health</hi> for all the nourishing things they have put into me by day and by night. It is a place where <hi rend="italic">you</hi> could fly to in a bilious crisis&#x2014;quiet as Heaven when the dog is in the Wash House.</p>
<p>Bellona (my Mare) has given me a fine fright You would never believe she <pb id="pg-42-77" n="42:77"/>was not safe to <hi rend="italic">be left</hi> It has been the nearest miss of herself and the carriage all smashed to pieces! <hi rend="italic">She</hi> has escaped miraculously without a scratch. The <hi rend="italic">carriage</hi> has not been so fortunate. I am not up to writing the narrative today</p>

	<p><salute>Thanks, Dearest!</salute> The old deaf Postman
<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly William Rule (b. ca. <date when="1801-00-00">1801</date>), listed in <date when="1861-00-00">1861</date> census as &#x201C;Post office Runner,&#x201D; although he was around six years younger than TC.</note>
 (deaf as a doornail, but very <hi rend="italic">gleg</hi> met me this morning with y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> expected message,&#x2014;right welcome, in the bonny summer morning, to one otherwise so sick of heart.

I am very thankful for it;&#x2014;all written with the <hi rend="italic">left hand</hi> too, poor little soul! It is in itself touching; wonderful too how well you have already learned to do it: I can read every word. The Streatham visit has really been of use; Quain &#x26; it have rather &#x201C;quietened&#x201D; matters, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> surely is import<hi rend="italic">t</hi>. Courage; do not <hi rend="italic">cry</hi> over your poor little right hand; it will come back to us, all the dearer for its absence; meanwhile how shiftily you at once contrive to help us with the left! On the whole, all seems to point towards Holmhill; and I own I wish I saw you <hi rend="italic">there</hi>. If you find it likely to be useful, why not come off at once? There is in real truth, so far as I am concerned, <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> to detain you in that broiling noise, and dirty atmosphere of paint, one day longer. I have no care whatever ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> how I may find my sitting room in Chelsea when I return.

I tremble to think; Had <hi rend="italic">you</hi> been in the carriage,&#x2014;as I trust you were not!

<p>I am going on better here; getting my sleep back, &#x26; I suppose doing myself <pb id="pg-42-78" n="42:78"/>good in respect of health, tho&#x2019; still in a rather tremulous state of nerves; and altogether sombre, sad &#x26; vacant as I seldom was in my life before. The <hi rend="italic">writing</hi>-apparatus, too,&#x2014;you may see how detestable, with a hand given to shake:&#x2014;alas, what is &#x201C;shaking,&#x201D; to other states we know of; if my poor Jeannie&#x2019;s hand only <hi rend="italic">shook</hi>!&#x2014; The truth is, I am solutary as I wished to be; and do not object to the gloom &#x26; dispirit<hi rend="italic">t</hi> going down to the utterly <hi rend="italic">dark</hi>; if they like to rest there, let them. The world has become, in many parts, hideous to me; its highest heights no longer looks very high to me: only my poor heart, strange to say, is not very much blunted by all it has got; in the depths of silent sadness, I feel as if there were still as much love in me (all gone to potential <hi rend="italic">tears</hi>) as there ever was at my earliest day. But silence as to all that. I go riding, walking &#x26;c at a great and faithful rate; am very careful of my <hi rend="italic">diet</hi>: am most lovingly served, and excell<hi rend="italic">tly well let alone</hi>: what more <hi rend="italic">c</hi>d I wish, in my pres<hi rend="italic">t</hi> state of mind &#x26; body? Truly nothing.</p>
<p>On Saturday John &#x26; Jean came suddenly out, having heard nothing from me:&#x2014;I <hi rend="italic">must</hi> write today, having put it off yesterday; therefore despatch here! On sunday Jamie of Scotsbrig came, a second time; bringing over &#x201C;Catherine&#x201D;

A man of natural sincerity, &#x26; sense, with touches of real humour in him. He talked even ab<hi rend="italic">t Fr</hi>k (the <hi rend="italic">Great</hi>) in a way to please me for a few moments; nobody I have spoken to had as much that looked <hi rend="italic">worthy &#x26; true</hi> to say ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> the matter yet. It was he and I, <hi rend="italic">in a Gig</hi> (not I by myself on horseback), that went to Annan with y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Letter that afternoon: the air, temperate, greyish &#x26; quiet, the roads nearly altogether vacant, not so much as a turnpike to check one&#x2019;s noble rage.&#x2014; I am still (languidly) in the enterprize of <hi rend="italic">clothes</hi>; decided to make a minimum of it serve. Noggs &#x26; I have been twice on the sands; a most windy, <hi rend="italic">dustless</hi> element, smooth as paper: even the rugged Noggs seemed kindled by it, &#x26; made some pretty galloping. I have plenty of Books; hadn&#x2019;t I better have been at them than wearying you with all this?

<salute>Dear Emerson,</salute>
<p>Tho&#x2019; my hand is shaking (as you sadly notice), I determine to write you a little Note today. What a severance there has been these many sad years past!&#x2014; In the first days of February I ended my weary Book; a totally worn-out man, got to shore ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi> after, far the ugliest sea he had ever swum in. In <date when="1865-03-00">April</date> or the end of <date when="1865-03-00">March</date>, when the Book was published, I duly handed out a Copy for Concord &#x26; you: it was to be sent by Mail; but, as my Publisher (a <hi rend="italic">new</hi> Chapman, very unlike the <hi rend="italic">old</hi>),
<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Frederic Chapman; TC previously dealt with Frederic&#x2019;s uncle, Edward Chapman.</note>
 disclosed to me lately an incredible negligence in such points, it is quite possible the dog may <hi rend="italic">not</hi>, for a long while, have put it in the Post-Office (tho&#x2019; he faithfully charged me the postage of it, and was paid), and that the poor Waif may never yet have reached you! Patience; it will come soon enough,&#x2014;there are two thick Volumes, &#x26; they will stand you a great deal of reading, stiff, rather than &#x201C;light.&#x201D;
<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson replied, <date when="1866-01-07">7 Jan. 1866</date>: &#x201C;your letter deeply interested me, with the account of your rest so well-earned. You had fought your great battle, &#x26; might roll in the grass, or ride your pony, or shout to the Cumberland or Scottish echoes, with largest leave of men &#x26; gods. &#x2026; I read [<hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi>] in the bright days of our new peace. &#x2026; I found in the book no trace of age, which your letter so impressively claimed. In the book, the hand does not shake, the mind is ubiquitous. The treatment is so spontaneous, selfrespecting defiant&#x2014;liberties with your hero, as if he were your client, or your son, &#x26; you were proud of him, &#x26; yet can check &#x26; chide him, &#x26; even put him in the corner when he is not a good boy,&#x2014;freedom with kings, &#x26; reputations, &#x26; nations, yes, &#x26; with principles too&#x2014;that each reader, I suppose, feels complimented by the confidences with which he is honored by this free-tongued masterful Hermes&#x201D; (Slater, <hi rend="italic">CEC</hi> 546).</note>
</p>
<p>Since February last, I have been sauntering ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi>, inDevonshire, in Chelsea, hither, thither; <hi rend="italic">idle</hi> as a dry bone,&#x2014;in fact, a creature sinking into deeper &#x26; deeper <hi rend="italic">collapse</hi>, after 12 years of such mulish pulling &#x26; pushing; creature now good for nothing seemingly, and much indifferent to being so in permanence, if that be the arrang<hi rend="italic">t</hi> come upon by the Powers that made us. Some three or four weeks ago, I came rolling down hither, into this old nook of my Birthland, to see poor old Anna[n]dale
<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted by TC.</note>
 ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi> with eyes, and the poor remnants of kindred &#x26; loved ones still left me there: I was not at first very lucky (lost <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi> &#x26;c); but am now doing better, pretty much got adjusted to my new element, new <pb id="pg-42-80" n="42:80"/><pb id="pg-42-81" n="42:81"/><pb id="pg-42-82" n="42:82"/>to me since ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> six years past,&#x2014;the longest absence I ever had from it before.

Y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> friend Conway,
<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Moncure Conway.</note>
 who is a boundless admirer of y<hi rend="italic">rs</hi>, used to come our way regularly now &#x26; then; and we always liked him well. A man of most gentlemanly, ingenious ways; turn of tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> always loyal &#x26; manly, tho&#x2019; tending to be rather <hi rend="italic">winged</hi> than solidly ambulatory. He talked of coming to Scotland too; but it seems uncert<hi rend="italic">n</hi> whether we shall meet. He is clearly rather a fav<hi rend="italic">te</hi> among the London people,&#x2014;&#x26; tries to explain America to them; I know not if with any success.
<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Conway, the abolitionist son of a Virginian slaveholder, was in a good position to argue against slavery; he came to Britain to &#x201C;represent the moral and political situation as viewed by American antislavery people&#x201D; (Conway, <hi rend="italic">Autobiography</hi> 389).</note>

 (if you know Trollope

<note n="16" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The lecture, &#x201C;American Nationality,&#x201D; was delivered by Emerson in Boston, <date when="1861-11-12">12 Nov. 1861</date> (Slater, <hi rend="italic">CEC</hi> 545); Trollope reported attending the lecture in <hi rend="italic">North America</hi> (<date when="1862-00-00">1862</date>), and quoted Emerson: &#x201C;&#x2018;Your American eagle,&#x2019; he said, &#x2018;is very well. Protect it here and abroad. But beware of the American peacock&#x2019;&#x201D; (1:344). He concluded his comments on the lecture: &#x201C;On the whole the lecture was excellent, and that little advice about the peacock was in itself worth an hour&#x2019;s attention&#x201D; (1:345).</note>
 &#x2014;at wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> the audience had exploded into laughter. Very good.&#x2014; Adieu, old Friend.</p>

<p>It grieves me, poor Dear, to hear of y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">ourie</hi> bedroom,&#x201D; of y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> bad sleeping arrang<hi rend="italic">ts</hi>:&#x2014;all due to that villainous Paint-Operation; out of wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I shall never get as much pleasure, as it now, and all along since I first heard of it, gives me pain. Is not my room clear? Alas, no; there will be a proport<hi rend="italic">n</hi> of <hi rend="italic">paint</hi> in that too,&#x2014;sorrow on it! The front room ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi> is too noisy. <hi rend="italic">Cannot</hi>, by accurate shutting of the paint <hi rend="italic">doors</hi> everywhere, y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> own room be made habitable? I long to hear of you in some place where you can fairly <hi rend="italic">try</hi> to sleep. You don&#x2019;t &#x201C;lie awake the <hi rend="italic">whole</hi> night&#x201D;;&#x2014;woe&#x2019;s me, that is a poor maximum! But what is to be done or tried? Except in y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> own ingenuity, and especially the wretched Freure&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">despatch</hi>, there will no light dawn on me.&#x2014;&#x2014; This is Friday; we will write no more (from <hi rend="italic">this</hi> end) till Monday (for Tuesday morning, if it luck): last Sunday, for a journey of 20 miles, was so unproductive! I am going on really well; I have wholesome victuals (the last 2 nights even a &#x201C;spark of porridge,&#x201D; consummate flower of culinary art for me); I walk, read, saunter (sorrowing but not quite <hi rend="italic">meanly</hi>
<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note>
 ); daily I get a really rather handsome gallop out of Noggs: if all that won&#x2019;t help me, nothing. My shoes are all mended, Noggs&#x2019;s bridle perfect; tomorrow Jean is coming out with the <hi rend="italic">ultimata</hi> of tailorings, &#x26; I will push Snip
<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The tailor Boyd.</note>
 to a finis with that paltry matter: all goes well enough with <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, if only my poor frail Life-Partner c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> get any way of sheltering herself from pain &#x26; misery. For the rest, what &#x201C;news&#x201D; can I have? <hi rend="italic">None</hi>, but such as the above: think of me so, and let my tolerable condit<hi rend="italic">n</hi> be a light-point to you while so much else is dark.&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; &#x2014;&#x2014; This <hi rend="italic">Cameo</hi> of you is but a feeble thing; but the standing figure, thank you for this new Copy.

<p>Here I am! as well as could be expected&#x2014;after travelling all night, choked in dust! an unprotected Female, with one arm! It is no sudden thought striking me! my mind has been made up to &#x201C;try a change,&#x201D;
<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Helen Mitchell&#x2019;s phrase &#x201C;grand change&#x201D; (25:61), and &#x201C;try a change,&#x201D; Dickens, <hi rend="italic">Pickwick Papers</hi>, chap. 21.</note>
 ever since my last interviewwith D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Quain&#x2014;and to try it with as little delay as possible. But I would not tell you I was coming because it was important that I should travel by night, and for you to meet me at Carlisle would have necessitated your sleeping there (an impossibility!) or else your starting from the Gill at an unearthly hour. Kindest not to place you in the dilemma! Up to the last moment I schemed about taking the Gill on my road or Dumfries and appointing you to meet me. But I was sure to be awfully tired&#x2014;just every atom of strength needed to carry me on to Thornhill&#x2014;without increasing my fatigues by the smallest <hi rend="italic">detours</hi> or by any avoidable &#x201C;emotion of the mind&#x201D;
<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Dickens, <hi rend="italic">A Tale of Two Cities</hi>, bk. 2, chap. 2.</note>
 &#x2014; To stay here a couple of hours and have breakfast and rest and then on, past Cummertrees with shut eyes, to the place of my destination seemed the wisest course. To <pb id="pg-42-88" n="42:88"/>this, since my arrival here, has been superadded the sublime idea to throw out a note for you and a sixpence at Cummertrees
<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cummertrees station was about 1&#xBD; mi. (2.5 km.) from The Gill; the station master was Robert Leitch (b. ca. <date when="1825-00-00">1825</date>).</note>
 as it had suddenly flashed on me that no letter from me could reach you by post till Tuesday So soon as I am rested I will make an appointment with you to meet at Dumfries if you would rather not come on to Holmhill</p>
<p>To think that I shall fly past within a quarter of a mile of you presently, and you will have no perception of my nearness!</p>

<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC&#x2019;s brother-in-law James Austin.</note>
 was down with the Gig to receive her, and found y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> messenger just got on the road. What coursings ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi>, unexpected meetings, &#x26; whirlings to and fro we have! Friday night, till six o&#x2019;clock a.m., I lay mostly awake; but figured poor Goody in her &#x201C;ourie bed,&#x201D; by no means shooting thro&#x2019; the world at that wild rate. Oh dear, oh dear! But it was right well done, if only it have proved well. If you have had a <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi>, as I pray and hope! Tomorrow morning, it is possible, but not likely, I <hi rend="italic">may</hi> hear word from you: otherwise I must wait another day, with what patience there is. <hi rend="italic">At Thornhill</hi> from midnight of Sunday, the mails must awaken; but who knows if anybody will then remember it (<hi rend="italic">you</hi> cannot), as I do here in regard to <hi rend="italic">Annan</hi>? Thus you will get y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> London <hi rend="italic">Friday&#x2019;s</hi> Letter, and this both at once, if I ride in the ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi> to Annan, when the breezes are up &#x26; the sun low. And we shall at least see each other ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi> at the soonest, poor souls!&#x2014;</p>
<p>The sole purport of this is to say, that I am well enough (my Friday&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi> adventure a mere scratch, my own blame chiefly, and all made right ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi>;&#x2014;&#x26; that I will come to you <hi rend="italic">at Thornhill</hi> any day you name. I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> fly off tomorrow; but judge it better to let <hi rend="italic">you</hi> write first. Wedn<hi rend="italic">y</hi> will suit me very well; any day will,&#x2014;only tomorrow I have to give my Snip audience, &#x26; get <hi rend="italic">thro</hi>&#x2019; with those wretched tailorings of his. At noon (by y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> own train on the day you fix) I can run to Thornhill (a place wholly agreeable to me from what I saw); &#x26; at 7 p.m. <pb id="pg-42-89" n="42:89"/>there is a train for Cumertrees ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi>. Ask Dr R. if it isn&#x2019;t so (no <hi rend="italic">Bradshaw</hi> just <hi rend="italic">here</hi>). Oh that I may hear my poor wearied Goody is getting sleep!&#x2014;

<p>I had, as usual, a good sleep the first night after my long journey; fatigue triumphing over the pains in my arm. Sunday night was also an improvement on my <hi rend="italic">Rectory</hi> ones; But last night was an entire failure.

<p><salute>Thanks, Dearest,</salute> for the little word: it is not worse than I expected, tho&#x2019; surely it is bad; <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi> Saturday, <hi rend="italic">poor</hi> sleep Sunday, &#x26; on Monday wake at 1 a.m.,&#x2014;woe&#x2019;s me! But surely things will <hi rend="italic">now</hi> soon improve. Mary tells me she had an arm for 5 months or more, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> seems to have been very like yours: miserable pain always, no <hi rend="italic">power</hi> oftenest, swelled &#x26; then fallen, great loss of sleep from pain:&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">bone</hi> gone wrong, John said; remedy nowhere; at the end of 5 or 6 months it went away of its own will. Courage, Hope!</p>
<p>Tomorrow I will come by the train <hi rend="italic">you</hi> came by; then I shall hear, &#x26; shall see! By the train wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> passes (I <hi rend="italic">think</hi>, but have no <hi rend="italic">bill</hi>) Thornhill ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> 4&#xBD; I shall have to go: some work at Dumfries ab<hi rend="italic">t slippers</hi>, ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> &#x26;c will oblige me to pause there; sometime ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> 8 p.m. from there, is a Train wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> will bring me home ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi> to my den in the wilderness,&#x2014;one of the mournfullest for me in Nature, but not unwholesome as things go.</p>
<p>Last night too I lost most of my sleep,&#x2014;sinner that I am. I renounced Scotsbrig then; no Scotsbrig till perhaps Sunday. I have spent the whole day in adding &#x26; subtracting to make out that Bank <hi rend="italic">blunder</hi>;
<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-42/lt-18650616-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1865-06-16">16 June</date>]</ref>.</note>
 &#x26; cannot from the Docum<hi rend="italic">ts here</hi>make it out at all. Meanwhile have sent <hi rend="italic">them</hi> a new draught to fill the gap on <hi rend="italic">their</hi> terms till we see farther.
<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC wrote in his checkbook, <date when="1865-07-11">11 July</date>: &#x201C;n.b. instead of &#x2018;2 <hi rend="italic">left</hi>,&#x2019; there turned out to be some &#xa3;53 or &#x2019;4 of &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">overdrawn</hi>&#x2019;! <date when="1865-06-00">End of june</date> I <hi rend="italic">sent</hi> &#xa3;60 as <hi rend="italic">stopgap</hi>, till we got accurately counted.&#x201D; He sent a check drawn on his Dumfries Bank, writing in his checkbook: &#x201C;The Gill (&#x2018;Dumfries&#x2019;) <date when="1865-00-00">1865</date> &#x2F; To London J<hi rend="italic">t</hi> St<hi rend="italic">k</hi> Bank 69 Pall Mall &#x2F; &#xa3;60 .. 0 .. 0&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s checkbook; MS: NLS 20753).</note>
 My head is soweak I cannot even add with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> error! I make an expenditure for last year of &#xa3;1,128,&#x2014;and threatened, on a second trial, to make it <hi rend="italic">more</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">them</hi> still farther in the right. So gave it up till we return.</p>
<p>My failure ofsleep last night, and my general pusillanimity, proceed, I am convinced, from <hi rend="italic">diet</hi>. This is really like a course of Spa or Ischl, or domestic goat&#x2019;s-whey;

I have done nothing else but think of you ever since we parted: my <hi rend="italic">day</hi> yesterday was the only beautiful one I have had in these parts, and yet it was steeped in sadness to me. My very heart is sore for thee, poor little soul, worried with continual pain, weak, sleepless, &#x26; in a bother too ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Lodging and &#x201C;cares of bread&#x201D;!

<salute>Dear Jean,</salute>
<p>We got home from Scotsbrig, after a quite fortunate journey and stay, yesternight before sunset,&#x2014;on one of the beautifullest ev<hi rend="italic">gs</hi> for a view of one&#x2019;s old <hi rend="italic">cradle</hi> bed!

<p><salute>Courage, Dearest;</salute> these bad news will not always continue, tho&#x2019; y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> poor left hand has none other to send me as yet! The torment, if nothing else can help it, must and will <hi rend="italic">burn itself out</hi>;&#x2014;all maladies are a fire lighted to clear off something else that was <hi rend="italic">worse</hi>, that had rendered them needful. If I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> but hear of you <hi rend="italic">sleeping</hi>&#x2014;but alas we cannot yet; only one night a little more tolerable, and then the next worse than before! Don&#x2019;t regret however that you <hi rend="italic">came</hi>: home had become intolerable; the change was suggested and recommended by every considerat<hi rend="italic">n</hi>; in brief, you <hi rend="italic">had</hi> to come. Nor must we give up poor Scotland its resources too soon; not till we <hi rend="italic">have</hi> exhausted them, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is yet far from being done. Please Heaven you shall return <hi rend="italic">able</hi> to write with the right hand, and sleeping as before!&#x2014;</p>
<p>The main thingI had to tell you today, in prospect of soon meeting for word of mouth is, That, if it will suit at all fairly, you must come on <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi> instead of Thursday. Jamie of Scotsbrig, who w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> fain see you, is bound on Thursday to a market at Lockerby; but will attend here if you can say Friday;&#x2014;that is <hi rend="italic">all</hi>; &#x26; on the whole, I will leave you to y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> choice (only fail not to give me <hi rend="italic">notice</hi>) if <hi rend="italic">Thursday</hi> still seem to you the preferable day. And you shall be met by Austin, not by me (oh you of little faith

 ),&#x2014;tho&#x2019; old &#x201C;Sandy&#x201D; the Ponyis one of the soberest not to say laziest in Nature, and an Earthquake is as likely as any fash from him. The <hi rend="italic">Cart</hi> too, if you are mad enough to <hi rend="italic">insist</hi> on it (but I hope and believe you won&#x2019;t): the gig is far <hi rend="italic">easier</hi> &#x201C;to get into&#x201D; than any cart;&#x2014;or even, if Jamie of Scots<hi rend="italic">g</hi> be here, you may have a really handsome &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">dogcart</hi>,&#x201D; and <hi rend="italic">both</hi> the Jamies
<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Carlyle and James Austin.</note>
 to help you in, I only waiting to open the gate for you here. Be sensible, Dearest; don&#x2019;t yield to whims now, don&#x2019;t.</p>
<p>I had a prosperous time to Scotsbrig &#x26; at and from it: all was so beautiful, so sad &#x26; silent;&#x2014;and I believe I am slowly getting rather better by my rusticat<hi rend="italic">n</hi>. I did a fair amount of (involuntary) talking; but nobody for an instant intruded; 3 fourths of my stay was solitude, silence, &#x26; all silent things were so much more <hi rend="italic">vocal</hi> to me there among the things where my <hi rend="italic">cradle</hi> stood, while the scene was still so crowded for me, instead of empty as now. Scotsbrig House (no servant in it, but Mary&#x2019;s &#x201C;Catharine&#x201D; assisted by Mary) seemed to me in such order as I never saw it in before:&#x2014;and you must know, I conceived a beautiful idea, and still have it (tho&#x2019; in <hi rend="italic">utter silence</hi>, n.b. for yourself too, &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">silence</hi>&#x201D;) that you &#x26; I might both lodge <hi rend="italic">together there</hi> for a week or two; &#x26; do <pb id="pg-42-96" n="42:96"/>better there than <hi rend="italic">anywhere</hi> else! This is really my notion (no &#x201C;railway trains,&#x201D; no nothing,&#x2014;if only Mary <hi rend="italic">can</hi> get away to attend you as nurse); but don&#x2019;t <hi rend="italic">whisper</hi> it to <hi rend="italic">any</hi>body till we see farther.&#x2014;&#x2014; &#x2014;&#x2014; I wish I knew what kind of <hi rend="italic">wine</hi> you drink; pray ment<hi rend="italic">n</hi> tomorrow; we have none here, but good, of any kind, tolerably <hi rend="italic">good</hi>, is attainable enough at Dumfries, or even at Annan. Now don&#x2019;t be <hi rend="italic">blate</hi>; but <hi rend="italic">say</hi>: you must not miss any portion of y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> poor <hi rend="italic">diet</hi> while here; having nothing else that you <hi rend="italic">can</hi> hit anywhere. Don&#x2019;t fail to write <hi rend="italic">tomorrow</hi> whether you <hi rend="italic">have</hi> written today or not. Bless thee,

 on Friday, having been invited for Thursday and asked to have the day changed to Friday. And last year when she had got up a dinner for me I had to send an excuse at the last hour, being too ill. <hi rend="italic">Tomorrow</hi> you will now be hardly expecting me. So let us say Saturday
<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC wrote later: &#x201C;The &#x2018;Saturday&#x2019; in this letter must refer to the visit she proposed making us at the Gill. Jamie of Scotsbrig particularly invited. Mournfully I ever recollect the day: bright and sunny; Jamie punctually there; I confidently expecting. Fool! I had not the least conception of her utter feebleness, and that she was never to visit &#x2018;The Gill&#x2019; more! Train passed. I hung about impatiently till the gig should return from Cummertrees Station&#x2014;with her, I never doubted. It came with John instead, to say she had been obliged to stop at Dumfries, and I must come thither by the next train: &#x2018;be exact; there will be a two and a half or three hours for us there still.&#x2019; I went (with John, Jamie regretfully turning home). She was so pleasant, beautifully cheerful, and quiet, I enjoyed my three hours without misgiving. Fool! fool!&#x2014;and yet there was a strange infinitude of sorrow and pity encircling all things and persons for me&#x2014;her beyond all others, though being really myself as if crushed flat after such a &#x2018;flight&#x2019; of twelve or thirteen years, latterly on the Owen &#x2018;comatose&#x2019; terms. I was stupefied into blindness! The time till her train should come was beautiful to me and everybody. Cab came for her, I escorting (the rest walked, for it was hardly five minutes off). Train was considerably too late. An old and good dumb &#x2018;Mr. Turner,&#x2019; whom she recognised and remembered kindly after forty years, was brought forward at her desire by brother John. Her talk with Turner (by slate and pencil, I writing for her)&#x2014;ah me! ah me! It was on the platform-seat, under an awning; she sat by me; the great, red, sinking sun flooding everything: day&#x2019;s last radiance, night&#x2019;s first silence. Grand, dumb, and unspeakable is that scene now to me. I sat by her in the railway carriage (empty otherwise) till the train gave its third signal, and she vanished from my eyes.&#x2014;T.C.&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note in Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi> 3:268). TC compared his long struggle with <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> with Richard Owen&#x2019;s description of &#x201C;migrative swallows&#x201D; that fly more or less in their sleep by the end of their long journey; see Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi> 3:180&#x2013;81 (also cited 39:264).

<p>Don&#x2019;t be bothering, making plans embracing <hi rend="italic">me</hi>. The chief good of a Holiday for a man is just he should have shaken off home cares, the foremost of these a wife!

<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Madame Venturi had been Miss Ashurst, of a well-known London parentage. She had (and has) fine faculties, a decidedly artistic turn, which led her much to Italy &#x26;c. Venturi was a Tyrolese Venetian (ex-Austrian military cadet, and also Garibaldist to the bone, consequently in a bad Italian position), who had fallen in love at first sight, &#x26;c., &#x26;c.; and was now fitting up a modest English house for wife and self.

&#x2014;you could not possibly have <hi rend="italic">read</hi> the letter or you could not have made such a mistake, so I advise you to read it now, with a key; &#x201C;The Gorilla&#x201D; means George Cook M stands for Mazzini, the sawyer Venturi, since you wish to know, I have gone back to Sherry and now good by till Saturday unless I hear to the contrary.

<salute>My dear M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Warren</salute>
<p>It is a fortnight today since I left home, and time that I should send you another word of news. At least I hope you are thinking so. For if such a kind motherly woman as you did not feel any concern about how I was getting on with this wretched arm; I should say it must have been somehow my own fault and did not tell to my advantage.</p>
<p>You will <hi rend="italic">see</hi> before reading a word, that my <hi rend="italic">right</hi> arm continues to be of no use to me! If only <hi rend="italic">that</hi> were <hi rend="italic">all</hi>, I could manage to get on pretty well with the <hi rend="italic">left</hi>. As I am here giving you a <hi rend="italic">proof</hi>! But the pain continues almost unbearable and keeps me awake, tumbling about like a wild thing, night after night thro&#x2019; one weary week after another. So that it is a perpetual miracle to myself that I am able to get up in the morning and keep on foot like other people thro&#x2019; the day! I have been much worse since I came here, than I was at Mr Macmillans. And long to be at Home again. Where, when ill one has always <pb id="pg-42-101" n="42:101"/>the consolation of perfect liberty to be as ugly and stupid and disagreeable as ever one likes!
<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410724-JWC-JF-01"><sic>13:196</sic><corr>JWC to JF, [<date when="1841-07-24">24 July 1841</date>]</corr></ref>.</note>
</p>
<p>If it were not for shame of seeming to not know my own mind, and for terror of the long journey back I would start off home at once! But I must at least, for decency&#x2019;s sake make out the <hi rend="italic">month</hi> I spoke of at starting.</p>
<p>I hope you are quite rid of the Painters&#x2014;and of the smell too. Be sure to keep <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the windows open&#x2014;that the House may be sweet when M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle returns and goes <hi rend="italic">sniffing</hi> all thro&#x2019; it!</p>
<p>If you have no more pressing work it would
<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >From here the letter continued in Jessie Hiddleston&#x2019;s hand.</note>
 be a useful thing to dolooking through all the sheets and mending them and there might not be soon so good an opportunity please inquire for Mr Royston and tell me how he is when you write. The settlement of the Hamper
<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably the weekly hamper of produce from Lady Ashburton&#x2019;s estate at Addiscombe.</note>
 was very judicious but in case of any such emergence again just take counsel with <hi rend="italic">yourself</hi>. I have considerable faith in <hi rend="italic">your</hi> practical judgement but little or none in Miss Jewsbury&#x2019;s her talent is of quite another sort than practical if the bookcases are not quite finished pray make Mr Freure get on that there may be no trace of new paint I will write again in a week but mind that you send me a few lines in the meantime</p>

<salute>Dearest</salute>
<p>About my sleep then&#x2014;? (being degenerated into a Creature that <hi rend="italic">sleeps</hi>&#x2014;or I should rather say that does <hi rend="italic">not</hi> sleep)&#x2014; <hi rend="italic">That</hi> night&#x2014;Saturday night&#x2014;I made a rather good job of it! My sufferings of the previous night and day, my little railway journey, Jane&#x2019;s &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Black-faced Mutton</hi>&#x201D;
<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jean Aitken&#x2019;s mutton, from local Scottish blackface sheep.</note>
 (the only morsel of meat fit to be presented to a &#x201C;delicate female&#x201D; that has entered my mouth since I left London) &#x201C;all together&#x201D;
<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-16/lt-18430711-JWC-TC-01"><sic>16:262</sic><corr>JWC to TC, [<date when="1843-07-11">11 July 1843</date>]</corr></ref>.</note>
 procured me two whole hours of sleep at a stretch, and three more of patchwork! So yesterday my wretched arm was less painful. Last night I lay down not expecting to sleep&#x2014;and was not disapointed! <pb id="pg-42-104" n="42:104"/>I had taken a blue pill
<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Blue pill,&#x201D; a compound containing mercury, taken by the Carlyles for both digestive and nervous ailments; see <ref target="volume-32/lt-18570326-TC-LA-01"><sic>32:111</sic><corr>TC to LA, <date when="1857-03-26">26 March 1857</date></corr></ref>.</note>
 (four grains) the third I had taken since I came, with the same result; that of lying awake the whole night after with no perceptible improvement on the utter stagnation of the liver for which the blue pill was prescribed. D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Russell is extremely cautious in giving any medicine at all; so when he says it is of the greatest importance that the present wonderful phenomenon should be repressed and that I must now go on taking &#x201C;four grains of Blue Pill <hi rend="italic">every</hi> night till <hi rend="italic">things have changed for the better</hi>&#x201D;! I make no debate, but swallow, and mean to swallow a blue pill <hi rend="italic">every night</hi> (Mercy of Heaven!) in spite of having got nothing but restlessness out of them hitherto.</p>
<p>Today I flit to Nith Bank
<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >To stay with Alicia Ewart, Nithbank, Thornhill.</note>
 without any definite idea of &#x201C;a glancing Future!&#x201D;
<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; literal trans. of Richter&#x2019;s &#x201C;gl&#xE4;nzendes Leben&#x201D;; see <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380918-JWC-TC-01"><sic>10:181</sic><corr>JWC to TC, [<date when="1838-09-18">18 Sept. 1838</date>]</corr></ref>.</note>
</p>
<p>I hope you will come this week&#x2014;Thursday? I will know better if &#x201C;the way be open&#x201D; when I write from the new place tomorrow.</p>
<p>I am so grieved about the disappointment I had to cause to Mary and Jamie. But I could not help it! I had done the impossible in dragging myself out of Bed and getting dressed between fits of retching, and getting myself into the Train. But if I hadn&#x2019;t reached Janes sofa when I did and got the bits of mutton when I did, you would have had me arrive at the Gill insensible!</p>
<p>Now I must go and put my things in the carpet bag</p>
<p>With my best love to dear Mary, and sincere wishes that I could be apleasure to my Friends instead of an ever recurring disappointment and ­botheration</p>

<closer><salute>Your ever affectionate</salute></closer>

<salute>Dearest</salute>
<p>In spite of my new bed (perhaps in virtue of it) and in spite of the daily Blue pill I <hi rend="italic">slept</hi> last night more or less! from three to four hours&#x2014;piecing all the <hi rend="italic">bits</hi> together&#x2014;a <hi rend="italic">good</hi> night for <hi rend="italic">me</hi>; according to the present tenor of my nights!

<p>I get on <hi rend="italic">well</hi> here. M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Ewart is very kind and not bothering! She is full of cheeriness, and a queer sort of cleverness.

It is as a Radical that we glory in Mr Ewart, and that the electors of Dumfries feel proud of him, and it is as a Radical that he will be returned again triumphant, as he has been so often before, by constituents who appreciate the services he has rendered them and their country, and who feel a just pride in the sterling honesty and manly independence and straitforwardness of his whole political life and character.&#x201D;</note>

<p><salute>Dear Neuberg,</salute>&#x2014;Y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Letter came to me yesterday afternoon,&#x2014;about 2 hours after I had forwarded <hi rend="italic">Abeken</hi>, with a Postscript of <hi rend="italic">inquiries</hi> as his main errand. I am very glad to hear you are better,&#x2014;and that among other blessings the <hi rend="italic">deafness</hi> is on the retreat.

 &#x26;c &#x26;c), wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I advise you <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to get into, or meddle with at all!&#x2014; &#x2014; This, I think, is the ans<hi rend="italic">r</hi> to all y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> practical inquiries.</p>
<p>I have now to make a special one of you! W<hi rend="italic">d</hi> my excell<hi rend="italic">t</hi> little Horse Noggs, who has often ridden with you, be of the least use to you (perhaps considering the <hi rend="italic">age</hi> of your excell<hi rend="italic">t</hi> little Gray?); and w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> you accept of a gift of Noggs from me? I have him here; &#x26; am thoroughly tired of him, and of all horses whatsoever. He was the munificent gift of the pres<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Lady Ashburton Dow<hi rend="italic">r</hi> to me; and cost <hi rend="italic">her</hi> a very long price, I have no doubt, &#xa3;60, &#xa3;80, I shall never know what; and now, in pres<hi rend="italic">t</hi> circumstances, probably I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not <hi rend="italic">sell</hi> him for &#xa3;10;&#x2014;and indeed sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> feel greatly <hi rend="italic">delivered</hi> if you w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> take him from me. For tho&#x2019; his <hi rend="italic">worth</hi> is not, in any respect diminished, his <hi rend="italic">selling</hi> capabilities are reduced in the extreme. He is one of the healthiest of Horses, as well as flintiest and sharpest; temper joyful and friendly (only <hi rend="italic">too</hi> &#x201C;friendly,&#x201D; if you give him <hi rend="italic">beans</hi>, &#x26; ride with loose rein!)&#x2014;perfectly sure-footed (tho&#x2019; he is blemished on both knees,&#x2014;got it by catching his foot in a long <hi rend="italic">curb</hi> rein wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I remissly had hanging over my little-finger, when he made a little stumble over some trifling thing, and intended to recover himself): finally, Sylvester, on sight 2 years ago, pronounced him to be 5 years of age; and <hi rend="italic">now</hi>, they inform me, he has <hi rend="italic">lost</hi> mark of mouth (as sometimes happens). These things are all true enough; but in no Horse-<hi rend="italic">bargain</hi> w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> they gain a moment&#x2019;s belief: &#x201C;a <hi rend="italic">good</hi> little &#x2019;Oss, Sir&#x201D; (as Sylv<hi rend="italic">r</hi> always emphatically defined him); who might as well be a thoroughly <hi rend="italic">bad</hi> for all <hi rend="italic">sale</hi> purposes. His riding you have seen; I believe he will go in harness too; Sylv<hi rend="italic">r</hi> found him unused to it (apparently), but willing, &#x26; he has bone and paces admirable for it,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; he shall be tried farther by some Artist in Dumfries, if you say Yes. In short <hi rend="italic">don&#x2019;t</hi> say No, unless he is absolutely <hi rend="italic">with</hi>t use to you. For I perceive I shall have to give him away to somebody; and you are the first I apply to,&#x2014;you who deserve far other &#x201C;gifts&#x201D; from me (had I got them, or did you need them) beyond any other person! Ans<hi rend="italic">r</hi> soon; <pb id="pg-42-114" n="42:114"/>and say <hi rend="italic">Yes</hi>; if you w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> deliver me from a considerable encumbrance. Noggs is in first-rate condit<hi rend="italic">n</hi>; can run here at grass so long as you like (grass plentiful &#x26;c &#x26;c), and the cost of franking
<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >That is, paying for sending Noggs to London.</note>
 him to London is a mere &#xa3;9, the <hi rend="italic">cheapest</hi> visible deliverance to me. Enough of Noggs!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I am speculating ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> a Voyage to the <hi rend="italic">Western Isles</hi>,
<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Western Isles, group of islands off the NW coast of Scotland, including Lewis and Harris, South Uist, North Uist, Benbecula, and Barra; also known as the Outer Hebrides.</note>
 to various isles &#x26; places;&#x2014;and do not intend much longer continuance in the torpid state, tho I suppose it may be found to have done me good when once I am out of it. Before Sept<hi rend="italic">r</hi> I am not likely to see the old detested element, of Penny Newsp<hi rend="italic">rs</hi>, Philanthropy, Italian Organs, and railway miracle ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi>. One&#x2019;s view of the world gets very sad &#x26; sombre, contemptuous to a painful degree, but not angry, at this safe distance of years and of miles: view as something <hi rend="italic">not</hi> in any way to be remedied or helped; fallen into the hands of the Primeval Powers and silently recording Destinies inexorably exact &#x26; just,&#x2014;who will with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> fail do to us and it what <hi rend="italic">is</hi> best, tho&#x2019; it seem cruel as Eternal Death! Amen.</p>
<p>Y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> acc<hi rend="italic">t</hi> of Mill is very curious. Strange indeed to see the peculiar Trismegistus,
<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thrice great; the Egyptian god Thoth was often referred to as Hermes Trismegistus and seen as a god of mysticism and alchemy.</note>
 and &#x201C;Thinker of Thinkers,&#x201D; whom the washed port<hi rend="italic">n</hi> of the English Populace has got hauled aloft at this rate.
<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Stuart Mill was one of the Liberal parliamentary candidates for Westminster; he was very reluctant to campaign actively as he did not believe in persuading people to vote for him, but did agree to appear at several pre-election meetings in <date when="1865-07-00">early July</date> to answer questions, including meetings at which working men who did not have the vote were welcome. The meetings were extremely popular.</note>
 A most clear, ingenuous, logically limpid soul; and of such a <hi rend="italic">depth</hi> as to believe in the Suffrage of Niggers and persons that can do a sum in the Rule of Three! Poor Mill, I found it proper (tho&#x2019; pressed to the contrary) to hold off entirely from this matter; believing that probably it will, in <hi rend="italic">either</hi> event, turn out very miserable for him.&#x2014; But But

<p><salute>Dearest,</salute> I do hope you are still going on well,&#x2014;so cheery was your last little left-hand Piece:&#x2014;but I will wait with great anxiety your message of tomorrow. My own history since you last heard is quies<hi rend="italic">ct</hi> in the extreme; <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> in fact, but, like your own, an adventure with the <hi rend="italic">mercurial</hi> friend!
<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The blue pill.</note>
 I was delighted to hear of what I counted your signal success in that matter; the preliminary of <hi rend="italic">great</hi> good, as I expect; and much to be welcomed as the <hi rend="italic">finis</hi> of those &#x201C;eight,&#x201D; were there nothing more. I took my own <hi rend="italic">one</hi> duly; and with no very marked result as yet; result <hi rend="italic">good</hi> however, so far as it goes. It has excited a very considerable new activity in the <hi rend="italic">mind</hi> of me at any rate, something far more like health than the dreary collapse I have been lying in hitherto; so that tho&#x2019; it has disturbed my sleep some little (nothing of <hi rend="italic">loss</hi> in that partic<hi rend="italic">r</hi> either) I am really obliged to it: and design to <hi rend="italic">take the other</hi> (perhaps tomorrow, if still found <hi rend="italic">needful</hi>, for perhaps there are <hi rend="italic">in</hi>cipiences of import on that physical side too);&#x2014;hoping always that you, poor little wretch, will take no more!&#x2014; For the rest I have done with my <hi rend="italic">Boileau</hi> (really a Book <hi rend="italic">not</hi> disgraceful to read); I have been consulting Western-Isles Steamers;
<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Steamers for the Western Isles left from Glasgow every Monday and Thursday at noon, calling at Oban (mainland), Tobermory (Mull), Portree (Skye), and Stornoway (Lewis) (advertised in the <hi rend="italic">Glasgow Herald</hi>).</note>

If the Stanleys have <hi rend="italic">come</hi> to Alderley (as I suppose, but of course you will strictly ascertain), the Program for you is now very fair to me, or at least greatly improved. I have little faith in &#x201C;quinine, iron&#x201D; &#x26;c; but if the &#x201C;eight&#x201D; have produced any really &#x201C;perceptible&#x201D; effect, I cherish firm hope in it, the <hi rend="italic">omnipotence</hi> of the liver being a thing painfully known to me for the half-century <pb id="pg-42-119" n="42:119"/>past! The result of my 1 is like that of y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> 8; barely &#x201C;perceptible&#x201D; (yet really so) on the beneficent side,&#x2014;while it continues to make such hagglement in my sleep, I <hi rend="italic">pause</hi> another day, perhaps altog<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, before taking any second.</p>
<p>Spedding&#x2019;s Letter, coupled with the Erskine Program and that of the <hi rend="italic">Western Isles</hi> voyage &#x26;c induces me to resolve on doing Spedding <hi rend="italic">first</hi>: &#x201C;Monday next, 17<hi rend="italic">th</hi>,&#x201D; is the day I mean to appoint with him; I can be here ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi> from him by the middle of the week,&#x2014;and in that way (if y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Stanleys &#x26;c are right), may see you <hi rend="italic">off</hi> (poor little Pilgrim) before going north. On &#x201C;Friday 14th,&#x201D; I will see you at Dumfries, in the interim (may my news of you be propitious!)&#x2014;Mary, much flattered by y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> wish, will be with me; I had tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> of that before, but said nothing till you spoke. &#x201C;Mrs Macdonald&#x201D; I cannot find out. I got no &#x201C;Note&#x201D; from Lady Ashb<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, nor sent any. &#x201C;Seaton for winter&#x201D; is a thing that makes one shriek! Say we will wait for Melchett.&#x2014; Yesternight I drove with Austin on Noggs to near Colinn:

Well, the image of driving you have just set before my imagination&#x2014;you driving me with Noggs in London&#x2014;is quite enough for one day. It melts the marrow in my bones!

<p>Well-done, left-hand; and thanks for the <hi rend="italic">goodish</hi> news you still send me!

I designed, and still design, to have a ride instead of walking and gigging today, and to be very dietetic: but it is no help to me, that poor Jean, <hi rend="italic">ignorant</hi> of Friday &#x26; its outlooks, has arrived to &#x201C;pass the day with me&#x201D;!

 very modest in her claim, good soul; and will not stand in my way <hi rend="italic">more</hi> than what is inevitable. &#x201C;Writing,&#x201D; however, after my six Notes of yesterday is evidently no charity to you, nor any duty to anybody.&#x2014; &#x2014; I send the <hi rend="italic">Otthennin</hi> wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> you may burn <hi rend="italic">witht</hi> reading (tho&#x2019; don&#x2019;t); item the <hi rend="italic">John</hi>, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is concise as a Grocer&#x2019;s Bill, &#x26; has particles of news in it.

And then the dinner itself, and the bustling rustic company, all this, too, was saved by her, with a quiet little touch here and there, she actually turned it into something of <hi rend="italic">artistic</hi>, and it was pleasant to everybody&#x201D; (Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> 184).</note>

 The interesting Phenomena which resulted were little improved as to snow-white innocence of colour.

<salute>My dearest Betty</salute>
<p>It has been often in my mind that you would think me growing neglectful&#x2014;so long it is since I wrote you any letter! But there was needed the prompting of your own dear letter, forwarded back from London this morning, to stir me up to undertake the fatigue which writing is for me at present and has been for more than two months back. You must know that every thing I <hi rend="italic">do</hi>; even to putting the food into my mouth; has to be done with my <hi rend="italic">left</hi> hand which I was not ever before in the habit of using at all! and which protests against the unwonted demands on it by taking the cramp every now and then; so that <hi rend="italic">writing</hi> is really only to be attempted in cases of necessity! For my right hand and arm are entirely disabled by neuralgia! and besides having no earthly use of them, the pain&#x2014;just like a bad toothache in my arm and hand, hinders me from sleeping and eating. So my London D<hi rend="italic">r</hi>
<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. Richard Quain.</note>
 being unable to give me relief ordered me off to Scotland again as <hi rend="italic">that</hi> had done me so much good last year.</p>
<p>So I came to M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Russells at Holmhill&#x2014;where I am always welcomed like an own Child, just a month ago. A fortnight of the time I have been with M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Ewart of Nith Bank. But I go back to Holmhill tomorrow for another week&#x2014;and then back to London!&#x2014;without seeing you, my Darling!&#x2014; I did not send you word when I first came for I was hoping my wretched arm might really derive some benifit from the change of air, and if <hi rend="italic">it</hi> permitted me any pleasure in life I had it in my heart to proceed to Edinburgh just to see <hi rend="italic">you</hi>. As for my Aunts,
<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ann, Elizabeth, and Grace Welsh, JWC&#x2019;s three paternal aunts, living in Edinburgh.</note>
 their invitations, if they give any are so little cordial that I neednt put myself to any expense or trouble for the sake of seeing <hi rend="italic">them</hi>!</p>
<p>My idea was to ask <hi rend="italic">you</hi> to find a lodging for me and my Maid
<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jessie Hiddleston.</note>
 for a day or <pb id="pg-42-127" n="42:127"/>two and then take the train for London. But this beautiful little scheme has been knocked on the head by the fact that my arm continues as bad as ever, making me shrink from all journeyings and changings that can be avoided and only anxious to get back to my own quiet bed at Chelsea.</p>
<p>It is such a dreadful pity that the journey from Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> to Thornhill is so indirect and interrupted. I would be only too happy to pay your expenses here to see me if it werent that I know the journey would be both too fatiguing and too confusing for you! We are none ofus so young as we have been Dear!</p>
<p>On the 24<hi rend="italic">th</hi> then I start for London&#x2014;and will write or make somebody write on myarrival</p>

<p><salute>Oh howdelightful! My dear M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Ruskin!</salute> That nice long letter and lovely little Book&#x2014; Imagine! they came to me the first thing on my Birthday morning!
<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ruskin wrote, <date when="1865-07-13">13 July</date>, enclosing a copy of his new book, <hi rend="italic">Sesame and Lilies</hi> (<date when="1865-00-00">1865</date>). He replied, <date when="1865-07-17">17 July</date>: &#x201C;I am so happy about the birthday&#x2014;and very proudly happy that I can give you pleasure on any day&#x201D;; JWC&#x2019;s birthday was <date when="1865-07-14">14 July</date>.</note>
 Came with all the charm of a Birthday present!&#x2014;&#x2014; You once gave me strawberries and cream on my Birthday&#x2014;do you remember?
<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In <date when="1856-00-00">1856</date>, JWC described Ruskin driving her, TC, and Nero the dog on two outings to Ruskin&#x2019;s family home, Denmark Hill, summer <date when="1855-00-00">1855</date>; in one they had strawberries and cream on the lawn (see <ref target="volume-31/lt-18560223-JWC-WA-01"><sic>31:38</sic><corr>JWC to WA, <date when="1856-02-23">23 Feb. 1856</date></corr></ref>).</note>
 (I have never seen such strawberries and cream since! nor have I had any such pleasant Birth-day since! but all have passed in pain and sorrow!) I like the Book and letter far better however, because these will <hi rend="italic">keep</hi>! And being superstitious a little, as a Scotch woman ought to be, I draw ever so many good omens from the Book and Letter beginning a new year of Life for me! One piece of good I clearly divine therefrom; that <hi rend="italic">you</hi> are not going to forget poor me in the pressure of your avocations and <hi rend="italic">distractions</hi> but will care for me, and give me flowers now and then, as long as I last!</p>
<p>What a talent for naming you have!</p>
<p><pb id="pg-42-128" n="42:128"/>&#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Of Kings Treasuries</hi>!</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Of Queen&#x2019;s Gardens</hi>!
<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Of Kings&#x2019; Treasuries&#x201D; and &#x201C;Of Queens&#x2019; Gardens,&#x201D; the subtitles of the two parts of <hi rend="italic">Sesame and Lilies</hi>; they were originally delivered as lectures in Manchester in <date when="1864-00-00">1864</date>; see <hi rend="italic">Ruskin&#x2019;s Works</hi> 18:53&#x2013;108, 109&#x2013;44.</note>
</p>
<p>The names lift me already into the sphere of the Arabian Nights!
<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The other <date when="1855-00-00">1855</date> trip to Denmark Hill was for a dinner at the Ruskins&#x2019; that JWC compared to &#x201C;what one reads of in <hi rend="italic">Arabian Nights</hi>&#x201D; (31:38).</note>
</p>
<p>Please tell your Mother
<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Margaret Ruskin.</note>
 how much I am obliged to her for her call, altho&#x2019; I was so unlucky as miss it.
<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ruskin wrote: &#x201C;[M]y mother &#x26; I concocted a visit to you&#x2014;and we got up really a nice flower&#x2014;and away we went to Chelsea my mother <hi rend="italic">so</hi> particular about her two cards! one to be for Mr. Carlyle&#x2019;s mythic presence. So when we got there they said you were in Scotland&#x2014;but couldn&#x2019;t tell me where, or I should have written long ago.&#x201D;</note>
 And you may add, if you like, that I am sure she would not dislike me if she knew me: for, the only time I ever saw her, I felt to <hi rend="italic">take to Her</hi> very much, because she said no superfluous or insincere word! And I have always found that those I take to at first sight take to <hi rend="italic">me</hi> sooner or later if they give themselves a fair chance.
<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ruskin replied, <date when="1865-07-17">17 July</date>: &#x201C;My mother is very cock-ahoop too about your pretty message&#x2014;but that is good for her&#x2014;for she&#x2019;s always snubbing <hi rend="italic">me</hi> and then I say impertinent things to her&#x2014;which she pretends not to mind&#x2014;but does; and while she is always <hi rend="italic">saying</hi> things which look as if she was the most conceited person in the world&#x2014;she is really very uncomfortably humble&#x2014;and glad of a bit of nice praise like this of yours.&#x201D;</note>
</p>
<p>I cannot understand your persistence in forgetting M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Hawks (Madame Venturi)! She is to my mind perfectly charming! If you knew the romantic thing she once did for love of you, it would fix her in your mind for ever!</p>
<p>&#x201C;My lamed hand&#x201D;! Alas no! It is not with <hi rend="italic">that</hi> I write. <hi rend="italic">That</hi> is quite past making any sort of writing whatever! It is too painful to attempt using <hi rend="italic">it</hi> at all. So I have had to learn to write with my <hi rend="italic">left</hi> hand, which protests against the unwonted exaction in taking every now and then the Cramp!
<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ruskin wrote, <date when="1865-07-13">13 July</date>, &#x201C;I have the sorrow of knowing you wrote all that with your lame hand,&#x201D; and then replied, <date when="1865-07-17">17 July</date>: &#x201C;I <hi rend="italic">wrote</hi> &#x2018;lame hand&#x2019; carelessly, but I <hi rend="italic">had</hi> read your letter. I meant the cramp-taking left hand&#x2014;not the disabled one &#x2F; But you must get the hands into order&#x2014;we can&#x2019;t have strikes right &#x26; left like this.&#x201D;</note>
</p>
<p>I hope to get home on the 24<hi rend="italic">th</hi> or 25<hi rend="italic">th</hi>.</p>

<salute>Dear Lady Stanley,</salute>
<p>My Wife,&#x2014;rather improved in health, tho&#x2019; still suffering from pain in the arm and imperfect<hi rend="italic">n</hi> of sleep,&#x2014;is to set out for Chelsea Tomorrow week (i.e. Monday <date when="1865-07-24">july 24th</date>); she intends to do the whole in one day,&#x2014;wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is not a thing I altogether like, if handy to avoid.</p>
<p>Alderley&#x2019;s and especially Lady Stanley&#x2019;s hospitable feelings towards us are a thing now known for a generat<hi rend="italic">n</hi> past! Privately my notion is, Jane w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not dislike pausing with you for one day;&#x2014;and I can publicly testify that she is far better company than I am at pres<hi rend="italic">t</hi>; and has a maid
<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jessie Hiddleston.</note>
 with her, and will cost no special trouble.</p>
<p>It is possible you may have other company just now; possible you may not be at Alderley at all! What I <hi rend="italic">can</hi> do, is to write this Letter <hi rend="italic">under the rose</hi>;
<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >That is, sub rosa, privately.</note>
 to give you Jane&#x2019;s Address (&#x201C;Holm Hill, <hi rend="italic">Thornhill</hi>, Dumfriesshire&#x201D;); and to say that if, on or before Saturday morning, &#x201C;Sabbath desecrat<hi rend="italic">n</hi> and no Post after <pb id="pg-42-131" n="42:131"/>that&#x201D; next, you asked her, I think she w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> come;
<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lady Stanley replied, <date when="1865-07-19">19 July</date>: &#x201C;You are a real friend I have written to your wife to beg of her to rest with us.&#x201D;</note>
 &#x26; that if you don&#x2019;t write at all, this too will be an answer (and nobody but y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Ladyship &#x26; I the wiser!) abund<hi rend="italic">tly</hi> suffic<hi rend="italic">t</hi>.</p>
<p>I am going into Cumberland, tomorrow, for a brief visit; <hi rend="italic">after</hi> wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> extensive voyagings (Western Isles, John o&#x2019; Groat&#x2019;s &#x26;c &#x26;c) are on the carpet; &#x26; I can give no definite acc<hi rend="italic">t</hi> of myself, except gradually to <hi rend="italic">Chelsea</hi>,&#x2014;wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I don&#x2019;t expect to <hi rend="italic">see</hi> ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi> till Sept<hi rend="italic">r</hi> at soonest. I have lain here for these 6 weeks, the <hi rend="italic">mutest</hi>, laziest &#x26; most stagnant of all the sons of men. Never in my life so <hi rend="italic">tired</hi> before. But am now to get astir ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi> in some measure. I was deeply sensible of L<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Stanley&#x2019;s kindness <hi rend="italic">in re</hi> Bullock,

<p><salute>Dearest,</salute>&#x2014;I am at my old trade ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, scribble-scribbling: to Jamie, to Lady Stanley, to &#x26;c &#x26;c <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to poor Goody till <hi rend="italic">now</hi>, sinner that I am!),
<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS; no opening parenthesis.</note>
 &#x2014;wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> with a hand of this shakiness and an apparatus all d<hi rend="italic">o</hi> d<hi rend="italic">o</hi> is truly nothing of a favourite with me. But let me tell <hi rend="italic">you</hi> the indispensable with brevity; for all my packing &#x26;c, and all my riding (if any), are still to do. Oh Goody dear, c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> I but know that things go well with <hi rend="italic">thee</hi>, how much happier were I in my own shoes (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> are none of the easiest) here,&#x2014;amid the hurries of adjusting!</p>
<p>Fear not, how<hi rend="italic">r</hi>: I slept miraculously well that dangerous Friday night.

 Whole <hi rend="italic">glass</hi> of brandy in tumbler of hot milk, cunning arrang<hi rend="italic">ts</hi> before (window close shut, vent opened, &#x26;c &#x26;c), I actually fell asleep at once; did not awake till 6 a.m. with my haggard terrors and flurries much gone; and managed, after a little fugling, to sleep ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi> for above 2 hours,&#x2014;some eight in all (far better than poor Goody, I doubt!)&#x2014;and have been in a <hi rend="italic">restored</hi> state ever since. It is these blue fellows mainly! Yesterday the <hi rend="italic">second</hi> of them prosecuted me, as <hi rend="italic">physic</hi> too, with all the rigour of law: and I really suppose, both of <pb id="pg-42-132" n="42:132"/>them have done me essential good; but I will have no more partnership with them at pres<hi rend="italic">t</hi>.&#x2014; It was necessary to get thro&#x2019; all this botherat<hi rend="italic">n</hi>; and cut <hi rend="italic">loose</hi> from my now stagnancy: Go ahead, then; from Annan tomorrow at 12.6; safe in Keswick (if we prosper) while you are sitting down at Holm Hill to dine.</p>
<p>Neuberg, you see, rejects Noggs;&#x2014;very well; and his advice ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> keeping him too had already occurred to me as a safe <hi rend="italic">pis-aller</hi> [stopgap]. He becomes-omes

 eminent ever more, day by day, as a Gighorse; did his <hi rend="italic">two</hi> journeys yesterday (one to Annan on household bus<hi rend="italic">ss</hi> with Mary), the 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi> a rough 12 miles more, and behaved royally thro&#x2019;out. Poor Noggs, as he looked in my face thro&#x2019; his blinders and all ungroomed after our fine performance, it seemed to me said, &#x201C;Master, what is this!&#x201D; in a loyal but tragic humour; and I was sorry for the poor dumb heart. He actually likes me, I perceive, and is glad when I ride him.&#x2014; The <hi rend="italic">Quarterly Review</hi> (see Fred<hi rend="italic">c</hi> Chapman)

 will attend you in London, if you care for it. I saw nothing, heard of nothing but what he notes.</p>
<p>At Keswick I must try to hold out till Thursday any way; <hi rend="italic">promise</hi> goes no farther. I must duly indicate what is to be done ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> a sight of <hi rend="italic">you</hi> before Monday following,&#x2014;or <hi rend="italic">on</hi>, if that alone be feasible. Oh my Dear, my poor Dear!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Lady Stanley is warned <hi rend="italic">to warn</hi> you, &#x201C;at Holm-hill, on or before Saturday,&#x201D; if she do <hi rend="italic">wish</hi> you to come: if she <hi rend="italic">don&#x2019;t</hi>, nothing is to be said by her to me or to you,&#x2014;and my Note to her is an <hi rend="italic">unknown</hi> transact<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, completely <hi rend="italic">sub rosa</hi>, by hypothesis. She will hardly get y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Letter till Wednesday; <hi rend="italic">sooner</hi> than Saturday, she cannot well hit you. Let me hope she will!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> news of today (you are writing today!) will not get to Keswick till Wednesday; by <hi rend="italic">return</hi> at latest, I will write. My pres<hi rend="italic">t</hi> plan is rather to come back by Scotsbrig,&#x2014;Jamie&#x2019;s visit with me to Craigenputtock
<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >As the owner of the property, TC liked to visit Craigenputtoch occasionally to check that all was well; see <ref target="volume-42/lt-18650808-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, [<date when="1865-08-08">8 Aug.</date>]</ref>.</note>

<dateline>Mirehouse Keswick, Tuesday <date when="1865-07-18">18 july / 1865</date>&#x2014;</dateline>
<p><salute>Dearest,</salute> I am sitting tremulously waiting for y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Letter (arrives at 12, <hi rend="italic">ans</hi>r must go at 2): Heaven grant the news may be propitious; I am not, at pres<hi rend="italic">t</hi>, in the most impugnable humour. And my <hi rend="italic">hand</hi> is going at such a rate as you see!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Yesterday at 11 I left Gill,with Austin and Noggs conducting; got in at Annan; carriage empty, day fine, journey altogether fortunate (pause of &#xBD; hour at Carlisle, at Penrith
<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Penrith, market town about 18 mi. (29 km.) S of Carlisle.</note>
 only of 6 minutes, <hi rend="italic">all</hi> my 3 successive carriages empty),&#x2014;a journey altogether towardly, and not unpleasant tho&#x2019; so very sad to the poor heart of me&#x2014; Punctual to the hour (2.39) I was at Keswick, found Spedding with equipage attending,&#x2014;who joyfully welcomed me, &#x26; a certain dark young gent<hi rend="italic">n</hi> as well,&#x2014;the dark y<hi rend="italic">g</hi> gent<hi rend="italic">n</hi> proving to be a Scotch Parson, formerly his son&#x2019;s Tutor, whom he had summoned from Kilwinning
<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably John Sime (<date when="1837-00-00">1837</date>&#x2013;<date when="1904-00-00">1904</date>), educ. St. Andrews Univ., minister of Kilwinning, Ayrshire, <date when="1864-00-00">1864</date>&#x2013;<date when="1866-00-00">66</date>, his first position; the Spedding son was Henry Anthony Spedding.</note>
 all the way to bear me comp<hi rend="italic">y</hi> on this occas<hi rend="italic">n</hi>. A perfectly harmless y<hi rend="italic">g</hi> gent<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, tho&#x2019; a perfectly superfluous. My welcome was all that honest cordiality and anxious simplicity of kindness c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> do. Right fain w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> I, after my final drive of 5 miles, have gone to sleep in my fine bedroom, with inviting sofa: but in the circ<hi rend="italic">s</hi> it was not permitted; &#x26; we had to struggle on (not <hi rend="italic">ill</hi> at all, tho&#x2019; they set me talking too much,&#x2014;and I can&#x2019;t help it!) till midnight nearly; nor, alas, were my sorrows ended then. I have the finest of 4-post beds, spacious sleeping room equally excell<hi rend="italic">t</hi>; silence for, a long time, as of Elysium:&#x2014;but, alas, sleep was not quite propitious! Till 4 a.m. I at least lay motionless in half-sleep; tried tobacco then, with good hope; but, well before 5, there flew down a beautiful <hi rend="italic">cochin-china</hi>, whom I hear even now (but whom I intend to get <hi rend="italic">imprisoned</hi> for this night and the following)! In spite of this majestic Animal, I managed at last, by clapping a finger in my ear, to sink into ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> one hour of real sleep: after wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> from 7 to 9&#xBD; I had to be content with sauntering in the walks &#x26; woods feeling really not <hi rend="italic">ill</hi> at all, but better than usual, with nothing of the dismal old queasy feeling I hitherto had. For 2 nightsmore, I can make this kind of thing do (tho&#x2019; tonight it will probably <hi rend="italic">mend</hi>); after wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I make for Annandale ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi>; and <hi rend="italic">see</hi> my poor Goody at least before she go.</p>
<p>The familyhere consists mainly of 3 beautiful y<hi rend="italic">g</hi> ladies
<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas and Frances Spedding had three das., Margaret, Frances, and Mildred.</note>
 (children when I <pb id="pg-42-134" n="42:134"/>was last here), and one taciturn rather gawkyish y<hi rend="italic">g</hi> son, d<hi rend="italic">o</hi> d<hi rend="italic">o</hi>; and all are amiable and most polite,&#x2014;including Ma &#x26; Pa most especially. Kilwinning, amiable youth, has contributed but little hitherto,&#x2014;except one joke from Annan. He had seen me from the next Car-Carriage
<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letters repeated at start of new page.</note>
 when I entered there; a gent<hi rend="italic">n</hi> or gent said to a gent, &#x201C;Is that Mr Carlyle?&#x201D; &#x201C;Yes,&#x2014;&#x26; there is Mr Ewart

<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Public Opinion</hi>, <date when="1865-07-15">15 July</date>, reprinted part of chap. 6 of Ruskin&#x2019;s &#x201C;The Cestus of Aglaia,&#x201D; which was being serialized in the <hi rend="italic">Art Journal</hi>; see <ref target="volume-42/lt-18650513-TC-JRU-01">TC to <sic>JR</sic><corr>JRU</corr>, <date when="1865-05-13">13 May</date></ref>. The subject of the chapter was freedom, and Ruskin compared the life of a housefly to that of a watchdog, the former completely free and the latter bound to its owner: &#x201C;Yet of the two, would we rather be a watch-dog or fly? Indeed, the first point we have all to determine is not how free we are, but what kind of creatures we are. It is of small importance to any of us whether we get liberty; but of the greatest that we deserve it.&#x201D; He deplored &#x201C;the infinite follies of the modern thought in this matter, centred in the notion that liberty is good for a man, irrespective of the use he is likely to make of it&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Art Journal</hi>, <date when="1865-07-01">1 July 1865</date>).</note>

<salute>My dear Darling Lady Ashburton!</salute>
<p>If you keep the day you named to me; you will be starting on Friday.
<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Fri., <date when="1865-07-21">21 July</date>; Lady Ashburton was planning to travel to Wiesbaden for her health; see <ref target="volume-42/lt-18650625-JWC-LA-01">JWC to <sic>Lady A</sic><corr>LLA</corr>, <date when="1865-06-25">25 June</date></ref>.

 So I have left myself hardly more than time to reach you with a parting blessing!</p>
<p>I would have givena good deal to get one look of you and one kiss of you before you put the Sea between us But it has proved impossible for me to get back to Chelsea before the 24<hi rend="italic">th</hi> without causing more annoyance and inconvenience than I am all worth!</p>
<p>M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C isgone on a short visit to M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Spedding at Keswick and comes here on Saturday to see me before I go. He looked any thing but improved by his beloved &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Solitude</hi>&#x201D; when I saw him last&#x2014;and instead of Solitude he used the term &#x2018;Stagnation&#x2019;!! I got him to take a blue pill and he writes that it had done wonders for him! He is going to cruise round the Western Isles and go on Shore at Thurso!</p>
<p>For me I narrowly escaped an attack of jaundice since I came! the constant day and night shooting pains in my arm had induced it and I had to take <hi rend="italic">eight</hi> blue pills, <hi rend="italic">moi</hi>! on <hi rend="italic">eight</hi> successive nights!! I am now slightly improved, arm and all, but the small gain does not repay the long journey</p>
<p>Writing grows always more difficult for me instead of less&#x2014; The left hand with which alone I can hold a pen taking every now and then the cramp by way of protest, I suppose, at the unusualdemands made on it.</p>
<p>Oh what a good andbeautiful thing it would be for you and for me too, to be <hi rend="italic">free of pain</hi>&#x2014;for a while!</p>
<p>God keep you dearest, kindest of Friends! I love you&#x2014; We love you more than any other living woman!&#x2014; And that&#x2019;s truth!</p>

<salute>Dear Mrs Warren</salute>
<p>I keep to my intention of leaving for Home on Monday next and I have just written to Lady Stanley of Alderley declining her kind invitation to rest there on the road. I was strongly tempted to do this; but her youngest daughter is there in daily expectation of her confinement. And it would have been dreadful to plump into the midst of an affair of that sort&#x2014;her <hi rend="italic">first</hi> child too&#x2014;</p>
<p>I mean to travel by day this time, so shall arrive, if all go right, about eleven or twelve at night. I would like a fire in the Drawing room put on in the forenoon to air it thoroughly, also a fire in my bedroom.</p>
<p>I had <hi rend="italic">no</hi> sleep again last night&#x2014;and cannot steady my poor left hand to write.</p>
<p>I pray Heaven I may have better sleep in my own bed than I get here!&#x2014;</p>
<p><pb id="pg-42-140" n="42:140"/>I shall need nothing but tea or negus or some such thing&#x2014;and <hi rend="italic">bread</hi>! I hope you will be able to get yeast&#x2014;you can also have a bit of <hi rend="italic">good</hi> bacon&#x2014;if possible!</p>
<p>Jessie has trunks of the most alarming size! I wish we may get them along without difficulties!</p>

<p><salute>Dear Goody,</salute> oh that sleep, that sleep! I wish to Heaven you were home ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, where I cannot but perceive you w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be better. It is perfectly heart-breaking, that of lying awake in misery night after night. But courage, we <hi rend="italic">are</hi> near the end:&#x2014;Let me to work, and see how to settle ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> monday next. As to myself, in the interim, know that I got hither with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> the least mischance, tho&#x2019; across infinite bustle and bother; found Jean punctually waiting at Gretna (to pick me up, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> was her own scheme); Jamie waiting with gig at Ecclefechan Station (where we just <hi rend="italic">escaped</hi> the bad thunder-shower); and in short, am alive and awake here <hi rend="italic">taliter qualiter</hi>, not so ill off even in regard to sleep, of the <hi rend="italic">piecemeal</hi> kind;&#x2014;I mean to have a long ride of Noggs, and see the Water-of-Milk
<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Water of Milk, tributary of the river Annan.</note>
 Country so soon as I am done. My three days of Keswick are as a small polished flag-stone, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I am not sorry to have intercalated in the rough floor of boulders wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> my sojourn otherwise has mostly been in these parts.</p>
<p>There is no possibility of <hi rend="italic">ans</hi>r, from you ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> monday! I must therefore spell it out myself; and fix for us both the best I can. <hi rend="italic">First</hi>, then, in any and every case, that &#x201C;Kist&#x201D; of y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> maid&#x2019;s must go by the Luggage-train: unendurable to bother y<hi rend="italic">r</hi>self with an ugly matter of that kind in y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> difficult Pilgrimage. Second, I hope there is not the least doubt but you <hi rend="italic">will</hi> go by Alderley: I have a Letter yesterday (bro<hi rend="italic">t</hi> over from The Gill) from Lady Stanley, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> makes it manifest to me that she really does want you,

 and will be afflicted if you don&#x2019;t. Pause at Alderley, by all means; for two days, or for one, as you <hi rend="italic">find</hi> it suit. Maid with you &#x26; nobody else but Lady S. and an <hi rend="italic">expect</hi>t Rosalind in that big house, you will do very well surely,&#x2014;and may have driving &#x26;c &#x26;c to any <pb id="pg-42-141" n="42:141"/>length, if only you be bold enough (or as you will call it, <hi rend="italic">impud</hi>t enough). As to the train you go by, and our meeting at Dumfries on monday, there will be no difficulty in that either, <hi rend="italic">if</hi> you are right in fixing to go by the 7.35 p.m. train from Dumfries: but I have no <hi rend="italic">Bradshaw</hi> here, and of my own light, can only guess and believe. &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Chelms</hi>ford,&#x201D; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is in Essex, and above 200 miles from any part of y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> route, does indeed rather stagger me, or did; but I conclude you meant <hi rend="italic">Knuts</hi>ford,

<p>The course therefore is, Jean &#x26; [I]

 make over to The Gill tomorrow; Jean home that night (no trains to scream <hi rend="italic">me</hi> awake that ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi> at Gill, where I can wait till monday morning): <hi rend="italic">you</hi> meanwhile to leave Thornhill by what train you like (11 a.m., the best); we all waiting for you at Dumfries (perhaps Jamie of Scotsbrig too, with an eye to Craigenputtoch next day?)&#x2014;where everybody will do his best to wrap you in cotton, poor sick Dear, and keep you quiet, or how you wish and bid (a <hi rend="italic">darkened</hi> bedroom, &#x26; really good degree of silence &#x26;c) till the time for <hi rend="italic">launching</hi>:&#x2014;God go with you, Dearest.&#x2014; &#x2014; This, so far as I can see, is the correct Program, tho&#x2019; the <hi rend="italic">one</hi>-sided.

<p><salute>DearBrother,</salute>&#x2014;Jean met me beautifully yesterday at Gretna, and stept into the carriage with good omens. Nothing has gone much amiss with us here; <hi rend="italic">her</hi> partial failure of sleep (<hi rend="italic">not</hi> repaired like mine) the sole or principal thing.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-42-142" n="42:142"/>Jane, I make out, by much spelling, is to start from Dumfries for Knutsford (near Alderley Park) by the 7.35 p.m. train: she will arrive in Dumfries by the Thornhill 11 a.m. train, and we must try to be kind to her all day; for she is ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi> suffering from from
<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note>
 want of sleep to a sad degree. I expect she will stay 2 days or 1 day at Alderley: and then, forward by Crewe to L[on]don. <hi rend="italic">Jean</hi> I am to take over to The Gill tomorrow, and thence despatch her to Dumfries by some late train, there to be ready for Jane&#x2019;s transit. On Monday I will be there myself (barring accid<hi rend="italic">t</hi>), perhaps Jamie of Scotsbrig too, and on the morrow to Craigenputtoch; at all events, our <hi rend="italic">Southern</hi> adventure will then be <hi rend="italic">closed</hi>. That is to say, I am then ready for you, and for what you can scheme as to the Hyperborean Voyagings. Perhaps direct for Wick

His brother the Doctor would accompany him. Would I be at the trouble to find out the sailing of the steamers, jot down the route for him, and name people who would be able to give him local information?

<p>I am afraid Dear that I have &#x201C;made a mull of it&#x201D;!

 &#x2014; I should have let you come here today! For there can be no peaceable meeting at Dumfries. I decided against Alderley&#x2014;and must take our tickets for London here not to lose time or create bother with the luggage. So you will just have to jump in at Dumfries and go a few miles with me.</p>
<p>I told you I must leavethe decision about Alderley till next day. Night would bring counsel. Yes! But one knows what dark premises Deliberation starts from, and what pusillanimous conclusion it arrives at, when Night brings no sleep! And that night again I lay wholly and absolutely awake. So my ignorance of Chelford which I found indeed on the map some fourteen miles from Crew but did not know at all how far it was from Alderley Park,&#x2014;and uncertainty whether they would send a Carriage for me; and the possibility of the Grand Event

 coming off with <hi rend="italic">me</hi> in &#x201C;another part of the house&#x201D; the worst timed of creatures! All these objections assumed gigantic proportions over night! and the <hi rend="italic">appointment</hi> of &#x201C;two nights&#x201D; as the utmost possible limit of the hospitality offered me, chilled my ardour for availing myself of it! not that I had ever an intention of or wish of staying longer. But I disliked not having the credit allowed me of <hi rend="italic">means</hi> enough to <hi rend="italic">see</hi> when I was inconvenient without needing to be told.</p>
<p>And so I wrote yesterday with many thanks that I could not think of plunging into the midst of the approaching Event.</p>
<p>I took care to word my letter kindly and gratefully. For she did do the thing as handsomely as <hi rend="italic">she</hi> could!</p>
<p>On Monday then by the eleven o&#x2019;clock train&#x2014;on the Platform</p>

<p>My Wife returns you a thousand thanks, as do I,&#x2014;with ­<hi rend="italic">congratulations</hi> from both of us in equal number, on the joyful news she had received <pb id="pg-42-146" n="42:146"/>today!

 I saw her at Dumfries some hours ago, and accompanied her a 20 miles;&#x2014;just shooting off for home at a stretch, hoping to arrive at Chelsea this night, and end her poor wanderings.
<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC wrote later: &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Monday,</hi> <date when="1865-07-24"><hi rend="italic">July</hi> 24</date>:&#x2014;Early in the forenoon I was waiting at Dumfries for her train Londonward; got into her carriage (empty otherwise), and sate talking and encouraging as I could to Annan (which would hardly be an hour). Servant Jessie was in the same train; also Jamie Aitken, junior, for Liverpool. I felt in secret extremely miserable; agitated she, no doubt, and even terrified, but resolute&#x2014;and <hi rend="italic">the lid shut down</hi>. I little thought it would be her last railway journey.&#x2014;T.C.&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note in Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi> 3:273).</note>
 I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> perceive she considerably regretted not having taken you at y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> kind word as to Alderley and a day of rest: but her plans had been formed, she owned to me, during a sleepless night, one post before <hi rend="italic">my</hi> program reached her (for I was about in Cumberland, and did not see y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Note to me till Friday last); &#x201C;and now I have made a <hi rend="italic">mull</hi> of it,&#x201D; said she, &#x201C;and there is no remedy!&#x201D; Some comfort it is that she is to get thro&#x2019; by the quickest conveyance, and have done with the thing at once</p>
<p>I was to send you her warmest congratulations (with my own) on the cleverness of that Fair Rosalind, and the beautiful Gift she has bro<hi rend="italic">t</hi> you all. May every blessing attend the Two now and henceforth! A word from Miss Stanley
<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Maude Stanley.</note>
 or some of you, on that latter point, w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be very welcome at Chelsea so soon as might be.</p>
<p>For myself I am now off, on Thursday or at latest Saturday morning, for the Orkneys and the Hebrides, for Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, Glasgow, &#x26;c &#x26;c; and to lead a wandering, chiefly aquatic life;&#x2014;and do not count on returning home till Aug<hi rend="italic">t</hi> end.

<p><salute>Dearest.</salute> All right! that is, all as I expected! When I chose to travel by <hi rend="italic">day</hi>, I knew I should have no sleep after. I sat up reading till three, it was no use, I felt to lie down&#x2014;then I went to bed and lay awake, without kicking about much, till morning; at seven I rang for my breakfast and eat some, and got up at nine and have been putting my things in the drawers with the efficient help of Jessie&#x2014; I dont suppose the night without sleep in my own bed can do me so much harm as that on the railway on the road down. But in the meantime I am very unfit for writing. I so hope D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Russell may prove mistaken about my right hand having gone to the dogs <hi rend="italic">for good</hi>! the loss of it hinders me at every turn! And I haven&#x2019;t even the consolation of having lost it in the service of my country!</p>
<p>At Carlisle we waited three quarters of an hour, and Jessie was told her third class ticket was &#x201C;no go&#x201D;&#x2014;there <hi rend="italic">being</hi> no third class from Carlisle to London by that train! So she was transferred into a secondclass carriage next me, and I had to pay fifteen and sixpence difference!</p>
<p>I perceived on the Platform, at Lancaster&#x2014;a man in grey pacing as if his foot was on his native pavement&#x2014;and took him for the Station Master&#x2014;tho&#x2019; looking upwards as tho&#x2019; meditating on &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">The Good the Beautiful and the True</hi>&#x201D;&#x2014; He looked at me once or twice, then stopt and&#x2014;it <hi rend="italic">was</hi> M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Symington

 He is so awfully interesting to <hi rend="italic">himself</hi> that man!
<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Symington recalled later: &#x201C;When Mrs. Carlyle was last in Scotland, I happened to travel in the same train by which she returned to London. About midnight, at a station where there was a stoppage of fifteen minutes, I had gone out to stretch my limbs, and, while pacing up and down the platform, heard myself called by name. &#x2026; On looking about &#x2026; I saw a lady signalling me from a carriage window; her head was muffled up in a light white woolen shawl, and she proved to be Mrs. Carlyle. On reaching Euston Square Station, I saw her into her own brougham which was waiting her arrival, and accepted a pressing invitation to drink tea with her the following evening, at Chelsea&#x201D; (A. J. Symington, <hi rend="italic">Some Personal Reminiscences of Carlyle</hi> [Paisley and London, <date when="1886-00-00">1886</date>] 26).</note>

A few days later TC commented on another article in the same issue, a review of Ruskin&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Sesame and Lilies</hi> by Anthony Trollope (see <ref target="volume-42/lt-18650727-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1865-07-27">27 July</date></ref>), but as he was highly critical of that piece it is unlikely that he referred to it here.</note>

 Well, it is better than it might have been a thousandfold; and I was right glad of y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> cheery and <hi rend="italic">pretty</hi> little Note (left hand as it was) before going out this morning.

<p><salute>Oh my Dear! my Dear!</salute> I wish to heaven I had the use of that hand again! for when I try to write or do anything with the left <hi rend="italic">without great plenty of leisure</hi> it shakes and threatens to strike work like the other!</p>
<p>I absolutely <hi rend="italic">couldnt</hi> write yesterday, and to make Jessie write would have made you think me either more unwell or more disagreeable than I was! The first night after my long journey&#x2014;I lay wholly awake as I was sure to do except when I travel by night and allow myself twelve hours to subside! Indeed knowing how it would be in bed I sat up reading till three in the morning! then I made a bold venture and took before lying down thirty drops of Morphia! I used to get good of an exceptional doze of this sort! Even that couldn&#x2019;t put me to sleep for a minute; but it gave me a sensation of <hi rend="italic">rest</hi> instead of <hi rend="italic">wildness</hi>&#x2014;and I lay patiently till seven when I rung for my breakfast. Last night I slept like the angels. In waking I had lost my identity and was saying to myself &#x201C;it can&#x2019;t be <hi rend="italic">me</hi> who have slept in this way&#x201D;!</p>

<p>Last night ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, tho&#x2019; in the best circ<hi rend="italic">s</hi>, I lost good part of my sleep; and awoke with gloomy views of the early start tomorrow, and the still earlier, after such hubbubs, &#x26; a bed at Granton Pier, next morning!

This locality is much more pleas<hi rend="italic">t</hi> to me than The Gill, my lodging too is favourable highly, in comparison: by the help of Noggs I can well make out a week or more here; from ten days to 2 weeks is the utmost of what I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> accomplish in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> (one week there w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> even be ample, were the lodging bad!): but one might have bathing, walks by the sea-shore, runs to Fife &#x26;c: in short, what I wish you now to try for me (ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> this day week or so) is the procurem<hi rend="italic">t</hi> of a sleeping-place in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>,&#x2014;to be ready by perhaps the end of next week;&#x2014;after wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> the other motions w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> follow of themselves.

<p><salute>Dearest,</salute>&#x2014;I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi>n&#x2019;t expect any Letter today; but I longed much to have seen one, with tidings that you <hi rend="italic">had</hi> slept the second night of y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> fatigues, and were doing well, or better than lately. I can only rock myself in the hope that Tomorrow will bring me good news both of second night and third. Don&#x2019;t forget tomorrow; you know it is the last chance we have till Tuesday next!&#x2014;</p>
<p>All my luck seems to have gone with y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> going. I cannot for these three nights get into the least routine of sleep ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi>; am provokingly torn up and insulted into fury by these railways (<hi rend="italic">here</hi> almost worse than at The Gill, tho&#x2019; they are a mile farther off);&#x2014;and was almost sorry this morning at 7 that I was <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to roll off to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> &#x26; into the voyaging chaos,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; on reconsiderat<hi rend="italic">n</hi> I felt I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have made a bad figure there. John, it seems, is going off directly <pb id="pg-42-153" n="42:153"/>to look into the Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Problem; expects to be <hi rend="italic">ready</hi> with the Insoluble early next week. I bade him consult Susan Hunter (Mrs Stirling) for me, and it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> prove soluble. Last night, in the paroxysms of starting up, I took my third blue-pill (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> rather did me good); today I am for a solo ride on Noggs thro&#x2019; the cool winds; I also contemplate some improve<hi rend="italic">ts</hi> in my bed-<hi rend="italic">hang</hi>ings; and by gen<hi rend="italic">l</hi> care, will hope to subdue the cast-metal monsters tonight. Saturday night &#x26; sunday they are by nature silent: thanks to Sabbath Venerat<hi rend="italic">n</hi> for that if for nothing else. And, on the whole, never mind me, Dearest; I have several strings to my bow, and shall get out unslain, one way or other.</p>
<p>Ruskin&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Sesame and Lillies</hi> must be a pretty little thing.
<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ruskin had sent a copy of <hi rend="italic">Sesame and Lilies</hi> to JWC at Holmhill; see <ref target="volume-42/lt-18650715-JWC-JR-01">JWC to JR, <date when="1865-07-15">15 July</date></ref>; presumably TC had not yet seen it.</note>
 Trollope,
<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Anthony Trollope, reviewing <hi rend="italic">Sesame and Lilies</hi> in the <hi rend="italic">Fortnightly Review</hi>, <date when="1865-07-15">15 July</date>, regretted that Ruskin, under the influence of Carlyle, had abandoned his role as an art critic in order &#x201C;to obtain a hearing as a political economist.&#x201D; In his view, Ruskin was unsuited to the role &#x201C;of a great preacher,&#x201D; unlike TC: &#x201C;teaching such as this comes well from Mr. Carlyle, although it sometimes comes in language overstrained and with deeper denunciation of existing Englishmen than existing Englishmen altogether deserve. Mr. Carlyle has for many years been denouncing sham workmen and sham heroes, and using all the powers of his eloquence to produce true work, and, if such may be forthcoming, true heroism also. He has been recognised by us as a preacher, and almost as a prophet, and if in the enthusiasm of his wrath he has allowed himself to be carried away by the ever-increasing strength of his own convictions, we are ready to pardon the abuse he showers upon us, on account of the good that we know that he has done to us. We have sat at his feet and have been instructed. We have listened to his words, and, as we have heard them, have made some inward resolution that they should guide us. But I doubt whether many men will receive Carlylesque denunciations from Mr. Ruskin with any good to their souls. He produces them, indeed, with the grace of poetic expression and the strength of well-arranged, vigorous words; but they do not contain that innate, conspicuous wisdom which alone can make such preachings efficacious. &#x2026; He has given us wonderful words on Art, which have had all the exactness of prose and almost all the grace of poetry. He has numbered his readers by tens of thousands, all of whom have seen with clearer eyes, and judged of Art with a truer judgment, because of his teaching. &#x2026; As it is, it is much to be hoped that he will return to that work which he can do better than any of his compeers&#x201D; (634, 635).</note>
 in reviewing it with considerable insolence stupidity &#x26; vulgarity, produces little specimens far beyond any Trollope Sphere of speculat<hi rend="italic">n</hi>. A dirtyish little pug, that Trollope; indescribably imbedded in commonplace, and grown fat upon it, &#x26; prosperous to an unwholesome degree. Don&#x2019;t <hi rend="italic">you</hi> return his love; nasty gritty creature, with no eye for &#x201C;the Beautiful the&#x201D; &#x26;c,&#x2014;and awfully &#x201C;interestingto himself,&#x201D; he too</p>
<p>Adieu,

<p>&#x201C;All goes well&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">still</hi>, Dearest. And this time nothing serious is <hi rend="italic">manquing</hi>

<p>The second night, as I expected, I slept &#x201C;beautiful&#x201D;! <hi rend="italic">Three hours</hi> without a break to begin with!&#x2014; When I woke from <hi rend="italic">that</hi> I not only didnt know <hi rend="italic">where</hi> I was; but didnt know <hi rend="italic">who</hi> I was!!! As I got out of bed (by force of habit) to look at my watch; I was saying to myself &#x201C;It can&#x2019;t be <hi rend="italic">me</hi> that has made this fine sleep!
<hi rend="small-caps">i must be somebody else</hi>
&#x201D;!!! It was a full minute, I am sure, before I could satisfy myself that I hadn&#x2019;t been changed into somebody else! Then I slept piecemeal till seven o&#x2019;clock, when I was startled erect by what seemed the House falling! Jessie came at my call, looking very guilty, and explained that it was she, who had been coming down stairs very softly for fear of waking me, and having new shoes on had &#x201C;slid and sossed down on her back&#x201D;! Just opposite my bedhead&#x2014; Luckily she was none the worse for the fall. A greater contrast than that young woman is to Fanny
<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Carlyles&#x2019; maid, dismissed in <date when="1865-06-00">June</date>.</note>
 cannot be figured! So quick so willing so intelligent: Never needs to be told a thing twice! and so warmly <hi rend="italic">human</hi>! My only fear about <hi rend="italic">her</hi> is that she will be married-up,
<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jessie did not get married until after JWC&#x2019;s death in <date when="1866-04-21">1866</date>.</note>
 away from me! M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Warren calls her &#x201C;My Dear&#x201D; and they get on charmingly together.</p>
<p>The person who addressed the newspaper to you at &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">Coming Trees</hi>&#x2019;
<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For Cummertrees.</note>
 was Fanny who had called to ask if I would &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">See</hi> a Lady&#x201D; for her: and M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Warren being busy asked <hi rend="italic">her</hi> to address the newspaper.</p>
<p>On Tuesday Bellona, who had been warned a week before, came round at one, and after some shopping I called at Grosvenor Street and found Miss Bromley at home. A satisfaction which I owed to the youngest of the three Pugs &#x201C;Jocky,&#x201D;
<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For a photograph of another of Miss Bromley&#x2019;s pugs, Spark, see <ref target="volume-39/lt-18630922-JWC-LLA-01"><sic>39:201</sic><corr>JWC to LLA, <date when="1863-09-22">22 Sept. 1863</date></corr></ref>.</note>
 who was &#x201C;suffering from the heat&#x201D;! She was delighted to see me: most anxious I should come to her at Folkstone! and told me to my great joy, that Lady A had
<hi rend="small-caps">not</hi>
 started on the 21<hi rend="italic">st</hi>,

 wasnt going till Thursday (today)&#x2014;was staying at Bath House
<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lady Ashburton&#x2019;s London home.</note>
 &#x2014;but gone that morning to Bath for one day. I left a card and message at Bath house on the road home. Yesterday (Wednesday) <pb id="pg-42-155" n="42:155"/>I drove to Bath House the first thing; when I went out at one; and found the Lady looking lovely in a spruce little <hi rend="italic">half mourning</hi> bonnet! and so loving! and she <hi rend="italic">would</hi> &#x201C;if it was within the bounds of possibility&#x201D; come to me in the evening &#x201C;between ten and eleven.&#x201D; and I went in <hi rend="italic">her</hi> carriage with her (my own following) to Norfolk Street (M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Anstruther&#x2019;s)
<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lady Ashburton&#x2019;s sister, Mary Frances Anstruther.</note>
 to see Baby
<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lady Ashburton&#x2019;s da., Mary Florence.</note>
 who is going with her mother to Germany after all&#x2014; I left her there, and got into my own carriage and went and bought my Birthday present&#x2014;with the sovereign&#x2014;at least I laid out fifteen shillings of it.&#x2014; on what?&#x2014; My Dear! The thing I bought was most appropriate and rather <hi rend="italic">touching</hi>! I drove to the great shop in Conduit Street, where the world is supplied with &#x201C;Trusses&#x201D; &#x201C;Laced Stockings&#x201D;&#x2014;and mechanical appliances for every species of human derangement
<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William S. F. Sparks, 28 Conduit St., New Bond St., surgical bandage and truss maker.</note>
 &#x2014;and bought a dainty little <hi rend="italic">Sling</hi> for my arm!! The mere ribbon round my neck hurt my neck and drew my head down. This fastens across the back and is altogether a superior contrivance! I dont believe in D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Russells prediction any more than you do! At all rates there was <hi rend="italic">no call on him</hi> to <hi rend="italic">state</hi> so hopeless a view of the question! when I was not asking his opinion at all! It could do no <hi rend="italic">harm</hi> to leave me the consolation of hope! But I
<hi rend="small-caps">will</hi>
 hope in spite of Him! Indeed it seems to me that ever since he said I should never get the use of my hand nor get rid of the pain there; that a Spirit of protest and opposition has animated the poor hand and set it on trying to do things it had some time ceased from doing!!</p>
<p>And Lady A did come last night Came at half after eleven! and staid till near one! M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Anstruther was left sitting in the carriage and sent up to say &#x201C;it was on the stroke of twelve&#x201D;&#x2014; And then with Lady A&#x2019;s permission I invited her up&#x2014;and if it had not been for her I dont think Lady A would have gone <hi rend="italic">till</hi> daylight! She said in going &#x201C;My regards&#x2014;my&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">what</hi> shall I send to <hi rend="italic">Him</hi> (you)&#x2014;&#x201D; &#x201C;Oh, I said send him a kiss!&#x201D;&#x2014; &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">That is just what I should like</hi> she said but would he not think it forward&#x201D;&#x2014; &#x201C;Oh dear! not at all&#x201D; I said&#x2014; So you are to consider yourself <hi rend="italic">kissed</hi>&#x2014;</p>
<p>I am going up to Bath House <hi rend="italic">now</hi>&#x2014; She goes at night</p>
<p>Lady Stanley writes to ask how I am and to beg that you will come <hi rend="italic">that</hi> way.</p>
<p>What a long letter!</p>
<p>I ought to have saidthat all this did not give me a <hi rend="italic">bad</hi> night&#x2014; Of course I did not sleep as on the preceeding night but better than I <hi rend="italic">ever</hi> did at Holmhill&#x2014;and the pain in my arm is really less since I came home&#x2014;</p>

<p><salute>Thanks, Dearest,</salute> for the glorious news wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> saluted me this morning, &#x26; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I read with such pleasure before getting out of bed! Two nights of sleep, one of them &#x201C;beautiful,&#x201D;&#x2014;I fear I must not look for an equally favourable bulletin tomorrow: but, on the whole, things do seem looking up with us. I too have at length got a night of sleep ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi> (thanks to precautions, and partly to the <hi rend="italic">wind</hi>, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> itself drowns those murderous railways, or blesses their screaming with the wholesome <hi rend="italic">sough</hi> of the woods and elements);&#x2014;so that I can heartily partake in whatever good is going. Very pleasant to me, all you report of Chelsea &#x26; London,&#x2014;not quite omitting the symbolic <hi rend="italic">kiss</hi> of that ever bounteous Lady. Ask Miss Bromley if she did get her Book;

<p>In your letter of this morning you say you cannot hear again till Tuesday. So I went and wrote to M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Russell&#x2014;and now, when close on <hi rend="italic">one</hi>, at which hour the carriage will come, it strikes me &#x201C;
<hi rend="small-caps">why</hi>
 not till Tuesday?&#x201D; this being Friday! and in hopes you may have made a mistake, I write a few hasty lines still, that you may have the assurance of my continued well being at the earliest possible moment, to set off against your own ill being poor Dear! I am so vexed about that sleep!&#x2014; But perhaps you, like myself, will <hi rend="italic">feel</hi> for the first time that you have got good of your wanderings when you have ended them in your own bed. For me; I am so much better since my return home! I dont indeed go on sleeping as I did that blessed second night!&#x2014;but every night has been blissful compared with those horrid nights at Holmhill; and, as follows in course, the pain of my arm is greatly abated.</p>
<p>I am going off just now to report myself to kind D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Quain. He knows I am come home&#x2014; Lady A said he had been asking at her about me. I spent half an hour with her at Bath House just before she started yesterday afternoon

<salute>My dear Lady Stanley</salute>
<p>I am afraid that all this pain and sleeplessness is impairing my <hi rend="italic">In</hi>tellect! Just conceive the absurd stupidity of me! You said in your kind note; to bid somebody about me write and tell you how I was! now, certain young Ladies who were good enough to write to my dictation, before I left London,
<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Geraldine Jewsbury, b. <date when="1812-00-00">1812</date>, wrote letters for JWC (see <ref target="volume-42/lt-18650603-GEJ-KST-01">GEJ to Lady Am <corr>[KST]</corr>, <date when="1865-06-03">3 June</date></ref>, and <ref target="volume-42/lt-18650607-GEJ-TC-01">GEJ to TC, <date when="1865-06-07">7 June</date></ref>), as did one of the Mrs. Macmillans, b. <date when="1821-00-00">1821</date> and <date when="1824-00-00">1824</date>, (see <ref target="volume-42/lt-18650608-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, <date when="1865-06-08">8 June</date></ref>); JWC may also have been thinking of Maggie Welsh, b. <date when="1821-00-00">1821</date>, who wrote many letters on her cousin&#x2019;s behalf, <date when="1864-02-00">Feb.</date>&#x2013;<date when="1864-04-00">April 1864</date>; see <ref target="volume-40/lt-18640206-MW-LLA-01"><sic>40:11</sic><corr>MW to LLA, [<date when="1864-02-06">6 Feb.? 1864</date>]</corr></ref>; JWC was using a certain poetic license as none of them could really count as &#x201C;young Ladies.&#x201D;</note>
 have gone in different directions; and there has been really nobody about me that I could <hi rend="italic">employ</hi>. What would have occurred, then to an ordinary mind under the circumstances, would have been to just write <hi rend="italic">my</hi>self, after such fashion as I could! And, will you believe me, the possibility of such a solution never entered my head till this hour! But I have waited, waited for the &#x201C;coming&#x201D; amanuensis, that never came!!</p>
<p>My left hand gets on worse than usual, after that day of shaking on the railway! So pardon its imperfections! There is no imperfection in the thanks I feel to you, for you offered help towards smoothing my difficulties No adverse accident befell! I did not even lose any part of my luggage! Only&#x2014;I sat up reading till three of the morning, on reaching home! and then lay on my bed awake till the servants got up, when I rung for breakfast. I never manage to sleep a wink after so long a railway journey! But the <hi rend="italic">next</hi> night! <hi rend="italic">Didn&#x2019;t</hi> I sleep like the Angels! or D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Pritchard

 On waking after three or four hours of that wonderful unbroken rest, I had not only lost knowledge of <hi rend="italic">where</hi> I was; but of <hi rend="italic">who</hi> I was! My first thought was delightfully Irish! It was; &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">this</hi> cant be <hi rend="italic">me</hi> who have had such a nice long sleep! I must be somebody else&#x201D;!</p>
<p>My arm has been less painful since that blessed sleep&#x2014;than any time these two months back! And yesterday I cut my own food, and&#x2014;put on my own stockings!! a triumph of female W
<hi rend="small-caps">ill</hi>
! For the night before I left Scotland my D<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, without my asking him any questio[n] took the curious idea to inform me that the neuralgia pain in my arm would &#x201C;probably wear itself out&#x2014;in time! But that I might lay my account with the stiffness and painfulness of the <hi rend="italic">hand</hi>, (in which there was <hi rend="italic">gout</hi>) continuing&#x201D; &#x201C;You mean, I asked, that I am to lay my account with having no use of my right hand any more in Life?&#x201D;&#x2014; &#x201C;Well! <pb id="pg-42-161" n="42:161"/><hi rend="italic">yes</hi>!&#x201D;&#x2014; &#x201C;Well, then,
<hi rend="small-caps">no</hi>
! I <hi rend="italic">wont</hi> lay my account with any such thing. I
<hi rend="small-caps">will</hi>
 have back my hand,&#x201D; say what you may!&#x201D;&#x2014;and it is curious; but the <hi rend="italic">Spirit of Contradiction</hi>, which seemed to rush over me to the finger ends, acted like a shock of electricity on the lamed hand, bracing it up to do or attempt things that had seemed impossible. And so I have arrived at putting on my own stockings &#x26;c &#x26;c!</p>
<p>I shall be so glad to hear of the other event having been transacted as successfully!

<salute>Dear Inglis,</salute>
<p>I have been hereabouts for 7 or 8 weeks; endeavouring, not with brilliant success, to find some rest and recreation for myself, after the long pull of 12 years in harness, mostly at a dead lift. This week some time, I intend for Edinburgh, there to loiter ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> for certain days,&#x2014;at my own sweet will so far as possible.</p>
<p>I remember well y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> kind invitat<hi rend="italic">n</hi> to the Melrose region;
<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Inglis&#x2019;s home, Torsonce, Stow, was 24 mi. (39 km.) SE of Edinburgh, with Melrose a further 12 mi. (19 km.) SE.</note>
 tho&#x2019; at present I am so brittle a piece of goods, I fear much that will not be possible for me. But if you are in Town; and if you c<hi rend="italic">d</hi>, in y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> house there,
<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Inglis previously lived at 16 Queen St., Edinburgh, where he still practiced law.</note>
 or by y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> resources otherwise, <hi rend="italic">provide for me a human bedroom</hi> (i.e., sleeping-place, nocturnally quiet and well-aired),&#x2014;bedroom, and nothing more whatever of the hospitable sort,&#x2014;it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be a real and memorable kindness to the worst Sleeper in the world! Any way, I of course calculate on seeing you, at more length than for a long time past.</p>
<p>Pray let me have a word from you by return of post. I remain always</p>

<p><salute>Dearest,</salute> I tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> perhaps there might be a Newspaper this morning (despatched on Sat<hi rend="italic">y</hi>); more I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not look for; and it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have told me little. I must hope that Tomorrow will bring me news; pray only that they be good! The weather, to judge by what <hi rend="italic">we</hi> have of it, is bright and airy, not unduly hot, and ought to be very wholesome. The shining <hi rend="italic">transparency</hi> of our element, the definite <hi rend="italic">purity</hi> of all things in earth and air, surprises me every morning: very pleasant to see the old Hill tops re-emerge all round me, as if in welcome &#x26; adieu, as I climb the Dairlaw Hill
<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Darlaw Hill, about 1 mi. (1.5 km.) N of Scotsbrig.</note>
 upland before breakfast;&#x2014;pleasant, yet sad &#x26; touching. Indeed my main delights here are merely topographical; Noggs (much better <hi rend="italic">cleaned</hi> than at The Gill, &#x26; in scenes wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> are far more memorable to me) gallops beautifully ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi>; and there c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be elsewhere no such riding for me,&#x2014;for the few days till I have <hi rend="italic">seen</hi> everything. The <hi rend="italic">inanimate</hi> friends; almost the only kind I have now remaining! Poor Jamie has grown very sad &#x26; saturnine; much bereaved &#x26; lonely in his old days;
<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC&#x2019;s brother James&#x2019;s wife, Isabella, d. <date when="1859-00-00">1859</date>; his da. Jenny was married and now living in Birmingham.</note>
 and indeed very sorrowful, I can perceive, tho&#x2019; he complains of nothing; and is outwardly prospering. It is seldom I can engage him in any fruitful conversat<hi rend="italic">n</hi>; tho&#x2019; sometimes I do; and the two Lads,
<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James and John Carlyle.</note>
 especially Jamie jun<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, seem to be intellig<hi rend="italic">t</hi> well-condit<hi rend="italic">ed</hi> creatures. Mary is the most assid<hi rend="italic">s</hi> of valets; her Daughter an excell<hi rend="italic">t</hi> silent dilig<hi rend="italic">t</hi> young Lass;
<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mary&#x2019;s da. Catherine was housekeeper at Scotsbrig; see <ref target="volume-42/lt-18650613-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1865-06-13">13 June</date></ref>.</note>
 &#x26; has the house in better order than almost any house like it. In short, I have <hi rend="italic">recovered my sleep</hi>, Dear (Oh that you c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> say as much); and am well off here for the few days that are still ahead!</p>
<p>John makes no move<hi rend="italic">t</hi> towards Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>; is all agog just now ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> a <hi rend="italic">dinner</hi> with Stewart of Hillside (for self and <hi rend="italic">me</hi>), in wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi>, tho&#x2019; I like old Stewart, my particip<hi rend="italic">n</hi> is by no means cert<hi rend="italic">n</hi>.

 (or some country-place he has), but suggesting the great fav<hi rend="italic">r</hi> of a sleeping-room (<hi rend="italic">per se</hi>) in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>;&#x2014;wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> will perhaps bring a <hi rend="italic">solut</hi>n of the &#x201C;impossible.&#x201D; To creaky Foxton,
<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Frederick Foxton wrote to TC, <date when="1865-07-26">26 July</date>, from Rhayader in Wales: &#x201C;I expected for some weeks after I wrote to you that you would have sent me a few words to say <hi rend="italic">when</hi> you would come to me, or given me your Scotch address to enable me to write to you. &#x2026; It will now give me the greatest possible pleasure to see you here whenever it suits your convenience, &#x26; I shall only be the better able to entertain you in this wild place, if you will give me a week&#x2019;s previous notice of the day of your arrival.&#x201D;</note>

<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word repeated at turn of page.</note>
 yet written: I almost fear I shall have to give him up in coming home; so haggly, changeful, seems the road to him to be. Here, Darling, are abund<hi rend="italic">t</hi> details surely, and all ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> one thrice-import<hi rend="italic">t</hi> man!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Poor John here (ill of a suppurated ear just now, but a good young soul) begged of me a &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Carte</hi> of my Aunt, if he have any!&#x201D; I had just one (a <hi rend="italic">Watkins</hi>, &#x26; not the best); this he got, with a <hi rend="italic">wide-awake</hi> of myself: Mary then reminded me of <hi rend="italic">two</hi> couples that were wanted in Canada for her two Households there,
<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mary&#x2019;s da. Grace and her husband, William Yeoward, were in Canada; the other household is unidentified, unless that of TC and Mary&#x2019;s sister, Janet Hanning, and her husband, Robert. For a photograph of TC in his wideawake hat, see 13.</note>
 &#x2014;whereupon I had to produce two (small) of myself, and, for Goody, to bequeath two (baddish Heads) that have stood on the mantelpiece at The Gill all this while, &#x26; had been left there. Rec<hi rend="italic">d</hi> with thankfulness excessive. To Jamie jun<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, I gave one copy of the <hi rend="italic">Daguerrotype</hi> (much recognised here as a Likeness); so that now one other copy of that is all I have left. Are not here an interest<hi rend="italic">g</hi> set of details&#x2014;written <hi rend="italic">in vacuo</hi> [in a vacuum]? I may at least give over!&#x2014;</p>
<p>If you will say only &#x201C;I am sleeping well,&#x201D; I will forgive you everything. Alas, I am reckoning with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> my host, all this while; &#x26; ought not to hope,perhaps, as I do! God bless thee</p>

<p>I have written to Ch<hi rend="italic">s</hi> Stewart (not a quite joyful operat<hi rend="italic">n</hi> to me, with a <hi rend="italic">hand</hi> so little under rein!)&#x2014;I said we sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> appear at Hillside &#x201C;some time ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi>&#x201D; 2 p.m., &#x26; c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> stay till after 6.</p>
<p>The news from Jane are good; I too have recov<hi rend="italic">d</hi> sleep. If you c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> bring me a &#xBC; lb of the <hi rend="italic">mixed</hi> kind of Dumfr<hi rend="italic">s</hi> tobacco you smoke, it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be better than any I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> get here. I think of leaving this soon,&#x2014;and am in treaty with Henry Inglis for a sleeping-place;&#x2014;but nothing isyet cert<hi rend="italic">n</hi>.</p>
<p>In great haste (with my kindest regards to Sister Jean and everybody)</p>

<p>What belated your letter that it didn&#x2019;t arrive till the two o&#x2019;clock post&#x2014;after I was gone out? Getting no news in the morning and being up to the eyes in <hi rend="italic">The Books</hi>,

 I felt justified in passinga day&#x2014;on the pretext of not being quite sure of your whereabout.</p>
<p>I must now beconcise and to the purpose; the day being too short for all the affairs I have on hand! First, of my sleep:&#x2014;I really begin to sleep like a human being!&#x2014; If this would last a week or two, my arm would be cured and even my hand already the pain is so much diminished that I don&#x2019;t <hi rend="italic">dream</hi> of it in my sleep! and I can do a lot of things with my hand:&#x2014;can put on my stockings! can lift a spoon to my mouth! can tie on my bonnet! &#x26;c &#x26;c&#x2014;</p>

<p><salute>Darling,</salute>&#x2014;Y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Letter is ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi> a great blessing to me. What a change, to be getting something like actual &#x201C;human sleep&#x201D;; with the sore arm and all miseries, as is natural, gradually abating! Only continue that for a week or two, and all will be well again, &#x26; Dr R&#x2019;s prophecy no better than a Dr Cumming one!

 Well done.&#x2014;&#x2014; The reason of no delivery till 2 p.m. must be that somebody undertook, having an errand at Ecclefechan, to post y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> note there;&#x2014;and did post not &#x201C;before 6 p.m,&#x201D; but only before 10.

<p>Yesterday (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> makes y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> blank today) I did the small Charles Stuart adventure; with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> difficulty of any kind, being borne on by Jamie jun<hi rend="italic">r</hi> to Lockerby, then by John to Hillside, in &#x201C;one&#x2019;s own gig&#x201D;; and meeting the old gent<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, now near 80, still very fresh, and one of the cleverest of living Annandalers, a little in advance on the road looking out for us. I saw Dryfe Water (clear as Olive oil) Dryfe Valley, clean, trim, green and happy-looking; drove to Hook

 &#x2014; Well, I must just hope that nothing has gone awry; and that Tomorrow (don&#x2019;t forget &#x201C;Tomorrow,&#x201D; our last friend, last of the week!) will bring me confirmation of something good. Continuance of what the last tidings were is all I can wish. My own life here is quiescence itself; ride upon Noggs thro&#x2019; some old long-remembered little tract of earth, this and the three walks are all the events of a day. Noggs, in this land of foreign exile and mere novelty, manifests the liveliest adherence to <hi rend="italic">me</hi> his sole friend &#x26; remaining connexion with things known,&#x2014;poor little four-footed wretch. I think it will certainly be Tuesday when the Doctor will announce, &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Eureka</hi>, a room in Hanover Street; for Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> this morning at 9.13 from Ecclef<hi rend="italic">n</hi>!&#x201D; Wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I shall really be rather loth for; but must obey. My <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi> is ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi> mine; I am the idlest and most <hi rend="italic">cont</hi>ented of men, w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> things but let me alone, and Time stay still! The clearness of the air here, the old Hilltops and grassy silences: it is with a strange acquiescence that I fancy myself as bidding probably <hi rend="italic">farewell</hi> to them for the last time. Annandale is gone out for me; lies all stark and dead,&#x2014;as I shall soon do too: why not? &#x2014; Tuesday morning, re-<pb id="pg-42-171" n="42:171"/>collect: in fact, you had better direct <hi rend="italic">y</hi>r <hi rend="italic">Monday</hi> Letter, &#x201C;Care of Dr Carlyle / 67 Hanover Street Edinburgh&#x201D;; I shall be surer of finding it at once <hi rend="italic">there</hi>,&#x2014;so far as I can yet speir out what is to be expected from John <hi rend="italic">tomorrow</hi>. Item if you like to send me anything on Sunday, put it into the Cheyne Walk Pillar before 7 p.m., and I shall get it next morning here.</p>
<p>I have not accepted H<hi rend="italic">y</hi> Inglis&#x2019;s Stow, but probably shall,&#x2014;at least if hard up in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>. Tomorrow Jamie and I are for Craigenputtock (a kind of <hi rend="italic">duty</hi> if one c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> but do it!)&#x2014;there is no difficulty except the early hour of the morning, &#x26; the haggle lasting till &#x201C;Ecclef<hi rend="italic">n</hi> 9.30 p.m.&#x201D; ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi>. &#x201C;Fais <hi rend="italic">quelque chose</hi> pour toi-même, grand Duc; fais-toi la barbe!&#x201D;

<p>Oh my dear a line will be better than nothing&#x2014;but I have only time for a line! I have been so busy ever since I got up at eight o&#x2019;clock: and have taken no account of the time; and now suddenly I was horrified to find it a quarter to four o&#x2019;clock and at four Bellona comes to take me to Streatham to dine with the Macmillans by appointment.</p>
<p>But, beyondthat I go on in the same tolerable style. I have nothing of any moment to say and that can be said in one line! There need be no reflections here for want of coolness; for the last three days we have had plashes of rain and less heat than I could wish!</p>
<p>Three nights ago, having gone to bed with my window half a yard open and two blankets I awoke like a lump of ice! Afraid that the <hi rend="italic">chill</hi> would be hurtful to my arm, I got up and closed the window all but an inch and then went into the Drawingroom for whisky Even <hi rend="italic">that</hi> bringing no heat, I went for Miss Bromley&#x2019;s Eider-down quilt&#x2014;and at last came alive. I put another blanket next day.</p>
<p>I called for Forster yesterday and found him with his face all muffled up&#x2014;and bemoaning himself like&#x2014;like&#x2014;anything!

<dateline>Scotsbrig, Ecclefechan, <date when="1865-08-06">6 Aug<hi rend="italic">t</hi> 1865</date></dateline>
<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
	<p>I came down into these parts in the <date when="1865-05-00">end of May</date>, with a view of resting myself, and trying for a little recovery of strength and health, after the long deadly tug of pulling (12 years long!) at that last Book of mine. Hitherto I do not feel as if the duration had been very successful; I have had a great deal of bother ab<hi rend="italic">t sleep</hi> &#x26;c, and often enough have been low and dreary in this dear old Birthland now so changed and solitary to me: but perhaps on getting home, I shall really find that I have got some little benefit;&#x2014;at any rate the thing had to be done; for almost five years past I have always been saying to myself, &#x201C;Were this sad labour finished, I will see poor old Annandale ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi> and the friends I still have there!&#x201D;&#x2014; Most of my time has been spent at The Gill, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> was the quietest and much the loneliest place, where indeed I was left almost altogether to myself, to saunter about with such tho<hi rend="italic">ts</hi> as you in my own head, and the sorrow and gloom of one&#x2019;s mind c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> go to its full length and be <hi rend="italic">as sorrowful</hi> as it liked. The truth is, I am much worn out; also very old; and ought now to know well that the <hi rend="italic">end</hi> cannot and even sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not be far off. For the last two weeks I have been at Scotsbrig; am for Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> in the course <pb id="pg-42-173" n="42:173"/>of two days (John, who is at Dumfries all this while, has appointed to accompany me thither); in and ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> we calculate to loiter perhaps a fortnight more; after wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I am for home ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi>,&#x2014;then to set my house in order a little, and see what farther I will do. Before leaving Scotsbrig I had long resolved to send you some kind of Letter dated there; and this at last is it,&#x2014;in spite of a <hi rend="italic">shaking</hi> hand, and other impediments wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> render writing disagreeable to me just now. I inclose a Photograph wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> represents me pretty truly, well on in my 70th year:&#x2014;your Photograph I have safe in my bedroom at Chelsea, and a great treasure to me it is (very recognisable to me, and not so changed as one might expect);
<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC probably referred to an earlier photograph of Alexander; for a photograph of Alexander and Janet Carlyle in old age, see <ref target="volume-42/lt-18650914-TC-JAC-01"><sic>221</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1865-09-14">14 Sept.</date></corr></ref></note>
 in me &#x26; over all the kindred there is an eager desire and <hi rend="italic">expectat</hi>n of getting a good few others representative of the seniors &#x26; juniors in that Canad<hi rend="italic">n</hi> Household we have all such an interest in. See that you don&#x2019;t disappoint us in this!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Our kindred here may be described as going on in a singularly equable manner; prosperous, all of them, rather than otherwise; and being not spared hitherto in the contstant ravagings of Time. In Ecclefechan there are hardly three people alive whom I can remember at all from my young years. A country changed wholly; nothing but the old <hi rend="italic">localities</hi> now left,&#x2014;the sight of wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> has been a continual interest to me, sad and strange, in my ridings up and down. Day before yesterday, for instance, I rode by Sandbed, Whins &#x26;c,
<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sandbed, farm in Middlebie parish; Whins, farm 1 mi. (1.5 km.) S of Ecclefechan.</note>
 and home by &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Jean&#x2019;s</hi> Bar&#x201D;
<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly a toll-gate; unidentified further.</note>
 (&#x201C;Jean&#x201D; quite vanished with much else): at Sandbed I remembered to have passed the place, on some Mainhill Pony, almost 50 years ago; under the quiet sky, in the old house still standing, poor old &#x201C;Sandbed&#x201D; was making worship, &#x26; I heard the sound of his psalm:
<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Carlyle (ca. <date when="1742-00-00">1742</date>&#x2013;<date when="1835-00-00">1835</date>), father of TC&#x2019;s father&#x2019;s first wife; TC&#x2019;s remembered ride probably took place in late <date when="1825-05-00">May 1825</date>; see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350430-TC-JAC-01"><sic>8:102</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1835-04-30">30 April 1835</date></corr></ref>.</note>
 only once since, in a drive you once took me from Ecclef<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> I remember to have passed that place. Ah me, ah me!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Jamie has grown old, grave and sad, in comparison with formerly; but for the rest, is prosperous &#x26; diligent in the <hi rend="italic">new</hi> mode of Husbandry now introduced in these parts,&#x2014;that is to say in raising cattle &#x26; sheep at higher and higher prices, for the Liverpool &#x26; other manufacturing Stomachs; that of <hi rend="italic">grain</hi>-husbandry being almost wholly abandoned by those that have a little <hi rend="italic">money</hi> for shifting into the new course. Grain (such the extent of <hi rend="italic">import</hi> from Foreign Countries) was never seen so cheap in man&#x2019;s memory, nor butcher&#x2019;s-meat &#x26;c a third part so dear. Perhaps ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> 3 each way may pretty much express the astonishing change of prices since these &#x201C;free-trades&#x201D; and raging railways <pb id="pg-42-174" n="42:174"/>began running.
<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The repeal of the Corn Laws, <date when="1849-00-00">1849</date>, and improved transport by rail and sea led to large quantities of grain from the U.S. and eastern Europe being imported into Britain, considerably lowering prices.</note>
 People that <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> change (poor Jock of Stennybeck,
<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Blacklock (ca. <date when="1807-00-00">1807</date>&#x2013;<date when="1875-00-00">75</date>), farmer, of Stennybeck, or Stoneybeck, farm &#xBD; mi.

 from you. Tomorrow actually to get under way;&#x2014;and not the least thing yet packed; the horror of all that still glaring in upon the lazy soul of me: my words here must be <hi rend="italic">brief</hi>. John joins me at Lockerby we don&#x2019;t arrive till 6 p.m.; no time for a Letter: but I will put in a <hi rend="italic">Public Opin</hi>n (the same you sent), in sign that I am safe there, as I hoped to be. With H<hi rend="italic">y</hi> Inglis&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Stow</hi> I do not mean to tackle at all (unless the Lodging be sleepless), or at least not till perhaps the Sat<hi rend="italic">y</hi> &#x26; Sunday coming. Directly after that, Erskine is due, and my beggarly &#x201C;engage<hi rend="italic">ts</hi>,&#x201D; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> have hung so tedious upon <hi rend="italic">dates</hi>, are at an end in these parts.</p>
<p>On Saturday Craigenputtock was done, as per program,&#x2014;from 7 a.m. till 9&#xBD; p.m home ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, the bus<hi rend="italic">ss</hi> lasted, and was not of an exhilarating nature, tho&#x2019; nothing miswent, &#x26; the country, especially the drive from Irongray to Stroquhan,

 was altogether beautiful: but on the whole I had lost most of my night&#x2019;s sleep by starting at 7 (<hi rend="italic">woke</hi> at 4!) and lost d<hi rend="italic">o</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">next</hi> night by the fussing &#x26; fidgetting I had had,&#x2014;such a giant of a fellow am I! However, all that is rectified, and straight ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi> for <hi rend="italic">two</hi> nights: and I am very glad I went; for the sad old Hermitage was full of memories &#x26; interests to me; &#x26; there were some <hi rend="italic">practical</hi> things that altogether did require looking into. The poor place is woodier, darker, sleepier-looking than ever; and was lying much in litter <pb id="pg-42-176" n="42:176"/>and neglect in all <hi rend="italic">external</hi> partic<hi rend="italic">rs</hi>. The Tenant has it, I believe, ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> &#xa3;100 too cheap; and seems to be an idle fellow, continually <hi rend="italic">gigging</hi> ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> the country instead of plying besom at home. Whitsunday come a year, he will find himself pulled up to the due tightness, or sent walking elsewhither:&#x2014;and as for the pressing &#x26; stringent point of the untended woods I have (with effort) hit upon a scheme for having that satisfactorily done,&#x2014;and &#x201C;the good many hundreds&#x201D; of <hi rend="italic">dead</hi> larches faithfully cut away, &#x26; changed into money.

<salute>Best and dearest of Friends!</salute>
<p>It was a good moment when I received that letter from over the Sea It <hi rend="italic">does</hi> intensify strangely the feeling of separation when a great tract of <hi rend="italic">Sea</hi> lies between! especially for a rare Individual like me who has never seen beyond this Island&#x2014; You seem hidden away from me &#x2018;over the Water,&#x2019; not only hidden from my bodily eyes but from the eyes of my Imagination I cannot picture you out in a Country where I have never been&#x2014;as I can in an English or Scotch House! and so I will be mortal glad to know you at Bath House again or even at Melchet! But if you get good of your foreign sojourn&#x2014;no matter how badly I weary for you! M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C is still in the North&#x2014;at Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> this day I believe; and to be at Linlathen on the 15<hi rend="italic">th</hi>. Where his stay will be of the shortest I fancy&#x2014;judging from what I hear of the persons invited to meet him. Miss Bromley wrote inviting him to Folkstone; and he had answered, she says, &#x201C;in the vaguest possible <pb id="pg-42-178" n="42:178"/>manner.&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">I</hi> go to Her at Folkstone on Monday next (14<hi rend="italic">th</hi>). That Place will be sad for me at first. The only time I was ever there before was when I went to <hi rend="italic">You</hi>! And Lord Ashburton was well then, and so kind to me!&#x2014;but when was He ever other than kind to me? And Miss Bromley was a Stranger for me; whom I <hi rend="italic">there</hi> made friends with!

 was lying ahead of me, and I had no fear&#x2014;thought nothing could befal me worse than <hi rend="italic">Death</hi>! Yes! I shall have many thoughts in bath-chairing about Folkstone again!</p>
<p>But it will be well to have the dust I have been gathering in sorting about three thousand volumes of M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C&#x2019;s books with my own hands

<p>Again you have had no letter Dear! But, in compensation, all the ink-spots are out of your writing table!! Had It been going straight to any Literary Museum, I shouldn&#x2019;t have meddled with the
<hi rend="small-caps">ink</hi>
, which Hero-worshipers might have regarded with <hi rend="italic">a certain</hi> adoration; but for your <hi rend="italic">own</hi> use, I thought you would like it better <hi rend="italic">clean</hi>! It has never been cleaned, that poor table,

 since I used to do all the Housemaid work myself! And it is a wonder of Heaven that I should be up to such work again&#x2014;after all! and I cannot better express my thankfulness than in <hi rend="italic">working</hi> while I may! So I fastened on that table after breakfast this morning, and rubbed at it the whole time till the carriage came at two! Of course Jessie could have waxed and turpentined the table better than me; but no one but me, I flatter myself could have shown the patience and ingenuity necessary for extracting all that ink!&#x2014;</p>
<p>You will infer that I am going on well as to my arm, my sleep, and all that. I have really had not <hi rend="italic">one</hi> downright <hi rend="italic">bad</hi> night since I came home&#x2014;except the first. The pain is almost entirely gone out of my arm and hand. But the stiffness continues&#x2014;and is easy to bear! I <hi rend="italic">can</hi> use some of my fingers&#x2014;a little. I am now writing with the lamed hand!

 But I cannot <hi rend="italic">take hold</hi>; nor could I raise my arm to my head if it were to save my life.</p>
<p>If it were not that almost everybody I know is &#x201C;out of Town[&#x201D;] I should <pb id="pg-42-181" n="42:181"/>rather regret having promised to go to Folkstone on Monday. But it is to be hoped that the Sea breezes will blow the dust of those Books off me!

<p>Another proof of wellness I am going <hi rend="italic">alone</hi>! I find I can now do everything, in dressing, with my left hand, except twisting up my back hair and putting the comb in; and Miss Bromley&#x2019;s House maid can do <hi rend="italic">that</hi> much for me in one minute. Jessie sees a great deal of cleaning needed, and will get at it better when the regular work of the House is not going on&#x2014; T

TC previously wrote to Inglis about a post for James, <date when="1864-12-00">Dec. 1864</date>; see <ref target="volume-41/lt-18641207-TC-HI-01"><sic>41:122&#x2013;23</sic><corr>TC to HI, <date when="1864-12-07">7 Dec. 1864</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-41/lt-18641216-TC-JAC-01"><sic>41:127</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1864-12-16">16 Dec. 1864</date></corr></ref>.</note>
 (of wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> when we meet);&#x2014;and, for another thing, Inglis eagerly accepts <hi rend="italic">Noggs</hi> from me as a Gift, and will really be proud &#x26; careful of the poor quadruped; &#x201C;never, to sell him,&#x2014;shall <hi rend="italic">die</hi> when his hour comes, only by sudden powder &#x26; ball.&#x201D; Wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> also ends comfortably an embarrass<hi rend="italic">t</hi> of mine.</p>
<p>On the Saturday, before starting, I took cab with Jack, and on pleas<hi rend="italic">t</hi> terms drove first to Betty then to y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Aunts.

But Betty, poor old faithful Betty, she was the interesting object; set me really almost crying; and indeed is, I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> say, the notablest human figure I have anywhere seen in these parts. She was paring potatoes when we drew up: oh her surprise, and joy shining thro&#x2019; her old pale face; how she at once shoved the potatoes aside, flung on an old black shawl, &#x26; had the little kitchen made into a drawing-room, and talked more interesting things all the time we staid. Husband and some Guest they had were out; Betty is a little, little <pb id="pg-42-189" n="42:189"/>not much, dull of hearing; very old sad and pale, but with all the old keenness of eye &#x26; geniality of tone; a peasant heroine whom I know not the match of at present. What she said of y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Father, of y<hi rend="italic">r</hi>self, &#x26;c I shall never forget, I think.&#x2014; But space is done here, and so is time.

<salute>Here I am Dear! Safe and Slept!</salute>
<p>I arrived last evening about seven. Miss Bromley had gone for a walk with the girl staying with her
<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified further.</note>
 and they had <hi rend="italic">lost their way</hi>! So I had ample time to unpack all the things into my drawers, before I was called upon to dress for dinner.</p>
<p>It is a nice House&#x2014;for Sea-Lodging&#x2014;but I am afraid <hi rend="italic">you</hi> would find the same fault to it as to the West Cliff Hotel

 be found!</p>
<p>But the &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Flight of Skylarks</hi>&#x201D; is always charming to live beside! and the air of the West Cliff is understood to be all one could wish! And &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Change</hi> (D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Blakiston wrote to me the other day) is for illness like mine the one available Medecine&#x201D;! So, I suppose it is all right!&#x2014; Certainly my sleeping facilities were nothing like so great here last night, as they were at home; nevertheless, in spite of &#x201C;ripple-tippling,&#x201D; and too much light, and the sense of novelty, I patched together Sleep enough to be called a goodish night.</p>
<p>It is blowing hard today with a dull grey sky, and skiffs of rain; so I see no prospect of &#x201C;V<hi rend="italic">a</hi>rrying the <hi rend="italic">Schene</hi>&#x201D;!

I was very much startled by hearing it was that Mr. Grote had conceived a passion for a woman and had made an old fool of himself, and then that she had remonstrated, his reputation being dearer to her than anything else, and then an estrangement and coldness had grown between them, which had made her miserable. This was in the winter of <date when="1864-00-00">1864</date>&#x2014; to <date when="1865-00-00">65</date>. &#x2026; [T]his summer of <date when="1865-00-00">1865</date> [her health] gave way and she was very ill and has not recovered yet. &#x2026; I felt very unhappy for her and much shocked. She was so tender on the old Grote and said it was common for old men to have deep passions late in life, she had known several cases of it. &#x2026; She also said it only belonged to the highest and most refined nature to love at that age, and not to coarse and sensual ones. She was a curious mixture of admiration for his refined nature and vexation at the trial it had been for her. I cd. not understand talking of it so dispassionately at all. &#x2026; Strange bad complicated world it is&#x201D; (Bertrand and Patricia Russell, eds., <hi rend="italic">The Amberley Papers</hi> [<date when="1937-00-00">1937</date>] 1:477&#x2013;78).</note>

<p>I got here safe at a quarter before seven, after a pleasant journey; for nobody was in the carriage but myself, and the country was looking beautiful with its wheat sheafs and hop-fields, and the way was not too long.</p>
<p>Miss Bromley having gone for a long walk and <hi rend="italic">lost her way</hi>; I had leisure to put my things all in the drawers before having to dress for dinner at eight o&#x2019;clock. If I <hi rend="italic">could</hi> have taken Jessy out of my black leather bag to help me in dressing, and put her back again when no longer needed I should have been thankful! for I grew so nervous at the notion of never getting down in time, that I could hardly tie a string or put in a pin! But on the whole it was best that I left her behind, to do her own work. These sea-bathing quarters are too limited for extra maids; especially as Miss Bromley&#x2019;s own Ladys maid is a very large and very mighty Woman
<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly Minna M&#xfc;ller, b. ca. <date when="1837-00-00">1837</date> in Germany, listed as Miss Bromley&#x2019;s lady&#x2019;s maid in the <date when="1871-00-00">1871</date> census; otherwise unidentified.</note>
 who would have found Jessie too nice, and pretty; and shown her no kindness.</p>
<p>I forgot nothing of moment, I think, except to leave my address for you and the Postman. Catch M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Bulock as soon as possible, and tell him to forward any letters for me to the address at the head of this note. And any (not circulars) that arrive for M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle let him forward to</p>
<p>Thomas Erskine Esq</p>
<p>Linlathan</p>
<p>near Dundee</p>
<p>Scotland</p>
<p>till further orders&#x2014;</p>
<p>I slept pretty well, considering it was my first night, and that I am given to lying awake in new situations.</p>
<p>I forgot tospeak about the curtains, and get the binding for them. You will <pb id="pg-42-192" n="42:192"/>have abundance of time to do them while I am here. So just look how the Drawingroom ones are finished at the top; and do the Diningroom ones the same; only making the <hi rend="italic">four</hi> curtains into <hi rend="italic">two</hi>. The binding I think is a penny a yard and sold in pieces of twelve yards, or by the yard. You can get it at Roope&#x2019;s in Sloan street I dare say or at all events at Herveys in Knightsbridge.
<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charles Roope &#x26; Son, linen drapers, 144 Sloane St.; Harvey Nichols &#x26; Co., linen drapers, 8&#x2013;16 Lowndes Terr., Knightsbridge.</note>
 take one of the the small pieces to match the colour with. Tell Jessey to write me a little letter. Wishing you both well</p>

 it seems, &#x201C;at 2.46 p.m.&#x201D;;&#x2014;and shall hope soon after to drop anchor under cheerful omens.</p>

A little interval of absolute silence and solitary contemplat<hi rend="italic">n</hi> seems to me most salutary for all mortals (tho&#x2019; so few of mortals now ever have it); the jumble to one&#x2019;s poor mind ceases; mud becomes <hi rend="italic">sediment</hi>, &#x26; lies safe at the bottom; the element, we are rejoiced to find, is ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi> become <hi rend="italic">transparent</hi>, clear as water from the spring!

<p>My own days, since you heard from me &#x26; till ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> 2 weeks ago when I came to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> with my Brother, were among the most silent I ever lived; idle totally, and given up to silent musings &#x26; saunterings; sombre, stagnant, not to say torpid;&#x2014;useful, I do believe, tho&#x2019; as sorrowful as need be, for most part. My chief &#x201C;company&#x201D; was old <hi rend="italic">Localities</hi> and their memories: <hi rend="italic">they</hi> still there under the eternal skies; all else that was once in them for me gone its ways,&#x2014;fled from me forever. God still has it: that I do know! In Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> it is much the same; much of <hi rend="italic">elegiacally</hi> beautiful, but elegiacally alone. I will say no more of all that. I am for Chelsea ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi> in a few days; not to wander farther, I think, this year.</p>
<p>My Wife is gone toFolkestone to Miss Bromley, the other day; she <hi rend="italic">greatly improved</hi> from the time you saw her; and still reports a degree of <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi> &#x26;c from Folk<hi rend="italic">ne</hi>,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; indeed her Letter reaches only to the <hi rend="italic">second day</hi> there. <pb id="pg-42-197" n="42:197"/><hi rend="italic">Here</hi> everything is well; Erskine 5 years younger (really looks so) since I saw him last; Mrs Stirling still the the

<p><salute>Thanks, dear Jessie,</salute> for your note, which might have been <hi rend="italic">longer</hi> without fatiguing my attention! And without exhausting your news I should say!</p>
<p><pb id="pg-42-198" n="42:198"/>I continue to like my present quarters; and no wonder; for I have <hi rend="italic">slept</hi> more since I came here, than I have done in any given week thro&#x2019;out the last three years!&#x2014;have slept actually like a human-Being; without needing to have recourse to <hi rend="italic">Lucifers</hi>,
<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Matches, for lighting a candle, and a kind of jelly made from beer.</note>
 or <hi rend="italic">essence</hi> of <hi rend="italic">beef</hi>, or any other of those melancholy inventions of Sleeplessness! It is rather mortifying, however, that sleeping so well, I don&#x2019;t feel the least bit <hi rend="italic">stronger</hi> for it! Twice that I have tried walking, about as far as twice the length of Cheyne Walk, I have had to get myself brought home ignominiously in a Donkey-Cart! And though I dine <hi rend="italic">twice</hi> every day,&#x2014;once at two oclock, under the name of <hi rend="italic">Luncheon</hi>, and again at half after eight under the name of <hi rend="italic">Dinner</hi>; I don&#x2019;t think I eat, putting it altogether as much as would keep a couple of rabbits nay&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">one</hi> rabbit, plump and sleek! I miss the oat-cakes; and I miss M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Warren&#x2019;s coffee, oh most dreadfully! And I need excessively to have my hair combed!&#x2014; Tho&#x2019; the <hi rend="italic">pain</hi> is quite gone out of my arm, it is stiffer, I think, than ever! And then the Housemaid
<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly Miss Bromley&#x2019;s lady&#x2019;s maid; see <ref target="volume-42/lt-18650816-JWC-EW-01">JWC to EW, <date when="1865-08-16">16 Aug.</date></ref></note>
 is so ugly!&#x2014;I cant bear her to come within a yard of me! so I take an hour to dress <hi rend="italic">myself</hi> every time, and look untidy after all.</p>
<p>Well, one of the twoweeks I gave myself is past, and the other will soon be over too; and Heaven grant M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle mayn&#x2019;t plump down on you in the meanwhile! He was to be back from his visits, on the other side of the Forth, next Tuesday I mean&#x2014;back to his Brother&#x2019;s in Annandale&#x2014;whence he would &#x201C;start homewards, he said in <hi rend="italic">one</hi> day or <hi rend="italic">two</hi>.&#x201D; That sounds as if he might arrive at Cheyne Row about Thursday or Friday. I have written to beg him not to be in such desperate haste, exactly at the wrong moment! but to at least stop a day or two at Alderley Park (where
<hi rend="small-caps">we</hi>
 should have stopt but for <hi rend="italic">the Baby</hi>!) and so reach home in a calm state of mind, instead of driven distracted by the long journey all at one rush.</p>
<p>And then I held out the inducement that <hi rend="italic">I</hi> should be there after Monday 28<hi rend="italic">th</hi> to welcome him. But&#x2014;I don&#x2019;t know&#x2014;man is born to <hi rend="italic">contradiction</hi>&#x2014;as the sparks fly upwards!
<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Job 5:7.</note>
 The very persuasion that he should absent himself a few more days may give him an unconscious but irresistible impulse towards home!&#x2014; Any how M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Warren and you will not be found like the foolish Virgins, with lamps without oil!
<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Matt. 25:3.</note>
 And besides, you may be sure of his giving you due warning. Have his bedroom all right&#x2014;and the upstairs room <hi rend="italic">fit to be seen</hi>, and no other preparations need be made till the hour and day of his coming has been announced to you by himself. I still <hi rend="italic">hope</hi> he may not come till I myself am home first! but&#x2014;if he should,&#x2014;there is one thing that you must attend to, and which you would not think of without being told! <hi rend="italic">that cat</hi>!!&#x2014;I wish she <pb id="pg-42-199" n="42:199"/>were dead. but <hi rend="italic">I</hi> cant shorten her days! because&#x2014;you see&#x2014;my poor dear wee dog liked her!

 Well! there she is! and as long as she attends M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C at his meals (she doesn&#x2019;t care a snuff of tobacco for him at any other times!) so long will M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C continue to give her bits of meat, and driblets of milk, to the ruination of the carpets and hearthrugs! I have over and again pointed out to him the stains she has made&#x2014;but he won&#x2019;t believe them <hi rend="italic">her</hi> doing!&#x2014;and the Diningroom carpet was so old and ugly, that it wasn&#x2019;t worth rows with one&#x2019;s Husband about! Now however that nice new cloth must be protected against the cat-abuse. So what I wish is; that you would shut up the creature when M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C has breakfast, or dinner, or tea. And if he remarks on her absence, say it was <hi rend="italic">my</hi> express desire. He has no idea what a selfish, immoral, improper beast she is! nor what mischief she does to the carpets!</p>
<p>My bed had better be slept in occasionally.</p>
<p>Kind regards to M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Warren</p>

<p><salute>Dearest</salute> It will be surest to direct to Scotsbrig. one might easily fail of hitting you on the wing at Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>! But I wish you could have brought yourself to go for a few days to the Lothians
<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;To Newbattle, where I spent a day&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note in Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi> 3:283).</note>
 their patience and perseverance in asking you deserved a visit! And it is rather perverse this sudden haste to get home while <hi rend="italic">I</hi> am not there to receive you! Don&#x2019;t you think it is?&#x2014; For your own sake however I do entreat you to break the long journey by either stopping at Alderley or making out that visit to Foxton.
<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Frederic, my old German fellow-tourist: his cottage &#x2018;near Rhayader&#x2019; was of route too intricate for me&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note in Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi> 3:283).</note>
 Alderley which you <hi rend="italic">know</hi>, and are sure of a fine quiet bedroom at, would be best. It is such a pity to arrive at home, entirely fevered and knocked up with that journey, as always happens, and then you take it to be &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">London</hi>&#x201D; that is makingyou ill!</p>
<p>Then, if you staid a few days at Alderley; I could stay out the fortnight I undertook for here, and be home in time to give you welcome. I should go home on Monday week (Monday the 28<hi rend="italic">th</hi>) in the course of nature&#x2014; I suppose <pb id="pg-42-200" n="42:200"/>this place is good for me; I have slept so much!&#x2014;more than in any other week for the last three years! But I dont feel <hi rend="italic">stronger</hi> for all this sleep&#x2014;nor more able to eat, or to walk! One day that I tried walking about as far as from Cheyne row to the Hospital,
<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Royal Chelsea Hospital, home for old and disabled soldiers; see <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340617-TC-JAC-01"><sic>7:215</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1834-06-17">17 June 1834</date></corr></ref>; about 900 yds. (1 km.) E of Cheyne Row.</note>
 I had to come home ignominiously in a donkey cart! But the <hi rend="italic">Drives</hi> don&#x2019;t tire me; especially since Miss Bromley had her own carriage and horses sent down. Nor need there be any reflections for want of &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">simmering stagnation</hi>&#x201D;! There is not a human creature to speak to! out of our own house. and in it, the Pugs have the greatest share of the conversation to themselves!</p>
<p>I cannot forgive Thomas Erskine for taking up and keeping up with such a beast of a woman as M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Schwabe! letting <hi rend="italic">you</hi> be driven out by M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Schwabe!</p>
<p>I am so glad you went to see dear Betty, it will be something good for her to think of for a year to come!</p>
<p>Do writedistinctly the when and the how of your homecoming What do you think? I have exactly <hi rend="italic">two sovereigns</hi> in the world!&#x2014;enough to pay the servants here and my railway fare, home!! And <hi rend="italic">no more</hi>!! Yet I have not been extravagant that I am aware of!</p>
<p>I had to pay Silvester before I went to Scotland 16 pounds eleven and fourpence&#x2014;and to ditto after my return five pounds . . seventeen shillings. And Freure
<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;The Chelsea carpenter&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note in Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi> 3:284).</note>

<p>making up in all <hi rend="italic">one half</hi> of my house-money&#x2014; Then, <hi rend="italic">Your</hi> being away makes no difference on the Rent taxes, servants wages and keep, &#x26;c&#x2014; And for <hi rend="italic">my</hi> being away myself, I certainly have to pay to other peoples servants <hi rend="italic">more</hi> than it would cost me for individual &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">living&#x2019;s cares</hi>&#x201D;!</p>
<p>I had indeed, besides the House money, my own fifteen pounds&#x2014;of which the two sovereigns above mentioned are the sad remains!&#x2014; But when these pounds came to hand I <hi rend="italic">owed</hi> for my summer bonnet and cloak. and I had some little presents to buy, to take with me to Scotland, besides a gown for myself. The only part of my own money I can be said to have spent needlessly was a guinea and a half for&#x2014;&#x2014;you would never guess what!&#x2014;for a <hi rend="italic">miniature</hi> <pb id="pg-42-201" n="42:201"/>of&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">You</hi>!! Such a Beauty! Every one who sees it screams with rapture over it!&#x2014;even Ruskin!</p>
<p>But my <hi rend="italic">hand</hi> can do no more&#x2014;</p>
<p>Miss Bromley bids me say &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">that</hi> four footed animal&#x201D;

<p><salute>Dearest</salute>&#x2014;All the letters I have had from you here have arrived shortly before eight&#x2014;the dinner hour&#x2014;so there has never been time for answering by return of post. Today the dear little letter was lying for me, when we returned from our drive at six! So I address a few lines to Scotsbrig, where a longish letter is waiting for you already, hoping they may not be too late.</p>
<p>I am vexed at the notion of your being home before me. But unless you take my advice and stay a night or two at Alderley, I dont see how, in your present impatient mood, you are to be <hi rend="italic">held in</hi>, till after Monday! And it would be uncivil to the SkyLarks

<p>For the rest; I think the most good to be got of my sea change has been <pb id="pg-42-205" n="42:205"/>got and over with it! Tho&#x2019; I continue to sleep in the most unprece<hi rend="italic">dented</hi> manner&#x2014;this affluence of sleep does me no good seemingly.

 And yesterday a very short walk taken at Dover brought on a headach and sickness like what I had the day I should have gone to you at the Gill.

 Such a Mother! And such a Father! Pray give it a kiss for me, a whole shower of kisses. I hope to see it with my bodily eyes before long. I return to Chelsea on Monday next till then I am here with Miss Bromley and the Pugs.</p>
<p>Mr. Carlyle too is longing for home. Can know no rest till he gets there! Poor despised Chelsea has risen in value of late I should not wonder, so great is his impatience to get back to London (!!!) that he will start off without awaiting my return, and plump down on those terrified servants all by himself! <pb id="pg-42-206" n="42:206"/>this week! My arm continues free of pain, and I can use my hand to a certain small extent, for example I write this note with the lame hand! and since I have been here I have knitted a pair of what shall I say? Garters! Upon my honour.</p>

<p>I am again going to make an attempt, at putting on paper the letter that has been in my head for you, Dear, ever since I came to this Place. I had even begun to <hi rend="italic">write</hi> it two or three days ago, when at the first words my conscience gave me a smart box on the ear, reminding me that I hadnt written one word to M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Ewart since I left her&#x2014;after all her kindness to me! whereas to you I had written once and again&#x2014; So my pen formed, quite unexpectedly for <hi rend="italic">myself</hi>, the words &#x201C;dear M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Ewart,&#x201D; instead of &#x201C;dearest Mary.&#x201D; To be sure there have been leisure hours enough since! Life here is made up of &#x201C;leisure hours&#x201D;; But just the less one does, I long ago observed, the less one can find time to do! I get up at nine, and it takes me a whole mortal hour to dress:&#x2014;without assistance. At ten we sit down to breakfast, and talk over it till about eleven. Then I have to write my letter to M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle. Then I make a feeble attempt at <hi rend="italic">walking</hi>, on the cliff by the shore. which never fails to weary me dreadfully; so that I can do nothing after, till the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> dinner (called Luncheon) which comes off at 2 o&#x2019;clock. then, between three and four, we go out for a drive, in an open barouche, with a pair of swift horses and explore the country for three or four hours. on coming home we have a cup of tea, then rest, and dress for the <hi rend="italic">second</hi> dinner at eight (nominally, but in reality half past eight!) At eleven we <hi rend="italic">go</hi> to bed. Very sleepy generally with so much open air! There is not a soul to speak to from without! But Miss Bromley and I never bore one another&#x2014;when we find nothing of mutual interest to talk about, we have the gift, both of us, of being able to sit silent together without the least embarrassment! She is adorably kind to me, that &#x201C;fine Lady&#x201D;! and in such an unconscious way! always looking and talking, as if it were <hi rend="italic">me</hi> that was kind to <hi rend="italic">her</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">she</hi> the <pb id="pg-42-207" n="42:207"/>one benefitted by our intimacy! And then she has something in her face, and movements, and ways that always reminds me of my Mother&#x2014;at <hi rend="italic">her</hi> age!</p>
<p>I am sorry that M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle after all his objections to <hi rend="italic">my</hi> returning to London in <date when="1865-08-00">August</date> should have taken it in his head to return to London in <date when="1865-08-00">August</date> himself! I find it so pleasant here, and am sleeping so wonderfully, that I feel no disposition to go back to Chelsea already; Miss Bromley having taken her house for five weeks, and being heartily desirous I should stay and keep her company. But a demon of impatience seems to have taken possession of M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C. and he has been rushing thro&#x2019; his promised visits as if the Furies were chasing him! Every thing right seemingly wherever he went! The people all kindness for him, the bedrooms quiet and airy! Horses and carriages at his command; and behold! it was impossible to persuade him to stay longer than <hi rend="italic">three days</hi> with M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Erskine of Linlathen!&#x2014;ditto with Sterling of Keir! and just three hours (<hi rend="italic">for Luncheon</hi>) at NewBattle with the Lothians. And by this time he is back at Scotsbrig (if all have gone right) to stay &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">one</hi> day or at mosttwo&#x201D; preparatory for starting for Chelsea!</p>
<p>It is really so unreasonable this sudden haste, after so many months of dawdling that I do <hi rend="italic">not</hi> feel it my duty to rush home &#x201C;promiscuously&#x201D; to receive him&#x2014; I promised to stay here &#x201C;a fortnight <hi rend="italic">at</hi> the least,&#x201D; and the fortnight does not complete itself till Monday next&#x2014; So I have written to him that I will be home on Monday&#x2014;not sooner&#x2014;and begging him to break the journey, and amuse himself for a couple of days at Alderley Park
<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-42/lt-18650822-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1865-08-22">22 Aug.</date>].</ref></note>
 &#x2014;and then he would find me at home to receive him, since he won&#x2019;t do as Miss Bromley and I wish, and come here&#x2014;for a little sea-bathing to finish off with!</p>
<p>It really <hi rend="italic">is</hi> miraculous how soundly I have slept here! tho&#x2019; I take two glasses of champagne&#x2014;besides Mansinilla
<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Manzanilla, a pale dry sherry from Andalusia, S Spain.</note>
 every day at the late dinner! It couldn&#x2019;t have been sound that champagne of poor kind M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Ewarts or it wouldn&#x2019;t have so disagreed with me&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">here</hi> it always does me good! And the pain is entirely gone out of my arm! I cant <hi rend="italic">move</hi> it any better yet&#x2014;but <hi rend="italic">that</hi> is small matter in comparison! I can do many things with my hand&#x2014;write (as you see) knit, I have knitted myself a pair of garters I can play on the piano a little and do a few stiches with a <hi rend="italic">very coarse</hi> needle&#x2014;</p>
<p>Kindest love to the D<hi rend="italic">r</hi></p>

<salute>Dear Jean,</salute>
<p>I am very quiet here, this blessed bright day; have good news from Jane; and intend to be off on Monday straight home. Annan w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> do for my train and me: but how can I think of leaving with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> a sight of you and the Hill Household ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi>? I am considerably at a loss; but feel as if there w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be no method, except to pack finally up tomorrow afternoon; get over to The Gill with Mary and all my goods in the Evening, and embark for you by the 10&#xBD; p.m. train,&#x2014;stay till monday morn<hi rend="italic">g</hi>, &#x26; <hi rend="italic">there</hi> embark. If you hear or see nothing more, consider this to be the course of things,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; alas, I am <hi rend="italic">sweer</hi> to quit the silent sunshine here, and try foreign beds ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, even <hi rend="italic">with</hi>t the whistles while I stay.</p>
<p>You will see the Dr

<p><salute>Thanks, Dearest!</salute> At the Ecclef<hi rend="italic">n</hi> Station yesterday afternoon, James <hi rend="italic">jun</hi>r handed me y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> two bonnie little Notes, jud[g]ing

 that they, beyond all others, w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be welcome to me, &#x26; were worth carry in his pocket: he had even taken the precaution to mark wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> was <hi rend="italic">foremost</hi> of the two; and I as was natural, read the latest first. What a relief, to be assured that you were <hi rend="italic">sleeping</hi> &#x26;c! Never mind that weariness, that languor, inability to walk, and the rest of it: all that is the natural <hi rend="italic">consequence</hi> of recovering sleep; &#x26; is like wealth steadily coming in, true tho&#x2019; as yet not in the money shape, and going into one&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">barns</hi>, not into one&#x2019;s pocket. Neither shall you bother y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> poor little heart ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> quitting Folkestone to receive me: &#x201C;Monday 28<hi rend="italic">th</hi>,&#x201D; as happens, is the very day I had set for rushing home at a stretch: if you are doing, or are like to do, any good <pb id="pg-42-209" n="42:209"/>at Folk<hi rend="italic">ne</hi>, <hi rend="italic">don&#x2019;t</hi> come on Monday, nor till you yourself <hi rend="italic">like</hi>; nay if this weather continue, and you can pronounce that my chance of sleep is really fair, I feel as if I shouldn&#x2019;t mind coming down myself for a few days, to have a little farther swashing in the sea (with touches of Lark

<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Foxton wrote, <date when="1865-08-29">29 Aug.</date>: &#x201C;I cannot tell you how much I am disappointed at not having you here after so much long-deferred hope. Shall I ever see you now? What &#x2018;better time&#x2019; is ever likely to come? For myself, every succeeding year brings with it a heavier burden of infirmities. &#x2026; Let me still hope that, after a few weeks rest in your honest &#x2018;fourposter&#x2019; at home, you may be tempted to encounter the shorter railway trip from London to this place. &#x2026; Will it be dishonouring to you to suggest a creature comfort as an inducement to you to come to me? I have got, under my windows, fetlock-deep in grass, the prettiest Ayrshire cow (distinct from an Ayrshire cattle show) now to be found in the principality. As your milk appears to be all being poisoned in London by the cattle-plague, &#x26; as this and to be an important article in your diet, I throw in this fact as a make weight to add to the sum of my inducements.&#x201D;</note>
 (an intolerable ride for length and complicacy, a night of attempt at sleeping on the road; and at the <hi rend="italic">end</hi> of all nearly as far from London as if I were <hi rend="italic">here</hi>!)&#x2014;no Foxton; no Alderley (a haggle and an uncert<hi rend="italic">y</hi> of hitting trains thro&#x2019; Manchester; and then the <hi rend="italic">two</hi> &#x201C;children of glory,&#x201D;

<p>My Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>&#x2014;Keir &#x26;c fortnight was not with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> profit perhaps; tho&#x2019; the <hi rend="italic">interest</hi> it c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have to me was only small. Not a single loved face there,&#x2014;ah me, so few anywhere at this date!

 this Earth holds. Erskine&#x2019;s tolerance of that unlovely Schwabe is not to be praised of him; indeed the good old <hi rend="italic">Saint</hi> Thomas seemed to me sometimes to have grown more <hi rend="italic">secular</hi> in these his last years; eats better, drinks d<hi rend="italic">o</hi>, and is more at ease in the world,&#x2014;very wearisome, and inclined to feel distressed &#x26; be disputatious on his new theories ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> &#x201C;God,&#x201D; when <hi rend="italic">Sinner</hi> Thomas

 will have nothing to do with them. We met on our walks one day, a big reddish-coloured phenom<hi rend="italic">n</hi> who seemed to start as he passed, tho&#x2019; I did not the least mind him: Erskine whispered &#x201C;Do you know who that was?&#x201D; Not the least. &#x201C;That is Gilfillan the great!&#x201D;

 Very good: needed to be &#x201C;cut <hi rend="italic">tact</hi>&#x201D;; and it c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not have been better done.&#x2014; I know not whether you will take to &#x201C;Lady Anna Stirling,&#x201D; if she sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> to you: she is modest, good, a gentlewoman; and I think will have more <hi rend="italic">gump</hi>tion than perhaps she shows at once.

<p>The visit of day before yesterday to Newbattle was perfectly successful, one may say, tho&#x2019; as sad as c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> well be for such a thing.

 I had better have walked,&#x2014;station being close on the Marquis&#x2019;s Park, and the paths and woods there altogether eligible. The House is fine of its kind, and finely Scotch; nobody there but the two poor inmates, and an idle-looking goodhumoured Painter doing a Portrait of the Lady.

<salute>Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Here I am; safe out of the enormous jingling whirlwind; arrived (40 min. too late) ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> 11 p.m.; found Jane to have <hi rend="italic">come</hi> in the afternoon; considerably improved since I last saw her, and with a House all shining in apple-pie order round her. I have got some sleep (not quite enough), and feel up to the work of at least unpacking, and <hi rend="italic">beginning</hi> the work of order.
<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John A. Carlyle wrote to their brother Alexander in Canada, <date when="1865-08-31">31 Aug.</date>, enclosing TC&#x2019;s letter: &#x201C;Our brother Tom left us on Monday (<date when="1865-05-08">28th</date>) &#x26; got safely home the same day. &#x2026; He staid in Scotland a little more than three months. &#x2026; He looked much better &#x2026; than when he arrived here in May, has no disease upon him except age; and it seems to me wonderful that he got through his twelve years of hard unremitting labour without any other injury than immense fatigue, in itself dangerous when carried to such extent. He has done no work since his task ended in February. &#x2026; [JWC] has had no return of her disease of last year, but an attack [of] rheumatic gout in the right arm which seems to be now well nigh gone too&#x201D; (Marrs 746). Woolner commented on both Carlyles to Lady Ashburton, <date when="1865-09-04">4 Sept.</date>: &#x201C;I saw the Carlyles on Thursday evening [<date when="1865-08-31">31 Aug.</date>]; she looks despite her hand better than I had seen her ever since her illness a year and &#xBE; ago; he did not seem to me in the great Niagarian flow of spirits as he is wont, but he looks well physically; the ruddy bronze of a summer sun brightens his face and his step is more elastic and firm than I have seen it for years past. I think the almost entire want of intelligent notice of his great work now completed must make him feel depressed. When a man has brought the full force of a colossal spirit to bear on one subject, and overcoming incredible difficulties, at last without a word of encouragement brings his labours to a conclusion, he wants something besides the consciousness of having done his duty; a few words to show that his toilsome struggle has at least been recognised would surely be not too much to expect&#x201D; (MS: NLS Acc. 11388).</note>
 I am on the ground floor, as perhaps you know, Books &#x26;c all ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> me, &#x26; a room, or 3 rooms, so smart &#x26; lively you w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not knowthem ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi>.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-42-214" n="42:214"/>Till Carlisle I rode quite alone with the fresh Winds: we staid &#xBD; an hour in that City; and then in spite of my precautions my compart<hi rend="italic">t</hi> was invaded,&#x2014;two Glasgow bodies, an Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> d<hi rend="italic">o</hi>; harmless touring people with &#x201C;return tickets,&#x201D; for some time there was a lank sleepy-looking cockney youth of the same trade: but all were harmless, good-natured; I persuaded them to let down a bit of their window by &#x26; by, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> they loyally kept so; &#x26; we had smoking ad libitum, &#x26; <hi rend="italic">peace</hi> in our borders, amid the outside noises. But it was a big train; crowded, &#x26; had the usual accompan<hi rend="italic">t</hi> of Chaos animate &#x26; inanimate. I drank by degrees every drop of the brandied water; but, dining well at Preston,
<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Preston, Lancashire, railway junction about 89 mi. (143 km.) from Carlisle.</note>
 had no need (or none till this morn<hi rend="italic">g</hi>) of Jean&#x2019;s fine chicken sandw<hi rend="italic">h</hi>. At Carlisle the guard <hi rend="italic">asked</hi> us all, &#x201C;Dine at Preston?&#x201D; but kept his <hi rend="italic">telegraphing</hi> strictly to himself. Enough!&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Nobody&#x201D; is here, I suppose; my own head (&#x26; heart) is still sounding with the sad and kind tho<hi rend="italic">ts</hi> natural to the hour of Parting. God bless you all, you ever kind &#x26; dear souls whom I so grieved to quit.

Since the previous statement the exchange has declined very much, and I think we may count on its continuing to do so. &#x2F; I concluded to invest the balance in hand by the purchase of two bonds of $1,000 each at 8% which I regard as very favorable. The interest of these two will be now added to the account. Their purchase required a small advance over the amount standing to the credit of the account, which will be reimbursed to me out of the accruing interest in Feby next. I shall write your brother shortly not only on the termination of the war here in this country, whereby commercial relations are left to return to their usual &#x26; natural condition, but also on the termination of his great work, the History of Frederick, whereby his peace of mind must be restored &#x26; himself freed from a great burden&#x201D; (LeRoy Elwood Kimball, &#x201C;Thomas Carlyle and Charles Butler of Wall Street,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Essays and Studies in Honor of Carleton Brown</hi> [New York, <date when="1940-00-00">1940</date>] 293).</note>

 in, or rather <hi rend="italic">on</hi> my carriage, to the Railway Office in the Regent Circus and consigned it there with an admonition!

<p>Another thing!&#x2014; I had only 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi> (porterage) to pay for the last hamper so you must have prepaid it&#x2014;and I had made it an understood thing with Lady Ashburton that I should pay the carriage of the hampers myself.</p>

The fact, at any rate, is cert<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, I have never yet got into a secure footing in regard to <hi rend="italic">dietetics</hi>; and for one point, have hardly made a single unexceptionable <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi> since arriving here,&#x2014;you know what that means, till once it alter.

 D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Russell was giving me certain medical directions, and said, without any question on my part. &#x201C;The pain in your arm, being <hi rend="italic">pure neuralgia</hi>, will, I hope, wear itself out&#x2014;as you get stronger (how <hi rend="italic">was</hi> I to get &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">stronger</hi>&#x201D; I should like to know, with a pain that left me no rest by day nor sleep by night?) It may be a long time first, but I think it <hi rend="italic">will</hi> wear itself out ultimately; but as to the stiffness and pain in the hand, <hi rend="italic">that</hi> being complicated with <hi rend="italic">Gout</hi>, I think you must lay your account with its continuing&#x201D;! &#x201C;Do you mean to tell me I asked that I shall <hi rend="italic">never</hi> have the use of my right hand again in my Life?&#x201D;&#x2014; &#x201C;Well! I think, said he, you would do well to calculate on <hi rend="italic">that</hi>, and on having pain in it always&#x2014;more or less!&#x201D;&#x2014; I made him no answer aloud, but I said inwardly; &#x201C;Well then I <hi rend="italic">wont</hi>!

 get back the use of my hand please god&#x2014;and you shall see!&#x201D;</p>
<p>Next day I returned to Chelsea, at one stretch, and arrived about eleven at night. I knew that fevered as I was with the fatigue I should not be able to sleep a wink; so I sat up reading till three of the morning then I ached so all over that I thought it better to take my clothes off and

 at least on my bed. But I <hi rend="italic">couldn&#x2019;t lie</hi>; I was in such a state of nervous restlessness! So I bethought me to take a doze of morphia, which long ago, before my terrible illness, used to give me rest in such emergencies. The morphia did not put me to sleep, but it quietened me; so that I lay peaceably till my Maids got up between six and seven, and made me some breakfast. I was on foot all day after, unpacking and sorting up, and out in the carriage for necessary shopping; and, strange to say, the pain in my arm did not make itself felt! I

<salute>Dear Lady Lothian</salute>
<p>It was a real gladness to me, your kind letter &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">all to myself</hi>&#x201D;! I had not seen your handwriting nor seen your face for so long! not since just before I fell ill of long, terrible illness! A year and half passed in the Valley of the Shadow of Death

 had given me a foretaste of separation from all living!&#x2014;from those <pb id="pg-42-219" n="42:219"/>near and dear, as well as from the farther off! When again I could see friends and acquaintances&#x2014;could even <hi rend="italic">enjoy the joy</hi> of seeing them; it was like beginning Life afresh, with the warm feelings of a young girl queerly mixed with the sad knowledge of Age!</p>
<p>Excuseso much of myself; but it is that you may understand something of the pleasure I felt in seeing your handwriting come back to me in the old kindness&#x2014;after all that dark time!</p>
<p>I wish you could also understand how completely my Husband has considered the &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Thanks</hi>&#x201D; were due from him to you; and not from you to him! He enjoyed that glimpse of you and Lord Lothian in your Home, more, I think, than anything that happened for him all the three months he was away. Certainly he both wrote to me about it at the time, and has spoken to me about it since his return, with a quite unusual enthusiasm! rather in the style of a <hi rend="italic">Fairy Tale</hi> or of the travels of <hi rend="italic">John Buncle</hi>

 assuring me over and over that &#x201C;the <hi rend="italic">glorious beauty</hi> of Lord Lothian&#x2019;s face was a thing one could never forget&#x201D;! and of you, he has said over and over; &#x201C;indeed my Dear that Lady seems to me a person to be admired and even <hi rend="italic">loved</hi>! really something very noble about her&#x201D;!</p>
<p>I think the next time he goes to visit you, he will be in no haste at all to run away!</p>
<p>The weather is sopreternaturally sultry here that M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C has had no chance with it to show himself better for his wanderings. We lie about on sofas: languid, stupid, sick&#x2014;physically and morally.</p>

Finding themselves without any check, the horses set off at a furious rate. In attempting to jump out, a part of the carriage caught the dress of the Countess, causing her to fall to the ground, fortunately clear of the wheels. The horses continued their career, but on approaching the castle they were observed by the medical attendant of the Earl of Strathmore &#x2026; who boldly seized them and put a stop to their career. &#x2026; We understand that the Countess, who was dragged for some distance, received such a severe shock as to render her unable to return home until the next day.&#x201D; Charlotte Lyon-Bowes (<date when="1797-00-00">1797</date>&#x2013;<date when="1881-00-00">1881</date>), Lady Glamis, widow of Thomas George Lyon-Bowes (<date when="1801-00-00">1801</date>&#x2013;<date when="1834-00-00">34</date>).

<p><pb id="pg-42-221" n="42:221"/>Poor Alick, how touching his old Physiognomy is to me here! His tenderness, the old vein of melancholy, of pathos, and affectionate sorrow, this was always a trait that I loved in him. Doubly interesting in the fiery indignations and manifold sarcastic ruggednesses of a character like him. He seems to be well enough;&#x2014;and for the rest I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not but reflect how opportune y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> &#xa3;100 will be in the kind of economic element he describes.

<salute>Dear Jean,</salute>
<p>Y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Monday-morning Note was very welcome, as they all are: and brought me kindly in mind of you all,&#x2014;all the more as they come <hi rend="italic">gratis</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">don&#x2019;t</hi> bully for an ans<hi rend="italic">r</hi> till the time serve. I did design to write some word or two on Sat<hi rend="italic">y</hi>; but looking at the clock, found it inexorably too far on, &#x26; that my afternoon&#x2019;s walk (and probably night&#x2019;s sleep) was forfeited if I did. I am totally idle,&#x2014;that is to say, do nothing except read &#x26;c &#x26;c;&#x2014;but my aversion to the pen is equal or superior to what it ever was; and indeed I shudder to write the smallest line, and never do it when I can avoid. &#x201C;Work&#x201D; is far, far from me; all my Work seems done; and generally I am well enough content it sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be so,&#x2014;in such a thrice-beggarly work<hi rend="italic">shop</hi> as this terrestrial one of ours has now grown. Full of mere railway Screameries, Penny-Newspaperings, and the voice of doleful creatures, from pole to pole. &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Dinna speak o&#x2019;t</hi>!&#x201D; as poor Byron used to say of his lame leg, in the young Aberdeen days.

<p>For the rest, we are both of us well; Jane very especially,&#x2014;if it will only last. She misses no day to drive out 3 hours; takes her meals along with me; and sleeps generally much better than has been common. The weather is still what you w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> call &#x201C;excellent&#x201D;; still in general too hot, but with occasional <pb id="pg-42-225" n="42:225"/>gusts from the N.

I care little ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> my &#x201C;reading&#x201D;; but the privilege of following my own moody contemplat<hi rend="italic">ns</hi> and being well let alone, is for the pres<hi rend="italic">t</hi> a welcome tho&#x2019; a sad one.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I designed to write to you at greater length; but, as too usual, time is wanting. <hi rend="italic">Time</hi>: and all day I have nothing earthly to do, but sit reading Books that <pb id="pg-42-226" n="42:226"/>are of neither profit nor interest to me; and to go sauntering ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi>, nearly the idlest of all men! It is very true; and more or less shameful, I fear. And, what is worst of all, there is little prospect for me of its altering for the better. I abhor all work, of the writing kind; and the truth is, I am incapable of it. That twelve years of tugging has quite finished me, I often think,&#x2014;that <hi rend="italic">and Time</hi> well might!&#x2014;and it is indisputable my health is still miserably bad; <hi rend="italic">liver</hi> totally deranged, <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi> very bad, spirits d<hi rend="italic">o</hi> &#x26;c &#x26;c: in short nothing to be tried but <hi rend="italic">lie quiet</hi>; and see whether fate does mean anything farther with [me].
<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note>
 I ought also to be <hi rend="italic">silent</hi> ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> it, you may well think;&#x2014;and that is a reason why I am so <hi rend="italic">sweer</hi> to write; that being the topic withal wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> concerns me most! Enough of it. I am not very unhappy; not <hi rend="italic">more</hi> than I used to be, surely; and if this villain of a <hi rend="italic">liver</hi> w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> behave itself a little, I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be sensibly <hi rend="italic">less</hi> so.</p>
<p>Nothing occurs here that is worth writing. The weather is cooler ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi>; the Town still empty,&#x2014;or for me as good as empty. Yesterday Neuberg drove me a long way, by Wilsden, Harrow Road &#x26;c; kind, but wearisome. Chorley I have seen twice; he has balanced my Bank-Books for me

<p>You, I am very happy to hear, are doing well at Dumfries. The street of <hi rend="italic">Brompton Place</hi> is a greatly improved place; all new <hi rend="italic">numbered</hi>; so that I cannot yet make out the old &#x201C;N<hi rend="italic">o</hi> 48,&#x201D;

 as I pass! I know not if you ever think of trying London ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi> for a variety? It is not for me, who like it so little, to invite you hither. The room <hi rend="italic">here</hi>, you know is empty, tho&#x2019; I fear it will <hi rend="italic">not</hi> be quieter than when you last occupied it.

<p>For many years it has been one of my constant regrets, that no schoolmaster of mine had a knowledge of <hi rend="italic">Natural History</hi>, so far at least as to have taught me the grasses that grow by the wayside, and the little winged and wingless neighbours that are continually meeting me, with a salutation which I cannot <hi rend="italic">answer</hi>, as things are! Why didn&#x2019;t somebody teach me the constellations, too, and make me at home in the starry heavens, which are always overhead, and which I don&#x2019;t above <hi rend="italic">half</hi> know to this day? I love to prophesy that there will come a time, when not in Edinburgh only, but in all Scottish and European towns and villages, the schoolmaster will be strictly required to possess these two capabilities (neither Greek nor Latin <hi rend="italic">more</hi> strict!), and that no ingenious little denizen of this universe be thenceforth debarred from his right of liberty in these two departments, and doomed to look on them as if across grated fences all his life! For the rest I cannot doubt but, one way or other, you will by and by make your valuable indubitable gift available in Edinburgh, either to the young or to the older, on such conditions as there are, and I much recommend a zealous and judicious <hi rend="italic">persistence</hi> till you do succeed.&#x2014;
