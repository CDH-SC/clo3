<p>To continue the record that we have had in previous volumes, this one includes 218 letters, of which Carlyle wrote 175 and Jane Carlyle wrote 43, while of the total 218, about 51 percent, or 111, have not been published before. Of the rest, 42 have appeared only in an incomplete form, many of which were in works or periodicals that are not easily accessible. We see an increasingly high proportion of unpublished writing, which shows the tendency noted (in volume 22 and at <ref target="volume-19/ed-19-introduction"><sic>19:ix</sic><corr>19:introduction</corr></ref>), from which the same conclusion can be drawn: that we have a continually improving basis for understanding the Carlyles and their times, giving a truer as well as a fuller story.</p>
<p>Yet a sharper picture is emerging in other ways, and one of the most important of these is in connection with the Carlyles&#x2019; friends William Bingham Baring, the second Lord Ashburton, and Lady Ashburton, formerly Lady Harriet. Since <date when="1839">1839</date> when Carlyle first met them (<ref target="volume-11/lt-18390308-TC-MAC-01"><sic>11:40</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1839-03-08">8 March 1839</date></corr></ref>), the question of his relation to Lady Harriet has been to some extent bypassed in explanations and comments, and this has been because it is difficult to be precise about its nature and how it developed. The reader who needs an explanation mainly has to look back over earlier notes and letters because, as suggested, Lady Harriet often seems an enigma. She sometimes baffled observers with her apparent self-sufficiency (<ref target="volume-19/ed-19-introduction"><sic>19:xiii</sic><corr>19:introduction</corr></ref>). After all, even Jane Carlyle wrote, in <date when="1846-03">March 1846</date>: &#x201C;She is &#x2018;a bit of fascination&#x2019; (as the Countryman said of &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">Tagg</hi>lioni&#x2019;) a very <hi rend="italic">large bit.</hi> I profess never to this hour to have arrived at a complete understanding of her&#x2014;but <hi rend="italic">that</hi> I fancy is just part of her fascination&#x2014;the insoluble phsycological puzzle which she is and bids fair to remain for me!&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-20/lt-18460310-JWC-JW-01"><sic>20:139</sic><corr>JWC to JW, <date when="1846-03-10">10 March 1846</date></corr></ref>).</p>
<p>Relations between the three were close and friendly until the middle of <date when="1846">1846</date>, when it is clear from letters at that time and later that Jane Carlyle believed that she had reasons for jealousy, because Carlyle had too openly shown his admiration for Lady Harriet. Jane was keenly hurt, and in the five years since then, we see this expressed, stifled, overcome, and breaking out again. This is not the moment to double back to retell the whole story. At times Carlyle tried to keep away from her. With partial success he and Lady Harriet agreed not to write to each other or to reduce their correspondence. Everything was entirely innocent, except that he could not conceal fascination for her whether in her company or writing and receiving letters, which were always an essential part of actual life for the Carlyles, and even an agreeable substitute for it.</p>
<p>The present volume has not yet reached the point when Jane Carlyle felt <pb id="pg-26-x" n="26:x"/>the full tension of the relationship, which was about <date when="1855">1855</date>, when she wrote in her Journal of Carlyle&#x2019;s attendance at that &#x201C;eternal Bath House&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">LM</hi> 2:258), and which was to end with Lady Ashburton&#x2019;s death in <date when="1857">1857</date>. Much has been said about the affair in the Carlyles&#x2019; biographies by such writers as D. A. Wilson, the Hansons, and Fred Kaplan, who all had access to the full Ashburton-Carlyle correspondence, or by previous editors of the letters. For the moment, some familiarity with this, or its possibility, has to be assumed. Yet what is needed is the realization that we can make better use of what is known and that there is more to be discovered. It is inadequate to trade in stray scraps of information, and not enough to use Froude&#x2019;s metaphors from myth and Greek tragedy any more than what he calls Carlyle&#x2019;s &#x201C;fanciful flatteries.&#x201C; We need both a sharper and a broader interpretation. We should begin to question, for example, what the Ashburtons were like, and we could try to answer by looking at them through the eyes of less biased observers than the Carlyles.</p>
<p>The recent acquisition of the surviving Ashburton papers by the National Library of Scotland gives some hope of adding to our knowledge if not our understanding, and a brief chance has been given us to look at them before most are temporarily lost to sight for twelve months while changes happen at the library. Yet, though it is too soon to attempt a review and reassessment, we can glance at a few examples of what these papers now show, particularly about <date when="1851">1851</date>, the year of the present volume. Two figures are selected as representative: W. M. Thackeray, who was close to Lady Harriet; and J. A. Froude, who wrote two or three letters of special interest to Lord Ashburton&#x2019;s second wife, Louisa. Thackeray, especially, was an outstanding figure in the group of distinguished men who met at the Grange and Bath House. Froude, who was Louisa, Lady Ashburton&#x2019;s friend well before he began writing about the Carlyles, is of interest because of what he says about the problems of Carlyle&#x2019;s biography. Still in the shadows are the Carlyles&#x2019; past and future companions such as John Stuart Mill, Macaulay, Tennyson, Thiers, Edward Ellice, Charles Buller, relatives of the Ashburtons, and many more who, to use Froude&#x2019;s expression, were &#x201C;satellites&#x201C; in Lady Harriet&#x2019;s &#x201C;planetary system&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">LM</hi> 2:255). It is a remark that may betray too impersonal a way of seeing them, which can now be changed. As Thackeray&#x2019;s and Froude&#x2019;s letters to the Ashburtons are elucidated, they will tell us more about the Ashburtons and their circle. Certainly, the letters of this first representative pair could hardly be more expressive.</p>
<p>Thackeray was a dominant figure within Lady Harriet&#x2019;s set, willing to be seen as an admirer, to play his part in her court, and to perform when called on. Soon after being introduced by Charles Buller, he had begun by resenting what he thought was her disdainful attitude to some of her guests; but, after expressing an open dislike for her, he was won back, returning one of the <pb id="pg-26-xi" n="26:xi"/>Ashburtons&#x2019; invitation cards to dinner (says Lord Houghton) with a sketch of himself at her feet, his head being heaped with glowing coals of fire. Their pact of friendship was complete when she asked him to write to her after Charles Buller&#x2019;s death, and he did so with direct and sympathetic tenderness.</p>
<p>This reminds us of how closely Thackeray belonged to an even more compact inner circle of Lady Harriet&#x2019;s intimates, which included Carlyle, who had tutored the Buller sons, and, who was also a close friend of their parents and who had looked after Mrs. Buller when she was dying. They were all dear to each other, and we miss much that is important about Carlyle if we concentrate only on his contentious side. We should probably play down the differences between Thackeray and Carlyle on such matters as &#x201C;heroes,&#x201C; or the incident of the novelist&#x2019;s upset about what Carlyle said when he accepted a free return passage from the P. &#x26; O. Steamship Company when gathering experience for his <hi rend="italic">From Cornhill to Cairo</hi> <date when="1846">(1846)</date>, that he was like the &#x201C;old fiddler going to and fro on a penny ferry-boat in Scotland and playing tunes to the passengers for half-pence&#x201C; (Duffy 76&#x2013;77).</p>
<p>In the present volume we find the Carlyles loyally attending Thackeray&#x2019;s public lectures, an affectionate interchange with them about his difference with John Forster, their joint presence with his children at the family party left over after Christmas at the Grange, and their obvious pride at Thackeray&#x2019;s calling on them one evening, even if only on his way to a grander affair. A little earlier there had been an affectionate sense of fun in one of Thackeray&#x2019;s letters to Lady Ashburton at the end of <date when="1849">1849</date>, when he told her of Carlyle&#x2019;s outburst against Henry Reeve (journalist and secretary of the Privy Council) at a dinner at the Procters&#x2019; (see <ref target="volume-25/lt-18500118-TC-LA-01"><sic>25:3&#x2013;4</sic><corr>TC to LA, <date when="1850-01-18">18 Jan. 1850</date></corr></ref>). They had, in fact, also dined at Thackeray&#x2019;s on Christmas Day <date when="1850-12-25">1850</date>:</p>
<q>But it was a great privilege to have him a few nights before assaulting Reeve of the P. Council Office. He was offended I think and very justly by Reeves white neckcloth w<hi rend="italic">h.</hi> was a great deal too tall and white, and he ran at him and tossed him and gored him in a way w<hi rend="italic">h.</hi> every body admired. At my house he said Genius was universal &#x26; could do anything it had a mind to, when I asked him if he could dance like Taglioni or sing ravishingly or paint like Landseer upon the whole he was rather inclined to think he could&#x2014;about w<hi rend="italic">h.</hi> some people may have their doubts. But the very vagaries and errors of men of Genius are rich and instructive. (<date when="1851-12-29">29 December</date>)</q>
<p>It happens that the pre-dinner call was made just when Thackeray was about to review Carlyle&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Life of John Sterling</hi>, a work that we have always known he found &#x201C;delightful,&#x201C; though by accident he has been burdened with the disgrace of being thought the author of a savage attack on the biography in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, which was really by a journalist, Samuel Phillips. Thackeray&#x2019;s <pb id="pg-26-xii" n="26:xii"/>daughter Annie, who was then only a child, must have got it into her head that her father had written about the work, and much later foolishly declared that he was responsible for this bigoted and prejudiced assault on Carlyle, which thus went on to be included in the <hi rend="italic">Centenary</hi> edition of her father&#x2019;s works. In fact, we now see that when he replied to Lady Ashburton, in <date when="1851-11">November 1851</date>, accepting her invitation to the Grange for himself and the children, he added:</p>
<q>Of course you have read Sterling&#x2019;s life. It is delightful I think (though Sterling a poor critic speaks very slightingly of somebody [William Baring, later Lord Ashburton] whom he met at Madeira and who has I believe 10 times more brains than gentlemen with longer tongues): but I am so glad when I can read and like something writ by the great Master of Craigenputtoch. It feels like a reconciliation: and having admired and believed as a lad, and revolted and doubted as a man, I feel guilty and as it were treacherous towards him. I have written a little notice in the Leader&#x2014;not about the feelings with w<hi rend="italic">h.</hi> one reads it, and recals the friends of dear Youth. I send my best regards to Lord Ashburton. Poor Brookfield is gone &#x26; going to Madeira for 6 months very ill indeed but not so ill as he thinks himself I think.</q>
<p>Attractive as such letters are in themselves, they have much to say that bears on this period of the <hi rend="italic">Carlyle Letters.</hi> The &#x201C;little notice&#x201C; is remarkable in what it tells of Thackeray&#x2019;s feelings, his &#x201C;glimpses of the biographer,&#x201C; and Carlyle&#x2019;s delicacy and tenderness. For Carlyle is shown as far from being the Calvinistic prophet of a lame tradition that is still so desperately hard to dispose of. As soon as Sterling&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Life</hi> appeared, it was attacked by hacks and bigots precisely because it was liberal and open-minded, which is something reflected in notes elsewhere in this volume. But, writing with tight-lipped anonymity in the socialist <hi rend="italic">Leader</hi>, Thackeray remarkably champions it:</p>
<q>Turning to other considerations, let us not forget to note the plain and emphatic language in which at last he speaks out his deep-rooted antagonism to all Established Churches. Much abuse, much hatred, this will probably draw down. Is not the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> article an alarum? To all orthodox minds Carlyle must now unhesitatingly stand confessed as <hi rend="italic">not</hi> of them. Hitherto he has written on religious subjects, as if he hated Cant and Shams; but somehow, by the very ambiguity of his language, he has always seemed <hi rend="italic">to have a Bishop in tow.</hi> Now he has fairly cut cables, and leaves the Bishop to tow himself as best he may. &#x2026; Not that Carlyle has passed over to our camp. We cannot accurately determine <hi rend="italic">what</hi> his religious opinions are. In the greater cause, however, &#x2026; Carlyle is working by his powerful denunciations against the <hi rend="italic">make-believe</hi> which reigns at the present day.</q>
<p><pb id="pg-26-xiii" n="26:xiii"/>The same letter that mentions the <hi rend="italic">Leader</hi> may remind us of other matters: that <hi rend="italic">Henry Esmond</hi>, for example, which Thackeray was then writing and was to publish next year, was dedicated to Lord Ashburton, and that this was because of the &#x201C;great kindness and friendship&#x201C; he (and his wife) had shown him at a time of difficulty and unhappiness. They, at least, would have understood that this was caused by the deep distress that Thackeray felt at the sudden disruption in his affectionate relations with Jane Brookfield, which came about after her uncle Henry Hallam had spoken on the subject to her husband, the Rev. William Brookfield. And though the Carlyles were not present at the Grange on the weekend at the end of <date when="1851-10">October 1851</date> when the Ashburtons worked without success to reconcile Thackeray and the Brookfields, it is hard to imagine that they can have been unaware of what was going on. That, after all, is why the relationship was broken, because it was being noticed; and the affair, in itself, once more suggests something, about the genuine kindness of the Ashburtons, evidence for which does not rest solely on the testimony of such friends as Monckton Milnes, writing about Lady Ashburton long afterward as Lord Houghton in his <hi rend="italic">Monographs</hi> <date when="1873">(1873)</date>. We see it again in the present volume when the Ashburtons drive over to invite the Brookfields to stay while they are waiting to embark for Madeira. They were clearly respected for both their generosity and affection as well as their munificence. So, though there are already lights and shades, even in Carlyle&#x2019;s pictures of the Grange and their other homes, they are sure to be more apparent when we can look more closely at the new papers.</p>
<p>Yet there is more to see in the presence of Thackeray at the Grange and the dedication of <hi rend="italic">Esmond</hi>, though that did not appear until <date when="1852">1852</date>. Perhaps Carlyle also felt a touch of jealousy at Thackeray&#x2019;s being invited with his daughters at the end of the year, since he wrote at the time to his brother John that Thackeray was &#x201C;not a good or well-found ship in such waters on such a voyage&#x201C; (A. Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">NL</hi> 2:122). Perhaps Carlyle was not fully aware how sympathetic Lady Harriet was to Brookfield, who was rather in the same position as Lady Castlewood, and that Carlyle may have felt much the same.</p>
<p>More could be said of these relations, though not perhaps about <date when="1851">1851</date>, and there is more to find out in connection with other familiar names whose letters are in the Ashburton Papers, such as Edward Ellice, Thiers, John Stuart Mill and Charles Buller at an earlier period, and even Theresa Revis, otherwise Becky Sharp, and so on. It is less likely that other figures will reveal themselves so well as such a supreme writer as Thackeray. Yet they remain to be explored if we are to understand the Carlyles&#x2019; milieu when they were with the Ashburtons, for the Carlyle letters themselves are not simply about their own domestic drama.</p>
<p>It is important to think what Lady Ashburton was like, and to reinterpret <pb id="pg-26-xiv" n="26:xiv"/>what the letters say without accepting the generalizations of those who did not know her. This means that the comments of someone such as Lord Houghton are important; his frankness about her disdainful wit is balanced by a sense of her ability to make &#x201C;high comedy&#x201C; from everyday life and her encouragement of the &#x201C;freest exercise of intellectual gaiety.&#x201C; He said the same scribbled in a copy of his <hi rend="italic">Palm Leaves</hi> (<date when="1844">1844</date>) given to her:</p>
<lg><l>Take a leaf and write on it</l>
<l>Thanks that still on earth</l>
<l>Grecian Art and Gallic Wit</l>
<l>Blend with English worth:</l>
<l>Palm-Leaves are a poor exchange</l>
<l>For the friendship of &#x2018;the Grange.&#x2019;</l>
<l>(J. Pope-Hennesy, <hi rend="italic">Monckton Milnes</hi> [<date when="1949">1949</date>&#x2013;<date when="1951">51</date>] 1:161)</l></lg>
<p>Yet it is also said that Lady Harriet did everything possible to bring rich and poor into &#x201C;sympathetic communion,&#x201C; that her dying thoughts were of &#x201C;her villagers,&#x201C; and that she &#x201C;would postpone any &#x2026; pleasure to the calls of duty.&#x201C; That it is difficult to generalize about her can be seen by reading Froude&#x2019;s careful comments on her in his life of Carlyle, and then certain of his remarks to her successor, Louisa, Lady Ashburton.</p>
<p>For, acting freely with papers that had been left to Carlyle&#x2019;s niece Mary Aitken Carlyle, Froude wrote to Louisa,<date when="1881-02-18">18 February (1881)</date>, saying that he had found &#x201C;a great many letters of yours and many of your daughters,&#x201C; and asking her wishes about them: &#x201C;There are also a great many of Lady Harriet&#x2019;s.&#x201C; Froude and Louisa were already friends, so this was natural. In fact, before Carlyle&#x2019;s death, he had refused an invitation from her, when on <date when="1880-04-20">20 April (1880)</date> he felt</p>
<q>entirely drowned in the Carlyle Papers. Weeks ago I was up to the eyes in them; and now they are flowing in my head, and only by desperately sticking to this work can I hope to escape suffocation. I have put it off too long. In fact I had not meant to take up things in earnest while he continued with us. But he has grown anxious that some progress should be made or at least that I should be able to tell him what I intended to do&#x2014; He grows perceptibly weaker, month after month, &#x26; believes perhaps with reason that his release is not far off.</q>
<q>What a story it is! They had, both of them [TC and JWC] a faculty of attracting vehement Platonics affection. If we had Don Quixote&#x2019;s letters to Dulcinea they would [be] extremely like Lord Jeffrey&#x2019;s letters to M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle which I have been arranging this morning&#x2014; The world I fancy must be wickeder than it was 45 years ago. No one now a days would <pb id="pg-26-xv" n="26:xv"/>know what to make of expressions of such passionate adoration. Only Carlyle&#x2019;s genius could succeed in describing it as it really was. She was less a woman than a half human elf.&#x2014; C. in one of his letters to her quotes a sermon which he had heard about Ananias &#x26; Sapphira in which the preacher said: &#x2018;I fear my brethren he was tempted by a spirit more wicked than his <hi rend="italic">wife.</hi>&#x2019;</q>
<q>But I must not trouble you with all this.</q>
<p>Then on <date when="1881-06-02">2 June 1881</date> or <date when="1882-06-02">1882</date>, Froude writes:</p>
<q>I find the two accompanying letters this morning. There must not be so much as a chance of their falling into Mary Carlyle&#x2019;s hands, so I enclose them to you.</q>
<q>Oh dear. I sometimes think Lady Harriet was an evil spirit. No malignant Elf could have caused more misery.</q>
<q>And yet, I suppose it was to be. It had been much the same at Craigenputtoch. If one provocation had escaped, there would have been another in its place.</q>
<q>Was there ever in this world a man with such extraordinary powers, yet with no more power over himself than a crying baby?</q>
<q>The wise world which is so ready with its criticisms knows so well what it is talking about.</q>
<p>One might wonder about the last sentence, or ask did the image from <hi rend="italic">Don Quixote</hi> seem so happy that it was transferred&#x2014;as it was&#x2014;from Jeffrey to Carlyle in the biography? Or, what were the purloined letters about? Or was Froude, who never knew Lady Harriet, right in thinking that he was getting out of his depth? Questions remain, and so far as the rest of the Ashburton papers go, much must be left for future volumes.</p>
<p>The year <date when="1851">1851</date> remains of continued interest as shown in other new letters. Public affairs, for example, sometimes overshadowed private. The Great Exhibition in the Crystal Palace in Hyde Park was a symbol of peace as well as industry, a Peace Congress was held at Exeter Hall, and even Carlyle was cajoled into declaring in support that, &#x201C;sure enough, &#x201C; peace &#x201C;is the perpetual law for every man in his individual and social capacity&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-26/lt-18510718-TC-HR-01">TC to <sic>ER</sic><corr>HR</corr>, <date when="1851-07-18">18 July</date></ref>). Both Thomas and Jane continued to be concerned about Mazzini. After Louis Napoleon&#x2019;s coup in Paris in <date when="1851-12">December</date>, Jane Carlyle at the Grange found that &#x201C;We talk the French Revolution from morning to night; till I am perfectly sick of it.&#x201C; The home of Lady Ashburton&#x2019;s mother was in Paris; her son-in-law was French ambassador to Britain; and in <date when="1851-10">October</date>, Carlyle had paid Paris a short visit with the Ashburtons, all apparently unaware of the impending change.</p>
<p>Religious controversy continued to be intense in <date when="1851">1851</date>, but Carlyle&#x2019;s opinions, <pb id="lastpage-26-xvi" n="26:xvi"/>though passed freely, were rightly recognized by Thackeray as contemptuously above contemporary fears of &#x201C;papal aggression.&#x201C;</p>
<p>Carlyle&#x2019;s attention was returning to history. In <date when="1851-11">November</date> the long shadow of Frederick the Great cast itself across his life when he began reading the pedantic biography by Johann Preuss, &#x201C;One of the dullest Books of this era, and one of the greatest men&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-26/lt-18511122-TC-LA-01">TC to <sic>Lady A</sic><corr>LA</corr>, <date when="1851-11-22">22 Nov.</date></ref>). It was a task he had considered for several years, though he declared that he had no clear intention of writing on him. For the next fifteen years this was to dominate life at 5 Cheyne Row.</p>

The Carlyles visit Pentonville prison (<date when="1851-01-02">2</date>). They continue to help Lady Bulwer Lytton; and Theresa Revis comes to stay (<date when="1851-01-01">1</date>&#x2013;<date when="1851-01-04">4</date>). TC finds it hard to settle to writing, and so copies some notes on Icelandic literature (<date when="1851-01-22">22</date>). JWC finds Fanny the maid satisfactory after her troubles the previous year. TC writes that he has finally decided against buying a Dumfriesshire house as a summer retreat. Nero is stolen (<date when="1851-01-22">22</date>), but returned. Anthony Sterling, after a difference, is temporarily restored to the Carlyles&#x2019; circle (<date when="1851-01-23">23</date>). TC goes for a short visit to the Grange (<date when="1851-01-30">30</date>).</p>
<p><date when="1851-02"><hi rend="italic">February.</hi></date> TC tells his brother John that he has started what is to be his life of Sterling. Amalie B&#xF6;lte, now a near neighbor, often calls on JWC. The rising Crystal Palace is reported to be attracting public attention. Lord Russell resigns (<date when="1851-02-21">21</date>).

He sees Gavan Duffy, F. D. Maurice, Edward Twisleton, and various others. TC is very pessimistic about politics.</p>

Disgusted with a portrait of himself from Hogg&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Instructor</hi>, he burns it (<date when="1851-04-06">6</date>), but sends a copy of Woolner&#x2019;s medallion to his mother (<date when="1851-04-10">10</date>). Chapman agrees to publish <hi rend="italic">Sterling</hi> (<date when="1851-04-12">12</date>), and Forster returns a copy of the manuscript with his comments (<date when="1851-04-25">25</date>).</p>
<p><date when="1851-05"><hi rend="italic">May.</hi></date> The Crystal Palace opens (<date when="1851-05-01">1</date>), and the Carlyles visit the Exhibition (<date when="1851-05-08">8</date>). The printing of <hi rend="italic">Sterling</hi> begins and its proof read (<date when="1851-05-08">8</date>). TC is keen to study Icelandic but has given up the idea of going to Copenhagen. JWC prepares to change servants. They both attend the first of a new series of Thackeray&#x2019;s lectures (<date when="1851-05-22">22</date>), followed by others.</p>
<p><date when="1851-06"><hi rend="italic">June.</hi></date> Nero again stolen (<date when="1851-06-04">4</date>) and returned (<date when="1851-06-07">7</date>).

Geraldine Jewsbury reported in London and <pb id="pg-26-xxiv" n="26:xxiv"/>seeing JWC; TC attends a fancy dress ball given by Lady Ashburton (<date when="1851-06-17">17</date>). After a breakfast with Lord Mahon (<date when="1851-06-30">30</date>), TC with eighty-three other signatories sends a letter to Lord Romilly, master of the rolls, asking for better access to official records.</p>
<p><date when="1851-07"><hi rend="italic">July.</hi></date> JWC writes that she &#x201C;breakfasts&#x201C; at Bath House at 3 <hi rend="small-caps">p.m.</hi> (<date when="1851-07-01">1</date>) and attends Thackeray&#x2019;s last lecture (<date when="1851-07-03">3</date>). Half of <hi rend="italic">Sterling</hi> printed, TC writes to Emerson about an approved U.S. edition. Mazzini visits weekly. The Carlyles decide to go to Malvern for the water cure. Tauchnitz publishes TC&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">French Revolution</hi> and Joseph Neuberg&#x2019;s translation of TC&#x2019;s writing on work accepted for publication. TC finishes the proofs of <hi rend="italic">Sterling</hi> (<date when="1851-07-29">29</date>).</p>
<p><date when="1851-08"><hi rend="italic">August.</hi></date> The Carlyles arrive in Malvern (<date when="1851-08-02">2</date>), though only TC takes the water cure. With rest and quiet both enjoy better health. Visitors passing through include Nassau Senior, Robert Farie, and Edward Twisleton. Early copies of <hi rend="italic">Sterling</hi> are sent to TC&#x2019;s mother and to E. P. Clark in Boston, who is to arrange for an American edition (<date when="1851-08-19">19</date>). TC encourages the Brownings to write recollections of Margaret Fuller Ossoli for Emerson. JWC still uncertain about her further plans for a holiday when they leave for Liverpool (<date when="1851-08-30">30</date>), after which TC goes on to Scotsbrig.</p>
<p><date when="1851-09"><hi rend="italic">September.</hi></date> TC arrives at Scotsbrig (<date when="1851-09-01">1</date>), and JWC leaves for Manchester to visit Geraldine Jewsbury. TC joins JWC at Manchester, where he stays with the Gaskells (<date when="1851-09-16">16</date>&#x2013;<date when="1851-09-17">17</date>). They go on to the Stanleys at Alderley, then home (<date when="1851-09-19">19</date>). TC leaves for Paris with the Brownings (<date when="1851-09-25">25</date>) to join the Ashburtons there (<date when="1851-09-26">26</date>), with whom he stays. JWC visits the Exhibition again, with Neuberg; drives out with Darwin; and visits the Chorleys.</p>
<p><date when="1851-10"><hi rend="italic">October.</hi></date> TC returns home (<date when="1851-10-02">2</date>), generally avoids company, reads historical works, and searches for a new subject. <hi rend="italic">Sterling</hi> published and warmly praised by Forster in the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> (<date when="1851-10-18">18</date>).

TC reads Preuss on Frederick the Great, &#x201C;the last of all our &#x2018;kings&#x2019;&#x201C; (<date when="1851-11-14">14</date>). JWC accepts an invitation to the Grange in advance of TC&#x2019;s carefully postponed arrival (<date when="1851-11-16">16</date>). <hi rend="italic">Sterling</hi> is revised for a second edition. The <hi rend="italic">Revue des Deux Mondes</hi> continues its interest in TC.</p>
<p><date when="1851-12"><hi rend="italic">December.</hi></date> JWC joins Lady Ashburton and her mother, Lady Sandwich, at the Grange (<date when="1851-12-01">1</date>), where they make dolls&#x2019; clothes as Christmas gifts.

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Wishing right heartily &#x201C;a happy new year&#x201C; to you all, I have, this day, with a considerable struggle, corded up and sent off by the Caledonian Railway, a Parcel addressed to you, which I hope Jamie will get for you, and pay, at the Swaugh,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Swaughpark, nr. Ecclefechan station; see <ref target="volume-22/lt-18471002-TC-AC-01"><sic>22:108</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1847-10-02">2 Oct. 1847</date></corr></ref>.</note> one of these days. He is to <hi rend="italic">pay</hi> it, and mark the amount to me; which I will settle, along with the sovereign he was to give to poor John Carlyle:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A cousin, probably the son of TC&#x2019;s uncle John (<date when="1754">1754</date>&#x2013;<date when="1801">1801</date>); see <ref target="volume-26/lt-18510124-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1851-01-24">24 Jan.</date></ref></note> I will pay him both together. And let somebody write <hi rend="italic">as soon</hi> as the Parcel gets fairly to hand. There are some bits of Books in it: one (<hi rend="italic">Crookshank</hi>,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-25/lt-18501214-TC-MAC-01"><sic>25:307</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1850-12-14">14 Dec. 1850</date></corr></ref>.</note> which I am sorry to see so very
<hi rend="italic">dim</hi>, but could not get another copy) is for yourself; one is for Jamie; another is for Jenny:<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC&#x2019;s brother, James Carlyle (m. to Isabella), and sister, Janet Hanning, living at Scotsbrig with their mother. TC was evidently tidying up his books and papers on New Year&#x2019;s Day. On the wrapper of a notebook he wrote: &#x201C;Old <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> Notebook (one of several, very bad <hi rend="italic">paper</hi>&#x2014; &#x2026; put aside, <date when="1851-01">jan<hi rend="italic">y</hi> 1851</date>)&#x201C; (MS: Yale). Other Cromwell material left over from the days when he had thought of writing a full biography instead of a presentation of the letters and speeches &#x201C;with elucidations&#x201C; he sent about this time to J. R. Chorley to be selected and copied with an eye to publication. Chorley wrote TC, <date when="1851-03-21">21 March</date>: &#x201C;Having now done my work as well as I can, let me make a brief report on the result. / I believe I have sifted out all that is sufficiently written out to take its place at once in a series of &#x2018;chapters,&#x2019; or &#x2018;Sketches Tempore O.C.&#x2019; But there is an abundance of matter not so forward, which only requires the author&#x2019;s hand to merit the collection with many others of great interest. / As it is, the collection is fit, I venture to say, with <hi rend="italic">very</hi> little care from your hand (&#x2014;in rounding off, introducing, &#x26; here &#x26; there crossing out what is reported else where, or has been specially introduced for its former purpose)&#x2014;to make a most inviting little volume. The chapters I found already copied out will require most of this care: those I have transcribed having been of finished passages, from which I omitted what was not equally available. You will, however, see, how seldom this has been necessary. It is the only liberty I have taken. / I have filled up dates, &#x26; extracts, wherever I could, &#x26; in the parts I have copied there is, I think, little wanting in this way but a reference or two from the &#x2018;Commons&#x2019; Journals,&#x2019; which I had not within reach. A good many of the references, too, have been supplied in the M.S. previously copied; but as these will ask for a revision generally by you, I have not in all cases gone far in search of allusions that might not afterwards be retained. / When you have looked them over, I shall be most ready to do whatever else you may think I can, in order to further the completion of the text. / That you will not allow so much of what is good, the fruit of so much labour, to moulder in a box, I must earnestly beg:&#x2014;In copying my part, I have found only new reasons to desire this, for the profit of all who would fain come nearer to the Life of English History,&#x2014;as well as for my own comfort &#x26; pleasure. / I enclose the list of articles;&#x2014;ranged by date,&#x2014;as they stand now adjusted&#x2014;subject to your better judgement. You will see that in bulk the two divisions &#x2018;Charles&#x2019; &#x26; &#x2018;James&#x2019; are pretty nearly equal.&#x201C; At the time TC was too busy with his biography of John Sterling and preparing for his life of Frederick the Great to deal with the material he had given Chorley. Fourteen years after Chorley returned the papers, TC bundled them up and docketed them: &#x201C;About James I. and Charles I. The Chorley Transcript, with the <hi rend="italic">Original</hi>, probably about <date when="1849">1849</date>;&#x2014;have not looked at it since; nor will. T.C., <date when="1865-02-18">18 Feby. 1865</date>&#x201C; (MS of the &#x201C;original&#x201C;: Strouse; the transcript is lost). In his will, made in <date when="1873">1873</date>, he refers to it as &#x201C;a set of fragments about James I., which were loyally fished out for me from much other Cromwellian rubbish, and doubtless carefully copied more than twenty years ago, by the late John Chorley who was always so good to me.&#x201C; Much of the material was published as <hi rend="italic">Historical Sketches of Notable Persons and Events in the Reigns of James I. and Charles I. by Thomas Carlyle</hi>, ed. Alexander Carlyle (<date when="1898">1898</date>). The quotations from TC can also be found in the pref. (vii).</note> one or two are not marked <pb id="pg-26-2" n="26:2"/>to anybody,&#x2014;indeed they are of next to no value at all;&#x2014;and you may give them to whosoever has Bookshelves and a taste for them. The rest of the <foreign><hi rend="italic">duddery</hi></foreign> and articles (your own &#x201C;unions&#x201C; among them), except a rag of a neck-scarf marked for Isabella, are very much at Mother&#x2019;s disposal! I have had my own battle tying them up; but flatter myself it is done in a workmanlike manner at last! Unhappily the whole affair, except as a proof of my love, is worth so very little,&#x2014;if anything at all!</p>
<p>And here farther, dear Mother, is a bit of a Bank-picture;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A banknote.</note> which I want you to split in two halves; one half for Isabella along with the scarf, or neck-comforter;&#x2014;the other half you are to take, and buy <hi rend="italic">yourself</hi> some newyear&#x2019;s thing that will be of use to you. Do, dear Mother; if I could myself know anything that would do you good, how gladly would I get it for you! I think there is no duty in this world that I ought more gladly to do. Oh, my dear good Mother, let us all thank the Divine Beneficence for you and for ourselves. Have we not, as you often say, &#x201C;Many Mercies, &#x201C;&#x2014;very many, and very precious,&#x2014;to acknowledge?&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>Our weather is strong from the <hi rend="italic">West</hi>, as warm and soft an atmosphere at Newyeardays as I almost ever saw. Not much rain, nor even fog; only the streets very clammy. People here do not much mind Newyearday; but they have been very diligently <hi rend="italic">eating</hi> and drinking since Christmas, this day week. Both Jane and I are wonderfully well, for <hi rend="italic">us;</hi>&#x2014;that &#x201C;for us&#x201C; is not a very high figure on the scale; but we ought to rejoice it is so well.</p>
<p>Thank Jenny for her Letter; we were right thankful to have her news. I will write a line to John<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >His brother, John Aitken Carlyle.</note> too, now that my hand is in; and after that it will be high time for me to take <hi rend="italic">the street</hi> for an hour or so. Yesterday we had a Note from Jean<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Aitken, his sister.</note> at Dumfries; to whom by her request I am sending off the <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine</hi> of this month. Do you care anything about these Magazines at Scotsbrig? The same N<hi rend="italic">o</hi>, by a little management, might readily serve both <pb id="pg-26-3" n="26:3"/>houses.&#x2014;Dear Mother, need I say that I pray with my whole heart for all blessings on you! <closer><salute>May God guide and bless us all always!&#x2014;</salute></closer></p>

John Carlyle wrote, <date when="1850-12-26">26 Dec. 1850</date>, saying that he had arrived there, <date when="1850-12-24">24 Dec.</date></note> or I might have written to you sooner. Your Note on Saturday first told me clearly where you were. I must send you one word of New-year&#x2019;s day wishes, tho&#x2019; extremely hurried today.</p>
<p>I have just been wrapping up a Package of small <foreign><hi rend="italic">etceteras</hi></foreign> for my Mother at Scotsbrig; which operation, besides hurting my fingers, has thoroughly fagged me,&#x2014;as well as consumed all my time;&#x2014;but it is well worth while if it give our good Mother a moment&#x2019;s pleasure on this solemn day of the Year. To you, dear Brother, I have nothing but my poor wish of &#x201C;Happy Newyear&#x201C;; but I wished somehow to send you that, in writing; tho&#x2019; I well know you give me credit for always thinking it and feeling it, whether I write it or not.&#x2014; Ah me, ah me, it is a stern affair this course of earthly existence for the sons of men! But we will say, as poor Edward Irving used to do in the like case, &#x201C;May the <hi rend="italic">worst</hi> of our Years be past!&#x201C;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> 157.</note>&#x2014;and so leave these reflexions. &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Wir heissen euch hoffen</hi></foreign> [We bid you to hope]&#x201C;; that truly is the divine message to us: &#x201C;Work, and despair not.&#x201C;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Goethe, &#x201C;Symbolum&#x201C;; see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18360911-TC-JOST-01"><sic>9:53</sic><corr>TC to JOST, <date when="1836-09-11">11 Sept. 1836</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014;</p>

<p>After all you have told me, and with all my ardent <foreign><hi rend="italic">esprit de corps</hi></foreign>, what excited in me the <hi rend="italic">realest</hi>, the most <hi rend="italic">human</hi> sympathy for you, is this brave eagerness to do <hi rend="italic">anything</hi> in <hi rend="italic">honesty</hi> for the discharge of your involuntary debts. Surely if we fail to give you any furtherance in this good purpose of yours, it shall not be for want of earnest wishing and trying.</p>
<p>When you describe that man and his treatment of you, I feel <hi rend="italic">amazed</hi> before the whole thing, as in the presence of the Infinite; it is all so diabolical&#x2014;so out of the course of nature, that I, who have mercifully had to do with only imperfect <hi rend="italic">human</hi> beings at <hi rend="italic">worst, never</hi> with an incarnate devil, cannot <hi rend="italic">realise</hi> it to myself, and cannot get any more intelligent impression from it than from a bad dream, or a Balzac novel.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Honor&#xE9; de Balzac (<date when="1799">1799</date>&#x2013;<date when="1850">1850</date>), French novelist, author of <hi rend="italic">La Com&#xE9;die Humaine.</hi> see <ref target="volume-25/lt-18501231-TC-LBL-01"><sic>25:324&#x2013;25</sic><corr>TC to LBL, <date when="1850-12-31">31 Dec. 1850</date></corr></ref>; both Lyttons were extravagant but, while her husband&#x2019;s income had greatly increased, he had kept hers fixed at &#xa3;400 per annum, and on returning to England in <date when="1847">1847</date> she had begun &#x201C;proceedings to obtain an increase&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Unpublished Letters</hi> 24).</note></p>
<p>The very <hi rend="italic">inhumanness</hi> of your wrongs makes it impossible for me to pity them after a right genuine human fashion; but when, not only superior but defiant of fine Ladyism and &#x2018;all that sort of thing,&#x2019; you speak resolutely of <hi rend="italic">helping</hi> yourself, and set forth your <hi rend="italic">qualifications</hi> for a <hi rend="italic">Housekeeper</hi>, a Companion,&#x2014;you brought up to be waited upon, and one of the <hi rend="italic">cleverest authoresses</hi> in England!&#x2014;then my whole practical Scotch nature applauds you, and cries &#x2018;God speed you!&#x2019; &#x2026;</p>

<salute>Dear Madam,</salute>
<p>I have been at two Booksellers about your <hi rend="italic">Mss.</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The publication of <hi rend="italic">Miriam Sedley</hi> (see <ref target="volume-25/lt-18501231-TC-LBL-01"><sic>25:324</sic><corr>TC to LBL, <date when="1850-12-31">31 Dec. 1850</date></corr></ref>), which her husband, Sir Edward Bulwer Lytton, may have done something to hinder. The publishers mentioned are Edward Moxon, Chapman &#x26; Hall (TC&#x2019;s own, now at 193 Piccadilly), William Shoberl, Thomas Cautley Newby, Smith Elder &#x26; Co., of 65 Cornhill, and John William Parker.</note> Moxon, a discreet judicious kind of man, of cautious habits, could himself (as indeed I had expected) do nothing with the work; but he gave me his best counsel in regard to it, and engaged, for the rest, to observe strict silence, and at least do no harm in these sad affairs, if he could be of no benefit. Which, alas, seems nearly all that any of us can engage with confidence to do!</p>
<p>To Chapman &#x26; Hall, who are Sir E.&#x2019;s Publishers, it was clear, I must not in any way apply. From Schoberl, I found, there would ultimately no money be got,&#x2014;the man himself having none. Newby, and others whom I forget, my oracle spoke of as dry sources for various reasons,&#x2014;useless to apply to. In short he could bethink him of no Publishing House in the least likely, except that of Smith Elder &#x26; C<hi rend="italic">o</hi>,&#x2014;respectable people whom I do not myself know, but could have access to, if need were. He agreed with me, however, in the persuasion that I could intrinsically do the Book no good; that it would stand or fall on its own merits, and suitableness for the market; he added too that the present was &#x201C;a bad season for novels&#x201C; &#x26;c &#x26;c, as is the wont of that kind of persons. On the whole he seemed to think that the best chance of <hi rend="italic">money</hi> for the Book would be in publishing it at first piecemeal <hi rend="italic">in a Magazine</hi>, out of which it could be collected afterwards if there seemed a farther chance of sale. On this last hint, such as it was, I have proceeded, with due caution, a step farther; step capable of being <hi rend="italic">retraced</hi>, if your own view be disinclined to it. I went yesterday to Parker of <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine;</hi> proposed the Novel to him; describing it as by a Lady of rank, and of such and such a quality and tenor: <pb id="pg-26-10" n="26:10"/>Parker, a quick clever little fellow, and of honourable correct habits in business, did not absolutely say No; was already &#x201C;engaged with an Autobiography for three months to come&#x201C;; spoke of the free flowing pen of women, and the necessity of correcting and here and there cu<supplied>[rt]</supplied>ailing them (all this in a cheerful polite fashion);&#x2014;on the whole gave me no absolute hope of succeeding with him; but wished, as the preliminary of all things, to see the <hi rend="italic">Mss.</hi> On this I engaged &#x201C;to consult the lady, and send him answer of yes or no, in a day or two&#x201C;: and there the matter, till your decision come, is resting. P<hi rend="italic">r</hi> does not the least seek to know the <hi rend="italic">name</hi>, at present; but, before deciding to publish, his rule is that <hi rend="italic">He</hi> must know it, the work may still be anonymous to the world, or not, as is judged best.&#x2014; This is all the length we have yet gone. If you instruct me to send P<hi rend="italic">r</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Mss</hi>, he shall have it, and will return it without much delay. Or would you rather have it kept out of his hand, and reserved for its destinies in another direction? I think he at least could do it no ill. But pray let me know what your will is, and it shall be followed.</p>
<p>My Wife is nearly thro&#x2019; the <hi rend="italic">Mss</hi>, the conclusion of which you send today; she has read me passages as she went along: a friendly critic you have in her; and one whose judgement I have learned to trust before my own in regard to such matters. She reports that the Book is of loose structure, not setting up to have much of a story, or any romance interest; that it will require correction before printing, and would be decidedly improved by curtailment (especially from before the middle of the <hi rend="italic">First</hi> to past the middle of the <hi rend="italic">Second Volume</hi>, which seems to be the weak part of the work);&#x2014;for the rest that it is brisk, lively, wholesome and agreeable reading; a fresh vigorous spirit of observation looking thro&#x2019; it, and a great variety of sound and practically useful benefits and remarks turning up, as the cheery life-like delineation of affairs goes on:&#x2014;in short a work very fit to maintain its place among such rivals as it has: a strong and clever woman&#x2019;s work, who has <hi rend="italic">done it in great haste:</hi> that I suppose to be really something like the verdict. Perhaps if Parker will have it, he were the best vehicle? We have still Smith Elder &#x26; C<hi rend="italic">y;</hi> and whatever hope may be in them, be it great or little, I am willing to exhaust, either at this or at a subsequent stage of the affair: after which there is not definitely clear to me anything farther that I can do.</p>
<p>You perceive, dear Madam, how poor my program is, and what a sorry horoscope the best I can offer of this affair is. I judge it kinder as well as more honest to give it you without embellishment or extenuation: the bare fact, tho&#x2019; we paint it an inch thick,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi> 5.1.</note> will come bare upon us at last. My vague sad guess is, there can little money be got for this Book; if &#xa3;150, or &#xa3;200 or even &#xa3;100, it will seem to me not surprising: and, alas, I am too well aware how bitterly inadequate such a sum is to give any effectual help in your situation.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-26-11" n="26:11"/>I at no time thought of applying to Sir E<hi rend="italic">d</hi> to let you have fair play in your literary endeavours; nor indeed have I acquaintance-ship or other imaginable authority for applying to him (without transcendent impertinence) on any branch of this truly miserable business. But I confess, from the first time I saw you, my one notion of any effectual help for you was in the possibility of his being advised to increase your income; and I felt that, had I been his intimate, I would with emphasis have represented to him how seemly such a step on his part would be,&#x2014;nay how much it behoved him, whatever his provocation against you was, to <hi rend="italic">do</hi> this act at once of generosity and justice, an honourable and blessed action <hi rend="italic">still</hi> possible in the tragic ruin which all the rest was!&#x2014; Falling in with Sir F. Doyle,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sir Francis Hastings Charles Doyle (<date when="1810">1810</date>&#x2013;<date when="1888">88</date>; <ref target="volume-26/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/7998"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), 2d bart., poet, and barrister, whom TC knew since <date when="1841">1841</date> (see <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410409-TC-JWC-01"><sic>13:88</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1841-04-09">9 April 1841</date></corr></ref>); m., <date when="1844">1844</date>, to Sidney, b. Williams Wynn, Charlotte Wynn&#x2019;s youngest sister. The son of Lady Bulwer Lytton&#x2019;s mother&#x2019;s first cousin, the 1st bart., he was to be the trustee of her matrimonial separation.</note> I cautiously ventured to speak with him of your affairs; found him participate in my feelings to the full;&#x2014;and am heartily glad that he has been awakened to friendly activity in them. I saw him again on Sunday; and cannot forbear the hope that some good may result from this interference of his,&#x2014;which I earnestly beg you to second with all the powers of <hi rend="italic">goodness</hi>, passive or active, that are in your exasperated and heavy-laden heart: for I assure you, dear Madam, there does not seem to me any other outlook of help for you worth comparing to this; and Sir Francis, a man of benevolence, integrity, and good judgement, authorized by his relationship to you, is willing to try all that can be done in it. Again I entreat you to second him with your best ability. It is possible your other friends and he may actually accomplish something.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Letter</hi><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >One in which she evidently thought of stating her wrongs; see <ref target="volume-25/lt-18501231-TC-LBL-01"><sic>25:324&#x2013;25</sic><corr>TC to LBL, <date when="1850-12-31">31 Dec. 1850</date></corr></ref>.</note> has lain sealed up in an Envelope since Sunday gone a week,&#x2014;with a new charge and entreaty to exert all the strength of soul you have in heroically holding your peace as to those sorrowful matters!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >As well as being consulted about the MS, JWC discussed Lady Bulwer Lytton&#x2019;s sense of injustice with Geraldine Jewsbury, who wrote to JWC, <date when="1851-02-06">6</date> <date when="1851-02-07">[7] Feb.</date>: &#x201C;The more I hear of her, the more sorry I feel for her. But can you not inoculate her with some of your own judgment and sense? Good gracious! where or what would you be now if you had gone on passionately protesting, and refusing to bear anything but what you thought you deserved? Do make her feel that she is not the only ill-used woman in the world. And if you could only make her more patient, and less bitter, it would be more to her benefit than any recognition of her wrongs or increase of income, or even any amount of justice or sympathy&#x201C; (Ireland 390).</note> That is really my advice; and is just,&#x2014;and not unmerciful, tho&#x2019; it may see<supplied>[m]</supplied> so at first.</p>
<p>Be pleased to let me know what I am to do with Parker. Surely you shall be very welcome here whenever you please to call. There is one wish respecting you in this house, the wish which you may challenge from all honest human <pb id="pg-26-12" n="26:12"/>hearts, That we knew how to help you in any measure, or to pacify those sad miseries which has made such havock in your life and you.</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I am come upstairs, with the lamp, after dinner, to write you a word, according to request; in the forenoon I failed, from various causes of interruption, and had at last to take my walk <hi rend="italic">re infect&#xe2;</hi> [with the thing undone].</p>
<p>We have got various short Notes from you; but generally your movements have succeeded each other so fast, I have not known whitherward with certainty to write,&#x2014;not to say, furthermore, that I have been rather unfit and indisposed to write to any one for some time past. Nothing the matter; only general gloom &#x26;c &#x26;c. You do not say whether you received a brief Note with which I hoped to hit you at Linlathen: it was too late for that (as I found), but <pb id="pg-26-13" n="26:13"/>w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> probably be sent on to you at Auchtertool.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Home of John Welsh&#x2019;s son, the Rev. Walter Welsh.</note> I have sent nothing else except Newspapers; which seem all to have arrived. I have written to Scotsbrig too, and had answers; the news going there, how our poor Mother has had <hi rend="italic">toothache</hi>, and been weaklier than usual, all this you already know. Poor old Mother, it is very hard to have toothache, and no <hi rend="italic">teeth</hi> left! I hope you will find her better when you get home (the day when you read this):<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Carlyle wrote, <date when="1851-01-10">10 Jan.</date>, from Edinburgh, that he would leave for Scotsbrig, <date when="1851-01-14">14 Jan.</date></note> for being besides her again will bring a composure into our imagination on that side.</p>
<p>We are not in bad health here,&#x2014;not bad for us; but the weather is unnaturally close and damp and warm; I understand the bills of mortality already proclaim the season an unwholesome one. Great <hi rend="italic">weakness</hi> is what I complain of; frightful weakness of body (in the regions always weak with me), which brings along with a frightful d<hi rend="italic">o</hi> of mind, still more to be lamented and despised! I have yet got no work vanquished into any figure of doability for myself; and guess there will some water run by before that arrive. Arrive it must, however, one w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> think?&#x2014; Jane, tho&#x2019; weak too, seems better than her average proportion; the warm temperature, in spite of other drawbacks, being friendly to her.</p>
<p>We have next to no news, indeed as good as none. Neuberg wrote,&#x2014;did I tell you? He is at Bonn, attending <hi rend="italic">classes;</hi> is about going to Berlin, with some <hi rend="italic">Ms</hi> of &#x201C;translations&#x201C; from the English, chiefly from <hi rend="italic">me;</hi> wants Varnhagen to help him:&#x2014;I have written to Varnhagen;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Neuberg went to Berlin in <date when="1851-06">June</date> and consulted Varnhagen von Ense about his collection of extracts from TC concerning work, which he trans. to German as <hi rend="italic">Beitr&#xE4;ge zum Evangelium der Arbeit aus den Schriften Thomas Carlyles mitgetheilt under eingeleiheit von J.

<salute><hi rend="small-caps">Dear Sir</hi>,</salute>
<p>I have just run over your MS., diligently glancing into it <hi rend="italic">to the extent of two hours;</hi>&#x2014;and find in it a good deal of accurate and diligent, if not very recondite reading, upon the History of Oliver and of England in that period; the results of which are set forth with an intelligence which I cannot call high or new, but which may be called lucid, innocuous, and capable of informing the <pb id="pg-26-15" n="26:15"/>simpler sort of readers (provided they do not break down into yawning over it) upon various points about the History of England in those days. The conclusions your author arrives at are those in which I for one may very well <hi rend="italic">agree;</hi> and certainly, in my opinion, the more persons are convinced upon them and informed about them, the better.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The MS may have been a version of <hi rend="italic">Oliver Cromwell or England in the Past Viewed in Relation to England in the Present</hi> (2d edn., Dublin,
<date when="1851">1851</date>; pref. dated <date when="1851-03">March 1851</date>) by the Rev. Joseph Denham Smith (<date when="1816">1816</date>?&#x2013;<date when="1889">89</date>), minister of the Congregational church, Kingston, nr. Dublin. TC is mentioned in the pref.</note></p>
<p>But I must say farther, the true title of it would be &#x2018;The Seventeenth Century: a Biography,&#x2019; or &#x2018;English Puritanism, a do.&#x2019;;&#x2014;for the great bulk of the work turns not on Oliver at all, but on matters common to him and all his contemporaries whatsoever, the <hi rend="italic">nature</hi> of English Puritanism, Puritan Conservatism; History of James and his Theologies and Politics, do. of Charles and his do. do.,&#x2014;Trial of Strafford, Irish Rebellion,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James VI of Scotland and I of England (<date when="1566">1566</date>&#x2013;<date when="1625">1625</date>). Charles I (<date when="1600">1600</date>&#x2013;<date when="1649">1649</date>). Thomas Wentworth (<date when="1593">1593</date>&#x2013;<date when="1641">1641</date>), 1st earl of Strafford. The Irish Rebellion, <date when="1641">1641</date>, by Roman Catholics was against Protestant rule.</note> &#x26;c. &#x26;c.,&#x2014;Oliver gliding out and in like the moon in a wet night, and often for long sections not seeming to appear at all. Excluding the Appendix, Oliver (I think), in any legitimate sense of Biography, may occupy about <hi rend="italic">a fourth</hi> of the Book; including the Appendix perhaps about a fifth: the rest is History and Discussion of the kinds alluded to above,&#x2014;very harmless, meritoriously exact too (so far as I see), and containing many particulars by no means known to everybody; but not set forth with any great felicity, nor, I should think, quite appropriate in a Book styling itself &#x2018;Biography.&#x2019; In Oliver&#x2019;s particular History I did not notice any particular of a new kind,&#x2014;nor any view or opinion that was not already my own (<hi rend="italic">minus</hi> the water here added to it), or everybody&#x2019;s in a sense.</p>
<p>If the author were to rewrite his MS, compress it greatly (steaming out at least one-third, which may be accounted <hi rend="italic">aqueous</hi>), and call it &#x2018;English Puritanism,&#x2019; or some such name, it might really be a book capable of instructing various people, and be read, not uncreditably to him, along with the <hi rend="italic">Isaac-Taylor</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Liberal-Dissenter</hi> kind of speculations,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably Isaac Taylor (<date when="1787">1787</date>&#x2013;<date when="1865">1865</date>; <ref target="volume-26/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/27034"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), engraver and author, from a Dissenting family, though an Anglican; his father, Isaac Taylor (<date when="1759">1759</date>&#x2013;<date when="1829">1829</date>), engraver and writer, was a Nonconformist pastor of Ongar, where he pbd. children&#x2019;s instructional books; his theological works included <hi rend="italic">The Natural History of Enthusiasm</hi> (<date when="1829">1829</date>) and <hi rend="italic">Ancient Christianity and the Doctrines of the Oxford Tracts</hi> (<date when="1839">1839</date>&#x2013;<date when="1840">40</date>).</note> which I believe are much sought after among certain large classes of our reading public at present. But I would strongly recommend rewriting and compression! Changing of the name, too, for several reasons; though that is not so important.</p>
<p>What pity this diligent young writer were not attached as subaltern to some <pb id="pg-26-16" n="26:16"/>man of real intellect and insight who could turn his powers to their true use, instead of leaving them unguided to seek their own use in this wide sphere! Such, however, is the course at this epoch.&#x2014;What kind of &#x2018;History&#x2019; he may yet write, we will not predict; but the present, I venture to say, is by no means the best he could already do.</p>
<p>The MS. lies here, sealed, for your man.</p>

<p>Thanks for your flying-leaf: one would say, this arrow you have shot, in the present temper of the world, must hit!

<salute>Dear Neuberg,</salute>
<p>Here is Varnhagen&#x2019;s Reply, about a week old now; I may as well send it off to you, that you may read at first hand what concerns your own affairs in the Berlin quarter.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Meanwhile, Neuberg wrote to Varnhagen from Bonn, <date when="1851-01-19">19 Jan.</date>, to thank him for his &#x201C;kind offer&#x201C; and to say that he simply wanted a &#x201C;good publisher&#x201C; rather than payment for his translation of extracts from TC: &#x201C;In England the fate of a book, at least in the early days of its publication, very often depends on the reputation and status of its publisher.&#x201C; He added that he was tempted &#x201C;to come to Berlin in the spring,&#x201C; if he was right in thinking that Varnhagen would be kind enough to &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">listen</hi> to my manuscript, thus granting me the great benefit of your correction.&#x201C; He liked Bonn for its quiet, though he had once heard &#x201C;our friend Carlyle&#x201C; say of London that &#x201C;so many winds are always blowing simultaneously that they neutralize each other, creating a state resembling perfect calm!&#x201C; (MS: Jagiellonian Univ.; trans.).</note> As the text of the Note is at once private and unimportant, I <pb id="pg-26-18" n="26:18"/>think you had better, having once fairly treasured up what is practical in it, burn the whole. I long to hear what becomes of you at Berlin; how this or other projects prosper with you there or elsewhere.&#x2013; &#x2014; I myself am utterly silent; <hi rend="italic">idle</hi> w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be as good an epithet; for indeed I am still low in point of health, not joyful over the aspect of outward things, and destitute of force (at present) to cut my way towards any sure object among them. A lonely, dangerous, and not very pleasant &#x201C;way&#x201C;! One has even to sit still, in such circumstances; and try if one can gather a little strength again for a new plunge thro&#x2019; these trackless regions,&#x2014;the like of which have seldom been travelled by an honest citizen, I think! The aspect of this social chaos (which invades one&#x2019;s health and very heart) rushing down, as in avalanches, towards the belly of the Abyss, amid the cheers of all creatures for their &#x201C;chrystan palace&#x201C; and &#x201C;progress of the species,&#x201C;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Joking combination of &#x201C;Christian&#x201C; and &#x201C;crystal&#x201C;; and &#x201C;progress of the species.&#x201C;</note> is very far from cheering to a thoughtful man!

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Before going farther I will write you a little Note today. I fancied John had been with you again since Tuesday; but last night there came a hasty Note from him which indicated that he was to be in Edinburgh till <hi rend="italic">Friday;</hi>&#x2014;and so we can hope he is actually upon the road towards you at this time; and there will be a glad meeting for you (I trust) to tea this evening, after a while of absence! May it do you all good; both the travel and the return, the absence <pb id="pg-26-19" n="26:19"/>and the reunion!&#x2014; You have not been very well yourself, I perceive, dear Mother; troubled with &#x201C;toothache&#x201C; (they say) and other ailments and discomforts in the dark weather; and alas you can stand so little; a little thing much oversets you now. Toothache, which is known for a sore and great misery,&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">toothache</hi>, I have often reflected, is a very hard affliction upon poor Mother whose teeth are so nearly gone! But you bear it all, I doubt not, with as much equanimity as is possible for you; and now I flatter myself to hear more expressly before long that it is mainly gone, and that you are got back into your usual course. One gets <hi rend="italic">used</hi> to any kind of course; and it becomes much more tolerable by habit, however poor it be. Besides the Year is now <hi rend="italic">turning</hi> out of the hollow depths; and I see in the skies prophecy of new sunshine, and better weather for poor weak people.&#x2014; I hope you keep yourself very warm; Jenny would attend carefully to that; and you have <hi rend="italic">coals</hi> within reach, and a chimney that does not smoke. Many thanks to Isabella for giving you that bit of scarf since you liked it: tell her I am much obliged, and will not forget it of her.</p>
<p>We are both of us going about here, neither of us specially complaining; Jane, I think, is decidedly stronger than is usual for her in winter,&#x2014;owing partly perhaps to the <hi rend="italic">warmth</hi> of the weather. No living person remembers such a winter for total absence of frost or cold: soft rain, mud, and a dim blanket of fog, have been the characters of winter here; nor does there seem any appearance of change yet, our late three days of dry brisk weather having gone into windy rain again last night.

<salute>My dear Sister,</salute>
<p>Thanks for your Letter, which like the rest you send me was very welcome; yours really are among the most <hi rend="italic">intelligent</hi> Letters (not to speak of their other qualities to me) which I get in these times, and are always right <hi rend="italic">welcome</hi>, whatever follow out of them. But you must be content with a very small response,&#x2014;till the <hi rend="italic">liver</hi> and the inner-man generally be pleased to mend in some degree! For in that state of matters, <hi rend="italic">silence</hi> is a great duty, I assure you; duty pointed out by Nature herself; and perhaps a great kindness to you withal. I write regularly to nobody in these months, except some meagre bulletins to my Mother. You must be patient till the <hi rend="italic">laired beast</hi> get to its legs again! I really do think sometimes, I am slowly recovering strength to a small extent, and composure for vanquishing these rude life-elements of mine; but the poor animal has really got its back sorely galled, and in the heavy quagmires (from without and from within) has its own adoes to sprawl forward, and keep from sinking&#x2014;Heigh ho!&#x2014;and (especially today, when the clocks are striking <hi rend="italic">three</hi>[)],<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Parenthesis omitted.</note> must restrict itself accurately <hi rend="italic">to the needful.</hi></p>
<p><pb id="pg-26-23" n="26:23"/>Of Cullivait, then, what can I say but that the House seems altogether good and excellent at the money; eligible in every respect (except perhaps its distance from Town and shops): but that, for the rest, I dare not resolve to have anything to do with it at present. Jane will of course, go where I like to command; but I do not find her volunteer to help on this occasion; and, as was said already, I could hardly fly with my own weight, certainly not with that of another superadded. Pray answer Mrs Charteris<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably the owner of the house.</note> accordingly; and pardon, yourself, all this trouble I have given you.</p>
<p>My wish, nay necessity, for a place of refuge in the Summer, is as strong as ever. But on your side of the world, I rather looked to some house, in which my Mother while she is spared to us, with Jenny and perhaps the Doctor might take part, than to dragging Jane and a servant from London with me, or trying to set up an economy on my own footing for a three months of the year in that quarter. In fact, I wanted the thing with a minimum of trouble, or nearly without trouble, as we all do in such cases;&#x2014;and cannot get it on those terms, as is also natural! I did not speak to John about it, nor to Jenny, nor indeed to any one (except perhaps some hint to Jamie of Scotsbrig once): but it has often struck me my Mother is but ill-lodged where she is; that she ought to have some far roomier, cheerier place, with Jenny to look after her,&#x2014;and yet to <hi rend="italic">retain</hi> her own establish<hi rend="italic">t</hi> at Scotsbrig, to avoid the fret of an express <hi rend="italic">flitting</hi> at her time of life, and the sense of <hi rend="italic">confinement</hi>, were she living in partnership;&#x2014;that John also surely needs some kind of home for himself, &#x26;c &#x26;c: all these things, combined with my own want of a country lodging-place, I have often had in my head&#x2014;and some place like Drangan&#x2019;s Lodge<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For Drungan&#x2019;s Lodge, see <ref target="volume-25/lt-18501206-TC-JCA-01"><sic>25:305</sic><corr>TC to JCA, <date when="1850-12-06">6 Dec. 1850</date></corr></ref>. TC varied the spelling.</note> seems to be the kind of thing? In all which I would very willingly bear my part, by money or otherwise, if the other parties so inclined,&#x2014; especially if John and Jenny inclined, who would have all the trouble to take. But who knows about that; who, in the peculiar conditions of the case, could profitably or judiciously inquire about that! These are people ticklish to question or converse with on such a subject;&#x2014;to whom if you proposed such a thing, the very proposal would be a reason for distasting it!&#x2014; &#x2014; In short, I suppose, practically, we must just let it lie: and as for myself, I shall have to look out for some kind of resting quarters in some other direction. Germany, some people recommend; the German Baths in the Rhine country: cheap solitary and pleasant. Occasionally I think of a few months of <hi rend="italic">Water-Cure;</hi> away to the West (120 miles off, near Worcester), where there is a good Doctor, whom I have seen, whom I really believe capable to do me some good.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For TC&#x2019;s meeting with Dr. James Gully, who had a hydropathic establishment at Malvern, ca. 7 mi. SW of Worcester, see <ref target="volume-25/lt-18501221-TC-JAC-01"><sic>25:313</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1850-12-21">21 Dec. 1850</date></corr></ref>.</note> Were the <pb id="pg-26-24" n="26:24"/>&#x201C;Chrystal Palace&#x201C; once filled, and all the babbling Noodles of the world once gathered here, I fancy I shall actually have to fly for it. The thought of such a scene already makes me shudder!&#x2014; &#x2014; On the whole, do not bother yourself with all this, dear Jean: it will all unfold itself by its own laws gradually; and perhaps no great improvement is likely by the <hi rend="italic">best</hi> meddling with it that is possible just now. And so enough of it.</p>
<p>Jack has got home; I suppose, brightened up by his month of touring: he reports favourably of our Mother&#x2019;s health, and of the other phenomena at Scotsbrig.&#x2014; &#x2014; I am truly sorry for poor Aird: let his Niece have <hi rend="italic">boundless</hi> patience with him;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Aird&#x2019;s niece was probably Mrs. Smith of Whitehaven, who years later was to look after him while he was dying.</note> her kind young heart does not <hi rend="italic">guess</hi> at the amount of wretchedness he probably suffers! And let me commend him to your kindness if you have opportunity. And offer him my friendliest sympathies and best regards. Poor fellow! It is the arrival of <hi rend="italic">old age;</hi> no friendly visitor in general; but one whom you <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> turn from the door. I hope confidently, as the Spring advances we shall hear better accounts of the good Aird.</p>
<p>Jane has been out walking in the bright sunny day; I hear her come in; and shutting the windows, down stairs. She lost her little dog Nero yesterday,&#x2014;little vermin ran obstinately away from her, chacing sparrows, in the green enclosure of a Square, not far from this; she thought he w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> follow home; but some thief, with a bit of meat or other bait, has doubtless picked him up. Which makes the poor Dame considerably sad today. Quietly, for my own part, I think it will be almost as well, if this little wretch (very dirty, and bothersome about the house, tho&#x2019; a cheerful little object too) should never come back! But we must not say so;&#x2014;and indeed I am sorry for my poor Dame, who had got used to have the little object Dancing about her at all times Probably it will come back after all. There is a large Fraternity of Dogstealers here, who live by stealing Dogs, chiefly women&#x2019;s, and selling them back at a ransom. I have heard some big sum, &#xa3;10,000 I think, mentioned as their annual income from this fine act.</p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Many thanks for your <hi rend="italic">First Volume of Burns</hi>,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">The Life and Works of Robert Burns</hi>, ed. Robert Chambers, 4 vols. (Edinburgh, <date when="1851">1851</date>&#x2013;<date when="1852">52</date>). Chambers wrote of TC: &#x201C;[N]o man has written about Burns with a fairer apprehension of his merits, or a truer expression of sympathy for his misfortunes&#x201C; (1:138). In <date when="1852">1852</date> he was to disagree with TC&#x2019;s belief that no one was better fitted than Burns &#x201C;to be at the head of public affairs of his day&#x201C; (4:218).</note> which I received some ten days ago, and have examined with much interest. You surely do well to collect in an authentic form, while it is yet time, whatever particulars can be gathered concerning a man who is likely to be memorable so long. Correctness, so far as I can judge, appears to have been a leading care with you, which indeed is the basis of all worth in such an enterprise; there is everywhere, too, a due genial recognition of your subject and your hero: in short, the whole is altogether good and pleasant reading; and contains, for me at least, a great many biographic traits and elucidations which were not known before. I shall heartily wish you good speed in this pious adventure; and hope to see it triumphantly finished by and by.</p>
<p>It is a bold and genial notion, that of intercalating Burns&#x2019;s Poems into the Prose Narrative of his Life, and treating them as little bursts of musical utterance in the grand unrhymed practical Tragedy which he enacted under this Sun! Beyond doubt such is their real character; and into that category they must ultimately come with all readers: but to handle them so, in the present stage of the business, and for readers in this epoch, is attended with peculiar difficulties. I remember Allan Cunningham<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >(<date when="1784">1784</date>&#x2013;<date when="1842">1842</date>), writer, sculptor, and TC&#x2019;s friend who ed. <hi rend="italic">The Works of Burns, with His Life</hi>, 8 vols. (<date when="1834">1834</date>).</note> used to say, what indeed he has once expressly written, that he thought of such a plan, but durst not altogether venture on it. We are well pleased to see you grapple with these abstruse natural obstacles; and doubt not you will give a good account of them yet.</p>
<p>One question, in regard to this branch of the affair, has struck me in going over the First Volume: Whether you might not perhaps considerably illuminate your Delineation, and overcome the refractory effect of so many minute details, by dividing the History more firmly into masses, into epochs,&#x2014;into distinct books and chapters? This yields a wonderful refreshment and stimulus to the reader&#x2019;s mind, as I have often noticed; and greatly facilitates the impression you mean to leave with him. For indeed it means that the reader <pb id="pg-26-26" n="26:26"/>now (what the author had already done) <hi rend="italic">conceives</hi> the matter, sees it as a distinct <hi rend="italic">organisation</hi>, not a vague confusion.&#x2014; There is something of this division into parts, in Volume First; and in the following Volumes if more were found possible, I think more would be welcome. What are the real <hi rend="italic">epochs</hi> of Burns&#x2019;s Life; how did one phasis of it grow naturally out of the other,&#x2014;act after act, scene after scene, till the catastrophe arrived? The more you can instruct us about that, and leave that vivid upon our memories, the more shall we feel grateful to you, and enjoy and appropriate all your other merits as a Biographer.&#x2014; An excellent <hi rend="italic">exact and copious Index</hi> I look for at any rate, when the work is finished: this of itself will do much to disentangle complicacies in the memory, and elucidate whatsoever is dark for a diligent reader.&#x2014;</p>
<p>Forgive me this long story, which is much more than I designed;&#x2014;and let me mention one practical small matter, in case it should not be already known to you. In regard to Burns&#x2019;s first journey to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> (which will begin your 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi> vol) did you ever see a Paper drawn up, some years ago, by Archibald Prentice, lately of the <hi rend="italic">Manchester Times?</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Chambers took TC&#x2019;s advice and cited (2:13) a &#x201C;Letter of Mr Prentice to Professor Wilson, dated <date when="1841-03-08">March 8 1841</date>,&#x201C; from the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Intelligencer</hi>, thanking John Wilson for vindicating Burns&#x2019;s character but also saying that Wilson wrongly thought that Burns made the journey on foot, since he had a pony and stayed overnight with Prentice&#x2019;s father, a farmer of Covington&#x2019;s Mains.</note> I suppose you have; but if you have not, pray write to him (&#x201C;Salford, Manchester&#x201C;), and he will joyfully send it you.&#x2014; <closer><salute>And so with many thanks, and wishes of good speed,&#x2014; Yours sincerely,</salute></closer> <name>T.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I had your Letter from Scotsbrig,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1851-01-19">19 Jan.</date>, which was full of news. He reported that their mother was well and reading &#x201C;with her usual zeal&#x201C;; that he had lately encountered Thomas Erskine, John Hunter, and Dr. Samuel Brown, the latter looking &#x201C;thin &#x26; worn, but &#x2026; full of speculation as ever&#x201C;; and that Hunter had been sorting Jeffrey&#x2019;s papers before passing them to Jeffrey&#x2019;s biographer, Lord Cockburn.</note> and last night there came another to Jane, which also had a small inclosure for me: thanks for your good news. We are very glad our good Mother is in so tolerable a state after your return;&#x2014;glad that you have got safe back again, and find all so tolerably off in these dark days. Jamie is busy draining, I see; which surely is a good work, and I think one that will pay him by and by. You are getting to your employment <pb id="pg-26-27" n="26:27"/>too, it would appear; I hope you will persist till the preliminary impediments are overcome: after that there will be no danger; once the wheels get <hi rend="italic">warm</hi>, all manner of <hi rend="italic">rust</hi> and obstruction will go for less and less. Certainly it is a clear case you should finish this <hi rend="italic">Dante;</hi> I have hardly known an enterprise more decidedly <hi rend="italic">prescribed</hi> for a man in the course of my experience. Persist and prosper!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Poor John Carlyle, he is at rest at length! Many a time has he been in my mind during these weeks; and the thought of him has rebuked me when I have been secretly fretting about my own affairs, and thinking them so perverse and obstructive. Poor soul, his weary plodding struggle thro&#x2019; the quagmires and base jungles of this Earthly life is over now; and he has got it all done! In the state he was in, one could <hi rend="italic">wish</hi> for nothing else.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John said that their cousin John had been able to &#x201C;take little else but stimulants.&#x201C;</note>&#x2014; I here inclose a draught for Two Sovereigns: one of please give to Jamie; the other is what I had before contributed along with you:&#x2014;and so that sad matter ends.</p>
<p>You need not send those Prison Reports, tho&#x2019; I am glad to hear of new progress in that direction, on that particular matter: indeed I perceive the <hi rend="italic">Model-Prison</hi> concern is falling into such a state in many men&#x2019;s minds, there will before very long be an end of <hi rend="italic">it.</hi> One particular infatuation will be abated;&#x2014;I see also there is everywhere a stirring towards setting Paupers (and much more, Criminals and Felons) into <hi rend="italic">employment</hi> and under <hi rend="italic">real</hi> drill and &#x201C;instruction&#x201C;: good will come of all that, by slow degrees, and after many days, as usual. We have lately had a certain Prison-Inspector <hi rend="italic">Perry</hi> (once a Doctor, Darwin&#x2019;s Friend) calling on us; he took us to the Pentonville &#x201C;Model&#x201C; one day (a truly villanous<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> incarnation and petrifaction of Benevolent <hi rend="italic">Tartuffery</hi><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hypocrisy as in Moli&#xE8;re&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Tartuffe</hi> (<date when="1664">1664</date>).</note>); he also, I find, is warmly of my opinion about &#x201C;Devil&#x2019;s regiments of the line.&#x201C;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Model Prisons,&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">Latter-Day Pamphlets, Works</hi> 20:58.</note></p>
<p>Here has Tom Wilson come calling; and I must go out with him;&#x2014;small joy on it! A day of dirty frosty fog. No work <hi rend="italic">begun</hi> yet: ah me! But we are trying; we will surely try.&#x2014;Jane has lost her dog Nero; ran away three days ago,&#x2014;a great sorrow to <hi rend="italic">her.</hi> On the other hand, A<hi rend="italic">y</hi> Sterling, poor soul, has just come back; incidentally reintroduced, a much-repentant man, by Darwin;&#x2014;he sat two hours, last night, and a little obstructed my reading. I am sorry for him, too, the poor idle obstructed, foolish, yet not ill-meaning man.&#x2014;&#x2014; Here is a Volume of a new <hi rend="italic">Burns</hi>, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I send today: perhaps you may find it worth running over. Jamie too, who is a lover of <hi rend="italic">Burns.</hi> Give it to anybody to read (who has clean fingers), but preserve it.&#x2014; <closer><salute>My love to every one; blessings to my dear Mother. Ever yours</salute></closer>

<salute>Dear Spedding,</salute>
<p>I learned, last week, from somebody who reads the Newspapers, what had befallen at Mirehouse.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The death of Spedding&#x2019;s father, John, of Mirehouse, Cumberland, <date when="1851-01-19">19 Jan.</date></note> Henry Taylor too has lost his Father,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Taylor (<date when="1772">1772</date>&#x2013;<date when="1851">1851</date>), d. <date when="1851-01-02">2 Jan.</date></note> in these days; Arthur Helps his Mother:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ann Frisquett, b. Plunkett (<date when="1777">1777</date>&#x2013;<date when="1851">1851</date>), d. <date when="1851-01-15">15 Jan.</date> at Balham Hill.</note> ever as of old, &#x201C;man goeth to his long home, and <pb id="pg-26-30" n="26:30"/>the mourners go about the streets.&#x201C;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Eccles. 12:5.</note> I too have a Mother, now near four-score; whose death has been a terror to me ever since my childhood. God is great; God is also good! We can say no more. We will not weep too much for the Dead; it is the Living rather that deserve it of us; they that are still in the choking press of this sad sordid warfare; not they that have got it honourably over. <hi rend="italic">They</hi> do rest from their labours, and their works follow them,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Rev. 14:13.</note>&#x2014;thro&#x2019; Eternity.</p>
<p>A long experience has taught me to believe that the world&#x2019;s bravest men are often they whom the world never hears of. People call this a paradox of me; but it is deliberately my conviction, grounded on actual survey of the facts as they have shewn themselves to me. Certainly by far the best-made men whom I have known in this world were men who, along with their other heroic gifts, had the crowning gift of <hi rend="italic">continence</hi> (which grows daily rarer in this poor Earth); and had not needed to get upon the platform, or explode themselves in Stump-oratory,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. &#x201C;The Stump-Orator,&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">Latter-Day Pamphlets.</hi></note> or windy Stump-<hi rend="italic">activity</hi>, which is always of a difficult ambiguous sort, little to the taste of a strong man not compelled to it. Richer are they, and more blessed, who have walked silent under these deep skies and eternities. Ah me, when I read the lamentations of some &#x201C;unrecognised&#x201C; poetical, political or other big-blown imbecile, and think of my own brave Father and of others whom I have known, I too am without words!</p>
<p>When is James<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Spedding.</note> coming up? We shall be right glad to see him again. I have been very sorrowful and silent all winter; very much worn out of health, in fact; and admonished, by all manner of instincts and indications, to hold my peace, and wait whether a little strength would not return to me. My solitude accordingly has been well maintained; in that I have not erred. May Heaven prosper it.&#x2014; Paxton&#x2019;s Palace seems now nearly all glazed; really an excellent clever edifice; a pleasant triumph of human wit over obstacles and conditions: to me the only feature in the least pleasant of this big syllabub of balderdash and ostentatious inanity which Squire Cole,<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henry Cole was the most active member of the executive committee of the Great Exhibition; Prince Albert was pres. of the commissioners.</note> Prince Albert and other Dignitaries of the world have been so busy cooking for us. I rather think, were the mess ready, and all the talking noodles of the world fairly <hi rend="italic">got</hi> into these precincts, you will not find me here on your coming up to see: I seriously meditate flying beyond seas till the vile banquet of the children of the wind, with all its tumults and eloquent eructations, be fairly over. One dead dog is bad; but fifty of them stranded at Blackfriars Bridge on a hot day, what can <pb id="pg-26-31" n="26:31"/>you do with these? The nostril and the soul alike turn away with abhorrence from <hi rend="italic">such</hi> an Ecumenic Council; and pray the Heavens it may soon be blown asunder again.</p>
<p>Neither does the Cardinal much concern me: I felt much insulted at first,&#x2014;for even a turkey cock, scraping his wings and goggle-goggling too much, has been known to provoke me in some humours, and I have taken him by the neck, and flung him over the wall, on occasion:&#x2014;but as to Wiseman, I now find he is a real gain to me; and that infallibly, in the collision of windbags, collapse will the sooner ensue. Besides the poor Pope is logically <hi rend="italic">right.</hi> Of English <hi rend="italic">Protestants</hi> (if we go to the real meaning of that word) I hardly know three in the world: all <hi rend="italic">are</hi> cloth-worshippers (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, Papists), and sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> declare themselves so. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign> dear Spedding, Yours ever /</salute></closer> <name>T.

<salute>My dear little Jeannie (for such you are, and shall again and ever be, if it please Heaven).&#x2014;</salute>
<p>I must write you a little line, under every conceivable opposing circumstance, time, pen, hand &#x26;c) merely to assure you that nothing is wrong, and keep your poor little imagination at rest.&#x2014; I meant to write in the forenoon, and came up for that end; but it was then too cold, and I had no means of <hi rend="italic">fire;</hi> so I went into the sun rather with a Book and pipe: and <hi rend="italic">now</hi> it is <hi rend="italic">half past five</hi>, and I am just come in <hi rend="italic">wettish</hi> from a long ride: so take the will for the deed, and &#x201C;excuse us this time.&#x201C;</p>

<p>I have read Mr Howe&#x2019;s speech at Southampton;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Joseph Howe (<date when="1804">1804</date>&#x2013;<date when="1873">73</date>; <ref target="volume-26/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/13959"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), Nova Scotian statesman, delegate from Nova Scotia to England, <date when="1850-11">Nov. 1850</date>&#x2013;<date when="1851-04">April.</date> He and Carmichael Smyth were close friends. The speech, delivered at Southampton, <date when="1851-01-14">14 Jan.</date>, urged closer relations between England and British North America, especially the promotion of emigration. Printed in Hampshire newspapers and widely distributed as a pamphlet, it is included in <hi rend="italic">The Speeches and Public Letters of the Hon. Joseph Howe</hi>, compiled by W.

Chisholm (Halifax, N.S., <date when="1909">1909</date>) 2:141&#x2013;56.</note> and rejoice much to find him advocating with such eloquence, and above all with such prospects of some success, a class of practical measures that have lain heavy on my own heart (and I doubt not, on that of many others) for a quarter of a century past. In the name of Common Sense, and of all higher Entities, may good speed attend him!</p>
<p>If Mr Howe chance to be passing this way any day between 2 and 3 o&#x2019;clock, and would mount into my workshop, I am accessible at that hour, and should be very glad to see him.</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p><salute>Thanks for your Note</salute>,&#x2014;for your good news of my dear old Mother, and the rest: it is a great gratification to me to hear that she and the others are <pb id="pg-26-35" n="26:35"/>struggling on so well. Alas, I often think of her, and regret that I cannot help her at all! There is no object in my thoughts wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> so affects me with pious and sad yet good emotions in this world. The cry of my heart still is, We are all in God&#x2019;s hand; whatsoever He wills, that is the thing which must be good!&#x2014; In my solitary walks, thro&#x2019; all my solitary life (which is solitary enough, tho&#x2019; rubbed upon by so many) these things constantly attend me.</p>
<p>I am getting rather busy again, often in straits to get my task up to time,&#x2014;I will tell you what it is, if it come to anything, by and by (no <hi rend="italic">great</hi> thing, nor perhaps to be published at all at present);<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC wrote in his Journal, <date when="1851-03-05">5 March</date>: &#x201C;Throwing down on paper (not for immediate publicat<hi rend="italic">n</hi>) some record of <hi rend="italic">Sterling&#x2019;s Life;</hi> goes on badly; threatens to be worth nothing.&#x2014; Was at the Grange near a week at the end of <date when="1851-01">Jan<hi rend="italic">y</hi></date>: &#x2026; began <hi rend="italic">St</hi>g on coming home: would I were done with it.&#x201C;</note>&#x2014;but I have to stand rather toughly up to it, being so lamed and hampered, and very ill with the liver too, in these times: today I have, by luck, gained half an hour or more; and in that I am writing to you.&#x2014; Our weather seems far better than yours; frost late, dry for most part, and in general (as today) quite vernal, and cheering, the birds all twittering about in the Parks, and thinking of their bits of nests and weddings, poor objects! Last Sunday I made a long solitary course with Nero by the Wandsworth and Tooting regions;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >S of the Thames.</note> walked lustily in old lanes where I had not been for eight years; and conversed with the shadows of my past life, which looked, after a sort, divine too, tho&#x2019; sad and stern to me as the lava of extinct fires.&#x2014; &#x2014; Jane is very tolerably well; B&#xF6;lte has taken lodging in the Upper Cheyne Row, and is often with her.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Amalie B&#xF6;lte, who had recently moved to Upper Cheyne Row, wrote to Varnhagen, <date when="1851-02-12">12 Feb.</date>, that she and JWC often went into town in the morning and returned home at five for dinner (<hi rend="italic">B&#xF6;ltes Briefe</hi> 87).</note> Tom Wilson (about to burst forth into heterodox <hi rend="italic">preaching</hi>, I believe, otherwise a finish kind of fellow) comes often here,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >He had, for example, visited the Carlyles on Christmas Day <date when="1850-12-25">1850</date>; soon after, <date when="1850-12-30">30 Dec.</date>, TC wrote in his Journal of &#x201C;once &#x2018;little Tom,&#x2019; now whiskery and big-voiced, a rebel ag<hi rend="italic">t</hi> the Church &#x26; c.&#x201C;</note> or rather <hi rend="italic">has</hi> come, for I mean to <hi rend="italic">abate</hi> him rather. Along with him was a certain heretic <foreign><hi rend="italic">cidevant</hi></foreign>, one Foxton, Ex-parson, rather wearisome, last night; but he is gone for a time again. Many persons come and go, now that the Town is getting full again; one Howe a sec<hi rend="italic">y</hi> from Nova Scotia, wanting railways and &#x201C;ocean-omnibuses&#x201C;; one and still another:&#x2014;alas, I can do little, but gently brush them all away again, and continue <hi rend="italic">alone</hi> all the while. The &#x201C;Crystal Palace&#x201C; has always a simmering crowd round it, and the Park is already quite infested by the idlers it attracts: what shall we be in two months hence! For the rest, it is really a grand article, and most perfect of its kind, this same glass House; covers 20 acres; just about ready now; rises, narrowing, in three huge-stages, a round high ridge (perhaps 150 feet high) <pb id="pg-26-36" n="26:36"/>intersecting it across the middle of the topmost stage:&#x2014;very grand indeed; and, from the Kensington Gore road, has somewhat the effect of Solomon&#x2019;s Temple as the old sixpenny pictures gave it us.&#x2014; Sorrow on it, nevertheless! I believe I shall have to fly from the thing altogether, perhaps beyond seas; for I can not stand such a babble.</p>

<p>The Missus goes out generally in the best of the sunshine; that is, about 2 o&#x2019;clock, or perhaps you are not sure of her after 1.

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>A thousand pardons! I forgot your name; and did not know, till now that you are gone full five minutes, that you <hi rend="italic">had</hi> real &#x201C;business&#x201C; with me,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Woolner, admiring TC and eager to do a medallion of him, asked Coventry Patmore, of the British Museum Lib., to approach TC on his behalf.

He seemed a little doubtful as to whether it would take too much of his time, but I told him I thought you could do it in about four sittings of a couple of hours&#x201C; (Amy Woolner, <hi rend="italic">Thomas Woolner, R.A.</hi> [<date when="1917">1917</date>] 11&#x2013;12). Woolner had made a medallion of Tennyson when they were all at Coniston in <date when="1850">1850</date>, and JWC was to ask for a cast of it.</note>&#x2014;a definite appointment even.

<salute>Dear Jean,</salute>
<p>I was very glad to see your Letter, and much obliged for the trouble you take. Jack writes pretty frequently, and others write; but there is, on the whole, none of whom I get so substantial an account of matters as I do from you, when you steal an hour for me from the bustle.&#x2014; Surely, you might say, I, who have no little noisy <foreign>bairns</foreign> to rise at midnight and break in upon my writing, might readily contrive to answer you directly! As indeed I strive to do:&#x2014;but here too there are endless perplexities that beset the Son of Adam; and, in result, this is the first instant I have had for writing any line for the post: and a whole crowd of dirty little impertinent bits of Notes (about <pb id="pg-26-38" n="26:38"/>nothing at all mostly) from various points of the world, are lying to be answered today. Heigh ho! A weary world it is, and full of nonsense!&#x2014; Besides I have been, and am, rather busy, sorting up old rubbish here, and adding new,&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">not</hi> with any immediate view to printing, but with objects that are necessary too.</p>
<p>I notice Drungan&#x2019;s Lodge as you predict; and feel a transitory satisfaction in thinking of that other possibility, whether it ever become a reality or not. Truly if Jack could be tacitly persuaded, and Jenny and my Mother liked, I could be well pleased to know that I possessed a habitable apartment there; and should be willing to pay half the rent for having such a shelter always open in the background. But I fancy our Dr will not bite at such a bait; nay if you too rashly tried to incite him, that would be the sure means of a flat negative: I conjecture he has other notions in his head; and contemplates, above all things, the satisfaction of <hi rend="italic">not</hi> being tied at all to any residence or condition! However, you may try what can, in a good way, be done. Jenny herself resident there, would not that save her rent in the Town,&#x2014;how would <hi rend="italic">she</hi> like it, and my Mother and self to come when we liked?&#x2014; After all, I fancy nothing can be practically made of it,&#x2014;or hardly anything that will well hang together? I seem, for my own part, to grow a little better, here where I am, as the season strikes up: for the future time, if it prove intolerable here, there can some new device be fallen upon.</p>
<p>Our weather is very grim; frosty, grey-coloured for most part, but not unpleasant when you get into heat, walking on the dry furzy commons (South over the river, into the Surrey <hi rend="italic">country</hi>-world), and have the pure sky, with its gruff clouds and bright bits of spring blue, overhead. I am bound thither today, for a long solitary stretch of walking.&#x2014; All is in a ferment of <foreign><hi rend="italic">wheesty-whasty</hi></foreign> at present, Lord Johnny out, and no new Ministry to be had for love or money. It is said now, the poor little <foreign><hi rend="italic">reckling</hi></foreign> of a body will have to come back for a short time (very short it is hoped), and then Sir James Grahame<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sir James Graham (<date when="1792">1792</date>&#x2013;<date when="1861">1861</date>; <ref target="volume-26/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/11204"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), who had served as home sec. in Peel&#x2019;s Conser vative govt., <date when="1841">1841</date>&#x2013;<date when="1846">46</date>.</note> or some kind of reasonable person, with force at his back (with force <hi rend="italic">in</hi> his own self especially) will march in. Settle it as you like, gent<hi rend="italic">n;</hi> there is one solitary individual that will accept it <hi rend="italic">either</hi> way.</p>
<p>Jane still stirs about, pretty vigorous, in spite of the cold. Her servant talks of going away again; has fallen accidentally very <hi rend="italic">deaf</hi>, and I suppose <hi rend="italic">ought</hi> to go. A sad never-ceasing botheration, that side of things is!&#x2014; Jack says he sent you the <hi rend="italic">Magazine:</hi> I have another here that will go off to our Mother in a day or two; they engage to send it regularly to you, after reading it. I am glad to hear James has got into a library;&#x2014;also that the young James<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Her husband; the younger James (<date when="1836">1836</date>&#x2013;<date when="1871">71</date>), her son at school.</note> is doing well at <pb id="pg-26-39" n="26:39"/>Closeburn, as we anticipated. He by no means wants for faculty; and the schoolm<hi rend="italic">r</hi> there is good.&#x2014; A young &#x201C;man of genius&#x201C;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Woolner. Probably from Isaac D&#x2019;Israeli, <hi rend="italic">The Literary Character, or the History of Men of Genius</hi> (<date when="1840">1840</date>), a great source of amusement to the Carlyles.</note> (sorrow on him!) stole four hours of my time, and hunted me into hurry for the whole of last week, taking a <hi rend="italic">medallion</hi> of me.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On one occasion William Bell Scott (<date when="1811">1811</date>&#x2013;<date when="1890">90</date>; <ref target="volume-26/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/24938"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), poet and painter and like Woolner one of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, went with the sculptor to Cheyne Row. &#x201C;I think,&#x201C; said Scott, &#x201C;this was my first meeting with [TC]. So peculiar a Scotchman in voice and manner I was not prepared to meet. Natives of the same province recognise at once the clay from which each other must have originally sprung; no amount of schooling can change him or hide the peasant origin from being seen by another of the same locality, although the acutest Londoner does not seem to detect it. But here, face, dress, manners, and accent were all alike those of a man rather proud of humble and provincial antecedents, one not at all ambitious of being a citizen of the world. His conversation was exactly like his Latter-day Pamphlets, only more damnatory, and his descriptions of people and things&#x2014;he did not care so much for talking of books&#x2014;were admirably terse, vivid, and vigorous, but all from one point of view&#x2014;anatomical; his voice, emphatic, enough, was like the rattling of pebbles and boulders driven against each other in a spate. &#x2018;Ah!&#x2019;, said he, &#x2018;you&#x2019;re an artist &#x2026; . But you&#x2019;re something more. Ah, well, I can make nothing of artists, nor of their work either.&#x2019; Let the reader remember he had just been sitting to Woolner for his medallion. &#x2018;Empty as other folk&#x2019;s kettles are, artists&#x2019; kettles are emptier, and good for nothing but tying to the tails of mad dogs. So little do I care to venture on these speculations, I have never been at an exhibition all the many years I have lived in London.&#x2019; This was disappointing to one who held by the self-culture doctrine of the hero of Weimar, Carlyle&#x2019;s hero too! The least self-asserting of all the sons of Adam, I did not like it. &#x2026; But he was morally exactly what I hoped for, intolerant and denunciatory only because truth and justice, or the want of these, were ever present to his mind; his speech obeyed the strictest veracity, and carried with it, on the whole, generous, manful kindness. Still I felt that it was necessary to know him very well or not at all. The furnishing of his good old home was not very exhilarating: his bookshelves were largely filled with the <hi rend="italic">Annual Register</hi>, and nothing but common ugly portraits were on the walls, particularly a poor engraving of the smug face of Francis Jeffrey&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Autobiographical Notes of the Life of William Bell Scott</hi>, ed. W. Minto [<date when="1892">1892</date>] 1:269&#x2013;70).</note> If it prove worth anything, a copy shall be had. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Sister; I am off to walk, and high time!</salute></closer></p>

<p>Will you be so kind as express to the Gent<hi rend="italic">n</hi> of your Committee my thanks, for the honour done me; and my regret to answer,&#x2014;as I must now do,&#x2014;that <pb id="pg-26-40" n="26:40"/>there is not the least possibility of my attending the <foreign>Soiree</foreign> you are about to hold.</p>

<salute>Dearest Babbie</salute>
<p>I am in poor case for writing, having been laid up in bed for pretty well three days. I suppose it is an <hi rend="italic">unpronounced</hi> cold&#x2014;if not the effects of&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">poison!</hi> not that I suppose my Life in any one&#x2019;s way&#x2014;or have been attempting it myself&#x2014;at least voluntarly. I merely wished to get myself some sleep after having gone without it for three nights, and took about four of the third morning a doze of Morphine which might or might <hi rend="italic">not</hi> have been the right quantity&#x2014;for the little black pills had melted and run all together and I had to divide them with a pen knife! All next day I felt quite <hi rend="italic">dead</hi>&#x2014;as if I were only kept going by Galvanism&#x2014; Mazzini dropt on me from the skies,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >He was living mainly in Switzerland after the failure of the Roman Republic, <date when="1849">1849</date>, but had been in London since <date when="1851-02-19">19 Feb.</date></note> and even that surprise did not <hi rend="italic">awake</hi> me&#x2014;and at night I took to fainting and having horrid spasms&#x2014; It might be that the morphine, so useful sometimes, had merely on this occasion had a quarrel in me with the ailment, whatever it was, <pb id="pg-26-41" n="26:41"/>that had been <hi rend="italic">taking away</hi> my sleep&#x2014;certainly the effects of that must be quite over now. and I still feel sick and sore and miserably <hi rend="italic">all overish</hi>&#x2014;</p>
<p>Yesterday I got up about four in the afternoon, and came down to&#x2014;engage a new servant! a thing very repugnant to me ever in a perpendicular position&#x2014;and horrible to think of on the flat of my back. I told you I think that the <hi rend="italic">last new one</hi> had gone deaf on newyearsday&#x2014; She has never recovered yet. and has been a very heavy handful latterly; as I have had to do all the door-answering in the first instance, (having to go to seek <hi rend="italic">her</hi> to <hi rend="italic">open</hi> it) How it gets opened when I am out of the house, I have no conception!&#x2014;then instead of exerting her other faculties to make up for the defect of hearing, she grows more and more nervous and helpless&#x2014;not to be wondered at poor thing! having a most delicate fine-Lady organization to begin with&#x2014; Still I thought if I who was used to her and so hated new faces and new ways could not make shift to <hi rend="italic">go on</hi> with her <hi rend="italic">who</hi> would be likely to <hi rend="italic">begin</hi> with her?&#x2014; And nobody knows how long it would have been before I should have mustered inhumanity enough to give her warning on account of her deafness. to say nothing of courage enough to front another change&#x2014; But a week ago she <hi rend="italic">took the initiative</hi> and told me with the most <hi rend="italic">placid</hi> indifference that she &#x201C;meant to leave in a month&#x201C; as she should certainly &#x201C;die of grief&#x201C; if she went on &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">listening to bells and never hearing them</hi>&#x201C;! But what will you do? I asked&#x2014; &#x2018;Oh&#x2019; (she had it all cut and dry) &#x201C;I will go into <hi rend="italic">a kitchen</hi> where I shall have fellow servants to speak loud to me and, have nothing to do with the bells, or <hi rend="italic">the up stairs.</hi>&#x201C; I could not but approve her purpose&#x2014;provided she get it &#x201C;carried out&#x201C;&#x2014; So yesterday I was engaging another&#x2014;equally refined&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">less sensitive</hi> looking but <hi rend="italic">more sentimental</hi>&#x2014;with I should say a great tendency to &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">George Sandism</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Female emancipation as advocated by Georges Sand.</note> and all that sort of thing&#x201C;&#x2014; I remarked that she did not look very strong&#x2014;the answer was &#x201C;perhaps I look more delicate for being in mourning&#x2014;mourning (for her mother) is <hi rend="italic">such</hi> a <hi rend="small-caps">denial</hi> to a young person! everyone, I think, looks best in colours.&#x201C; But she has a three years character and can cook&#x2014;especially <hi rend="italic">fish</hi> her Mistress said&#x2014;&#x201C;all sorts of fish in all sorts of ways&#x201C;&#x2014;pity we never <hi rend="italic">eat</hi> fish hardly&#x2014; I suppose I shall get hardened to change like other people&#x2014;certainly I am taking this one <hi rend="italic">easily</hi>&#x2014; To be sure there has been no <hi rend="italic">row</hi>&#x2014;the general accompaniment of change&#x2014;and which puts one all bilious at the outset&#x2014; I really <hi rend="italic">am</hi> very sick Babbie dear!&#x2014;and must not begin another sheetkin&#x2014; <closer><salute>Kindest love to Uncle and all the rest</salute></closer></p>

<p>We are ill of Influenza here; I for the last two days, and hoping to get shortly better; my poor Wife for almost a week, and without certainty of that cheering omen.

<salute>Dear Ruskin,&#x2014;</salute>
<p>I did not know yesterday till your servant was gone that there was any note in the parcel; nor at all what a feat you had done! A loan of the gallant young man&#x2019;s Memoirs<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ruskin wrote to TC from Park St., <date when="1851-03-08">8 March</date>, sending him a copy of Herbert Benjamin Edwardes, <hi rend="italic">A Year on the Punjab Frontier in <date when="1848">1848</date>&#x2013;<date when="1849">49</date></hi>, 2 vols. (<date when="1851">1851</date>), asking for it &#x201C;a place in your library&#x201C; as &#x201C;being it seems, a record of many things well <hi rend="italic">done</hi> by him&#x2014;and in many ways expressing also the sincere and frank affections of a very noble mind, which you will have pleasure in learning so freely outspoken. / I sincerely trust that the bearer may bring us back a cheerful account of you, as well as of Mrs. Carlyle&#x2014;to whom I beg to be sincerely remembered. But&#x2014;be the report good or melancholy&#x2014;there is at least some comfort in the community of affliction. Except the Queen&#x2019;s Taxes, I know nothing less escapable than this influenza.&#x201C; TC later sent the letter to Varnhagen for his autograph collection, noting: &#x201C;Ruskin is the Author of some discourses on <hi rend="italic">Painting</hi> and other branches of Art,&#x2014;a far more genial pious-minded critic than we have hitherto had;&#x2014;in which line his Books have had great vogue, and made much noise. He is now in Venice, concluding his Book on &#x2018;The Stones of Venice.&#x2019; An ardent, ingenuous and ingenious man; <hi rend="italic">religious</hi> above all, tho&#x2019; with a <hi rend="italic">creed</hi> of rather uncertain dimensions. Age perhaps 36 or 40; figure thin and high. Son <supplied>[of]</supplied> a wealthy merchant here&#x201C; (MS: Jagiellonian Univ.). TC wrote in his Journal, <date when="1851-03-11">11 March</date>: &#x201C;Read Major Edwardes (of the Punjaub) a hero of those days; good for little, it&#x2014;he, I begin to fear, not good for very <hi rend="italic">much;</hi>&#x2014;but will continue for another couple of nights, and so end the 2 voll.

This, I think, must be in the style <hi rend="italic">prior</hi> to the Renaissance! What can I do but accept your kindness with pleasure and gratitude, though it is far beyond my deserts? Perhaps the next man I meet will use me as much below them; and so bring matters straight again! Truly I am much obliged, and return you many hearty thanks.</p>
<p>I was already deep in the &#x201C;Stones&#x201C;;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ruskin, <hi rend="italic">Stones of Venice</hi>, vol. 1 (<date when="1851">1851</date>), pbd. in <date when="1851-03">March</date>. TC wrote in his Journal, <date when="1851-03-11">11 March</date>: &#x201C;Ruskin&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Stones of Venice</hi> not so bad: a kind of &#x2018;Sermon <hi rend="italic">in</hi> Stones,&#x2019; as I define it,&#x2014;not unwelcome by way of sermon.&#x201C;</note> and clearly purpose to hold on there.

The spirit and purport of these Critical Studies of yours are a singular sign of these times to me, and a very gratifying one. Right good speed to you, and victorious arrival on the farther shore!&#x2014; It is a quite new &#x201C;renaissance,&#x201C; I believe, we are getting into just now;&#x2014;either towards new <hi rend="italic">wider</hi> manhood, <hi rend="italic">high</hi> again as the external stars; or else into final death, and the murk of gehenna<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hell. &#x201C;Murk&#x201C; may be &#x201C;mark&#x201C; or &#x201C;mask.&#x201C;</note> forevermore! A dreadful process, but a needful and inevitable one; nor do I doubt at all which way the issue will be,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; which of the extant nations are to get included in it, and which to be trampled out and abolished in the process, may be very doubtful. God is great:&#x2014;and sure enough, the changes in the construction of Sheepfolds,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ruskin had meant his <hi rend="italic">Notes on the Construction of Sheepfolds</hi> &#x201C;to form part of the appendix to an essay on Architecture&#x201C; (5), presumably the <hi rend="italic">Stones of Venice</hi>, but had also decided to publish it separately as a shilling pamphlet. The title alludes to John 10:16, and the whole pamphlet argues for unity of the Protestant churches &#x201C;in one great Fold&#x201C; (50).</note> as well as in other things, will require to be very considerable!&#x2014;</p>
<p>We are still labouring under the foul fiend of Influenza here, I not far from emancipated, my poor Wife still deep in the business, tho&#x2019; I hope past the deepest. Am I to understand that you too are seized? In a day or two I hope to ascertain that you are well again.&#x2014; <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, here is an interruption,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The MS ends after &#x201C;inter.&#x201C; The remainder is from Collingwood.</note> here also is the end of the paper.</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I ought to write you a word, lest you be too anxious about us; not to speak of my own anxieties about you, in this grim weather, and my desire to have a new Note from the Doctor on that subject. His last came much in season, for we had been long without direct news; and his report was altogether of a favourable kind,&#x2014;how cheering compared to what we might have dreaded! Oh, we have had much good news from Scotsbrig, first and last; and are bound to be humbly grateful for many things in the course of our interest there!&#x2014; Tell him to write to me again soon, and tell me the worst and best.</p>
<p>We have been considerably out of order here, owing mainly to the pernicious <pb id="pg-26-45" n="26:45"/>weather, which is by far the harshest of the whole season hitherto. Stern grey skies, loaded with dust and <foreign>reek</foreign> over and above; and the inhospitablest frosty temperature blowing. Almost every second person has had Influenza; everybody is put out more or less.&#x2014; Poor Jane, as her wont is, directly yielded to the cold; I think it is about ten days ago, she began to get off sleep, to feel weakly; about a week ago she ceased going out, and has had a bad feverish time of it all this while since. No sleep to satisfy; indeed sometimes she does not get above an hour, or two hours, and that in many pieces, all night; dare not try <hi rend="italic">morphine</hi>, which sometimes makes matters worse by many degrees:&#x2014;a bad violent headache one day, <hi rend="italic">morphine</hi> last night with only half effect &#x26;c &#x26;c. Today, first since the headache, she is come down stairs again; but is still very weak;&#x2014;tho&#x2019; now, as we have rain today, I hope for an improvement of the weather, and that will mend many things. Another bad item in the Catalogue was my own being seized with this same Influenza: I had been careful, diligently steady to my work, diligent in exercise and abstinence; nevertheless the villainous distemper, taking advantage of a sum of small things, got hold of me one morning last week, and for about 30 hours made a miserable snivelling monster of me; especially during the first <hi rend="italic">night</hi> of the affair! However, I struck in resolutely with blue-pill, and stopt that <hi rend="italic">gilravish</hi> of confusions;&#x2014;have got better gradually ever since; and have now this day fairly taken to my work again,&#x2014;which I found it better to abstain from, while the nasty headache &#x26;c were upon me.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC wrote in his Journal, <date when="1851-03-11">11 March</date>: &#x201C;Writing at <hi rend="italic">John Sterling</hi> (interrupted for a week by horrid <hi rend="italic">influenza</hi> &#x26;c); proceeds still under bad conditions.&#x201C;</note> I went out every day, even my worst day for a little;&#x2014;indeed I find the thing is not cold at all, but <hi rend="italic">bile</hi> and the liver, at least with me. There remains little of it now, except the strange <hi rend="italic">smell</hi> in one&#x2019;s nose, which I have observed to be the concluding phenomenon in colds. I trust to report well of poor Jane too in a short while.</p>
<p>Mazzini has reappeared, you may tell John that is <hi rend="italic">our</hi> chief fruit of &#x201C;continental reaction.&#x201C; M<hi rend="italic">i</hi> looks fresh and cheery; will &#x201C;stay 3 months,&#x201C; then try it farther. I hear also incidentally that Neuberg <hi rend="italic">is</hi> at Berlin. A very solid excell<hi rend="italic">t</hi> man, an official Mr Twistleton<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edward Turner Boyd Twisleton.</note> whom we sometimes see was asking zealously When the rest of <hi rend="italic">Dante</hi> might be looked for?<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Carlyle was continuing to translate <hi rend="italic">The Divine Comedy;</hi> his trans. of the <hi rend="italic">Inferno</hi> had appeared in <date when="1849">1849</date>.</note> This also you can mention to the Translator; one sample out of several of the like (valuable) kind in our stock.&#x2014; &#x2014; On Saturday I sent <hi rend="italic">Gilfillan</hi>,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-26/lt-18510220-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1851-02-20">20 Feb.</date></ref></note> thinking you might find something in it; the <hi rend="italic">type</hi> at least is good,&#x2014;and the man truly means not ill. Jane had before <hi rend="italic">weighed</hi> it one day; reported it above 2 lb; and lo, on my determining to send it still, it proved under!&#x2014;&#x2014; <closer><salute>Remember me lovingly to Jamie, Isabella, <pb id="pg-26-46" n="26:46"/>and every one. And tell John to write soon. Ever yours, dear Mother,&#x2014;</salute></closer><name>T. Carlyle</name></p>

<p><salute>Dear Duffy,&#x2014;</salute>Welcome to London;&#x2014;tho&#x2019; it is not on the best terms: you unwell will find us unwell,&#x2014;happily only of influenza &#x26;c &#x26;c.

Acting for the council of the Tenant League Duffy had come to London to persuade John Stuart Mill to represent an Irish county in Parliament and ask TC to introduce him to Mill. TC &#x201C;complied promptly. He could do this much without scruple, he said, but I must understand that Mill and he had ceased to see much of each other in later times, as, in fact, they had nothing at all in common. Mill had one faculty in great perfection, he possessed the power of setting forth his opinions with a lucidity which no one in England could match. What he aimed to make you see you saw as plainly as a conspicuous object set in the sunshine. But he had the habit of approaching everything by the way of logical analysis, and when he brought the method to bear upon a question he got out of it nearly all it could yield him. There were probably quite other qualities in it, not at all to be detected by logical analysis, and altogether unsuspected by him. Of the true relations of things in the universe, Mill had small insight or none. He was inclined to scream and shriek about matters of no real importance, and to believe in unrealities of various sorts&#x201C; (Duffy 166).</note> Square myself.&#x2014; &#x2014; Come you tomorrow night; to tea, 7 o&#x2019;clock;&#x2014;or almost any night, if tomorrow will not do; and in fine let us see you straightway.</p>

<p>We got John&#x2019;s short but welcome Note; for which, thanks. You would be greatly contented by the good news from Alick. I sent the Letter on to Dumfries duly the same day.</p>

We are to see him here expressly soon.&#x2014; Here also is a hardly legible Letter from Craik, which John may light his pipe with (I had been sending &#x201C;Autographs&#x201C; to Craik for a bazaar: that is the origin of the &#x201C;thanks,&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">if</hi> they prove legible).&#x2014; The Ministry, men think, is in a dying way again.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edward George G.

<salute>Dear Kingsley,</salute>
<p>If this young Nobleman<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Identified on the MS, in an unknown hand, as George Frederick Samuel Robinson (<date when="1827">1827</date>&#x2013;<date when="1909">1909</date>; <ref target="volume-26/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/35792"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), known as Viscount Goderich, <date when="1833">1833</date>&#x2013;<date when="1859">59</date>; a friend and follower of Kingsley, F. D. Maurice, and Thomas Hughes (<date when="1822">1822</date>&#x2013;<date when="1896">96</date>; <ref target="volume-26/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/14091"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>). He wrote to TC, <date when="1851-03-24">24 March</date>, from 1 Carlton Gardens: &#x201C;I have this morning heard from Mr. Kingsley, who tells me that you are so kind as to say that you will allow me to call on you tomorrow; &#x26; I write to thank you very much &#x26; say that I will be at Chelsea soon after 3 o&#x2019;clock tomorrow afternoon.&#x201C; TC sent Varnhagen the letter as an autograph (as he occasionally did), with the note: &#x201C;Lord Goderich, a youth of 4 or 5 and 20 is eldest son of the Earl of Ripon (pronounce Rippon) who was once Mr. Robinson, and is still nicknamed &#x2018;Prosperity Robinson&#x2019; on occasion. This young Nobleman inclines to the Chartist cause; a new sign of the times,&#x2014;which, however, will probably &#x2018;not set the Thames on fire&#x2019; (as our proverb is)&#x201C; (MS: Jagiellonian Univ.).</note> imagines he can get any furtherance towards a solution of his thrice-intricate problem by a sight of me, surely it
were very <pb id="pg-26-49" n="26:49"/>hard to refuse him. Not to say that I have myself a kind of curiosity to see the one young Englishman of rank who does <hi rend="italic">not</hi> mean to live as a leaf upon the winds, of whom experience or report has yet given me any notice. On Tuesday next at 3 o&#x2019;clock, he may find me here in my lair; or almost any other day at the same hour, if that do not suit and he will send me warning. Poor fellow, there is a bigger gulph ahead of him than perhaps of any of us (Alton Locke included), tho&#x2019; the vulgar think he has a bridge of gold (<hi rend="italic">bridge</hi>, alas!)&#x2014;and to get across will be difficult and glorious.</p>
<p>I saw Maurice the other night; and got a few friendly words from him, the first these many months. The world is all much occupied with red stockings,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cardinals such as Wiseman. The govt.&#x2019;s Ecclesiastical Titles Bill, forbidding non-Anglican clergy to assume titles taken from any place within the U.K., passed its second reading, <date when="1851-03-25">25 March</date>, but was not enforced and was repealed, <date when="1871">1871</date>.</note> in a very melancholy way; and looks to me like a big foolish blockhead who had obstinately stuck his nose into the gutter, and lay there resigned to drown, no help for him poor blockhead, in half an inch of dirty water! Good Heavens&#x2014;But silence is better than speech.</p>
<p>I have read your friend <hi rend="italic">Edwardes:</hi> he does slightly resemble his <hi rend="italic">face</hi>, after all; but is a gallant brisk young fellow too, and will learn to close his steam-valves better by and by. He has set me afloat on that Indus regime and I am reading all manner of things.&#x2014; &#x2014; <closer><salute>Good speed to you; a clear eye and a stout heart always. Our best regards to Mrs Kingsley.&#x2014; In haste,</salute></closer></p>

<p>There is no doubt but your story concerning Luther&#x2019;s K&#xE4;the (Kate)
<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Martin Luther (<date when="1483">1483</date>&#x2013;
<date when="1546">1546</date>) m., <date when="1525">1525</date>, Katharina von Bora (<date when="1499">1499</date>&#x2013;<date when="1552">1552</date>), a fugitive nun. His <hi rend="italic">Tischreden</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Table Talk</hi>) was first pbd., <date when="1566">1566</date>, but the story is not told there. According to M.

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Twistleton and his friend Adderley are coming to us on Monday Ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi>,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC is writing on Sat. Twisleton wrote to TC, <date when="1851-03-27">27 March</date>, that he and Charles Bowyer Adderley, Conservative M.P., m. to Twisleton&#x2019;s cousin, Julia, b. Leigh, meant to call, adding that Adderley was &#x201C;in Politics a Conservative, when a final Party vote is to be given, but he has taken up warmly the cause of Colonial Reform, and he has received a Testimonial (in the shape of a Chair) from the Inhabitants of the Cape, for his opposition to the scheme of sending Convicts thither. He spends his money liberally on Philanthropic or religious objects&#x2014;and is extremely anxious always to do what he deems right, having a strong sense of the responsibilities of Property.&#x201C; TC notes on the letter, sent as an autograph to Varnhagen: &#x201C;Hon. Edward Twistleton, young brother of Lord Say and Sele;&#x2014;the Lord Say and Sele of Oliver Cromwell&#x2019;s time used to be named &#x2018;Old Subtlety&#x2019; (his name is still in <hi rend="italic">Say</hi>brook [New York] N. America); T. descends from him by the female line. Latterly chief Poor-law Commissioner in Ireland; where, in the eyes of the discerning, he much distinguished himself as a man of fidelity and ability. One of the most human official men I have ever known. Has considerable literature too; translated Goethe&#x2019;s Novelle long ago, which did not sell. Is now (<date when="1851-10">Oct<hi rend="italic">r</hi> 1851</date>) travelling, the second time, in the United States.&#x201C; He was still interested in Irish affairs.</note> at 8 o&#x2019;clock; nobody else to be here. If you are disengaged at that time, and <pb id="pg-26-51" n="26:51"/>could come, we should be very glad. A little more talk with you is a thing we calculate on, before you take the water again.</p>

<salute>Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>We received your two Notes, and are much obliged by them, brief as they were: we have no other way of getting news from Scotsbrig; and in that essential particular you never fail us. I see you are very busy; no doubt you have plenty of writing which you are obliged to see done; and I know by experience how little one is disposed for Letters, when a long spell of that kind is coming or is got over.</p>
<p>Our good Mother it appears has had a cold; which we are right glad to hear was of brief continuance. The wonder rather is, she had not had more illness this spring: here it has been one of the unhealthiest; universal influenza &#x26;c &#x26;c: indeed such weather as was enough to make any weak person unhealthy. The good Mother&#x2014;she will get out now when the <foreign>gowans</foreign> come, and the clear skies: Oh take care of her; it is a perpetual comfort to me that you are there to do that. Isabella too, we hope, will get rid of her infliction soon;&#x2014;and the doorways will dry up about you all, and the bright spring make you comfortable, after its wrestle with black winter is over. For above a week past, or indeed two weeks, the iron grimness of the North-east has been dissolved in such a deluge of wet as I never here saw before, at one time; warm mud and mugginess, with rain, rain, so that one wished almost to be a fish or a duck! Yesterday came a bright brisk blink of weather; and I went a long walk by Streatham &#x26;c, no company but Nero and the skies and earth; one of the finest of spring days: but this morning, we have the old story back with <pb id="pg-26-52" n="26:52"/>interest; sudden cataracts of rain;&#x2014;and so, I suppose, it must last for some time. Let us not complain: it is blessed in comparison to the stern Northeast with its influenzas.</p>
<p>My little bit of writing wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> had held me busy lately is now over, or nearly so for the moment, and I mean to have a loose day or two for rest before farther enterprising. It was a Sketch of John Sterling&#x2019;s life which I have been putting down;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC wrote in his Journal, <date when="1851-04-01">1 April</date>: &#x201C;First draught of <hi rend="italic">Sterling</hi> finished; Wife and A<hi rend="italic">y</hi> St<hi rend="italic">g</hi> advise to print it: worth little; but we shall see. A new kind of enterprise for me; and a thing, at any rate, which required to be done.&#x201C;</note> uncertain what to do with it: but Jane reading it yesterday warmly votes for immediate printing; so that probably will be its fate,&#x2014;so soon as I have got a <hi rend="italic">second</hi> edition made of it. I guess there is at pres<hi rend="italic">t</hi> about half a volume; with some letters &#x26;c that are to go in and other extensions that will be permissible or useful, it will make a small volume perhaps by itself; and, being a <hi rend="italic">true</hi> story, containing light glimpses into several things, may be read without harm by those interested.&#x2014; I was bound to do it; and it has not been very ill to do.</p>
<p>Duffy is here, for two weeks past; going tomorrow: we have seen but little of him,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; he is near by; staying in your old room, since ten or twelve days: Mrs Thorburn<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Carlyle&#x2019;s former landlady at Hemus Terr., N of and nr. Cheyne Row.</note> seemed glad that Jane recommended him thither. Twistleton and he dined one ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi>, another day he breakfasted; pleasant both times, but attended with such an explosion of bother and such volumes of <hi rend="italic">talk</hi> (on my poor part, mainly)<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The talk was apparently mostly about J. S. Mill and Harriet Taylor. Duffy reports: &#x201C;After pausing a little for anything I might have to say, [TC] proceeded: At one time we saw a good deal of Mill. In the Reform Bill era he was an innocent young creature, with rich auburn hair and gentle pathetic expression, beautiful to contemplate; but a domestic embroilment drove him to adopt a secluded monastic sort of life, in which people saw little of him but the work he did. His life had been wrecked by a Platonic, and quite innocent, affection for a married lady, who had since become his wife [in fact, not till the next month], concerning whom he had got possessed by an idea, or, indeed, a series of ideas, which were altogether absurd and insupportable. He regarded her as the paragon of womankind, which she was not by long odds; far otherwise than a paragon, one might safely say. She was the daughter of a Radical doctor, who married her to Taylor, a Radical and Socinian, an honest, simple sort of man, who had no doubt that the ideas which prevailed among this class of persons afforded a sufficient solution for all the hard problems of life. W. J. Fox [<date when="1786">1786</date>&#x2013;<date when="1864">1864</date>; <ref target="volume-26/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/10047"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>], who had a chapel in Finsbury, where he patronised Peter and Paul as ignorant but well-intentioned persons, and delivered prayers which some one described as the most eloquent prayers that ever were addressed to (<hi rend="italic">mimicking and laughing</hi>) a British audience! Fox had probably the Taylors among his congregation; at any rate, he came to know that Mrs. Taylor, a vivacious little body, found her life among the Socinians wearisome, and he told her that John Mill was the man among the human race to relieve in a competent manner her dubieties and difficulties. He brought Mill to see her; and Mill, who had probably never before looked into a woman&#x2019;s face, was spell-bound. She was a shrewd woman, with a taste for coquetry, and she took possession of Mill and wrapped him up like a cocoon. He used to go to her in all his trouble to be comforted, and in all his difficulties to be guided, and probably to be flattered a little besides. / From that time all Mill&#x2019;s enjoyments in life centred in her. Taylor remonstrated with her on the extent to which the intimacy was carried; but she told him he might blow up the house if it seemed good to him, but she could not, under any circumstances, give up this friendship, as she would probably call it. There were children to be considered, and he thought he had better endure the thing than make a clamour and a catastrophe. &#x2026; / Mrs. Carlyle &#x2026; said Mrs. Mill was not the pink of womankind as her husband conceived, but a peculiarly affected and empty body. She was not easy unless she startled you with unexpected sayings. &#x2026; / Carlyle went on to say that when he came down to London, his intimacy with Mill was for a considerable time close and regular. &#x2026; He could not account for this intimacy suddenly ending; neither had altered in fundamentals, nor were they further from agreeing than they had always been. / I suggested that if Mill had heard his estimate of Mrs. Taylor, there need be no difficulty in accounting for the change&#x201C; (Duffy 167&#x2013;70).</note> as quite disaffects me to such operations. Poor Duffy is in <pb id="pg-26-53" n="26:53"/>bad health, evidently much hurt about the <hi rend="italic">liver</hi> or somewhere; Jane does not like the look of his health at all: he is <hi rend="italic">truanting</hi> just now for health&#x2019;s sake, but seems to have endless business about his Tenant-league and such like. He had to ask Mill to become M. P for said league;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Tenant League, organized <date when="1850">1850</date>, wanted fair rents and permanent tenure for Irish farmers, and, <date when="1850">1850</date>&#x2013;<date when="1854">54</date>, tried to unite Presbyterians and Catholics of the south to gain them. TC and Duffy called on Mill at India House, <date when="1851-03-28">28 March</date>, when, in a letter meant for Frederick Lucas, who was supposed to go with Duffy to call on him (Duffy 166), Mill regretfully refused the League&#x2019;s &#x201C;flattering proposal&#x201C; as incompatible with his examinership in the East India Co. Reform of the land tenure would have been &#x201C;congenial to my principles (&#x26; convictions),&#x201C; since more than any other cause it &#x201C;keeps the great body of the agricultural population of Ireland always on the verge of starvation&#x201C; (Mineka 14:57&#x2013;58).</note> Mill of course could not,&#x2014;was not worth a doit if he even could. Duffy himself is to be a Member; item Lucas:<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lucas was elected M.P. for co. Meath, and Duffy for New Ross, <date when="1852">1852</date>.</note> they will have a merry time of it!&#x2014;I saw Chapman the other day: y<hi rend="italic">r Dante</hi> is pleasing the man by its continued progress.

<salute>Dear Jean,</salute>
<p>It is a good while since I heard directly from you; and I know not on which side the debt lies; but having a few minutes to myself this morning, I will send you a word before going farther. Along with this comes, as some former N<hi rend="italic">os</hi> of the same have done, a current N<hi rend="italic">o</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">Critic</hi>,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Critic;</hi> see <ref target="volume-25/lt-18500207-TC-EC-01"><sic>25:20</sic><corr>TC to EC, <date when="1850-02-07">7 Feb. 1850</date></corr></ref>.</note> a wretched literary Newspaper which some unknown hand has taken to forwarding for my perusal of late: it seems to come once a fortnight; gets from me a very cursory inspection;&#x2014;and is usually forwarded to Dumfries, in hopes of being better studied there.

<p>We have had tempestuous wet weather here, and bitter icy dry,&#x2014;attended with influenzas and so forth;&#x2014;but that is mostly off now, and the <date when="1851-04">April</date> spring advancing in due form. Both Jane and I, as perhaps you heard, had influenza, she for a series of weeks: a very vile complaint, which we are glad to be well rid of in the mean-time.&#x2014; The world is as loud and as idle as it usually has been at this season here. &#x201C;Papal aggression&#x201C; with its empty ineffectual noises has got to silence for the time: nothing but the &#x201C;Crystal Palace,&#x201C; and <hi rend="italic">its</hi> still emptier syllabub of nonsense, is now talked of by the fools among us. The Crystal Palace, covering 21 acres (with several huge <hi rend="italic">trees</hi> growing in it), and all of glass, except the walls which are of board, is certainly the biggest glass edifice ever built,&#x2014;a birdcage such as never was before; thousands of idle blockheads sauntering about it at all hours:&#x2014;but in the late tempests it took to <hi rend="italic">letting in rain</hi> dreadfully; hundreds of sappers (a kind of artillery soldiers) were set to bale in the last wet days: and, alas, I fear privately (remembering our Craigenputtoch Sky-window) it will never be got to turn water altogether, nothing but a <hi rend="italic">double</hi> roof would enable it to do that, in high fierce winds from Southwest! We hear also that thousands of sparrows have got into it, by the ventilators &#x26;c; and can&#x2019;t be got out; they have called in the
aid of <hi rend="italic">arsenic</hi>, and in fact, with dead sparrows and &#x2019;live, have their own ados.&#x2014; Bearded foreign people are already beginning to encumber the streets; and I suppose, in six weeks hence, there will really be a great and a very ugly crowd of British and <pb id="pg-26-55" n="26:55"/>Foreign blockheads gathered here. My fixed determination is, to hold myself in readiness to fly out of it,&#x2014;I know not in the least whitherward, to Germany perhaps; it depends on so many things. You must tell the good Mrs Charteris, if she ask farther, that if we did <hi rend="italic">both</hi> come to Scotland, surely her offer about Cullivate<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-26/lt-18510123-TC-JCA-01">TC to JCA, <date when="1851-01-23">23 Jan.</date></ref></note> w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be highly acceptable, and in the meanwhile that I am much obliged by it; but that we are far too uncertain to be counted on, and that practically she must not depend on us at all.</p>
<p>I have been scribbling, for five or six weeks past a very slight performance, a <hi rend="italic">life of John Sterling</hi> (a valued friend of mine, and a very fine fellow, who died 7 years ago): the Bookseller has got it away this morning; when once trimmed out, it will make a readable volume if we decide on publishing it just now. I do not think it will be good for much; but Jane advises printing.&#x2014; A very short Note from John reported that Isabella was ailing a little with cold, that our Mother (<hi rend="italic">after</hi> a short cold) was tolerably well, as the rest.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Amalie B&#xF6;lte continued to report on the Carlyles to Varnhagen.

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Tho&#x2019; I have got a very bad pen, and am in no good case for writing, I will not let the Saturday pass and the week end without a little word to you, which I know will give you some pleasure tomorrow. I have heard nothing from you this week, and am not without my anxieties about the cold frosty air, and its effects on poor Isabella and you: I can only hope you are not suffering beyond usual from it; and long for another express message to that effect. The weather is bright here, with minimal April showers; but, for the last few days, has been getting <hi rend="italic">drier</hi>, and treating us to frost at night, which I think answers rather worse for one than wet thro&#x2019; the day. Both Jane and I keep moving about, at a rather brisk rate, nevertheless; and are in general fully up to our usual level.</p>
<p>I told the Doctor about <hi rend="italic">John Sterling&#x2019;s Life</hi>, a small insignificant Book or Pamphlet I have been writing. The Bookseller got it away from me the other morning, to see <hi rend="italic">how much there is of it</hi>, in the first place: I know not altogether <pb id="pg-26-56" n="26:56"/>myself whether it is worth printing or not; but rather think that will be the end of it whether or not. It has cost little trouble, and need not do much ill, if it do not great amount of good!&#x2014; I have sometimes in view to write down some account of <hi rend="italic">Edward Irving</hi> too while my hand is in: but this, if I even did write it, and had the materials for writing it (Letters &#x26;c, which I have not) would not do for publishing during my own lifetime.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC wrote about Irving, <date when="1866">1866</date>, in his <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi>, pbd. <date when="1881">1881</date>.</note>&#x2014; Alas, alas, I have so many things still to write; immense masses of things&#x2014;and the time for writing them gets ever <hi rend="italic">shorter</hi>, and (as it seems) the composure, strength and other opportunity, less and less! We must do what we can.</p>
<p>London becomes more and more crowded; figures in <hi rend="italic">beards</hi> (from abroad) and figures in country coats (from the home provinces) are already frequent in the streets and omnibuses. Sorrow on them, the idle blockheads;&#x2014;and on us, who have sent for them by our idleness! The decided likelihood is that I shall run and leave London when this foolish &#x201C;Exhibition&#x201C; makes the place too hot for me: but in what direction I shall go is not in the least clear. Jack invited me a while ago to Scotsbrig and to you for shelter,&#x2014;thanks, dear Mother, many are the times I have taken shelter with you!&#x2014;but this, I conclude, at present, will hardly answer: in fact I am weak (very irritable too, under my bits of burdens, and bad company for anybody); and shall need a <hi rend="italic">long</hi> spell in the country somewhere if I can get it. Some <hi rend="italic">water-cure</hi>, Germany, various places rise on my poor fancy:&#x2014;and in general I feel as if it would be very good for me to be <hi rend="italic">covered under a tub</hi>, wherever I go,&#x2014;or at least set to work, like James Aitken&#x2019;s half-mad friend, &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Ay maistly in a place by himsel&#x2019;.</hi>&#x201C;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The friend was James or John Thomson; see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350128-TC-JCA-01"><sic>8:21</sic><corr>TC to JCA, <date when="1845-01-28">28 Jan. 1845</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014; &#x2014; We shall see, we shall see.</p>
<p>The other night we were at dinner with the Ashburtons; a pleasant kind of party, Henry Drummond Milnes &#x26;c there: tonight we are to go to the Ferguses <hi rend="italic">quite by themselves</hi> too (that is the bargain), which will at least do less ill to us on the health side.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC wrote in his Journal, <date when="1851-04-06">6 April</date>: &#x201C;Sad dinner with the Ferguses last night; two unutterable people there, a Capt<hi rend="italic">n</hi> and his wife: old Captain in black wig, no brains under it; d<hi rend="italic">o</hi> wife, <foreign>kleinst&#xE4;dtisch</foreign> [provincial] with head and face like a cock&#x2019;s, who talked incessantly. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Eheu, eheu!</hi></foreign>&#x201C;.</note> Two other dinners are ahead for next week (to my horror); and then I hope there will for a good long while be no more of them. Jane rather likes to go, or seems to like; otherwise I think I w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> refuse them nearly <hi rend="italic">all:</hi>&#x2014;but yet perhaps that also would not do.&#x2014;&#x2014; Dear Mother, here is John Chorley who has sat himself down to wait for me: I must end. How is Isabella&#x2019;s cold,&#x2014;and my Mother?<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Isabella Carlyle wrote Janet Hanning, <date when="1851-04-04">4 April</date>: &#x201C;Your mother is lying today, the effects of another washing. the illness she had about three weeks ago was from the same cause, nothing can prevent her, she condescended to let the fortnight&#x2019;s washing be done without meddling but began again the day before yesterday when none of us knew. I am not so well as when I wrote you last I take the cold in all forms, I have a bad cough just now; I cannot go to the door but am the worse of it &#x2026; the rest here are all going on in the usual way <hi rend="italic">struggling</hi> to get enough of work done&#x201C; (MS: Yale).</note> Bid Jack write.</p>

<salute>Dear James,</salute>
<p>Yesterday there was sent off, by railway, to your address, a small Box, containing a Plaster cast of a <hi rend="italic">Medallion</hi>,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >By Woolner.</note> which you will discover (I hope) to be meant to represent a certain friend of yours. The Box is franked; it should arrive about the same time as this letter.&#x2014; The Medallion is designed for my Mother (if she care about it); but there will be certain modifications to introduce,&#x2014;I mean some kind of <hi rend="italic">frame</hi> with a bit of glass, for preserving the thing when it is hung up:&#x2014;these will need to be done at Dumfries before it go to my Mother; and these I am now writing (in furious haste!) to commit to <hi rend="italic">your</hi> charge. I did not open the Box myself at all; nor do I know what state the Medallion is in, nor <hi rend="italic">what</hi> ought to be done for fitting it to hang safely on a wall: but do you look to it, get what is proper <hi rend="italic">done</hi>, send the Package on to Scotsbrig, and then the account of expense to me;&#x2014;and all will be right, and I will thank you very much. Some <hi rend="italic">paint</hi> the Medallion with more <hi rend="italic">lintseed</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> <hi rend="italic">oil</hi>, and so think it safe: but I rather believe a <hi rend="italic">ring</hi> frame of plain wood or the like, with a lid of glass will be the real thing.</p>
<p>Jean&#x2019;s things, bought for me long ago, have just come from Scotsbrig: all right and welcome. I am on an appoint<hi rend="italic">t</hi> to go and see certain &#x201C;National Schools&#x201C; with an official person;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edward Carleton Tufnell.

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>It was on Wednesday last that the Package of Ham &#x26;c, all perfectly safe, arrived here; it was not till next day that the Butcher was got in to saw the Ham in two;&#x2014;so that we have just given it two trials; and, as I was called off yesterday early, this is the first opportunity I have had to report progress upon that matter. Many thanks to you, dear good Mother! You never weary doing some kindness to us; many are the proofs we have about us how kind a being you are; how old age, and many sorrows of your own cannot chill the affectionate heart you have! In all my wanderings this has been a sure comfort, a great possession to me; and surely I ought to recognize the bounty of Heaven in continuing it to me. Much changes, but the heart of my Mother does not change towards me, and never will, I think: this is beautiful to see amid the ruins of so many earthly things. Thanks and again thanks.</p>
<p>Everything, I said, was safe: a Ham of <hi rend="italic">gigantic</hi> size; and, I am to add now that the quality is first-rate also: good to start with; and, to all appearance, <hi rend="italic">perfectly</hi> cured, which is a most essential condition, and one by no means always complied with, I believe we ought to eat with all diligence; and get forward with the operation before the summer heats get too sultry, and threaten to intervene. With diligence on <hi rend="italic">both</hi> sides of the table (such as we see at present), something may be done perhaps!&#x2014; The nightcaps, especially the <hi rend="italic">sponge</hi>, were welcome; I am now laid well in with <hi rend="italic">soap</hi>,&#x2014;bar on bar of it lying here (for there was still one bar not broken when this last arrived):&#x2014;the razors I had hoped James Aitken would perhaps <hi rend="italic">keep</hi>, for I have six others rather good ones beside me; finding these last two to be still very bad, indeed worse than ever, I have given them away: Jane knows a man, whose chin is tougher than mine.&#x2014; &#x2014; On Thursday last I sent you off a little Box containing I fear a very worthless kind of article: a plaster <hi rend="italic">Medallion</hi> of myself; done by a cleverish artist here, whom perhaps I spoke of once before. He sent <hi rend="italic">me</hi> the Box all ready for travelling, nailed &#x26;c; so that we never looked into it; we had found it (the likeness, that is) to be rather tolerably good, <hi rend="italic">before</hi> it was Cast into bronze or stucco: Jane is to have a copy of her own one of these days; so I sent this first one off to you; by way of Dumfries, for it needs some <hi rend="italic">framing</hi>, I suppose, which I requested James Aitken to look after. I suppose he may get it <hi rend="italic">today;</hi> and before long, you will probably get some account of it from him.&#x2014; So much for that poor little affair. I hope you <hi rend="italic">burnt</hi> the Hogg Engraving, <pb id="pg-26-59" n="26:59"/>that of the &#x201C;idiot labouring under castor-oil?&#x201C; Our six are all up the <foreign><hi rend="italic">lum</hi></foreign>, and nobody has heard of it in these parts.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC wrote in his Journal, <date when="1851-04-06">6 April</date>: &#x201C;Scandalous blotch of a Portrait (so-called) in an Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Magazine called <hi rend="italic">Hogg&#x2019;s Instructor</hi>, came last night.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>We had your Letter, and were very glad of the good news it brought. Our poor Mother has struggled very well thro&#x2019; the rigours of winter, I think; and now that the Sun is come back, we hope she will be sensibly better. You will have days now that will permit your expedition to Gill, or whithersoever you like. A happy change in regard to air and temperature has taken place here, which does us all more or less good. Up to Wednesday last the weather for a week or more had been grim as Iceland: but it suddenly changed at that time; and in eight-and-forty hours, fully a half of one&#x2019;s clothing had to be laid aside; and one now walks about under a sky as of Tempe,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >An idyllic valley in ancient Greece.</note> the blossoms all bursting out on a sudden; and the Summer seeming almost to threaten, &#x201C;You shall have enough of me before long!&#x201C; If the temperature, wind and sun, would stay exactly as they are, I should call it a perfect state of weather. But it will not; it cannot! We shall have a bout or two of frost yet; and then heat to roast the marrow out of one: that is the rule of things.</p>
<p>I am meditating often what I shall do with myself during this Glass-Palace affair, with its Quackery of all Nations; but have not yet fully settled, except that out of it I must some way or other make a great effort to be. Indeed I often wish to be out of this place altogether, for a year or two at least;&#x2014;and shall perhaps contrive to manage it somehow. My health, and much else in me, might very sensibly improve. We shall see.&#x2014; Quiet, meanwhile; hold thy <hi rend="italic">tongue!</hi> I say to myself.</p>
<p>Nothing is yet settled about <hi rend="italic">Sterling&#x2019;s Life:</hi> Fuz begged it for the present; there will need to be additions to make a volume of it; and I, for my own share attach no importance to the thing, or to the publishing of it. Probably put it off till next year, at any rate?&#x2014; &#x2014; Meanwhile I am not very busy with any kind of writing; scribble this or that daily; but do not see yet how any <hi rend="italic">true</hi> and considerable Book is to grow out of those <foreign><hi rend="italic">disjecta membra</hi></foreign> [scattered pieces], or the sour waters they are jumbling and tossing upon. Patience, patience!</p>
<p>Jane is pretty well; eats daily, with relish, to breakfast, as I do with still more emphasis, a bit of the excellent Annandale Ham (tell my Mother); walks a tolerable space; and is in better spirits than one often sees in her case. The dog Nero (who is rather troublesome to the philosophic mind, and <hi rend="italic">dirty</hi> if not often washed) goes out with her in the forenoon, out with <hi rend="italic">me</hi> towards midnight (oftenest about 11), and is the happiest of little dogs, poor wretch!&#x2014; &#x2014; We had John Gordon one ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi> about a week ago: &#x201C;<foreign>Hooh, Hoo!</foreign>&#x201C; the same old <pb id="pg-26-62" n="26:62"/>scanty-speaking, deep-laughing, dull and friendly Gordon that he ever was. <foreign>Ay de mi!</foreign>&#x2014; He spoke very kindly of you and your affairs; was far enough from eloquent on anything else.</p>
<p>I have been thinking much about this strange experiment of the French, with their forty-feet wire pendulum, to <hi rend="italic">prove</hi> that the Earth turns on its axis.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The experiment described was first carried out in Paris by the physicist Jean Bernard L&#xE9;on Foucault (<date when="1819">1819</date>&#x2013;<date when="1868">68</date>) and then exhibited elsewhere on the Continent and in England, most prominently at the Royal Inst., <date when="1851-05-09">9 May</date> (<hi rend="italic">Athenaeum</hi>, <date when="1851-06-14">14 June</date>). TC wrote of it in his Journal, <date when="1851-04-17">17 April</date>, concluding: &#x201C;At first hearing of it, I reckoned the thing flatly impossible; but the night before last, falling out of sleep, I took the matter up amid my chaotic meditations; gradually found it to be indubitable, and, on the whole, the prettiest scientific experiment that has been made in my time.&#x201C;</note> One night lately, bursting awake, and getting into all manner of chaotic meditations, this <hi rend="italic">pen</hi>dulum among other things came into my head; and I then first saw that it was <hi rend="italic">not</hi> &#x201C;impossible&#x201C;; that it was an indubitable <hi rend="italic">fact</hi>,&#x2014;and probably the beautifullest <hi rend="italic">experiment</hi> that has been made in our epoch. Take such a pendulum (4 or 5 pounds of metal, 35 feet of fine wire) to the <hi rend="italic">Pole</hi> of the world: it was then I first got to see it. Hang it up directly over the N. Pole; put a radiated circle (any figure of a circle, like a common <hi rend="italic">cart-wheel</hi>) under it; and set the pendulum swinging: pendulum <hi rend="italic">will</hi> swing &#x201C;always in the same plane&#x201C;; circle of course will go round under it (half-round, the pendulum will seem to go, till the wire get half a twist, then <hi rend="italic">back</hi> by the other semicircle while it <hi rend="italic">un</hi>twists itself): in 24 hours the pendulum will have swung across every conceivable diameter of your circle,&#x2014;and proved to all creatures that the Earth turns! The like, more or less, will take place at every latitude; under highly complex conditions at every latitude but O&#xB0;, and always with longer <hi rend="italic">time</hi> (at London, or lat 52&#xB0;, it is said to require 30 hours instead of 24), the pendulum will work round the circle,&#x2014;till you get towards the Equator when it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> require thousands of <hi rend="italic">years</hi> to do it; and <hi rend="italic">at</hi> the Equator it cannot be done at all. Is not this pretty? It will exhaust all the resources of your Solid Geometry to get it properly conceived; and indeed these (if they are like mine) will not suffice to do it. But the thing in general is <hi rend="italic">indubitable;</hi> and among scientific nicknacks certainly altogether bears away the palm. A <hi rend="italic">prettier</hi> experiment one could hardly imagine.&#x2014;N. b. They have no &#x201C;apparatus&#x201C; (and I doubt, can have none) &#x201C;for keeping the pendulum in motion&#x201C;: you merely set it swinging, and it will go for half an hour, within which time, within the 4<hi rend="italic">th</hi> of which time, the effect (they say) is quite noticeable.&#x2014; &#x2014; Forgive me, dear Brother, for bothering you so long about this; and, except you have leisure, don&#x2019;t take it into your head at all, or perhaps you may not so soon get it out again! Unless indeed <hi rend="italic">Dante</hi> will drive it; with which task I doubt not you continue always busy.</p>
<p>Jamie will now know a little what &#x201C;drinkers (meaning jurymen) <foreign>dree!</foreign>&#x201C;&#x2014; I am glad to hear he is getting such a seedtime. Would my Mother like a Copy <pb id="pg-26-63" n="26:63"/>of <hi rend="italic">Hervey&#x2019;s Works?</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Hervey (<date when="1714">1714</date>&#x2013;<date when="1758">58</date>), popular devotional writer of <hi rend="italic">Meditations</hi> (<date when="1745">1745</date>&#x2013;<date when="1747">47</date>) and similar compositions, included in some recent edn. such as his <hi rend="italic">Select Works</hi> (<date when="1828">1828</date>).</note> Ascertain, in a private way; for I suppose such a Book c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> easily be got here.

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Any of my German or other Books is always at your service: but unluckily I possess no copy of <hi rend="italic">Herder</hi> nor of <hi rend="italic">Jean Paul</hi>,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Johann Gottfried von Herder (<date when="1744">1744</date>&#x2013;<date when="1803">1803</date>), philosopher and man of letters.

I was lately reading his <hi rend="italic">Cid</hi>,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Der Cid</hi>, trans. Herder (Stuttgart and T&#xfc;bingen, <date when="1838">1838</date>). TC wrote in his Journal, <date when="1851-04-06">6 April</date>: &#x201C;Reading many things about the Cid &#x2026; get acquainted with the <hi rend="italic">Cid;</hi> a famed man,&#x2014;contemporary of William the Conqueror too.&#x2014;&#x201C; He read many books on the subject (see Froude, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi> 4:78) but concluded, &#x201C;I make less of the Cid than I expected;&#x2014;and in fact cannot get any clear face-to-face view of him at all.&#x2014; <hi rend="italic">W</hi>mm <hi rend="italic">Conqueror</hi>, then? <foreign>Eheu!</foreign>&#x2014;&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">El Cid</hi> (<date>12th cent.</date>), a narrative of the achievements of Rodrigo or Ruy Diaz de Vivar (ca. <date when="1043">1043</date>&#x2013;<date when="1099">99</date>), champion of Christianity against the Moors.

<p>If you specially want any volume of <hi rend="italic">Jean Paul</hi> or of <hi rend="italic">Herder</hi>, or indeed almost any common German volume, I believe I could procure you a loan of it from the London Library: but if its merely for general purposes of reading, I had rather you would restrict yourself to my own stock; which, besides <hi rend="italic">Titan</hi>, contains <hi rend="italic">Bouterwek, Eichorn</hi> (dull &#x201C;Literary Histories&#x201C; both);<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Friedrich Bouterwek, <hi rend="italic">Geschichte der Poesie und Beredsamkeit seit dem Ende des dreizehnten Jahrhunderts</hi>, 12 vols.

<p>Your best plan therefore will be to write by return of post, directing Count Reichenbach<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Oskar von Reichenbach, Plattnauer&#x2019;s brother-in-law.</note> what he is to ask for: any one or any quantity of these here mentioned is attainable without difficulty; almost any other Book, of course, <hi rend="italic">can</hi> be attained, tho&#x2019; with more difficulty: if you write at once, there is still time before Lord George;<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lord George A. Hill.</note>&#x2014;and once knowing how to suit you within our limits, we will proceed without loss of time.</p>
<p>Our weather has suddenly brightened up into perfect beauty; and improved the health of very many who were suffering by Influenzas during the bad Spring season. My Wife is tolerably well; and her dog ditto. Last night the Herr Graf and your Sister came over, and we had a very social hour and half with them. Unhappily the Lady cannot speak except in German, of which there is no great stock here for her; but she is very blithe and quick, and the Count has improved greatly in his English and in more important respects, and indeed seems very cheerful for so serious a man, and makes an amiable <pb id="pg-26-65" n="26:65"/>honourable figure to any person that can judge of men. If the Lady had once learned thoroughly to <hi rend="italic">speak</hi>, they might do really altogether well here,&#x2014;or well <hi rend="italic">enough</hi>, which one must be content with in this world.</p>
<p>I am not very busy;&#x2014;unwilling always to be quite idle if I can help it. The &#x201C;Crystal Palace,&#x201C; and the multitude of noisy noodles it is threatening to collect from all quarters, gives me no manner of joy whatever; indeed I am seriously meditating, all days, how I may best escape bodily from it and from all sound of it, as, one way or other, I think I must and shall do. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Das wird vor&#xfc;bergehen; auch Das bleibt nicht ewig</hi></foreign> [That will pass over; even that will not last forever]: thank Heaven!</p>
<p>I shall be glad, meanwhile, if we can fit you in Books.</p>

All my Books of that sort, a whole barrowful of them, were left with one M&#x2019;Kie a Bookseller at Dumfries, when we removed to London;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John M&#x2019;Kie; see <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340319-TC-MAC-01"><sic>7:117</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1834-03-19">19 March 1834</date></corr></ref>.</note> I left them all there; and never could get the colour of money for them, might as well have boiled my kettle with them. Jane&#x2019;s Copy of <hi rend="italic">Lesley</hi>,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably Sir John Leslie, <hi rend="italic">Elements of Geometry</hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1809">1809</date>), <hi rend="italic">Geometrical Analysis</hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1821">1821</date>), vols. 1 and 2 of <hi rend="italic">A Course of Mathematics.</hi></note> too, is lost.</p>
<p>It is a great pity the Boys sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> miss this chance of getting a little Geometry, since you are willing to take charge of them! If the want of a Book is all that hinders, it were better to buy them a Book at once: secondhand <hi rend="italic">Leslies</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Euclids</hi> are probably procurable at Dumfries (I will write today to Jean to try, and to inform you): a new Copy is only some 10 or 12 shillings, and not worth haggling at. Did you look well among the old rubbish of Books at Scotsbrig? Perhaps some Book of Mensuration,&#x2014;some Hamilton&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Arithmetic</hi><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Untraced.</note> (are they perfectly master of that good art?)&#x2014;might turn up there. Poor Boys, a little outfit of culture at present may prove very precious to them in times coming.</p>
<p>We have got drowning weather again; very warm, but all one element of mud. Yesterday I walked round by Putney Heath, in waterproof coat and gutta-percha soles; <hi rend="italic">Nero</hi> came back shrunk to a mere <foreign><hi rend="italic">kimiter</hi></foreign>, and I myself <pb id="pg-26-66" n="26:66"/>was very muddy and weary, but bettered too a little.

<p>I am as you surmise, not very busy here just now; but I still keep poking up and down: some day or other all faithful <hi rend="italic">poking</hi> turns to account,&#x2014;when once one finds the <hi rend="italic">Head of the Spring;</hi>&#x2014;and in the meantime <hi rend="italic">patience</hi> is much to be recommended!

<p>We have had the fiercest easterly cold, then suddenly (till Sunday last) bright summer and all the fruit-tree blossoms out; yesterday again there began a rain, and for 30 hours in a slow briefly intermittent manner, continues still!

<p>We have again bright balmy weather, the rain having gone its ways again; one&#x2019;s thick winter clothing is no longer permissible even within doors. I rejoice much in the notion that you will now get out into the air again, and have a chance for much better health than you can have had of late. I hope you will soon make out your ride to the Gill now; and be the better for it too.&#x2014; Have you anything to read that interests you? Bid John tell me. No such ardent reader ever was more easily contented with Books: in this respect too I have to praise my good old Mother, and be very well content with her. How many <hi rend="italic">sickly</hi> pampered souls do I see to whom no such praise, in any respect, can be awarded!&#x2014;</p>
<p>John Mill has <hi rend="italic">married</hi> the Widow Taylor (you can tell Jack); it was announced in <hi rend="italic">the Times</hi> yesterday!

<p>I want to speak with you, for a few minutes, about a small private matter, partly literary;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-26/lt-18510426-TC-LA-01">TC to <sic>Lady A</sic><corr>LA</corr>, <date when="1851-04-26">26 April</date></ref>.

The sum of long epochs is given to a God, sometimes even to a man: &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">Homer&#x2019;s</hi>&#x2019; Iliad. Can any mortal believe there was such a <hi rend="italic">man</hi> as Homer? Homer is the sum of innumerable men (work this <hi rend="italic">out!</hi>&#x2014;it is worth something?)&#x2014; (How comes it that I cannot take <hi rend="italic">patience</hi> to &#x2018;work things out&#x2019;? That is it!)&#x2014;&#x201C; Then, after a space broken by a long dash, TC writes: &#x201C;The means of exhibiting this of &#x2018;Industrial reg<hi rend="italic">ts</hi>&#x2019; in a state of <hi rend="italic">action?</hi> (That sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be a work worth doing!

<p>Today there came a servant with a Card of yours, indicating two <hi rend="italic">At Homes</hi>, for the coming May month. Who knows if it is not a silent message to me withal, to say silently, under these strange circumstances, Good speed to you, my friend! I will take it as such at any rate; and thank the gods. No news can be had of you: let us have faith and hope, and take this as news. You did well not to write; you do all things well, and are a very clever creature indeed.</p>
<p>On Tuesday I called on the Miss Barings:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Louisa and Emily Baring, Lord Ashburton&#x2019;s sisters.</note> nothing there of tidings from you; &#x201C;gone to Devonshire,&#x201C; they vaguely said. A pleasant quarter of an hour in the bright room; and then a long pleasant walk, all to one&#x2019;s self, in the still brighter Kensington Gardens, walking like Adam under the trees<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Gen. 3:8, &#x201C;in the cool of the day.&#x201C;</note> and the young budding Spring and azure old Eternities,&#x2014;Oh Heaven,&#x2014;avoiding carefully that monstrous Beehive of the Wind-dust-ry of All Nations,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Crystal Palace.</note> and the gaping blockheads that simmer round it!&#x2014; I am going today to consult Bunsen about the possibilities of a run to Denmark for Norse Literature and brisk clear air (while all Nations are <hi rend="italic">here</hi>, and well out of the way): really I mean to hold that in reserve; and feel as if I <hi rend="italic">ought</hi> to execute some feat of that kind. Matters may perhaps grow too hot! Yesterday I admitted an American&#x2014;remembering the &#x201C;18 million&#x201C;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-26/lt-18510117-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1851-01-17">17 Jan.</date></ref></note> with some remorse, and thinking a minute or two w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> do: he proved a Scotch-American, shocking in both characters; noisy, hairy, to a degree; nay at last I discovered stark <hi rend="italic">mad</hi>, upon &#x201C;electricity,&#x201C; biology, and I know not what! Poor soul, really mad, his eyes all <hi rend="italic">blazing</hi> &#x26;c: I got him dextrously bowed out;&#x2014;and in a minute there came in another, rather ugly too, and of the female sex!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Both unidentified.</note> These things ought not to be.</p>
<p>Meantime I have got an excellent solid old Book, Pinkerton&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Scotland;</hi><note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Pinkerton, <hi rend="italic">An Enquiry into the History of Scotland Preceding the Reign of Malcolm III or the Year <date when="1056">1056</date></hi>, 2 vols. (<date when="1789">1789</date>).</note> proving to me, by much real learning and logic, that we have the pleasure, we Lowland Scotch, of being all &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Piks</hi>&#x201C; (Picts) that is Norse <hi rend="italic">Viks</hi> (from <hi rend="italic">Vichia</hi> in Norway) genuine Norsemen the whole of us, and probably as fine a set of men (for natural endowment) as you c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> hope to find anywhere,&#x2014;if we were not such blockheads by education &#x26;c &#x26;c! Really I have got some good of this rugged Pedant of a Pinkerton for several nights back; I read his Book thirty <pb id="pg-26-70" n="26:70"/>years ago, but made nothing of it then, except almost a <hi rend="italic">nightmare;</hi> tho&#x2019; I now see it to be fundamentally <hi rend="italic">true</hi>, and well worth knowing.&#x2014; Understand, therefore, Madam, that if you came here in the year <date when="1066">1066</date> and settled yourself on the sharp mountain, I was here, from the same native place, rather more than 1300 years before; and so we are cousins after all, and happy to meet after such an absence!&#x2014; The <hi rend="italic">truth</hi> of these things (for they are fundamentally a <hi rend="italic">fact</hi>) seems to me to transcend all &#x201C;miracle,&#x201C; as the Jewish and other poor brains have figured it. We are fearfully and wonderfully made;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ps. 139:13.</note> and our destinies and works in this universe are fearful and wonderful. Enough of them, just now.</p>
<p>Do not write; be silent, silent. You can ask me to tea (if you are to be quiet) the ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi> you come back? Announce it if so, and let me try whether I <hi rend="italic">can</hi> come. <foreign>Eheu, eheu!&#x2014;</foreign></p>
<p>John Mill, did you see in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, is wedded to his widow Taylor; a fact in Biography: poor good Mill! He has not announced it to anybody; somebody shewed it to Jane in the <hi rend="italic">Times.</hi> We hear likewise that R<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Milnes is going to be&#x2014;<foreign><hi rend="italic">&#xc0; la bonne heure</hi></foreign> [well and good]:<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Richard Monckton Milnes was to marry Annabella Hungerford Crewe, <date when="1851-07-31">31 July</date>. The Ashburtons congratulated the Mills and evidently invited them to visit, but were promptly rebuffed. Mill wrote to Lord Ashburton, <date when="1851-05-30">30 May</date>, that, though greatly obliged, they were &#x201C;interested only in objects &#x26; pursuits wholly incompatible with any other society than that of a very few other persons of the same tastes &#x26; opinions &#x26; &#x2026; that we are resolved not to visit at all&#x201C; (MS: NLS Acc. 11388).</note> I believe it may be really good. Finally Mrs Alfred Tennyson has <hi rend="italic">not</hi> prospered, poor soul: they say she is herself doing well.<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A boy was born dead, <date when="1851-04-20">20 April</date>, to Emily Tennyson, who for several days was in a critical condition. Alfred Tennyson wrote to John Forster (<date when="1851-04-24">24 April</date>): &#x201C;I am happy to say that she is going on very well &#x2026; . Mrs. Marshall who saw the poor little fellow says he was nobly made &#x2026;; but that perhaps makes it all the sadder. Perhaps if he had been a sickly 7-month spindling, I should have minded it less &#x2026;; and they tell me that if [he] had not been so large a child he would have had a better chance for his life&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Tennyson Letters</hi> 2:16).</note> Heigho!&#x2014;</p>
<p>The Duke of Argyll is proprietor of <hi rend="italic">Iona</hi>, the Isle of St. Colm, who converted us all to Xtianity and Puseyism,<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Douglas Campbell (<date when="1823">1823</date>&#x2013;<date when="1900">1900</date>; <ref target="volume-26/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/4500"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), 8th duke of Argyll, politician.

<salute>Dear Forster,</salute>
<p>Many thanks. You are a courageous man to have read that crabbed Paper from beginning to end, as I see you have done! I would not have undertaken it for a good consideration.</p>
<p>Not one of your criticisms but seems to me to have a clear element of truth in it; I can recognise the fidelity of what you say both in what is favourable and what is adverse. Many thanks for such attention and such friendly candour. Unless I am a fool, I shall attend to every one of these remarks whenever I revise the Paper. That is a fact;&#x2014;and so, you perceive your struggle thro&#x2019; the jungle of pothooks will not be entirely in vain.</p>
<p>My indifference towards this poor <hi rend="italic">Ms.</hi> is, I believe, fully proportionate to its worth; and the question, Print or not print? tends (backed by indolence and a reflex of the Baltic Isles) to resolve itself in the <hi rend="italic">negative.</hi> However, we shall see. Chapman has not yet pronounced; his word, of course, will go for something,&#x2014;so many pounds sterling, that is. The will of Fate be done.</p>
<p>Why don&#x2019;t you come and see us, then? I am here every day, going out to walk about 3 p. m.; almost all ev<hi rend="italic">gs</hi> both of us are here; greedy for the sight of friendly faces and the sound of human news.</p>
<p>A strong rumour circulates to the effect that R. Milnes is about to wed. John Mill it seems has already wedded. Who shall sing these epithalamia?</p>
<closer><salute>Yours ever truly (in haste)</salute></closer>

<p><salute><hi rend="small-caps">Dear Duffy</hi>,&#x2014;</salute>I think your prospectus perfect;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;The Encumbered Estates Act [of <date when="1849">1849</date>] threw a great deal of the land of Ireland into the market at this time at prices unexpectedly low; I thought a national effort ought to be made to enable the occupying tenants to purchase these estates, and I framed a plan of a Small Proprietors&#x2019; Society for this purpose &#x2026; . It is to the prospectus of this society <supplied>[pbd. anon. in the <hi rend="italic">Nation</hi> and later as a pamphlet]</supplied> Carlyle&#x2019;s &#x2026; letter refers&#x201C; (Duffy 171). Henry Taylor and J. S. Mill, to whom Duffy soon sent the pamphlet, approved the proposal; but the Dublin politician and swindler John Sadleir (<sic><date when="1814">1814</date></sic><corr><date when="1813">1813</date></corr>&#x2013;<date when="1856">56</date>; <ref target="volume-26/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/24455"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>) involved himself in the scheme, and Duffy, disapproving his methods, resigned and the scheme failed.</note> it has colour enough left; all you have taken out of it is the angry controversial smoke, whatever could obstruct the clearness, which is here perfect, that of an object seen by sunlight <pb id="pg-26-72" n="26:72"/>under the general azure of the sky. Few things can seem more creditable; certainly nothing at all in any best Irish programme we have lately seen. In reading, I almost feel a kind of desire to invest money in the scheme myself&#x2014;if I had any money worth investing!</p>
<p>At page 22 you speak of draining and improving (to the extent of main drains and roads) the estates you purchase, which, undoubtedly, is very proper so far, before allotting them: but you will have to specify the limits of that a little more, I suppose. The statement at this point of the prospectus startled my attention as a new circumstance; perhaps some warning of it could be introduced about page 10 with advantage? Indeed, I do not quite know about those &#x201C;quarter shares,&#x201C; whether to vote for them or not; nor, in fact, about any detail of the plan is my vote good for much. I used to believe immensely in small farms; and certainly the best people of the labouring class I have ever seen lived in that manner; but there goes much more than a small farm to such a result; and failures enough (in an ever-increasing proportion) have become manifest to me withal. Brief &#x201C;he who is a free man&#x201C; will do rather well in small culture, which is his true position if he is poor; well in small culture or in big; but he who is &#x201C;not free,&#x201C; again, whom nature has made a fool and a slave (<hi rend="italic">i.e., too</hi> foolish and too slavish for his difficult position), he will never do well, unless, perhaps, if well <hi rend="italic">ordered</hi> and compelled; and it is a pity to put any portion of our poor old Mother&#x2019;s surface under the control of such a one, if we could help it. <hi rend="italic">Democracy</hi>, here as elsewhere, I clearly see, is not possible; but, on the other hand, your &#x201C;aristocracy&#x201C;&#x2014;Good Heavens! So you must even do your best according to the day and hour. Surely, by this method, you may hope to push out the finest of your Irish peasantry, these <hi rend="italic">likeliest</hi> to be able to live as &#x201C;free men&#x201C; under our terrible pressures; and for every one of these you can retain within the four seas gods and men will be obliged to you! The others they had better go to America, or even to final chaos, than live as they have long been doing: I deliberately say so. But they are not, I believe, going either of these roads just yet; they are pouring over into Scotland and England (Watt&#x2019;s steam engine is worth a million of O&#x2019;Connells and stump-orator &#x201C;Liberators!&#x201C;),<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Daniel O&#x2019;Connell had been called the &#x201C;Liberator.&#x201C; James Watt (<date when="1736">1736</date>&#x2013;<date when="1819">1819</date>), inventor, patented his steam engine, <date when="1769">1769</date>.</note> and are fast making us all into one uniform mess of pottage, which I cannot but admit is fair to the Three Kingdoms and her sacred Majesty and Co.! Oh, Heaven! one tries to laugh at the things (in this poor epoch), and they are terrible and sacred as the baring of the Lord&#x2019;s right hand upon Iniquity and Quackery and Doggery too long continued.</p>
<p>Did you ever read a small octavo volume, almost 150 years old (London, <pb id="pg-26-73" n="26:73"/><date when="1703">1703</date>, I think), called &#x201C;Fletcher of Saltoun&#x2019;s Works&#x201C;?<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Andrew Fletcher (<date when="1655">1655</date>&#x2013;<date when="1716">1716</date>), Scottish patriot of Saltoun, E Lothian, M.P. for Haddingtonshire, <date when="1678">1678</date>, author of <hi rend="italic">Political Works</hi> (<date when="1732">1732</date>), whose pamphlets and speeches were mainly about Scottish affairs.

<salute>Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>We got the Letter from Alick (which has since fallen aside somewhere, and cannot be found this morning); then the enclosed Note from Jean, telling us about poor Jenny&#x2019;s project;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Janet was to join her husband, Robert Hanning, in Hamilton, Ontario.</note> lastly your Note an hour ago, chiefly on the same subject: so I will write you a word straightway before falling to anything else.</p>
<p>I reckon it very fortunate and very proper that my good Mother reconciles herself to what is evidently the course for Jenny in her present circumstances. My own impression is, it is actually the best thing Jenny can do. She has struck me always of late as extremely unhappy at Dumfries: a poor fettered downpressed life, altogether unsatisfactory to her own mind, and embittered daily and hourly by the thought that she was burdening others to enable her to continue it, moreover. It is also painfully clear how ill Jean and she have got to be together; no doubt a great aggravation to her, and a bad fretting element in Jean&#x2019;s life too.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Late in <date when="1850">1850</date>, when Robert had sent Janet newspapers and asked her to write, Jean had written critically about him: &#x201C;I hope she will take no note of the miserable <foreign>skiddel</foreign> who always comes just when she has made up her mind she has done with him. I was as mad at this as I would have been at having some unclean thing offered to me. He will be remembered in spite of one&#x201C; (MS: NLS 1775B.106).</note> Perhaps Rob, with her to help him, may do better now, with <pb id="pg-26-74" n="26:74"/>so much hard schooling as he has had: who knows? She has a faith in him;&#x2014;and is determined to try. In short, I am very glad my Mother so gallantly reconciles herself to what is necessary: and this point settled, I clearly think all is settled; and we are bound, all of us, to forward Jenny on her pilgrimage, and assist her with whatever help we have. <hi rend="italic">She</hi> (however Rob may go, and were they even to part again) can hardly do <hi rend="italic">less</hi> with her household talents and various industries and virtues in America than she was painfully doing in Dumfries; and the chances are she may do very much more. Let us all help her to go, since such is the road for her.&#x2014; &#x2014; Jean remarks, very indisputably, the ready money she has is far too <hi rend="italic">little.</hi> Do you ascertain what ought to be added to it; and I will cheerfully bear my part in making it up. What the exact expense to N. York (by the second cabin) is? Then, in case Rob sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not be there or have no money, a Letter of credit payable in N. York for some little sum:&#x2014; Judge you what is best and fittest, and tell me.</p>
<p>I have got a really respectable Copy of <hi rend="italic">Hervey</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-26/lt-18510418-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1851-04-18">18 April</date>.</ref></note> for my Mother; I have also without difficulty found your <hi rend="italic">boots:</hi> I design to send them off (Books and boots) today or tomorrow to your Address. I will not <hi rend="italic">prepay</hi> them (since as you will see by Jean we are liable to <foreign>burbles</foreign> by that method); but you will tell me what the Parcel costs, and I will refund it in Stamps. Jane is this day making ready a little package of &#x201C;old gowns&#x201C; &#x26;c for Jenny; which is so bulky, I decide she had better send it straight to Dumfries on its own footing.</p>
<p>We have again most dismally cold weather,&#x2014;except when the sun suddenly bursts out to roast you, if you have on a thick stock of clothes. Most people are getting more or less mad about the Exhibition of <hi rend="italic">Wind</hi>dustry (as a punster calls it). I crossed the S.E. corner of Hyde Park yesterday (to Darwin&#x2019;s and back), you never saw such an ocean-tide of people as was streaming towards that sublime Temple of the Windbags, and boiling far and wide round it! I rushed across the course of it (at Hudson&#x2019;s), and in a second or two was in quiet again. Far enough, on the grand &#x201C;Monday,&#x201C; shall one individual be from the scene of it!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I called on Bunsen the other day; got some Norse hints from him, some vague shadows of Copenhagen &#x26;c, and a glimpse of a certain Secretary called Dr Pauli,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Reinhold Pauli.</note> who is said to be learned in such things, whom I design to send for, according to his wish, as he really seems to be a brisk sensible little fellow. B is very fat, very pursy and flabby; his great eyes, the size of millstones, look very <pb id="pg-26-75" n="26:75"/>strange, besides his small ineffective delicate mouth and his big indolent belly! He is always good and social, however; and that is something: no trace of gall or <hi rend="italic">splenetic</hi> egoism in the much-digesting man. He inquired very kindly for you, as for everybody;&#x2014;declared the Island of Schonen to be the loveliest place in all the world &#x201C;in the month of <date when="--06">June</date>.&#x201C;&#x2014; &#x2014; I bo<hi rend="italic">t</hi> from W<hi rend="italic">ms</hi> &#x26; Norgate<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Foreign booksellers, 14 Henrietta St., Covent Garden.</note> a small neat new Danish Dict<hi rend="italic">y</hi>, done <hi rend="italic">by Repp</hi><note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thorleifus Gudmundssen Repp, presumably his <hi rend="italic">A Danish-English Dictionary</hi> (Copenhagen, <date when="1845">1845</date>).</note> whom you remember. It is not yet come home: I was ordering the <hi rend="italic">Hervey</hi> from Stibbs,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edward Stibbs, bookseller, 331 Strand.</note> and so passing that way.</p>
<p>I wish I knew any other Book to send <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, if you are in need of Books. Pinkerton&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Scotland before <date when="1060">1060</date></hi> has well entertained, and considerably instructed me, for some days past; really a learned solid book (tho&#x2019; sadly ill-written); the <hi rend="italic">best</hi> of the antiquarian genus I have read for years. We (Scotch) are and were all Scandinavians &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Piks</hi>,&#x201C; he says, and the <hi rend="italic">Celts</hi> are nothing or less.</p>
<p>I suppose you have no time for <hi rend="italic">reading</hi>, and really want no Books, or other furnishings except these books? Besides, if it be above 3lb, in two parcels or in one, an equal weight is of the same cost, is it not?&#x2014; <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign> dear Brother. I have written far more than I meant or needed. Give my blessings <supplied>[(]</supplied><note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Parenthesis omitted.</note> if they were good for any thing) to my Mother; and keep her within doors while this cold lasts.

<salute>Dear Jean,</salute>
<p>I got Alick&#x2019;s Letter from Jack, as you suppose; but, by an oversight of Jane&#x2019;s who is usually so perfect a character, it has unluckily fallen aside these two days, and cannot by all our exertion be discovered just at present! Surely I think it will turn up again; and, in that case, you shall directly have it. Or, if the point is <hi rend="italic">important</hi>, tell us so, and we must and will institute a more searching inquiry, and force a rediscovery.&#x2014; It was a very good kind of Letter: a practical world all going on there, better or worse, round poor Alick, and wearing a tolerable aspect,&#x2014;except that, as usual, the proportion of &#x201C;knaves&#x201C; he was beset with seemed a little in excess!&#x2014; Poor fellow, it was an excellent thing <pb id="pg-26-76" n="26:76"/>that he got across thither, and found a shelter for his <foreign><hi rend="italic">bairns</hi></foreign> and self, who w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have had a poor outlook on this side of the water. There, I do hope, the<supplied>[y]</supplied><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> have all a good chance to do well.</p>
<p>Directly after your Note about Jenny, came one from the Doctor, (yesterday morning) to the like effect, inclosing Jenny&#x2019;s own Letter to him,&#x2014;and stating that our Mother had valiantly reconciled herself to the expedition as the best course in actual circumstances. This last fact completes the decision of the business: poor little Jenny will go her way, since she has resolved on it; and nothing is now left us but to further, and help her on, by all the kind offices we can. In truth, tho&#x2019; it makes one sad, I cannot say our poor little sister is not <hi rend="italic">right.</hi> She behaved very well in her difficult circumstances at Dumfries; but was always incurably uncomfortable, and could no<supplied>[t use he]</supplied>r talents and gifts (which are very considerable in domestic affairs and otherwise) to any great account. She may well make <hi rend="italic">more</hi> of her life in America, and is not likely to make less:&#x2014;nay, at the very worst, should all go as ill with her there as <hi rend="italic">can</hi> be apprehend, she can <hi rend="italic">return</hi>, and resume her old post here; anything that depends on me towards that is a <hi rend="italic">constant</hi> quantity for her, while I continue.&#x2014; &#x2014; I have written to Jack to this effect; and requested him to examine practically what can be done to help her, and to let us in the best way do it. The sum sent, &#x201C;&#xa3;16,&#x201C; is evidently as you say, altogether inadequate for a comfortable passage to N. York: and if she were to arrive at N. York, and find things <hi rend="italic">wrong</hi> there! Jack must take measures to rectify all that.</p>
<p>Yesterday Jane sent off, by rail to your care, a Parcel (containing some <hi rend="italic">cloth</hi> etceteras, I think): you are to pay it, and mark the charge down to me;&#x2014;I know not whether Jane <supplied>[wrote]</supplied> to you about it; but that is the special reason of my writing today. Give my brotherly love to poor Jenny; and say I do not in the least disapprove this step she is taking, and am and continue always the same to her. I will write to herself the first day I have leisure: she, if she want anything, can of course at any time write to me.</p>
<p>The &#x201C;velvet&#x201C; &#x26;c in the frame of the Medallion pleases Jane&#x2019;s taste very much; only she seems to <foreign><hi rend="italic">scunner</hi></foreign> a little at the encompasment of <hi rend="italic">gilding</hi>, or gilt stucco-work,&#x2014;fears, I suppose, that the gilding may be <hi rend="italic">too</hi> glorious, and degenerate into the <hi rend="italic">gingerbread</hi> style! Of which I trust there is no danger at all;&#x2014;only you may as well keep it in your eye, too.</p>
<p>Today I am to go riding; I have the offer of a ride,&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">coming</hi> in not many minutes; and my poor nerves, a little fluttery at the prospect, may perhaps be improved by it! <closer><salute>I can say nothing more at present; but rest (with kind love to you all)&#x2014;Your affectionate,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Jenny</salute>
<p>I sent off yesterday, by Railway, to Jane&#x2019;s care, a bundle of things which I hope may be of some use to you in your preparations for departure&#x2014; They are not much worth as they are; but you have a great talent&#x2014;at least you had when I knew you&#x2014;for making silk purses out of sows ears&#x2014;a very valuable talent in this world&#x2014;</p>
<p>For the rest; what can I say to you but that I wish you good speed in your great adventure and that it may turn out even better for you than you hope!&#x2014; Decidedly it is an adventure in which you ought to be let please yourself&#x2014;to be let follow the guidance of your own heart without remonstrance or criticism of others&#x2014; It is my fixed opinion that between man and wife no third person <hi rend="italic">can</hi> judge&#x2014;and that all any of us could reasonably require of <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, is that you should consider well what you are about to do and that you should do nothing from <hi rend="italic">secondary motives.</hi> If it be affection for your husband, and the idea of doing your duty by him that takes you from your family and friends, so far away&#x2014;then go in Gods name, and may your Husband prove himself worthy of so much constancy. In any case you will have no cause for self reproach&#x2014; But if it be impatience of your position here that is driving you away&#x2014;from your kind old Mother and all the rest who love you so well&#x2014;then God help you my poor Jenny for you are flinging away all the real blessings of your lot for an imagination of <hi rend="italic">independence</hi>&#x2014;</p>
<p>I hope however you are quite justified by your feelings towards your Husband in leaving all to follow him&#x2014; You have always seemed to me to cherish a most loyal affection for your Husband, and I will never believe, however appearances may be against him, that a man can inspire such an affection in the Wife he has lived years beside, and yet be wholly unworthy of it, <closer><salute>So farewell dear Jenny and God go with you affectionately yours</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Today I send the <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine;</hi> which, as soon as my Mother and you have quite done with it, you can forward to Dumfries, as formerly. The Paper on <hi rend="italic">Charles Fifth&#x2019;s Cloister Life</hi> (of which I did not read or notice the First Part) is by W<hi rend="italic">m</hi> Stirling;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;The Cloister-Life of the Emperor Charles V,&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s</hi> 43 (<date when="1851">1851</date>):367&#x2013;80; 528&#x2013;45.</note> and has some real merit as a bit of History <foreign>&#xE0; la</foreign> Prescott.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Hickling Prescott.</note> I have not yet seen Stirling, tho&#x2019; he is said to be here for some time past, and I even think I one day left a card for him. Poor fellow, he is &#x201C;surrounded by a friend or two,&#x201C;&#x2014;by no means of the most fruitful species! &#x201C;Old Ford,&#x201C; I hear, is just about being married, to a sister of Sir W. Molesworth&#x2019;s; his Ford&#x2019;s Daughter too is simultaneously wedding, I forget with whom.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The writer and critic Richard Ford, m. 3dly, <date when="1851-06-12">12 June</date>, Mary, only da. of Sir Arscott Ourry Molesworth, 7th bart., and sister of Sir William Molesworth. His da. and her marriage are untraced.</note> An idle dining dilettante-ing Clanjamphray, one and all of them.</p>
<p>What you did in regard to Jenny is altogether the right thing, so far as I can judge. If she get into a right ship, of which there is the best chance from the counsel accessible to her, she has the flower of the year for weather, and may hope to make the voyage under the favourablest circumstances: after which the issue must depend on her own omens and her own wisdom and behaviour, no friend can much help her farther in essential respects. I have a notion that she will do better there, and not worse, than she has done here; and that probably bother<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS for &#x201C;better.&#x201C;</note> her Partner and herself, not to speak of the poor little children whose outlooks are not good on this side of the water, may have better days than they knew heretofore when experience had less taught them. Poor little Jenny, it must be admitted, has gone thro&#x2019; her hard trial creditably and nobody can cast a stone at her for anything she has done in her difficult circumstances.&#x2014; What you arrange about the money seems very good; and I will send you a Draught for my half of it, so soon as the account is clear. I will write to Jenny also before long. You did not tell me what the Book-Parcel cost? That also is my debt.</p>
<p>Printer Robson has got the first leaves of Sterling&#x2019;s Life; these were in such a confusion that I could not handily read or revise them: I suppose the Bookling had better be printed and off my hand, tho&#x2019; it is good for almost nothing. Chapman is willing; Fuz also has read, and pronounced to be readable:&#x2014;have <hi rend="italic">done</hi> with it!&#x2014; &#x2014; I have lately resumed my Danish; am strong <pb id="pg-26-79" n="26:79"/>bent on getting the Scandinavian, Norman &#x26;c part of my affairs set in order. I saw Bunsen, one day, who has now <hi rend="italic">lost</hi> all his Norse Books; he lent me a little thing of Grimm&#x2019;s,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Either of the brothers Jakob (<date when="1785">1785</date>&#x2013;<date when="1863">1863</date>) or Wilhelm (<date when="1786">1786</date>&#x2013;<date when="1859">1859</date>) Grimm, philologists.</note> and was very kind. Full of windy admiration for the ignorant present, as usual withal. A certain Secretary of his, one Dr Pauli, came to me by invitat<hi rend="italic">n</hi> some nights after; an intelligent laborious young man, but not deeper in Norse than myself, I find. Did not you once possess an Iceland <hi rend="italic">Reading Book;</hi> kind of recent &#x201C;Collection&#x201C; for the use of learners? If so I will spend a shilling in having it carried up to me again.&#x2014; Item a Reading Book of Anglosaxon? Your Dict<hi rend="italic">y</hi> of that is here. Our Dr Pauli really knows something of Anglosaxon; and I w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> take a lesson or two from him by some opportunity.</p>
<p>Our industrial Exhibition gathered 750,000 human souls round it last thursday;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1851-05-01">1 May</date>, the official opening, in the presence of the Queen and the prince consort. The <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, <date when="1851-05-02">2 May</date>, found it &#x201C;a sight the like of which has never happened before and which in the nature of things can never be repeated.&#x201C; About 25,000 people, all season-ticket holders, packed the aisles and galleries of the Crystal Palace, and thousands more lined the royal route from Buckingham Palace. Queen Victoria wrote in her journal, <date when="1851-05-01">1 May</date>: &#x201C;The Park presented a wonderful spectacle, crowds streaming through it&#x2014;carriages and troops passing, quite like the Coronation Day [<date when="1838-06-28">28 June 1838</date>], and for me, the same anxiety. &#x2026; At &#xBD; p. 11, the whole procession in 9 state carriages was set in motion. &#x2026; The Green Park and Hyde Park were one mass of densely crowded human beings &#x2026; . The glimpse through the iron gates of the Transept, the moving palms and flowers, the myriads of people filling the galleries and seats around, together with the flourish of trumpets, as we entered the building, gave a sensation I shall never forget &#x2026; . The sight as we came to the centre where the steps and chair &#x2026; was placed, facing the beautiful crystal fountain was magic and impressive. The tremendous cheering, the joy expressed in every face, the vastness of the building, with all its decorations and exhibits, the sound of the organ (with 200 instruments and 600 voices, which seemed nothing), and my beloved Husband the creator of this great &#x2018;Peace Festival,&#x2019; uniting the industry and art of all nations of the earth, all this, was indeed moving, and a day to live forever. God bless my dearest Albert, and my dear Country which has shown itself so great today&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Queen Victoria in Her Letters and Journals</hi>, selected by Christopher Hibbert [Harmondsworth, <date when="1985">1985</date>] 84). There were more than 100,000 exhibits by 13,937 exhibitors, 7,381 from the British Isles and Empire and 6,556 from foreign countries.</note> Jane and I sallied into the City, where all business too was at a stand. I have fine solitary roads on the Surrey Side; all the Blockheadism being gathered to the &#x201C;Glass Palace&#x201C; so-called. Three times I have been out riding, on a certain mare wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> A. Sterling has now on sale; I am again going today: an excell<hi rend="italic">t</hi> quiet swift creature. The weather is terribly cold; with frequent falls of sleet and even of hail.

<salute>Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>In my last Note I spoke of an <hi rend="italic">Icelandic Reading Book</hi>, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> if you have it about you you are perhaps preparing to send. I write half a word about it today, in very great haste.&#x2014; I was yesterday at Williams &#x26; Norgate&#x2019;s; and found they had (attainable to me for 6/) a Book of that kind by one <hi rend="italic">Dietrich</hi>,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Franz Eduard Christoph Dietrich, <hi rend="italic">Altnordisches Lesebuch</hi> (Leipzig, <date when="1843">1843</date>).</note> which has the great advantage of a small grammar and vocabulary (sufficient for itself, one may hope) at the end. Perhaps it is the same Book, a new edition of the same, as the one I asked you about. I did not buy it yesterday; but decided to use a penny-stamp in apprising you of its attainability; and to say that if you even have the Book, and if the Book have <hi rend="italic">not</hi> this said grammar and vocabulary, then you are not to mind it farther at all; I will get Dietrich&#x2019;s (no <hi rend="italic">Dictionary</hi> of Icelandic, or no tolerable one, is to be had as yet), and Dietrich in the meanwhile will be a decidedly better investment. So much for that affair. Perhaps you have not the Book at all, and cannot guess what Book I have been meaning: in that case the affair will still more readily vanish from your field of meditations!&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>We are just going out to the Exhibition (sorrow on it!), Jane and I having got a ticket from Fuz.&#x2014; How is my Mother, good Mother! Our weather is greatly improved within these two days. More very soon. <closer><salute>With love to all, Yours</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dearest Babbie</salute>
<p>When I got your last note, I meant to answer it by the next post, but what I <hi rend="italic">mean</hi> to do is precisely the <hi rend="italic">last</hi> thing I get done, any thing, every thing rather than <hi rend="italic">that!</hi> Of course the fault is in myself and not in my &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">contrairy</hi>&#x2019; circumstances&#x2014;if I could rid myself of the weak notion that I am too bothered or too wearied out, for doing this or that for <hi rend="italic">writing to you</hi>, for instance; there is no such pressure of bother on me that I might not write you at least a dozen lines every day of my life, but <hi rend="italic">believe</hi> that you haven&#x2019;t time nor strength and you havn&#x2019;t them, tho&#x2019;, for the rest you may be all the while yawning over the fire, and up to walking ten miles were the temptation great enough.</p>
<p>Dont suppose, like a dear Babbie as you are and will always be for me, that there is any thing more in these long silences than a defective condition of my <hi rend="italic">volition</hi>, the result in great measure of general ill health I am sure; for long ago, whatever thing I had in my mind to do, I <hi rend="italic">did</hi> and the more hindrances, the more haste&#x2014;and latterly there has been too a <hi rend="italic">complication</hi> in our correspondence rendering my letters to <hi rend="italic">you</hi> individually, a <foreign><hi rend="italic">pro bono publico</hi></foreign> [for the public good] affair, a sort of letters which I have no skill in writing, and <hi rend="italic">less than no</hi> liking to write&#x2014; If I was to be always keeping Helen in view in my letters&#x2014;better, certainly <hi rend="italic">easier</hi> it was, to write direct to herself&#x2014;and so at the same time show her the little attention which is the privilege of invalids. Do <hi rend="italic">you</hi> write to <hi rend="italic">me</hi> as formerly!&#x2014;there is no invalid <hi rend="italic">here</hi> keeping a sharp look out on all the letters that come to the house, and feeling aggrieved if they be not imparted to her; and yet&#x2014;what do you tell me but small nonsense that you evidently fall half asleep over while you are writing them&#x2014;for example you <hi rend="italic">had</hi> to tell me in your last letter that Andrew<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Chrystal, of Glasgow, whom she was to marry, <date when="1853">1853</date>.</note> had been a fortnight with you in Liverpool&#x2014;and a good deal besides I should think&#x2014;and what <hi rend="italic">did</hi> you tell me? Oh Babbie! how I wish it had not been your idea to pitch your tent in the &#x201C;valley of the shadow of <hi rend="italic">marriage</hi>&#x201C;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Ps. 23:4.</note>&#x2014;it is a very <hi rend="italic">relaxing air</hi> I am sure and <pb id="pg-26-82" n="26:82"/>peculiarly unsuitable to <hi rend="italic">your</hi> constitution&#x2014; But certainly <hi rend="small-caps">i</hi> am not the best authorized person to tell people how they should manage their lives under that head of method having made such a mess of my own life&#x2014;God help me!</p>
<p>If you have heard from Liverpool in these days they would perhaps tell you that I am scheming to have Helen up for a week or two to see this eternal &#x201C;Exhibition&#x201C; If M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C had only carried out his project of going off to Copenhagen the beginning of May, great things might have come off&#x2014;in which <hi rend="italic">you</hi> might have taken some part&#x2014;but instead of what I had set my heart on I find myself more tied up even than usual&#x2014; M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C <hi rend="italic">here, correcting proofs</hi> with no more tendency towards Denmark for the present&#x2014;and oh horror! the old story of a change of servants to be gone over again the week after next! (I need not go into the peculiarity of the <hi rend="italic">present</hi> servant&#x2014;enough that if I had not the prospect of soon getting rid of her, she would fret me into a fit of phrenzy in which I should commit either suicide or murder&#x2014;at the same time she is a well tempered well <hi rend="italic">disposed</hi> girl!&#x2014;and I could not turn her out without due warning&#x2014; I have an elderly <hi rend="italic">widow</hi> coming this time&#x2014;whom I took to at first sight from a sort of look she has of our old Betty&#x2014; I must wait till I see whether <hi rend="italic">she</hi> can keep the house over our heads before I fix about bringing Helen, tolerant as I found her on a former memorable occasion,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In <date when="1846-11">Nov.</date>&#x2013;<date when="1846-12">Dec. 1846</date>; see <ref target="volume-21/lt-18470205-JWC-HW-01"><sic>21:154</sic><corr>JWC to HW, <date when="1847-02-05">5 Feb. 1847</date></corr></ref>.</note> into it&#x2014;) I was not purposing to go near the Exhibition myself till I took <hi rend="italic">her</hi> or someone to see it&#x2014;I had not so much as gone to view the outside since it was roofed in&#x2014; But the other day Forster offered us his Examiner-ticket which admitted both M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C and <hi rend="italic">a Lady</hi>&#x2014;so we went and oh how&#x2014;tired I was!&#x2014; Not that it is not really a very beautiful sight&#x2014;especially at the entrance; the three large trees, <hi rend="italic">built in, because the people objected to their being cut down</hi>, a crystal fountain, and a large blue canopy give one a momentary impression of a Bazzar in the <hi rend="italic">Arabian Nights Entertainments</hi>&#x2014;and such a lot of things of different kinds and of well<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The MS ends here; the rest of the letter is taken from Huxley.</note> dressed people&#x2014;for the tickets were still 5/<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A day ticket, <date when="1851-05-05">5</date>&#x2013;<date when="1851-05-24">24 May</date>, was 5s.

The big diamond indeed&#x2014;worth a <hi rend="italic">million! that</hi> one could not have seen at any jeweller&#x2019;s&#x2014;but oh Babbie what a disappointment! for the big diamond&#x2014;unset&#x2014;looked precisely like a bit of crystal the size and shape of the first joint of your thumb!<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Koh-i-Noor, a 109-carat diamond, added to the crown jewels on the annexation of the Punjab, <date when="1849">1849</date>, was displayed in a gilded birdcage for the sake of security. Though the most valuable single exhibit, it was generally a disappointment, because ill-lit; but it was soon redisplayed, against black velvet and lit by gas.</note> And the fatigue of even the most cursory survey was indescribable and to tell you the God&#x2019;s truth I would not have given the <pb id="pg-26-83" n="26:83"/>pleasure of reading a good Fairy Tale for all the pleasure to be got from that &#x201C;Fairy Scene&#x201C;! I have surely a great many things to tell you <hi rend="italic">not</hi> about the <hi rend="italic">Exhibition</hi>&#x2014;but I have only a horrid steel pen and my paper appears to be scarce.</p>

<p>If you will come to us, to tea, on Monday night (the old hour) I have good hopes of producing Mr. Ruskin for you. Unluckily, however, it is not quite positive. Mr. R. is out of town and not absolutely certain to be back before Monday; but my Wife will write to you early that day if things turn in the negative, so if you hear nothing farther, come along: If you do hear, I expect it will be the proposal of some new evening for the object in question. The Medallion is favourably hung up; and excites the approbation of a discerning public&#x2014;as it deserves to do.</p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>There is another of those Medallions wanted; and I am to negociate with you for the person interested.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-26-85" n="26:85"/>First the Medallion itself; then I will request you to get it framed, just as ours here is; next to have it packed safely in a little box, and sent to the Euston-square Railway with the address &#x201C;Mrs Aitken, Assembly Street, Dumfries, N.B&#x201C; (by &#x201C;Goods Train&#x201C;),&#x2014;paying the Carriage: after which, if you will please to send me the <hi rend="italic">Account</hi>, the affair will be finished forthwith. I am a little ashamed to trouble you with all these details beyond your own part of the business; but I am not sure of getting them so effectually done by any other method,&#x2014;not to say that it is far the <hi rend="italic">easiest</hi> for me, and that you are very obliging. Pray have the thing managed (<hi rend="italic">Account</hi> and all), as soon as possible.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Woolner sent an account, <date when="1851-06-27">27 June</date>, saying: &#x201C;I have sent off the Cast for M<hi rend="italic">rs.</hi> Aitken and am heartily sorry it should have been so long in hand: the frame-man has a strange facility in breaking his word &#x2026; but he promised very violently in the last instance that I was fain to promise you on the strength of it: he makes them better than anyone else, and knows it&#x2014;therefore becomes a tyrant. / Miss Blanche Stanley would not wait to have her Cast put in a frame, but wrote me to send it in a primitive state as she wanted it to match Tennyson&#x2019;s head.&#x201C; The account came to 18s. 2d., for the frame for Jean Aitken and sending it as far as Carlisle. &#x201C;Give my kind respect to M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle&#x2014;and pray don&#x2019;t be angry because I was so long sending off the head, as it was not my fault&#x2014;.&#x201C;</note></p>
<p>I am anxious Mrs Aitken should have a good Copy; for she knows the Original well;&#x2014;and has seen the Copy already sent into that part of the world.</p>
<p>I hope you have seen Ruskin again, and are getting on handsomely. Let us see you again soon.</p>

<salute>My dear Jean,</salute>
<p>I am kept terribly busy at this time; printing that volume on <hi rend="italic">John Sterling</hi>, which needs a great deal of <foreign><hi rend="italic">fiking</hi></foreign> and revising before the Printers get it and also after. Besides I vehemently urge speed upon them; being impatient to have it done. They are not yet quite clear of a <hi rend="italic">third</hi> of it; and it will be six weeks or so (I fear, the lazy dogs) before they let me altogether out of it. I send a snip of one of the pages,&#x2014;out of the Waste-basket. It will be a readable enough little thing, a thing also which I was bound to write; and otherwise it will be good for next to nothing whatever.</p>
<p>I have written off to little Woolner (T. Woolner, Esq, 101. Stanhope Street, Mornington Crescent, Hampstead Road), the Sculptor of that <hi rend="italic">Medallion;</hi> who is to send you a Copy <hi rend="italic">framed</hi> (a facsimile of one we have here): he will <pb id="pg-26-86" n="26:86"/>send it by railway, so soon as ready; and I will settle his bit account for him, poor fellow,&#x2014;intending to make you a present of this wonderful article! It really seems to me, and to some surer judges; a rather clever thing,&#x2014;as certainly the little sculptor himself: a very good young fellow, who we hope will come into notice yet.&#x2014; Do not be impatient, if he delay a little; for he seems to be rather slow in such operations: you shall get notice so soon as the thing is on the road.</p>
<p>Poor Jenny, she has left us now; and all her sufferings and confusions on this side of the water are winded up,&#x2014;to open, in a new chapter, we know not how, beyond seas far away! I was very glad to hear our Mother took it so bravely: it was clear there was no other course for poor Jenny.</p>
<p>We have charming mild Summer weather here,&#x2014;and <hi rend="italic">grey</hi> enough, which is always my prayer: for example, today at 2 p.m., I am actually writing by <hi rend="italic">candle-light</hi>,&#x2014;the &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">dag</hi> of rain&#x201C; is so dark otherwise! Sunday was a high wind: I went far into the solitary country; all was one huge <hi rend="italic">sough</hi> of waving trees and verdure under the kind bright sky,&#x2014;very beautiful and very solemn to me, as I sat looking into it over a lonely cigar.&#x2014;&#x2014; I have been in the Crystal Palace; went with Jane weeks ago once, somebody having sent us tickets.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-26/lt-18510508-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1851-05-08">8 May</date>.</ref></note> It is the beautifullest <hi rend="italic">House</hi>, I fancy, that ever was built in the world. There are three huge trees (English elms, all in leaf in the middle of it<supplied>[)]</supplied>;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The arched transept covered them, two in the north and one in the south.

To have looked at it as <hi rend="italic">sense</hi>, or tried to learn or study anything in such a scene w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have driven me mad: but as <hi rend="italic">nonsense</hi>, I pronounced it to be superlatively well got up; and looked at it for a couple of hours, as the gravest Man may do at a Children&#x2019;s Ball, or other bright Tomfoolery, with a transient satisfaction,&#x2014;glad, that <hi rend="italic">I</hi> had no hand whatever in it!&#x2014; &#x2014; The sky is getting clearer again; and my hour for walking has come. Poor Jane has got a <hi rend="italic">stiff-neck</hi> by the damp, and is decidedly out of order today. Her cousin Helen is expected tomorrow from Liverpool:&#x2014;we have a very good servant, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is useful in that case.

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I think it is rather a longish while since I have written to you yourself, tho&#x2019; I have got various Notes from the Doctor, and two lately which are still to be answered. I am held terribly busy, or what is worse, terribly interrupted in my little business; and hardly ever write the scrape of a pen to anybody if I can possibly get off. But you are not like &#x201C;anybody&#x201C; to me; not you, my good dear Mother! Before going out today,&#x2014;the Printers having left me a little elbow-room,&#x2014;I will scribble you a small line, with such no-news as we have here.</p>
<p>Summer has come upon us; and the weather is very pleasant, tho&#x2019; rough and damp. I like the <hi rend="italic">grey</hi> summer weather here beyond all kinds; but at present certainly the grey is sometimes in excess: yesterday for instance, writing a Note to Jean about this same hour (2 p.m.), I had actually to get <hi rend="italic">up</hi> candles, so thick was the wet dark draggle that hung over everything! Today is brisk and bright as possible; fine cool clear summer-air, with the wet clouds floating about amid sunshine, and <hi rend="italic">not</hi> sending down any fall.&#x2014; Miss Welsh is expected from Liverpool, I think this very day: she is to stay till the end of the month; and may see her fill of the &#x201C;Glass Palace&#x201C; and other loud nonsense that we have. I was in that thing (as I told Jack I was just going) some time ago: a very <foreign><hi rend="italic">braw</hi></foreign> place indeed; the finest <hi rend="italic">house</hi> ever seen in the world,&#x2014;with three huge growing <hi rend="italic">trees</hi>, with fountains &#x26;c &#x26;c, in the inside of it,&#x2014;only unhappily there was no <hi rend="italic">result</hi> visible to any rational eye in the whole of it; with Sandy Corrie one asked bitterly, &#x201C;What&#x2019;s ta use on&#x2019;t?&#x201C; An endless crowd simmers continually about it,&#x2014;ever-flowing streams of cabs, and noisy rabble confusing all the neighbourhood:&#x2014;you may tell Jack, I yesterday, in my wet walk, found Craik&#x2019;s old house, converted into a house of entertain<hi rend="italic">t</hi> for Glass-palace-itself, a flag flying from the top of it, a big tent at the side of it, a list of prices for porter, sodawater &#x26;c; and the whole conspicuously labelled &#x201C;Cromwell&#x2019;s retreat,&#x201C;&#x2014;the place where <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> could retire to after his hard labours!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Craik had lived, till <date when="1849">1849</date>, at Vine Cottage, Cromwell Lane, Old Brompton. TC still continued to receive information about Cromwell and his letters. Thomas Frewen, with whom he had previously corresponded, wrote to TC from Cold Overton Hall, Oakham, <date when="1851-06-11">11 June</date>, telling of a Cromwell letter of <date when="1649-02-09">9 Feb. 1649</date>&#x2013;50 addressed to Col. Phaire, gov. of Cork, lately in the possession of &#x201C;Mrs. Tryon of Stamford&#x201C; and printed in the <hi rend="italic">Gentleman&#x2019;s Magazine</hi>, <date when="1843-03">March 1843</date>. See <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 9:257&#x2013;58, citing the <hi rend="italic">Gentleman&#x2019;s Magazine.</hi> Amalie B&#xF6;lte wrote to Varnhagen, <date when="1851-06-11">11 June</date>, that TC was less benign, very &#x201C;sauvage,&#x201C; and with no sympathy for political refugees such perhaps as Karl Marx and Ferdinand Freiligrath (see <ref target="volume-21/lt-18470529-TC-JCH-01"><sic>21:221</sic><corr>TC to JCH, <date when="1847-05-29">29 May 1847</date></corr></ref>), whom she was currently entertaining (<hi rend="italic">B&#xF6;ltes Briefe</hi> 90).</note> I <pb id="pg-26-88" n="26:88"/>have laughed <hi rend="italic">internally</hi> ever since; but was too <foreign><hi rend="italic">glarry</hi></foreign> and angry to laugh much aloud.&#x2014; Our comfort is, the whole thing will go clean about its business in a certain length of time; and vanish utterly like a bag of wind, and leave us and the ground quite clear of it. Patience, a little patience!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Jane has got a <hi rend="italic">stiff neck</hi> out of this damp; troublesome a good deal to her for two days past; but now it is mainly gone. I too feel a twinge of rheumatism in one of my shoulders this morning; but count on <hi rend="italic">walking</hi> it out so soon as I am on my feet. &#x201C;Nero&#x201C; was again stolen from us,&#x2014;stolen at the end of this street, almost under our very nose, one evening! The Postman after some negociation brought him home on the third day, stuck in his leather bag, with only the head out. He is to be kept <hi rend="italic">constantly</hi> within doors now, and to do what tumbling he can in the garden. My own decided counsel is, to <hi rend="italic">give him away</hi> to some good hand;&#x2014;but he seems to afford so much amusement here, and is so immensely &#x201C;loved,&#x201C; I cannot insist on that view of the case just yet. We have at length got a very good Servant, after several not successful trials: this is a quiet <hi rend="italic">widow</hi>, about forty, a woman countryfied, decent, diligent, and expert at her business, who seems to have no wish beyond getting lived in quietness after honestly doing her work. She is a considerable acquisition to us.&#x2014; &#x2014; My Printers are very irregular; not <hi rend="italic">third</hi> part done yet: the book will be readable enough; but otherwise good for almost nothing. It needed to be off my hands. I send you a small snip of one of the leaves: I hope the whole may be ready in about 2 months.</p>
<p>Poor Jenny is getting the best of the season for her voyage across the sea: I often think of her;&#x2014;I trust we shall, in due time, hear that she has got well to land,&#x2014;as, by Heaven&#x2019;s goodness, we have done of so many voyages we were interested in! It was a great relief to me that you, dear brave old Mother, took it so well, so like yourself. There can no doubt but it was right and proper she should be forwarded on her way, since it was so clearly an inevitable one for her. She has never had one hour of wholesome life on the late terms; and would never have had. We will hope it will all turn to a good issue for the brave little woman: indeed the execution of a purpose like that is itself a great blessing for a human creature. It is possible she may do both Rob and herself a great deal of good by it;&#x2014;to do <hi rend="italic">herself</hi> good, I should say, she can hardly fail by such a resolution and achievement.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jenny wrote to her mother from Hamilton, <date when="1851-07-23">23 July</date>, after a voyage of seven weeks to Montreal. At Hamilton wharf &#x201C;I soon got my eye on the well known face of my Husband &#x2026; . [I]n about ten or fifteen minutes we were in our own house &#x2026; . [I]t consists of three apartments a kitchen parlour and bedroom and a back kitchen.&#x201C; They quickly received invitations. The minister and his wife were Scottish. &#x201C;Robert seems to be well known here and very much respected &#x2026; he had the offer of another situation and sixty pounds a year &#x2026; . Mr Browne said he would be willing to give the same &#x2026; we get our firewood. &#x2026; Robert is often up in the Town and brings us whatever we want &#x2026; and seems to be anxious to make us as happy as he can.&#x201C; He was a kind of servant to Mr. Brown, looking after the horses and hiring and dismissing all the men &#x201C;if they do not give satisfaction.&#x201C; He sent his thanks for a Bible from Jenny&#x2019;s mother; &#x201C;he is very proud of it.&#x201C;</note></p>
<p><pb id="pg-26-89" n="26:89"/>Will you tell the Doctor now to send me up some statement of the money account between us; that I may settle with him, when a leisure moment comes.&#x2014; Did you get the <hi rend="italic">Medallion</hi> yet from Dumfries? Jean writes to me that it is done, but not whether it is sent. She has also ordered another for herself here,&#x2014;or I have for her,&#x2014;which is to be framed here. If the Doctor were at Dumfries (or if any of you for him were), he might pay Jean the trifle I owe her, and include it in his account? But tell him never to mind: surely it is easy enough <hi rend="italic">otherwise</hi> too, when I reflect!</p>
<p>Jamie&#x2019;s Newspaper has not come this week yet. I got the <hi rend="italic">Leader</hi> again, as you said; not that I liked it better, but that I liked the others worse!

They are a sad caudle of nonsense one and all of them.</p>
<p>You get out now, don&#x2019;t you; and find it do you good while the weather is bright? I hope you did make out Cressfield as well as Newfield: a little <foreign><hi rend="italic">outrake</hi></foreign> is very beneficial when the weather serves.&#x2014; People are busy mowing here; I get a fine smell of hay sometimes when out riding. The crop <hi rend="italic">light</hi>, I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> say. Jamie will be on too, by and by. Give my love to him and Isabella.

<salute>Dear Jean,</salute>
<p>I quite forgot, last time, to ask you precisely what it was that the <hi rend="italic">Medallion</hi> for my Mother, first and last, had cost you. I remember only the 3/6 or some such sum which you paid for the carriage. Pray tell me, <hi rend="italic">at once</hi>, what the exact amount of the whole was: I say, at once, because I am at any rate sending the Doctor some money, and if I knew your account I could club the whole together. It seems you are just going over to Scotsbrig: if there is still time for me to answer you at Dumfries before you go, I will commission you to get both Jack&#x2019;s money and your own out of the Bank for me, and so save trouble: if there is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> time now (as I rather fear), then pray instruct Jack to pay you for me, and do you immediately send me the note of what it <hi rend="italic">is</hi>, and I will then direct a cheque to <hi rend="italic">him</hi> for the whole, both his and yours. Now pray <pb id="pg-26-90" n="26:90"/>do not neglect this: it will do the business with the <hi rend="italic">minimum</hi> of trouble,&#x2014;which is the right way of doing all kinds of business.</p>
<p>Our little sculptor was here the other night, and promises to have <hi rend="italic">your</hi> medallion on the road before this week end: I will send you due notice of the day.&#x2014;&#x2014; I am kept very busy with my Printers; have bother enough otherwise; and need to swim lustily in order to make any way at all. Helen Welsh is here, doing well enough. Our weather is very blustery and damp-grey; a kind of weather I do not object to at this season. I will write to Jack or my Mother, enclosing Alick&#x2019;s Letter. <closer><salute>Kind regards to James.&#x2014; Ever yours</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Owen,</salute>
<p>I find record, among John Sterling&#x2019;s letters, of his having met you in various places about Falmouth (and liked you very well), in something wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> he calls a &#x201C;Polytechnic Meeting&#x201C; held thereabouts in the Autumn of <date when="1841">1841</date>. I am printing a <hi rend="italic">Life</hi> of poor Sterling at present, and busy riddling out any fraction of memorability from these details. The Falmouth rencounter I myself may well keep in mind; for I think it is to it that I owe my first acquaintance with you.&#x2014; But I do not well know what this &#x201C;Polytechnic Meeting&#x201C; is, or was;&#x2014;or how distinguished from the &#x201C;British Association,&#x201C; with wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> it seems by no means identical.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Owen replied, <date when="1851-06-18">18 June</date>, giving information TC used in his <hi rend="italic">Life of Sterling</hi> (see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 11:212): &#x201C;The <hi rend="italic">RI Cornwall Polytechnic Society</hi> was established at Falmouth in <date when="1832">1832</date> to diffuse a knowledge of Science &#x26; Art amongst the inhabitants of that Town and Neighbourhood: it&#x2019;s aims are promoted by a Museum and Library, and by annual exhibitions of art &#x26; science, at which prizes are awarded &#x26; Reports read: it is supported by annual subscriptions from the gentlry of the Town and Neighbourhood, Sir <hi rend="italic">Ch. Lemon</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Foxes</hi> being the main-stays of the Institutions.&#x201C; Owen and Sterling agreed to speak to it in <date when="1841">1841</date>: &#x201C;He held forth (right eloquently &#x26; truly) on Art, and I on extinct beasts, and there I made a friendship which seemed to have been a very old one when I had, shortly afterwards, to deplore the severing of it by the demise of our true-hearted friend. Mrs. Owen &#x26; I were journeying westward, after the conclusion of the meeting of the Brit. Ass. at Plymouth, when we found ourselves at Falmouth &#x2026; so I need not say that the &#x2018;British Association&#x2019; had only an accidental relation with the &#x2018;Polytechnic Institution&#x2019; on that occasion.&#x201C; Mrs. Owen &#x201C;thoroughly comprehended&#x201C; Sterling&#x2019;s &#x201C;fine character,&#x201C; and both rejoiced that its &#x201C;depiction is in your hands.&#x201C; TC sent the letter to Varnhagen, noting of Owen: &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Palaeontologist</hi> etc. (&#x2018;the best since Cuvier,&#x2019; I hear, certainly <hi rend="italic">our</hi> most gifted man of Science at present. A large figure (six feet and upward) &#x2026; full of energy and good nature: Age 45&#x2013;50.&#x201C;</note> A word from you might explain this;&#x2014;and the shortest that will suffice for intellgibility is all I ask or want in this hurried time. No doubt you <pb id="pg-26-91" n="26:91"/>remember Sterling at Sir Charles Lemon&#x2019;s:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sir Charles Lemon (<date when="1784">1784</date>&#x2013;<date when="1868">1868</date>), 2d bart. of Carclew, Cornwall; M.P. for W Cornwall; pres. of Royal Polytechnic Soc., <date when="1833">1833</date>&#x2013;<date when="1868">68</date>; F. R.

<p>Can you not advise Professor Airey,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Biddell Airy (<sic><date when="1802">1802</date></sic><corr><date when="1801">1801</date></corr>&#x2013;<date when="1892">92</date>; <ref target="volume-26/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/251"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), astronomer royal.</note> or some <hi rend="italic">real</hi> Mathematician and Geometer, to undertake that business of Foucault&#x2019;s Pendulum, and (throwing Euler<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Leonard Euler (<date when="1707">1707</date>&#x2013;<date when="1783">83</date>), Swiss mathematician, one of the founders of the science of pure mathematics.</note> &#x26; his Algebras overboard) illuminate it for the geometrical mind? It seems to me the <hi rend="italic">prettiest</hi> experiment made in this Century,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; perhaps good for nothing otherwise. I have had a great wrestling with it occasionally in my own poor hand (which used to know some Mathematics 20 years ago), and a deadly suspicion haunts me, the fact itself being certain as Fate, that nobody has yet in the least explained what the real course and conditions of it are.</p>

<salute>My dear good Mother,</salute>
<p>I am well enough; but terribly busy,&#x2014;such a welter of confused papers round me as like to drive me distracted (if I were not a very wise and patient man,&#x2014;indeed exemplary in that respect, as you know me to be!)&#x2014;I write, in great haste, to say so much; well knowing what anxieties your good heart is capable of harbouring about us.</p>
<p>Helen Welsh is still here; going on Tuesday: a busy woman in the interim. M&#x2019;Diarmid too was here one day; very doited-looking,&#x2014;with whisky perhaps? The Crystal Palace, they say, is getting quite dim, very dusty and choky with unwashed multitudes; the big trees in it now nearly <hi rend="italic">dead.</hi> I cannot say I am immensely shocked to hear it. Such a racket and <foreign><hi rend="italic">gilravage</hi></foreign> sound nothing at all but infatuated vacuity never took place in my time before. And all trade is at an end: Chapman the Books<hi rend="italic">r</hi> told me the other day he (like all other tradesmen) was doing absolutely nothing whatever; Murray<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Murray.</note> had said, If it were not for the look of the thing he w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> shut up shop. They are proposing now to call Cole (quasi <hi rend="italic">Coal</hi> or &#x201C;black-diamond&#x201C;; who is really, under Prince Albert, the author of all this mischief) &#x201C;Koh-i-Nigger&#x201C; or the mountain of Darkness!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henry Cole; in Persian &#x201C;Koh-i-nor&#x201C; means &#x201C;mountain of light.&#x201C;</note>&#x2014; Jack will explain the joke; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is Chapman&#x2019;s (I rejoice to say), and not mine.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-26-94" n="26:94"/>I had a Note from Jean yesterday: all well, but busy and have never got across to Scotsbrig yet. I must write to her in a day or two.&#x2014; Here is a Piece ab<hi rend="italic">t Mrs Bendysh</hi>,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably about Bridget Bendysh, Oliver Cromwell&#x2019;s grandda.; see <ref target="volume-19/lt-18450823-TC-EF-01"><sic>19:165</sic><corr>TC to EF, <date when="1845-08-23">23 Aug. 1845</date></corr></ref>.</note> wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> you will like to read: keep it safe after (give it to the Doctor to keep for me).&#x2014; &#x2014; The weather here, never yet much too hot, may be called delightful.

<salute>My dear Jean,</salute>
<p>At length our little sculptor writes to me that the Medallion (shamefully delayed by the Frame-maker) <hi rend="italic">is</hi> underway; I hope you have it safe by the time this arrives. &#x201C;Carriage paid to Dumfries&#x201C;; a little box: all ought to come safe.</p>
<p>With regard to the other article framed at Dumfries, and still there, I think you had better keep <hi rend="italic">it</hi>, of the two, as it was your own choice in framing,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; if my Mother prefers <hi rend="italic">that</hi> (as is not likely), I beg you will let <hi rend="italic">her</hi> choose. But on one thing there can be no doubt at all: that I will and must pay all charges on that <hi rend="italic">especially</hi>, which was my express commission to you;&#x2014;therefore pray send the account at once (with notice what day you are to go for Scotsbrig, that I may see how to <hi rend="italic">send</hi> the money); and pray do not make another word about it, for I can hear none!&#x2014;</p>
<p>When you go to Scotsbrig there is also another Commission I have for you: to buy me stuff for two pairs of <hi rend="italic">jean</hi> trowsers (not too <hi rend="italic">light</hi> in the yellow, with good sleek <hi rend="italic">metal</hi> mould-buttons, <hi rend="italic">enough</hi> of cloth); and give the same to Tom Garthwaite at Ecclefechan, that he must be <hi rend="italic">roomy</hi> enough, or suffer for it!&#x2014; You had better buy this stuff just at once, and add the sum to the other account, so that I may pay the whole at once. I will take the trowsers themselves by some opportunity from Scotsbrig, the first I can get; or else make one. I have two pairs of &#x201C;yellow drill&#x201C; since last year; but the wretched Snip<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A tailor.</note> has quite misfitted me, and Tom will be good occasional relief.&#x2014; &#x2014; It has now grown fiercely hot here; and I am kept like a cock on a spit; but have soon to be looser now. My poor liver, as natural, is not in the best order (tho&#x2019; not so <pb id="pg-26-95" n="26:95"/>ill as last year); I sometimes think of <hi rend="italic">Malvern Water-Cure</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In Worcs.; see <ref target="volume-26/lt-18510123-TC-JCA-01">TC to JCA, <date when="1851-01-23">23 Jan.</date></ref></note> for a country refuge But we shall see.</p>

<p><salute>Sir,&#x2014;</salute>The undersigned Historical Writers, Members of various Literary Societies specially interested in the prosecution of historical inquiry, and persons otherwise engaged in literary pursuits, or connected therewith, beg leave most respectfully to submit to you:&#x2014;</p>
<p>That, by the Statute 1 and 2 Victoria, cap. 94, sec. 9, the Master of the Rolls is empowered to make rules for the admission of such persons as ought to be admitted to the use of the Records, Catalogues, Calendars, and Indexes, and also to make rules for dispensing with the payment of fees in such cases as he shall think fit.</p>
<p>The undersigned would also most respectfully submit to you, that the researches of persons engaged in historical investigation and inquiry would be greatly facilitated, and the welfare of our national historical literature be promoted in a very high degree, if you would be pleased to exercise the power given to you in the Statute before mentioned by making an order that such persons may have permission granted to them to have access to the Public Records, with the Indexes, and Calendars thereof, without payment of any fee.</p>
<p>At present any person may search for and inspect any Record on payment of a fee of one shilling for a search in the Calendars, which may be continued for one week, and of another fee of the same amount for the inspection of each Record, or such fees may be commuted at the sum of five shillings per <pb id="pg-26-96" n="26:96"/>week, provided the search be limited to one family or place, or to a single object of inquiry.</p>
<p>These fees are of no benefit to any individual, but are paid over to the nation, the different officers of the Record Establishment being remunerated by salaries.</p>
<p>When a person desires to inspect one or two specific Records for his own private purposes these fees are unimportant in amount.</p>
<p>But when a person engaged in historical or antiquarian research wishes to build upon the evidence of public documents&#x2014;the only sure foundation of Historical Truth&#x2014;it ordinarily happens that in the progress of his inquiry he is obliged to refer to many Records; the inspection of one almost necessarily leads him on to others, and, as he proceeds, he continually finds references and allusions to many more, all which he ought to inspect, if for no other purpose, in order to be satisfied of their inapplicability to the subject of his research. This is the course of inquiry which in such cases is absolutely necessary to be adopted for the establishment of historical truth. Under the present practice this course cannot be adopted. Inquirers are deterred from referring to Records by the total amount of the reiterated fees, and are thus compelled to copy erroneous or questionable statements from earlier authors.</p>
<p>The literary men of the present day find it necessary for the establishment of truth to verify the authorities and references of earlier writers, but the amount of the present fees compels inquirers to accept statements professedly built upon the authority of the Records as they find them. Thus doubt and mistake are perpetuated and made part of our national history, and thus time, which ought to be a test of truth, is often made to lend additional authority to error.</p>
<p>The present practice cannot be defended on the ground of its productiveness to the national revenue. The amount received for literary searches is altogether insignificant except to those who pay it. The attainment of historical truth&#x2014;an object in which the whole nation is interested&#x2014;is therefore prejudiced, and in many cases defeated, by the enforcement of fees which produce the nation absolutely nothing.</p>
<p>The exclusion of literary men from the inspection of the Records excites a demand on the part of persons interested in historical literature for the continuance, at the expense of the Government, of works similar to those published by the late Record Commission. If access were freely granted to the Records, such demand would be silenced; for such publications would be undertaken by the numerous existing publishing societies, or by other voluntary associations which would be instituted for the purpose, as well as by individuals. Every thing that is historically valuable at the British Museum is published without difficulty as soon as it is discovered.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-26-97" n="26:97"/>Even in cases in which free access to manuscripts does not lead to their being printed, it promotes transcription, which tends to preserve valuable information against the unavoidable danger of total loss, to which it is liable whilst existing in a single copy. With a view to this danger the House of Commons ordered a transcript to be made of the Parliamentary Survey of <date when="1650">1650</date>, a manuscript existing in the library of Lambeth Palace,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Official residence of the archbishop of Canterbury.</note> and examples might be adduced of the contents of Cottonian MSS. destroyed by fire in <date when="1731">1731</date>,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Many MSS in the library formed by Sir Robert Bruce Cotton (<date when="1571">1571</date>&#x2013;<date when="1631">1631</date>) were destroyed by fire in Ashburnham House, <date when="1731">1731</date>.</note> having been partially supplied through the means of notes and transcripts previously made by persons who had access to the MSS.</p>
<p>Many of the most valuable historical works of past ages&#x2014;such works, for example, as Dugdale&#x2019;s Baronage, the foundation of all our books relating the peerage;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sir William Dugdale, <hi rend="italic">The Baronage of England</hi>, 3 vols. (<date when="1675">1675</date>&#x2013;<date when="1676">76</date>).</note> Madox&#x2019;s History of the Exchequer, the basis of much of our legal history:<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Madox, <hi rend="italic">The History and Antiquities of the Exchequer of the Kings of England &#x2026; from the Norman Conquest to the End of the Reign of &#x2026; Edward II</hi> (<date when="1711">1711</date>).</note> Tanner&#x2019;s Notitia Monastica, the groundwork of our monastic history;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Tanner, <hi rend="italic">Notitia Monastica; or, a Short History of the Religious Houses in England and Wales</hi> (Oxford, <date when="1695">1695</date>).</note> and Rymer&#x2019;s Foedera, which first enabled historical writers to put general English history upon a sure foundation<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Rymer, <hi rend="italic">Foedera</hi>, 20 vols. (<date when="1705">1705</date>&#x2013;<date when="1735">35</date>), the last 4 vols. being ed. by Robert Sanderson after Rymer&#x2019;s death, <date when="1713">1713</date>.</note>&#x2014;were all compiled principally from the Records. Every page contains many references to them. It is a common complaint that now-a-days no such works are published. Under the present practice such works cannot be compiled, nor can the improved historical criticism of the present age be applied to the correction of the errors which unavoidably crept into such works published in times past.</p>
<p>Lastly, the undersigned desire to state distinctly that they do not solicit this permission on behalf of any persons engaged in Record searches for legal purposes, or for any persons whatever save those who are carrying on researches for historical or other literary objects; and they would most readily acquiesce in and approve of the most stringent precautions against any abuse of the privilege which they solicit on literary grounds solely.</p>
<p>The undersigned therefore beg with the greatest respect to solicit your attention to the circumstances they have stated, and to request that you would be pleased to make an order that persons who are merely engaged in historical inquiry, antiquarian research, and other literary pursuits connected therewith, should have permission granted to them to have access to the Public Records, with the Indexes and Calendars, without payment of any fee.</p>
<p><closer><salute><pb id="pg-26-98" n="26:98"/>And the undersigned have the honour to be, Sir, with the greatest respect, your most obedient and very humble servants.</salute></closer><note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Romilly granted the request, <date when="1851-07-31">31 July</date>, under certain regulations, which he promised to reconsider when the new Records Office in Chancery Lane was opened.

<salute>Dearest Helen</salute>
<p>It was a capital thought in you to write that little note. You can hardly imagine how cheering it was, on my return home, fagged to death and out of <pb id="pg-26-99" n="26:99"/>humour with &#x201C;things in general.&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Teufelsdr&#xF6;ckh was &#x201C;by title and diploma &#x2026; &#x2018;Professor of Things in General&#x2019;&#x201C; (Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi> 18).</note> I almost wished on the way home that the Devil of a <hi rend="italic">Fly</hi> might have again failed you and that I might find you after all&#x2014;but it was better not&#x2014;and neither would it have been better had we made an appointment after the Lecture&#x2014;the Lecture terminated at twenty minutes before five!!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In his last lecture, 3 <hi rend="small-caps">p.m.</hi>, <date when="1851-07-03">3 July</date>, Thackeray turned to the controversial question of what was known as &#x201C;the dignity of literature,&#x201C; energetically denying that the writer&#x2019;s profession was despised by society. He had long taken up a position, from the point of view of a &#x201C;gentleman,&#x201C; in opposition to a well-established movement supported by numerous writers, including Isaac D&#x2019;Israeli, R. H. Horne, Bulwer Lytton, John Forster, and Dickens, to gain greater recognition for the literary profession. TC usually managed to keep apart, though no doubt sympathizing with them. There had already been clashes with Forster because of Thackeray&#x2019;s parodies of fellow novelists in <hi rend="italic">Punch</hi> (<date when="1847">1847</date>), his satire of a memorial volume to Bulwer Lytton&#x2019;s and Forster&#x2019;s friend Laman Blanchard, who had committed suicide, and Thackeray&#x2019;s attitude to writers in <hi rend="italic">Pendennis</hi>, in which the <hi rend="italic">Morning Chronicle</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> were involved (<date when="1850-01">Jan. 1850</date>). His choice of the English Humorists, including Forster&#x2019;s admired Goldsmith, was a challenge; and so in the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, <date when="1851-07-05">5 July</date>, Forster replied to his remarks in the last lecture and referred to &#x201C;some vehement sallies of doubtful doctrine and more than doubtful taste&#x201C; and in the next issue, <date when="1851-07-12">12 July</date>, engaged with Thack eray more directly about the social status of the writer. Somehow news reached Thackeray that JWC, a good friend to Forster, was concerned about his remarks; and he wrote to her, [ca. <date when="1851-07-09">9 July</date>], to say: &#x201C;And dont you understand that there are a set of men who will be martyrs, who are painting their faces and asking for your money, who want to make literature a chronic beggary under the name of the Guild of &#x26;c? My words were &#x2026; for the literary people in the room&#x2014;ask Forster if he didn&#x2019;t know what I mean&#x2014; In fact it was a side shot at that humbug the booth of Literature and Art into w<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I propose to plump a forty eight pounder presently. That is, if it isn&#x2019;t best left alone&#x2014;I thought as much about the concluding paragraph of the lecture: but I was in a rage thats the fact, and with that poor old blundering Jack Forster, for 2 years of treason envy and foul play&#x2014;the more difficult to bear because I <hi rend="italic">wouldn&#x2019;t</hi> be offended with him until at last the wrath exploded in a letter w<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is like a slap on the face, and w<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I hope will be final as regards rupture or reconciliation between the poor old quack and myself.&#x201C; The Guild of Literature and Art, intended as a mutual life assurance assoc. for the benefit of writers and artists, had recently been set up by Dickens, Forster, and their group of amateur players, who raised money for it with help from Bulwer Lytton, who had presented his idea for it as far back as <date when="1833">1833</date>. From time to time Thackeray and Forster made attempts at reconciliation, but the dispute continued to run. See K. J. Fielding, &#x201C;Thackeray and the &#x2018;Dignity of Literature&#x2019; I and II,&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">TLS</hi> (<date when="1958-09-19">19</date> and <date when="1958-09-26">26 Sept. 1958</date>).</note> Thackeray having seen fit to give a long rigmarole about the dignity of the Litrary profession <hi rend="italic">into the bargain</hi>, which I as mixed up in that profession found to be rather derogatory to his own dignity, and unspeakably <hi rend="italic">boring</hi>&#x2014; M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C could hardly sit still and hold his tongue, and dashed off the instant he ceased speaking, down a side door that nobody found out before, I following and the whole thing was vexatious.

After the first half half hour, C. looked at his watch, &#x26; held it across me, about once in two minutes; &#x26; he filled up the intervals with shaking himself, &#x26; drumming his elbow into my side.

<dateline>Chelsea, Saturday [<date when="1851-07-05">5 July 1851</date>]</dateline>
<salute>Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>At length I can pay you the &#x201C;tagrag of an amount,&#x201C; and liberate that snip of paper in your handwriting from the Clip where it has hung imprisoned so long. I have added Jean&#x2019;s account (3 shillings for <hi rend="italic">Carriage</hi>, which is my best recollection); you must also give my dear old Mother a five-pound note for me (which she will accept for my love&#x2019;s sake, and get some good or agreeable thing for herself with it): this brings the sum to &#xa3;16 as you see;&#x2014;the odd <hi rend="italic">fivepence</hi>, if you are at a loss with that, may be given to little Jenny<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Da. (<date when="1843">1843</date>&#x2013;<date when="1874">74</date>) of James and Isabella Carlyle.</note> with my respects! And now I think we have done with this part of our affairs.</p>
<p>I could not clearly know, till this morning when your Letter came, that the Medallion had arrived safe, tho&#x2019; I supposed it likely, and had settled for it with my little man:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Woolner.</note> a rather slow business too! Our notion here is, my Mother may have chosen well as to <hi rend="italic">frames;</hi> and I am very glad to hear the other party are content with their lot. Tell Jean there can be no vestige of doubt about my obligation and determination both to liquidate that money-debt and to make her a <hi rend="italic">present</hi> of a Medallion (which I hope will greatly enrich her, and indeed quite set her on her feet in this world); and therefore that she must not bother herself or you or me with one other word on the subject, but quietly submit to her fate.&#x2014; As to the <hi rend="italic">jean</hi> trowser, don&#x2019;t mind too much: Graham<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly James Graham, Ecclefechan.</note> will probably have some dim-coloured <hi rend="italic">drill</hi> which is nearly equivalent stuff, and if <hi rend="italic">good</hi>, <pb id="pg-26-102" n="26:102"/>and of a deep enough colour, will very well serve the purpose: if you do not like, in either of these particulars, what he has, never mind the business farther: I really am in no passion about it,&#x2014;having already two new pairs of that useful article.</p>
<p>Our weather was growing dreadfully hot; but there rose along with the sun&#x2019;s blaze a strong east-wind for some days, which taught one to expect thunder and cooling again. Accordingly on Tuesday, with really very <hi rend="italic">little</hi> thunder, the rain began; two or three showers, sky like a thick wet blanket (much too <hi rend="italic">thick</hi>) all day; and at night and next day, a right hearty allowance, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> had cooled us all, on Thursday, to the shivering point, and not till today are we quite warm <hi rend="italic">enough</hi> again. The weather may be pronounced beautiful here, all this summer.&#x2014; The inconceivable detestable <hi rend="italic">racket</hi> of the place, too, seems to be already abating, fewer <hi rend="italic">quality</hi> carriages visible on the streets amid the torrents of cabs and omnibuses; in a week or two I suppose they will begin fairly to go, and much more quietness of all kinds will supervene. The quantity of bearded <foreign><hi rend="italic">gobemouches</hi></foreign>,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Simpletons, from the name of a character in a comedy by C. S. Favart (<date when="1710">1710</date>&#x2013;<date when="1792">92</date>).</note> and foolish foreign blockheads gathered by this glass soap-bubble, seems greater than ever. But &#x201C;lodgings,&#x201C; it is said, were never <hi rend="italic">cheaper</hi> than now! Also not a stroke of trade is going on in any shop (Bookshop or other):&#x2014;they that can believe in Cole and Albert as Evangelists, they must take the consequences of such Gospel as they will get! I hold my peace sedulously all this summer; and feel as if it were a universal children&#x2019;s ball; as if all the little youngsters of the Nation in their best frocks had been set to dance and eat comfits, the elders meanwhile rigorously ordered either to dance with them, or else sit silent, and not look sour upon them. All nonsense <hi rend="italic">ends:</hi> that is our great comfort. Be quiet a little; and it will all have taken wing again!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Yesterday, and not till then, I got fairly thro&#x2019; my <foreign><hi rend="italic">fasheous</hi></foreign> revisal of <hi rend="italic">Sterling&#x2019;s Life;</hi> and it is now all into the Printer&#x2019;s hands, about half of it fairly thro&#x2019; them, and the rest not likely to require very much correction, a good deal of it hardly any. I was shocked to discover on ending that it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be well on to a hundred pages <hi rend="italic">longer</hi> than I had meant: fairly over the lip of 400,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The book, pbd. <date when="1851-10-10">10 Oct.</date>, contained 344 pp.</note> all that I can do! There are a good many extracts and Letters, some of wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> could have been omitted. But I fairly let the Book take its own swing, having decided, in this latter operation as in all the others upon it, to exclude the bibliopolic altogether, and let it be as &#x201C;short&#x201C; as <hi rend="italic">it</hi> liked: so now that it has become too <hi rend="italic">long</hi>, I think I will even let it stay so. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Man muss einmal fertig werden</hi></foreign> [The matter has to be resolved sooner or later].&#x2014; It will be good enough reading (except to violent Churchmen, or indeed to <hi rend="italic">un</hi>violent); otherwise worth nothing.</p>
<p>On Thursday I went to hear Thackeray <hi rend="italic">end;</hi> Jane and I. The audience <pb id="pg-26-103" n="26:103"/>inferior to what I had heard; <hi rend="italic">item</hi> the performance. Comic <hi rend="italic">acting</hi> good in it; also a certain gentility of style notable: but of <hi rend="italic">insight</hi> (worth calling by the name) none; nay a good deal of <hi rend="italic">pretended</hi> insight (morality &#x26;c with an ugly &#x201C;do&#x201C; at the bottom of it) which was worse than none. The air grew bad; I had only one wish, to be out again, out, out!&#x2014; Thackeray has not found his feet yet; but he may perhaps do so in that element, and get (as Darwin expresses it) into some kind of &#x201C;Thackeray at Home,&#x201C;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charles Mathews (<date when="1776">1776</date>&#x2013;<date when="1835">1835</date>) gave a series of &#x201C;At Home&#x201C; performances, beginning <date when="1808">1808</date>.</note> in which he might excel all people for delighting an empty fashionable audience.</p>
<p>T. Erskine is here,&#x2014;upon some surgical affair, I believe,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; he looks otherwise well: &#x201C;19. Edward Street, Port<hi rend="italic">n</hi> Square,&#x201C; I once saw him there, not again. Farie is persuading us to a <hi rend="italic">Water-cure</hi>, either at Malvern or Hesse Darmstadt.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Grand duchy in SW Germany.</note> I really believe it might be the usefullest thing I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> do! No arithmetic can count the load one carries from evil liver alone. Sometimes I think of sitting quiet <hi rend="italic">here:</hi> the jolting and jumbling I get in all kinds of travelling makes me shudder.&#x2014; Tell my dear Mother I do not forget <hi rend="italic">her</hi>, nor ever will while I live! Nothing is yet settled ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> our move<hi rend="italic">ts</hi> here. I am bilious to a degree; better however than last year. H<hi rend="italic">n</hi> Welsh is gone Commend me to Jean to Isabella, Jamie and them all.</p>

<salute>Dear Emerson,</salute>
<p>Don&#x2019;t you still remember very well that there is such a man? I know you do, and will do. But it is a ruinously long while since we have heard a word <pb id="pg-26-104" n="26:104"/>from each other;&#x2014;a state of matters that ought immediately to <hi rend="italic">cease.</hi> It was your turn, I think, to write? It was somebody&#x2019;s turn! Nay I heard lately you complained of bad eyes; and were grown abstinent of writing. Pray contradict me this. I cannot do without some regard from you while we are both here. Spite of your many sins, you are among the most human of all the beings I now know in the world;&#x2014;who are a very select set, and are growing ever more so, I can inform you!</p>
<p>In late months, feeling greatly broken and without heart for anything weighty, I have been upon a <hi rend="italic">Life of John Sterling;</hi> which will not be good for much, but will as usual gratify me by taking itself off my hands: it was one of the things I felt a kind of obligation to do, and so am thankful to have done. Here is a patch of it lying by me, if you will look at a specimen. There are 400 or more pages (prophesies the Printer), a good many <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> and Excerpts in the latter portion of the volume. Already half printed, wholly written; but not to come out for a couple of months yet,&#x2014;all trade being at a stand till this sublime &#x201C;Crystal Palace&#x201C; go its ways again.&#x2014; And now since we are upon the business, I wish you w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> mention it to E. P. Clark (is not that the name?) next time you go to Boston: if that friendly clear-eyed man have anything to say in reference to it and American Booksellers, let him say and do; he may have a Copy for anybody in about a month: if <hi rend="italic">he</hi> have nothing to say, then let there be nothing anywhere said. For, mark O Philosopher, I expressly and with emphasis prohibit <hi rend="italic">you</hi> at this stage of our history, and henceforth, unless I grow poor again. Indeed, indeed, the commercial mandate of the thing (Nature&#x2019;s little order on that behalf) being once fulfilled (by speaking to Clark), I do not care a snuff of tobacco how it goes, and will prefer, here as elsewhere, my night&#x2019;s rest to any amount of superfluous money.</p>
<p>This summer, as you may conjecture, has been very noisy with us, and productive of little,&#x2014;the &#x201C;Wind-dust-ry of all Nations&#x201C; involving everything in one inane tornado. The very shopkeepers complain that there is no trade. Such a sanhedrin of windy fools from all countries of the Globe were surely never gathered in one city before. But they will go their ways again, they surely will! One sits quiet in that faith;&#x2014;nay looks abroad with a kind of pathetic grandfatherly feeling over this universal Children&#x2019;s Ball, which the British Nation in these extraordinary circumstances is giving itself! Silence above all, silence is very behoveful!&#x2014;
</p>
<p>I read lately a small old brown French duodecimo, which I mean to send you by the first chance there is. The writer is a Capitaine Bossu; the production a Journal of his experiences in &#x201C;La Louisiane,&#x201C; &#x201C;Oyo&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Ohio</hi>) and those regions,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >J. B. or N. Bossu, <hi rend="italic">Nouveaux voyages aux Indes Occidentales &#x2026; differens peuples &#x2026; du grande fleuve Saint-Louis, &#x2026; le Mississippi</hi> (Paris, <date when="1777">1777</date>).</note> which looks very genuine, and has a strange interest to me, like <pb id="pg-26-105" n="26:105"/>some practical <hi rend="italic">Odyssey</hi> or better. Only a hundred years ago, and the Mississippi has changed as never Valley did: in <date when="1751">1751</date>, older and stranger, looked at from <hi rend="italic">its</hi> present date, than Balbec or Nineveh!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Balbec, or Baalbek, ancient Heliopolis, in E Lebanon, site of ruins of a great Roman colony, built mainly 2nd cent.

Good: I have read several bad. But that too is worthy of some wonder; that too, like the old Bucaniers, hungers and thirsts (in ingenuous minds) to have some true record and description given of it.</p>

<salute>My dear M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Russell</salute>
<p>It is come on me by surprise this morning that the 13<hi rend="italic">th</hi> is no post day here, and so if I do not look to it today Margaret and Mary<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hiddlestone and Mills.</note> will be thinking I have forgotten them on my Birthday,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1851-07-14">14 July</date>.</note> or that I have forgotten my own birthday which would indicate me fallen into a state of dotage!&#x2014;far from the case I assure you! for I never went to so many fine parties, and bothered so much about <hi rend="italic">dresses</hi> &#x26;c and seemed so much like just &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">coming out</hi>&#x2019; as this Summer! not that I have like the Eagle renewed my age (<hi rend="italic">does</hi> the Eagle renew its age?)<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Isa. 40:31.</note> or got any influx of health and gaiety of heart&#x2014;but the longer one lives in London one gets, of course, to know more people and to be more invited about&#x2014;and M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C having no longer such a dislike to great parties as he once had, I fall naturally into the current of London Life and a very &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">fast</hi>&#x201C; one it is! Besides I have just had my Cousin Helen staying with me for three weeks&#x2014;and have had a good deal of racketting to go thro on <hi rend="italic">her</hi> account&#x2014;her last and only visit to me still lying on my conscience as a dead failure&#x2014;for instead of seeing sights and enjoying herself, she had to fulfil the double function of sick-nurse to me, and maid of all work!</p>
<p>She looks frightfully thin; and her <hi rend="italic">shape</hi> is still quite peculiar but she seems strong and wiry&#x2014;could go thro fatigues that I found it impossible to keep up with her in&#x2014;and her appetite for amusement and sightseeing filled <hi rend="italic">me</hi> with astonishment She goes to Fife in a week or two&#x2014; Perhaps you will have seen my Uncle and the two girls at Moffat?<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ca. 20 mi.

<p>I dont know yet where <hi rend="italic">we</hi> are to go this Autumn&#x2014; M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C has so many plans&#x2014;and until he decides where he is going and for how long, I can make no arrangements for <hi rend="italic">myself</hi>&#x2014;I shall be quite comfortable in leaving my house this year however having got at last a thoroughly trustworthy sensible servant&#x2014;</p>
<p>My kind regards to your Father and Husband&#x2014;some one told me your Father was coming to London&#x2014;he must be sure not to pass us over if he comes.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-26-107" n="26:107"/>I can think of nothing of any use to Mary <hi rend="italic">sendable</hi> from here&#x2014;so I inclose 5/s that you may buy her what she most needs&#x2014;a pair of shoes?&#x2014;bonnet? or some <hi rend="italic">meat?</hi> <closer><salute>Give her my kind regards poor old soul&#x2014;and believe me dear M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Russell Your ever affectionate</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Sir,</salute>
<p>I fear I shall not be able to attend any of your meetings;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The fourth Peace Congress was held at Exeter Hall, <date when="1851-07-22">22</date>&#x2013;<date when="1851-07-24">24 July</date>. Burritt was sec. of the committee on arrangements, and Sir David Brewster (<date when="1781">1781</date>&#x2013;<date when="1868">1868</date>; <ref target="volume-26/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/3371"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>) was chairman.</note> but certainly I can at once avow, if, indeed, such an avowal on the part of any sound-minded man be not a superfluous one, that I altogether approve your object, heartily wish it entire success, and even hold myself bound to do, by all opportunities that are open to me, whatever I can towards forwarding the same. How otherwise? &#x2018;If it be possible, as much as in you lies, study to live at peace with all men&#x2019;;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Rom. 12:18.</note> this, sure enough, is the perpetual law for every man, both in his individual and his social capacity; nor in any capacity or character whatsoever is he permitted to neglect this law, but must follow it, and do what he can to see it followed. Clearly, beyond question, whatsoever be our theories about human nature, and its capabilities and outcomes, the <hi rend="italic">less</hi> war and cutting of throats we have among us, it will be the better for us all. One rejoices much to see that immeasurable tendencies of this time are already pointing towards <pb id="pg-26-108" n="26:108"/>the result you aim at; that, to all appearance, as men no longer wear swords in the streets, so neither, by-and-by, will nations; that, among nations, too, the sanguinary <foreign><hi rend="italic">ultima ratio</hi></foreign> [last resort] will, as it has done among individuals, become rarer and rarer; and the tragedy of fighting, if it can never altogether disappear, will reduce itself more and more strictly to a <hi rend="italic">minimum</hi> in our affairs. Towards this result, as I said, all men are at all times bound to cooperate; and, indeed, consciously or unconsciously, every well-behaved person in this world may be said to be daily and hourly co-operating towards it&#x2014;especially in these times of banking, railwaying, printing, and penny-posting; when every man&#x2019;s traffickings and labourings, and whatever industry he honestly and not dishonestly follows, do all very directly tend, whether he knows it or not, towards this good object among others.</p>
<p>I will say farther, what appears very evident to me, that if any body of citizens, from one, or especially from various countries, see good to meet together and articulate, reiterate these or the like considerations, and strive to make them known and familiar<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC&#x2019;s letter was read on the first day, in effect supporting Elihu Burritt&#x2019;s motion on the last day that public opinion should be prepared for an authoritative code of international law, a great change from treating his views on such matters as &#x201C;poisonous Cant&#x201C; (see <ref target="volume-21/lt-18461218-TC-RWE-01"><sic>21:114</sic><corr>TC to RWE, <date when="1846-12-18">18 Dec. 1846</date></corr></ref>).</note>&#x2014;the world in general, so soon as it can sum up the account, may rather hold itself indebted to them for so doing. They are in the happy case of giving some little furtherance to their cause by such meetings, and, what is somewhat peculiar, of not retarding it thereby on any side at all. If they be accused of doing little good, they can answer confidently that the little good they do is quite unalloyed&#x2014;that they do no evil whatever. The <hi rend="italic">evil</hi> of their enterprise, if evil there be, is to themselves only; the good of it goes wholly to the world&#x2019;s account without any admixture of evil: for which unalloyed benefit, however small it be, the world surely ought, as I now do, to thank them rather than otherwise.</p>
<p>One big battle saved to Europe will cover the expense of many meetings. How many meetings would one expedition to Russia cover the expense of! <closer><salute>Truly I wish you all the speed possible; well convinced that you will not too much extinguish the wrath that dwells, as a natural element, in all Adam&#x2019;s posterity; and I beg to subscribe myself, Sir,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>We are meditating seriously to go for a month to the <hi rend="italic">Water&#x2013;Cure</hi>,&#x2014;that is, I am to be <hi rend="italic">douched</hi> &#x26;c, and Jane is to go with me, and see. After consultation, Malvern and Gully<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Gully had established, <date when="1843">1843</date>, with Dr. James Wilson, a water cure center at Malvern, a hillside village of 2,000 inhabitants, which their success made famous. They did not use drugs, believing that nature alone could cure disease. Further, they thought that all chronic disease was owing to faulty circulation of the blood, which could be stimulated by applying cold water in various ways to the skin. Gully, by far the more famous, set down a theory and practice of hydropathy in <hi rend="italic">The Water Cure of Chronic Disease</hi> (<date when="1846">1846</date>).</note> seem the likely thing: the &#x201C;four weeks&#x201C; of Water-cure once well done, we sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> proceed Northward to Annandale and to the Stanleys;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lord and Lady Stanley of Alderley, in Cheshire, ca. 12 mi.

<p>I c<supplied>[l]</supplied>early<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> think you ought to gather yourself together, and come off; you will not find <hi rend="italic">us</hi> here otherwise! The room, as I said, is perfectly at your service; and, after our departure, we could arrange that you should continue to do very well with Anne, who is a staid solid elderly very honest and cleanly woman, and would serve you very attentively so long as you could manage to stay.&#x2014; The <hi rend="italic">Darmstadt</hi> concern I have been obliged to give up, owing to the impediment of these Proofsheets &#x26;c; <hi rend="italic">Rothesay</hi><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Holiday resort on island of Bute in the Firth of Clyde, SW Scotland.</note> involves too much travelling: <pb id="pg-26-110" n="26:110"/>in short, Malvern seems to be the eligible place, even apart from other considerations. Up, therefore, if you are coming at all!</p>
<p>On Monday I (almost) propose to have a dip in the sea at Brighton,&#x2014;conveyance thither and back, by rapid train, for 3/1&#x2014; Tom Wilson <hi rend="italic">duce</hi> [leader]!

However before we separated, as I thought for ever, he politely expressed a wish to see <foreign><hi rend="italic">Etwas</hi></foreign> [some] of my MS.&#x2014; The next morning but one after I had put him in possession of the <foreign><hi rend="italic">Etwas</hi></foreign>, at an early hour, Herr Reimer walked into my room; my papers under his arm; and again after preliminary civilities, said that he had looked into these papers, that he found the subject interesting, of a nature likely to be publicly useful, and that, in fine, he was willing to undertake my Book without delay! &#x2026; So the printing will be proceed with immediately.

<salute>Dear Neuberg,</salute>
<p>Your Letter came two days ago: a very interesting document; opening pleasant glimpses of your late ways and of the world you have been living in. If all men would handle the pen with such definiteness, grace and dexterity, Rowland Hill<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >(<date when="1795">1795</date>&#x2013;<date when="1879">1879</date>; <ref target="volume-26/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/13299"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>) introduced the penny post.</note> would be a greater benefactor than he has yet proved! Your view of Berlin City and Neighbourhood is such as to make one rather thankful <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to be there in this hot weather;&#x2014;tho&#x2019; there is an iron energy in it, too; and I have long perceived the <hi rend="italic">Drill-serjeant</hi> to have been much more effectually <pb id="pg-26-111" n="26:111"/>busy there than elsewhere, the good fruits of which will not fail to appear by and by.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Neuberg wrote, <date when="1851-07-19">19 July</date>, that he had visited galleries and museums and had met a number of distinguished people. He described Berlin as &#x201C;a city with remarkably strait, wide, square streets, with some striking architectural points and effects; rich in artistic decorations and ornaments; but withal without <hi rend="italic">features</hi>, monotonous, and in the long run, I should think, dull. The country round, if country it can be called, is sad in the extreme. Human industry and ingenuity has done great things in the way of streets and palaces and monuments; but as soon as you are out of the precincts of these, the poverty of Nature asserts itself not only in the sickly crop and bare aspect, but also in the low huts and dreary habitations which generally form the <foreign><hi rend="italic">staffage</hi></foreign> of a barren soil. &#x2026; Soldiers and officers without end; but manly, intelligent, hopeful looking, and marching, I do believe in spite of the momentous aspect of things, towards something better than constable-service and pipe-clay.&#x201C;</note>&#x2014; Meanwhile, you have certainly made a handsome business of it for your own affair; far beyond what could have been expected; and truly I am well enough pleased both for your sake and my own,&#x2014;for, it appears, I too am more interested in it than I quite understood. Best luck attend the &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Evangelium</hi>,&#x201C; such as it is;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See last note to preceding letter.</note> and may here and there a human eye recognise us, amid the millions of vulpine, bovine or otherwise <hi rend="italic">in</hi>human that will not!</p>
<p>Herr Tauchnitz, a huge eupeptic man, in shewy apparel, with the Cross of some Legion of Honour or Dishonour at his buttonhole, called here some months ago, and made an honest bargain with me about the <hi rend="italic">French Revolution:</hi> five-and-twenty pounds down on the nail; which sum, as he bragged of giving Thackeray &#xa3;100, &#x26;c &#x26;c, seemed to me abundantly exiguous (especially as the day was wet, and I was sicklier than usual); so that I fear the Grand Cross, who affects to have a soul above ducats, may have left me rather in ill-humour. I have sometimes regretted that I did not rather recommend to him the volume of <hi rend="italic">Latter-Day Pamphlets;</hi> however, there is now no help, and we will wish him speed with what he has.</p>
<p>Our summer here has been in the highest degree noisy and inane: probably the <hi rend="italic">idlest</hi> summer Britain has had for half a century past. The &#x201C;Glass Palace,&#x201C; in which I once was and no more, surpassed in beauty of effect and arrangement all the edifices I had ever seen, or read of, except in the <hi rend="italic">Arabian Tales;</hi> but there unfortunately the merits of the business <hi rend="italic">ended:</hi> &#x201C;the best got-up piece of Nonsense I ever in my life saw,&#x201C;&#x2014;that was articulately my private vote on the matter; which is now inarticulately or otherwise becoming a very general public vote, for there has been no trade or business all summer, especially none here, and the shopkeeper world, driven almost to despair by total want of custom, is getting abundantly sulky. To look once at this Glass Palace was (if you forgot all else) perceptibly pleasant; but to have gone to study, to think, or to learn anything in it, would almost have driven a serious <pb id="pg-26-112" n="26:112"/>man mad. Who can bear to look on <hi rend="italic">Chaos</hi>, however gilded the specimens shewn? Very empty persons only! &#x201C;Improvement in Manufactures?&#x201C; I have often said: &#x201C;The grandest specific set of improvements ever made in manufactures were effected not in a big Glass Soapbubble, presided over by Prince Albert and the General Assembly of Prurient Windbags out of all countries, but under the torn Hat, once, of a Lancashire Pedlar selling washballs and cheap razors thro&#x2019; the Hill-country,&#x2014;Pedlar and Barber who chanced to have a head that he could employ in <hi rend="italic">thinking</hi> under said Hat!&#x201C;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sir Richard Arkwright (<date when="1732">1732</date>&#x2013;<date when="1792">92</date>), inventor and industrialist, a hero to TC; see <ref target="volume-22/lt-18470808-TC-JAC-01"><sic>22:28&#x2013;29</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1847-08-08">8 Aug. 1847</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014; &#x2014; But on the whole I have studied to keep very quiet; have shrunk into the remotest corner, and hung up what screens I had against the tumult of dust, till it <hi rend="italic">laid</hi> itself again, and became mud and zero,&#x2014;as infallibly it will, all the faster for being well let alone! This <hi rend="italic">Life of Sterling</hi>, of which you hear, is a very slight Book,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Neuberg wrote that it &#x201C;must have had a very rapid maturation, as I dont believe you had it in mind when I left England.&#x201C;</note> but it has quietly and piously occupied me, and <hi rend="italic">was</hi> a thing I had to do: a light Portrait, the truest I could easily sketch, of an unimportant but very beautiful, pathetic and rather significant Human Life in our Century: I found it a new kind of task; and the blockhead part of the world may both read it and forget it with more ease than most of my Books. The <hi rend="italic">greatest</hi> bother really has been with the Printer, especially since my impatience with his slowness (that is his one fault, for which there are excuses) became <hi rend="italic">vocal.</hi> He pleads, and truly, the <hi rend="italic">worst</hi> of <hi rend="italic">Mss:</hi>&#x2014;a sort, the strange qualities of which must dwell a little in your own memory, I should think! The poor man has still about 100 of his nearly 400 pages to do; and I have decided to stay no longer in Town waiting upon him. The Bookseller, at any rate, in this sad paralysis of trade, decides not to publish till <date when="1851-10">October</date>. I at one time thought of Darmstadt and a recommendable <hi rend="italic">Water Cure</hi> there; but, owing to this Printer and other causes, have been obliged to change it for <hi rend="italic">Malvern</hi> and a ditto, which is within reach of the penny post. We are actually talking of being off thither in about a week,&#x2014;to stay there for a month, and then do some other Lancashire and Annandale Tourings for a month more before settling again. The <hi rend="italic">Address</hi> is Chelsea always: I feel much better than I did last year this time; <hi rend="italic">Biography</hi> being a much gentler business than the <hi rend="italic">Latter-day</hi> one:&#x2014; I have long had a vague notion of Water Cure as likely much more than anything else to help me for a time; and now I am, at lowest, to get <hi rend="italic">rid</hi> of said notion!</p>
<p>My Wife, who escorts me to Malvern (if we go), as bodyguard, not as patient, is as well as usual in the hot weather; has had <hi rend="italic">Nero</hi> twice stolen, I think, and hardly any other adventure of the tragic kind. My Brother is busy at Scotsbrig; actually toiling at the <hi rend="italic">Purgatorio</hi>, I believe: we expect him here <pb id="pg-26-113" n="26:113"/>almost daily, where he may have a fine quiet time of it, in his museums &#x26; c, after we are gone too, if he like. Wilkinson has sent out his <hi rend="italic">Physiology;</hi> which I find to be a most surprising Book,&#x2014;shadows and analogies being apparently all the same to it as facts, admeasurements and substances,&#x2014;a very cloudland indeed, with abundance of broken rainbows scattered about: I have not yet made much way in reading it, but do design to persevere.

<salute>Dear Dr Gully,</salute>
<p>Your Letter is of the most encouraging and unexpected sort; gratifying, in a high degree, to both my Wife and me. Certainly I might go round the world and not meet with a <hi rend="italic">better</hi> chance of Water-Cure! We will, being human and not canine or asinine, accept your magnanimous offer; we have at once settled to be with you on Saturday first,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1851-08-02">2 Aug.</date> Gully had written TC, <date when="1851-07-27">27 July</date>, &#x201C;Tuesday is my field day for letters of non-professional character: &#x26; on this very one I had proposed to write to you on the self same subject as that which you have indited to me. Of this interest on my part M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Scott can give evidence; to whom I have spoken repeatedly thereof: but have always feared to do what might be deemed impertinent. Now that you ask my advice, I shall proceed to give it, just as I purposed to give it unasked. I owe you for many an elevating thought; &#x26;, knowing your dyspeptic miseries, I have long desired to raise your physique out of them by the only means which appear to me to offer a reasonable power so to do:&#x2014;doing something for your stomach of what you have done for my brain&#x2014;purging it of depressing stuff &#x26; elevating it&#x2019;s tone. / My proposal was &#x26; is that M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle &#x26; yourself should be my visitors for a month: during which time I would so far depart from the ways of ordinary hospitality as to forbid mine to you &#x26; dose you with water externally &#x26; internally. My two sisters, my boy &#x26; girl constitute my family: we keep no company (being in all things too heterodox for the sleepy good folk hereabout); you would be as quiet as midnight: with a room wherein to read &#x26; write in solitude: and in no way would be in social constraint. The water treatment would go on as well in this as in any other house in the village. I would not utterly stop the tobacco&#x2014;nay, I have a large stock of cigars which would make a smoker&#x2019;s mouth to water &#x2026;;&#x2014;and you might take <hi rend="italic">moderately</hi> strong tea or coffee, provided it were not at too high a temperature. For the rest our water cure diet is by no means beggary, &#x26; we should have no trouble in the arrangement of it. With walking power &#x26; with not deficient circulating powers, you offer a good subject for water operations: &#x26;, I doubt not, would respond to them. And if nothing else were done, I am quite sure that the <hi rend="italic">obstinate bowels</hi> may be over come.&#x201C; His sisters, Ann and Helen, and his children&#x2014;Charles, Susannah, and William, aged 19, 18, and 16 at the time (the older presumably away). His first wife d., <date when="1838">1838</date>, and his second marriage, <date when="1841">1841</date>, broke down after eighteen months; see Elizabeth Jenkins, <hi rend="italic">Dr. Gully</hi> (<date when="1972">1972</date>), and Jenkins, <hi rend="italic">Tennyson and Gully</hi> (Lincoln, Neb., <date when="1974">1974</date>).</note> if that will suit; and for four weeks <pb id="pg-26-114" n="26:114"/>thereafter, you shall work your will on us, and see what will come of it. Something beneficial, I do really believe or hope; and that is itself a good prognostic. Your hospitable roof shall lodge us, at least till we can deliberately look out for other perfectly eligible lodgings,&#x2014;which is a grand help to start with. And whatever your medical treatment may do, it is certain such frank generosity and human kindness acts very favourably on the spiritual part of the individuals in question, and cannot fail of <hi rend="italic">its</hi> effect!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Before Saturday I will write again; explaining, or perhaps inquiring, about routes and hours: Saturday, as I said, is our day, if all days are indifferent to you.&#x2014; At present, being frightfully busy, I will cease,&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">before</hi> the Eclipse comes on; which we shall only see as a treble X London Fog, the sky being all damp and cloudy.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >There was a brief total eclipse in the afternoon, which could scarcely be noticed on a dull, cloudy day, preventing those in London &#x201C;from witnessing the interesting astronomical phenomenon which took place on Monday&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, <date when="1851-08-02">2 Aug.</date>).</note></p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I know not where John is today, whether started from you or not; therefore I address a small word to you as the one I can hit best. Jack&#x2019;s Letter came only at 9 o&#x2019;clock on Saturday night, far too late for answering.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC is writing on Mon.</note></p>
<p>We have, this morning, a most magnanimous Letter from Dr Gully of the Water Establishment: how he has known <hi rend="italic">me</hi> these 12 years to good purpose; how he was just about writing of his own accord to catch me;&#x2014;and now he <pb id="pg-26-115" n="26:115"/>invites Jane and me to come and lodge in his house (nobody there but a sister and two children) for a month, and promises to do some good upon us with all the skill he has. Really a very kind and good Letter, and beyond doubt a most handsome offer:&#x2014;I meant to send you the Letter today; but Jane has gone out, and I cannot find it at the moment. We immediately decided to <hi rend="italic">accept</hi> (leaving a kind of <hi rend="italic">open stitch</hi>, to &#x201C;seek other lodgings deliberately&#x201C; if we like): and I have just written that we are to be with him on <hi rend="italic">the evening of Saturday</hi>, if that suit him, as doubtless it will.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Gully wrote, <date when="1851-07-29">29 July</date>: &#x201C;Saturday will suit us very well and we shall expect you then &#x2026; . Only inform us by the post of that day&#x2019;s morning by which of the two following routes you propose to come. / One is by Birmingham (arriving at Malvern,) at 5 PM. / The other is by the G<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Western &#x2026; for Cheltenham &#x2026; &#x26; arrives at Malvern at 6 PM. &#x2026; / I rejoice that you have seen no impertinence in my invitation. It will be a genial vocation to correct the aberrations of your peptic organs &#x26; thereby make your cerebral labour less wearing than it must be when the material juices down below are vapouring upwards.&#x201C;</note> Saturday first, then, is the day we leave home; let Jack understand that. And as for you, dear Mother, you will understand that Saturday <hi rend="italic">fifth</hi> (&#x201C;four weeks&#x201C; after),<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1851-08-30">30 Aug.</date></note> if all go well, is the time when Scotsbrig may be beginning to look for me!

My Printers too have been unusually alert last week (<hi rend="italic">&#x2018;four</hi> times as much as usual), and we are near the end after all!&#x2014;</p>
<p>John told me you had been ailing; alas, a little thing oversets you now! He said you were up again; but beg Isabella to write a word as to how you continue. We expect the Dr, by some route, very soon; our times being as above. (This is new Paper John Chorley is getting for me; which, on trial, I like). <closer><salute>Take care of yourself, dear Mother!

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>You will see the Titlepage itself in a day or so: I have just finished the last of the Proof-slips (clearly <hi rend="italic">within</hi> the required limit of pages, you will rejoice to know); and have sent a Titlepage to Robson,&#x2014;&#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Life of John Sterling</hi>&#x201C; (or <hi rend="italic">John Sterling&#x2019;s Life</hi>) &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">by</hi>&#x2014;&#x201C; and that is all.</p>
<p>I suppose you will not publish for a month or more. One of these days it is possible word may come from America for an Early Copy; but Robson himself can furnish that,&#x2014;the rest to lie strictly <hi rend="italic">dead</hi> for the <hi rend="italic">space</hi> of a Steamer or two.</p>

<p><salute>My dear Mother,&#x2014;</salute>Here we are safe, since yesternight; and I write without delay to say so much; well knowing what anxieties your kind heart is liable to! We had a very tolerable journey, without accident of any kind from 10 o&#x2019;clock to 3 by rail, then from 3&#xBD; to 6&#xBD; by coach (I on the outside) which was much pleasanter. Before 7 we were safe in the Doctor Gully&#x2019;s here, which is a beautiful ornamental little Mansion with pleasure-grounds round it,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Priory House, a Regency Gothic house, with a large garden at the back and a strip of ornamental water called Swan Pool.</note>&#x2014;detached from the Town (or Village, whichever we call it), as Cressfield from Ecclefechan or so. There are <hi rend="italic">dogs</hi> and <hi rend="italic">cocks</hi> (both belonging to the House) unfortunately audible; otherwise <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> that is not in a high measure agreeable. The Dr is a clever modest solid-looking man of five-and-forty; he has <pb id="pg-26-117" n="26:117"/>two sisters with him who are younger; one or two children, being a widower: all of these seem bent to be kind and hospitable and every way attentive to us;&#x2014;of which we ought surely to be sensible. Nero, who was <hi rend="italic">smuggled</hi> hither in a dextrous manner in spite of railway guards appears (for one) to be abundantly sensible of the happy change he has made; and is galloping about without limit of joy all morning. I too sit thankful under shady trees; thankful to get away from all noise; and rather confidently hope to attain some benefit by my journey hither. In spite of the dogs and cocks, I made out a wonderful sleep last night; and tho&#x2019; flurried a bit by the journey and the unspeakable bustle before it, am better not worse today. What a blessing to have it mostly to myself at any rate, and not to be tormented by the cackle of fools round me!&#x2014; In a day or two I hope to send you more minute word. You will get the <hi rend="italic">Leader</hi> still; but rather later while we are here. Also a Magazine, one of these days: it is not worth much. I should have written a line to Jean today: but my head is beginning to ache if I sit much longer here within doors, for the day is very hot.&#x2014; I have written a longer letter to John, giving fuller descriptions, who perhaps will send it to you soon.</p>
<p>My Printers had completely done with <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, and in a few days will have done with the Book: I have arranged with John that a Copy is to be sent to <hi rend="italic">you</hi> without delay after it is ready,&#x2014;probably in a week or ten days.&#x2014; &#x2014; Jane is pretty well in spite of these tumblings: she was here (in this room of mine, a neat little bedroom and bathroom) five minutes ago: her room is close by, and the better of the two as beseems.</p>
<p>Dear good Mother, how are you yourself in the midst of all this! I hope you are holding out well; but I want very much to know. Isabella must write a word, and put it into that cover: I hope she will be so good.&#x2014; My writing apparatus is rather foreign to me here; and indeed it is already laming my hand if I persist at it long in this posture. So I will end; having already said the needful. Good be ever with you, dear Mother. I send my heart&#x2019;s blessing to one and all.</p>

<salute>Dear Jean,</salute>
<p>This is but an unpleasant writing apparatus, this of mine at present; however, I ought to scrape you off a line or two, simply to satisfy you where and how we are. I put off answering your Note till we should get hither.</p>
<p>Jack, as you know, joined us at Chelsea last week, on Tuesday or Wednesday; we had a Miss Jewsbury still there for a couple of days; and with a world all stirring and swarming in the &#x201C;Crystal Palace&#x201C; way about us, we were held busy enough. Indeed it was growing daily worse, that same accumulation of windy blockheads from all ends of the Earth, a fair proportion of whom directed itself towards me: one felt that there was no remedy except getting out of London as soon as possible. Thank Heaven, it now all lies about 150 miles off us, that mass of noisy delirium; and we have now nothing to do with it, but see beautiful bright skies and the finest expanse of quiet hill and plain, with no dirty human windbag-building botherations for us in it!</p>
<p>I think, you know we designed to come to some &#x201C;Water-Cure&#x201C;: this is the chief one in the country and Dr Gully, the director, who among his other merits is a great reader of mine, was the first person I consulted on the subject. He answered with eagerness that we must come and be his <hi rend="italic">guests</hi> (in his <hi rend="italic">house</hi> where only himself and two sisters and two children are, not in his &#x201C;establishment,&#x201C; where are sixteen unfortunate patients at 5 guineas a week); wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is a very distinguished honour indeed; and being offered in so perfectly frank and kind a way, we did not hesitate to accept at once. And so here we are, poor Jane and I, in two nice little rooms, in a beautiful little <hi rend="italic">country</hi> rather than village house (like one of your &#x201C;Lodges&#x201C; near Dumfries, Castledykes<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Site of ancient castle in the bend of the river Nith, &#xBE; mi. S of Dumfries.</note> or other such) with nice grounds and shrubberies round us,&#x2014;and excellent pleasant people, to all appearance, which is the greatest comfort of all. &#x201C;Four weeks in all&#x201C;: till Saturday come three weeks,&#x2014;that is the limit of our time, and the Doctor has this day begun his water treatment&#x2014;&#x201C;packing&#x201C; (in wet sheets, and a world of blankets over them), bathing, sitbath-ing &#x26;c;&#x2014;the whole of which hitherto is quite handy and almost pleasant to such a lover of the bath. He has capital horses too; on one of which he led me a brave gallop yesterday. The air itself, and the <hi rend="italic">silence</hi> under the shade of these trees, is a real medicine to me. I make little doubt I shall gain some kind of improvement greater or less within this month.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-26-119" n="26:119"/>We left Jack commander of the house, during his pleasure. Jane boards her servant; Jack finds himself:&#x2014;that, after study and comparison of experience, was found to be the best method. And there, I suppose, Jack may do very reasonably well for a few weeks. The Western population of London is nearly all off; but there are innumerable multitudes of foreigners and country people,&#x2014;still plenty of acquaintances for everybody.&#x2014; &#x2014; He told me incidentally that James and you had a tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> of coming up for a week. If you do, of course you will find lodging enough in our house; and Jack will be a great help to you as a guide. Just send me a line; Jane will write to her woman that will be all right. Probably the fare up and back is cheaper now than usual: you will <hi rend="italic">see</hi> the Glass concern,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Crystal Palace.</note> too, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> can do you no ill!&#x2014; <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign> dear Jean with kind regards to James&#x2014; Yours ever,</salute></closer> <name>T.

<p><salute>Dear Brother,&#x2014;</salute>Thanks for your kind and pleasant Note of this morning. We got the <hi rend="italic">Nation</hi> (forwarded by Postie) yesterday morn<hi rend="italic">g;</hi> the other Papers, by you, last night. It will clearly be better, since you do not read the <hi rend="italic">Leader</hi>, that Bevis our Newsman be instructed to post it <hi rend="italic">on Saturday;</hi> that will bring it to us next morning. The man (or mannikin) &#x201C;Bevis&#x201C; lives in Church Street:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alex Bevis, newsagent, 9 Church St., Chelsea.</note> but if you speak a word to Postie, that will do.&#x2014; Thanks also for your offer of the map: I meant to buy one on Saturday, but could n&#x2019;t get out; send me yours according to your good intention, any day.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Item</hi> I had to request you to go upstairs to my bedroom; to look there in lookingglass drawer which is to your right hand: there among old pill-boxes, bits of wash leather and etceteras (which pray respect and leave), you will find a small <hi rend="italic">coil of brass wire</hi>, wrapt in paper; cut me off a good <hi rend="italic">pipe&#x2019;s</hi>-length of said wire, and send it coiled along with the map, That is <hi rend="italic">all</hi> that I want,&#x2014;for this post. I did pack such a bit of wire in my portmanteau; but it had come out with my clothes, had fallen on the floor, and been carried away to ruin. I write to you, rather than ask about it at all.</p>
<p>We continue to do bravely here: Jane improving in every respect, by mere sunny quiet and fresh air; I ditto,&#x2014;at least in every respect except <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi>, for the nocturnal noises (dirty little <hi rend="italic">snappages</hi> and cracklings, breaking the grand silence of the scene) are still hard upon me. But the gallant Doctor shifts me <pb id="pg-26-120" n="26:120"/>this night into a better as well as quieter bedroom; and there I do calculate of sleeping nobly. For really I required only <hi rend="italic">perfect</hi> quiet for that object last night; and in a night or two, I know, I shall not be so skittish on that head.&#x2014; The water treatment has now fairly begun in earnest: <hi rend="italic">Packing</hi> at 6&#xBD; a. m. (this operation I don&#x2019;t dislike at all; one gets very hot and quiet directly); <hi rend="italic">sit bath</hi> at 12 (<hi rend="italic">now</hi> waiting for me); ditto at 5 p. m.,&#x2014;this is a very strange, but I do think a useful and potent kind of operation! A modicum of tobacco at my own discretion; the like of good tea, twice daily; excellent plain dinner (where I am tacitly expected to refuse all wine) at 2&#xBD; p. m.: really a most wholesome species of regimen and procedure; and quite comfortable, could I only sleep. I take due walking in the intervals; saunter about the grounds too even in my readings: and in fine spend most of my day in the open air. I really think it is likely to do me some good. The Doctor will not hear of our <hi rend="italic">quitting</hi> his house &#x201C;for Lodgings&#x201C; (as we politely had to attempt); no, no,&#x2014;he lets us beautifully alone too, and in fact seems to me a very fine fellow, and likely to continue very useful here.</p>
<p>I wrote to my Mother: I said perhaps you w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> send <hi rend="italic">your</hi> Note (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> contained more description): yesterday I further sent a small note to Jean. <hi rend="italic">If</hi> they are coming up to London, they are to make towards your present quarters, and let me hear beforehand.&#x2014;</p>
<p>To Helps I wish zealously well; but&#x2014;am hardly sorry to have missed him! The other Note is from Maccall, and worth nothing. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign> dear Brother.</salute></closer></p>

<ps><p>I have seen Scott, who is very <hi rend="italic">dour</hi>, taciturn, suspicious-like, but stronger in body than expected. With his foolish <hi rend="italic">hooh</hi>ing woman.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alexander and Ann Scott.</note> I found him radically worse than silence <supplied>[word illegible]</supplied>.</p>
<p>2 p.m. <hi rend="italic">in my new room</hi> (a very quiet-looking one).&#x2014; By the shifting of my things hither, the <hi rend="italic">pipe-wire</hi> has turned up, sound and safe! So never mind that.</p>
<p>I have had a considerable walk, in the hot clean wind; met by Jane and Mrs. Scott as I came back. I hope to sleep well tonight!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Jane bids me say, if any <hi rend="italic">Letters for B&#xF6;lte</hi> come to the house, you are to put them by, all together, in some drawer.</p>

<salute>Dear Helps,</salute>
<p>I was sorry to get your Letter <hi rend="italic">here</hi> instead of at Chelsea. For the whole week before my going off, I was kept, what with Printers just finishing off, what with Bores to the Wind-dustry of all Nations, in such a toss of hurries and confusions, <hi rend="italic">additional</hi> to those of the business itself, that I had no moment of repose; and durst not ask myself whether there was any chance to see you or not. Had your note come during that week, it might have been like a lantern kindled for a bewildered owl, and had very probably <hi rend="italic">brought</hi> me, at that or some other hour, to Chester Square:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >No. 46, Helps&#x2019;s London address.</note> but as it is&#x2014;!</p>
<p>We got hither last Saturday night; are lodged beautifully in the private mansion of the great Doctor himself (an honour done to Literature and to Dyspepsia); and till the last day of <date when="1851-08">August</date>, here I continue, ready for any amount of splashing, sleeping, and macerating. I have some hope to get a real temporary benefit; and I have the perfect certainty of fairly <hi rend="italic">trying</hi> this same Water-Cure, and so having done with the speculation upon it.</p>
<p>The place is by nature one of the pleasantest: beautiful wide blooming corn-bearing Plain of Severn, beautiful range of porphyry or granite hills (on the eastern roots of which we hang), with the finest variety of walks, and <hi rend="italic">spring water</hi> everywhere such as I have not tasted out of Cumberland or Scotland. For the rest, a population of Donothings, with attendants to help: new houses building everywhere, of the villa,&#x2014;or what I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> call the &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">W</hi>illa&#x201C;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For &#x201C;Villa&#x201C;; i.e., a pretentious little suburban house.</note> sort, and all done in the present style of Willa architecture, Willa granite (made of plaster and paint), dirty little Willa windows (all of stone and lead), Willa everything;&#x2014;surely the ugliest form of building ever prac<supplied>[ti]</supplied>ced by Adam&#x2019;s Posterity.&#x2014;<closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign> dear Helps.

<salute>Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Here is a Message from Scotsbrig wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I am charged to forward to you: poor little Jenny, it will gratify you to learn, has got safe to Montreal. Let us hope her subsequent course in those regions will likewise be fortunate.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-26-122" n="26:122"/>If you have not sent off the Map, there is a small implement in the drawer of my toilet-table, which I will ask you to send along with it, if not too weighty. It is a small black leather article, something like a <hi rend="italic">cocked hat</hi> for the <foreign>generalissimo</foreign> of Lilliput; the use of it is, to wear in your waistcoat pocket, and to serve as a drinking cup when you are on your travels in a country of clear springs. I drink largely of the excellent water here. Pray send the thing if you can find it, whatever its &#x201C;weight&#x201C; be (a very light weight, I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> think!) and whether the map be gone or not.</p>
<p>I slept <hi rend="italic">well</hi> last night in my new cabin; have been well &#x201C;packed&#x201C; (during which I fell asleep again), then well <foreign><hi rend="italic">slaistered</hi></foreign> in a bath with towels; afterwards walk for an hour, in the fresh grey wind, upon solitary commons, in the hollow; then dress and breakfast; after which, and smoking and sauntering on these lawns, here I am. The weather is much cooler, except about noon time, now that the wind has turned N.E.&#x2014;</p>
<p>Last night I walked up thro&#x2019; &#x201C;the Wych&#x201C;;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lower Wyche, ca. 1 mi. S of Gt. Malvern.</note> or rather <hi rend="italic">past</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Wych</hi> (or well), and drank out of the same Herefordshire and Wales were very green and cheerful, wrapt in misty sunshine. An ignorant &#x201C;<foreign>gear-pole</foreign>,&#x201C; one Allen just arrived here,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>We received yesterday morning, I need not say with what satisfaction, Isabella&#x2019;s excellent account of things at Scotsbrig: our good Mother tolerably strong in her old way, &#x201C;bathing in the burn&#x201C; during the hot sun; and poor little Jenny safely thro&#x2019; her voyage, which will be such a comfort to you and to everybody. I sent on the letter to Jack without delay; and he is probably reading it just about this time. From him too I have a short Note this morning, along with a <hi rend="italic">Map</hi> and with the Chelsea Letters he is sending: all well; he &#x201C;at the Museum,&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >British Museum Lib.</note> attending to his affairs there.&#x2014; As I have a few minutes at my own disposal, I will tell you what we are about here, and put an end to any anxieties my last hurried despatch may have left with you.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-26-123" n="26:123"/>On Monday morning I was put into the regular <hi rend="italic">Water Cure</hi> train of operations; and have diligently continued there ever since: all of which goes on as favourably as need be hitherto. I am also shifted into another bedroom, on the opposite side of the house, where I am quite out of the dog-and-cock partnership, and have free chance to sleep so far as Nature and my own circumstances permit: a great comfort indeed in comparison! Jane does very well, without Water Cure; by the mere aid of fresh air and quiet, with <hi rend="italic">Nero</hi> (the dog) to attend her in little walks, and occassionally<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> a hired <hi rend="italic">cuddy</hi> when the road is too steep or long. Cuddies stand saddled for hire at all corners of this place;&#x2014; &#x201C;ninepence an hour,&#x201C; and you give the little boy that drives you a penny.</p>
<p>It is one of the pleasantest countries possible. A great broad and long and most fruitful plain, thro&#x2019; which flows a big river (some 2 miles off us here), called the Severn: this is the general character of the district, Plain or &#x201C;Valley of the Severn&#x201C;; I dare say it is 30 or 40 miles long; and here where we are (rather towards the <hi rend="italic">top</hi> of said valley, &#x26; hanging on the Western side of it, it may be 15 or 20 miles broad. The richest tract of cornland in all Britain: millions&#x2019; worth of yellow wheat is now waving on it far and wide; beautifully broken by trees and other spaces of green; the hundredth part of as much <hi rend="italic">bread</hi> growing together I never saw before. Well, on the Western side of this Plain, there stands up abruptly a range of mountains (made of &#x201C;copper craig&#x201C; or something analagous) running straight north and south for a three miles, then branching off, chiefly westward in a confused manner: these are the &#x201C;Malvern Hills,&#x201C; the highest of them (close by here, top of it hiding above half the sky from this very window) is about the height of Criffell,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In Dumfriesshire, 1,866 ft. Worcester Beacon is the highest hill, 1,395 ft., at which TC was looking.</note> and stands at the north end of the range; it is against the <hi rend="italic">eastern</hi> side of this that &#x201C;Great Malvern,&#x201C; a smart modern place full of paths and trees, and painted &#x201C;villas,&#x201C; with a very old and beautiful Church at the bottom, is hung,&#x2014;looking smartly towards the morning sun, and over that continent of beautiful wheat and green tracery above spoken of. The rock of the hills being of the kind I said, the <hi rend="italic">water</hi> everywhere abounding is excellent,&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">equal</hi> in fact to St Cuthbert&#x2019;s well at Middlebie and far superior to anything else I ever tasted in England. This quality of the water, as well as the fresh mountain air, and beautiful outlooks and walks (for the hills are generally <hi rend="italic">green</hi> and smooth like Burnswark, tho&#x2019; so high), has made the Village a place of resort for wearied Townsfolk from of old; and now, by this Water-Cure, and the great repute of our Dr Gully, all is kindled into double activity; and there is such a building (of miserable Cockney &#x201C;villas&#x201C; and lodging houses) going on as you may conceive!&#x2014; <pb id="pg-26-124" n="26:124"/>This will do for a description of the place to your imagination: our house is far <hi rend="italic">down</hi> the slope, almost close upon the plain; about a gunshot below the old Church;&#x2014;and, as I said, I look up against &#x201C;Worcester Beacon&#x201C; (the highest of these hills), and get no sun till towards evening.</p>
<p>The treatment consists of water, water! First, at half-past 6 in the morning (some have it at half past 5); a burly man, very civil in manner, breaks in upon you: you must instantly rise, and strip naked; he wraps you in wet-wrung towels then in abundant masses of blanket, all tightly stuffed round you as if you were a mummy with the mere head left out: this they call &#x201C;packing.&#x201C; It is <hi rend="italic">really rather</hi> pleasant; for after an instant or two you begin to get very warm in your wet clouts, and yesterday morning (for example) I even fell asleep before the half hour was done. But at the end of half an hour, your ruthless bath-man returns, peels you naked again, seats you in a cold water bath, begins <foreign><hi rend="italic">slaistering</hi></foreign> your back with his towels, gives you sponge and towel to do the like with your front; splashes and <foreign><hi rend="italic">slaisters</hi></foreign> in this way perhaps for five minutes; the<supplied>[n]</supplied><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> rubs you dry and goes his ways. You huddle on some clothes and rush out to walk, being rather cold. After perhaps an hour&#x2019;s walking you return, to shave, dress, and breakfast at 8&#xBD; a.m. After that I smoke &#x26;c, and saunter about the lawns with a book. But at 12 there is a thing called &#x201C;sit-bath&#x201C; to be done: this is considerably nastier (to me) than &#x201C;packing.&#x201C; It consists, in fact, in <hi rend="italic">sitting</hi> in a tub of cold water, up to near the knees and armpits (your feet are on <hi rend="italic">the floor</hi>, over the edge of the bath or tub, and you have a blanket round your shoulders) for 20 minutes by the clock! This is a very surprising operation; and I cannot yet boast of having got to like it: however, it is very potent too; for the instant you are out of it, being surprisingly cold in the middle part of the body, you rush forth again to walk, and the bowels themselves are aware of the strange influence! By the time you are in again, and a little rested, dinner (2&#xBD; p.m.) is ready; very good plain dinner;&#x2014;after which at 5 is another &#x201C;sit-bath,&#x201C; another long walk, and not till 8 comes tea which finishes. We are all in bed before 11, and tired enough with all this <foreign><hi rend="italic">tewing</hi></foreign> and <foreign><hi rend="italic">pluistering!</hi></foreign> But I do believe it will do me good, and that is everything.&#x2014; The people here (Dr at the head of them) are perfectly excellent to us; and give us every reason for gratitude and contentment. Various acquaintances from London have turned up but these I rather avoid.&#x2014; Dear Mother, I fear I have wearied you quite out with these descriptions; but they are over now, and need not return. Ask Isabella to write again, and thank her much for what she already did. <closer><salute>Take care of yourself dear Mother!&#x2014; Ever your affectionate,&#x2014;</salute></closer><name>T.

<p><salute>Dear Brother,&#x2014;</salute>Before Jane&#x2019;s Letter go (which seems in a very great hurry!) let me say that I duly received the Map for which many thanks; then the drinkingcup, d<hi rend="italic">o</hi> d<hi rend="italic">o;</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Carlyle wrote, <date when="1851-08-09">9 Aug.</date>, enclosing &#x201C;a letter from Jean [Aitken], received last night.&#x201C; He said: &#x201C;The sheets of Sterling&#x2019;s Life are to be sent to me on tuesday next, as I ascertained by calling at the printer&#x2019;s yesterday. &#x2026; I am for the Museum to-day again. I hope you got the map &#x26; the leathern cup.&#x201C;</note>&#x2014;and that I appear to myself to be going on <hi rend="italic">well</hi> here rather than ill.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Packing&#x201C; at 6&#xBD; a. m., decidedly a soothing invigorating operation, followed by a walk of &#xBE; of an hour: then breakfast; <hi rend="italic">sit-bath</hi> of 20 minutes at 12 (very curious affair indeed!) followed by smart walk to bring oneself in heat again: dinner at half past 2; sit-bath again at 5 with walk, or perhaps long violent ride: that with bed at 10&#xBD; and better or worse sleep,&#x2014;is the history of a natural day. One full week of it is now over; and certainly I feel very considerably cleared and invigorated in the nerves; but the most of that I could impute very well (hitherto) to unusually liberal exercise, fresh air, fresh water drunk so copiously: and what the precise effect of the water-<hi rend="italic">cure itself</hi> may be I cannot say hitherto.</p>
<p>By your Letter of today it seems to be very uncertain whether Jean is coming to town, or whether even James will come.

<salute>Dear Sir</salute>
<p>Your packet has reached me in safety&#x2014;far from Chelsea&#x2014;thank god! for London, with its smouldering heat and wandering gaping sightseers, was become the liveliest representation conceivable for me of the Place, beginning with an <hi rend="italic">H</hi>, that one would rather not be reminded of!&#x2014; We are here till the end of the month&#x2014;M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C taking the watercure, and I looking at him taking it. A Lady told me the other day that it was &#x201C;quite delightful to hear from the <hi rend="italic">bath-man</hi> how <hi rend="italic">sweetly</hi> M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle took his baths! his <hi rend="italic">only regret</hi>, the bathman said, being that he was not kept <hi rend="italic">longer</hi> in <hi rend="italic">the pack</hi>&#x201C;! So you see the cold water must be acting favourably on his faculty of patience and resignation if on nothing else</p>
<p>I think the bracelet quite beautiful, and shall take every opportunity of exhibiting it. With thanks and good wishes that you may be preserved from conversion to the church of Rome and all such &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">damnabilities</hi>&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Brought up a Protestant, Allingham wrote in <date when="1882">1882</date>: &#x201C;I will have nothing to do with the church of Rome, or indeed with any form of christianity &#x2026; because I know the structure is built on false dogmas. No verbal revelation of any date, in any tongue, has the least authority with me&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">William Allingham&#x2019;s Diary</hi>, ed. H. Allingham and D.

<salute>Dearest of Kates!</salute>
<p>You are there, and I am here, and other people are yonder! So far all is right, but in vain, do I, for my share, try to hop off my shadow; riding on donkeys, sitting under trees, and all that sort of rural thing!&#x2014; London follows me even into this Donkey-Paradise, in the shape of daily flights of little notes <pb id="pg-26-127" n="26:127"/>containing announcements of this and the other great goose being at this and the other Hotel, and desiring to know when I will receive them&#x2014;at Chelsea!&#x2014;&#x201C;<hi rend="italic">their</hi> time being valuable, having so many things to see, they cannot go on chance &#x26;c &#x26;c.&#x201C; And so <hi rend="italic">my</hi> valuable time here must be eaten up in answering them that I am far away thank God! and don&#x2019;t they wish they may get me!&#x2014; I have been writing such notes this morning till my head is all in a swim; but I wont let a post go without thanking you for your letter, which I was beginning to get impatient for;&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">the</hi> Capt<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Anthony Sterling.</note> having written to me that <hi rend="italic">he</hi> had had a letter from you, and &#x201C;so <hi rend="italic">of course</hi> I had had one.&#x201C; I did not see the &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">of course</hi>&#x201C; clearly; but that might be my blindness. Good gracious! think of that man leaving his <hi rend="italic">drunk</hi> Capt behind, and navigating the immortal <hi rend="italic">Lily</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >His yacht.</note> himself!! I have a notion to present him with a book Carlyle is now reading while he takes his baths&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">Masterman Ready</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Frederick Marryat, <hi rend="italic">Masterman Ready</hi>, 3 vols.

<p>You will or ought to be glad to hear that M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle &#x201C;takes quite <hi rend="italic">sweetly</hi> to his baths&#x201C; as a <hi rend="italic">goody goody</hi> Lady here expresses it&#x2014;&#x201C;Oh M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle! it <hi rend="italic">was</hi> such delightful news to be told by M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Scott&#x2019;s (her husbands) bath man, that M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle had said his <hi rend="italic">only regret</hi> was not being kept longer in the <hi rend="italic">pack!</hi>&#x2014;you can&#x2019;t think how pleased M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Scott and all of us were!&#x201C;&#x2014; <foreign><hi rend="italic">Ach! die z&#xE4;rtliche herzen</hi></foreign> [Oh! their tender-loving hearts]! Nobody shows much delight at <hi rend="italic">my</hi> &#x201C;taking sweetly&#x201C; to the donkeys&#x2014;in fact I pass for a woman in good health, merely here to keep her husband company&#x2014;so my hopes that perhaps D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Gully might steep or plash myself into a more effectual state are quite fallen to the ground; after all man does not live by cold water alone&#x2014;and it is not D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Gully I fancy that can do me the favour of informing me <hi rend="italic">what is Life?</hi> the question which has spoilt my digestion these good many years&#x2014;</p>
<p>You shall soon have the whole book now I hope. The sheets of the first part are already in the Captain&#x2019;s hands and the rest will be transmitted to him by my Brotherinlaw, as they come from the press&#x2014;</p>
<p>We stay here till the end of the month and then go into Cheshire I presume&#x2014;but no further <hi rend="italic">I</hi> at least&#x2014;M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C will be in Annandale&#x2014;if the whole programme be not overturned by the Ashburtons going to Paris sooner than they thought&#x2014;M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C being to meet them there&#x2014;</p>

<salute>Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>About an hour ago, by what Coach I know not, the residue of the <hi rend="italic">Sterling</hi> sheets arrived <hi rend="italic">here</hi>, where they were not in the least wanted or expected, and were of no value at all! The carriage was paid to Wor&#x2019;ster; from Wor&#x2019;ster <pb id="pg-26-129" n="26:129"/>hither was one shilling: I suppose about 2/ w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> carry them to Chelsea, their real and only destination, by post;&#x2014;however, one of the young Ladies here has seized the article for reading; so I am forbidden that method at least today. My express instructions to Mr Robson were to <hi rend="italic">send the sheets to Chelsea</hi> (here they are a mere mockery and futility):&#x2014;but alas, alas, how often (in the last 3 weeks) have I <hi rend="italic">told</hi> a man to do a thing for me, and he has gone and done quite another for me,&#x2014;still more to my sorrow than in this instance!</p>
<p>You will have to go or send to the Printing Office, and get a <hi rend="italic">complete copy</hi>, for A. St<hi rend="italic">g</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Anthony Sterling.</note> and yourself, with which to do as you w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have done with the other: there is no other way left. Keep accurately the sheets you have, too; I will keep these which have come hither; and one day we <hi rend="italic">will</hi> unite them into the due volume.</p>
<p>I have a time of really heavy and continual <hi rend="italic">labour</hi> here, from 6 a. m. till 8 p. m; <hi rend="italic">tired</hi> to death every night; and unluckily cannot yet get above 5 hours of sleep. I believe myself to be improving nevertheless.&#x2014; May the Devil fly away with such paper, such a pen, and such a table, as I have at present! So no more at all. Don&#x2019;t in general send any any<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> more printed papers: they are usually worth nothing at all.

<p><salute>Dear Brother,&#x2014;</salute>I decide today that I had better send this wandering Parcel back by post, and so put a conclusion to it. If you have already <hi rend="italic">got</hi> another Copy, very well;&#x2014;then proceed with this straightway according as I shall now describe. If you have not got another Copy, then probably it will be necessary or expedient for you and A. Sterling to read <hi rend="italic">this</hi> before you do anything else with it. But, one way or other, with needful delay or without delay, the thing to be done with it is this: Get it joined to the other sheets which you already have, and make a Binder do it up in boards with all speed after which send it <hi rend="italic">hither</hi> direct; the Misses Gully want to read it before it go to Scotsbrig. This, with a loss of about 3/6 for Robson&#x2019;s blunder, will set the matter <hi rend="italic">where it was;</hi> and so we shall have it off our hands <hi rend="italic">with brevity</hi>, which is something. If, as is probable if you have ordered it, you get, either now or in a day or two, <pb id="pg-26-130" n="26:130"/>another Copy of the Book, you can give that altogether to A. St<hi rend="italic">g</hi>&#x2014; No! you had better get that boarded too, and send <hi rend="italic">it</hi> on to Scotsbrig, as the other will probably be detained here. And <hi rend="italic">so</hi> let us end,&#x2014;with my malison on all blunders!&#x2014; &#x2014; I had an immense ride yesterevening, by Madresfield,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Village 2 mi. NE of Gt. Malvern.</note> thro&#x2019; intricate solitary lanes, almost to the environs of Worcester: Dr G. is away these two days, and only returns tonight. I believe I am really progressing, tho&#x2019; I cannot yet sleep to any purpose. I <hi rend="italic">work</hi> all day, like a Turk, &#x201C;at gathering health&#x201C;: this of itself, independently of water, is a great fact, and must have results.&#x2014; &#x2014; Write to me; and I will answer at greater length. <closer><salute>Ever yours</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Today I send you a Copy of my own bit of a Book, which you have heard so much of lately. I hope you will have it well read by the time I come. This is only a temporary binding; we will get it tightly bound in leather if I were once there.&#x2014; Only 3 days ago I sent you an American <hi rend="italic">Biography</hi>, and not long before, you had <hi rend="italic">Fraser:</hi> this new Book has come, by John&#x2019;s diligence, sooner than I expected;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Carlyle had written, <date when="1851-08-14">14 Aug.</date>: &#x201C;I &#x2026; have gone to the printer&#x2019;s &#x26; ordered a copy of Sterling&#x2019;s Life to be bound in cloth for our mother &#x2026; . I will forward our mother&#x2019;s copy without delay by [<date when="1851-08-16">16 Aug.</date>].&#x201C;</note>&#x2014;and I dare say you will read it first now that you have it. I am very glad to have the thing off my hands; and that is all the recommendation I can give it to myself.</p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I have this morning received a letter from Mr Emerson, by which it appears that you, or you and he, have kindly been negociating with Messrs Phillips and Sampson about a certain <hi rend="italic">Life of Sterling</hi>,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson wrote, <date when="1851-07-28">28 July</date>: &#x201C;For the American Public for the Book, I think it important that you should take the precise step of sending Phillips &#x26; Sampson the early copy, &#x26; at the earliest. I saw them, &#x26; also E. P. Clark, &#x26; put them in communication, &#x26; Clark is to write you.&#x201C; Phillips, Sampson &#x26; Co., Boston publishers.</note> of which I promised to send you the sheets for a purpose of that kind. Mr Emerson says you were to write to me &#x201C;at once&#x201C;; which probably you have done, tho&#x2019; the Letter has not yet got to me, having missed the Packet perhaps, or otherwise a little belated itself.</p>
<p>However that may be, as everything is now ready here, and no time is to be lost, I decide on sending you the Sheets at once; hereby authorizing you to make what bargain <hi rend="italic">you</hi> will, in regard to them with Messrs Phillips and Sampson, or with any other Booksellers or Bookseller whatsoever, under full engagement from me to stand by it as if I myself had made it.</p>
<p>This I think is the essential of the matter; and you can now proceed without delay or farther correspondence of any kind. My Bookseller here does not intend publishing, I believe, for a month at any rate; but if in your expected Letter, or authentically otherwise, I find it so required, I will <hi rend="italic">bind</hi> the Bookseller here to give you a month&#x2019;s start.</p>
<p>Along with the Proofsheets comes a very small old Book for Mr Emerson;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Bossu&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Nouveaux voyages;</hi> see <ref target="volume-26/lt-18510708-TC-RWE-01">TC to RWE, <date when="1851-07-08">8 July</date></ref>, and <ref target="volume-26/lt-18510825-TC-RWE-01">TC to RWE, <date when="1851-08-25">25 Aug.</date></ref> John Carlyle wrote TC, <date when="1851-08-20">20 Aug.</date>: &#x201C;I have sent off the sheets for E. P. Clark &#x26; the book for Emerson. Luckily there is a <hi rend="italic">Boston</hi> steamer this week, &#x26; wednesday is the day for Chapman&#x2019;s parcel. &#x2026; / Your note to E. P. Clarke I have not yet sent, as it could not go otherwise than <hi rend="italic">open</hi> along with the sheets. I can send it either free of cost by Chapman&#x2019;s offer <hi rend="italic">on friday next</hi>, or send it direct to E. P. Clark himself&#x2014;which I think may be the better mode, considering what sort of people many of the American Booksellers are. Perhaps I ought to go first to E. Chapman, &#x26; then tell Mr Clark in a note of my own that the publication <hi rend="italic">will be delayed</hi> one <hi rend="italic">month after despatch of the sheets</hi>, so that he may at once negociate on that foundation.&#x201C;</note> which pray deliver to him.</p>
<p><closer><salute>And so, wishing you all speed, and returning many sincere thanks for your goodness now and heretofore, I remain always</salute></closer></p>

<p>I have now got all your Letters, <hi rend="italic">Sheets</hi> &#x26;c,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Carlyle wrote, <date when="1851-08-18">18 Aug.</date>: &#x201C;Robson punctually sent the copy for our mother on friday evening &#x2026; . The sheets for Anthony Sterling were sent too, &#x26; I have them here beside me waiting till he come to London.&#x201C;</note> as you probably have got mine,&#x2014;the Letter intended for Monday morning <hi rend="italic">would</hi> reach you on Monday Ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi>;&#x2014;so I will send you Emerson&#x2019;s Letter back,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Carlyle said: &#x201C;This morning the postman brought a letter from Emerson [of <date when="1851-07-28">28 July</date>], which I directed him by all means to forward.&#x201C; He also enclosed a letter to himself of <date when="1851-08-15">15 Aug.</date> from the younger James Carlyle, telling them that his grandmother Carlyle had gone to the Gill (MS: NLS 1775B.121).</note> with request to take some steps about that American Copy <foreign><hi rend="italic">qu&#xE0;m prim&#xf9;m</hi></foreign> [as soon as possible]. There is yet no Letter to me from &#x201C;E. P. Clark&#x201C;; but Emerson&#x2019;s Letter seems to indicate that a bargain is as good as made with some Bibliopoles called &#x201C;Phillips &#x26; Sampson,&#x201C; on the part of whom, it is probable enough, John Chapman when he called the other day may have been intending to negociate. I think you had better call on the said Chapman, hear what he has to say (if anything on that subject); and if nothing contradictory to what is written in the enclosed Note to E. P. Clark, then to despatch the sheets, with Emersons Book and the said Note, all in one Parcel, <hi rend="italic">to E. P. Clark</hi> that he may dispose of them at once, and so rid our hands of them. He is a very faithful punctual creature; and the only danger to be apprehended from him is his writing <hi rend="italic">too much.</hi> Of course, you will seal his Note before sending it!</p>
<p>Farie has suddenly landed here last night, and has been hanging on our skirts ever since: he is now loitering about the grounds waiting for Dr G<hi rend="italic">y;</hi> I have stuck <hi rend="italic">the Leader</hi> into his hands to get free of him till I do my letters and bath. He speaks of going away immediately again; which will not be amiss!&#x2014; Our party at Senior&#x2019;s, thanks to Twistleton &#x26;c, was very well. I seem to continue improving a little here; and the weather is quite bright again. Do the best you can with those Yankee and other negociations. <closer><salute>Yours ever</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Browning,</salute>
<p>By a Letter which I had from Emerson the other day it appears that he, assisted by &#x201C;E. Channing&#x201C; and some other friend, is busily engaged in doing a <hi rend="italic">Life of Margaret Fuller:</hi> his Letter enclosed a Note for Mazzini which I understood to contain a request for help in that matter.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson wrote, <date when="1851-07-28">28 July</date>: &#x201C;Now, I am trying to make a sort of memoir of Margaret Fuller, or my part in one;&#x2014;for Channing &#x26; Ward are to do theirs. Without either beauty or genius, she had a certain wealth &#x26; generosity of nature which have left a kind of claim on our consciences to build her a cairn. And this reminds me that I am to write a note to Mazzini on this matter; and, as you say you see him, you must charge yourself with deliver ing it. What we do must be ended by <date when="1851-10">October</date>.&#x201C; Samuel Gray Ward (<date when="1817">1817</date>&#x2013;<date when="1917">1917</date>; see <ref target="volume-13/lt-18411206-TC-RWE-01"><sic>13:314&#x2013;15</sic><corr>TC to RWE, <date when="1841-12-06">12 June 1841</date></corr></ref>), Emerson and Margaret Ossoli&#x2019;s close friend in Boston. For his part in gather ing information for the memoir, see <ref target="volume-25/lt-18501114-TC-RWE-01"><sic>25:279</sic><corr>TC to RWE, <date when="1850-11-14">14 Nov. 1850</date></corr></ref>.</note> Of course the many interesting things you had to say of poor Margaret and her Roman husband<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On the Brownings&#x2019; visit to the Carlyles just before their departure for Malvern; see <ref target="volume-26/lt-18510728-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1851-07-28">28 July</date>.</ref> The Brownings had known the Ossolis in Italy, TC having given Margaret Fuller a letter of introduction to them (see <ref target="volume-21/lt-18470413-TC-JK-01"><sic>21:193</sic><corr>TC to JK, <date when="1847-04-13">13 April 1847</date></corr></ref>).</note> came vividly into my mind; and I could not but feel that it would be a great pity if Emerson, who is a man of real dignity and worth, and who doubtless is striving to do his best in this affair, should by any oversight or ill chance be deprived of the lights he might get from you and Mrs Browning in regard to the Italian part of the business. I forget what it precisely was that you said to me about having been applied to from America, or whether any refusal had already been given on your part: but my desire to help in a good enterprise one who has always been ready and eager to help me originated the notion (which I am now converting into action) of applying to you myself, in Emerson&#x2019;s name, without loss of time, for whatever service you can conveniently do in the matter. I apply at once, because as the Book is coming out in <date when="1851-10">October</date>, there is no time to lose; and because I wanted to report to Emerson that I <hi rend="italic">had</hi> so applied, before going farther. If your answer be at all favourable, give me the privilege of gratifying Emerson by it as soon as may be: he will at once, of course, address a direct request to you on the subject; and by the time his Letter reaches you, the Paper you have to send may be in a good state of forwardness,&#x2014;that is, if you do not refuse to send any Paper whatsoever; which, considering your and Mrs Browning&#x2019;s sentiments and opportunities both, I think will be a pity. &#x201C;Reminiscences of Margaret Fuller&#x201C;: I <pb id="pg-26-135" n="26:135"/>should like well to read in that American Book a frank full Narrative of all that you and Mrs B. can find to say under that head; no matter how offhand the writing, indeed it ought rather to be done in that fashion; and the faster you can write down what is already standing painted in your mind, clear and ready on the subject, it will be the fitter for this object. Pray try what you are free to do, you and Madame, either of you or both of you; and answer me soon, if you can, that you will put something in black-on-white which Emerson may apply for so soon as I give him notice.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if (which I will not believe till I hear it) you cannot fitly do anything in this matter, then observe there is no ill yet done; and there shall be none, for I need not even speak to Emerson about it if your answer prove unfavourable. And so enough till your answer come.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Browning replied from London, <date when="1851-08-22">22 Aug.</date>: &#x201C;What will you say to my stupidity when I tell you that it had entirely passed out of my head, until this moment that my wife reminds me, that she has already, some three or four months ago, contributed the whole sum of both our recollections of the two Ossoli to Mr Emerson&#x2019;s work. &#x2026; / I fear I have given you too great a notion of the amount of our intimacy with the Ossoli, and perhaps the nature of it, even. We saw but a few hours &#x26; half hours of her; and much less of him&#x2014;but there were compensating times when they came&#x2014;and her feeling to us,&#x2014;if words gave it aright, justified our quick love &#x26; respect for her. While I write this, I get to remember my wife&#x2019;s letter, and am sure that it contains <hi rend="italic">all</hi> we know,&#x2014;and, indeed, most of what we guessed. &#x2026; (Surely it must have reached Mr Emerson by this time? It was sent from Florence before the end of of <date when="1851-04">April</date> last.)&#x201C; It was not delivered, evidently lost in mail.</note></p>
<p>I am now nearly three weeks deep in &#x201C;Water-Cure&#x201C; here; which is a strange half-ridiculous and by no means unpleasant operation: not likely to prove miraculous in my case, I apprehend; yet it does seem to produce some benefit, and indeed the immense walks and rides I take on these bright Hillsides and yellow Plains, with total idleness and a near approach to total silence, could hardly fail to do good, independently of tubs and towels. On Saturday come a week we move Northward, for another glimpse of poor old Scotland and some possessions which are still left us there. I am in general profoundly saddened by the aspects of this world; and find it good to hold my tongue that I may not get enraged as well. When do you go to Paris, and what is your address there?<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Brownings, accompanied by TC, left London for Paris at the end of <date when="1851-09">Sept.</date> They lived for about nine months at 138 Avenue des Champs-Elys&#xE9;es.</note> <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Browning.

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>If you come home today from the Gill, you will not be displeased to hear tomorrow how we are getting on here. I was very glad of Mary&#x2019;s little Letter; I hope you took a few more dips in the Solway, and have felt yourself the better for them.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Isabella Carlyle wrote to TC from Scotsbrig, <date when="1851-08-22">22 Aug.</date>: &#x201C;Your Mother went away with Mary &#x26; James Austin on Monday week they were here&#x2014; she was anxious to get a bathe in the salt water. We have been looking for her home every day this week. &#x2026; all the books you mention have come safe&#x2014;&#x26; I sent your letter with the cover &#x26; asked Mary to answer it&#x2014; Your letter of the 18<hi rend="italic">th</hi> never came till yesterday along with John Sterling life.&#x201C;</note> In little more than a week now I shall be on my journey towards <pb id="pg-26-138" n="26:138"/>you; nay perhaps I shall be as far as Liverpool on the ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi> of this very day come a week; and in a couple of days more I may hope to be at Scotsbrig if all go well!</p>
<p>I have prosecuted my Water-cure with great steadiness; and successfully in every way except that I am still a little defective in sleep: the hours are so arranged here that if you cannot fall asleep on the instant, and <hi rend="italic">keep</hi> steadily asleep, you cannot possibly get enough: for the &#x201C;bath-man&#x201C; comes at six in the morning with the punctuality of Time, and whether you have slept or not, it is to him all one! However, I hope to get some long sleeps at Scotsbrig; and after fairly gathering myself out of these puddles, I shall probably feel a good deal better for some time to come. The quantity of walking and riding I have done, which is more than I ever did in any three weeks of my life before, ought of itself to produce an effect on me.&#x2014; Jane, who has not gone into any kind of medicine, but only sauntered about and kept quiet, looks decidedly clearer: indeed we are all pretty well,&#x2014;except the Dog <hi rend="italic">Nero;</hi> whose malady proceeds from &#x201C;high living,&#x201C; and is to be cured by boluses and reduced diet (say the Authorities)! On Saturday next (this day week) we all set off, and after 6 or 7 miles of coach, get into the railway for 4 or 5 hours, and so hope to find ourselves in Liverpool, after all these adventures. I will write from there, what day you are to expect me,&#x2014;perhaps sooner if there is anything whatever requiring to be said. I send a Note which came from John this morning. Love to all: dear Mother</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>You did quite right, in all respects, in regard to that affair of the American Sheets; and I am much obliged by your punctuality and promptitude in doing it for me, and putting it clear off our hands, as I hope it will now prove to be. I did not write, because your course was already altogether good, and I am, more especially while here (at my ricketty table &#x26;c), glad of a dispensation from writing. Nothing of <hi rend="italic">Howe</hi>,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Carlyle sent a note, <date when="1851-08-18">18 Aug.</date>, saying that Joseph Howe had sent TC &#x201C;some printed papers from Halifax regarding projected railways in Canada,&#x201C; his speech on &#x201C;intercolonial railways,&#x201C; and a report on his &#x201C;doings.&#x201C;</note> still less of the <hi rend="italic">Copyright</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >About this time Bulwer Lytton and others tried to revive the question of international copyright and an Anglo-American agreement.</note> or other such rubbish will at all need to be forwarded hither. We got your Letter this morning; on Saturday (yesterday) I wrote to my Mother at Scotsbrig, enclosing your last Letter to me; I fancy she may be at Scotsbrig this day, perhaps reading the news from us even now. I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have written to Emerson today, but got into the <hi rend="italic">Leader</hi> &#x26;c, and being dreadfully lazy have put off that business till tomorrow.</p>
<p>My Water-Cure has now got into its last week; and the result of it, I think, so far as <hi rend="italic">water</hi> is concerned, will be very trifling. I am <hi rend="italic">packed</hi> every morning then elaborately <foreign><hi rend="italic">slaistered</hi></foreign> in water for 5 minutes and elaborately dried; 2 <hi rend="italic">sit-baths</hi> follow daily; and I conform easily to the diet and hours: all this seems to be in a degree insignificant for me;&#x2014;but the immense quantity of regular exercise (following each water appliance) which I have all along taken, as well as a good deal of excell<hi rend="italic">t</hi> water which I have daily of my own accord <hi rend="italic">drunk</hi>, all this has certainly done me good, and if I were at Scotsbrig again to have some command of my diet, and to get 3 or even one good sleep, I expect to feel myself perceptibly better, and to <hi rend="italic">know</hi> the Water-Cure in time coming. Hitherto I have not had one night&#x2019;s sleep; nor do I now expect such a thing here: my <hi rend="italic">weak</hi> misery is accordingly rather worse than it was, and I have still from time to time to take <hi rend="italic">half</hi> a pill: nevertheless</p>

<salute>Dear Emerson,</salute>
<p>Many thanks for your Letter,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1851-07-28">28 July</date>.</note> which found me here about a week ago, and gave a full solution to my bibliopolic difficulties. However sore your eyes, or however taciturn your mood, there is no delay of writing when any service is to be done by it! In fact you are very good to me, and always were, in all manner of ways; for which I do, as I ought, thank the Upper Powers and you. That truly has been and is one of the possessions of my life in this perverse epoch of the world.</p>
<p>No tidings have yet arrived from E. P. Clark himself; but I have settled the affair and despatched everything just as if he had written: namely I have sent off by John Chapman a Copy of the <hi rend="italic">Life of Sterling</hi>, which is all printed and ready, but is not to appear till the first week of <date when="1851-10">October</date>; and by the same Steamer, which left Liverpool 3 days ago for Boston direct, a Letter to the said E. P. Clark announcing the advent of such a Parcel, and emphatically authorizing him to make whatever bargain he finds with Ph<hi rend="italic">ps</hi> &#x26; Sampson or with any other Publisher or Publishers: the <hi rend="italic">Letter</hi>, I understand, went in P. &#x26; Sampson&#x2019;s Parcel from Chapman; the <foreign><hi rend="italic">Corpus delicti</hi></foreign> itself, namely the <hi rend="italic">Sheets</hi> of the Book, went to a House called <hi rend="italic">Crosby &#x26; Nichols</hi> or some such name: that was my Brother&#x2019;s management, who is now in Chelsea in our house, looking after <hi rend="italic">Dante</hi> manuscripts &#x26;c, and who underwent these troubles for me in my absence.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-26/lt-18510819-TC-EPC-01">TC to EPC, <date when="1851-08-19">19 Aug.</date></ref></note> Along with the <hi rend="italic">Sheets</hi> was a poor little French Book for you,&#x2014;Book of a poor naval <hi rend="italic">Mississippi</hi> Frenchman, one &#x201C;Bossu&#x201C; I think; written only a century ago, yet which already seemed old as the Pyramids in reference to those strange fast-growing countries. I read it as a kind of defaced <hi rend="italic">romance;</hi> very thin and lean, but all <hi rend="italic">true</hi>, and very marvellous as such. Clark will give you that; and manage all the rest of the affair, I doubt not, with the due energy and success; to whom accordingly let us leave it with full faith of assurance.</p>
<p>It is above 3 weeks since my wife and I left London (the Printer having done), and came hither with the purpose of a month of what is called &#x201C;Water-Cure&#x201C;; for which this place, otherwise extremely pleasant and wholesome, has become celebrated of late years. Dr Gully, the pontiff of the business in our Island, warmly encouraged my purpose so soon as he heard of it; nay urgently offered at once that both of us should become his own guests till the <pb id="pg-26-141" n="26:141"/>experiment were tried: and here accordingly we are; I water-curing, assiduously walking on the sunny mountains, drinking of the clear wells, not to speak of wet wrappages, solitary sad <hi rend="italic">steepages</hi>, and other singular procedures; my Wife not meddling for her own behoof, but only seeing me do it. These have been three of the idlest weeks I ever spent, and there is still one to come: after which we go northward to Lancashire, and across the Border where my good old Mother still expects me; and so, after some little visiting and dawdling hope to find ourselves home again before <date when="1851-09">September</date> end, and the inexpressible Glass Palace with its noisy inanity have taken itself quite away again. It was no increase of ill-health that drove me hither, rather the reverse: but I have long been minded to try this thing: and now I think the results will be,&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">zero</hi> pretty nearly, and one imagination the less. My long walks, my strenuous idleness have certainly done me good; nor has the &#x201C;water&#x201C; done me any <hi rend="italic">ill</hi>, which perhaps is much to say of it. For the rest it is a strange quasi-monastic,&#x2014;godless and yet <hi rend="italic">devotional</hi>,&#x2014;way of life wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> human creatures have here; and useful to them beyond doubt. I foresee, this &#x201C;Water-Cure,&#x201C; under better forms, will become the <hi rend="italic">Ramadhan</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Usually Ramadan, the ninth month in the Muslim calendar, when strict fasting is practiced by day.</note> of the overworked unbelieving English in time coming; an institution they were dreadfully in want of this long while!&#x2014; We had Twistleton here (often speaking of you), who is off to America again; will sail, I think, along with this Letter; a <hi rend="italic">semi</hi>-articulate but solid-minded worthy man.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >While in Boston, Edward Twisleton had some correspondence with Emerson concerning the common school system (see Rusk 4:261), and presumably he saw him.</note> We have other officials and other <foreign><hi rend="italic">Litterateurs</hi></foreign> (T.

But his water doctor said to Senior the other day, &#x2018;You wonder at his eccentric opinions, and style. It is all stomach. I shall set him to rights. He will go away quite a different person.&#x2019; If he goes away writing common sense in good English, I shall declare myself a convert to hydropathy.

Alfred Tennyson, perhaps you heard, is gone to Italy with his Wife:<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >They left, <date when="1851-07-15">15 July</date>, for N Italy, via Paris on the way there and back, and returned in <date when="1851-10">Oct.</date></note> their baby died <pb id="pg-26-142" n="26:142"/>or was dead-born; they found England wearisome: Alfred has been taken up on the top of the wave, and a good deal jumbled about since you were here.

<p>Your Letter to Mazzini was duly despatched; and we hear from him that he will write to you, on the subject required with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> delay. Browning and his Wife, home from Florence, are both in London at present; mean to live in Paris henceforth for some time. They had seen something both of Margaret and her d&#x2019;Ossoli, and appeared to have a true and lively interest in them; Br<hi rend="italic">g</hi> spoke a long while to me, with emphasis, on the subject: I think it was I that had introduced poor Margaret to them. I said he ought to send those reminiscences to America,&#x2014;that was the night before we left London, three weeks ago; his answer gave the impression there had been some hindrance somewhere. Accordingly when your Letter, and Mazzini&#x2019;s reached me here, I <hi rend="italic">wrote</hi> to Browning urgently on the subject: but he informs me that they <hi rend="italic">have</hi> sent all their reminiscences, at the request of Mr Story;<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Neither was apparently delivered; see <ref target="volume-27/lt-18520507-TC-RWE-01">TC to RWE, <date when="1852-05-07">7 May 1852</date></ref> (Slater, <hi rend="italic">CEC</hi> 477&#x2013;78).</note> so that it is already all well.&#x2014;&#x2014; Dear Emerson, you see I am at the bottom of my paper. I will write to you again before long; we cannot let you lie fallow in that manner altogether. Have you got proper <hi rend="italic">spectacles</hi> for your eyes? I have adopted that beautiful symbol of old age, and feel myself very venerable: take care of your eyes! <closer><salute>Yours ever</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>My dear Mother,&#x2014;</salute>I hardly know where to hit you at present; but fancy you are still at Dumfries till about Saturday, so I will try in that direction. The night before last, I had a Note from John (all well at London) enclosing Jean&#x2019;s, and what must have been a very precious one to you, Jenny&#x2019;s from her new home in America.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Carlyle&#x2019;s from London, <date when="1851-08-21">21 Aug.</date>, and Jenny Hanning&#x2019;s, <date when="1851-07-23">23 July</date>, from Hamilton, Ont. (see <ref target="volume-26/lt-18510611-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1851-06-11">11 June</date></ref>).</note> The poor little body seems altogether full of happiness <pb id="pg-26-145" n="26:145"/>at reaching her destination in such circumstances, and reuniting her poor household which has been split so long. I never read anything like so cheery a Letter from her. Let us hope this change, which was at any rate inevitable, will turn out greatly for her good as things go on! Rob is much fitter for being some wise person&#x2019;s servant than his own master; Jenny&#x2019;s presence beside him may help to steady the poor soul. We will hope all may go well over there. As I know not whether they saw the Letter at Scotsbrig, I think of sending it thither to Jamie today.</p>
<p>As for me I am coming off on the set day; Saturday first, day after tomorrow; my &#x201C;water-cure&#x201C; having then run its course. So at nine in the morning we go in a coach to Worcester, only 7 miles; then we find a train for Birmingham and Liverpool; at 4 p.m. if all go right we shall be in 20. Maryland Street, where the House is very quiet I daresay, there being nobody but one of the young damsels in it by herself. Jane will stay there, or can run across to Manchester, till we see farther. But on Monday morning I intend to leave it, and to be at Scotsbrig that same afternoon, and see you all once again! I will write to Jamie, explaining by what train and whether at the Galls<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Station at Kirtlebridge, nr. Scotsbrig.</note> or Ecclefechan.&#x2014; I daresay my &#x201C;water-cure&#x201C; has really done me good; but at present I am so out of sleep, I feel weaker than I ought to do: I expect to be very much stronger after one week of Scotsbrig. I have walked, and do still walk immensely: this morning, for example, I have had an hour-and-half of it, after my &#x201C;packings&#x201C; and <foreign><hi rend="italic">slaisterings</hi></foreign><hi rend="italic">:</hi>&#x2014;a beautiful bright windy morning, after a night of heavy rain, the first effectual rain we have yet seen here. Two other walks or rides remain for me in the course of the day. Tomorrow there must be settling of accounts, and getting up of trunks; then take the road again, and <foreign>adieu</foreign> to water (in such quantities) for some time.</p>
<p>How long I am to be at Scotsbrig seems very uncertain. We had a visit to pay in Cheshire (20 or 30 miles from Manchester) to &#x201C;the Stanleys,&#x201C; Lord and Lady Stanley, old friends of mine; but their Daughter is about marrying a young Scotchman (Earl of Airly), and of course all is hurry and bustle,&#x2014;and perhaps that visit will blow over altogether, which I shall like as well and better. In that case I shall be free till the <date when="1851-09-10">10th of Sept<hi rend="italic">r</hi></date>, and of course intend to keep quiet at Scotsbrig all the while. We shall see how it goes, and need not bother ourselves at present. If all go right I shall hope to see my dear old Mother again, and have tea with her at Scotsbrig, on Monday afternoon.</p>
<p>James Aitken and Jean will be <hi rend="italic">at home</hi>, I dare say; give my love to them, and hopes of a happy meeting soon. And so <foreign>adieu</foreign> dear Mother. I have various little Notes to scribble, and this is by no means the best of employments for me just now.&#x2014;&#x2014; N. b. I have never pretended in the least to renounce my <pb id="pg-26-146" n="26:146"/><hi rend="italic">tobacco;</hi> but it has, of its own accord, shrunk to about half the quantity since I got into the water-puddles here.</p>
<p><closer><salute>Enough, dear Mother, for this day. With my best regards to all, I am ever</salute></closer></p>

<p>Your Note<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1851-08-25">25 Aug.</date>, saying, &#x201C;The enclosed note has come from Jean this evening, and will speak for itself.&#x201C;</note> with Enclosures came the night before last: poor little Jenny seems as happy as need be; Jean is, as usual, prompt to shew the seamy side of things. I have written today to my Mother at Dumfries, and mean to send a word to Jamie at Scotsbrig to announce my speedy advent thitherward.</p>
<p>We go for Wor&#x2019;ster on Saturday morning at 9 (only 7 miles of Coach): there it appears a train takes us up; carries us, with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> much pause at Birmingham, thro&#x2019; to Liverpool at 4 p. m.,&#x2014;where Mary Welsh, the only inmate of N<hi rend="italic">o</hi> 20 Maryland Street (unless John have returned from Mobile<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In Alabama.

<p>We had a deluge of rain last night,&#x2014;almost our first rain hitherto. This morning is bright as diamonds and briskly windy; I had an hour-and-half of walking, round by Madresfield, amid paths and leafy lanes, the Hill being too windy. Farie is still weak with his fit of cholic; uncertain, very, whether to go North or South in the coming days. Scott, my Bathman said, is off to London this morning, &#x201C;for a day or two, about his House.&#x201C; I have hardly seen him at all; nor wished it, as he poor fellow seemed not to wish it.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I got all your Letters at Liverpool, when we arrived, safe and terribly fagged, on Saturday ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi>;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1851-08-30">30 Aug.</date> John Carlyle&#x2019;s note to TC, <date when="1851-08-25">25 Aug.</date>, was written on the back of one to TC, <date when="1851-08-23">23 Aug.</date>, from John Harland in Manchester stating that he was sending &#x201C;a little Vol. of Quaker Autobiography, w<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I have <hi rend="italic">this day</hi> published &#x26; w<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I think will interest you.&#x201C; John Carlyle identified it as &#x201C;&#x2018;Autobiography of William Stout of Lancaster&#x2019;&#x2014;Quaker, Grocer, &#x26;c till <date when="1752">1752</date>. &#x26; can wait here for you I suppose?&#x201C; The book was <hi rend="italic">Autobiography of W. S. of Lancaster &#x2026; Grocer and Ironmonger &#x2026; A.D. <date when="1665">1665</date>&#x2013;<date when="1752">1752</date>. Edited from the original manuscript by J. Harland</hi> (<date when="1851">1851</date>).</note> the Newspaper and Letter to Jane were ready at breakfast next morning,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Carlyle wrote JWC, <date when="1851-08-30">30 Aug.</date>: &#x201C;Thanks for the sight of this amusing letter from Miss Wynn. I hope you have already sent her an answer befitting her ingenious &#x26; naive speculations.&#x201C; He asked for Geraldine Jewsbury&#x2019;s address and then said: &#x201C;I have nothing to say in regard to Miss Gully, except that you yourself might perhaps take her by storm on my account; &#x26; really I am in sad want of a good wife&#x2014;.&#x201C;</note>&#x2014;only poor Jane had a headache; which, however, gradually went off. I staid silently reading <hi rend="italic">the Leader</hi> in the silent house, till A<hi rend="italic">k</hi> Welsh called between one and two, and took me a long walk and sail over on the Cheshire side: after that, till towards midnight, there was no rest:&#x2014;much superfluous eating and drinking and noisy babbling, instead,&#x2014;and I had but a bad preparation for my journey next morning!</p>
<p>I took your advice as to the railways; got, by Ormskirk, to Preston<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ormskirk is 12 mi. and Preston 30 mi. NE of Liverpool.</note> at half past nine; and then duly into the Carlisle train before 10: being much bustled and flurried, and in very bad order, I was thankful to be quite alone to Preston, and after that to have very <hi rend="italic">few</hi> in my company, and to abstain strictly from speaking any word to any of them. I looked out of the open window; surveyed the <hi rend="italic">macrocosm</hi> without, and alas the sad <hi rend="italic">micro</hi>cosm within, in profound isolation and silence. We had air enough; and I should have done very well; only on arriving at Carlisle, I discovered to my horror that&#x2014;my Portmanteau was not there! I saw it put up at Preston; but they, in their tumblings, had put it down again; and there, of a surety, it was not; and the Caledonian train was just starting! No help for it. I had to speak to the Superintendent, then to write to him from Kirtlebridge;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >2 mi. SSE of Scotsbrig.</note> and again today I have written a long Letter to him (with which I will walk to The Galls myself), and on the whole am reduced to very short allowance of luggage, having nothing but the carpetbag and writing-case: I suppose I <hi rend="italic">shall</hi> get the lost <pb id="pg-26-148" n="26:148"/>article, but not for a day or two, and must just content myself, with as little flurry as I can. My malison on it!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Jamie was ready at the Galls; and all were well here; my Mother just came over with Mary, and looking better than I expected. Poor Mary had her boy, and a cart to go in, but rather a moist night for home: however, she seemed very well in health, and probably w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> take no hurt. I have slept ill ever since Malvern,&#x2014;alas, ever since Chelsea;&#x2014;however, I made out something tolerable in the quiet here last night; washed thoroughly in a big tub towards 7 this morning; and walked to Stockbridge Hill before breakfast,&#x2014;which salutary process I design to try if I can continue while here. I feel as if I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> grow fast better <hi rend="italic">here.</hi> I have not been anything like so well lodged for health and real convenience anywhere in my travels hitherto. Today is very calm, and very gray; dry without <hi rend="italic">drought;</hi> an extremely <hi rend="italic">pensive</hi> day, fit for the solitary soul &#x201C;will let alone.&#x201C;</p>
<p>Your <hi rend="italic">Dumfries Herald</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Fraser</hi> have just been brought in by little Jenny: thanks. My Mother is busy with <hi rend="italic">Sterling</hi> in the other end of the house. Your Bookcase is a superb improve<hi rend="italic">t;</hi> I have got the key, and shall not want for reading.&#x2014; &#x2014; That Letter had come yesterday; perhaps from your poor Keswick Doctor?<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. Leitch had a disfigured face; he lived nr. Keswick.</note></p>
<p>If <hi rend="italic">you</hi> know Miss Jewsbury&#x2019;s address at Manchester, I wish you w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> write a word instantly to poor Jane there, and inclose her this present Note of mine: I have not her address; it was marked on a Paper, but that is in the Portmanteau!

<salute>Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I have not got a word from Jane yet, and do not know whether <hi rend="italic">you</hi> know her address, or could send that Note forward to her. So I write today addressing <hi rend="italic">Miss Jewsbury</hi>, and hoping to find her thro&#x2019; one Ireland of the <hi rend="italic">Manchester Examiner.</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alexander Ireland, business manager of the <hi rend="italic">Manchester Examiner</hi>, <date when="1846">1846</date>&#x2013;<date when="1886">86</date>.</note>&#x2014; The Portmanteau came to hand all safe and right before my Note to you was well away: very glad news indeed;&#x2014;but her address was not there still, at least not that I can find anywhere.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-26-149" n="26:149"/>These Income-Tax Papers are partly of importance and partly of none. The big one is such as is left annually (I believe) and annually thrown into the fire; the little one seems to indicate that Ludlow<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Ludlow, an official of the inland revenue dept.</note> has not been paid when his last account fell due,&#x2014;an affair which is usually managed by Jane, and of which I know nothing at all: these villainous beasts of prey, which are forever prowling about one&#x2019;s house, occasionally fall into that predicament, if one is out when they call! I have written this day to Jane about it; and she, I suppose, will direct you to pay it, for it probably <hi rend="italic">is</hi> due as the poor Ludlow seems in a circuitous way to urge.

<p><salute>My dear little woman,&#x2014;</salute>It is possible you may take a salutary relenting thought, and write to me tomorrow; possible that you may get a Note from John before that, informing you that <hi rend="italic">I have lost your address</hi>, and that you must write!

I thought of it all day, yet with sorrow not with anger, if you will believe me&#x2014;and so we will let it altogether pass, as a thing well forgotten by this time and for all time coming. My ride in the railway did not need that addition to make it abundantly <hi rend="italic">sombre</hi>, as all my ridings and goings are too apt to be.</p>
<p>However, I got along well enough to Preston, and should rather have reckoned myself lucky, for I had all the carriage to myself; and nothing but my own inner man was far out of sorts. At Preston I had to wait 30 minutes (or rather 45 by <hi rend="italic">fact</hi>, tho&#x2019; the <hi rend="italic">theory</hi> was only 20), and <hi rend="italic">there</hi> I ought to have appointed my breakfast, had I well foreknown: as it was, I took one of those bad little cigars (thanks to poor Jeannie that I had even a bad cigar) therewith to pass the time, and in my flurry, stepping up a palpably too steep place to get into the rear of the Station the permitted smoking-place, I stumbled, and peeled one of the knuckles of my left hand (main knuckle of the mid finger there),&#x2014;sorrow on it!&#x2014;and have still a wrappage round the same, tho&#x2019; it is very nearly over now. This was my first small misfortune; not my last, as you will hear. After seeing my Portmanteau hoisted to its place, and being twice assured that it was &#x201C;all right to Carlisle,&#x201C; I got into the farther side of a carriage where there were only three, and soon only two, and from Kendal Junction<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ca. 60 mi. NNE of Liverpool.</note> none at all but my valuable self; and then, in the strictest silence, refusing to speak any word, but hearing not a few (all the scandal of &#x201C;Bury,&#x201C;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Bury, Lancs., 8&#xBD; mi. NW of Manchester.</note> I think, a Methodist Parson presumable, and ancient Bury widow, bound to the Lakes, being interlocutors) I sat, looking out into Nature, all the way to Carlisle and 3 p.m.&#x2014; when, stepping out to get a new place for Kirtlebridge and the Caledonian, I discover that my Portmanteau was <hi rend="italic">not</hi> there! Fancy the flurry, and what a sedative <hi rend="italic">this</hi> was to nerves already agitated enough. Bad luck to all such locomotion, say I; and to locomotion altogether if it is not indispensable!&#x2014; However, I had to leave my complaint with &#x201C;the Superintendant,&#x201C; and make no delay about it, for the Caledonian was just rolling off, and in half a minute more I must have lost my passage too, and been left at a Carlisle Hotel to cool my splenetic humour. No help for it;&#x2014;and your address, too, as I calculated was in that lost package, and not in my memory at all. No help of any kind.&#x2014; At Kirtlebridge Jamie was duly waiting; but before going farther I had to write (with a pen little better than a stocking-wire) a formal demand on the Carlisle Superintendent:&#x2014;a singular document which, as it has now come back to me, I will inclose for your consideration. The loss was not my fault, but the railway&#x2019;s: however, I will draw this practical inference, Always write both name and destination on your Box before starting. <foreign>Eheu, eheu!</foreign></p>
<p><pb id="pg-26-151" n="26:151"/>My poor Mother was here: Isabella and the rest of them were kind as kind could be,&#x2014;washed me shirt and flannel-shirt overnight &#x26;c;&#x2014;next morning I wrote to John to write to you if <hi rend="italic">he</hi> knew; then farther another long and much clearer account to my Superintendant friend; rode over with it to Kirtlebridge Station in the afternoon; and&#x2014;had hardly got home again, when the Portmanteau itself, all safe, was trundled up to the door in a barrow, with all the Letters and Papers that is, at the easy rate of one shilling as per bargain. Which decidedly was good news. The poor people had flung it off at Kendal, I suppose; they are hurried to death in these glass-palace times. Always write your <hi rend="italic">destination</hi> before setting out!&#x2014; &#x2014; This is really all my news, my Dear and I have not properly another word to say till I have heard from you.</p>
<p>Jack is still endeavouring to pity me, I hope, for the loss of my luggage; but by the time has<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> Note arrives, you will be aware how that is. I must send half a line today to relieve him from his notions on that subject. Yesterday he sent a Newspaper, a 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi> vol of <hi rend="italic">Chalmers&#x2019;s Life</hi> (<hi rend="italic">heavy</hi>, as 1/6); and a big Letter,&#x2014;which on opening it I discovered to contain an ordinary big <hi rend="italic">Income Tax Paper</hi> (&#x201C;What <hi rend="italic">is</hi> your Income, Sir, for the ensuing year, you deceitful rascal?&#x201C;) such as you burn, I suppose, at home; and another smaller <hi rend="italic">Income-Tax</hi> Paper, which appears to indicate that you have not paid one W<hi rend="italic">m</hi> Ludlow a &#xa3;3.8.6&#xBD; of income tax due some time lately; upon which (dating <date when="1851-08-28">28 Aug<hi rend="italic">t</hi>, 1851</date>) he and the servants of her Majesty appear to be just about falling on with fire and sword if we don&#x2019;t pay!&#x2014; This was all my Correspondence hitherto at Scotsbrig; and I must say no man of distinction can well have enjoyed a less interesting communication on visiting his native place for rustication. If Ludlow is in the <hi rend="italic">right</hi>, as I suppose, do you immediately bid John go and pay him and get a receipt. The sight of his nasty Paper I will willingly spare you: but it is here, if you need it for clearing up your recollections.&#x2014; &#x2014; <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, my poor dear Jeannie. I have not slept well yet since I came hither, only bathed at 6 a.m. and walked for an hour; and am full of headache and irritability.</salute></closer></p>

<p>For myself, it seems almost <hi rend="italic">Grahamish</hi>,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably like William Graham. &#x201C;My Jeannie (as this letter rekindles into light in my memory) had gone for Manchester; I for Scotsbrig, full of gloom and heaviness, and totally out of health, bodily and spiritual. Prussian Friedrich, and the Pelion laid on Ossa of Prussian Dryasdust, lay crushing me with the continual question, &#x2018;Dare I try it, dare I not?&#x2019;&#x201C; (TC&#x2019;s headnote in <hi rend="italic">LM</hi>).</note> under the circumstances, to tell <pb id="pg-26-153" n="26:153"/>you that I performed <hi rend="italic">my</hi> journey in the most prosperous manner&#x2014;even to the successful smuggling of Nero&#x2014; At the Manchester Station a porter held out his hands for the basket in which I had him, that I might descend more conveniently; but I said with wonderful calm&#x2014;&#x201C;Thank you&#x2014;I have something here that I require to be careful of&#x2014;I will keep it myself&#x201C;&#x2014; And the man bowed and went for my other luggage&#x2014;</p>
<p>I found Geraldine in a much nicer house&#x2014;with large high rooms&#x2014;prettily furnished&#x2014;really as beautiful a house as one could wish to live in&#x2014;and she is the same kind little hostess as ever&#x2014;with her old Peggy and a new young girl she manages to surround me with &#x201C;all things most pleasant in life&#x201C;&#x2014;and I don&#x2019;t know where I could be better off&#x2014;for the moment&#x2014; The first night Dilberoglue and D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Smith came to tea<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Stavros Dilberoglue, Manchester merchant; and Robert Angus Smith (<sic><date when="1814">1814</date></sic><corr><date when="1817">1817</date></corr>&#x2013;<date when="1884">84</date>; <ref target="volume-26/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/25893"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), consulting chemist in Manchester, <date when="1844">1844</date>, and pioneer in public health, evidently intended to m.

It is her brother&#x2019;s intimate friend who is elected. I used to like him, and he is well enough for a man, and would have been quite good enough for ninety-nine women, but this hundredth is too good for anybody I ever saw&#x201C; (Ireland 421&#x2013;22).</note>&#x2014; For the rest I keep up as much as possible the forms of Malvern life&#x2014;splash in cold water and <hi rend="italic">walk</hi> before breakfast; tho the Manchester atmosphere is so thick that one feels to put it aside with ones nose&#x2014;oh so thick, and damp, and dirty!

<p>I wrote to Miss Gully since I came here&#x2014;but there has not been time to get <pb id="pg-26-154" n="26:154"/>an answer.&#x2014; The more I think of these people the more I admire their politeness and kindness to us&#x2014; I don&#x2019;t remember ever in my life before to have staid a whole month in anybody&#x2019;s house <hi rend="italic">without ever once wishing to be away</hi>&#x2014;Geraldine says &#x201C;my Dear, it is a fact that speaks volumes!&#x201C;<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;End of <date when="1851-07">July</date> or beginning of <date when="1851-08">August, 1851</date>, we went to Malvern to the water cure, which was then, and perhaps still is, a prevalent delusion among chronic invalids. Dr. Gully, a distinguished professor of the new art, by far the most distinguished then, had pressingly again and again invited us. &#x2018;Oh, come, lodge in my house, only come and I will cure you!&#x2019; Me especially, I suppose, which indeed would have suited well two ways had he succeeded (<foreign><hi rend="italic">vide</hi></foreign> Lytton Bulwer&#x2019;s flaming pamphlet, and other nonsenses). My own faith in water cure was nearly zero, and has not since risen higher. But I reflected with myself, &#x2018;You will have to try it some day (as you had to try that rubbing with hair gloves humbug, though with damage). No humbug can prevail among your acquaintances, but they will force you to get the means of saying, &#x201C;Oh, I have tried all that and found it naught!&#x201C;&#x2019; So lying open for a summer jaunt, and judging humanly well of Gully, we decided to go; stayed with him, as per bargain, a month: most humanly and hospitably entertained; drank a good deal of excellent water there, and for a time after tried compressors, sitting baths, packings, &#x26;c. Admired the fine air and country; found by degrees water, taken as a medicine, to be the most destructive drug I had ever tried&#x2014;and thus paid my tax to contemporary stupor, and had done with water cure&#x201C; (TC&#x2019;s headnote in <hi rend="italic">LM</hi>).</note></p>

Espinasse&#x2019;s Note you will see at any rate; so I have returned my copy to John: it <hi rend="italic">is</hi> like the &#x201C;old shoe of Carlyle&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unexplained.</note> (<hi rend="italic">mum</hi> about this, I pray!)&#x2014;exciting a melancholy but authentic smile.&#x2014; Alan Ker<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A barrister, who m., <date when="1851-07-04">4 July</date>, Alfred Tennyson&#x2019;s sister Mary, and who had recently been appointed attorney gen. in Antigua, where they were to sail in early <date when="1852">1852</date>.</note> croaks hoarse thanks; hopes now that &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">you</hi> are his friend for life&#x201C;&#x2014;on what grounds appears not!</p>
<p>My poor old Mother is a little out of order today, and keeps her bed; otherwise there is not the vestige of news or change.

Enclose me two of your pills, if you can remember. I begin to judge that the Water Cure has simply been zero in my case; no good at all, and no ill at all.

<salute>Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Your Note with its Enclosure, which again is the Correspondence of the day, has arrived. No word from Jane yet; probably your Note, and mine addressed yesterday to the care of Ireland, will bring something tomorrow. Among these Enclosures there is nothing,&#x2014;nothing better than the old inanity and happily nothing worse. Alan Ker croaks out some hoarse word of thanks; superfluous rather. The &#x201C;Private&#x201C; is a double bit of Pasteboard printed; informing me and mankind generally that either the Day of Judgement or some such trifling event is just at hand,&#x2014;according to Apocalypses and signs of the times: it seems too heavy for inserting. On the other hand, I do insert Espinasse&#x2019;s Note; which will create one melancholy smile in the mind. I have sent off the <hi rend="italic">Nation</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi>, the first C<hi rend="italic">r</hi> I have seen for some 5 weeks past. No direct news yet from Dumfries; but this is a sign that they know I am here.&#x2014; From Espinasse&#x2019;s Note I collect another address, which I will use for Jane&#x2019;s sake if need be.</p>
<p>Our poor Mother took to bed yesterday before tea-time, complaining I think of some kind of <hi rend="italic">local</hi> ailment she sometimes has; she was never very ill, only weak and uneasy; today she still continues in bed, reading &#x26;c, but looks a good deal fresher, and I think will rise soon. Poor body, she is now very frail indeed, and a little thing oversets her. Yet she is wonderfully clear still, and has a singular spirit of self help in her. She wishes to know if you have settled about A<hi rend="italic">k</hi> Hamilton&#x2019;s business,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-26/lt-18510818-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1851-08-18">18 Aug.</date></ref> John Carlyle replied, <date when="1851-09-08">8 Sept.</date>: &#x201C;Tell my mother, I had got my business all but settled with Mr A. Hamilton a week ago, when the death of his half-sister &#x26; funeral came in the way. Some day this week I am to get it finally settled, &#x26; get your <hi rend="italic">coupons</hi> too.&#x201C; He reported to JWC, <date when="1851-09-15">15 Sept.</date>, that he might withdraw his money, as he did not know the new man.</note> as do I.&#x2014; The weather is cool and bright, with a slight shower or two in the night; beautiful brisk weather.</p>
<p>Daily every morning, setting out about 7, I walk rapidly after my bathe to Graham&#x2019;s <foreign>Yett</foreign> on Stockbridge Hill; hit the <foreign>Yett</foreign> with my switch, and turn rapidly home for an excell<hi rend="italic">t</hi> breakfast,&#x2014;and thoroughly idle day. I read <hi rend="italic">Chalmers</hi> (good enough for me), and avoid speech when possible. My sleep, good for six hours, refuses hitherto to lengthen itself. I am weary, weary. So far as I can judge the Water-Cure has not done me the least good nor the least ill.

<p><salute>Many thanks, dear little Goody, for your good kind Note, which I got yesterday, greatly to my satisfaction:</salute> it has done and still does me &#x201C;a deal of good.&#x201C; Ireland must by this time have brought you my first Note; and F. Jewsbury my second: so that you have news enough of me. But I miscalulated Postal Times, or I would have written to you yesterday over and above: it would have answered much better than it does today (Sunday);&#x2014;but either way we will make it do; more especially as there is <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> whatever to be written in the way of news or narrative, and all my scribble must amount merely to, &#x201C;Mamma Theresa, I am here too, and wishing you well!&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350604-JWC-JOST-01"><sic>8:138</sic><corr>JWC to JOST, <date when="1835-06-04">4 June 1835</date></corr></ref>, and <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister&#x2019;s Apprenticeship, Works</hi> 24:123.</note>&#x2014;</p>
<p>Right glad am I to hear that you take well with Manchester, and are enjoying your little bit of a visit. Be cheery by all means, and amuse yourself what you can. And thank Geraldine and <hi rend="italic">Caliope</hi> (the <hi rend="italic">Beautiful-eyed</hi>, that is the meaning of her name), and all the other ministers of benefit, male and female, who contribute to your good in that hospitable sojourn.&#x2014; &#x2014; I myself continue <foreign><hi rend="italic">ourie</hi></foreign> and dreary, in a state approaching to the inane. But everybody here too is good to me; bears with me, and lets me well alone. Last night I had my first considerable <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi>, which surely ought to be of service,&#x2014;only that the state of my &#x201C;inside&#x201C; is &#x201C;rather exquisite.&#x201C; I had decided upon
<hi rend="italic">Castor</hi> for this morning; and wish now I had gone into it: but the hurry was so great, owing to my sleeping longer; I rashly preferred running out (I literally <hi rend="italic">ran</hi>) for half an hour&#x2019;s walk. We breakfast daily at 8 o&#x2019;clock: I dine at 3, on a quarter of a chicken; tea at five (mere drink); some uncertain fraction of supper (porridge oftenest) at 9. I am nothing like come to myself yet;&#x2014;in fact, I surmise the &#x201C;Watercure&#x201C; (especially the long want of sleep) <hi rend="italic">has</hi> modified me a good deal for the time being. Courage, and persevere. I still believe I shall be a good deal better when once fairly out of it.</p>
<p>Yesterday I set the Taylor to work, making winter trowsers, a <hi rend="italic">summer</hi> coat (for next year), and various etceteras. The summer coat is just like the old one, only better <hi rend="italic">dyed.</hi> Of the trowsers I send a specimen, the <hi rend="italic">brown</hi> one,&#x2014;with this question which you are to decide instantly, &#x201C;Will the said brown specimen do for a winter <hi rend="italic">waistcoat</hi> too (with sleeves) to wear along with <hi rend="italic">steel-grey</hi> cord trowsers? Or do you prefer the <hi rend="italic">yellowish</hi> grey specimen for said <pb id="pg-26-158" n="26:158"/>waistcoat?&#x201C; Garthwaite the Taylor pauses for your response.&#x2014; Also, better perhaps send a <hi rend="italic">nine</hi> of <hi rend="italic">buttons</hi> for the specimen preferred? Or possibly they can get them well enough <hi rend="italic">here?</hi> Your decision of the <hi rend="italic">cloth</hi> is the thing indispensable.</p>
<p>Surely you did well to write to Miss Gully: they were as polite and hospitable as human souls could be. We are bound in a deep obligation to them; and must always acknowledge that. But for the rest I fancy I have now quite done with Water-cure; and that a <hi rend="italic">walk in the morning</hi>, which habit I design to try if I can acquire, will be the sole result to me of that month of miserable <hi rend="italic">steeping</hi> and disorderly donothingism. I have even begun taking coffee again these 3 days,&#x2014;finding palpable need of it for the present.&#x2014; &#x2014; My poor Mother has made me very <foreign><hi rend="italic">wae</hi></foreign> three times over in the past two days, exclaiming as if incidentally, &#x201C;I wad ha&#x2019; liked weel to see Jane ance mair!&#x201C; Good old woman: Oh it is sad to see, this inexorable triumph of <hi rend="italic">Time;</hi> and one can do nothing but be silent and admit that it is sad, inexorable and universal. Jamie has just come home from &#x201C;the Preaching&#x201C;; brings me <hi rend="italic">The Leader</hi>, and some Glasgow Newspaper which poor patient Graham sends silently, containing (I believe) balderdash about Gavazzi,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alessandro Gavazzi, an Italian former priest, who gave anti-Roman Catholic lectures and was to organize Italian Protestants in London.</note>&#x2014;whom the Devil is welcome to, if he like. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign> Dearest.</salute></closer> <name>T.

<p><salute>Kate, Darling!</salute> I left Malvern meaning to write to you so soon as I was <hi rend="italic">unpacked</hi> in Manchester&#x2014; The two days and a half I was to pass in Liverpool, would, I knew be fully occupied with the duties and amiabilities of Relationship&#x2014;besides that my bonnet and shoes &#x26;c had all been worn out at Malvern, and I needed, before going farther, a considerable amount of refitting.</p>
<p>Well! it is a week past yesterday since I was deposited with Geraldine and excepting answers to my Husbands letters which <hi rend="italic">must</hi> (as you will understand when you have a husband of your own) be written however inconveniently, this is the first writing I have executed all the while! And if Geraldine were not gone this morning to visit a sick Lady&#x2014;perhaps I should not have been let write today yet.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-26-161" n="26:161"/>The fact is, there never was such hospitality as Geraldines&#x2014;caring for every real or imagined want of ones body or soul&#x2014;from rubbing one&#x2019;s feet by the hour, up to inventing &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">dis</hi>tractions&#x201C; under every approach of <hi rend="italic">thought</hi>&#x2014;I lead the life of an enchanted princess in a Fairy Tale&#x2014;so far as &#x201C;swift obedience&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >From the tale &#x201C;Beauty and the Beast&#x201C;; see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350800-JWC-JCA-01"><sic>8:194</sic><corr>JWC to JCA, <date when="1835-08-13">13 Aug. 1835</date></corr></ref>.</note> to my &#x201C;wishes&#x201C; and &#x201C;will&#x201C; is concerned&#x2014; At Malvern I took the habit of <hi rend="italic">walking</hi> before breakfast&#x2014; Poor Geraldine whom nature prompted to <hi rend="italic">breakfast in bed</hi> is up and dressed and ready to <hi rend="italic">walk</hi> with me! and so on thro all the day&#x2014;not only sacrificing <hi rend="italic">herself</hi> to me at every turn but sacrificing her Brother also, and all her other visitors&#x2014; Her Brother must leave his business to take me excursions on the Railway&#x2014;and the visitors must be <hi rend="italic">used up</hi> for my amusement&#x2014;I dont know how long I could stand such a life without becoming a Tyrant, and too capricious &#x201C;for anything&#x201C; (as they say here) but it is decidedly extremely pleasant, and I think makes me, so far, rather amiable&#x2014;</p>
<p>I cannot but feel very grateful&#x2014;and show my gratitude in the only way open to me&#x2014;viz; by <hi rend="italic">letting myself</hi> be <hi rend="italic">made of</hi> and amused, to all lengths&#x2014; (This is a detestable pen however)&#x2014; M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle left me at Liverpool on Monday gone a week and went on into Annandale to visit his Family&#x2014;losing his portmanteau on the road&#x2014;on occasion of which fatality he wrote to me&#x2014;&#x201C;be sure that you never travel without your name and specific address on your luggage&#x201C;&#x2014;a rule that <hi rend="italic">I</hi> never fancied myself superior to in my life!&#x2014;it was only <hi rend="italic">his</hi> luggage that was entrusted to Providence&#x2014; The portmanteau however was restored to him after a few days of looking into a dark Future, without shirts trowsers &#x26;c, of uncertain duration&#x2014; He is to pick me up here one of these days&#x2014;to go to the Stanleys&#x2014;unless he run us too near the marriage which comes off on the 22<hi rend="italic">d</hi>&#x2014; Miss Farrer has written to me that she saw Blanche often during her stay in London, to buy the wedding clothes, and that she now liked Lord Airlie better, and was quite happy about her marriage&#x2014;indeed only concerned about the hateful necessity of &#x201C;calling&#x2014;her eldest Boy <hi rend="italic">David</hi>&#x201C; a name particularly obnoxious to her taste&#x2014; Miss Farrer, who has always a consolation ready, suggested that &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">The Lady Blanche</hi>&#x201C; would however sound very lovely for the eldest <hi rend="italic">girl</hi>&#x201C;!!&#x2014; So no doubt they will get thro it better or worse&#x2014;</p>

<p><salute>Dear Goody,&#x2014;</salute>In the midst of the hurry usual in my visits hither, I snatch half an hour to send you a word,&#x2014;word about nothing at all moreover, for of <hi rend="italic">news</hi> or the like I have none more than formerly. Rob<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Calvert and certain Australian Cousins<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert was Isabella Carlyle&#x2019;s brother; for her brother John, a sheep farmer in Australia, see &#x201C;New Carlyle Letters,&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">Carlyle Newsletter</hi> 8 (<date when="1987">1987</date>):49.</note> were booked for Scotsbrig on Tuesday; a prospect of <hi rend="italic">noisy</hi> nothingness there in consequence: so I decided on yoking the Gig, and taking my Mother over with me to Gill, whence the Dumfries visit, a thing binding upon me, could be done in the interim. The weather was, and is of the beautifullest sunny <date when="--09">September</date> sort; so that the enterprise was handy, and we have done as well as could have been looked for. We <hi rend="italic">met</hi> your Monday Letter between Scotsbrig and Middlebie; thanks for that: I left word for the Tailor about his waistcoat;&#x2014;I expect he is now far on with his job: one other thing well out of my way. I left my Mother at Gill; Jean is to come down with me to Scotsbrig at 2&#xBD;p.m. (within an hour of <hi rend="italic">now</hi>) this day by the rail; there Gig and Mother, after poor Mary&#x2019;s tea, will be ready to receive us, we hope, and so we shall drive all over to Scotsbrig together. I had an illustrious bath, both shower and <hi rend="italic">sit</hi>, with even something of the <hi rend="italic">plunge</hi> bath superadded,&#x2014;for the ingenious James has made himself a most effectual set of baths here, tho&#x2019; not equal to Whitworth&#x2019;s marble sort;&#x2014;after which operation I had a long rapid walk: my sleep had been tolerable, tho&#x2019; none of the longest; I have now been at the Adamson quarters, have talked with Aird, bought globes, &#x26;c &#x26;c, and except one or two small items am ready for setting out, on rather fair terms. An <foreign><hi rend="italic">ourie</hi></foreign>, misty, dusty kind of character is upon all these localities; the railway doing them <hi rend="italic">hurt</hi> in their business rather than good: however, they are just about getting plenty of excellent water brought into every house, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> will be a grand matter for them; and &#x201C;Father Gavazzi,&#x201C; as huge Placards testify, is going to harangue <pb id="pg-26-163" n="26:163"/>them in Italian tomorrow, which one w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> think must be an extremely unprofitable operation, for all but the <hi rend="italic">Padre</hi> himself! This blockhead nevertheless is actually making quite a <hi rend="italic">furore</hi> at Glasgow and all over the West Country, such is the Antipopish humour of the people. They take him for a kind of &#x201C;Italian Knox&#x201C;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Knox (<date when="1505">1505</date>&#x2013;<date when="1572">72</date>), Scottish divine and reformer, revered by TC.</note> (God help them); and an Ass whom I heard the bray of in some Glasgow Newspaper, says, &#x201C;He strikingly reminds you <supplied>[of]</supplied><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted in MS.</note> our own grand Hater of Shams, T<hi rend="italic">s</hi> Carlyle,&#x201C;&#x2014;certainly a very striking resemblance indeed! O my Dear, I am sick of the stupidity of mankind: a <foreign><hi rend="italic">servum pecus</hi></foreign> [servile herd]; I had no idea till late times what a <hi rend="italic">bottomless</hi> fund of darkness there is in the human animal, especially when congregated in masses, and set to build &#x201C;Chrystal Palaces&#x201C; &#x26;c under King Cole, Prince Albert and Company! The profoundest Orcus,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hades.</note> or Belly of Chaos itself, this <hi rend="italic">is</hi> the emblem of them:&#x2014;ah me, ah me!&#x2014;</p>
<p>You have yet heard of nothing more of Blanche Stanley, nor the visit to Alderley: a stubborn painful fact, however, it does remain; and I often uneasily reflect that it will <hi rend="italic">have</hi> to be <hi rend="italic">done.</hi> Of Paris &#x26;c beyond it I cannot venture to think at all,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; that too is a &#x201C;fact&#x201C; of similar kind, and must demand to be decided on. Alas, I am weary, weary; and rest is not for me anywhere. &#x201C;She said I am aweary&#x201C;:<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Tennyson, &#x201C;Mariana.&#x201C;</note> well, Mariana my dear, is that so unexampled a predicament?</p>
<p>On the whole it seems to me I shall have to lift anchor from Scotsbrig early next week perhaps,&#x2014;certainly before long. I think you had better open some correspondence with Blanche, and ascertain whether &#x201C;four days&#x201C; of us then or about then, will be acceptable? Four days, don&#x2019;t (unless you yourself wish it otherwise) engage for more. But we are bound to go.&#x2014; &#x2014; <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, Dearest: Oh let us help <hi rend="italic">one another</hi> at any rate, if we but can! I salute you with my blessing always; and bid you take good care of your poor self for one thing! Meanwhile be as cheerful as you can.&#x2014;</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>Dear Lady,&#x2014;</salute> May I address a word to you from this peaceful suburb of Creation, where in the bright autumn weather, in the great silence, I am <pb id="pg-26-164" n="26:164"/>often enough thinking of you. Where you are at this moment I do not know with the least certainty;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >She was in Berne; see <ref target="volume-26/lt-18510917-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1851-09-17">17 Sept.</date></ref></note> but think you must be approximating Paris, and I strive to hope that all is still well with you. I wrote duly from Malvern when your second Homburg Letter came; directing as you bade me to &#x201C;Interlachen by Bern&#x201C;: but I almost fear the Note has never reached you, as if it had, some word in your great charity would have been here for me before now: on the whole, as to the Note itself you need not lament if you never see it;&#x2014;a mere prophecy of my dates and shiftings, barren as a merchant&#x2019;s invoice; written too on a ricketty table, under every sort of hindrance, and with a pen even worse than this. The gods are not extremely favourable to our correspondence just at this time! However, I still hope for improvement; one is permitted always in this world to hope. If you got the rag of paper at all, it might be almost pathetic to you, after a sort. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Eheu!</hi></foreign></p>
<p>We did leave Malvern at the day set, the last of <date when="1851-08">August</date>; came to Lancashire, and then after a day I left Jane with her Liverpool friends, and came myself across to Scotland; terribly cut up with <hi rend="italic">water</hi>, and in pressing need of repose. Here I have been ever since, close hidden, and doing my very best to be and to be left quiet;&#x2014;unluckily there is so much confusion in my own poor self, it is no easy matter to come to any equilibrium, and <hi rend="italic">be</hi> at rest even when left. I have still some hopes from Dr Gully&#x2019;s aqueous labours, if the matter were summed up; but hitherto I almost feel worse instead of better; and for a week here could not get myself composed to <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi>, and indeed yet can hardly, now that my Scotch days are drawing to an end: so that when the real &#x201C;sum&#x201C; will be had, or what it may then be, is still a little uncertain,&#x2014;like so many other things. Anyway, I am glad to have this &#x201C;Water-Cure&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">done</hi>, since it was a thing to do. As poor Lord Melbourne<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Lamb (<date when="1779">1779</date>&#x2013;<date when="1848">1848</date>), 2d Viscount Melbourne, former prime minister.</note> liked when a Poet <hi rend="italic">died</hi>, for then, said he, &#x201C;you get all his Books on your shelf and have finished with him,&#x201C; so may I, with better reason, of the Malvern puddles. We shall by and by get done with <hi rend="italic">all</hi> our puddles in this world, and the ugliest of them will be smooth as azure to us: which surely is a comfort too of its kind!&#x2014; By the bye, I expect, for the first time these ten or twenty years, to have soon some <hi rend="italic">paper</hi> that I can write upon again. My sufferings in regard to that small article are and have been more considerable than your Ladyship with those swift fingers, with that cheerful royal heart, and victorious healthy fancy which the gods have given you, could well imagine. You do not know in the least what a poor creature I every way am:&#x2014;Oh Heavens, and one feels that it <hi rend="italic">might</hi> have been all otherwise, and that it cannot under such obstructions now be! &#x201C;The sons of Zerhiah, you are too strong for me!&#x201C;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Untraced. For Zerahiah, see 1 Chron. 6:6, 51, and Ezra 7:4, 8:4.</note> This is the Highday of Quacks <pb id="pg-26-165" n="26:165"/>and other Satanic Agencies: God help us to be at least silent under it, and not make matters worse than they must be.</p>
<p>Jane is now with Geraldine Jewsbury; apparently very well, and tolerably amused with what Manchester offers, which a crowd of devoted servants are very ready to get up for her always in that quarter. Nothing yet is definitely settled about farther movements: only I feel in general that 4 or 5 days more must end what is appointed me here; a visit, which I propose to limit to 4 days, is due for Alderley,&#x2014;after which one day&#x2019;s whirl will bring us home to Chelsea again: perhaps to rest there? The wedding<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of Blanche Stanley and Lord Airlie.</note> at Alderley is to be on the 23<hi rend="italic">d:</hi> our visit must be all well over before that come too near; so much is fixed by the outer powers; the rest I know only in the vague, as my own aim and conjecture hitherto. We cannot well be home at Chelsea before the 18<hi rend="italic">th</hi> or 20<hi rend="italic">th:</hi>&#x2014;alas that is 8 days behind the Paris time; and what is to become of Paris and me is yet, as it has all along been, a mystery which I may well call <hi rend="italic">sublime.</hi> More truly so than perhaps you will believe. In bad times it has ever seemed forbidden flatly even by my state of health; then in moments to be called hopeful and good&#x2014; Ah me, ah me!&#x2014; Dear friend, do not get quite impatient with me: write to me; let me leave that matter still undecided till then. Oh you have a strength of faith, and it is all needful. And I too, am I not loyal to the gods and you,&#x2014;truly want to be so, if you care to believe me? Next time I must definitely say Yes <hi rend="italic">or</hi> No (&#x201C;Yes <hi rend="italic">and</hi>&#x201C; is so much handier always!)&#x2014;unless indeed Time and your Courier have not already said the latter for me. <closer><salute>Anyway, all honour to you noble Queen: now and ever&#x2014;and so may God help us.&#x2014; Yours ever</salute></closer> <name>T.

I went on Tuesday to Dumfries; R<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Calvert and some Cousins were coming here to dine, wherefore Mother and I resolved to abscond: I drove her over to Gill; left her there, and took the train to Dumfries; next day Jean came along with me, as anticipated, to join our Mother; and we all came handsomely home hither a little after sunset. My Mother, who <supplied>[had]</supplied><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> been pretty well again <pb id="pg-26-166" n="26:166"/>before going away, seemed at least to have suffered no damage in body, and in mind of course she was enlivened by the sight of the sunny outer world and the attentions of her <foreign>Bairns</foreign>. I never saw nicer weather: clear cold nights, clear as metal; mist in the morning when I walk, which soon brightens into victorious sunshine often almost windless. Crops all fair; <hi rend="italic">except</hi> nearly totally the potatoes which are rotting rapidly everywhere, as either the eye or the very nose will teach. Very <hi rend="italic">few</hi> of them are on this ground, happily (Oh such hateful <hi rend="italic">paper!</hi>&#x2014;)&#x2014; Jean is to stay with us till Monday: she is now with my Mother, who, poor feeble old Mother, is again complaining today; and tho&#x2019; decidedly better than she was a few hours ago still keeps her bed since breakfast &#x201C;reading <hi rend="italic">Haliburton</hi>,&#x201C;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably a work by Thomas Halyburton (<date when="1674">1674</date>&#x2013;<date when="1712">1712</date>), theologian.</note> or some such work! She is not very ill you may infer; and we all think she will be better tomorrow. Yesterday, <hi rend="italic">till</hi> the afternoon, she was particularly well, and had even touches of jocosity in her,&#x2014;the good old Mother. For example, I found her about to bring up a bucket of coals; I took the bucket and she followed me; on entering she said to Jean <supplied>[who]</supplied><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> was ironing: &#x201C;We ha&#x2019; gotten a bit boy to carry the coals and the like o&#x2019; that, ye see!&#x201C;&#x2014; &#x2014; Do not forget to bring a few Irish &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Repeal</hi> Pipes&#x201C;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A short-stemmed Irish clay pipe, called a cutty pipe or dudheen.</note> for her when you come.</p>
<p>Yesterday we had a collision of trains at the Galls station; about 3&#xBD; o&#x2019;clock, goods train getting <hi rend="italic">shunted</hi> irregular excursion train dashed itself, (from Carlisle) suddenly into it; both engines broken and various carriages; great many people hurt, none killed: such was Jamie&#x2019;s report, gathered as he passed the place last night from Annan.&#x2014; Can you tell me the eligible route to Manchester? Not by express; for I have had enough of that,&#x2014;at least to London or for such lengths of road. I heard from Jane on Tuesday morning; wrote to her from Dumfries; suppose she is now settling with the Alderley people what day we are to come. I rather think it sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be <hi rend="italic">early</hi> next week, and that about the end of the week we sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> aim towards Chelsea again. I do not sleep here (owing to the <hi rend="italic">inner</hi> elements not the outer); nevertheless I have still the feeling that there is a fund of improvement lying unliquidated within me; that perhaps I have <hi rend="italic">not</hi> quite lost my water cure after all.&#x2014; &#x2014; Grahame was here one day; bored me nearly to death, and yet was so very innocent and good.

<salute>My dearest (Miss) Blanche</salute>
<p>I have been here, within so few miles of you, for the last ten days, and have not communicated the mighty fact, out of a <hi rend="italic">certain</hi> sense of shame! I <hi rend="italic">do</hi> feel so ashamed always, to go on talking vaguely, about and about, a purpose instead of going a-head in it, practically, like a woman that knows what she would be at&#x2014; But it is one of the objections to being the wife of a man of Genius that one has to do a great deal of <hi rend="italic">meandering in The vague;</hi> however one&#x2019;s natural tendencies may be toward the <hi rend="italic">Postive!</hi> M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C has such a passion for what he calls &#x201C;leaving things <hi rend="italic">open</hi>&#x201C;&#x2014;to be prosecuted or not according to the course of circumstances, and the humour of the hour!&#x2014; So in the present instance; he parted from me at Liverpool on Monday gone a week, without the least hint when he would return from Scotland&#x2014;his first letter from Scotland was entirely devoted to an elaborate account of <hi rend="italic">the losing of his luggage</hi>&#x2014;the second letter contained the particulars of it&#x2019;s (the portmanteau&#x2019;s) recovery&#x2014;with much good advice to <hi rend="italic">me;</hi> that I was to &#x201C;be careful always to travel with my name and address on my luggage&#x201C;!&#x2014;but still not a word of the visit to Alderly or the appointment at Paris&#x2014; Only this morning he writes that he &#x201C;thinks of&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">perhaps</hi>&#x2014;returning southward early next week&#x201C; and that I must &#x201C;ascertain the state of matters at Alderly&#x2014;whether they will have us there for <hi rend="italic">three</hi> or <hi rend="italic">four</hi> days about that time&#x201C;&#x2014; Now, my Dear, I assure you I could, with the greatest satisfaction box his ears&#x2014;&#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Great Thinker</hi>&#x201C; as is! for I am sure he has made a mess of a very pleasant thing, and that this much talked of meeting cannot now come off at all having been put off, and dawdled over, and &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">left open</hi>&#x201C;&#x2014;till within so short a time of your marriage, that it cannot possibly be convenient for you&#x2014; Before we left Malvern, I endeavoured to impress on his mind the great fact contained in Lady Stanley&#x2019;s kind note that you were to be married on the 22<hi rend="italic">d</hi>&#x2014; But he must have forgotten the day, when he speaks coolly of going to Alderly next week&#x2014;or he must think that being married is a quite simple affair making no difference in the habits and feelings of those concerned&#x2014; You will write to me however by return of post?&#x2014;will you not? like a dear good Blanche as I have always found you&#x2014;and tell me if we may still go over to Alderly to see you&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">without <pb id="pg-26-168" n="26:168"/>staying</hi>&#x2014;when that must manifestly be inconvenient&#x2014; But we could go over, leaving our luggage here&#x2014;and spend a few hours and return to Manchester to sleep&#x2014; Say without the slightest hesitation which way Lady Stanley and you would have it&#x2014; If you have too many <hi rend="italic">natural</hi> friends about you preparatory to your marriage&#x2014;and are too much occupied with it for sparing even an hour or so to extraneous characters like us; we shall take all the blame of not seeing you at this time to ourselves&#x2014;and look forward to meeting you elsewhere&#x2014;or perhaps even at Alderly another year<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On a copy of the letter by Lady Airlie is a note: &#x201C;They came to Alderley just before my marriage which took place <date when="1851-09-23">Sept. 23. 1851</date>&#x201C; (Copy of MS: Mrs. E.

<p>I regret now that I did not, immediately on arriving here, offer to go to you myself&#x2014;without waiting for the slow maturing of Mr C&#x2019;s purposes&#x2014;but I am always very shy of venturing&#x2014;what shall I say?&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">out of my sphere&#x2014;on my own basis</hi>&#x2014;even at the prompting of a real feeling of affection&#x2014;</p>

<p>There never was such a Postman! His morning delivery varies from nine till half after ten! Yesterday it was half after ten when he brought your letter;&#x2014;after I had lost all hope of it, and was beginning to think; could it be that you were fallen ill?&#x2014;and, with this incipient fear threatening to spoil my day&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">lark</hi>, was stepping into a cab, according to programme to be ultimately conveyed by railway &#x201C;thro the prettiest scenery in all Lancashire&#x201C; to Burnley<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >22 mi. N of Manchester.</note>&#x2014; &#x2014; When I had read the letter I wished that I had not been going for an hour at least that I might first have written to Blanche&#x2014;but a carriage, or to speak with truthful modesty, an old gig was to be in waiting for us at the Burnley Station, and a dinner waiting for us, a mile or two beyond&#x2014;so without disappointing and provoking various persons, there was no delaying&#x2014;and as we did not get home till eleven at night the letter to Blanche has only got written this morning.&#x2014; (Oh these pens of Geraldines!) I have begged her however to answer by return of post&#x2014; As it is now so near upon her marriage&#x2014;(on the 22<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Lady Stanley said it was to come off) I judged it best to express the strongest doubts of its being convenient for them to receive us for even the shortest number of <hi rend="italic">days</hi>&#x2014;but offered to come over, <hi rend="italic">without luggage</hi>, and spend a part <pb id="pg-26-169" n="26:169"/>of a day with them if they had still leisure to see us on that principle&#x2014; It is possible they may have their house full of the mutual relations&#x2014;and if otherwise they can renew their invitation&#x2014;but it was best not to put <hi rend="italic">them</hi> to the awkwardness of saying they did not want us at this time&#x2014;</p>
<p>I am very sorry to hear of your rushing down into coffee and castor so soon&#x2014;and an amount of <hi rend="italic">smoking</hi> I dare say!&#x2014;for me; I can tell you with a little &#x201C;proud Pharasee&#x201C; feeling,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Luke 18:11.</note> that I have not&#x2014;&#x201C;what shall I say?&#x201C;&#x2014;swallowed a pill since I left Malvern!!!&#x2014;and I am alive, and <hi rend="italic">rather well</hi>&#x2014; &#x2014; But then my life otherwise is so very wholesome&#x2014;nice little railway excursions almost every day&#x2014;nice <hi rend="italic">country</hi> dinners at two o&#x2019;clock&#x2014;everybody so fond of me!&#x2014;and Geraldine guarding me from all sorts of &#x201C;mental agony with my own inside,&#x201C; telling me Tales of Manchester life&#x2014;much better than her novels&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">rubbing my feet</hi> at every leisure moment and taking as much fond trouble with me as if I were her own little red infant&#x2014;</p>
<p>It is great fun too visiting these primeval Cotton spinners with &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Parlour kitchens</hi>&#x201C; and bare-headed servant maids&#x2014;so overflowing with fervent hospitality&#x2014;and in the profoundest darkness about my Husband&#x2019;s &#x201C;Literary reputation&#x201C;&#x2014; I have a great deal to tell about these people but it is needless to waste time in writing that sort of thing&#x2014; But one thing of another sort, belonging to our <hi rend="italic">natural sphere</hi> I must tell you so long as I remember&#x2014;that Espinasse has&#x2014;renounced his allegiance to you! When his Father<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Fran&#x26;ccedil;ois Espinasse.</note> was in London lately, he (the Father anything but an admirer of yours) was greatly charmed to hear his son declare that he had &#x201C;quite changed his views about Carlyle&#x2014;and was no longer blind to his many and great faults&#x201C; whereon the Espinasse Father in a transport of gratitude to Heaven for a <hi rend="italic">saved</hi> &#x201C;insipid offspring&#x201C; pulled out&#x2014;a five pound note! and made Espinasse a present of it&#x2014; Espinasse, thanking his Father, then went on to say that, &#x201C;he no longer liked <hi rend="italic">Mrs</hi> Carlyle either&#x2014;that he believed her an excellent woman once&#x2014;but she had grown more and more into Carlyle&#x2019;s likeness, until there was no enduring her&#x201C;! The Father however did not again open his purse!&#x2014; Store Smith,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Stores Smith.</note> who was present, is the authority for this charming little history&#x2014;which has amused Espinasse&#x2019;s enemies here very much&#x2014;</p>
<p>M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Gaskell took Geraldine and me a beautiful drive the other day &#x201C;in a friends carriage&#x201C;&#x2014; She is a very kind cheery woman in her own house but there is an atmosphere of moral dullness about her, as about all Socinian women&#x2014; I am thinking whether it would not be expedient however to ask <hi rend="italic">her</hi> to give <hi rend="italic">you</hi> a bed when you come&#x2014;she would be &#x201C;proud and happy&#x201C; I guess&#x2014;and you do not wish to sleep at Geraldine&#x2019;s&#x2014;besides that mine is the <pb id="pg-26-170" n="26:170"/>only spare-room furnished&#x2014; The Gaskell house is very large and in the midst of a shrubbery and quite near this&#x2014;</p>
<p>Kind love to your Mother and the rest&#x2014;I had a parcel of letters from Chelsea&#x2014;round by Liverpool&#x2014;where Mary had coolly kept them three days&#x2014; Miss Farrer, M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> John Stodart and the marriage cards of M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> and M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> John Allan Braun<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jemima Henrietta, b.

The Brauns are unidentified.</note>&#x2014;Heaven knows who these are!&#x2014;the post mark was Rothsay&#x2014;</p>
<p>Nero is the happiest of dogs goes all the journeys by railway&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">smuggled</hi> with the utmost ease&#x2014;and has run many hundreds of miles after the little Lancashire birds&#x2014;</p>

<p>It is all right and wise, dear Goody, all this that you have written to Blanche; and I am delighted to hear that you get along so royally where you are, and am heartily obliged to Geraldine and the others who contrive to procure you a few merry days in this world so much of which is sad and heavy. Not a merry world at all, generally speaking! Nevertheless there do occur little resting places here and there; and it is the part of a good citizen of this Universe to take these also with thankfulness, and make the most of them.</p>
<p>We got home hither at the due hour, and have had the equablest existence ever since; broken only by one&#x2019;s own sleeplessness perhaps, or little flaws of illness which quite overset my poor old Mother from time to time. Good old woman, she says again today when she heard your letter read, &#x201C;I wad ha&#x2019; liked weel to see Jane ance mair!&#x201C;&#x2014; Nothing can be more pathetic, sad yet beautiful, than the going out of a dear life in this manner. The thing I have feared all my days, behold, it is at hand; none can stay it, or turn it back! Life has other <pb id="pg-26-171" n="26:171"/>things in it than treacle and philanthropy, I am well persuaded this long while back.&#x2014;&#x2014; Jean continues with us till Monday; after which I am understood to be in readiness for my own journey, and not likely to linger at all. Brightest silent weather, closed lips (when attainable) and stupid Books (Lyle&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Geology</hi> my grandest at present)<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charles Lyell, <hi rend="italic">Principles of Geology</hi>, 3 vols. (<date when="1830">1830</date>&#x2013;<date when="1833">33</date>), 4 vols. (<date when="1834">1834</date>).</note> are the resources I command. Unutterable thoughts and ruminations are not excluded, especially when one wakes in the night, which is still sometimes my course. But on the whole, I do profess to feel rather better; I bathe and walk every morning, have yet taken <hi rend="italic">no</hi> pills (nothing but my castor once), find (in spite of Gully) coffee to be really useful just at present; and do not <hi rend="italic">exceed</hi> either in it or tobacco,&#x2014;for the rest, have not yet, definitely any account to render of the net sum-total that may lie in water-cure; but imagine that, except the walk after the morning&#x2019;s bathe, they will for me <hi rend="italic">approach</hi> to zero. Very well!&#x2014; &#x2014; Garthwaite brought my clothes two nights ago: tolerably fair, all, <hi rend="italic">except</hi> the waistcoat buttons, two sets, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> were palpably gigantic and intolerable; the poor soul was to ransack <hi rend="italic">Annan</hi> yesterday for something suitabler, and tonight I shall have another weary bout with him. Heigho! Silence and Nothing at all were so much welcomer,&#x2014;sluggard that I am.</p>
<p>That is a grand scene that of the two Espinasses: but E. senior should have covered his first note with a ten-pounder at mention of your name in the forbidden category! On the whole, I do not believe little E. has fundamentally changed his allegiance at all (which he is so inexpressibly welcome to do whenever it will help him in any way); but he is full of spleen and perversity of humour; and could say like Goethe&#x2019;s bigger friend &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Auch in Gott entdeck&#x2019; ich Fehler</hi></foreign> [Even in God too I discover faults],&#x201C;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Untraced.</note> when he is in these moods. Besides I suppose the little wretch was angry that I took no notice at all of his letter or &#x201C;Life&#x201C; of me (bless the mark);<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lucian Paul [Espinasse&#x2019;s pseud.], &#x201C;Thomas Carlyle,&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">The Critic</hi> n.s. 10 (<date when="1851-06-14">14 June 1851</date>):276&#x2013;78.</note> and in short&#x2014; Oh dear, oh dear, who knows what <hi rend="italic">copperas</hi> element a human creature has to live in here below!</p>
<p>Along with your Letter came that Note today: it will be incredible to you that I opened yours first,&#x2014;will it not? But on the whole the Paris business becomes stringent, and I know not what to say! I hope Blanche will make no delay in writing; for then at least the whole case will lie clear upon the counter for computation. Any day after Monday I am ready (I think) for Lancashire; but if the Paris time extend only to &#x201C;10 days,&#x201C; it seems about as good as <hi rend="italic">up</hi> for this bout! I must write however and keep it still open till we hear.&#x2014;&#x2014; What to say of <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi> in Manchester I know not: one night is all I contemplate<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Here TC adds a note: &#x201C;(to the begin<hi rend="italic">g</hi>&#x2014;invert)&#x201C;; i.e., return to the first page.</note> and that is likely enough to be broken and a failure try it where <pb id="pg-26-172" n="26:172"/>I may. A mattrass on the Jewsbury floor, a bed in the nearest inn, truly it matters not; only I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> like to be rather well let alone after my day&#x2019;s tumble perhaps. Does Geraldine know Hereford the Coroner and his Antipauper Society?<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edward Herford; see <ref target="volume-25/lt-18500120-TC-EH-01"><sic>25:6&#x2013;8</sic><corr>TC to EH, <date when="1850-01-20">20 Jan. 1850</date></corr></ref>.</note> I could like to see him (if we had time) on the morrow. He is in Glasgow, but <hi rend="italic">is</hi> to be in Man<hi rend="italic">r</hi> again: there is his address (with a curious note on the <hi rend="italic">other</hi> side); pray keep the paper till I come, any way.</p>
<p>Of Mary Barton (i.e. the bodily Mary) and her spouse<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Elizabeth and William Gaskell.</note> I think precisely as you do: dull he, very dull I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> believe; and how far it is good to get into hospitalities with the dull? But I will leave you altogether to decide;&#x2014;and add only that a clean bed anywhere will suffice for one night.</p>
<p><closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign> dear little Goody; I send my regards even to Nero, and wish Geraldine were better. <foreign>Adieu</foreign>, Dearest</salute></closer>.</p>

<p>The kind little slip of paper, dated &#x201C;Interlachen 8<hi rend="italic">th</hi>&#x201C; last, came to hand this day; a thousand thanks for it: to my poor weak imagination it has been a wonderful solace. I answer, in great haste, but without delay, tho&#x2019; there is still nothing more to be said since the vague story I wrote two days ago, which probably they have forwarded from Bath House: either it or this or both of them ought to be &#x201C;waiting&#x201C;; and if you come on Monday, there is not a post to spare. How one&#x2019;s poor mind, in sick humours, does go wandering! You shew me, very unconsciously you, the solid rocks and firm foundations again, and spectral vapours settle into what they are:&#x2014;and I am much happier already, let Paris go as it will. Oh, my Lady&#x2014;But we will say nothing; at present nothing, perhaps forever nothing, tho&#x2019; I suppose you too can read it well enough unsaid.&#x2014; How strange, since (as Dr Gully says) we are made almost altogether of <hi rend="italic">water</hi> (hardly a 20<hi rend="italic">th</hi> part of us solid matter, and that mostly <hi rend="italic">lime, magnesia</hi> and the like) that human creatures should be so important to one another!&#x2014; But, in all ways, whether of water or not, we are fearfully and wonderfully <hi rend="italic">made.</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ps. 139:14.</note> And some of us are very well made too; and are inexpressibly <pb id="pg-26-173" n="26:173"/>beautiful and good,&#x2014;and were made in Heaven, the essence of them, I do believe!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Today I learn from Jane that she had addressed herself to Blanche at Alderley for light about our four days there,&#x2014;&#x201C;four days next week,&#x201C;&#x2014;or rather she has with delicate propriety insinuated that as the wedding is so near, might not a flying visit of one day <hi rend="italic">without</hi> night, from herself, while now in the neighbourhood, be the more appropriate method? No answer had yet had time to come, owing to mistakes, but was hourly expected: if it be in favour of the half-day plan, it will be well for Paris and me! But I shall not know till probably Monday:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC is writing on Sat.</note>&#x2014;and in the meantime what can I say? Yes, what! Any day after Monday I hold myself in readiness to start from this; but if Alderley do lie in the road, we are at the end of the week before reaching Chelsea; and of your &#x201C;ten days&#x201C; how many are gone before I <hi rend="italic">could</hi> be with you? At the most only some 4 left to me after such a whirl on railways. Alas, alas!&#x2014; You need not at any rate make any provision of room for me till you hear farther: in any and every case, one bedroom (the nearer the garret the quieter I suppose) is all that M. Caillet<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> could do for me; and that is probably always attainable. But on the whole, the 4 days,&#x2014;does not that of itself say no to the enterprise? If there be but four days. Certain it is, moreover, that in Paris there will simply be one human soul whom I want to be in sight of,&#x2014;the rest without exception I had fully rather not be in sight of;&#x2014;and this invaluable unit shall I not see this one in a day or two by simply staying where I am? You will have to be at Addiscombe, will you not? A day or two at Addiscombe (<hi rend="italic">were</hi> all else equal), how much pleasanter than Paris with its unmelodious noises and inanities! And yet, and yet&#x2014; On the whole, will you write again, whenever you do come, and have fixed approximately as to times; direct to <hi rend="italic">Chelsea</hi> as the surest: by the time I see that, my decision <hi rend="italic">will</hi> at last be positive,&#x2014;and I shall have another word with you at any rate by that method.&#x2014; You will see Cavaignac at any rate, I hope?<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Gen. Louis Eug&#xE8;ne Cavaignac.</note> Pray also give my real regards to Lady Sandwich:<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The dowager countess of Sandwich.</note> a good Lady whom I honour in several essential respects, and cordially wish well to. Oh, be good to her! You will find no other altogether like her in this world. And a day will come, a sad day, when all your tolerances will be great possessions to you.</p>
<p>Thanks for the scarf to Jane, a thousand thank<supplied>[s]</supplied><note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> O noble woman. You are good and royal; and to me when I think of everything the most miraculous being (or nearly so) that has been created in these epochs.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-26-174" n="26:174"/>So soon as the Alderley news come, I will write a word again; at latest, so soon as your Chelsea Letter<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably of <date when="1851-09-10">10 Sept.</date>, sent to Chelsea to be forwarded, in which she said that they would reach Paris, <date when="1851-09-18">18 Sept.</date>, and could have things ready for TC by the next day.</note> (which will be forwarded if needful) comes to hand. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, and blessings on you</salute></closer></p>

<p>Here is Lady Stanley&#x2019;s note,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lady Stanley wrote, <date when="1851-09-13">13 Sept.</date>: &#x201C;[W]e shall be very glad indeed to see you &#x26; Mr Carlyle as early in the week as possible &#x26; we shall be happy if you can stay with us till Friday on which day we expect what you call natural friends&#x2014;but till then we shall only be too pleased to have you&#x2014;.&#x201C; Blanche Stanley added a note saying she was delighted &#x201C;at the thought of seeing you. &#x2026; do come as soon as possible.&#x201C;</note> just come along with yours both&#x2014;read in bed at a rather advanced hour of the day! Geraldine&#x2019;s servants having thought it a pity to disturb me by bringing up my letters, and I taking it for granted there were none, since none appeared&#x2014; The fact is, that we are all ill here and that every thing is rushing down into chaos!&#x2014; Yesterday I rose with a headach which in the afternoon got complicated with sore-throat I was very ill all night, and thought that I should probably <hi rend="italic">die without seeing you again!</hi> But when old Peggy had given me some breakfast in bed; I perceived that little was really the matter with me, only a cold in the head which I had certainly myself to blame for&#x2014; Geraldine and Frank had also to breakfast in bed&#x2014;and so the letters were kept below&#x2014;I only got them at twelve and I jumped up instantly, to answer them by the first post&#x2014;had a frantic purpose of rushing in to town by Omnibus in the state I was in&#x2014;to post a letter for you into the General Post office before 2&#x2014;! But the image of Simon Brodie<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A Scots nursery rhyme TC often used when giving autographs: &#x201C;Simon Brodie had a cow; / He lost his cow, and he could na find her: / When he had done what man could do, / The cow cam hame and her tail behind her.&#x201C; See <hi rend="italic">The Collected Poems of Thomas and Jane Carlyle</hi>, ed. R. L. Tarr and F. McClelland (Greenwood, Fla., <date when="1986">1986</date>) 73.</note> rose before me&#x2014;and I considered that in the first place such haste was <hi rend="italic">impossible</hi> and in the second place that it was <hi rend="italic">useless</hi>&#x2014;as the letter could not reach Scotsbrig much sooner for arriving at Ecclefechan in the middle of the night!

<p>The pen is excellent, but has not had any justice done to it&#x2014; How do you come to have got buttons <hi rend="italic">there</hi> when I sent you very nice ones?&#x2014;</p>
<p>Love to your Mother and the rest&#x2014;I dreamt last night that I had gone home to Haddington to see <hi rend="italic">my</hi> Mother&#x2014;and found a good fire and tea all set out, with a sort of purple-coloured draps<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably for &#x201C;drapes.&#x201C;</note> we once had (which I have not remembered these twenty years) but she did not come&#x2014;and I sat waiting and waiting till it slowly came over me that she was dead, and I awoke myself with a cry&#x2014;to find my head splitting and my throat refusing to swallow&#x2014; In short I had best write no more today&#x2014;</p>

<p><salute>My poor little Jeannie,&#x2014;</salute>What a miserable business that of the headache, cold, and all manner of confusions coming on us in a heap! And that stern Dream!&#x2014;My poor little Goody!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I am writing by candle-light, and have to send the Note by express; all things being in such a heap of hurries this day&#x2014; I was on the road with Jean to Gill, hardly expecting a Letter from you, when we did pick up the missive; I had to take instant measures, at Ecclefechan, for ascertaining even the Train that w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> take me; Jamie Aitken too was waiting at Gill: the day was hot and close;&#x2014;in short, I am just got home again; and have all my packing and <hi rend="italic">etceteras</hi> work to do. My first thought was to stay <hi rend="italic">here</hi> till Wednesday; and appoint <hi rend="italic">you</hi> to meet me at the Manchester Station, and so run right thro&#x2019; to Alderley: however I find tomorrow (Tuesday) is the monition of human valour; <pb id="pg-26-176" n="26:176"/>besides I am so tumbled up I shall get no rest now by staying here, and they are well prepared for my going. Off therefore!</p>
<p>My train is the Express tomorrow, at 2 p.m. from Carlisle; arrives in Manchester 25 min. past 5 (say 6 p.m.): <hi rend="italic">two</hi> stations you have;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Victoria and Piccadilly.</note> I partly by guess will prefer the one called &#x201C;Victoria Street&#x201C; as nearer you: sometimes towards 6 off or on, you will see me if all go well. &#x201C;Dinner or not dinner&#x201C; lies with the Fates and Railway guards; but if old Peggy will have <hi rend="italic">one</hi> mutton-chop ready for doing, I will eat a bit of bread to it, and despise all other dining. Sleep, in the Gaskell house, must go as it can.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Elizabeth Gaskell told her da., [<date when="1851-09-19">19 Sept.</date>], that &#x201C;Mr Carlyle offered to come to us for a night or two on his way from Scotland&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Letters of Mrs. Gaskell</hi> 162).</note>&#x2014; <hi rend="italic">Can</hi> I see Hereford think you on the morrow. Best not bother about it. On the whole never mind it. Bid the helpful Frank (if his cold have so far abated) find you out the Alderley train: we <hi rend="italic">need</hi> not hurry; dinner (say 7 p.m.) is our only rigid limit.</p>
<p>No button ever reached us here, not the shadow of one! I suppose the parcel must have burst open and scattered itself. Who knows? T. G.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Tom Garthwaite.</note> the indefatigable tailor did otherwise the best he could.</p>
<p>Along with your Note today came this from Jenny. A good cheery Letter from the poor little soul. Pray, having read it, send it straightway on to John,&#x2014;whose Letter (with account of the trains &#x26;c) may be expected here tomorrow about 20 min after I am <hi rend="italic">gone.</hi> Tell him that he seems to be much wanted here, by our poor old Mother, and by many others in a less degree. Poor old Mother, she is really very feeble; and my heart is as sore as it can be on her account,&#x2014;a sad, inexorable tale, which has been and will be told, to all men!&#x2014; Let me flatter myself she will be a little better when once I am <hi rend="italic">off</hi>, and all things quiet again. The good old Mother, she comes in to charge me specially to send you her love, her wish that she could see Jane once again.</p>

<p><salute>My dear Mother,&#x2014;</salute>Having five minutes to spare, I write a word to give you assurance that we are safe thus far. I got on without any kind of misventure yesterday, but only with the usual confused jumblings and whistlings and total want of all free will; and reached Manchester nearly an hour after my time; heartily glad to get to rest again and out of the belly of my sad machine. Jane and the two Jewsbury&#x2019;s here were still labouring under cold, but did their best for my entertainment; I got an excellent quiet bed, a fair average proportion of sleep: Jane is not <hi rend="italic">worse</hi> this morning; and now, after reposing long enough, we are about taking the road for Alderley Park (only 28 miles of railway), where we are to arrive about 3.

<p><salute>Dear Jean,&#x2014;</salute>Take half a word, written in the extremity of hurry, merely to say that we have got safe home, without accident of any kind, tho&#x2019; unutterably wearied and jumbled; and found Jack here, with a wholesome dinner, yesterday (Friday) evening, and all other pertinents of our Chelsea home in as fair a state as could be reasonably desired. I went off on Tuesday morning, according to purpose when I left you; our poor old Mother was perceptibly better on my return from Gill, and continued afoot next morning, behaving very gallantly till I went away: the tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> of her in her weak and weary state of old age is my constant attendant ever since; and weighs sadly on my heart,&#x2014;if I knew where any help lay! But there is none or little. John will be home again, I hope, in not many days; and that is nearly all that we can anticipate at present. Poor old Mother, she has worked faithfully for us; it is well our part to do whatsoever we can for her, every one of us!</p>
<p>Jane was not very well when I got to Manchester, after a dreary enough day from Scotsbrig: the cold she spoke of is even yet not quite gone. We got out, however, to &#x201C;Alderley Park,&#x201C; our country destination next day, after <foreign><hi rend="italic">hubbling</hi></foreign> enough; found all the people there as kind as could be,&#x2014;but gone nearly <hi rend="italic">mad</hi>, the greater part of them with the approaching uproar of the daughter&#x2019;s marriage. Marriage to an Earl,&#x2014;Heigho! Lord Stanley himself however who is a really clever man was sufficiently cool upon the business, and he and I had some pleasant talk at odd hours. But as to sleep, as to &#x26;c &#x26;c&#x2014;it was, with the journey following it, wholly a jumble and tumble of unutterable confusions; out of which one thanks Heaven that one is at last fairly delivered!

<salute>Dear Sirs,</salute>
<p>I am well pleased with your Letter; and obliged to you for the interest you take in the Writings I have sent abroad into the Public. The &#x201C;Suggestion&#x201C; you <pb id="pg-26-179" n="26:179"/>make has been offered me by various friends in late years; and I have, on more than one occasion, forwarded the same to my Bookseller for a practical response: but he, doubtful of the commercial results, answers hitherto always by a negative. Not having myself any pretensions to insight into such a subject, I am well content to leave it in his hands, to whom it officially belongs. If as you say the world <hi rend="italic">is</hi>, at second or third hand, getting acquainted with the small message I had to tell them in this noisy generation, then it is really all right with them in that particular, or tolerably nearly so, and with me, too,&#x2014;and we may safely leave it to the Booksellers or the Fates to do as they choose with the rest of the question.</p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Unluckily I have just quitted your and my own Border Country; and, since last night, instead of being some 20 miles, am now 300 distant from you; so that any reasonable possibility of paying you a visit is at an end for the present. You need not doubt that your Institution has my best wishes, if those were good for anything; or that a much more serious service than this you now do me honour to ask would be a duty and a pleasure to me, could it really forward your intrinsic objects in proportion, or at all. But that is not the case in this instance; and, so in the meantime, I have nothing but friendly wishes and regrets to offer.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC&#x2019;s letter was read out at the opening series of lectures at the Lord St. Working Men&#x2019;s Reading Room, <date when="1851-12-01">1 Dec.</date>, as was Dickens&#x2019;s (see <hi rend="italic">DL</hi> 6:510n).</note></p>
<p>After all, it is not by speaking visitors and transient strangers, however wise and well-disposed, that any benefit can be done you; it is only by the Wisdom daily present and busy among you that your Institution can be wisely guided and have good success: and I have remarked that the merely <hi rend="italic">speaking</hi> figures, in such cases, yield little permanent help, and often even none, or <hi rend="italic">less</hi> than none (if we compute it rightly); that the helper who will help steadfastly in <hi rend="italic">silence</hi>, and with continuous loyalty exist himself by the <hi rend="italic">silent</hi> methods, is <pb id="pg-26-180" n="26:180"/>the only profitable one in the long run. I hope there are many such among you; and that by degrees your Reading-room (furnished with <hi rend="italic">good</hi> and wise Books, not with <hi rend="italic">bad</hi> and foolish ones, which are worse than none) may become the rallying-point of all the sincere and serious-minded Workers in Carlisle, that they may try there with their best skill what <hi rend="italic">can</hi> be achieved towards self-culture (the true aim of every human soul) by honest cooperation in this kind.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henry Morley, &#x201C;The Labourer&#x2019;s Reading Room,&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">Household Words</hi>, <date when="1851-09-13">13 Sept.</date>, had described the room and questioned whether it was the first of its kind. The <hi rend="italic">Carlisle Journal</hi>, <date when="1851-09-26">26 Sept.</date>, reprinted part of Morley&#x2019;s article and challenged him to point to an earlier one.</note></p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>On Saturday night we got Isabella&#x2019;s little Note, which was a great comfort to us, for which we are much obliged to her. It was among my consolations that morning, that probably you might get a little better when left altogether in quiet. John will be home in the course of this week, I think, and then I shall be able to fancy you as in a more protected situation. He talks of getting over one of the Austin lasses, this winter, to light the fires, to sweep and wash for you; a plan which I hope you too will find feasible and advantageous. He is in possession of my notions about it; understands sufficiently how glad I should be to contribute in any way to any arrangement whatever that could do you a little good, were it even a very little. Oh, my dear Mother, you well deserve it of me, and of all of us; and I hope we know that well.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-26-181" n="26:181"/>Jack wrote to you on Saturday, or I would have written. I wrote a short Note to Jean; I had varieties of letters to write. The <hi rend="italic">Leader</hi>, I conclude, has come to you today: that was by mistake, and inattention to the orders given:&#x2014;however, if Isabella will address it to Alick, we have <hi rend="italic">seen</hi> the paper here, and it will be all right still. I write an address and enclose it here; it has merely to be wrapt round the Paper, and put into the Post-office. Next week we shall take better care.</p>
<p>We had two rather restless days among the Stanleys and their high quality at Alderley. Everybody was as kind to us as people could be: but all was going topsyturvy, the grand wedding being just at hand (takes place <hi rend="italic">tomorrow</hi>, Tuesday); and in particular, the mother (Lady Stanley, a Beauty once, and a really good soul always) and the young Damsel herself were almost out of their wits; &#x201C;quite carried.&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">Sleep</hi> was a scarce article with me, still scarcer with poor Jane; there was no rest for anybody in <hi rend="italic">those</hi> &#x201C;marble Halls&#x201C;!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alfred Bunn, &#x201C;I dreamt that I dwelt in marble halls,&#x201C; from <hi rend="italic">The Bohemian Girl</hi>.</note> On the whole however we did very well; I had some nice friendly talk with the Master of the House, who is a clever man, and much attached to me for such a man; a nice ride one day,&#x2014;a rank <hi rend="italic">grassy</hi> country, full of trees meadows and water-pools; all going upon &#x201C;Cheshire cheese,&#x201C;&#x2014;the little harvest they had was not more forward than about Hoddam;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The district round Ecclefechan.</note> the potatoes fairly <hi rend="italic">half</hi> gone. Next morning we were handsomely forwarded (Friday at 10 o&#x2019;clock) to the nearest Station (only a mile or two off); got into a nice carriage not too crowded, and &#x201C;the best train of the line&#x201C; (says Jack), and in six hours more were fairly on London pavement again, without accident of any kind whatever. Jack was looking blithe and well; an excellent wholesome dinner stood ready; and all was <hi rend="italic">well</hi>, or as well as we could hope to find it; and great room for <hi rend="italic">thankfulness</hi> on all sides of us here.

<p>I hope you got safe to Darfield,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In the W Riding of S Yorkshire, 5 mi. E of Barnsley.</note> and are now comfortably reposing yourself there. I was very <foreign>feckless</foreign> and sick yesterday all day, and much out of spirits about your departure.

<p><salute>Upon my honour dearest Helen you grow decidedly <hi rend="small-caps">good</hi>&#x2014;</salute> Another nice long letter!&#x2014;and the former still unanswered! This is a sort of heaping coals of fire on my head which I should like to have continued&#x2014;</p>
<p>All the time I was in Manchester I <hi rend="italic">aimed</hi> at writing to you&#x2014;even before I got your letter I was wanting to write, to tell you what a hospitable reception we got in Maryland Street&#x2014;and how <hi rend="italic">little</hi> Mary bloomed up in &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">the mantle</hi>&#x2019; of her Progenitors!&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">doing the Hostess</hi> even a little <hi rend="italic">too showy</hi> it seemed to me for she regaled us with desert over and above the necessary viands&#x2014;actually developed herself in a fine dish of Peaches, the extravagant little thing! And then so willing she was to <hi rend="italic">get up</hi> at any hour&#x2014;at four in the morning if we liked&#x2014;her self martyrdom was quite touching&#x2014;in that and several other particulars&#x2014;</p>
<p>I hope M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Macgregor also told you that when Sophy offered me brandy negus on our return from New Brighton<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Macgregor was a relative on Helen Welsh&#x2019;s mother&#x2019;s side, perhaps her uncle. Sophy Welsh, m. to Alexander. New Brighton, a port in the Mersey estuary.</note> I asked to have&#x2014;a shower bath instead!&#x2014;and the first day we called I had a cold plunge bath&#x2014;and washed <pb id="pg-26-184" n="26:184"/>the dogs! What a blessed supply of water they have got besides all their other comforts. It was very provoking to miss Johnnie by so few days&#x2014;</p>
<p>But I must tell you <hi rend="italic">news</hi>&#x2014; &#x2014; Well!&#x2014; I lived very happily at Geraldines for the first week&#x2014;in spite of the horrid dingy atmosphere and substitution of <hi rend="italic">cinder</hi> roads for the green Malvern Hills&#x2014; We made a great many excursions by railway into the cotton vallies&#x2014; Frank selected some cotton spinner in some picturesque locality and wrote or said that he would dine with him on such a day at two o&#x2019;clock and bring his Sister and a Lady staying with him&#x2014; The cotton spinner was most willing!&#x2014;and so we started after breakfast and spent the day in beautiful places amongst strange old world highly hospitable life&#x2014;eating I really thing more homebaked bread and other dainties than was good for us&#x2014;the air and exercise made us so ravenously hungry&#x2014; It was returning from the last of these country visits rather late thro a dense fog that I caught my cold&#x2014;and then came the old sleeplessless nights and headachs and all the abominable <hi rend="italic">eeteras</hi> I was still stuffed full of cold when I had to start for Alderley Park and the days I spent there were, in consequence, supremely wretched; tho&#x2019; the Place is lovely and there was a fine rattling houseful of people&#x2014;and the Stanleys even to Lord S, who is far from popular, as kind as possible&#x2014;alas too kind! for Lady S <hi rend="italic">would</hi> show me all the &#x201C;beautiful views&#x201C; &#x201C;and that sort of thing,&#x201C; out of doors&#x2014;and Blanche <hi rend="italic">would</hi> spend half the night in my bedroom!&#x2014; Lord Airlie was there and his sister<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >There were three Drummond sisters: Jean Graham (<date when="1818">1818</date>&#x2013;<date when="1891">91</date>), Maria Anne (<date when="1827">1827</date>&#x2013;<date when="1893">93</date>), and Helen Susan Catherine Gertrude (<date when="1831">1831</date>&#x2013;<date when="1862">62</date>).</note> and various other assistants at the Marriage&#x2014;and I saw <hi rend="italic">a trousseau</hi> for the first time in my life&#x2014;about as wonderful a piece of nonsense as <hi rend="italic">The Exhibition of All Nations</hi> Good Heavens! how is any one woman to use up all those gowns and cloaks and fine clothes of every denomination? and the profusion of coronets!&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">every</hi> stocking every pocket handkerchief everything had a coronet on it!

<p>My own dear little Jeannie,&#x2014;Here am I at last, not without difficulty, in a condition to send you a word or two of Autobiography: my pen is of the worst, and I have had my own ados to get ink &#x26;c and even a <hi rend="italic">table</hi> (in a room of my own); but let me be content, and proceed with business. It was a luck for you there went no post yesterday; otherwise you would have had a <hi rend="italic">Jeremiad</hi> which may in part be spared today. But first of the first.</p>
<p>The Brownings were just dismounting at London Bridge when I arrived, half and<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS. &#x201C;Fare to Paris, 22<hi rend="italic">s.</hi>, wonderful; thither and back &#x2018;by return ticket&#x2019; was but 1<hi rend="italic">l.</hi> 12<hi rend="italic">s.</hi> according to this route&#x2014;such had been the effect on prices of this &#x2018;Glass Palace,&#x2019; and the crowds attracted towards it. Browning with wife and child and maid; then I; then an empty seat for cloaks and baskets; lastly, at the opposite end from me, a hard-faced, honest Englishman or Scotchman, &#x2026; who &#x2026; proved very harmless and quiet: this was the loading of our carriage,&#x2014;and so away we went, Browning talking very loud and with vivacity, I silent rather, tending towards many thoughts.&#x201C; They travel through green countryside to New haven, where they change to a steamer. &#x201C;Browning managed everything for me &#x2026; . Our company numerous, but not quite a crowd; most French: operations &#x2026; all orderly and quiet. At length, perhaps about half-past one P.M., we got fairly under way. &#x2026; / [O]ur French friends, were full of bustle &#x2026;; but so soon as we got into the sea or British Channel, all this abated, sank into the general sordid torpor of sea-sickness, with <hi rend="italic">its</hi> miserable noises &#x2026; . Browning was sick, lay in one of the bench-tents horizontal, his wife, &#x26;c., below; I was not absolutely sick, but had to lie quite quiet, and without comfort, save in one cigar, for seven or eight hours of blustering, spraying, and occasional rain. &#x2026; At length light houses appeared, and soon &#x2026; Dieppe &#x2026; . H&#xF4;tel de l&#x2019;Europe, near the landing place, proved to be a second-rate hotel; but we got beds, a sitting-room, and towards 10 P.M. some very bad cold tea, and colder coffee&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Last Words</hi> 151&#x2013;55).</note> hour ahead of time: we did all extremely well together (except that <pb id="pg-26-186" n="26:186"/>B<hi rend="italic">g</hi> was a little loudish and talkative beyond need now and then); and certainly such company was a <hi rend="italic">treasure</hi> compared with what one might have had; for Browning <hi rend="italic">couriered</hi> in the most perfect style all the way to Paris, and I had not the least thing to do, but sit still and look about me: An immense advantage in my poor case! Our sea-voyage lasted nearly 8 hours, and did not finish till towards nine at night; very rough and blustery, everybody sick, <hi rend="italic">sick;</hi> even I had to lie perfectly flat, and endure the spray and wet occasionalities, under pain of getting queasy. Then came Custom-house, passports &#x26;c: it was towards 10 p.m. before I got any successor to the breakfast you had given me,&#x2014;again tea, and very different from my poor Jeannie&#x2019;s. How sad and miserable most of my thoughts had been all day I will not tell you: the image of my poor Jeannie, and her downcast mistaken and yet heroic mood was present to me, and has been, and is, as a great black cloud of sorrow and affections, which, is very painful, but which I w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not put away either even if I could!&#x2014; We had stumbled upon a quiet tolerable inn at Dieppe; and I slept beyond expectations (till 4 and then a &#xBD; hour again); the next morning was bright, Dieppe is a fine old Norman town (size of Dumfries or so, and very quaint and notable); our rail to Paris ran thro&#x2019; fine country, and all went right enough with us to the end of the route at 4 p.m.&#x2014;but <hi rend="italic">there</hi> our felicity, at least mine, took leave for some time! Near an hour spent waiting and jangling before we could all get thro&#x2019; the &#x201C;Octroi&#x201C; (kind of <hi rend="italic">Town</hi>-Custom Dues) and fairly out of the railway station; then here nobody to receive me, only concierges and hackney cabmen &#x26;c &#x26;c: both Lord and Lady A. were out, having given me up for 4 o&#x2019;clock train. <foreign>Eheu!</foreign> Happily I wanted nothing, except tobacco, which I had; and&#x2014;some hours afterwards, dinner, with <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi>, which latter I utterly failed of, and could not get at all, at all! Oh my Dear I think a worse enemy than any I ever had w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have been sorry for me that night, could he have gone into the poor heart and inside of me, and seen what I was suffering and doing! Enough, I did not sleep one wink, from 11 till 7 that I tried;&#x2014;I was at the top of the House but in a front room, looking out over a street equivalent to the Parisian Piccadilly; and the horrors were manifold! I think you never saw such a room,&#x2014;or such a bed, with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> vestige of curtain <hi rend="italic">&#x26;</hi>c;&#x2014;I had in fact a horrible night; and decided upon one thing, that I w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> stay there no more. Next morning, it was arranged with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> the smallest difficulty that I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> get a nice little back room, really an excellent place, with bed curtains and other such <pb id="pg-26-187" n="26:187"/>conveniences, two floors lower, on the floor where all the rest are: the other misery was mere <hi rend="italic">oversight</hi>,&#x2014;they had understood (at least her Ladyship had) that the &#x201C;noises of the street which are continual w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> disturb me less than the accidental ones from the court,&#x201C; and so I was put there for my good! In fact this H&#xF4;tel, by far the dearest in Paris, is also I suspect one <supplied>[of]</supplied><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted. Leaving Dieppe, &#x201C;Browning, as before, did everything.&#x201C; Reaching Paris by train at 4 <hi rend="small-caps">p.m.</hi>, they found themselves among &#x201C;a crowding, jingling, vociferous tumult, in which the brave Browning fought for us, leaving me to sit beside the women. &#x2026; I walked out to smoke &#x2026; . Cigar ended, I went in again, Browning still fighting &#x2026; . Our luggage visible at last upon a distant counter, then Browning visible with report of a hackney coach: we think it is now over; rash souls, there is yet endless uproar among the porters, wishing to <hi rend="italic">carry</hi> our luggage on a truck; we won&#x2019;t, they will: even Browning had at last grown heated; at length I do get a cab for myself and little trunk, certain French coins hastily from Browning, and roll away &#x2026; [to] the door of Meurice&#x2019;s in the Rue de Rivoli &#x2026; . I get aloft into my appointed bedroom, &#x2026; a bare fantastic place, looking out into the street&#x2014;bad prospects of <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi>&#x2014;though I am at the very top of the house for that object. Both Lady and Lord have gone out, not finding me at four as covenanted; dinner is to be &#x2018;at six precisely.&#x2019; &#x2026; After dinner to the Th&#xE9;&#xe2;tre Fran&#x26;ccedil;ais &#x2026; . Very bad box, &#x2018;stage-box,&#x2019; close to the actors; full of wind-draughts, where we all took <hi rend="italic">cold</hi> more or less. &#x2026; Pfaugh!&#x2014;the history of the day was done; but upstairs, in my naked, noisy room, began a history of the night, which was much more frightful to me. <foreign>Eheu!</foreign> I have not had such a night these many years, hardly in my life before&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Last Words</hi> 158, 161&#x2013;64).</note> the <hi rend="italic">worst</hi> for real comfort;&#x2014;a bad go altogether, like &#x201C;fashionable houses&#x201C; generally.</p>
<p>However, let me hasten to say that now I actually <hi rend="italic">have</hi> slept, six hours of excell<hi rend="italic">t</hi> deep sleep; and feel vastly better, and glad as if delivered from one considerable woe. My head still aches &#x26;c, and I foresee that I shall do no good in the health way here; but I shall be able to rub on, for the &#x201C;few days&#x201C; it is to last,&#x2014;and indeed I hope they will be rather few, for &#x201C;many&#x201C; such w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be sufficiently intolerable! Nay if sleep again fail I have arranged to fly to Browning&#x2019;s H&#xF4;tel<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Aux Armes de la Ville de Paris, Rue de la Michodi&#xE8;re, Boulevard des Italiens. TC found the Brownings &#x201C;all brisk and well-rested &#x2026; and very sorry for my mischances&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Last Words</hi> 168).</note> where there is a thoroughly quiet little room that I can rent from the people, and so make sure of sleeping. But that necessity, I now hope, will not occur.</p>
<p>Paris is very bright, brisk and beautiful, and everybody here is kind enough to me: only one drawback, I have nothing to <hi rend="italic">do</hi> in Paris except &#x201C;amuse&#x201C; myself; and that I believe might be difficult before long. Both Lord and Lady are unwell at present, the Lady visibly suffering from cold; I think they only stay till Lady Sandwich can arrange herself to go with them,&#x2014;day not yet fixed, nor fixable yet, but &#x201C;soon.&#x201C;&#x2014; &#x2014; All yesterday I lay motionless, only went out in the carriage with L<hi rend="italic">d</hi> A. and <hi rend="italic">sat</hi> while he made calls; Lady A. confined to her room till night. Thiers came at 4, and talked <hi rend="italic">immense</hi> quantities <pb id="pg-26-188" n="26:188"/>of watery enough vain matter; then two other &#x201C;Men of Letters&#x201C; or &#x201C;office&#x201C; one M&#xE9;rim&#xE9;e, one Laborde:<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Louis Adolphe Thiers, Prosper M&#xE9;rim&#xE9;e, and L&#xE9;on Emmanuel Simon Joseph La borde. &#x201C;A little after four Thiers came. I had seen the man before in London [see <ref target="volume-20/lt-18451020-TC-LAAL-01"><sic>20:32</sic><corr>TC to LAAL, <date when="1845-10-20">20 Oct. 1845</date></corr></ref>], and cared not to see him again; but it seemed to be expected I should stay in the room &#x2026; . M. Thiers &#x2026; speaks in a good-humoured treble <hi rend="italic">croak</hi> which hustles itself on in continuous copiousness &#x2026; as even Macaulay cannot rival &#x2026; give you clear and dainty response about anything you ask. Not the least officiality is in his manner; everywhere rather the air of a <foreign><hi rend="italic">bon enfant</hi></foreign>, which I think really (with the addition of <foreign><hi rend="italic">coquin</hi></foreign> [rogue]) must partly be his character! &#x2026; M. Thiers, who could not stay dinner, took himself away. &#x2026; Nothing remained but to &#x2018;dress for dinner,&#x2019; when at seven the two French gentlemen of distinction were expected. / Our two <foreign><hi rend="italic">distinqu&#xE9;s</hi></foreign> were literary: one M&#xE9; rim&#xE9;e, &#x2026; a kind of critic, historian, <hi rend="italic">linguistically</hi> and otherwise of worth; a hard, logical, smooth but utterly barren man (whom I had seen before in London, with little wish for a second course of him); the other a M. Laborde, Syrian traveller; a free-going, jollier, but equally unproductive human soul. Our dinner &#x2026; was dullish,&#x2014;the talk confused, about Papal aggression, &#x26;c.,&#x2014;supported by me in very bad French (unwillingly), and in Protestant sentiments, which seemed very strange to my sceptical friends. &#x2026; At last they went away; and I &#x2026; into bed,&#x2014;where, in few minutes, in spite of noises, there fell on me (thank Heaven!) the gratefullest deep sleep &#x2026; . So ends the history of Saturday, <date when="1851-09-26">26th</date> <date when="1851-09-27">[27th] September</date>&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Last Words</hi> 168&#x2013;72).</note> <foreign><hi rend="italic">nichts zu bedeuten</hi></foreign> [of no importance].

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Here I am safe enough, if not in the best of conditions or with the fruitfullest of outlooks: I hope you, on your side, are now got to Scotsbrig, or will be there tomorrow when this comes, and explain to my Mother how I come here! She, I know, did not want that at all; nor in truth did I, had I consulted laziness alone; but I was in some sort bound to come, and I think it will do me some good, in several respects, over and above.</p>
<p>We had a pleasant enough journey, all except the sea to Dieppe,&#x2014;and surely one of the ch<supplied>[eap]</supplied>est, the whole fare to Paris, in the <hi rend="italic">best</hi> place, being only 22/! Our sail was of 8 hours; a nice little boat, but a &#x201C;knotty&#x201C; sea, and some gusts of brief showers: everybody, almost except myself, was sick, and vomiting, &#x201C;Oh-h-h-h!&#x201C; I smoked one cigar, lying on my side, horizontal; <pb id="pg-26-189" n="26:189"/>and looking at the queer French Exhibition men and women <note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Who had visited the Crystal Palace.</note> whose noisy table got utterly quenched by degrees; one after another breaking into, &#x201C;Hoh&#x2014;h&#x2014;h!&#x201C; and then silence!&#x2014; &#x2014; We had a tolerab<supplied>[le]</supplied> inn at Dieppe (a queer nice old town of som<supplied>[e]</supplied> 10,000); and I slept moderately well,&#x2014;dreaming of my Mother in my <hi rend="italic">second</hi> sleep. On the whole, it was a nice country all the way, a brilliant day, and the Brownings were excellent friends, and <hi rend="italic">couriered</hi> me along in every respect, with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> the least trouble left for me except tha<supplied>[t]</supplied> of sitting still. We parted at the Railway Station here, after going thro&#x2019; the <foreign><hi rend="italic">octroi</hi></foreign> [customs post] together,&#x2014;they are very <hi rend="italic">loud</hi> the French railway people; and make the most of every thing, instead of the least, like the wiser English! That octroi, essentially <hi rend="italic">zero</hi>, took us nearly an hour of time!&#x2014; Browning called in the evening to inquire if I was all right; and yesterday I saw him and his Wife again. For news, he reported that Tennyson had already <hi rend="italic">returned</hi> out of Italy, and was said to be now back in Paris again. There is travelling, is there not?</p>
<p>Yesterday Lord A and I were to ride but did not,&#x2014;little Thiers came in at the time, and stayed 1&#xBD; hour, talking watery fluent matter all the time. I have yet seen nobody. I stayed in the house yesterday and lay on sofas, or dawdled about smoking, the greater part of the day; having need of <hi rend="italic">rest</hi>, beyond anything that Paris c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> offer me. But it is a very pretty Capital indeed; and greatly beautified in this quarter since I saw it, seven-and-twenty years ago:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In <date when="1824">1824</date>; see <ref target="volume-03/lt-18241107-TC-JAC-01"><sic>3:186&#x2013;87</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1824-11-07">7 Nov. 1824</date></corr></ref>.</note> ah me!</p>
<p>In the evening, yesterday, we had a M. Merim&#xE9;e and a M. Laborde, literary or official people (good enough people, not worth gasping and speaking French for the sake of!)&#x2014;I hope to see Cavaignac (tho&#x2019; not with much assurance of getting any or almost any good of him); I &#x201C;hope to see&#x201C; one and the other; and on the whole shall saunter about here, and endeavour to take as little trouble as possible, till the time for returning come. We shall return by Calais, I believe, which gives only 2 hours of sea; rather an <hi rend="italic">advantage</hi>, 2 hours of it are, for a smoking man.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>Many English people seem to be here. We had a Lord Grenville<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Granville George Leveson-Gower (<date when="1815">1815</date>&#x2013;<date when="1891">91</date>; <ref target="volume-26/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/16543"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), 2d Earl Granville, foreign minis ter, <date when="1851">1851</date>&#x2013;<date when="1852">52</date>. After listening to some talk about ways of building the Crystal Palace, TC thought Lord Granville &#x201C;a cleverer man &#x2026; than I had quite perceived before&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Last Words</hi> 173).</note> &#x26;c this morning. It is strange to see such multitudes of soldiers all about, in their red trousers; <hi rend="italic">patrols</hi> scouring the streets all night, sentries with their lanterns everywhere over the Tuileries Garden. A curious place, and a people if not themselves notable yet in a condition very notable.</p>
<p>Alas, dear Brother, here is the poor French Housemaid who has been <pb id="pg-26-190" n="26:190"/>twice at the door wishing to get in and do her work on the room. I must end at last: I have been long here; writing to Jane, and my hand quite <hi rend="italic">out</hi>,&#x2014;only just coming in now when I have to finish!</p>
<p>Write to me: I will warn you again when we mean to leave,&#x2014;which I hope will be in no long time hence. I am sorry not to <hi rend="italic">pay</hi> such a dud as this, but (with servants &#x26;c) it cannot be well done&#x2014;so don&#x2019;t you pay either, and that will bring it right. I hope it is not above a &#xBC; oz!&#x2014; Did you get a Galignani<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Galignani&#x2019;s Messenger</hi>, a widely read newspaper in English; see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18311113-TC-JAC-01"><sic>6:51</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1831-11-13">13 Nov. 1831</date></corr></ref>.</note> yesterday, and did it cost you anything?&#x2014;</p>
<p>Oh take care of my poor Mother; I know what a comfort you will be to her! <closer><salute>My affectionate regards to Isabella Jamie and everybody. God bless you all.&#x2014;</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name></p>

<p><salute>No Letter for me yet, my Dear!</salute> I hoped for one yesterday morning, I confidently expected one this morn<hi rend="italic">g;</hi> but none, after all, turns up for me. It is a little hard. I wrote you at considerable length on Sunday,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC is writing on Wed.</note> and did not draw a very flattering picture of my affairs: a kind word from my dear little Jeannie would have been of real comfort to me. However, I must not complain.</p>
<p>The best and only good part of the affair now is, <hi rend="italic">I am directly coming home;</hi> hope to be with you not many hours after this Letter arrives. That, to myself at least, is a right welcome fact. I have had a horrible time of it, and only one wish lively in me, that it were <hi rend="italic">done.</hi> On Sunday <hi rend="italic">night</hi> there was fret and watchfulness appointed me, and little more; the noises &#x26;c of this confused place having shattered me all to pieces; about 3 hours of sleep towards morning was all I made of Sunday night. Next night,&#x2014;worse and worse, nearly no sleep at all; at the utmost one hour. Oh the horrors of these two nights; and how I longed for my own good little room standing empty on the other side of the sea! What yesterday was for me you may guess. In fact, I had made up my mind to be off straightway; and the first act I did was to go and get a railway bill: but at breakfast time it was proposed that Lord A. sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> accompany me if I w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> wait till the morrow (this day), her Ladyship (who is very ill of cold) to be left behind; then again that we should wait till Thursday and all go, home in one day, &#x26;c &#x26;c; in short many plans were started, and they still fluctuate and hang changeful in the wind: but this, for me, was and is <pb id="pg-26-191" n="26:191"/>fixed that I w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> go on Thursday at latest; and that, if I did not sleep on Tuesday night (that is now, <hi rend="italic">yester</hi>night) I w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be off on Wednesday by myself. Happily I did get another 6 good hours of sleep (<hi rend="italic">more</hi> not attainable), for which I am infinitely thankful: Lady A. draws back from her share of Thursday; but insists that her Husband shall go, who is daily getting worse here: and as for me there is no doubt about my going if I am able; no man can have less to do in Paris than I have, or be readier to quit than I! In fact, I never made such a fruitless jump into the Red-Sea of mud before, to which a sprawl out again <foreign><hi rend="italic">qu&#xE0;m primum</hi></foreign> [as soon as possible] is the only sequel. Cavaignac is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> in town, after all, when we call upon him; him we cannot see;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Gen. Cavaignac, &#x201C;of all Frenchmen the one I cared a straw to see,&#x201C; had gone &#x201C;to the country&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Last Words</hi> 177&#x2013;78).</note> the other French<hi rend="italic">n</hi> whom I fall in with are mere affliction to me, better <hi rend="italic">not</hi> seen. We dined on Monday night at Lady Sandwich&#x2019;s (Lady A. close in her room could not go thither or anywhither): there were Thiers and wife, there were &#x26;c &#x26;c&#x2014;<foreign><hi rend="italic">ach Gott im Himmel</hi></foreign> [ah, God in Heaven].<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >At Lady Sandwich&#x2019;s, 2 Rue St. Florentin, Pl. de la Concorde, &#x201C;dinner was wholly in the French fashion, this was its whole result for me,&#x2014;to see such a thing <hi rend="italic">once.</hi> Company, besides us two [he and Lord Ashburton], who entered first: Marquis Villareal, a thick Portuguese man with big hoary head, and boring black eyes (glitter of black <hi rend="italic">glass</hi>), a sturdy man, long ambassador in England,&#x2014;spoke English&#x2014;had he had anything to say for me; M. and Mme. Thiers, madame a brunette of forty, pretty enough of her kind, an insignificant kind, hardly spoke with her; lastly, a Scotch Miss Ellice (&#x2018;Bear&#x2019;s&#x2019;); and our two &#x2018;distinctions,&#x2019; M&#xE9;rim&#xE9;e and Laborde, with a Comte (something) Roget, a poor thin man with two voices, bass and treble alternating, who said almost nothing with either of them. Kickshaws, out of which I gathered a slice of undone beef, wines enough, out of which a drop of good sherry and tumbler of <foreign><hi rend="italic">vin ordinaire;</hi></foreign> talk worth nothing, tolerable only had one <hi rend="italic">not</hi> been obliged to manufacture French&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Last Words</hi> 181).

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Your Note came yesterday morning; today the Box has come, 5/ freight. Thanks for all the pains you took, in that and other things! I have unscrewed the Box; which is all firm and clear outside; and within too nothing is essentially hurt: only, alas, the <hi rend="italic">half</hi>-full Pitcher has given way to pressure from without, and is rent into various pieces! The want of interior solidity, and the pressure of the little bag within its mouth have done it. We leave it silent in the Box till Jane get one of her big dishes scalded &#x26;c; she will then shift the butter into that, cautiously, cannily; and all will again be well! We shall of course eat that portion first: good butter is now welcome here, the fresh and other common sorts having quite gone away. We will tell you next time how this tastes: meanwhile, all well, and thanks!</p>
<p>I have yet done almost nothing but sleep, sleep! Such a weight of sleep has not been upon me these seven years. I walk every morning in the Brompton-Kensington Lanes; scrib<supplied>[b]</supplied>le<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> somewhat or dawdle about; then another walk at 3, avoiding all mortals; read at night;&#x2014;towards 10 o&#x2019;clock, then falls on me somnolency like a flood. &#x201C;Very bilious&#x201C; I do believe; and today in my right shoulder is a sharp spot of rheumatism: <foreign><hi rend="italic">ruhe, ruhe</hi></foreign> [rest], I will fairly rest myself, and rejoice in the safety of home. Our weather is blustery and damp: I believe none of the Ashburtons are yet come, or like to come till the weather brighter; they were all, especially the poor Lady, taken with colds &#x26;c, and obliged to be chary about travelling weather.&#x2014; I have not seen poor Chorley, have not seen anybody. Piccadilly in the wet, with all its dirty <hi rend="italic">beards</hi>, is not an inviting scene for me.</p>
<p>Walter Welsh and the Kirkaldy parson, one Bryden a handy fellow &#x201C;from Dumfries,&#x201C;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mark Johnston Bryden (<date when="1814">1814</date>&#x2013;<date when="1880">80</date>), clergyman; b. Dumfries, educated Edinburgh; minister of St. Brice, Kirkcaldy since <date when="1843">1843</date>.</note> came here to breakfast on friday last: happily they were so <hi rend="italic">late</hi>, I was shaving or had shaved, and saw very little of them. They were to go directly, and preach on Sunday. The Exhibition, the Exhibition,&#x2014;with a murrain on it! On Sunday at dinner time, Tom Jewsbury and another,&#x2014;Exhibitions too,&#x2014;announced themselves: I whisked out &#x201C;to walk&#x201C;; saw nothing of them; had determined to see nothing of such stupid superfluous fellows. On Saturday first, thank Heaven, the big Soapbubble <hi rend="italic">will</hi> finally collapse;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Exhibition closed Sat., <date when="1851-10-11">11 Oct.</date>, but on next Mon. and Tues. exhibitors and their friends were permitted a private view. The closing ceremony was Wed., <date when="1851-10-15">15 Oct.</date>, with goods beginning to be removed the next day and lasting more than three weeks.

Paris looks very odd to me across the realities of Chelsea. On the whole, a sordid, ragged kind of object, tho&#x2019; frilled and gilt. Of all the Cities in nature I feel as if there were <hi rend="italic">least</hi> there for the essential soul of man. Tuileries Garden, Champ de Mars &#x26;c &#x26;c struck me most, this time, by their dingy, dirty, unswept condit<hi rend="italic">n;</hi> poor Champ de Mars, and its Feast-of-Pikes Embankment!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Scene of the patriotic ceremony, <date when="1790-07-14">14 July 1790</date>; see <hi rend="italic">French Revolution, Works</hi> 3:1&#x2013;69; observed by TC as &#x201C;grassless, <hi rend="italic">graceless</hi>, untrim and sordid&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Last Words</hi> 174).</note> The Embankment once &#x201C;30 feet high&#x201C; has now flattened itself out to 8 or 10, is all over with <hi rend="italic">weeds</hi>, its trees all scrubby, and many pieces of it torn quite away;&#x2014;lying waste as <hi rend="italic">the Ha&#x2019; Quarry</hi>,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Disused quarry nr. Ecclefechan.</note> with mere balloons and reviews, that poor Champ de Mars. And a people of such <foreign><hi rend="italic">seichtheit</hi></foreign> [shallowness] and such crackling self-conceit! The <hi rend="italic">innumerable</hi> soldiers, patrols, <foreign>corps-de-garde</foreign> &#x26;c strike you much everywhere, five percent of the Population seem to be in those red trowsers (shaped like a <hi rend="italic">pair of bellows</hi> from the waist downwards) in those pinched blue coaties and strange porringer caps! But they are very civil all, poor devils;&#x2014;and, as I said to myself, have <hi rend="italic">resolved</hi> into the marrow of the bone that they will <hi rend="italic">either</hi> have something genuine to govern them or else will fight perpetually (at short intervals) till they all die. Which really is something considerable, after all. And very tragic surely, with their present outlooks.&#x2014; I remarked that the only <hi rend="italic">clever</hi>, really solid and able men I saw were of the Industrial sort; <foreign><hi rend="italic">chefs d&#x2019;atelier</hi></foreign> [foremen], manufacturers of bronzes, hatters and the like: giants in stature and veracious as prophets, in comparison with Thiers and the parliamentary and literary canaille! In which fact lay room for reflexions very many.</p>
<p>Last night I was reading in the Quarterly Review:&#x2014;very beggarly <hi rend="italic">Crokerism</hi>, all of copperas and gall and human <hi rend="italic">baseness</hi>, upon Maurice and Kingsley among other &#x201C;revolutionary literature.&#x201C;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >[J.

<salute>Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I quite forgot yesterday to mention the watch: but both Jane and I called about it,&#x2014;found it <hi rend="italic">ready</hi> (so said the man, and shewed it me);&#x2014;it was to be sent off last night or this morning; so will probably reach you <hi rend="italic">along</hi> with this. If there be any delay, write again, and I will stir the fellow up.</p>
<p>We have done with our bad weather now, I hope; today is very bright, brisk; and the wind at N.W.&#x2014; I still continue sleepy, and sleep well every night: longish walk in the morning, then home to coffee. I have yet <hi rend="italic">seen</hi> nobody, nor mean to do so for some days. A breathing time of absolute <hi rend="italic">Silence</hi> is so welcome to a poor soul!</p>
<p>Yesterday <hi rend="italic">Fraser</hi> went; tomorrow or next day I intend to despatch the <hi rend="italic">West</hi>r. I <hi rend="italic">nodded</hi> to Chapman (John) the other day, but took care not to speak.</p>
<p>How is my poor Mother? Oh, take care of her, do your very best for her! I need not bid you, I know.&#x2014;&#x2014; Jane has at last got out the butter, and got it safely <hi rend="italic">stowed:</hi> her own first dish was duly scalded, cooled, and then it split in two; so a second had to be prepared. We hope it is all right now.&#x2014;&#x2014; <closer><salute>Our kindest regards to Jamie and Isabella: blessings with my Mother and you all. Yours ever</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Here are your two Documents again,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> which I am obliged to you for shewing me: there lie many reflexions in the year of these two bits of paper, sure enough, and <hi rend="italic">amusement</hi> is by no means the main feeling they give one! God knows what is to become of it all;&#x2014;nothing <hi rend="italic">good</hi>, one may very reasonably prophesy. But <hi rend="italic">speech</hi> on it is of no use: silence, in regard to this and to many other things, is rather the profitable line at present.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-26-198" n="26:198"/>I did not get to Suffolk this year: I went to Malvern (to a little Water-Cure); then to Scotland, and home hither; lastly to Paris for a week; and have now got home <hi rend="italic">again</hi>, thoroughly wearied, and resolute now that I have had enough of locomotion. I have done little but <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi> ever since my return; for indeed I was dreadfully in arrear as to that necessary blessing,&#x2014;as is my unfortunate habit whenever I venture from home. Paris is full of Balloons, Soldiers with red breeches and porringer caps (very queer-looking objects), and confused speculations about what is to happen in May next: one of the inanest scenes of noise the sun ever saw. Industry, however, does make progress; I found my surmise to be that all the clever fellows in the country were engaged hunting for money,&#x2014;and that, on the whole, the <hi rend="small-caps">chief worker</hi> was slowly advancing to be King of France too, and w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> fling his dirty rabble of stump-orators, statesmen, literators &#x26;c &#x26;c, one day, into the river out of his road. So be it!&#x2014; Come and see me when you are in Town.&#x2014;&#x2014; <closer><salute>Yours always truly</salute></closer></p>

Alas, I am so locked in the wild treadmill here, and my heart and life are overloaded with such tumultuous confusions, I have no heart to write hardly at all; and often, from under my bewildering burden, feel as if reduced to silence,&#x2014;to try if I can plod along without stumbling, and send a mere unspoken prayer and remembrance to my Brother far away who is doing the like! Do not ever dream that I forget you. You are almost daily in my mind; and all our history in common, from early infancy upwards, remains indelible, growing ever stranger, more solemn and affecting, the older I grow, and often turning up, with an almost <hi rend="italic">preternatural</hi> aspect, from the bosom of the old dead years all on a sudden, in the loud discordant whirl of things which the present time distracts me with! Poor old Annandale, my poor and ever-faithful Brother,&#x2014;ah me, ah me! But we must not give way to memory. We have each of us a bit of task to do while it is still called Today; we must go on, in love of one another, steadfastly, whether <hi rend="italic">speaking</hi> or not.&#x2014; In fine, however, I have decided to write you a line or two this day once more; and no hurry, or confusion of demands shall obstruct that small purpose, for one. Let me hope, too, my next Letter may follow at a rather shorter interval!&#x2014;</p>
<p><pb id="pg-26-199" n="26:199"/>We have had such a year of nonsense here as was seldom seen even in London years: the &#x201C;Glass Palace,&#x201C; Grand Exhibition, and other fine names of it are of course familiar to you from the Newspapers. Thank God, it is to end <hi rend="italic">tomorrow;</hi> and thro&#x2019; all Time, may I, for one, not see its like again. I believe there never was such a congregation of empty windy mortals from all corners of the world gathered into any human Town before. Palaver, noise, nonsense and confusion, in all its forms, have been the order of the day; all <hi rend="italic">fools</hi> rejoicing; the few wise men sitting silent, and asking only &#x201C;How long, How long!&#x201C;&#x2014; What <hi rend="italic">good</hi> has been, or is ever to be, got of this big Glass Soapbubble, and all the gauderies spread out in it (beautiful to the fool, insignificant or even hateful to the wise) is yet a mystery to me and most people; and in the meantime England, I think, must have <hi rend="italic">lost</hi> some 25 per cent of its year&#x2019;s labour by the job (the London shopkeepers are nearly bankrupt by the want of business, and every British man, even I in spite of all precautions, has felt himself enveloped in Confusions by it),&#x2014;millions&#x2019; worth of <hi rend="italic">lost</hi> labour that will come to the <hi rend="italic">debtor</hi> side of the account one day; and such an emission of <hi rend="italic">non</hi>sensical talk, tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> and speculation (leading <hi rend="italic">devilward</hi>, every jot of it since it <hi rend="italic">is</hi> nonsense and not sense), the damage of which is not so computable in millions. But it does end tomorrow,&#x2014;to all Eternity, <hi rend="italic">end</hi>,&#x2014;and so I will not say another word on it; but congratulate <hi rend="italic">you</hi> who were well divided by the broad ocean from it, a real advantage on this occasion!</p>
<p>During the Spring and Summer I took to writing a light Book, not worth very much otherwise, but a thing I had to do some time or other: after a good deal of petty <foreign><hi rend="italic">fash</hi></foreign>, it was got done two months ago, but delayed till this, &#x201C;Exhibition&#x201C; were over, there being no chance of sale till that;&#x2014;and now, I believe, the poor Book is coming out this very day,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >According to Chapman &#x26; Hall&#x2019;s advert. in the <hi rend="italic">Athenaeum</hi>, <date when="1851-10-11">11 Oct.</date>, pbd. &#x201C;THIS DAY&#x201C;; see also <ref target="volume-26/lt-18511011-TC-JCA-01">TC to JCA, <date when="1851-10-11">11 Oct.</date></ref></note> &#x201C;more power to its elbow,&#x201C; as the Irish say! It is a <hi rend="italic">Life of John Sterling</hi> (an excellent friend of mine here, who died seven years ago); it is in one volume; and I am really satisfied to have it off my hands. Some tell me it is very readable; but in fact it cannot amount to much importance whether readable or not. The best part of the job, as usual, is that <hi rend="italic">I</hi> am done with it,&#x2014;clear of it forever and a day. They say Books can now be conveyed, even to Canada, by the Post-Office! I will make more precise inquiry about this directly; and if the thing is <hi rend="italic">so</hi>, a Copy shall set out for you early enough next week,&#x2014;and within a week of <hi rend="italic">this</hi> arriving, you may expect the <hi rend="italic">Life of Sterling</hi> to arrive. I shall be very glad to hear it has! If otherwise I will try what other method there may be;&#x2014;and at the very worst you will soon get a Yankee Copy cheap enough; they are busy reprinting it in Boston even now.&#x2014; So much for this poor volume: the only definite piece of work I have to shew for myself since you last heard of me&#x2014;</p>
<p><pb id="pg-26-200" n="26:200"/>Directly after ending <hi rend="italic">Sterling</hi>, Jane and I set off 150 miles westward, to a place called Malvern, there to a thing called &#x201C;Water Cures&#x201C;&#x2014;as perhaps the Doctor has already informed you; for he came here a few days before we lifted anchor, and stayed in this house all the time of our absence, returning to Scotsbrig the following week (now some 3 weeks ago). At Malvern we staid one month complete,&#x2014;I, not Jane, diligently Water-curing; which is a very <hi rend="italic">odd</hi> business, sitting in baths, lying wrapt in wet sheets &#x26;c, and above all, walking immensely on the airy hills, and following a strict regimen as to food:&#x2014;I was terribly cut short of <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi> all the time; and did not feel that I got much good, or indeed till lately that I got any. However I <hi rend="italic">had</hi> to <hi rend="italic">try</hi> the thing;&#x2014;and now have tried it, and shall at least not be bothered with advice on that subject henceforth.&#x2014; Directly after Malvern, we went Northward; Jane to Lancashire, I on to Scotsbrig where I staid a fortnight,&#x2014;in sight of the most <hi rend="italic">impressive</hi> of all scenes for me! I fully meant to write you a Letter there; but the sad turmoil within me and about me cut it short. Our dear old Mother, she is now grown very old, and one of the most tender and affecting sights! She has lost all her <hi rend="italic">teeth</hi>, that makes the principal change in her face. Dear good old woman, she has her sense and senses all perfect, is unweariedly fond of reading; will take no help (except it be from Jack, who is indeed a treasure to her and to us in these circumstances); one notices her great weakness chiefly in this, that a whiff of any illness quite <hi rend="italic">oversets</hi> her, one finds that she has no strength to resist with now. John lives with her, they have the <hi rend="italic">upstairs</hi> all between them; and except for him I could not be in the least comfortable about her. Alas, alas! Old age is dark; and in all human life there lies something infinitely <hi rend="italic">stern</hi>,&#x2014;yet something infintely <hi rend="italic">beautiful</hi> too: my dear old Mother, now in her extreme age, may be said to have still a <hi rend="italic">blessing</hi> such as is still possible for her.&#x2014; <closer><salute>My dear Brother, I have to <hi rend="italic">end</hi> at present. I hope to write again perhaps in a few days. God bless you all!</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name></p>
<ps><p>We had heard from <hi rend="italic">Jenny</hi> repeatedly, to my Mother&#x2019;s great joy; a Newspaper came from you too, while I was at Scotsbrig.&#x2014; <hi rend="italic">All</hi> is still well in this circle, that I hear of.</p>
<p>Just as I <supplied>[was]</supplied><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> sealing, comes a Note from Jean, with a report that all is well thereabouts, and that a <hi rend="italic">new</hi> letter has come from Jenny, reporting well in your side too. So be it, so be it!&#x2014;</p></ps>

<p><salute>Dear Browning,&#x2014;</salute>As you do not write, I think I will venture a small missive to the <hi rend="italic">Paris Arms</hi>, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> will probably find you somewhere in that neighbourhood, tho&#x2019; doubtless you have now quitted that Address.</p>
<p>I got home duly on the appointed morrow after seeing you,&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">midnight</hi> gone a week;&#x2014;after one of the horriblest days of travel, comparable to one of Jonah&#x2019;s days in the Whale&#x2019;s belly:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jonah 1:17, ch. 2. Elizabeth Browning wrote to Anna Jameson, the Brownings&#x2019; and the Carlyles&#x2019; mutual friend, <date when="1851-10-21">21 Oct.</date>: &#x201C;Are you aware that Carlyle travelled with us to Paris? He left a deep impression with me. It is difficult to conceive of a more interesting human soul, I think. All the bitterness is love with the point reversed. He seems to me to have a profound sensibility&#x2014;so profound and turbulent that it unsettles his general sympathies&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Letters of Elizabeth Barrett Browning</hi> 2:25).</note> safe, but worn out into the uttermost pitch of weakness, disgust and almost despair. Since that time I have done little <hi rend="italic">else</hi> but sleep: whole cataracts of deep but very <hi rend="italic">un</hi>ambrosial sleep; not for some years, have I slept as much within a similar space. Piccadilly and the Glass-Palace regions are still roaring with mad noise; but here, thank Heaven, is a forgotten corner, where the wearied soul can cover itself as under a Diogenes&#x2019; tub,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Diogenes (ca. 412&#x2013;323 <hi rend="small-caps">b.c.</hi>), Greek cynic philosopher, was said to have lived in a tub.</note> and contemplate with what of cynic piety is left the tumultuous delirium of the world! Really it seems to me of late as if Bedlam, in sad truth, had universally broken loose; and in this big glass soapbubble, and in other phenomena in every quarter! were dancing its <hi rend="italic">saturnalia</hi> to a very high tune indeed. Let us be patient; let us try to hold our peace, and be patient!&#x2014; I have seen nobody here, I rather avoid to see anybody, and will prefer to lie silent and annihilated for certain weeks.</p>
<p>Mazzini can at once afford you and Mrs Browning, without any difficulty, the required introduction to Mad<hi rend="italic">me</hi> Dudevant;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Sand, who lived mainly at Nohant, in the province of Berry.</note> only he says this sublime Highpriestess of anarchy is seldom now in Paris, only when there is some Play coming out or the like: so you will require to be on the outlook for her advent, if you do not like better to run out some time by railway (if there is a rail), and see her among her rustic neighbours,&#x2014;within sound of the &#x201C;Church Bell&#x201C; she has lately <hi rend="italic">christened</hi>, at her Cur&#xE9;&#x2019;s request. After all, I participate in your liking for the melody that runs thro&#x2019; that strange &#x201C;beautiful incontinent&#x201C; soul,&#x2014;a <hi rend="italic">modern</hi> Magdalen, with the &#x201C;seven devils&#x201C;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Mark 16:9.</note> mostly still in her! At any rate, the introduction is most ready, the instant you write to me for it.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-26-202" n="26:202"/>A certain <hi rend="italic">John</hi> Chapman, Publisher of Liberalisms &#x201C;Extinct-Socinianisms,&#x201C; and notable ware of that kind, in the Strand, has just been here: really a meritorious, productive kind of man, did he well know his road in these times. It appears he has just effected a purchase of the <hi rend="italic">Westminster Review</hi> (Friend Lombe&#x2019;s) and has taken Lombe along with him, and other men of cash;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Chapman had concluded an agreement to buy the <hi rend="italic">Westminster Review</hi> from William Edward Hickson (<date when="1803">1803</date>&#x2013;<date when="1870">70</date>; <ref target="volume-26/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/13220"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>; see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18360218-TC-AC-01"><sic>8:301</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1836-02-18">18 Feb. 1836</date></corr></ref>), for which he was to be ed. Edward Lombe (<date when="1800">1800</date>&#x2013;<date when="1852">1852</date>), eccentric philanthropist and high sheriff of Norfolk, had paid for some articles in the <hi rend="italic">Westminster Review</hi> under Hickson and was considering giving further support.

Evidently in correspondence with TC about this time, she was much attracted by his life of Sterling and was to review it early in <date when="1852">1852</date> (<hi rend="italic">The George Eliot Letters</hi>, ed. Gordon S. Haight [<date when="1954">1954</date>] 1:369&#x2013;76).</note> his intense purpose now is, To bring out a Review, liberal in all senses, that shall charm the world. He has capital &#x201C;for four years&#x2019; trial,&#x201C; he says; an able Editor (name can&#x2019;t be given), and such an array of &#x201C;talent&#x201C; as was seldom gathered before. Poor soul, I really wished him well in his enterprise, and regretted I could not help him myself, being clear for silence at present. Since his departure, I have betho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> me of you! There you are in Paris, there you were in Florence, with fiery interest in all manner of things, with whole libraries to write and say on this and the other thing! The man means to pay, handsomely; is indeed an <hi rend="italic">honest</hi> kind of man, with a real enthusiasm (tho&#x2019; a soft and slobbery) in him, which can be predicated of very few. Think of it, whether there are not many things you could send him from Paris, and so get rid of them? If you gave me signal, I w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> at once set Chapm<hi rend="italic">n</hi> on applying to you;&#x2014;only I fear you won&#x2019;t!<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Browning responded, [ca. <date when="1851-10-22">22 Oct.</date>] from 138 Champs-Elys&#xE9;es, to which he and his family moved, ca. <date when="1851-10-10">10 Oct.</date>: &#x201C;I saw [Chapman] in London by his desire, and he told me all about it &#x2026; . I conceive your kindness in pointing out a way to him, had I wanted it. I have just done the little thing I told you of; a mere preface to some new letters of Shelley, not admitting of much workmanship of any kind, if I had it to give. But I have put down a few thoughts that presented themselves&#x2014;one or two, in respect of opinions of your own (I mean, that I was thinking of those opinions while I wrote). However it be done, it was what I was &#x2018;up to,&#x2019; just now, &#x26; will soon be off my mind. I shall always hope&#x2014;for a great incentive&#x2014;to write my best <hi rend="italic">directly to you</hi> some day.

<p><salute>Dear Jean,&#x2014;</salute>I am very glad to have a word from you again, with assurance that you are all going on at the old pace. Tho&#x2019; in great haste this forenoon, I will answer you without loss of a post, as there seems some press for a decision on certain practicalities on your side.</p>
<p>Alas, the Scotsbrig &#x201C;Barrel&#x201C; (which was a big wooden <hi rend="italic">Box</hi>) is already here: Jack, without delay, on his return, packed it off, with Butter and a little meal,&#x2014;swiftly, the Butter being rather in request here at this season. Jane, after consultation, clearly thinks there will be no good in your getting <hi rend="italic">Honey</hi> for us now, on those terms; so pray do not mind it at all. There is good Honey here, and bad; the good, it appears, come to some &#x02159; or &#x2153; a pound; and for all we want of it, that will do very well. Nor is there the slightest haste about the <hi rend="italic">socks:</hi> indeed I have not the least want of the article at present; my poor Mother&#x2019;s last supply, of seven years ago or more, is not <hi rend="italic">half</hi> worn out yet; this new one, whenever it comes, will be precious to me as a proof of her unwearied goodness, but I do not otherwise need it. So be quite gentle, &#x201C;canny as eggs&#x201C; (according to poor Pate Easton),<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Peter Easton (d. <date when="1845">1845</date>; see <ref target="volume-01/lt-18210324-TC-AC-01"><sic>1:347</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1821-03-24">24 March 1821</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-06/lt-18321204-TC-JC-01"><sic>6:277</sic><corr>TC to JC, <date when="1832-12-04">4 Dec. 1832</date></corr></ref>), of Ecclefechan.</note> and do not hurry yourself at all.</p>
<p>Today I understand my poor little Book is coming out;&#x2014;today or soon it must come; but this was a rumour that met me yesterday on the streets. By and by a Copy of it will reach you. I hope my Mother&#x2019;s Copy is tolerably bound, or becoming so? That is a debt I will account to you for; do not neglect to send me word about it whenever the thing is complete.&#x2014; No &#x201C;new work&#x201C;; alas no, there is a long groping and stumbling about before I can hope to fix on any new job that shall seem worthy! But I must try; and <hi rend="italic">keep</hi> groping at least. We shall perhaps be a little quieter now, now that the Glass Balderdash is going to take wing. <hi rend="italic">It</hi> goes today, forevermore (thank Heaven);&#x2014;but, alas, there will new and ever new <hi rend="italic">come</hi>, so long as we stay in this world, I believe! For example, there is a sublime Hungarian called Kossuth (&#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Koshoot</hi>&#x201C; they pronounce it) just approaching our shores;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lajos Kossuth was expected imminently in England from France, but did not arrive in Southampton till <date when="1851-10-21">21 Oct.</date></note> and blaring and babble enough there will be about him, God wot. To me he is hitherto nothing but a bag of mutinous playactor <hi rend="italic">wind</hi>, very doubtful whether he <hi rend="italic">is</hi> anything more to anybody; and I mean to keep well clear of him for the present. &#x201C;Kossuth is coming!&#x201C; said a joyful little man (Lewes of the <hi rend="italic">Leader</hi>) whom I met yesterday on the street: &#x201C;Kossuth is coming!&#x201C;&#x2014; &#x201C;Yes,&#x201C; answered I, &#x201C;but Kossuth will <hi rend="italic">go</hi> again; that is perhaps the beautiful part of the news! All nonsense <hi rend="italic">goes</hi>, if it <pb id="pg-26-204" n="26:204"/>cannot be prevented from coming.&#x201C; From Gavazzi to Jenny Lind, from the Pope of Rome to the President of France<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Louis Napoleon.</note> (and the illustrious little <foreign>Dottle</foreign> whom we call &#x201C;Queen&#x201C; of England), what an aspect does human &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Hero</hi>-worship&#x201C; offer at this date! &#x201C;Done well, all is well; done ill, <hi rend="italic">all</hi> is ill&#x201C;;&#x2014;and we see <hi rend="italic">how</hi> it is done, wherever we open our eyes just now. Often it almost seems to me as if universal <hi rend="italic">Bedlam</hi> had broken loose: one looks heartstruck over the world for one wise tone in the infinite mad hubbub, presided over by King Cole<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henry Cole.</note> (a dirty fat little creature) and Prince Albert with their Glass Miracle! But it is better to be silent than to speak of such things; silence not speech is the part of the serious soul just now.</p>
<p>Since my return from France I have done little but <hi rend="italic">sleep;</hi> not for a long while have I executed as much sleep in the same time. Which of course is extremely beneficial to me. I take a walk daily every morning, too; and begin to hope that my Water-Cure Account, when I get it well summed up, <hi rend="italic">will</hi> turn out in my favour rather.&#x2014;Yesterday I wrote a long Letter to Alick; your Note came just in time to get itself entered in the margin. We have not yet had any account of Jenny&#x2019;s Letter. Indeed Jack, as otherwise appears, went suddenly off to Auchtertool in Fife on Wednesday last, and is now there: Mr Welsh (the Elder) fell suddenly ill, and Walter sent express for our Doctor, who immediately went. Some kind of <hi rend="italic">fit;</hi> connected with palsy or apoplexy we grieve to understand. All danger for the present is said to be gone again; but the fatal tendency, we fear, cannot go. Poor Jane is very anxious about it: her good Uncle is, as it were, the last of all her kindred to her.&#x2014;</p>
<p>I am rather well-pleased to think of Jim being <hi rend="italic">delivered</hi> from his Latin, into the chance of a more genuine and fruitful employ<hi rend="italic">t</hi> for him. Decidedly the danger was, he w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have spoiled himself endeavouring to overtake that slippery object, which (thanks to Dominie Maxwell)<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably Charles Maxwell, rector of Dumfries Acad.</note> had become <hi rend="italic">almost</hi> unattainable for him. Let him now choose deliberately, and stand likewise to his choice.&#x2014; &#x2014; <foreign>Adieu</foreign> dear Sister: I have at <hi rend="italic">last</hi> got a comfortable paper to write on, and my pace rushed along at a great rate! I did not mean to write half as much. A certain Mr Chorley, a zealous adherent, has with infinite labour ferreted me out this kind of paper,&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">genuine linen rags</hi>, the kind I had 20 years ago, before size and plaster came in vogue,&#x2014;wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is an immense blessing to me. <closer><salute>My kind remembrances to James and all the

<p>[TC&#x2019;s correspondent had apparently asked his opinion of William Hanna&#x2019;s view of Edward Irving.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For William Hanna&#x2019;s second vol. of his life of Thomas Chalmers, see <ref target="volume-22/lt-18471122-TC-WH-01"><sic>22:165</sic><corr>TC to WH, <date when="1847-11-22">22 Nov. 1847</date></corr></ref>. Hanna said: &#x201C;Not satisfied with those excursions over the vast and obscure field of prophecy on which he had so adventurously but so confidently entered, Mr. Irving had broached strange sentiments regarding the morality and peccability of Christ&#x2019;s human nature. &#x2026; From the daring speculation of Mr. Irving [Chalmers] sensitively shrunk back&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Memoirs of Chalmers</hi> 2:250&#x2013;51). For TC&#x2019;s love and admiration for Irving, combined with complete skepticism about his beliefs, see his <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi>.</note> TC says it is wrong because of lack of information and says he hopes that Irving&#x2019;s letters are being preserved. He writes that Hanna &#x201C;has formed an erroneous impression of Edward Irving, whom indeed not many now know well; nor, indeed, for that matter, ever did, even when there was most said about him &#x2026; . I should rejoice in any opportunity of putting him and any others right on such a subject. A subject well known to me; and of an interest that can never cease with me, for one.&#x201C;]</p>

<salute>Dear Lady Airlie,</salute>
<p>Since the day that I left you in the <hi rend="italic">trousseau-room</hi> at Alderley, I have written some <hi rend="italic">fifty</hi> letters, I should think,&#x2014;more or less <hi rend="italic">flowingly</hi>,&#x2014;to correspondents old and new; how comes it then,&#x2014;I wish some Clairvoyant, or Physiologist, or other exceptionally deep-knowing human Being would tell me:&#x2014;that to <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, who have been oftener and more kindly in my thoughts than some of these others, &#x26; to whom moreover I had <hi rend="italic">promised</hi> to write soon, no letter should have yet got itself written by me?&#x2014; I have given myself a variety of reasons for this silence, some absurd enough to make a cat laugh&#x2014;but the most reasonable reason, and the only one that will bear being offered as an excuse is this. I find myself <hi rend="italic">in a false position</hi> with you as a correspondent! Don&#x2019;t misunderstand me; I do not mean that you being a brilliant young Countess, and I a poor Philosopher&#x2019;s elderly wife, there should be thro&#x2019; <hi rend="italic">that</hi> any <hi rend="italic">difficulty</hi> in our writing to one another. My life has been too much made up of <hi rend="italic">strong contrasts</hi> that I should feel the external discrepencies between us at all perplexing for me at this date&#x2014;but <hi rend="italic">the false position</hi> which <hi rend="italic">bothers</hi> me is an accident, produced by <hi rend="italic">your</hi> lovely enthusiasm, by your&#x2014;what shall I say? <hi rend="italic">passion</hi> for <hi rend="italic">genius</hi> and <hi rend="italic">wisdom</hi> and &#x201C;all that sort of thing&#x201C;! My Husbands writings and speech have found a quick response in <hi rend="italic">your</hi> noble nature&#x2014;you feel enthusiastically grateful to <hi rend="italic">him</hi> for giving you high aspirations, and strengthening you for <hi rend="italic">good.</hi> And therein you do well; People who elevate and strengthen us in this modern world being so woefully scarce; one can hardly be <hi rend="italic">too</hi> grateful to that man or woman who does us that benefit or even <hi rend="italic">honestly strive to do it.</hi> But <hi rend="italic">you</hi> go further&#x2014;by the transfiguring light of your &#x201C;beautiful enthusiasm&#x201C; you contrive to see a sort of a <hi rend="italic">Teacher</hi> even in <hi rend="italic">me!&#x2014;not</hi> because you ever heard any <hi rend="italic">wisdom</hi> from <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, or have any ground for believing me wise, the least in the world; but just because I am M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> <hi rend="italic">Carlyle&#x2019;s Wife!</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC sent Lady Airlie&#x2019;s mother a copy of his Sterling biography and inscribed it: &#x201C;To the Lady Stanley of Alderley, with many kind regards. T.C., Chelsea, <date when="1851-10-18">18th Oct., 1851</date>&#x201C; (Maggs, catalogue 624 [<date when="1936">1936</date>], item 51). Whatever Lady Stanley thought of it, it did not please the dowager Lady Stanley, who wrote to her, <date when="1851-11-02">2 Nov.</date>, that it &#x201C;makes one <hi rend="italic">hate</hi> &#x26; <hi rend="italic">fear</hi> Carlyle more than ever&#x2014; I wish that Ld. Airlie may not participate in yours &#x26; B<supplied>[lanche]</supplied>&#x2019;s regard for him. He is not fit for a young woman&#x2019;s society, such a daring, mocking infidel. Poor Sterling how unfortunate he was to fall into that man&#x2019;s hands, just after leaving Hurstmonceaux &#x26; Hare. &#x2026; All that is Sterling in the book is very good, &#x26; he tells more than Hare has of some interesting portions of his life&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">The Stanleys of Alderley</hi> 18&#x2013;19).</note>&#x2014; Now this is what I mean by being in a false position <pb id="pg-26-208" n="26:208"/>towards you&#x2014;I am here receiving <hi rend="italic">a certain</hi> sentiment of consideration from you, which I feel to be given me <hi rend="italic">on false pretences</hi> and not feeling in myself&#x2014;loving you as I do&#x2014;the straightforward virtue to wholly disclaim it; I should like to keep up your <hi rend="italic">illusion of Faith</hi>, so flattering to me, by writing you, not such offhand letters as I write to others, and as nature prompts me to write, abounding in nonsense rather than in sense, but instead, little exquisite sheetfuls of&#x2014;what shall I say?&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">female Carlyleism!</hi> I should like&#x2014; &#x2014;but no good ever comes of trying to pass for wiser or better than one is&#x2014;and in any case the thing is frankly <hi rend="italic">impossible</hi> to me. So I have decided on making you this little foolish avowal once for all&#x2014;and writing henceforth, so long as you choose me to write, on the veracious principle of having no wisdom of my own &#x201C;to speak of&#x201C;!</p>
<p>I heard of you two or three days ago from Miss Farrer&#x2014;that you were &#x201C;happy there,&#x201C; and &#x201C;delighted with everything&#x201C;&#x2014;good news for me, who wish you all the happiness possible in a conditional world,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Goethe, <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister, Works</hi> 24:370.</note> from the bottom of my heart&#x2014; Miss Farrer wrote me a lively good humoured letter along with &#x201C;a homage of two chickens&#x201C; from her Norfolk residence. I am glad you have written to her for I know she loves you, and there is much good in her.</p>
<p>M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C made out his visit to the Ashburtons at Paris but it seemed to be rather a failure&#x2014; Lady A confined indoors with cold all the while, and M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C ruined in <hi rend="italic">his sleep</hi>, by a beautiful <hi rend="italic">Time piece</hi> in his bedroom which &#x201C;struck <hi rend="italic">even</hi> the half hours&#x201C;! and by the want of &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">a four posted bed</hi>&#x201C; &#x26;c &#x26;c. He returned after a week in a most <hi rend="italic">domestic</hi> frame of mind, bringing little Nero <hi rend="italic">a homage</hi> of a new collar and leading string!&#x2014; The Ashburtons are now at the Grange&#x2014; Lady A kindly invited me there for three weeks along with the Taylors<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henry and Theodosia Alice Taylor.</note>&#x2014;but but&#x2014;I confess to finding the Taylors too <hi rend="italic">boring</hi>, for being lived in the same house with a second time! Besides I had been <hi rend="italic">about</hi> so long! and my <hi rend="italic">soul</hi> as well as my household affairs, were getting out of order and needing to be sorted up,&#x2014;</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Do</hi> write to me and tell me how you pass your time, everything about you will be always interesting for me&#x2014; <closer><salute>Yours affectionately</salute></closer></p>

Beyond question you will cut your way, and do a good turn to your generation&#x2014;if you are <hi rend="italic">tough</hi> enough, and can <hi rend="italic">endure;</hi> but that too, as I suppose you understand, is a necessary part of the problem. Happy he who can hold out till the sacred <hi rend="italic">substances</hi>, and eternal fruits, disclose themselves, amid this mad multiplicity of worthless illusive husks and hulls! I see you are full of the idea of universal revolution; which, in fact, is not to be excluded from any open mind that looks upon these years of ours: but you do not yet know how frightful a state that is for a man of real earnestness; probably you will know by and by! At any rate, we cannot help it a whit, not we: and must, at all stages of our history, study to &#x2018;abide in hope,&#x2019; a deeper and sterner <hi rend="italic">Hope</hi>, or a softer and gladder one, according to the time of day with us, or the natural temper given us.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-05/lt-18301010-TC-MAC-01"><sic>5:171</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1830-10-10">10 Oct. 1830</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-06/lt-18330228-TC-JHLH-01"><sic>6:337</sic><corr>TC to JHLH, <date when="1833-02-28">28 Feb. 1833</date></corr></ref>.</note> I do not quarrel with you at all on that head; nor impugn your notions about Christianity, Currer Bell, &#x26;c., &#x26;c.; but find it all very beautiful in the given time and circumstances&#x2014;as the light of the sun is, through whatever media it shine.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dobell was a friend and correspondent of George Gilfillan, who had written to him, <date when="1851-06-09">9 June</date>.: &#x201C;[S]o you are living beside Carlyle.

<p>Having been from home during the autumn months, I did not get your <hi rend="italic">Autobiography of Stout</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-26/lt-18510902-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1851-09-02">2 Sept.</date></ref></note> till lately; and did not complete the reading of it till the night before last.

I thank you very much for sending me a copy; which otherwise I might not so soon have got hold of, or heard of, in these loud times.</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Your Letter has come this morning from Dumfries.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Carlyle wrote, <date when="1851-10-17">17 Oct.</date>, from the Gill, where he was visiting overnight from Dumfries, enclosing a letter from Janet Hanning, reporting his mother well, and saying of his sister Mary Austin: &#x201C;Mary has been unwell. I think she must have had a sort of miscarriage some weeks ago, judging by the description of her illness.&#x201C;</note> The day before yesterday I paid the Watchmaker your account, and now enclose his receipt. I have only a minute snatched from the whirl of hurries; therefore must be brief.</p>
<p>These last two or three days I have been continually bustled, sending off &#x201C;Copies&#x201C; of the new Volume:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In addition to those already noted were those inscribed &#x201C;To R.

<salute>Dear Forster,</salute>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> came by course of nature; and the Criticism was read, doubt it not, with the due attentions and emotions:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The laudatory review of TC&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Life of John Sterling</hi> appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, <date when="1851-10-11">11 Oct.</date></note>&#x2014;&#x201C;all right, all right on that side!&#x201C; I beg to assure you, a thousand times, if once will not suffice! You seem to me a good deal wrong as to the Elder Sterling, and somewhat as to the Younger (neither of which is a very damnable sin);<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Forster said: &#x201C;The father of John Sterling&#x2014;Edward&#x2014;is commonly reputed to be the author of those articles in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> which &#x2026; obtained for that paper the name of Thunderer. The legends of the press do not assign to Captain Sterling a very high position in this kind of literature. He appears to have been very deficient in acquired knowledge, and not very capable of forming an original opinion; but is said to have been &#x2018;crammed&#x2019; by others with his facts and his opinions, and thus regularly provided with the cannon balls, or whatever other things stage thunder is made with, which he took home with him to roll over the resonant metal of his understanding.&#x201C; Of John Sterling, Forster said: &#x201C;The daisy and the lesser celandine have had their poets. Here is a refined and earnest nature, strongly capable of winning itself from all worthy surrounders a continual outpouring of affection,&#x2014;shall not also the biographers have leave to turn aside and dwell upon their daisy and their celandine? John Sterling, as an author, did not, we think could not, touch the public; and as a man, the only struggle of his life was the long contest with disease. &#x2026; [F]or any interest that may attach to his biography, the great mass of the public has to depend on the biographer alone.&#x201C;</note> and you are indisputably right in many more and less important points: and on the whole, what business have I to demand that you should be right in <hi rend="italic">my</hi> eyes on any point <pb id="pg-26-213" n="26:213"/>whatever? The only thing to be demanded, and that not too stringently in the present singular epoch, is that you be well right in your own eyes; verily that is it; a critic may do one some good in that case,&#x2014;and in <hi rend="italic">any</hi> other case he will infallibly do us <hi rend="italic">mischief</hi> (little as he may intend it), if he do anything at all! That is the real fact of the matter, my fixed creed for the last 30 years or more;&#x2014;and there we will leave it for the present and for all coming cases.</p>
<p>The business is now, that I should get at some <hi rend="italic">other</hi> Book (if I only could!),&#x2014;and that you should shake aside that cold, and reappear here with the old lucency amid your old friends and businesses. An old friend&#x2019;s face (as Oliver said of a higher matter) &#x201C;hath exceeding much refreshment in it!&#x201C;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Untraced.

<p><salute>My dear Brother,&#x2014;</salute>About a fortnight ago I wrote to you intimating that I would soon send a copy of a Book called Life of John Sterling, which was just <pb id="pg-26-214" n="26:214"/>about coming out, and also that I would write soon again. Last week, in good time for the mail, said Life of Sterling did accordingly set out towards you. On enquiring practically I found such a feat was now quite handy. If the Book weighs <hi rend="italic">under</hi> one pound, it will go to Canada or from it for a shilling; if under two pounds and above one, you must pay two shillings, (in <hi rend="italic">stamps</hi> always), and so on for other weights. It is an immense convenience and I design if I live to make use of it on other occasions on your behalf. If all went right the book will reach you about a week before this present letter, if it do <hi rend="italic">not</hi>, write to me and I will take some order in the matter. If it do come rightly you may send me an old newspaper addressed in your hand. That will be announcement enough for the purpose, and so we have finished this affair of the Book, let us hope.</p>
<p>Since I wrote last our &#x201C;Exhibition&#x201C; has dissolved itself, all gone or going to the four winds, and on our streets there is a blessed tranquillity in comparison. London is of all the year stillest at this season or a little earlier. All one&#x2019;s acquaintances are in the country, two or three hundred thousand of the inhabitants are in the country. Now is the time for a little <hi rend="italic">study</hi>, for a little private meditation and real converse with one&#x2019;s self&#x2014;a thing not to be neglected, however little pleasant it be. The days are getting foggy, a kind of dusky, <foreign><hi rend="italic">stoory</hi></foreign>-looking, dry fog, dimmed with much thin <foreign>reek</foreign>over and above, not an exhilarating element at all, but it is very quiet comparatively and one ought to be thankful. I often think I will go into the country to live, <hi rend="italic">out</hi> of this dirty <foreign>reek</foreign> and noise, but I am very <foreign><hi rend="italic">feckless</hi></foreign> for making changes and find all countries (Annandale itself) grown very solitary and questionable to me. &#x201C;Busy, busy, be busy with thy work:&#x201C;&#x2014;let that in the meanwhile suffice as commandment for me.</p>
<p>Within the week I have news from Scotsbrig. Our dear old Mother was reported well (for her) &#x201C;better than when I was there.&#x201C; Jack being now with her, that is always a considerable fact in her favor. The good old woman, she can do wonderfully when things go perfectly &#x201C;straight,&#x201C; but a small matter is now sufficient to over-set her. She can <hi rend="italic">read</hi>, the whole day if she have any Book worth reading, and her appetite for reading is not at all sickly or squeamish, but can eagerly welcome almost anything that has, on any subject, a glimmering of human sense in it. Jamie&#x2019;s harvest is well over, a rather superior crop for <hi rend="italic">quality</hi>, the quantity about an average, that is the account he gives&#x2014;and indeed it is the general account of the country this year. Trade is good this year or more back; so that numbers of the people are or might be well off (tho&#x2019; I think they mainly <hi rend="italic">waste</hi> their superior wages) and huge multitudes of vagrant, distressed wretches are to be found everywhere even now. What will there be when &#x201C;trade,&#x201C; as it soon will do, takes another turn. Strolling Irish, hawking, begging, doing all kinds of coarse labour, are getting daily more abundant&#x2014;unhappy beings! We hear from the Newspapers <pb id="pg-26-215" n="26:215"/>much absurd talk about the &#x201C;Millions that have emigrated to America.&#x201C; Alas, it has been to England and Scotland that they have &#x201C;emigrated,&#x201C; as anybody but a Stump Orator or Newspaper Editor might see&#x2014;and they will produce their effects here by and by!&#x2014; On the whole, dear Brother, you are right happy to have got out of this horrible welter into a quiet garden of your own over the sea. There are times coming here, and rushing on with ever faster speed, though unnoticed by the &#x201C;glass palace&#x201C; sages and their followers, such as none of us have ever seen for violence and misery. Church and State and all the arrangements of a rotten society, often seem to me as if they were not worth 20 years&#x2019; purchase and the thing that will first follow them is nearly certain to be greatly <hi rend="italic">worse</hi> than they. God mend it. We can do nothing for it but try if possible to mind our own work in the middle of it.</p>
<p>There came a letter lately from Sister Jenny which reports of you at Bield in a very interesting and cheering fashion. You are not much changed except (like myself) a little whiter in the <foreign><hi rend="italic">happits</hi></foreign>. Tom is a stout handy looking fellow, not too tall. Jane a <foreign>douce</foreign> tidy lass, in short &#x201C;you look all very comfortable on your two farms.&#x201C; We were thankful enough for such a pictorial report, I need not tell you. As to Jenny herself there seem good omens too, and we hope her husband and she may now do well, <hi rend="italic">his</hi> follies having stilled themselves with advance of years. At all events she will be more content than in Dumfries in her old position: there it was clear enough she could not abide much longer. That she is near you on any emergency is a great comfort to our Mother and the rest of us.</p>
<p><closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Brother, I did not mean to write so much to-day, being hurried enough with many things. Jane sends her love to her namesake and to you all. I wish you would buy Tom an American copy of one of my books, (Translation of W. Meister? No?), and give it him as a memento of me and you, some time when his behaviour is at the best. Assure him, at any rate, of my hearty regard, him and all the household. My blessing with you all.</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Perhaps you may think of sending Jenny&#x2019;s Canada Letter over to Grahame by the Meetinghouse on Sabbath;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Carlyle wrote, <date when="1851-10-17">17 Oct.</date> that he was sending &#x201C;Jenny&#x2019;s letter which Mary has seen. Please return it to me at Scotsbrig, as Mr Graham of Burnswark expressed a great desire to see it.&#x201C;</note> therefore I despatch it today, tho&#x2019; there is <pb id="pg-26-216" n="26:216"/>not time to write beyond a word or two along with it. I am reading a great many Books, Ducarel&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Normandy</hi> &#x26;c &#x26;c,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Andrew Colt&#xE9;e Ducarel, possibly <hi rend="italic">Anglo-Norman Antiquities considered in a Tour through part of Normandy</hi> (<date when="1767">1767</date>) but probably his <hi rend="italic">A Tour through Normandy described in a Letter</hi> (<date when="1754">1754</date>); see <ref target="volume-26/lt-18511028-TC-RB-01">TC to RB, <date when="1851-10-28">28 Oct.</date></ref></note> and thinking a great many sombre enough thoughts, analogous to the brown-yellow livery of the season: but I cannot expect yet, with the least certainty, to fix upon any new continuous enterprise. Heavy <hi rend="italic">immeasurabilities</hi> of labour are no longer exciting to me but rather deterring and alarming: &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">le jeu vaut-il la chandelle</hi></foreign> [Is the game worth the candle]?&#x201C; I now ask that with more seriousness than I was wont in former years. Panizzi and the whole world (which P. accurately enough <hi rend="italic">represents</hi>) are a formidable barrier against any earnest work of the historical kind.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Anthony Panizzi, keeper of printed books at the British Museum.</note> We shall see. I keep very silent, have as little as possible to do with any of my fellow creatures at present; and in fact, am, as I sometimes perceive, perhaps the most solitary of all the sons of Adam now alive on this Planet. That too, tho&#x2019; not a joyous position, has its own advantages, if we will stand to it rightly, in an epoch such as ours.&#x2014; &#x2014; Thackeray was here the other night, &#x201C;just waiting for his dinner hour&#x201C; somewhere: perhaps I told you? We have had Mazzini too, and Masson and Bain,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alexander Bain.</note> and others:&#x2014;<foreign>Eheu</foreign>. Mazzini says, Ledru-Rollin is perfectly <hi rend="italic">certain</hi> to be President next May! No saying.&#x2014; Farie came stumbling in, the other day: dull as ever, and harmless except for <hi rend="italic">boring.</hi> Miss Chorley is going still to reside with John, it appears. Jane is well; <hi rend="italic">walks</hi> every morning, as do I faithfully.&#x2014; &#x2014; I think you are in my debt for Letters: I long much to hear again of my Mother. How is she; has she anything to read? <closer><salute>I wish I could send her anything useful at all; but have only my poor blessing and affection, to her and to the rest. Yours ever</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>Dear Lady,&#x2014;</salute> We are in a very dark state here; nearly altogether silent, given up to our own thoughts, such as they may be in this decadent state of the year and of the world;&#x2014;and I can write you nothing that is not <hi rend="italic">worse</hi> than blank paper: that is literally my sad predicament; with which let me not sadden you, and degrade myself, by complaining about it. Under all the cataracts of Avernus,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lake in S Italy, once believed to lead to the infernal regions.</note> I have a kind of feeling that I am not yet drowned; a kind of notion that I shall not and will not drown, or lie dead altogether: in this humour let me strive, and silently give me your blessing,&#x2014;as indeed it is almost my one blessedness at present to know that you <hi rend="italic">do;</hi> Heaven reward you for that same! And if any thought of yours pretend to whisper that I have forgotten or am like to forget you, be so kind as inform said thought that it is infinitely mistaken, and had better hold its peace in time coming, for that I only too well remember you, and that (by act magic or otherwise) <hi rend="italic">you</hi> are painted very sufficiently <hi rend="italic">bright</hi> in my poor spellbound and spectre-haunted imagination; the one glow of radiancy that still looks of Heaven to me, on a ground which is black and waste as the realms of Phlegethon and Styx,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Rivers of Hades.</note> and which sets <hi rend="italic">you</hi> off (I can assure you) to great advantage, whatever else it do!&#x2014; And so let that rest also; and let the strenuous human soul work out its passage thro&#x2019; the jungle the best it may, and not sink <hi rend="italic">beyond</hi> the lips if that can be helped.</p>
<p>In general, as above hinted, I avoid all people; greatly prefer <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to be spoken to, so long as there is so little wisdom sincerity or worth in speech: I have therefore no news for you, or such only as are patent to all the world, and cannot be of the least interest except for <hi rend="italic">forgetting</hi>, which truly is a duty we owe to many things. I spend all my time in reading, in annotating; walk twice a day; study to tread on nobody&#x2019;s toes,&#x2014;and yet one does, unconsciously, involuntarily; and other people do on ours to an almost intolerable extent!&#x2014; My last Book was an old heavy <hi rend="italic">Life of Captain Cook</hi>, by a certain dull Dr Kippis;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Andrew Kippis, <hi rend="italic">The Life of Captain James Cook</hi> (<date when="1788">1788</date>; often abridged).</note> rather an abridg<hi rend="italic">t</hi> of Cook&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Voyages</hi> than any perceptible account of his Life, which must however have been a remarkable one, could any glimpse of it be got. Clearly a braver man than is made above four or <pb id="pg-26-218" n="26:218"/>five times in a generation. There is much in the Book about your Great&#x2013;grandfather, the dissolute Earl, whose nickname wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I have heard from yourself and others I have now forgotten.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Montagu (<date when="1718">1718</date>&#x2013;<date when="1792">92</date>), 4th earl of Sandwich, after whom the islands were named; nicknamed Jemmy Twitcher after a character in Gay&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Beggar&#x2019;s Opera</hi> who betrays a friend.</note> It struck me forcibly this L<hi rend="italic">d</hi> of the Admiralty was to appearance possessed of certain most important <hi rend="italic">virtues</hi> withal; that probably the virtues much preponderated if we c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> judge him as the <hi rend="italic">gods</hi> judged,&#x2014;and that in brief our present judg<hi rend="italic">t</hi> of him was not of the gods at all, but of the mere ribalds and mutinous street populace!&#x2014; I daresay there must be Letters of Cook, for one thing, still at Hinchinbrook?<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Seat of the earls of Sandwich, nr. Huntingdon.</note> If I were Lord Sandwich, I w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have some order taken with what memorials there are of this ancestor. And as for the First Earl, Oliver&#x2019;s Ironside, and clearly a noble and able man,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edward Montagu (<date when="1625">1625</date>&#x2013;<date when="1672">72</date>), 1st earl of Sandwich; adm. and gen.; see <ref target="volume-25/lt-18500628-TC-LOS-01"><sic>25:106&#x2013;7</sic><corr>TC to LOS, <date when="1850-06-28"/></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014;that oblivion, I must say, is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> very pious on the part of his descendants! But, after all, &#x201C;what can one do?&#x201C; &#x201C;What&#x201C; &#x26;c &#x26;c? I know the heavy intricacy of these questions too, in a time like ours, in a state of manners (aristocratic and other) like ours. Alas, alas!&#x2014; If you can remember when you go to Alverstoke, will you ask Croker if there is any descendant of Cook now alive that he knows of? and if so what or where?<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >As ed. of Boswell&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Life of Johnson</hi> (<date when="1831">1831</date>) and former sec. to the admiralty, J.

<p>I called twice for Lady Sandwich, but both times in vain; my wife was with me the first time:&#x2014;I like well to think of your frail old Mother as in England and among friends just now, rather than at Paris amid jangling Ape&#x2014;populations, waiting for the advent of <hi rend="italic">Ledru.</hi> Mazzini persists that there is no <hi rend="italic">doubt</hi> of his arriving at the presidency.

Jane has got <hi rend="italic">Italian lessons</hi> for poor Saffi the Roman Ex-Triumvir, which truly was a fortunate achievement. I have seen no sadder milder-minded more <hi rend="italic">priest</hi>-like young man than this Head of the Revolutionists, who has now got 20 shillings a week to rejoice over!&#x2014; &#x2014; Thackeray was here one night; going to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> with his Lectures in <date when="1851-12">December</date>; then to Yankeeland with d<hi rend="italic">o</hi>: having first published a Novel in 3 volumes; and so smitten heartily on the big drum.

<salute>Dear Browning,</salute>
<p>Here is the Mazzini Letter, not achieved till last night, the Triumvir being busy with Kossuth and other chaotic objects. I observe he has given Mrs Browning the <foreign><hi rend="italic">pas</hi></foreign> [precedence]; which, apart from &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">place aux dames</hi></foreign> [the proper place for ladies]&#x201C; in general, is perhaps very suitable in such an Introduction.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Browning wrote, [ca. <date when="1851-10-22">22 Oct.</date>], in response to TC&#x2019;s letter of <date when="1851-10-10">10 Oct.</date>: &#x201C;Well&#x2014;for Mazzini, I and my wife thank him heartily: such a letter as you promise, will oblige us greatly, and I shall no doubt be able to find out, from people here, the best way of bringing it to bear on the great person [George Sand]. We heard quantities about her the other night&#x2014; &#x2026; how she has grown visibly aged of a sudden &#x2026;, and is getting more resigned to it than she had expected &#x2026; . Meanwhile, the next best thing to youth &#x2026; is found to be strenuous play-writing. She writes in the country and her friends rehearse, test effects, prophesy of hits or misses of the Paris auditory; whereat she takes heart and writes again, points this, blunts that &#x2026; .&#x201C; Although both the Brownings liked George Sand herself and saw her several times, they were shocked by the company that paid court to her: &#x201C;She seems to live in the abomination of desolation, as far as regards society&#x2014;crowds of ill-bred men who adore her <foreign><hi rend="italic">&#xE0; genous bas</hi></foreign> [on bended knee], betwixt a puff of smoke and an ejection of saliva. Society of the ragged Red diluted with the lower theatrical&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Letters of Elizabeth Barrett Browning</hi> 2:63).</note> May it bring a little pleasure to both of you one day! Mazzini thinks a run out by railway, some day, to the place of Address might be a welcome method. You will see better by inquiry where you are.</p>
<p>I believe I recollect your <hi rend="italic">Avenue:</hi> spacious smooth road, mounting gently towards the <hi rend="italic">Arc de l&#x2019;Etoile;</hi> turns in front of the houses;&#x2014;an altogether eligible place. If you will tell me whether you look to the South or the North (towards the River or away from it), I shall, on this hypothesis of mine, be well able to conceive your whereabout, for I was there twice in my late travels. There is nothing mooted here of journeys to Paris or elsewhere;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Browning said, [ca. <date when="1851-10-22">22 Oct.</date>]: &#x201C;I observe, you say nothing about returning in the spring&#x2014;but when that horrible &#x2018;Eleven-Hours&#x2019; have done their worst &#x26; been forgotten&#x2014; won&#x2019;t you reconsider the matter?&#x2014; And if Mrs. Carlyle will so far trust me, and tell me point by point what you both require, it shall go hard but I content you in some sort. Do &#x2018;try the luck of the third adventure&#x2019;&#x2014;as Falstaff did&#x2014;an ominous coincidence.&#x201C;</note> we have a feeling as of Greenland ships <hi rend="italic">frozen in</hi> during this still season, and are very thankful for it (at least I am) after the jangling uproar of late months. Our weather, dark, dusty, smoky, windless and sunless, seems far inferior to yours: but that is an evil it were useless to rebel against. The profound isolation I often contrive to secure for myself is a great comparative blessing: the wearied ear, confounded with vain noises (I mean the spiritual ear withal), catches some touch of the &#x201C;Eternal Silences,&#x201C; with amazement, with terror, joy, and <pb id="pg-26-220" n="26:220"/>almost horror and rapture blended; not able to express itself in any way,&#x2014;except it were a day&#x2019;s good weeping somewhere;&#x2014;and in the meanwhile waves passionately, to the M&#xE9;rim&#xE9;es and Judges of the Industry of all Nations, &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Procul este, O per Deos procul</hi></foreign> [Hence, ye; by God, hence far away]!&#x201C;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Aeneid</hi> 6:258.</note>&#x2014;&#x2014; If I were to go to France, I think my next Object w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be Normandy rather; to see the Bayeux Tapestry,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Showing events in the life of King Harold (<date when="1022">1022</date>?&#x2013;<date when="1066">66</date>) from time of his mission to Duke William of Normandy, the Conqueror (<date when="1027">1027</date>&#x2013;<date when="1087">87</date>), till his death at the Battle of Hastings; preserved at Bayeux; see <ref target="volume-20/lt-18451104-TC-LHB-01"><sic>20:42</sic><corr>TC to LHB, <date when="1845-11-04">4 Nov. 1845</date></corr></ref>.</note> the Grave of W.

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Mr Neuberg intimates to me, the other night, that he is about returning to Germany, probably to Berlin among other places, and that he will take charge of any packet of &#x201C;Autographs&#x201C; or other small ware, which I may have to send you. By way of acknowledgement for your great kindness to Neuberg, if not for infinitely more solid reasons, I ought to rouse myself, and constitute him my Messenger on this occasion! He is deeply sensible of your goodness to him; and surely so am I, to whom it is not the first nor the hundred-and-first example of your disposition in that respect. Many thanks I give you always, whether I express them in words or do not at all express them. This I believe you know; and so we need not say more of it at present.</p>
<p>There were other Letters I had laid up for you; which seem, in some household earthquake, to have been destroyed; at least they are undiscoverable now when I search for them: but by the present sample I think you will infer that they were not good for much;&#x2014;hardly one or two by persons of any note or singularity whom you are not already acquainted with, so far as <pb id="pg-26-221" n="26:221"/><hi rend="italic">handwriting</hi> can bring acquaintance: such were those now fallen aside, such are these now sent; if they yield you a moment&#x2019;s amusement in your solitude, and kindly bring you in mind of a friendly hand far away, they will do all the function they are fit for.&#x2014; About a fortnight ago I despatched, without any Letter inclosed, a volume I have been publishing lately, Biography of a deceased Friend of mine: this also I hope you have got, or will soon get, and may derive a little pleasure from. It will give you a kind of glimpse into modern English Life; and may suggest reflexions and considerations which, to a <hi rend="italic">human</hi> reader like yourself, are not without value. I wrote it last summer when we were all in Babel uproar with the thing they called &#x201C;Crystal Palace,&#x201C;&#x2014;such a gathering of jubilant <foreign><hi rend="italic">Windbeutelm</hi></foreign> [wind bags] from all the four corners of the world as was never let loose on one poor City before!&#x2014;in which sad circumstances all serious study was as good as impossible; and, not to go quite out of patience, one had to resolve on doing something that did not need study. Thank the gods, we are now rid of that loud delirium, of street-cabs, stump-oratory, and general Hallelujah to the Prince of the Power of the Air,&#x2014;what I used to call the &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Wind-dust</hi>-ry of all Nations&#x201C;;&#x2014;and may the angry Fates never send the like of it again in my time!</p>
<p>In the end of <date when="1851-07">July</date> I ran off to try a month of <hi rend="italic">Water cure</hi>, which has done me no ill, and not traceably very much good; after which I went to my native region in Scotland, then to Lancashire &#x26;c on my way homewards, nay was even a week in Paris;&#x2014;and at last, for a month past, am safe at my own hearth again, beautifully <hi rend="italic">silent</hi> in this deserted season of the Town-year; and on the whole am much more content with my lot than I have been in the past noisy months. Silence, solitude: I find this withal an indispensible requisite in life for every faithful man; and have often thought of ancient Oriental <hi rend="italic">Ramadhans</hi> &#x26;c with a real regret, and pity for the modern generations. No devout mortal but will long to be alone from time to time; left utterly to himself and the dumb Universe, that he may listen to the Eternal voices withal, that the whirlwinds of dusty terrestrial nonsense may from time to time precipitate themselves a little!&#x2014;</p>
<p>What my next task is to be? That is the question! If I were a born Prussian, I believe I should forthwith attempt some Picture of Friedrich the Great, the <hi rend="italic">last</hi> real <hi rend="italic">king</hi> that we have had in Europe,&#x2014;a long way till the <hi rend="italic">next</hi>, I fear, and nothing but sordid loud anarchy <hi rend="italic">till</hi> the next. But I am English, admonished towards England;&#x2014;and Friedrich, too, is sure enough to <hi rend="italic">be</hi> known in time without aid of mine.&#x2014; And so I remain in suspense; have however got Preus&#x2019;s big Book,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >J. D. E. Preuss, <hi rend="italic">Friedrich der Grosse.</hi> TC omits an &#x201C;s&#x201C; in the author&#x2019;s name.</note> and decide to <hi rend="italic">read</hi> that again very soon. I am much at a loss for <hi rend="italic">maps</hi> and good <hi rend="italic">topographies</hi> on that subject: if you could select me a very <pb id="pg-26-222" n="26:222"/>recommendable name or two, it might be of real help. We have huge map-dealers here, a wilderness of wares; and can get any German thing at once, if we will know <hi rend="italic">which. Item</hi>, I have been reading again (for curiosity merely) about Catherine II:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Catherine II (<date when="1729">1729</date>&#x2013;<date when="1796">96</date>), called the Great, empress of Russia, <date when="1762">1762</date>&#x2013;<date when="1796">96</date>; subject of much scandal but famed for extending her empire by large conquests.</note>&#x2014;you who know Russian might guide me a little there too? Catherine is a most remarkable woman;&#x2014;and we are to remember that, if she had been a <hi rend="italic">man</hi> (as Francis I, Henri IV<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Francis I (<date when="1494">1494</date>&#x2013;<date when="1547">1547</date>), king of France, <date when="1515">1515</date>&#x2013;<date when="1547">47</date>. Henri IV (<date when="1553">1553</date>&#x2013;<date when="1610">1610</date>), king of France, <date when="1589">1589</date>&#x2013;<date when="1610">1610</date>.</note> &#x26;c), how much of the scandal attached to her name would at once fall away. Doubtless you have read Kropomisky&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Tagebuch:</hi><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Untraced.</note> is it good for anything?

<p>Of all writers on the Royalist side, indeed I may say on any side, Mallet seems to me to have taken incomparably the truest view of the enormous Phenomenon he was in the midst of: with a rare sagacity, almost from the first, he sees, if not across it and <hi rend="italic">thro&#x2019;</hi> it (as I might say), yet steadily into the <pb id="pg-26-223" n="26:223"/><hi rend="italic">centre</hi> of it; and refuses to be bewildered, as others are, by what is of the superficies merely. This, which, at fifty years distance from the Phenomenon was still a proof of some clearness of vision, amounted in Mallet&#x2019;s case to nearly the highest proof that could practically be given of that whole quality. And we may say of many other noble qualities, which are indissolubly of kin to that. &#x2026;</p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>It is a good while since I wrote any line to yourself; and, tho&#x2019; it is about indifferent to what name my news be addressed, I think it shall be to you that I will send this half-sentence which is all I have time for in this hurried hour. A <hi rend="italic">horse</hi> (of Anthony Sterling&#x2019;s) is just coming for me to ride on; which, as the sun is shining, I think will be both pleasant and profitable. Only there are now not 20 minutes to spare, and I am still in my dressinggown!&#x2014;</p>
<p>The Dr&#x2019;s Letter came the same day mine went; we rejoiced to hear of your comparative welfare, and that our dear old Mother is still afoot in her frail way. Since then there has cold weather suddenly come; but now it is away again, and we will hope it did you no particular ill. You cannot bear either heat or cold; but I still think cold is the worse of the two for you.</p>
<p>Our Exhibition is now fairly over, and the streets are reduced to their usual condition of throng, which is sufficient surely without additions. Yesterday I saw in Piccadilly a huge railway engine getting <hi rend="italic">home</hi> from the Exhibition: it stood aloft on a waggon drawn by 24 horses (three abreast), and I could not but wish it well away to places where it was more needed than here!</p>
<p>I go out every morning still before breakfast; which walk, I think, does me good: the <hi rend="italic">last</hi> walk (so late at night) I have abandoned for the present. I on the whole do well enough,&#x2014;if I could once fix on something to <hi rend="italic">do.</hi> I read, read, in the meanwhile; and transact an immensity of confused reflexions, not very pleasant all of them!</p>
<p>Alas, alas, here is the horse come, ten minutes <hi rend="italic">before</hi> its time! I must off instantly and give my affectionate good-day to all&#x2014; I will stick in a letter or two, which John may read (if he likes), and then <hi rend="italic">burn.</hi> <closer><salute>My best blessings on you all.&#x2014; Ever your son</salute></closer></p>

<p>We heard of you lately thro&#x2019; The Grange from two hands: H.

<salute>My dear Jean,</salute>
<p>I yesterday sent you off a little Book, <hi rend="italic">Highland Notebook</hi> the title of it, where you will find various little pieces fit enough for a quarter of an hour&#x2019;s reading. The Author was once a printer with M&#x2019;Diarmid, I believe; then went off to edit some kind of Newspaper in Huntingdon (O. Cromwell&#x2019;s old place), and is now a prosperous Newspaper Proprietor as well as Editor in Inverness these many years.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Carruthers (<date when="1799">1799</date>&#x2013;<date when="1878">1878</date>), writer and ed.; b. Dumfries; ed. of the <hi rend="italic">Inverness Courier</hi> from <date when="1828">1828</date>; ed. with Robert Chambers of Chambers&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Cyclopaedia of English Literature</hi>, 2 vols. (<date when="1843">1843</date>&#x2013;<date when="1844">44</date>). TC was sending his sister Carruthers&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Highland Notebook, or, Sketches and Anecdotes</hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1843">1843</date>), in which the prefatory &#x201C;Advertisement&#x201C; says that &#x201C;most of&#x201C; the sketches originally appeared &#x201C;in the Author&#x2019;s newspaper, the <hi rend="italic">Inverness Courier.&#x201C;</hi>.</note> I do not think his worth <hi rend="italic">very</hi> great, or beyond what he will be able to <hi rend="italic">eat</hi> the real wages of before he quit this world: but in fine he may do for the occasion, and we will be thankful accordingly.&#x2014; In regard to your reading, I think it is a pity, since you have time and energy, that you did not get some weightier kind of Books, out of which real knowledge might come to you; for example, Book of History, of which there are several at Scotsbrig or attainable enough elsewhere; which you could read carefully, having a <hi rend="italic">map</hi> at hand, and attending to the <hi rend="italic">chronology</hi>,&#x2014;that is, keeping both places and dates steadily before you:&#x2014;for example, have you ever read any good History of England (Hume&#x2019;s, Henry&#x2019;s);<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >David Hume, <hi rend="italic">History of England</hi>, 6 vols. (<date when="1754">1754</date>&#x2013;<date when="1761">61</date>). Robert Henry, <hi rend="italic">History of En gland</hi>, 6 vols. (<date when="1771">1771</date>&#x2013;<date when="1793">93</date>).</note> Robertson&#x2019;s Scotland; Robertson&#x2019;s America (a most entertaining book), his Charles V &#x26;c &#x26;c?<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Robertson, <hi rend="italic">History of Scotland</hi>, 2 vols. (<date when="1760">1760</date>); <hi rend="italic">History of America</hi>, 2 vols. (<date when="1777">1777</date>); <hi rend="italic">The History of the Reign of the Emperor Charles V</hi>, 3 vols. (<date when="1769">1769</date>).</note> There is a good stock of <pb id="pg-26-226" n="26:226"/>such Books; and that is the way to read with advantage. I recommend also Homer&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi>, and Translations of all the old Greek and Roman Books called <hi rend="italic">Classics;</hi> of which Jack, I believe, has some store; at any rate plenty of them are to be had now comparatively speaking, and very cheap. It w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be worth your while to have some solid good Book always at <hi rend="italic">your</hi> hand too (like James)<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Her son.</note> when you have a little leisure. Take some tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> of this; and, after consulting Jack, and still more your own <hi rend="italic">real</hi> notion, ask me to help in any way I can.&#x2014; &#x2014; I am glad to hear James takes to Geometry: that is a noble department of human acquisitions; and if he were once fairly started in that, he may prosecute it on his own strength to any extent he likes. Let him state all his difficulties to the Doctor, who was an excellent pupil of mine in old days, and understands the subject perfectly (or did &#x201C;above thirty years ago&#x201C;!) and may assist in getting him lifted fairly into it. Once <hi rend="italic">in</hi> it, he will walk forward on his own legs, as far as needful.</p>
<p>We are very quiet here; with weather a little better than yours, tho&#x2019; too often it is very <hi rend="italic">dark</hi> and a little uncleanly, owing both to our smoke and our natural sky. On the whole I consider myself a little better for my steepings, and roamings on the mountains, last autumn: far enough from what men call well, but actually a little clearer, and more within conception of being well. I read pretty diligently, but cannot flatter myself with being yet near any regular promising Enterprise of the Writing sort; that, I am afraid, will need a sad struggle first! Meanwhile I am thankful to be <hi rend="italic">silent</hi>, to be allowed to go about mingling so little in the loud braying nonsense that is everywhere so prevalent around one, and which makes one&#x2019;s very heart sad and sore. No refuge there for one; refuge only <hi rend="italic">out</hi> of all that, if anywhere!&#x2014; I have had some extensive rides lately, on a horse of A. Sterling&#x2019;s for which there is not otherwise employment: the country is still beautiful when the sun breaks out on it; and in Richmond Park or other such places one can get big spells of solitary cantering, on the finest turf, with nothing but deer and trees round one, which is to be thankfully accepted by the sick soul.&#x2014; Jane is pretty well; walks daily with Nero. We keep out of the way of &#x201C;Kossuth&#x201C; and all noise and stump-oratory. I think of writing a Note to my Mother this very day, one being due again.&#x2014; <closer><salute>Good b&#x2019;ye, dear Sister.

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Tho&#x2019; I am very busy, and have absolutely nothing in the way of news, I will send you a word today,&#x2014;were it only to finish out the Note that was <hi rend="italic">interrupted</hi> above a week ago. Jack wrote since that; and gave us great pleasure by the notice he sent of your being down at &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">the Wa&#x2019;s</hi>,&#x201C; which we thought was a very good symptom of our brave old Mother! I think it will surely do you good, whenever you find yourself equal to it, to rouse yourself and make such an expedition. There are not many such old friends now left as the good old Dame there; a hardy industrious pious soul, whom it is well worth your while to <hi rend="italic">crack</hi> a little with, on occasion Only take care of the bad weather; it is only on a chosen day that Jack will let you venture out so far at this season!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Word also comes that you have got me some new socks made: dear good Mother, I know not how to thank you for such a service: I have plenty of the old socks you made me yet, and no need of new ones; yet the Gift shall be welcome, and have a value for me which no stockings in the world elsewhere could pretend to! They will come by the first opportune conveyance; and awaken thoughts in me which are not <hi rend="italic">sad</hi> only but better than sad. I have had a good Mother in this world, whatever other good may have been denied me!</p>
<p>Jane continues well; she is gone out today to see a set of my <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, which I have just been getting bound to send away as a Gift to Dr Gully of the Malvern Water-Cure, in testimony of his great goodness to me. He wished me to come back at Christmas; but that, I imagine, I shall not do: I carry on some portion of his water&#x2014;practices here,&#x2014;bathing and walking what I can afford;&#x2014;and am unwilling to consume more time and resources in that at present. On the whole, I am really pretty well; and seem actually to have derived some benefit from my exertions last autumn. I ought rather to be trying now, with all my heart, this question: How to make some good use of the health I have! Alas, that is a complex question too; and not quite easy to solve, to my mind, just yet. I keep very silent, and endeavour to be on the look-out,&#x2014;over all the world, so far as I can get sight of the same.</p>
<p>Jean sent a Note two days ago, which I inclose; she there speaks of the Dr&#x2019;s going to Moffat some day soon: we shall likely hear from him when that is over. I sent her a little Book (<hi rend="italic">Highland Notebook</hi>) yesterday; which she will give to you, for a day&#x2019;s amusement, when she has done with it, if you care to have it.</p>
<p>The Butter is now growing very good: hitherto, in the <hi rend="italic">top</hi> part of the <hi rend="italic">broken</hi> <pb id="pg-26-228" n="26:228"/>pitcher there was some inferiority traceable,&#x2014;a kind of half-perceptible <hi rend="italic">greasy</hi> taste, we called it;&#x2014;nay some pieces (squeezed <hi rend="italic">off</hi>, I suppose, in crushing it into the new pitcher, and then squeezed <hi rend="italic">on</hi> again in new junction) had to be taken out altogether: but <hi rend="italic">now</hi> the remainder (perhaps <hi rend="italic">half</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">broken</hi> or originally half-filled pitcher may still remain) is excellent as of old; and so, we have little doubt, it will continue to the bottom of this, and all thro&#x2019; the other. Let Isabella know this, to whom personally I mean to write by and by.&#x2014; I still ride now and then; fully as much as I wish. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Mother: Blessings on you all.&#x2014;</salute></closer> <name>T.

A work fit to be done during the universal Saturnalia of Fools which we held last year under the title of &#x201C;Crystal Palace,&#x201C; and &#x201C;Industry&#x201C; (read Wind-dust-ry) &#x201C;of all Nations,&#x201C; which brought loose upon me, do what I could against it, nearly all the Bores I had ever known in Nature, many of whom I thought had been long dead, and which <supplied>[several words torn away]</supplied> it lasted! Thank God, that madness is now done;&#x2014;of Kossuth we have only now one week more; and then perhaps there will be a little quiet for some time. Perhaps: but, alas, the &#x201C;Stump-Orator,&#x201C; in all forms of him, is still busy, and has still much to do and destroy; and, on the whole, we cannot hope for much &#x201C;quiet,&#x201C; for a century or two yet, on this distracted Earth! Let us be all the more studious to keep <hi rend="italic">ourselves</hi> quiet in such a condition of the outer elements: the former we can regulate a little; in the latter we can do nothing at all.</p>
<p>You were far out of order in not calling on me, last year, when you were so near. &#x201C;Next summer,&#x201C; if that good time do come, I hope to see a little more of you, according to my real claims in this case. By mere seniority I have now a considerable proportion of right in you; now when every year is making &#x201C;<supplied>[aul]</supplied>d friends&#x201C; more scar<supplied>[ce]</supplied> and valuable. A happy and <supplied>[several words torn away]</supplied> and you.</p>

<p><salute>Dear Lady,&#x2014;</salute>Will you accept my blessing and poor heart&#x2019;s-wishes; which are all I have to send you from these vacant realms where I inhabit at present. I am cultivating solitude and silence as heretofore; holding a kind of sad spiritual <hi rend="italic">ramadhan</hi>, or &#x201C;sacred month,&#x201C; wherein is much penitence, regret and sorrow, as there may well be while the noisy nonsense is precipitating itself; but which, if one&#x2019;s poor mind is ever to be &#x201C;knit up into firmaments&#x201C; again, and have any clearness for its works, is surely not an unnecessary process. Alas, alas!&#x2014; Of you I think, often or indeed <hi rend="italic">always;</hi> but only as a <hi rend="italic">ghost</hi> might, and on terms which neither God nor man, if they could be well seen into, need find much to punish! Yet I hold on; and while I even continue a <hi rend="italic">ghost</hi>, and am not quite annihilated even out of ghostland, you shall more or less belong to me, and I will take the liberty of looking over to <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, still extant in the land of the living, as a very glorious phenomenon indeed!&#x2014; Quieres<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> of paper might be written on this subject; but it is better that we leave it all unwritten, and let the one severe element of this world, &#x201C;expressive silence,&#x201C; be the record of it. Poor sons of Adam, bankrupt beggars that we are!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Of Alverstoke I often thought while you were there. One of the <hi rend="italic">strangest</hi> places, now that I look back on it <hi rend="italic">thro&#x2019;</hi> the curtains of the Past, that the Sun ever saw for me. Nineveh, if it were to arise again with Layard and fabulous Rawlinson on its antidiluvian back;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Austen Henry Layard and Henry Creswick Rawlinson.</note> nay Hades itself, with my own life in it, could hardly be stranger to me. For it <hi rend="italic">is</hi> Hades, it too. Inexpressibly painful to me, and beautiful withal,&#x2014;as Hades ought to be. <foreign>Eheu!</foreign>&#x2014; We must quit all this.</p>
<p>I suppose you are now safe home again; and I will hope, are enjoying on Muff&#x2019;s back the blessed sunshine of these days, which are not all black even to us under our fog. Be diligent with Muff on the sunny hill sides; and let him be swif<hi rend="italic">tish</hi> and at least sure (the lucky villain) and bring you home from Abbotston Down<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Nr. the Grange.</note> daily in a victorious manner! Of course your hunting guests are come, or coming? I should like to know their names and successive advents,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; these cannot much concern me either, you would say, except at secondhand! I wish you well thro&#x2019; with them; that is perhaps my wisest wish.</p>
<p>In late days I have taken to reading a most heavy but minute and accurate <pb id="pg-26-230" n="26:230"/>German History of Frederic the Great; a task I have had before me these several years. Which, alas, does not hitherto profit according to hope. But I must finish the Five Volumes nevertheless. Frederic, the more I know of him, pleases me the better; a man and king whose love of <hi rend="italic">reality</hi> was instinctive and supreme: that is his distinction among men,&#x2014;and truly it is one of the greatest and royallest, especially in days like ours. I find him the last of all our &#x201C;kings&#x201C;; and with some prophecy in him too of being the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> of our coming kings: the details poor Preuss (my dull Historian) gives me of his faithful incredible indefatigable toil in &#x201C;governing&#x201C; Prussia, and making it great and <hi rend="italic">free</hi> (free of the Devil, I mean) are worthy of perpetual remembrance.&#x2014; I had long since some tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> of writing a Book about Frederick; and if I were a Prussian I still should, as <hi rend="italic">my</hi> poor homage due from me to such a soul; but being English,&#x2014;I had much rather have an English hero, if it pleased Panizzi and Company,&#x2014;which, alas, it does not do, nor can do!&#x2014; I find Panizzi the <hi rend="italic">true</hi> representative of English Dilettantism, Pedantry, Babblement, and hollow dining and drinking Nonsense of so-called &#x201C;Literature&#x201C; in this epoch; and therefore I have forgiven, or endeavoured to forgive, the poor man, fatal to me as he and the like of him have been and are.</p>
<p>Kossuth still perorates; is not to <hi rend="italic">go</hi> till the 20th now, they say; which is rather sad news to me. Might the &#x201C;Stump-Orator&#x201C; but perish (universally), what a relief were it, a first condition of relief, to this bewildered world!&#x2014; Senior with his young woman came one day; no refusing to go and dine: and so the other night it was fulfilled. Cameron there (husband of the <hi rend="italic">Mrs</hi> C<hi rend="italic">n</hi>) Painter Laurence, Crawford (of <hi rend="italic">Sterling&#x2019;s Life</hi>);<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charles Hay Cameron and his wife, Julia Margaret. Samuel Laurence. John Crawfurd, mentioned in the <hi rend="italic">Life of Sterling, Works</hi> 11:168.</note> a passabler evening than was hoped. Cameron has snow-white hair, a sleek small red face, lively little black eyes, and no <hi rend="italic">chin</hi> to speak of; seems to be of Scotch breed or birth: may the Heavens be good to him, poor little fellow! Senior, sage-dull tho&#x2019; he is, rather shines a landlord.</p>
<p>O lady, lady, what poor twaddle is all this; and it is all I have to send you today, and that under seal of secrecy withal! Well, well; we cannot help it. You do not write for <hi rend="italic">Mallet-du-Pan</hi> (a very dull Book);<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-26/lt-18511031-TC-JLM-01">TC to JLM, <date when="1851-10-31">31 Oct.</date></ref></note> yet I think you will some day,&#x2014;a long Letter (full of details) to my Wife or to me? No <hi rend="italic">answer</hi> otherwise: I will write again before long. <closer><salute>Take care of yourself!&#x2014; Ever yours</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear John</salute>
<p>Thanks for your kind attention in sparing me as much as possible all alarm and anxiety&#x2014;your two welcome notes were followed up by one from Helen last night, representing my Uncle as in the most prosperous state after his long journey&#x2014; It was not however the <hi rend="italic">immediate</hi> consequences that I felt most apprehensive of&#x2014;and I shall not be quite at ease about him till a few days are well over&#x2014;every time I myself have gone a long way by <hi rend="italic">express</hi> the frightful headach produced in me comes on gradually <hi rend="italic">after</hi>&#x2014;and does not reach its ultimatium till some three or four days&#x2014;</p>
<p>They all seem very grateful to you for your kind attending to my Uncle&#x2014;and so am I&#x2014;and it is a real pleasure to me to hear them speak of you so warmly.</p>
<p>For the rest, if the Devil had not broken loose on me this morning, it was my intention to have written you a <hi rend="italic">long</hi> letter&#x2014;in despite of your preference for short ones&#x2014; But there are so many things requiring to be done that I must not <hi rend="italic">dawdle</hi> over any of them&#x2014;M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Piper wants me at <hi rend="italic">her</hi> house at midday, to inspect the arrangements she has made for the reception of Mazzini Saffi and Quadri to whom I have let the three bedrooms and one sitting room<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mrs. John Piper, wife of the Carlyles&#x2019; postman, who lived at 15 Radnor St., King&#x2019;s Rd., Chelsea, and Maurizio Quadrio.</note>&#x2014;left empty in the Piper house by the departure of an old Lady and daughter who lived with them (the Mother and sister in fact of L E L),<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letitia Elizabeth Maclean, b.

Bishop (d. <date when="1854">1854</date>); the sister is not further identified.</note> and the Piper-economics were in danger of rushing down into &#x201C;cleanness of teeth&#x201C;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Starvation; see Amos 4:6.</note> in consequence&#x2014; So as Mazzini applied to me for appartments I brought the two wants to bear on each other to the great contentment of both parties&#x2014; I have also lent The Piper a bedstead a wash-stand and two extremely bad chairs&#x2014;and must now go and put a few finishing touches from the hand of Genius to her arrangements and above all order in coals and candles&#x2014;or the poor men will have a wretched home to come to this cold night:&#x2014; I have got Saffi Italian lessons&#x2014;at the Sterling&#x2019;s and Wedgwoods so now to use Mazzini&#x2019;s expression &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">he</hi> is saved&#x201C;&#x2014; Carlyle is extremely fond of Saffi&#x2014;I have not seen him <hi rend="italic">take</hi> so much to anyone this long while.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-26-232" n="26:232"/>Besides that piece of business there are three answers to sort of business letters that <hi rend="italic">must</hi> be written. One requiring my active exertions in the placing of a&#x2014;Ladys maid! (good gracious what things people do ask of one!) one from Lady Ashburton, who has not taken the slightest notice of me, but &#x201C;quite the contrary,&#x201C; ever since I refused her invitation to the Grange on her return from Paris!&#x2014; This letter also is an invitation&#x2014;to come on the <date when="1851-12-01">1<hi rend="italic">st</hi> of December</date> and stay over Christmas&#x2014;put on the touching footing of requiring my assistance&#x2014;to help her &#x201C;in amusing Mamma&#x201C;&#x2014; Heaven knows what is to be said from <hi rend="italic">me</hi> individually&#x2014; If I refuse this time also she will quarrel with me out right&#x2014;that is her way&#x2014;and as quarrelling with <hi rend="italic">her</hi> would involve also quarrelling with M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C, it is not a thing to be done lightly&#x2014; I wish I knew <hi rend="italic">what</hi> to answer, for the best<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The difference has been interpreted in various ways. Froude uses it to draw attention to the interesting tension in the relations between Lady Ashburton and TC and JWC, saying that JWC submitted to the others&#x2019; wishes by going on ahead to the Grange (<hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi> 4:87&#x2013;88). Alexander Carlyle indignantly denies this, declaring that she simply chose to go and arguing that she pretended to John Carlyle that the invitation was &#x201C;of little or no account&#x201C; so as to spare his feelings at not being invited (<hi rend="italic">NLM</hi> 2:34&#x2013;35n). This leaves out the need to account for the rather &#x201C;conspiratorial&#x201C; way in which TC was to write, <date when="1851-11-17">17</date> and <date when="1851-11-22">22 Nov.</date>, to Lady Ashburton, his &#x201C;Principessa,&#x201C; about having to placate or satisfy his wife. Further, there is no evidence that John Carlyle would ever have dreamt of expecting to be the Ashburtons&#x2019; guest.</note>&#x2014;</p>
<p>I have also to write to M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Macready this day<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Catherine Frances Macready.</note>&#x2014;for a copy of the Sterling which I <hi rend="italic">lent</hi> her to take with her to Sherborne&#x2014;it is M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C&#x2019;s only own copy and has pencil corrections on it&#x2014;and is now wanted for the new edition which Chapman is here at this moment negociating for&#x2014; None of M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C&#x2019;s books have sold with such rapidity as this one&#x2014;if he would write <hi rend="italic">a novel</hi> we should become as rich as&#x2014;Dickens!&#x2014;&#x201C;And what should we do <hi rend="italic">than</hi>&#x201C;? &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">dee</hi> and do nocht ava</foreign>&#x201C;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-19/lt-18450725-JWC-TC-01"><sic>19:108</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1845-07-25">25 July 1845</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>

<salute>Sir,</salute>
<p>In compliance with your polite request, which naturally is flattering and interesting to me, I have directed Mr Chapman the Publisher to leave for you, at Mm. Barthe&#x2019;s and Lovell&#x2019;s,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Barth&#xE8;s &#x26; Lowell, foreign booksellers, 14 Gt. Marlborough St.</note> a Copy of the <hi rend="italic">Life of John Sterling;</hi> which, unless there remain no Copies of the First Edition, you will get immediately; if none remain, we shall have to wait some weeks for a Copy of the Second now in the Printer&#x2019;s hands. It shall be much at your service for whatever commentary or consideration you see good to bestow on it.</p>
<p>Of the various <hi rend="italic">Portraits</hi> none known to me has any considerable resemblance except a certain bad Lithograph enlarged from a Daguerrotype, which is or used to be on sale at this Address: &#x201C;Mr Lynch, Engraver, 31. Polygon, Clarendon Square / Somers Town / London.&#x201C;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-23/lt-18480614-TC-SL-01"><sic>23:50&#x2013;51</sic><corr>TC to SL, <date when="1848-06-14">14 June 1848</date></corr></ref>.</note> Some friends have mentioned to me that there is a tolerable Portrait prefixed to the last American Edition of (I think) the Book called <hi rend="italic">Carlyle&#x2019;s Miscellanies;</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Philadelphia, <date when="1850">1850</date>.</note> but this I have myself never seen, and guess it to be a good copy of a certain Picture here which has some authentic but no first-rate merit in resemblance or otherwise. From either of these Prints it is probable you may get all that you want, or even more than you will prove to want, in this respect.</p>
<p>With regard to Autobiography, tempting as the occasion is, there are strict prohibitions laid upon me in regard to such things; and I hope you will not consider me churlish, but only decorous and duly modest before the French Public, if I beg to be altogether excused. It may well and honestly be pleasant to look how one&#x2019;s natural face is mirrored, from time to time, in the mind of a great Foreign Nation (or of some Thinker that represents it on the occasion); but to make and keep this pleasure <hi rend="italic">honest</hi>, the &#x201C;mirror&#x201C; must be left wholly without interference, the impression must be altogether a spontaneous one.</p>
<p>Several English works, <hi rend="italic">Gilfillan&#x2019;s Literary Portraits</hi> (one of the latest), <hi rend="italic">The Spirit of the Age</hi> (about 10 years ago)<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Gilfillan, <hi rend="italic">A Gallery of Literary Portraits</hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1845">1845</date>); see <ref target="volume-20/lt-18451120-TC-JGL-01"><sic>20:59</sic><corr>TC to JGL, <date when="1845-11-20">20 Nov. 1845</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-20/lt-18460119-TC-UC-01"><sic>107</sic><corr>TC to UC, <date when="1846-01-19">19 Jan. 1846</date></corr></ref>. R. H. Horne, with the assistance of Elizabeth Barrett Barrett, <hi rend="italic">A New Spirit of the Age</hi>, 2 vols. (<date when="1844">1844</date>).</note> &#x26;c &#x26;c contain Essays upon me; none of which, that I have seen, is good for much, or to be depended on for the few facts it gives: perhaps Gilfillan (who has seen me twice or thrice) is the bad-best, <pb id="pg-26-234" n="26:234"/>and has <hi rend="italic">fewest</hi> errors:&#x2014;but, on the whole, I unfortunately cannot direct you to any good source in regard to this matter, and must be content to leave it in the usual vague and <hi rend="italic">mythical</hi> condition for the present.</p>
<p>You are very good to offer me the pages of such a Publication as yours,&#x2014;read, as I can perceive, by all the intelligent classes of Europe,&#x2014;to set forth my ideas. And truly if I had anything which it specially concerned me that France should hear, or that Europe generally should hear, instead of England merely which is my own particular <hi rend="italic">parish</hi>, I do not see where there could be elsewhere such a <hi rend="italic">pulpit.</hi> I return you many thanks; and shall duly bear your offer in mind, should an occasion turn up.</p>
<p>I believe I know very well what the <hi rend="italic">Revue des Deux Mondes</hi> has already written about me;&#x2014;and I will beg you to offer my compliments to <hi rend="small-caps">m</hi>. <hi rend="small-caps">mon&#xE9;gut</hi> (if that gentleman is still near you) for one of the most intelligent, pious, sincere, and every way genial and amiable Essays I have ever read on that subject.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jean Baptiste Joseph &#xc9;mile Mont&#xE9;gut.

<p><salute>Thanks, thanks, for your Letter,&#x2014;</salute>written the same day that I wrote. I hope you are now on the road home again; or home, and <hi rend="italic">safe</hi> from the cold, which is very vehement upon thin skins today.</p>
<p>Jane surprised me last night by saying she <hi rend="italic">had</hi> written to you, accepting for us both! I was obliged to <hi rend="italic">deny</hi>, on the spur of the moment, that I wished to go, or could go,&#x2014;which indeed is not far from the very truth, so fatally am I situated just now! For reasons that my noble Lady understands too well; and in her beautiful soul, does all justice to, and knows what to think of. Oh my <pb id="pg-26-235" n="26:235"/>Lady!&#x2014; &#x2014; But I must consider the matter further, with what utmost perspicacity I can; and write to you again on it tomorrow or next day.</p>
<p>Anyway I am right glad Jane is going; if she can be of any use, as I think she will, to Lady Sandwich for one, who gets on very well with her, it will be doubly gratifying to me. And if I stay away this time, and if I come, or come for the last week,&#x2014;it is to gain a maximum of <hi rend="italic">good</hi> from amid these strange embodiments of misery and evil, which encompass it so cunningly by the Devil&#x2019;s agency in our affairs. Pfui!&#x2014; &#x2014; I will write again straightway; the very wisest decision I can come to me. <closer><salute>And do you pray for me and be silent till then. <foreign>Adieu</foreign>, O Friend.</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>My dear Brother,&#x2014;</salute>Here has a Letter come for you, which as I knew it to be nothing but the &#x201C;Certificates&#x201C; of that grunting blockhead A. Ker,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alan Ker.</note> I have opened before sending it off, to introduce into it a short bulletin of my own. Ker has &#x201C;failed,&#x201C;&#x2014;of course,&#x2014;and will not let it stand so, but grunts and murmurs new assurances of his resignation, magnanimity &#x26;c. I myself, except telling you that we continue well, have hardly a word to say.</p>
<p>We keep very quiet and studious; I reading Preuss&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">big</hi> Book of Frederick <pb id="pg-26-236" n="26:236"/>the Great, a terribly<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> hulk of a compilation,&#x2014;not without some considerable private love for Frederic; whom, if I were <hi rend="italic">a Prussian</hi>, I w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> write about. We have been out nowhere, except one evening to Senior&#x2019;s to dinner; a dullish set, Crawford (Sterling&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">old</hi> Crawford) and others. I ride often, A Sterling&#x2019;s horse being idle: but we have cold <hi rend="italic">frost</hi>, which is not so good as summer for the horse man: I must either get myself a pair of leg-and-<hi rend="italic">foot</hi> overalls, or else give it up. Today, however, I am to go with Twistleton; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is the first time I have had the charm of company in my rides. A. Sterling has run over to Ireland for a fortnight: his Zinc House can&#x2019;t be rightly heated, and doesn&#x2019;t answer at all.&#x2014; What is my poor Mother doing in this grim weather? Oh take care of her! I hope the Gill Lassie<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Margaret Austin, James and Mary Austin&#x2019;s eldest da., who was to help at Scotsbrig.</note> has come: it is clearly, as you say, improper and impossible that our poor Mother should rise to kindle fires &#x26;c, and do with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> some kind of household help, especially in the cold dark season. Wine does her little good, I am afraid? If it do her <hi rend="italic">any</hi>,&#x2014;do but let me know, and she shall not want for it. Look too that her flannel clothes are in order. And give her my love always: ah me!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Robson is at the 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi> edition of <hi rend="italic">Sterling</hi>, as you know; I have sent him 3 or 4 corrections, and take no farther charge at all. The foolish people talk of this Book, as if it were a great <hi rend="italic">new</hi> thing! And possibly <hi rend="italic">the Times</hi> Balderdash has shoved it faster abroad.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> review, <date when="1851-11-01">1 Nov.</date>, was long and hostile, possibly because the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> ed. sharply resented the way in which TC had printed two letters of <date when="1835">1835</date>: one (headed &#x201C;Private&#x201C;) to Edward Sterling (<date when="1773">1773</date>&#x2013;<date when="1847">1847</date>), John&#x2019;s father and ed. of the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, from Sir Robert Peel expressing gratitude for the newspaper&#x2019;s continued support; the second being the ed.&#x2019;s reply (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 11:238&#x2013;40). The review began: &#x201C;Weak minds will be sorely distressed by this last production of the redoubtable Thomas. That angry gentleman is more indignant than ever. His wrath has got to its height. &#x2026; The great object of the author &#x2026; seems to be &#x2026; to prove the utter impossibility of an honest man&#x2019;s making his way in life, and the utter rottenness of all existing things.&#x201C; The review saw the book as mainly an attack on religion. Geraldine Jewsbury wrote to JWC, <date when="1851-11-04">4 Nov.</date>: &#x201C;There is a review &#x2026; in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> by somebody who does not understand it. Of course one would never have the wild expectation that Mr. Carlyle will ever approve or admire any human effort. But then he does better: he rouses one to desire to do right, and we can work without caring for his praise.&#x201C; T. S. Spedding wrote TC, <date when="1851-11-14">14 Nov.</date>, to ask: &#x201C;Who reviewed Sterling in the Times? Is it revenge for the peep behind the veil which you have given us in the Peel correspondence?&#x201C;<lb/><lb/>
The review has been wrongly ascribed to Thackeray, but <hi rend="italic">The Tradition Established, <date when="1841">1841</date>&#x2013;<date when="1884">1884</date></hi>, vol. 2 of <hi rend="italic">The History of the Times</hi> (<date when="1939">1939</date>) 476. attributes it to Samuel Phillips (<date when="1814">1814</date>&#x2013;<date when="1854">54</date>), who had also reviewed the <hi rend="italic">Latter-Day Pamphlets.</hi> Thackeray wrote to Lady Ashburton, late <date when="1851">1851</date>: &#x201C;Of course you have read Sterling&#x2019;s life. It is delightful I think,&#x201C; and &#x201C;I am so glad when I can read and like something writ by the great Master of Craigenputtoch. &#x2026; I have written a little notice in the Leader&#x201C; (MS: NLS Acc. 11388). Thackeray&#x2019;s review in the <hi rend="italic">Leader</hi>, <date when="1851-11-08">8 Nov.</date>, not previously known as his (about which see the present intro.), is highly enthusiastic, because of TC&#x2019;s &#x201C;inexpressibly charming&#x201C; writing, as much as the &#x201C;plain and emphatic language in which he at least speaks out his deep-rooted antagonism to all Established Churches.&#x201C; It scorns the abuse and hatred that it will &#x201C;probably draw down,&#x201C; as shown by the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, and finds the book &#x201C;deeply interesting.&#x201C;</note> For example, the other night a French able editor <pb id="pg-26-237" n="26:237"/>(he of the <hi rend="italic">Revue de 2 mondes</hi>) applies to me for a copy; also for a Portrait of myself, and even for some touches of authentic &#x201C;Autobiography&#x201C;:&#x2014;<foreign>ach Gott!</foreign> I bid Chap<hi rend="italic">n</hi> send him the copy; but as to the rest, &#x201C;Sorry to say, Mons<hi rend="italic">r</hi>!&#x201C;&#x2014; I wish I were at another Book; that is all.</p>
<p>Adamson writes to me that Puttoch will be out of lease next whitsunday; Macqueen<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Tom M&#x2019;Queen, tenant of Craigenputtoch.</note> is willing to stay at &#xa3;180 a-year, &#x201C;unless we want the big House again.&#x201C; It has struck me, I wish Jemmy,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Their brother James, who went later.</note> or some skilful man, c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> go and look at the place, before long, and give me a word of counsel about it? I hope Isabella is better. <closer><salute>My love to one and all. <foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Brother.&#x2014;</salute></closer> <name>T. C.</name></p>

<salute>Dear Spedding,</salute>
<p>You are very good to poor Sterling and me; and I am very glad to hear your honest calm and friendly voice again, on that or any subject.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Spedding wrote, <date when="1851-11-14">14 Nov.</date>, thanking TC for the gift of the <hi rend="italic">Life of Sterling</hi>, which he found &#x201C;the most interesting even of <hi rend="italic">your</hi> books,&#x201C; and saying: &#x201C;you have never made intelli gible to me, by pen or speech, your theory of the <foreign>concordia discors</foreign> [discordant harmony] of our planet, or explained how the notion adjusts itself to your Reason that God&#x2019;s world should be surrendered to the Devil in this or any other century. &#x2026;/ I am myself weak in the faith, but hold for the basis of all theology that God intended his world to be what it is, but to <hi rend="italic">become</hi> better and better: as to me it seems actually to have done from the beginning, and to be doing now, upon the whole account.&#x201C;</note> The voice of one man that has human feeling, candour and discernment, may well be welcome to me in the distracting whirlpool of voices, mostly fraught with mere folly and impertinent insanity, to which I am exposed here. For to say truth, my &#x201C;Correspondence&#x201C; in these late years, is nearly altogether a burden to me; and I could often wish there had been no &#x201C;Literature,&#x201C; or art of penmanship, invented by the Sons of Adam: so sad is it to sit as the general target, or national Cock-shy, for Prurient Blockheadisms in an extensive department of our affairs; and to spend so much of one&#x2019;s fast-fleeting time in merely repelling such missiles, and making them rebound at the due angle! Rowland Hill&#x2019;s penny post has done nothing for me, whomsoever it may have benefited. Alas, the longer one lives, intrinsically one has to grow the lonelier, and shrink closer into one&#x2019;s nook, <hi rend="italic">admitting</hi> to the Genius of Human Stupidity: &#x201C;Yea, thou art great, thou, and the very gods prevail not against these;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Schiller, <hi rend="italic">Jungfrau von Orleans</hi> 3.6; cf. <ref target="volume-20/lt-18451007-JWC-TC-01"><sic>20:16</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1845-10-07">7 Dec. 1845</date></corr></ref>.</note> and I, <pb id="pg-26-239" n="26:239"/>behold, am small, and would fain die in peace!&#x201C; The quantity of mortals that utter any sense with these never-resting tongues and pens of theirs seems to me lamentably small at present!&#x2014; But let us not complain.</p>
<p>I am somewhat at a loss to make out clearly what specially in my creed is the stone of stumbling to you and other intelligent friends. To myself it is all in the most compact quiescent condition, and gives me no trouble at all for the last thirty years or so,&#x2014;fierce as the struggle was, almost to the edge of death or insanity, that I had with it before. But ever since, as Goethe says, &#x201C;With God, or with the Gods, my affairs have stood on a very tolerable footing!&#x201C;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Goethe, <hi rend="italic">Faust</hi> 1, &#x201C;The Prologue in Heaven.&#x201C;</note> And it is really grand among all one&#x2019;s other hindrances and darknesses, to look with such composure as mine can be on Newman, Wiseman, Allies, Ward and Company,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Henry Newman, Nicholas Patrick Stephen Wiseman, Thomas William Allies (<date when="1813">1813</date>&#x2013;<date when="1903">1903</date>; <ref target="volume-26/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/30393"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), and William George Ward (<date when="1812">1812</date>&#x2013;<date when="1882">82</date>; <ref target="volume-26/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/28713"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>)&#x2014;all, except Cardinal Wiseman, had been Tractarians or Anglo-Catholics who had converted to Roman Catholicism during the past six years.</note> and have no concern whatever in that Red (Mud) Sea of theirs, and the drowned or drowning dogs which painfully welter in the same! The fact is I quitted that long since; found that I must quit it, however inconvenient,&#x2014;under pain of <hi rend="italic">damnation</hi> (for is not <hi rend="italic">Sham-belief</hi>, with its corollary Intellectual and Practical <hi rend="italic">Hypocricy</hi>, a damnable and the one damnable thing?)&#x2014;and accordingly I had the honesty to quit it; which, sad to say even the better part of the world has not yet managed to do, but still clings by it as if Heaven lay in that direction after all. To me it is frightfully evident that quite the reverse of Heaven lies in that direction just now! Here, if I may venture a guess, is perhaps one main ground of the discrepancy in our views as to the worth of this time: that you look on much as good, while it has really the outer skin of goodness, while to me it is <hi rend="italic">bad</hi> and horrible, having the skin only, and being inwardly an Apple of Sodom, poisonous to every soul. This, which I often express very wildly, is in all deliberateness my real belief about such phenomena, a most painful and burning belief; and if my pious friends could valiantly follow me over that barrier where they all call halt as yet, I fancy they w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> all see quite a new set of phenomena, much to their terror, and somewhat to their profit perhaps, as the times now go! I believe there never was a good innocent-hearted Nation, or indeed any Nation at all, so steeped to the lips in inveterate <hi rend="small-caps">hypocricy</hi> of every description, and saturated with it and tinted with it to the very marrow of the bone, as this poor English Nation now is; which of <hi rend="italic">course</hi> never dreams of being &#x201C;Hypocritical,&#x201C; very far from that,&#x2014;so tinted is it thro&#x2019; all films, and to the marrow of the bone!&#x2014; For the rest, I by no means fear the Devil will get hold of God&#x2019;s world; let him try his hand at that! But too clearly there are large tracts of generations,&#x2014;the Age of <pb id="pg-26-240" n="26:240"/>Tiberius &#x26; C<hi rend="italic">o</hi>,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Tiberius Claudius Nero (<date>42 <hi rend="small-caps">b.c.</hi></date>&#x2013;<date when="0037">37 <hi rend="small-caps">a.d.</hi></date>), 2d emperor of Rome, noted for his tyranny, vice, and cruelty. &#x201C;Hipocricy&#x201C; thus in text.</note> for example,&#x2014;when the Devil has on all sides the upper hand: which generations I do account <hi rend="italic">damned;</hi> &#x201C;destined to serve as mere manure on the field of existence,&#x201C; when once the better growths in them have come to perfection. And now if Hypocricy is the summary of all sin, and of the Devil devilish, meet it where we will, what can I think of this poor generation of ours and the three or four contiguous to it!&#x2014;&#x2014; You perhaps see here some shadow of my meaning: but indeed I could object much to these old symbols, &#x201C;Devil&#x201C; &#x26;c, &#x26;c, which are far from expressing one&#x2019;s modern notion about the world, and by me are only used because they lie handiest when such unspeakables are to be spoken of at all. And on the whole I will now shut shop in the preaching line, and not trouble you any further with that today.</p>
<p>Our Water-cure experiences were curious and pleasant enough, not specially important in respect of personal health.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Spedding had asked: &#x201C;And now what of yourself and the wet sheet? Has it mitigated your philosophy? If so, it has surely co-operated through the gastric juices.&#x201C;</note> To get perfectly well I found might actually be possible for me by self-sacrifice for years long; possible; but not worth while! What good is it, at the age of three score and ten, to say &#x201C;I am perfectly well in health&#x201C;; and, not having a stroke of work good or bad to show for yourself, be obliged to die, and grow as <hi rend="italic">ill</hi> as your neighbours!&#x2014; But I think the Water-cure a really fruitful invention; and calculated to have great results in our Modern Society, not medical only but moral, nay I had almost said religious. &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Here</hi> is a <hi rend="small-caps">ramadhan</hi> for swollen Bull,&#x201C;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A period of fasting for the overfed British.</note> I said to myself, &#x201C;here in these lonesome water-tubs; let him sit there for a month; and worship, in a monastic manner, at least his own big Belly, ugly but appropriate Idol, if he have no other God!&#x201C; I really think it will do Bull good by degrees.</p>
<p>What you say of Lord Bacon is heart-rending. Gone to shoot Birds, and by an invisible Nemesis gets himself shot!

<p>I am deep in extremely dull German Books about the History of Frederick the Great. If I were a Prussian, I w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> write a Book about that man; and call on all men to reverence him as the last real King we have seen in this world.</p>

He turned TC&#x2019;s teaching against him: &#x201C;Have I read Sartor Resartus in vain? &#x2026; In point of fact is not the whole civilized world changing its old clothes at this moment faster than for 3 centuries heretofore, and why is this the moment of finding it especially guilty of unconscious hypocrisy?

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Many thanks for your Malaga Anecdote; which you are very kind to send me. It is an interesting appendix to the fate of poor Boyd;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Boyd, John Sterling&#x2019;s cousin, formerly in the Indian army, joined forces with a group of Spanish exiles in London led by Gen. Jos&#xE9; Maria Torrijos. They were helped, as TC describes, by &#x201C;young Cambridge democrats,&#x201C; and sailed for Spain, <date when="1830">1830</date>, where Boyd eventually landed. The only Englishman left, he was executed with about fifty rebels at Malaga, <date when="1831-12-11">11 Dec. 1831</date>. See <hi rend="italic">Life of Sterling, Works</hi> 11:69&#x2013;73, 86&#x2013;89.</note>&#x2014;and indeed so beautiful a little trait of its kind that one not only wishes to believe it, but would fain be compelled to do so: I mean, would fain have the evidence of some eye-witness (if that were possible), and so by extinguishing all uncertainty about it, complete its excellence. You, I am afraid, can do nothing farther in the matter: you heard it talked of as a fact by reputable people in society, in Spain, perhaps in Malaga itself, some years ago; and then your testimony finishes. This is something, this is much; and we will thankfully take it and keep it, if we can get no more. But perhaps Mr Marks<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> himself is still living, and even in England? Perhaps, as I said, somebody who saw the fact is yet here to assert it and authenticate it? Nothing in the least <hi rend="italic">hinders</hi> one to believe, for the scene is perfectly natural and conceivable; but in such a case one w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> feel it a happiness to be <hi rend="italic">compelled.</hi></p>
<p>I think of sending <supplied>[a?]</supplied> Note to Captain A. Sterling, John&#x2019;s Brother, who is now in Ireland, soon coming back; and whose relationship to Boyd, and leisure for such investigations, may induce him to make farther inquiry on the subject.&#x2014; In any case I am much obliged to you for this communication; <pb id="pg-26-242" n="26:242"/>which indeed is welcome to me both for your sake and its own.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sterling was in the W Indies by the time of the catastrophe. He wrote of it to his brother, Anthony, but his friends never heard about it from him, and were warned not to mention it.</note> <closer><salute>Pray offer my regards and remembrances to Mrs Warburton,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Matilda Jane.</note> if the fair lady will accept them;&#x2014;and believe me</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>My dear Brother,&#x2014;</salute>Here, along with Jamie&#x2019;s Newspaper which only reached me this morning, is a quantity of Letters &#x26;c, mostly very insignificant; which I am afraid you will get little good of yourself, but which you will perhaps read to my Mother, and so make an hour of the <foreign><hi rend="italic">gloaming</hi></foreign> cheerfuller for her in this cold dark season. To send you these, and say we are still well, is my whole message this morning.</p>
<p>I have given up riding for a week past; Twistleton&#x2019;s was my last day: I found it absolutely impossible, without a pair of mud-boots (not easily procurable here) to keep my feet warm in the dim frosty days; nay I had already contracted a little cold by former riding: so for the present I gave it up. I am still busy with Preuss&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Frederic;</hi> but meet with innumerable interruptions, do all I can,&#x2014;ah me! Every morning still I <hi rend="italic">bathe</hi> (frosty enough work, but I make it very brief); then <hi rend="italic">out</hi>, what I can stride; and in an hour or less am warm enough again, and ready for breakfast. I believe it to be wholesome for me; and in fact, one way and another, I am perceptibly better in health than usual just now.&#x2014; We have had Clough;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Arthur Hugh Clough.</note> are expecting Twist<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, James Spedding: but on the whole keep as solitary as is possible easily. Your own tho<hi rend="italic">ts</hi>, if you have enough of them, are infinitely preferable to the grinning jargon of most men.&#x2014; I have a good Letter from Tom Spedding; but it is not worth the additional 2 pence today.&#x2014; The weather has gone from soft and fresh to absolute rain, and now again we have a return of frost with plenty of white rime this morning. A hard winter everywhere, they say. Many a time I think of my poor Mother, and wonder what is becoming of her in the cold air! Oh be careful of her!&#x2014; Of course she does not now rise till the house is quite <hi rend="italic">warmed</hi>, and breakfast ready: which surely is a great improve<hi rend="italic">t.</hi></p>
<p><pb id="pg-26-243" n="26:243"/>The Mazzinis have quitted their den in Brompton, and gone to lodge with Postie Piper in some off-street from the King&#x2019;s Road: such <hi rend="italic">shoals</hi> of Italian <foreign><hi rend="italic">Destituti</hi></foreign> [Poor] came about M<hi rend="italic">i</hi>, he was fain to run for it.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mazzini wrote to a friend, <date when="1851-11-25">25 Nov.</date>: &#x201C;I have run away from the people, and removed by night, like a thief, with a bag, without saying a word to the persons in the house, and then I sent some body to say that I was not coming back.

<p>I have received your two beautiful Volumes;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">The Poetical Works of John Edmund Reade</hi>, 2 vols. (<date when="1852">1852</date>). Reade had sent TC his <hi rend="italic">Sacred Poems</hi> (<date when="1843">1843</date>), for which he had been civilly thanked but recommended to turn to prose; see <ref target="volume-16/lt-18430630-TC-JER-01"><sic>16:221</sic><corr>TC to JER, <date when="1843-06-30">30 June 1843</date></corr></ref>.</note> and beg to return you many thanks for that distinguished mark of your goodness to me.</p>
<p>Many of these Poems were already, in an earlier shape, known to me; nor had the Author, or his strenuous endeavours after excellence in art, been &#x201C;forgotten,&#x201C; but on the contrary was well remembered, and is like to be. Of one thing you may make yourself very certain: No true endeavour after excellence can by possibility be lost; and the correct sum of every man&#x2019;s true endeavours will in the long run be paid him as success, whatever other men may think or say about it. This is the law for every soul of us, in Art or elsewhere; we shall get no more, and we shall be offered no less: which, in the loud rumblings of a world not over-wise for most part, ought to be a source of great composure to us.&#x2014; &#x2014; &#x2014; &#x2014;</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Your Letter, many thanks for it, came last night: Jean had sent us Alick&#x2019;s the night before. We are concerned to hear of so many accidents: poor Jenny falling ill; Alick&#x2019;s Tom escaping only with the loss of his horse; and now this ugly blow on poor Jemmy&#x2019;s head, which might easily have turned out very ill indeed! That must have been a stern &#x201C;ride&#x201C; he had, &#x201C;home by himself,&#x201C; poor fellow!&#x2014; I am afraid his <hi rend="italic">head</hi> will feel it for some time to come; pray attend to him, and give him such advice as may best help him thro&#x2019; the business.</p>
<p>By the way, if you have any good <hi rend="italic">Histories</hi> (Robertson&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">America, Scotland</hi> &#x26;c or any other recommendable), Jean seems in some want of <hi rend="italic">reading</hi> at <pb id="pg-26-245" n="26:245"/>present, and it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be a kindness to send her something of the kind.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-26/lt-18511112-TC-JCA-01">TC to JCA, <date when="1851-11-12">12 Nov.</date></ref></note>&#x2014; &#x2014; I stick all the Letters in today, and hope you will amuse my Mother a little by reading them at night. Marg<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Austin&#x2019;s presence there, since she performs so well, is a great comfort to us on our Mother&#x2019;s account. I want none of those Letters <hi rend="italic">back</hi>, except Varnhagen&#x2019;s, which you may send when convenient.</p>
<p>Jane goes to the Grange on Monday; I stay here by myself for about a fortnight, having pleaded <hi rend="italic">off</hi> from going so soon: ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> the 13<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, it is schemed, I am to go down, along with Twistleton &#x26;c, and so be in at the last act.&#x2014; I am <hi rend="italic">reading</hi> Books ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> F<hi rend="italic">k</hi> the Great, beyond doubt; but with no clear view yet of doing any good by writing of him: his being a <hi rend="italic">foreigner</hi> is a grand drawback to such an enterprise.&#x2014; Last night, Twist<hi rend="italic">n</hi> was here, and poor Saffi who is busy reading your <hi rend="italic">Dante: French</hi> talk, not of the best! Saffi is a very good creature, with much intelligence and modesty: Jane has got him a little teaching; for which he regards her as a friend in need. &#x201C;Miss Farrer&#x201C; did <hi rend="italic">not</hi> &#x201C;come.&#x201C;&#x2014; What an excell<hi rend="italic">t</hi> stock of coals and whisky!&#x2014; &#x2014; <closer><salute>Give my love to my good Mother, and to all the rest.

<p>I was in Wor&#x2019;stershire, immersed in medical and many other confusions, when the news of your great loss and my own reached me.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Her husband, William, had d., <date when="1851-08-02">2 Aug.</date>; see <ref target="volume-26/lt-18510818-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1851-08-18">18 Aug.</date></ref> Though she was Edward Irving&#x2019;s wife&#x2019;s sister-in-law and, as TC explains, her husband had long been known to the Carlyles, he evidently writes to regret that he had then left their condolences to be expressed only by John Carlyle.</note> In the world I had few friends left who had been as well-affected, true, and ever-ready to help me in all things; nor in the course of my whole life had I known a more genuinely worthy man. You may think, whether, if I had nothing to say, I had also nothing to feel on that subject! I said nothing, rather because I had <hi rend="italic">too much</hi> to say,&#x2014;because in fact I am getting more and more into the way of <pb id="pg-26-246" n="26:246"/>keeping <hi rend="italic">silence</hi> about all things that much concern me, in this loud-babbling very foolish world, to which in general there is no speaking with good effect about such matters. This hard method grows more and more the suitablest to myself; but I now find it was somewhat unjust and very unkind-looking to one so related to me and to the sad event as you;&#x2014;for which I beg you to forgive me, and to interpret me kindly. Thirty-four years friendly neighbourhood in this world is surely a tie between two human souls. Ah, me; ah, me!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I hope to get as far as Woburn Square, and see you again, before very long, in spite of all my confused impediments; and I bid you believe me always, Dear Mrs Hamilton</p>

<p><salute>Indeed Dear I desired to do your bidding; but to write any sort of note yesterday between my arrival and six o&#x2019;clock was morally impossible&#x2014;as yourself, had you seen &#x201C;how I was situated,&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">your</hi> pet expression), would have frankly admitted&#x2014;</salute> We got here at half after four; I pretty well suffocated&#x2014;for Lady S<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sandwich.</note> had kept both windows shut, in the Brougham as well as in the railway carriage&#x2014;and the male passenger had smoked a bad cigar, the last thing he did before rejoining his wife! It was a detestable journey in fact, as most journeys are&#x2014; There was a famous fire in the drawingroom when we arrived but the room was otherwise dark and alas! <hi rend="italic">empty.</hi> And as the minutes wore on, and nobody came Lady S got what Ann calls &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">upsettet</hi>,&#x201C; lay back in her chair with her handkerchief on her face, and giving little half-sobs, which I expected every moment would turn to an explosion of tears, She no longer answered when I spoke to her, so being unable to do her any good, nature prompted me to run away&#x2014;only I knew not what room to betake myself to and it was not for <hi rend="italic">me</hi> to <hi rend="italic">ring</hi>, the first&#x2014; At length Lady A came and then indeed I saw that I was imperatively <hi rend="italic">wanted</hi> to&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">stay!</hi> Tea was ordered for which I was very grateful and then Lady S and I were shown to our rooms together, and by that time it had struck six&#x2014; Lady S took to bed and her dinner taken to her so I dined, the only one, in that great dining room, from silver dishes with three men hovering round me like a flight of crows while <pb id="pg-26-247" n="26:247"/>Lady A goodnaturedly knitted there while I eat&#x2014;you may imagine with my &#x201C;Brammical<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For &#x201C;Brahmic.&#x201C;</note> notions about eating&#x201C; how I felt!&#x2014; We had not been long in the drawingroom before poor Lady S came down full-dressed, and &#x201C;all gathered up,&#x201C; and the evening was spent very pleasantly in making doll&#x2019;s clothes. I had long wished for a doll to dress, as a supplement to that blessed doll-dressing period which in my particular case was cut cruelly short&#x2014;and now behold, the kind Fates have sent me seven dolls to dress! and you shall see what beauties I shall make of them! Lady A has hemmed the bottom of a shift and petticoat&#x2014;</p>
<p>I am in my old room at the end of the corridor which has got several new conveniences, and I slept very well in the French bed&#x2014;my bath however was a strange looking machine some three feet high and shaped like a flower-pot into which I saw no probability of introducing myself or of doing any good in it when there&#x2014;so I missed my cold water in the morning and went down all too sensitive to the cold of the dining room and have coughed and sniftered over my doll&#x2019;s clothes ever since breakfast&#x2014;and must go no further than the Conservatory today&#x2014; The weather here looks quite as raw and thick as in London&#x2014; I hope in Heaven I shall be well tomorrow&#x2014;they have changed my bath&#x2014; Love and a kiss to my poor wee dog&#x2014;I missed him dreafully at bed time&#x2014; But I <hi rend="italic">see</hi> it was a particularly mercy of Heaven that I had the sense to resist <hi rend="italic">your</hi> recommendations to fetch him with me&#x2014; I will send you a line about my health tomorrow&#x2014;I know <hi rend="italic">you</hi> are very content&#x2014;with the house all to yourself</p>

<p>I hope that Ann will not forget her secret mission tomorrow morning, and that before you find this letter on your plate you will have found the waistcoat on your toilet. And <hi rend="italic">I</hi> hope too, not without <hi rend="italic">a certain</hi> apprehension, that the said waistcoat may find favour in your sight<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Gen. 18:3 and elsewhere in the Old Testament.

<p>For the rest my cold is no <hi rend="italic">worse</hi> &#x201C;thanks God&#x201C;&#x2014;rather better if anything&#x2014;but I have still enough of cough and roughness and of that questionable sensation of being &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">all nohow</hi>&#x201C; to require that I should keep within doors. It is an excessively cold house this, in spite of the good fires that are kept up&#x2014;and I do not see how any body &#x201C;that has a habit&#x201C; of taking colds can ever be without one in it&#x2014;but I shall be quite content if I can keep on <hi rend="italic">dressing my dolls</hi> even &#x201C;under difficulties&#x201C;!</p>
<p>Lord A returned from Cornwall yesterday,&#x2014;presides over a dinner at Winchester today,&#x2014;and will be coming and going&#x2014;chiefly <hi rend="italic">going</hi> till the 13<hi rend="italic">th</hi>&#x2014; Till then nobody comes I believe&#x2014; I gave my &#x201C;noble Hosts&#x201C; (how like the M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Russell<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> who took <hi rend="italic">two soups!</hi>) your &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">respects</hi>,&#x201C; as desired&#x2014;and I must say they were received by Lady A just <supplied>[as]</supplied><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> I should have received them in her place&#x2014;with a great burst of ironical laughter&#x2014;&#x201C;If <hi rend="italic">I</hi> were simple enough&#x201C; she said &#x201C;to be taken in by <hi rend="italic">that dodge</hi>, <hi rend="small-caps">she</hi> wasn&#x2019;t&#x2014;that M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C knew very well he had gone a great way beyond &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">respects</hi>&#x201C; with her&#x2014;especially since that visit to Paris&#x201C;&#x2014;</p>
<p>Would you give the inclosed to Ann and tell her that her Daughter may do as she pleases about it&#x2014;the Place is still there if she like to go after it and thinks she has brains enough to find her road&#x2014;but I am sick of <hi rend="italic">driving</hi> her, and wash my hands of all responsibility&#x2014; Lady S is come down and I was to talk to her while Lady Ashburton is gone for a walk&#x2014;in fact with nothing to do nominally but these seven dolls to dress I have somehow no quiet hour to write a letter&#x2014;all the day long Lady S bids me say you may send her your <hi rend="italic">regards</hi> next time and keep your respects for those who like them <closer><salute>a kiss to my dear Nero</salute></closer></p>

<p>Nothingk for Craigenputtoch today either?

<salute>Dearest Helen</salute>
<p>Your note followed me here without delay and now here is the direct address for you&#x2014; Recollect moreover that when one is on a visit, the time seems always much longer than when in the monotonous routine of home&#x2014;so by next week it will be seeming a month since I had news of my Uncle&#x2014; Also to touch your heart as much as possible; let me add; that the very day <pb id="pg-26-253" n="26:253"/>after I arrived, I took cold which, has been keeping me in doors till I am grown quite <hi rend="italic">low</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">imaginative</hi>, after my bad fashion, to an even unusual degree&#x2014; Happily there are no visitors here except the old Countess of Sandwich Lady Ashburtons Mother, and the days pass quite calmly in&#x2014;dressing dolls! If I had to sit thro long dinners and take part in &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">wits</hi>,&#x201C; I could not hold out on my legs 24 hours&#x2014; But that doll-dressing suits me entirely&#x2014; There is to be a fine Christmas tree for Lady A&#x2019;s school children and <hi rend="italic">seven</hi> dolls form part of the Gifts&#x2014; They were bought <hi rend="italic">naked</hi>, except for a wrappage of silkpaper and a piece of cotton wool on each of their noses to prevent damage to that interesting feature and Lady A, tho not much given to a credulous faith in her fellow creatures, <hi rend="italic">actually</hi> hoped that her Lady&#x2019;s Maid and the Housekeeper, and <hi rend="italic">their</hi> numerous subordinates would <hi rend="italic">take an interest</hi> in these dolls and dress or assist <hi rend="italic">her</hi> to dress them&#x2014; But not a bit&#x2014;not only did they show themselves <hi rend="italic">impassive</hi> in the <hi rend="italic">dressing</hi> question but not a rag of ribbon or any sort of scrap would they produce so that Lady A had to <hi rend="italic">insist</hi> on the Housekeeper giving some pieces of <hi rend="italic">furniture chintz</hi> to make frocks for the dolls and to write to London&#x2014;to her <foreign><hi rend="italic">ci devant</hi></foreign> [former] Lady&#x2019;s maid for some scraps!!&#x2014; The very footmen wont <hi rend="italic">carry the dolls</hi> backwards and forwards!&#x2014;when told to bring one or to desire Josephine (the Lady&#x2019;s maid) to bring one they simply disappear and no doll comes!&#x2014; I remarked on this with some impatience yesterday, and Lady A answered &#x201C;perfectly true Mr<supplied>[<hi rend="italic">s</hi>]</supplied><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> Carlyle&#x2014;they <hi rend="italic">wont bring the doll!</hi>&#x2014;I know it as well as you do&#x2014;but what would you have me do?&#x2014;turn all the servants men and women out of the house on account of these dolls? for <hi rend="italic">it would</hi> come to <hi rend="italic">that</hi>&#x2014;if I made a point of their <hi rend="italic">doing anything in the doll line!</hi>&#x2014; Perhaps it would be the <hi rend="italic">right</hi> thing to do&#x2014;but then what should we do next week without servants when all the company come?&#x201C; Such is the slavery the grandest people live under <hi rend="italic">to what they call</hi> their &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">inferiors</hi>&#x201C;!</p>

<p><salute>Thanks, dear Jeannie, for your nice little Letter, tho&#x2019; the news was bad.</salute> I had my own fears about that miserable cold, and meant to say on Saturday that you were to come home at once if it grew too bad;&#x2014;which must be still your rule. Our weather here is now absolutely beautiful, and even Anne is getting better of her cold.</p>
<p>I executed a deal of riding yesterday; and after near <hi rend="italic">four hours</hi> of foot and horse exercise, was at South Place<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >No. 3, Anthony Sterling&#x2019;s home.</note> little after time. &#x201C;Mutton-chop with Ford&#x201C;: there was a grand <hi rend="italic">dinner</hi>, when I arrived there <foreign><hi rend="italic">en frac</hi></foreign> [in frock coat]; Mrs Ford, Laurence, one Cunningham a little Wine-merch<hi rend="italic">t;</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> the girls all dressed like tulips and M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> S.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charlotte Sterling.</note> in due form; Anthony himself in white waistcoat, and all very grand indeed! I was really provoked, but said nothing: happily I was <hi rend="italic">clean</hi> as new snow,&#x2014;and had not come in my pilot jacket; and in short couldn&#x2019;t help it. Ford, tho&#x2019; a man without <hi rend="italic">humour</hi> or any gracefulness or loveability of character, is not the worst of men to dine with at all; has <pb id="pg-26-255" n="26:255"/>abundance of authentic information (not duller than Macaulay&#x2019;s, and much more certain, and more social too), and talks away about Spanish wines, anecdotes and things of Spain; his wife too has sense:&#x2014;I got away about 11, not quite ruined, tho&#x2019; not intending to go back soon. Botheration!&#x2014; You are very welcome, as you always were, to write to Anthony Sterling, my dear, when you have anything to say to him. Nothing <hi rend="italic">wrong</hi> did I ever suspect you of meaning to say to him or to anybody; to <hi rend="italic">him</hi> as little as to some others:&#x2014;but I confess affairs there are reduced to a most absurd, distressing and even partly disgusting situation, on some sides; which is not to be mended for the present! Happily, as I would in any case get little or no good of poor A<hi rend="italic">y</hi>, my loss is the less. Let it stand then there. Poor Mrs A<hi rend="italic">y</hi> did not look a bit madder than usual; but has a wild glance in her eyes too. Those poor girls! I felt really sorry about them, poor young souls; I wish you or my self or any one could contrive some shadow of help for them in their present mad position.</p>
<p>Plattnauer came in the morning yesterday, as if you had been here; then begged to be admitted to <hi rend="italic">me</hi> with &#x201C;the news from France, for one moment&#x201C;; which took effect&#x2014;news all nonsense:&#x2014; &#x2014; &#x2014; Out upon it here is the horse, and I am not dressed a bit! Evidently I must <hi rend="italic">stop</hi>, tho&#x2019; my heart is sore to do it, Dearest, in this way for I had much more to say,&#x2014;at least in the way of clatter. Oh be good to me, good to thyself. Trust in me, I bid you! <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dearest.&#x2014; Yours ever</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I was truly vexed and shocked yesterday Ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi> on coming in for dinner to find that I had <hi rend="italic">left</hi> the Newspapers in my perilous hurry and that there they still were, on the &#x201C;pedestal drawers,&#x201C; where I had laid them when addressed. The Sterling <hi rend="italic">Horse</hi> came while I was writing a line to Jane, and had not yet got on any of my riding&#x2014;gear; so that the bustle was intense!&#x2014; I have got, this morning, a Note from Jean, which I enclose. Jamie&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Herald</hi> is never <hi rend="italic">yet</hi> come; but I send him today a <hi rend="italic">Carlisle Journal</hi> instead, which contains (I find) a Note of mine wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I had quite forgotten and which makes me <hi rend="italic">grin</hi> now on reading it.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably TC to RL, <date when="1851-09-20">20 Sept.</date></note> This did not come till 11 o&#x2019;clock today;&#x2014;and along with it, what is far more important, there came a Newspaper from Alick, which was the <pb id="pg-26-256" n="26:256"/>appointed signal of the <hi rend="italic">Stg</hi> Book&#x2019;s arrival in his hands: I send the cover and heading of the Canadian Dud, for my good Mother&#x2019;s sake, who will be glad to see it as I was. Jean says nothing about <hi rend="italic">her</hi>, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is a wonder: but I hope there has not anything gone wrong since I last heard;&#x2014;pray write, however, as soon as you have leisure.&#x2014; Jane describes herself as pleasantly occupied &#x201C;dressing seven dolls&#x201C; (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I suppose are school-gifts of Lady A.&#x2019;s), but troubled a little still with her fit of cold, which prevents her going out;&#x2014;even the &#x201C;Conservatory,&#x201C; a big covered place, is too damp and raw for her. I do not yet hear what day I am to go, but suppose it will be Saturday. I confess I have but little <foreign><hi rend="italic">brow</hi></foreign> of it all; but must go, as matters stand. I am very busy reading Seven-Years War Book; not with any particular outlook,&#x2014;merely to see, to see!</p>
<p>Farie came on me the other night on the street; insisted, as he usually does, on walking to Sloane Square with me. His sole news was rather bad: That the Erskines were come to Town on a sorrowful errand, poor Mrs Capt<hi rend="italic">n</hi> Paterson being dangerously ill,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >David Paterson, Thomas Erskine&#x2019;s sister, m. to James Paterson.</note>&#x2014;of some kind of pulmonary thing. Sir J<hi rend="italic">s</hi> Clark is attending her; small help in him, if it is a bad case! She had been about Torquay; but the Capt<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, so ill was she there, had brought her up for better advice. She and he were now &#x201C;somewhere ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Westbourn Terrace&#x201C;;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ca. 2&#xBD; mi. NNE of Cheyne Row.</note> Erskine and the other sister<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Christian Stirling, b.

I have yet seen none of them, nor know yet where precisely to seek them.&#x2014; Nothing farther from France of the smallest moment. L<hi rend="italic">s</hi> Napoleon has his way&#x2014;for the time.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On <date when="1851-12-03">3 Dec.</date> a group of republican deputies organized an uprising and barricades went up. Troops were called out, and the rising quickly collapsed, <date when="1851-12-04">4 Dec.</date>, resulting in many deaths of the insurgents. Arrests followed throughout Paris and the provinces.</note> So be it.&#x2014; &#x2014; <closer><salute>Tell me how my Mother is; and give my blessings to her and them all. <foreign>Adieu</foreign> dear Brother.</salute></closer></p>

Alas, tho&#x02019; I went to bed in tolerable time last night, I awoke an hour too late, and am considerably behind, especially as the <pb id="pg-26-257" n="26:257" />inexorable horse and 2&#xbd; p.m. are a fixed fact, to which every moment I am coming nearer! Probably we are now getting towards the close of our horse-work: the Capt<hi rend="italic">n</hi> told me on Sunday Ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi> he was in treaty for a new horse to himself that he might ride with the girls;&#x02014;which, in all respects <hi rend="italic">except</hi> contingent health, will suit me much better. Yet they are valuable feats, tho&#x02019; sad, those long solitary rides of mine: the mackintosh overalls defend me excellently from the cold; and, in sight of earth and sky, in those dim lanes, I go thro&#x02019; a deal of abstruse reflexion and emotion, on the outside of my swift-footed quadruped</p>
    <p>Yesterday my riding, courageous that I was, went towards Sampson and Coventry-Street, with my new waistcoat on me. I have had it repeatedly on, and it is the <hi rend="italic">warmest</hi> thing in the world; but it is far <hi rend="italic">too wide</hi>, big enough for Daniel Lambert<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss">Daniel Lambert (<date when="1770">1770</date>&#x02013;<date when="1809">1809</date>), &#x0201C;the steam-engine in trousers,&#x0201D; weighed 739 lbs. when he d.</note> about the neck and shoulders; so it is gone to be altered, the valiant Tailor at once undertaking when he saw it: my course afterwards was round the Regent&#x02019;s Park &#38;c, and home by the Rotten Row<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss">A wide circuit since Regent&#x02019;s Park is in NW London, and Rotten Row, a thoroughfare for saddle horses, on the S side of Hyde Park.</note> and swift galloping, in good time. I had also got my new Coat, which does extremely well (much darker in the colour than I had imagined,&#x02014;so much the better); but it wanted something at the <hi rend="italic">Cuffs</hi> (which are <hi rend="italic">not</hi> of velvet, but done in the ordinary fashion, by my 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi> order); wherefore it too is gone with the waistcoat; and tonight I expect confidently to receive them both complete, and so have <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> but enjoyment out of them henceforth.</p>
    <p>On Saturday night there came by Parcels Company a pair of half-worn reddish ribbed <hi rend="italic">female boots</hi>, with a roll of grey fur round the lip of them; addressed to you: they lie on my desk upstairs, that I may not forget whatever order you give me about them.&#x02014; On the same Saturday, in the morning, I did what is probably my chief act of virtue since you went. Namely, I decided not to walk, but to take water and a scrub-brush, and swash into some degree of tolerability those greasy clammy flags in the back area. I did it without rebuke of Anne, said &#x0201C;<hi rend="italic">she</hi> couldn&#x02019;t do it in her present state of illness&#x0201D;; and on the whole proceeded,&#x02014;and found it decidedly hard work for 3 quarters of an hour. Some ten or twelve pails of water, with vigorous scrubbing did, however, reduce the affair to order; whereupon I washed myself, and sat down to breakfast in victorious peace. &#x0201C;Dust shall not lie around <hi rend="italic">me</hi>,&#x0201D; said Cobbet, &#x0201C;so long as I can handle a broom.&#x0201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss">William Cobbett (<date when="1763">1763</date>&#x02013;<date when="1835">1835</date>), essayist, radical politician, and agriculturalist; cf. his <hi rend="italic">Cottage Economy</hi> (<date when="1822">1822</date>) 101; also 5:201.</note>&#x02014; By the way, Anne continues perceptibly better with this cold; and it must be said she is, so far as I can see, one of the most punctual respectable servants, and does everything perfectly for me: <pb id="pg-26-258" n="26:258" />but she has evidently no strength in these winter months; and I suppose will need, for one thing, some kind of Charwoman on Saturdays.</p>
    <p>Last night after tea, just when I had got my Books spread out, there entered Clough and another man, a very big, dark-visaged youth a young barrister friend of his:<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss">Unidentified.</note> they sat, with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> entertain<hi rend="italic">t</hi> from me, till near ten,&#x02014;sorrow on it! Then they went away; but the hours also were gone. Clough announced to me that he was a candidate now for some professorship of Classical Literature in New Holland: a new University they are founding in Sydney there! His &#x0201C;Hall,&#x0201D; he said, was evidently going to the dogs; and he, not being <hi rend="italic">reverend</hi>, nor even perhaps quite orthodox, had no fair prospect here; so he w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> try it in the other hemisphere. I grieve at the prospect of losing the ingenuous Clough, evidently a man of good head and honest purpose; but perhaps he is wise, after all, to do as he is now endeavouring.</p>
    <p>This morning there came nothing but a Letter from Jean at Dumfries; thanking for the Biography of &#x0201C;Trinal&#x0201D; (that is, <hi rend="italic">Kelty the Second</hi>):<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss">Untraced.</note> have not I a talent for turning things to use? <hi rend="italic">Item</hi> a Newspaper from poor Alick in Canada, which was the sign agreed upon for the safe arrival of the <hi rend="italic">Sterling&#x02019;s Life.</hi> Very good:&#x02014;by the way, I suppose there <hi rend="italic">is</hi> no doubt whatever ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> the arrival of those <hi rend="italic">Gully</hi> Books; but when you write to them again, you will give some hint of a question I suppose. Such neglect is not to be quite commended.</p>
    <p>Lady A<hi rend="italic">n</hi> has not written to me, nor sent your disgraceful doll&#x02019;s-cap; I have heard nothing about the <hi rend="italic">Macaire</hi><note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss">Apparently someone trying to get help from the Ashburtons, so called by TC after Robert Macaire, a rogue made famous in Honor&#x000E9; Daumier&#x02019;s cartoons (see <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380915-TC-JWC-01"><sic>10:179</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1838-09-15">15 Sept. 1838</date></corr></ref>), or looking like the character in the play <hi rend="italic">Robert Macaire</hi> (<date when="1834">1834</date>) by F.

If I could save her Ladyship a journey to Addiscombe in this damp weather by riding out as her substitute, and reporting upon Painters, rebuking them, or doing anything else, it would be very easy indeed, and perhaps a good work?

<p><hi rend="small-caps">Professor Blackie</hi> is known to me, as to all the world, for a man of lively intellectual faculties, of ardent friendly character, and of wide speculation and acquirement. His tendencies, I have perceived, are thoroughly modern; he is well acquainted with Continental improvements; in all things he means sincerely; is of hopeful, rapid nature, very fearless, very kindly, without ill-humour and without guile. Of his classical and other literary attainments the translation of &#xc6;schylus is good evidence. His skill in practical teaching, too, I believe, has long been known. On the whole, he seems well calculated to do honour to the Edinburgh Chair of Greek.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Blackie was apptd. to the chair, <date when="1852-03">March 1852</date>.</note></p>

<p>Lady A told you I had a <hi rend="italic">headach;</hi> she said; so you would understand, Dear, that I did not write yesterday, for the very good reason that I <hi rend="italic">couldn&#x2019;t.</hi> Believe me I wished <hi rend="small-caps">to</hi>! The condition of things here for the last few days has been an impressive Sermon for me, if any such were, needed, on the inanity of &#x201C;Ornament and Grandeur&#x201C;&#x2014;but as I have extremely little strength to write with, I need not be spending any of it in moralizing, for the benefit too of &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">The Greatest Thinker of the Age</hi>&#x201C;! Neither, as I am to see you in so few days, need I expatiate much on the Narrative side&#x2014;a bulletin of the Family health <pb id="pg-26-260" n="26:260"/>is what you will chiefly desire&#x2014;but as I was sealing my note on Sunday, I was sent for to Lady A&#x2019;s room to be told that she had a threatening of cold, and that I must try to keep Lady Sandwich in good humour, as she (Lady A did not mean to go further than her sitting room&#x2014;and would &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">not</hi> see Lady S <hi rend="italic">there</hi>, for the whole world.&#x201C;&#x2014; The task was not a very easy one under the circumstances&#x2014;Lady S wished to go to see her daughter naturally, and I had to invent one excuse after another&#x2014;about &#x201C;the passages being too cold for her&#x201C; &#x26;c &#x26;c&#x2014; Monday it was the same thing Lady A in her sitting room, Lady S often in tears to me and I only too happy if I would tell lies <hi rend="italic">enough</hi> to pacify her. Then when I went to Lady A she crossquestioned me always about what Lady S was saying and doing&#x2014;and to her also I had to tell lies&#x2014;at least I had to conceal the truth or I should have made things worse between them&#x2014; The <hi rend="italic">fret</hi> of all that together with so much going backwards and forwards thro the really &#x201C;cold passages&#x201C; made my own cold much worse, and yesterday it gathered itself into a horrid headach&#x2014;I went down to breakfast&#x2014;but while sitting with Lady A I had to get up and declare myself too ill to remain so I passed the day in bed admirably &#x201C;well let alone,&#x201C; seeing no human face till half after six when a housemaid brought me hot water for dressing, I <hi rend="italic">drank</hi> some of it and begged of her to procure me a cup of tea instead of dinner and by ten I was able to get up and pay a little visit first to Lady Sandwich&#x2014;and then to Lady A who had both sent to ask me to come &#x201C;so soon as I was well enough&#x201C;&#x2014;Lady Sandwich it appeared had been all day ill in <hi rend="italic">her</hi> room with a bowel-complaint&#x2014;&#x201C;the state of her health&#x201C; rendering it necessary for her &#x201C;soon to return to London&#x201C;&#x2014; I went to bed at 11 and lay trying <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to fly thro the ceiling till four in the morning, when my patience could hold out no longer and I rose and swallowed some morphine&#x2014;it put me to sleep&#x2014;but, there being nothing in my stomach but <hi rend="italic">tea</hi> for it to &#x201C;plump into,&#x201C; it made me so sick that morning that I retched till I brought up some blood!&#x2014;and there was some mistake about my breakfast so that I could get none till eleven o&#x2019;clock! On the whole &#x201C;the state of my health was such&#x201C; that I also began to think of &#x201C;returning to London&#x201C;&#x2014; After having got, at last, some hot tea however the sickness left me, and I am now no worse than in the first days&#x2014;and it is very evidently desirable that I should <hi rend="italic">stay</hi>, if I can at all keep <hi rend="italic">about;</hi> for Lady A caught some fresh cold over night and has sent off to Sir J Clark for <hi rend="italic">medecines</hi> and is to keep her bed till they come&#x2014; And Lady Sandwich is also in <hi rend="italic">bed</hi> today&#x2014; with much the worst cold of the three I think&#x2014; And the prospect of all these people on Saturday! Besides, I shall now be better looked to&#x2014;Lady Sandwich insisting on sending <hi rend="italic">her</hi> maid to ask my wishes and get me anything I want&#x2014; If I were a Unitarian I might be perfectly happy in &#x201C;virtues own reward&#x201C;&#x2014;it is so seldom one can get a stroke at a good action&#x2014;and really if I had not been here just now but some other&#x2014;with less <pb id="pg-26-261" n="26:261"/><hi rend="italic">discretion</hi>&#x2014;and plenty of such Indiscreets come here&#x2014; Lady S would I think have been off and the Devil to pay&#x2014;</p>
<p>&#x2014;Enough however&#x2014;you will be here on Saturday and will find us all better I hope&#x2014; Lady A of course has given up all thought of London&#x2014; I read her your offer and she laughed very heartily at the terrors of the Painters should <hi rend="italic">you</hi> take to &#x2018;rebuking them&#x2019;</p>

<p>I don&#x2019;t know what I was &#x201C;born with in my mouth&#x201C; but it couldn&#x2019;t have been &#x201C;a silver spoon&#x201C; anyhow,&#x2014;and if anyone ever presented me with <hi rend="italic">a charm</hi>, I must have left it, I think, beside my teacup. For certainly there is not &#x201C;in all England&#x201C; (your grandfather&#x2019;s phrase) a poor woman more liable than myself to having &#x201C;the pigs&#x201C; run thro&#x2019; things!&#x2014; Here have I been living these ten days in the midst of &#x201C;a terrestrial Paradise,&#x201C;&#x2014;&#x201C;woods and wilds whose melancholy gloom &#x26;c&#x201C; terraces and fountains and artificial lakes, &#x201C;regardless of expense&#x201C;&#x2014;and for any good I have been able to take of it all, I might as well have remained sitting before my own dead wall in Cheyne Row!&#x2014; <hi rend="italic">Not once</hi> have I crossed the threshold my Dear! and am thankful to have had only <hi rend="italic">one</hi> day in <hi rend="italic">bed</hi>&#x2014; The cold I caught so suddenly <hi rend="italic">that night</hi> became much worse on my arrival here&#x2014;and has kept me so thoroughly wretched, that I really think I should have gone home ere now, to my own red bed, but for the fact that both <pb id="pg-26-262" n="26:262"/>Lady Ashburton and Lady Sandwich have fallen ill also&#x2014;and even <hi rend="italic">as I am</hi> I am <hi rend="italic">up to</hi> more than either of <hi rend="italic">them</hi>, and can do them some good by staying&#x2014; I don&#x2019;t <hi rend="italic">go</hi> much <hi rend="italic">on doing good</hi>, in a general way, all that unitarian twaddle about &#x201C;thinking only of <hi rend="italic">others</hi>&#x201C; &#x201C;studying the welfare of <hi rend="italic">others</hi>&#x201C; &#x26;c &#x26;c I leave to Miss Rankin<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Isabella Rankin, Harriet Martineau&#x2019;s maternal cousin and former &#x201C;very lackadaisical governess&#x201C; of John Sterling&#x2019;s children (see <ref target="volume-24/lt-18491110-JWC-JAC-01"><sic>24:284</sic><corr>JWC to JAC, <date when="1849-11-10">10 Nov. 1849</date></corr></ref>).</note> and the like of her&#x2014;but Lady Ashburton has been extremely kind to me for many years&#x2014;and our relative positions afford so few opportunities for my showing her any <hi rend="italic">practical</hi> gratitude that when one <hi rend="italic">does</hi> offer itself I am naturally very glad to seize it&#x2014; Lord A has been from home for a week and if I were not here to sit with her in her bedroom, her situation amidst all her grandeur would be rather desolate&#x2014; And as for Lady Sandwich with her french manners it requires all the good sense I can bring to bear on her to keep her <hi rend="italic">quiet</hi>&#x2014; There being about a quarter of a mile of corridors and staircases between the bedrooms of the two; I get plenty of <hi rend="italic">indoors</hi> exercise, at least, in travelling, from the one to the other!&#x2014;but in this way I have hardly any time to myself&#x2014;to write my own letters or think my own thoughts&#x2014;besides that when I do get to my own room for a little while I need to lie on my sofa with my eyes shut&#x2014;to rest my wearied spirit&#x2014; I look forward to Saturday with perfect terror&#x2014;the House is to be filled with people on that day&#x2014;and if Lady A cannot appear I shall have to <hi rend="italic">do</hi> them all myself&#x2014;with <hi rend="italic">this cold!</hi> While Lady A was coughing and blowing her nose this morning <hi rend="italic">I</hi> was taken with a violent fit of <hi rend="italic">sneezing</hi>&#x2014; &#x201C;Gracious!&#x201C; she exclaimed when she could speak &#x201C;what <hi rend="italic">do</hi> you suppose M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle is the meaning of all this?&#x201C;&#x2014; &#x201C;I could do without knowing the <hi rend="italic">meaning</hi> of it I said, if I could only predict the <hi rend="italic">end</hi> of it&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">what</hi> is going to become of us on Saturday&#x201C;!&#x2014; &#x201C;Oh the end&#x2014;, said she&#x2014;of the end there can be <hi rend="italic">no</hi> doubt&#x2014; M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Salmon<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henry Salmon.</note> will have to come and read the funeral service over us all&#x2014;and I shall send him a note today to prepare him!&#x201C;&#x2014;</p>

<place>Chelsea</place>, <date when="1851-12-11">11 dec<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, 1851</date>&#x2014;</dateline>
<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Yesterday morning I had your welcome Note; just about the same time one from me w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> reach you, along with the belated Newspapers. Jamie&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Herald</hi> goes at length today, having arrived last night.&#x2014; I am very thankful for your news; tho&#x2019; it is sad, in my solitude, to think of my poor good Mother confined now mostly to bed, as the safest place for her! But what can we say? After all, I suppose it is fairly the best she can make of it; and she does, loyally always, and with cheerful readiness, the thing she must do;&#x2014;a right brave example for us all, now as heretofore, the good old Mother! That you are there, with Marg<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Austin to assist, is a most comfortable circumstance for me.</p>
<p>I have been often thinking of Adamson&#x2019;s Letter, and the <hi rend="italic">some</hi> answer<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> that must be given:&#x2014;all answers are so extremely foreign to my present form of industries here! It is chiefly with an eye to that that I have now taken this roomy sheet (excellent <hi rend="italic">paper</hi> too,&#x2014;thanks to the useful Chorley!) for the purpose of throwing down some hasty statement of my notions to <hi rend="italic">you</hi> on the subject,&#x2014;to you, by way of preliminary.</p>
<p>I think, in the first place, Jamie ought to go;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >To Craigenputtoch.</note> and look his <hi rend="italic">best</hi>, not at the houses only, but at the general condition of the grounds and of Macqueen&#x2019;s management, also to inform himself about this new Macqueen&#x2019;s general <hi rend="italic">substantiality</hi> or the contrary; and, on the whole, to make up his mind the <pb id="pg-26-264" n="26:264"/>best he can as to whether there is really any considerable chance to get a better offer, after advertising, than M<hi rend="italic">n</hi> now presents before and without such trouble.&#x2014; Beyond doubt, &#xa3;20 additional per year are not to be despised: but at the same time, <hi rend="italic">change</hi> of any kind is an evil; and if this man pays his rent and is like to do so, and behave well, giving no trouble, he might prove far preferable to another <hi rend="italic">offering</hi> higher, and performing very differently. Let Jamie guess what the farm is really <hi rend="italic">worth</hi>, as things go;&#x2014;and on the whole let him decide, as if for himself, whether we are to take Macqueen with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> further advertising, or to make an attempt for a better? You and he and Adamson (to whom I will write authorising you, so soon as you permit) will surely be able to do better in it, than anything I here c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> devise by way of result.</p>
<p>As to the House, I have often tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> how welcome such a place might be to me by way of shelter for a month in the summer now and then; but practically the difficulties of keeping it open are, I fear I must admit for my own part, <hi rend="italic">insuperable.</hi> Jane does not like it, never did; and to me either it was never lovely, it was only safe and solitary! On your side I perceive there is transiently some vague look, analogous to my own, in that direction? I can only say, If there is any arrangement you could form whereby my Mother or yourself could get any good of that poor Mansion, I should be only too happy to comply and cooperate in all rational ways! But I fear there will practically turn out to be <hi rend="italic">none;</hi>&#x2014;and whether, in the fine season of the year, our poor Mother could do any good there by way of variety (<hi rend="italic">retaining</hi> her Scotsbrig establish<hi rend="italic">t</hi>, of course); or whether it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not at all times be too solitary and dull for her, even with you there? These are questions which I cannot answer here, but which must be well considered before anything is done.&#x2014; I know only it used to be a capital place for getting work accomplished! Fully <hi rend="italic">twice</hi> as much, of reading or other labour, was possible for me there within a given time as I have ever got managed here.&#x2014; On the whole, in this too, <hi rend="italic">you</hi> must judge what possibilities there are. For my own particular behoof, and on my own resources, I can make <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> of the House except give it in charge to the farmer of the place: that, after all my speculatings, is the conclusion I have reluctantly had to come to.</p>
<p>Pray let Jamie, therefore, address himself to this as soon as convenient for him; and do you consider what you can without very much bother do for me in it. I will then write <hi rend="italic">finally</hi> to Adamson, appointing a meeting (if you think well of that), and so have the matter <hi rend="italic">settled</hi> one way or other. Some kind of prefigurement, to that or another effect, I must write to him one of these days (<hi rend="italic">not</hi> till after hearing from you again), for I have otherwise a Letter to send him, about <hi rend="italic">money</hi> that will be needed.&#x2014; I think you have here some outline of what my notion of the business is; and so I will leave it with you for this time.</p>
<p>On Saturday, it appears, I am to go to The Grange,&#x2014;with Lord A<hi rend="italic">n</hi> who is <pb id="pg-26-265" n="26:265"/>hereabouts just now. A quantity of people are going; none of them very interesting to me; some of them decidedly the reverse! You shall hear a little how we get on: directly <hi rend="italic">after</hi> Christ<hi rend="italic">s</hi>, perhaps the very next day, it is to end. Poor Jane writes to me this morning that they are all three (Lady A<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, her Mother and Jane) somewhat on the invalid list,&#x2014;poor Jane had a whole day of headache, and was &#x201C;excellently well let alone&#x201C; she says! She is now better again, and the rest too have got out of their rooms. Our weather here is decidedly <hi rend="italic">fine;</hi> warm and clammy in general, but today and yesterday much drier and even with sun in force.&#x2014; &#x2014; Poor Louis Blanc had run over to Paris to superintend; and was laid hold of, poor little wretch, and now lies in limbo: that is the only addit<hi rend="italic">l</hi> news.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The socialist leader had been in London since <date when="1848-08">Aug. 1848</date>; on return to France he was arrested, but he soon came back to England.</note> I am very busy still on F<hi rend="italic">k</hi> the Great and his Battles.&#x2014; Take care of my Mother! Has she anything good to read? <closer><salute>My blessings on her and on you all. Ever your aff<hi rend="italic">e</hi></salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>Dear Lady,&#x2014;</salute>On Monday morning there was some tradition of a Letter from you, but no Letter came; none came on Tuesday, nor on Wednesday either,&#x2014;at least not till night, being &#x201C;accidentally de<hi rend="italic">laid</hi>&#x201C; (some Postman said),&#x2014;and, in the interim, little Fleming,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henry Fleming.</note> in Piccadilly, had told me you were &#x201C;ill and confined to your room these two days&#x201C;; so that the Letter itself, when I found it on returning home, was rather a relief to me on that head. But surely y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> general bulletin of health, coupled with my Wife&#x2019;s of this morning, is rather a sorry one. All ill at once, days <supplied>[of]</supplied><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> sore-throat, day of headache, poor Lady Sandwich also ill: three &#x201C;unprotected females&#x201C; decidedly in no good way!&#x2014; However, we shall see with our own eyes the day after tomorrow; we will hope much may have improved before that time. I have written to Lord A. to give me warning of his hour; which I will conform to;&#x2014;and if anything go <hi rend="italic">wrong</hi> on Saturday, I hope it will be his blame and not mine; punctual and correct in all things as I mean to shew myself!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Macaire has not made his appearance; nor perhaps will, after my former message at Greek Street: but if he do, I shall be ready for him. The unfortunate creature seems to be very clearly, if not a swindler (which I do not think), a lazy vagabond lout who has got into the way of living by <hi rend="italic">beggary;</hi> in which <pb id="pg-26-266" n="26:266"/>course there is not the least reason why you should aid or confirm him: let him take her Majesty&#x2019;s bounty, and apply to the drill-serjeant since he cannot guide his own steps better! Such &#x201C;pathos,&#x201C; unattended by proper veritable exertion, on the part of a stout young fellow, a yard across the shoulders, and weighing sixteen stone avoirdupois, is not pretty but disgusting.</p>
<p>I have had ten days of a <hi rend="italic">silence</hi>&#x2014;equal to that of Jonah in the Whale&#x2019;s Belly; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> perhaps wasn&#x2019;t quite <hi rend="italic">silent</hi> either! <closer><salute>Oh my Lady, my Lady! Good be with you&#x2014;till Saturday. Yours ever</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>My poor little Dear,&#x2014;</salute>These surely are but indifferent news!

<p>A thick black fog; one of the clammiest of dark days! How is your poor head, your poor throat with its cold? I need not ask,&#x2014;till tomorrow.&#x2014; Hurry as usual is extreme!</p>

<p>Last night, just as tea was in prospect, and the hope of a quiet busy evening to a <hi rend="italic">day</hi> completely <hi rend="italic">lost</hi>,&#x2014;enter, with a loud knock, poor Canadian W. Graham leading his little boy:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified, but William Graham had had two or three brothers who emigrated to the U.S.</note> a huge hairy goodhumoured stupid-looking fellow, the size of a house-gabel, and all over with hair except a little patch of the crown wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> was bald;&#x2014;the boy noisy snappish and inclined to be of himself intolerable. I gave them tea; tried to talk: poor W. has no talent: you expect goodhumoured <hi rend="italic">idiomatic</hi> simplicity at least, and you do not get even that; he <hi rend="italic">turns</hi> like a door on a hinge from every kind of opinion or assertion, and is a &#x201C;Colossus of gossamer.&#x201C;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Untraced.</note> They bored me to death;&#x2014;and at half-past <pb id="pg-26-268" n="26:268"/>9, to comple<supplied>[te]</supplied><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letters omitted.</note> the matter, Saffi enters! Oh Heaven, the whole night, like the day, was a painful wreck for the rational soul of man!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Macaire has been here this morning: You can tell Lady A. I literally cut him off with a shilling. He looked blue and miserable; but is evidently a lazy <hi rend="italic">Beggar</hi>, and like to be nothing better: I let him know clearly he had quite cut himself off from Bath House by his ambiguous <hi rend="italic">chiaroscuro</hi> ways;&#x2014;and ought perhaps as the wisest he c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> now do, to take the Sergeant&#x2019;s shilling: he started up in a kind of pretended paroxysm, and went on his way. My shilling w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> get him a pot of beer; that was all one c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> do for him.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Let me send you a single word from this scene of hurry and confusion, to signify merely that we are here and safe; more is not possible just now, for I write in the drawingroom (for the sake of fire, my own room being <hi rend="italic">cold</hi> beyond tolerability), and there are <hi rend="italic">ten</hi> people babbling and talking round me in every form of noisy tattle: heigho!&#x2014; &#x2014; I came down on Saturday, according to program; six of us [two lines torn away] and towards four, [several words torn away] <supplied>[sa]</supplied><hi rend="italic">turated</hi>, I, with emptyish talk and anecdote &#x26;c about Paris and Louis Napoleon;&#x2014;very glad to have a cup of tea and a little silence. We, that is we <hi rend="italic">two</hi>, it appears, are to stay till the day after Christmas;&#x2014;some of us are already rather impatient for that term than otherwise!</p>
<p>Poor Jane has had a cold all this while, almost a constant headache, and is still decidedly out of sorts. Both Lady A. and her Mother have been and still are ailing; poor Jane had to officiate as &#x201C;Sister of [line torn away] of her [line torn away]all a little [several words torn away] <hi rend="italic">temperance</hi>, and rigid <hi rend="italic">abstinence</hi> from all manner of grand luxuries provided here, contrive to get along better or worse.&#x2014; Other people are coming, Macaulay, L<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Grey &#x26;c, but none that are interesting to me; and as to any species of <hi rend="italic">work</hi>, that is once for all impossible.&#x2014; Alas, they are <hi rend="italic">calling</hi> to me specially; even this miserable scribble must come to an end!

<salute>Dearest Helen</salute>
<p>Thanks for your letter&#x2014;it was a drop of comfort in a raw grim morning when a long continued headach was driving me to despair&#x2014; This visit has been very successful in one sense&#x2014; I have been of manifestly great use to &#x201C;others&#x201C;&#x2014;but so far as myself is concerned nothing could have turned out worse&#x2014; I cannot get accross the threshold for the unlucky cold I caught at the outset and the confinement tells dreadfully on my head and my sleep&#x2014; For the last ten days I have had a <hi rend="italic">constant</hi> headach! and under that condition have been required to <hi rend="italic">keep up the spirits</hi> and watch over the health of both Lady Sandwich and Lady Ashburton who have also been ill with colds and keeping their rooms in opposite ends of the house so that I have been always catching fresh dozes of cold in passing along some quarter of a mile of corridors and staircases&#x2014;only <hi rend="italic">one</hi> day I had fairly to give up and lie in bed with a crisis of headach&#x2014;and that day I was so admirably &#x201C;Well <hi rend="italic">let alone</hi>&#x201C;!&#x2014;that I saw distinct prospect of being <hi rend="small-caps">starved</hi> to death&#x2014;if I continued unable to take my victuals in the great dining room, all <hi rend="italic">alone</hi> with a pack of men servants hovering over me like a flight of crows!&#x2014; Let nobody wish to possess forty thousand a year! I assure you the real advantages are few and the intolerabilities many and indisputable&#x2014; For real comfort&#x2014;even for the <hi rend="italic">goodness</hi> and wholesomeness of the things one <hi rend="italic">eats</hi>&#x2014;I think my own little house&#x2014;never to say <hi rend="italic">yours</hi>&#x2014;infinitely before this one with its tremendous <hi rend="italic">state</hi> and French Man Cook at 100 ayear&#x2014;</p>
<p>On the 13<hi rend="italic">th</hi> when the first detachment of visitors arrived Lady A and Lady Sandwich were still confined to their rooms&#x2014;and I who was quite as ill as either of them had to <hi rend="italic">do</hi> all the company myself&#x2014;show them their rooms&#x2014; <pb id="pg-26-270" n="26:270"/>make tea for them <hi rend="italic">before</hi> dinner&#x2014;&#x26;c &#x26;c Carlyle being among them however was an immense comfort&#x2014;for I knew that if I should again be reduced to <hi rend="italic">bed <hi rend="small-caps">he</hi> would bring me some food</hi>!!&#x2014; The Ladies appeared next day however and are now up to any amount of &#x201C;wits&#x201C;</p>
<p>We talk the French revolution from morning till night; till I am perfectly sick of it&#x2014; All agree&#x2014;that is the Statesmen here agree&#x2014;that the success of Louis Napoleon is inevitable and &#x201C;necessary for the preservation of order&#x201C;&#x2014; Every body gets letters from Paris with the contents of which the rest of us are favoured&#x2014; Even <hi rend="italic">I</hi> had a letter from my <hi rend="italic">one</hi> correspondent in Paris&#x2014;Charlotte Williams Wynn&#x2014;which I will enclose to amuse my Uncle&#x2014; And we are living in <hi rend="italic">daily</hi> or rather hourly expectation of the arrival of Thiers! who was to be in London last night they said&#x2014;and would find a letter from Lady A inviting him here instantly&#x2014;moreover Valeski the French Ambassador is Lady Sandwich&#x2019;s son in law and his present wife writes to Lady S daily<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Count Alexandre Florian Joseph Colonna Walewski had been French ambassador to Spain earlier in the year and then to Britain.

<salute>My dear Julia</salute>
<p>I <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> write a reasonable letter under the present circumstances but here are two lines to bear witness that I am alive, and thinking of you all; grateful for your letters&#x2014;and desiring more letters&#x2014; For the rest; till within the last two days I have been struggling on under the same difficulties&#x2014;incessant headach, and plenty of <hi rend="italic">cold</hi>&#x2014; The others are restored to health and society&#x2014;tho&#x2019; when the first detachment of visitors arrived they were still confined to their rooms. Happily M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle being among these I was relieved from the apprehension of probably death&#x2014;from <hi rend="italic">starvation</hi>&#x2014; Had I been reduced at last to <hi rend="italic">keep my bed</hi>, with no <hi rend="italic">maid</hi> of my own, and no hope of &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">ravens</hi>&#x2019;;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ravens fed Elijah by the brook Cherith; see 1 Kings 17:4&#x2013;6.</note> it were hard to say thro&#x2019; what means I could have procured even bread and water!&#x2014; Oh let nobody wish to possess 40,000 a year!&#x2014;who wishes to be <hi rend="italic">comfortable</hi> himself and to make others comfortable&#x2014; My heart never went after money, and every day I see more reason to question its desirableness&#x2014; Meanwhile I have shaken off the worst of my cold, and have risen the two last mornings without headach, and can go thro the heavy work of the day&#x2014;talking&#x2014;&#x201C;<hi rend="italic">making</hi> <hi rend="small-caps">wits</hi>&#x201C; (as Bolte called it) <hi rend="italic">if</hi> possible&#x2014;but at all rates <hi rend="italic">talking</hi>&#x2014;with less of internal protest to the Universe and appeal to posterity.&#x2014; The never failing topic is this beastly Revolution; not that anyone takes any real interest in it, but that every one flatters him and herself to carry his and her head a little higher than the rest on the strength of individual perspicacity, or of the <hi rend="italic">news</hi> received by post from &#x201C;authentic sources&#x201C;&#x2014; Lady A&#x2019;s letters from Thiers however enable <hi rend="italic">her</hi> to appear at breakfast, as triumphant in the news-line as she is in <hi rend="italic">all</hi> other lines&#x2014; Indeed all yesterday we were expecting the little scoundrel to arrive here bodily an invitation having been sent to London to await him there&#x2014; But today we hear he is only <pb id="pg-26-272" n="26:272"/>to arrive in London tomorrow and as he must go first to Clermont<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thiers had to call at Claremont Pk., Surrey, 14 mi.

<p>My Dear! if you will only consider that Macauley is flowing on like a mill-dam within three feet of my ear, and that the second and third greatest talkers of the age are trying to get in an occasional sentence you will admire the power of abstraction that has enabled me to write even this much&#x2014; There is a room on each side of this one furnished with writing apparatus but Lady Sandwich has established herself at the one writing table and a M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Mildmay at the other; besides that Macauley&#x2019;s voice is painfully audible thro <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the rooms&#x2014; Up stairs in my own room they had let my fire go out&#x2014;and I used my last <hi rend="italic">match</hi> yesterday, in sealing the letter to Nero&#x2014;so there was no resource but to set down here in the middle of the great drawing room&#x2014;to &#x201C;pursue <hi rend="italic">friendship</hi> under difficulties&#x201C;&#x2014;</p>

<salute>My dear Jean,</salute>
<p>You must accept in good part this hurried single word, which is all I can send you from this scene of bustle and confusion: it will serve to assure you that we are tolerably well,&#x2014;where we are, I think, you already know;&#x2014;and that little bit of information will be nearly all the good it can do you. Judging by the quantity of <hi rend="italic">work</hi> we accomplish here, one might suppose we should have ample time for letters at least: but that, owing to various causes, is by no means the fact, but indeed quite the reverse of it; and, to one of my nervous temperament, and entirely quiet habitudes, it is often next to impossible to get even a letter written at any of the hours available to me for objects of <pb id="pg-26-273" n="26:273"/>my own! Hoohooh, &#x201C;Ornament and grandeur&#x201C;&#x2014;I have no great <foreign><hi rend="italic">brow</hi></foreign> of them at all!</p>
<p>We have great people here, Lord Grey, Lord Lansdowne, a good portion of the Majesty ministry (with their wives); but except on the outside view, all this does not amount to very much; after one has seen these high dignitaries once or twice, the look of them to one is little better than that of other agreeable bonny men. Macaulay was here for two days,&#x2014;another kind of greatness; not entirely stupendous either. He and I did very well together, however; and I felt his departure a real loss to the party. This celebrated man, tho&#x2019; perhaps not worth the tenth part of the celebrating, is a really good sort of soul: grandson of a Highland Minister,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Macaulay (<date when="1720">1720</date>&#x2013;<date when="1789">89</date>), latterly Church of Scotland minister of Cardross, Dumbartonshire, <date when="1776">1776</date>&#x2013;<date when="1789">89</date>.</note> and really very much (intrinsically) like a Highland Minister himself, tho&#x2019; &#x201C;preaching&#x201C; in a very different element, and with a stipend immensely enlarged!&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>Gifted Gilfillan,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Gilfillan&#x2019;s unsigned review in the <hi rend="italic">Eclectic Review</hi> 104 (<date when="1851-12">Dec. 1851</date>):717&#x2013;29, begins by praising the biography as one of TC&#x2019;s pleasanter works but ends with a postscript expressing strong agreement with the severe attack on it in the <hi rend="italic">Times.</hi> Gilfillan&#x2019;s letters to Sydney Dobell show a fascination with TC combined with a fear or dislike of his teaching, seeing him as someone who &#x201C;laughs at, if not abuses us both,&#x201C; and detesting the &#x201C;infidel &#x2026; rabble-rout of Carlylists&#x201C; in Edinburgh (Watson, <hi rend="italic">George Gilfillan</hi> 138 and 142).</note> I noticed in the last <hi rend="italic">Critic</hi>,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The review in the <hi rend="italic">Critic</hi> n.s. 10 (<date when="1851-10-15">15 Oct.</date> and <date when="1851-11-01">1 Nov. 1851</date>): 478&#x2013;80, 507&#x2013;9, unsigned but evidently not by Gilfillan, is entirely favorable and mostly a summary.</note> is very crabbed upon me about the <hi rend="italic">Life of Sterling.</hi> He is, upon the whole, a considerable of an ass; and ought to try to keep his temper, or at least to carry a civil tongue in his head. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Jean: we <hi rend="italic">hope</hi> to be home <hi rend="italic">this day week</hi> or so, and not long after that, you shall have hint of us again.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Your Letter came this morning: I am surely much obliged to you and Jamie for the great trouble you have taken so promptly about Craigenputtoch, and to you farther for the copious report you have given me of your expedition thither. I must endeavour to come to some decision, and write to Adamson today, or at least in time for Wednesday; but what I am to say is still rather dark to me, I hope on the whole we shall be able to keep M&#x2019;Queen; all change is more or less wasteful, uncertain, liable to risk, and will at any rate involve <pb id="pg-26-274" n="26:274"/>one in considerable quantities of trouble. He ought to give the fair rent too, however; and we must not quite let him stick at the &#xa3;180, if the real value is &#xa3;200.</p>
<p>We are going on well enough here, tho&#x2019; not with any great enjoyment of ourselves, and certainly with perpetual small bother, owing to the change of all one&#x2019;s habits and ways. Happily Jane&#x2019;s cold is much better, and her headache as good as quite gone; I too, tho&#x2019; always in a rather queasy confused state, am getting accustomed to my strange late hours, and saunter about in the most composed manner I can,&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">doing</hi> &#x201C;donothingism&#x201C; quietly, since that is the only task at present. We have had Macaulay for two days: he was a real acquisition while he lasted, and gave rise to much good talk, besides an immense quantity of indifferent which he himself executed A man of truly wonderful historical <hi rend="italic">memory</hi>, which he has tried in really extensive reading, and has always lying ready with this or the other fact date or anecdote on demand: in other respects, constantly definable as the sublime of commonplace; not one of whose ideas has the least tincture of greatness or originality or any kind of superior merit except neatness of expression, <foreign><hi rend="italic">valde mediocris homo</hi></foreign> [a truly mediocre man]. He speaks with a kind of <foreign><hi rend="italic">gowstering</hi></foreign> emphasis; laughs occasionally (<hi rend="italic">not</hi> at things really ludicrous, but when a laugh is demanded by the exigencies of the case) with a loud wooden but frank and goodnatured tone:&#x2014;he is on the whole a man of really peaceable kindly temper, and superior sincerity in his Whig way;&#x2014;a strange flat-soled <hi rend="italic">awkwardness</hi> in him under all his shining rhetoric:&#x2014;now and then he reminded me of a spiritual <hi rend="italic">Hippopotamus;</hi> and we cheerfully let him shine as &#x201C;the sublime of Commonplace.&#x201C; I felt him really to be a loss when he went yesterday morning.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Macaulay, at the Grange, <date when="1851-12-17">17</date>&#x2013;<date when="1851-12-19">19 Dec.</date>, wrote in his journal: &#x201C;Carlyle and I tried to be mutually civil, but with mutual repulsion. His cant makes me sick&#x201C; (quoted <hi rend="italic">Letters of Macaulay</hi> 5:209n). Macaulay believed that his &#x201C;is an age at which we are disposed to think that whatever is odd and extravagant is great. At that age we are liable to be taken in by such essayists as Carlyle,&#x201C; who is &#x201C;absurdly overpraised&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 5:194, 4:11).</note></p>
<p>Many have gone, Ellice (called &#x201C;the Bear&#x201C;), Poodle Byng, Villiers &#x26;c, and others have come and are coming: we are a fluctuating society here. Our grandest lights at present are Lords Landsdowne and Grey, with women pertaining to the latter; one Landseer, a little Painter,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sir Edwin Henry Landseer.</note> very goodhumoured anecdotic little creature; Chancellors of the Exchequer and I know not whom are due today. Heigho! or as Grahame has it better, &#x201C;Oh Whow!&#x201C;&#x2014; &#x2014; The worst of it is one has not a moment&#x2019;s time; and it is hardly possible to get even a Letter written, so incessant, so uncertain, is the bustle round and in one. My <hi rend="italic">best</hi> employment is the solitary ride I get almost daily; which leads me into vacant rural places, with the winter silence and a great grey sky over me; <pb id="pg-26-275" n="26:275"/>things sad and solemn, not unmixed with profit and even enjoyment, are one&#x2019;s companions in such an expedition thro&#x2019; the lanes and woods. Our weather is constantly dim and warm, often quite windless; we have never yet, except slightly yesterday, had anything wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> could be denominated rain.</p>
<p>I am very glad to hear of my Mother&#x2019;s being still in her usual way: the days are now at the <hi rend="italic">shortest;</hi> they will henceforth daily grow longer, and we shall all do better by and by. Tell her to be quiet and keep as warm as she can: patient, pious and hopeful she will still be, as she always was.</p>
<p>I mean to write to Jamie or some of them soon after I get home. Today I will not continue farther; having various little scrapings of things to do&#x2014;under difficulties. I hear Jane&#x2019;s voice from the babble of the other room, but must not expressly <hi rend="italic">ask</hi> her for any message: she was glad to hear her Letter <hi rend="italic">had</hi> reached me, and that my assurances to her on that head were valid. <closer><salute>Give my best love to my ever-dear good Mother, and to all the rest as if I had named them.</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I have just written to Adamson explaining myself definitely about Craigenputtoch. I have said that we must try for &#xa3;200 of rent; that he is straightway to offer it to M&#x2019;Queen at that sum, I engaging to do any <hi rend="italic">draining</hi> &#x26;c that may be reasonable. I have said that if M&#x2019;Q<hi rend="italic">n refuse</hi>, Adamson and <hi rend="italic">you</hi> must decide about advertising;&#x2014;but that (privately) in fine I think that M&#x2019;Queen at &#xa3;190 is to be preferred to any general stranger at &#xa3;200. As to the House, I have admitted that it was very little likely ever to be required by us, but that if a clause was introduced <hi rend="italic">impowering</hi> us to require it and the field on an abatement of &#xa3;10 or <hi rend="italic">so</hi>, it might be good; and also that something sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be covenanted about the <hi rend="italic">hedges</hi> &#x26;c where they are in danger to go wrong. This is the substance of my Letter to Adamson, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> he will read to you at sight if you wish it.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-26-277" n="26:277"/>For, on the whole, dear Brother, I found I must appoint <hi rend="italic">you</hi> to act for me, if you can possibly spare me so much time,&#x2014;and to judge and suggest about many little matters wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> will incidentally arise, and can only be settled on the spot. I have accordingly bidden Adamson offer the above terms immediately to M&#x2019;Q<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, and then on his refusal or on his assent he is to write immediately to you, appointing another interview;&#x2014;and, on the whole, at once or gradually you must endeavour to settle between you what is wisest to be done, and guide the matter to an issue the best you can, which I will then endeavour to confirm, and so end. It will save me a great deal of <foreign>fash</foreign>; and if you have <hi rend="italic">any</hi> time to spare I will ask you to do it for me.&#x2014; But on the other hand, as perhaps you really are too deep in <hi rend="italic">Dante</hi> to be tumbled up into so new an element, I have told Adamson that &#x201C;James the Farmer&#x201C; c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> do perfectly instead of &#x201C;John the Doctor,&#x201C;&#x2014;and so you must beg him to go and act for me; like a good prudent man as he is, in case you cannot. And so enough!&#x2014;</p>
<p>The dignitaries (Lansdown, Grey, &#x26;c) are all off today; and so we have a much quieter household. In fact nobody is here but Clough, and certain women:&#x2014;Poor Cl<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is not succeeding his &#x201C;University Hall&#x201C; (no fault of <hi rend="italic">his</hi>, but of the thing&#x2019;s which belongs to flimsy ambitious unitarians &#x26;c); so he decides to quit it; and is now a Candidate for some Professorship in Sydney, a new university there, under Gov<hi rend="italic">t</hi>, not far from the Antipodes, poor fellow!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Clough, principal of University Hall, London, since <date when="1849">1849</date>, became unhappy with his position and when, in the autumn of <date when="1851">1851</date>, the governing council questioned his management of students and declining enrollment he decided to resign (with urging by the council) and apply for the classical chair in University Coll., Sydney, Australia. His resignation was accepted as of <date when="1851-12-25">25 Dec.</date> He wrote to a friend, <date when="1852-05-16">16 May</date>: &#x201C;My situation here under a set of mercantile Unitarians is no way charming&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Correspondence of Arthur Hugh Clough</hi>, ed.

<p>Our weather has grown rainy, and is still very warm. I ride when I can get a chance, which is most days when rain is off, and failing that I walk double strides.&#x2014; There has at last come a Letter from Gully, to whom I sent a fine green-morocco set of my Books: he wishes us back for another fly at hydropathy &#x201C;between this and <date when="1852-04">April</date>&#x201C;; which I think will hardly take effect.&#x2014; Poor Lord Lansdowne (who is the politest of official old gent<hi rend="italic">n</hi>) on taking leave of me last night murmured some thing about &#x201C;Bowood for Mrs C<hi rend="italic">le</hi> and me,&#x201C; for which of course I had to <hi rend="italic">thank</hi> down to the ground: but I do sincerely hope he will not send us any summons to his principality,&#x2014;at least and lowest for this year! <foreign><hi rend="italic">Ay de mi!</hi></foreign> My Mother&#x2019;s Newspaper (there being <hi rend="italic">no</hi> post yesternight) only comes today; your <hi rend="italic">Nation</hi> has not yet arrived here. <closer><salute>My love to my Mother; and to you all. <foreign>Adieu</foreign></salute></closer> <name>T.

<salute>Dearest Kate</salute>
<p>It seems a great great while&#x2014;beyond the memory of man&#x2014;since I got your darling letter. And yet I have been here but three weeks, and certainly it wasn&#x2019;t in the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> week, that I heard from you.</p>
<p>The fact is I have taken so much <hi rend="italic">morphine</hi> (not at my own hand, this time, but by D<hi rend="italic">r</hi>&#x2019;s prescription) that I am losing all clear ideas on Time and everything else&#x2014;</p>
<p>Yes&#x2014;about the Captain<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Anthony Sterling; reference to him below as &#x201C;the Colonel&#x201C; is unexplained.</note>&#x2014;I dare say I do know as much as you can tell me. I, for my share, found him much &#x201C;saner&#x201C;&#x2014;perhaps, just because he was <hi rend="italic">not particularly in</hi>disposed to be friends with me. There was little time to go on so we made it up quickly&#x2014;but when M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C took it into his head&#x2014;out of a spirit of contradiction one might almost think&#x2014;to ask &#x201C;the Colonel&#x201C; to dinner; I dont believe either the Colonel or I had a notion whether we should speak to one another! For me, I did as I always do, I committed myself to the impulse of the moment, whatever that might be; and my <hi rend="italic">first</hi> impulses (Mazzini says<supplied>[)]</supplied> are always <hi rend="italic">good</hi>&#x2014;my second &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">less good</hi>&#x2014;indeed&#x2014;what shall I say?&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">bad</hi>&#x2014;upon <hi rend="italic">my</hi> honour.&#x201C;</p>
<p>The only subject we <hi rend="italic">argued</hi> a little about was his &#x201C;nieces&#x201C;&#x2014; Since he had made up with <hi rend="italic">me</hi> why on earth go on quarrelling with <hi rend="italic">you</hi> whose greatest misconduct, so far as I could make out, had been to &#x201C;most undutifully&#x201C; take my part&#x2014;(&#x201C;You see&#x2014;when <hi rend="italic">you</hi> thought proper to quarrel with me; <hi rend="italic">they took your part!!</hi> and it was exceedingly undutiful of them!!&#x201C;&#x2014;&#x2014;) Had I <hi rend="italic">had time</hi> however I shouldn&#x2019;t have despaired of bringing him to <hi rend="italic">see</hi> the right&#x2014;and to do him justice&#x2014; only let him once <hi rend="italic">see it;</hi> and no man goes more instantaneously and determinedly a head in <hi rend="italic">doing</hi> it. He is reconciled to Geraldine too&#x2014; She having <hi rend="italic">utterly forgotten</hi> what their quarrel was all about; he told her <hi rend="italic">every particular</hi> as if it had happened the day before!&#x2014;</p>
<p>This day week we go home. I shant be sorry; for living constantly in the presence of my fellow creatures gets to be dreadfully fatiguing to me, used as I am to solitude&#x2014; My pleasantest hours are when I <hi rend="italic">cut away</hi> by myself into the woods&#x2014; A dreadful treason to utter against the brilliant company here assembled!&#x2014; When one is young one thinks one could never tire of Poets and Artists and all that sort of thing!&#x2014;but I am at a point, I find, when I would often take more satisfaction in what the old Lady used to call &#x201C;a <hi rend="italic">plain human <pb id="pg-26-279" n="26:279"/>cretur</hi>&#x201C;&#x2014; My Dear! <hi rend="small-caps">human</hi> <hi rend="italic">creturs</hi>, are the rarest creturs nowadays&#x2014;and the best; depend upon it&#x2014;</p>

<salute>Dear Redwood,</salute>
<p>Tho&#x2019; we are not at Chelsea this Christmas, we learn that your good gifts are duly there, waiting to welcome our return: thanks for your modest silent friendliness, which fails no year!&#x2014; We shall be home again in time to see what real Welsh mutton is, after all; and shall duly remember the Giver, whose constant kind thought of us, in his still solitudes, is beautiful and valuable to us.</p>
<p>This is the Lord Ashburton&#x2019;s big Mansion, this ancient &#x201C;Grange&#x201C; of the Winchester Monks; now for the last 3 centuries a secular abode of dignitaries. My Wife has been here almost a month, I nearly a fortnight,&#x2014;one of the gaudiest, kindliest, and alas utterly <hi rend="italic">idlest</hi> scenes. We have had celebrities and grandiosities (Macaulays, Lansdownes &#x26;c &#x26;c),&#x2014;to me there has nothing been of really perceptible profit and enjoyment, except the daily ride of two hours wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I execute alone in these entirely silent woods and rustic lanes, not without abstruse reflexions, and emotions often of a far other than laughing character! On the whole we are right glad at the prospect of silence and quiet in our little Chelsea hut again: I, for one, have had quite enough of this for one while.</p>
<p>Last night there had secretly come a &#x201C;brass band,&#x201C; really of rather excell<hi rend="italic">t</hi> quality, from the neighbouring Town or Village of Alresford (4 miles off too): they had stationed themselves, in the dark, under a huge greek portico there is here; and suddenly the black night burst into <hi rend="italic">Auld Lang Syne</hi>,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >An old Scottish song; the best-known version is by Robert Burns.</note> and other soft-breathing articulate, melody which lasted for an hour, and was really touching to the feelings here and there. The night before, immensities of little gifts had been delivered, round a Xmas tree, to all the Labourers&#x2019; children &#x26;c; ending with due tea, due cake and bun. Christmas comes but once a year!&#x2014; <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Redwood: with many thanks with many Good Newyears. God bless you.</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name></p>

<salute>Dearest Helen</salute>
<p>Your letter and the &#x201C;tiny book&#x201C;&#x2014;that might have served as house-ledger to Titania the Fairy Queen,&#x2014;were none the less welcome that they came on the morning <hi rend="italic">after</hi> Christmas day&#x2014; I am very thankful to you for writing so often&#x2014;but I do regret that I should be at such a distance from you all that I cannot <hi rend="italic">drop in</hi> now and then, and get a kiss of my dear Uncle, and see how he is with my own eyes&#x2014; Another regret is that I shall not now be able to get <hi rend="italic">The Romance of the peerage</hi> to him by newyears day as I intended <hi rend="small-caps">to</hi>&#x2014;for we are to stay here till Friday of next week&#x2014; Had Lady A confided to me when she begged me stay, and help her to <hi rend="italic">do</hi> the little Thackerays that both Miss Farrer and Emily Baring were to be here at the same time I should have kept to the original <hi rend="italic">programme</hi> for <hi rend="italic">my</hi> share&#x2014; Miss Farrer having a fund of liveliness and good nature up to taking on her own shoulders the weight of any number of little Misses&#x2014;but I was left to believe Lady A should be <hi rend="italic">alone</hi> with these children and her Mother, if I refused to stay; and in that case there would have been a <hi rend="italic">certain</hi> ungraciousness in refusing her request&#x2014; It <hi rend="italic">puts me out</hi> considerably however not being home before newyearsday to send the little remembrances I am in the habit of sending to dear old Haddington Betty<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Braid.</note> M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Russell and various others&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">here</hi>, there is absolutely nothing to be got&#x2014; Alresford the nearest place has no decent shops in it, and besides I could no more get there than to London, being still a sort of prisoner&#x2014;all my walking being a few turns on sunshiny days (which are few) on the sheltered side of the flower garden&#x2014; I can <hi rend="italic">write</hi> to them however in the meantime and send the ribbands &#x26;c after I go back&#x2014; Then too I will not forget my Uncle&#x2019;s book&#x2014;</p>
<p>Our Christmas Tree came off with great success on Wednesday evening<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1851-12-24">24 Dec.</date></note>&#x2014; It stood in the middle of the servants Hall which was profusely decorated with evergreens, and inscriptions written in red berries &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">God</hi> Save the Queen&#x201C;&#x2014;&#x201C;Long live Lord and Lady Ashburton &#x26;c &#x26;c&#x201C;&#x2014;the tree was a fir tree six feet high&#x2014;stuck quite full of apples and walnuts gilded with dutch leaf<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Imitation gold foil made of copper and zinc.</note>&#x2014;lighted coloured wax tapers&#x2014;and little bundles of comfits&#x2014;the presents, of which the seven dolls were much the finest, lay on a table erected all round the tree and covered with white cloths&#x2014;the forty eight children with their school mistress <pb id="pg-26-281" n="26:281"/>and Mothers and most of the servants, were ranged round while Lady A, attended by his Lordship, the Clergyman<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henry Salmon.</note> and his wife and two daughters M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C and myself, distributed the presents calling up each child by name and saying something graceful and witty along with the doll, top, or whatever it might be&#x2014; M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C had begged to have a map of the world in pieces given to <hi rend="italic">him</hi>, which was done very cleverly&#x2014;&#x201C;Thomas Carlyle&#x2014;The <hi rend="italic">Scholar</hi>,&#x201C; shouted her Ladyship and the <hi rend="italic">Scholar</hi> humbly advanced&#x2014;&#x201C;<hi rend="italic">there</hi> is a map of the world for <hi rend="italic">you</hi>&#x2014;see that you put it all together and make the pieces fit&#x201C;&#x2014; <hi rend="italic">The scholar</hi> made his bow, and looked as enchanted as any little boy or girl among them&#x2014;there was afterwards some <hi rend="small-caps">mumming</hi> executed before us by country lads in paper dresses&#x2014;and then we came away leaving the children and their mothers to enjoy the mugs of tea with large junks of currant loaf sp<supplied>[r]</supplied>ead<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> for them on a long table&#x2014; The whole thing had a very <hi rend="italic">fine effect</hi>&#x2014;and might have given occasion for a laudatory newspaper paragraph but one reflection that I could not help making rather spoiled it for <hi rend="italic">me</hi>&#x2014;viz: that the whole of <hi rend="italic">forty eight</hi> presents had cost just 2 pounds twelve and sixpence! having been bought in the Lowther Arcade<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lowther Arcade, a covered walk with glass domes, from the Strand to St. Martin&#x2019;s churchyard, chiefly occupied by German merchants selling cheap goods.</note> the most rubbishy place in London&#x2014;with a <hi rend="italic">regard of expense</hi> that would have been meritorious in the like of us but which seemed to me&#x2014;what shall I say?&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">incomprehensible</hi>&#x2014;in a person with an income of 40,000 thousands a year&#x2014;and who gives balls at the cost of 700&#xa3; each, or will spend 100&#xa3; on a china jar!&#x2014; I should have liked each child to have got at least <hi rend="italic">a frock</hi> given it&#x2014;when one was going to look munificent&#x2014; But everyone has his own notions on spending money&#x2014; For the rest it has been what Miss Farrer would call &#x201C;a dreadful <hi rend="italic">slow</hi> Christmas&#x201C; except for the Servants who had a ball last night which lasted till six in the morning&#x2014; We up stairs were in the reactionary state of our company spirits of last week But Thackeray and Miss Farrer come today&#x2014;and the steam must be got up again&#x2014;</p>

<salute>My dear Lady Airlie</salute>
<p>I recognised your handwriting on the last letter with a feeling not at all unlike girlish joy&#x2014;strange to say at this date!&#x2014;but as I read; I became grave enough, and in the end unaccountably sad! Nor did the sadness pass away when I had carried your letter up stairs and locked it into my writing case. The whole day after, in spite of the brilliances talked around me, I was haunted with a vague dreary uneasiness, having <hi rend="italic">your</hi> image at the heart of it,&#x2014;such as I have felt after <hi rend="italic">dreaming</hi>&#x2014;very vividly&#x2014;that a person I loved had, before my eyes, without my having the power to help it, fallen over a precipice&#x2014;or some such dreadful thing! It was nothing that you <hi rend="italic">said</hi> in your letter which made this impression on me, but what you did <hi rend="italic">not</hi> say, which I seemed to read by <hi rend="italic">second sight</hi> behind the outward visible words. and which told of your having begun&#x2014;already!&#x2014;to lose <hi rend="italic">confidence</hi> in yourself and your young life, and to be giving yourself up to what the germans call <foreign><hi rend="italic">gr&#xfc;beln</hi></foreign> [brooding], the fatalest of <hi rend="italic">innocent</hi> occupations that the human mind can employ itself in! Oh don&#x2019;t I know what comes of that same <foreign><hi rend="italic">gr&#xfc;beln!</hi></foreign> how one gets swamped within an inch of ones life in one insoluble problem after another&#x2014;knocks oneself black and blue against laws of nature! God preserve <hi rend="italic">you</hi> from such a habit! the flowers in your lifegarden will all wither one after another, if instead of watering and weeding them you continually <hi rend="italic">scrape the earth from them to examine the roots</hi>, and no good seed that you sow will bear fruit if you poke it up time after time <hi rend="italic">to see how it is getting on!</hi> But I am stupid to be answering your letter <hi rend="italic">to the same mood it was written in</hi>&#x2014; How often has Geraldine Jewsbury, the only person I ever write Jeremiads to, driven me wild with a long letter of consolations, or good advice only applicable to a momentary humour, forgotten by myself while <hi rend="italic">she</hi> had been remembering it too well and bringing all her forces of sympathy and sense to bear on it&#x2014; Let me not fall into the same blunder which I know to be very provoking to the person sympathized with or advised&#x2014;at the wrong time!&#x2014; Only; <hi rend="italic">will</hi> you make me two promises? will you promise me that when you are out of spirits and disposed to sit down and meditate on such questions as &#x201C;how to preserve any particular person&#x2019;s love,&#x201C; you will that instant fall to <hi rend="italic">doing some active thing</hi>&#x2014;take a walk, pay a visit, enter into talk with the first person you meet, write to <hi rend="italic">me&#x2014;do anything</hi>, but only dont <hi rend="italic">sit thinking!</hi>&#x2014; Love, <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, as <pb id="pg-26-283" n="26:283"/>well as you can&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">deserve</hi> as well as you can the others love, and leave the rest to Providence&#x2014; The other thing I request of you; you may think strange&#x2014;impertinent perhaps to say,&#x2014;but in that case the sincere affection I feel towards you and the sincere interest I take in your happiness must plead my excuse&#x2014;if ever you have any little disagreement with your Husband, feel any moment of displeasure against him&#x2014;and what married existence is, ever was, or ever will be without such clouds&#x2014;do not dearest Lady Airlie take any of <hi rend="italic">your family</hi> into your confidence&#x2014;that is unforgivable to ones Husband that a Mother in law or Sister in law should be made aware of such moments of discord&#x2014;for every man will forgive a wound to his affection sooner than one to his pride&#x2014; Besides the very love of ones own family makes them unsafe to be trusted&#x2014; Pardon me for saying this&#x2014;the caution may be superfluous&#x2014;but I have known such misery resulting from family <hi rend="italic">confidences</hi> that I could not avoid suggesting you a rule which I have invariably acted upon myself&#x2014;</p>
<p>We have had a large party here last week&#x2014;Lord Lansdowne, the Greys, with their Lady Alice Lambton (not interesting to <hi rend="italic">my</hi> taste) M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Twisleton, M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Clough Tomorrow Miss Farrer comes and Thackeray with his two little girls&#x2014;at present there are no visitors but Lady Sandwich and ourselves&#x2014; According to the original programme we were to have gone home tomorrow but it is now settled that we stay till this day week&#x2014; Have no fear about my repeating anything you are ever kind enough to say to me of a private nature&#x2014; Neither to Lady A nor anyone else should I dream of &#x201C;showing your letters&#x201C;&#x2014; I wish I might have an hours walk with you at Eglington Castle<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Eglinton Castle, seat of the earl of Eglinton, N Ayrshire, where the Airlies were spending Christmas.</note>&#x2014; I was there once merely to look at it, with my beautiful, good Mother whom I have no longer, and for the sake of that reminiscence I like addressing a letter to you there&#x2014;</p>
<p>You will hardly be able to read this scrawl&#x2014;Lady A has been talking to me all the time I have been writing the last sheet&#x2014;with <hi rend="italic">Sambo</hi> howling at intervals&#x2014;and I positively <hi rend="italic">would</hi> write by this post so have gone on &#x201C;under difficulties&#x201C;!</p>

<salute>My dear Mrs. Russell</salute>
<p>I must appeal to your well known kindness to help me out of a little puzzle&#x2014; I left home on a visit to Lord Ashburtons some four or five weeks ago, intending to go back on the day after Christmas&#x2014;but some people were to be here this week, strangers to Lady A, and known to <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, and I was requested to remain another week to make these young peoples visit more agreeable to them. Thus newyears day finds me unprepared&#x2014;with any little presents for those whom I wish to remind of me at this season&#x2014; There is a town (Winchester) eight miles off&#x2014;but I cannot drive there to procure anythings&#x2014;having caught a bad cold in the first week of my visit which confined me to the house the first three weeks, as a measure of necessity&#x2014;and I have gone on limiting my exercise since to a walk in the Conservatory and corridors&#x2014;as a measure of precaution&#x2014;cold is so easily <hi rend="italic">re</hi>taken&#x2014;and it is so miserable to be <hi rend="italic">ill</hi> in other peoples houses&#x2014; What I must ask of you, then, is, to be so good as to advance the usual sovereign for me which I will repay with a post office order immediately on my return&#x2014;, and then you must buy for Margaret and Mary<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Margaret Hiddlestone and Mary Mills, JWC&#x2019;s mother&#x2019;s servants.</note> a pair of warm stockings each&#x2014;or some such thing&#x2014;half a crown each you may lay out for them&#x2014;and dont say but that I <hi rend="italic">sent</hi> the stockings, or whatever it may be, from London&#x2014; I am sure you will do this for me, without grudging time and trouble&#x2014; I hear very often from Liverpool since that serious illness of my Uncle&#x2019;s&#x2014; At present he is pretty well&#x2014;but his life seems to hang by a mere thread now&#x2014;every little agitation&#x2014;such as &#x201C;listening for the guns of the American Steamer, bringing a letter from Johnnie&#x201C;&#x2014;produces threatening of the same sort of attack&#x2014;and another attack will probably be fatal&#x2014; I wish very much to go and see him once more&#x2014;and must try to manage it early in the spring&#x2014; Perhaps I may be in Scotland again next year&#x2014;and surely you will come and see me somewhere if I should not be able to find courage to go to Thornhill&#x2014; A young friend of mine married the Earl of Airlie last Autumn and asks me me<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> to visit her at Cortachy Castle<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A seat of the earl of Airlie in NW Angus.</note>&#x2014;and there is an old Gentleman, called <hi rend="italic">The Bear</hi> in London society, who has a beautiful place twenty miles beyond Fort Augustus who has also invited us<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <ref target="volume-26/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/olddnb/8650"><hi rend="italic">DNB</hi></ref> says that Edward Ellice &#x201C;entertained at Glenquoich in Inverness with a profuse but delightful hospitality, sometimes having more than a thousand guests in a year.&#x201C;</note>&#x2014; And <hi rend="italic">there</hi> I should <pb id="pg-26-285" n="26:285"/>really like to go&#x2014;to see again the places where I went with my Mother about thirty years ago&#x2014;</p>
<p>We have had a deal of company here since I came&#x2014; Macauley amongst the rest, whom I had never before seen at any length&#x2014; I used to think my Husband the most copious talker, when he liked, that was anywhere to be fallen in with&#x2014;but Macauley beats him hollow!&#x2014;in <hi rend="italic">quantity</hi>&#x2014;</p>
<p>You need not take the trouble of writing till after I have returned and sent the money&#x2014;but <hi rend="italic">then</hi> you must write me all about yourself and about dear old Thornhill&#x2014; <closer><salute>Kindest regards to your Father and Husband</salute></closer></p>

    <salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
    <p>Here we still are, and have to continue till Friday: &#x0201C;the Thackerays were coming,&#x0201D; the &#38;c&#x02014;in short, my Lady and Jane had settled that we could not go till the day after Newyearsday; and so in waiting for that date, still four days ahead of us remain for perfect idleness, indigestion, and smoking of tobacco under difficulties! The people are all very good to us, and intrinsically most of them are really agreeable and superior people: nevertheless one feels utterly out of place in such a scene of strenuous donothingism waited on by all the elegancies; and I shall be truly thankful, I for one, to get back to my own cell, and some kind of attempt at rational employment again.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">Edward FitzGerald wrote to a friend in <date when="1851-12">Dec.</date> and said that he had recently called on TC, who thought his visit to Malvern had done him &#x0201C;little good.

Our party for some time was very thin; it still consists only of Miss Farrer, Thackeray with his two little girls, Lady Sandwich (a good old cheery-hearted tho&#x02019; very weakly dame): and so, or nearly so, we expect it to continue till Friday, when it finally dissolves.

      <p>Jane and I were very glad of your Note, and I ought to <hi rend="italic">say</hi> so.&#x02014; Did you ever hear of little (Mephistopheles) Marshall at Weimar?<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss">James Marshall. A long letter, signed &#x0201C;J.

Almost certainly by Marshall and perhaps contributed at TC&#x02019;s instigation, it possibly even contained some writing by TC, especially the trans. of a six-stanza poem by Strauss. Parenthetically the trans. wrote: &#x0201C;Dr. Strauss, as a poet, being almost a <foreign>

</foreign> [freak of nature], according to English ideas of him, we have thought it right to translate this poem. Here, accordingly, is the best English version possible to us in the little time allowed by an inexorable printer.&#x0201D; Hunt wrote to TC, <date when="1851-06-30">30 June</date>: &#x0201C;A gentleman wishes to know who wrote the communication respecting Strauss in the late luckless Journal.&#x02014; May I tell him? I did not know but it might be wished to be kept secret. / I would fain have seen the whole article inserted just as it was sent; but M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> [John Stores] Smith was afraid of his Manchester or his &#x02018;commercial districts&#x02019;&#x02014;a point upon which he was always harping.&#x0201D;</note> Here is a Letter from him wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> the stamp will carry.</p>
