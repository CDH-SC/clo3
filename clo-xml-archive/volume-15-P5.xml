<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Many thanks for your <hi rend="italic">Sanitary Report</hi>,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Issued <date when="1842-07-00">July</date>; see <ref target="volume-14/lt-18420323-TC-ECH-01">TC to <sic>EC</sic><corr>ECH</corr>, <date when="1842-03-23">23 March</date></ref>.</note> which arrived duly, which I mean to read over with attention. Glancing hastily thro&#x2019; it, I am struck by several things,&#x2014;most of all by the frightful difference of the duration of workman life in Manchester and in Rutland!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The report showed that the life span of workers in industrial Manchester was significantly shorter than those of workers in rural England (156&#x2013;58).</note> Are you perfectly sure of your details and documents there? It is one of the most hideous facts I ever fell in with in the history of <hi rend="italic">Mammon-Worship</hi> and <foreign><hi rend="italic">Laissez-Faire</hi></foreign>. The Gov<hi rend="italic">t</hi> will actually have to attend to all that shortly, or prepare itself for being kicked to the Devil. We <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> go on in that way, and will not!</p>
<p>I wish I could direct you aright to what parties this Book ought to be sent;&#x2014;for that seems the way of dispersing it; some thousand or so of persons in England will read it and lay it to heart, if it be put in their way, and few will go to seek it of Booksellers. Could you but know the names and addresses of these same 1000! I, except to the common run of Editors, Magazine, Review and Newspaper, whom your Bookseller already knows, can give you almost no direction. For one, I think you might send a copy addressed, &#x201C;T. Ballantyne Esq, Guardian Office, Manchester&#x201D;; for another, &#x201C;A. Prentice Esq, Times Office, Manchester&#x201D;; a third, &#x201C;F. Lucas Esq,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Frederick Lucas (<date when="1812-00-00">1812</date>&#x2013;<date when="1855-00-00">55</date>; <ref target="volume-15/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/17127"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), Roman Catholic journalist and politician; see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400516-TC-JF-01"><sic>12:145</sic><corr>TC to JF, <date when="1840-05-16">16 May 1840</date></corr></ref>. The <hi rend="italic">Tablet</hi> had just amalgamated with the <hi rend="italic">True Tablet</hi> (begun <date when="1842-02-00">Feb.</date>); they pbd. as the <hi rend="italic">True Tablet</hi> till <date when="1842-12-00">Dec.</date>, and from <date when="1843-01-00">Jan. 1843</date> became the <hi rend="italic">Tablet</hi> again.</note> True Tablet Office&#x201D; <pb id="pg-15-4" n="15:4"/>(Catherine Street, I think; but at all events, it is discoverable, and close by you): this Lucas will perhaps send me another name or two of fit men, which I shall then forward to you. Among private persons, &#x201C;James G. Marshall Esq, Leeds&#x201D; is of all manufacturers I have seen the most enlightened and humane, and anxious on those subjects.</p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>By Jean&#x2019;s hand on the back of the <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi>, I incline to infer that you are perhaps come back from your bathing, and are at Dumfries; at all events, I know James<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Aitken.</note> will forward this to you, and therefore I write before the week pass. There came, this morning, a Note from <pb id="pg-15-5" n="15:5"/>Jamie at Scotsbrig in answer to one of mine:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1842-07-29">29 July</date>.</note> this also I will enclose, tho&#x2019; the contents of it will probably not be all new to you. The day before yesterday I got a poor old <hi rend="italic">dud</hi> of an <hi rend="italic">American</hi> Newspaper; I think it must be from Jenny.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sent to Jenny by Robert Hanning.</note></p>
<p>Jamie says the weather with you has been <hi rend="italic">warm</hi>, of late weeks: perhaps therefore you actually had it good and favourable at the Seashore; tho&#x2019; I was often pitying you, for here we had it <hi rend="italic">cold</hi> with strong wind from the North; and not till four days ago did it become handsomely hot,&#x2014;which it now is in good truth; hotter than we have ever had it this year. Jamie speaks of a decidedly favourable prospect of crop, which is excellent news to me. It will not be a plentiful harvest generally, I doubt; but a fair one, and perhaps well got.</p>
<p>I continue <hi rend="italic">boring</hi> along here, &#x201C;under ground,&#x201D; as I call it; I shall get <hi rend="italic">above</hi> ground one day! My health keeps better than usual for a London summer; indeed I find it far the suitablest way I have this year followed, to shrink into my shell, and keep away from the <foreign><hi rend="italic">fry</hi></foreign> [disturbance] as nearly as possible altogether. Yesterday I had to go into the City; and returned quite sick with the dusty grinding crowd of mortals, and the thick close heat and whirl.&#x2014; I am for being off tomorrow, with a Son of Lord Monteagle&#x2019;s, a very good young man who has invited me kindly, on a kind of <hi rend="italic">free excursion</hi> which is to last till Tuesday.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-15/lt-18420805-TC-SSR-01"><sic>preceding letter</sic><corr>TC to SSR, <date when="1842-08-05">5 Aug. 1842</date></corr></ref>.</note> I think perhaps I shall take a little more of country, in a small way, before the Sun altogether leave us.</p>
<p>Jane is, at length, actually getting ready for her visit to Mrs Buller.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC was to go with Charles and Isabella Buller, to visit their youngest son, Reginald, at Troston, Suffolk, where he was rector; TC found him &#x201C;a lazy hebetated fellow,&#x201D; and as a boy &#x201C;a curious gesticulating, pen-drawing etc. little creature&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Reminiscences 236</hi>). JWC stayed <date when="1842-08-11">11 Aug.</date> to <date when="1842-09-15">15 Sept.</date></note> She is to set off on Wednesday morning: it is a ride of some eight hours; and they meet her at the end of it with their little carriage. Mrs Buller and she get on admirably together; and the place is very quiet, and the way of life composed: I feel sure it will do her some good. She will stay perhaps a fortnight or more. <hi rend="italic">Little</hi> Jeannie (the Liverpool Cousin) is to continue here till <hi rend="italic">she</hi> come back, and then goes, I believe, very shortly homewards. She seems loth to quit us, and we have liked her altogether well, poor little <foreign>bairn</foreign>.&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; I met Jack driving his carriage two in hand, prosperously, one evening on the streets! Ogilby was sitting by him, and Miss Scott behind,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Ogilby and his aunt Mary Scott.</note> and in the rear of all a Flunky: they all seemed very sleepy except Jack</p> <pb id="pg-15-6" n="15:6"/><p>Dear Mother, I must out now, and walk a little bit: you will not quarrel with this little scrap, little tho&#x2019; it be. Take care of yourself till you get home again! I hope you do not forget the <hi rend="small-caps">Portrait</hi>,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of herself painted by Maxwell.</note> James and you!&#x2014; <foreign>Adieu</foreign> dear Mother.</p>

<p><salute><hi rend="small-caps">My dear Mrs. Welsh</hi>,&#x2014;</salute>I write today merely to say that I will write again so soon as I have anything to tell you of what you naturally wish to know. But it will take some time even to get answers to the questions you ask&#x2014;so you must not grow impatient and fancy that we are neglecting the business.</p>
<p>My husband has already made two long journeys about it with almost no result. The first day he found Mr. Buller absent, the second time he was at home but entirely ignorant as to the <hi rend="italic">when</hi> and <hi rend="italic">how</hi> of this particular branch of New Zealand business.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Vain efforts were being made to get a position as surveyor in New Zealand for Mrs. Welsh&#x2019;s son John, who had been trained as a civil engineer. New Zealand had become a Crown Colony independent of New South Wales in <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>. Charles Buller, as a supporter of Wakefield&#x2019;s emigration plans (see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350112-TC-JAC-01"><sic>8:10</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1835-01-12">12 Jan. 1835</date></corr></ref>), might have been supposed to know about Wakefield&#x2019;s New Zealand Co., founded in its present form in <date when="1838-00-00">1838</date> for the purchase and resale of lands in New Zealand and for promoting emigration there. There were 4,103 immigrants in <date when="1842-00-00">1842</date>.</note> He was quite ready however to bestir himself in getting the necessary information, and also to use his interest in behalf of any friend of Carlyle&#x2019;s. He promised to go forthwith to the Secretary a Mr. Ward<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Ward (<date when="1805-00-00">1805</date>&#x2013;<date when="1890-00-00">90</date>; <ref target="volume-15/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/28694"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), diplomat; sec. to the New Zealand Co. from <date when="1839-00-00">1839</date>, except for <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date> when he had been British Commissioner for the revision of Stade tolls in Hamburg.</note> and ask him all about it&#x2014;and write to my husband the result of his enquiries&#x2014;but all sorts of business I observe get on here very slowly and unsatisfactorily by writing; so my husband will have to go to him again I imagine&#x2014;and perhaps to the secretary also&#x2014;and perhaps several times, before any good is done. Be assured, however, that you will not have to wait a day thro&#x2019; any remissness on our part&#x2014;and that is all the satisfaction I can give you at present.</p>

<p>Perhaps this first is not the last Note you will ever write to my poor address? In that case, if you can so much as remember &#x201C;Chelsea,&#x201D; the Penny Postman will at once do his duty.</p>

<p>This Rectory is a delightful place to be in, in warm weather&#x2014;but in winter it must be the reverse of comfortable&#x2014;all the room windows opening as doors into the garden&#x2014;vines hanging over them &#x26;c &#x26;c&#x2014; It is a sort of compromise between a country <hi rend="italic">parsonage</hi> and an aristocratic <hi rend="italic">cottage</hi>&#x2014;and compromises never are found to answer, I think, in the long run&#x2014; it stands in the midst of green filds and fine tall trees&#x2014;with the church, (if such an old dilapitated building can be called a church) within a bow-shot of it&#x2014;around the church is a little quiet looking church yard which, with the sun shining on it, does not look at all sad&#x2014;a foot path about half a yard wide and over-grown with green, and strewn with fallen apples, cuts across the bit of green field between the Church and the Rectory&#x2014;and being the <hi rend="italic">only road to the church</hi> one may infer from it several things! I went into the church last night with Reginald<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Buller.</note> while M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Buller was having her drive&#x2014;and <pb id="pg-15-10" n="15:10"/>when I looked at <hi rend="italic">him</hi>&#x2014;and <hi rend="italic">it</hi> and thought of the four hundred and fifty living souls who were to be saved thro <hi rend="italic">such</hi> means&#x2014; I could almost have burst into tears&#x2014;any thing so like the burial-place of revealed religion you have never seen&#x2014;nor a <hi rend="italic">Rector</hi> more fit to read its Burial service!&#x2014; The church bell rings night and morning, with a plaintive clang&#x2014;I asked &#x201C;was it for prayers?&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;no it was to warn the gleaners that it was their time to go out and to come in&#x201D; &#x201C;<foreign>Monsieur cela vous fera</foreign> [Sir that will give you] &#x26;c&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC adds, on copy, &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">grand plaisir</hi></foreign> [great pleasure] perhaps.&#x201D;</note></p>

Here, one might have thought that all things, except perhaps &#x201C;the small birds rejoicing&#x201D; would let one alone&#x2014;and the fact is, that with one devilry after another I have had hardly any sleep, for all so dead-weary as I lay down&#x2014; Just as I was dropping asleep between eleven and twelve the most infernal serenade commenced in comparison of which the shrieking of Mazzeppa<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;A wild horse, which we sometimes hear stamping &#x26;c here&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note on MS); cf.

For he was of weak health, lamed of a leg in childhood; had an airy winged turn of thought, flowing out in lambencies of beautiful spontaneous wit and fancy, which were much admired in society, and too much attracted him thither; so that, with all his integrity, cleverness, and constant veracity of intellect and character, he did not, nor ever could, as a &#x2018;reformer,&#x2019; so much express his inborn detestation of the base and false by practically working to undo it, as by showering witty scorn upon it; in which, indeed, I never saw his rival, had that been the way to do good upon it. Poor Charles, only five years afterwards he died, amid universal regret, which did not last long, nor amount to anything! He had procured for his younger brother Arthur, who was my other pupil, some law appointment in Ceylon, which proved sufficient; and for his youngest brother Reginald (who used to dine with me in Edinburgh in the tutor times, an airy, pen-drawing, skipping clever enough little creature then) a richish country living; where, as utterly stupid somnolent &#x2018;Reverend Incumbent,&#x2019; he placidly vegetated thenceforth, and still vegetates. Thackeray the novelist had been a college companion of his own; that perhaps now is his chief distinction.<lb/><lb/>
&#x201C;Mr. and Mrs. Charles Buller, senior, who now led a somewhat nomadic life, in the manner of ex-Indians of distinction, were superior people both; persons of sound judgement, of considerable culture and experience, of thoroughly polite manners (Madam considerably in the Indian style, as ex-&#x2018;queen of Calcutta,&#x2019; which she was, with a great deal of sheet-lightning in her ways). Charles, senior, was considerably deaf, a real sorrow to one so fond of listening to people of sense; for the rest, like his wife, a person of perfect probity, politeness, truthfulness, and of a more solid type than she; he read (idly, when he must), rode for exercise, was, above all, fond of chess, in which game he rarely found his superior.
Intrinsically these excellent people had from the first, and all along, been very good to me; never boggled at my rustic outside or melancholic dyspeptic ways, but took, with ardent welcome, whatever of best they could discern within&#x2014;over-estimating all, not under-estimating&#x2014;especially not &#x2018;the benefit,&#x2019; &#x26;c. Charles, junior, was getting of me. Indeed, talent of all real kinds was dear to them (to the lady especially); and at bottom the measure of human worth to both. Nobody in London, accordingly, read sooner what my rural Jeannie intrinsically was; discerned better what graces and social resources might lie under that modest veiling; or took more eagerly to profiting by these capabilities whenever possible. Mrs. Buller was, by her maiden name, Kirkpatrick, a scion of the Closeburn (Dumfriesshire) people, which, in its sort, formed another little tie.&#x2014;<name>T.C.</name>&#x201D;</note></p>

<p>Here has my poor Dame&#x2019;s clever little Letter come to me; alas, perhaps <hi rend="italic">too</hi> clever, I fear! Thanks to thee for it any way; it is a little <hi rend="italic">picture</hi>&#x2014;a thing worth reading!</p>
<p>Surely the rev<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Reginald Buller, tho&#x2019; in the grave of revealed religion will have interest enough to silence two jackasses under his windows. Pray do pluck up a heart, and speak to him about them, if he have not already done it. Confound them, say I. My poor Goody will get quite wrecked by their braying: I of all mortals know best how to pity it. I shall be in real anxiety for Monday morning, to hear what has become of that. The thing would all do, otherwise, so well; I will try to hope that you <hi rend="italic">get</hi> into sleep, but still with many misgivings. Cannot you close your windows, and try to open some door? Even suffocation is better than jack-asses.&#x2014;</p>
<p>We go on here, in perfect composure; we had a long dose of <hi rend="italic">Creek</hi> last night; Elizabeth<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >G. L. Craik and Elizabeth Pepoli.</note> was here this morning, apparently only for a minute. I have been very busy all morning, and have now no time left.</p>
<p>Yesterday I did not see Charles Buller; on arriving at Charing Cross I found the Parliament just <hi rend="italic">then</hi> in its agonies, and that there was no chance of him at the Temple. I stept down rather, to look at the Queen for an instant.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Inner and Middle Temple are inns of court, between Fleet St. and the Thames; Charles Buller had an office, 5 Hare Court, Temple. The Queen was on her way to the House of Lords to prorogue parliament; and, the same day, Buller was to speak in the Commons about the plight of those holding fraudulently issued exchequer bills.</note> She did pass, she and Albert, looking very much frightened, red in the face; but none shot at the poor little thing, some even gave a kind of encouraging cheer. &#x201C;No, me? <hi rend="italic">I vont holler!&#x201D;</hi> said some of the populace near me; neither did I <hi rend="italic">holler</hi> at all.&#x2014; From that I got to Mrs H.

We walked a little before tea. Creek was very wearisome, forbade all reading. Today at six a villainous cock woke me,&#x2014;and Helen spilt the coffee; but left enough for us two, and supplied <hi rend="italic">herself</hi> with tea!&#x2014; My dearest, what a wretched scrawl is this. But I can do no more. I will be ten times <hi rend="italic">better</hi> to thee than <pb id="pg-15-13" n="15:13"/>before! Ever as I grow older I mean to grow better every way.

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Tho&#x2019; I do not exactly know where you are at present, I will suppose you to be in Dumfries, and send you the shortest of notices about myself. I have literally no time today for more than a word; but I know you will welcome even that.</p>
<p>When I wrote last, I said I was going off on &#x201C;an excursion&#x201D; with a son of Monteagle&#x2019;s till tuesday. The excursion was&#x2014;whither think you? Over the sea into the Netherlands and back again! It is literally so; we have been in the actual Low Countries, as far inland as the City of Ghent, <supplied>[an]</supplied>d came safe home again on Wednesday; we should have made it <hi rend="italic">tuesday</hi> as projected, had not the wind altogether failed us. Was not that a swift excursion? Monteagle&#x2019;s son being an official person commands the services of certain little Queen&#x2019;s ships, called <hi rend="italic">revenue Cutters</hi>, and makes short cruises in them from time to time; on this occasion he got me to go with him. What I saw there, and what kind of thing it was, you shall perhaps hear better by and by. We had delightful weather, saw many strange things, and I think got good of the business.</p>
<p>Jane went off to Mrs Buller&#x2019;s the day after my return. I have just got this Letter from her; I believe it will amuse you to read it, and tell all the news better than I can. Pray send it back again carefully,&#x2014;along with some word of your own! I do not so much as know where you are. I long to hear that the sea-bathing has ended well. Bid Jean write, if you cannot write. Half a word is better than nothing,&#x2014;is all I want. Jack is well. If you were certainly well it would do! <supplied><foreign>A[dieu</foreign> dea]</supplied>r Mother,</p>

<dateline>Sunday morning [<date when="1842-08-14">14 August 1842</date>]<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Troston, <date when="1842-08-14">14 Aug<hi rend="italic">t</hi> 1842</date>&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note).</note></dateline>
<salute>My dearest</salute>
<p>There were <hi rend="italic">two</hi> notes from you this morning&#x2014;one on each side of my plate&#x2014;the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> having the address of Bury only came along with the <hi rend="italic">third</hi>&#x2014; So be sure you keep by Ixworth in future&#x2014; As for &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Keeting</hi>&#x201D; it turned out on investigation to be neither more nor less than M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Bullers way of writing <hi rend="italic">Rectory</hi>.</p>
<p>It is much better with me now, and I find myself quite <foreign><hi rend="italic">hefted</hi></foreign> [accustomed] in my new position&#x2014; But I shall not soon forget the horrors of the first day&#x2014;feeling myself growing every moment worse&#x2014;away from you all&#x2014;and <hi rend="italic">desperated</hi> by the notion of confessing myself ill, and going to bed, and causing a fuss among strangers! After having written to you I tried sauntering among the trees&#x2014;tried lying on the sofa in my own room&#x2014;tried eating dinner (which is rationally served up here at three oclock) and finally tried a drive in the carriage with M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Buller, all the while saying nothing. But instead of admiring the beauties of Livermere Park, which they took me to see, I was wondering whether I should be able to &#x201C;stave off&#x201D; fainting till I got back. On &#x201C;descending from the carriage&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;&#x2018;<foreign>Scende de carrosa</foreign>, &#x26;c&#x2019;&#x2014;said the Signora degli Antoni, describing the erratic Town life of brill<hi rend="italic">t</hi> acquaintance here&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note). For Clementina degli Antoni, see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350615-TC-JAC-01"><sic>8:154</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1835-06-15">15 June 1835</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380412-TC-JAC-01"><sic>10:67</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1838-04-12">12 April 1838</date></corr></ref>.</note> I had finally to tell M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Buller I was ill and would go to bed&#x2014; She came up stairs after me, and offered me <foreign><hi rend="italic">sal volatile</hi></foreign> &#x26;c &#x26;c&#x2014;but seeing that I would have <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi>, and wanted only to be let alone; she with her usual good breeding <hi rend="italic">pinned the bell rope to my pillow</hi> and went away. A while after; feeling myself turning all cold and strange, I considered would I ring the bell.
I did not&#x2014;and what came of me I cannot tell&#x2014;whether I fainted, or suddenly fell dead-asleep&#x2014;but when I opened my eyes, as it seemed a minute or two after, it was quite dark and a maid was lighting a night lamp at the table!&#x2014; I asked what o&#x2019;clock it was?&#x2014;&#x201C;half-past eleven!&#x201D;&#x2014; &#x201C;Would I have tea?&#x201D; No&#x2014;&#x201C;did I want anything?<supplied>[&#x201D;]</supplied>&#x2014; No&#x2014; She was no sooner gone than I fell <hi rend="italic">naturally</hi> asleep, and when the cocks awoke me after daylight I was quite free of pain, only desperately wearied  The <hi rend="italic">asses</hi> did not return the second night nor last night&#x2014;and I manage better or worse to weave the <hi rend="italic">dogs, cocks</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">rooks</hi> into my dreams&#x2014;my condition has undergone a further amelioration from having the matrass laid <hi rend="italic">above</hi> the down-bed&#x2014;it was like to choke me&#x2014;besides that I lately <pb id="pg-15-15" n="15:15"/>read somewhere horrible things about the &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">miasma</hi>&#x201D; contracted by down beds&#x2014;from all their various occupants thro&#x2019; successive generations!&#x2014;and my imagination was got disagreeably excited in consequence&#x2014; For the rest; nothing can be better suited to my wants than the life one has here&#x2014;so that I feel already quite at home&#x2014;and almost wishing that <hi rend="italic">you</hi> were Rector of Troston! What a blessed exchange would it be for those poor people whom I hear at this moment singing <foreign>feckless</foreign> psalms! I could almost find in my heart to run over to the old tower and give them a word of admonition myself&#x2014; Reginald does not <hi rend="italic">preach</hi> in the morning&#x2014;he <hi rend="italic">reads service</hi> merely, and preaches in the afternoon&#x2014; I shall go then to hear &#x201C;how the cretur gets thro with it&#x201D;&#x2014; I have not made out yet whether there is a downright <hi rend="italic">want</hi> in him, or whether his faculties are sunk in the shamefulest indolence&#x2014; He is grown very much into the figure of M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Ogilvie in miniature&#x2014; When he speaks I dare not look at his Mother, and feel it a mercy for his father that he is so deaf&#x2014; The Old people do not mean to remain here&#x2014; The <hi rend="italic">climate</hi> does not suit M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Buller in winter&#x2014;but they have not made up their minds whether to remove altogether or to hire some place during the cold weather&#x2014; Oh dear me! &#x201C;They have trouble that have the worl, and trouble that want it&#x201D;!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;In pious Scotland &#x2018;the worl,&#x2019; or &#x2018;worl&#x2019;s gear,&#x2019; signifies riches. Margaret (Smith) Aitken, an Annandale farmer&#x2019;s wife, of small possessions, though of large and faithful soul, had (perhaps a hundred years ago), by strenuous industry and thrift, saved for herself twenty complete shillings&#x2014;an actual &#xa3;1 note, wholly her own, to do what she liked with!&#x2014;and was much concerned to lay it up in some place of absolute safety against a rainy day. She tried anxiously all her &#x2018;<foreign>hussives</foreign>,&#x2019; boxes, drawers, a cunning hole in the wall, various places, but found none satisfactory, and was heard ejaculating, to the amusement of her young daughters, who never forgot it, &#x2018;They have trouble that hae the worl&#x2019;, and trouble that haena&#x2019;t!&#x2019; There is a Spanish proverb to the same purpose: &#x2018;<foreign>Cuidados acarrea el oro, y cuidados la falta de &#xE9;l</foreign>.&#x2019;<lb/><lb/>
&#x201C;This Margaret Smith, a native of Annan, and, by all accounts, a kinswoman to be proud of (or, silently, to be thankful to heaven for), was my mother&#x2019;s mother. It was my mother (Margaret Aitken Carlyle) who told us this story about her, with a tone of gentle humour, pathos, and heart&#x2019;s love, which we were used to on such a subject I doubt whether I ever saw this good grandmother. A vivid momentary image of some stranger, or, rather, of a formidable glowing chintz gown belonging to some stranger, who might have been she, still rises perfectly certain to me, from my second or third year; but more probably it was her sister, my grand-aunt Barbara, of Annan, with whom I afterwards boarded when at school there (<date when="1806-00-00">1806</date>&#x2013;<date when="1808-00-00">1808</date>), and whom I almost daily heard muttering and weeping about her &#x2018;dear Margaret,&#x2019; and their parting &#x2018;at the dyke-end&#x2019; (near Cargenbridge, Dumfries neighbourhood, I suppose, perhaps six years before), &#x2018;sae little thinking it was for the last time!&#x2019; It is inconceivable (till you have seen the documents) what the pecuniary poverty of Scotland was a hundred years ago; and, again (of which also I, for one, still more indubitably &#x2018;have the documents&#x2019;), its spiritual opulence&#x2014;opulence fast ending in these years, think some? Californian nugget <foreign><hi rend="italic">versus</hi></foreign> jewels of Heaven itself, that is a ruining barter! I know rather clearly, and have much considered, the history of my kindred for the third and second generations back, and lament always that it is not in my power to speak of it at all to the flunkey populations now coming and come&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note in Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi>).</note> I do not know whether it be <pb id="pg-15-16" n="15:16"/>worst to be <hi rend="italic">without</hi> the power of indulging one&#x2019;s reasonable wishes or to <hi rend="italic">have</hi> the power of indulging ones whims&#x2014; So many people we know seem to have no comfort with their money, just because it enables them to execute all their foolish schemes&#x2014;</p>
<p>Jeannie writes to me that when you discovered my parasol you &#x201C;crossed your hands in despair as if you had seen &#x2018;the suns perpendicular heat&#x2019; already striking down on me&#x2014;&#x201D; I thought you would be vexing yourself about it&#x2014;but I have not missed it in the least&#x2014; The drive here the first day was <hi rend="italic">cold</hi>&#x2014;and since then I have had a parasol of M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Bullers who rejoices in <hi rend="italic">two</hi>&#x2014; And now Good by dearest&#x2014; I have two nice long letters from Jeannie to return some acknowledgement for</p>

<salute>My &#x201C;blessed Babbie&#x201D;</salute>
<p>Another long letter&#x2014;so far I find you perfect!&#x2014;go on in this laudable course and not only will it sooth <hi rend="italic">my</hi> pains of absence, but tend much to the good of your own soul. &#x201C;The devil,&#x201D; they say, &#x201C;is always at the elbow of an idle man&#x2014;still more of an idle woman&#x2014;and to think of the devil at Babbie&#x2019;s elbow! and I not there to exorcise him! My dear, it would give me serious apprehensing.</p>
<p>But with the daily letter to <hi rend="italic">me</hi>&#x2014;and <hi rend="italic">don Carlos</hi>&#x2014;and <hi rend="italic">Helens<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Schiller&#x2019;s play <hi rend="italic">Don Carlos</hi> (<date when="1787-00-00">1787</date>); and Helen Mitchell, the maid.</note> wants</hi>&#x2014;and such <foreign><hi rend="italic">Himmel-sendungs</hi></foreign> [gifts from heaven] (look your German dictionary) as the immortal Creek I have no fear but you will be &#x201C;born thro with an honourable thro-bearing&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-05/lt-18300928-TC-MAC-01"><sic>5:167</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1830-09-28">28 Sept. 1830</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014;</p>
<p>For myself I expect to return to you &#x201C;improved physically at least&#x201D; (to use Mazzinis words) The first day things looked very black about me, and twenty times, like John&#x2019;s M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Ogilvie, &#x201C;I wished to God that I had stayed in London&#x201D;!&#x2014;but I have been better every day since&#x2014; The place is all that a <hi rend="italic">visitor</hi> could wish it&#x2014;green as emeralds&#x2014;with plenty of fine old trees&#x2014;and just that amount of picturesqueness which is compatible with comfort and &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">elegancy</hi>&#x201D;&#x2014; Some people would object <pb id="pg-15-17" n="15:17"/>to the little church-yard so near&#x2014;but in these bright days I find <hi rend="italic">it</hi> rather comforting to look at than otherwise: It is a relief after the horrible London Cemeterys to see a quiet spot like this where the wicked <hi rend="italic">really</hi> cease from troubling and the weary are at rest<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Job 3:17.</note>&#x2014;every time I step <hi rend="italic">out of the window</hi>, I go over to the little church yard, and draw in a sort of breath of quietude from it&#x2014;and think to myself &#x201C;just so will the church yard of Crawford be looking in this blessed sunshine.&#x201D;</p>
<p>For the people; they are what I have always known them for, the politest best-bred people alive&#x2014; They make you feel in their house exactly as if you were in your own, which is the perfection of hospitality.&#x2014; I get up about eight&#x2014;when I hear the man knock at M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Reginalds door&#x2014;dress with a deliberation!&#x2014;my hair has not got as much combing nor my neck as much washing for I know not how long&#x2014;not that I am more caring about the <hi rend="italic">effect</hi> I produce&#x2014;but that it is a pleasure to dress slowly in such a large bright room, looking out on such charming <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;natur&#x201D;!</hi>&#x2014; I descend to the breakfast room about nine&#x2014;where the letters await me beside my plate&#x2014;and then M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Buller prepares the coffee&#x2014;and we breakfast according to the &#x201C;simplest expression&#x201D; of that meal&#x2014;toast and butter just as at home&#x2014;after breakfast out at the window&#x2014;in again at the door&#x2014;and up stairs to my own room&#x2014;where I have both a beautiful sofa and an easy chair&#x2014;white all covered over with coloured birds&#x2014;in the center of my carpet are two white swans kissing each other among reeds!
round them a hexagonal field covered with pagodas and indian trees&#x2014;and round that a border of green and rose-coloured dragons tied together by the tails! and separated into pairs by a square of hierogliphics&#x2014; You never saw such a strange carpet in your life!&#x2014;I am sure there is witchcraft in <supplied>[it]</supplied>,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> which I shall not rest till I have found out&#x2014; My bed is of bamboo&#x2014;shaped like a tent&#x2014;the curtains, as also the window curtains and toilet, white indian muslin&#x2014;embroidered&#x2014;and lined with strawcolour&#x2014;the whole thing has an exotic character which produces an effect on my imagination little as I care for <hi rend="italic">fine</hi> furniture merely fine&#x2014; There is a mirror over the chimneypiece which shows me myself in the bamboo bed! I wish it showed me something lovelier&#x2014; M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Buller does not come down till about two&#x2014;so all the fo<supplied>[r]</supplied>e-noon<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> I may write or read, or think, or run out and in, according to my own sweet will&#x2014;hitherto what I have <hi rend="italic">done</hi> is not capable of being embodied in words&#x2014;</p>
<p>There is no lunch&#x2014;happily&#x2014;but dinner at three&#x2014;no fuss about it&#x2014;but every body getting up so soon as enough has been eaten&#x2014;then to <pb id="pg-15-18" n="15:18"/>the <hi rend="italic">sofas</hi> for half an hour&#x2014;then out for a two or three hours drive&#x2014;at eight we <hi rend="italic">all</hi> make an excellent tea&#x2014;last night I came in mind of poor Alick&#x2019;s<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably Alick Welsh when a child.</note> &#x201C;Aunt Jeannie me&#x2019;s a teibble eater&#x201D;!&#x2014; Before going to bed I play a game at Chess with M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Buller&#x2014;and last night to my own astonishment and still more to <hi rend="italic">his</hi> I beat him! M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Buller retires at <hi rend="italic">ten</hi>&#x2014;and after that I may read if I like in my own room. Such Babbie is my life&#x2014;very <hi rend="italic">harmless</hi> at all events&#x2014;and farewell&#x2014; I do not mean to write two such long letters every day for I am here not to write but to run about&#x2014;and meditate&#x2014;bless thee my babbie&#x2014;give my kind regards to Helen and take care she does not hurt her leg.</p>

<p>Not a word from me today, but thanks, thanks! and keep thyself still, and enjoy the blessed green and sunshine!&#x2014; I am busy as a bee; it is past three o&#x2019;clock, and the day is burning hot. Alas to my &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">business</hi>&#x201D;&#x2014;alas, alas, it is yet nothing of worth. We must still have patience.</p>
<p>Charles Buller is never <hi rend="italic">yet</hi> visible; last night I found he had gone out of town till Tuesday. Tonight I will write to him; try him that way.</p>
<p>Manchester and all the North Cotton Country seems to be in ferment: new soldiers and new artillery went off by railway yesterday. Happily none yet is killed,&#x2014;except I think a poor girl by a brickbat from some mill, and two policemen by the mob.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The trouble had been provoked by three manufactures in Stalybridge, Cheshire, 7&#xBD; mi. E of Manchester, who threatened to cut their weavers&#x2019; wages by 25%. On <date when="1842-08-05">5 Aug.</date> a meeting with one of them (supposedly a member of the Anti-Corn Law League) provoked a turn-out. After a mass meeting, <date when="1842-08-07">7 Aug.</date>, demanding a People&#x2019;s Charter and fair wages, these workers caused a turn-out in other Stalybridge factories, <date when="1842-08-08">8 Aug.</date>, and next day came to Manchester. Those factories that refused to stop work were attached, and at one a girl was killed. The two policemen were injured, <date when="1842-08-10">10 Aug.</date>, d. <date when="1842-08-11">11 Aug.</date> The rioting men and women continued to move about Manchester turning out the factories and holding meetings.

<p>It was the stupidest looking breakfast this morning without any letters!&#x2014;the absence of the loaf or the Coffee pot, would have been <pb id="pg-15-20" n="15:20"/>less sensibly felt! however there is no redress against these London Sundays&#x2014;</p>

I looked in astonishment but could discover nothing&#x2014; The congregation joined in with this invisible thing, which continued to assert its predominance&#x2014;and it was not till the end of the service that Hesketh<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;The butler&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note).</note> informed me the strange instrument was &#x201C;a claironet&#x201D;!!

<salute>My Dearest,</salute>
<p>Thanks as ever for your dear little Letter, for the good news you send me;&#x2014;and pardon that ugly mass of Manuscript,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The account of his trip to Belgium.</note> which you need not read, unless you have <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> to do. Indeed it will contain nothing new for you; and is a <hi rend="italic">fatuity</hi>, little better; but I wanted to have it off my hands for something better: I have hurt all my fingers and thumb in scrawling it, for so many hours: that is the worst ill I have done. Exactly this moment, while the clock strikes <hi rend="italic">four</hi>, I have done with it; and must run to some <hi rend="italic">interior</hi> town post office,&#x2014;and not dine till five!&#x2014;</p>
<p>We go along quite elegantly here: little Jeannie comes down in the morning in a kind of shawl <hi rend="italic">dressing-gown</hi>, almost with the air of a little wife, to make coffee to me! I try to get her some kind of walk or walk<hi rend="italic">let</hi> in the evening; have no trouble with her at all. Helen&#x2019;s leg is still in an ineffectual state, tho&#x2019; now superinted<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For &#x201C;superintended.&#x201D;</note> by John: I think she hurt it one day, the fool, by taking off the dressing altogether. She is <pb id="pg-15-22" n="15:22"/>a fool. It does seem to be mending, to be doing quite well; but there is a hole, I suppose, and it <hi rend="italic">must</hi> have time.</p>
<p>Last night, dinner not yet ended, came Garnier; not half so mad as last time.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-12/lt-18401029-TC-JAC-01"><sic>12:307</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1840-10-29">29 Oct. 1840</date></corr></ref> for TC&#x2019;s most recently stated view that Garnier was mad. He had visited the Carlyles in <date when="1841-01-00">Jan. 1841</date>, but TC noted then only that he sang German songs, not that he was any madder than usual.</note> This morning after breakfast, O who do you think should enter? Good old Mr Dobbie of Thornhill! The sight of him made me very sad, cheery and healthy as the old man looked. He had been at Liverpool; had thereupon decided on seeing London too. He has been living, this week past, in Paradise Row, in Gough House, with some Schoolmaster D. D.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably the Rev. Dr. Wilson, Gough House, Paradise Row (now Royal Hospital Rd.), Chelsea.</note> I think whom he knows. Tomorrow he goes to Southampton for some days; and will then give us notice when he comes back. I sent him off to Allan Cunningham, &#x201C;whose wife he had baptised, in old days.&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jean Cunningham; see <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380703-JWC-JWCU-01"><sic>10:111</sic><corr>JWC to JWCU, <date when="1838-07-03">3 July 1838</date></corr></ref>. Dobbie was minister at Minsriddell, nr. Kirkbean, <date when="1797-00-00">1797</date>&#x2013;<date when="1809-00-00">1809</date>.</note> Ah me, the poor old man, and what he comes from&#x2014;my poor little Jeannie! He made profusion of kind inquiries for you, and whether you had got a Letter he once wrote.</p>
<p>No Letters today, but this scraggy one, very welcome however, for I could get no news of my poor old Mother. I had straitly ordered them to get me the picture of her good old face&#x2014;alas, alas, she is sad to me, almost as if Death had already taken <hi rend="italic">her</hi> too: we are parted for this Earth, and cannot be more together: the stern Lord of <hi rend="italic">Time</hi> has said it, and will be obeyed.</p>
<p>By the bye, if you like you may forward this Netherlands Tour to her address: &#x201C;Mrs James Aitken, English Street, Dumfries N.B.&#x201D; I partly meant them to get a trial at the reading of it, and promised it accordingly. But not unless you like.</p>
<p>No news from Lancashire for me today yet. I believe this day is the anniversary of <hi rend="italic">Peterloo</hi>, and they are keeping that at Manchester. It seems to be the strangest insurrection in the world: no violence, all collision with Authority <hi rend="italic">avoided;</hi> only &#x201C;we will work no more till we see a fair day&#x2019;s wages for a fair days work,&#x2014;till we see <hi rend="italic">the Charter</hi>, which alone can secure us that!&#x201D;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The massacre at St. Peter&#x2019;s Field, Manchester, <date when="1819-08-16">16 Aug. 1819</date>, when cavalry and yeomanry attached a reform meeting, leaving several dead and many wounded. The usual workers&#x2019; procession to commemorate Peterloo was not permitted this year. Generally, during the disturbances, the workers would march on other factories, draw plugs from the boilers and rake out fires to make sure production stopped. If resisted they broke windows or forced factory gates. They demanded food and sometimes money, and at Stockport the workhouse was sacked for bread. If present, troops and police were often stoned. The troops opened fire at Preston, Burnley, Halifax and elsewhere. At a meeting in Manchester, <date when="1842-08-15">15 Aug.</date>, of eighty-two trades&#x2019; delegates, fifty-two declared for the Charter, and nineteen for a rise in wages.</note>&#x2014;</p>

My theory is that it never was in my hands; I do not discern any conceivable history for it otherwise. If Fortune and farther search bring me on any trace of it, you shall directly know.</p>
<p>I have made a Tour in the Netherlands, of thirty hours extent, since I wrote to you: literally a fact! Spring Rice took me in one of his Revenue Cutters;&#x2014;a voyage really worth making. The doll gods and gingerbread idolatries of that people, with the fruit of long centuries of industry and healthy victorious energy growing up beside all that, were very striking to me. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Les braves Belges</hi></foreign> [The worthy Belgians]! They are a <foreign><hi rend="italic">Deutsch</hi></foreign> [German] people; I could read their language when I saw it printed: but the educated of them all affect to be a kind of mongrel French, and go about in moustachios and sugarloaf hats,&#x2014;the blockheads!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC was mainly in the Flemish part of the country.</note> They have still a remnant of quasi-worship among them (respectabler perhaps than our remnant of &#x201C;sincere-cant&#x201D;), and crowds of the nastiest ugly fat Priests, whom you could not occasionally divest yourself of a horrible passing desire to slaughter, and cure as bacon!</p>
<p>What a melancholy and strange thing is that Chartist hunger-insurrection
in your end of the Island!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably referring generally to the north of England, where the riots and troubles had spread from the Manchester area to the West Riding of Yorkshire, particularly Huddersfield, <date when="1842-08-13">13 Aug.</date>, Halifax, <date when="1842-08-15">15 Aug.</date> (where troops fired on the crowds, <date when="1842-08-16">16 Aug.</date>), and Bradford, <date when="1842-08-16">16 Aug.</date> Leeds was protected by troops and most mills kept working.</note> What a country is it where <pb id="pg-15-24" n="15:24"/>the Governing Class turns a deaf ear to all considerations, and will hear nothing till it hear the actual alarum-bell droning; see nothing till it see Swing&#x2019;s fires blazing!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The apocryphal figure of Capt.

A man ought <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to vote for Corn-Laws; hang it, no!&#x2014; But I will not quarrel with Richard Milnes let him vote for what he may.

<salute>Dear Goodykin,</salute>
<p>Do not <hi rend="italic">fret</hi> yourself writing Letters; entertaining to us as they are always, and the chief event of the day, we will not have them at the expense of plaguing you: write when you can; to enjoy the country and be well is poor Goody&#x2019;s work at present. She is indeed a &#x201C;capital hand with the pen,&#x201D; makes a letter out of mere Trostons and vacancies such as you see,&#x2014;but let them come as free fruits, a pleasure to herself as well as me. And yet on whatever day you <hi rend="italic">can</hi> contrive to write a bit of a word&#x2014;!&#x2014;</p>

<p>Helen&#x2019;s leg is fast mending, able to carry her triumphantly up stairs these two days; today she has clothes out, and asked me for more money to grocerize with: never mind her at all,&#x2014;nor little Babbie either, who I do believe enjoys the degree of work she has.

<p><pb id="pg-15-29" n="15:29"/>The weather is the hottest I have known for years&#x2014;and the upper part of this house, being of a cottage make, pretty nearly uninhabitable&#x2014; For the last two or three days I have not crossed the threshhold till after dinner&#x2014;even then there would be no going out without a carriage&#x2014;but the evening drives <hi rend="italic">are</hi> delicious&#x2014;the country about would not please Carlyle&#x2014;there is a want of hills&#x2014;but for me, born in flat East Lothian, it is quite satisfactory&#x2014;and there is such an air of sufficiency and peace all over it, that one hears of these insurrections so near, as tidings from another world&#x2014; I am <hi rend="small-caps">sure</hi> the poor people here are not ill off&#x2014;one can see it in their faces and in the pride they take in ornamenting their bits of thatched cottages&#x2014;nevertheless there has been calamity here also&#x2014; One farmer had a stockyard, value twelve hundred pounds, burnt to the ground the other night, and another had his barn burnt to the ground&#x2014;neither misfortunes were willful however&#x2014;the latter was caused by a boy&#x2019;s setting fire to a wasp&#x2019;s nest the former by having stacked the grain before it was ready for it&#x2014;there has been a willful fire further off&#x2014;on some nobleman&#x2019;s place&#x2014;I forget where&#x2014;but all the walls at Bury were stuck over one night with placards on which I read the words <hi rend="italic">pardon</hi>&#x2014;&#xa3;50 reward&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">fire</hi></p>

<p>No adventure whatever yesterday; except a call from <foreign><hi rend="italic">Stimabile</hi></foreign> to Jeannie, we were all still as August in London. I went to Cochrane the blockhead, and found that his <hi rend="italic">Neibuhr</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Either Barthold Georg Niebuhr, <hi rend="italic">R&#xF6;mische Geschichte</hi> of which the Library had the <date when="1832-00-00">1832</date>&#x2013;<date when="1836-00-00">36</date> edn., or Hare, Thirlwall, Smith and Schmitz, trans. of Niebuhr, <hi rend="italic">The History of Rome</hi>, 3 vols. (<date when="1828-00-00">1828</date>&#x2013;<date when="1842-00-00">42</date>).</note> Book was not under my name at all, but merely under that of a man standing next me on his Books! I called for Cha<hi rend="italic">s</hi> Buller; in vain: I mean to try again today. After dinner I fell into a sleep as of lead; could hardly awaken again all evening, not even when I went out to an hour&#x2019;s walking. Jeannie had walked a little by herself about Post-time. About bedtime arose noise of drunken riot, which ceased not all over the neighbourhood till midnight. Mere gin and brutalism. Mazeppa was kicking in the rear. I hoped it was quieter with you at Troston!&#x2014; Nevertheless I dropped rapidly again into leaden sleep, into nightmare &#x26;c, and slept in a leaden manner for some eight hours,&#x2014;awakening <pb id="pg-15-31" n="15:31"/>altogether <foreign><hi rend="italic">ourie</hi></foreign> [chill], and in great want of a shower-bath, which I straightway <hi rend="italic">got</hi>. I have been trying the pen all morning: <foreign>ay de mi!</foreign></p>
<p>Lancashire appears to be in considerable effervescence. Read Ballantyne&#x2019;s Letter: his Newspaper I could send too, but I know you will not read it; so off it fares to Dumfries. At any rate the Letter contains a summary of all; which is a mere tumultuary trooping of a Hunger-mob.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Ballantyne; his paper, the <hi rend="italic">Manchester Guardian</hi>, was partly sympathetic to the workers, e.g., <date when="1842-08-15">15 Aug.</date>, reporting: &#x201C;Though charity may do much, and the plunder of bakers and provision dealers may do some little towards supplying the famishing thousands who must speedily crowd our streets, these things will be but as a drop of water in the ocean, compared with the sweeping destitution which will exist. Even the means of private charity will be speedily exhausted; and bakers and provision dealers will not continue to fill their shops, in order that they may be emptied by plunderers. How will the working classes live for another week? Supposing the town to be, as they imagine, entirely in their hands, they will not be able to find the means of existence.
But they will find to their cost that the town is not in their hands; that there is both the inclination and the ability to vindicate the law; and they will speedily be taught that their designs are as dangerous to themselves as they are wicked and mischievous in their consequences to all. For the detriment to society, for the wide-spread famine and misery and wretchedness which their schemes are producing, these men care nothing; but they will care when the sharp vengeance of the law falls, as it speedily will fall, on their own heads. &#x2026; Disguise it as we may, the present movement is a rising against the government and the law. Call it by what name we please, <hi rend="italic">it is really an insurrection</hi>&#x201D; (quoted by the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, <date when="1842-08-20">20 Aug.</date>).</note> I have actually uttered a <hi rend="italic">forbidden</hi> curse on Graham,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sir James Graham, home sec.</note> Peel &#x26; Co, and feel that one&#x2019;s blood cannot <hi rend="italic">continue</hi> cool at sight of men shot for famine&#x2014;not, in these times, by these men.&#x2014; <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dearest.

<p>Just a word, my Dearest, before going out to walk: there will be no means tomorrow.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sun.</note> We go on quite handsomely here; Helen&#x2019;s lameness mending,&#x2014;not interfering with the little Cousin&#x2019;s comfort much, or mine at all. She has given up the dressing-gown, I think, of late mornings; but is ever the same cheery little creature in whatever kind of gown.&#x2014; I am writing, writing; God knows at what precisely! It is terribly difficult to work: my whole soul and body are sunk as in tropical oppression,&#x2014;no &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">wish</hi> to sew&#x201D;;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech.</note> no distinct wish of any <pb id="pg-15-32" n="15:32"/>kind, but a certain base underhand desire to lie down in everlasting leaden sleep. Yesterday, on sallying out, it was a kind of strange satisfaction, as of surprise, that I could still stand upon my legs. The day before I had not gone out at all; I had worked a while weeding at the Garden: it was the intolerablest day of heat that I remember in this world,&#x2014;or <hi rend="italic">one</hi> of the intolerablest! Jack&#x2019;s thermometer, which I had the curiosity to look at, and compute into Farenheit degrees, after tea, was standing at 84&#xB0; 4/10; at midnight, it was still above 80&#xB0;. Mazzini, smoking with me, said such a temperature was reckon<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> torrid even in Italy. Happily all that is now gone, and we have instead a blessed gray southwest wind.&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; Alas, <hi rend="italic">work</hi> cannot be done without difficulty even in Greenland. All work from me is, and has been, as a bridge-building over Chaos; a thing that never was or can be easy; a thing nevertheless which must and shall be done!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For the bridge over &#x201C;Chaos,&#x201D; see <hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi> 10:293&#x2013;305. In his Journal TC wrote, <date when="1842-10-25">25 Oct.</date>: &#x201C;My working does not absolutely cease; yet when I look back over weeks, months, years of it, difficult to remember <hi rend="italic">what it has been</hi>. Of a truth I have got into strange conditions, and manner of existence! &#x2018;Reform&#x2019; for <hi rend="italic">me</hi> is of pressing necessity. / This month of <date when="1842-08-00">August</date> we have had a general insurrection of the working people all over the Lancashire and Yorkshire regions; in Warwickshire, Staffordshire too, in several parts of Scotland: it was of the nature of a strike for wages; a very tragic and strange thing to see.&#x2014; I wrote, in those weeks, some observations, hints, struggling <hi rend="italic">semi</hi>-utterances down on paper; with some idea of making a Discourse of it adapted to the time. But it would not take effect.&#x2014; My <hi rend="italic">heart</hi> is worn dry and hard; nothing affects me, seems wonderful or beautiful to me, as it did some years ago. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Que deviendrais-je</hi></foreign> [What shall I become]? I am beginning to grow <hi rend="italic">old;</hi> a very strange, a very tragic process.&#x2014;&#x201D;</note>&#x2014;</p>
<p>Yesterday there called, when I was out, that poor brother-in-law of Edinburgh Betty&#x2019;s:<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Braid. Her brother-in-law not further identified.</note> from Jeannie&#x2019;s account, altho&#x2019; the man is well enough in his way, I do not think you have missed much. Some goodnatured, but very vulgar-minded purse-proud Mechanic I conjectured him to be: he is gone to Liverpool, to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, and specified no date for returning. In the evening Mrs Jameson<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Anna Brownell Jameson.</note> came; I was out roving far and wide over the grass in Hyde Park: she had not staid long, had left kind messages for you,&#x2014;congratulations that you were in the country, whither next week she herself was bound. No Letters for us;&#x2014;<foreign><hi rend="italic">tant mieux</hi></foreign> [so much the better]. A Note from Mrs Sterling to Jeannie about the miserable Dumfries straw.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A hat, or straw to make a hat.</note> Perhaps Jeannie is herself forwarding it to you? If not, I will.&#x2014; Some nameless hand, not Ballantyne, sends me a new Manchester Paper today. The insurrection continues, the tenth day of it now; I begin really to be anxious <pb id="pg-15-33" n="15:33"/>about it, and wish it were well over,&#x2014;that blood be not shed, and seeds of long baleful vengeance sown. A country in a lamentabler state (to my eyes) than ours even now has rarely shewn itself under the sun. We seem to me near anarchies, things nameless,&#x2014;and a secret voice whispers now and then to me: Thou, behold thou too art of it, thou <hi rend="italic">must</hi> be of it! I declare to Heaven I would not have the governing of this England at present for the richest &#x201C;cream and short-bread&#x201D; that could be named! Enough of that.</p>
<p>Did I tell you, or did Mrs Buller, that Jane Strachey is about to be married?<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jane (d. <date when="1886-00-00">1886</date>), Julia Strachey&#x2019;s da., m. John Hare, a prosperous Bristol carpet manufacturer, on <date when="1842-10-15">15 Oct.</date></note> She is with her Mother in Italy at present; but returns under the escort of a Bristol Manufacturer, one Mr Hare I think, who goes out to wed her shortly, or perhaps is already gone. He is wealthy, young,&#x2014;approved of by the Brother Strachey,<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edward.</note> who told me all this. He, the poor lame Brother Strachey, is no better yet, nor like to be; a most amiable, melancholy object.</p>
<p>Methinks I hear the <foreign>Stimabile</foreign>&#x2019;s cough down stairs! At all events paper and time are ended, and I must go. Enjoy your fine green solitudes, and Calthorpe deserted palace, and little games of chess; and be a good lassie, and love me, my own little Jean!&#x2014; A letter on <hi rend="italic">Monday?</hi> <closer><salute>Yours ever</salute></closer></p>
<name>T.C.</name>
<ps><p>No <foreign>Stimabile</foreign> down below; nor any Cousin Jeannie even, but a Letter of hers with your address on it: so enough. It strikes <hi rend="italic">three</hi> o&#x2019;clock, as I am Sinner. <foreign>Adieu</foreign>, <foreign>adieu!</foreign>&#x2014;</p></ps>

Why are not at least all those cocks and cockerels boiled into soup, into everlasting silence? Or if the Devil, some good night, should take his hammer, and should smite into shivers all and every the Pianos of our European world, so that in broad Europe there were not one Piano left soundable, would the harm be great; would not on the contrary the relief be considerable? For once that you hear any real music from a Piano do you not five hundred times hear mere artistic somersets, distracted jangling, and the hapless pretence of music? Let him that has lodged wall-neighbour to an Operatic artist of stringed music say! This miserablest young woman that now in the next house to me spends all her bright young days, not in learning to darn stockings, sew shirts, bake pastry, or any art, mystery or business that will profit herself or others, not even in amusing herself, and skipping on the grass-plots with laughter of her mates, but simply and solely in raging, from dawn to dusk, to night and midnight, on a hapless Piano, which it is evident she will never in this world learn to render musical,&#x2014;more musical than a pair of barn-fanners: the miserable young female!
The sound of her through the wall is to me an emblem of the whole distracted hollow misery of this age; and her barn-fanners rhythm becomes all-too significant.&#x201D; (JWC owned a piano which TC enjoyed hearing).</note>&#x2014; She had got it from M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Buller before I went down&#x2014;and read it half thro&#x2014;but finding the hand &#x201C;most provokingly illegible&#x201D; she made <hi rend="italic">me</hi> read the rest aloud to her!</p>
<p>They are very anxious you would come &#x201C;and bring Miss Jeannie along with you&#x201D;&#x2014; &#x201C;Regy would be delighted to have a young Lady&#x201D;&#x2014; More delighted I imagine than the young Lady would be to have Regy!&#x2014;altho he <hi rend="italic">does</hi> improve on acquaintance&#x2014;laziness and what his <pb id="pg-15-36" n="15:36"/>Mother calls &#x201C;muddling habits&#x201D; are the worst things one can charge him with&#x2014;one of the people who with the best intentions are always unfortunate&#x2014;but he <hi rend="italic">is</hi> very sweet tempered, and kindly, deserves really the only epithet that remained for him seeing there was already &#x201C;the clever Buller&#x201D; and &#x201C;the handsome Buller&#x201D;&#x2014;viz: &#x201C;the good Buller.&#x201D; If he were not so completely the victim of snuff I should think that an attractive Babbie might be very beneficial to him!&#x2014;but I would as soon undertake the reformation of a drunkard as of anybody that snuffs as he does&#x2014;</p>

<p>I feel so annoyed at the upshot or probable upshot of our New Zealand speculation that I hardly can put it in words: so I forward a part of my Husband&#x2019;s last letter to me, with a note from Mr. C. Buller, to tell their own story. I distinctly think with Carlyle that any adventure which George Rennie is at the head of would need &#x2018;to be looked at on both sides&#x2019; before connecting John with it&#x2014;George Rennie, tho&#x2019; a clever and enterprising man, has some want of <hi rend="italic">perseverance</hi> or other want in him which hinders his <hi rend="italic">ever</hi> succeeding in any business he undertakes, besides I do not like his principles of action which are all for his own vulgar aggrandisement&#x2014; Hang him anyhow for having so misled me in the present case!&#x2014;to have heard the decided way in which he talked no one would have suspected any more than myself that he was talking either without full knowledge or with wilful mystification. Carlyle says &#x2018;exhort you to patience&#x2019;&#x2014; I fancy you are better at practising patience than I am at merely preaching it. One thing be sure of; that we shall be constantly on the outlook for some situation for John until he be fairly employed. Surely among our many friends in <hi rend="italic">authority</hi>, some one may be found to give him a helping hand.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Welsh was engaged on the advice of one of his professors at Edinburgh, J.

<p><salute>Dearest,&#x2014;</salute> We have got your good long Letter today, and amicably divided it between us,&#x2014;&#x201C;Babbie&#x201D; letting me even retain a small portion of hers, for the sake of the sheet it was on. My head is aching in the heat, my miserable scribble is done; along with Harriett&#x2019;s Letter, take one word.</p>
<p>What a misery that when all else is so right you cannot get sleep for noises! It is equivalent to the wretchedest King&#x2019;s-veto put upon <pb id="pg-15-38" n="15:38"/>every other advantage whatsoever. I know not what to advise,&#x2014;if your kind hosts are still unable to quell these despicabilities of yowling whelps &#x26;c from under their windows. For one thing I would have myself, if I could get it, a sleep during the day. Total want of sleep renders one doubly sensible to all kinds of noises; any snatch of sleep is useful; the smallest contributions thankfully received!</p>
<p>Tell Mrs Buller I will write to her, but do not yet know what to answer: I will consider the matter, and then answer. My present oppression under the heat and horrible oven-like air of this Brick-Babylon is not favourable for enterprise! But, after all, there is not much that ails me; I have only my miserable sluggish <hi rend="italic">self</hi> to fight against: it is a shame to complain!</p>
<p>Yesternight I walked seven miles with Jack; Jeannie and I had walked, in the day, round by Hyde Park to the uttermost corner of it, and home thro&#x2019; Kensington Gardens: fair work, I think?&#x2014; But it begins to strike me that our <hi rend="italic">dietetics</hi> are perhaps capable of improvement! We have gone entirely on <hi rend="italic">coffee</hi> since you left us, which Helen continues to make with admirable effect: tomorrow morning, what if we try <hi rend="italic">tea!</hi>&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>Helen&#x2019;s wounded leg was getting a kind of bore: we have called in the aid of the youngest <hi rend="italic">stick</hi>-<hi rend="small-caps">womanlet</hi> (I mean the Stickwoman&#x2019;s<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly a woman who provided kindling for the fire.</note> younger daughter, the elder not being procurable), and ordered Helen to confine herself for the present to the <hi rend="italic">Kitchen</hi>. Galloping up and down stairs was the continual obstruction of her surgery. Jeannie says she is now improving <hi rend="italic">rapidly</hi>. The little girl is a tidy creature; answers the door, brings up the dinner &#x26;c &#x26;c; and all goes perfectly as it should do. We had John yesterday (as the previous Sunday) to investigate the wound; which he pro<supplied>[no]</supplied>unces<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letters omitted.</note> to be in a very reasonable state. I have only one request to make about it, that the good Wifiekin will put the matter totally out of her head, as in real truth &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">no</hi> matter,&#x201D; and not fret or hurry herself in any respect whatever about that. It does really form a kind of amusement for Jeannie, I believe; and for me there is no change perceptible in my footpaths, but the ground continues everywhere free and good for me.</p>
<p>Today there is a Letter from Jean at Dumfries, with news of a poor but true and worthy Aunt, <hi rend="italic">Aunt Tibbie&#x2019;s</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Isabella McKinnon.</note> death at Hawick;&#x2014;you remember one of her daughters at my Uncle John&#x2019;s.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Aitken at Dumfries.</note> She had <pb id="pg-15-39" n="15:39"/>been for many months in suffering with total rheumatism &#x26;c: alas, poor Aunt Tibbie; I can remember her a brisk, truehearted figure out of my earliest boyhood: and now, in poverty, rheumatism, and all kinds of sorrow, except that of faintheartedness or falseness in herself, or unkindness in those around her, she has to bow her head and die! Her husband<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hugh McKinnon.</note> is a good cheery and worthy man; I am truly sorry for him. Ah, me&#x2014;when I look back upon all&#x2014; Ah me!&#x2014; But there is no use in &#x201C;Ah&#x201D;-ing. Courage, Courage!</p>
<p>Was there not something else I had to tell thee today? I really cannot remember; and yet, and yet&#x2014; But if anything, it was a thing of no moment at all; merely perhaps some <hi rend="italic">tellable</hi> thing. I send thee my heart&#x2019;s blessing; I do weary for thee, my poor woman, but thou shalt stay and get better, while that serves! <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>.</salute></closer></p>
<name>T. C.</name>
<ps><p>The riots seem to be ceasing: I send Mr Buller this Manchester Paper, to shew him that comfortable fact.

<salute>My dear Jean,</salute>
<p>Your two Notes have successively come; at their due times: thanks to you for them. I also saw Jack&#x2019;s the day after it arrived; Jack himself I have seen twice since then. It appears, by the best guess I can make, that this may find you with my Mother at Gill on Thursday; you will all get my little scantling of news or no-news at once.</p>
<p>Jack instantly took measures with me about Jenny&#x2019;s money. This very day, I suppose, he will send off &#xa3;5 for her to your care at the Dumfries Post-Office; it is most likely lying there at the time you read this; you will of course send the money down <supplied>[to Jenny at]</supplied> the first chance. We agreed o<supplied>[n his paying this su]</supplied>m at present, to make the matter straight <supplied>[between hi]</supplied>m and me. We had some consulting about what would be the right <hi rend="italic">annual sum</hi> to send; we thought about &#xa3;4 a quarter, &#xa3;16 a year, to be sent regularly at <pb id="pg-15-40" n="15:40"/>the four quarter-days of the year (equinox, solstice, mid-winter) might be the fit sum; but we want your advice still; and will have you to consider and say. It is impossible to get much light out of Jenny herself; for she, with a very natural modesty, holds back: but you with my Mother can consult together, and, without consulting her at all, advise us. Four pounds a quarter is something under a shilling a-day; if you think more will be of real service to her, say more. But doubtless it would be her chief blessing if she could get something of her own to do withal; and a motive ought to be left her for that. It seems to me she will be best entirely in an establishment of her own, under a roof of her own: this she ought to contemplate as the season draws round. Of Rob<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hanning.</note> I do not think she will ever get more good: it would be well if she could entirely forget his existence; but this, of course, she will not be willing to do till she herself see farther. Pray encourage her, poor little thing. Tell her, in the meanwhile, that she is not to take it up in the way of <hi rend="italic">pride;</hi> there is no instruction for one in pride: this is a real humiliation and disappointment,&#x2014;as <hi rend="italic">such</hi> she must accept it: but it is an <hi rend="italic">innocent</hi> humiliation for her (which few are); and a worthy and honourable life, if <hi rend="italic">she</hi> have worth (which is now to be tried), still lies before her in this world.&#x2014; Preaching indeed is oftenest useless in such cases; therefore I will not preach any more: but recommend the good little creature to the good affection and help of us all, by what means soever we have it in our power to help.</p>
<p>The day after I saw Jack&#x2019;s Letter, I addressed a small message to Hawick with a draft of two sovereigns as a gift to our poor suffering Aunt Tibbie. It now appears she had already got beyond all earthly suffering and earthly help; and would not know that any friend was caring for her even so far, in this quarter. Well; her heavy burden is done; borne to the end <hi rend="italic">without</hi> help of mine. Poor Tibbie; her death is very sad to me: my Mother will be much grieved;&#x2014;but long sorrows and many losses have taught her to bear patiently one other sorrow and loss. Living or Dead we are all present with the Most High God: a little while, and we shall all be on <hi rend="italic">one</hi> side of the veil, and no Death can divide us farther any more! Poor Hugh:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >McKinnon, her husband; see <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380913-TC-MAC-01"><sic>10:174</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1838-09-13">13 Sept. 1838</date></corr></ref>.</note> one is sorry for him too. I told them to write to my Mother; that they need not write to me any acknowledgement, for I should soon hear round by Scotsbrig.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>We are moderately well and busy here; tho&#x2019; suffering sadly from <hi rend="italic">heat</hi> now and then. Last week is of a truly West-Indian temperature: <pb id="pg-15-41" n="15:41"/>so much the better for the harvest,&#x2014;for the Poor among others. They are getting quiet at Manchester, I believe: what else can they do?</p>
<p>Jane still continues in Suffolk; seems to get on</p>

<p>Today still I do not write to Mrs Buller: but alas I fear there is no chance of my mustering courage, <hi rend="italic">unexcited</hi> by the feminine energy, to embark on such a business,&#x2014;in this dreadful weather, the temperature again near 90&#xB0;!

<p>The pen was in my hand to write yesterday&#x2014;but nothing could have come out of me yesterday except &#x201C;literature of desperation&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Litteratur der Verzweiflung</hi></foreign> was Goethe&#x2019;s definit<hi rend="italic">n</hi> of Victor Hugo &#x26; Co&#x2019;s new gospel&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note).</note>&#x2014;and aware of this, I thought it better to hold my peace for the next twentyfour hours&#x2014;till a new night should either have rehabilitated me for remaining a while longer, or brought me to the desperate resolution of flying home for my life&#x2014; Last night, heaven be thanked, went off peacably&#x2014;and today I am in a state to record my last trial, without danger of becoming too tragical, or alarming you with the prospect of my making an unseemly termination of my visit&#x2014; (Oh what pens)&#x2014; To begin where I left off&#x2014;On Sunday after writing to you I attended the afternoon service!&#x2014; Regy looked so <foreign><hi rend="italic">wae</hi></foreign>, when I answered his question &#x201C;Whether I was going,&#x201D; in the negative&#x2014;that a weak pity inducted me to revise my determination&#x2014; &#x201C;It is a nice pew that of ours&#x201D; said old M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Buller &#x201C;it suits <hi rend="italic">me</hi> remarkably well&#x2014;for being so <hi rend="italic">deep</hi>.

    My head had ached more or less all day and I was glad to get to bed&#x2014;where I was once more fortunate enough to get slept without any <hi rend="italic">violent</hi> disturbance&#x2014;the next day however my head was rather worse than better&#x2014;so that I would fair have &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">declined from</hi>&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;The phrase of a rustic cousin of ours, a kind of solemn pedant in his way&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note).</note> calling on Lady Agnes<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Lady Agnes Byng, I believe; the Lady of Livermere&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note).</note>&#x2014;but M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Buller was bent on going to Livermere, and so as I did not feel up to walking, it was my only chance of getting any fresh air and exercise that day&#x2014;to Livermere we went then before dinner. the dinner being defered till five oclock&#x2014;to suit the more fashionable hours of our <foreign>visit&#xE9;es</foreign>&#x2014; &#x201C;The Pagets&#x201D;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;The Pagets,&#x201D; who were a distinguished family ennobled in the sixteenth cent., was how JWC referred to the Byngs; Lady Agnes&#x2019; grandfather, after inheriting the baronetcy through his mother Caroline, adopted Paget as a surname.</note> seem to be extremely like other mortals&#x2014;neither better nor bonnier nor wiser&#x2014; To do them justice however, they might, as we found them, having been sitting for a picture of high-life <hi rend="italic">doing</hi> the amiable and the rural in the country&#x2014; They had placed a table under the shadow of a beech-tree&#x2014;and at this sat M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> <pb id="pg-15-44" n="15:44"/>Byng studying the Examiner, Lady Agnes reading &#x201C;O nothing at all, only some nonsense that Lord Londonderry has been printing<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charles William (formerly Stewart) Vane (<date when="1778-00-00">1778</date>&#x2013;<date when="1854-00-00">1854</date>; <ref target="volume-15/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/26467"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), 3d marquess of Londonderry, <date when="1822-00-00">1822</date>, <hi rend="italic">A Steam Voyage to Constantinople, by the Rhine and the Danube, in <date when="1840-00-00">1840</date>&#x2013;<date when="1841-00-00">41</date>, and to Portugal, Spain &#x26;c., in <date when="1839-00-00">1839</date></hi>, 2 vols.

<p>When we had sat sufficiently long under the tree&#x2014;M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Buller asked her to take me thro the gardens which she did very politely, and gave me some carnations and verbinum&#x2014;and then thro <hi rend="italic">the stables!</hi> which were indeed the finest sight of the two&#x2014;all this sightseeing however did not help my head&#x2014;at night I let the chess go as it liked&#x2014;took some medicine&#x2014;and went early to bed&#x2014;determined to be well on the morrow&#x2014; About twelve I fell into a sound sleep&#x2014;out of which I was startled by the tolling of the church bell!&#x2014;the church you remember is only a stonecast from the house, so that when the <pb id="pg-15-45" n="15:45"/>bell tolls one seems to be exactly under its tongue!&#x2014; I sprang up&#x2014;it was half after <hi rend="italic">three</hi> by my watch&#x2014;hardly light&#x2014;the bell went on to toll&#x2014;two loud dismal strokes at regular intervals of a minute&#x2014; What could it be&#x2014;I fancied fire&#x2014;fancied insurrection&#x2014;I ran out into the passage and listened at Regys door all was still&#x2014;then I listened at M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Buller&#x2019;s&#x2014;heard her cough&#x2014;surely thought since she is awake she would ring her bell if there were anything alarming for her in this tolling&#x2014;it must be some other noise of the many they &#x201C;have used to&#x201D;&#x2014;so I went to bed again but of course could not get another wink of sleep all night&#x2014;for the bell only ceased tolling at my ear about six in the morning and then I was too <hi rend="italic">nervous</hi> to avail myself of the silence&#x2014; &#x201C;What on earth was that bell?&#x201D; I asked Regy the first thing in the morning&#x2014; &#x201C;O it was only <hi rend="italic">the passing bell!</hi>&#x2014;it was ordered to be rung during the night for an old Lady who died the night before&#x201D;!

<p><salute>My poor sleepless perturbed Goody!</salute> Alas, what can we do for thee in that sad annoyance? Say that thy own bed here is quieter; that passing-bells, at least do not ring here by night!</p>
<p>I begin to fear that I may as well write to Mrs Buller, and say plainly, No. Nocturnal Ass-braying and church-belling would make a horrible affair of it for two. Besides, in good sooth, I feel as if I did not deserve any favour or rustication at present; as if I had strength enough in me to do some work first, if I had the heart in me. My one possibility of a scheme was by some Ipswich Steamer. Ipswich, I think, must be some 30 or 35 miles from you; and this, even if there were no coach, not even to Needham or Stowmarket, I could manage to walk in a day, or nearly so. But the Ipswich Steamconcern has its Office far east at London Bridge; at the Regent&#x2019;s Circus they have no account of it.&#x2014; I hardly think it is worth a voyage so far east?<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ipswich is a port and the county town of Suffolk ca. 35 mi. from Troston; steamers to it ran from a point between Blackfriars Bridge and London Bridge.</note>&#x2014;</p>

<salute>Dear&#x2014;</salute>
<p>I hardly expected any letter from you this morning, so that I was all the gladder to find it beside my plate as usual&#x2014; Along with it was one from Elizabeth Pepoli&#x2014;the chief merit of which, besides the kindness of writing at all, is, that &#x201C;it expects <hi rend="italic">no</hi> answer&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>

<p><salute>Dearest,&#x2014;</salute> I assure thee we <hi rend="italic">are</hi> very well here; all well,&#x2014;except my invincible Stupidity, inability to work with success! For <hi rend="italic">which</hi> what remedy is there? Evidently none, except within one&#x2019;s own skin. Be easy then, and let no thought of us be other than pleasant to thee.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>We <hi rend="italic">had</hi> copious splashings of rain; today our climate is delightful. <hi rend="italic">Helen&#x2019;s limb</hi> is perfectly sound again: she had fretted it the day after you went away, by <hi rend="italic">leaving off the dressing</hi>, and jigging about, all day, with the wound bare. Wise woman that she was! We had to keep her, by sheer imperative moral-force, sitting quiet, till the businessed<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> <pb id="pg-15-51" n="15:51"/>healed itself, and the little Stickwoman (a very assiduous, seemly little thing) could be safely dismissed.</p>
<p>This morning I slept till nine, a heavy <foreign><hi rend="italic">treacle</hi></foreign> sleep; my day&#x2019;s work is accordingly left <hi rend="italic">not</hi> done: ah me!</p>
<p>The day before yesterday I did call for the Reeves; was admitted to the Drawing-room: &#x201C;They are <hi rend="italic">not</hi> in; nobody is in!&#x201D; whereupon I left my card, and joyfully withdrew.&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; That same evening I had fallen asleep on the sofa; a loud door-knock woke me; in the twilight, tea standing on the table: a man entered in white trowsers, whom Helen named&#x2014;Oedipus knows what, some mere mumble: in my dim condition I took him for Mackintosh<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly Robert James Mackintosh, Fanny Wedgwood&#x2019;s brother and Mary Rich&#x2019;s half-brother.</note> again, and held out my hand; but his hand was clammy, irresponsive; he was not Mackintosh! &#x201C;He was impowered to call on me by Miss Fox, of Falmouth&#x201D;;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Caroline Fox (<date when="1819-00-00">1819</date>&#x2013;<date when="1871-00-00">71</date>; <ref target="volume-15/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/10019"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), who had got to know Richard Owen (see next note) when he visited Falmouth, <date when="1841-08-00">Aug. 1841</date>. She was greatly taken with him. Owen was then reading TC&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">The French Revolution</hi>, and was reminded by him of &#x201C;Milton in his prose works, whence he thinks he derives much of the peculiarity of his style. Talking of Carlyle&#x2019;s message of sympathy with the entire race, Owen dissents&#x201D; (Fox 134&#x2013;38). They renewed their friendship in London in <date when="1842-00-00">1842</date>, when she visited the Museum of the College of Surgeons, <date when="1842-05-17">17 May</date> (Fox 153, 156&#x2013;57). He was also a friend of her father, Robert Were Fox, and her brothers.</note>&#x2014;he got seated, disclosed himself as a man of huge coarse head, with projecting brow and chin (like a cheese in the <hi rend="italic">last</hi> quarter), with a pair of large protrusive glittering eyes, which he did not direct to me or to anybody, but sat staring with, into the blue vague! There sat he, and talked, in a copious, but altogether vague way; like a man lecturing, like a man hurried, embarrassed and not knowing well what to do.
        I thought with myself, Good Heavens can this be some vagrant Yankee; Lion-hunting Insipidity,&#x2014;biped perhaps escaped from Bedlam; coming in on me by stealth? He talked a minute longer; he proved to be Owen the Geological Anatomist, a man of real faculty, whom I had wished to see;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Richard Owen (<date when="1804-00-00">1804</date>&#x2013;<date when="1892-00-00">92</date>; <ref target="volume-15/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/21026"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), first Hunterian prof. of compar. anatomy and physiology, at the Royal College of Surgeons, <date when="1836-00-00">1836</date>&#x2013;<date when="1856-00-00">56</date>; he had studied in Edinburgh and Paris; author of numerous works in his subject, he was of eccentric appearance and treated with caution by many of his colleagues. He was chairman of the jury on raw materials for the Great Exhibition, <date when="1851-00-00">1851</date>; supt. of the natural history collections of the British Museum, <date when="1856-00-00">1856</date>&#x2013;<date when="1883-00-00">83</date>, and obtained their removal from the library to S Kensington. TC had heard of him through John Sterling, who had also met him nr. Falmouth in <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>, and wrote to TC, <date when="1841-08-29">29 Aug. 1841</date>, that he was &#x201C;evidently a very strong-headed thoughtful man.&#x201D; TC had written to Owen asking to meet, and Owen&#x2019;s call, <date when="1842-08-24">24 Aug.</date>, was the result. After TC&#x2019;s visit to the Museum, <date when="1842-08-28">28 Aug.</date>, with John Carlyle, Owen said to his wife, &#x201C;I have such a dread of the personality of an author destroying in great measure his ideality, that I am pleased to find in this case that it is not so and that Carlyle proved to be, as far as I am concerned, much what one could wish&#x201D; (Richard Owen, <hi rend="italic">The Life of Richard Owen</hi> [<date when="1894-00-00">1894</date>] 1:197&#x2013;98).</note> my recognition of him issued in peals of laughter, and I got <pb id="pg-15-52" n="15:52"/>two hours of excellent talk out of him: a man of real ability, who could tell me innumerable things!&#x2014; After his departure I asked Helen what she had called him? &#x201C;She did not know, but was quite sure it was his right name at any rate!&#x201D;&#x2014; What an assistant this little damsel would have been to Adam, when <hi rend="italic">names</hi> were just beginning!&#x2014;</p>
<p>You do not tell me <hi rend="italic">what</hi> the good Harriet says of Milnes: but I can readily conceive it. She has a most infirm judgement; and ever had, and will have. Gambardella met me on the street one day: his aversion, not to say secret abhorrence, appeared to be great, of poor Harriet: &#x201C;Did not <hi rend="italic">like</hi> to paint <hi rend="italic">it!</hi>&#x201D;&#x2014; I could not keep from bursting into laughter at such a combination: The hungry white bleached Socinian Formula of these Northern latitudes with the hungry hot Caliban and Poussin Satyr of the South! It must have been &#x201C;myst<hi rend="italic">er</hi>ous,&#x201D; as Helen says!</p>
<p>John sends me that Note of Counsel yesterday; I suppose he had been with young Strachey, for I did not speak with him on the subject. Mrs Strachey&#x2019;s place is not exactly in Clifton, but at a village called Henbury on the north side of the Downs, perhaps five miles from Bristol. A pony and country air would be one of the usefullest and agreeablest things to me: but nothing, not even this thing, can be had without <foreign><hi rend="italic">fash</hi></foreign> [bother];&#x2014;and on the whole the fervour of London, and the beauty of the rural year too are mainly over now. My vote, I rather think, will be the echo of yours, No or Yea.</p>
<p>Ballantyne sends Newspapers and a Letter: Manchester still continues grumbling; has not yet taken to its work at all generally. Peel has certainly no enviable place of it at present!</p>
<p>Evidently you need not hurry home from fear of <hi rend="italic">wearying</hi> your hosts. I know that to be very certain. Neither shall you hurry for us; no, do not; it is not often you take any holiday!&#x2014; As for myself, I feel as if I might as well write today, and say at once No. Except for health&#x2019;s sake what will country do for me? Work will do infinitely more! <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign> my own Jeannie. Be well, come back to me well!</salute></closer></p>

<dateline><place>Chelsea</place>, Saturday [<date when="1842-08-27">27 August 1842</date>]</dateline>
<p><salute>Dearest,&#x2014;</salute>I have reflected that I am a despicable poltroon; that I ought actually to go and try to shake this bilious dust out of me by a little <pb id="pg-15-53" n="15:53"/>walking under the free sky; that I talk always about tours, tours,&#x2014;and that I shall never have a better chance to execute one of them! I have, in consequence, written to Mrs Buller by this post; answering, Yes&#x2014;but the When, Why or How all uncertain; except that <hi rend="italic">you</hi> will probably have to stay a week longer than you counted on. A week longer will do at the utmost; and I am sure enough they will not weary of you: nay, according to another hypothesis (that of the Ipswich Steamer) I can be there on or within the original day: but this I reckon of little moment,&#x2014;unless the cocks and asses be too busy with you again!</p>
<p>I enclose the Ipswich-Steamer bill, procured yesterday in the City: the time of starting is highly inconvenient (no omnibus or Chelsea Steamer running then); one arrives at Ipswich (it is <hi rend="italic">said</hi>) about 4 O&#x2019;clock; a vehicle to Stowmarket, some 14 miles, seems to be not improbable; and then there are 11 miles,&#x2014;which a man with a knapsack might walk on the morrow morning, at worst!&#x2014; But in truth, I do not much affect this Steamer concern: I meditate a land tour, something infinitely greater,&#x2014;if I can keep the steam up! I mean, at any rate, to go and order a new <hi rend="italic">white hat</hi> today; perhaps even to buy a knapsack: have I no audacity, when you stir me up?</p>
<p>&#x201C;Babbie&#x201D; blushes when I proposed the Ipswich Steamer to her, and declines,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; clearly in no inflexible way. Would you really like that she came? I think perhaps hardly and she herself needs it not at all.</p>
<p>Strachey&#x2019;s Note was of this morning.&#x2014; John is to leave Town for Malvern &#x26;c. next week <closer><salute>All well, and loving you, dear Goody!</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Sterling,</salute>
<p>This Letter from Emerson, along with one for myself, has just arrived. Three others, from various hands, for Alcott &#x201C;the Potatoe Quixote,&#x201D; have reached me by the same ship, and been already sent voyaging towards Richmond or some Elsewhere. The Potatoe Quixote and I have come a sheer rupture, after our third interview; on my asking him, &#x201C;when shall I see you again?&#x201D; his answer was, &#x201C;Never, I guess!&#x201D; A worthy man; but one of the absurdest I have ever seen. They tell me Emerson furnishes his expenses to this Country;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC noted in his Journal, <date when="1842-10-25">25 Oct.</date>: &#x201C;an American <hi rend="italic">vegetable</hi> Transcendentalist; a perfect bore; very much of a boor too;&#x2014;who would hardly part from me without quarrelling with me. Emerson had sent him, or else his despatch had been briefer.&#x201D;</note> a very notable fact; significant of several things in the <hi rend="italic">new</hi> country! No unlikelier missionary, since that Quaker that walked off direct to the Pope and told <hi rend="italic">him</hi> the Lord&#x2019;s Message,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-14/lt-18420728-TC-JOST-01">TC to <sic>JS</sic><corr>JOST</corr>, <date when="1842-07-28">28 July</date></ref>.</note> has come athwart my field of vision&#x2014;good and better luck to him!</p>
<p>Your friend Owen the Naturalist came down to me one evening; staid two hours: I returned his call, yesterday with my Brother, and went over his Museum. He is a man of real talent and worth, an extremely rare kind of man. Hardly twice in London have I met with any articulate-speaking biped who told me a thirtieth-part so many things I knew not and wanted to know. It was almost like to make me cry, to hear articulate human speech once more conveying real information to me,&#x2014;not dancing on airy tiptoes, nowhence and nowhither, as the manner of the Cockney dialect is! God&#x2019;s forgiveness to all Cockney &#x201C;men of wit&#x201D;: they know not what death and Gehenna does lurk <pb id="pg-15-56" n="15:56"/>in that laborious inanity of theirs: inane speech, the pretence to be saying something when you really are saying no<hi rend="italic">thing</hi> but only counterfeits of things, is the beginning and basis of all other inanities whatsoever! Wherewith the Earth and England is now sick; almost unto death.&#x2014; Thank Heaven and your stars, I have no more paper at present!</p>
<p>Tomorrow or next day I am off for Mrs Buller&#x2019;s in Suffolk, to bring home my Wife; who has been there about a fortnight; with some improvement, I think. Cannot I run over to Ely, to St Ives, Huntingdon and Hinchinbrooke? Ah, me!</p>
<p>My hurry, however, is so great at present, I took this mere scrap of paper for you; and must now end it. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Sterling; <foreign><hi rend="italic">Vale et me ama</hi></foreign> [Farewell and love me].</salute></closer></p>

<dateline><place>Chelsea, London</place>, <date when="1842-08-29">29 August, 1842</date>&#x2014;</dateline>
<salute>My dear Emerson,</salute>
<p>This morning your new Letter, of the <date when="1842-08-15">15<hi rend="italic">th</hi> August</date>, has arrived; exactly one fortnight old: thanks to the gods and steam-demons! I already, perhaps six weeks ago, answered your former Letter,&#x2014;acknowledging the manna-gift of the &#xa3;51, and other things;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On <date when="1842-07-19">19 July</date> in reply to Emerson&#x2019;s of <date when="1842-07-01">1 July</date>.</note> nor do I think the Letter can have been lost, for I remember putting it into the Post-office myself. Today I am on the eve of an expedition into Suffolk, and full of petty business: however, I will throw you one word,&#x2014;were it only to lighten my own heart a little. You are a kind friend to me, and a precious;&#x2014;and when I mourn over the impotence of Human Speech, and how each of us, speak or write as he will, has to stand <hi rend="italic">dumb</hi>, cased up in his own unutterabilities, before his unutterable Brother, I feel always as if Emerson were the man I could soonest <hi rend="italic">try</hi> to speak with,&#x2014;were I within reach of him! Well; we must be content. A pen is a pen, and worth something; tho&#x2019; it expresses about as much of a <hi rend="italic">man&#x2019;s</hi> meaning perhaps as the stamping of a hoof will express of a horse&#x2019;s meaning; a very poor expression indeed!</p>
<p>Your bibliopolic advice about Cromwell or my next Book<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In the lost letter of <date when="1842-08-15">15 Aug.</date></note> shall be carefully attended, if I live ever to write another Book! But I have again got down into primeval Night; and live alone and mute with the <pb id="pg-15-57" n="15:57"/><foreign><hi rend="italic">Manes</hi></foreign> [Spirits of the dead], as you say; uncertain whether I shall ever more see day. I am partly ashamed of myself; but cannot help it. One of my grand difficulties I suspect to be that I cannot write <hi rend="italic">two Books at once;</hi> cannot be in the seventeenth century and in the nineteenth at one and the same moment; a feat which excels even that of the Irishman&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">bird:</hi> &#x201C;Nobody but a bird can be in two places at once!&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;He regretted he was not a bird, and could not be in two places at once&#x201D; (attr. to Sir Boyle Roche [<date when="1743-00-00">1743</date>&#x2013;<date when="1807-00-00">1807</date>]). TC means that he would have liked to make his book on Cromwell simultaneously bear on the current social crisis; this was soon to be resolved by his first writing <hi rend="italic">Past and Present</hi>.</note> For my heart is sick and sore in behalf of my own poor generation; nay, I feel withal as if the one hope of help for it consisted in the possibility of new Cromwells, and new Puritans: thus do the two centuries stand related to me, the seventeenth <hi rend="italic">worthless</hi> except precisely in so far as it can be made the <hi rend="italic">nineteenth</hi>; and yet let anybody <hi rend="italic">try</hi> that enterprise! Heaven help me.&#x2014; I believe at least that I ought <hi rend="italic">to hold my tongue;</hi>more especially at present.</p>
<p>Thanks for asking me to write you a word in the <hi rend="italic">Dial</hi>. Had such a purpose struck me long ago, there have been things passing thro&#x2019; my head,&#x2014;march-marching as they ever do, in long-drawn scandalous Falstaff-regiments (a man ashamed to be seen passing thro&#x2019; Coventry with such a set!)<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <hi rend="italic">1 Henry IV</hi> 4.2.</note>&#x2014;some one of which, snatched out of the ragged rank, and dressed and drilled a little, might perhaps fitly have been saved from Chaos and sent to the <hi rend="italic">Dial</hi>. In future we shall be on the outlook. I love your Dial, and yet it is with a kind of shudder. You seem to me in danger of dividing yourselves from the Fact of this present universe, in which alone ugly as it is can I find any anchorage, and soaring away after Ideas, Beliefs, Revelations and such like,&#x2014;into perilous altitudes as I think; beyond the curve of perpetual frost, for one thing! I know not how to utter what impression you give me; take the above as some stamping of the fore-hoof. Surely I could wish you <hi rend="italic">returned</hi> into your own poor nineteenth century, its follies and maladies, its blind or half-blind but gigantic toilings, its laughter and its tears, and trying to evolve in some measure the hidden Godlike that lies in <hi rend="italic">it;</hi>&#x2014;that seems to me the kind of feat for literary men. Alas, it is so easy to screw oneself up into high and ever higher altitudes of Transcendentalism, and see nothing under one but the everlasting snows of Himmalayah, the Earth shrinking to a Planet, and the indigo firmament sowing itself with daylight stars; easy for <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, for me: but whither does it lead? I dread always, to inanity and mere injuring of the lungs!&#x2014; &#x201C;Stamp, stamp, stamp!&#x201D;&#x2014; Well, I do believe, for one thing, a <pb id="pg-15-58" n="15:58"/>man has no right to say to his own generation, turning quite away from it, &#x201C;Be damned!&#x201D; It is the whole Past and the whole Future, this same cotton-spinning, dollar-hunting, canting and shrieking, very wretched generation of ours. Come back into it, I tell you;&#x2014;and so for the present will &#x201C;stamp&#x201D; no more.</p>
<p>The good Alcott and I have prospered, I am afraid, almost as ill as it was possible for two honest men kindly affected towards one another to do. How much he understands about me I know not; but what, how much or how little I understand about him, he knows still less. The third time we met, little Browning <foreign><hi rend="italic">Paracelsus</hi></foreign> was here, a neat dainty little fellow, speaking in the Cockney quiz-dialect; to whom poor Alcott&#x2019;s vegetable-diet concern was as ridiculous as it could be to most. They did not prosper together; I walked up to town with them, and still no prosperity: Browning at length went away; and then the exasperated Sage did speak, and when we two came to part, answered my, &#x201C;When shall I see you again?&#x201D; by a solemn &#x201C;Never, I guess!&#x201D; It was really too ridiculous: however, there was no help; and I have not seen him again; nor, as I never could learn his address, does any remedy seem possible. He is a rustic man; ignorant of the life-methods of civilized men, which civilized men have adopted that they may not be intolerable to one another; nor apparently has he the faintest notion to learn them. I told him, &#x201C;All this thing that we saw around us&#x201D; (head of St James&#x2019;s street, with Piccadilly, with England) &#x201C;had been existing now for a matter of two thousand years, not on his behalf at all, but on its own only, and had never heard of him till yesterday: why would he get angry that it did not all at once turn round and shape itself according to his image!&#x201D; In vain: the excellence of the vegetable philosophy, and conquest of the world by a return to acorns and the primeval innocence, seemed so indubitable, that he did think it at least deserved a serious consideration from the oldest St James&#x2019;s Street and Piccadilly:&#x2014; Ah me!</p>
<p>If there be still time, which I doubt there is not, I wish you would tell this good man that my whole heart is kindly affected to him; that I do esteem his Potatoe-gospel a mere imbecillity which <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> be discussed in this busy world at this time of day;&#x2014;but that he ought really to come back to me! That I shall rejoice to see him again; and not bore him, if I can help it, if he will avoid boring me.&#x2014; His Letters, of which there came three this morning, I always instantly put in a track which I know attains him, among some connexions he has at Richmond.&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; &#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; <foreign>Adieu</foreign>, my friend; I must not add a word more. My Wife <supplied>[is]</supplied><note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Omitted in MS.</note> out on a visit; it is to bring her back that I am now setting <pb id="pg-15-59" n="15:59"/>forth for Suffolk. I hope to see Ely too, and St Ives and Huntingdon, and various <hi rend="italic">Cromwelliana</hi>. My blessings on the Concord Household now and always. Command me expressly to your Wife and your Mother. <closer><salute>Farewell, dear friend.</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>My dearest,&#x2014;</salute> Your Ixworth Postmaster, I think, must be a blockhead, and Mrs Buller&#x2019;s Letter, after waiting a day, would come <hi rend="italic">this</hi> morning. I put it into the Post-office along with yours in Fleet street with my own hand. It was addressed Mrs Buller, <hi rend="italic">Troston Rectory</hi> &#x26;c without any Reginald.</p>
<p>On the whole you are right about that knapsack part of the business; especially now that the weather is broken! At all events, I will come to Ixworth <hi rend="italic">first</hi>, and that without delay. I will inquire for the &#x201C;Phenomenon&#x201D;; by it or by some kind of conveyance, I will be with you straightway! I think of <hi rend="italic">Wednesday first</hi> (the day after tomorrow): but we shall see farther, and I will write again.</p>
<p>Poor old Mr Dobbie has just called; back from Southampton, and going off tomorrow. I delivered him all your regards, good old man; I was charged with many to you. He has undertaken to dine with us today at five; and is just gone.&#x2014; &#x2014; Nay at this instant here he is again; begging to change till <hi rend="italic">tomorrow</hi> at half past four! I am sorry you do not see him;&#x2014;and yet perhaps it is but another sadness spared you, my poor woman! We will at least be as kind to him as we possibly can, as you could wish us to be.</p>
<p>This Letter of Emerson&#x2019;s<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1842-08-15">15 Aug.</date>, now lost.</note> came this morning.&#x2014; Darley was with us last night. Reeve had called: John &#x26; I had been out surveying Owen&#x2019;s grand <hi rend="italic">Museum</hi> in Lincoln&#x2019;s Inn Fields for <hi rend="italic">two hours</hi> or better.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-15/lt-18420826-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, [<date when="1842-08-26">26 Aug.</date>]</ref>.</note> I rather think I shall like Owen, and you will like him.&#x2014; There is thunder again! The weather has gone all to smash: it is our &#x201C;Lammas Flood.&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Heavy August rain.</note></p>
<p>On Wednesday night: or perhaps Thursday, you may begin to consider me as <hi rend="italic">due</hi>. Be well and good when I come! And so farewell, <closer><salute>Dearest; my blessings on thee</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Babbie Bunton</salute>
<p>Last night it was the thunder!&#x2014;but, as John says, &#x201C;there is no use at all, you know in rebelling against Providence&#x201D;; so we will make no Jheramiad about having been kept awake by <hi rend="italic">that</hi>&#x2014;it might have thundered anywhere as well as at Troston&#x2014; It looks now to my weather-wisdom, as if the fair weather were broken, and we were to have a spell of wet days&#x2014;which will be sorely against the white hat-and-knapsack-mode of travelling&#x2014; Pray say what you can to repress his youthful enthusiasm, and to point his decision towards the <hi rend="italic">Cornwallis</hi>, or the <hi rend="italic">Phenomenon</hi>&#x2014; These walking-over all-England-schemes are excellent in idea&#x2014;an innocent stimulant to the imagination,&#x2014;but they are not meant to be executed&#x2014;at least by the like of him&#x2014;&#x201C;a long sprawling, ill-put-together thing from the very beginning&#x201D;&#x2014;as his Mother said of him&#x2014;and with a nervous system that renders him peculiarly unfit for being &#x201C;thrown out, <foreign><hi rend="italic">sang froid</hi></foreign>, to charity&#x201D;</p>
<p>We were to have gone to day to lunch at Hardwick two miles beyond Bury&#x2014; where it seems there are to be seen very curious antiquities and beautiful things of Art&#x2014;collected by Sir Thomas and Lady Cullum<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sir Thomas Gery Cullum (<date when="1741-00-00">1741</date>&#x2013;<date when="1831-00-00">1831</date>; <ref target="volume-15/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/6880"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), botanist and surgeon at Bury St. Edmunds; 7th bart., <date when="1785-00-00">1785</date>; m., <date when="1774-00-00">1774</date>, Mary, b. Hanson, heiress of her brother, Sir Lovett Hanson. Hardwick House was owned by his son, the Rev. Sir Thomas Gery Cullum (<date when="1777-00-00">1777</date>&#x2013;<date when="1855-00-00">1855</date>), 8th bart.</note> during their various wanderings abroad&#x2014;but I have no expectation that it will fair in time&#x2014;nor is there any great reason why it should except that had we passed thro Bury I might have provided myself with some writing paper and other small necessaries of life my stock of which has run low&#x2014;</p>
<p>Except Nature and the persons of this household I have seen nothing and nobody since our tea-visit to the Squire&#x2019;s<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Richard Norton Cartwright, at Ixworth Abbey.</note>&#x2014;than which nothing could be a completer failure&#x2014;still I am glad that we went, for it gave me the idea of a new sort of man, and new sort of menage&#x2014;a very detestable sort to be sure&#x2014;but still as God permits Mr Cartwright his <hi rend="italic">Priory</hi> to exist in the same world with me I should not disdain the knowledge thereof&#x2014; I never saw a man that looked more like the pig pushing towards Cork while made to believe itself taken to Killkenny<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Proverbial.</note>&#x2014;a stubborn contradictory brute&#x2014;rapturizing over Sir Robert<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Peel.</note> <pb id="pg-15-61" n="15:61"/>and the income tax&#x2014;finding all the distress of the country to be occasioned by the <hi rend="italic">cheapness</hi> of victuals!! and ready to <hi rend="italic">knock down</hi> any one male or female that dared to be of a different opinion&#x2014; His wife<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Frances Felicia, b. Cobb, m. <date when="1826-00-00">1826</date>. They were first cousins.</note> a most elaborate piece of formality with a very questionable fixture-smile did what she could to keep the peace&#x2014;and suceeded but indifferently&#x2014;and gave us the worst tea and the most meagre supply of butter and bread I remember to have seen in this world on the whole the sight of that Place with its magnificent avenues of cedars and vaulted <hi rend="italic">crypt</hi>, and &#x201C;glorious bits of colour,&#x201D; and worst tea, worst talk, worst taste, to be found in Christendom, was enough to make the humblest peasant contented with his lot&#x2014; N. B. M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Cartwrights eyes are almost close together in his face&#x2014;</p>
<p>I had a long kind letter from Elizabeth<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Pepoli.</note> which I have not yet answered&#x2014;but mean to&#x2014; I am truly thankful that Helens leg is restored to a state of efficiency&#x2014;give her my congratulations&#x2014;and kind regards&#x2014; I hope she will take double and triple care of you when you are left alone&#x2014;unfortunate Babbie&#x2014;what is to become of you? but it will not be for long&#x2014;mind above all things that you take your victuals properly&#x2014;one is so apt to neglect that department of things when one is alone&#x2014;and if virtue lies as most people seem to believe in the stomach, the consequence would be a demoralized babbie at my return&#x2014; Thank you for all your interesting letters to which this is rather a poor return&#x2014;but I am in a sort of uncertainty today as to things in general very unfavourable for letter writing  bless you&#x2014;my good child</p>

<p><salute>Dear Jeankin,&#x2014;</salute> The Phenomenon Coach costs 20 shillings inside, 10 outside, and starts from the Regent&#x2019;s Circus <hi rend="italic">at six in the morning</hi>, arriving at Bury about 3:&#x2014;it, therefore, will <hi rend="italic">not</hi> do. We must stick by the Cornwallis. Tomorrow, with the good Mr Dobbie and <hi rend="italic">etceteras</hi> tonight, I shall hardly be in readiness: but I do aim towards Thursday; and if you hear no farther tomorrow, I may be expected accordingly, on Thursday,&#x2014;about 4 o&#x2019;clock, I think you said? Mr Buller or Reginald can perhaps meet me; but, in any case, I shall get along some way or other.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-15-62" n="15:62"/>Our weather is quite broken; the &#x201C;Lammas Flood,&#x201D; as they call it in Scotland. Yesterday, after the thundering as I announced was begun, I had to go for Pimlico with the Letters, four o&#x2019;clock having just struck here: I got along by means of the umbrella, and occasional shelter under penthouses, tolerably well till near the Hospital<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Chelsea Hospital, designed by Christopher Wren, <date when="1692-00-00">1692</date>, rebuilt by Robert Adam, <date when="1765-00-00">1765</date>&#x2013;<date when="1782-00-00">82</date>, and housing 420 military pensioners.</note> on my return: there, however, I wisely took refuge under the inner colonnade, and sat three quarters of an hour, witnessing one of the beautifullest rain-deluges ever seen. The rain did not <hi rend="italic">cease</hi> for a couple of hours after; but I got home nearly dry. The streets at night were washed, the middle of Piccadilly as clean as a kitchen-floor; and ever since we have a soaking dampness, which the Ditmarsh swamps<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dithmarschen swamps in Schleswig-Holstein between the Elbe and Eider rivers.</note> could hardly match; a very villainous kind of weather too;&#x2014;as indeed which kind is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> villainous for a poor Devil that has nerves!&#x2014; My white hat is come; but in these circumstances except on the outside of the coach I do not mean to use it: walking shall stand over till I see Troston at any rate. Meanwhile, if you have any opportunity, you can be inquiring, What conveyances there are, into Huntingdonshire? Who knows anybody at Ely, at St Ives, Huntingdon? Ely seems to be some 28 miles from you; the rest all in a line: I must actually get a view of these three places; the very fields that Oliver tilled will be lying there, the very mud-ditches he first opened his eyes upon in God&#x2019;s creation: in the all but total absence of true knowledge about him, it will be a kind of comfort to look on all that, to know verily that <hi rend="italic">it</hi> is all a fact indisputable. Nay I <hi rend="italic">can</hi> walk over that country, with no luggage but in my pocket, and be back at Troston again in two days.</p>
<p>What a blessing that I escaped your Squire<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cartwright.</note> with the strait eyes! My fingers itch even here to have the horsewhipping of him;&#x2014;and yet let him live; only <hi rend="italic">far apart:</hi> God is great, and makes (not only suffers but makes) strait-eyed Corn-law Squires!</p>
<p>We took of course no notice of the Macready Note; which seems to answer itself by no-answer. It came last night. Strachey&#x2019;s little epistle is of this morning: his gig would have been welcomer some other day than the present: but we must submit to the allotments of Destiny even in gigs. I suppose we should be making up our minds as to Clifton;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >To stay at Mrs. Strachey&#x2019;s house while she was away.</note> or rather you should be making yours, for I want that as the preliminary.</p>
<p>Perhaps tomorrow also there may be time for some Note of hand: <pb id="pg-15-63" n="15:63"/>if none, you already know Thursday. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Gehab&#x2019; Dich wohl, mein Liebchen</hi></foreign> [Be well, my dear little one]. I am in a fluttery uncomfortable state today; but what can one help it? <closer><salute>Thine always, with blessings.</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>My dearest,&#x2014;</salute> I adhere to tomorrow and the <hi rend="italic">Cornwallis;</hi> there is nothing more to be said.</p>
<p>Good old Dobbie was very cheery with us last night: he is away today; perhaps at Birmingham by this time. The sight of him made us <foreign><hi rend="italic">wae, wae;</hi></foreign> and yet there was a kind of satisfaction in it which I wish you had partaken of. My poor little Jeannie!</p>
<p>John came in to join us; to take leave of me, for they go off on Saturday. A little before that, Darwin drove up! I had heard of him at Strachey&#x2019;s, from John, who happened to be there; and also that perhaps he was coming down. He looks brisk &#x26; well; altogether glad to have got back to London again. He has been sitting in his arbour at Shrewsbury all this while. Harriet he did not think quite so well; her main occupation &#x201C;writing letters.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Mrs Balfour<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Clara Lucas Balfour, who, according to the <ref target="volume-15/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/1183"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>, had moved from Chelsea to Maida Hill some time in <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>. &#x201C;Thumbikins&#x201D; not explained.</note> who brought that Note and a scrubby pair of <hi rend="italic">thumbikins</hi> just now, did not come up stairs; will call about the end of next week, when she hopes to see you.&#x2014; Today the weather is cool enough: I have had to get poor Babbie a fire. I myself am in a dressing-gown; too long here!</p>
<p>Did you understand that John Donaldson is Master of Bury School?<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John William Donaldson (<date when="1811-00-00">1811</date>&#x2013;<date when="1861-00-00">61</date>; <ref target="volume-15/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/7803"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), headmaster of King Edward&#x2019;s School, Bury St. Edmunds, <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>&#x2013;<date when="1855-00-00">55</date>; author of <hi rend="italic">The New Cratylus</hi> (Cambridge, <date when="1839-00-00">1839</date>), a treatise on Greek philology; a native of Haddington, where his grandfather had been town clerk; see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18351026-JWC-TC-01"><sic>8:246</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1835-10-26">26 Oct. 1835</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-10/lt-18381217-TC-JWD-01"><sic>10:244</sic><corr>TC to JWD, <date when="1838-12-17">17 Dec. 1838</date></corr></ref>.</note> I would spend a few minutes seeing him if occasion served: some knowledge might lie in him about Ely &#x26;c.

<p>I write you just one word of blessing in your loneliness&#x2014;and if it were not for the thought of your loneliness I could not muster faculty enough today to send you even that much&#x2014; It is raining&#x2014;and searchingly cold&#x2014;and I have not slept&#x2014;and am otherwise unwell&#x2014;and there is no fire in the whole house except in the kitchen&#x2014;where it is not very pleasant to warm oneself in the midst of four or five servants&#x2014;nevertheless I have been to the kitchen fire once this morning and must go again soon&#x2014;or die&#x2014; Why <hi rend="italic">would</hi> Carlyle put off and off until the weather broke entirely? but for his coming I should have been back today and had the prospect of a good fire, at least tomorrow&#x2014; And why do not people above all in country houses put on fires at the shortest notice&#x2014; I meant to have gone with M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Buller to meet Carlyle at Bury&#x2014;but unless it fairs it were a wrong measure quite knocked up as I feel myself. I shall go in quest of Regy for the present and see whether I cannot put it into <hi rend="italic">his</hi> head&#x2014;as John puts things into M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Oglivies&#x2014;to have a fire in his study&#x2014;since M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Buller does not like it in the drawing room&#x2014;it makes it she says &#x201C;so insufferably close&#x201D;&#x2014; Pardon me today Babbie&#x2014; for I am really sadly out of sorts&#x2014;worse than I have been any day since I left you</p>

<salute>Dear Sterling,</salute>
<p>In this sacerdotal City my thoughts revert to you; and from the Bagmen&#x2019;s room of the White Hart Inn, I employ Rowland Hill<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The penny post.</note> to convey a word from me. On the opposite side of my table, scribbles and counts assiduously a Norwich Bagman (happily in total silence otherwise); I have ridden all day, and walked all evening: you cannot expect much coherency in what I say.</p>
<p>Your Letter found me at Reginald Buller&#x2019;s Parsonage of Troston in Suffolk; whither I had followed my wife; whence I departed this morning, on a pilgrimage to Cromwell-land,&#x2014;successful thus far. My paths thro&#x2019; the whole forenoon, indeed all the way to Soham,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Village 6&#xBD; mi. SE of Ely.</note> were utterly complex; my Syntax-steed is of the completest Rosinante species:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Don Quixote&#x2019;s bony and blemished horse. William Combe (<date when="1742-00-00">1742</date>&#x2013;<date when="1823-00-00">1823</date>) wrote three <hi rend="italic">Tours of Dr. Syntax</hi> in verse (<date when="1809-00-00">1809</date>&#x2013;<date when="1811-00-00">11</date>, <date when="1820-00-00">1820</date>, and <date when="1821-00-00">1821</date>).</note> nevertheless we plodded along thro&#x2019; boundless flat cornfields of reclaimed bog; and in the yellow evening sunshine, a little after five, got landed at the foot of the Cathedral, which had hung venerable <pb id="pg-15-68" n="15:68"/>and majestic in the air all along for some five miles before. Ely has veritably once been an <hi rend="italic">Isle</hi>, at least in winter time; a kind of chalk or limy sandstone hill, of no considerable height, rising amid the infinite of swamps, and very conspicuous now with its noble Pile on the crown of it,&#x2014;one of the most impressive buildings I have ever in my life seen.</p>
<p>I ran over even before tea; and got admittance, happily in total solitude: some agencies, supposed to be human, were blowing the organ, making it discourse deep solemn music; a poor little sparrow was fluttering far aloft in the topmost windows of the lantern (top of the main tower, which is almost all of glass); this sparrow, and a poor country lad, who had plucked up courage to follow on seeing me enter,&#x2014;were my only fellow worshippers. I declare it were a good arrangement, if they would but keep the music going, in all such places, and sweep away the rest of the living lumber; and leave one alone in these enormous towering spaces, with one&#x2019;s own thoughts and the spirits of the Dead! I believe this Ely Cathedral is one of the &#x201C;finest,&#x201D; as they call it, in all England, and from me also few masses of architecture could win more admiration; but I recoil everywhere from treating these things as a <hi rend="italic">dilettantism</hi> at all; the impressions they give me are too deep and sad to have anything to do with the shape of stones. Tonight, as the heaving bellows blew, and the yellow sunshine streamed in thro&#x2019; those high windows, and my footfalls and the poor country lad&#x2019;s were the only sounds from below, I looked aloft, and my eyes filled with very tears to look at all this, and remember beside it (wedded to it now, and <hi rend="italic">reconciled</hi> with it for me) Oliver Cromwell&#x2019;s, &#x201C;Cease your fooling, and come out, sir!&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <hi rend="italic">Cromwell, Works</hi> 6:179.</note> In these two antagonisms lie what volumes of meaning!&#x2014;</p>
<p>But to quit the sentimental and vague (in spite of Bagmen), know, dear Sterling, that I have clearly discerned the very House where my Friend Oliver dwelt and boiled his kettle some two hundred and two years ago; nay half an hour ago I actually sat and smoked a pipe upon <hi rend="italic">his</hi> Horse block, the very stone, which still lies at the entrance to the stables, split in two and shoved a little aside to make room for a piece of pavement, but left lying as too unmanageable still for removal, in a place so stagnant as Ely! I think there are few better pilgrimages left possible for a man at present. Oliver&#x2019;s House stands close by St Mary&#x2019;s Churchyard; a mean shrunk-looking aged house, with &#x201C;the biggest <hi rend="italic">tithe-barn</hi> except one in all England&#x201D;: the Mr Page who occupied it in Noble&#x2019;s time died only two years ago; a new arrangement has been made about Cathedral tithes, and <pb id="pg-15-69" n="15:69"/>the Oliver House now stands vacant, not like ever to be occupied again, and will soon probably vanish from the Earth.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <hi rend="italic">Cromwell, Works</hi> 6:94&#x2013;95. For Mark Noble (<date when="1754-00-00">1754</date>&#x2013;<date when="1827-00-00">1827</date>), biographer, see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400917-TC-JF-01"><sic>12:261</sic><corr>TC to JF, <date when="1840-09-17">17 Sept. 1840</date></corr></ref>.</note> Could you persuade no Cambridge acquaintance who sketches to go up and take a portrait of it while there is yet time? Really it were well worth while. Soon, soon, or else never!</p>
<p>Tomorrow early I go for St Ives, for Huntingdon, and if possible Cambridge; next day I go homewards (Trostonwards) by Newmarket; may probably get as far as Bury St Edmunds where there is a man I know.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John William Donaldson.</note> About Monday next we return to Chelsea. How many guineas would I give to have Sterling beside me even now! Alas,&#x2014;and I sit among Bagmen and sinners of the Earth: one never can get Sterling.&#x2014; Well, good night any way, my much loved Friend; much loved, tho&#x2019; ever-quarrelled with, and indeed deserving dreadful hatred now and then! These accursed Bagmen have actually driven the wits out of my head, and I add no word more <closer><salute>Yours ever &#x26; ever</salute></closer></p>
<name>T. Carlyle</name>
<ps><p>Your Letter followed me to Troston,&#x2014;thanks for it. A small Note of mine, accompanying a Letter from Emerson for you, had crossed it, I think, on the road.&#x2014; My first <hi rend="italic">still</hi> Bagman has rolled off, and a new noisier one has rolled in. I will out for another view of Oliver&#x2019;s Ghost, and then to bed. <foreign>Adieu</foreign>.</p></ps>

He seems a man of modest character, of small knowledge, and not of great diligence. None of the Letters dwell at all vividly with me,&#x2014;some scenes of Poyntz&#x2019;s<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sydenham Poyntz (fl. <date when="1645-00-00">1645</date>&#x2013;<date when="1650-00-00">50</date>), gen. in the civil wars; finally settled in Virginia.</note> about <pb id="pg-15-70" n="15:70"/>Pontefract<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Or Pomfret Castle, Yorkshire, beseiged by Cromwell, <date when="1648-11-00">Nov. 1648</date>; surrendered, <date when="1649-03-00">March 1649</date>.</note> are among the least misty: but alas the whole Book, Poyntz and all, is fast melting away into the general dim steamy immemorab<supplied>[il]</supplied>ity,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letters omitted in MS.</note> which swallows nearly all my reading in that quarter,&#x2014;announcing indeed too plainly that it is a quarter of which <hi rend="small-caps">Oblivion</hi> has taken legal seisin, which no man should or can contest with the almighty genius of <hi rend="small-caps">Oblivion</hi>, but let <hi rend="italic">him</hi> have it with a blessing! He is gaping for us all, the scoundrel; no star of us but he will quench one day, and absorb in the quietest manner into his general steam-element;&#x2014;many thanks to him, on the whole!</p>
<p>Today I am in the Cambridge Fens; a most delectable position in such weather. The gods alone know whether any Cromwell will ever be got out of me. The secret of him lies deep and ever deeper; deep in the foundations of the world. The man is not a <hi rend="italic">quack;</hi> he rather seems to me a <hi rend="italic">god:</hi> but how shall I ever convince <hi rend="italic">you</hi> of that!</p>
<p>My Wife notes along with me that we leave you to fix the day next week yourself, and a <hi rend="italic">legitimate dramar</hi> at the end of it. She is answering for herself; promising, I doubt not, to execute your commissions with impeccable correctness.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly <ref target="volume-14/lt-18420119-JWC-JF-01">JWC to JF, [<date when="1842-01-19">19 Jan.</date>]</ref>.</note></p>

<salute>Dearest Babbie</salute>
<p>It was not headach that prevented my writing to you yesterday, and still less was it oblivion&#x2014;it was a combination of petty <foreign>contretemps</foreign> which cheated you out of your letter&#x2014; I sat down to write immediately after breakfast, but when the pen was in my hand the first words it traced, from some <hi rend="small-caps">mysterious</hi> and sudden movement, were not &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">dearest Babbie</hi>&#x201D;&#x2014;but &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">dear cousin</hi>&#x201D;&#x2014;and I found myself, without the smallest forethought, writing first to James Baillie&#x2014; In that there was no harm; as he asked me for neither help nor commiseration, nor for any thing I <hi rend="italic">could</hi> not give him, it was but common humanity to fling him the civil word he <hi rend="italic">did</hi> ask for&#x2014;in answer to his question how I did&#x2014; But having told him with cold brevity <pb id="pg-15-71" n="15:71"/>where I was and how <hi rend="italic">I</hi> was, something inspired me, instead of &#x2018;remaining his obedient humble servant&#x2019; to personate Minerva for the time being&#x2014;and to write him four mortal pages of passionate remonstrance against the folly&#x2014;not to say infamy&#x2014;of his past and present course of life!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lt. James Baillie, JWC&#x2019;s cousin; see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400715-TC-MAC-01"><sic>12:196</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1840-07-15">15 July 1840</date></corr></ref>; a bankrupt dandy living, unmarried, with a woman for the sake of her money.

<p>My little sermon was so very impressive, that it made <hi rend="italic">myself</hi> cry when I read it over&#x2014;but I am afraid it would have no such salutary result for <hi rend="italic">him</hi>. &#x201C;at all events,&#x201D; said Carlyle &#x201C;it could <hi rend="italic">do him no ill&#x201D;</hi>&#x2014; That don-Quixote-like speculation accomplished; I started again, &#x201C;dearest Babbie,&#x201D;&#x2014;when Carlyle <hi rend="italic">knocked</hi> at my door&#x2014;would I go with him to the village to &#x201C;help him to buy a box of matches and a penny-worth of pipes&#x201D;?&#x2014;so modest a petition could not be refused by any body with christian bowels&#x2014;so to the village we went and made the small purchases&#x2014; Again I sat down to write&#x2014;to &#x201C;dearest Babbie&#x201D; were added another pair of words, when the man servant proclaimed outside my door that &#x201C;lunch was on the table&#x201D; and Regy insinuated the same fact the same moment, outside my window&#x2014; Carlyle has overset all our household arrangements here as he oversets all household arrangements wherever he goes&#x2014; Here were we eating lunch, and dining at six! that we might go to Bury <hi rend="italic">before dinner</hi> to inquire about coaches to&#x2014;St Ives &#x26;c&#x2014; Lunch eaten with more or less appetite I was hurrying up stairs to proceed with my letter having still half an hour before the time at which the carriage was ordered when Mr Buller called after me&#x2014; &#x201C;You will not object to calling on Lady Agnes<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Byng.</note> on the way&#x201D;?&#x2014;Lady Agnes! and I in my wearing gown!&#x2014;absolutely <hi rend="italic">fringed</hi> round the skirt with <hi rend="italic">rags</hi>&#x2014;as no woman unless lost to all sense of shame would like to present herself to a be-satined and be-diamonded Lady Agnes!&#x2014; I had to run and strip and reclothe myself with the speed of a house on fire&#x2014;and had just time left to make up the newspaper&#x2014; Nay, after all I went&#x2014;as I only discovered this morning&#x2014;with two stockings of <hi rend="italic">different</hi> sorts! And thus had the poor solitary Babbichen no letter written to her that day&#x2014;only many kind and somewhat remorseful thoughts wafted to her over space!</p>
<p>This morning the Great Traveller breakfasted alone with me at eight oclock and immediately after set off on a horse which M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Buller who is like <hi rend="italic">the beautiful Lady of fairy</hi> tales had as it were &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">stamped out of the ground</hi>&#x201D; for him! He felt he said &#x201C;like a man setting out on some great commercial speculation by which he hoped <pb id="pg-15-72" n="15:72"/>to make his fortune; yet full of apprehensions and an invincible repugnance&#x201D;!! It is not <hi rend="italic">battle fields</hi> that he is hunting out after all!&#x2014;at Huntingdon&#x2014;Oliver Cromwell was born&#x2014;at St Ives he had a farm&#x2014;and at Ely he was elected Member of Parliament&#x2014;I tell you this that you may not, as M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Buller and I have been doing, perplex people&#x2019;s historical reminicences by talking of M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyles being gone to visit certain battlefields of Oliver Cromwell&#x2019;s in Suffolk&#x2014;where no shadow of a battle ever &#x201C;transpired&#x201D;!&#x2014;his luggage consisted of a razor and two shirt collars!&#x2014; He calculates on being back <hi rend="italic">by possibly</hi> on Thursday&#x2014;more probably not till Friday&#x2014;when certainly he <hi rend="italic">ought</hi> to be here, having invited &#x201C;the new Cratylus&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John William Donaldson.</note> to dinner <hi rend="italic">at six!</hi> no great treat for the rest of us! &#x201C;And when are we to go back to London I asked&#x201D;? with a sympathetic sigh to my Babbie&#x2014;&#x201C;On Saturday if you like&#x201D;! That I am afraid will never be <hi rend="italic">listened to</hi>&#x2014;seeing that he has done nothing here as yet except throw all our still regularity into hubbub wild. Besides Charles will be come before his return and he must in common decency stay at least one day for <hi rend="italic">him</hi>&#x2014; But the beginning of next week I do hope to get back&#x2014;altho I forsee great pressing on the part of all here and great <hi rend="italic">indecision on his part</hi> which will throw all the <foreign><hi rend="italic">odium</hi></foreign> of an unpersuadable resolution on <hi rend="italic">me</hi></p>

<p><salute><hi rend="small-caps">My dear Mother</hi>,&#x2014;</salute>I am sitting here in the &#x201C;Hoop Inn&#x201D; of Cambridge, in a spacious apartment, blazing with gaslight and nearly solitary. It strikes me I may as well employ the hour before bedtime in writing a word for my good Mother,&#x2014;to explain to her how I am, and above all what in the world I am doing here! There is a magnificent thunderstorm just going on, or rather beginning to pass off in copious floods of rain, and there is no other sound audible in this room; one single fellow-traveller lies reading the Times Newspaper on the sofa opposite, and the rain quenches even the sound of his breath.</p>
<p>Well, dear Mother, you heard that Jane was gone into Suffolk to Mrs. Buller&#x2019;s, and perhaps you understand or guess that she continues still there; nay, perhaps Jack may have informed you that on Thursday last (a week ago all but a day) I, after long higgling, set out to bring her home. Home, however, she was not to go quite so fast. Mrs. Buller, rather lively up in that region, wanted her to stay a little longer, wanted me also, I suppose, to go flaunting about, calling on Lady this and Sir Henry that, and <hi rend="italic">lionizing</hi> and amusing myself as I best might in her neighbourhood. She is very kind indeed,&#x2014;more hospitable and good than I have almost ever seen her to anybody. The place Troston is a quiet, sleek, green place, so intersected with green, wide lanes (loanings) all overgrown with trees that you can hardly find your way in it,&#x2014;like walking in some coal-mine in paths underground; it or any green country whatever, as you know, is likely to be welcome to me. One day I walked off to a place called Thetford in Norfolk, about 8 miles from us. It was the morrow after my arrival, and I did not know the nature of the lanes then. I lost my way both going and coming, and made the distance 12 or 13 each way, but got home in time to dinner, and was all the better for my walk. Afterwards I never ventured out of sight of Troston Church-tower without first <hi rend="italic">drawing for myself a little map</hi> of my route from a big map that hangs in the lobby. With my little map in my waistcoat pocket I feared nothing, and indeed in three days knew all the outs and ins of the country;&#x2014;for Mrs. Buller in that interval had contrived <hi rend="italic">to borrow me a farmer&#x2019;s horse</hi> to go about on. Was not that a friendly office to a man like me?</p>
<p>But to hasten to the point! Mrs. Buller&#x2019;s, I knew beforehand, was <pb id="pg-15-74" n="15:74"/>but some 30 miles to the east of Cromwell&#x2019;s country; his birthplace,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Huntingdon; see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 6:23&#x2013;24.</note> the farm he had first, and the farm he had second, all lie adjoining on the Westward, either in the next County, which is this (Cambridgeshire), or in Huntingdonshire, the one Westward of this. Accordingly, having talked a long enough time about jaunts and pilgrimages,&#x2014;about it and about it,&#x2014;I decided at last (the women threatening to laugh at me if I did not go) on actually setting off, and accordingly here I am, with my face already homewards, the main part of my little errand successfully accomplished; and a &#x201C;riding tour&#x201D; through the country parts of England, which I have been talking of these dozen years or more, has actually taken effect on the small scale,&#x2014;a very <hi rend="italic">small</hi> scale indeed. I have ridden but two days, and on the morrow evening I shall be at Troston again, or near it. My conveyance being the farmer&#x2019;s horse above mentioned, my fatigue has been great;&#x2014;for it is the roughest and dourest beast nearly that I ever rode, and today in the morning, to mend matters, it took to the trick they call &#x201C;scouring,&#x201D;&#x2014;in a sullen, windless ninny <foreign><hi rend="italic">niawing</hi></foreign>.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Scouring&#x201D; may mean &#x201C;rushing about&#x201D;; &#x201C;ninny <hi rend="italic">niawing</hi>,&#x201D; wheezing.</note>&#x2014; Many a time I thought of Alick and Jamie in these Cambridge Fens, and wished one or both of them had been near me. But I let the creature take time (for it <hi rend="italic">would</hi> have it), and it gradually recruited again, though not brilliant at the best; and indeed I shall be very willing to wish it good-bye to-morrow evening, were I at Troston again. Poor brute, <hi rend="italic">it</hi> cannot help being <foreign>supple</foreign> [cunning or limp] and riding as with <foreign>stithy-clogs</foreign><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Copeland mistakenly reads &#x201C;stilky-clogs&#x201D;; a stithy clog is the block of wood on which an anvil is set.</note> at its feet! It has eaten four and a half feeds of corn to-day, or I think it would altogether have failed.</p>
<p>But at any rate I have <hi rend="italic">seen</hi> the Cromwell country, got an image of it in my mind for all time henceforth. I was last night at Ely, the Bishop&#x2019;s City of this district. I walked in and about the Cathedral for two good hours. Thought vividly of Cromwell stepping up these floors, with his sword by his side, bidding the Priest (who would not obey his <hi rend="italic">first</hi> order, but continued reading his liturgies), &#x201C;Cease your fooling and come out, Sir.&#x201D;&#x2014; One can fancy with what a <foreign><hi rend="italic">gollie</hi></foreign> [roaring] in the voice of him. I found the very house he had lived in. I sat and smoked a pipe about nine o&#x2019;clock under the stars on the very &#x201C;Horseblock&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">louping-on stone</hi>)<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Copeland reads &#x201C;harping-on,&#x201D; but see <ref target="volume-15/lt-18420909-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1842-09-09">9 Sept.</date></ref></note> which Oliver had often mounted from, two hundred years ago. It was all full of interest, <pb id="pg-15-75" n="15:75"/>and though I could get but very little sleep at night, I did not grudge that price. To-day I rode still farther Westward to a place called St. Ives, where Oliver first took to farming. The house they showed as his I did not believe in, but the fields that he tilled and reaped are veritably there.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 6:85&#x2013;88.</note> I sat down under the shade of one of his hedges and kindled a cigar, not without reflections! I have also seen his native town Huntingdon, with many other things to-day, and am here now on my way homeward, as I said, and will not trouble my dear good Mother with one other word of babblement on the subject at present. No country <hi rend="italic">in itself</hi> can well be uglier; it is all a drained immensity of fen (or soft peat moss), and bears a considerable resemblance to the trench at Dumfries,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lochar Moss, 10 mi. by 3 mi. SE of Dumfries.</note>&#x2014;if that were some 30 or 40 miles square, with Parish churches innumerable, all built on dry knolls of chalky earth that rise up like islands. You can tell Jamie that it bears <hi rend="italic">heavy</hi> crops! oats, beans, wheat, which they are just concluding the leading in of at present; the rest of the country being done a week or two ago.</p>
<p>Dear Mother, was there ever such a clatter of a letter written? And not one word of news, not one word even of the many hundred I could use in inquiring! We return to Chelsea, I expect, about Monday <hi rend="italic">first</hi>. Saturday was to be proposed, but will not stand I believe. Jack is already gone, on Saturday last, to Cheltenham, and then for North Wales. Right glad am I for him and for you that he is to come into Annandale for a little while. Poor fellow, it is long since he has been there, and he too has his own feelings and straits which he does not speak about often. My dear Mother, I will bid you all good-night. I send you my heart&#x2019;s best blessing o&#x2019;er all the hills and rivers that lie between us to-night. The thunder is gone, and the rain. I will send you a little word when we get to Chelsea; perhaps there is something from yourself for me already forwarded to Troston. I doubt it. Good-night, my dear true Mother.</p>

<p><salute>What have I to tell you since yesterday?</salute> Absolutely nothing, dear Babe, except that this morning I had a long very interesting letter from&#x2014;yourself! Yes I may add that I slept last night from twelve till six <hi rend="italic">without awaking</hi>, a fact at which I felt almost <hi rend="italic">frightened!</hi> No word of Carlyle&#x2014; I suppose he will not have opportunity of writing&#x2014;and so we shall have a fine <hi rend="italic">deluge</hi> of spoken autobiography when he comes! surpassing even the voyage to Ghent!</p>
<p>We are rather <hi rend="italic">excited</hi> here to day from the anticipated arrival of Mr Charles&#x2014;Mr Buller is just going off to fetch him but none of us can accompany him for a drive &#x201C;Charles brings such a quantity of luggage and a valet over and above&#x201D;</p>
<p>I hope in heaven that Helen has not only <hi rend="italic">washed</hi> the clothes but succeeded in getting them to look decent&#x2014;pray do <hi rend="italic">you</hi> take a look at them and if there are any bad things make her do them over again while she has le<supplied>[i]</supplied>sure<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC omits letter.</note> for it&#x2014;the <hi rend="italic">collars</hi> which Carlyle brought with him were perfectly shocking all smeared with blue and as souple as grey paper.</p>

I know however that there are very many entirely respectable gentle women in this world to whose company nevertheless, one would prefer the Silence of La Trappe!&#x2014; So I leave you to &#x201C;consult your sensations&#x201D;&#x2014;relying upon it that you <hi rend="italic">will</hi> consult these exclusively&#x2014;without hampering yourself with any <hi rend="italic">imaginating</hi> of what you <hi rend="italic">ought</hi> to do, as a young woman unexpectedly finding herself the mistress of a small menage!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I do not remember when I have been more angry at a thing I had so little business with as yesterday; when M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Buller returned from Bury cold, weariest, sad-looking and with no Charles! Had it been the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> disappointment he had given them, I should have concluded at once that he had missed the coach, and been as sorry for him as for his Parents&#x2014;but he has been doing nothing but disappointing them ever since I came here&#x2014; He was to have come when Parliament rose,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1842-08-12">12 Aug.</date></note> and he went instead to &#x201C;Lady Harriet&#x2019;s&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >At Addiscombe, Surrey.</note>&#x2014; As if he had not flirted with <hi rend="italic">her</hi> the whole season thro&#x2019;!&#x2014; Then he went to Havre &#x201C;to be near the sea&#x201D;!&#x2014;what on earth could be the benefit of <hi rend="italic">the sea</hi> to a political town-wit and <hi rend="italic">diner-out</hi> like Mr C. Buller? Then he would surely come at last!&#x2014;but no&#x2014;not yet&#x2014;off to the Lady Harriet&#x2019;s again&#x2014;then he finally fixed Tuesday&#x2014;then some Thompson or Johnson asked him to dinner and he changed the day to Wednesday; and of his Wednesday&#x2019;s appointment <hi rend="italic">this</hi> was the result! All this time his poor Father &#x26; Mother have tried to pretend indifference, declaring they knew him too well now, to <hi rend="italic">care</hi> when he came, or whether he came at all&#x2014;but every day they have been plainly sickening with &#x201C;hope deferred&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Prov. 13:12.</note>&#x2014;and yesterday when there had been a sort of slaying of the fatted calf<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Luke 15:23.</note>&#x2014;where every body had been at work all Morning to have things in apple-pie order for him&#x2014; <pb id="pg-15-78" n="15:78"/>when his Mother had put on her most becoming cap and gown&#x2014;and his old father had gone off all smiles to fetch him&#x2014;and he did not come after all, I declare I could not help crying for the poor parents of this <hi rend="italic">distinguished</hi> son!&#x2014;and a little too for the son himself, in thinking what a store of remorseful remembrances he was laying up for himself in after years&#x2014;when he would not be able to buy back with all his blood one single hour of those caresses to which he was now prefering the poor frivolities of <hi rend="italic">flirtations</hi> and <hi rend="italic">fine dinners!</hi> Oh mercy if we could but, <hi rend="italic">all of us</hi>, see the present thro the future!&#x2014;if we could but give to it the significance which the future will give to it, when it has for ever escaped from among our hands! how differently would we live with those we love! But never was there a truer saying than that &#x201C;we only recognize our blessings when we have lost them&#x201D; and if sad experience makes us sensible of this fatal tendency of our nature; what we do, is to bewail the evil that has <hi rend="italic">already</hi> resulted from it, rather than to prevent future evil by striving with all our soul and strength to recognize whatever blessings we still <hi rend="italic">have!</hi>&#x2014; You may be sure I <hi rend="italic">exerted</hi> myself to help them away with their dull evening!
From a sudden impulse I put my arm round M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Bullers neck and kissed her&#x2014; &#x201C;O&#x201D; said she with <hi rend="small-caps">tears in her eyes</hi>, &#x201C;I am not disturbing myself&#x2014;I am merely sorry that M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Buller had the long drive to no purpose!&#x201D;&#x2014; &#x201C;A well&#x201D; said the poor Father as we sat down to an unusually lavish dinner&#x2014;&#x201C;the fatted calf you see, M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle! but <hi rend="italic">no</hi> Charles!&#x201D; &#x201C;My dear&#x201D; said his wife kindly, &#x201C;I thought you had grown <hi rend="italic">philosophical</hi> about Charles&#x2014;as <hi rend="italic">I am?</hi>&#x201D; &#x201C;O hang it!&#x201D; says he so I am; but I dislike going to fetch anyone and having to come back without my errand; <hi rend="italic">suppose it were only a pointer&#x201D;!</hi>&#x2014; &#x201C;Well,&#x201D; said she with one of her lovely smiles, &#x201C;you <hi rend="italic">may</hi> be provoked today&#x2014;for you have been cheated of <hi rend="small-caps">both</hi> <hi rend="italic">a pointer</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Charles</hi>&#x201D;&#x2014; She has been ransacking all Suffolk this week back for a dog for Charley to shoot with&#x2014;and one was to have been sent in the carriage&#x2014;but had not been procurable&#x2014; I recommended to him Carlyles remedy for all ills&#x2014;a tumbler of hot brandy negus!&#x2014;which he at last agreed to take, on my declaring I wanted some myself&#x2014;and instead of one we played <hi rend="italic">three</hi> games at Chess!&#x2014; M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Buller and Regy went to bed at ten&#x2014;Mr Buller and myself at eleven when the chess was finished&#x2014; About twelve I was just falling asleep when a horse in the park under my window began to neigh with all its might&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">&#x201C;The devil fly away with you&#x201D;!</hi> thought I&#x2014;then there was a loud rumbling&#x2014;&#x201C;more thunder&#x201D; thought I&#x2014;then there was a great opening and shutting of doors&#x2014;and finally something in creaking boots entered the room adjoining mine&#x2014; It must be Charles I said <pb id="pg-15-79" n="15:79"/>to myself now broad awake&#x2014;and so it was&#x2014; He had been <hi rend="italic">too late</hi> for the Bury coach&#x2014;had come by the one to Newmarket and so, on in a post chaise&#x2014;</p>
<p>I was glad at his arrival tho it <hi rend="italic">did</hi> cost me half my nights sleep&#x2014; Today all faces have a look of sunshiny gladness&#x2014;only Mr Charles&#x2019;s face I have not yet seen&#x2014; I had breakfasted with Mr Buller before he came down&#x2014;and have kept in my room ever since&#x2014;tho it is now one oclock&#x2014;in a sort of spirit of reaction against the extravagant homage which he is used to receive from all people, especially women&#x2014;</p>
<p>That <hi rend="italic">black</hi> letter<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A black-bordered letter indicating mourning.</note> frightened me so that I opened it without observing the postmark&#x2014;otherwise I should have spared myself the sight of documents from Thornhill.

<p><salute>Now;</salute> was it not provoking when I had done <hi rend="italic">my</hi> part towards preserving you from disappointment,&#x2014;either &#x201C;a huge mass&#x201D; of it or a small one,&#x2014;that my letter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1842-09-08">8 Sept.</date></note> should not have got itself posted?&#x2014; The day turned so wet that driving was just out of the question&#x2014;and as I have already told you we are our own messengers to the post office  Even Charles was told in my hearing, that &#x201C;unless <hi rend="italic">his</hi> letters <pb id="pg-15-80" n="15:80"/>were of <hi rend="italic">vital</hi> importance it was impossible to send them&#x201D;&#x2014;and <hi rend="italic">mine</hi> to babbie had of course no pretensions to &#x201C;vital importance&#x201D; in comparison with the great Stateman&#x2019;s to Lady Harriet &#x26;&#x2014;&#x26;c!&#x2014;</p>
<p>According to programme I did not go down yesterday till I was summoned to dinner where I met Charles with a <hi rend="italic">certain</hi> armed neutrality&#x2014; He should see that I, at least, was too wise a woman to be <hi rend="italic">Charlesed!</hi> that his society-graces and society-talents should not <hi rend="italic">come over</hi> <hi rend="small-caps">me</hi>! One would say he had divined my humour and prepared himself to wheedle me out of it&#x2014; I never saw him so agreeable not to say <hi rend="italic">amiable</hi>&#x2014; Still by a sublime effort of <hi rend="italic">grumpiness</hi> I withstood all his attempts to win from me a <hi rend="italic">cordial</hi> smile! Till at last the fated moment came&#x2014;we were all standing at the hall-door looking out into a dripping world; when suddenly, as if struck with an inspiration from Heaven, he exclaimed &#x201C;I will shoot a&#x2014;holy-hock!&#x201D; wait M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle till I fetch my gun! I <hi rend="italic">must</hi> shoot a holy-hock!&#x201D; the gun was fetched&#x2014;he took his aim with the most sportsman-like intenseness, and a tall holy-hock dropt its head upon its breast! Then flinging down the gun he pulled a large knife from his pocket, ran up to the shot plant&#x2014;severed the broken part from the stem, and carrying it dripping wet between his finger and thumb presented me with his curious <hi rend="italic">game!</hi> Mr Pestrucci himself &#x201C;in the character of Heraclytus<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Filippo Pistrucci (ca. <date when="1777-00-00">1777</date>&#x2013;<date when="1857-00-00">1857</date>), Italian artist and actor improvisor, living in London; see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18360625-TC-JAC-01"><sic>8:360</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1836-06-25">25 June 1836</date></corr></ref>; nicknamed Heraclitus, because of his gloom, after the Greek philosopher (fl. ca. <date>500 <hi rend="small-caps">b.c.</hi></date>).</note> must have laughed at the ridiculous scene&#x2014;and laughing&#x2014;that is to say <hi rend="italic">honestly laughing</hi> with anyone&#x2014;is for me what <hi rend="italic">taking salt</hi> with anyone is among the savages&#x2014;all ideas of hostility were dismissed from my mind&#x2014;and to the disgrace of my originality I am today disposed to subscribe to the general opinion that Charles Buller <hi rend="italic">is</hi> &#x201C;the most <hi rend="italic">agreeable</hi> person alive&#x201D;</p>
<p>Carlyle came in the <hi rend="italic">evening</hi> drenched with rain but otherwise in good condition&#x2014;had seen enough to fill three octavo volumes&#x2014;accomplished all he intended and a vast deal more&#x2014;and lived that day <hi rend="italic">on a quart of greengages!</hi></p>
<p>He still stands by <hi rend="italic">Monday</hi> in spite of Regy&#x2019;s entreaties for &#x201C;another fortnight&#x201D;&#x2014;whether he will hold out against M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Buller&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">gracious mockeries</hi> remains to be seen&#x2014; I hope the great dinner at Lady H Bunbury&#x2019;s tomorrow will clench his resolution&#x2014; At all events you will get a letter on Monday some hours before you need to be looking for us which will put you out of pain either way&#x2014; A bit of <hi rend="italic">good</hi> bacon in the house is all the direction I have to give; in case of our wanting &#x201C;a rough <hi rend="italic">tea</hi>&#x201D;&#x2014;bless you dear&#x2014; I am annoyed today <pb id="pg-15-81" n="15:81"/>in the prospect of that great dinner tomorrow&#x2014;it came into my head the middle of the night and actually kept me from sleeping&#x2014; I have tried to plead off&#x2014;but M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Buller said &#x201C;for <hi rend="italic">Godsake</hi> M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle dont when the thing is all arranged be making objections that have no sort of sense in them&#x201D;!</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>It was but this morning that I received your address from Miss Welsh, and there will barely be time for this finding you at Cheltenham. We think of returning on Monday to Chelsea; there thenceforth will be your mark to write towards.</p>
<p>My journey done hitherward, in the wet day, in the inside of their villainous little saltbox of a coach, was not very pleasant: I think of preferring the outside next time, let it rain as it may. Jane I found looking somewhat improved, tho&#x2019; still very sad, and greatly annoyed by deficiency of sleep. Mrs Buller and all the rest of them are as kind to her as possible, and seem to take pleasure in her presence; old Mr Buller&#x2019;s game with her at Chess is one of the chief events of his day. Indeed they are all very kind and hospitable: the country is green, leafy, clear, and <hi rend="italic">country</hi> tho&#x2019; one of the flat kind; I prefer it even in rain and mud to any kind of town. I walked one day thro&#x2019; lane after lane, in a very devious manner, as far as Thetford in Norfolk; a most laborious but pleasant and serviceable course for me. Next day Mrs Buller had contrived to borrow me a horse, a coarse heavy-footed but stout and quiet country quadruped, on which I have proceeded ever since far more at my ease. They have also made us drive a-visiting some people; with one set of whom, Bunburys and other right Honourables, we are to dine tomorrow, which I trust will be our one feat in that department of activity.</p>
<p>My grand adventure, however, has been a ride of three days into Cromwelldom; which I actually accomplished on my heavy-footed beast, with endless labour, dispiritment and annoyance, but also with adequate interest, profit, and satisfaction to many feelings. I went first to Ely; a ride of thirty miles, most of it lanes &#x26; cross-roads; at length the high Cathedral of Ely rises towering on a hilltop, over an immensity of cultivated bog (not unlike the cultivated part of Lochar Moss); a very venerable-looking place. I there, by some <pb id="pg-15-82" n="15:82"/>industry, found Oliver&#x2019;s house; stood on the very flags in the Cathedral where he told the Priest (contumacious at a <hi rend="italic">first</hi> order), &#x201C;Cease your fooling, and come out, Sir!&#x201D; The huge Horseblock (<foreign><hi rend="italic">louping</hi></foreign>-on [mounting] Stone) at his door is still lying there; I brought away a crumb of it in my pocket. The bells of Ely, and some treacherous green tea &#x26;c kept me awake nearly all night. Next day, my horse and self both in very bad case, I got on to Saint-Ives, Oliver&#x2019;s first farm; sat and smoked one of your cigars in a field which had been <hi rend="italic">his;</hi>&#x2014;very curious to me. The traditions about him in that region are of the vaguest conceivable: such is &#x201C;immortality&#x201D; so-called; I wonder what a Pitt or a Peel<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Pitt (<date when="1759-00-00">1759</date>&#x2013;<date when="1806-00-00">1806</date>) and Sir Robert Peel.</note> will amount to in two centuries, in comparison! &#x201C;Immortality?&#x201D; as my Father would have said, with one of his sharpest intonations! After two hours at Saint-Ives (a little place of some 3,000 people) I moved off to Huntingdon, O&#x2019;s birthplace; saw Hinchinbrook, nearby, which was his Uncle&#x2019;s house, and contains some excellent portraits of Civil-Wars people;&#x2014;dined hastily, and rode with a terrible determination, not at all superfluous, to Cambridge the same evening: I never in my life was thirstier or wearier; the lightning flashed and blazed on the right hand of me, over all the south, from nightfall, and about an hour after my arrival (about 10 o&#x2019;clock, that is) the thunder began in right earnest. Next morning, yesterday namely, I looked diligently at all Colleges &#x26;c within reach, saw Oliver&#x2019;s picture in <hi rend="italic">his</hi> Sidney Sussex College;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably the pastel portrait, formerly thought to be by Samuel Cooper, now ascribed to an unknown painter, probably after Sir Peter Lely.</note> got under way again, in high wind, which became in the afternoon thick-driving rain; and about five I arrived here, sound and safe, not yet wetted to the skin. Today, of course, I am in a very <hi rend="italic">baked</hi> hot feverish condition;&#x2014;and unfit for writing beyond what is absolutely indispensable, for one thing. Here therefore I will cease. <hi rend="italic">Charles</hi> had arrived here in the interim of my absence; he is out shooting today. He is a considerable resource for talking with. But they let one be silent here if one likes,&#x2014;an excellent plan!</p>
<p>I wrote to my Mother from Cambridge; to you I should most probably have written had I known your Address. You will of course write, the first halt you make. <closer><salute>God keep you, dear Brother</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Your Papers respecting the Templand business have followed me out hither; I find them all right, clear, and in due final order; and have much satisfaction in returning you the Receipt signed as you direct; and so, with many thanks for your kind services, closing this Transaction. It would have been briefer, had I known the ground as I now do, to have gone to you at once; and surrendering the matter into your hands from the first, to have waited, as I have lately been doing, in perfect silence, till the issue matured itself without farther intervention of mine.</p>
<p>I have to beg that you will now convey to His Grace, in some fit way, my acknowledgements for his handsome treatment of me in this matter; my true satisfaction and thankfulness that all has ended as it does. It would have been a lasting sorrow to my Wife and me, had we parted from her mother&#x2019;s kind and generous Landlord in an unkind manner; and terminated a relation rendered mournfully interesting now in a spirit so different from that in which it had always been carried on!</p>
<p>With many thanks, I remain,</p>
<closer><salute>Dear Sir, / Yours most truly /</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle.</name>

<p><salute>My dear Sir</salute> &#x2026; I have been in this country on a visit among friends for about a week; I came to bring home my Wife who had already been here for some time. It was only yesternight that I returned from a three-days ride into Oliver Cromwell&#x2019;s country, Ely, Huntingdon, Cambridge, etc.; a region full of interest to me. The general condition of the Farm labourers, though not offensive to the mere cursory eye, is I fear full of misery. &#x201C;Milk?&#x201D; said an old man, to whom I was speaking at Mildenhall,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In Suffolk, ca. 21 mi.

<salute><foreign>Cara Babitha mia</foreign> [My dear Babbie]</salute>
<p>I have only time for a good day to you!&#x2014;and keep up your heart!&#x2014;for surely to goodness we will come on Thursday  I have kept saying constantly Thursday, Thursday, till it seems to be finally received as a settled thing even by Carlyle&#x2014;</p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Thanks for your kind Gift, sent, like an Angel&#x2019;s, in beneficent silence! The peaches were pronounced to be of admirable quality; the three Books on Bristol contained the amplest response to all reasonable curiosity; the big one, Seyer&#x2019;s,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Samuel Seyer, <hi rend="italic">Memoirs Historical and Topographical of Bristol and its Neighbourhood</hi>, 2 vols. (Bristol, <date when="1821-00-00">1821</date>&#x2013;<date when="1823-00-00">23</date>); John Evans, <hi rend="italic">A Chronological Outline of the History of Bristol</hi> (Bristol, <date when="1824-00-00">1824</date>); and perhaps William Barrett, <hi rend="italic">The History and Antiquities of Bristol</hi> (Bristol, <date when="1789-00-00">1789</date>).</note> most part of which I have read, is really a valuable work, and gives one incidental glimpses into many a curious thing. Pray instruct me how I may return it, with its two fellows, now that I have sucked the heart of them out. Or shall they lie here till you yourself come to fetch them?</p>
<p>I should have written sooner, but there was a chance, or shadow of a chance, that we might come to Clifton, to a Friend&#x2019;s house<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Julia Strachey&#x2019;s.</note> <pb id="pg-15-88" n="15:88"/>there, this autumn; and till that had finally vanished, as it now has, I was unwilling to write. Cardiff, we knew, lay near, across the water, and a Friend near Cardiff: but all has grown distant again; we find that there has been enough of rambling for the present season.</p>
<p>My Wife went into Suffolk some five weeks ago; I also about a fortnight ago, to fetch her home. We only returned the night before last. The green country and clear autumn skies were, as all country and skies at all times are, very grateful to me. I made a run too, on horseback, over into Cambridgeshire and Hunts, in search of footsteps of Oliver Cromwell. God&#x2019;s Earth, which Oliver among others walked over, is still verily there; but the traces of Oliver on it are worn very faint indeed. Many of the people never heard of his name; with the remainder he has dwindled mostly into a Fable, and even a dull owlish Fable,&#x2014;for the English are no great hands in the Mythologic line! Yet I had ample scope for emotions and reflexions; and, riding in hot weather one of the worst horses ever saddled, I had fatigue enough. In Ely City, in an open unfrequented region close by the Cathedral, I sat down under the stars on Farmer Cromwell&#x2019;s veritable horse block; a huge stone, at the corner of his house and the gate of the stables, which still lies there: the house itself is now uninhabited these two years, and likely soon to be a ruin. It was very strange to me to sit smoking there, amid the shadows and gas-lights, with the white tombstones on this hand, and living street-lamps on that; and think of all that had come and gone, with such a loud noise once, into such a silence now! Heroic Olivers march on, out of mortal hearing; still faster, chimeric Peels and Pitts,&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">not</hi> out of divine or diabolic hearing: &#x201C;Silent rest over us the Stars, and under us the Graves.&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Goethe, &#x201C;Symbolum.&#x201D;</note> Between these two great <hi rend="small-caps">Silences</hi> how dignified should all human noises and activities feel themselves!&#x2014;</p>
<p>On returning, one of the notablest things I found was a proposal from the Proprietor of the <hi rend="italic">Atlas</hi> Newspaper<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A weekly paper, founded <date when="1826-00-00">1826</date>, by James Whiting (<date when="1777-00-00">1777</date>&#x2013;<date when="1871-00-00">1871</date>). It announced (<date when="1842-09-17">17 Sept.</date>) its &#x201C;Prize Essay&#x2014;One hundred pounds,&#x201D; offered to &#x201C;Candidates for &#x2026; the best Essay &#x2018;On the Causes of, and Remedies for, the existing Distress of the Country.&#x2019;&#x201D;</note> to give a Hundred Pounds by way of Prize for the best Essay on the present condition of the Working Classes and best remedy &#x26;c; in which he requests me to be one of the judges and suggest two others! I wonder a little at the man; fight shy of his judgeship, recommend three others judges. But at all events, it is a strange symptom of the times, this <pb id="pg-15-89" n="15:89"/>Prize-Essay; and indicates truly a new stage in that great business.</p>
<p>We hope to see you when you come again to town; almost any evening we are likely to be at home. Good be with you and your good Mother! I remain always, with many thanks,</p>
<closer><salute>Very truly yours /</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Profiting by the unexpected fact that <hi rend="italic">you</hi> are now Master of Naseby Battlefield,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >FitzGerald&#x2019;s family owned most of the site, which TC and Dr. Arnold had visited in part the previous <date when="1842-05-00">May</date>; see <ref target="volume-14/lt-18420501-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1842-05-01">1 May</date></ref>, and <ref target="volume-14/lt-18420510-TC-TSS-01">TC to TSS, <date when="1842-05-10">10 May</date></ref>. In his account of their meeting FitzGerald wrote that TC &#x201C;had just been &#x2026; over the Field of Naseby &#x2026; and had sufficiently identified the Ground of the Battle with the contemporaneous Accounts of it. As I happened to know the Field well &#x2026; I knew that Carlyle and Arnold had been mistaken&#x2014;misled in part by an Obelisk which my Father had set up as on the highest Ground of the Field, but which they mistook for the centre-ground of the Battle. This I told Carlyle, who was very reluctant to believe that he and Arnold could have been deceived&#x2014;that he could accept no hearsay Tradition or Theory against the Evidence of his own Eyes, etc. However, as I was just then going down to Naseby, I might enquire further into the matter: and <hi rend="italic">Letter I</hi> [this of <date when="1842-09-18">18 Sept.</date>] was to direct me in the Search&#x201D; (Terhune, <hi rend="italic">LEF</hi> 1:342).</note> I have gone over the whole matter once more, probably for the twentieth time; I have copied you my illegible pencil-notes, and reverified everything,&#x2014;that so, if you can understand the meaning (which will be difficult, I fear), you may append to it what commentary, collected on the spot, you may judge edifying.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In his first letter to TC, written apparently the day after (<date when="1842-09-16">16 Sept.</date>) they met, FitzGerald said: &#x201C;I am going tomorrow to Naseby. &#x2026; I will ask the folks there to tell me what they know: and, if you send me a list of questions, will get them answered as well as I can. I cannot but wish you would come down yourself. &#x2026; I and the farmers shall make horrid blunders in the topography, depend upon it&#x201D; (Terhune, <hi rend="italic">LEF</hi> 1:341). To a friend FitzGerald wrote, on the same day: &#x201C;I went to see Carlyle last night. &#x2026; He is full of Cromwell, and, funny enough, went over from Rugby to Naseby this spring with poor Dr. Arnold. They saw nothing, and walked over what was not the field of battle. I want him to go down with me: but he thinks it would be too expensive. So I have engaged to collect what matter I can for him on the spot&#x201D; (Terhune, <hi rend="italic">LEF</hi> 1:340). <ref target="volume-15/lt-18420918-TC-TCNBN-01"><sic>TC&#x2019;s notes</sic><corr>TCNBN</corr></ref> are given after this letter.</note> Let me, however, <pb id="pg-15-90" n="15:90"/>again impress upon you that these statements and descriptions are actual <hi rend="italic">facts</hi>, gathered with industry from some seven or eight eyewitnesses, looking at the business with their own eyes from seven or eight different sides; that the present figure of the ground, in my recollection, corresponds very tolerably well with the whole of them;&#x2014;and that no &#x201C;theory,&#x201D; by what Professor soever, can be of any use to me in comparison.&#x2014; I wish you had Sprigge&#x2019;s complete Plan of the Battle:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Joshua Sprigge, <hi rend="italic">Anglia Rediviva: England&#x2019;s Recovery, being the History of the Motions, Actions, and Successes of the Army under &#x2026; Sir Thomas Fairfax</hi> (<date when="1647-00-00">1647</date>).</note> but you have it not; you have only that foolish Parson&#x2019;s<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;There were <hi rend="italic">two</hi> Parsons who wrote accounts of Naseby&#x2014;Mastin in <date when="1792-00-00">1792</date> and Locking in <date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>&#x201D; (FitzGerald&#x2019;s note at top of MS). John Mastin, vicar of Naseby, <hi rend="italic">History and Antiquities of Naseby</hi> (Cambridge, <date when="1792-00-00">1792</date>); Henry Lockinge, curate of Naseby and Kelmarsh, <hi rend="italic">Historical Gleanings on the Memorable Field of Naseby</hi> (<date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>), who copied Sprigge&#x2019;s plan (Terhune, <hi rend="italic">LEF</hi> 1:348n.).</note> very dim copy of it, and must help yourself with that.</p>
<p>The things I wish you to give me are first: The whole story of your Blacksmith, or other Oral Chronicler, be it wise and credible, be it absurd and evidently false. Then you can ask, whether there remains any tradition of a Windmill at Naseby? One stands in the Plan, not far from North of the village, probably some 300 yards to the west of where the ass of a column<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The obelisk, &#xBD; mi. NE of Naseby.</note> now stands: the whole concern, of fighting, rallying, flying, killing and chasing, transacted itself to the <hi rend="italic">west</hi> of that,&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">on</hi> the height, over the brow of the height, down the slope, in the hollow, and up again to the grounds of Dust Hill, where the <hi rend="italic">final</hi> dispersion took place. Therefore, again, pray ask</p>
<p>Where precisely any dead bodies are known to have been found? Where and when the <hi rend="italic">last</hi>-found was come upon; what they made of it,&#x2014;whether no Antiquarian kept a tooth; at any rate, a button or the like? Cannon-balls ought to be found, especially musket-balls, down in that hollow, and on the slope thitherward: is any extant cabinet master of one?</p>
<p>Farther, are there, on the high ground N.W. or W. of Naseby village, any traces still discoverable of such names as these: &#x201C;Lantford hedges&#x201D; (or perhaps &#x201C;hedge&#x201D;; a kind of thicket running <hi rend="italic">up</hi> the slope, towards the western environs of Naseby village, nearly from the North;&#x2014;Fairfax had dragoons hidden here, who fired upon Rupert&#x2019;s<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Fairfax (<date when="1612-00-00">1612</date>&#x2013;<date when="1671-00-00">71</date>), 3d Baron Fairfax of Cameron, leader of the parliamentary forces at Naseby. Prince Rupert (<date when="1619-00-00">1619</date>&#x2013;<date when="1682-00-00">82</date>), Count Palatine of the Rhine and Duke of Bavaria, afterwards Duke of Cumberland and Earl of Holderness; came to England, <date when="1642-00-00">1642</date>; apptd. gen. of the horse and won first victory at Worcester, <date when="1642-00-00">1642</date>; left England, <date when="1646-00-00">1646</date>, commanded various continental forces, <date when="1646-00-00">1646</date>&#x2013;<date when="1660-00-00">60</date>, and returned to England, <date when="1660-00-00">1660</date>, where he served as adm. and gen.</note> right, as <pb id="pg-15-91" n="15:91"/>he charged upwards): &#x201C;Rutput Hill&#x201D;; &#x201C;Fanny Hill&#x201D; (according to Rushworth,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Rushworth, <hi rend="italic">Historical Collections</hi>, 8 vols. (<date when="1659-00-00">1659</date>&#x2013;<date when="1701-00-00">1701</date>).</note> &#x201C;Famny Hill&#x201D; in Sprigge),&#x2014;probably two swellings in the ground, that lie between the south end of Lantford Hedges and the village; &#x201C;Lean Leaf Hill&#x201D; seemingly another swelling, parallel to these, which reaches in with its slope <hi rend="italic">to</hi> the very village from the west: &#x201C;Mill Hill&#x201D; farther to the east (marked as due west from the windmill, which of course must have stood upon a part of it), lying therefore upon the north part of the village? It is possible, in spite of all ditching and enclosure bills, there may still some vestige of these names adhere to some fields or messuages; the exact position of which it would be satisfactory to fix. You can also tell me whether Burrough Hill is visible from Naseby, and &#x201C;what it is like&#x201D;; and what the Sibbertoft height, on the other side, and the Harboro&#x2019; Heights are like! I suppose one sees Sibbertoft steeple, but no houses, from Naseby Height? Also that it was undoubtedly Clipston (as the good Dr Arnold and I supposed) that we saw there. Dr A. and I came, as I find, thro&#x2019; Crick, West Hadden, Cold Ashby, and crossed the Welford and Northampton road, perhaps some 3 miles from Naseby.</p>
<p>On the whole, my dear Sir, here seems to be work enough for you! But after all is it not worth your while on other accounts? Were it not a most legitimate task for the Proprietor of Naseby, a man of scholarship, intelligence and leisure, to make himself completely acquainted with the true state of all details connected with Naseby Battle and its localities? Few spots of ground in all the world are memorabler to an Englishman.

<p>I wrote you ten days ago a long letter dated Cambridge from my Inn in that Town. This I hope you received duly. It would let you into my ways in those weeks. Next day I got well enough back to Troston, rain attending me for the last two hours. I was terribly wearied of my great flat-soled monster of a horse, but much gratified with my pilgrimage and all rejoiced very handsomely at my return. Charles had come in the interim. They would not let us away on Monday as we proposed. It was settled at last that Thursday should be the day. Charles came up with us to Town. We had a very pleasant kind of journey and got safe home to dinner here. So ends the Troston journey and I think all travelling for this season. The good Mrs. Strachey, who is now in Italy, wrote to offer us her house and servants for two months at Clifton, a beautiful Village near Bristol, 100 miles to the west of us, but we have refused. Rolling stone gathers little fog [moss].<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Proverbial; Copeland reads &#x201C;bog.&#x201D;</note> I must resolutely get some work done now.</p>
<p>Jane seems really better for her country excursion. I observed today that she eats a whole slice of bread to breakfast again. Little <pb id="pg-15-95" n="15:95"/>Miss W.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jeannie Welsh; Copeland reads &#x201C;Min&#x201D; for &#x201C;Miss.&#x201D;</note> is still here. I think she likes much better to be here than at home, in the midst of luxury but also of Liverpool stupidity. She is a fine cheery little lass, very pretty too, and would make a good wife for somebody.</p>
<p>The Duke of Buccleuch has now actually <hi rend="italic">paid</hi> me the &#xa3;100&#x2014;at least sent a draft payable in 10 days hence. I sent my thanks and the business is all over&#x2014;a right agreeable result. You may tell Jamie that the Templand Grates too are paid, payable at the same time; that we <hi rend="italic">saved</hi> the Grates that day, and our broiling journey was not in vain, therefore.</p>
<p>I hope they have now all got a sight of your picture and that I shall get it soon. It will be needless to wait for Jack, he, as I reflect, can do nothing towards carrying it. Poor fellow&#x2014;you will see him again. Here is his last letter, though it can have no news for you. How goes Jamie&#x2019;s harvest? The weather has been <hi rend="italic">brittle</hi> ever since that thunderstorm. How go you yourself, my dear good Mother? Somebody ought to write to me now. I do not hear anything even from Jean.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>We missed you yesterday at dinner for the first time:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >When in London John usually ate Sun. dinner with the Carlyles.</note> you will have some wandering before we see you again! Your Letter came on Saturday night: today I send you a word of notice that we have got home again, that nothing has gone wrong with us.</p>
<p>It was not till Thursday last that we got away: tho&#x2019; anxious to be home, we found it would look unkind if we insisted on Monday. Charles Buller came with us; we had a bright sunny day, Jane in the inside, C. and I on the outside; our journey was as little unpleasant as a journey to me can well be. It ended, after a weary lumbering thro&#x2019; the whole slow length of London, about five O&#x2019;clock.&#x2014; Jane, I think, if she were once completely reinstated, is better, and will go on more cheerily for this rural interruption. I too have got many new images put into my head; my poor nerves have just been under potent drastics (Castor and Blue-pill!)&#x2014;and promise to serve me a little better in <pb id="pg-15-96" n="15:96"/>some sort of real <hi rend="italic">work</hi>, which I am now getting utterly impatient to begin. I need to be prayed for! My malady is <hi rend="italic">dumbness;</hi> the root of it all, at least the curable part of it all, is clearly <hi rend="italic">idleness</hi>.</p>
<p>Nothing had gone materially out of joint in our absence: yet one evening, the very evening or midnight I lay awake at Ely,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1842-09-06">Tues., 6 Sept.</date></note> thieves had actually been in the house! They had entered by the window of the back kitchen (which you may remember is as good as open, at least openable); they had fancied then that if the door of this was opened, they would have command of the whole house, diningroom plate, drawingroom press, and what not,&#x2014;only one servant sleeping sound in the topmost story! Here, however, they were mistaken; Helen now sleeps in the front kitchen; she heard them boring in the back-kitchen door, rose, struck a light, rapped as she went past, and fled up stairs to Miss Welsh. The thieves made off; the police were got alarmed: nothing could be discovered but the hole nearly completed opposite the bolt of the door, a chair, part of it broken in the hurry, and an open window at which the scoundrels had escaped thro&#x2019; the Garden. Not the slightest trace could be fastened upon anybody: I myself partly suspect some of the scamps that frequent Chancellor&#x2019;s stables,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Chancellor kept a livery stable, 1 Cheyne Row.</note> who knew me from home. We have got a joiner to put iron stauncheons outside the window, and take other new measures of defence; Mazzini is to afford me a sufficient horse-pistol: on the whole, I do not think we shall hear of the gentlemen again. Of course you need not tell my Mother anything of all this, which would only vex her good heart and affectionate imagination to no purpose.&#x2014; We are much quieter at nights now when the long days are over; I shall hope for better sleep.&#x2014; O that I could deserve some right sleep by a little right labour in the daytime! <foreign><hi rend="italic">Voyons</hi></foreign> [Let us see].</p>
<p>One of the Letters lying for me was from &#x201C;the Proprietor of the <hi rend="italic">Atlas Newspaper</hi>,&#x201D; asking me to be a judge in his &#xa3;100 prize-essay! The business seemed benevolent, not to be peremptorily rejected, not to be obstructed; yet I had and have very little hope of good from it; and answered accordingly, endeavouring to shy off from the judgeship. The man has written again. I send you both the the<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> Letters, also his last Atlas N<hi rend="italic">o</hi>, from which you will discern the whole matter as it now lies. The Letters you can keep, and return to me. I do not like to refuse; and yet, on the whole, I perhaps like <hi rend="italic">worse</hi> to act: I have yet answered nothing, and will wait for a while before answering. &#x201C;J <pb id="pg-15-97" n="15:97"/>Whiting,&#x201D; it seems, is a printer: his offer has something of the magnanimous in it, poor Whiting.</p>
<p>You will surely go to Annandale, if it be at all possible, and see our good old Mother once again. Ah me! The sight of you will be a kind of jubilee to her and them all.&#x2014; Did I tell you that the Duke had actually paid me his money; at least, given me a Draught for it, payable on the 26<hi rend="italic">th</hi> inst.? I was right glad of it.</p>
<p>Be well &#x26; happy, my dear Brother.</p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Last night the two little Books with your Letter lay waiting for me; I had been out for a while into Suffolk,&#x2014;over also into Cambridgeshire and Hunts, seeking memorials of Oliver Cromwell! I did not find much; the memory of the mighty man is gone nearly altogether, in those his native regions, into a foolish mythus; the people&#x2019;s notions about him, where any notion at all survives, are not only false but absurd and stupid: such is &#x201C;immortality&#x201D; within a space of some two poor centuries! &#x201C;Posterity,&#x201D; like Actuality, if you &#x201C;appeal&#x201D; to it, is too often very much of a blockhead. They are not happy who have nothing better than Posterity to appeal to!&#x2014; Yet I did find Oliver&#x2019;s farm-fields, which <hi rend="italic">he</hi> had tilled and pastured, at St. Ives; the fields and soil are still there, and the shadow of the man still hovering over them: I also had the satisfaction to discover his old House, which will be a ruin soon, near the Cathedral of Ely; and smoked a cigar on the very horse-block (<hi rend="italic"><foreign>louping</foreign>-on</hi> stone) which had been Farmer Cromwell&#x2019;s,&#x2014;not without reflexions, under the stars there!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Your two little Books are very welcome, and worthy of many thanks. I had already managed to see the Drummond Publication,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-14/lt-18420728-TC-JOST-01">TC to <sic>JS</sic><corr>JOST</corr>, <date when="1842-07-28">28 July</date></ref>.</note> which you may fancy was very interesting: tonight I will go into my old friend Rous&#x2019;s version of the Psalms; I am anxious to see to what extent I have been wrong in fancying him the sole and final versifier of our Scottish Psalter. Poor old Sir Francis!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-14/lt-18420404-TC-JUCH-01">TC to <sic>JCH</sic><corr>JUCH</corr>, <date when="1842-04-04">4 April</date></ref>.</note> Immortality is a very mortal thing in that province too.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-15-98" n="15:98"/>Can you point out to me any <hi rend="italic">Scotch</hi> account of the Battle of Dunbar;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In E Lothian; scene of Cromwell&#x2019;s victory, <date when="1650-09-03">3 Sept. 1650</date>, over Leslie&#x2019;s covenanters.</note> or even as much as any intelligible account of the ground it was fought on?

<p><salute><hi rend="small-caps">Dear Strachey</hi>, &#x2014;</salute> About a week ago I addressed a note to you at 11 Mount Street. Going yesterday to call upon you there, I found that it was a wrong address; that you were not discoverable there! Rather unwisely, I had left your last note with Mrs. Buller,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Strachey&#x2019;s address was 115 Mount St., Mrs. Buller his maternal aunt.</note> to keep her in mind of your address; I fancying that I could carry it safely in my head. The worst will be if the note have miscarried, for it contained a small letter to your mother on a subject that could ill afford to wait longer for an answer. My hope is that the postman of your street had sagacity and memory enough to correct the number from his own resources. Trusting partly to this, I send you a new note with the old address, but with a supplement or <foreign><hi rend="italic">pis aller</hi></foreign> [last resort]. When you answer me, I will pay better heed to the cipher.</p>
<p>The main purpose of my visit yesterday was to say that my wife, who is a chess-player of some eminence, like yourself, will be very happy to come and play a game with you whenever you can send to give her warning, and fetch her up and down. She is, unfortunately, no walker, but very well affected to chess and to you.</p>
<p>My brother seems to be about Beaumaris,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On the island of Anglesey off the N Welsh mainland.</note> with intent to continue some weeks in that neighborhood, and pass over into Scotland for a few days.</p>

<p><salute>Dear Jean,&#x2014;</salute>Perhaps this little Letter from our dear good Mother may be &#x2018;worth sending&#x2019; to you.</p>
<p>I have heard no news from Dumfries for a great while, tho&#x2019; I think I wrote to you some time ago.</p>
<p>We have been in Suffolk, rusticating with the Buller&#x2019;s: Jane was there some five weeks in all; I, who went to fetch her home, was constrained by hospitality and bright weather about a fortnight. In <pb id="pg-15-100" n="15:100"/>the middle of that period I made a three days excursion into Oliver Cromwell&#x2019;s birthland, and saw several things; of which I wrote to my Mother a long Letter from Cambridge;&#x2014;perhaps they have sent it over to you? We are now safe home again: and I am beginning to try some attempts at working,&#x2014;poor wretch that I am! This makes me the briefer today. Jane is growing better; the Liverpool Jeannie is still here. Our town is infinitely quieter at present; little stirring in this end of it but Painters, all painting &#x201C;like lions&#x201D; (as Jamie of Scotsbrig says) while the people are out in the country!</p>
<p>Jack is in North Wales; expects to see you all soon.</p>
<p>You need not wait for <hi rend="italic">him</hi> with the Portrait:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >By Maxwell.</note> on consideration I perceive that he can do nothing towards forwarding it. So soon as the frame is well completed, let it be effectually packed, and set off. Perhaps Jenny&#x2019;s shirts &#x26;c might assist in packing or securing it? I am somewhat inexperienced in these things.</p>
<p>No more at present, my dear Jean. I hope to learn soon that you too are all well. Let us be thankful that so much good is given us all with blessings</p>
<p>The Duke has at length actually paid me my money; many thanks to him&#x2014;<closer><salute>and also good-b&#x2019;ye to him!</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>My dear Sir, &#x2014;</salute> I am very sorry to have been out the other day when you called again. I suppose it is my last chance of seeing you in England. You leave me, too, as an incorrigible heretic and infidel, which verily I am not, yet must be content to seem for the present! Well, I will wish you a right pleasant reunion with your native friends, with those whom you know better than you do me. To hear that your scheme of life prospers to the utmost possible extent will, you may depend upon it, be always happy news to me. Though not precisely my church, I do reckon it a branch of the true church, very worthy to spread and root itself according to its power in a world so overgrown with falsity and jungle as ours is. &#x2026; I was absent in Suffolk when your invitation to the Conference<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably to the meeting at Alcott House to discuss whether private property ought to be abolished, <date when="1842-09-07">7 Sept.</date> Alcott left for the U.S., <date when="1842-09-28">28 Sept.</date> Long afterwards he was to recall his encounters with TC: &#x201C;Curious to see him monologizing, his chin aloft, the pent thunders rolling, lightnings darting from under his bold brows. &#x2026; A loveable man, nevertheless, with a great heart in his breast&#x201D; (Alcott, <hi rend="italic">Concord Days</hi> [Boston, <date when="1873-00-00">1873</date>] 162&#x2013;63).</note> reached me.

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>You will do me and the Genius of History a real favour, if you persist in these examinations and excavations to the utmost length possible for you! It is long since I read a Letter so interesting as yours of Yesterday.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dated <date when="1842-09-23">23 Sept.</date> in which FitzGerald drew a map of the battlefield; see Terhune, <hi rend="italic">LEF</hi> 1:352&#x2013;55.</note> Clearly enough you are upon the very battleground;&#x2014;and I, it is also clear, have only looked up towards it from the slope of Mill Hill. Were not the weather so wet, were not &#x26;c &#x26;c, so many <foreign><hi rend="italic">etceteras</hi></foreign>, I could almost think of running up to join you still! But that is evidently <hi rend="italic">un</hi>feasible at present.</p>
<p>The opening of that burial-heap blazes strangely in my thoughts: these are the very jawbones that were clenched together in deadly rage, on this very ground, 197 years ago!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >FitzGerald wrote in a postscript: &#x201C;Having ordered one of the reputed graves to be opened near Cloisterwell&#x2014;a soil of animal matter mixed with crumbling jawbones, arm-bones, skulls, etc., is found about four feet under the surface. Only the teeth perfect: plenty of them. The Scotchman [a Naseby farmer named Love] is digging hard now this late [&#x201C;&#xBD; past 8 <hi rend="small-caps">p.m.</hi>&#x201D;&#x2014;FitzGerald&#x2019;s note]: and proposes the whole matter as manure for turnips&#x201D; (Terhune, <hi rend="italic">LEF</hi> 1:355).</note> It brings the matter home to one, with a strange veracity,&#x2014;as if for the first time one saw it to be no fable and theory but a dire fact.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >To a friend FitzGerald wrote, the same day: &#x201C;Carlyle has shewn great sagacity in guessing at the localities from the vague descriptions of contemporaries: and his short <foreign><hi rend="italic">pasticcio</hi></foreign> of the battle [with <ref target="volume-15/lt-18420918-TC-EF-01">his letter of <date when="1842-09-18">18 Sept.</date></ref>] is the best I have seen. But he will spoil all by making a demigod of Cromwell, who certainly was so far from wise that he brought about the very thing he fought to prevent&#x2014;the restoration of an unrestricted monarchy&#x201D; (Terhune, <hi rend="italic">LEF</hi> 1:352).</note> I will beg for a tooth <pb id="pg-15-102" n="15:102"/>and a bullet;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In his <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> TC was to write: &#x201C;A friend of mine [i.e., himself] has in his cabinet two ancient grinder-teeth, dug lately from that ground&#x2014;and waits for an opportunity to rebury them there&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 6:212); see K.

TC also wrote on an envelope: &#x201C;Two jaw teeth, dug from a burial-mound (near Cloisterwell) &#x2026; and sent to me by Edward FitzGerald. T.C.&#x201D; Then follow three notations: &#x201C;One given to J. Childs of Bungay, <date when="1848-02-18">18 Feb<hi rend="italic">y</hi> 1848</date>&#x201D;; &#x201C;bigger one left here&#x201D;; &#x201C;other tooth (and bullet) given to Mr. [name illegible] of the &#x2018;Bookplate&#x2019; <date when="1853-01-23">23rd. Jan<hi rend="italic">y</hi> 1853</date>&#x201D; (Terhune, <hi rend="italic">LEF</hi> 1:346). The relics TC gave to Childs are in the Strouse Collection, and with them are two notes by TC: (1) &#x201C;Arm-bone from Naseby Battlefield; sent me in <date when="1842-09-00">Sept. 1842</date> by E. FitzGerald; now presented to John Childs of Bungay. T.

I understand almost all the Netherlands battlefields have already given up their bones to British husbandry; why not the old English next? Honour to thrift. If of 5000 wasted men, you can make a few usable turnips, why, do it!&#x2014;</p>
<p>The more sketches and details you can contrive to send me, the better. I want to know for one thing whether there is any <hi rend="italic">house</hi> on Cloisterwell; what house that was that I saw from the slope of Naseby height (Mill-hill, I suppose), and fancied to be Dust Hill Farm? It must lie about North by West from Naseby Church perhaps near a mile off. You say, one cannot see Dust Hill at all, much less any farm house of Dust Hill, from that Naseby Height?</p>
<p>But why does the Obelisk stand there? It might as well stand at Charing Cross; the blockhead that it is!&#x2014; I again wish that I had wings: alas, I wish many things; that the gods would but annihilate Time and Space, which would include all things!</p>

<salute>Dear Jenny,</salute>
<p>As perhaps you do not hear the news very regularly, the inclosed bits of Letters from my Mother and the Doctor may be worth a penny to you. You will at least see that all was well at those dates; and that the Doctor is likely to pay you a visit soon.</p>
<p>We have been wandering a little here: Jane was out in the country at Mrs Buller&#x2019;s for some five weeks; I during the last fortnight was there too, having gone out to fetch her home: I took a little ride for three days into the two neighbouring counties, looking after some things I wanted to see. We are now safe at home again, for above a fortnight, and do not mean to stir a second time. Jane seems likely to be better for her country seclusion. I too am no worse; have taken to work &#x26;c. Miss Welsh is still with us. Our town is altogether quiet at present; the weather has grown very bad and blustery, which I hope is not the case in your region, where the Harvest is hardly done yet.</p>
<p>The shirts and flannel-shirts are all ready now, no doubt: they will be welcome when they come, for my old stock is getting very thin indeed. I have been sometimes wondering of late if you could not make me moreover two pairs of flannel drawers! I am sure you could excel Tom Garthwaite in the fitting of them! Tell me what you think. I could send you up a pair of cotton drawers, which <hi rend="italic">very nearly</hi> fit, by the Post, for a few pence: these you could rip out, and cut the others by, could you?&#x2014; Or perhaps you had better not embark in this speculation; but stick more by women&#x2019;s sewing? I will think of it no more, if you think so.</p>
<p>My dear little Sister, I often remember you with great interest; <pb id="pg-15-104" n="15:104"/>with hope that in spite of all your peculiar difficulties you will be seen to act wisely, patiently, courageously,&#x2014;the more honour to you if you do! What help is in me you can always count upon; it is a duty I owe towards &#x2026;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ellipsis in MS.</note> Courage!</p>
<p>We hope all goes well at Gill, a fair harvest well gathered,&#x2014;industrious working and the fair fruits of industry. We send our affectionate regards to Mary and Jamie;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Austin.</note> our heart&#x2019;s blessing to you all.</p>

<salute>Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Your two Letters from Beaumaris came on the <hi rend="italic">same</hi> day; the first of them had been too late for the evening mail: they were welcome, at what time soever.</p>
<p>We have not the smallest approach to news here: our weather for the last week has been a perfect puddle of rain, east-wind, mud and imprisonment; even Darwin cannot get down to us, were news never so rife! I am struggling hard to get my pen in motion again; I sit obstinately at my desk, and do darken paper daily, but Heaven only can discern whitherward as yet. I feel on the whole that there is or can be no help for me at all, except by working and struggling of my own, now and here:&#x2014;wherefore pray that I may have the sense and courage to continue struggling. Light rises by degrees, if one go resolutely forward seeking light.</p>
<p>A Note came yesterday from Jean, which I inclose. We have decided that the Picture is to be sent straightway <hi rend="italic">without</hi> framing. I trust you will find it hung up here, all right, when you come back.</p>
<p>Redwood the Welsh Attorney writes me, touching some Books &#x26;c he had previously sent. I have cause to like that man. A short Note has also come from Sterling: he is in bad spirits, himself has been sick and his Wife; they are now recovering. I have yet made no kind of answer to Whiting of the Atlas. Perhaps he will let me off, will leave it lying there. At <hi rend="italic">worst</hi> it will but be to consent! On the whole, nothing will come of his Prize Essay, except a mountain <pb id="pg-15-105" n="15:105"/>of crudities,&#x2014;and perhaps an additional degree of attention, for a little while, bestowed by the Public at large on that great question, when they hear there is a prize for it. A result which we must consider in any case to be none of the largest!</p>
<p>On Sunday, putting on bad clothes and an old hat, I set forth into a 12 miles walk on the Surrey side: by Garrat (a wretched hamlet, where I did not see any &#x201C;Mayor&#x201D;), by Tooting, Clapham<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Garrat is a village ca. 5 mi. SSW of Chelsea; TC refers to Samuel Foote&#x2019;s farce, <hi rend="italic">The Mayor of Garrat</hi> (<date when="1764-00-00">1764</date>). Clapham and Tooting are in the same general direction.</note> &#x26;c; my recompense was not immediate,&#x2014;a night of very bad sleep: but I do feel rather healthier ever since, and mean to repeat the process on occasion That same evening, just before tea, W<hi rend="italic">m</hi> Cunningham<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coningham.</note> came in: an embarrassed painful kind of man, but with much worth; who will surely gather clearness, better confidence, as he goes on. He went away after two hours, amid rain-deluges; having had a cab in waiting all the while! <foreign>Stimabiledom</foreign> continues under the horizon, at Dublin we suppose. Lhotsky the Pole (did you never hear of him?) came to me the other morning with a most priceless Tractate on &#x201C;Death by Starvation in the Metropolis&#x201D;:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-14/lt-18420728-TC-JF-01">TC to JF, <date when="1842-07-28">28 July</date></ref>. Only an <date when="1844-00-00">1844</date> printing of <hi rend="italic">On Cases of Death by Starvation &#x2026; with a preparatory plan for remedying these evils in the metropolis</hi> has been traced.</note> he is one of poor Mazzini&#x2019;s ragged reg<hi rend="italic">t</hi>, whom ever since I heard last winter that he was utterly without bread or clothes, I have never been able to get rid of again,&#x2014;having given him some old clothes &#x26;c on that sad occasion. This time he was on the point of being off for Paris; thence, if he failed, to America: to quit England at least forevermore. Unfortunately however he could not raise the whole passage-money! No such dignified, really noble-minded beggar, did we ever before see. I gave him a sovereign and a suit of old clothes: his silent bow when he left me was beyond any of Macready&#x2019;s: low, with outstretched arms, expressive at once of gratitude, felicity, despair!&#x2014;Poor Lhotsky.
    I read his &#x201C;Death by Starvation&#x201D; in spite of its deep sincere tragedy of meaning, with explosions of laughter.&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; &#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; Hang it, here is the <hi rend="italic">young</hi> Whiting,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Whiting&#x2019;s son, not further identified.</note> come to dun me about this beggar of a Prize-Essay!

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Yesterday I was in such a haste and flurry when I closed (having to walk or run to the Pimlico Post-office, after dismissing Whiting) that I forgot, it would seem, to inclose Jean&#x2019;s Letter, which I spoke of,&#x2014;which is still lying on the table! I enclose it today.&#x2014; Your <hi rend="italic">Courrier de l&#x2019;Europe</hi> has come. I have written a <hi rend="italic">refusal</hi> to Whiting: <foreign><hi rend="italic">damit genug</hi></foreign> [enough of that]. I can see nothing but balderdash lying in the rear there, especially with Brewster &#x26; Wilson for fellow judges. I had better write on the thing myself, and leave others to judge!</p>
<p>A certain Mr Fitzgerald, an acquaintance of Thackeray&#x2019;s, who had been here before,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC&#x2019;s memory of having met FitzGerald before <date when="1842-09-15">15 Sept.</date> seems faulty. In FitzGerald&#x2019;s account of their meeting he speaks of going &#x201C;about the <date when="1842-09-00">middle of September, 1842</date>, &#x2026; to tea with Carlyle whom I had previously not known&#x201D; (Terhune, <hi rend="italic">LEF</hi> 1:342).</note> called one night about a week ago; told me he had just come from Naseby: <hi rend="italic">he</hi>, or his Father, was now proprietor of Naseby Battle-field! He undertook to make new inquiries, drawings of scenes &#x26;c;&#x2014;and has made them. He finds the actual battle-<hi rend="italic">field</hi>, on which I seem not to have been at all; opens burial-mounds, discovers actual skeleton <hi rend="italic">debris;</hi>&#x2014;sends me, this morning, two actual jaw-teeth, in full preservation, from a fighter at Naseby Battle! I have them here. There is something very sternly impressive in such a horrible pair of relics!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC wrote in his Journal: &#x201C;Old FitzGerald has dug into Naseby Field for me: I have two Naseby soldiers <hi rend="italic">teeth</hi> here (of his raising up), and four gun bullets gathered there by others.&#x201D; FitzGerald wrote to TC, <date when="1842-09-27">27 Sept.</date>: &#x201C;Bullets and shin-bone by first opportunity.

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Surely there seems little use in saluting you specially, now that I am writing in such haste to Jenny: but I cannot send a message to the house you are in without a word to you.</p>
<p>Dear Mother I beg of you to wrap yourself up, and take care of yourself, in this wild blustery weather: I wonder how you got down, or how you are to get up again, if you have wild tumults in the air like us. A continual <hi rend="italic">gusty</hi> wind from the North and East, with fierce showers, and even incessant days of dirty wet,&#x2014;the whole atmosphere feeling round one like cold jelly! I beg of you to take care of yourself. Jane has not been out till today, for nearly a week.</p>
<p>Along with this I send two Letters received some time ago, which are not worth much. Jack had them, and sent them back to me; but you, I think, need not return them. I yesterday answered the man that I must beg to be excused. His Prize-Essay, I consider, it meant mainly for a kind of puff to his Newspaper, and will come to very little: besides, he has already got Professor Wilson &#x26; Dr Brewster of Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> for judges,&#x2014;and these may serve him very well!</p>
<p>I have begun writing about a week ago, and am doing what is in me; but that is not much. I must struggle along, and gather strength as I go. I am like a poor old spavined horse; cannot mark the ground at starting; but if you whip him on, the poor old <foreign><hi rend="italic">garron</hi></foreign> [work horse] will mend when the sweat breaks on him!&#x2014;</p>
<p>My dear Mother, this is no Letter; but I will send you one by and by.&#x2014; Jane is pretty well today and is gone out. Take you care of yourself! Our love to Mary &#x26; Jamie.</p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Had the weather held up today as it promised yesterday to do, the chances are I should have written, in time for the post, to request the favour of the Farmer&#x2019;s Gig at Crick tomorrow, that I might join you in the field, after all, and see with my own eyes! There is a horrible impressiveness in these jaw-teeth; a stern matter of fact that there <hi rend="italic">was</hi> a Fight at Naseby, and that you are now on the very arena of the same. To think that this grinder chewed its breakfast on the <date when="1645-06-14">14<hi rend="italic">th</hi> of June 1645</date>, and had no more eating to do in the world, or service farther there&#x2014;till now, to lie in my drawer, and be a horror! For one thing, I wish you would not open any more mounds till I can be there too: it would have been worth a longer journey to see those poor packed skeltons; that &#x201C;last of the batch&#x201D; (or <hi rend="italic">first</hi>, first-buried, I suppose he must have been) lying flat on his back; and that one lying across the rest, jammed in, as you describe!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >FitzGerald wrote to TC, <date when="1842-09-27">27 Sept.</date>: &#x201C;We opened part of the grave &#x2026; &#x2014;a trench about 7 feet long and 3&#xBD; wide&#x2014;6 deep&#x2014;the remains of seven or eight poor chaps in this space, as we thought: but a rule of three Men would tell one exactly how many men of given dimensions could be packed in such an area. They lay east and west alternately&#x2014;as they pack fish&#x2014;the bones (such as remained) as porous as sponge almost&#x2014;the skulls (those not porous) not enduring the heaving of the spade round the clay that hooded them&#x2014;the teeth quite good. I send you samples&#x2014;such as argued (our Scotchman said) stout owners. One skeleton lay across the rest, jammed in it seemed: the jaw desperately protruded from the skull and the arms pinched up to the chin. The last (as we thought) of the batch. I mean the last in depth&#x2014;was pretty perfect in form&#x2014;then we left him&#x2014;a heavy rain fell in the night and washed away his ribs: his thighs and legs still extended in corpse-like propriety, looking upward too&#x201D; (Terhune, <hi rend="italic">LEF</hi> 1:357).</note> Pray explain <hi rend="italic">him</hi> a little better: was he atop, near the middle, or where? He must have lain north and south, I suppose, and you got but half of him, and that all indistinct.</p>
<p>I want no more bones, shin or other; but pray continue to send me as many details as you can; I will write only if I have something new to ask,&#x2014;as I have at present, on one or two points.</p>
<p>Your sketches recal to me perfectly the physiognomy of the ground; I now see where I was, and that the house I inquire after was that in sketch N<hi rend="italic">o</hi> 2 which stands at the west end of Lodge Hill: this the Dr<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Arnold.</note> and I had agreed to consider as <hi rend="italic">Dust Hill</hi>, which latter also we must have noticed tho&#x2019; far off our route was past the Obelisk <pb id="pg-15-109" n="15:109"/>a little way; then down to the left by a field-lane (the first we could find, I think, and near a small three-cornered speck of something like plantation if I remember); down this field-lane we proceeded a pretty way; opening a gate or gates, and holding on with varieties of level, but without suspicion of new &#x201C;Hills,&#x201D; till I think we had come nearly to the bottom of the ground there, and saw <hi rend="italic">Lodge Hill</hi> house (is that the name of it?) nearly opposite to us: we then scrambled along <hi rend="italic">westward</hi>, without descending farther; by the roots of high hedges, rough dingles, briars and young wood, thro&#x2019; ditches, sometimes on the edge of ploughed fields, and often on very spongy ground,&#x2014;discerning at intervals what must have been the Sibbertoft road, and a good way to the N.E of that and of Lodge Hill house, a clear red distinct village, which I consider to have been Clipstone: we got at length into open field-paths or cart-tracks, and returned conveniently into Naseby right thro&#x2019; the Farmer&#x2019;s Yard, as our last course led us! We were never on the proper side of the Sibbertoft road at all; nor I fancy within more than sight of Broadmoor and Cloisterwell, if even that. I mean to visit the place once more,&#x2014;along with you, if you will let me in good weather.</p>
<p>But now for the questions I have in view:</p>
<p>1. Can you mark on one of these Plans<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Which TC had enclosed.</note> where specially the place is from which you dug these two jaw-teeth? Is Cloisterwell the foreground of No. 3: the grave is somewhere on that, is it not?</p>
<p>2. The three buttons are altogether insignificant; but their &#x201C;N.Y.I.&#x201D; is becoming altogether a riddle to me. The names of perhaps 20 regiments are given in Books, and not one of them has any title even distantly resembling that, or, as it were, reconcilable with that. &#x201C;Infantry&#x201D; is not a word used much in those days,&#x2014;and perhaps never in official language. The regiment is always &#x201C;Colonel <hi rend="italic">Something&#x2019;s</hi> of Foot,&#x201D; Colonel Something&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Tertia</hi>, &#x26;c &#x26;c. Yet N.Y.I. must mean something; there it is! Could you give me a clear stamp of it in wax,&#x2014;and assure yourself that these 9 buttons were actually found on the battle-field, and did belong to a soldier.&#x2014; I do not discern at present that there was a single York <hi rend="italic">Infantry</hi> man there; Sir Marmaduke Langdale (on the King&#x2019;s left wing) had Northern Horse, some of whom I doubt not were Yorkshire men;&#x2014;them (and not the King&#x2019;s Lifeguard) were they that Ireton<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henry Ireton.</note> beat up in Naseby the night before. They were not in the best humour next morning; wanting rather to be off towards Pontefract, to raise the siege there, and be within scent of their own hearth smoke&#x2014;&#x201C;N.Y.I.&#x201D;? On the whole, <pb id="pg-15-110" n="15:110"/>it is but an inanity if one did know it: but riddles of that kind fasten occasionally on the inquiring mind!</p>
<p>3. Do not forget to give me the traditional name of the little Boy whom the Horseman flung gently out of harm&#x2019;s way into the cabbage garden. It is very pretty.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >FitzGerald wrote, <date when="1842-09-27">27 Sept.</date>, about a child who &#x201C;was toddling up Naseby Street when the troopers came riding along: he was almost under the horse&#x2019;s feet, when the foremost trooper leaned down, took him up, and put him gently over the low mud wall of the rick yard. &#x2026; Even the name of this child has come down, being a native. But the jolly trooper, whether Dragoon or Life Guard, or what, passed on nameless&#x201D; (Terhune, <hi rend="italic">LEF</hi> 1:358). Writing to TC, <date when="1842-10-07">7 Oct.</date>, FitzGerald gave the child&#x2019;s name as Ringrose.</note></p>
<p>4. Will you copy me the inscription on the Obelisk.&#x2014; I trust in Heaven it was not you or any of your Ancestors that put it up!<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Replying on <date when="1842-10-02">2 Oct.</date> (misdating <date when="1842-09-02">2 Sept.</date>), FitzGerald wrote: &#x201C;The Inscription on the Obelisk (which really is what Liston used to call &#x2018;an Obstacle&#x2019;)&#x2014;raised by my Papa, and by him inscribed, runs thus: &#x2018;To commemorate that Great and Decisive Battle, fought in this field on the <date when="1645-06-14">14th day of June, 1645</date>, between the Royalist Army, commanded by his Majesty King Charles the 1st. and the Parliamentary forces, headed by the Generals Fairfax and Cromwell, which terminated fatally for the Royal Cause, led to the subversion of the Throne, the Altar, and the Constitution, and for years plunged the nation into the horrors of Anarchy and Civil War&#x2014;leaving a useful lesson etccc.&#x2019; I shall not go on with it, for you will grimly smile at it: and it can be of no use to you&#x201D; (Terhune, <hi rend="italic">LEF</hi> 1:369).</note> For verily I still must astonish myself that it did not stand <hi rend="italic">on</hi> the battlefield, instead of a mile from it,&#x2014;a vain rival to Naseby Steeple, which <hi rend="italic">already</hi> stood conspicuous there. Let some charitable mortal clap an index hand upon it, at least, and write &#x201C;Yonder!&#x201D; Seriously I think some stone ought to be set up on the place where you dug the skeletons or thereabouts; and if I had charge of the Obelisk, I would pray to have it carted thither.</p>
<p>5. Were I not getting ashamed of myself, I would ask finally about the bells of Naseby Church: they were put up new some years before the Battle; one of them has on it an inscription <foreign><hi rend="italic">Auspice regno</hi></foreign>, which fairly baffles my Latin, if Latin and sense are to go together,&#x2014;unless it be a misprint of the vicar&#x2019;s, and the poor metal Bell carry on it <foreign><hi rend="italic">Auspice Rege?</hi></foreign> How can <hi rend="italic">the Kingdom</hi> be any Bell&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">auspex</hi>,&#x2014;nay, for that matter, the <hi rend="italic">King</hi> is straitened enough to be it!<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;<foreign>Auspice Rege</foreign>&#x201D; means &#x201C;under the auspices of the King&#x201D;; TC is right that it would be hard to make sense of &#x201C;<foreign>Auspice regno</foreign>.&#x201D; Answering his query FitzGerald wrote, <date when="1842-10-02">2 Oct.</date>: &#x2018;The Inscription on the Bells, I quote from Mastin&#x2019;s History [<hi rend="italic">History and Antiquities of Naseby</hi>]&#x2014;with a comment on that which troubles you by the present Vicar. &#x2026; Round the skirt [of the first bell]&#x2014;&#x2018;God save the King&#x2019; and on a kind of medal one inch and half diameter, this Inscription round the King&#x2019;s Arms&#x2014;<foreign>Auspice Regno</foreign>. <date when="1633-00-00">1633</date>. Comment. Mastin did not know that these medals were half-crowns of Charles I. let into the molten metal: the motto being on one side &#x201C;<foreign>Christo Auspice regno</foreign> [Under the auspices of Christ for the kingdom]&#x201D;&#x2014; On the other Charles on horseback, etcc.&#x201D; (Terhune, <hi rend="italic">LEF</hi> 1:370).</note></p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Thanks anew for your new Sketches and Details:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sent with a letter of [<date when="1842-09-30">30 Sept.</date>].</note> you have anticipated nearly all I wanted in the Sketch way; had I my Sketches N<hi rend="italic">os</hi>. 2 &#x26; 3 safe back, it were about all right on that side. Pity, indeed, that those two are on the same paper,&#x2014;somewhat. One might spread out the whole on the table at once, and construct for oneself a perfect panorama of the ground from them.&#x2014; You have proved yourself, I must be allowed to say, a most brave Investigator in this matter: had I anticipated any such harvest of results, I should certainly have gone with you, rain and all.</p>
<p>Your Marston-Trussel graves are very likely to be authentic. The chase lasted all the way to Harborough: the King, feeling himself unsafe there, fled on to Ashby de la Zouch that night; and even then rested only a few hours. There was no &#x201C;ravishing of women&#x201D;;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >FitzGerald wrote: &#x201C;I was told that there were graves at a place called Marston woods&#x2014;about three miles, or rather less, from Broadmoor&#x2014;on the way to Marlborough. I drove to these woods, and saw a country indeed where a flying army might have got a check from the steep declivity of the ground, but I could not hear more of graves. &#x2026; I then went on to Marston itself: which has a story to tell. The Royalists fled, and were pursued thither, and a great slaughter was made. &#x2026; This end of the town is called, and has always been called Puddingbay-end&#x2014;it is a &#x2018;<foreign>cul-de-sac</foreign>&#x2019;: and was much more so 200 years ago, when it was completely blocked up by a great mansion of the Trussels (the village is now called Marston Trussell). &#x2026; So here the Royalists stood at bay, and there was a grand scrimmage: so that a little paddock just under the Church yard is called Slaughford: which the parson told me meant Slaughter ford. &#x2026; As to the proofs of the slaughter, my parson&#x2019;s father was digging in the churchyard many years ago to found a vault for his own family: and he came upon a heap of decayed bodies (just like that I lit upon) in the very place where tradition had always pointed out the grave of the slaughtered to be, and which was marked by that sinking in of the ground which always follows a heap of bodies buried shallowly. &#x2026; Tradition also tells of a great ravishment of women in the fields about here&#x201D; (Terhune, <hi rend="italic">LEF</hi> 1:365&#x2013;66).</note>&#x2014;far other fish to fry on that occasion: besides the Fairfax soldiers were <pb id="pg-15-113" n="15:113"/>no ravishers; even the stealing of a goose was punished with instant hanging. Prince Rupert&#x2019;s chivalry indeed&#x2014; But you can judge whether they would be in a ravishing humour on that occasion!</p>
<p>That you could not see Burrough Hill from Guilsborough is all as it should be; for Sprigge&#x2019;s error in that name is manifest, and the place he means, there can be no doubt even from his own context, is Kislingbury: it was from the environs of Flower (near Weedon),&#x2014;somewhere between Flower and Kislingbury,&#x2014;that Fairfax, on the Friday morning early, saw the King&#x2019;s forces hurrying away from Burrough Hill and their huts on fire. He got to Guilsborough that night,&#x2014;and if &#x201C;Gilling&#x201D; be not a misprint or mistake for that, it is to the <hi rend="italic">present</hi> Antiquarian clearly a nonentity, having totally vanished out of that region.</p>
<p>The Cold Ashby tradition is likewise very credible, almost probable.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >FitzGerald wrote: &#x201C;Borough Hill is to be seen from a spot close to Cold Ashby. I hear of traces of an army passing through Cold Ashby, but not through Thornby, which is the <hi rend="italic">more</hi> direct road from Guilsborough to Naseby: But neither are the <hi rend="italic">directest</hi> road, as you will see by any map. I should therefore suppose that it was more probably the Royalist than the Parliament army, since Cold Ashby certainly lies between Borough Hill and Naseby. One story indeed yet extant at Cold Ashby tells of <hi rend="italic">both</hi> armies: that the Royalists were busy eating the good man&#x2019;s bacon at the Inn, in his absence: he returned suddenly, and the fellows asked him where the Rebels were: he said, close behind him: on which they decamped and he saved his bacon. / Between Cold Ashby and Guilsborough &#x2026; were found&#x2014;in a gravel pit&#x2014;two perfect skeletons of soldiers <hi rend="italic">sitting</hi>, rather hunched together: their helmets sticking to their skulls, and bits of chain (like curbs of bridles, I was told) still remaining&#x201D; (Terhune, <hi rend="italic">LEF</hi> 1:364&#x2013;65).</note> For Ireton with light horse hung all that Friday morning upon the King&#x2019;s rear, scuffling with them; finishing off his dayswork at Naseby, on Langdale&#x2019;s Northern Horse. It is as good as certain the King would go thro&#x2019; Cold Ashby,&#x2014;I suppose he was marching on <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the practicable roads that led up towards Harborough; Ireton keeping him close company on the main road. Ireton therefore we conclude was the saviour of the Ashby bacon: <hi rend="italic">he</hi> would not eat it without paying for it! The two <hi rend="italic">sitting</hi> skeletons of troopers would most likely be killed in this skirmishing pursuit;&#x2014;and the chance rather is, since they were <hi rend="italic">not stript</hi>, that they might be soldiers of his own; buried by their friends, pushed into any hole, and at least hidden from insult? Or perhaps <hi rend="italic">not</hi> so? One would have liked to see the traces of the inscription on their caps! The &#x201C;bridle-chains&#x201D; were probably chin-straps for keeping their helmets on.&#x2014; Fairfax, as I interpret, would not go thro&#x2019; either Thornby or Cold Ashby, on Saturday morning, from Guilsburough; but straight up by the nearest road and roads he could fall in with. He took two hours: from 3 till <pb id="pg-15-114" n="15:114"/>5 in the morning. By the way, there was no sermon at Naseby; but there were exhortations, prayers and psalm-singing: that text from Joshua may well enough have been in many mouths and hearts that morning.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >FitzGerald wrote, <date when="1842-09-27">27 Sept.</date>: &#x201C;They shew you a place in a field, a good deal to the North East of Naseby, a little out of the Clipstone road, where it is said the Parliament Army heard prayers and a sermon on the morning of the <date when="1645-06-14">14th</date>. The text was the 22nd verse of the 22nd Chapter of Joshua [&#x2018;The Lord God of gods &#x2026; he knoweth, and Israel he shall know; if it be in rebellion, or if in transgression against the Lord, (save us not this day)&#x2019;]&#x201D; (Terhune, <hi rend="italic">LEF</hi> 1:358).</note></p>
<p>On the whole I am really much gratified with the fruit of this little antiquarian campaign of yours; and have, for my own share, a real obligation to you for it. But a man who owns Naseby Field in <date when="1842-00-00">1842</date> ought verily to know what is knowable about that bit of ground in <date when="1645-00-00">1645</date>. Few more memorable spots are on the Earth&#x2019;s surface,&#x2014;I do not say England&#x2019;s surface alone: perhaps nowhere else in the world, at no other time in the world, was such a Host gathered together as that of Fairfax, with such a cause as theirs. Charles called them &#x201C;Rebels&#x201D;; but he was very far mistaken in that word. It was he, poor Scarecrow, that has been found now to have been <hi rend="italic">rebelling</hi>&#x2014;rebelling against God Almighty and the whole true Universe, little as he dreamt of that!&#x2014; &#x2014; Finally tho&#x2019; I advise no man to become an Author, I again say that if you drew up those details into due shape, and studying the matter effectually, made a Treatise of it, and printed it, you would do not ill, but <hi rend="italic">well</hi>. At all events I will preserve what you have written to me, as a valuable thing.</p>
<p>And so farewell till we meet again,&#x2014;if this is to be the last of Naseby at present.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >FitzGerald wrote, [<date when="1842-09-30">30 Sept.</date>]: &#x201C;You will hope, I think, that this is the last packet you will receive on the subject of Naseby: and I think it is&#x201D; (Terhune, <hi rend="italic">LEF</hi> 1:364). For TC&#x2019;s account of the battle, see <hi rend="italic">Cromwell, Works</hi> 6:210&#x2013;15, 9: 229&#x2013;31).</note> I will commend myself heartily to the brave Thackeray, Fitzboodle,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >One of Thackeray&#x2019;s many pseudonyms. FitzGerald wrote, [<date when="1842-09-30">30 Sept.</date>], that he meant to join Thackeray for a tour in Ireland.</note> or whatever he is called, and wish him and you a speedy reappearance here.&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>The companion of this Note should have been the forerunner of it; being written, in great haste, on Saturday afternoon; triumphantly carried out in my breast-pocket, and then&#x2014;forgotten till near seven o&#x2019;clock, when I pulled it out, seeking for my catalogue in an Old-Book shop in Holywell Street! Today I can add this to it; with a certificate that your last packet also has arrived,&#x2014;the button-seal unbroken, the sketch not injured by its journey.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1842-10-02">2 Sept. [Oct.]</date>.</note>&#x2014; You shall be appointed Topographer-General when I come to be King.</p>
<p>You have not sent me the Boy&#x2019;s name (Trooper-and-Cabbage-Yard Boy&#x2019;s<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-15/lt-18420929-TC-EF-01">TC to EF, <date when="1842-09-29">29 Sept.</date></ref></note>); but if you mark it down on paper, nothing will run away with it; and at present it is not in the least wanted. God knows if it ever will be, for any solid purpose&#x2014;alas, alas!</p>
<p>No Worsely or Ouseley that I can get trace of was present as a Colonel at Naseby.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >FitzGerald referred to &#x201C;Colonel Worseley&#x2019;s&#x2014;or, Colonel Ouseley&#x2019;s&#x2014;hill&#x201D; (Terhune, <hi rend="italic">LEF</hi> 1:371). Charles Worsley (<date when="1622-00-00">1622</date>&#x2013;<date when="1656-00-00">56</date>), capt. in the parliamentary army in <date when="1644-00-00">1644</date>, the year before Naseby; apptd. maj.-gen. by Cromwell, <date when="1655-00-00">1655</date>.</note> A Sir Charles Wolseley (ancestor, I think, of the present or late Ultra radical) gets himself occasionally named; and became ultimately one of Oliver&#x2019;s Council of State:<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sir Charles Wolseley (<date when="1630-00-00">1630</date>?&#x2013;<date when="1714-00-00">1714</date>), 2d bart.; Cromwellian politician, pardoned by Charles II. Sir Charles Wolseley (<date when="1769-00-00">1769</date>&#x2013;<date when="1846-00-00">1846</date>; <ref target="volume-15/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/29850"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), 7th bart., politician and reformer.</note> but (tho&#x2019; my <hi rend="italic">Sprigge</hi>, which contains a <hi rend="italic">List</hi> of Fairfax&#x2019;s Army, is gone back to Cambridge) I have little or no doubt he was <hi rend="italic">not</hi> a Colonel there, or at all there. The name therefore remains enigmatic. There was a Colonel Okey,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Okey (d. <date when="1662-00-00">1662</date>), col. of dragoons at Naseby; signed Charles I&#x2019;s death warrant, <date when="1649-00-00">1649</date>; with Cromwell in Scotland, <date when="1650-00-00">1650</date>; opposed Cromwell&#x2019;s protectorate; executed as a regicide.</note> future Regicide, formerly in &#x201C;Brewer&#x2019;s Stoker in Southwark,&#x201D; who might well enough have left his name: he stood in Langfordy Hedges with his dragoons; it was at his advance, with a sputtering of shot and other dangerous features of conduct, that the King&#x2019;s Horse broke finally away and fled. He was, I think, the most audacious fighter then going, on either side. Alas, I fear your country <hi rend="italic">Digamma</hi><note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >FitzGerald, referring to the sixth letter of the original Greek alphabet, had said about Worsley&#x2019;s name: &#x201C;one cannot make out which from the folks here, who have a sort of arbitrary Digamma, or Damned&#x2014;gabber, which has sent me wrong many times&#x201D; (Terhune, <hi rend="italic">LEF</hi> 1:371).</note> will not stretch to the length of Colonel <hi rend="italic">Okey</hi>; <pb id="pg-15-116" n="15:116"/>whose name it would have been interesting to find on that ground.</p>
<p>The buttons, I am very glad to consider as new or spurious; for the N.Y.I.,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;North York Infantry&#x201D;; see <ref target="volume-15/lt-18420924-TC-EF-01">TC to EF, <date when="1842-09-24">25 [24] Sept.</date></ref></note> indisputable there, is altogether unintelligible otherwise. The stamp indeed looks quite new; far too fresh to have lain two centuries. Besides I rather think they used horn-buttons in those days, and of far larger size.</p>
<p>The accounts of the number killed are very vague. The Parliament-Commissioners&#x2019; dispatch (written however that same evening) says, &#x201C;On the King&#x2019;s side 600, on ours not one hundred&#x201D;; Cromwell, also on the same evening, says Killed and taken about 5,000; which agrees with Chronicler Heath&#x2019;s account, that the number of Prisoners, marched off on the Monday from Harborough towards London, was 4,500. There is a list of all the officers taken. Perhaps 600 in all may be a fair guess for the number killed on both sides. Battles at that time were not fourth-part so deadly as now: their muskets were great clumsy things, with <hi rend="italic">rests</hi> to stick in the ground when you fired, bullets carried in your <hi rend="italic">mouth</hi> etc. I suppose a man with percussion-caps and cartridges could fire at least ten times as often in a given time. The number engaged at Naseby seems to have been about 10,000 on each side: the Parl<hi rend="italic">t</hi> took 8,000 stand of arms; and most of the Horse doubtless got off. The chase lasted thro&#x2019; Harborough, till within sight of Leicester steeple.&#x2014; By the by, the &#x201C;Little chair&#x201D; does not belong to Lubbenham; it and the &#x201C;little low room&#x201D; are at Harborough!<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >FitzGerald had said, [<date when="1842-09-30">30 Sept.</date>]: &#x201C;At Lubbenham (the next village to Marston) they have still the chair in which Charles sat&#x2014;in that Inn room&#x2014;the night before Naseby Battle&#x201D; (Terhune, <hi rend="italic">LEF</hi> 1:366).</note></p>
<p>Thanks heartily for your offer of the new column at Cloister-Well: it must decidedly be done, one day! But unless the very Fates forbid, I mean to be there with you next summer, when the Hills are all green again.</p>
<p>We had Spedding last night, home from Yankee-land; by whom and to whom was honourable mention of you.<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Spedding and FitzGerald had been friends since attending King Edward&#x2019;s School, Bury St. Edmunds, together.</note> He goes Northward in about a week. The Yankees have not discomposed him; nothing in this world can. He comes home raying forth the same quiet candid light,&#x2014;white light, or grey mildly contemplative twilight&#x2014;as when he went.&#x2014; <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, with best thanks,</salute></closer></p>

Let us take our spades, therefore, and become Potatoe Quixotes!&#x201D;&#x2014; When you have done with the Paper, can you send it to Cameron at Wakefield?<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Cameron. Emerson was to meet him in Liverpool in <date when="1847-00-00">1847</date> and describe him as a &#x201C;quite superior person &#x2026; , poor &#x26; now seeking employment&#x2014; &#x2026; known to Carlyle &#x26; Milnes,&#x201D; and &#x201C;the most erect &#x26; superior mind I have found here, &#x26; yet he, &#x26; all the rest of this company, are too deeply indebted to Carlyle&#x201D; (Rusk 3:438, 447).</note></p>

<p>Did you ever so much as fairly <hi rend="italic">visit</hi> the Field of Marston-Moor Battle? Does anybody know precisely the spot; are there any graves left, any &#x26;c &#x26;c?

<p>The good Harriet Martineau seems to have been raised to the third heaven or higher by your visit to her: that was well done.</p>
<p>As for me, I solicit your prayers; and need them; I am swimming as in reedy Ouse streams,<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Ouse flows out of the Cromwell country in a winding course E and NE into the Wash below King&#x2019;s Lynn.</note> bottomless quagmires, hardly the nose visible; and shall apparently be sunk and out of pain by &#x26; by.<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC was once more in despair about writing on Cromwell, as shown by his remarks on Forster MS 97r.: &#x201C;<date when="1842-10-05">Wednesday 5 Oct<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, 1842</date>&#x2014; No son of Adam is more helpless than I; the <hi rend="italic">word</hi> sticking in my throat, no bringing of it up; the matter all unutterable!

Coll., London, <date when="1847-00-00">1847</date>&#x2013;<date when="1858-00-00">58</date>; after <date when="1848-00-00">1848</date> lived and worked in both Italy and England. For Mazzini&#x2019;s unsympathetic account of him, see Mazzini, <hi rend="italic">Life and Writings</hi> (<date when="1864-00-00">1864</date>) 1:347&#x2013;54.</note> left London on the <date when="1842-08-13">13 <pb id="pg-15-119" n="15:119"/>of August</date> on what one may call a fool&#x2019;s errand! Mariotti huffed at Gambardella&#x2019;s want of Pylades-like<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Gallenga and Gambardella were friends. Pylades was the cousin and close friend of Orestes, and their names are proverbial for friendship.</note> <foreign><hi rend="italic">empressment</hi></foreign> in writing to him had instructed Count Pepoli to get from the said Gambardella&#x2014;&#x201C;every paper for him which should find itself in G&#x2019;s possession and forward them to his new address&#x201D;&#x2014; Of course Gambardella gave him Lady Byron&#x2019;s letter<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Anne Isabella, b.

Anna Jameson and Lady Byron had met in <date when="1834-00-00">1834</date> and were close friends. She had apparently sent Gallenga &#xa3;5 for the school; see <ref target="volume-15/lt-18421024-JWC-ABJ-01">JWC to ABJ, [<date when="1842-10-24">24 Oct.</date>]</ref>.</note> containing the five pounds, suggesting however that perhaps it were more rational to send it back to Lady Byron <hi rend="italic">direct</hi>, than <hi rend="italic">via</hi> nuova scotia&#x2014; But Pepoli, as his wife phrases it, &#x201C;rides on the rigging&#x201D;&#x2014;which means&#x2014;in case you do not know&#x2014;would do every thing perfectly and <hi rend="italic">a little more than perfectly</hi>&#x2014;and so he insisted on adhereing literally to Mariotti&#x2019;s directions&#x2014; All the sense his wife could put into his head about it, was that he should send money thro&#x2019; a Banker&#x2019;s order that in case of its being no more heard of <hi rend="italic">he</hi> might not be suspected of having been trying his hand at a little <hi rend="italic">swindling!</hi></p>
<p>All this was communicated to me this morning before I was out of bed!&#x2014;to be sure I did not rise till one oclock having got a heavy cold&#x2014; Gambardella who was here by half after nine (!) to answer in person a note I had sent him last night, did not exactly penetrate to my bedroom, but left a message with my cousin, and Madame Pepoli came soon after to tell me that G. had been there at half after eight, to make Pepoli give him a receipt for the money, to give to me, to give to you, to give to lady Byron!&#x2014;indeed the whole transaction has gone on thro&#x2019; out very much on the principle of <hi rend="italic">the house that Jack built!</hi></p>
<p>I am glad however that Gambardella whom I really think well of is exonerated of the charge of&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">unpunctuality</hi>&#x2014;to speak mildly&#x2014; The thing wore a very awkward appearance to me, and I take credit to myself for having cleared it up for him without giving any offence&#x2014;or at least very little&#x2014;to his pride which is equal to Lucifer&#x2019;s&#x2014; The Italian school<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mazzini had founded the evening school for organ grinders in <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>, and, with the help of English friends, gave much time to it and to raising funds.

To devote these two hours to study instead is a great deal for them, and their coming like this speaks well for the Italian nature&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Mazzini&#x2019;s Letters</hi>, ed.

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Three Numbers of your <hi rend="italic">Boon&#x2019;s-Lick Farmer</hi>, and the Letter you
write me on the <date when="1842-05-10">10<hi rend="italic">th</hi> of May</date> last from the uttermost West, are lying safe this morning in my Letter-box.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In his letter from Boonville, <date when="1842-05-10">10 May</date>, Ormrod wrote: &#x201C;Sir, I write to you without the slightest personal knowledge or introduction of any kind, other than you see. I have nothing to offer in the shape of an apology for liberty-taking &#x26;c, I will only say that the impulse has just now been felt by me to do so, and to send you a sheet or two of an humble journal which I have recently projected and am engaged in editing. I am attempting in a poor and obscure way to do in my limited sphere, a little of what you are, as I think, effecting to some extent, upon a much larger theatre of action, and with far other powers&#x2014;that is, to divert men&#x2019;s minds, in some measure, from the false, the material, and the gross, and direct them to other pursuits and contemplations more worthy of their nature,&#x2014;a great task in this frivolous age. / I am living among a rather hard-favored and unimpressible race, who possess but little <hi rend="italic">reverence</hi>. &#x2026; Yet there are a few,&#x2014;and I have encouragement enough perhaps of that kind to induce me to continue my efforts. &#x2026; I have selected an agricultural journal as the medium through which I could, here, best disseminate the kind of matter which my prelections are composed of,&#x2014;to convey my sentiments insidiously as it were, to my readers, when off their guard. / I am an Englishman &#x2026; resident in the United States more than twenty years . &#x2026; / I am now living upon a farm, and have some leisure which I use as you see. My opportunities for education have been slender.&#x201D;</note> We have a much improved &#x201C;universal Penny-post&#x201D; in England, since you quitted us; Postmen, like miraculous unseen messengers, dropping-in news on us, thro&#x2019; the slits in our doors, from far and near: indeed all Post-offices, with their written missives faithfully threading their way over desarts, over <pb id="pg-15-121" n="15:121"/>oceans, thro&#x2019; crowded cities, confused nations,&#x2014;are among the mira-miracle, something withal in your figure, position, and way of <foreign>adcles</foreign> of our modern world! There is something in this individual dress, that induces me to do what, alas, is seldom in my power in such cases: send a written word of answer.</p>
<p>I respect much the history you give me: that of a manful Worker valiantly cutting a way for himself, valiantly struggling on, to the place and work where you now find yourself. Properly there is but one man, as I often say, who is worthy of respect in this world: he that can work at something. The old Monks had a proverb, &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Laborare est orare</hi></foreign>, To work is to pray&#x201D;; the meaning of which goes far deeper than they perhaps were aware of. He that works well and nobly, not as a slave for mere money-hire, but as a man withal and in the spirit of a man, he, if any, is in real communication with his Unseen Author, making a perpetual pious appeal to the Invisible Powers of this Universe,&#x2014;which respond to him, if he is faithful. You cannot raise wheat, if you have no <hi rend="italic">virtue</hi>, no heroism at all: how much less teach men, conquer men, teach or conquer yourself!</p>
<p>I bid you therefore heartily, Go on and prosper. There is in your Paper a rugged practical veracity which ought to be approved of. The thing you yourself have <hi rend="italic">found</hi> true, continue to tell all other men that it <hi rend="italic">is</hi> actually true: who has a better right to &#x201C;tell&#x201D; anything than such a man? Standing by that text, you cannot but do good. Exactly in proportion as you stand by it, will be the real good you do:&#x2014;the imaginary momentary &#x201C;good&#x201D; you do, which the vulgar call &#x201C;success&#x201D; &#x26;c &#x26;c, is of small moment in comparison.</p>
<p><closer><salute>And so from the heart of crowded London I send you back your greeting into the Solitudes of the West; and, in great haste, but with all cordiality, bid you Good-Speed.</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Forgive me if I put you off again with one of the shortest of Letters; a mere line to tell you how we are, to ask how you are!</p>
<p>Yesterday I sent off the Dumfries Newspaper to Jack, that he might consult the Steamboat Advertisement: he said he meant to go &#x201C;next week&#x201D;; I think Tuesday or else Thursday (the latter likelier) may possibly be enough be his day. So on Friday next you may all meet again;&#x2014;a happy meeting to all of you!</p>
<p>Today I enclose you, dear Mother, this little Five-pound Note; which is intended to buy you a <hi rend="italic">suit of winter clothes</hi>. You are not to neglect doing that, remember! I cannot understand here what to get you, so well as you there can choose for yourself.</p>
<p>Jane has got an unlucky cold which plagues her somewhat for the week past: neither is it yet away; but I hope it will depart before long. Little &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Cousin</hi> Jeannie&#x201D; has a cold too: we are an unsound set of people!&#x2014; As for me I complain not of health; but terribly of <hi rend="italic">stupidity</hi>, of the inability to get on with work! I must <hi rend="italic">bore</hi> away; there is nothing else for me whatever. It will be long, long before I get any <hi rend="italic">mark</hi> made on the job: but at length one must and will get into it.</p>
<p>This morning a singular American Letter with three big Newspapers<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >From Joseph Ormrod.</note> lay in the Letter-box: the writer seemingly a rather curious man. The Letter is here. You can keep it till Jack come; then let him burn it. The writer dates from the very bottom of the Western wilderness; almost as far beyond New York, as New York is beyond us! It is curious how a small scrape of a pen will travel. I wrote the poor man a syllable of encouragement back; I will not write any more to him.</p>
<p>It gives us great pleasure to hear of Jamie&#x2019;s harvest: we shall need a little morsel of meal by and bye;&#x2014;I think rather <hi rend="italic">less</hi> perhaps than last year, for we are falling off from supper somewhat, and often enough sup only on a cup of hot milk.&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; Remember me in unabated affection to Alick, to all the rest, of whom daily I have kind recollection,&#x2014;kinder than any <hi rend="italic">words</hi>.</p>
<p><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Mother. When Jack comes I shall expect plentiful news from all of you. Good be ever with you!</p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>It is a good sign of you that you are set &#x201C;a-rolling&#x201D;; I bid you, Roll, roll!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >FitzGerald wrote of his labors for TC, <date when="1842-10-09">9 Oct.</date>: &#x201C;You see what it is when once you set a Dilettante to work. &#x2018;You have set a dangerous stone a rolling.&#x2019; But now I am about it, I will do what I can&#x201D; (Terhune, <hi rend="italic">LEF</hi> 1:378).</note> There ought to be a correct, complete, and everyway <hi rend="italic">right</hi> and authentic Essay, or little Book, written about Naseby as it now is and as it <hi rend="italic">then</hi> seems to have been,&#x2014;with the utmost possible distinctness, succinctness, energy, accuracy and available talent of every sort:&#x2014;I leave you to consider, Whether the actual Owner and Heaven&#x2019;s-Steward of Naseby ought to have no hand in that!</p>
<p>As to the Pamphlets at Northampton,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >FitzGerald also told TC, <date when="1842-10-09">9 Oct.</date>, that there was soon to be a sale in Northampton of books and curiosities about Northamptonshire, listed some items of interest, and asked whether TC would like him to leave any bids when he went through Northampton on his way to London.</note> they are not very momentous, and will all be dreadfully dull reading, yet to a Northamptonshire man, I should think that first especially (N<hi rend="italic">o</hi> 1158, &#x201C;Fairfax&#x2019;s Orders at Northamp<hi rend="italic">n</hi>&#x201D;), and the two &#x201C;accounts of Naseby,&#x201D; might be worth something. The usual price of such pamphlets, in the old shops here, is from half-a-crown to 5/ apiece; they come sometimes as low as 1/ or 1/6;&#x2014;but you can not always find them when you want them. Suppose you offer half a crown for each of the three; with instructions to rise to the sublimity of five shillings for the <hi rend="italic">first</hi>, if it can not otherwise be had?&#x2014; The rest, &#x201C;Desires of the Army&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >I.e., requests or petitions.</note> &#x26;c, are in <hi rend="italic">Rushworth</hi> and elsewhere, <foreign><hi rend="italic">usque ad nauseam</hi></foreign> [even to nausea], considering what terrible stuff they are. &#x201C;St. John&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">speeches</hi>&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Oliver St. John (<date when="1598-00-00">1598</date>?&#x2013;<date when="1673-00-00">1673</date>), chief justice during the Commonwealth.</note> and the like,&#x2014;avoid them as you would the ooze of Lethe!&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; &#x201C;Fairfax at Northampton in <date when="1646-01-00">january 1646</date>&#x201D; (which means <date when="1647-00-00">1647</date>, for in those days the new-year did not begin till <date when="1647-03-24">24<hi rend="italic">th</hi> March</date>) must mean, Fairfax going up to meet the King, now about setting forth from Newcastle to Holdenby; whom Fairfax did meet about ten days later or more, somewhere on the road southward.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <hi rend="italic">Cromwell, Works</hi> 6:258.</note> It will be a dirty little dumpy <foreign>quarto</foreign> pamphlet, of the dreariest dim brown, and the purport and substance of it not less dreary; but being an <hi rend="italic">official</hi> piece, and offered now to the Proprietor of Naseby, and &#x26;c &#x26;c? On the whole, I think, you may venture five shillings! <pb id="pg-15-124" n="15:124"/>All these things are nearly sure to be in the British Museum; indeed as good as altogether sure.&#x2014; Of Nichol&#x2019;s Leicestershire or the other County History<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Nichols, <hi rend="italic">The History and Antiquities of the County of Leicester</hi>, 8 vols.

He lifted off each <hi rend="italic">cann</hi> or case, opened the lid of it, and, having emptied it, hung it on again by the hook.

<salute>Dear Jamie,</salute>
<p>I am very glad to hear of you again; happy that you have got your harvest over, and a better harvest than you have had for a good many years back. Let us hope, it may be the beginning of a <hi rend="italic">set</hi> of better ones! Certainly there is much need of them:&#x2014; But we ought to be thankful for what we have already got.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, I think, there would a small Letter come from me for my Mother: I must write you a word today about that kind cargo of butter and meal which you have made ready for us. The business part of it will not be ill to discuss. We do indeed begin to <hi rend="italic">grudge</hi> eating up a yearly firkin of Isabella&#x2019;s good butter! But that part of the discussion can be reserved for another time.</p>
<p>We will take four stone of meal: that, I think, was our last years quantity; and that has sufficed us,&#x2014;for there are a few pounds still extant here at present. I am falling rather away from <hi rend="italic">supper</hi> altogether within the last year: do what we can, the dinner hour is sinking <hi rend="italic">later;</hi> coming towards Six o&#x2019;clock, the unnatural hour of London; at which, as I sometimes predict, it will have to arrive, one day! However, we cannot be beaten with four stone of meal: I am even deciding on having some cakes baked; which would easily swallow that or a larger quantity. Four stone will do. And as to the time of sending it,&#x2014; The sooner the better. My shirts here are getting totally done; I shall be glad of Jenny&#x2019;s new ones whenever they can be laid hold of. Our Mother&#x2019;s Picture too is coming. Perhaps it will be easier that all these articles go in one batch N<hi rend="italic">o</hi> 1, N<hi rend="italic">o</hi> 2 or even N<hi rend="italic">o</hi> 3, if you find it good to make three packages. The sooner you can gather them all, and send them off by the Steamer, it will be the better. I have already written to Dumfries, explaining that the Picture is to be framed <hi rend="italic">here;</hi> they have only to get a small deal case to put it in;&#x2014;indeed, I should expect, it was all ready by this time. The Doctor will write you three addresses or two, when he comes, which must be very shortly as I compute, sooner than <hi rend="italic">you</hi> seemed to be expecting him. My notion was that he would sail either today (Tuesday), or else the day after tomorrow.</p>
<p>Jane&#x2019;s cold is decidedly better today: I hope she is not going to break down with the beginning of winter, poor weak little dame! She is not strong, but is gradually settling herself to be as strong as she was.&#x2014; I think I told you, a while ago, that all that Duke concern is <pb id="pg-15-126" n="15:126"/>now settled: that I have got the money, &#x201C;thanked&#x201D; the illustrious Graces and finished off with them handsomely forever and a day.</p>
<p>Our little Cousin goes away this week. A Liverpool Cousin of hers, a young &#x201C;Walter M&#x2019;Gregor,&#x201D; is come up on business at present; and it had from of old been settled that he was to take her home again. She is very <foreign><hi rend="italic">wae</hi></foreign> to go, poor little thing, and would much rather stay here than go back to the greasy stupidity of Liverpool again: but what remedy? She is one of the sweetest-tempered, best-conditioned, nice little creatures I have ever been near: it seems to me very strange nobody has yet picked her up for a wife, for she is decidedly a little Beauty withal!</p>
<p>One does not see here, in our circle of life, much of the practical distress that weighs on the people; yet enough of it exists here, which nobody can <hi rend="italic">help</hi> seeing: a most melancholy sight to every living fellow-man. The suffering in the Lancashire region, indeed everywhere in the trading world, continues, as we now hear, altogether unabated, likely to grow worse and worse; the outlook for the winter is by no means a cheering one to Corn-Law Governments! Poor Sir Robert Peel cannot do much; but if I were in his place, I think I should say, Friends either permit me to do <hi rend="italic">some</hi> actual thing, not a set of mere sham imaginary things; or else behold I withdraw, and altogether <hi rend="italic">decline from</hi> it!&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; &#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; Potatoes here sell at present at 6 pence for the 5 lbs, or 5 pence for the 6 pounds, I forget which: some 10 shillings a hundred-weight: that is a price you could pay a rent with! They are very bad potatoes too; but the Scotch ones will get in now, from Perth &#x26; Fife.</p>
<p>The Doctor will give Isabella his best advice: but I suppose no Doctor or medical treatment can really be of much help to her; she will find her only resource in <hi rend="italic">regimen</hi>, diet and general management of herself, which tho&#x2019; slower is a far surer resource.</p>
<p>This inclosed Note is from an American Parliamenter (a Senator, I half guess):<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> I have appointed the worthy man tomorrow at <hi rend="italic">half past two</hi>, when my days work, such as it is, will be done. We had another American last night, called Longfellow, &#x201C;Professor Longfellow,&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henry Wadsworth Longfellow (<date when="1807-00-00">1807</date>&#x2013;<date when="1882-00-00">82</date>), poet, prof. of mod. langs. and lit. at Harvard, <date when="1836-00-00">1836</date>; see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18401200-TC-HWL-01"><sic>12:379</sic><corr>TC to HWL, <date when="1840-12-31">31 Dec. 1840</date></corr></ref>.

<p>Well, here is scribbling enough. I commend myself affectionately to our good Mother, and to one and all. Tell my Mother I will send <pb id="pg-15-127" n="15:127"/>her a better Letter before long. Remember me to Alick, whom I never forget.&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; Do not despair of the Turnips!</p>

<salute>Dear Miss Jewsbury,</salute>
<p>Your two savoury Gifts, redolent with noble bitter fragrance, are both here. Thanks to you for remembering me in that way,&#x2014;in any way. I will keep the &#x201C;two tobaccos&#x201D; (as our tavern-waiters say) very carefully, and only use a little of them on great occasions. The <hi rend="italic">Cavendish</hi> used to be well known to me, the other choice sort is a stranger:&#x2014;alas, on the whole, I have long quitted the vain hunt after choice tobacco,&#x2014;would to Heaven one could even get <hi rend="italic">honest</hi> commonplace York-returns<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >York tobacco, named after York River, Virginia; &#x201C;returns&#x201D; are tobacco fragments, siftings or shag returned for recutting. In a doubtfully dated letter to JWC (Ireland 92&#x2013;95) Jewsbury wrote: &#x201C;I humbly beg to make an offering of a morsel of &#x2018;Cavendish&#x2019; which I had given me yesterday, and which I have cut and prepared my own self.&#x201D; It follows protestations of her love, and: &#x201C;Carlyle is magnificent, and you are not wasted upon him. &#x2026; He is much too grand for everyday life. A sphinx does not fit in comfortably to your parlour-life arrangements, but seen from a proper point of view it is a supernaturally grand thing! You must feel proud of belonging to him after all, and he deserves to have you; Mortal praise can go no higher. &#x2026; Write to me, dear love. &#x2026; You cannot tell me too much.&#x201D;</note> tobacco!
But that too is impossible; impossible as &#x201C;happiness&#x201D; itself is: wherefore, in later times, I have resigned myself to <hi rend="italic">dis</hi>honest York-returns, adulterated with &#x201C;sugar,&#x201D; with&#x2014;the Devil and the Smuggler and the Thousand-per-cent Taxgatherer know what; and have said, and mournfully soliloquized, &#x201C;Well then, I will smoke <hi rend="italic">bad</hi> tobacco for the remaining years of my life; but it shall be in composure, and without Ernulphus-cursing<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Tristram Shandy</hi> bk. 3, chs. 10, 11, 12.</note> of it any more!&#x201D;&#x2014; &#x2014; Seriously, I could get abundant affliction out of all these things, did I <hi rend="italic">not</hi> resign myself. I enter no shop for any article of human industry whatever, but I see in the poor false stare of a shopkeeper, in the flimsy, ever-shifting, edge-gilt and inwardly rotten condition of all the wares he has, an emblem of the whole ruin of those wretched Quack Ages,&#x2014;fast hastening (as you may see in Manchester and else where) into some kind of Fire-bath even now: either a <hi rend="italic">refining</hi> Furnace (which <pb id="pg-15-128" n="15:128"/>indeed I hope and know), or else into that <hi rend="italic">other</hi> Furnace, which shall be nameless,&#x2014;for the Earth, grown weary and grown sulky, cannot be burdened with them much longer! Here is a &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Thus</hi> think and smoke Tobacco&#x201D; for you! All men would laugh at me, even you would laugh, did I express what thoughts any one of those things will awaken in me:&#x2014;thoughts therefore which &#x201C;it is interesting <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to state,&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech.</note> but to shut up in one&#x2019;s improved Dutch tobacco-box, and keep safe there!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Jane has had a cold, not yet entirely gone; and is still in weak case, but gradually gathering strength and composure, as I hope.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Another Jewsbury letter (Ireland 72&#x2013;74; wrongly dated <date when="1843-00-00">1843</date>?) refers to this one: &#x201C;When Mr. Carlyle wrote he said you had a cold,&#x201D; and begs for a letter from JWC.</note> Our good little cousin returns to Liverpool this week.</p>
<p>As for me, I am down among the Ghosts and Infernal Gods, in the deep places of <hi rend="small-caps">Chaos</hi>; uncertain whether ever I shall get up to air and utterance again or not,&#x2014;most likely <hi rend="italic">not</hi>. Oliver Cromwell has long been a <hi rend="italic">ghost;</hi> and the very gods withstand his taking body again! I have wished a hundred times I had never heard of him, for my part.</p>
<p><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Miss Jewsbury. I wish I could help you in your brave life-battle; but I cannot; nobody can. Stand to it yourself, with courage, truthfulness, above all with that far hardest kind of courage&#x2014;patience. When one is miserable, one in very truth <hi rend="italic">ought</hi> to say: &#x201C;Well then; it is <hi rend="italic">well!</hi>&#x201D; A great instruction lies in that; the highest sort of instruction. I send you my blessings, if they were good for anything.</p>

In an undated entry (<date when="1842-10-25">25 Oct.</date>?) in his Journal, TC wrote: &#x201C;Read Jocelin de Brakelonda&#x2019;s Chronicle (St. Edmundsbury Monk); worth something. &#x2026; A curious old world that monk one.&#x201D; JWC speaks of TC&#x2019;s reading &#x201C;the old Latin book&#x201D; in <ref target="volume-15/lt-18421017-JWC-JW-01">JWC to JW, [<date when="1842-10-17">17 Oct.</date>]</ref>. (The Camden Society had been founded <date when="1838-00-00">1838</date> to publish documents on early British history and literature). Forster MS f.56v. gives, in the first third of the page, what were probably TC&#x2019;s first attempts to write about &#x201C;Jocelin of Edmundsbury,&#x201D; as he headed this draft; and this makes clear that in the <date when="1842-10-00">first half of Oct.</date> he was trying to write (as on the previous side) what he always misleadingly called Cromwell&#x2019;s first letter (To Mr. Storie, <date when="1635-01-11">11 Jan. 1635</date>). He was eventually to return to this, which might have been a turning-point in his deciding how to write about Cromwell and his times; but, for the present, he was deflected in the direction of <hi rend="italic">Past and Present</hi>.</note> was about the most entertaining piece of Antiquarianism I remember to have read. Another like it, so soon as may be!</p>

<salute>My dear Jean,</salute>
<p>On Saturday night late the Picture arrived by our Chelsea Carrier! The entire charge for carriage between you and us was but 7/4,&#x2014;one of the cheapest freights I remember. Discerning well what the big square Box contained, we made all the haste consistent with the safety of the contents to open it; in few minutes we got in to the linen or cotton cloth, to Janes&#x2019;s<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> pertinent judicious direction, and then in an instant more to the Picture itself! A general exclamation of approval was the instantaneous result. We have seldom any of us seen a more successful likeness: it far surpasses all we expected; we are truly glad to have got the business so satisfactorily managed,&#x2014;and doubt not but you and James too are now of that opinion; to whose care and judgement <pb id="pg-15-130" n="15:130"/>such result, we know well enough, is mainly due. Nothing whatsoever, to the smallest fibre of the package, had gone wrong. I have carried the Picture, still sticking by its screws to the bottom of the Box, up stairs; and have it here standing against the light on two chairs: my good old Mother exactly as she looks; with her air of embarrassed <foreign><hi rend="italic">blateness</hi></foreign> [bashfulness], yet of energy, intelligence and true affection; my good old Mother!&#x2014; Jane approves much the whole performance; the <hi rend="italic">fashion</hi> of the cap &#x26;c as well as the drawing of it: I know the very <hi rend="italic">hands</hi>, the portrait of the shawl &#x26;c: thanks to you, to the brave Painter and you!&#x2014; One insignificant criticism is as yet all we have been able to make out against it: that the figure in the chair (owing to some small want of a stroke of colour somewhere about the bottom of the dress) seems hardly to <hi rend="italic">sit</hi> in the chair, but rather somehow to be <hi rend="italic">standing;</hi>&#x2014;a most minute fault; which will not be noticeable at all when the Picture is once framed and hung up. Jane is to set about that final plain department of the business this very day.</p>
<p>Pray send me an account of the Flannel that I may know what money I do owe you.&#x2014; James must make my compliments to the Painter, my thanks; and say that we esteem him to possess a real genius for painting;&#x2014;and do earnestly and solemnly charge him <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to waste it away in that devil&#x2019;s-quagmire of whiskey, but to stand up to his task like a man, <hi rend="italic">shirking</hi> no difficulty, fearing no evil or pain; and he may yet find far nobler results in it than heretofore!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >According to A. Carlyle, Maxwell d. soon afterward from drink.</note></p>
<p><title>&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;</title></p>
<p>The Doctor, as we infer from certain Liverpool tidings, must be at Scotsbrig since Friday last. The little Cousin went away last night; she very sad, we too made sad. I have seldom seen a cheerier daintier better-conditioned little woman.&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; By the next Steamer to Annan will come, to Alick&#x2019;s care, a kind of <hi rend="italic">Tobacco-box</hi> for James! It is an apparatus for smoking when one is on a journey: let him laugh when he sees it! My complaints of inability to work &#x26;c need not be <hi rend="italic">repeated</hi> today. I must quit you without more words. Blessings with you and yours, dear Jane. Send me the smallest note about the Flannel.</p>

<dateline>Monday [<date when="1842-10-17">17 October 1842</date>]</dateline>
<salute>My dear good Child</salute>
<p>To think that yesterday I was looking at you, speaking to you, holding your bits of hands in mine, and that today I am <hi rend="italic">writing to you</hi>&#x2014;with two hundred milestones betwixt us! It is one of those things which one does not realize to oneself just at once! Every time the door opens I fancy you should come in, and you do not come in!&#x2014;will not come in any more&#x2014;for a while!&#x2014;and the house looks sad and strange&#x2014;and I do not know very well what to make of myself this foggy day&#x2014;</p>
<p>Carlyle&#x2019;s manner of consoling me after you drove away was characteristic&#x2014; He fell to pronouncing an exceedingly long and eloquent eulogy on you&#x2014;particularizing every thing from your &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">fine instinctive sense</hi>&#x201D; to the &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">daintiness</hi>&#x201D; of your person &#x26; winding up with a prophetic felicitation to <hi rend="italic">the man</hi> who should get you for his wife! Very gratifying for me to hear under ordinary circumstances&#x2014;but just then it sounded rather too much like a funeral oration!&#x2014;and I was not sorry when he resumed his reading of the old Latin book.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably the <hi rend="italic">Chronica Jocelini de Brakelonda</hi>. But TC&#x2019;s Journal, <date when="1842-10-25">25 Oct.</date>, shows that he had also been reading <hi rend="italic">The Chronicle of William de Rishanger of the Baron&#x2019;s Wars</hi>, ed. James Orchard Halliwell (<date when="1840-00-00">1840</date>), and John Selden&#x2019;s edn. of <hi rend="italic">Eadmeri monachi Cantuariensis Historiae Novorum, Sive sui Saeculi Libri VI</hi> (<date when="1623-00-00">1623</date>): &#x201C;Read Rishanger&#x2019;s Chronicle (a Camden-Society Book in very bad Latin) of Simon de Montfort&#x2019;s wars; unintelligible or next to it; ill edited: worth nothing at all. &#x2026; <hi rend="italic">Eadmer</hi> (by Selden, well edited, incorrectly printed) is also a monk-chronicle, worth its paper and ink.&#x201D;</note></p>
<p>How I envy people who have the gift of putting all that they think and feel into words! Who never <hi rend="italic">lose their voice</hi>, literally or figuratively, whatever becomes of them! But this power of utterance is a greater blessing to the people themselves than to those about them&#x2014;witness Helen! how often one wishes her struck dumb for the next twenty four hours!&#x2014; This morning she spent I am sure a whole hour in removing the breakfast things, that she might have repeated <hi rend="italic">flys at me</hi> with her Job&#x2019;s comfort&#x2014; &#x201C;Poor thing! I wonder what sort of night she had? I never saw a sweeter Cretur&#x201D;!&#x2014; &#x201C;Isn&#x2019;t it a pity mem but Miss Welsh were nearer&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">for</hi> it&#x2019;s quite surprising how fond she is about you?&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">and</hi> she left half a crown with me to give the Postman&#x2014; I am sure he&#x2019;ll wonder! <hi rend="italic">So</hi> you see She behaved uncommon genteel&#x201D;!&#x2014; I flew up stairs to be out of the road of her&#x2014;and when I came back&#x2014;she emerged out of the China Closet saying as she crossed the floor&#x2014; &#x201C;Poor thing&#x2014; The last thing she said to me was to take good care of <pb id="pg-15-132" n="15:132"/>cousin&#x201D;! You can fancy how all this worrys me&#x2014; Today too we have the worst fog that has been this year&#x2014;just as if it had kept off till you were out of the road of it&#x2014; And Carlyle has already <hi rend="italic">three times</hi> this morning requested I would &#x201C;take <hi rend="italic">immediate</hi> steps about getting that picture framed&#x201D; and finally I had a bad night and my head achs&#x2014;&#x201C;and altogether&#x201D; as the Dumfries Courier says &#x201C;the time is out of joint,&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi> 1.5.</note> for me&#x2014; There is a frightful proposition about the picture that it should be hung over <hi rend="italic">this</hi> mantlepiece to the sweeping away of all my dear little ornaments!! &#x26; to the utter destruction of <hi rend="italic">my privacy</hi>&#x2014;for I could never feel alone with that picture over me!&#x2014; I almost screamed at the notion&#x2014;but fortunately che<supplied>[c]</supplied>ked<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> myself in time; as a passionate resistance would have clenched the matter&#x2014; I merely suggested that it could not be seen to advantage&#x2014;when hung so near one&#x2014;as it would necessarily be in this small division of a room&#x2014;so it is to be hoped it will still go up stairs&#x2014;</p>
<p>I will not write any more just now&#x2014;for I am not well enough for writing to any other purpose than the momentary gratification of my own feelings of loneliness&#x2014; In truth my babbie I feel <hi rend="italic">very</hi> lonely without thee&#x2014;nevertheless since you were to go; I am thankful you are gone!&#x2014;just as, had I made up my mind to having an arm or leg cut off, I should be thankful the operation was well over&#x2014; No letters this morning but one from Cordelia Marshall (M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Whewell) another of the <hi rend="italic">in</hi>articulate people of this world&#x2014;never able to give themselves fair play&#x2014;</p>
<p>You will write to me a great deal my dear little Sister till we meet again?&#x2014;and you will love me, more in proportion to the goodness of your own trustful heart than my deserving&#x2014; Remember me to them all with kindest regards&#x2014;</p>

<p>You did well to write, my poor Babbie even before taking a wink of sleep! for I should have been greatly disappointed had I not heard from you yesterday&#x2014; Tho nothing had been settled about the <hi rend="italic">when</hi> <pb id="pg-15-133" n="15:133"/>at parting&#x2014;indeed it were difficult to say what <hi rend="italic">was</hi> settled at parting&#x2014;I calculated on a letter from you yesterday with as much certainty as on the sun&#x2019;s rising&#x2014;or <hi rend="italic">more</hi> certainly; for the sun I think has ceased rising of late days&#x2014; Your letter however made me very <foreign><hi rend="italic">wae</hi></foreign> in picturing your physical state!&#x2014;had it been me; a violent headach of twelve hours duration must have been the inevitable and mortifying issue of that amazing fluency of speech and noble disdain of sleep&#x2014;but you I think do not (as Carlyle phrases it) &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">go upon</hi>&#x201D; headachs&#x2014;so perhaps you have escaped the reaction, at least in that its most torturing shape&#x2014; Having finished writing to you on Monday I went about a while, very much in the condition of the &#x201C;<foreign>wee</foreign> woman who lived in a shoe&#x201D;&#x2014;not knowing the least in the world &#x201C;what to do&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Nursery rhyme.</note>&#x2014; Finally I got up a resolution to set forth in an omnibus and call for M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Buller&#x2014; I had just got my bonnet and shawl on when Helen brought me up a card bearing the distinguished name of D<hi rend="italic">r Hunter</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. Adam Hunter of Leeds, her second cousin; see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370620-TC-JCHA-01"><sic>9:232</sic><corr>TC to JCHA, <date when="1837-06-20">20 June 1837</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014;strange fatality!&#x2014;on the first day of finding myself without one cousin, had Providence provided me in another? and <hi rend="italic">such</hi> another! or was it the D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Hunter whom John had brought us?<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably Dr. Jacob Hunter, identified from <ref target="volume-19/lt-18450607-TC-JBO-01">TC to <sic>James Booth</sic><corr>JBO</corr>, <date when="1845-06-07">7 June 1845</date></ref>, where said to be of 70 Upper Berkeley St., Portman Sq.</note>&#x2014; I hurried down not without a certain tremor&#x2014;and behold, him of Leeds sure enough! but so altered!&#x2014;thin, bent, feeble, and in the act of unmuzzling himself from a <hi rend="italic">respirator</hi>&#x2014; His first words were characteristic&#x2014; &#x201C;Do not be alarmed my dear Lady&#x2014;!
    at least do not alarm yourself <hi rend="italic">too much!</hi> I am not so ill as I seem!&#x201D; But to do the poor fellow justice, he seemed, after having got the first meeting over, considerably more concerned about my appearance than he even <hi rend="italic">expected me</hi> to be about <hi rend="italic">his!</hi> It was plain to the meanest capacity that he considered me a pretty way gone in consumption&#x2014; &#x201C;Dear!

This is not as it should be!&#x201D;&#x2014;and then he gave his head a great many slow prophetic shakes&#x2014; He told Carlyle that his own spitting of blood (in quarts!)&#x2014;was all brought on by over excitement&#x2014;had nothing to do with consumption&#x2014;(poor unfortunate!)&#x2014;&#x201C;for tho,&#x201D; he added, with <hi rend="italic">a courteous bow towards me</hi>, &#x201C;tho there is a strong consumptive tendency in <hi rend="italic">this</hi> family it all came by old M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Welsh&#x2019;s side&#x201D;!!

The fact was, the seeing of him&#x2014;absurd ass tho&#x2019; he be, had thrown me into a sort of agitation and I hardly knew my right hand from my left&#x2014;so I recommended him to Providence at that point&#x2014;and stept myself into an Omnibus returning from town&#x2014;but <hi rend="italic">whither</hi> it was returning I did not stop to enquire, and after carrying me a hundred yards it set me down in Sloan Square!! I felt really altogether ashamed of myself&#x2014;even the Omnibus lad seemed to compassionate my case&#x2014;for he would not <hi rend="italic">take</hi> my sixpence!! and providentialy as I was wondering how I should get home on my feet, Darwin drove up and relieved me from all further charge of myself&#x2014; That evening who should present himself but&#x2014;Robertson!&#x2014; I thought at first he must be come to ask: why I accused him of &#x201C;fancying women in love with him&#x201D;&#x2014;but his intentions proved to be entirely amicable&#x2014;</p>
<p>Yesterday I had to go in two Omnibus to Fizroy Square about the framing of that picture<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Chapman, picture-framer, 2 Fitzroy Sq.</note>&#x2014;on the <hi rend="italic">instantaneous</hi> completion of which C seemed to have hung all his hopes for this world and the next&#x2014; I returned <pb id="pg-15-135" n="15:135"/>at dinner time tired to death having been again in the Gower Street end of the town <hi rend="italic">picked up by Darwin</hi> and deposited in a regular Picadilly Omnibus!! &#x201C;Mr Mazzini waits&#x201D;&#x2014;the disagreeableness of finding even a M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Mazzini when one returns from such a worrying expedition, and needs porter and animal food to restore exhausted nature&#x2014;and moreover it was the day of the Macready-dinner<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <hi rend="italic">Macready&#x2019;s Reminiscences</hi>, ed. F. Pollock (<date when="1875-00-00">1875</date>) 2:203, where the guest list is given. It was apparently of this meeting that TC wrote in his Journal: &#x201C;The other night, saw Dickens again (Pickwick, Boz), home from America; who sent me his Book [<hi rend="italic">American Notes</hi>], which also I have read. Decidedly a clever small figure, this good Boz. Small in body, far from large in mind; but <hi rend="italic">good</hi> and praiseable, &#x2018;what is of him.&#x2019; Poor little fellow!&#x2014; He wears his hair long, all tattered like a mop; he has a lively honest merry eye; the moveablest eyebrows which he is forever shuttling about; a prominent thin nose; prominent upper jaw, with small mouth and receding chin; a head altogether of the <hi rend="italic">cock</hi> sort, but full of intelligent vivacity and friendliness. He is not much above 5 feet 2 or 3, I think;&#x2014;something like the size of Jeffrey; and perhaps of about equal faculty (I sometimes think) tho&#x2019; so differently developed! But no;&#x2014;is not Jeffrey <hi rend="italic">much</hi> the better intellect? The other has gone all into mimiery, actorship; Jeffrey has <hi rend="italic">reasoned</hi> much more: and <hi rend="italic">his</hi> laughter and banter (of which he has a good stock in him, developed&#x2014;and also <hi rend="italic">not</hi> developed, poor Jeffrey) is of a far more reflective character. Decidedly I rather liked poor Dickens; and thought with sympathy of the way in which he is tossed and tumbled in these mad times.&#x201D;</note>&#x2014;and Carlyle was all demoralized in the awful prospect&#x2014;lounging about from the mantlepiece to the table&#x2014;from the table to the chair-backs&#x2014;(you know his way) touching every thing and contradicting everything&#x2014;and neither taking the good of Mazzini himself nor letting me get the good of him&#x2014;so I told him flatly to go away&#x2014;and leave me to eat my dinner in peace and come again in the evening when I should be recovered and alone&#x2014;which he did for three hours&#x2014;</p>
<p>I gave him then the little donation<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jeannie Welsh&#x2019;s donation to the Italian school.</note> but I will keep his speeches on the occasion till next time for this letter is already too long for the time I have to spare&#x2014;</p>
<p>C returned at one in the morning&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">I</hi> having sat up for him&#x2014;rather pleased it seemed with his lark&#x2014; Dickens&#x2014;Longfellow&#x2014;D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Quin and <hi rend="italic">the Buttler&#x2019;s</hi> at dinner&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">Mrs</hi> Dickens and other &#x201C;honourable women not a few&#x201D;&#x2014;and men came to make a soiree of it in the evening and Miss Horton<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Pierce Butler and his wife, Fanny Kemble.

<p><salute>I am not sure, dear Babbie,</salute> that consistently, with my duties to &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">Humanity</hi>,&#x2019; to my numerous friends and admirers, to my own house-hold, (such as it is), and above all to my own <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, little spirit of unrest, which, that it may not fly all into shivers, needs to cultivate in itself above all things the great holding-together cement of stupidity!&#x2014; Am not sure that consistently with these manifold duties, I can <hi rend="italic">go on</hi> writing to you <hi rend="italic">at the present rate</hi>&#x2014; But my imagination (surely a most fertile one!) representing you to me in these days as a Babbie getting herself <hi rend="italic">weaned</hi>, how can I resist thus spiritually holding out to you (if I may so speak) a finger to suck! Alas the small nourishment that is to be drawn from it! but if the Babbie&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">imagination</hi> be comforted thereby, is it not well, and may not <hi rend="italic">the shirts</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Shirts she was to mend.</note> and all other things lie over, for the accomplishment of so laudable a purpose?&#x2014;</p>
<p>First then of the <hi rend="italic">donation</hi>&#x2014; Mazzini was telling me that Gambardella had stopt payment!&#x2014;two surprising facts respecting G. I learnt from him in the same breath&#x2014;the first that he (G) <hi rend="small-caps">can</hi> write, the second that he has no money! &#x201C;The <hi rend="italic">Administrator</hi>&#x201D; (old Heraclytus<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Filippo Pistrucci.</note>) waited upon him to ask the amount of his subscription (1&#xa3;) or leave to erase his name from the list of subscribers&#x2014; G. told him he would communicate on the subject with Mazzini himself, and this was the purport of his communication made <hi rend="italic">in writing</hi> (!); that he had not 1&#xa3; to give at present, but would send it when he had! Has he invested his whole capital in velvet linings? While M. was bidding a sad <foreign>adieu</foreign> to this one pound as well as to Lady Byron&#x2019;s five, I put yours into his hand&#x2014; Having cautiously unfolded it, he asked &#x201C;what <hi rend="italic">is</hi> <hi rend="small-caps">she</hi>?&#x201D; (the sovereign was it, or the writing of which he made a female?) &#x201C;Read and you will see&#x201D;&#x2014; &#x201C;J. W. Jeannie Welsh&#x201D;? (quite unconscious that he was taking the smallest freedom with your name&#x2014; &#x201C;It is <hi rend="italic">of</hi> her?&#x201D; &#x201C;Of her&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;and without suggestion?&#x201D; &#x201C;entirely without suggestion&#x201D;! &#x201C;Well it is <hi rend="italic">good</hi> upon <hi rend="italic">my</hi> honour! but I should not have thought&#x2014;I mean, in a young person,&#x2014;I rather wonder how the thought came to her!&#x201D; &#x201C;I assure you she is quite old enough to have good thoughts.&#x201D; &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Jeannie Welsh</hi>&#x2014;well! do I put her by that name in the list of those who have <hi rend="italic">gifted</hi> our school?&#x201D; &#x201C;That is her name of endearment&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">you</hi> had better call her Miss Welsh&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;And <hi rend="italic">what</hi> is <hi rend="italic">Babbie</hi>? is <hi rend="italic">babbie</hi> in <pb id="pg-15-137" n="15:137"/>Scotch the same as <hi rend="italic">Jeannie?</hi>&#x201D; &#x201C;My dear you are getting so abstruse that there is really no answering of your questions.&#x201D; &#x201C;Never mind! Jeannie or Babbie as you will; she is <hi rend="italic">good</hi>&#x2014;and our school <hi rend="italic">stands in debt</hi> to her&#x201D;! Well for &#x201C;our school&#x201D; if that were <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the debt it stood in!</p>
<p>I broke off my last letter to go to M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Bullers&#x2014;and actually set out&#x2014;but never arrived! At Sloan Square I took the direction to Montpelier place, the location of these forlorn Hunters<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Adam Hunter and his wife.</note>&#x2014;having made up my mind on the way that of the two claims on me theirs was the most imperative; being backed out with a relationship as well as spitting of blood&#x2014; Their lodging is very near to Gambardella&#x2019;s&#x2014;and from there I thought I might still get to M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Bullers by help of a cab&#x2014;but the visit to the Hunters both fatigued and saddened me so much that I was fit for nothing more that day&#x2014; M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Hunter I found a sensible, unaffected, very affectionate looking woman suffering great anxiety of mind and exerting herself to do the best under it&#x2014; She told me at the door with a very pale face and tears in her eyes that the D<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> gave her almost no hope&#x2014; Their little girl, about 11 or 12, is a beauty, and a smart, well mannered little thing&#x2014; She is to remain at her school here during their stay at Hastings so I must really take some charge of the poor little thing&#x2014; By the way there seems to have been a general turning up of <hi rend="italic">Cousins</hi> for me since you went&#x2014;the day I went about the picture frame. I saw in Regent Street from my Omnibus (and thanked heaven it <hi rend="italic">was</hi> from an Omnibus) James Baillie still in the white trowsers and heaven-blue coat, and his <hi rend="italic">mustay unso<supplied>[i]</supplied>l<supplied>[e]</supplied>d</hi><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >MS may read &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">mustag</hi>,&#x201D; i.e., &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">mustag</hi>[moustache] <hi rend="italic">unso<supplied>[i]</supplied>l<supplied>[e]</supplied>d</hi> [letters omitted].&#x201D;</note>&#x2014; It were a curiosity of rascaldom to know how that man lives, and gets his washing done!</p>
<p>Yesterday morning I had your letter, to hearten me after &#x2018;a considerable of a&#x2019; row about a missing pamphlet, which C had picked up&#x2014;(in pleaseant consequence of the Macready-dinner) &#x201C;one of those books seen for a moment&#x2014;laid out of his hand, and then swept away <hi rend="italic">irrecoverably</hi> into the general chaos of this house&#x201D;&#x2014; It was found of course in his own bookpress the first thing I saw on opening it&#x2014; But the music of our souls was jarred for the day! To my inexpressible relief Old Buller came to tell me <hi rend="italic">she</hi> was gone to the Dentist&#x2014;so that I might indulge my great need of lying on the sofa all day with a safe conscience&#x2014;which I did, after having played and won one game at Chess&#x2014; M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Chadwick<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Rachel Chadwick.</note> called and sat a very long <pb id="pg-15-138" n="15:138"/>time and in the evening we had the Wedgwoods<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hensleigh and Frances Wedgwood.</note> and Darwin according to Programme&#x2014; Today M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Scott of Woolich<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alexander J.

<p>I wish all men knew and saw in very truth, as Emerson does, the everlasting worth, dignity, and blessedness of work. We should then terminate our Fox-hunting, Almacking,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Almack (d. <date when="1781-00-00">1781</date>), founder of Almack&#x2019;s Assembly Rooms and club; cf. <ref target="volume-06/lt-18321202-TC-JAC-01"><sic>6:269</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1832-12-02">2 Dec. 1832</date></corr></ref>.</note> Corn-lawing, and a variety of other things! For myself, I feel daily more and more what a truth there is in that old saying of the monks, <foreign><hi rend="italic">Laborare est orare</hi></foreign> [to work is to pray]. I find really that a man cannot make a pair of shoes rightly unless he do it in a <hi rend="italic">devout</hi> manner; that no man is ever paid for his real work, or should <hi rend="italic">ever</hi> expect or demand angrily to be paid; that all <hi rend="italic">work</hi> properly so called is an appeal from the Seen to the <hi rend="italic">Unseen</hi>&#x2014;a devout calling upon Higher Powers; and unless <hi rend="italic">they</hi> stand by us, it will not be a work, but a quackery.</p>
<p>Perhaps I should tell you, withal, that a set of headlong enthusiasts have already risen up in America who, grounding themselves on these notions of Emerson, decide on <hi rend="italic">renouncing</hi> the world and its ways somewhat in the style of the old eremites of the Thebaid;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Part of Upper Egypt.</note> and retire into remote rural places to dig and delve with their own hands, &#x2018;to live according to Nature and Truth,&#x2019; and for one thing eat vegetables only. We had a missionary of that kind here&#x2014;a man of sincere convictions, but of the deepest ignorance, and calmly arrogant as an <hi rend="italic">inspired</hi> man may be supposed to be&#x2014;on the whole, one of the intensest bores I have ever met with.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alcott.</note> He made no proselytes <pb id="pg-15-139" n="15:139"/>in this quarter; but the spiritual state of New England as rendered visible through him was very strange to me. &#x2026;</p>
<p>I had three days of riding excursion into Oliver Cromwell&#x2019;s country. I smoked a cigar on his broken horseblock in the old city of Ely, under the stars, beside the graves of St. Mary&#x2019;s Churchyard. I almost wept to stand upon the very flagstones under the setting sun where he ordered the refractory parson, &#x2018;Leave off your fooling, and <hi rend="italic">come out</hi>, sir!&#x2019; Alas! he too! was he <hi rend="italic">paid</hi> for his work?</p>
<p>Do not ask me whether I yet <hi rend="italic">write</hi> about Oliver. My deep and growing feeling is that it is <hi rend="italic">impossible</hi>. The mighty has gone to be a ghost, and will never take body again.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC&#x2019;s desperation is repeated in the Journal, <date when="1842-10-25">25 Oct. 1842</date> (also given by Froude, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi> 3:279&#x2013;80): &#x201C;For many months there has been no writing here. Alas, what was there to write? &#x2026; I have not yet got one word to stand upon paper in regard to Oliver. The <hi rend="italic">beginnings</hi> of work are even more formidable than the executing of it. I seem to myself at present, and for a long while past, to be sunk deep, fifty miles deep below the region of articulation; and if I ever rise to speak again must raise whole continents with me. Some hundreds of times I have felt, and scores of times I have said and written, that <hi rend="italic">Oliver</hi> is an <hi rend="italic">impossibility</hi>. Yet I am still found at it,&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">without</hi> any visible result at all! Remorse too, for my sinful disgraceful sloth, accompanies me; as it well may. I am, as it were, without a language.&#x2014; Tons of dull Books I have read on this matter, and it is still only looming as thro&#x2019; thick mists on my eye. Then looming or flaming visible (did it even <hi rend="italic">flame</hi> which it has never yet been made to do) in what <hi rend="italic">terms</hi> am I to set it forth? I wish often I could write <hi rend="italic">rhyme</hi>. A new <hi rend="italic">form</hi>, from centre to surface <hi rend="italic">unlike</hi> what I find elsewhere in myself or others, would alone be appropriate for the indescribable <foreign><hi rend="italic">chiaro-scuro</hi></foreign> and waste bewilderment of this subject.&#x201D; His desperation is largely that he has still not decided to write a history, a biography, or to edit letters, speeches or papers, and whatever the substance, he is even more undecided about the form.</note></p>

<salute>Dear Wedgwood,</salute>
<p>I cannot now recollect what loose talk of mine it was that has thus grated on your religious feelings; which, I hope, no deliberate talk or thought of mine would at any time offend.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably on their visit of <date when="1842-10-20">20 Oct.</date> Hensleigh himself had resigned a fellowship at Cambridge, <date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>, because of scruples about formally accepting the Thirty-nine Articles, but had strict (if now uncertain) principles.</note> There is not in your Profession of Faith today the least thing that I would dissent from; however much I might perhaps wish to <hi rend="italic">add</hi>,&#x2014;if forced to express myself on such subjects. But by conviction of the inadequacy of all Speech or expression, especially <hi rend="italic">our present</hi> style of Speech, grows <pb id="pg-15-140" n="15:140"/>daily stronger: daily stronger too my impatience with all dogmatism on insoluble problems, on inconceivable objects; my deep manifold feeling that <hi rend="italic">this</hi> is verily the <hi rend="small-caps">Unnameable</hi>,&#x2014; which a man has to speak forth in his life and acts, not by any words (completely) that he can use at present. My impatience with most forms of words, and forms of jargons,&#x2014;especially when they get into the shrill or cackling condition,&#x2014;is now and then very intense, it must be owned! Probably it was some spurt of this that gave you the affliction in question.</p>
<p>We had Scott last night, and a great deal of good conversation.</p>

<dateline>Saturday [<date when="1842-10-22">22 October 1842</date>]</dateline>
<p>I have mended <hi rend="italic">two</hi> of the shirts this morning&#x2014;and <hi rend="italic">effectually</hi>&#x2014;having put entire new tails to them!&#x2014;so now I may do a little in the way of fondling my innocent offspring, without the sternest moralist being entitled to say to me, &#x201C;black is the white of your eye&#x201D;!&#x2014;Besides, I feel as if writing a few lines to <hi rend="italic">you</hi> were some small expression of thankfulness to Heaven for this particular, thorough wet day! But for the conclusive rain, I could not have got staid in the house today&#x2014;again&#x2014;the third day&#x2014;without having had a fight for it&#x2014;and really chicken-hearted as I am grown, there is nothing I can muster nerve to show fight about&#x2014;nothing except my <hi rend="italic">right</hi> to treat &#x201C;poor Creek considerably worse than a dog&#x201D;!&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">That</hi>, with Gods blessing I will maintain to my latest breath.</p>
<p>Mazzini was here yesterday&#x2014;radiant over an &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">aviso interessante</hi></foreign> [interesting notice]&#x201D; which he produced from his pocket&#x2014;setting forth that one <hi rend="italic">Mussi</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note>&#x2014;or some such name had discovered a power for regulating balloons as perfectly as a steamboat or railway carriage, in confirmation whereof behold certificates from <hi rend="italic">the Grand Duke of Tuscany</hi> and the heads of <hi rend="italic">the Academy of Science at Florence</hi> &#x26;c &#x26;c&#x2014;before whom his model had been displayed!&#x2014; The practical application you cannot for a moment be at a loss about!&#x2014; The man&#x2019;s having not a shilling in the world, no means of subsistence but simply this small model-balloon, is willing to sell his secret for <pb id="pg-15-141" n="15:141"/>the trifling sum of <hi rend="italic">two thousand pounds</hi>&#x2014;if Mazzini can find him work in the interim the man <hi rend="italic">may be induced not to part with it</hi> (!) till some member of <hi rend="italic">the Association</hi> in Italy may be found to make the purchase&#x2014; &#x201C;Then&#x201D;! says Mazzini&#x2014;&#x201C;The power of directing balloons <hi rend="italic">ours;</hi> all is ours!&#x201D;&#x2014; &#x201C;You mean that you would invade Italy in balloons? that <hi rend="italic">the Association</hi> would descend on the Austrians out of the skies?&#x201D;&#x2014; &#x201C;Exactly&#x2014;! and I confess to you&#x2014;you may think it childish&#x2014;but there is something of romance, something which flatters my imagination in the idea of <hi rend="small-caps">starting up</hi> <hi rend="italic">a nation</hi> in a manner never before heard tell of!&#x201D; &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">A la bonne heure</hi></foreign> [Very well] my Dear! but if it be decided that we are to begin the war by personating the fallen Angels, <foreign>adieu</foreign> to <hi rend="italic">my</hi> share in the expedition!&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;Now, why so?&#x201D; (with a look of the most grave astonishment) It was just in reference to <hi rend="italic">you</hi> that I felt the greatest preference to <hi rend="italic">this means</hi>,&#x2014;to think that you could go without incurring the physical suffering of a sea voyage and all the dangers&#x2014;what shall I say&#x2014;of being sunk perhaps by a volley of cannon from the shore!&#x2014;and then there would be something so <hi rend="italic">new</hi>&#x2014;and <hi rend="italic">so</hi> what shall I say&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">suitable</hi> for <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, in descending as it were out of Heaven to redeem a suffering people!!&#x201D;&#x2014; All this with eyes flashing hope, faith, and generous self-devotion!

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Short while ago, there came safely to my hands the <hi rend="italic">Report of the Perkins Institution;</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">The Perkins Institution and Massachusetts Asylum for the Blind, Ninth Report</hi>, <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>. Dickens had visited the institution in <date when="1842-01-00">Jan.</date>; see <hi rend="italic">American Notes</hi> ch. 3.</note> and legible in one corner of it, your name as that of the kind Donor. Pray accept many thanks for a Gift which has afforded me unusual pleasure. To be remembered by so good and valuable a man as I construe you to be was of itself very welcome; and the news you give me of work done in your noble Institution is full of interest to all men. The thanks and congratulations of all men are with you in your most blessed task; that of bringing Light to them that sat in great darkness: a blessed task, I call it, if there ever was one! That you so prosper in it, is a true victory; a victory in which there is no sorrow, but joy and blessings only. I bid you go on and prosper.</p>
<p>Few things that I ever read have interested me more than this of your dear little Laura Bridgman;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Laura Dewey Bridgman (<date when="1829-00-00">1829</date>&#x2013;<date when="1889-00-00">89</date>), blind and deaf from scarlet fever since age two, educ. by Howe, from <date when="1837-00-00">1837</date>, and became the first blind deaf mute to be successfully educ. by systematic means. A long app. in the <hi rend="italic">Ninth Report</hi> gives her history, from which Dickens largely took his description.</note>&#x2014;probably one of the beautifullest phenomena at present visible under our Sun. The good little girl: one loves her to the very heart. No Goethe&#x2019;s Mignon,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister&#x2019;s Apprenticeship</hi>.</note> in most poetic fiction, comes closer to one than this poor Laura in prose reality and fact. A true angel-soul and breath of Heaven, imprisoned as none such ever was before. A child of <hi rend="italic">genius</hi>, for such I can perceive she is; without eyes, ears, voice, taste or smell; isolated, as within fivefold iron gates, from all men and all things! And you into such a labyrinth, deep as the centre of the world, have got tidings conveyed to her; have as with a voice of Miracle said, &#x201C;Arise, deliver thyself!&#x201D; and the noble child <hi rend="italic">is</hi> delivered and disimprisoned. One knows not what act more like a god&#x2019;s the art of man can <pb id="pg-15-143" n="15:143"/>accomplish:&#x2014;the <hi rend="italic">art</hi> of man I have said; and yet I believe it is rather, and first of all, the virtue of man; his love, his patience, his long-suffering mercy, fruitful in all manner of arts and expedients. You need not our thanks; I believe you to be already thanked and recompensed in very rich measure. We will bid you continue your work; we will, in silence or spoken words, pray for God&#x2019;s blessing to you and it.</p>
<p>One painful apprehension haunts me as to this little Laura: that she be made what we call a &#x201C;Lion&#x201D; of; that <hi rend="italic">she</hi> learn at last how wonderful she is,&#x2014;and have all the vanities and base confusions that yet lie safe as sediment and basis at the bottom of her character, stirred up and set floating aloft, to the darkening, sickening and ruining of it! I conjure you, in the name of Mercy, stand between her and all that! She is a born Queen; but it will <supplied>[be]</supplied><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Omitted in MS.</note> a curse to her if ever she know it;&#x2014;a true eating of the forbidden fruit. Were it not that you are ever there, and have, as it were, in some good measure, the lock-and-key of all that, I should really tremble for her. For the world, without being malevolent, is terribly foolish; and often more mischievous than the very Devil could be with all <hi rend="italic">his</hi> malice. Sad to think that a poor simple Grace Darling cannot, obeying her own innocent heart, simply venture her life to save lives of brothers, but all the blockheads of the world must gather round her with their wonder and their guineas,&#x2014;and do what lies in them to kill her, soul and body, by the miserablest death! Be far distant, ye unmalevolent blockheads; go elsewhither, in the name of Heaven! Stand not here with your handful of figs, like Shandy at the gate of Lyons, &#x201C;curious to see w<supplied>[hether]</supplied> an ass will eat figs&#x201D;:<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Tristram Shandy</hi> bk. 7, ch. 32.</note> <hi rend="italic">this</hi> is no ass, and you are worse than any!&#x2014; My wish for this dear Laura were that, if you had once taught her to read and to work, she were safe home with her good mother again. But then I suppose nobody could speak with her there? Alas, hers is a delicate difficult case, and you will require all your benevolence and good sense on her behalf,&#x2014;and I rejoice to think, will cheerfully use it for her.&#x2014; That little question of hers, &#x201C;Do horses sit up late?&#x201D; stirs us to laughter, to tears&#x2014;when one thinks of the good little creature,&#x2014;and probably to as kind a mood as human speech alone can awaken in a human heart.</p>
<p>I could send my respects also to the rugged Saxon, Oliver Casswell:<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Oliver Caswell (b. <date when="1829-00-00">1829</date>), blind and deaf from scarlet fever since age three; entered the Inst., <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>, where he learned rapidly; henceforth he and Laura Bridgman were educ. together and became the focus of interest of the Inst. TC calls him Saxon because the <hi rend="italic">Report</hi> refers to him as thick-set with light hair and a fair complexion. For Howe&#x2019;s educ. of the children, see Schwartz 67&#x2013;90.</note> my hopes that he will become an effectual fellow, after his <pb id="pg-15-144" n="15:144"/>kind, one day. But I have already written far beyond what I intended; and must now subscribe myself, with true esteem and the best wishes for you and your work,</p>
<closer><salute>My dear Sir, / Most faithfully yours,</salute></closer>

<salute>Dear Jean,</salute>
<p>Thanks for your new Letter; yours are almost the only articulate tidings I get out of Scotland now. We have yet no word from the Doctor; but imagine he must be thro&#x2019; Liverpool by this time, and in his old moorings again. I have been <foreign><hi rend="italic">wae</hi></foreign> these two days to think of our Mother&#x2019;s sorrow at parting with him. But we should rather be thankful at <hi rend="italic">meeting</hi> than <foreign>wae</foreign> at parting,&#x2014;if we were wise and humble in this world! Having now got the correct money account, I enclose a draught to pay it. James will get cash for it by shewing himself on Wednesday (the day after tomorrow) at the proper Bank. The net sum I owed <hi rend="italic">him</hi> seems to be &#xa3;6.11.6: there is here a sovereign more for Sister Jenny which she must accept of me; and also Sixpence for my esteemed friend, James Aitken the Second, to purchase <foreign><hi rend="italic">peeries</hi></foreign> [spinning tops] with, the villain!&#x2014; Many thanks to all of you for your successful assiduity and punctuality.</p>
<p>Our Mother&#x2019;s Picture continues to be praised by everybody; some of them much better judges of pictorial talent than we. James could not of course deliver that message about the whiskey: but I really do lament much that a talent like this should drown itself there!</p>
<p>The Frame-maker talked of tomorrow (&#x201C;tuesday next,&#x201D; was his phrase) for the Frame; but we hardly look for him till towards the end of the week. Jane bargained with him for &#xa3;3, and seemed to approve very well of his workmanship and proposed pattern. It was very lucky indeed that we did not frame at Dumfries.</p>
<p>No better success attends me as yet in my writing endeavours: but if I can keep myself at it, the thing must and will, and also <hi rend="italic">shall</hi>, take fire at last! When I think of the misery a man has in doing any kind of true work whatever (were it only making a pair <pb id="pg-15-145" n="15:145"/>of shoes <hi rend="italic">truly</hi>, instead of <hi rend="italic">falsely</hi>), I say often. Let no honest workman <hi rend="italic">expect</hi> complete payment, or so much as grumble about the want of it.</p>
<p>The hand of the <hi rend="italic">Quack</hi> is heavy on me even here on this paper! I can now get no paper here anywhere on which a man <hi rend="italic">can</hi> write otherwise than abominably. It is not made of true rags, it is made of lime and size. An emblem of too many things and persons,&#x2014;fast breaking down in one huge mass of ruin in these very times. &#x201C;Come out of her my friends!&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Mark 5:8, as with the Gadarene swine.</note> Let <hi rend="italic">us</hi> have no part or lot in all that accursed concern; whether it stand or fall, let us stand wide from it!&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; Jane has got rid of her cold again, and sends you kind salutations. <foreign>Adieu</foreign> dear Sister</p>
<closer><salute>Ever your affectionate</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name>
<ps><p><hi rend="italic">One</hi> stroke on the Newspaper next Wednesday will signify &#x201C;all right&#x201D; for me, till you have more time.</p></ps>

<p>Marheinecke&#x2019;s Book<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410521-TC-RWE-01">TC to RWE, <date when="1841-05-21">21 May 1841</date></ref>.</note> will not do. It is of the deadliest tiresomeness; an altogether stupid Book; dependent for any interest it has solely on the copious incessant extracts from Luther&#x2019;s Writings; which clipping process is itself very ill managed; so that I suppose this dull compilation is as good as superseded, even in Germany, by the lively dextrous French one of little Michelet. Ranke too is said to be coming out with some History of Luther,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jules Michelet, trans. and comp., <hi rend="italic">M&#xE9;moires de Luther, &#xE9;crits par lui-m&#xEA;me</hi> (Paris, <date when="1835-00-00">1835</date>); probably Leopold von Ranke, <hi rend="italic">Deutsche Geschichte im Zeitalter der Reformation</hi>, 6 vols. (Berlin, <date when="1839-00-00">1839</date>&#x2013;<date when="1847-00-00">47</date>).</note> perhaps has begun to come out with it.</p>
<p>There was published some ten years ago an entertaining and intelligent <hi rend="italic">Life of Schiller</hi>, containing various new Letters of his, new personal details &#x26;c by a Frau von Wollzogen (I think that was her title), who had known the man, and was connected with his Wife&#x2019;s family. Goethe sent it over to me; I can remember reading it, in the Annan &#x26; Liverpool Steamer, not without some real interest.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Schiller&#x2019;s sister-in-law, Caroline von Wolzogen (<date when="1763-00-00">1763</date>&#x2013;<date when="1847-00-00">1847</date>), <hi rend="italic">Schillers Leben</hi>, 2 vols. (Stuttgart, <date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>). TC took this book on his journey to London, <date when="1831-08-00">Aug. 1831</date>; see <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310813-TC-G-01"><sic>5:327</sic><corr>TC to G, <date when="1831-08-13">13 Aug. 1831</date></corr></ref>, where wrongly identified as the German trans. of TC&#x2019;s life of Schiller. TC recommended it in his pref. to the second edn. of his own biography (<date when="1845-00-00">1845</date>).</note> Would <pb id="pg-15-146" n="15:146"/>the British Public do the like? I think it is in either two or else three thinnish &#x201C;foolscap-octavos.&#x201D;</p>
<p>There is also here a Preuss&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Life of Frederick the Great</hi>, in two thin octavos;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Johann David Ermann Preuss, <hi rend="italic">Friedrich der Grosse.

(Berlin, <date when="1832-00-00">1832</date>&#x2013;<date when="1834-00-00">34</date>).</note> untranslated as yet: I have not read it myself, and only had it recommended to me as the eligiblest initiatory Book on that Subject.</p>
<p>The thing that strikes me, however, as hopefullest, if anything be very hopeful, is a certain <hi rend="italic">Life of Herder by his Widow</hi>. It is not a large Book, perhaps one good octavo might hold it in English; it is simple, clear; and, I can remember, entertained me very much, when I read it, fifteen years ago in Edinburgh.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Maria Caroline von Herder, b. Flachsiand (<date when="1750-00-00">1750</date>&#x2013;<date when="1809-00-00">1809</date>), <hi rend="italic">Erinnerungen aus dem Leben Joh. Gottfrieds von Herder</hi>, ed. J. G.

<p>Booksellers used to say in my time that &#x201C;no Translation from the German had <hi rend="italic">ever</hi> been known to prosper!&#x201D; I hope, that is altered now; but do not with any certainty know it to be so. Except indeed that Mrs Austin and others seem to make a kind of literary existence out in that way.</p>

<salute>Dearest Mrs Jameson</salute>
<p>It is a great consolation to a modest nature like mine, to see that <hi rend="italic">women of genius</hi> do sometimes exactly the same sort of stupid things one does oneself! You say that you enclose a letter from Marriotti which I am to keep for you and your letter is an entirely self-containing letter&#x2014;no word from Marriotti was there!

<salute>Dearest Babbie</salute>
<p>I <hi rend="italic">must</hi> send you a few lines today in answer to your good two letters: tho I have hardly left myself time for writing and also doing what must be done this day or never; <hi rend="italic">calling for Mrs Buller</hi> (she goes tomorrow, and oh Babbie such is the frailty of human intentions! that call is still to make!!) I have been seized with one of my violent fits of activity this morning&#x2014;preparatory I suppose to an equally violent headach&#x2014;the usual sequence: and since I rose at eight have been running up and down like a house on fire&#x2014;discovering imperfections, putting them to rights&#x2014;cleaning the lamp (which continues to <hi rend="italic">act</hi> deliciously) brightening the <hi rend="italic">plate</hi>&#x2014;[understand by the magnificent word the basket, salver, and two wine sliders [every soul of them <hi rend="italic">plaited</hi> by the way]<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC&#x2019;s brackets.</note> which stand on the sideboard&#x2014;and doing various et ceteras of like household importance&#x2014; I could not but smile at the first words of your letter&#x2014;having been thinking to myself that <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the things I had meant to say to <hi rend="italic">you</hi> had been ommitted in my last letters&#x2014; Yesterday it rained from morning till night without ceasing&#x2014;nobody came&#x2014;nothing happened&#x2014;and it is wonderful how the human memory freshens all up in the vapour bath of such a day!&#x2014; Ever so many things which I needed to ask <hi rend="italic">you</hi> and to tell you <hi rend="italic">came</hi> out like invisible ink-writing held to the fire&#x2014;it was as if the pitter-patter of the rain whispered them to me&#x2014; Lord bless me! I am so figuratively disposed this morning!&#x2014; I suppose it comes of having spent all yesterday in reading Jean Paul.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Richter.</note> But I will try to check the oriental tendency of my imagination and keep to the businesses before <hi rend="italic">the House</hi>&#x2014; First as to that invaluable but at the same time highly troublesome root&#x2014;potatoes&#x2014; No! we have as yet taken no steps&#x2014; <hi rend="small-caps">The Man&#x2019;s</hi> have been slightly improved since you left&#x2014;&#x201C;to the extent that Carlyle <hi rend="italic">can</hi> eat them&#x201D;&#x2014; They are not very good&#x2014;nor yet very bad&#x2014;so whether in such doubtful state of the matter your kind offer ought to be accepted or declined I absolutely cannot decide&#x2014;do you decide for me; taking this along with you that should they become worse I will certainly give you notice.</p>

<p>One of the questions I had meant and failed to ask was precisely about <hi rend="italic">her</hi> and the other&#x2014;how they went on? and especially the new cook?&#x2014;fellow-feeling makes one take a grave interest in these sublunary cares, which young ladies think beneath the dignity of modern correspondence  Another of my forgotten questions was; Has M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Martin opportunity of sending things to old Miss Gillespie<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Miss Gillespie of Moffat.</note> and if not what is old Miss Gillespie&#x2019;s special address  Poor old woman, I know next to nothing of her personally&#x2014;but she has lost a most kind friend and I would be glad by any little attention in my power to give her a moment&#x2019;s pleasure&#x2014;often I used to feel vexed at my Mother for spending so much of the little she had upon others, and getting so few comforts and pleasures out of it for herself&#x2014;fool that I was, I made <hi rend="italic">that</hi> a reproach to her which was her goodness her wisdom  Oh I am very thankful now that she followed the thought of her own generous heart instead of my mistaken counsels!&#x2014; What comfort were it for me now to think that she had for so many years of life had a little better food, and better clothes, and more travelling about, and more company at home, compared with the comfort of thinking that she made herself <hi rend="italic">loved</hi> as a benefactor while she lived, and has made for herself in the hearts of so many an eternal regret? All that she <hi rend="italic">enjoyed</hi> is useless to her now&#x2014;and useless to me in the remembrance&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">it</hi> belonged to her life on earth and her life on earth is finished&#x2014;but all that she <hi rend="italic">gave</hi> belongs to another and higher sphere&#x2014;its fruits remain for ever and ever&#x2014;</p>
<p>What were the other things I had to say to you?&#x2014; They are all escaped again&#x2014;and I know they amounted to something like half a dozen Well, perhaps I may recover them by tomorrow&#x2014;</p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Thanks for your gift of Emerson&#x2019;s Lecture. Mr Ballantyne had already sent me two copies; that was my first sight of the performance. It is an excellent Discourse, greatly wanted on both sides of the Atlantic, and cannot be too widely circulated. While men worship Mammon as their Supreme Divinity, it is of no use trying to &#x2018;reform&#x2019; either themselves or their affairs. Mammon was long ago recognized to be no Divinity but a Devil, and even a very contemptible species of Devil; and they that follow his guidance do very naturally <hi rend="italic">go</hi> to the Devil in all senses, and even cannot go elsewhither!</p>
<p>Probably you are not aware that in New England a certain set of persons, grounding themselves on these ideas of Emerson&#x2019;s, are already about <hi rend="italic">renouncing</hi> this miserable humbug of a world altogether, and retiring into the rural wilderness, to live there exclusively upon vegetables raised by their own digging! Three hours daily work, they say, will produce a man vegetables sufficient, with grey hodden garment sufficient; and he can live there according to his own mind, leaving the world to live according to <hi rend="italic">its</hi>. An American man was here lately, as our express Missionary of all that;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alcott&#x2019;s projected community at Fruitlands; see <ref target="volume-14/lt-18420731-TC-TSS-01">TC to TSS, <date when="1842-07-31">31 July</date></ref>.</note> seeking for recruits, for proselytes;&#x2014;naturally finding none. I was obliged to express my total, deep irreclaimable dissent from the whole vegetable concern,&#x2014;not without great offence to the Missionary; and that perhaps is the reason why he sent me no American Copy of this Lecture. Emerson does not yet go into vegetables, into rural Hermitships; and we may hope, never will.</p>

<p>The other thing was still less momentous and yet worth telling <hi rend="italic">to ones Babbie</hi>&#x2014;it was a shock that was given to &#x201C;the deep deep Sea&#x201D;&#x2014; The young Lady had been very incessant one forenoon&#x2014;and Carlyle <pb id="pg-15-154" n="15:154"/>was in a <hi rend="italic">fix</hi> with his writing&#x2014; He tried to vent his impatience in walking violently to and fro over <hi rend="italic">my</hi> head&#x2014;at last seized with a movement of fury he took up the poker, and with the head of it gave two startling blows on the wall &#x201C;exactly opposite where he fancied the young Lady seated.&#x201D; The Music&#x2014;if music it can be called&#x2014;ceased in one moment&#x2014;and all was quiet as death in No 6 for the next twelve hours!</p>

<salute>Dear</salute>
<p>My letter being of rather ancient date (saturday night) I add a line that you may know me, up to Monday, still in the land of the living and the loving&#x2014; Already (at 12 oclock) have I been up poor wretch to Collier&#x2019;s&#x2014;in omnibus&#x2014;respecting those melancholy watches&#x2014;declined after all&#x2014;found to be &#x201C;of inferior quality&#x201D; so that Mazzini has nothing left for it but to sell them to the French man for 15&#xa3;&#x2014;well if he gets the money from him even at that absurd price!&#x2014;&#x201C;Virtue its own reward&#x201D;&#x2014;was there ever a greater <foreign><hi rend="italic">betise</hi></foreign> [absurdity] than that current among articulate speaking men!&#x2014; <hi rend="italic">Virtue its own punishment</hi> were a maxim much less liable to exception&#x2014;</p>
<p>Old Sterling came yesterday giving lamentable accounts of &#x201C;my poor dear wife&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;<hi rend="italic">eats</hi> well sleeps well but such shortness of breath&#x201D;! A D<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, whom they consulted at Dublin, said it proceeded from &#x201C;her stomach being distended with gass!&#x201D;&#x2014;and with something besides gass I shrewdly conjecture!&#x2014;</p>
<p>The old gentleman in the midst of our <foreign>tete a tete</foreign> suddenly dropt silent&#x2014; I looked round at him&#x2014;after a minute or two&#x2014;and saw him with his features all pinched together, his mouth a little open&#x2014;profoundly asleep&#x2014;! I thought it one of the most rational and friendly looking modes of transacting a fore-noon visit that I had fallen in with for a good while&#x2014; He awoke after a quarter of an hour or so exclaiming &#x201C;gracious God have I been dreaming&#x201D;? You know best said I&#x2014;I only know that you have been asleep.&#x2014;</p>

<p><salute><hi rend="small-caps">My dear Jenny</hi>,&#x2014;</salute>Yesterday I meant to have written to you, in order to be ready for Thursday at Annan, such had been my firm purpose, but something came in the way, and I altogether forgot till this morning. Lest I make a similar mistake for Saturday too, I will take time by the forelock and write even now. The barrel of meal, and the box of garments arrived all safe, on Saturday night last.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-15-157" n="15:157"/>And I have to apprize you, as the expert needlewoman of the whole, that <hi rend="italic">all fits</hi> with perfect correctness. I have had a pair of drawers on, and a flannel shirt, I have one of the cambric shirts on me at present: everything is as right as if it had been made under my own eye. The flannel of the shirts is excellent, they are made to the very measure. The drawers also are the <hi rend="italic">best fit</hi> of the article I have had for several years back; two of the pairs, I observe, are of the fine flannel the shirts are of. Perhaps it will prove <hi rend="italic">too cool</hi> for the depth of winter&#x2014;perhaps not, but either way I have plenty of warmer, for that season. One of the pairs is of right shaggy flannel. My good Mother sent a fine wool plaid too and a dozen pair of socks, few mortals are better off for woolen this winter!&#x2014; As to the muslin shirts Jane says they are excellently sewed,&#x2014;She is the judge, I find them to lie <hi rend="italic">flat</hi> on the breast too, which the old would never do.</p>
<p>In short, it is all perfectly right; and you will be very glad, I doubt not, that you have got it well off your hands. If in the course of the winter, you fall <hi rend="italic">out of work</hi>, and want a <foreign>canny</foreign> job for yourself, it will be acceptable enough to me that you set Jean upon getting you some more stuff, and make me half a dozen more of the like shirts! But this you need not, unless in the aforesaid case. I believe the stock I have will serve me some couple of years or more. But they eat no bread.&#x2014; If you ever do think of this, you can let me know before starting; I may perhaps have some remarks to make.</p>
<p>You will be nestling all under cover now at Gill, when the short days and the frosts are come. I hope you have a right stock of fuel in your end of the house; and that your little carpet is now complete. I long to question the Dr. about you when he comes back hither. He is at a place they call Malvern some 120 miles west of this.</p>
<p>How are Mary and Jamie? very busy, and well, I hope. Mary never writes. I sent James a tobacco-box!&#x2014; Poor Allan Cunningham the Poet is dead very suddenly;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >After a stroke, <date when="1842-10-28">28 Oct.</date>, he d. 10:30 <hi rend="small-caps">p.m.</hi>, <date when="1842-10-29">29 Oct.</date></note> a sad event for several of us!&#x2014;</p>

<salute>Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>By the Newspaper which I addressed to you when it arrived from Dumfries, you would discern that I had received your Letter and was <pb id="pg-15-158" n="15:158"/>in my usual state; which at bottom was, and indeed still is, all the news I had to send you. We heard of your passing thro&#x2019; Liverpool; of your playing whist with the Landlord there, and your exemplary goodhumour under his unreason: after that we knew not exactly where you were till the Letter arrived.</p>
<p>I have been at Kenilworth; I remember Warwick Castle well, and the Picture of Cromwell you mention,&#x2014;standing in the embrasure of a window, with poor Charles First opposite him; like a black thundercloud and a pretty Card-castle: it struck me much.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC refers to two portraits at Warwick Castle, one of Cromwell by Robert Walker and the other of Charles I by Sir Anthony Van Dyck.</note>&#x2014; I wish you had gone to see Kineton and Edghill Field,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Edgehill Battle, called also Keinton Fight [<date when="1642-10-23">23 Oct. 1642</date>], near Keinton on the south edge of Warwickshire&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Cromwell, Works</hi> 6:127).</note> which is not very far out of one&#x2019;s line there. Are you within reach of Worcester City? The scene of the crowning mercy!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Worcester was Cromwell&#x2019;s victory of <date when="1651-09-03">3 Sept. 1651</date>, of which he wrote, &#x201C;It is &#x2026; a crowning mercy&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Cromwell, Works</hi> 7:331).</note> with a Rushworth in one&#x2019;s hand, one might gather a great deal of knowledge in your present way of life.</p>
<p>Alick sent me the Letter here enclosed, the tone of which I liked much; I have also heard from Jean at Dumfries, whose younger Boy<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Aitken (b. <date when="1841-02-00">Feb. 1841</date>).</note> is not very well: then on Saturday night the Box and Barrel, announced by Alick, got safe into our hands here; an interesting set of hieroglyphs from poor old Annandale! Nothing was injured, tho&#x2019; there seemed to have been some sudden pressure of haste just at the end; for the Butter was put in without any right cover among the meal, and our good Mother had not got the socks completely <hi rend="italic">dried:</hi> I saw it all! Nothing however was at all injured. We have likewise now got my Mother&#x2019;s Picture fairly hung up here; the man came down with his Frame on Saturday morning last. You will find it, where Mrs Sterling&#x2019;s deplorable Picture used to be, over my Mantelpiece up here; a surprisingly excellent Portrait. I am very glad indeed to have it. I have written to my Mother since the Barrel arrived. Poor Mother: I was very <foreign><hi rend="italic">wae</hi></foreign> about her on the day I fancied you setting from the Annan Jetty yonder!&#x2014;</p>
<p>You have doubtless noticed the death of poor Allan Cunningham in the Newspapers. I never heard of it till yesterday afternoon; and then, as you may fancy, with a painful shock. I went up directly to leave a card for the poor Widow. It was then after dark: in an upper window behind white curtains glowed a light, very visible from the street: there, I said to myself, lies the mortal hull of my poor brave Allan! The widow, I was told by the servant, bore up resolutely, and <pb id="pg-15-159" n="15:159"/>was as well as one could expect: Dr Cunningham<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. Peter Miller Cunningham (<date when="1789-00-00">1789</date>&#x2013;<date when="1864-00-00">1864</date>; <ref target="volume-15/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/6931"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), Allan&#x2019;s brother; see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350323-TC-JAC-01"><sic>8:82</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1835-03-23">23 Mar. 1835</date></corr></ref>.</note> continuing with her. Alas, it is but about a week since I stopped Allan near his own house, and spoke to him, little thinking it was the <hi rend="italic">last</hi> time! He died <hi rend="italic">instantly</hi>, they say: he had just finished <hi rend="italic">The Life of Wilkie</hi>;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">The Life of Sir David Wilkie</hi>, ed.

<salute>Dear Sterling,</salute>
<p>The thing you speak of<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sterling had written, <date when="1842-10-30">30 Oct.</date>: &#x201C;Emerson&#x2019;s pamphlet is indeed a very apostolic blast&#x2014;long life to it &#x26; him! This &#x26; many other things have set me thinking about the rather shameful want of good preaching in England &#x26; on the whole I believe it is your affair to reform us. What I want you to do is to set up a Magazine&#x2014;there is one with a sentry by it at the other side of the Serpentine which you could take the model of. Is it not too bad that the d&#x2014;d Yankees should have their Dial &#x26; we not even an Hour-Glass? I really do believe that if you could find some fit subordinate of yours to make Editor &#x26; would give your own name &#x26; help, the time is come for doing something. I observe every body&#x2019;s ears growing so large &#x26; long that the vacuities must at last have some rational matter put into them. You would find men enough to write more or less judiciously &#x26; though there would be no profits there would surely be readers enough to keep it going. Besides that there are some who would contribute funds for a while&#x2014; Do think of this without one of those Satanic grins of yours&#x2014;which the old snake must have left stamped on the Tree of Knowledge (where you found it) as Col. Crockett by looking at a lump on a tree, which he mistook for an opossum, left with his countenance imprinted on the bark.&#x2014; One Philip Harwood (whom you grin at) has been writing an article on the Science of History in the Westminster which is the best voice on that matter I have heard in English&#x2014; He would help in <hi rend="italic">the</hi> Magazine. Surely Puseyism has gone on long enough as Lord Mayor&#x2019;s shows &#x26; the Cholera &#x26; by this time we might try to have something better were it only for variety.&#x201D; David Crockett (<date when="1786-00-00">1786</date>&#x2013;<date when="1836-00-00">1836</date>), American frontiersman.</note> has several times passed thro&#x2019; my own head: about last year this time, I can remember, it was there in so <pb id="pg-15-160" n="15:160"/>lively a state that I wrote of it to somebody or other,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-15/lt-18411027-TC-JGM-01">TC to [JGM]. <date when="1841-10-27">27 Oct. 1841</date></ref>.</note>&#x2014;apparently not to you. The enormous confusions that obstruct any fair foundation of such an enterprise, and then the enormous labours of carrying it on, with the small and uncertain outlook of the same, had driven it into the distance again. I do not at present receive the suggestion with a Satanic grin from the Tree of Knowledge; far from it! I myself would cheerfully undertake the editor function, and go right heartily into it, were the thing feasible. Nay I suppose were these detestable dust-mountains of <hi rend="italic">Civil-Wars</hi> Folios once out of my way,&#x2014;fatal dust mountains in which three years of my life already lie buried, without as yet the smallest visible fraction of a result,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC noted in his Journal, <date when="1842-10-25">25 Oct.</date>: &#x201C;For many months there has been no writing here. Alas, what was there to write? About myself nothing; or less if that were possible! I have not yet got one word to stand upon paper in regard to Oliver. The <hi rend="italic">beginnings</hi> of work are even more formidable than the executing of it. &#x2026; Some hundreds of times I have felt, and scores of times I have said and written, that Oliver is an <hi rend="italic">impossibility</hi>. Yet I am still found at it,&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">without</hi> any visible result at all! Remorse too, for my sinful disgraceful sloth, accompanies me; as it well may. I am, as it were, without a language.&#x2014; Tons of dull Books I have read on this matter, and it is still only looking as thro&#x2019; thick mists on my eye. &#x2026; Alas! alas!&#x201D;</note>&#x2014;it is very likely I might resume the enterprise as one really to be attempted.</p>
<p>Two things as you say seem very plain: first that there is at present no preaching in England, and a visibly growing appetite (the sternest <hi rend="italic">necessity</hi> there has long been) to have some: and second, that the Printing Press is the only or by far the chief Pulpit in these days. Whether in that case we are not verily to set about erecting, by way of <hi rend="italic">new</hi> Paul&#x2019;s Cross<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In the NE angle of the churchyard of St. Paul&#x2019;s cathedral was the ancient &#x201C;Powle&#x2019;s Cross,&#x201D; or St. Paul&#x2019;s Cross, an open-air pulpit surmounted by a cross, where sermons were preached for cents. before it was removed by parliament in <date when="1643-00-00">1643</date>; see TC&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Historical Sketches</hi> 92&#x2013;93.</note> for the nineteenth Century, some Miscellany, Magazine, Review or Periodical Publication of our own, and speaking out with amazing plainness therefrom? Alas, it is beset with impediments; a most questionable adventure, tho&#x2019; actually not without promise too!</p>
<p>Difficulties are many; but the preliminary desperate difficulty is always with me the question, What <hi rend="italic">writers</hi> are there? Supposing all else smooth, Who is to write? Really except yourself I cannot at the moment recollect one English soul whom I should reckon much of a trump card in that game! Your Harewood<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Philip Harwood.</note> is one of a considerable class, of great worth, nay of inestimable worth in comparison, for they <pb id="pg-15-161" n="15:161"/>are <hi rend="italic">sincere</hi>, as not one of the old hacks is or was: but the writing talent of the class is by no means transcendent.</p>
<p>On the whole suppose you try to elaborate the scheme of such a thing practically in your head; to make an actual list of Writers;&#x2014;especially a list of &#x201C;people with funds&#x201D; that might be applied to! I will give it more consideration when you shew it me in that shape. Gradually the thing may ripen.&#x2014; As for me at present, I am sunk under a thousand fathoms of short rubbish; and feel for most part as if I should have the life choked clean out of me there, and never in this world be heard of more. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Eheu!</hi></foreign></p>
<p>An American Woman has compiled, in two pretty little volumes, a <hi rend="italic">Life of Jean Paul;</hi><note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Eliza Buckminster Lee (<date when="1794-00-00">1794</date>&#x2013;<date when="1864-00-00">1864</date>), <hi rend="italic">The Life of Jean Paul F. Richter</hi> (Boston, <date when="1842-00-00">1842</date>), a trans. of Richter&#x2019;s autobiography with a short biographical sketch of her own. She is said to have been a disciple or follower of TC.</note> with very little talent, except a loving heart and a deft pair of scissors; yet with a remarkable success for her readers. It is a tropical grove, of thousand flowers and fragrances; and the image of Jean Paul, in white hat and wide green coat, is ever and anon visible thro&#x2019; it. I have not read a pleasanter book for many months. How easily might good books be made, if people were not themselves bad!&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>Poor Allan Cunningham: the news of his sudden summons falls stern and heavy on me. A rough true mass of manhood, with far more faculty than he himself knew of. One human face&#x2014;that always smiled on me will smile on me no more.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sterling showed this letter to Caroline Fox, <date when="1842-11-04">4 Nov.</date>, and said: &#x201C;A loss &#x2026; which he can little afford, such is the warmth and exclusiveness of his affection&#x201D; (Fox 173).</note> <foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Sterling.</p>

<p><salute><hi rend="small-caps">Dear Mr. Strachey</hi>, &#x2014;</salute> The head must evidently have belonged to some son of Adam who lived a good while ago, and went through strange vicissitudes after burial. Though I doubt there is next to no chance of its ever having belonged to Cromwell, yet merely as an anatomical specimen and envious &#x201C;product of the <hi rend="italic">arts</hi>&#x201D; it seems well worth a journey to Camberwell, especially to such a courteous host&#x2019;s <pb id="pg-15-162" n="15:162"/>as Mr.&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2019;s. Pray let my thanks be conveyed to him. I hope also to see your friend Mr. Gregory<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charles Hutton Gregory, identified by Strachey as &#x201C;my old schoolfellow&#x201D; who &#x201C;told me that a friend of his, Mr. &#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; by name, wished me to inform Carlyle that he was in possession of the head of Oliver Cromwell, and invited him to go and see it.&#x201D; After the decapitation of Cromwell&#x2019;s exhumed body (see <ref target="volume-15/lt-18420929-TC-EF-01">TC to EF, <date when="1842-09-29">29 Sept.</date></ref>), the head was placed on top of Westminster Hall, where it stayed till the <date when="1680-00-00">1680</date>s, when it seems to have been blown down, picked up by a sentry, and sold. It finally came to Josiah Wilkinson, probably the unnamed person in the letter. Eventually it was given to Sydney Sussex College, Cromwell&#x2019;s college at Cambridge, and buried in <date when="1960-00-00">1960</date>. See Antonia Fraser, <hi rend="italic">Cromwell, Our Chief of Men</hi> (<date when="1973-00-00">1973</date>) 697&#x2013;98. Strachey reports that TC never saw it.</note> by and by. But at present I am too weakly with a dirty, sneaking sore throat, the fruit of easterly winds; and indeed, through winter generally I am unequal to a <hi rend="italic">night</hi> adventure so far as Camberwell. Perhaps Mr. &#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; would see me some time by daylight on a Sunday or holiday? I should like to look on this notable piece of Anak-Reality<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Anaks were a race of giants slaughtered by the Israelites; see Joshua 11:21.</note> (supposing it to be only such), and hear what account it gives of itself. The history of poor Oliver, from his cradle to his grave, and even beyond it, is such a mere mass of stupid fables as never, or hardly ever, elsewhere clustered themselves round the memory of a great man. In other times and conditions he would have been sung of as a demigod, and here Tyburn gallows<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On which his exhumed body was hanged.</note> was in all ways the lot of him! It is really painful to consider such depth of sheer thick stupidity, and total want of sense for the godlike in man is very sure to punish itself; as, alas! we find it now in these quack-ridden generations everywhere too fatally doing. But the poor leather head at Camberwell is not to blame for much of this, surely. Let us leave it, therefore.</p>
<p>My wife is out of her cold, but hanging, as her wont is through winter, on the verge of another.</p>
<p>When your good mother approaches this country, I pray you give me notice.</p>
<p>You, I think, will be wise not to stir much out at present. I hope to see you again soon.</p>

<p><salute>My dear friend&#x2014;</salute>So far let me adopt your style; for so far it is exactly after my own heart&#x2014; Your surprising present<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Her copy of Samuel Laurence&#x2019;s drawing of TC (done <date when="1838-07-00">July 1838</date>) owned by Sterling. Caroline Fox noted in her journal, <date when="1842-07-14">14 July</date>: &#x2018;Tea at the Sterlings&#x2019;. I did not notice in its right place the admirable living sketch of Carlyle which Mrs. Carlyle told Sterling of, saying it was the best that had been done, and that she thought the artist, Samuel Laurence, meant to give it her. Sterling went to Laurence, found that he had no such intention, bought it, and with much triumph displayed it to the lady. It is a thoroughly satisfactory portrait&#x201D; (Fox 169). For a reproduction, see 8:frontispiece [viewable in the <hi rend="italic">CLO</hi> on the vol. 8 table of contents page]. Anna Fox had written, <date when="1842-10-23">23 Oct.</date>: &#x201C;I have been trying to make a copy &#x26; <hi rend="italic">have</hi> made only a rough little sketch (in which I fear thou wilt not see much likeness) of Lawrence&#x2019;s beautiful portrait, which John Sterling took home in such malicious triumph.&#x201D; It was to remind JWC &#x201C;how cruelly thou hast been wronged in not having the original.&#x201D;</note> has been in my hands since last night: but how to thank you in written words? The only satisfactory way of thanking you were to take you in my arms and give you a hearty kiss for it! And at this distance, plainly enough, no kiss is executable&#x2014;unless one of the chi<supplied>[l]</supplied>dren&#x2019;s<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> sort, blown from finger ends&#x2014;which <hi rend="italic">only</hi> the children, poor little souls, have imagination enough to get the smallest good of!</p>
<p>Truly it was a beautiful thought your copying that picture for me! and setting aside the cleverness of the performance, I should be more or less than woman if I did not feel touched by it! Leigh Hunt would write a long poem on such a <hi rend="italic">Good thought;</hi> Wordsworth might indite <hi rend="italic">five</hi> sonnets to it! For me; being neither Leigh Hunt, nor Wordsworth&#x2014;far less John Sterling, I can but celebrate it in humble prose, and I repeat; it was a <hi rend="italic">good</hi> thought, and <hi rend="italic">you</hi> must be a good girl to have had such a thought, and I like you for it still better than I did before.</p>
<p>What you suggest about Falmouth sounds very seductive. <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;Ah&#x201D;!</hi> (as my Husband says) if I had but a wishing-cap, or flying-carpet, or any of those swift and easy means of transportation which one reads <pb id="pg-15-164" n="15:164"/>of in early history! Oh if there were the smallest hope that when <hi rend="italic">there</hi>, I should have health and spirits enough to take the good of your Land of Promise! But both these conditions are unrealizable for me&#x2014;the last as impossible as the first&#x2014; So I must content myself with hoping that you will come again next year, and that I shall be extant when you come&#x2014; The phenomena of those dear little bonnets, with the kind bright faces under them, cannot, believe me, recur too soon or too often for my wishes&#x2014;</p>
<p>Will you remember me to your sister and all of your family I am known to, and to John Sterling who I hope is relaxing a little in the writing of verses. My Husband is deep in his Cromwell indeed <hi rend="italic">beyond</hi> his depth in it&#x2014;to judge from the spluttering and crying out he is making!&#x2014; Plainly he needs some further inspiration than he has got yet&#x2014;even from his pilgrimage into Suffolk, or from the contemplation of three jaw-teeth and a shin-bone which he has had dug for him out of the field of Naisby!&#x2014; Whether he might find such in the Cannon ball I cannot pretend to say&#x2014;but for my part, I should much more willingly give <hi rend="italic">it</hi> house-room than the Naisby-relics<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Anna Fox had written: &#x201C;Do tell T.

The breakfast over; I sat down in my dressing-gown to repair my only wearing gown&#x2014;three days before I had put <hi rend="italic">one</hi> new wrist-band to it, and now it was full time to finish with the other&#x2014; As I <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> work in the Miss-Tanner-fashion it was eleven before I had got myself dressed&#x2014; Then arrived by appointment the Housekeeper for M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Reginald Buller, on her way from Glasgow to Troston, to receive my instructions as to the remaining fraction of her journey and to be told by me I knew not what&#x2014;for the last day I saw M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Buller she &#x201C;did not know the least in the world&#x201D; what she was saying&#x2014; One of those days with her in which when she asks for a <hi rend="italic">comb</hi> she means <hi rend="italic">her shoes</hi>&#x2014; The woman satisfied me entirely, a large, effectual Maternal looking woman, whom I should have chosen out of a thousand to put poor dear Regy into the hands of&#x2014; After half an hours speech with her, I sent her off to the Golden cross<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mrs. Lowry. Coaching inn and booking office, Charing Cross.</note> to secure her place for Monday&#x2014;and sat down to inform Reginald she was under way&#x2014;and would need to be picked up with her boxes at Bury&#x2014;that done; the housekeeper concern at least would be finished off, and then I would write to my Babbie in peace&#x2014; But in the midst of my writing enter Helen with a letter post marked Ixworth&#x2014; Here you must stop and read the said letter which I will enclose.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Reginald Buller wrote very precisely that he preferred to keep Mrs. Davis as housekeeper for Troston as she did not want to come to London, but suggested that Mrs. Lowry might suit his brother there.</note>&#x2014; Well!&#x2014;was not <hi rend="italic">there</hi> a pretty mess?&#x2014;what on earth to do? let the poor woman go on and plump into the thick of this cabal or try to stop her till it had settled itself&#x2014; I absolutely thumped my brow in despair&#x2014;at last I decided in letting Destiny take its course&#x2014;but you may fancy how many more pages it required to make all the reasons plain to the <pb id="pg-15-166" n="15:166"/>capacity of a Regy: besides soothing his agitated mind&#x2014; And then an equally long letter had to be improvised to Regy&#x2019;s Mother&#x2014;and that again enclosed in a few lines to Mr Strachey&#x2014;Mrs Buller&#x2019;s new address having escaped my memory&#x2014;sixteen pages of close writing went among them&#x2014;and I am sure there was not one superfluous line!</p>
<p>All this scribbling, brought me to the post hour and a dinner of stewed beef&#x2014;and an hour on the sofa afterwards was hardly enough to compose my distracted &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">brains</hi>&#x201D; (as Rio says)&#x2014; After tea I sat down with the gathered up wreck of my faculties to mend the <hi rend="italic">last</hi> of the shirts&#x2014;when tap tap&#x2014;another note from M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Jameson (about the five pounds) the contents of which required to be immediately communicated to Pepoli<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-15/lt-18421024-JWC-ABJ-01">JWC to ABJ, [<date when="1842-10-24">24 Oct.</date>]</ref>.</note>&#x2014;that done, again I turned to the shirt&#x2014;feeling even sewing a blessedness after so much writing&#x2014;but again the knocker with loud single stroke shook me to the center of my poor being&#x2014;and Helen brought me a note to which an answer was to be returned by the Bearer&#x2014; I tore it up with a quite piteous &#x201C;Oh merciful Heaven&#x201D; and found it a hurried request from Miss Macready that I would send <hi rend="italic">Madame Fochetti&#x2019;s</hi> address&#x2014;or if I did not know it send the Bearer to where it could be had as &#x201C;William&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Charles Macready.

<p>I could hardly help saying to myself when I went to bed after all this &#x201C;if ever I undertake anything for the good of any human being again&#x201D;!</p>

<dateline>Evening</dateline>
<p>Oh Babbie such a day of human speech&#x2014; I was interrupted by William Cunningham who sat two hours and a half!&#x2014;sat out Craik, Weir<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Weir.</note> and Darley!&#x2014; Now consider that party and fancy me, with my <hi rend="italic">uncertain</hi> voice, in the midst of it!&#x2014; Darley who cannot speak&#x2014;Craik who cannot be spoken to, and Weir who is as deaf as a post! But the three incompatabilities went before I was tempted to take my dagger to them and left me to resume an ethical discussion with William Cunningham. The motives of human action&#x2014;the aims of <hi rend="italic">ditto</hi> the nature <pb id="pg-15-168" n="15:168"/>and qualities of <hi rend="italic">ditto</hi>&#x2014;finding there was going to be no end to it I told him at last, that the <hi rend="italic">action</hi> which was always stopping at every step, to ask from whence it came, and whither it was going, and what was its merit or demerit appeared to me in danger of getting into &#x201C;a regular fix&#x201D; at all events or becoming inordinately self-conceited&#x2014;and that I could sooner forgive a man who did wrong unconsciously than one who lived in a continual pretension to do right&#x2014;</p>
<p>But all this while I have not thanked you for your dear long letter&#x2014; <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;Ah&#x201D;!</hi> your little <hi rend="italic">imagination</hi> moved me almost to tears&#x2014;and I could have stretched out my arms and caught the visionary Babbie and &#x201C;kissed&#x201D; her not once or twice but twenty times over&#x2014; I kiss nobody at present&#x2014;I do not know how I may <hi rend="italic">look</hi> to Plattnauer but I certainly <hi rend="italic">feel</hi> &#x201C;cross&#x201D;&#x2014;and excessively.</p>
<p>I was twice to Knightsbridge during the last week&#x2014;M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Sterling is really ill&#x2014;is threatened the Dr says with disease of the heart&#x2014;and I must go to her often so long as I keep on foot&#x2014;not because her husband asks it of me with ever ready tears but in gratitude for all the kind nursing she bestowed on myself when she was less wearisome than now&#x2014; It is to be said however&#x2014;and that is really the most serious looking symptom I see about her that her disposition is strangely softened and improved from what it was in summer&#x2014;the continual <hi rend="italic">fret</hi> about everything and nothing has quite subsided&#x2014; She has become affectionate, and studious about other peoples comfort as of old, and seems to cling to <hi rend="italic">me</hi> as of old to cheer her solitude&#x2014; I am glad that it is thus&#x2014;for I should have felt myself bound to be good to her in whatever frame of mind&#x2014; And the continuance of the mood she had got into in summer would have made all kindness from me of no avail to <hi rend="italic">her</hi>, and very up-hill work to myself&#x2014; But it is a pity she is so far off in this cold weather&#x2014;</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">basket</hi> Harriet spoke of is come, and I wish that I could send you a sight of it&#x2014;for I am sure that you would like&#x2014;at all events that <hi rend="italic">Mary</hi><note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jeannie Welsh&#x2019;s sister.</note> would like to immitate it&#x2014; It is almost the same shape and size as yours only with a handle&#x2014;a paste-board frame worked all over basketwise with straw-coloured braid and lined with quilted green satin&#x2014;at a distance it looks like any other white basket but near at hand it is very beautiful&#x2014;. Another present I have received last week of a much less satisfactory nature&#x2014;one of the nice little <hi rend="italic">tame Foxes</hi> has copied for me the sketch of my Husband carried away in triumph from Lawrences by John Sterling&#x2014;the intention was beautiful but the performance&#x2014;never never was anything so hideous in shape of a likeness! I not only would not hang it up on any wall for the world but wish very <pb id="pg-15-169" n="15:169"/>much that &#x201C;the devil would fly away with it&#x201D; out of the house&#x2014; It is carefully secured under glass too! Poor little well meaning but mistaken Quakeress; and of course I had to write her a letter of <hi rend="italic">thanks!</hi><note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-15/lt-18421103-JWC-AMF-01">JWC to AMF, [<date when="1842-11-03">3 Nov.</date>]</ref>.</note> You may conceive the difficulty!</p>
<p>Carlyle is going on much as usual&#x2014;Helen ditto&#x2014;the cat only seems <hi rend="italic">better</hi> than usual&#x2014;its spirits are almost too much for me!&#x2014; Helen says &#x201C;it is the strangest cat, it is just <hi rend="italic">dottedly</hi> fond of her, really <hi rend="italic">adores</hi> her, to say the truth, and yet it will not suffer her to touch it.&#x201D; In what manner it had expressed its <hi rend="italic">adoration</hi>, I could not discover&#x2014; Mercy I had as near as possible forgotten&#x2014;the potatoes&#x2014;I can say now quite decidedly <hi rend="italic">No</hi> do not send any&#x2014;the mans are so much improved that it were ingratitude both towards him and Providence to seek further&#x2014; C.&#x2019;s hair is creeping slowly over the tops of his ears but that is all the way it has got&#x2014; Meanwhile the <hi rend="italic">cotton</hi> is still used for <hi rend="italic">one</hi> ear&#x2014;in which however it never stays long, but is generally to be seen (not without astonishment by the uninitiated) sticking, a small white pellet, at the end of some stray hair&#x2014;for all the world like a snowberry! The French-Man did not give the fifteen pounds for the watches&#x2014;would give no <hi rend="italic">money</hi>&#x2014;only <hi rend="italic">hopes</hi> of money&#x2014;which were not available for paying a bill&#x2014;and then, as I had always foretold, <hi rend="italic">he</hi> got fourteen pounds to pay in addition, at the very same moment for that thriftless Scipioni Pestrucci<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Scipione Pistrucci (ca. <date when="1814-00-00">1814</date>&#x2013;<date when="1854-00-00">54</date>), Filippo&#x2019;s son, friend and collaborator of Mazzini.</note>&#x2014;of course there was nothing for it but the old resource&#x2014;borrowing on exorbitant interest from the moneylenders!&#x2014; He said to me with a bitter smile&#x2014; &#x201C;I am <hi rend="italic">fortunate</hi> you see!&#x2014; I have always <hi rend="italic">credit</hi>.&#x201D; Surely he has been so imposed on by one and another of them of late that he will become a <hi rend="italic">little</hi> wiser&#x2014;</p>
<p>Now if I have left what I am about to tell you to the very end, it is not by any means that I reckon it the least event of the week&#x2014; I had a letter the other day from Cavaignac and he will come before the winter end, if all go right&#x2014; With all men &#x201C;appearances are deceitful,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">sometimes</hi>&#x2014;but with Cavaignac they are almost <hi rend="italic">invariably</hi> so!&#x2014;and having found this on long knowledge of him, I never now judge him by appearances; accordingly his silence all these months, which in any other so related to me, I should have accounted ungracious not to say unfeeling&#x2014;in him I accepted merely as one of his <hi rend="italic">eccentricities</hi> from which no sure indication was to be discovered of his actual feelings towards me which ought not therefore to be allowed to influence <hi rend="italic">my</hi> feelings towards him. And this time as always he has justified my great <hi rend="italic">faith</hi>. After alluding quite slightly to vexations he has had and illness <pb id="pg-15-170" n="15:170"/>he has had he says with that manly frankness which so delights me in him&#x2014;&#x201C;<foreign>n&#x2019;avoir pas senti un <hi rend="italic">besoin</hi> de vous ecrire un mot de sympathie et d&#x2019;amicale consolation qui l&#x2019;import&#xe2;t sur tout ce qui me tenait&#x2014;c&#x2019;etait &#xE0; ne pas se reconnaitre soi-meme</foreign><note n="15" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Not to have felt a need to write you a word of sympathy and friendly consolation which carried with it all that touched me&#x2014;that was not to know what one was about&#x201D;; referring to JWC&#x2019;s loss of her mother.</note>&#x2014;so long as the <foreign><hi rend="italic">soi-meme</hi></foreign> continues friend to me I am mighty indifferent about the rest&#x2014; Oh Babbie dear! I do think that the men in constituting themselves our judges are very unjust to us! One thing for example how often one hears them say! That women value the <hi rend="italic">small change</hi> of friendship quite above the solid gold&#x2014;or to speak in plain English, that we prefer those who &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">set in chairs</hi>&#x201D; for us and pay us all sorts of small attentions, to those who, in neglecting them, have nevertheless our interests really at heart! Silly women do so, and do many other silly things&#x2014; And I should like to know, is the conduct of silly <hi rend="italic">men</hi> always perfect?&#x2014; But a woman of sense&#x2014;I judge by myself&#x2014;(!)&#x2014;can dispense with the &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">small change</hi>&#x201D; without a sigh, when she knows that a true affection is felt for her&#x2014;only where she has no ground to believe in such an affection, is she pocket for the small change with &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">a certain</hi>&#x201D; thankfulness; is not <hi rend="italic">that</hi> her goodness rather than her folly?&#x2014;</p><lb/>
<dateline>Monday Morning</dateline>
<p>You received my last letter a day later than you ought to have done&#x2014; Carlyle took it with two others of mine to the post office&#x2014;put in some letters of his own out of a separate pocket and brought back my three an hour and half after post time&#x2014; &#x201C;It was no fault of his&#x201D; however!&#x2014;&#x201C;he had no recollection of ever having charged himself with them&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>
<p>One thing more before I conclude&#x2014;I am shocked to find that you sit up so late! I had hoped that in returning to your family you would have proved a little leaven of righteousness in that matter, that might by and by &#x201C;leaven the whole lump&#x201D;&#x2014;instead of which I hear of <hi rend="italic">you</hi> keeping up your sister till three in the morning, and writing &#x201C;two hours after I have been in bed&#x201D;&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>

<p>One thing I do think may be honestly said in its praise&#x2014;that it is written in capital english,&#x2014;for a foreigner&#x2014;</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I am very glad to hear that you are got safe to Cheltenham again, which I think is so many miles nearer us; glad also that there is a likelihood of your being back in London before long.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Carlyle had said, <date when="1842-11-08">8 Nov.</date>, that he and Ogilby would leave Malvern for Cheltenham &#x201C;tomorrow,&#x201D; and that they would probably &#x201C;be in London before the end of the mouth,&#x201D; where his patient had rented &#x201C;the same house in Chester Square for another year.&#x201D;</note> The weather is grown unfit for travelling; you will all be better here, I fancy. Our streets are got quite full again; the world all awakening to a new bout of winter work, real or imaginary,&#x2014;one round more, in this multifarious race-course of theirs; all the worse for them if it lead only round <hi rend="italic">and</hi> round! But that is in their own choice partly. And, at all events, Summer is the time for country; muddy winter, with its short days, for town.</p>
<p>It is the night now of a thorough rainy day; I did not get out till after dinner, and then only in spite of moisture. I have been scribbling eagerly all day; to very small purpose; for my hand is altogether out, and my subject is of all others the <hi rend="italic">impossible</hi> one! Without the <hi rend="italic">Black-Art</hi>, how is it possible? By <hi rend="italic">hard work</hi> perhaps, and invincible persevering toil,&#x2014;which is the only Black art; and a <hi rend="italic">black</hi> enough one, God knows!&#x2014; I scribble you a line of answer (on this detestable &#x2018;improved paper,&#x2019; on which no man can write except detestably), because tomorrow I shall not have time. Tomorrow I am to go with Forster to the theatre; meeting him at the Library Committee &#x26;c &#x26;c: the man came here expressly to ask, and I could not get him refused. I live as lonely <pb id="pg-15-173" n="15:173"/>as a Thebaid Eremite in general, the streets full of mere human <hi rend="italic">sprectra</hi> [<hi rend="italic">sic;</hi> spectres] to me: it is good sometimes, tho&#x2019; against my lazy will, that I go out and try to find man palpable.</p>
<p>We had Thackeray here, two nights ago; fresh from Ireland, and full of quizzical rather honest kind of talk: he is now off to Paris; has a Book on Ireland with caricatures nearly ready:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">The Irish Sketch-Book. By Mr. M. A. Titmarsh</hi>, 2 vols. (<date when="1843-00-00">1843</date>).</note> I cannot but wish poor Thackeray well. Nobody in this region has as much stuff to make a man out of,&#x2014;could he but <hi rend="italic">make</hi> him. Alas, it is as you once said to Will Carruthers and the &#x201C;culling of a few flowers&#x201D;: &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Cull</hi> them, then!&#x201D;&#x2014; Last night we had <hi rend="italic">Creek</hi>,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >G. L. Craik.</note> dry-as-dust; the night before, we had John Mill: few people are as good as an innocent Book to me; tho&#x2019; that also is often enough the night of small things. On the whole however, I have less to complain of than usual this year; and really ought to be thankful, or complain only of myself.</p>
<p>Jane went up to poor Mrs Cunningham, and was admitted; found her full of tears, but in a wholesome frame of mind. She does not seem to purpose shifting into Nithsdale, or any change like that; which surely is wise in her. Poor Allan&#x2019;s dust was laid in Kensal Green,&#x2014;far enough from his native Kirkmahoe. M&#x2019;Diarmid has a well-meant but very feckless Article upon him this week.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John M&#x2019;Diarmid in the <hi rend="italic">Dumfries Courier</hi>.</note></p>
<p>Today the passing-bell went tolling here: we learned that it was the poor old wooden Milkwoman, Wright, at the corner of our lane; her step too has passed for the last time. The husband is said to be in bed, refusing all food or consolation; his poor life rent rudely asunder in that manner. How true and mildly solemn is that of Goethe, applicable everywhere and everywhen:</p>
<lg><l><foreign>Eine Bresche ist Jeder Tag</foreign></l>
<l><foreign>Die viele Menschen erst&#xfc;rmen;</foreign></l>
<l><foreign>Wer auch in die L&#xfc;cke fallen mag,</foreign></l>
<l><foreign>Die Todten sich niemals th&#xfc;rmen!</foreign><note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Every day is a breach stormed by many men; however many fall into the gap, the dead bodies will never fill it up&#x201D; (&#x201C;Sprichw&#xF6;rtlich&#x201D;).</note></l></lg>
<p>No, the <hi rend="italic">breach</hi> is ever empty, clear; ever ready for a new forlorn-hope. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Allah akbar</hi></foreign> [God is great]: what more have we to say?</p>
<p>This poor little scraping of a Letter came from Jenny tonight; take it as an emblem of several things.</p>
<p>I gave Gambardella a <hi rend="italic">second</hi> sitting on Sunday; he altogether <hi rend="italic">spoiled</hi> the Picture, even in his own conceit; and has now brushed <pb id="pg-15-174" n="15:174"/>it out as I understand, and will never attempt another of that face. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Tant mieux</hi></foreign> [So much the better]. He is getting on greatly, however; and has done several excellent faces; especially one of a Mrs Milner Gibson (for &#xa3;50), which far excels all I have seen by any modern artist of my circle. The wild-man has a real eye in him for colours.&#x2014; <foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Brother; but goodnight to you!</p>

<salute>Dear Sterling,</salute>
<p>It must be admitted your List too is none of the richest!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sterling wrote to TC, <date when="1842-11-05">5 Nov.</date>, about possible contributors for the magazine he had suggested: &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Your</hi> list of writers &#x2026; is rather scanty. &#x2026; This is the part of the matter which surprises me. Yet I own when asked to name the right men they do not come very glibly. Often here and there in periodicals I find things that would be suitable. &#x2026; But the writers are anonymous like most of the Gods &#x26; Angels. To me however it seems that Harwood &#x26; others like him could be made to do good service. There is some one (a friend of Mill) who writes on Spinoza seemingly a wisish man. Mazzini must have good in him capable of coming out. A certain <hi rend="italic">Victorious Analysis</hi> at Edinburgh is said to look hopeful: &#x26; there are Cambridge men &#x2026; who <hi rend="italic">if encouraged</hi> by example would be nimble helpers.&#x201D; Barclay Fox also noted, <date when="1842-11-04">4 Nov.</date>, that Sterling was &#x201C;very full of a projected journal to supply the intellectual and moral wants of the 19th century,&#x201D; and that he had written to TC about it (<hi rend="italic">Barclay Fox&#x2019;s Journal</hi>, ed. R. L. Brett [<date when="1979-00-00">1979</date>] 294).</note> Little appears above ground for this enterprise; but Faith, as usual, has the presentiment and preassurance of much lying <hi rend="italic">under</hi>. To the blockhead all is barren, from Dan to Beersheba; it is Genius that carries a divining rod, and knows where the metals sleep!&#x2014; In reality, we must have this matter farther investigated, the feasibilities of it ascertained a little; and a general council of war held on it.</p>
<p>For the present I have another little bit of investigation for you: read it on that snip of print, which I have clipt from the Newspaper there indicated. It is above six weeks since the paragraph first turned up, in an abridged shape, and struck us considerably in the <hi rend="italic">Examiner;</hi> where &#x201C;Caradon&#x201D; was I did not know; and never till now, by great inquiries, could ascertain. It seemed to me I had not lately fallen in with a manfuller piece of heroism, of swift conclusive insight into what was fit to be done, and resolution to do it, than in this case of the poor self-immolating miner. &#x201C;Behold, we all die, if I hang here: it is my turn to die, and his to live,&#x2014;my turn, and I stand it!&#x201D; This is manlike; <pb id="pg-15-175" n="15:175"/>no spooney or inferior creature could have done it.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The clipping is reproduced by Isaac Foot opp. p. 22, marked by TC as from the &#x201C;Mining Journal, Railway and Commercial Gazette / <date when="1842-09-10">10 Sept<hi rend="italic">r</hi> 1842</date>. (Caradon is said to be near Liskeard).&#x201D; TC tells the story of the heroic action of the tin-miner Michael Verran (<date when="1808-00-00">1808</date>&#x2013;<date when="1862-00-00">62</date>) in his <hi rend="italic">Life of John Sterling, Works</hi> 11:215&#x2013;16, much as the <hi rend="italic">Gazette</hi> reported, though it added that the event had created &#x201C;a considerable sensation,&#x201D; and that not only was it seen as a &#x201C;miraculous intervention of Divine Providence,&#x201D; but that Verran&#x2019;s conduct was &#x201C;a noble instance of what a real Christian will do.&#x201D; Caroline Fox noted in her journal, <date when="1842-11-14">14 Nov.</date>, that TC had written to Sterling about &#x201C;the miner &#x2026; who so heroically devoted himself to the saving of his comrade&#x201D; (Fox 173). She was to take an active part in helping Verran. As TC explains, the event had also been reported in the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, <date when="1842-09-24">24 Sept.</date></note> Unseen too; not on Drury-lane stage at all; no clapping of hands or immortal need of glory to be looked for. I call it very great and noble:&#x2014;superior almost to Miss Martineau&#x2019;s pension;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date> Harriet Martineau had refused a Civil List pension, though in financial distress, because she said that she could not accept public money from an unjust system of taxation &#x201C;levied afflictively upon those, among others, whom I have made it my business to befriend (however humbly)&#x2014;the working classes.&#x201D; The correspondence with Charles Buller about the matter was pbd. in the press in <date when="1842-10-00">Oct.</date> without her knowledge (<hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, <date when="1842-10-22">22 Oct.</date>, rpt. from the <hi rend="italic">National Anti-Slavery Standard;</hi> see also Martineau, <hi rend="italic">Autobiography</hi> 2:174&#x2013;79 and 499&#x2013;507). The <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, <date when="1842-11-02">2 Nov.</date>, with much ridicule, had reported a meeting of &#x201C;assembled Chartists, Socialists, Deists, Atheists, and non-pensionists&#x201D; in London, <date when="1842-11-01">1 Nov.</date>, which voted thanks to her for unholding a great principle.</note> tho&#x2019; the Mechanics Institutes have not yet met to celebrate it!</p>
<p>Well, what I want you to do, is to ask the Foxes, or any benevolent fit person, to ascertain first of all whether the thing is, <hi rend="italic">in every point, exactly and undeniably true</hi>. As Liskeard and Caradon are in your quarter, this may prove accomplishable, by and by, without much difficulty.</p>
<p>What is then to be done, provided the thing <hi rend="italic">be</hi> true,&#x2014;if anything more is to be done,&#x2014;our benevolent fit Friend may himself help to advise. I am greatly against all lion &#x201C;prizes for virtue&#x201D;;&#x2014;poor Grace Darling, I partly surmise, has had her poor quiet life all broken up, her nerves shattered, her death itself not a little brought on, by that!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >She d. <date when="1842-10-20">20 Oct.</date></note> At the same time, one feels as if such a man as this miner were fit for something better than breaking stones at the bottom of a damp pit. I know not what can be done with him. If any subscription or the like were thought good, I would gladly give my poor guinea among others. At all events, and if nothing whatever be done, I shall always know where a right brave man is living and labouring in this world along with me; and that of itself is worth something.</p>
<p>Good night, dear Sterling. The wet wind is moaning thro&#x2019; all crevices of Nature in these parts: I am tired with the whole day&#x2019;s confinement, <pb id="pg-15-176" n="15:176"/>and proceed now to knit up the ravelled sleeve of innumerable paltry cares<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Macbeth</hi> 2.2.</note> with one honest pipe of tobacco, my finale for the night Nightly, in that last pipe, I think of all friends, and go often enough to Falmouth,&#x2014;and much <hi rend="italic">farther</hi>, alas!</p>

<p>Only a line today Miss Babbie, just to say that I am rather out of humour with you! Only one letter in the week and that one <hi rend="italic">hasty</hi> as from the pen of a Secretary of State,&#x2014;bearing internal evidence of &#x201C;a small dance&#x201D; the night before. This is not well Miss Babbie&#x2014;is unnatural&#x2014;unfilial! If your correspondence have so relaxed in <hi rend="italic">one</hi> month; what is to be presaged about it after <hi rend="italic">six</hi> months? Oh but you have so many interruptions&#x2014;I can believe it! so have I!&#x2014;many interruptions! of every sort that it can enter into the imagination to conceive; except the <hi rend="italic">pleasurable</hi> sort the <hi rend="italic">small-dance</hi>-sort, which do not beseem my years&#x2014; And see the difference!&#x2014;if I do not write to you every day of the week; at least I put writing enough for every day of the week into one letter! and yet it were more excusable in me than in you to surrender to interruptions. <hi rend="italic">You</hi> are young&#x2014;and I, &#x201C;what shall I say,&#x201D; have considerably the advantage of you in the matter of years&#x2014;tho Gambardella, I am told, <hi rend="italic">does</hi> regret publically &#x201C;that I am a <hi rend="italic">young woman</hi> for if I were only of the age of M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Follen<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Eliza Lee Follen, b.

<p>Four nights this week in succession we have had some one here&#x2014;first Forster&#x2014;next night Thackeray&#x2014;the next John Mill and little M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Grant&#x2014;and last night Craik the third time that this last mentioned individual has come within ten days!&#x2014;this proceeds from Carlyle&#x2019;s open-armed treatment of him&#x2014;which if it was indulgent before is now most gracious; since he became aware of his Werterean proceeding with his wife<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Meaning, since TC became aware of Craik&#x2019;s &#x201C;Werterean passion&#x201D; for her.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>You heard by the Letter sent to Scotsbrig that all your good things arrived safe here, and were welcomed with affection and gratitude as proofs of <hi rend="italic">your</hi> continued affection for us. I have never yet answered your Letter, but this too gave me great pleasure: alas, we cannot speak much to one another; but I know you never cease to feel all that is brotherly for me; I can know that by what I feel within myself. Thanks for all these kind gifts; and as the old Proverb says, &#x201C;May ne&#x2019;er waur be amang us!&#x201D;</p>
<p><pb id="pg-15-179" n="15:179"/>Jane praises her <hi rend="italic">peppers</hi> as excellent; and every morning I hear the celebration of the Ham,&#x2014;and indeed <hi rend="italic">practically</hi> join in the same. We are getting steadily thro&#x2019; it by instalments; one <foreign><hi rend="italic">junk</hi></foreign> [thick piece] boiled after another: it is a piece of good stuff, and very wholesome for poor dyspeptic people. I would all that need it had but the like.&#x2014; You never told me what the price of the Tobacco was; nor perhaps will you ever, if I were to ask! But that was a thing ordered in the regular commercial way; and therefore I must guess some price, that I may be able freely to apply again. It is the best tobacco I have smoked for a year past;&#x2014;and very busy I am with it in these very days. Always when the writing gets &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">stiff t&#x2019; ye rise</hi>,&#x201D; the pipe is sure to go rapidly!&#x2014; The cheapest price for tobacco here at present is 5/ a pound: they have raised it, the dogs, on account of some new Excise regulations that prevent them from adulterating it with sugar. At this rate, the 4 lbs will just be a sovereign; for which sum I accordingly insert a Post-Office order here. If there be any overplus (which I do not think likely), you can give it to Tom<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alexander Carlyle&#x2019;s son (b. <date when="1833-00-00">1833</date>).</note> to buy <hi rend="italic">bowls</hi> with. My invincible Postman; of the most illustrious punctuality! I hope he is daily growing a better scholar, and means to be a credit to the name.</p>
<p>Yesterday there came a Letter from my good Mother and Jamie, which I was very thankful for: pray tell them that I will answer without much loss of time. My dear good Mother: her little bits of Letters are always precious to me! She hangs up here on the wall now, over the Mantel-piece, on my right hand, while I write; she seems always to be looking down, wishing me good speed!&#x2014; My writing, after a terrible haggle, does begin to move a little, tho&#x2019; a very little: I have to be thankful for the day of small things; I must beat lustily while the metal is redhot;&#x2014;I have very little time to write anything else.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably on what was to be <hi rend="italic">Past and Present;</hi> cf. <ref target="volume-15/lt-18421116-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1842-11-16">16 Nov.</date></ref>, &#x201C;a small thing.&#x201D;</note></p>
<p>The Dr said he had heard from you. Two little Notes from him have come since he left you: he is now at a place called Cheltenham, some 80 miles off this, and speaks of perhaps being back here &#x201C;about the end of the month.&#x201D; I believe he has much <hi rend="italic">weariness</hi> to front where he is; he keeps all his <hi rend="italic">thoughts</hi> in a kind of abeyance, and merely <hi rend="italic">clatters:</hi> that is the reason too why his Notes are so brief and barren. If he should ever chance to take a notion of marrying, he might still start practice, and become a physician and householder; but this, I suppose, grows more and more unlikely. We have all much reason to love him; and to be glad for his sake, that so many things have gone well with him.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-15-180" n="15:180"/>I had a small scrap of a Note too from Jenny, who seemed to <supplied>[be]</supplied><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> going off to Dumfries for a few days. Once, a while ago, there came an American Newspaper; which, with great effort, I conjectured at last to have come from the poor Luckless Rob. I am sorry for the wretched Slut of a creature; but he has the enemy within his own self: what can, in that case, be done for him!&#x2014; Jenny, I take it, is not very happy at Gill; but she seems diligent, thrifty and peaceable. Perhaps she will be able by and by to chalk out for herself some freer path: she is coming over to our Mother for a while, which I am very glad of; you will then have more opportunity of ascertaining how matters stand with her.</p>
<p>Your business, there is little doubt, must have been greatly obstructed by the miserable state of business generally for many months back. There never was such a time, by all accounts, since England was a country. There have been frightful dearths and natural scarcities in old times: but all is abundant at present, and <hi rend="italic">nobody can get it!</hi> Things are getting to such a frightful pass, most people begin to perceive that there must be a change before long. It would not surprise me to see the Corn Laws off, before we be <hi rend="italic">very</hi> much older! That will probably give a great excitement to every kind of business: but, alas, it will be very far from settling the sad account of matters. We are <hi rend="italic">all</hi> gone far astray; we have <hi rend="italic">forgotten</hi> (which of us has <hi rend="italic">not</hi> forgotten?) what his real course as a man and Immortal Soul was; have run after money, money, and one folly and another;&#x2014;till the general <hi rend="italic">sum</hi> of our errors has become great indeed!&#x2014; I told my peace in general about all that; there is small use in talking. <hi rend="italic">Let us all repent, and amend</hi>. Let each of us for himself do it:&#x2014;that is the grand secret!&#x2014;</p>
<p>You would notice the death of poor Allan Cunningham in the Newspapers. It was and is a real sorrow to us. Of late years I did not see very much of him; but always when we did meet, he was blithe to me like an elder Brother: a right truehearted brave man! He had a steep and rugged enough pilgrimage, and might have run to wreck often enough, had he been other than a wise true-seeing man. Poor Allan! I saw him on the street about three weeks ago, and spoke a word or two with him; I shall never see him more now. He died of apoplexy, quite suddenly; it was the second shock he had had, and ever since the first he had been &#x201C;numb and weak,&#x201D; as he would sometimes tell me. He meant always to get back to green native Nithsdale; but it was not to be!</p>
<p><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Brother; I must not scribble any more at present. <pb id="pg-15-181" n="15:181"/>Jane sends her kind wishes and regards to all of you. Good ever be with you all!</p>

<salute>Dear Mrs Welsh,</salute>
<p>Finding there was no chance in New Zealand for the present, I bethought me of applying to Mr Elliot, chief the Government Emigration Commission, whom I have known with great esteem for many years now. Unfortunately he also is not able to do very much for us; but he points out at least what the possibilities of the thing are; and as it is all under his superintendence there is no use in applying elsewhere on that quest. I send you his Letter, which will be well worth reading; for he is a most punctual, accurate and one of the clearest-sighted men, and undertakes (I have always found) as nearly as possible just what he means to practice. He is one of the Lord Minto Elliots;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Frederick Elliot (<date when="1808-00-00">1808</date>&#x2013;<date when="1880-00-00">80</date>), chairman of board of advice and management over colonial land and emigration, <date when="1840-00-00">1840</date>&#x2013;<date when="1847-00-00">47</date>; later permanent asst. undersec. for the colonies; cousin of Gilbert (<date when="1782-00-00">1782</date>&#x2013;<date when="1859-00-00">1859</date>), 2d earl of Minto, <date when="1814-00-00">1814</date>; see <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380618-TC-JOST-01"><sic>10:106</sic><corr>TC to JOST, <date when="1838-06-18">18 June 1838</date></corr></ref>. He had been asked to find a position for John Welsh.</note> a man in the very best estimation here.</p>
<p>As to the Falkland Islands,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The group of S Atlantic islands administered as a crown colony by Britain since <date when="1833-00-00">1833</date>; claimed by Argentina. George Rennie became gov., <date when="1847-00-00">1847</date>&#x2013;<date when="1855-00-00">55</date>.</note> tho&#x2019; very unwilling to risk an advice, I think I may venture to say that there is clearly nothing whatever to be done <hi rend="italic">there</hi>. The proposed salary for a surveyor appears but to be &#xa3;300 a year. The Islands are a mere mass of peat-bog with everlasting tempests, and the population at present is some twenty-two miscellaneous vagabonds dwelling in seven turf huts! The use of the Colony is to be for ships returning from New South Wales, which have no port at present in those seas; the main industry is expected to be fishing of seals; the first immigrants are to be Shetlanders or West Highlanders.</p>
<p>With regard to New Zealand I myself know little; except that it is said to be hitherto a flourishing place; that several persons known to me are interested in it, and sanguine about it. I hear, however, that the interior surface is full of barren old-volcanic Hills; that it can never be a first-rate country. <hi rend="italic">New</hi> Colonies too are of course apt to be in a <hi rend="italic">rougher</hi> state than old ones; to abound more in <hi rend="italic">uncertainties</hi>, irregularities of all kinds. On the other hand, they are perhaps <pb id="pg-15-182" n="15:182"/><hi rend="italic">opener</hi> for adventure, offer a freer field. If your Son thought of trying New Zealand, he can be introduced (as I have learned) &#x201C;to the best people there&#x201D; in a sufficiently emphatic manner.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-15/lt-18420805-JWC-MW-01">JWC to MW, [<date when="1842-08-05">5 Aug.</date>?]</ref>. TC had thought of emigrating there himself, as a newspaper ed. in <date when="1833-00-00">1833</date>; see K. J. Fielding, &#x201C;Unpublished Manuscripts&#x2014;1: Carlyle Among the Cannibals,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Carlyle Newsletter</hi> 1 (<date when="1979-00-00">1979</date>):27.</note></p>
<p>With regard to New South Wales, again, which you yourselves can better judge of, I will say only that Mr Elliot&#x2019;s Letter to the Governor is not likely to <supplied>[be]</supplied> <hi rend="italic">less</hi> significant than it pretends to be. But what the Governor has in his power, or what the wants of the Colony are in the surveying line, I have no precise knowledge.</p>
<p>On the whole it seems to me, however all this may be, your son
should first <hi rend="italic">practically</hi> learn to <hi rend="italic">be</hi> a real Surveyor and Engineer: it seems that even <hi rend="italic">with</hi> this there is no Government appointment to be had at present in the Colonies; but without it there is no right chance anywhere. I think it would be decidedly reasonable to lay out a portion of the &#xa3;500 of outfit first of all on <hi rend="italic">this</hi>. I suppose there are good Surveyors and Engineers in Edinburgh. A man can learn nothing till he has <hi rend="italic">worked</hi> at it. My judgement of our young Cousin is, that if he once felt himself fairly qualified to shew face as an Engineer and Surveyor, he might be very safely trusted in N. South Wales, or any other reasonable place. He will break far off kind, if he be not of a quick, correct judgement; of a clear, truthful, honourable and steadfast character: these are the elements of success for a man. It will be no evil, but a great good, as he may find one day, that he begins <hi rend="italic">poor;</hi> actually so.</p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Along with this comes a Manchester Newspaper, which arrived here this morning;&#x2014;out of which Jane has already cut a great hole! The <hi rend="italic">hole</hi> contained, you may understand, something about me; so I have borrowed the <hi rend="italic">cut-out</hi> piece of Newspaper, that you too might have a reading of it; and here it is in this Letter cover. You are to send it back again clean and safe: that is the sole condition! It will gratify you for a moment; and that surely is worth a penny!</p>
<p>The thing seems to be extracted from some Magazine published at Annan, and is very cleverly and kindly done. Who can have done it? Unless Johnston the good Schoolmaster, I cannot guess. What he says of my Father and my Mother is very gratifying to me.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The article was &#x201C;Thomas Carlyle, Author of &#x2018;Lectures on Heroes, Hero-Worship,&#x2019; &#x26;c.,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Border Magazine</hi> (<date when="1842-10-00">Oct. 1842</date>) 20&#x2013;27, pbd. by W. Cuthbertson, printer, Annan. It was probably by Robert William Thom (<date when="1816-00-00">1816</date>&#x2013;<date when="1890-00-00">90</date>); see Ian Campbell, &#x201C;Thomas Carlyle, Borderer,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Carlyle Newsletter</hi> 7 (<date when="1986-00-00">1986</date>), and Frank Miller, <hi rend="italic">Bibliography of the Parish of Annan</hi> (Dumfries, <date when="1925-00-00">1925</date>) 72, 81. Its value lies largely in its being so early a biographical account and its being based on local knowledge and interviews with neighbors who knew TC and his parents; it confirms TC&#x2019;s high opinion of his father: &#x201C;Such was the impression he left in the minds of his acquaintances, that they hesitate not to affirm, that Carlyle the father was naturally a greater man than Carlyle the son.&#x201D; It sees that TC&#x2019;s language was inherited from his father, confirms how outstanding he was at school and univ., states that at least one of the Divinity Hall sermons was &#x201C;much applauded&#x201D; and that the local people were proud of him: &#x201C;Fearless and intrepid he is &#x2026; but kind, pitiful, and tolerant. &#x2026; These qualities of mind are not to be mistaken in his writings.&#x201D; His mother is praised as &#x201C;a very superior, sensible, and pious woman.&#x201D; The newspaper was the <hi rend="italic">Manchester Guardian</hi>. Johnston the schoolmaster (see <ref target="volume-14/lt-18420207-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1842-02-07">7 Feb.</date></ref>) is not identified.</note> How <pb id="pg-15-185" n="15:185"/>thankful should I be that I have still my dear Mother to shew it to; tho&#x2019; my dear Father is not now there to hear it! He does not need it now.&#x2014; These things are a true reward to one; an encouragement amid many toils.</p>
<p>Your Letter with Jamie&#x2019;s, as Alick will have already told you, got duly to hand; and right welcome the little missive was. I could not at first, discerning <hi rend="italic">Jack&#x2019;s</hi> hand on the Letter-cover, understand the thing at all: but a little consideration shewed me how it had been. You must not give up writing to me, dear Mother; your Letters are always a little <hi rend="italic">blessing</hi>. At the same time I know what hard work it is for you; I will not exact Letter for Letter, but be content with what you can give&#x2014; Tell Jamie he shall be answered before long. Today I send him the <hi rend="italic">Dumfries Herald;</hi> Dr Russel of Thornhill (I think it must be he) generally sends it hither; I suppose, in return for a weekly rather useless Newspaper of mine which I still send to old Mr Dobbie,&#x2014;Mrs Welsh used to get it, and then he after her, worthy old man. If I knew to which of you this <hi rend="italic">Herald</hi> could be of any use, I would send it as long as it comes. Jack, I think, must send his copy to one of you, probably to Alick? This accordingly should go to some other, if to any. I send the <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi> always to <hi rend="italic">Canada</hi> now; oftenest without reading almost any of it, such a feeble concern has it grown. The <hi rend="italic">Herald</hi>, tho&#x2019; a foolish Tory, is worth ten of it.</p>
<p>You would hear of poor Allan Cunningham&#x2019;s death; and indeed will see something about it in this very <hi rend="italic">Herald</hi>. I called on Saturday last, on his Widow and Daughter, as Jane had done before. The good Widow was weeping much, yet soft tears; reflecting on much mercy that had been mingled with her sorrow;&#x2014;wholesomely resigned to a Higher Will. She told me Allan was unusually cheerful and talkative, just before the last fatal stroke; feeling himself suddenly unwell, he started up, ran to gaze in the looking glass, rubbed his brow (as he was wont, in sudden headaches); did not speak, when she spoke,&#x2014;alas, <hi rend="italic">could</hi> not speak. He started up a second time, and I think a third, to rub his brow at the lookingglass; then feeling how it all was, silently clasped his arms about his Wife and Daughter, and sank into the bed, and into the sleep which grew ever deeper! <pb id="pg-15-186" n="15:186"/>I was much affected. He was a good<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >End of MS 521.8.</note> true hearted man; a strong, assiduous valiant man. His poor old Mother, I see, still lives about Dumfries, at the age of ninety.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Elizabeth Cunningham, b. Harley, da. of a Dumfries merchant; m., ca. <date when="1765-00-00">1765</date>, John Cunningham (<date when="1743-00-00">1743</date>&#x2013;<date when="1800-00-00">1800</date>); they had five sons and four das.</note>&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>
<p>Jane is better than when you last heard: her cold gone; only occasional headaches plague her a little. She hardly goes out at all, except to see Mrs Sterling (a mile and half from us), who is not at all well at present.</p>
<p>I too am as solitary as I can manage to be, going out to see hardly anybody. I am busy writing; actually getting something to paper at present, tho&#x2019; a small thing! I must fire away while my hand is in.&#x2014; We have very wet weather often times; then cold raw blasts from the East: these latter I like very well: I can go out all buttoned up, take long strides, flourishing my stick, and walk like a lamp-lighter for two hours at a time! I am in a very fair state of health, beyond my average;&#x2014;fit for a little work: what would I be at?</p>
<p>The Dr talks of coming back hither about the end of the month: nay we heard yesterday from their washerwoman here (who is occasionally ours), that they <hi rend="italic">were</hi> come; that she was washing sheets, counterpanes and so forth: but we conclude, it is only some Servant sent to make the house ready for them.</p>
<p>Today I had a Letter from America, a Major Adair from Dumfries;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not further identified.</note> a great inroad of things and disturbances; which overset my work, and have made me decide on putting it off till the evening. This perhaps is the reason why <hi rend="italic">you</hi> have a Letter from me today!</p>
<p><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, my dear Mother; take care of yourself, and commend me to one and all. Good be ever with you, dear Mother!&#x2014; <closer><salute>Your affectionate</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>Darling&#x2014;</salute>the four ill written pages I sent you yesterday, evinced a more determined concern for your <hi rend="italic">happiness</hi>, than twenty well-written would have done under more favourable circumstances! For yesterday <pb id="pg-15-187" n="15:187"/>was a bad day with me, &#x201C;upon <hi rend="italic">my</hi> honour&#x201D; and the <hi rend="italic">second</hi> bad day too which made it the worse to bear up against. Now I am &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">pretty well</hi>&#x201D; again and hasten to make hay while the sun shines, that is to write while the rain rains&#x2014; With dry weather one may foresee there will come a flight of visitors to make up for time lost&#x2014;to <hi rend="italic">them</hi>. I have set a semptress to work&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">in the kitchen</hi>&#x2014;finding that the needlework of this house was threatening to engulph me bodily. I have written a trio of other-people&#x2019;s-business-notes, and now I am all for my Babbie!</p>
<p>First of the <hi rend="italic">Anniversary:</hi> &#x201C;The moral satisfaction was complete; the <hi rend="italic">financial</hi> rather disappointing.&#x201D; Thirteen pounds was the sum collected including the immortal five&#x2014;from which deduct the expences, and there would remain, I am afraid, zero, or perhaps even <hi rend="italic">a deficit</hi>&#x2014;the supper of itself must have gone with a half&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">forty five</hi> gallons of beer, <hi rend="italic">fifty</hi> pounds of macaroni, and roast beef of unascertained quantity!&#x2014;to be sure there were two hundred and fifty sat down to what the Dumfries courier would call &#x201C;the festive board,&#x201D; and the fine times of miraculous loaves and fishes<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The miracle of the feeding of the 5,000 given in all four gospels.</note> are long gone by: tho&#x2019; god knows if ever there was a time when men had more need of them! think of the boiled dead dog!&#x2014; The supper transacted itself in a tavern hard by, at the close of the business&#x2014;leaving the schoolroom to more poetical purposes&#x2014;to distribution of prizes&#x2014;speeches of &#x201C;The <hi rend="italic">founders</hi>&#x201D; (<foreign>anglice</foreign> the <hi rend="italic">Commitee</hi>) and &#x201C;what shall I say, strange things upon <hi rend="italic">my</hi> honour&#x201D;! You may be sure that old Pestrucci<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Filippo Pistrucci, director of the school.</note> would not let slip so fine an occasion of gratifying his melodramatic propensities and accordingly a series of <hi rend="italic">scenario</hi> were most unexpectedly introduced which the audience must have been charmed to find themselves &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">assisting</hi> at&#x201D;&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">for nothing</hi>&#x2014;I mean <foreign><hi rend="italic">gratis</hi></foreign>&#x2014; Of the first, poor unsuspecting, horror-struck Mazzini was made at once the hero and the victim!&#x2014; When all had spoken who were to speak, he came forward&#x2014;very shame-faced as you may fancy&#x2014;and &#x201C;unveiling himself as the original founder&#x201D; (in defiance to Baldacconi<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Rev. Dr. Baldacconi, of the Sardinian Chapel, Lincoln&#x2019;s Inn Fields, probably a political conservative, an opponent of the Free School, had attacked it from his pulpit in <date when="1842-04-00">April</date> and had been supported by Lucas&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">True Tablet,</hi> which accused one of the directors of heresy. The <hi rend="italic">Morning Chronicle</hi>, <date when="1842-05-18">18 May</date>, defended the school, which, according to Mazzini, had attracted pupils away from Baldacconi.</note> who had said he <hi rend="italic">dared</hi> not) he made a most moving address to the school as <hi rend="italic">learners</hi> and as <hi rend="italic">patriots</hi>&#x2014; When he had finished, amidst shouting like to bring down the ceiling there stepped forth <pb id="pg-15-188" n="15:188"/>from the pupils benches the <hi rend="italic">least</hi> boy&#x2014;some twelve years old&#x2014;who advanced blushing, and laid a bouquet at his feet! then putting his little hand in his breast, he pulled out a little paper, and proceeded to read a little sonnet to his (Mazzinis) honour and glory!&#x2014;just fancy this!&#x2014; and consider the sort of Man! and admire him that he did not turn round and brain old Pestrucci on the spot&#x2014;from whose goosehead of course this <foreign><hi rend="italic">coup de theatre</hi></foreign> must have emanated! Nor was this all the trials his modesty had to undergo&#x2014;an Italian girl next advanced from the pupils benches (there are nine female pupils&#x2014;some english, the wives of Italian operatives&#x2014;and some Italian) a very beautiful girl too,&#x2014;came forward in an <foreign><hi rend="italic">acc&#xE8;s</hi></foreign> [fit] of enthusiasm genuine&#x2014;for this part of the exhibition was <hi rend="italic">spontaneous</hi>&#x2014;and humbly besought him to give her one flower of his bouquet!! and an Englishwoman, who would not be behind the foreigner, called god to witness that he was the <hi rend="italic">Prophet</hi> of her time!! &#x201C;The moral satisfaction&#x201D; might well be &#x201C;complete&#x201D;&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">more</hi> than complete one would say!&#x2014; Nor had Pistucci<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> forgotten <hi rend="italic">himself</hi>&#x2014;when the company were about to disperse one of the pupils again stepped forth, and declared that it would make their enjoyment perfect if M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Pistrucci would favour them with an <hi rend="italic">improvisation</hi>&#x2014;&#x201C;Oh <foreign><hi rend="italic">Impossibile, impossibile</hi></foreign>!&#x201D; with all sorts of coyish grimacing&#x2014;at length he allowed himself to be so far prevailed upon that &#x201C;he would read them a composed poem of his own&#x201D;&#x2014;which he thereupon drew <hi rend="italic">all ready</hi> from his pocket&#x2014;and calling to him &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">the</hi> D<hi rend="italic">r Rossetti</hi>&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Gabriele Rossetti (<date when="1783-00-00">1783</date>&#x2013;<date when="1854-00-00">1854</date>), father of the Pre-Raphaelite Rossettis; see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370717-JWC-TC-01"><sic>9:250</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1837-07-17">17 July 1837</date></corr></ref>.</note> the two old fools proceeded to deliver in horrible <hi rend="italic">recitative</hi> a dramatized poem written for the occasion! What the &#x201C;wellwishing English&#x201D; thought of all this, I cannot pretend to say&#x2014;a good deal of inward laughter must I should think have transacted itself&#x2014;fortunately there were few english present&#x2014;of women only Elizabeth and M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Jameson, the one, half Italian by marriage, and the other, two-thirds so by nature&#x2014;</p>
<p>Did I tell you the Fate of Gambardellas picture of Carlyle?&#x2014;I think not&#x2014;at C&#x2019;s desire I stept in to see it one day in passing to the Sterlings&#x2014;Speridion (his other name is quite too long for writing) almost without opening his lips set it up before me&#x2014; He had put in a small triangular light just at the joining of the nose and brow which gave it the appearance of <hi rend="italic">smelling something</hi> to which <foreign><hi rend="italic">assafoetida</hi></foreign> was a joke, and another very broad, circular one in the middle of the under lip&#x2014;which I cannot describe unless you can fancy such an unheard of thing as a lip just <hi rend="italic">ignited</hi> by a <pb id="pg-15-189" n="15:189"/>lucifer-match!&#x2014; I looked at it for a moment with all the gravity I could muster, and then looked at the painter&#x2014; Our eyes met, and <hi rend="italic">both</hi> exploded into laughter&#x2014; &#x201C;The fact is&#x201D; said G. &#x201C;that poor man can <hi rend="italic">not</hi> sit! and will never get himself painted in this world&#x2014;unless from <hi rend="italic">memory</hi> by some one who has studied his face&#x201D; (in this last observation I believe there was a deal of sound sense)&#x2014; &#x201C;But we must not tell him so&#x201D;&#x2014;he continued&#x2014;&#x201C;it would vex him, and the poor man has done the best he could! just let it pass for <hi rend="italic">my</hi> want of talent, and I will do him a picture of <hi rend="italic">you</hi> to make up to him for his lost time!&#x201D; And then he made me sit down and read two letters from M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Reid<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Elizabeth Reid.</note> which I had heard of already from Carlyle, and which had &#x201C;excited him very much&#x201D;&#x2014;no wonder!&#x2014; The first was a honeyed production enough, setting forth the inducements of Tynemouth&#x2014;and beseeching him to come and paint her a picture of her &#x201C;dear and admirable friend Miss Martineau, who was just now looking unusually well&#x201D;&#x2014; She M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Reid would &#x201C;cheerfully bear his expences&#x2014;a steamer would bring him in two days &#x26;c&#x201D;&#x2014; The second letter was on receiving his charge  twenty pounds for the picture (not at all too much) and 6 pounds for expences&#x2014;three pounds <hi rend="italic">less</hi>&#x2014;observe&#x2014;than what it actually costs to go and come by railway&#x2014; A more coolly impertinent ungenerous, unladylike epistle than this of the &#x201C;amiable M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Reid&#x201D; I never in my life read&#x2014;it might well excite him&#x2014; She reproached him with having neglected her directions about the steamboat and thus added several pounds to her expence &#x201C;without one word of motive or apology&#x201D;&#x2014; If he must go by railroad at least he might have gone by the second class train!!!&#x2014; She feared such want of consideration would hinder his success among English people &#x201C;for whom nothing was more offensive than <hi rend="italic">a want of delicacy</hi> in money matters&#x201D;!&#x2014; I absolutely blushed for the woman in reading her vile letter, and felt heartily sorry for the poor fellow. Such language to a man who had dined at her table&#x2014;a gentleman by birth and breeding&#x2014; Shame on the old haddock!

<salute>My dear Emerson,</salute>
<p>Your Letter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1842-10-15">15 Oct.</date></note> finds me here today; busied with many things, but not likely to be soon more at leisure; wherefore I may as well give myself the pleasure of answering it on the spot. The Fraser Bill by Brown and Little has come all right; the Dumfries Banker apprises me lately that he has got the cash into his hands. Pray do not pester yourself with these Bookseller unintelligibilities: I suppose their accounts are all reasonably correct, the cheating, such as it is, done according to rule: what signifies it at any rate? I am no longer in any vital want of money; alas, the want that presses far heavier on me is a want of faculty, a want of <hi rend="italic">sense;</hi> and the feeling of that renders one comparatively very indifferent to money! I reflect many times that the wealth of the Indies, the fame of ten Shakespeares or ten Mahomets, would at bottom do me no good at all. Let us leave these poor slaves of the Ingot and slaves of the Lamp to their own courses,&#x2014;within a <hi rend="italic">certain</hi> extent of halter!</p>
<p>What you say of Alcott seems to me altogether just.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson had written: &#x201C;As for Alcott, you have discharged your conscience of him manfully &#x26; knightly: I absolve you well. But I am vexed that he should have been so mad about diet, &#x26; with you. It is a new thing with him, this eating better than his neighbors, &#x26; I could heartily wish he had &#x2026; not come to it &#x2026; before he saw you; for it has excluded his proper topics, and inflamed the man, who was gentle &#x26; intellectual, to be sore &#x26; tedious.&#x201D; He reported that Alcott had not enjoyed London. &#x201C;He is a great man &#x2026; but I now fear that he has already touched what best he can, &#x26; through his more than a prophet&#x2019;s egotism &#x2026; will bring nothing to pass. &#x2026; As you do not seem to have seen in him his pure &#x26; noble intellect, I fear that it lies under some new &#x26; denser clouds.&#x201D; The last sentence in Emerson&#x2019;s original draft says: &#x201C;But until I see him I have not settled whether it is he or you that is guilty of your failure to see his nobility&#x201D; (Slater, <hi rend="italic">CEC</hi> 331).</note> He is a man who has got into the highest intellectual region,&#x2014;if that be the Highest (tho&#x2019; in that too there are many states), wherein a man can believe and discern for himself, without need of help from any <pb id="pg-15-193" n="15:193"/>other, and even in opposition to all others: but I consider him entirely unlikely to accomplish anything considerable, except some kind of crabbed, semi-perverse, tho&#x2019; still manful existence of his own; which indeed is no despicable thing. His &#x201C;more than prophetic egoism&#x201D;&#x2014;alas, yes! It is of such material that Thebaid Eremites, Sect-founders, and all manner of crossgrained fanatical monstrosities have fashioned themselves,&#x2014;in very <hi rend="italic">high</hi>, and in the highest regions, for that matter. Sect-founders withal are a class I do not like. No truly great man, from Jesus Christ downwards, as I often say, ever founded a Sect,&#x2014;I mean wilfully intended founding one. What a view must a man have of this Universe, who thinks &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">he</hi> can swallow it all,&#x201D; who is not doubly and trebly happy that he can keep it from swallowing him! On the whole, I sometimes hope we have now done with Fanatics and Agonistic Posture-makers in this poor world: it will be an immense improvement on the Past; and the &#x201C;New Ideas,&#x201D; as Alcott calls them, will prosper greatly the better on that account! The old gloomy Gothic Cathedrals were good; but the great blue Dome that hangs over all is better than any Cologne one.&#x2014; On the whole, do not tell the good A<supplied>[l]</supplied>cott<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> a word of all this; but let him love me as he can, and live on vegetables in peace; as I, living <hi rend="italic">partly</hi> on vegetables, will continue to love him!</p>
<p>The best thing Alcot did when he staid among us was to circulate some copies of your <hi rend="italic">Man the Reformer</hi>. I did not get a copy; I applied for one, so soon as I knew the right fountain; but Alcott, I think, was already gone. And now mark,&#x2014;for this I think is a novelty, if you do not already know it: Certain Radicals have reprinted your Essay in Lancashire, and it is freely circulating there, and here, as a cheap pamphlet, with excellent acceptance so far as I discern. Various Newspaper reviews of it have come athwart me: all favourable, but all too shallow for sending to you. I myself consider it a <hi rend="italic">truly excellent</hi> utterance; one of the best words you have ever spoken. Speak many more such. And whosoever will distort them into any &#x201C;vegetable&#x201D; or other crotchet,&#x2014;let it be at his own peril; for the word itself is <hi rend="italic">true;</hi> and will have to make itself a <hi rend="italic">fact</hi> therefore; tho&#x2019; not a distracted <hi rend="italic">abortive</hi> fact, I hope! <hi rend="italic">Words</hi> of that kind are not born into Facts in <hi rend="italic">the seventh month;</hi> will if they see the light fullgrown (they and their adjuncts) in the <hi rend="italic">second century;</hi> for old Time is a most deliberate breeder!&#x2014; But to speak without figure, I have been very much delighted with the clearness, simplicity, quiet energy and veracity of this discourse; and also with the fact of its <pb id="pg-15-194" n="15:194"/>spontaneous appearance here among us. The prime mover of the Printing, I find, is one Thomas Ballantyne, editor of a Manchester Newspaper, a very good cheery little fellow, once a Paisley weaver, as he informs me,&#x2014;a great admirer of all worthy things.&#x2014; &#x2014; My paper is so fast failing, let me tell you of the Writer on Loyola. He is a James Stephen, Head Under-Secretary of the Colonial Office,&#x2014;that is to say, I believe, real governor of the British Colonies, so far as they have any governing. He is of Wilberforce&#x2019;s creed, of Wilberforce&#x2019;s kin;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Stephen (<date when="1789-00-00">1789</date>&#x2013;<date when="1859-00-00">1859</date>; <ref target="volume-15/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/26374"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), undersec. for the colonies; see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350800-JWC-JCA-01"><sic>8:196</sic><corr>JWC to JCA, <date when="1835-08-13">13 Aug. 1835</date></corr></ref>.

In fact I regard the man as standing on the confines of Genius and Dilettantism,&#x2014;a man of many really good qualities, and excellent at the despatch of business.

<p>My dear Sir&#x2014; &#x2026; Emerson&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Essay</hi> is capital; one of the best, or almost the very best, I have ever seen of his. I praise you greatly for getting it reprinted: everybody thinks it a favourable symptom of Lancashire Radicals that they have a sense for such ideas as these. A Letter came from Emerson along with yours; he is well, and contemplating some new Lectures, I think, for New York. I want to send him a copy of <hi rend="italic">Man the Reformer</hi> in the Bolton type; but have none left here, and know not at once where to find them in London. Can you clap a stamp on one, and despatch it hither? Or indeed why not off to Concord direct! His address is: &#x201C;R. Waldo Emerson, Esq., Concord, Massachusetts&#x201D;: you wrap the Essay up like a Newspaper, open at the ends; I think our Postmasters take it in that state for 8d. by <hi rend="italic">ship</hi>, for 12d. by <hi rend="italic">steamer;</hi> and it travels, so wrapt, for a cent or two in America. Emerson now knows your name.</p>
<p>I find it was Alcott who first set the Essay afloat here; by way of basis for some crotchets or headlong <hi rend="italic">Ultraism</hi> of his own, derived, and also <hi rend="italic">perverted</hi>, from Emerson&#x2019;s way of thought. I was amused with Alcott&#x2019;s criticism of me!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably in a newspaper, untraced.</note> He is a good man, but a bore of the first magnitude; a &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Potato Quixote</hi>,&#x201D; as some named him here. He came along in Autumn to reform all England, by reducing us first of all to live exclusively on vegetables: all England, of course, was deaf as Ailsa Craig;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A rocky island, 1,114 ft. high, off the SW coast of Scotland.</note> and Alcott is home in a Highland rage at their stupidity. Long may he abide, and happy may he be! &#x2026;</p>

<salute>Dear Mrs Welsh,</salute>
<p>Since writing to you, I have called on Mr Elliot; and spoken with him about New South Wales and your Son. I learn that Sir George Gipps,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >(<date when="1791-00-00">1791</date>&#x2013;<date when="1847-00-00">1847</date>; <ref target="volume-15/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/10766"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), gov. of New South Wales, <date when="1838-00-00">1838</date>&#x2013;<date when="1846-00-00">46</date>.</note> the Governor of New S. Wales, <hi rend="italic">has</hi> constantly in his employment, a Body of Surveyors and Engineers, having naturally much employment for them there. That he is a personal friend of Mr Elliot&#x2019;s, who knew him in Canada where they were together.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >T. F. Elliot had been sec. and Gipps commissioner of the commission of inquiry into the state of Canada, <date when="1835-00-00">1835</date>&#x2013;<date when="1837-00-00">37</date>.</note> That he is a brave man; decidedly eager to find and promote men of real talent; decidedly averse to have anything to do with mere blockheads and idle bunglers, by whatever interest supported,&#x2014;on which ground he has got the reputation of a &#x201C;hard man&#x201D; from certain parties; and, I hope, deserved it! Mr Elliot said, &#x201C;I cannot of course <hi rend="italic">promise</hi> that he will get the young man a situation; he must be the judge of that himself; but if he find him really able and worthy,&#x2014;I think I can assure you my Letter will be attended to.&#x201D; Nothing more could be said. In short, it appears to me, if your son were there on the ground with a good faculty in his head, he would stand a very fair chance of an appointment;&#x2014;and that <hi rend="italic">there</hi> only, in all the British Colonies, is there a good chance for him, so far as the Government appointments go. At the time of writing, I was not aware that the N. S. Wales Governor had himself Surveyors; and it seemed, as throwing a new light on the outlooks of the thing, worth writing of to you.</p>
<p>It seems you can by no method find access to any Practice of Surveying and Engineering. This is very grievous: if this is <hi rend="italic">irremediable</hi>,&#x2014;why, this too must be submitted to; but we ought to ascertain well first whether it <hi rend="italic">is</hi> wholly so or not. I should conceive that, by possibility or even likelihood, your son would find employment in N. S. Wales, even as he is, and gradually learn his business there,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; of <pb id="pg-15-197" n="15:197"/>course this would be a far inferior start for him. If he persist in the project, I advise that new efforts be made for a little practical apprenticeship.</p>
<p>Meanwhile we may remark, nothing is running away with him, or with his prospects; he seems very reasonably employed at present. Let him gather a few good Books on his Science and read them. Does he know French well? Does he know German?&#x2014; Professor Forbes,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James David Forbes (<date when="1809-00-00">1809</date>&#x2013;<date when="1868-00-00">68</date>; <ref target="volume-15/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/9832"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), prof. of natural philosophy, Univ. of Edinburgh since <date when="1833-00-00">1833</date>, who recommended John Welsh for his post at the observatory at Makerstoun.</note> one would hope, might be able to assist him in finding some Teaching Engineer,&#x2014;by and by.</p>
<p>As to Observatories I rather think they are few in number in these Islands of ours; the subaltern places in them very ill-paid, the chief places very difficult to get. I should say engineering in the Colonies was a much likelier life; more <hi rend="italic">fruitful</hi> in every way for a man of head and heart.</p>
<p>This is all I had to write at present; you need not trouble yourself with answering me,&#x2014;till some new fact rise, or you feel otherwise disposed to write.</p>
<p>I must again bid you be under no apprehension about this young Cousin of ours. I think, if he live, he will be a brave man yet, and his poverty will teach him many things, and be in all ways a disguised <hi rend="italic">blessing</hi> to him. Even so!&#x2014;</p>

<salute>Dear Sterling,</salute>
<p>In a Letter which arrived three days ago from Emerson,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1842-10-15">15 Oct.</date></note> there were, close under the seal, these words: &#x201C;Sterling&#x2019;s Papers,&#x2014;if he is near you,&#x2014;are all in Mr Russell&#x2019;s hands. I played my part of Fadladeen<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The &#x201C;Great Nazir or Chamberlain of the Harem&#x201D; in Moore&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Lalla Rookh,</hi> a boring and exacting critic of the tales told to the princess.</note> with great rigour, and put my results to Russell, but have not now written to J. S.&#x201D;&#x2014; These words, whatever they may mean, I have since undertaken to convey to you;&#x2014;and here you have them. The interpretation I suppose is that a Yankee Bookseller is about doing his duty to you; which I wish he would do, and let us see the result.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-15-198" n="15:198"/>Today your Letter came; and, <hi rend="italic">sticking to it by the wafer</hi>, another Letter from you to your Mother: both had been shoved thro&#x2019; our doorslit as one; and indeed I had torn up the cover of your Mother&#x2019;s, before they fell asunder,&#x2014;to my extreme amazement! It is a document as to the use of improved wafers. My Wife carried up your Mother&#x2019;s share of the affair;&#x2014;found her not worse, except from some rebellious tooth which is plaguing her a little. <hi rend="italic">She</hi> is instructed to send up Arnold&#x2019;s Lectures<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Arnold, <hi rend="italic">Introductory Lectures on Modern History</hi> (Oxford, <date when="1842-00-00">1842</date>).</note> tomorrow,&#x2014;I mean my wife is. I, as you, liked these Lectures considerably; an admirable calmness, cunning candour, adroitness to insinuate the <hi rend="italic">thin edge</hi> into unwedgeable and gnarled Oxford with its prejudices and platitudes. It was Arnold&#x2019;s <foreign>forte</foreign>. He seemed to me likely to be the far best Schoolmaster I had ever in my life seen. A brave man. But his Lectures are rather a game of battle than a battle: <hi rend="italic">Prolusions</hi> to a Waterloo!</p>
<p>You ask me to retract at least Shakespeare&#x2019;s conditional silence.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sterling&#x2019;s letters to TC for this period are not extant; perhaps he had been questioning TC&#x2019;s recommendation of silence on the grounds that Shakespeare at least was an exception, though unique.</note> It seems a small request! And yet when I think of Oliver Cromwell, the best King we ever had, escaping by the merest accident from dying as a grazier at Ely; and Martin Luther, by the like, from disappearing as a silent Dominican; and when I look at myself, and at other great <hi rend="italic">un-</hi>writing souls that I have known, and small unweariedly writing souls that I yet know,&#x2014;it becomes hard for me to retract! No, my friend, wherever I go or stand, I find the <hi rend="italic">inarticulate dust of Poets</hi> (of Makers, Inventors, great struggling souls, who never higgled for Copyright in the Row,&#x2014;and merely tended towards Heaven and God, and <hi rend="italic">from</hi> Hell and the Devils wards); and I say to myself, There have been millions of millions of Poets, and hundreds of them have been Shakspeares, perhaps thousands, or a higher ratio, since Adam first put on fig-breeches! That, in real sobriety, is my faith.&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; And truly the longer I live, I find there is no &#x201C;fame&#x201D; &#x26;c &#x26;c in this poor scrub of a world that could make a real piece of Manhood go far out of his road to gather it; I think, still, if he is a Reality, he runs and strives towards <hi rend="italic">God</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">from</hi> the Devil (if we will understand the words well), and not from or towards any kind of wages whatsoever that could be even promised him, much less made good to him, in these climates.</p>
<p>Return safe from Donnybrook<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Village nr. Dublin, famous for its fair and its jolly rioting.</note> with your head whole.&#x2014;</p>

<salute>My darling</salute>
<p>To account for certain phenomena in the paper-department that must have filled you with astonishment, I may as well mention while it is in my head, that we are making a course of paper-experiments at present, buying it in very small quantities from this and the other Stationer, to see if by Gods grace we cannot discover one man who sells &#x201C;genuine unadulterated&#x201D; paper of rags&#x2014;not &#x201C;an abominable compound of plaster-of-Paris!&#x201D;&#x2014; Oh that accursed reform Bill!&#x2014; Meanwhile every now and then I find myself without even plaster-of-Paris notepaper to wear the points of my pens upon and am reduced to tearing sheets out of&#x2014;the Butchers book!!</p>
<p>I should have had a hot pressed gilt edged sheet for the present writing&#x2014;to communicate such news as will cause you to dance for joy&#x2014; Only think Babbie&#x2014;by the time this reaches you Gambardella will be in the same town with you&#x2014;ready to paint my uncle at a moments warning!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >His portrait of John Welsh is reproduced in Huxley, <hi rend="italic">JWCLF</hi> opp. 100.</note> Now does there not seem to be the finger of Providence in this sudden resolution of his to start for Liverpool?&#x2014;just when I was pondering how I could put the thing into his head&#x2014;so as to <hi rend="italic">persuade him to go voluntarily</hi>&#x2014;as John does with M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Ogelvie&#x2014; I send the note that has just reached me from him&#x2014;whereby you will perceive once for all that he can not only write, but <hi rend="italic">spell</hi>&#x2014;better or worse&#x2014;well enough for all practical purposes&#x2014; I need not bid you give the poor fellow a warm welcome; you will remember our sails &#x26;c<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unexplained.</note> and do <hi rend="italic">that</hi> of your own accord&#x2014;nor do I fear his going to see you will embarrass you <hi rend="italic">anyhow</hi>&#x2014;for I am sure my Uncle will be greatly amused with him, and see the good that shines thro his manifold folly&#x2014; Now Babbie if you do not make something out of this best of all possible opportunities for getting my uncle painted, I shall make it a reproach to you as long as I live&#x2014; A man should not let his modesty (however praiseworthy modesty may be in the <hi rend="italic">Abstract</hi>) thwart the wishes of a whole virtuous family&#x2014;and me at the head of them!&#x2014;urge this on him my Uncle&#x2014;emphatically&#x2014;there is no surer way of succeeding with him than appealing to his sense of justice&#x2014;</p>
<p>I shall give G. an introduction to Geraldine and M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Paulet&#x2014; I know no one else in Liverpool that is not more your acquaintance than <pb id="pg-15-200" n="15:200"/>mine&#x2014;the Sketchly&#x2019;s?&#x2014;shall I introduce him to Miss Pen?<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A Mrs. Sketchley, of 32 Percy St. and her da. Penelope, a picture copier.</note> better not!&#x2014;he would kick too recklessly thro&#x2019; their cobwebs.&#x2014; Perhaps <hi rend="italic">you</hi> will introduce him to Walter<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably Macgregor.</note> as an <hi rend="italic">admirer</hi> of his aspiration <hi rend="italic">in shift</hi> and to M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Hick<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Grace Welsh.</note> as a fellow Artist! By the way do send me the said M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Hick&#x2014; The man who drew that sketch can be &#x201C;no fool&#x201D;&#x2014;and besides as he is shortly to be connected with the family, I may as well commence my relations with him betimes.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not further identified, but apparently an artist; his impending connection with the family is unexplained.</note></p>
<p>Now for a small <hi rend="small-caps">private</hi> perplexity&#x2014;immediately on receiving from you Miss Gillespie&#x2019;s address I wrote her a letter and sent it by post along with a remembrance of <hi rend="italic">her</hi> and a sovereign to buy some trifle as a present from myself. Knowing the good woman to be ill and poor&#x2014;I thought the gold sovereign would be more useful to her than any equivalent present I could buy here&#x2014;so I pleaded the difficulty of carriage as my excuse for sending so prosaical a gift, and managed it so as not I hope to hurt her feelings&#x2014; I begged her to write me a line immediately to say how she was and if my packet had reached her safe&#x2014;and altho it is now a fortnight since I have received no answer&#x2014;so that I have doubts whether the whole thing have not been kidnapped by the way&#x2014;which were twenty pities&#x2014;at the same time it seems so <hi rend="italic">little</hi> to be making any fuss about or writing again to ask after!&#x2014; Now I mention it to you because when you see M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Martin you could enquire when she heard from Moffat; and if Miss G have written to her recently she would perhaps say something of having had a letter from me&#x2014; You understand that I would not have a word said about the sovereign&#x2014; It is as well if it have gone astray that the amount was not greater as it would certainly have been, had not my <hi rend="italic">small</hi> private Capital been so <hi rend="italic">awfully</hi> broken in upon by that silk gown&#x2014;which by the way has not been once on since I came from Troston&#x2014; Give my most affectionate regards to M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Martin and Sophy&#x2014;poor little Sophy! she used to make <hi rend="italic">her</hi> caps I remember; and she always spoke of M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Martin with such kindness!&#x2014; Do not let them forget <hi rend="italic">me</hi>&#x2014; I would not be forgotten by anyone she<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Grace Welsh.</note> loved&#x2014;</p>
<p>I had a letter from Anne Welsh today&#x2014;enclosing a blockhead of a tract entitled &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Knowledge of Sin</hi>&#x201D; and a printed hymn about &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">The fullness of Jesus</hi>&#x201D;&#x2014; These things do not make me angry&#x2014;only horribly <hi rend="italic">sad</hi>&#x2014;to feel oneself and those one is bound to by natural affection separated so widely, widely even in the same world of the living&#x2014;is scarcely less melancholy than being parted from them by death&#x2014; A letter from <pb id="pg-15-201" n="15:201"/>M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> George Welsh, which crossed one from me about her son on the road, is much more comfortable&#x2014; She seems a good, sensible woman that&#x2014;a remarkable instance of <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> made into <hi rend="italic">something</hi> and a very self subsistent creditable <hi rend="italic">something</hi>, by the <hi rend="italic">educating</hi> process of misfortune&#x2014;</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Having only half a moment&#x2019;s time, I must be very brief;&#x2014;but can at least mention that we are all well still, and going on in the old method. My writing today has gone <hi rend="italic">awry,</hi> or I should not even have had this half-moment!</p>
<p>Last night Basil Montague sent me a foolish letter &#x2018;for an autograph&#x2019; for some fool. Basil himself is ill of Influenza, has not power in his own hand to write. Poor old Basil! I answered, in some way, a fool according to his folly.</p>
<p>Bunsen, with others under him, seems to have set on foot some &#x2018;universal Subscription&#x2019; for a due monument to the late Dr Arnold: to be a prize at Oxford, a marble sculpture,&#x2014;or whatever they<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> funds may turn out to cover.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >As TC explains, a committee had been set up (including Bunsen, Lord Stanley, J.

<p>&#x2014;Here has just come in a poor modest Cambridge youth, introduced to me by John Gordon from Edin<hi rend="italic">r;</hi> poor fellow,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note>&#x2014;&#x201C;just going off to Germany&#x201D; &#x26;c: I have sent him on his way, but only half-minute of time, and my ideas too are all gone!</p>

<p>Who the George Johnstone you had found near Gloucester could be? That was my first agonizing inquiry. For the Liverpool George Johnstone was diligently practising medicine about the foot of Brownlow Hill when I last heard of him. But the tenor of your description leaves no doubt that this is actually he;&#x2014;and very curious it is! George has always something of a crick in the head of him; and had here ventured on a very questionable experiment. Poor fellow, I suppose he remembered the happy sunny days at Axletreewell, when the sky and Earth were all cheerful without and young truant or schoolboy heart was all cheerful within; and it had always hung in his mind <pb id="pg-15-203" n="15:203"/>that Farming was of all things the best! But he has a spice of real honest sense in him, a tenacity as of <foreign>withes</foreign>, above all; and will not founder in the &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Glarry</hi></foreign> [Muddy] <hi rend="italic">Road</hi>&#x201D; there. I am very glad to hear of a Prattler, which will be a considerable resource for them; right glad too to hear of old Mrs Johnstone, and noble filial piety still at work. Pray do go back again if it be within reach; and say all manner of kind things on my part to the good George and his good Mother.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. George Johnston, brother of TC&#x2019;s friend James Johnston (see <ref target="volume-01/lt-18130624-TC-TM-01"><sic>1:4</sic><corr>TC to TM, <date when="1813-06-24">24 June 1813</date></corr></ref>), graduated M.D., <date when="1822-00-00">1822</date>, practised in Marsden, Cheshire, and in Liverpool, <date when="1831-00-00">1831</date>, until some time after <date when="1838-00-00">1838</date> when TC last mentioned seeing him (<ref target="volume-10/lt-18381015-TC-AC-01"><sic>10:200</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1838-10-15">15 Oct. 1838</date></corr></ref>).

<p>My writing goes on so so, but does go on.

By the way you may feel sure he would be pleased by your mention of him in front of your little book. He has more of something like happiness in him than for many years.

<p><salute>There <hi rend="italic">is</hi> some paper in the house today&#x2014;</salute>but I absolutely <hi rend="italic">dare</hi> not go in for it&#x2014;so let us be thankful for the unfailing tho&#x2019; rather prosaical resource of the Butchers book! My Darling Babbie: the &#x201C;moral satisfaction&#x201D; I have in you is great! almost my only &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">unmitigated</hi> satisfaction&#x201D; (as Sir R Peel would say)&#x2014;in the present existing state of my affairs&#x2014; &#x201C;The <hi rend="italic">trail of the Serpent</hi>&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Moore, &#x201C;Paradise and the Peri,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Lalla Rookh</hi> (<date when="1817-00-00">1817</date>) 144.</note> is over all else that pretends to give me comfort or pleasure!&#x2014;My Aunt Anne writes to me,&#x2014;as if it were great <hi rend="italic">news</hi>&#x2014;that &#x201C;happiness is not to be found in this world! it was not Gods purpose with us in sending us into it&#x201D;! &#x201C;good gracious!&#x201D; have not I known that much for upwards of a quarter of <pb id="pg-15-205" n="15:205"/>a century and put it into a formula too for my own behoof; before <hi rend="italic">she,</hi>&#x2014;wise woman as she now thinks herself,&#x2014;had discovered that &#x201C;Gods purpose in sending us into <hi rend="italic">it</hi>&#x201D; was <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to run after &#x201C;the <hi rend="italic">fashion</hi>,&#x201D; a seeking of <hi rend="italic">happiness</hi> in the very lowest walk where it could be imagined findable&#x2014; It is not <hi rend="italic">happiness</hi> which I ask of Heaven, however much I might <hi rend="italic">like</hi> to have it (in conjunction, I believe with all my fellow-mortals, even the most philosophical&#x2014;if they would but speak without cant) <hi rend="small-caps">that</hi> I agree to the impossibleness of, and should be a fool therefore if I did not leave it out of my prayers&#x2014;but what I <hi rend="italic">do</hi> ask of Heaven, and with ever increasing earnestness, and ever increasing protest against the &#x201C;lions in the way&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Prov. 26:13.</note> is <hi rend="italic">calm</hi>&#x2014;let me be sad as death if God wills it so&#x2014;but let me be left in peace with my sadness!&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">that</hi> it seems to me one has a right to demand of one&#x2019;s fellow creatures&#x2014;especially of those who profess to have our wellbeing at heart, and the unnecessary griefs which <hi rend="italic">they</hi> cause us look to me not so much of God&#x2019;s sending as of the Devils! Oh but I am wrong in taking this view of the matter,&#x2014;these every-day highly superfluous worries and tribulations are a part of our allotted trials, as well as the inevitable irremediable bereavements and afflictions&#x2014;granted they <hi rend="italic">are</hi> a part&#x2014;but a part to be struggled against&#x2014;protested against&#x2014;only <hi rend="italic">submitted</hi> to because one cannot help oneself&#x2014;
Why otherwise should God have planted in our hearts a sense of <hi rend="italic">justice</hi> and of self-<hi rend="italic">preservation?</hi> Meanwhile I have swallowed a Sedliz<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC&#x2019;s spelling of &#x201C;Seidlitz.&#x201D;</note> powder which as yet has had no beneficial results&#x2014; A vision of a teacupful of soup crossed my mind&#x2014;but Helen was ironing and I would not trouble her to make it for me&#x2014; Helen however seeing me look ill, of her own accord <hi rend="italic">broiled</hi> and brought up (with a little air of self-complacency which it would have been a thousand pities to dash) a morsel of mutton! as opposite a thing to the tendencies of my &#x201C;interior&#x201D; at the moment, as could have been hit upon by the wit of cooks! however like a simpleton I eat it to please her and now I am wishing &#x201C;the devil had flown away with it&#x201D;&#x2014;I am not <hi rend="italic">well</hi> certainly, but so long as I <hi rend="italic">keep on my legs,</hi> and have nothing that needs to be <hi rend="italic">taken care of</hi> I should be thankful&#x2014; I have no cough only a perpetual dull headach of now a fortnights standing&#x2014;very bad in the mornings and evenings and less so during the middle of the day&#x2014; It seems to make no difference in it what I do or abstain from doing&#x2014;it would be worse for me if it hindered me from writing&#x2014; Fontenelle, I think it was, who observed in speaking of Hell that &#x201C;he <pb id="pg-15-206" n="15:206"/><hi rend="italic">flattered himself</hi> one would get <hi rend="italic">used</hi> to it&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Bernard Le Bovier, Sieur de Fontenelle (<date when="1657-00-00">1657</date>&#x2013;<date when="1757-00-00">1757</date>), French misc. writer; quotation untraced.</note>&#x2014;it rather makes against this theory of the force of custom, that I still make such an outcry about headach, for certainly I have had opportunity enough to &#x201C;get used to it&#x201D;&#x2014; For the rest the weather has been more adapted for Ducks, or the Witches of Macbeth than for a delicate female like me&#x2014; I went out a little yesterday however between two showers&#x2014;and made excellent use of my time&#x2014; I was not absent an hour and a half in all and in that brief space I executed a scold on M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Boulter&#x2014;shopped to the amount of Sixpence&#x2014;made three new acquaintances and did three good actions! I should have returned then with a comfortable sensation of <hi rend="italic">virtue</hi> you will say&#x2014; Alas no I returned cold and wearied, and forlorn&#x2014; On the whole the pleasures of <hi rend="italic">benevolence</hi> between ourselves, are not a whit less visionary than other sublunary pleasures&#x2014;at least I find them so&#x2014;
There <hi rend="italic">is</hi> a moment of moral satisfaction in putting a starved old woman into a warm flannel petticoat but one reflects the next instant&#x2014; &#x201C;of course she will pawn it&#x201D;&#x2014;and so on of every thing else of the sort one attempts in the way of <hi rend="italic">charity</hi>&#x2014; That you may not be forming too magnificent an idea of my &#x201C;good actions&#x201D; of yesterday I must tell you, that the<supplied>[y]</supplied><note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> cost me <hi rend="italic">in all</hi> only half a crown, and wet feet. Some nights ago Carlyle in one of his dark walks along the Kings road<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Leading from Sloane Sq. and forming, roughly, the N part of Chelsea.</note> observed a &#x201C;remarkably decent even <hi rend="italic">dignified</hi> looking woman&#x201D; sitting on some steps with a baby in her arms&#x2014;&#x201C;if he saw her again he would give her a penny&#x201D;&#x2014;he did see her again the following night and gave her not only a penny but three half<supplied>[p]</supplied>ence<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note>&#x2014; The next night also she was &#x201C;still there with the same <hi rend="italic">sad, calm,</hi> look&#x201D; He addressed her and found her pretty deaf&#x2014;she professed to be a soldier&#x2019;s widow&#x2014;that night he &#x201C;had not a penny&#x201D; so he told her to come down to me and I would give her some old clothes&#x2014; I am sure he thinks I can <hi rend="italic">invent</hi> old clothes&#x2014;for it was only a few days before I had given all the duds I had to the widow of that pale faced street-sweeper in the Kings road now relieved from street sweeping for ever more&#x2014; The woman arrived next morning at ten oclock&#x2014;strongly perfumed with gin!&#x2014;a decent looking woman nevertheless&#x2014;and if a poor wretch have no fire&#x2014;no warm breakfast&#x2014;and for three farthings can get gin enough to both <hi rend="italic">warm</hi> and <hi rend="italic">strengthen</hi> her, who shall say that her taking it is a <hi rend="italic">fatal</hi> sign of her&#x2014;not I!&#x2014;so in spite of the <hi rend="italic">questionable</hi> smell I entered <pb id="pg-15-207" n="15:207"/>on a searching examination of her claims to my assistance. She told me she was the daughter of a Hotel keeper in Dublin, had eloped from a boarding school with her soldier husband at fourteen&#x2014;had never since been taken the smallest notice of by any of her relatives&#x2014;her Parents had died&#x2014;her husband had died and here she was a beggar&#x2014;with three children&#x2014;a boy of twelve who had been taken into the Chelsea <hi rend="italic">Institution</hi><note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Royal Military Asylum, also known as the Duke of York&#x2019;s School, established for maintaining and educating soldiers&#x2019; children.</note> for soldiers orphans&#x2014;a girl of six and the baby at her heart&#x2014; She &#x201C;never went to see her son&#x2014;for fear of disgracing him among his companions&#x2014;he did not know what was become of her&#x2014;but she lived here for the sake of knowing herself near him&#x201D;&#x2014; All very touching&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">if true</hi>&#x2014; &#x201C;She could <hi rend="italic">sew</hi> perfectly well could do any work she was put to&#x2014;but none was to be had&#x201D;&#x2014; I <hi rend="italic">did invent</hi> some clothes for her&#x2014;among the rest a most <hi rend="italic">massive</hi> petticoat out of the old floor-cloth!!&#x2014;gave her a shilling and promised to enquire about her at the address she gave me&#x2014; And accordingly, yesterday, I set forth on that errand&#x2014;when it occurred to me that the truth of her story was to be got better from her son (if she had one) at the Institution than at her lodgings where they tell lies for one another.&#x2014;
I addressed myself to the bookkeeper who discovered in his Ledgers the name&#x2014;John Wood&#x2014;and took the trouble to bring the boy for me into his private room&#x2014;a dear little fellow full of spirit and intelligence&#x2014;but the terrified expression of whose face at being brought in to me gave me a mournful idea of his young experiences of his fellow creatures&#x2014; He looked as if he thought I <hi rend="italic">must</hi> be come to tell him his Mother was hanged&#x2014; His answers to all my enquiries were clear as spring-water&#x2014;he had seen his Mother three weeks ago! she lived in Union Street! his Father died six years ago! there was no baby! (a borrowed baby!) his Mothers Mother was alive! he had an uncle in Smithfield!<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In E London, till <date when="1855-00-00">1855</date> the chief horse and cattle market.</note>&#x2014;in short on a basis of truth I had been amused with a whole superstructure of lies&#x2014;and the woman was just an inveterate, never-do-well!&#x2014; I patted his head, gave him a shilling for his fright&#x2014;and inwardly resolved to take some further charge of the son since nothing could be done for the mother&#x2014; And there you see how imprudent it is to enter on a long story!&#x2014;with limited time and limited paper&#x2014;such histories are only for being <hi rend="italic">chattered</hi> by the fireside  So I spare you my other <hi rend="italic">good actions</hi> hoping that I may do some more another day&#x2014; No&#x2014;the <hi rend="italic">last</hi> is soon told and you may like to hear it&#x2014;it was calling on little Miss Adam Hunter at her boarding-school, which after having been vainly inquired <pb id="pg-15-208" n="15:208"/>about, at Knightsbridge and Kennsington, turns out to be five minutes walk from my own door! exactly over against Newman&#x2019;s the Dyer&#x2019;s!<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably John Newman, 1 Strongs Place, Brompton; the school is unidentified. Miss Hunter was the da. of JWC&#x2019;s cousin, Dr. Adam Hunter of Leeds.</note> That little Miss Adam is a cousin nobody need be ashamed of&#x2014;a remarkably pretty, graceful, intelligent child, with a strange dash of <hi rend="italic">the old Adam</hi> in it&#x2014;a sort of old-fashionedness&#x2014;not displeasing in a child however, but on the contrary rather &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">insinuating</hi>&#x201D;&#x2014; When she came into the room to me instead of <hi rend="italic">leaving me</hi> to <hi rend="italic">do</hi> the cousinly to <hi rend="italic">her</hi> she tripped up holding out both hands and exclaiming with a tone half of &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">reception</hi>&#x201D; half of childish gladness&#x2014;&#x201C;Oh thank you <hi rend="italic">thank</hi> you M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle for coming to see me!&#x201D; The Mistress came by and by and rather checked her <hi rend="italic">expansiveness</hi>&#x2014;we were getting on finely!&#x2014; I must write to the Father to send his orders to the Mistress that she is to be allowed to visit me when I ask her&#x2014;the cross looking spinster seemed quite disinclined to much intimacy&#x2014;the old fool! as if the child would not learn far more from me than from <hi rend="italic">her!</hi> But perhaps that was the very reason&#x2014;</p>
<p>I hope <hi rend="italic">the picture</hi> will be speedily set agoing before Gambardella gets his head turned and raises his prices to a hundred guineas!

<salute>Dear Jamie,</salute>
<p>I had your Letter a while ago, and meant to answer it; but my hurry in these days is always great; nor do I ever find myself at the writing-desk with a minute that can be spared from the unfortunate&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">Manuscript</hi> <pb id="pg-15-211" n="15:211"/>that is slowly struggling on! You must take a few words from me today; till I have leisure for more, when you write again.</p>
<p>Our good things in the Barrel ought to have been more particularly recognised. The meal is unsurpassable; has brought us back again to porridge suppers almost nightly. The Butter also is of the old excellence: I think there had been some forgetting of a cloth or the like to tie over the head of it,&#x2014;for we found only in the neighbourhood of the pot certain cabbage leaves all shrunk, and a thin plate of <hi rend="italic">meal</hi> coating the top of the butter: however, this too was well; Jane scraped off the meal-coat, <hi rend="italic">baked</hi> it into a cake of oat <hi rend="italic">shortbread,</hi> and the next stratum of butter was all fresh and fair!&#x2014; I have had out Isabella&#x2019;s Plaid, as far as Hyde Park Corner; a most warm article: Jane now threatens to have it back again as the warmer! I hope I shall not forget to tell my Mother too that the Stockings are about the best I ever had. Alick&#x2019;s tobacco likewise is excellent, always the better! I wish I had a shop with the like <hi rend="italic">here</hi>.&#x2014; So on that side all, you see, is <hi rend="italic">right</hi> every way.</p>
<p>I am very glad indeed to learn that you have for once had a reasonable crop and good season in Scotsbrig: I think, in spite of the low prices it will be a better one with you than the past have been. The time is fearful in all parts of this country. No improvement in trade is yet visible, tho&#x2019; some hope this grand Chinese Pacification<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Treaty of Nanking, signed <date when="1842-08-00">late Aug.</date>, ending the Opium War, <date when="1839-00-00">1839</date>&#x2013;<date when="1842-00-00">42</date>, opened four ports in addition to Canton to British trade, and ceded Hong Kong outright. The <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> announced it, <date when="1842-11-21">21 Nov.</date>, and welcomed it, <date when="1842-11-23">23 Nov.</date>, as &#x201C;the equivalent of the opening of commercial relations with four rich states.&#x201D;</note> may do more or less. For my share I expect no steady improvement, till Corn-Laws and many other &#x2018;Laws&#x2019; go to the place they belong to!
It is surmised by many that Peel will have to make some new change in his Law of <hi rend="italic">Sliding,</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sliding scale of duties on imported grain.</note> this very year. Whatever he may do, it seems very certain the Corn-Laws have not now long to last. The Cattle-farmers are all in the greatest rage; the prices of Cattle are <hi rend="italic">not</hi> likely to rise!&#x2014; Nay the very Landlords, in some quarters, talk of bringing down their <hi rend="italic">rent</hi>. That is the true way to &#x201C;slide&#x201D;; thither will they have to come, and much farther that they yet dream not of,&#x2014;whether &#x201C;sliding,&#x201D; or by still more abrupt methods, like furniture &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">flung</hi> out of window,&#x201D; they themselves can partly choose!&#x2014; &#x2014; Well; the remedy for all this, of so many fools and foolish miserable things is that each one of us struggle with his whole soul to grow <hi rend="italic">wiser</hi>. There is absolutely no other course for us. As Wull Vary<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably the farmer mentioned <ref target="volume-03/lt-18251215-TC-JAC-01"><sic>3:435</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1825-12-15">15 Dec. 1825</date></corr></ref>.</note> said or sang: &#x201C;It will be better for <hi rend="italic">thysel</hi>.&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>
<p><pb id="pg-15-212" n="15:212"/>I have a word for my Mother; and a Letter which will give you John&#x2019;s news. We are very sorry to hear of poor Isabella&#x2019;s weakly condition; but anticipate an improvement by and <supplied>[by]</supplied>.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> Jane sends you and her and the whole household affectionate regards. Write to me again, in the same firm Annandale style, with news or whatever else, and I will answer.</p>

As you say, may God teach <hi rend="italic">us</hi> to be also ready; for the hour and the Eternity awaits us all!</p>
<p>I sent your Letter on to the Doctor; it will remind him to write to you, if he can. Here is his last note to me, which will give you his news,&#x2014;and a view also of George Johnstone whom I had fancied still a Doctor at Liverpool not a Farmer in Gloucestershire! He married a Wife with property some years ago, and now it seems has retired to his own grounds.&#x2014; John, I suppose, would not like that any of these details should be spoken about; tho&#x2019; indeed there is nothing of an unfavourable sort there.</p>
<p>As to Jack himself, it would appear by this Note he is likely to come &#x201C;some Wednesday&#x201D;; and may perhaps <hi rend="italic">this</hi> very day be packing up, and setting forth! If so, you shall hear of it directly. But if you hear <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi>, consider it <hi rend="italic">not</hi> so;&#x2014;which, after all is the likeliest, for they are very <hi rend="italic">slow</hi> in forming their resolution,&#x2014;&#x201C;stiff t&#x2019;ye reise, Sandy!&#x201D;</p>

I send you my heart&#x2019;s blessing, to you and all; and so <foreign>adieu</foreign> for this day.

<p>So the picture is done, and successful&#x2014;my good <hi rend="italic">patient</hi> Uncle, give him twenty kisses for his compliance&#x2014;but Babbie!&#x2014;you say you wish that I could see it&#x2014;and you wish that I could see it!&#x2014;am I <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to see it then and that speedily?&#x2014;is not the picture for <hi rend="italic">me?</hi>&#x2014;it certainly was meant so in the beginning&#x2014;you asked my Uncle to send me his double and he answered &#x201C;why not one of myself&#x201D;? but now that it is satisfactorily done, you little avaricious gipsey, perhaps you think to appropriate it! as if I would have so far belied my nature as to take up the question merely as one of public good, and not of my own individual interest&#x2014;impossible!</p>
<p>Common honesty common sense direct that the picture should be hung up in this house rather than yours&#x2014; I am willing to regard it as a family possession only; <hi rend="italic">I must have the keeping of it</hi>&#x2014;you <hi rend="italic">understand?</hi></p>
<p>Miss Macready was here all wednesday&#x2014;and the novelty of having to <hi rend="italic">speak</hi> so many hours together quite knocked me up&#x2014; Susan Aitkinson<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Susan Atkins, Catherine Macready&#x2019;s sister.</note> she told me was still at Brighton in a very deplorable way&#x2014;going to tatters from <hi rend="italic">sheer</hi> <foreign><hi rend="italic">ennui!</hi></foreign>&#x2014;keep her amused, and she appears to have no ailment whatever but instantly that the &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">excitement</hi>&#x201D; is withdrawn, down she plumps into headach nausea and loss of appetite&#x2014; Here is virtue&#x2019;s reward as usual&#x2014;if &#x201C;William&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Macready.</note> instead of taking her into his house and making a handsome settlement on her, had left her to earn her own bread by employing her many accomplishments, She would not have thus come to be a burden on them and herself with her ailments of idleness&#x2014;</p>
<p>The potatoes arrived two days ago but I will not pronounce <pb id="pg-15-216" n="15:216"/>on them yet&#x2014;a most astounding quantity!

<salute><hi rend="small-caps">Dear Tennyson</hi>,</salute>
<p>Wherever this find you, may it find you well, may it come as a friendly greeting to you. I have just been reading your Poems;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi>, 2 vols. (<date when="1842-00-00">1842</date>).</note> I have read certain of them over again, and mean to read them over and over till they become my poems: this fact, with the inferences that lie in it, is of such emphasis in <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, I cannot keep it to myself, but must needs acquaint you too with it. If you knew what my relation has been to the thing call&#x2019;d English &#x201C;Poetry&#x201D; for many years back, you would think such fact almost surprising! Truly it is long since in any English Book, Poetry or Prose, I have felt the pulse of a real man&#x2019;s heart as I do in this same. A right valiant, true fighting, victorious heart; strong as a lion&#x2019;s, yet gentle, loving and full of music: what I call a genuine singer&#x2019;s heart! there are tones as of the nightingale; low murmurs as of wood-doves at summer noon; everywhere a noble sound as of the free winds and leafy woods. The sunniest glow of Life dwells in that soul, chequered duly with dark streaks from night and Hades: everywhere one feels as if all were fill&#x2019;d with yellow glowing sunlight, some glorious golden Vapour; from which form after form bodies itself; naturally, <hi rend="italic">golden</hi> forms. In one word, there seems to be a note of &#x201C;The Eternal Melodies&#x201D; in this man; for which let all other men be thankful and joyful! <pb id="pg-15-217" n="15:217"/>Your &#x201C;Dora&#x201D; reminds me of the <hi rend="italic">Book of Ruth;</hi> in the &#x201C;Two Voices,&#x201D; which I am told some Reviewer calls &#x201C;trivial morality,&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Said of &#x201C;The Palace of Art.&#x201D; John Sterling, anonymously reviewing in the <hi rend="italic">Quarterly Review,</hi> 75 (<date when="1842-09-00">Sept. 1842</date>):385&#x2013;416, found &#x201C;considerable affectation&#x201D; in &#x201C;The Palace of Art,&#x201D; and &#x201C;what is worse, the meaning, the <hi rend="italic">Morality,</hi> is trivial, and even mistaken&#x201D; (405). &#x201C;The Two Voices&#x201D; is dismissed later in the same para.</note> I think of passages in <hi rend="italic">Job</hi>. For truth is quite <hi rend="italic">true</hi> in Job&#x2019;s time and Ruth&#x2019;s as now. I know you cannot read German: the more interesting is it to trace in your &#x201C;Summer Oak&#x201D; a beautiful kindred to something that is best in Goethe; I mean his &#x201C;M&#xfc;llerinn&#x201D; (Miller&#x2019;s daughter) chiefly, with whom the very Mill-dam gets in love; tho&#x2019; she proves a flirt after all and the thing ends in satirical lines!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hallam Tennyson reports that Tennyson asked his sister Emily to copy TC&#x2019;s letter and send it to Emily Sellwood, whom Tennyson was to marry in <date when="1850-00-00">1850</date>. In a note with the letter Emily Tennyson wrote: &#x201C;I asked Alfred what Carlyle meant by saying he could not read German, and he said, when the poems he (i.e. Carlyle) alluded to were written he knew little or nothing of German. He must have told Carlyle this who has made a jumble. Moreover Alfred says, &#x2018;Carlyle is mistaken about the satirical lines, concluding the &#x201C;M&#xfc;llerinn.&#x201D; They are in another poem&#x2019;&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Memoir</hi> 1:214).</note> very strangely too in the &#x201C;Vision of Sin&#x201D; I am reminded of my friend Jean Paul. This is not babble, it is speech; true deposition of a volunteer witness. And so I say let us all rejoice somewhat. And so let us all smite rhythmically, all in concert, &#x201C;the sounding furrows&#x201D;; and sail forward with new cheer, &#x201C;beyond the sunset,&#x201D; whither we are bound &#x2014;</p>
<lg><l>It may be that the gulfs will wash us down,</l>
<l>It may be we shall touch the happy Isles</l>
<l>And see the great Achilles whom we knew!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Ulysses&#x201D; 58&#x2013;64, in the <hi rend="italic">Poems</hi>.</note></l></lg>
<p>These lines do not make me weep, but there is in me what would fill a whole Lachrymatories as I read. But do you, when you return to London, come down to me and let us smoke a pipe together. With few words, with many, or with none, it need not be an ineloquent Pipe!</p>
<p>Farewell, dear Tennyson; may the gods be good to you. With very great sincerity (and in great haste) I subscribe myself</p>

<salute>Dearest Babbie</salute>
<p>If I had not heard from you yesterday I think I should have cried! I was never more in need of some cheering in all my life&#x2014; There was a fog of three days standing to begin with&#x2014;and only those who have tried it (you I think never did) can conceive the depressing influence of a London fog&#x2014;then I suppose the confinement (for I have not been out above two or three times within the last four weeks) was beginning to tell upon me&#x2014; I had seen nobody all the foggy days except Mazzini&#x2014;more sad than usual &#x201C;upon <hi rend="italic">my</hi> honour&#x201D;&#x2014;and leaving <hi rend="italic">me</hi> also sadder than he found me&#x2014; From all these and other causes needless to specify, in addition to an unusual degree of bodily sickness; I really knew not what to do with my life!&#x2014; So that your letter which relieved me from all consideration about it for a few minutes, and set me as it were into the midst of <hi rend="italic">yours,</hi> was a sort of little <hi rend="italic">dram</hi> that I absolutely needed&#x2014; I had another little dram during the night but that was of plain brandy&#x2014; When C. was going up to his bed about one o&#x2019;clock I called to him to bring me a little&#x2014;on the strength of his repeated assurances that brandy taken during the night-season is &#x201C;the most quietening thing in the whole pharmacopeia&#x201D;&#x2014;
All day I had been finding it the greatest possible hardship to have to sit upright and keep my eyes open&#x2014;but I had no sooner lain down in bed to sleep than it became an equal hardship for me to have to <hi rend="italic">shut</hi> my eyes, and hinder myself from rushing along (morally speaking) not so much like a railway-<hi rend="italic">passenger</hi> as like a railway-<hi rend="italic">boiler</hi> on. on to the end of the world&#x2014; I did not take brandy <hi rend="italic">enough</hi> he said (I had half a wine glassful) and therefore it was that the panacea utterly failed&#x2014;to be sure it had considerable odds against it&#x2014;for besides my own restlessness it was put on me to &#x201C;assist&#x201D; at a ball!&#x2014;for which however no clothes were needed, so far as myself was concerned, beyond my usual nightshift and nightcap&#x2014; M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Thompson<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Neighbor; otherwise unidentified.</note> was entertaining a party of fifty&#x2014;who thumped and bumped about like wild, till half after four in the morning&#x2014;half after five I finally went to sleep and woke in half an hour again&#x2014; So if this letter be of the sort which the Annandale people call <foreign><hi rend="italic">blash</hi></foreign> [watery], you will understand to make due allowances&#x2014; For the rest; nothing is more plain than that I should <pb id="pg-15-219" n="15:219"/>try all lawful means to get myself into a little better bodily health and that if there is so much as the ninth part of a chance that a Doctor could do me any good, I should apply to a Doctor&#x2014; John is to return in a few days but <hi rend="italic">he</hi> has no healing in him&#x2014;at least for those who do not give him fees&#x2014; As one of my chinese verses says &#x201C;Alas that he should abandon what sense he had and place himself in the situation of a wooden puppet&#x201D;!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Untraced.</note> accordingly tho Carlyle tells me he has written to him <hi rend="italic">seriously</hi> about this pain in my side which has been plaguing me very much all the last week. I expect nothing more from him than that he will ask me three or four times over; &#x201C;how long have you had it?&#x201D; and a similar number of times&#x2014;&#x201C;where is it <hi rend="italic">at all?</hi>&#x201D; Better I thought to go at once to Sir James Clark&#x2014;only he is so apt to order people abroad&#x2014;&#x201C;well and tho&#x2019; he should, said Darwin it does not follow that you should go&#x201D;&#x2014;to be sure not! that had never occurred to me&#x2014;but last night C. told me that he had met Morah<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Morrah, 62 Sloane St., consulted in <date when="1837-00-00">1837</date>; see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370327-TC-MAC-01"><sic>9:178</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1837-03-27">27 March 1837</date></corr></ref>.</note> my own old Doctor and told <hi rend="italic">him</hi> to come and investigate me the first time he was in this region&#x2014;possibly he may come today&#x2014;</p>
<p>I had a long letter from Geraldine the other night&#x2014;in which she treats the question of Gambardella as if I had sent him to her on purpose that she should fall in love with him, and either marry him, or make with him what she calls &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">a modified arrangement</hi>&#x201D;&#x2014; &#x201C;If she lived long beside him she could grow to love him <hi rend="italic">very sisterly</hi> but <hi rend="italic">not otherwise</hi>&#x201D; &#x201C;he is too <hi rend="italic">overproof</hi>&#x2014;wants <hi rend="italic">body</hi>&#x2014;is in fact <hi rend="italic">too good</hi> and that sort of people she cannot love with passion&#x201D;&#x2014; What is all this? who wanted her to love him <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;with passion&#x201D;?</hi>&#x2014;not I sure enough&#x2014; The less <hi rend="italic">passion</hi> in the world the more <hi rend="italic">virtue</hi> and <hi rend="italic">good digestion!</hi>&#x2014; I would have nobody <hi rend="italic">cultivate</hi> passion &#x201C;for its own reward&#x201D; for <hi rend="italic">that</hi> is even a degree more unsatisfactory than virtues&#x2014; It is bad enough to love <hi rend="italic">with passion</hi> when one cannot help oneself&#x2014;but to set about it, <foreign>malice prepense</foreign>, as a piece of the natural business of life, whenever a <hi rend="italic">man</hi> presents himself&#x2014;and without the slightest inspection of the probabilities of being loved in return&#x2014;that does seem to me an exuberance of &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">the social feeling</hi>&#x201D; which ought to be kept down by <hi rend="italic">cold pudding</hi> or anything however disagreeable that is found to answer the purpose&#x2014;all this <foreign><hi rend="italic">entre nous</hi></foreign> [between us]&#x2014; Geraldine is a fine Spirit in spite of all her vagaries&#x2014;and she is mighty fond of you now as well as of me. &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Jeannie</hi>,&#x201D; she says, &#x201C;is really a charming creature and has taken root here very nicely&#x201D;&#x2014;and &#x201C;the other sister&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Helen.</note> comes in for a share of her praise&#x2014;by the way will <pb id="pg-15-220" n="15:220"/>you tell <hi rend="italic">the other sister</hi> to write to me: I want to hear from her own self <hi rend="italic">her</hi> impressions of this <hi rend="italic">Feast of pikes</hi>&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-15/lt-18421203-JWC-JW-01">JWC to JW, [ca. <date when="1842-12-03">3 Dec.</date>]</ref>.</note>&#x2014; Except for the continual recurrence of the monosyllable &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">we</hi>&#x201D; in your letters I am very much left in the dark respecting &#x201C;the graceful Miss Welsh&#x201D; as Gambardella called her in his letter to me&#x2014; Geraldine says of you further (and I doubt not but that was meant for the crowning praise) that &#x201C;you have got <hi rend="italic">a trick</hi> of <hi rend="italic">my</hi> countenance, and even some of my attitudes&#x201D;&#x2014;now as to &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">the</hi> trick of my countenance keep it and welcome!&#x2014;for I have always been given to understand that my <hi rend="italic">countenance</hi> was &#x201C;remarkably expressive&#x201D;&#x2014;and so I suppose that if you imitate it in its imitable points&#x2014;not indiscriminatively, like Kate Gilchrist<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Catherine Gilchrist; see <ref target="volume-03/lt-18240811-JBW-TC-01"><sic>3:129&#x2013;30</sic><corr>JBW to TC, <date when="1824-08-11">11 Aug. 1824</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350615-TC-JAC-01"><sic>8:149</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1835-06-15">15 june 1835</date></corr></ref>.</note> turning up the whites of your eyes <foreign><hi rend="italic">par example</hi></foreign> in the monstrous idea that &#x201C;it looked so pooty!&#x2014;&#x201D; there will be no harm done to your own little cherub-face from this remodelling in the likeness of mine&#x2014;but for my <hi rend="italic">attitudes!</hi>&#x2014;humph!&#x2014;you had better hold by <hi rend="italic">your own</hi>, babbie, at least until a less prejudiced judge than Geraldine has told us that any attitude or attitudes of mine would not mar your natural grace&#x2014; When I was so young that people could take liberties, that is to say, could speak the truth to me&#x2014;I was told often enough that I walked &#x201C;as if I were in tight breeches&#x201D;&#x2014; My first dancing Master used to lift me up by the two hands exclaiming in desperate accents &#x201C;heavy! heavy!&#x201D; My last dancing master a highly figurative as well as exaggerative sort of a man used to ask me &#x201C;if I fancied I had Arthur&#x2019;s seat<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hill in Edinburgh, 823 ft.</note> on my back&#x201D;?&#x2014; Our Miller&#x2019;s wife a prophetic woman in her way, declared &#x201C;one had but to look at me to see that I was a <foreign>stickit Callant</foreign> [failed boy]&#x201D;&#x2014;in short never never since I came into this world has it entered into the head of any mortal I believe before Geraldine that &#x201C;my <hi rend="italic">attitudes</hi>&#x201D; could be worth picking up&#x2014;but such are the illusions that come of loving &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">with passion</hi>&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>
<p>I am so glad about the picture!<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Gambardella&#x2019;s portrait of John Welsh.</note>&#x2014;actually I shall have it then in my menagerie!&#x2014;and yet last night I cried myself sick about that very picture&#x2014;every thing like happiness is so spoiled for me now&#x2014;it came into my head&#x2014;how often <hi rend="italic">she</hi><note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC&#x2019;s mother.</note> had wished to have one&#x2014;how delighted she would have been with this&#x2014;what a joyful new year gift it would have been for her&#x2014;and the thought there is <hi rend="italic">only me</hi> to give it to now&#x2014;only me to rejoice over it, went to my heart like a knife&#x2014;and I could not help bursting out acrying even with Carlyle sitting there&#x2014;but when I told him what had been all day in my head he <pb id="pg-15-221" n="15:221"/>said it was &#x201C;quite natural&#x201D; and did not <hi rend="italic">lecture</hi> me as he sometimes does which shuts up all my sorrow in my own heart for weeks after&#x2014;</p>

<salute>Dear Jenny,</salute>
<p>I had better put you off with a small <hi rend="italic">half</hi>penny loaf than no bread: therefore I answer without any delay at all, tho&#x2019; only on a scrap of paper.</p>
<p>It is good news to me that you have got actually over to Scotsbrig. I hope you will be able so to arrange yourself as to stay there for a good while in this dark weather. I often think it a great pity that my Mother had nobody with her, and you nobody with you! If you had a suitable house, could you not live together, and be right use <supplied>[&#x2026;]</supplied><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Line of MS cut out with the signature.</note> expense need not be any consideration; all this could quite easily be arranged; provided you could manage to be comfortable together otherwise. I daresay you often regret you have no right work or task: here it seems to me is work and task, and the best kind of task!&#x2014; I am too far off for prescribing; but this thought is often in my head.</p>
<p>Tell my good Mother that she shall have a Letter from me before long. I am very busy, very confused; but have still fair health, which I ought to be right glad of, and go cheerfully on with.</p>
<p>Last night the Doctor came down to us; sat a couple of hours! He was full of speech, brisk, hearty and well, as I ever saw him. They had arrived the evening before (Wednesday, that is) He is to resume his old weekly dinner on Sunday next again.</p>

<salute>Dear Miss Wilson,</salute>
<p>You are very kind to me, very tolerant of my manifold perversities! Had I the wings of an eagle, I would fly to several places; did one&#x2019;s inner thought radiate out of one, in free clearness, as <hi rend="italic">the Sun&#x2019;s</hi> does, there might be less to tolerate: But, alas, we dwell in houses of clay, houses of <hi rend="italic">dyspepsia,</hi> contraction, obscuration,&#x2014;like sunbeams <hi rend="italic">buried</hi> under rubbish-mountains; and do need all kindness of interpretation from our friends, now and then!</p>
<p>One night, some two weeks ago, feeling as if I were destined <pb id="pg-15-223" n="15:223"/>never to see you more, I equipped myself after tea, and instead of sitting down lazily to books, actually went off to Eccleston Street,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Where Jane Wilson and her brother Thomas lived.</note> in hopes of finding you there for an hour. What a pitch of resolution this indicates is known to Dyspeptics alone! You were not there; you were still at Malvern, and Mr Wilson too; uncertain as to your date of returning.&#x2014; And now here comes your cheerful friendly Note. Let me at least have the privilege of a written word with you by favour of that.</p>
<p>My way of life, for many months past, has been in the highest degree solitary; sunk in the very Death-Kingdoms, in the inmost regions of Night. Oliver remains unutterable; he is clear, burning before my heart: but the means of ever in this world bringing him rightly before another heart remains invisible, impossible. There is no use writing <hi rend="italic">another</hi> dreary vacuity of a &#x201C;History of Cromwell&#x201D;; we already count them by the score. I feel as if England had forever lost her great Oliver; neglected, persecuted, overwhelmed him under &#x201C;dry rubbish,&#x201D; till it was too late.&#x2014; Alas, all remains unutterable with me; all, or nearly all. I write much: but it goes into the fire, into the lumber-drawer, regularly in a week or two. Let us speak no more of that melancholy department of affairs. I consider myself generally as a man lost; absorbed by the &#x201C;Mud Nymphs&#x201D; of Pope&#x2019;s Dunciad; who will never more be heard of, who has to reconcile himself to that unexpected destiny, and be content with it as handsomely as he can. In all cases, are we not bound to say, &#x201C;S<hi rend="italic">o</hi> be it!&#x201D;</p>
<p>Meanwhile I see nobody; converse with nobody except the <hi rend="italic">Manes</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Demogorgons</hi>. My Wife does all the company; I escape, late in the afternoon; walk, for an hour and a half, anywhither, nowhither; return, glad to get in again out of the uproar, out of the smoke and fogs. For the last week, we have had the most appropriate ghost-weather; dim endless slate-coloured Fog; the human creatures with their equipages hanging in it like distracted ghosts, like grey shadows, which I believe in fact they <hi rend="italic">are</hi>.</p>
<p>Not very long ago, however, I did see Henry Taylor and his wife; cheery, not at all ghost-like; just returned from a comfortable rustication in the North. Elliott too I once saw; he and his household are over to Paris for the present.&#x2014; Alas, it is too true about poor Mrs Reeve.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas F. Elliot. Hope Reeve d. <date when="1842-11-27">27 Nov.</date></note> We had not heard of it till your Letter; but on inquiring I learn that it is even she. Her disease, they say, was <hi rend="italic">bronchitis,</hi> coming on in a weak state at her Father&#x2019;s house in Roxburghshire;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Richardson of Kirklands, Ancrum.</note> <pb id="pg-15-224" n="15:224"/>the poor young creature is rapt away into new unknown scenes. Everybody loved her. Who knows whether even this is not best? Life has many worse things in it than swift death among our loved ones.</p>
<p>Perhaps the cheerfullest phenomenon I have fallen in with, of
late, is Alfred Tennyson&#x2019;s new Book of <hi rend="italic">Poems</hi>. It is infinitely gratifying to find one true soul more, a great melodious Poet-soul, breathing the vital air along with us. Such I discover, to my own satisfaction, in this Book of Alfred&#x2019;s. There has no man tried <hi rend="italic">Singing</hi> for a long while in whom I found such a talent for it. Praised be Heaven!&#x2014; You do not know Alfred? A massive, irregular, dusty, brown-complexioned man; a large rough-hewn face, full of darkness, yet of kindness even of good humour; large, gloomy-kindly, Indian eyes, an immense shock of dusty black hair;&#x2014;and one of the best <hi rend="italic">smokers</hi> now living! Right well do I like a pipe beside Alfred: his speech, in that deep clear metallic voice, is right pleasant to me; his very silence, amid the tobacco-clouds, eloquent enough.&#x2014; As you can have no hope of ever smoking with him, I will advise you at least to read his Book.</p>
<p>Another Book I have in store for you, is the &#x201C;Life of Jean Paul,&#x201D; which an American Mrs Lee<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Eliza B. Lee.</note> has lately sent over hither. Did you never think of putting pen to paper; with your new German and much old intelligence and insight? Perhaps the distinction is, at present, <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to do that! Here however is an American woman, who with little labour of soul,&#x2014;mainly by having an open sense and a good pair of scissors,&#x2014;has put together a very readable and useful pair of volumes.</p>
<p>The task meanwhile that I will first of all lay upon you is, to perfect your <foreign><hi rend="italic">Wasser-Cur</hi></foreign> [water cure];<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >At Malvern, famed for its curative mineral springs.</note> get <hi rend="italic">quite</hi> well again, and come back to us, as soon as may be! That is the great thing to be done that;&#x2014;and forgiving me this mad epistle, which I write in the mere <hi rend="italic">nurseryroom</hi> of Demogorgon, with Eris, Discord, the Three Fates and all the rest of them pipeing and squalling round me; but conclude in all <hi rend="italic">sanity</hi> with real gratitude and good wishes for now and for ever; being indeed very truly and heartily always,</p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Your news of the Begg Subscription is very good;&#x2014;and yet not all good: that is a most mortifying paltriness, that of the illustrious Premier <hi rend="italic">pausing</hi> over his first bounty as too enormous, and reducing it to half! I myself saw his autograph, announcing that Great Britain would afford Twenty pounds to the indigent representatives of its greatest man in these centuries; and now, it seems, terrified at the rash act, she has ventured only upon Ten. The sons of Gilbert Burns,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >(<date when="1760-00-00">1760</date>&#x2013;<date when="1827-00-00">1827</date>), Mrs. Begg&#x2019;s brother; see <ref target="volume-03/lt-18250522-TC-JBW-01"><sic>3:333</sic><corr>TC to JBW, <date when="1825-05-22">22 May 1825</date></corr></ref>. At some time he had apparently lent the Beggs &#xa3;10 since Chambers wrote to Isabella Begg about Gilbert&#x2019;s eldest son&#x2019;s &#x201C;secret opposition&#x201D; in the west to the subscription (<date when="1842-10-03">3 Oct.</date>), and that to repay him from their new funds would be &#x201C;a pleasant thing to do &#x2026; the debtor happier to pay than the creditor to receive&#x201D; (<date when="1842-12-15">15 Dec.</date>). Isabella resented their attitude, but Chambers sent advice for repayment to James and Thomas Burns with no &#x201C;personal altercation&#x201D; (<date when="1843-01-13">13 Jan. 1843</date>). Apparently James refused the repayment unpleasantly (<date when="1843-02-08">8 Feb. 1843</date>; MS: NLS Burns Begg deposit 328).</note> too, it would appear, have been &#x201C;eating dirt.&#x201D; Alas, the whole world continually eats quantities of dirt. Yet, praised be Heaven, some Four Hundred pounds for such an end do come out of the world, dirt-eating world as it is; and you, for your share, have been enabled to accomplish your problem, to solace and screen from misery a meritorious, forlorn, every way venerable Scottish heart, to save all Scottish men from a new ugly stigma; and do one other heavenly act under this terrestrial Sun. We will complain of nothing; let us rejoice over many things.</p>
<p>Your project for these young women and their Mother meets, in every feature of it, my entire approbation. They will do better in Ayrshire every way, since they themselves wish to go thither. The scene is, at any rate, more genial, as I suppose, for representatives of Burns; by removal from Tranent, where they have from poor become &#x201C;rich,&#x201D; they escape a multitude of mass village envies, and other impediments; they have free scope to begin on new ground a new course of activities. Being, to all appearance, sensible young women, I think there is no danger but they will do well. Their sixty pounds a-year is perhaps after all just about the happiest sum for them. Work is still useful, necessary; but no longer tyrannous tread-mill necessity; they are not dangerously lifted into a new sphere of existence, but rendered easy in the old one. We may hope, a blessing will be on that poor good household and better outlooks on all sides are opening for them.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-15-226" n="15:226"/>I have signed the Paper.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For the annuity fund of &#xa3;200.</note> I return you again many thanks and congratulations; and am always,</p>

<salute>Dearest Babbie</salute>
<p>I observe both in you and in myself a tendency towards the <foreign><hi rend="italic">tutto o niente</hi></foreign> [all or nothing] system&#x2014;which in these days of penny-postage is surely quite erroneous&#x2014; One should not let ones laudable wish to write long letters, prevent one from writing very often a short one rather than none at all&#x2014; It takes but a few minutes to write a bulletin of ones state and a &#x201C;God bless you&#x201D;&#x2014;and neither you nor I with all our occupations and interruptions can ever be hard put to it to find &#x201C;a few minutes&#x201D; disengaged&#x2014; But the misfortune is; one regards one&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">few minutes</hi> as incapable of being turned to any better account than warming ones feet or the like&#x2014;and <hi rend="italic">the few hours</hi> come to hand more seldom&#x2014; People would do well to apply the proverb &#x201C;look to the pence and the pounds will look to themselves,&#x201D; to their time as well as their money&#x2014;for the squandering of <hi rend="italic">moments</hi> has more bad result in the long run than the most James-Bailliesh scorn of &#x201C;coppers&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>
<p>It is with an awakening of Conscience on this time-subject that I snatch a pen to scrawl you such a &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">scrap</hi>&#x201D; as circumstances will allow of&#x2014;not that I have any thing more vital or more pleasant to do this morning&#x2014;but that I am feeling very unable to do anything whatever&#x2014;</p>
<p>I do not know what sort of instructions Carlyle can have given to Morah about coming to see me&#x2014;but the result is he has not arrived yet&#x2014;which is not after the usual fashion of D<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> who are generally ready enough to go after patients  Meanwhile John is returned and has taken up the matter of my side exactly as I predict&#x2014;had not the slightest recollection that I ever spoke of it to him before&#x2014; When he asked me &#x201C;where is it <hi rend="italic">at all?</hi>&#x201D; I could hardly help taking the poker to him&#x2014; Having given him however without minding his unmeaning questions as particular an account of it as I could he told me with supreme indifference that I &#x201C;seemed to have got some disorder of the liver and might try <hi rend="italic">a</hi> blue pill for it&#x201D;!</p>
<p><pb id="pg-15-227" n="15:227"/>He did not even write me a prescription for the pills that night&#x2014;not till last night&#x2014;when he dined here&#x2014; I will try his blue pill for a week or two longer and if it does me no good I will go to Sir James Clark&#x2014;as Elizabeth recommends and who will go along with me&#x2014; The rest of Johns advice was that I should walk a great deal &#x201C;without minding the pain&#x2014;it was <hi rend="italic">probably</hi> good for me in the long-run&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>
<p>Here has been Elizabeth for an hour and half&#x2014;and since I am to

<salute>Dear Sterling,</salute>
<p>I cannot convince you of Shakspeare at present:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-15/lt-18421121-TC-JOST-01">TC to <sic>JS</sic><corr>JOST</corr>, <date when="1842-11-21">21 Nov.</date></ref></note> how can I? But it remains part of a very central conviction with myself, which seems to spread largely in late years, and explains many things for me. In good truth, the enormous opulence of Life in this old universe surpasses comprehension. Game Cocks fight: but the million-millionth part of them are never hatched at all; they are eaten, by the legion, at breakfast as mere eggs! A little Egyptian horse-litter, or Piccadilly steam heat had made Cocks of them:&#x2014; Think, think!&#x2014;</p>
<p>By what chance it happens I know not; but the Letter on Miner Verran, dated almost four weeks back, arrives along with the other this morning. Perhaps you <hi rend="italic">have</hi> been inquiring of him that keeps the Gig? In that case too, the response, as I infer, was satisfactory.</p>
<p>This man Verran is evidently a hopeful person; one of those rare human beings whom it is not very difficult to help. Decidedly he ought to be tried, to a certain extent. In what way, with what precautions, pre-inquiries &#x26;c, I will leave you and our benevolent Friends altogether to decide. A sum of 40 or 50 pounds, to aid him in his noble purpose of schooling himself, might at any rate be useful. I put down my sovereign on the adjoined leaf (the Post-Office order goes along with it); do you and other kind men add what more you can, in the shape of money or of better than money: my poor faculty in regard to the matter is as good as out. But just men beholding such a thing are <hi rend="italic">bound</hi> to acknowledge it,&#x2014;to cherish it and the like of it as Heaven&#x2019;s sacred fire on the altar of this our common Earth, not too copiously supplied with fire at present! I have rarely fallen in with a more assistable-looking man than this same most meritorious Verran. Tell the Misses Fox that I specially recommend him to them. Tell all people that a man of this kind <hi rend="italic">ought</hi> to be hatched; that it were shameful to eat him as a breakfast egg! And so Heaven prosper him; and you, and all the benefactors he can find: and may some blessing come out of this inquiry, and not a curse to any one.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Caroline Fox noted, <date when="1842-11-19">19 Nov.</date>, that Verran was trying to save &#x201C;&#xa3;30 or &#xa3;40, in order to leave off work,&#x201D; and to educate himself (Fox 174). This led Sterling, in the delayed letter, to report it to TC, who started a subscription list which he sent to Sterling. It is headed, in TC&#x2019;s hand: &#x201C;To Michael Verran, seemingly a right brave man, and highly worthy of being educated, these small gifts of money, if they can assist him therein, are with all hopefulness and good regard presented, by certain undersigned fellow wayfarers and warfarers of his.&#x201D; Most, including TC, Sterling, W. E. Hickson, R. Barclay Fox and others, gave &#xa3;1; see Isaac Foot, <hi rend="italic">Michael Verran</hi> 38, with facsimile opp. 7. On <date when="1842-12-17">17 Dec.</date> Sterling brought Caroline TC&#x2019;s letter and the list, and she copied the third para. about Verran into her journal (174). Sterling also wrote out the same passage (MS: Strouse), with the same date, adding &#x201C;N.B. Not to be copied &#x26; to be returned to me J.S.&#x201D;</note></p>

There is after all a strange truth in what is called <hi rend="italic">the force of blood</hi>&#x2014; I can hardly be said ever to have seen this young man&#x2014;for now that he is filling such a manly function; we must not call him <hi rend="italic">boy</hi> any longer&#x2014;and yet I felt this piece of good fortune which has befallen him quite as a kindness of Providence towards <hi rend="italic">myself</hi>, and with a warmth of gladness which I am sure I could not have <hi rend="italic">got up</hi> at that moment, had it been announced to me that my most intimate friend, not a <hi rend="italic">cousin</hi> or otherwise <hi rend="italic">related</hi> to me in nature, had been made prime minister!&#x2014;
It is not so much the employment, the salary, the practice which it offers him in the meanwhile, nor yet the prospects of promotion, according to his turn of mind, which it opens to him hereafter, that delights me in this appointment; but it is the indubitable testimony to his character and capacity which lies in it, and from those who have had the best opportunities of judging of him. <hi rend="italic">Success</hi> in this world does not always follow from having deserved to succeed&#x2014;but the man who has deserved to succeed <hi rend="italic">can do either way</hi>&#x2014; his well-wishers need fear no particular anxiety about the result&#x2014; And so I recommend him to Providence and to <hi rend="italic">himself</hi>, with my blessing.</p>
<p>I do not get strong at all, which is a pity more for others than for myself&#x2014; One has no business to lament that one has not strength to do this and that, so long as one does not do all that <hi rend="italic">is</hi> possible with the strength one <hi rend="italic">has</hi>. It were just as rational to complain that one has not a thousand a year, while one keeps a hundred lying, at no interest&#x2014; <pb id="pg-15-231" n="15:231"/>My brother-in-law tells me that I shall probably be better in a month; when I shall have swallowed heaven knows how many more blue-pills, for a pain in my side that has plagued me all the last year&#x2014; Maybe so! Meanwhile I am not confined to the house, but walk a little every day the weather being most mild&#x2014;unnaturally so. Pray give my kind regards to my Aunts. I will write to Anne one of these days.</p>

<salute>My dearest M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Russel</salute>
<p>I meant to have written to you yesterday along with my letter for Margaret but how to write to you without mentioning the purport of my writing to <hi rend="italic">her</hi>, and how very much I had it at heart that she should come? And then if it so happened that she applied to <hi rend="italic">you</hi> for advice&#x2014;as is likely enough&#x2014;and that your real opinion was she had better remain with her children?&#x2014; Between the two, you were thus, it seemed to me, going to find yourself in a constrained position in which it was hardly fair to place you. But now this morning comes another consideration&#x2014; (I have such a way of tormenting myself with all sorts of out-of-the-way considerations!) viz: that you might think it unkind of me to send a letter to your care without a word&#x2014;and unkindness towards <hi rend="italic">you</hi>&#x2014;is what I could not bear to lie under the smallest suspicion of&#x2014;even for a moment&#x2014; Oh no my dear M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Russel&#x2014;tho I should never see you more, not hear from you more, I shall think of you, and love you, and be grateful to you as long as I live. But for the knowledge of what you did for her,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;She means her mother&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note in <hi rend="italic">LM</hi>).</note> and how thankfully she felt it&#x2014; I know not how I should ever have brought myself to think of her last weeks with any <pb id="pg-15-232" n="15:232"/>degree of composure&#x2014; As it was; God knows there still remains enough to feel eternal regrets about&#x2014;but without a friend like you, to make her feel that she was not quite <hi rend="italic">alone</hi> with her sickness and her vexations, it would have been unspeakably worse for her then, and for me now&#x2014;</p>
<p>How grieved I was that I happened to be absent during your Fathers stay in London. I felt somehow as if he had come from her&#x2014;had brought me kind messages from her&#x2014;and I had missed him!&#x2014; I would have returned immediately on purpose to see him&#x2014;but they knew that I would, and so did not tell me until it was too late&#x2014; But he will come again having found how easy it is?&#x2014; Will he not, and bring you with him?&#x2014; Oh I should like so well to have you here!</p>
<p>I am always very weakly in health, tho&#x2019; better than when I last wrote to you&#x2014; At present my Brother-in-law has put me on a course of blue-pill for pain in my side&#x2014; But until I turn what health and strength <hi rend="italic">I have</hi> to better account I have no business to regret that I have not more&#x2014; I wish you would write to me some day and tell me about old Mary<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mills.</note> and all the people&#x2014; Thornhill and Templand and every thing about there is often as distinct before my eyes as the house and street I am actually living in&#x2014;but <hi rend="italic">as it was</hi>&#x2014;as it must be <hi rend="italic">now</hi> I can never bring myself to figure it&#x2014; Give my kindest regards to your Father and Husband&#x2014; I felt your Father&#x2019;s letter very kind&#x2014; God bless you dear M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Russel</p>

<salute>My dearest Babbie</salute>
<p>Another scrap then till better times!&#x2014; I have just read your letter and have to suggest that you should provide with all despatch a&#x2014;bottle of better ink! Mazzini was complaining yesterday that you had sent him &#x201C;a little little bit of note which was for him, what shall I say, <hi rend="italic">unintelligible</hi> upon my honour&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;Unintelligible&#x201D; &#x201C;Yes she has written it in ink so pale!&#x2014;so pale! as if to say you shall <hi rend="italic">not</hi> understand&#x201D;</p>
<p>And now I can sympathize with his moral dissatisfaction, for tho&#x2019; I <pb id="pg-15-233" n="15:233"/>have made a shift to &#x201C;understand,&#x201D; it has been a thing of serious difficulty&#x2014;</p>
<p>The reason I cannot write long today is that the day is beautiful and I must go out forthwith&#x2014;being ordered to <hi rend="italic">walk</hi> a great deal &#x201C;without minding the pain&#x201D;&#x2014; More easy to say than do!&#x2014; Since the fact that walking always increases the pain is taken as an evidence that it is <hi rend="italic">good</hi> for it&#x2014;on the same ground I may infer that the pills <hi rend="italic">agree</hi> with me, as the pain has certainly been more <hi rend="italic">acute</hi> since I began to take them. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Nous verrons</hi></foreign> [We shall see]&#x2014; I would have started writing earlier, or rather I should say writing to you earlier&#x2014;but that I had to write to Margaret Hiddlestone and M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Russel&#x2014;I fear there is not much hope that Margaret will leave her children to come here&#x2014;but if she chooses to do it, it is now put in her power!</p>

I had better just see if I could get one to do better&#x2014;it was &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">no obligating</hi> of her,&#x201D; my keeping her&#x2014;she <hi rend="italic">daresaid</hi> she could get herself a place&#x2014;and maybe a good one too!&#x201D; &#x26;c &#x26;c all this at being asked to be quiet!&#x2014;and all this to a person who had not slept!&#x2014; &#x2014;But the creature with all her good qualities is <hi rend="italic">a fool</hi> every inch of her and what can one do with a fool?&#x2014; I am quite tired of trying to guide her in the way she should go&#x2014;and these ever-recurring explosions she makes upon me really do me physical mischief&#x2014; <foreign>Ergo</foreign> she shall go so soon as I can find another servant that looks feasable&#x2014;one that without &#x201C;adoring me&#x201D; will do her work and let me alone of professions and insolence at one and the same time.</p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Take a very small word from me, rather than nothing at all! If I were not in a very confused condition, I would write you a long Letter; but I have been writing all day, and my head is muddled and wearied; and I must simply be content with this scrap of paper to assure you that nothing has gone wrong, that all is well here.</p>
<p>Jack dined with us on the Sabbath afternoon according to old custom; he also came down incidentally yesterday, and we had a long walk together. I have not seen him looking better for years. He appears to be reconciled to his dull place, for the sake of its great wages; he has got it all regulated round him, and makes it go on smoothly, like a man turning the handle of a machine. I calculate that he may stay there a good while yet, and grow richer and richer.</p>
<p>As for me I keep my health, and endeavour to plod along at my work. No work is <hi rend="italic">play</hi>; therefore I will not complain of this: but it is confused enough; and often reduces me to fatal-looking pauses! It grows bigger and bigger too, as I go on;&#x2014;this is not an evil either; but properly a great blessing. I feel as if I had still many a thing to say, of very vital consequence, to this generation of men, which perhaps there is no other man in such a condition to say. One ought to hold on, and make no cavils, but &#x201C;work while it is called Today.&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. John 9:4 and Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi> 197.</note></p>
<p>Jenny&#x2019;s little Note apprised me that she was <hi rend="italic">come</hi> over to you. I hope she will stay there till the Sun gets a little higher up again. It is <pb id="pg-15-235" n="15:235"/>much more pleasant for me to figure you with Jenny close at hand, than all alone in the dark winter days. I wish I knew anything I could do for you, dear good Mother! Alas, I can do nothing,&#x2014;except write a piece of a Letter now and then; and even that I do not manage too well!&#x2014;</p>
<p>We have amazing bright weather here for such a season; the Sun out all day, and a small fire almost too hot in the room at night. One does not like such weather at such a season: cold weather is too apt to come when there should be heat.&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; Indeed I understand it is not at all a wholesome time here; an <hi rend="italic">influenza</hi> is spreading wide, and proves dangerous to many. Yesterday I met a confused crowd of people on the streets, soon after parting with Jack: I found it was a man and his wife that had <hi rend="italic">both</hi> died; their two coffins, <hi rend="italic">brown</hi> pauper coffins, were both going to the grave together, and a crowd of poor neighbours had gone out to witness it. The lowest classes of the people here have an altogether shocking indifference for the Dead: but some kind of emotion rises in them, when a tragedy like this unusual one takes place.&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; Their poverty and distress at present, I believe, are very great; tho&#x2019; nothing at all to what some Lancashire and other Towns are still suffering.</p>
<p>Poor Mrs Sterling has fallen ill this winter; the Doctors fear it is some disease of the heart: Jane goes up to her whenever she can; is afraid sometimes that her poor Friend is not in a good way.</p>
<p>I know not if you read in the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, about two months ago, a story of two miners that were on the point of being <hi rend="italic">both</hi> blown to pieces with a charge of gunpowder (as the &#x201C;<foreign>weamsie</foreign> [container]&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word not in <hi rend="italic">SND</hi>.

We were greatly struck here with the nobleness of such an action; after great difficulty I got ascertained <hi rend="italic">where</hi> it was: I had people set to investigate it; found it out to be strictly <hi rend="italic">true:</hi> The result is that a small subscription has been begun to assist the man in schooling himself; and certain benevolent Quakers &#x26;c of the neighbourhood are permanently interested in him. I hope it will do good.&#x2014; This little Note is about it; from a young Quaker lady to John Sterling. I know not if you will be able to make it out, or put the story well together; but perhaps it may interest you for a moment.</p>
<p>Jane has been out, and reports that the wind is grown <hi rend="italic">cold</hi> and <pb id="pg-15-236" n="15:236"/>bitter,&#x2014;and indeed I can discern here the Sun has for some time got himself all wrapt in lead-coloured mists again. I should be out before the rain come on; while there is yet daylight above the horizon!&#x2014;</p>
<p>This is a poor rigmarole of a scrawl, my dear Mother, and far more of it than I meant; but I know you will say, The more the better. Take it with my heart&#x2019;s wishes.</p>
<p>I have been questioning Jack about you all, but have not got the half out of him yet. He <hi rend="italic">touches</hi> upon all things, but <hi rend="italic">dwells</hi> to the full on none. I question and cross-question.</p>
<p>Will you write to me soon; or tell some of the others of their duty to write? I want news, as full and copious as possible. Jamie was to write, I think! I have a claim against Alick!&#x2014; My blessings with one and all of you. <foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Mother, for this day. <closer><salute>Your affectionate Son</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear friend</salute>
<p>I would have written by return of post, only that I thought it would be more satisfactory for you if I sent Alicia Campbells opinion along with my own&#x2014; I have several times already for my own satisfaction, sounded <hi rend="italic">her</hi> on the subject of your Mother&#x2019;s illness&#x2014;but whether it be that she really <hi rend="italic">has</hi> no decided opinion, or that she thinks it most prudent to keep it to herself, the fact is that I have never been able to get anything out of her but what a person walking in from the street might have seen with his own eyes&#x2014;with <hi rend="italic">your</hi> authority however to question her, it seemed possible she might be more communicative&#x2014; and so I went to Knightsbridge yesterday to try&#x2014;but no Alicia was there nor your Mother either&#x2014; They were both &#x201C;gone in a fly&#x201D;&#x2014;I suppose to the Dentist&#x2019;s&#x2014; To day I do not feel well enough myself to repeat so long a journey; so I will not keep you waiting any longer&#x2014;but give you my own notions in the mean time and if Alicia throws any more light for me on the question I will write again.</p>
<p>Your Father sees and <hi rend="italic">hears</hi> and speaks so much thro&#x2019; the state of his own spirits at the moment that I do not wonder his letters should perplex you&#x2014; To judge from his general speech about your Mother&#x2014;she has a decided disease of the heart, pronounced incurable, and making rapid progress&#x2014;but when I take him up tightly, and beg him to &#x201C;stick by the fact of what the D<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> said&#x201D;&#x2014;it has always been reduced <pb id="pg-15-237" n="15:237"/>to no more than this, &#x201C;that there is a decided <hi rend="italic">tendency</hi> to disease of the heart&#x2014;which <hi rend="italic">disease</hi> is incurable&#x2014;but that with care she may stave it off for years&#x201D;&#x2014; He will come in sometimes looking the picture of despair and answer to my question how is she? &#x201C;sinking rapidly; there is nothing for me now, but to prepare myself for the worst&#x201D;&#x2014;and when I go; I will find Her at her worsted work not worse to appearance than I have seen her a hundred times over&#x2014; Not that I do not think her very unwell&#x2014; I have thought her so for a long time&#x2014;before she went to Dublin<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In the summer.</note>&#x2014;when no one was taking any notice of it&#x2014;there was an unrest of body and mind about her then which looked quite as alarming to me and more painful than her present prostration of strength: but I do not for my own part, with such light as a mere chance visitor can have, fancy her in any immediate danger. Some days she looks very low and weak indeed&#x2014;and if that state were continual or seeming to tend always towards greater weakness, I should fear that she could not bear up against it many months&#x2014;but suddenly she revives&#x2014;is able to talk quite cheerfully&#x2014;to walk several times round the garden&#x2014;and pronounces herself &#x201C;very much better thank God&#x201D;&#x2014;which seems to indicate that her strength is not so much cut away from her by an incurable malady, as prostrated from time to time by disorder of the stomach or nervous ailments&#x2014;</p>
<p>I expect the visit of Charlotte Reddy<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> will do her more good&#x2014;than those of so many D<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> as have lately been worrying and flurrying her&#x2014; Her life at Knightsbridge is very lonely&#x2014;and your Father is not a good hand to be near a person who needs to be kept as tranquil as possible. The very <hi rend="italic">sighs</hi> he gives in looking at her would do <hi rend="italic">me</hi> a world of mischief I know, were I in her place&#x2014; Alicia is very kind and willing&#x2014;but there is no <hi rend="italic">moral</hi> result out of her for a person needing to be encouraged, and amused and sometimes&#x2014;calmed&#x2014;and for myself I am always so weakly that I cannot go to her nearly so often as I wish&#x2014;and when I am there cannot do her the good I wish&#x2014; God bless you my dear friend&#x2014; <closer><salute>Remember me to your wife&#x2014;and believe me always your affectionate</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>For several months now I have been a great defaulter; defrauding you of a most indispensable reply to a kind message, and myself of a great pleasure in imparting it! How this has been, by what foolish combinations of sickliness, idleness, excessive work, you, who, alas are yourself too often a sick man, will perhaps well enough understand. Suffice it now, better now than still later, very penitently and very thankfully to say that your most welcome Gift, with the kind written remembrance in it, arrived safe here, in due course; that I have read the Books, especially your own part of them, a good while ago, with agreeable results then and since;&#x2014;and that now, when you are home again (as I hope) refreshed and recruited by the Bath waters and summer recreations, I knock again at your town door with a grateful salutation.</p>
<p>Your <foreign><hi rend="italic">Denkw&#xfc;rdigkeiten</hi></foreign> [<hi rend="italic">Memoirs</hi>] are again, as ever, the delightfullest reading to me. Truly, I think, were I an absolute monarch I should decree among other things, That Varnhagen von Ense be encouraged, ordered and even compelled to write and ever to continue writing Memoirs! It is authentically my feeling. Always, alas, as one grows older, one&#x2019;s appetite for Books grows more fastidious; there is now for me very little speculation and almost nothing of the so-called Poetic that I can bear to read at all: but a man with eyes, with a soul and heart, to tell me in candid clearness what he saw passing round him in this universe,&#x2014;is and remains for ever a welcome man. Speculations, Poetries, what passes in this or the other poor human brain,&#x2014;if it be not some most rare brain of a Goethe or the like: this is often a very small matter; a matter one had rather <hi rend="italic">not</hi> know. But what passes in God&#x2019;s universe; this verily is a thing one does wish to know, if one adequately could! In truth, I have not for years read any writings that please me, solace and recreate me as these <foreign><hi rend="italic">Denkw&#xfc;rdigkeiten</hi></foreign> do. It is beautiful to see such a work so done. A Historical Picture of the living Present Time; all struck off with such light felicity, such harmonious clearness and composure; such a deep, what I could call <hi rend="italic">unconscious</hi> soul of Method lying under it:&#x2014;the work of an Artist! Well; I will thank you; and wish you long heart and strength to continue, for my own sake and the world&#x2019;s; for the sake of this Time, and <pb id="pg-15-239" n="15:239"/>perhaps still more of the Times that are coming.&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; Your Russian Kartaptschin<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Perhaps someone Varnhagen met when he was a capt. in the Russian army, <date when="1813-00-00">1813</date>.</note> is a terrible fellow; a man in the style of Michael Angelo! One begins to understand how what I often call &#x201C;dumb Russia&#x201D; may be a kind of dumb Rome, one of the greatest phenomena on the Earth at present, with such souls in it here and there. We have to thank you, at least I have, for shewing us a glimpse of actual Russia face to face for the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> time. By your help I got a real direct look at the wild Poet-soul, Puschkin;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Aleksander Sergevitch Pushkin (<date when="1799-00-00">1799</date>&#x2013;<date when="1837-00-00">1837</date>), poet; author of <hi rend="italic">Eugene Onegin, The Queen of Spades</hi>, and other works.</note> and said to myself, Yes, there is a Russian man of genius; for the first time, I <hi rend="italic">see</hi> something of the Russians! We begin here, the better heads of us, to have a certain true respect for Russia with all its &#x201C;barbarism&#x201D; real and imaginary; to understand that tho&#x2019; the Russians have all Journalists in the world against them, they have Nature, Nature&#x2019;s Laws and God Almighty partly in their favour! They can drill wild savage peoples and tame waste continents, tho&#x2019; they cannot write Journalistic Articles. What a contrast with our French friends! <hi rend="italic">They</hi> can prove by the precisest logic before all men that they were, are and probably will always be in possession of the true light: <foreign><hi rend="italic">Viol&#xE0;</hi></foreign> [There], this is the key to all arcana, <hi rend="italic">this</hi> of ours. And then take a look at them in Algiers<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410516-TC-KAVE-01">TC to KAVE, <date when="1841-05-16">16 May 1841</date></ref>.</note> and elsewhere!&#x2014;</p>
<p>My own studies and struggles, totally ineffectual as yet, have lain <supplied>[prin]</supplied>cipally for a long time back in the direction of Oliver Cromwell and our great Puritan Civil-War, what I call the &#x201C;Apotheosis of Protestantism.&#x201D; I do not count with any certainty that I shall ever get a Book out of it: but in the meanwhile it leads to various results for me; across all the portentous rubbish and pedantry of two centuries I have got a fair front view, also, of the flaming sun-countenance of Cromwell,&#x2014;and find it great and god-like enough, tho&#x2019; entirely <hi rend="italic">un</hi>utterable to these days. Our Histories of him, contemporary and subsequent are numerous; all stupid, some of them almost infinitely stupid. The man remains imprisoned, as under &#xc6;tna-Mountains of rubbish; unutterable, I suppose, for ever. But the meaning of this preamble, was that I had an inquiry to make of you: Whether, namely, there exist in German any intelligent and intelligible Book about the military antiquities of Gustavus Adolphus&#x2019;s time? Much in our Cromwell&#x2019;s methods of fighting &#x26;c remains obstinately obscure to me. I understand only that it was the German and Swedish method; the chief officers of our Civil War, especially great multitudes of Scotch had served in the <pb id="pg-15-240" n="15:240"/>Thirty-Years War.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Gustavus II, Gustavus Adolpus (<date when="1594-00-00">1594</date>&#x2013;<date when="1632-00-00">1632</date>), king of Sweden, the greatest military genius of the seventeenth cent., shown in the Thirty Years&#x2019; War (<date when="1614-00-00">1614</date>&#x2013;<date when="1648-00-00">48</date>) which was initially between the Catholics and Protestants of Germany but eventually involving most of W Europe.</note> Often have I reflected, in gazing into military puzzles of that period, &#x201C;Would that I had Varnhagen here, the Soldier and Thinker, to tell me what this means!&#x201D; I decide on asking if there is any German Book, at least. But I fear there is none. We have a late <hi rend="italic">Life of Wallenstein</hi> by a very intelligent Scotch Soldier, Colonel Mitchell;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Mitchell (<date when="1785-00-00">1785</date>&#x2013;<sic><date when="1858-00-00">1858</date></sic><corr><date when="1859-00-00">1859</date></corr>; <ref target="volume-15/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/18843"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>) fought in the Napoleonic wars; eventually a maj.-gen., <date when="1855-00-00">1855</date>; author of <hi rend="italic">The Life of Wallenstein</hi> (<date when="1837-00-00">1837</date>) and other works about military figures. Albrecht Eusebius Wenzel von Wallenstein (<date when="1583-00-00">1583</date>&#x2013;<date when="1634-00-00">1634</date>), commander-in-chief of the Catholic forces in the Thirty Years&#x2019; War, was defeated, <date when="1632-00-00">1632</date>.</note> but Mitchell too says he cannot understand <hi rend="italic">how</hi> they fought with their pikes and muskets or matchlocks; in short, I find he knows no more of it than I do.</p>
<p>There is a <hi rend="italic">Life of Jean Paul</hi> come to me from over the Atlantic; by one Mrs Lee, of Boston; an entertaining little Book, and curious as coming from the other hemisphere. I think of sending you a copy by some opportunity if I can find one.&#x2014; Pray write to me by and by; do not imitate <hi rend="italic">my</hi> sluggishness!&#x2014; <closer><salute>Yours ever, with true regard,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Jean,</salute>
<p>Your Letter, a long time expected, came last week; and very glad we were to hear of you again. My scribbling gets on very ill today, and my time is nearly run; wherefore I have shoved it aside, and taken out a small sheet to scribble some line to <hi rend="italic">you</hi> upon.&#x2014; I find writing grow no easier to me (that is, writing of Books); but always almost the more difficult! I see too, well enough, how could be made a thousand times easier, a thousand times profitabler for the moment; but then it would only be for the moment,&#x2014;wherefore, having all Eternity before one, it seems better after all to stand by the old method!</p>
<p>Your poor Haddington beggar-woman<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> shall be welcome when she comes here; Jane may probably know her. If she have her American Son&#x2019;s address, it will of course be very possible to communicate with him. At all events the poor woman can have our good wishes, a morsel of victuals and a shilling. She is likely to arrive by and by, if she live.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-15-241" n="15:241"/>Jack returned to Town almost a fortnight ago; he has been here two Sundays, and twice at other incidental times. He looks as well and hearty as I have seen him do for long. His life, I fancy, is very idle; the task set to him is that of being three-parts idle patiently and with high wages. I daresay it gets easier and easier: I should not wonder if he staid there a long time. There is much fine faculty lying in him, which, for want of some one very subordinate <hi rend="italic">screw</hi> or other to tighten it all up into firm activity, runs risk of never coming out of him now;&#x2014;which is a great pity. But one cannot help loving him, poor Doil, and being right glad at whatever good befals him.&#x2014; For one thing, you are not henceforth to send his <hi rend="italic">Herald</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Dumfries Herald</hi>.</note> Newspaper any more hither to me, but directly to himself, &#x201C;3. Chester Terrace, Regent&#x2019;s Park, London&#x201D;: it was so settled last Sunday night. I generally get a <hi rend="italic">Herald</hi> otherwise, about Monday or Tuesday; I think, from Dr Russell of Thornhill, in return for a certain Catholic <hi rend="italic">Tablet</hi> which I still send to good old Mr Dobbie (he used to read it after Mrs Welsh): this is quite enough for me; I generally despatch it very soon to Jamie at Scotsbrig: the <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi> now goes on, this long while, to John Carlyle in Canada, and I <hi rend="italic">suppose</hi> arrives.</p>
<p>The Dr does not seem to think it so likely as you that Jenny will practically think of America in Spring. The scheme is indeed very desperate; and what you can do in reason to obstruct it you ought to do: but on all sides poor Jenny has a difficult outlook,&#x2014;unless she could once humble her mind to her new unexpected situation, fairly and utterly <hi rend="italic">forget</hi> the worthless Windbag<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Hanning.</note> that has near ruined her, and above all begin some new independent course of exertion how humble soever. All this, I doubt, is still far from her. To me, it seems always, as if by far her likeliest course of <hi rend="italic">work</hi> were that of tending, serving, and taking filial care of our good old Mother,&#x2014;which would be a most grateful service to us all: to be acknowledged by us all. But I am told they do not get on well together; and that this cannot be done? I have written hinting such a thing, and how easy it were to have another house &#x26;c; but I can advise nothing positive, being so ignorant of it all. She is over at Scotsbrig just now, and all is reported well there, not many days ago.</p>
<p>Two o&#x2019;clock has struck, dear Sister; I must dismiss you with this pitiful offput! James Stewart of Gillenbie was here lately; he is now home again. I am well, only in terrible tribulation with mere mere<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> rubbish and chippings accumulating round me, and no right <hi rend="italic">wall</hi> <pb id="pg-15-242" n="15:242"/>rising! Jane is under Jack&#x2019;s care for a seated pain in her side,&#x2014;which seems to be removing. My blessings on James and all the rest of you!</p>

<salute>Dear Sterling,</salute>
<p>The man of the gig<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> never heard of me or of my interest in Verran; nor have I, nor did I seek to have, the slightest inkling of knowledge about that matter save what you vouchsafed me. Nor do I venture to suggest, or hope or expect, in the least degree, what you are to do farther or to forbear doing with respect to the mining Hero. Pray proceed in it as if I had ceased to exist; as if I had died entirely, bequeathing you my thanks.</p>
<p>The truth is, having the daily firmer conviction that Hero-worship is not an ornamental flourish of rhetoric but an eternal fact, as old as the Almighty Founder himself, and destined to be the one salvation of the world in these coming times, I said to myself: &#x201C;is not this perhaps a hero? Thou hitherto art the only hero-worshipper yet living;&#x2014;why <pb id="pg-15-244" n="15:244"/>not <hi rend="italic">proceed</hi> to worship,&#x2014;to the extent of twenty shillings and some inquiries from Sterling?&#x201D; This I said, and this I have done; and so end.</p>
<p>My Wife has your Letter this morning.&#x2014; The Preadamite Powers of Chaos are in me; and my soul with excess of Stupidity, Pusillanimity, Tailor-melancholy<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi> 288.</note> and approaches of mere Desperation and Dog-madness, is as if blotted out. Strange to reflect, during a three-days rain, when all is mud and misery here below, that half a mile up, there <hi rend="italic">is</hi> everlasting azure and a Sun shining as formerly!</p>
<p>No Cromwell will ever come out of me in this world. I dare not even try Cromwell!</p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>The more I considered that matter of Mrs Begg&#x2019;s Pension, the more incredible it became to me that Sir Rob<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Peel could have done such a thing. My first hypothesis was that I had misunderstood your Letter; that by the omission of some &#x201C;each,&#x201D; or other such word, the meaning might have been defaced and overset in that passage. But no: there is a second sentence in which you say, and count expressly, that the Beggs have <hi rend="italic">ten</hi> pounds in all from this source. My next conclusion therefore was that some Clerk or Subaltern Official at the Treasury was in error; that if so, Sir Robert ought to be again made acquainted with the matter.</p>
<p>Accordingly I set one of my friends to make inquiry at the Treasury: his answer arrives this morning, That all is right there; that it is not ten pounds to the two Misses Begg, but ten pounds to each of them,&#x2014;twenty pounds in all, as was originally settled. Here are the particulars as he writes them down.</p>
<p>With great satisfaction I conclude, therefore that your information was defective; that the business itself is all right. Your own reckoning, with the results of it, you can rectify at your leisure: but if there <hi rend="italic">is</hi> anything else to be rectified, if these Treasury people are still in error or defect, pray apprise me instantly. Otherwise, I say, there is no haste.</p>

<dateline>Wednesday [<date when="1842-12-21">21 December 1842</date>]&#x2014;</dateline>
<salute>My darling Babbie</salute>
<p>Before committing myself to the general stream of things; I must beg your attention to a brief exposition of my difficulties in the one matter of writing&#x2014;</p>
<p>For the last week or two we have breakfasted later than usual, C. seldom coming down before half after nine&#x2014;<foreign><hi rend="italic">tant mieux</hi></foreign> [so much the better], so far as that goes&#x2014;by the time the table has been cleared for writing and oneself emerged out of dressing-gown into fit-to-be-seen-in gown eleven has probably struck&#x2014; Say that I then fall to writing&#x2014;first comes Helen &#x201C;what about the dinner Mum&#x201D;?&#x2014;&#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Chops!</hi>&#x201D;&#x2014;that at least is quickly settled&#x2014;but then perhaps comes Carlyle to say &#x201C;Jane, these cloth-boots of mine are in iminent need of some repair,&#x201D; or &#x201C;Jane these cloth trowsers of mine must have a new hem at the bottom&#x201D;&#x2014;or &#x201C;Jane, some thing or other&#x201D; alike inconvenient at that particular moment&#x2014; Or perhaps Elizabeth Pepoli comes (she comes very often at present) &#x201C;to catch me before I go out&#x201D;&#x2014;or perhaps the Postman brings some note or letter that makes it imperative for me to turn my writing into another channel than the premeditated one of Babbie.&#x2014; There is hardly a day that one or another of these <hi rend="italic">perhapses</hi> does not come to pass&#x2014;then, if <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the forenoon were at my own disposal, as it used to be, Babbie might still get her letter&#x2014;but at <hi rend="italic">one</hi> o&#x2019;clock&#x2014;I am <hi rend="italic">forced</hi> to go out&#x2014;every day, unless it rains&#x2014;which at present it seems resolute not to do&#x2014;now that this odious walking forms part of my <hi rend="italic">medical</hi> treatment there is no evading of it without getting myself into worse trouble&#x2014;
If, after coming in, there be a leisure half hour or so before dinner I am too much fagged to turn it to any earthly account&#x2014;and in the evening I have neither privacy nor strength for writing&#x2014; I am always wearied and <hi rend="italic">sick</hi> in the evenings&#x2014;the effect I suppose of the walking and the blue-pills&#x2014; The beautiful part of it is that this sort of thing may go on for ever so long&#x2014; John tells me that &#x201C;if I can trace any perceptible improvement in myself after having continued the pills for <hi rend="italic">a month</hi>, it will be as soon as I have any business to look for it&#x201D;&#x2014; Well, patience&#x2014; And do you dear help me to be patient by writing always as if I made you the most liberal returns&#x2014;</p>
<p>I received yesterday by rail-way a bundle of Manuscript from <pb id="pg-15-246" n="15:246"/>Geraldine and M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Paulet<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The story of Jewsbury&#x2019;s novel is important partly for itself (as a widely read feminist novel of the time) and also for the way it involved JWC. Jewsbury evidently began it in collaboration with Elizabeth Paulet. In <date when="1841-06-00">June 1841</date> they had agreed to tell the story &#x201C;in letters&#x201D; about the recent history of the inhabitants of Seaforth House (i.e., the Paulet family and, perhaps, their connections), &#x201C;the fierce passages of life and suffering we had seen pass, and our philosophy on the same!&#x201D; (Ireland 17). At first, Mrs. Paulet took the leading part; but, as it went on, Jewsbury took over. She had also written to JWC that it was &#x201C;something of the kind you once suggested,&#x201D; and &#x201C;I should like you to see it, but I much fear that it would be objected to if I asked leave&#x201D; (Ireland 17&#x2013;18).
All three must have discussed it in <date when="1841-07-00">July 1841</date> on JWC&#x2019;s visit to Seaforth House. Jewsbury reported on it, <date when="1841-08-03">3 Aug. 1841</date> (Ireland 30), and by <date when="1842-06-14">14 June 1842</date> wrote, &#x201C;Our &#x2018;joint tale&#x2019; is getting on, but I fear we have neither of us the genius of hard work or making haste&#x201D; (Ireland 69). Years later JWC confused matters by telling Jeannie Welsh (who already knew) that &#x201C;long ago&#x2014;Geraldine and Mrs. P. and I were to write <hi rend="italic">a book</hi> among us in the form of letters. I told them to start it and I would take it up when I saw their scheme&#x2014;they <hi rend="italic">did</hi> send me a screed of MS. which I augured no good of, it was so <hi rend="italic">stormy</hi>&#x2014;and so I backed out of the engagement, and then Mrs. P. gave up out of indolence&#x2014;and Geraldine went on,&#x201D; and so it developed into Jewsbury&#x2019;s first novel, <hi rend="italic">Zoe, the History of Two Lives</hi> (Huxley, <hi rend="italic">JWCLF</hi> 339). At this time, <date when="1842-12-00">Dec. 1842</date>, it was unfinished, and had to be considerably altered before pbn. (with JWC&#x2019;s help) by Chapman &#x26; Hall, <date when="1845-00-00">1845</date>. JWC read and discussed <hi rend="italic">Zoe</hi>, but never &#x201C;took it up,&#x201D; and wrote none of it.</note>&#x2014;of which I am to give my opinion&#x2014;partly from a sort of <hi rend="italic">vague apprehension</hi>, partly for another reason I have not yet untied the parcel&#x2014;this other reason is, that Carlyle has also a considerable bundle of M.S. <hi rend="italic">not</hi> about Cromwell at all!&#x2014;but about that old Abbot of St Edmonds Bury!!&#x2014;which he &#x201C;rather wishes me to read and give him my views about&#x201D;&#x2014;and until I have <hi rend="italic">studied</hi> that which will be no light matter, I must abstain, for <hi rend="italic">decency&#x2019;s sake</hi> from showing any curiosity about the other literary production in which I have only a <hi rend="italic">friend&#x2019;s</hi> interest&#x2014; My Dear, tho we are not trained here as in China to &#x201C;the three-thousand punctualities&#x201D;&#x2014;we are always needing to look to our doings that we may not stumble over some nicety or other&#x2014;</p>
<p>I have heard nothing yet from Margaret Hiddlestone&#x2014;nor from M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Russel whom I wrote to at the same time<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC was thinking of replacing Helen Mitchell by Margaret Hiddlestone, though nothing was to come of it.</note>&#x2014; People in the country <hi rend="italic">do</hi> answer letters with a deliberation!&#x2014; I wish she would write, and one way or other put me out of pain&#x2014; Helen and I go on at present in the politest manner you can figure&#x2014; I never speak to her except to give her my orders and that I do with the utmost mildness&#x2014;there was so little of <hi rend="italic">passion</hi> in my last replies to her insolence&#x2014;and I have shown (whatever I may have left) such perfect indifference about her humours since that she cannot but see this quarrel is going to end <pb id="pg-15-247" n="15:247"/>differently from all our former ones  She understands herself I think to be engaged by the half year&#x2014;so that her time is not up till the <date when="1843-03-12">twelth of March</date>&#x2014;I dare say she has been already and will be before then in a variety of different humours about going or staying&#x2014;but I have lost all confidence in her&#x2014;I never can treat her again in the <hi rend="italic">friendly</hi> way in which she has been treated hitherto&#x2014;and with her <hi rend="italic">social</hi> tendencies she could not exist beside me on a <hi rend="italic">silent</hi> principle&#x2014;besides there is something very disgusting for me in the contrast between her professions and her practice&#x2014; I could forgive I think even <hi rend="italic">her</hi> outbreaks of temper in a person who regarded herself merely as my servant&#x2014;but her pretence of <hi rend="italic">loving</hi> me so <hi rend="italic">fervently</hi> and feeling such gratitude to me for saving her out of drink (as she well may!) and at the same time revealing as she does every time she gets into a rage&#x2014;a deep secret fund of rancour and spleen, gives me the idea she is but a humbug after all, and that she has staid with me so long, and made such a fuss about me more because she saw no prospect of a better place than out of affection and gratitude for <hi rend="italic">me</hi>&#x2014; I wish however she had chosen a better time for putting me to the inconvenience of changing&#x2014;which is always a horror to my unpratised mind, and especially so at present&#x2014;when I am too bilious and out of spirits to see the thing or anything without exaggerating its evils.&#x2014;</p>
<p>Did I ever tell you that M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Millner Gibson lost her <hi rend="italic">only</hi> child about two months ago&#x2014;a little girl of eight years old&#x2014; After so long she was not likely to have more children&#x2014;and with her immense fortune I thought she must feel herself the most desolate woman on earth&#x2014;I felt a more real compassion for her than I ever felt for an unknown person before&#x2014; Well&#x2014;see how one wastes ones &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">fine feelings</hi>&#x201D;! Elizabeth went to a brilliant <foreign>soiree</foreign> at Lady Morgan&#x2019;s<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sydney Morgan, b. Owenson (<date when="1783-00-00">1783</date>?&#x2013;<date when="1859-00-00">1859</date>; <ref target="volume-15/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/19234"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), Irish novelist and versifier, wife of Sir Thomas Charles Morgan (<date when="1783-00-00">1783</date>&#x2013;<date when="1843-00-00">1843</date>; <ref target="volume-15/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/19240"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>); see <ref target="volume-01/lt-18190629-TC-JOFE-01">1:184</ref>, <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400823-TC-JAC-01"><sic>12:231</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1840-08-23">23 Aug. 1830</date></corr></ref>.</note> the other evening and there sat M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> M Gibson and Elizabeth &#x201C;really saw no change in her&#x201D;!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Her da. had d. on <date when="1842-09-19">19 Sept.</date></note>&#x2014; How <hi rend="italic">do</hi> people get such griefs tumbled out of their minds in that way? Why! a cat will turn sick and go about pining for as long after its kittens have been drowned!</p>
<p>Another fact of an opposite sort I must tell you for the rehabilitation of poor human nature&#x2014; I mentioned to you the death of the old dairy-woman and that her young husband was sore afflicted by it? I saw him yesterday leaning against the lamp post at his door&#x2014;and if it had not been at <hi rend="italic">his</hi> door I should not have recognised him&#x2014;from a stout middleaged man he was become pale and emaciated <pb id="pg-15-248" n="15:248"/>and as old looking as the old wife&#x2014;a very picture of woe&#x2014;and the wife was turned of seventy&#x2014;perhaps Pepoli loves Elizabeth after all!&#x2014;but no&#x2014;it is not <hi rend="italic">in</hi> Pepoli to love any one as that Milkman-Mahomet must have loved his Kadijah</p>
<p>A letter from poor Betty&#x2014;I answered it yesterday instead of writing to you&#x2014;and you will not say I did wrong&#x2014;a letter also about Harriet from Emily Taylor<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly Betty Braid. The letter from Emily was from Tynemouth, <date when="1842-12-17">17 Dec. 1842</date>. It describes Harriet Martineau&#x2019;s new inner room and reports on her health.</note>&#x2014; I send it to Helen for her autograph collection&#x2014;but for godsake do not ask me what Books Emily Taylor has written for I always forget their names so soon as I have heard them&#x2014;</p>
<p>And now I must go and tramp thro the ocean of mud&#x2014;and with such a side! I do trust it will be some better &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">in a month</hi>&#x201D; for at present it is worse than ever</p>
<p>Helen&#x2019;s letter has come since I began writing give her my thanks and three kisses for it&#x2014;a kiss for every sheet&#x2014; Oh dear how I wish we were all together&#x2014;</p>

<p>I fancy you almost understand my instinct, without being told, how it was with me yesterday; that I did not notify the safe arrival of those affectionate presents by return of post&#x2014; I had made up the little packet for Maggie the night before&#x2014;while Carlyle was dining at the Helps&#x2019;s<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Arthur Helps (<date when="1813-00-00">1813</date>&#x2013;<date when="1875-00-00">75</date>; <ref target="volume-15/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/12876"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), at this time sec. to Lord Morpeth (see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400410-TCEMF-LLS-01"><sic>12:101</sic><corr>TCEMF to LLS, <date when="1840-04-10">10 April 1840</date></corr></ref>) and on the London Library committee; and his wife, Bessy, b. Fuller.</note>&#x2014;and the little packet for my uncle immediately after breakfast&#x2014;and I had written to poor Harriet of whom I have been rather neglectful lately<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A letter, <date when="1842-12-19">19 Dec.</date>, from Isabella Buller, from Cadwell House, nr. Torquay, Devon, where she was staying with Lady Louis, expresses the wish that JWC would come to stay, and says: &#x201C;I have had a long letter from Miss Martineau chiefly about you, &#x26; we both agree that you are killing yourself by spending all the winter in London&#x2014; You had better come to me till <date when="1843-03-00">March</date>&#x2014;&#x26; then go to Miss Martineau for the Spring months&#x2014; This is what we have arranged between us.&#x201D;</note>&#x2014;all before the Postman came&#x2014;for he was later than usual&#x2014;did not come till half after twelve&#x2014;no wonder; if many people had taken the same advantage of the post that you had done! And then, when I saw those parcels&#x2014;so like what used to be <pb id="pg-15-249" n="15:249"/>and yet not what used to be&#x2014;and read your letter so kind, and yet not from her<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Grace Welsh.</note>&#x2014;I could not help a long fit of crying&#x2014;which <hi rend="italic">you</hi> will not think an ungrateful return for your wish to make me feel myself still loved and cared for&#x2014;it is only a very narrow-hearted person that could fancy grief for what one has <hi rend="italic">lost</hi> incompatible with gladness over what one <hi rend="italic">has</hi>&#x2014; Before I had recovered myself, Carlyle came in upon me, and urged as usual that I should &#x201C;get out into the open air&#x201D;&#x2014; Oh that weary &#x201C;open air,&#x201D; which is to do all for one and does so little!&#x2014; Mazzini met me at the door, and came back with me; and so the post hour had come before I was let alone&#x2014;</p>
<p>The cushions are perfect beauties, and both have been already slept upon! indeed I began to think that Geraldine had taught you some of her <hi rend="italic">magic</hi>&#x2014;which had enabled you to make of Carlyle&#x2019;s one a sleepling talisman!&#x2014; After dinner he fell to examining it anew, and asking anew if I could not &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">open it up</hi> so as to let his head in&#x201D; for &#x201C;it would real<supplied>[l]</supplied>y make a very comfortable cap&#x201D;&#x2014;on my advising him to apply it rather to its proper use; he said &#x201C;well! how does one do with it? So?&#x2014;&#x201D; placing it at the back of his head against the green chair&#x2014;and in one moment he was fast asleep! and slept without moving a muscle for two hours!&#x2014; I was almost relieved when Helen&#x2019;s entrance with the tea-tray broke his super-natural looking repose&#x2014; I myself had in the mean while been sleeping by snatches on mine&#x2014;but never profoundly enough to get rid of the apprehension that my hair might be dirtying it!&#x2014;
Carlyle seemed really pleased with his present and letter&#x2014;repeated several times over with an air of complacency &#x201C;poor little Jeannie!&#x201D; and I dare say at that moment you wore the shawl-dressing gown to his Imagination!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-15/lt-18420816-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1842-08-16">16 Aug.</date></ref>, and <ref target="volume-15/lt-18420818-JWC-JW-01">JWC to JW, [<date when="1842-08-18">18 Aug.</date>]</ref>.</note> The beautiful little bag and handkerchief might have been an offering to Titania the fairy queen!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In <hi rend="italic">A Midsummer Night&#x2019;s Dream</hi>.</note> I never saw anything more dainty! Kiss Helen for them, with a heartiness! You are very good to me my dear <hi rend="italic">little</hi> cousins&#x2014;and that is all I can say; for I have not little Miss Adam Hunters knack at making speeches. Oh that preposterous child! I cannot get her out of my head&#x2014; &#x201C;M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle, I am enjoying myself so much! and feel so much obliged by your goodness in inviting me&#x201D;! &#x201C;Oh M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle you do speak so like my papa, it is quite a pleasure to listen to you&#x201D;! Once he was cross-questioning her about something she called &#x201C;her <hi rend="italic">Magnel&#x2019;s questions</hi>,&#x201D;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Richmal Mangnall, <hi rend="italic">Historical and Miscellaneous Questions For the Use of Young People</hi> (<date when="1800-00-00">1800</date>), usually known as <hi rend="italic">Mangnall&#x2019;s Questions</hi>, widely used schoolbook.</note> and turning to me with a look <pb id="pg-15-250" n="15:250"/>knowing enough for fifty she said &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Ah!</hi> I perceive M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle is a dreadful quiz!&#x2014;now ar&#x2019;n&#x2019;t you Sir, a great quiz?&#x201D; And remember this creature is not struck <hi rend="italic">ten</hi> yet!</p>
<p>Certainly, Jeannie, Gambardella is getting mad with success, like his favourite Masaniello,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Tommaso Aniello Masaniello (<date when="1623-00-00">1623</date>&#x2013;<date when="1647-00-00">47</date>), Neapolitan rebel against the Spanish, murdered by a mob.</note> and like him will need to be shot before long!&#x2014; Just see such a note as I have had from him! along with a book of the most distracted poems that even <hi rend="italic">this</hi> age has yet produced&#x2014;and this note<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Gambardella had written to JWC from Aigburth, Liverpool, Thurs. morning, &#x201C;sending a little work written by a friend of mine. I wish you would notice it in the Atheniaum or any other journal, writing (if only a dozen lines) just as you think it merits, for I do not ask you to do more.&#x201D; Or, he hoped, she would ask a friend: &#x201C;I know you are equal to Geraldine if not greater in the <hi rend="italic">questionable</hi> power of making your friends do whatever you fancy.&#x201D;</note> you are to bear in mind must have been sent <hi rend="italic">open</hi> to the author of the poems&#x2014;for it came to me open inside the book which was addressed in another hand&#x2014; &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">I</hi> must <hi rend="italic">wait patiently</hi>&#x201D;! and all in the imperative mood! patiently!&#x2014; Yes I shall wait with a patience never surpassed!&#x2014;except so far as my uncles picture depends on his coming&#x2014; He is a good fellow in the main&#x2014;but he <hi rend="italic">ought</hi> to learn the difference between a man and a woman&#x2014;I mean in addressing them&#x2014;</p>
<p>I have read the Seaforth novel and, as was to have been anticipated, with a feeling little short of <hi rend="italic">terror!</hi> So much power of genius rushing so recklessly into unknown space! Geraldine, in particular, shows herself here a far more profound and daring speculator than even I had fancied her. I do not believe there is a woman alive at the present day, not even George Sand herself, that could have written some of the best passages in this book&#x2014;or would have had the courage to write them if she had had the ability,&#x2014;but they must not publish it, &#x201C;decency forbids&#x201D;! (as they write at the street corners)&#x2014; I do not mean decency in the vulgar sense of the word&#x2014;even in <hi rend="italic">that</hi> sense they are not always <hi rend="italic">decent!</hi>&#x2014;but then their <hi rend="italic">indecency</hi> looks so purely <hi rend="italic">scientific</hi>, and so <hi rend="italic">essential</hi> for the full development of the story that one cannot, at least I cannot get up a feeling of outraged modesty about it&#x2014;nay I should feel as if I were the indecent person should I find anything to blush at in what <hi rend="italic">they</hi> seem to have written just <hi rend="small-caps">for facts sake</hi> without a consciousness of wrong&#x2014;but there is an indecency or want of reserve (let us call it) in the spiritual department&#x2014;and exposure of their whole minds naked as before the fall&#x2014;without so much as a fig-leaf of conformity remaining&#x2014;which no respectable public could stand&#x2014;which even the freest spirits among <pb id="pg-15-251" n="15:251"/>us would call &#x201C;coming it too strong&#x201D;!&#x2014; I wish a clear day would dawn for me that I might give them a full and faithful deliverance upon it&#x2014;for it is a difficult task they have put on me to criticize such an extraordinary jumble of sense-and-nonsense, insight beyond the stars, and blindness before their own nose!<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC wrote a criticism of the novel, for which Jewsbury thanked her in an undated letter (Ireland 145&#x2013;52). Regarding the need for fig-leaves Jewsbury told the story of an old Methodist preacher who suggested that Adam and Eve were created with &#x201C;a sort of natural white down,&#x201D; covering &#x201C;their lower limbs, &#x2026; very similar to the plush of the present day!&#x201D; &#x201C;A thousand thanks for your real kindness! Your criticism made me laugh till I was half-dead, for you little know all our strivings after decency. If you had seen the work as it was first schemed, you would have had something to complain of; indeed, it struck us that people might get scandalised. &#x2026; You don&#x2019;t know the trouble we have taken to see what would look decent at a distance. &#x2026; I shall send off your letter to Betsy [Mrs. Paulet] to-night, for she will be anxious to see it. If there be anything entertaining in the tale it is thanks to her! &#x2026; However, it wants, as you say, rewriting altogether, and it shall be done, whether or no. But do you really, in sober earnest, think it will ever do to be printed and published?&#x201D;</note> One thing I feel no doubt about that this Geraldine will either &#x2018;make a spoon or spoil a horn&#x2019;<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Proverbial.</note>&#x2014;she is far too clever to do <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> in her day and generation&#x2014;</p>
<p>Darwin heard Mazzini telling me the other day I should &#x201C;really wear a shawl in the house&#x201D;&#x2014;a <hi rend="italic">fixed</hi> idea, he has got!&#x2014; Darwin seemed quite indifferent whether I wore a shawl or even a shift, but the next time he came he brought me an immense gauze-looking shawl of white lambs wool!&#x2014;so like him, was it not?</p>
<p>I have still no letter from M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Russel&#x2014;&#x201C;<hi rend="italic">very</hi> absurd,&#x201D; as John Carlyle says&#x2014; If I do not hear in a few days I must write again&#x2014;it looks at least as if Margaret were <hi rend="italic">deliberating</hi>.<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-15/lt-18421228-JWC-JW-01">JWC to JW, [<date when="1842-12-28">28 Dec.</date>]</ref>.</note> Would she but decide to come I should consider it the best news in the world&#x2014; Helen continues most meek and civil&#x2014;but then she told me at the last outbreak that &#x201C;she could keep her distance as well as any one <hi rend="italic">if she chose</hi>&#x2014;and she would take <hi rend="italic">precious</hi> good care that I should have no fault to find with her for ever <hi rend="italic">speaking up so long as she had still to be about my house</hi>&#x201D;&#x2014; &#x201C;Do o o&#x201D;&#x2014;said I, &#x201C;that is just what is required of you&#x201D;&#x2014;so the civility may be all part of the <hi rend="italic">system</hi>&#x2014;any how it is a greater relief, than I could have fancied it, to be delivered from her eternal clack&#x2014; If it were not for thinking of the future I should find this <hi rend="italic">silent civility</hi> extremely agreeable&#x2014; I cannot say about her thinking&#x2014;certainly her temper had become <hi rend="small-caps">in the mornings</hi> just what it used to be after drink&#x2014;and Mrs Dunlop<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ann Dunlop.</note> told <pb id="pg-15-252" n="15:252"/>me a servant of hers killed herself with drink&#x2014;fairly died in her house&#x2014;without her ever having suspected her&#x2014;she took it always after they had all gone to bed&#x2014; Still I hardly think the creature has relapsed&#x2014; I never smell drink in the house or see any signs of it&#x2014; Oh prose of life!&#x2014; Oh poetry! <closer><salute>bless thee my Babbie&#x2014;</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Here is a Paper which I hope you will get exchanged for a couple of Sovereigns before Saturday, and give them to our two Namesakes, Jane and Tom,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alexander Carlyle&#x2019;s children.</note>&#x2014;from their Aunt and Uncle &#x201C;at London.&#x201D; You may safely add as many hearties good wishes, for the New year&#x2019;s season, and for all seasons, as your own heart can dictate! Good be ever with these Two, and with all that belong to you, is and must remain while life remains, your Brother&#x2019;s prayer.&#x2014; We will say also, and wish, as poor Edward Irving used to do, &#x201C;May the <hi rend="italic">worst</hi> of our years be <hi rend="italic">past</hi>.&#x201D; We have had some rather rough years, but we must not complain.&#x2014;</p>
<p>I here am in a terrible hurry; <hi rend="italic">writing</hi> daily: I hope before long to have <hi rend="italic">something</hi> ready for printing,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; not the <hi rend="italic">thing</hi> I was chiefly meaning.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Past and Present</hi>, not <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi>. On <date when="1842-12-25">25 Dec.</date> TC also made a trans. of Goethe&#x2019;s &#x201C;Symbolum,&#x201D; referred to in his letters since <date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>: see <ref target="volume-05/lt-18300831-TC-G-01"><sic>5:152&#x2013;53</sic><corr>TC to G, <date when="1830-08-31">31 Aug. 1830</date></corr></ref>.

<p><pb id="pg-15-253" n="15:253"/>A small Letter arrived from Jenny and Scotsbrig the other night; which I was very glad of. Our good Mother is reported as tolerably well; Jenny&#x2019;s presence with her is comfortable for me to think of in these winter days. I will write to my dear good Mother too before much time go.&#x2014; Jack was here last night; we had a <hi rend="italic">Poet</hi> here, a very clever man called Alfred Tennyson; and Jack, and a friend named Darwin, both admirer&#x2019;s of Alfred&#x2019;s, &#x201C;came to see.&#x201D; We had a pleasant little evening. Alfred is a right hearty talker;&#x2014;and one of the powerfullest <hi rend="italic">smokers</hi> I have ever worked along with in that department! Our Welsh Attorney<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charles Redwood.</note> had sent a leg of Welsh Mutton, unsurpassable in quality, and a magnificent but to us uneatable Goose: there was a dinner for the party,&#x2014;a party <hi rend="italic">needed</hi> for the dinner.&#x2014; Jack is in perfect order; as lively and brisk as I have seen him for a long while.</p>
<p>James Stewart of Gillenbie was here about three weeks ago: he
    had come mainly to see one Jardine,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. William Jardine, brother of David Jardine of Muirhousehead, Applegarth; pioneer of the East India Trade. He apparently recovered, as he later took his nephew Robert Jardine (<date when="1825-00-00">1825</date>&#x2013;<date when="1905-00-00">1905</date>; <ref target="volume-15/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/34159"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>) to China to work in his firm, Jardine, Matheson &#x26; Co. In <date when="1844-00-00">1844</date> he is listed as of Magniac, Jardine &#x26; Co., merchants, 3 Lombard St.</note> an enormous <foreign>Laird</foreign> from Applegarth Parish and China, and a very good man; who is understood to be dangerously ill at present.</p>
<p>I have heard nothing special about Ecclefechan or its business; but I fear in general that things <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> be going well there. Perhaps some temporary improvement is not at a great distance now. People here calculate on it as <hi rend="italic">possible</hi> that Peel may abrogate the Corn-Law this very year. The <hi rend="italic">next</hi> year is the latest date almost anybody assigns it.

<salute>Dearest</salute>
<p>If all went the right road you would receive a parcel this morning which you would not be able to make either head or tail of&#x2014; Not a line of explanation along with it! and carriage to pay for other people&#x2019;s things!&#x2014;but surely your imagination would exculpate <hi rend="italic">me</hi> from being at the bottom of such a piece of blockheadism&#x2014;altho&#x2019; my handwriting <hi rend="italic">was</hi> mixed up with it! When John dined here on Sunday he declared his intention of sending you a copy of Schiller&#x2014;and <hi rend="italic">politely</hi> suggested that if I had &#x201C;any little thing to go it might be sent along with the books.&#x201D; I thought it would be a good opportunity of returning the Seaforth manuscript&#x2014;and added the packet for Sophy<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Martin.</note>&#x2014;taking it for granted that he would pay the carriage, otherwise his <hi rend="italic">offer</hi> was a sheer <foreign><hi rend="italic">betise</hi></foreign> [absurdity]. Last night he was here again to dine with&#x2014;Alfred Tennyson! (Ah Babby what you have lost) and having a scientific curiosity to get to the bottom of that matter of rail-way carriage&#x2014;also to form some notion of what I was <hi rend="italic">indebted</hi> to him.

What was it?&#x201D; &#x201C;I never dreamt of paying the carriage? What puts it into your head I should have paid the carriage?&#x201D;&#x2014; &#x201C;Why nothing&#x2014;only that it would never have entered into <hi rend="italic">my</hi> head <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to pay it! Then did you tell Jeannie how I came to send her <hi rend="italic">my</hi> parcel?&#x201D; &#x201C;No&#x2014;I had not <hi rend="italic">a moments leisure</hi> today to write any <hi rend="italic">note</hi> along with it&#x201D;!&#x2014; In fact <pb id="pg-15-255" n="15:255"/>that man does things like nobody else even his kind actions are stript of all graciousness by the stolid way he sets about them. As to the books do not <hi rend="italic">flatter yourself</hi> they are a love-token&#x2014;he does not <hi rend="italic">love</hi> you the least bit&#x2014;loves no woman&#x2014;never did&#x2014;and never will&#x2014;not tho&#x2019; Trojan Helen should return from the Shades to tempt him&#x2014;&#x201C;Accursed vegetable that he is&#x201D;! as old Sterling said of him one day&#x2014;&#x201C;not a man at all but a walking Cabbage&#x201D;!! Indeed if he were going to dream of setting about trying to persuade himself to consider whether by possibility he could bring himself to get up a feeling of love for one of the family&#x2014;I rather think it would be for &#x201C;Miss Welsh&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jeannie&#x2019;s sister Helen.</note>&#x2014;not you&#x2014; Whenever I speak in your praise he interrupts me always with&#x2014;&#x201C;but Miss Welsh dont you think Miss Welsh is an interesting sort of person&#x201D;?&#x2014; &#x201C;Not a doubt of it Sir&#x201D;! Yesterday he never so much as asked me how I did&#x2014; On Sunday he asked &#x201C;do you continue to take the pills&#x201D;? &#x201C;Yes&#x2014;pointedly.&#x201D; &#x201C;And do you feel any better?&#x201D; &#x201C;Today I feel a little better than usual, but all the last week my side has been <hi rend="small-caps">more</hi> painful rather than less so&#x201D;&#x2014; &#x201C;Well&#x2014;in <hi rend="italic">six weeks</hi> hence or so&#x2014;they may begin perhaps to do you <hi rend="italic">some little</hi> good&#x201D;&#x2014;end of the consultation. Even Carlyle declared that night &#x201C;such indifference was entirely unjustifiable&#x201D;&#x2014;six weeks!&#x2014;next time it will be two months&#x2014;and then three&#x2014;but before then I shall have sent his pills to Beelzebub the Father of lies&#x2014; I send M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Russels letter<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1842-12-23">23 Dec.</date> in answer to JWC&#x2019;s request for Margaret Hiddlestone to replace Helen Mitchell: &#x201C;I assure you I appriciate your delicacy and disinterestedness in writing to Margaret first. She did consult me before I received your kind letter and &#x2026; I had strongly advised her to accept your offer.&#x201D; But Margaret was worried what to do with her children. Mrs. Russell also gave news of Mary Mills and about the new tenancy of Templand and walks in its garden she had had with Dr. Russell before the house was occupied: &#x201C;But <hi rend="italic">she</hi> who made that place dear to me is gone and never again can I expect to find such a warm hearted friend who was ever ready to help me in my little difficulties.</note>&#x2014;that you may judge of my prospects&#x2014; She asks me to pay her a visit&#x2014;visit <hi rend="italic">her at Thornhill!</hi> Oh dear dear!&#x2014; If that be a <hi rend="italic">possibility</hi> even; it lies yet far off!&#x2014; Helen<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mitchell.</note> I <hi rend="italic">am</hi> sure had no notion that I am thinking of supplying her place&#x2014; She is very <hi rend="italic">up-making</hi> at present&#x2014; She thinks she may part from me perhaps but never that I will be so <hi rend="italic">blind</hi> to my own interest as to part from her&#x2014; Bless you darling</p>

<salute>Dearest Babbie</salute>
<p>I absolutely have no time to write a letter today&#x2014; I am obliged to go to the post office in Sloan Street and then back again in time for the post office here&#x2014;but a word about the books&#x2014;it never entered <hi rend="italic">my</hi> head till you put it into it! that the books were <hi rend="small-caps">not</hi> a gift&#x2014; I have asked Carlyle and find it never entered his that they were <hi rend="italic">not</hi> a <hi rend="small-caps">loan</hi>&#x2014; I will ascertain on Sunday&#x2014; Blockhead of a man that he <hi rend="italic">never</hi> can make his intentions clear!&#x2014; What carriage <hi rend="italic">did</hi> you pay? I am really curious to get to the bottom of rail-way carriage&#x2014;it seems as if there was some shocking imposition in the porterage from Euston Square here which ought to be looked into&#x2014; We received some time ago meal and butter from Scotsbrig&#x2014;the carriage of which from Scotland to Euston Square&#x2014;was <hi rend="italic">four shillings and sixpence!!</hi> but then there was precisely the same amount from Euston Square to Chelsea! making in all nine shillings&#x2014;and there was no resistance of this glaring absurdity the Carrier merely said&#x2014;that the railway <hi rend="small-caps">could</hi> carry things for next to nothing but that was no reason why <hi rend="italic">he</hi> should do the same&#x2014; I will write soon meanwhile bless you my darling</p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Many thanks again for your new punctual Package of Christmas Gifts,&#x2014;supreme in their material quality, and emblematic of still more precious inner meanings! We are well pleased always to be reminded <pb id="pg-15-257" n="15:257"/>of you. The Porter arrived duly on the Sunday morning;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Christmas day.</note> and all was as right and excellent as you yourself could have wished it. Alfred Tennyson the Poet, as it chanced, lent help in doing honour to the magnificent Cambrian Goose. A fowl destined to be eaten could desire no more!&#x2014; Do you know Alfred&#x2019;s Poems? If you do not, pray get the two little volumes, and read them, especially the second.&#x2014; We send you now and always many kind thanks and wishes.</p>
<p>For a while past I have been endeavouring to work a little, in the <hi rend="italic">visible</hi> way; but it prospers very ill with me. I have enough to say: but it seems to lie as if at the centre of the Earth, and whole continents are to be torn up before it can get utterance! May the gods assist a poor worker in such case. It is difficult to speak: and yet who can hold his tongue? England, like a bleeding Gethsemane, in dumb agony, too eloquently calls on all men to speak. We shall see.</p>
<p>I often think, were the black miry Winter once done, I will fly out into the Sunshine again: the valley of Glamorgan, with mountains, rivers, seas, with a swift horse to ride, and a Friend&#x2019;s face to look upon&#x2014;is not all this inviting enough! I wish it lay 100 miles nearer; I wish I were not altogether a stranger there. My horror of strange things is great; and, alas, I am grown and ever more growing a stranger everywhere on this green Earth. My chief advantage here in this frightful smoke-chaos is that the people will <hi rend="italic">let</hi> me be a stranger without making me an enemy too.&#x2014; Once more, we shall see.</p>
<p>When you come to Town again, do not forget us. My Wife greets you with many kind wishes. Commend me to your good venerable Mother.</p>

<p>The second or concluding Portion of your <hi rend="italic">Gaberlunzie&#x2019;s Wallet</hi>,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-14/lt-18420615-TC-JBA-01">TC to <sic>JB</sic><corr>JBA</corr>, <date when="1842-06-15">15 June</date></ref>.</note> which you are kind enough to send me in a very friendly manner, has come safe to hand.

<p><pb id="pg-15-258" n="15:258"/>I have not yet had time to give the work such an examination as I purpose; but in reading here and there, it is easy to discern a fine genial open sense; much vigour, simplicity of heart (which is the only true kind of vigour or <foreign><hi rend="italic">robur</hi></foreign> [strength]); and already a light, graceful faculty of giving utterance to much of this; in short, a fine talent, which it is highly worth your while to cultivate more and more. I judge you to be still young:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >He was thirty-four.</note> what can I recommend to you but to penetrate valiantly deeper and deeper into that Inner Shrine of Things which you are on the way towards; to spare no toil, to count no costs, but press ever forward, as for the one thing needful, always attaining, never having attained! Many a fine talent, in these unprofitable days, is squandered as <hi rend="italic">furnace-ashes</hi>, which might, by faithful energy, have been smelted into an enduring <hi rend="italic">ingot</hi>. The populace of readers is very foolish; it behoves the writer himself to be wiser. He had better take less and less counsel of <hi rend="italic">them</hi>,&#x2014;and of their reviewers, and puffers and calumniators, and idle <foreign><hi rend="italic">clanjamphray</hi></foreign> [rabble] of babblers and editors and zany-prophets. He is <hi rend="italic">their</hi> leader; and ought to ride them, as a man does long-eared quadrupeds, not whither they want to go, but whither <hi rend="italic">he</hi> wishes, and judges it wiser to go; the quadrupeds themselves will be grateful to him at last,&#x2014;that he has <hi rend="italic">not</hi> ridden with them &#x201C;over steep places&#x201D; down into Seas of Tiberias,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Like the Gadarene swine, Matt. 8:32.</note> but far elsewhither!</p>
<p>In a word, I will commit you to your own Good Genius (which is whatsoever of Wisdom and Truth a man has in him); and bid you listen reverently to its smallest whisper, deaf mostly to other noises&#x2014;</p>

<salute>My dear M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Cunningham</salute>
<p>When the man came to take the barrel the other day, I had no time to write a note with it. I proposed to myself however to call on you forthwith and explain the meaning of such a <hi rend="italic">prosaical</hi> looking new-years gift. But first the rain and then the cold have kept me <pb id="pg-15-259" n="15:259"/>within doors ever since. and today when it <hi rend="italic">is</hi> possible for me to go out I am obliged to turn my steps toward Knightsbridge. Nobody knows what tomorrow may bring forth; so I will not put off any longer explaining to you that these potatoes are part of a very abundant supply which my Uncle sent us out of Lancashire, knowing that we can never supply ourselves to our mind in London&#x2014; Indeed for several winters back we have ourselves <hi rend="italic">imported</hi> potatoes out of fife: to the infinite dissatisfaction of our greengrocer who cannot comprehend such difficulty of taste! These Lancashire potatoes when <hi rend="italic">boiled with the skins on</hi> meet with our entire approbatation&#x2014;and fancying that you as a <hi rend="italic">Scotchwoman</hi> may have like ourselves <hi rend="italic">better sense</hi> about the article than the people here, and having plenty to spare, I thought I could not do better than send you one of the barrels&#x2014;</p>
<p>I will see you I hope in a few days and then you will fix with me <hi rend="italic">when</hi> you will fulfil your promise</p>
<closer><salute>Ever affectionately yours /</salute></closer>
