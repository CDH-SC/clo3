<salute>Dearest Babbie</salute>
<p>These subterranean<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >I.e., the kitchen.</note> troubles of yours really get to be beyond all phases of human condolence! It is time (as Mazzini says) to <hi rend="italic">act!</hi> And so I have been <hi rend="italic">acting</hi> in your interest&#x2014;and now it remains for Helen<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Welsh.</note> to decide whether I am to go on acting or hold my hand. You say what would I advise? I would advise that by all efforts and at all sacrifices you should <hi rend="italic">break the spell</hi> which is over your subterranean!&#x2014;merely hoping that it will <hi rend="italic">wear itself out</hi> seems to be idle.</p>
<p>My own kitchen department was for a short period after I came to London under that same sort of Devils blessing&#x2014; One or two servants turned off in quick succession had given the house what they call <hi rend="italic">a bad name,</hi> which was the more easily fixed upon it we being then regarded as &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">foreigners</hi>&#x201D; in the neighbourhood&#x2014;&#x201C;<hi rend="italic">dis</hi>honourable women not a few&#x201D; waylaid my servant as often as she went an errand, questioned her as to her eating and drinking, suggested ammendments, wondered she should consent to <hi rend="italic">wash</hi>&#x2014;to do this that and the other&#x2014;explained to her that we could not be a <hi rend="italic">genteel</hi> family since we kept only <hi rend="italic">one</hi> servant &#x26;c &#x26;c&#x2014;and the woman was sent home <hi rend="italic">primed</hi> for mischief exploded on the first fault&#x2014;finding word that was said to her, or <hi rend="italic">provoked</hi> a quarrel&#x2014;then gave warning&#x2014;and a new one had to be sought who went thro the same phenomena.</p>
<p>One girl&#x2014;irish, not a bad creature but very violent and unreasonable gave me warning in the first week because &#x201C;she could not remain in a house where there were no waterpipes&#x201D;! she wondered how anybody could expect a servant to stay beside such an inconvenience&#x201D;!! I told her to depart then by all means the following week by which time I should have found a substitute&#x2014;and when her day for departure arrived she was as sorry as possible,&#x2014;told me that her giving warning had been &#x201C;all along of the neighbourhood putting her up to it&#x2014;that now she had seen more of the place she liked both the place and the people, and that if her successor went before she got another place she wished I would take her back and give her another trial. This completely convinced me of what I had already often felt persuaded&#x2014;viz: the mischievous tendency of <hi rend="italic">monthly</hi> engagements&#x2014;if a servant may <pb id="pg-18-4" n="18:4"/>fly off at a tangent whenever she likes she yields to the first momentary disatisfaction or apprehension which <hi rend="italic">every</hi> place under the sun is likely to occasion her plenty of just in the first days&#x2014;before she has attached herself in any way either to the family or her duties. So I had a servant sent me out of Annandale<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The first was the Irish Roman Catholic woman, <date when="1835-08-00">Aug.</date>&#x2013;<date when="1835-09-00">Sept. 1835</date> (see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350800-JWC-JCA-01"><sic>8:195</sic><corr>JWC to JCA, <date when="1835-08-13">13 Aug. 1835</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-08/lt-18351223-JWC-MAC-01"><sic>276</sic><corr>JWC to MAC, <date when="1835-12-23">23 Dec. 1835</date></corr></ref>), followed by Ann Cook (see vols. 8 and 9).</note> hired on the Scotch principle of having to stay six months&#x2014;and so <hi rend="italic">broke the spell</hi> in my own case. The creature was neither a good woman nor a good servant but she was better than eternal changing&#x2014; With no other friend here except myself and no money to carry her back to Scotland, and <hi rend="italic">engaged</hi> for six months she could not choose but <hi rend="italic">stay</hi> and make the best of it&#x2014;and by the time the <hi rend="italic">first month</hi> was over she had animal sense enough to feel that her place was a good place whatever the neighbours might say of it, and I also feeling that I was bound to her for half a year had to make the best of it, in training her to what she did not know and putting up with many little disagreeables, the consequence of all which was that she stayed here for eighteen months and had at last to be sent back to Scotland by <foreign><hi rend="italic">vive force</hi></foreign> <note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380909-JWC-TC-01"><sic>10:170</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1838-09-09">9 Sept. 1838</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014;so unwilling was she with all her faults to part from me! Helen<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mitchell.</note> would herself have been <hi rend="italic">off</hi> in the <hi rend="italic">first month</hi> had she not been tied for six&#x2014;and here has she been now for seven or eight years <hi rend="italic">on the whole</hi> for all our occasional squabblements a great temporal blessing to me&#x2014;and if she were to go tomorrow <hi rend="italic">the place</hi> would now have an excellent <hi rend="italic">name</hi>.</p>
<p>Pondering on all this when I had read your last letter I decided that you should really adopt the same strong measure and bring some one from a distance&#x2014;hired for a reasonable term&#x2014;and in a manner <hi rend="italic">dependent</hi> on making good her time with you. Of course where there are <hi rend="italic">three</hi>&#x2014;there is a complicacy in this measure, unless the one brought as a regenerating element into the concern had some principle to begin with they<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> others might corrupt her even to the extent of inducing her to go away in the teeth of her own interest but with so many plain reasons for staying there would be needed an immense amount of folly in the creature to let herself be so misled&#x2014;and with one tolerable fixture you might hope to leaven by degrees the whole lump into a state of tolerable fixidity! And now to descend from the theoretical to the practical I know of a servant at this moment whom I myself would feel no hesitation in hiring on a similar speculation</p>
<p>Some months ago Countess Pepoli applied to me to seek a place for <pb id="pg-18-5" n="18:5"/>a young scotch proteg&#xE9;e of hers whose simple honest face had quite won her heart&#x2014; This girl is about four and twenty to appearance&#x2014;she had been for a year&#x2014;or two years I forget which servant to Count Sartorio (jump jump) in Glasgow and had been exceedingly content with his service&#x2014;but Sartorio&#x2019;s affairs having gone wrong in Glasgow thro his imprudent benevolence in setting up a countryman of his own and wife in a Cook-shop<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Margaret and Count Sartorio not further identified. A Charles Santiero, 28 Queen St., was listed under confectioners and pastry bakers, Glasgow P. O. guide, <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>&#x2013;<date when="1843-00-00">43</date>, and possibly Sartorio is JWC&#x2019;s miswriting of Santiero.</note>&#x2014;the poor old fellow had to renounce &#x201C;Jump jumping&#x201D; there any more, disperse his household and come back to try his luck <hi rend="italic">in the Quadrant</hi> This Margaret went into another place in Glasgow but not being so well off in it as with old Sartorio she conceived the adventurous project of coming up to London sure that, if she were on the ground without expense to him, her former Master would take her back. And up she came accordingly. But Sartorio had no longer a house only a lodging&#x2014;and had hardly enough to keep his own soul and body together never to speak of a servants soul and body&#x2014;and so he fetched her to Countess Pepoli to solicit her patronage for the girl who felt ashamed to go back to Glasgow and confess that she had gone on a goose chase&#x2014; Elizabeth was so pleased with her scotchness that she took her up at once and has been charging herself with her ever since&#x2014; Sartorio gave her the best of characters for honesty, good conduct in all respects, and ability in doing all <hi rend="italic">his</hi> work&#x2014; Some weeks ago after various temporary arrangements Elizabeth found her a very promising looking situation thro the recommendation of a decent woman with whom Miss Fergus<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jessie.</note> lodges when she comes to visit Elizabeth&#x2014;just at the bottom of Elizabeths garden&#x2014; The family consisted of a Lady and Gentleman&#x2014;it was a pretty genteel looking house and the girl was to be their single servant&#x2014;all went charmingly for a while&#x2014;but a week ago the girl came to Elizabeth&#x2014;and desired to speak with her <hi rend="italic">without the Count</hi><note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >I.e., without Count Pepoli.</note>&#x2014;and then informed her that she was finally persuaded she had got into an <hi rend="italic">improper</hi> house! a Lady had lately come to stay with her Mistress who went out finely dressed every night at nine o&#x2019;clock and did not return till far on in the morning&#x2014; &#x2014;and the Mistress of the house was not married to the gentleman who staid with her&#x2014;but was in the habit of sleeping with another gentleman who came after dark, and was let in by herself (<hi rend="italic">the Lady&#x2019;s</hi> self)!&#x2014; The girl said she was extremely sorry for all this because the place was excellent in every other respect the Lady most <pb id="pg-18-6" n="18:6"/>kind to her, and so far as herself was concerned no improper word or action took place&#x2014;but &#x201C;she thought that suspecting how it was it would be very wrong in her to remain&#x201D;&#x2014; This spoke much for the girls morality&#x2014; You may fancy knowing Elizabeth her <hi rend="italic">comical</hi> consternation in finding that her zealous atempts to protect and provide this girl had been crowned with such success&#x2014;as placing her in a bad house!&#x2014; She was neither able to eat nor sleep during the days that the girl remained after this communication&#x2014;for she could not but agree that the Lady having used her so well she ought to give her time to find a successor&#x2014;last Saturday Margaret finally came forth immaculate as she went in&#x2014;and now Elizabeth is partly recovered. &#x2014; After receiving your letter I rushed off to Elizabeth&#x2019;s to see <hi rend="italic">where she was at</hi> with this girl who it immediately occurred to me might be an excellent person for <hi rend="italic">you</hi> to break your spell with&#x2014; I had not seen her myself but meant to&#x2014;before saying anything about it&#x2014; Elizabeth was gone to town &#x201C;with the Count&#x201D;&#x2014;I left a message and yesterday the girl Margaret came to me at ten in the morning with a letter from Elizabeth She has quite the good honest <hi rend="italic">scotch</hi> look which Elizabeth praised in her and if I myself wanted a servant at this moment I would hire her&#x2014; That is all I can say&#x2014; She expressed the utmost readiness to go to Liverpool or anywhere that she could find a decent situation Seemed a very attachable simple hearted creature who would do whatever she was set to as well as she could and understand when she was well used&#x2014;not <hi rend="italic">sheepish</hi> by any means&#x2014;but at the same time very modest&#x2014; She had done <hi rend="italic">all things</hi> about a house cooked waited and housemaid&#x2014;did not consider herself at all likely to excell in any one of these branches at the present but felt no fear but she would learn all that it was required of her in a week or two if she were told&#x2014; Now it is for Helen to decide whether there might not be a good reward lying in virtue of <hi rend="italic">training this girl</hi>&#x2014;a little patience and botheration would suffice for it&#x2014;and a little kindness I think would attach her to you beyond the risk of evil influences from without&#x2014;especially as I should warn her well on that head before sending her off&#x2014; If you decide on the adventure tell me what wages you give&#x2014;what she would be required to do&#x2014;for how long she would be held engaged&#x2014;and all other necessary particulars&#x2014;as to expences&#x2014;the way I settle with that for myself&#x2014;was to pay the whole (in the cheapest principle) in the first instance then if the servant left at the end of the first six months that one half should be repaid from her wages&#x2014;if she staid longer there should be no demand on her. The half of the expences is neither here nor there to oneself but it is an additional consideration for her in retaining her place.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-18-7" n="18:7"/>I told the Girl to return here on Thursday afternoon&#x2014;and I would then be able to tell her the result of my negociation&#x2014;</p>
<p>If you dislike the idea it is of no moment my having given her a false hope for I know of a place for her here&#x2014;to console her with&#x2014; Only I shall try to keep her disengaged till I know your decision So you must write either tomorrow or Wednesday that I may know what to do before she comes on Thursday&#x2014;</p>
<p>You see what pens I have&#x2014;and may figure the confusion of my head from the immensity of writing which it has taken to tell my short and simple story your dear little impatient letter is come since I began writing this&#x2014;but I will not say anything of myself to day being already quite weary&#x2014;besides having much to do&#x2014;</p>
<p>God bless you my darling&#x2014; <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi> is very anxious you should try this scotch girl&#x2014;if <hi rend="italic">that</hi> be any recommendation.</p>

<salute>Dear Emerson,</salute>
<p>Till within five minutes of the limit of my time, I had forgotten that this was the third of the Month;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mail packets for America sailed on the fourth and eighteenth of the month.</note> that I had a Letter to write acknowledging even money! Take the acknowledgement, given in all haste, not without a gratitude that will last longer: the 36 pounds and odd shillings came safe in your Letter; a new unlooked-for Gift.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson sent with his letter, <date when="1844-02-29">29 Feb.</date>, a bill of exchange for &#xa3;36, &#x201C;the sum of two recent payments of Munroe &#x26; of Little &#x26; Brown, whereof I do not despair you shall yet have some account in booksellers figures.&#x201D;</note> America, I think, is like an amiable family teapot; you think it is all out long since, and lo, the valuable implement yields you another cup, and another! Many thanks to <hi rend="italic">you,</hi> who are the heart of America to me.</p>
<p>Republishing for one&#x2019;s friend&#x2019;s sake, I find on consulting my Bookseller, is out here; we have Pirates waiting for every American thing of mark, as you have for every British: to the tender mercies of these, on both sides, I fancy the business must be committed. They do good too; as all does, even carrion: they send you <hi rend="italic">faster</hi> abroad, if the world have any use for you;&#x2014;oftenest it only thinks it has. Your <hi rend="italic">Essays</hi>, the Pirated <hi rend="italic">Essays</hi> make an ugly yellow tatter of a Pamphlet price 1/6; but the edition is all sold, I understand: and even Nickisson has not entirely ceased to sell. The same Pirate who pounced upon you made <pb id="pg-18-8" n="18:8"/>an attempt the other day on my poor <hi rend="italic">Life of Schiller,</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly Taylor &#x26; Walton (see <ref target="volume-17/lt-18440321-TC-TAW-01">TC to <sic>T&#x26;W</sic><corr>TAW</corr>, <date when="1844-03-21">21 March</date></ref>), but no publication of Emerson&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Essays</hi> by them has been traced. Possibly William Smith, who had pbd. both the <hi rend="italic">Essays</hi> at 2s. (see <ref target="volume-17/lt-18431031-TC-RWE-01">TC to RWE, <date when="1843-10-31">31 Oct. 1843</date></ref>) and <hi rend="italic">Nature: an Essay. And Orations</hi> at 1s.6d., had also approached TC about his <hi rend="italic">Life of Schiller</hi> either directly or via Taylor &#x26; Walton.</note> but I put the due spoke in his wheel. They have sent me <hi rend="italic">Lowell&#x2019;s Poems;</hi> they are bringing out <hi rend="italic">Jean Paul&#x2019;s Life</hi> &#x26;c &#x26;c; the hungry <hi rend="italic">canaille</hi> [scoundrels]. It is strange that men should feel themselves so entirely at liberty to steal, simply because there is no gallows to hang them for doing it.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> (Cambridge, Mass., <date when="1844-00-00">1844</date>) by James Russell Lowell (<date when="1819-00-00">1819</date>&#x2013;<date when="1891-00-00">91</date>), American poet, essayist, and diplomat, were pbd. in an authorized edn. by G. E. Mudie in <date when="1844-03-00">March</date>, presumably the one sent to TC. John Chapman&#x2019;s and Routledge&#x2019;s edns. of the <hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> in <date when="1844-00-00">1844</date> were apparently both piracies.</note>&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; Your new Book will be eagerly waited for by that class of persons; and also by another class which is daily increasing here.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Chapman pbd. <hi rend="italic">Essays, Second Series,</hi> with an intro. by TC, in <date when="1844-11-00">Nov.</date></note></p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Last night your servant delivered me the Book.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Poems &#x2026; of Schiller</hi>. Lytton had given TC another copy for Varnhagen, who had given advice (in a letter, <date when="1844-02-04">4 Feb.</date>) about a line in Schiller&#x2019;s &#x201C;Fantasie an Laura,&#x201D; about which Lytton had asked TC; see H. G. Fiedler, <hi rend="italic">MLR</hi> 38 (<date when="1943-00-00">1943</date>):35.</note> As we do not yet meet according to my hope, I feel impelled to write, what there is no opportunity of speaking, a more special word of thanks for my Schiller,&#x2014;which is more properly yours and the world&#x2019;s. I did read it on the night appointed, and with very great pleasure. It is many a day since I saw so glowing, hearty and altogether vivid, sympathetic and poetic a Biography of a Man; pity that we had not a hundred such to read! For Biography, I imagine after all, is the real summary of &#x201C;Poetry&#x201D;; from <hi rend="italic">Homer&#x2019;s Odyssey</hi> to the <hi rend="italic">Gospel of St Matthew</hi> the grand and truly important writings we have are all &#x201C;Biographies&#x201D; spoken or sung!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lytton replied, on his return to town, [<date when="1844-04-00">mid-April</date>?], that he hoped TC would have his <hi rend="italic">Life of Schiller</hi> rptd: &#x201C;I agree with you entirely on &#x2018;Biography.&#x2019; &#x2026; It conveys History, thro&#x2019; practical forms.&#x2014; The difference between History &#x26; Biography is chiefly made by throwing in the <hi rend="italic">Affections</hi>. &#x2026; Higher &#x26; more enduring emotions within as by the death of Nelson than by all the carnage of the Great War&#x2014;that modern Iliad which emerges from that modern myth the French Revolution.&#x201D; He wanted TC to write about the Revolution&#x2019;s influences on literature: &#x201C;I think they have been great, tho not visible on the surface. Literature has become less apart&#x2014;more social&#x2014; It is only since the french revolution that we have had works grave &#x26; gay&#x2014;light &#x26; ponderous&#x2014;inquiring &#x26; investigating the social ills around them.&#x201D;</note> Again I wish we had a hundred such done in as good a way as this. Many thanks to you, in my own name and that of a multitude of others.</p>
<p>Since you heard of me last, I think there have been but <hi rend="italic">two</hi> exceptions from my rule as to three o&#x2019;clock: it was especially unlucky that the very first exception should have been the day when you were so kind as call here. At Hertford Street<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >36a, where Lytton lived.</note> my luck was no better,&#x2014;could be no better, so late am I always. I hope there are other days coming. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Non omnes occiderunt soles</hi></foreign> [Not all suns will set]; that is the universal Gospel in this Place of Hope.</p>

<p>I am sitting here awaiting Lord Jeffrey who came to town yesterday&#x2014;he may be here in five minutes or not for a couple of hours&#x2014;anyhow I may as well be turning my hand with the fleeting moments as they pass&#x2014;tho&#x2019; under the circumstances you are likely to find me &#x201C;very much detached&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>
<p>Often in these weeks I have had <hi rend="italic">accesses</hi> of Carlyles mania for &#x201C;a house in some perfect solitude&#x201D; (only <hi rend="italic">not</hi> Craigenputtoch): there are so many interruptions to fritter away one&#x2019;s time in this no 5 Cheyne Row that my serious conscience begins to protest against them&#x2014; &#x201C;When the Devil was sick, the Devil a Monk would be&#x2014; The Devil got well and the Devil a monk was he.&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Rabelais, <hi rend="italic">Gargantua and Pantagruel</hi> 4.24, trans.

He bade me send it first to <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, thinking you would more certainly forward it to Scotsbrig without delay than Scotsbrig would to you. I write to my Mother <pb id="pg-18-14" n="18:14"/>today that it is coming; so lose not a post. Alick seems well poor fellow; and is going to Canada, which also is good.</p>
<p>Your Letter with the Leathers arrived; thanks for both: the leathers will do nicely;&#x2014;Jane saw at a glance that you had made them.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jean Aitken wrote, <date when="1844-03-25">25 March</date>: &#x201C;I have got the little articles &#x26; hope they may do; tho&#x2019; I could have wished them neater in the stitching. If they are not right I know of another person <hi rend="italic">now</hi> that will make better ones. &#x2026; I have kept the pattern drawing.&#x201D;</note> We are glad also that the Books &#x26;c have got to hand.

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>This is to be no Letter, this is a mere word of something new. Jack today got a Letter from Alick; it is gone to Jean who is to send it on, without loss of a post, to Scotsbrig; we thought this might be the shortest way;&#x2014;you will probably receive the Letter <hi rend="italic">along</hi> with this <pb id="pg-18-15" n="18:15"/>(if you do not call every day); at all events it will come the day after this. Alick is very well; busy packing his things again; just about to start <hi rend="italic">for Canada</hi> and brother John, which I think will satisfy us all fully better. The Clows were going away West, and part of them gone.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alexander Carlyle&#x2019;s son Thomas recorded in his journal that the Clows went W to Illinois, where they bought 1,300 acres of unbroken land 30 mi. W of Chicago. As for his own family, &#x201C;we moved northward into Canada, hiring teams to take us from Sodus Bay to Carthage &#x2026; , now named Charlotte, and sailed from there (mouth of the Genesee River), to Toronto and on to Hamilton, or rather Wellington Square, Burlington Bay being full of ice. We hired a waggon and driver, and leaving our boxes for the nonce, reached Uncle John&#x2019;s place before night. The roads were horrible, just breaking up in the Spring thaws. Father and I often walked to case the horses somewhat. Here we lived for six weeks, making excursions all round in search of farms for sale, mother once or twice accompanying&#x201D; (quoted Marrs 588).</note></p>
<p>Our Scotsbrig ware is actually <hi rend="italic">grand</hi>; we have gone thro&#x2019; the fresh butter, eaten the fowls long ago; fastened on the hams, which really are of excellent quality! I wish all meritorious persons had the like.&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; Jean says she sends you a hen or two out of Dumfries; I must really charge Jenny and her with that service. Jenny I conclude is now with you; which I am glad of. Tell her the shirts fit capitally, except a fresh button on the collar (which certain of them need, the new-fashioned kind, which are rounded off on the wristbands) none of them wants anything. I will write to herself some day. I am in everybody&#x2019;s debt for Letters.&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>
<p>My other writing is a <hi rend="italic">little</hi> livelier now. Jane is tolerably well; and the weather is beautiful, soft as silk. My dear Mother, what kind of a Letter is this! Commend me affectionately to Jenny to Isabella and all of them. <closer><salute>Ever your son</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Many thanks for your visit to Marston and your Letter about. I suppose we shall never get to <hi rend="italic">understand</hi> that unfortunate Battle; but every intelligent survey and testimony is a contribution towards that. I have read all the wretched old bewildering narrations over again; I find the truest, or perhaps the true one, to be that in the Cromwelliana if well studied.&#x2014; A modern account by W. Hutton (<hi rend="italic">visit to Coatham</hi> in <date when="1810-00-00">1810</date>) is as full of blunders nearly as of statements; the old man is to be believed about modern aspects of the ground, nothing more.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Hutton (<date when="1723-00-00">1723</date>&#x2013;<date when="1815-00-00">1815</date>), topographer, author of <hi rend="italic">A Trip to Coatham</hi> (Birmingham, <date when="1810-00-00">1810</date>), with a portrait of Hutton in his eighty-first year. Coatham is on the extreme NE Yorkshire coast.</note></p>
<p>Can Wilsthorpe Wood ever have been called <hi rend="italic">Gortrey Wood?</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Wilsthorpe Wood, just NW of the center of Marston Moor, where the royalist forces placed their baggage. See Peter Young, <hi rend="italic">Marston Moor</hi> (Kineton, <date when="1970-00-00">1970</date>), 210&#x2013;69, for various contemporary accounts. Gortrey Wood is Galtres Forest, NW of York, across the river Ouse.</note> That would explain a variety of things for me. In &#x201C;Gortrey Wood,&#x201D; Prince Rupert&#x2019;s Army quartered the night before; only a few of them were ever in York. The trees in Wilsthorp wood says old Hutton have bullets buried in them. I wish still you would make some inquiry about Gortrey (or Gortree) where it is, if not at Wilsthorp.</p>
<p>The Battle was certainly in &#x201C;the fields where the bullets are found <pb id="pg-18-18" n="18:18"/>thickest,&#x201D; not in the Wood at all,&#x2014;except the last gasp of the royalists&#x2019; retreating foot, who might (as Hutton says they did) seek shelter there. I suppose it is somewhere near the wood, or in it, that the Graves of the Slain lie? Your Letter &#x201C;G.&#x201D; is not to be found on your Plan; after long looking, I conclude it has gone off with the wax.</p>
<p>Perhaps before writing <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;Marston&#x201D;</hi> (if Alas I ever get to write it), I may get a glimpse of the ground myself. But indeed there is a limit to all things, and too much trouble is as foolish as too little,&#x2014;and a thing I am more liable to for most part.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> TC made no use of this information, stating that he &#x201C;must leave the reader to gather details in the sources listed below&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 6:187).</note></p>
<p>Did you ever apply for the Yarmouth Cromwell Letter?<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >One probably owned by Dawson Turner of Gt. Yarmouth.</note> If you have any difficulty, pray forbear; I can get at the thing by another course. Perhaps you could ask the owner what exact <hi rend="italic">Date and Address</hi> it has: my notion is I have either already seen it, or could otherwise see it.</p>
<p>I have got no horse, and am still in considerable, and perhaps in growing want of one. The botheration and expense of the thing both deter me. We shall see by and by. My taste in a horse is exactly yours, yours also my knowledge. I sometimes think of getting some strong animal that could run in a cab too, and then giving it to my Wife in winter, for the seas of <hi rend="italic">mud</hi> on all our raging highways at that season make a riding horse rather a nuisance to have charge of.</p>
<p>There is no haste about either Gortree or the Yarmouth Letter; tho&#x2019; at present I am working rather on that side of the subject, you are <hi rend="italic">too</hi> likely to be in time enough!</p>
<p><closer><salute>With many thanks for the trouble you have taken, and the insight you have given me,</salute></closer></p>

<p>My dear! I would have given something considerable that you had been here last Sunday Morning to have seen Plattnauers face&#x2014;while a much more fiery trial was appointed him than that of having to <hi rend="italic">wash his hands</hi> before Ladies&#x2014; While we were sitting very peaceably together Lord Jeffrey and M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Empson were announced&#x2014;I sprang up delighted of course to see Jeffrey who had not warned me <hi rend="italic">this time</hi> of his being come back to town&#x2014; As it was not our first meeting however&#x2014;and I had kissed him sufficiently when he came ten days ago&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">I</hi> was not thinking of going thro <hi rend="italic">that</hi> ceremony&#x2014;but <hi rend="italic">he</hi> having a strong natural tendency for <hi rend="italic">cuddling</hi> people (without the slightest earthly harm in it) and taking advantage of his being now near seventy years of age to indulge this <hi rend="italic">innocent</hi> taste to the fullest extent, took me all in his arms <hi rend="italic">as usual</hi>&#x2014;regardless of the presence of Plattnauer, Empson, and <hi rend="italic">Helen</hi> (as indeed he would have done the same before twenty starched Dowagers) and gave me one kiss after another, not &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">on the brow</hi>&#x201D; or any of those delicate spots, but <hi rend="italic">plump on my lips!</hi>&#x2014;calling me &#x201C;my darling Jeanie!&#x2014;my sweet Child! my dear Love&#x201D;!!! and then when we had got over <hi rend="italic">the brunt</hi> of the business and set down on the sofa he ceased not a moment from kissing my hands, stroking my hair, patting my face&#x2014;and saying the tenderest things in the tenderest tones! Now all this was nothing at all for Empson, or myself, or <pb id="pg-18-22" n="18:22"/>anyone that knows Jeffrey&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">ways</hi>&#x2014;and that knows <hi rend="italic">his age</hi>&#x2014;and that knows the sort of <hi rend="italic">Paternal</hi> affection he has entertained for me upwards of fifteen years. But if you will just look at it with Plattnauers eyes! My attention was attracted towards him by his <hi rend="italic">convulsive</hi> snatching up of a newspaper&#x2014;over which he stooped his head, blushing&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;! oh merciful heaven <hi rend="italic">how</hi> he was blushing the poor young man!&#x2014; He seemed only to sit witnessing such superhuman indecorums from the total inability into which his astonishment threw him of going away!&#x2014; At last he <hi rend="italic">reeled</hi> accross the floor and bade me good morning with a look &#x201C;significative of much&#x201D;! I have since heard that he went from here to Elizabeth to compliment her on the extraordinary character of <hi rend="italic">Scotch Salutations</hi> as illustrated in the meeting he had just witnessed betwixt Lord Jeffrey and M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle,&#x2014;Elizabeth begged him for god-sake &#x201C;not to take the practices of Lord Jeffrey and M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle as a specimen of <hi rend="italic">the national manner</hi>&#x201D;&#x2014;but said she &#x201C;I tried to comfort him by the assurance that Lord Jeffrey was 70 which he would not however believe for <hi rend="italic">he</hi> was quite <hi rend="italic">struck with his handsomeness&#x201D;!!!</hi> certainly if he had got <hi rend="italic">that view of the subject</hi> the procedure was perfectly awful! &#x201C;This minds me&#x201D; M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Fraser came here on Sunday evening to tell me that an attempt was made by her husbands advocate to get a new trial!! on the plea that the Verdict had been given on false grounds&#x2014;she did not suspect a new trial would be granted him but the bare idea of such a thing was troubling the poor soul dreadfully Moreover her husband had been seen leaning against the gate of her own garden lately after midnight!&#x2014;was he &#x201C;meaning to shoot her&#x201D;? or merely to &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">get round her by</hi> fair words?&#x201D; she did not know but was equaly terrified either way! I wish some philanthropic Individual would shoot <hi rend="italic">him</hi> or &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">get round</hi>&#x201D; him with <hi rend="italic">a halter</hi>.</p>
<p>I always forgot to tell you that Gambardella called on me one day when I was out&#x2014;Helen said he was on horseback and in great spirits he left a message that he could not come again as he was to set out for Paris the next day but one&#x2014; He had been here some ten days then as I heard thro Pepoli who had met him on the street&#x2014; Poor fellow&#x2014;it is a pity that he has no steadfastness to turn his fine talent to account&#x2014; &#x201C;unstable as water he shall not prevail&#x201D;<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf.

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I have read your letter with sympathy and interest, as the letter of a sincere seeker, one of those enquirers of whom it is written that they &#x201C;shall find.&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Matt. 7:7 and elsewhere.</note> Believe in this issue: for it is true, far true than you at present think. We are led by strange ways in this world, the harshest disappointments often proving to be furtherances in disguise; generally too the goal we, in our young ignorance, have in view is not exactly the one we were appointed for, not the <hi rend="italic">true</hi> goal. The true goal shows itself by and by, if we do faithfully struggle towards what truest-working goal there is. You must persist, with courage, with patience, with humility and openness of mind, with whatever of <hi rend="italic">strength</hi> in any kind is in you! Persist, and know beforehand that no honest labour is or can be in vain.</p>
<p>Neither must health altogether discourage you. All men have their limits on the side of physical strength, as on other sides; thinking souls, which are first of all keen-feeling sensitive souls, are very apt to wear the clay they lodge in into holes! But great work has been done, and has still to be done, with but a slender outfit of health. This palpitating heart,&#x2014;you had better ask a Doctor concerning it; perhaps it is nothing but <hi rend="italic">indigestion,</hi>&#x2014;a fierce enemy to intellectual men, but one that can be understood, that can be dealt with. Above all things, try <pb id="pg-18-24" n="18:24"/>to ascertain gradually for yourself where the limits of your 
strength do lie, and to work wisely within these, not unwisely struggle to surpass them: you will find that there is still good room for work if a man can be wise! And, in fine, be of hope. It is a wild battle this life of ours: but there is an Eternal Captain over it, unless we are all mistaken!</p>
<p>&#x201C;Work, and despair not,&#x201D; says one. Not a soldier of us but has his name in the Army Office, not a ball but has its billet.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Attrib. to William of Orange (<date when="1650-00-00">1650</date>&#x2013;<date when="1702-00-00">1702</date>).</note></p>
<p>I am kept in extreme hurry here, but cannot forbear to write you this word. <closer><salute>With sincere wishes and good expectations so far as I discern,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>We got Jenny&#x2019;s short letter which gave us great satisfaction. I have nothing to report except that we here also are tolerably well; I am very busy too: but it seems a pity not to scribble a word <hi rend="italic">often,</hi> now when they can go so freely.</p>
<p>You have been too frequently ill this spring, my dear Mother; you really must take more pains with yourself! Let me beg Jenny too to be in all ways careful of you. Alas, what can I do? I am far off, and cannot be of help to you myself, which I would so gladly be. Surely it is well the part of one and all of us to do for our good true Mother whatsoever we can: she did faithfully for us what lay in her, while the time was!&#x2014; Jean tells me she has sent you out a fowl or two; I have earnestly urged her to continue that: a little soup and <hi rend="italic">wheat</hi> bread for dinner would certainly be much wholesomer than what you usually dine on. Besides the good weather is now come; that, of itself, will be a great relief to you. Go up to the moor on a sunny day; the sight of the bonny world growing green again will be like a sermon to your pious heart; as indeed such a heart can nowhere want for sermons,&#x2014;the stars in the Heavens and the little bluebells by the wayside alike shew forth the handiworks of Him who is Almighty, who is All-good. In a bad weak world, what would become of us, did not our hearts understand at all times that this is even so.&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>
<p><pb id="pg-18-25" n="18:25"/>I struggle away here, not always in the successfullest manner; yet trying always to make some progress in my work: &#x201C;many a little makes a <foreign>mickle</foreign> [much].&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Proverbial.</note> It will be a long <foreign><hi rend="italic">dreigh</hi></foreign> [tedious] and weary job; but I must plod along, keep chopping on, and hope to get thro&#x2019; it in time. My health is not to be complained of; I should study well to husband what strength is given me, not fret (as I too often do) over what is denied me. Jane too gets better in the bright weather. All is bright here, sunny and full of blossoms: out of our back windows there is an aspect of trimmed gardens, blooming fruit-trees, a whole sea of white blossoms, that almost hides the houses, and is really pleasant to behold. I smoke a pipe there in the evenings, with many reflexions at times. The smoke and stour of huge London lies as if safe in the distance, the westwind blowing it wholly away from <hi rend="italic">us;</hi> only the spires of Westminster Abbey, and the gilt cross of St Paul&#x2019;s glittering four miles off, attract one&#x2019;s eye there.&#x2014; I study to go out to dinner as little as possible; and write refusals to the right and left. Dinners will do nothing for me; only the getting on with my Book will do something! From this season of the year, the racket that there is in the west end of London, all manner of persons gathering into it, gets louder and louder.</p>
<p>Poor John Sterling has had a dreadful fit of illness; burst a blood-vessel in the lungs: within an inch of death, the Doctors say. He is now thought out of risk for the present; tho&#x2019; like to be at best, for years to come, in a precarious way. Jeffrey is here, also in poorish health; but much better than he was.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jeffrey was seriously ill with bronchial trouble, which struck him after his visit to JWC, <date when="1844-04-21">Sun., 21 April</date>, and he was in bed for nearly a fortnight, though recovering by
<date when="1844-05-09">9 May</date> (Henry Cockburn, <hi rend="italic">Life of Lord Jeffrey</hi> [Edinburgh, <date when="1852-00-00">1852</date>] 2:386).</note> He is nearly of your age; but grows no more serious as he grows older,&#x2014;at least he thinks it proper to affect the same light ways: to me not the beautifullest in an old man.</p>
<p>Here is a Letter from a poor Glasgow Youth,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Peacock.</note> which has affected me: I wrote him a word of encouragement this morning.&#x2014; I am going to call for Jack in my way up to Town. He is well; not fitted yet with <hi rend="italic">work,</hi> but able to go on pretty well without. <closer><salute>I send thanks and kind regards to Jenny, to Isabella, Jamie and them all,&#x2014;designing to write again soon. <foreign>Adieu</foreign> dear Mother</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Procter,</salute>
<p>Thanks for your pretty little volume,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">English Songs and Other Small Poems,</hi> new edn. In his pref., <date when="1844-04-13">13 April</date>, Procter said that he had cut out about forty poems &#x201C;of inferior quality&#x201D; and added about seventy &#x201C;besides a considerable quantity of Dramatic Verse.&#x201D;</note> and your kind Note; both of which are right welcome to me. I am already far on with the Songs; several of them have been long known to me: <hi rend="italic">Our Neighbour&#x2019;s Health,</hi> for example, came to hand thro&#x2019; the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> last winter,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, <date when="1843-12-23">23 Dec. 1843</date>.</note> and has stuck, with a curious fascination, ever since. A just thought, which is itself a bit of Harmony, does deserve and demand to be wedded to its due tune, its due &#x201C;verse,&#x201D; and to make itself and that &#x201C;immortal.&#x201D; I wish I too had been trained to <hi rend="italic">sing:</hi> it would have been a mighty solacement to me now and then!</p>
<p>Fulfil your good purposes as to the Drama. The Writer of <hi rend="italic">Mirandola</hi>,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Procter, <hi rend="italic">Mirandola: a Tragedy</hi> (<date when="1821-00-00">1821</date>).</note> tho&#x2019; he now sniffs at that composition, cannot be without dramatic talent. Nay a man to whom a thing does look musical and glorious will not fail to bring it out in something of Music and Glory (that is, of Poetry, as I understand it), thro&#x2019; the Drama, or <hi rend="italic">whatever</hi> way he try it. There is a Grecian Beauty traceable, we are told, in the shape of the Walls of Tiryns,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Prehistoric citadel in Greece.</note> which are built of mere dry boulders, without the aid even of a hammer. What I object to in our <hi rend="italic">damnable</hi> Dramatists is, that they have in them no <hi rend="italic">thing,</hi> no Event or Character, that looks musical and glo<supplied>[r]</supplied>ious to them,&#x2014;properly no Thing at all, but an empty pruriency and desire to <hi rend="italic">have</hi> a Thing: how can that escape damnation!&#x2014; Persist, Persist. You know what Place is paved with &#x201C;good resolutions&#x201D;!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hell.</note> The labour is great, but is not the reward also something? Persist, persist!</p>

<salute>My dear Spedding,</salute>
<p>I am very glad to hear the sound of your friendly voice again,&#x2014;or to see this image of it, transmitted me by the aid of Cadmus and Rowland Hill.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In Greek mythology Cadmus introduced the alphabet into Greece.

<p>What prospect I have of coming to the North? I am afraid no certain one at present; I have got deep into the abysmal quagmires, and must try to deliver myself a little, before I can go anywhither! Last year I wandered about for three months or more, and returned home sicklier and stupider than ever; in fact, these short escapes into the free air, seem only to derange me out of the known routine of my dust element,&#x2014;to which, like the salamander to his fire, one gradually gets accustomed: I believe it would take me two years of country to do me any real good. My nearest duty is clearly to get my hands washed of this unspeakable Cromwell concern; and then, if any haven open, to run as for life. I am very sick, feel worse in health this summer than I ever did; but on the whole there is no help for me in running away. I believe I ought to get a horse, and perhaps shall; but this also requires more effort than I have disposable for that side of my affairs at present. I must get done with this accursed Task of mine, and deliver myself from the Torpedos! No subject in this world, I believe, is a more unmanageable one. The heroic Age of England, verily such, and treated hitherto with a depth of stupidity that even England elsewhere cannot try to parallel. O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, that killest the Prophets!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Matt. 23:37.</note>&#x2014; In fact, that is the last time practical men in this country ever did attempt heartily to go upon the fact that they <hi rend="italic">had</hi> an Eternity lying before them; an Infinite Splendour and Terror (what they called an Almighty Just God) encircling this little Life-islet of theirs:&#x2014;it is most grand to see; and men cannot otherwise, I think, lead their life in a manlike manner at all, but must lead it in a more or less beastlike manner, and end in Peels, Russells, tin Champions of England,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For the tin Champion of England, see <hi rend="italic">Past and Present, Works</hi> 10:140.</note> and the other phenomena too well known to us! My intolerance against the shovelhatted quacks who succeeded poor Oliver, and hung his body on the gallows, and danced round it saying &#x201C;Aha, aha! Glory to <pb id="pg-18-28" n="18:28"/>Nell Gwynn and the <hi rend="italic">new</hi> improved Defender!&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >After the Restoration Cromwell was disinterred from his tomb in Westminister Abbey and his body hung on a gallows, <date when="1661-00-00">1661</date>. The actress Eleanor (Nell) Gwyn (<date when="1650-00-00">1650</date>&#x2013;<date when="1687-00-00">87</date>) was mistress to Charles II, who returned to the throne as &#x201C;Defender of the Faith.&#x201D;</note>&#x2014;is difficult to repress within just limits. I believe no Book will ever be made of this unfortunate thing; but some way or other I must be rid of it, or die of torpor and despair. Coroner&#x2019;s verdict: Died by the visitation of Human Stupidity (his own and that of two preceding centuries) in almost all its forms!</p>
<p>Poor Peel! He is actually getting into the waters; his boat, rocking, will not lie steady in the ooze any more; and God alone knows where the <hi rend="italic">other</hi> shore of the voyage may be!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >At the time, most pressing on Peel were agitation for repeal of the Corn Laws and the new factory bill (debated again <date when="1844-04-26">26 April</date>); see <ref target="volume-17/lt-18440330-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1844-03-30">30 March</date></ref>.</note> The thought of it often fills me with a real terror.

<p><salute><hi rend="small-caps">My dear Mary</hi>,&#x2014;</salute>We seldom hear directly of you and it is a long while since you have had an express word from any of our hands here. You are not to suppose that we forget you on that account. Far enough from that! You are many times in my thoughts. I fancy you and James struggling along in your diligent, industrious way, struggling to fight your battles in these bad times, and from the bottom of my heart I affectionately bid you God Speed. Struggle away, my dear sister. We must so struggle and we must not be beaten. Assure yourself always that I am not less brother-like in heart towards you than in old days when you saw me oftener and heard from me oftener. <pb id="pg-18-29" n="18:29"/>Today I send you a little slip of paper which will turn into a sovereign when you present it at the Annan Post Office and sign your name &#x201C;Mary Austin&#x201D;&#x2014;from me &#x201C;at Chelsea.&#x201D; If you be not there yourself, James can sign for you if you sign it first, but the thing is in no haste and will lie till you go. Buy yourself a bit of a bonnet or anything you like with the piece of money and wear it with my blessing, sometimes thinking of us here.</p>
<p>No doubt you hear duly about us. You have heard I suppose how Alick is gone over to Canada, to our brother there, not into the deep Western regions of America with Clow, which Canada arrangement of Alick&#x2019;s we like better than the other. It seems to me Alick may do well there now. He will get a piece of land and every year that he tills it faithfully it will be growing better for him.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alexander Carlyle later wrote: &#x201C;My Father &#x2026; soon went himself over into Canada. &#x2026; He chose a farm there, near Brantford in the Province of Canada West (now called Ontario), and came back to take us all over to our Canadian home. It had a dwelling-house on the public road running through Brantford (five miles off) from Hamilton to London, the farm extended to the usual there, of about 100 acres (doubled in later years); &#x26; the earliest thing I can remember was my helping, or pretending to help my Father in ploughing; I toddled before him in the furrow which the plough was making, holding one of the cross bars which connect the handles, he close behind me guiding the plough! I must have been only three or four years old then&#x201D; (MS: NLS 739).</note> Labour is labour, not joyful but heavy and sore in any part of this world, but if a person see any fruit of his labour it is always an encouragement to him.</p>
<p>Our dear old Mother seems to have been rather weaklier this last winter than heretofore. Jack had a letter yesterday from Jennie at Scotsbrig which represents her as being pretty well at present. I think Jenny should stay much with her and look after her. Good old Mother&#x2014;the spring weather will grow gradually into steady summer and then she will have a better time of it, we may hope.</p>
<p>Jack was here last night. He talks of going North to &#x201C;the country,&#x201D; probably toward Annandale, before long, but his movements are very uncertain. He has not yet any fixed employment here and would be much better if he had. He does not seem to like medicine and is hovering among a great variety of things. We always hope he will fix himself on some specific object by and bye. As for me I am very busy but making very bad progress. I have nothing for it but to <hi rend="italic">bore</hi> along mole-like; I shall get out some time or other. Our spring wind has turned round tempestuously into the North of late and brought cold and dust, with the glare of sunshine, not so pleasant to the invalid part of us. Jane, however, is tolerably well and growing stronger as the sun grows. She sends her old love to you and kind remembrances. <pb id="pg-18-30" n="18:30"/><closer><salute>Give my regards to James&#x2014;he must be planting his potatoes now.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Probably Jack may write to you today; but it was not quite indisputably fixed between us, to my remembrance, at our last meeting: therefore, lest you should be short of a Letter altogether by this mail, I will scribble you a word;&#x2014;better are repetitions in this case than no tidings at all!</p>
<p>We duly got your Letter announcing that you were just about to move off for a trial of Canada. The news was most welcome to one and all of us. We had got no favourable notion of those deep western Countries: aguish, swampy, hot, far-distant regions, the scene of diseases, &#x2018;shinplaster banks,&#x2019;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Shinplasters were small paper notes used as money, issued without legal security on private responsibility, very few of which were ever redeemed. They abounded during the panic of <date when="1837-00-00">1837</date> in the U.S. TC wrote in his Journal, <date when="1844-05-08">8 May</date>: &#x201C;News from Brother Alick pretty regularly every month. He has chosen Canada at last; we do not yet hear what specially is the place he has got. He seems to wear a good aspect of mind, and we can hope some moderate prosperity for him, poor fellow.&#x201D;</note> uncertainties, sorrows and confusions! Better that you did not venture thither. Canada too you will no doubt find a place of difficulties, of drawbacks,&#x2014;what place on this Earth is not such? But you are nearer hand in all senses; you are among people of your own blood and kin: you know much better what you are about there. On the whole, if you can avoid getting an unhealthy place, I do not otherwise care much what place it is. If it be a favourable fertile place, you will have less extent of it for your money; if you get a large place, it must needs be that it is <hi rend="italic">un</hi>favourable. On the whole we wish you to be settled &#x201C;on a healthy place of your own&#x201D;; that is all the length our wishes have light to go. A piece of God&#x2019;s earth committed to your own free charge; it is a real blessing for a man that lives by tilling of the soil! Were it ugly as sin, every stroke of good labour you bestow on it, will make the place beautifuller;&#x2014;what &#x201C;beauty&#x201D; is there in Fairyland itself compared with the aspect of Order produced out of Disorder by one&#x2019;s own faithful toil? That is the real beauty that will make a man feel some reconcilement to his ugly lot, however ugly <pb id="pg-18-31" n="18:31"/>it look. Next Letter, or some Letter soon, we hope to address you in some <foreign><hi rend="italic">hadding</hi></foreign> [holding] of your own! It will be as a little spot of light for us in that dim Continent. We will think always of our brave Alick struggling manfully along there; and bid with our whole hearts the Heavenly Powers be favourable to him. Courage; courage, my Brother: perhaps the worst of our days <hi rend="italic">are</hi> over; and calmer and better days are coming!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Nothing new has taken place here since you heard last. Our dear old Mother is still reported to be in her usual health; or rather I should say, is again so reported;&#x2014;for she has had, I think, rather a sickly winter of it, and has been a degree oftener ailing than was her wont: the warm summer will now help her:&#x2014;alas, we cannot have our brave old Mother always; it is the saddest thought I have in this world, the sternest to accustom myself to! Already I seem almost to have as good as lost her: it is but a few times, and then in sickliness, unnameable dispiritment, embarrassment, that I can hope to see her in this world.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC wrote in his Journal, <date when="1844-05-08">8 May</date>: &#x201C;My dear old Mother has, I doubt, been often poorly this winter; they report her &#x2018;well&#x2019; at present: but alas! There is nothing in all the Earth so stern to me as that constantly advancing Inevitability,&#x2014;which indeed has horrified me all my days.&#x201D;</note> Why do I awaken these feelings in you? Surely you are farther gone from her than I! My dear Brother, we must look to a Higher than aught earthly for comfort in such matters. God is above us; surely there is no love in our hearts that He has not made,&#x2014;our holiest affections, surely with them too He will do what is wise, what is good and best!</p>
<p>Jenny has gone over to Scotsbrig after a considerable absence at Gill; she reports Jamie as being rather unwell, with some influenza or the like, I suppose; he is &#x201C;busy sowing&#x201D; too. At Dumfries, at Gill, all things go on as heretofore; except that Jamie Aitken, I think, has abandoned Thornhill, having found his man there not trustworthy, and the trouble of the thing greater than its profit.&#x2014; Jack, still here, begins to talk now of &#x201C;going to the country somewhere,&#x201D; probably to Annandale when he first stirs. But he has not stirred yet. He is terribly in want of employment, I believe; but shews hitherto little increase of symptoms of fixing on any. Years ago, I have ceased to speak with him on that subject, poor fellow, having in truth no a<supplied>[uthor]</supplied>ity in it, no power to throw light on it. I am often heartily sorry for h<supplied>[im, liv]</supplied>ing &#x201C;in lodgings,&#x201D; with a grey head, which he has not where to lay otherwise: one is angry that he cannot with these excellent talents and means take to work; but on the whole he cannot, there is something that prevents him, his hard fortune is <hi rend="italic">such</hi>. You need not say anything <pb id="pg-18-32" n="18:32"/>about all this; for it does but provoke him, and that serves no purpose, and less than none.</p>
<p>As for myself I make very bad progress, the work is so chaotic, unimaginably confused, and I am so bilious, irregular in sleep &#x26;c &#x26;c: however I do get a little under way of late, and hope to struggle out the Book yet by and by. A piece of it is now fairly written,&#x2014;thank Heaven: the first stone is more than half the building, when you have such quagmires to <hi rend="italic">found</hi> in! All goes well with me otherwise: indeed nothing can go ill; I keep out of the way of all men and things, so far as possible, except this one thing; and feel that the whole world cannot much help me or much hinder me.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC wrote in his Journal, <date when="1844-05-08">8 May</date>: &#x201C;My progress in <hi rend="italic">&#x2018;Cromwell&#x2019;</hi> is frightful! I am no day absolutely idle; but the confusions that lie in my way require far more energy than I can muster on most days, and I sit, not so much working as painfully looking at work. A thousand times I have regretted that this task was ever taken up. My heart was never <hi rend="italic">rightly</hi> in it; my conscience it rather was that drove me on. My chief motive now is a more and more burning desire to have <hi rend="italic">done</hi> with it. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Eheu, eheu!</hi></foreign> I am very weak in health too; I am oftenest very sad. The figure of Age, of greyhaired weakness, twilight and the inevitable Night never came on me so forcibly as this year. Age is sad, yet it is noble after a sort; the advance of it upon one is a peculiar tragedy, new for every new life. Words are weak in general to express what I feel. Then art thou verily growing <hi rend="italic">old</hi>; old, and thou hast never been <hi rend="italic">young!</hi> And thy life has amounted to <hi rend="italic">this</hi> poor paltriness, and, &#x26;c &#x26;c&#x2014;there is no wisdom in writing such thoughts, or even in more than partially entertaining them. The Future alone belongs to us; let us doubly and trebly struggle to profit by that, turn that to double and treble account.&#x2014; O heavens, get on with thy Cromwell!&#x201D;</note> Jane is growing strong as the sun grows. She sends you all her affectionate wishes. When once you have a <hi rend="italic">place</hi>, we must get up a Box and have it shipped for you with odd things;&#x2014;it will shew that we are far <hi rend="italic">nearer</hi> one another than you or we fancy; nearer than London &#x26; Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> once were.</p>
<p>Dear Brother, the sheet is done; no room for more! You will give my kind wishes to Jenny and the <foreign>Bairns</foreign>, my affectionate regards to them all. Poor little Jane, poor little Tom; say I expect to hear that they shew themselves good stuff in that new country. They will not disgrace the <hi rend="italic">gang</hi>, I should hope?&#x2014; Remember me also, in all affection to our Brother John and his Peggy. It will be a comfort to us to hear that you are near one another. I saw a Letter from Clow to Graham of Burnswark; I suppose he is far over the Mountains by this time.&#x2014; <closer><salute>God bless you, my dear Brother; may all Good be ever with you.

<salute>Sir,</salute>
<p>May I beg of you to return, in some fit way, my very grateful acknowledgements to the Gentlemen of the Common Council and of the Library Subcommittee for the handsome and liberal permission they have given me, in reference to the City records and my historical inquiries connected therewith.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-17/lt-18440213-TC-HAM-01">TC to HAM, <date when="1844-02-13">16 [13] Feb.</date></ref></note></p>
<p>Of this valuable permission I hope to make due use by and by; and in the meanwhile there remains with me, and must remain, an altogether pleasant sense of the courtesy with which I have been treated by these Gentlemen, by yourself and by all parties, in this business.</p>

<p><salute><hi rend="small-caps">My Dear Sir</hi>,&#x2014;</salute> Several weeks ago I received a very pleasant letter from you which has never yet been in any way acknowledged. Nothing can exceed the hurry one is kept in here. I prefer writing you even this much to absolute silence, which, in some bad hour, you might interpret otherwise.</p>
<p>My interview with you in Edinburgh remains very clear and very pleasant.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-17/lt-18430912-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1843-09-12">12 Sept. 1843</date></ref>.</note> The sight of your face, of your indomitable laughing eyes, gives new assurance; your whole way of life seemed to me of good augury. With thews and sinews such as these, a man who will walk along steadfastly, regardless of the weather and wayside provocations, is sure enough to make some handsome journey of it. Right good speed to you! My best wishes go with you always; and if there be at any time any help or service I can lend you, fear not to ask it. With many kind regards and good hopes, and begging you to remember me affectionately to the Gordons,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John and Isabel.</note>&#x2014;<closer><salute>I am, in great haste, yours always truly,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I have received your Garland of the Rhine (<hi rend="italic">Rosary</hi> of the Rhine),<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Apparently unpbd., like so many of Chorley&#x2019;s poems.</note> and the very kind Letter that accompanied it; for both of which I return you many thanks. The Sonnets are of exquisite finish, complete according to the hard Law of Sonnet; and give me, as thro&#x2019; narrow elaborate fourteen-sided-chinks, a pleasant glimpse into many high and wide expanses of things. I have read them all with interest. This, from one who is not only no friend to the Sonnet, but rather a declared enemy to it, and never read even a Sonnet of Milton or of Petrarch without some consciencious protest as he went on,&#x2014;seems to signify some thing!</p>
<p>In fact, my dear Sir, you must permit me this opportunity of saying that I will by no means let you off for Sonnet-work: you are fit for far <pb id="pg-18-35" n="18:35"/>other enterprises; and you shall not rest without doing them! This is a fact; and really you should lay it to heart. I speak often with your Brother<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henry Fothergill. TC wrote in his Journal, <date when="1844-05-08">8 May</date>, about a visit to Henry, <date when="1844-05-07">7 May</date>, when he &#x201C;saw William Howit and his wife Mary with their daughter, for the first time: Present being my Wife and me, Browning, Miss Chorley, H. Chorley our Amphytrion, and the Howits. A couple of respectable burgherly people; Ex-Quakers, that, if one take in all the meanings of it, is a tolerably complete definition of them. Howit is a little firmset man, of perhaps 55, very bald, entirely hoary, with large irregularly spherical head, sharp lively not illnatured-looking eyes, small firm mouth, small alert cock-nose; speaks with a considerable accent, opinions of an English Liberal Burgher and Dissenter, frank, modest, inoffensive&#x2014;an Ex-Quaker in fact. Mary has bland anxious eyes, a good touch of the &#x2018;benevolences&#x2019; &#x26;c; her upperteeth projecting to a marked extent complete the character of physiognomy. Browning helped to make our little party cheerful; Chorley himself was a good landlord: the thing, terminating early, went off with very fair effect; we walked slowly home before ten, sick but content.&#x201D; William Howitt (<date when="1792-00-00">1792</date>&#x2013;<date when="1879-00-00">1879</date>; <ref target="volume-18/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/13998"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), misc. writer individually and jointly with Mary, m. <date when="1821-00-00">1821</date>; their eldest da., Anna Mary Howitt (<date when="1824-00-00">1824</date>&#x2013;<date when="1884-00-00">84</date>), m., <date when="1859-00-00">1859</date>, Alfred Alaric Watts. The family had lived in Heidelberg, <date when="1840-00-00">1840</date>&#x2013;<date when="1843-00-00">43</date>, and was now in Clapton, London.</note> on that subject; we are both agreed that few men in England are hiding such a gift and opportunity so sedulously under a napkin as even the criminal John Chorley now does;&#x2014;and we hope he will at least grow more and more <hi rend="italic">miserable</hi> till he be forced to unfold it. Miserable, I say; for how can a man be other with a talent hid in a napkin? The &#x201C;Wife of Ballinacrazy&#x201D; was good; but a hidden talent is worth ten of her for &#x201C;keeping a man <hi rend="italic">unasy&#x201D;;</hi> you may depend upon that, and look for the consequences.</p>
<p>Seriously, I do wish, and counsel, that you would write me and the world a good broad Book on some subject that the world is vitally interested in,&#x2014;illuminate for me and the world something that <hi rend="italic">is</hi>, and that is at present dark and chaotic: why is a man gifted with insight, with veracity and energy of mind, with leisure and opportunity of fortune, if <hi rend="italic">not</hi> simply for the like of this? Your watch tower, where <hi rend="italic">you</hi> now sit, commands an extensive enough horizon, within the compass of which lie great things, dark enough, confused enough, crying very impressively in their <hi rend="italic">dumb</hi> way, &#x201C;Let there come light on us!&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Gen. 1:3.</note>&#x2014; Nay, it is too bad!</p>
<p>If I were Spiritual Archbishop, for example, I would <hi rend="italic">order</hi> you to do it; I would say, why don&#x2019;t you give us a right <hi rend="italic">epic</hi> History of Lancashire for instance? There is not a bigger baby born of Time in these late centuries; and I would fain have him christened in some way! He is staggering about, a dumb piece of Savagery hitherto; plenty of sense in his <hi rend="italic">eyes</hi>, but tongue-tied; really needs that the Articulate Speakers come about him, give some account of him!&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; In good truth, I could fancy a most beautiful Poem, written in plain historical prose; the title <pb id="pg-18-36" n="18:36"/>of which should be <hi rend="italic">Lancashire for the last two centuries</hi>. Start with the Siege of Manchester in Cromwell&#x2019;s time; end with the Anti-Corn-law league in Peel&#x2019;s! There were five good years of work for you; and a Book at the end of them, of which there is no model yet.&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;Well, at all events, I will thank you for what you have already done, I will send my friendliest regards to your good Mother, to your Brother in Wales;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jane and William Brownsword.</note> and beg you always to be assured of my very hearty good wishes and great esteem. <closer><salute>Sincerely yours,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Forster,</salute>
<p>I cannot anywhere rake up that unfortunate Document you gave me about the last hours of Cromwell;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> TC relies heavily on [Charles Harvey?], <hi rend="italic">A Collection of Several Passages concerning H. late Highnesse Oliver Cromwell in the Times of his Sickness. &#x2026; Written by one that was then Groom of his Bed-chamber</hi> (<date when="1659-00-00">1659</date>); noted in <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 9:197.</note> and I cannot do without it! From what Book could it come? I have six or seven accounts of the Protector&#x2019;s exit; and no one of these is it. If you cannot, from the depths of your memory, fish up some trace of it, what is to become of me! Do make a haul or two with the likeliest implements you have.</p>
<p>A certain Diary of a Lady Willoughby of Parham (or D&#x2019;Eresby I know not which) will probably come to you, from the Longmans who advertise it.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Advertised by Longmans in the <hi rend="italic">Athenaeum</hi>, <date when="1844-04-27">27 April</date>, as pbd. <date when="1844-04-29">29 April</date> and printed &#x201C;in the style of the period,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">So much of the Diary of Lady Willoughby as relates to her Domestic History, &#x26; to the Eventful Period of the Reign of Charles the First (<date when="1635-00-00">1635</date>&#x2013;<date when="1648-00-00">48</date>)</hi>. This was a fictitious diary, recognized as such by reviewers in the <hi rend="italic">Athenaeum</hi>, <date when="1844-05-25">25 May</date>, and <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, <date when="1844-06-01">1 June</date>, but accepted as genuine by others; it was acknowledged in the third edn., <date when="1845-00-00">1845</date>, to be by Hannah Mary Rathbone (<date when="1798-00-00">1798</date>&#x2013;<date when="1878-00-00">1878</date>; <ref target="volume-18/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/23158"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), who wrote a sequel (<date when="1847-00-00">1847</date>) carrying the narrative down to the Restoration. The putative author of the diary was Elizabeth, b. Cecil (d. <date when="1661-00-00">1661</date>), wife of Francis Willoughby (<date when="1613-00-00">1613</date>&#x2013;<date when="1666-00-00">66</date>), 5th Baron Willoughby of Parham.</note> Having once finished it, could you let me next have a sight of it? If she is the Parham her Book, tho&#x2019; the fullest vapid wash a<supplied>[s]</supplied> most of these Books are, may contain a thing or two.</p>

<p>My life for some days back has been &#x201C;as good as a play&#x201D; (to use <hi rend="italic">Mrs Macready&#x2019;s</hi> favourite simile) or one might even compare it to a novel by M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Crow<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Catherine Crowe, b.

But when I saw the figure he was I could scarcely swallow down a scream. He looked <hi rend="italic">bigger</hi> than ever&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">blown up</hi> in fact,&#x2014;his grizzled hair hung horrible about his head like a mop,&#x2014;his face, hands, and clothes were in the last stage of dirtiness&#x2014;his shirt all open in the breast disclosed &#x201C;what shall I say? strange things upon <hi rend="italic">my</hi> honour,&#x201D;&#x2014;and the rolling of his eyes clearly indicated him to be as mad as a march hare!&#x2014; I concealed my dismay as well as I could and bade him sit down and began asking him the usual questions. If his look had frightened me his speech frightened me still more&#x2014; &#x201C;He had discovered a <hi rend="italic">nest of murderers</hi> in the court where he lived, he knew of <hi rend="italic">twelve</hi> who had been murdered by them&#x2014;&#x201C;it was quite a Burking business&#x201D;&#x2014;he had heard the screams of a woman in the night, had looked from his window and seen the murderers, <hi rend="italic">of whom his Landlord was the chief</hi>, hide the dead body in a dilapidated house&#x2014; there were blood stains on the floor next morning and in spite of all this the Authorities would not enquire into it&#x2014;disbelieved his word&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">his</hi>&#x2014;damnation! He who in his own country <pb id="pg-18-38" n="18:38"/>had fought <hi rend="italic">twenty five duels</hi> to preserve his honour from stain (that&#x2019;s a fact) was to be insulted with impunity by the English&#x2014;no by God&#x2014; he had sworn to be revenged&#x2014;the blood of the whole english nation should wash out his disgrace! (pleasant talking!) Henceforth he was the deadly foe of every Englishman!&#x2014; &#x201C;Well said I trying to seem unconcerned tho&#x2019; my eyes were intently watching his least <hi rend="italic">movement&#x2014;&#x201C;I</hi> am not an <hi rend="italic">Englishman</hi>, but a <hi rend="italic">Scotch-woman</hi>, so you need not look so furious at <hi rend="italic">me</hi>&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;I have done for Mazzini however&#x201D; said he&#x2014;and that is so far good&#x201D;!!! Then suddenly turning on me the most benevolent eyes in the world he said with a quite <hi rend="italic">paternal</hi> tenderness &#x201C;you look <hi rend="italic">better</hi> than when I saw you last! a <hi rend="italic">little</hi> better, but always pale&#x201D;!&#x2014; No wonder that I was pale just then!&#x2014;and then the tears rushed over his face and he turned his face quite away from me as if I were awakening some consciousness in him which he could not endure&#x2014;after half an hour of the <hi rend="italic">bloodiest</hi> talk during which I had the fortitude <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to send for Carlyle&#x2014;his mad fury seeming to have <hi rend="italic">men</hi> rather than <hi rend="italic">women</hi> for its object&#x2014;and my heart really quaking at what might happen if I brought a <hi rend="italic">Man</hi> to my rescue) he rose and stalked to the door&#x2014;there he stopt and held out his hand to me turning his head in the opposite direction&#x2014;I gave him my hand boldly&#x2014;which I had soon reason to repent for he <hi rend="italic">crushed</hi> it in his as if he <hi rend="italic">meant</hi> to reduce it to a jelly. I screamed and fell half fainting over his arm&#x2014;and tho&#x2019; I cried several times Oh for Gods sake! he held it at least a minute in this horrible grasp. When he quitted it I held it up all red and swelled&#x2014; He looked at it for a moment with a devilish satisfaction&#x2014;then his expression suddenly changing he said kindly &#x201C;Oh you are hurt&#x2014;Well I am sorry&#x2014; but <hi rend="small-caps">it was necessary</hi>&#x201D;!&#x2014;then he walked slowly away&#x2014; Heaven preserve me from any more such <hi rend="italic">necessities!</hi> My hand could <hi rend="italic">take no hold</hi> of anything for many hours after and it is not quite right yet&#x2014;</p>
<p>He had not been gone ten minutes when Mazzini came to show that he had not been &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">done for</hi>&#x201D; in the worst sense of the words&#x2014;and while we were still gravely discussing poor Garnier State and consulting what could be done for him&#x2014;in the way of discovering his Mother&#x2014;or getting him put up before he does any mischief which he is in the fair of&#x2014;Old Sterling came and finding M. here and something <hi rend="italic">grave</hi> going on betwixt us <hi rend="small-caps">he</hi> was seized with a fit of &#x201C;temporary <hi rend="italic">insanity</hi>&#x201D; in which he permitted himself to utter <hi rend="italic">an impertinence</hi>, whereupon my humour being already jarred I told him that he was an old fool and had better get about his business&#x2014;not exactly <hi rend="italic">in</hi> <hi rend="small-caps">these</hi> <hi rend="italic">words</hi>, but that was the purport&#x2014; So with a look which Mazzini said was like that of a wild beast&#x2014; I was not heeding for my part how he <pb id="pg-18-39" n="18:39"/>looked&#x2014; he started up and took what was intended to sound&#x2014;as an everlasting farewell!</p>
<p>&#x201C;Will he ever come back&#x201D;? said M&#x2014; as the door was slamed behind the irritated John<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC wrote &#x201C;John&#x201D; for &#x201C;Edward.&#x201D;</note>&#x2014;&#x201C;Yes said I the day after tomorrow at furthest&#x2014;he will rage out today&#x2014;sulk tomorrow&#x2014;and come back on his knees (figuratively speaking) the day after&#x2014;and so it was&#x2014;or rather he did better for he sent me the carriage yesterday with a touching message that he was too ill to write or go out&#x2014;but sent me the carriage for my own use&#x2014;of course I sent it back again unused&#x2014;for I do not forgive him all at once in these cases and besides when it came&#x2014;Plattnauer was here.</p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I am sorry the rigorous general rule took effect in your case today.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Against admitting morning visitors.</note></p>
<p>If you have a Letter of <hi rend="italic">Oliver Cromwell&#x2019;s</hi>,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cromwell to his son Richard, <date when="1656-05-25">25 May 1656</date> (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 8:253&#x2013;54).</note> and will give me an exact copy of it, date and address especially exact,&#x2014;it will be a real favour done me. Most of Oliver&#x2019;s Letters have been printed; but some also I still find hidden in Manuscript Collections: I am very sedulously collecting all that I can find of him anywhere;&#x2014;few things in English History seem to me better worth preserving and elucidating.</p>
<p>If it were not too much trouble, might I ask you to be so helpful as send me a Copy of this Letter by the post? I shall then know whether it is already printed anywhere, and what farther investigation it may require. The date and the address are, of course, particularly important.&#x2014; To see yourself, a descendent of Heroes,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Field&#x2019;s grandmother Anne, elder half-sister of Oliver Cromwell (<date when="1742-00-00">1742</date>&#x2013;<date when="1821-00-00">1821</date>) of Cheshunt, was the great grand-da. of Henry Cromwell. Possibly his cousins, the Russells, had told him about TC&#x2019;s search for Cromwell&#x2019;s letters.</note> and a doer of kindness to me, will be a new pleasure,&#x2014;any day between two and three.</p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I have felt myself to owe you a bit of a Letter for this week past; and I must pay it now, let the time be convenient or not. There never comes any &#x201C;convenient time,&#x201D;&#x2014;unless one seek it!</p>
<p>My labour goes on here in such a confused unsuccessful way, I really have no free time almost; and no news to write except that monotonous continuance of &#x201C;getting badly on,&#x201D; which is not worth writing, except to my dear Mother only.&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; But after all I should not say my work is getting on so badly; upon the whole all work <hi rend="italic">will</hi> get on exactly according to the quality of the work itself. If it be right good work, its result, seen or unseen, will also be good. There is not a doubt of it! My ill success is but this, that I have got a quagmire to build a house upon; and many a good cartload of stones, when laid on the &#x201C;<foreign>peat-pot</foreign> [hole from which peat has been dug]&#x201D; never so gently, has sunk out of sight,&#x2014;and <hi rend="italic">seemed</hi> to all men to be lost! There must be <hi rend="italic">more</hi> stones, and ever more, carted in, till the &#x201C;<foreign>pot</foreign>&#x201D; do at last get a little solid under one!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Besides Jenny&#x2019;s Letter to myself, John showed me one of hers to him; and yesterday I had a Note from Jean who had seen you lately. You are not well, dear Mother, and have not been well; Jean strives to assure me that you are getting to your usual strength again;&#x2014;I wish I heard it confirmed! The weather still, I suppose, is rather unfavourable to you. We have had it harsh, cold, easterly with blazing sun; not a drop of rain for many weeks: the fields in many places are getting brown, or have never fairly been green yet. A great plunge of good rain, then westerly winds, and green times of it, for us! &#x201C;Jenny is very attentive to you,&#x201D; Jean says; which is a very great comfort and obligation to me.</p>
<p>I have been out twice riding; a man (who wants to hear me talk) came with two horses, by volunteer appointment of his; and we scoured away together, by Richmond Park<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A large royal park on the Thames 10 mi. WSW of London.</note> and beautiful leafy places,&#x2014;a useful thing for me. I keep myself very solitary in general. I am a little plagued with sleeplessness now and then,&#x2014;according to my old style of procedure; otherwise have nothing to complain of. Yes&#x2014;I have to complain of <hi rend="italic">laziness</hi> often, dog that I am; I cannot get work out of myself, I do not deserve to have sleep!</p>
<p>The other night we were with a great body of gaping Americans, <pb id="pg-18-42" n="18:42"/>men and women; I talked a good while with the American Ambassador,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edward Everett (<date when="1794-00-00">1794</date>&#x2013;<date when="1865-00-00">1865</date>), unitarian clergyman, statesman, and orator; prof. of Greek at Harvard, <date when="1815-00-00">1815</date>, taking up post, <date when="1819-00-00">1819</date>; member of U.S. congress, <date when="1825-00-00">1825</date>&#x2013;<date when="1835-00-00">35</date>; gov. of Mass., <date when="1836-00-00">1836</date>&#x2013;<date when="1840-00-00">40</date>; minister to Gt. Britain, <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>&#x2013;<date when="1845-00-00">45</date>; pres. of Harvard Univ., <date when="1846-00-00">1846</date>&#x2013;<date when="1849-00-00">49</date>; U.S. sec. of state, <date when="1852-00-00">1852</date>&#x2013;<date when="1853-00-00">53</date>; U.S. senator, <date when="1853-00-00">1853</date>&#x2013;<date when="1854-00-00">54</date>.</note> a really sensible wellbred man, and got thro&#x2019; the business as smoothly as I could. Yesterday I went to a Public Meeting which Lord Ashley (the &#x201C;Ten-hours Bill&#x201D; Ashley) had got together for &#x201C;Improving the condition of the Working Classes.&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On Sat. a meeting to found a Society for the Improvement of the Labouring Classes was held in Willis&#x2019;s Rooms, St. James&#x2019;s, with Lord Ashley in the chair. He said that the society aimed to improve housing, expand the &#x201C;allotment system,&#x201D; and start friendly loan societies. Other speakers included various M.P.s, the Rev. George Bull (Ashley&#x2019;s old fellow-campaigner for the Ten Hours&#x2019; Bill), Milnes, and the Rev. Sydney Godolphin Osborne. They raised &#xa3;400.</note> The details they gave were somewhat ominous; the Meeting itself was an interesting object. The people were all Tories, many of them Clergymen of the Church; but it came out of everyone of them that matters were got into a state in which they <hi rend="italic">could</hi> not continue,&#x2014;that either help and improvement or frightful issues of all sorts were inevitable. Jack was there too; I am to see him again tonight.</p>
<p>Jack begins to speak seriously about getting into the country, setting off on a course of visits &#x26;c. I think you will have him at Scotsbrig by and by, perhaps before very long. As to me, I can predict nothing yet; if I <hi rend="italic">can</hi> stay where I am, I ought decidedly to do it. When I ask myself, &#x201C;How much work done since you came last from the Country?&#x201D; the answer is most beggarly.&#x2014;</p>
<p>Dear Mother, we were the ungratefullest wretches if we forgot always to acknowledge the excellence of our two hams, which we do <hi rend="italic">practically</hi> recognise every one of these mornings! All thanks to you and Jamie; it is to you we owe this among other good things. Better bacon ham I do not remember to have eaten, in general. Some of it is too salt, <hi rend="italic">far</hi> more salt than other pieces of the same ham, which in general is very fresh: I mention this that Jamie, or whoever the curer was, may know, if he do not already know, this property of curing&#x2014; As to the piece or pieces that were too salt, we merely turn aside from them to a fresher end (for it is very fresh almost all); and what is too salt for frying we will <hi rend="italic">boil</hi> in due season. I find it very wholesome food; Jane&#x2019;s main breakfast, I often think, consists of a little patch of it.</p>
<p>Jenny said Jamie was unwell at the time she wrote; I supposed it to be some influenza or Spring cold; as Jean says nothing of it, we hope it has withdrawn itself again.</p>
<p>John Sterling still continues in a rather precarious state; greatly dependent on the change of the <hi rend="italic">east</hi> wind, I fancy. Poor Sterling, his <pb id="pg-18-43" n="18:43"/>friends are all in alarm about him; he himself will admit of no <hi rend="italic">alarm</hi>,&#x2014; declares that he expects and is ready to die. His poor old Father is in a rather bad way too for the present; hurt by the agitation &#x26;c. I still hope it will all turn out well.</p>
<p><foreign>Adieu</foreign> dear Mother; I must go and walk, or it will be worse for me. Take care of yourself, we all beg of you! Jenny understands that she cannot so oblige us all as by taking care of you.&#x2014; Give our kind regards to Isabella; tell Jamie I know myself to owe him a Letter, at least such is my feeling,&#x2014;unless <hi rend="italic">he</hi> will admit that he is the debtor; or be generous, and lend <hi rend="italic">again?</hi></p>
<p>We saw John Gordon the other night, he is now a kind of Public Officer, connected with the General Assembly and Schools; he was here with some Residuary-Kirk people on business of theirs.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Residuary-Kirk&#x201D; was a derogatory term for those who did not secede to form the Free Church. Gordon was presumably in London, with members of the Gen. Assem. education committee, to report to the privy council committee on education, <date when="1844-05-10">10 May</date>. In due course, on <date when="1844-06-19">19 June</date>, Gordon was apptd. one of Her Majesty&#x2019;s school inspectors for Scotland, after resigning as sec. of the Gen. Assem. education committee.</note> Jeffrey, of whom we hear nothing these three weeks, is said to be very unwell; at his Son-in-law&#x2019;s some twenty miles off.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Empson&#x2019;s, Haileybury.</note>&#x2014; <closer><salute>Farewell, dear Mother, once more.

<p><salute>Dearest Babbie</salute> after a day of &#x201C;unmitigated&#x201D; bustle, commencing at half after five in the morning, I find myself the only living soul in the house&#x2014;unless you choose to count the cat as another&#x2014;so I had better while the play is good scribble you a few distracted lines. Since plainly I shall not hear from you again till I do&#x2014; In the beginning of last week arrived Miss B&#xF6;lte with her boxes. When a person asks one to seek her a <hi rend="italic">lodging knowing</hi> that one possesses a spare bed, nay having actually enjoyed the benefit of one&#x2019;s spare bed before, it is equvalent-to-saying &#x201C;will <hi rend="italic">you</hi> take me in&#x201D;? I would much rather <hi rend="italic">not</hi> under the present circumstances: for the change of dynasty was to take place today in my kitchen, and a visitor at such awful seasons is a nuisance&#x2014;not to say that this little german, tho&#x2019; a good creature, and <pb id="pg-18-44" n="18:44"/>&#x201C;not without sense,&#x201D; is at no time an interesting companion for me&#x2014;she will sit hours together, especially when I am <hi rend="italic">doing</hi> company, staring at me with her horn-eyes, and speaking never a word, till I feel somehow as if I were fallen under the power of a bad dream! but then&#x2014;she is in a strange land&#x2014;and if <hi rend="italic">I</hi> did not take her in<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf.

Meanwhile there has been the Devils own scrubbing and scowering going on&#x2014; Helen was resolved that if the house should not have been clean for a year it should shine immaculate on the <hi rend="italic">coming home</hi> of the new woman<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Maria.</note>&#x2014; And then Helen has been in such a&#x2014;temper!&#x2014;not an <hi rend="small-caps">ill</hi> temper so much as a loverlike fit of jealousy and suspicion!&#x2014;when she found that I had no idea of puddling on with <hi rend="italic">Martha</hi> or any of <hi rend="italic">her</hi> friends as she had flattered herself&#x2014;so that I might be supremely sensible of the greatness of <hi rend="italic">her</hi> loss and the importance of getting her back.&#x2014;a new light seemed to dawn upon her scotch journey! but when she learned by <hi rend="italic">reading a note</hi> from M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Rich which I had <hi rend="small-caps">purposely</hi> left on the table that a very desirable person was willing to come to me for a month or as many of them as I pleased&#x2014;she went off into a&#x2014;sort of hysterics&#x2014;told me she supposed I &#x201C;wished for a change&#x201D;&#x2014;and the sooner she was out of the house for good and all I would be the better pleased&#x2014; I told her that if she would like to remain in Scotland her going could never have been better timed as <pb id="pg-18-45" n="18:45"/>the new woman I had got was the nicest looking servant and had the best character of any one I had ever had to do with in London&#x2014; She rushed down stairs exclaiming &#x201C;Oh I see&#x2014;I had better not wait till next week&#x2014;I can be ready tomorrow for that matter&#x201D;! About five minutes after&#x2014;literally it was not more&#x2014;she came tripping back all smiles of good humour and asked me&#x2014; &#x2014;how poor M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Wedgwood was? The creature has no more sense in her head than a flea!&#x2014;but then she <hi rend="small-caps">will</hi> stay&#x2014;for all her distracted flea-skippings always end in <hi rend="italic">that</hi>&#x2014;and how <hi rend="italic">can</hi> I put her away unless she does something unbearable&#x2014; I am no judge of countenance if the woman who has come today be not a much more rational and capable Servant than Helen&#x2014;and not inferior to her in kindness of heart&#x2014;already I&#x2014;even I&#x2014;with all my horror of newcomers feel perfectly reconciled to say <hi rend="italic">Maria</hi> and to see her moving about&#x2014;but if she were the most perfect of her species I should feel under a necessity to let her go at the end of the month&#x2014;and take back the flea&#x2014;because&#x2014;the creature would suffer I am quite sure as much as ever husband suffered when his wife took up with another man&#x2014;she would almost inevitably take to drinking again&#x2014;and I should have the ruin of her ever on my conscience and should probably be punished even in this world by having those I wished to keep leave <hi rend="italic">me!</hi> You will laugh at this grave view of the subject&#x2014;but it is fixed so in my head&#x2014;and I cannot help myself.&#x2014; She is gone however I could easily see with a violent apprehension that I may change my mind about taking her back&#x2014;and the last effort she made to assure herself was most curious; When she was taking leave of me this morning at six&#x2014;with the face of a person going to be <hi rend="italic">hanged</hi> rather than going on a <hi rend="italic">lark</hi>&#x2014;she said fixing a searching look on me &#x201C;May I take the second volume of that book with me?&#x201D; &#x201C;What <hi rend="italic">book</hi> in the name of goodness&#x2014;?&#x201D; &#x201C;Oh ye <foreign>ken</foreign> the nice book&#x2014;(she did not know the name of it&#x2014;) the one I had the first volume of&#x2014;&#x201D;!

<salute>Dear Browning,</salute>
<p>This Mr Field,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >H. W. Field.</note> Oliver&#x2019;s descendant, seems to be a kind of fool; and I find I shall have to attack him thro&#x2019; you,&#x2014;for your sins!</p>
<p>He called here the other day, at an hour when there is no admission; I wrote a small civil Note indicating that a copy of Oliver&#x2019;s Letter would greatly oblige me; that to see himself afterwards, if he found good to call again, any day after two o&#x2019;clock, would give me &#x26;c &#x26;c. He answers after ten days by this enclosed Note; seems not to understand that the Copy of Oliver&#x2019;s own Letter, not Henry&#x2019;s or the drawing of New Hall near Chelmsford,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henry Cromwell, Oliver&#x2019;s fourth son. Newhall, nr. Chelmsford, Essex, belonged to his brother Richard and once belonged to &#x201C;the great Duke of Buckingham&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 8:254).</note>&#x2014;is the only part of his possessions that interests me; and writes, in short, in a very illegible hand too, considerably like a goose! I fear unless you take him in hand, I shall have a great deal of corresponding with him yet!&#x2014;</p>
<p>He lives somewhere about Blackheath; he is known to some friends of yours: could not you, by your dexterity, contrive to introduce some legible penman, for ten minutes, into free contact with that invaluable Autograph, and get a correct copy of it;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Both Blackheath and Hatcham, Browning&#x2019;s home, are S of the Thames and fairly close to each other.</note>&#x2014;we should then leave Field to rhyme the matter in his own head, quite at his leisure, and to call here either during the summer or the winter as it seemed good to him! Do this, if you can, for me; and I will march Field out of my memory <pb id="pg-18-49" n="18:49"/>straightway.&#x2014; There is no haste, I ought to say; a copy any time within six months will serve all essential purposes. You can wait your time therefore; but when the time favours, let your Charity keep me in view.</p>
<p>For the rest why don&#x2019;t you come and see us here? You are found absent without leave. We are at home almost as good as every evening, and indeed every morning too; and your face is a pleasant phenomenon here.</p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Many thanks for your two Cromwell Letters, a most welcome gift to me. I am assiduously collecting all Letters and authentic utterances that came from Oliver himself: these, entirely credible and true as I have everywhere found them, promise to form a kind of firm basis for me, in the Abyss of lies, stupidities and delirium which his &#x201C;History&#x201D; hitherto has been for us.</p>
<p>The Letter to Mrs Cromwell has already gone abroad and was known to me; but I am very happy to know accurately in whose hands the original now is.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1650-09-04">4 Sept. 1650</date>, &#x201C;copied from the Original by John Hare, Esq.,&#x201D; (purchased <date when="1842-00-00">1842</date>) (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 7:221n), the first of three letters in <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> from Cromwell to his wife, Elizabeth, b. Bourchier (<date when="1597-00-00">1597</date>&#x2013;<date when="1665-00-00">1665</date>), m., <date when="1620-00-00">1620</date>.</note> Does your Brother live at Clifton too; or what is his specific designation?<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sholto Vere Hare (<date when="1819-00-00">1819</date>&#x2013;<date when="1900-00-00">1900</date>), 7 Codrington Pl., Clifton.</note> The Letter to Hazelrig I never before saw, or knew of, and it is certainly very curious. The date is clear enough from the contents. It must have been written at Dunbar, on the night of the <date when="1650-09-02">2<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Sept<hi rend="italic">r</hi> 1650</date>,&#x2014;a &#x201C;wet night,&#x201D; with the victorious enemy hanging all round on this hand, and the wild autumn sea beating against the rocks on that,&#x2014;under as ominous circumstances as a man has often stood in; and it is a right brave Letter. Will you name to me who the actual proprietor of this is, and if he knows at all by what road it came into his hands.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The first of four letters in <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> to Sir Arthur Haselrig (d. <date when="1661-00-00">1661</date>), parliamentary gen. and statesman, &#x201C;communicated by John Hare, Esquire.&#x201D; In the third edn. (<date when="1847-00-00">1847</date>) the original was noted as belonging to R. Ormston, Newcastle-on-Tyne (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 7:200n).</note> Your Brother, who is skilful in such <pb id="pg-18-50" n="18:50"/>things, pronounces it an undoubted Original? That it is genuine the style itself will testify. Oliver&#x2019;s handwriting, however, is very recognisable.</p>
<p>A Copy of the Letter from Monk, at any time when your leisure serves, will be another favour to me. I do not recollect to have elsewhere fallen in with this document. What the old close-mouthed Horse-dealer of a General saw good to write to Richard, in <date when="1659-00-00">1659</date> or <date when="1658-00-00">8</date>, cannot but be curious to see!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> makes no mention of any letter from George Monck to Richard Cromwell; but Strachey notes that Monck&#x2019;s letter was owned by Sholto Hare, that it recommended &#x201C;the appointment of certain sheriffs of counties, colonels of regiments, and captains of warships,&#x201D; and that it showed how Monck was preparing to work for Charles&#x2019;s restoration.</note></p>
<p>Mrs Strachey I was sorry to find suffering somewhat under our bitter east-wind; I myself have fallen under the same bad influence, or I should have called a second time.</p>

<salute>Dear Jean,</salute>
<p>I ought to send you a small word today, in return for the two you have written me I have not a syllable of news; but to apprise you that I have none, is worth doing.</p>
<p>Jack had a Letter from Jenny, with one side of it written by our Mother; he brought it down to me, I think the day after yours came. Our good Mother: her rugged pious handwriting is always like a kind of sacred thing to me,&#x2014;I read it like a voice from the very heart! She does appear to be getting into better health now, and to have been in a worse way than I ever clearly understood while it lasted. The fine summer weather, which I always promised, does not come for any of us. I hope our Mother will still take every care of herself: this easterly withering weather seems to me really unwholesome for everything that has life, animal or even vegetable. Almost everybody here has had his Influenza; three days ago I, very unexpectedly, got hold of the skirt of one for myself; but by prompt measures I drove it back again, and feel now as if it were nearly off. We are to have a bad <pb id="pg-18-51" n="18:51"/>harvest, I suppose? The fields here are getting altogether brown: Hyde Park dusts your shoes worse than a highway when you walk thro&#x2019; it.&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; The Town is roaring with torrents of carriages; swarming with all manner of idle and busy people: from all ends of the Earth, and for all conceivable purposes and no-purposes, we have them here. I study to keep out of it as much by my best ingenuity I can; I am to dine today, but it is the first time these many weeks, and with &#x201C;the Wilsons,&#x201D; our oldest friends here.</p>
<p>My Book goes on not so badly, everything considered. I hope in good moments that I shall get it done some time; in other moments, that seems flatly impossible: but either way, I <foreign><hi rend="italic">torfle</hi></foreign> [flounder] on. It is like a whole universe of quagmire, out of which I have to raise a tolerably elegant brick palace! I have sounded, and weltered, and splashed; in all my life I have not had such a job. It will be long yet; but it is fairly begun now, I hope, and equal or superior to half finished.&#x2014; I say sometimes, to follow Literature well, you need first &#x201C;the obstinacy of ten mules&#x201D;:&#x2014;indeed a touch of that quality, well tempered, is indispensable I believe in most lines of business!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Jack is driven now into an upper room in his house,&#x2014;an inconvenient lodgement for him: he surrendered his own rooms for a time to oblige his landlady, whom he likes. The inconvenient upper room may possibly the sooner send him to the Country: however, he still lingers here, and has yet set no time for going. He is in fact, at bottom, idle, without definite errand anywhither; he flatters himself too for most part that he is &#x201C;working,&#x201D; at other rare times I suppose he cannot so flatter himself, and feels somewhat unhappy. Poor fellow, I really am very sorry for him sometimes,&#x2014;and angry at other times: but in both cases I strictly hold my peace, having in fact not the smallest possibility to help by speech, but for the reverse indeed. I believe I and my Literature &#x26;c &#x26;c have been a great bewilderment to this good and truly gifted younger brother of mine;&#x2014;that if he had not had me in the world at all, it had perhaps been better for him! We are very powerless to help one another in this world; our poor good wishes in our hearts are almost all we have to offer one another!&#x2014; <closer><salute>God be with you dear Sister.</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Scott,</salute>
<p>It was a painful surprise to me the sad news I had the other week, of the opinion your Doctor had pronounced upon you. I was not aware that you were ill; I was looking for a sight of you soon, as one of the compensations in store for me;&#x2014;and it turns out all otherwise for the present,&#x2014;not as I had ordered it, but as Another has.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In his Journal in <date when="1844-05-00">May</date> TC wrote: &#x201C;Poor Scott &#x2026; is reported by the Doctors to have a probably fatal disease of the heart; he is at Edinburgh, it seems,&#x2014;very composed. There has not been a more tragical emergency within my horizon of late. Poor Scott, he had such strugglings, battles for deliverance, he aimed at so much,&#x2014;and <hi rend="italic">this</hi> is to be the solution for him?&#x2014;&#x201D; Scott lived till <date when="1866-00-00">1866</date>.</note></p>
<p>My first impulse was to inquire after your Address; for the feeling in me was one that longed to utter itself in some kind of words. And yet alas there were, and there are, as good as no <hi rend="italic">words</hi>. It is so little that one man can do for another. We can weep and grieve for one another; we can bid one another be of courage, be of hope;&#x2014;and that is, as it were, all!&#x2014; The wretched state of my own spirits, and the deep confusions I am weltering in of late, have prevented me from doing even that.</p>
<p>My Wife was heartily gratified by the tone of your Letter, which she heard read at the Wedgwoods&#x2019;: it was brave, manful and calm, she said, as the words of a man could be. This is right; hold on by this, and quit it not. It is the anchor we have in these wild storms of Time and Chance,&#x2014;a strength lent us by our Maker, and which, we may say, holds of Him. We are here in the Place of Hope always; and yet always we are to be prepared for Evil, since the Worst is, at all moments, near to every one of us.</p>
<p>Doctors are in no case infallible prophets to me; my Brother too says that your disease is one they are apt enough to be mistaken in: we know nothing yet for certain, except even this, That the Eternal does rule in all things; that all shall be according to His will,&#x2014;and that surely this shall be <hi rend="italic">well</hi>. Well and best. Dear friend, what words can I say to you? There are no words, and I will say no more.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>My work, for the last seven or eight months, has been in the highest degree dreary and disheartening, and hitherto, so far as appearance goes, seems altogether or almost altogether in vain. I find that the Spirit of Puritanism is not to be delineated to these ages,&#x2014;except with an effort which borders nearer on the impossible than I have ever yet gone. I may describe myself as plunging thro&#x2019; a Chaos, without <pb id="pg-18-53" n="18:53"/>firmaments even, not to say without landmarks, where there is no land or sea or sky: such an element as I was never in before. Little comes upon the paper, after great endeavour; almost nothing comes that seems destined to stay there.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In her diary, <date when="1844-05-27">27 May</date>, Caroline Fox wrote: &#x201C;Called on the Carlyles. He was poorly, and asleep on the sofa when we went in. &#x2026; He groaned over Oliver Cromwell, for his progress in that memorial is slow and painful: all that had been said or written in his favour was destroyed or ignored when Charles II. came to reign; as a Calvinistic Christian he was despised, and as a Ruler and Regicide he was hated; the people would not forgive him for having seemed to deceive them, and so they dug up his body and hanged it at Tyburn, and have been telling the most abominable lies about him ever since; lately there has been some better feeling, but the case is still very bad. &#x2018;Upon the whole,&#x2019; he added, &#x2018;I don&#x2019;t believe a truer, more right-hearted Englishman than Oliver ever existed. Wherever you find a line of his own writing you may be sure to find nothing but truth there.&#x2019; We compared his principal of governing to Dr. Francia&#x2019;s in Paraguay,&#x2014;giving the people a despotism to deliver them from anarchy. &#x2018;Why, Francia was a very small man compared with Oliver. &#x2026;&#x2019; Mrs. Carlyle here said, &#x2018;Why, a short time ago Francia was all in favour; and so he would be again if you had but a little contradiction!&#x2019; Then, speaking of the wretched mistakes which different ages make concerning their Greatest, he said, &#x2018;Why, the Jews took Jesus for a scoundrel, and thought all they could do with him was to nail him up on a gallows. Ah! that was a bad business; and so He has returned to Heaven, and they go wandering about the streets buying old clothes!&#x2019;&#x201D; (Fox 189&#x2013;90).</note></p>
<p>And yet I feel sometimes as if this sorrowful and perhaps impossible enterprise were perhaps appointed to do me good. It is a fruitful kind of study that of men who do in very deed understand and feel at all moments that they are in contact with God, that the right and wrong of their little life has extended itself into Eternity and Infinitude. Very clearly I perceive that this is the highest condition of man,&#x2014;his only true condition for being a man. I stand astonished at the sober indubitable fact of it: how the thing that we hear, every day, like a mere sound, was to these men a fact! It is at bottom my religion too; I seem to understand that it will, in the essence of it, have to be all men&#x2019;s. These are &#x2018;robes of light,&#x2019; as I say, encircling a man, without which the man is not luminous, but dark and unmanlike.&#x2014; If I can gather this, and make it mine a little more conclusively, from my Puritans, my literary disappointment in the matter may be borne! Certainly, it seems to me, this their practical Contact with the Highest was a fact, which can be imitated, which should be emulated by all men. The latest fact of its kind, nearest to our own sunk days, and a fact forever memorable to us. In what of <hi rend="italic">Egoism</hi> they had embarked on this faith I do not participate; in their hopes little, in their terrors not at all: that seems to me the new condition we are got into, or struggling to get into.</p>
<p>Dear Scott, I feel I do not weary you with these things. Thoughts <pb id="pg-18-54" n="18:54"/>of the like sort I do believe are daily in your own mind, and, in your sore-struggling pilgrimage to spiritual manhood, have long been. If it please God, you shall yet be employed to make them clearer to yourself and others.&#x2014; I will write no more tonight. I will bid you rest in Patience, rest in Hope, like a faithful man!</p>
<p>It would be cruel to trouble you when perhaps you are weak; but if at any good moment you felt disposed to write me a little word of any kind, I should be glad of it. My blessings on your good Wife. May God&#x2019;s blessing be on you both always, and on us all. Good night.</p>

<salute>Dearest Babbie</salute>
<p>Yesterday there came to pass the absurdest thing, which I feel a <foreign><hi rend="italic">besoin</hi></foreign> [need] to tell you before it grows cold in me! It was a day of visitors,&#x2014;of what the Haddington dressmaker used to call &#x201C;carriage-Ladies&#x201D;; One foot-man-rap after another had assailed my nerves, till I was fain to seek refuge in a sort of resigned stupidity&#x2014;the last Carriage-Lady came just as I was finishing with Miss Farrer<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >An old friend of Mrs. Rich (see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400802-TC-MRI-01"><sic>12:217</sic><corr>TC to MRI, <date when="1840-08-02">2 Aug. 1840</date></corr></ref>), mentioned by Thomas Erskine in <date when="1835-00-00">1835</date> and <date when="1838-00-00">1838</date> (Hanna 1:237, 320); probably Frances Loxham Farrer (d. <date when="1846-00-00">1846</date>), whose nephew Thomas Henry Farrer (<date when="1819-00-00">1819</date>&#x2013;<date when="1899-00-00">99</date>; <ref target="volume-18/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/9194"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>) was to be joint trustee with Hensleigh Wedgwood and Erasmus Darwin from <date when="1849-00-00">1849</date> of Bedford College and who later m. Mary Rich&#x2019;s nieces Frances Erskine, <date when="1854-00-00">1854</date>, and Katherine Euphemia Wedgwood, <date when="1873-00-00">1873</date>. Mary Rich had apparently moved from Woolwich to 5 Albert St., Pimlico.</note> and M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Rich: and was shown in by the agitated Maria, with some <hi rend="italic">movement of the lips</hi>, but no <hi rend="italic">sound</hi> of a name that reached my ears; nor did I think it worth while to ask her to try it again, as new Servants mangle ones visitors names so as merely to make them into a temptation to laugh exactly at the wrong moment&#x2014; The Lady who followed her inarticulate announcement was very pretty, young, with a considerable dash (it struck me) of the French <foreign><hi rend="italic">Grisette</hi></foreign> [coquettish shopgirl] about her, only more expensively dressed. (You are to recollect that I never <hi rend="small-caps">saw</hi> a French <foreign>Grisette</foreign> with my bodily eyes&#x2014;have merely got an idea of the phenomenon out of George Sand&#x2019;s Novels) She seemed to know me rather <hi rend="italic">intimately</hi> and even to expect that I should be pleased to see her. Plainly to follow my first impulse, and ask <hi rend="italic">whom</hi> I had the pleasure of addressing was going to have caused her a considerable shock; so I allowed myself to be shaked hands with, and sat down on <pb id="pg-18-55" n="18:55"/>the sofa beside her, and talked of the weather, and answered kind enquiries about my health and hoped that by <hi rend="italic">precise</hi>ing nothing, I might get the time put over till something should fall from <hi rend="italic">her</hi> to give me the shadow of an idea who she was! The situation was embarrassing, but as I have said I had got past all &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">finer sensibilities</hi>&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech.</note> at the moment, and I <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;waited&#x201D;</hi> with a composure of soul that Cavaignac himself could not have rivalled&#x2014; &#x201C;I hoped to have had good accounts of you to <hi rend="small-caps">take back</hi>&#x201D; said she, in answer to my reflections against the east-wind&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">&#x201C;take back&#x201D;?</hi> thought I, &#x201C;&#x2014;is there <hi rend="italic">a family of them</hi> all alike <hi rend="italic">unknown</hi> who take so lively an interest in my health?&#x201D; But just then her <hi rend="italic">voice</hi> awoke a sort of remembrance in me, and by an almost superhuman effort at recollection I perceived my visitor to be &#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; Elizabeth Macgregor, alias Mrs Thomas Cook!!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably Walter Macgregor&#x2019;s sister.</note> Decidedly &#x201C;my constitution is breaking up&#x201D; (as Old Sterling Says of himself) for there was no change in <hi rend="italic">her</hi> to have excused such want of memory! When I had made the discovery I thought it best to <hi rend="italic">recommence</hi> with her, confessing that up to that moment she had been a <foreign><hi rend="italic">grande mistero</hi></foreign> [great mystery] for me! Judging from myself I thought she would like less ill to have been frankly forgotten, than to have been received <hi rend="italic">coldly</hi>&#x2014;and of course though I did my best to meet her after her own fashion I could not be very <hi rend="italic">warm</hi>, to I did not know whom. It was a pity!&#x2014;but &#x201C;accidents <hi rend="italic">will</hi> happen in the best regulated families&#x201D;&#x2014;and how much more in this family which is rapidly going to the Devil! Could Helen only imagine how we go on; her heart would overflow with diabolic joy! Not that the new woman disappoints me much; except in the faculty of <hi rend="italic">speed</hi>, she does not in fact disappoint me at all&#x2014; She is a fine-tempered, rational, quiet, creature whom I could train in a few months to be every whit as servicable a servant as Helen, but having her only for a month, falling to <hi rend="italic">training</hi> her at all would be a work of supererogation, as <hi rend="italic">my</hi> ways would have to be all unlearnt again, most likely, in the next place she goes to, and there would be no time for <hi rend="italic">myself</hi> to reap any fruits of my labours. <hi rend="italic">As she is</hi> she might be gone on quite comfortably with in any other house but this, where it is considered the sin against the Holy Ghost to set a chair or a plate two inches off the spot they have been used to stand on! and where the servant of a week is required to know all the <hi rend="italic">outs and ins</hi> of the house as currently as the servant of seven years! Men are very unreasonable really and this man in particular is enough to turn one&#x2019;s head&#x2014;at times. It is in vain that I get up an hour before the usual time, that I make the porridge and the coffee and all that I <hi rend="italic">can</hi> <pb id="pg-18-56" n="18:56"/>make, with my own hands, he goes about from morning till night really <hi rend="italic">trying</hi> you would say what <hi rend="italic">possibly can</hi> be got to fret and scold about&#x2014;till I declare to Heaven my patience is quite exhausted&#x2014;what with <hi rend="italic">his</hi> everlasting unreasonable worrying, what with the number of <hi rend="italic">little things</hi> I have to look after what with about <hi rend="italic">three weeks</hi> of that most obtuse Miss B&#xF6;lte what with the east-wind and my own corrupt human nature I am pretty near suicide just now, or&#x2014;flying off to Liverpool.</p>
<p>Just fancy B&#xF6;lte staying on thro all my difficulties, from week to week, and when I had only offered her a bed for the two days betwixt her coming to town and Mrs Bullers&#x2014; Indeed her stay was assuming an air of <hi rend="italic">permancy</hi> which made my blood run cold, and not only <hi rend="italic">mine</hi> but everyone&#x2019;s that frequents the house&#x2014;for you know her way of sitting gazing at one&#x2019;s visitors without ever speaking a word&#x2014; Anthony Sterling requested as a particular favour that I would &#x201C;marry her to Plattnauer and so set the two pairs of gazing German eyes to gaze at on<supplied>[e]</supplied><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> another!&#x201D;&#x2014; She is gone now however &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">thanks</hi> God&#x201D;!&#x2014;is engaged to Sir James Graham at a salary of a hundred guineas a year! M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Buller told Lady Graham that she was recommended by <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, and that <hi rend="small-caps">she</hi> had considered all other recommendation perfectly superflous&#x2014;whereupon Lady Graham was pleased to say &#x201C;Oh certainly! M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle&#x2019;s recommendation is to be received as <hi rend="italic">conclusive&#x201D;!</hi> So &#x201C;the first chapters of Genesis&#x201D; are silenced for ever!&#x2014;and now having done my duty of general&#x2014;humanity so successfully by her, I recommend her to Destiny and her own deserving&#x2014;for I really <hi rend="italic">am</hi> sick of my <foreign>proteg&#xE9;e</foreign>!&#x2014; She is an excellent Governess; the miraculous improvement she has wrought on Theresa<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Revis.</note> proves <hi rend="italic">that</hi> beyond all doubt&#x2014; But for a companion to <hi rend="italic">me</hi>&#x2014;!

However when Helen comes, and there is no more need of me to stand between him and the kitchen I will make another attempt I do so want to see you my Babbie&#x2014;to see you all&#x2014;my Uncle most of any&#x2014;</p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>What is becoming of you in this dreadfully inclement weather? No day but I think of you; I fear you must be getting ill again: this bitter east wind is enough to make any health suffer a little. The very grass withers in it; all living things complain.&#x2014; Keep yourself warm, dear Mother; take care of yourself: surely the summer must come soon, at last.</p>
<p>We have all &#x201C;influenzas&#x201D; in this part of the world; the women in the shops, Jane says, have mostly &#x201C;lost their voice,&#x201D; and speak in a shrieky whisper! Jane herself has ecaped influenza, and is tolerably well, very well <hi rend="italic">considering</hi>. I got a whiff of the business about ten days ago, and was very uncomfortable for two days; but by vigorous measures I drove the enemy back, and now go on without much uneasiness,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; longing greatly for the west wind, which never comes. These three days we have had no sun either; it is out today again, but the glare of it amid the Greenland cold is partly unnatural, and little better than its absence.</p>
<p>Jack went off last Thursday, three days ago; as he has probably himself told you. I parted with him on Wednesday night, amid a kind of rain, at his own door; and anticipated a bad travelling day; but it turned out otherwise,&#x2014;dry enough for him, and too dry for all other purposes. He is gone to George Johnstone&#x2019;s, westward in Glo&#x2019;stershire: I think he will gradually get up to Liverpool, and then across into Annandale. Certainly he hopes to see you and Scotsbrig before his return. He has no fixed work here; I wish he could fix himself, poor fellow; but we cannot help him by urging him.</p>
<p>There is no Letter yet from Sandy;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alexander Carlyle.</note> we expected one about this time, but must not be impatient. Possibly he does not care to write till he have fixed himself, and can say, &#x201C;Here I am&#x201D;;&#x2014;he ought to have written! But we will hope all is well nevertheless; we will hope poor Alick is getting the worst of the business now put by; getting a new home for himself, which may prosper better than some of the old ones did.</p>
<p>My Book now goes along better or worse, tho&#x2019; still far too slowly. I am now, however, beginning to see <hi rend="italic">above</hi> ground some fruit of the <pb id="pg-18-59" n="18:59"/>unspeakable puddings and welterings I had <hi rend="italic">underground</hi>! I do hope sometimes that I shall get the poor Book done; and that it will turn out to have been worth doing. Oliver Cromwell is an actually pious, praying, God-fearing, Bible-reading man; and struggles, in the high places of the world before God and men, to do what he finds written in his Bible. An astonishing spectacle; unexampled;&#x2014;altogether incredible to the poor sneaking Spunges and beggarly Peel-Russell and Company, that have got the guidance of the world now, to all our sorrows! If I can shew Oliver as he is, I shall do a good turn; but it is terribly difficult to such an age as this is and has long been.&#x2014;</p>
<p>Dear Mother, I have not time left:&#x2014;when have I ever any time! I have scribbled this word after my task was done; I write to hardly anybody but you. Remember me to Jamie and Isabella, to young and old, with the old affection.&#x2014; Jeffrey is unwell at Edinburgh, John Sterling is still unwell and not out of danger; one Scott, a friend of ours, once Edward Irving&#x2019;s assistant, is said to have got a disease of the heart likely to be fatal. Many are ill;&#x2014;and we have more mercy shewn us than many! <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign> dear Mother, dear friends all; God&#x2019;s blessing be with you.</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Forster,</salute>
<p>I truly love Dickens; and discern in the inner man of him a tone of real Music, which struggles to express itself as it may, in these bewildered stupified, and indeed very empty and distracted days,&#x2014;better or worse! This, which makes him in my estimation one of a thousand, I could with great joy and freedom testify to all persons, to himself first of all, in any good way. But by dinner,&#x2014;at Greenwich,&#x2014;in the dog-days,&#x2014;under Lord Mahogany,&#x2014;by leg-of-mutton eloquence:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dickens was leaving for Italy, and Forster had invited TC to a farewell dinner at the Trafalgar Tavern, Greenwich, <date when="1844-06-10">10 June</date>.

Tennyson and Bulwer Lytton declined.

It includes a speech by Cromwell, <date when="1657-04-11">11 April 1657</date> (see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 9:39&#x2013;50). TC was bitterly contemptuous of Scott&#x2019;s &#x201C;editing,&#x201D; not without reason: &#x201C;In a style of incorrectness, or inextricability or dark confusion that puts Chaos itself to shame&#x201D; (MS: Yale, quoted K.

Did it ever exist? Or was it, after all, only, like that tremendous outburst of popular enthusiasm, a dream of the humane mind?</p>

<salute>My dear Sterling,</salute>
<p>I hear almost daily of you, and think of you oftener than daily this long while, tho&#x2019; I write nothing. Sometimes I have said to myself: &#x201C;You should write. He knows your feeling, and it is something to him;&#x2014;and in dark hours, now and then, such silence may seem doubtful to him.&#x201D; Perhaps I should. But indeed all words of mine seemed little other than an impertinence in that solemn situation. Many of my thoughts continue silent, incapable of being written, on this as on other subjects! The longer I live, I think it grows the more so. My much-loved Friend&#x2014; &#x2014;I really can &#x2018;write&#x2019; nothing! It all lies in <hi rend="italic">these three words;</hi>&#x2014;and these, if they are of any use to you, you are authorized to write in ineffaceable characters in your very heart.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>Except, for some days during the darkest part of the crisis, I have never, in spite of all your own sad utterances, seriously feared that I was to lose you. Perhaps I am wrapping myself in mere cowardly delusions; preparing for myself, at a future day, a frightful awakening: but such is the fact. I have, in spite of all Doctors, a great confidence in your vitality of structure; the fibres of the man, tho&#x2019; diseased, are those of a lion! My Brother too speaks always hopefully; says, he has seen men lying to all appearance at the verge of death in that disorder; pale, with their eyes and being all aglow in speechless still excitement; who nevertheless rose up again, and were well. He says, if you can live to five-and-forty,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sterling was thirty-eight.</note> this disordered condition of the lungs <pb id="pg-18-62" n="18:62"/>will abate of itself. My constant hope is, that your last terrible crisis may be a <hi rend="italic">warning</hi> to you, more impressive than any of the others were. They have all come, I think, out of some rash liberty; permitted to other men, but to you forbidden. You have in all things been too hot and hasty, my Friend,&#x2014;in all things, that generous infirmity cleaves to you. Lay it aside; learn by these stern teachings, to recognise the adamantine limits that do bound you, as such do bound us all. Within these, if it please God, there is yet a most fruitful and noble existence in store for you.&#x2014; &#x201C;Let us be still,&#x201D; as the Old Hebrews and Old Puritans used to say; &#x201C;let us be still, and call on God.&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Ps. 46:10.</note> There is yet no other wisdom, and will be none other, for the Son of Adam on this Earth.</p>
<p>I have been looking forward to the West wind, which we now have, as the best of all medicines for you. It seems you again were a little hasty; went out too rashly, and have got a little check. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Canny, Canny</hi></foreign> [Careful, Careful]! as the Scotch say; Use as not abusing!&#x2014; On the whole, you must get well again: you must <hi rend="italic">fast</hi> get a little better again,&#x2014;that I may come and see you. I will come certainly whenever I can hear conclusively that it will not be a mere burden to you, hurtful and not profitable<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC wrote that &#x201C;the doctors spoke despondently&#x201D; and that by the summer he saw his friend facing death (<hi rend="italic">Life of Sterling, Works</hi> 11:257).</note></p>
<p>All Spring and Summer hitherto I have for my own share, been abundantly miserable; plunging thro&#x2019; Chaos, as I call it,&#x2014;the Rushworth Dryasdust chaos; unable to find north or south in it, bottom or shore in it! Really, as I said, somewhere, it <hi rend="italic">is</hi> &#x201C;like walking hand in hand with mere <hi rend="italic">Madness</hi>&#x201D;;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Untraced.</note> trying whether you shall make it sane, or it shall make you mad! No labour for the present is joyous but grievous.&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; &#x2014;&#x2013; I have seen your Father, your Son and your Brother today; all well. <closer><salute><foreign><hi rend="italic">Wir heissen euch</hi> <hi rend="small-caps">hoffen</hi><hi rend="italic">!</hi> / <hi rend="italic">Auf ewig</hi></foreign> [We bid you hope!

<p>You see my dear &#x201C;the Reign of Terror&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">is</hi> raging itself wild here now! and I begin to be weary of it<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310911-JWC-TC-01"><sic>5:424</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1831-09-11">11 Sept. 1831</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014;<foreign>moi!</foreign> and it begins to look a stupidity rather than a heroism in me to stay till my life is crushed out in it&#x2014;seeing that my life is precious to many deserving persons besides myself. And then where on earth should I fly to, but just into the &#x201C;bosom of my family&#x201D;&#x2014;of all that is left of family for me here on earth.</p>
<p>My Uncle&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;tell her to come at once&#x201D;</hi> has sounded <hi rend="italic">in the ears of my heart</hi> ever since I heard it. And then it is so plainly <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;a duty&#x201D;</hi> to go!&#x2014;for I shall return after a week or two of your kindness, and of abnegation of worries, in a much more philosophic temper of mind, and more up to the necessary efforts and endurances of my lot of <hi rend="italic">Man-of-Genius&#x2019;s-wife</hi>. I had resolved to keep quiet till Helen returned and then state my wish not in the shape of a <hi rend="italic">request</hi> but of an <hi rend="italic">intention</hi>. The disclosure however was hastened by a letter from M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Paulet. C saw it lying on the table and asked whose writing <hi rend="italic">that</hi> was&#x2014; &#x201C;M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Paulets&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;what is it about, what does <hi rend="italic">she</hi> want&#x201D;?&#x2014; &#x201C;She wants <hi rend="italic">me</hi>&#x201D;&#x2014; &#x201C;Oh to visit her?&#x2014; &#x201C;Yes&#x201D;&#x2014; &#x201C;And are you thinking to accept?&#x201D; (in the same complaisant tone with which he volunteered to &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">take me to the Omnibus</hi>&#x201D; on the way to Tynemouth) the opportunity was too good to be lost so I answered boldly&#x2014; &#x201C;Why, I should hardly think of going off simply to visit M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Paulet&#x2014;but I do mean to go to see her when I <hi rend="italic">am</hi> in Liverpool and I really purpose going to Liverpool so soon as Helen returns and the house is settled in its old course&#x201D;&#x2014; &#x201C;Very well&#x201D; said he <hi rend="italic">rather shortly</hi>, there is nothing in the world to hinder you going when you please, and there is no use in <hi rend="italic">looking so tragic</hi> about it.&#x201D;&#x2014; No more has been said&#x2014;and I am not sure that he is calculating on my going for all this&#x2014;but I am silently taking my measures&#x2014;<foreign>par exemple</foreign> I went the other night (as it is necessary to give a weeks notice) to the Savings Bank to announce my intention of taking some money&#x2014;for I shall feel much <hi rend="italic">freer</hi> in my decisions when <pb id="pg-18-64" n="18:64"/>I am pleasing myself <hi rend="italic">at my own expence</hi>&#x2014;tho&#x2019; you may think that such <hi rend="italic">delicacy</hi> betwixt husband and wife is rather whimsical.</p>
<p>Helen arrived last night betwixt eleven and twelve&#x2014; I had been doing all I could to &#x201C;get up a sentiment&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A gallicism, meaning &#x201C;to be well intentioned.&#x201D;</note> about her&#x2014;at all events I was glad that things were going to return into the old course&#x2014;which if not a perfect one had at least the advantage of continuance. So hearing her voice I ran out into the passage to &#x201C;welcome her in my choicest mood&#x201D;&#x2014;but a Simoon could not have come over my cordiality with more withering influence than did the efluvia which emanated from her&#x2014;of downright unmistakable <hi rend="italic">gin!</hi> and at the first words she uttered I perceived her to be half-drunk&#x2014;!!! &#x201C;for Virtue ever is its own reward unless something very particular occur to prevent it&#x201D;!&#x2014; I returned to Carlyle in the parlour with a feeling of <hi rend="italic">shock</hi> which I cannot describe to you&#x2014;and <hi rend="italic">he</hi> quoted German poetry, and asked &#x201C;well what does it signify?&#x201D;&#x2014; Then I rung the bell and told the quiet well-conducted Maria to &#x201C;give that woman some tea and send her to bed&#x201D;&#x2014; When I was taking off my own clothes Helen came up a little sobered&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">with my reception</hi> and I said to her at once &#x201C;why in the name of God have you come home with gin in you&#x201D;?&#x2014; She professed her &#x201C;regrets&#x201D;&#x2014;she had come from the steamboat in the same cab with a most respectable pair of old people who at parting had given her a glass of gin&#x2014;and she &#x201C;thought it would <hi rend="italic">look so indiscreet</hi> not to take just a tasting of it&#x201D;! I ordered her off to bed went to my own with a violent palpitation at my heart, did not fall asleep till four in the morning, and slept then only some half hour&#x2014; In the morning <hi rend="italic">Maria</hi> came as usual to open my shutters and seemed so kind and so sad that I felt quite sorry to think this good respectable soul must give place to such a little Blackgaurd&#x2014; By and by came the little Blackgaurd however, washed and sorted up&#x2014;expressing the <hi rend="italic">daftest</hi> compunction for the &#x201C;unfortunate thing&#x201D;&#x2014;and I suppose after all she had little&#x2014;but then she knows that she can stand <hi rend="italic">none</hi>&#x2014; So after duly lecturing her there was no help for it but to <hi rend="italic">allow her to begin to be happy</hi>&#x2014; She seems as glad to get back as the other is sorry to go away&#x2014; Poor Maria&#x2014;she had been <hi rend="italic">crying</hi> off and on for the last two days&#x2014;certainly I have a wonderful luck for inspiring fervent <hi rend="italic">passions</hi> to servant-maids! She is going to Blount the Chemist in Cheyne Walk<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Blount, 47 Cheyne Walk.</note> this Maria which I am really glad of; I should have quite suffered to see her bundling off with her bits of bundles and boxes into unknown space! There I shall have my eye upon her and be cheered occasionally with the sight of her innocent good humoured face&#x2014; But enough for <pb id="pg-18-65" n="18:65"/>today&#x2014; I must set about getting my wardrobe in order to take, and my house in order to leave&#x2014;for when one goes one never knows if one is ever to come back alive&#x2014;One thing more&#x2014;knowing as you now do my unchristian hours and ways in the matter of sleeping which makes me a sort of incompatible guest in a small house would it not be well that I found myself <hi rend="italic">a bed out of doors</hi>, instead of plaguing you all to make room for me? I know when I come I always put somebody out of his or her bed and <hi rend="italic">that</hi> is of itself an evil&#x2014;and in summer what would it signify crossing a street or streets at night and recrossing it in the morning&#x2014; Ponder this&#x2014; <closer><salute>Ever your loving Cousin</salute></closer> <name>J C</name></p>
<ps><p>I enclose a letter which I take to be from no <hi rend="italic">man</hi> but from James Baillies own unmentionable<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The letter, <date when="1844-06-10">10 June</date>, is about James Baillie&#x2019;s imprisonment for debt: &#x201C;Madam / Knowing Capt<hi rend="italic">n</hi> Baillie some years and understanding you are the only relation he has living, I have taken upon myself unknown to him to acquaint you with his situation it is distressing to me having a large family of my own that it is out of my power to extricate him from his difficulties, but this I can assure you he would have been in want of the common necessaries of life for some weeks past had I not supplied them. I do not know if you are aware of it but he has been in prison since the <date when="1844-03-20">20<hi rend="italic">th</hi> March</date>, for want of a few pounds to take him to the Bench he is obliged to herd with the lowest of the low,&#x2014;in one room with sixty men,&#x2014;and sleeping in a room with five and twenty&#x2014;three weeks since no one expected him to live, the confinement of the place and the closeness of the air has had so great an effect on his naturally consumptive habit that he is only a shadow of what he was, it is the opinion of three medical men that he must die if he does not leave soon.&#x201D; In brief, the person to whom he was indebted, for about &#xa3;35, would give him his discharge if he could find a respectable security and about &#xa3; 10. JWC was referred to G. T. Ferrers, 26 Gt. Pulteney St., Golden Sq., where Baillie had his letters directed; and a reply to the writer could be sent c/o Mr. Banyon, 16 Frith St., Soho Sq. &#x201C;Again I must apologize for the trouble I am giving you but his really destitute condition for not a human being but myself goes near him is shocking in the extreme &#x2026; James Sinclair.&#x201D; JWC seems to mean that the letter was written by or for Baillie&#x2019;s unmarried wife, though in the name of James Sinclair, probably of the Hat and Feathers public house, 45 Gravel Lane, Southwark. George Thomas Ferrers had a wholesale feather and bedding warehouse, and Augustus Banyon was a goldsmith and jeweler.</note>&#x2014;</p></ps>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I lose not a single moment in forwarding you this Letter of Alick&#x2019;s, which I know you have been so long impatiently expecting. It came half an hour ago, by our six-o&#x2019;clock delivery; and now I will put it in <pb id="pg-18-66" n="18:66"/>to be off tomorrow morning, that you may find it lying as you go to the Preaching on Sabbath; it will be a very glad morning&#x2019;s salutation to you, will it not!</p>
<p>You see you were wrong, dear Mother; and Jamie and I were right,&#x2014;as we generally are, in arguing with you! Alick <hi rend="italic">had</hi> been writing at the appointed time; but &#x201C;the Mail went off too early&#x201D; &#x26;c &#x26;c.&#x2014; He has no bad news, none that we can call bad, to send us: the two <foreign>bairns</foreign>, Tom and Jane have got that Country disease, the ague, poor little things;&#x2014;but they make light of that, as he once told us before, in the New Country; we hope they will soon get thro&#x2019;, and be better seasoned against ailments in future perhaps. He has not got any place yet; but is, it seems, in treaty for one: this he has perhaps already got,&#x2014;I on the whole wish he may. At worst, he has leisure and scope now to choose.&#x2014; I find it a very sensible Letter this that poor Alick writes; if he were once fixed on his own soil, and saw but a bed of potatoes springing up for him, he would begin to be much happier.</p>
<p>By this same post I have a Note from Jack, who is at a place called Pilmore House near Darlington (not many miles south of Newcastle): he says he means to be with you &#x201C;early next week.&#x201D; His host is very kind to him; a worthy Mr Rainie whom he knew in Italy:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Rainey.</note> he himself is very well; and will tell you his news, by word of mouth, soon, I hope.&#x2014;</p>
<p>We here continue in our usual state; I still busy, and not entirely making <hi rend="italic">no</hi> progress. The weather is droughty to excess, but very clear and pleasant otherwise; a strong wind blowing now, night and day, from the <hi rend="italic">west</hi>. It promises always rain, but none except mere spittings falls, which are licked up again in half an hour, for the heat also is very great. The hay crop is totally a failure; I saw men mowing today,&#x2014;such swaths as I have seldom seen before. The Parks very generally are getting altogether brown: the &#x201C;green&#x201D; in our Garden has gone all to powder under our feet.&#x2014; &#x2014; Dear Mother, send me word that <hi rend="italic">you</hi> are well, if you can! <closer><salute>No more; but regards to Isabella and Jamie, and blessing on you all.&#x2014; Your affectionate Son,</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name></p>
<ps><p>I write a word to Jack; telling him that Alick&#x2019;s Letter is come;&#x2014;that you expect him soon. You may send the Letter on to Jean, I think; with instructions to have it back again directly for Jack.</p></ps>

<salute>Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Along with your Letter tonight came one to me from Alick,&#x2014;which I have instantly forwarded to our Mother; knowing how intensely anxious she was for it.</p>
<p>It is a long Letter, of very sensible tenor; does not give us conclusively good news, but also none very bad;&#x2014;the two children Tom and Jane had got ague, that was the worst news. It seems the Winter had still been lingering when they set out for Canada; which occasioned delays, hardships of travel, and probably this disease. They do not seem to regard it much there.</p>
<p>Alick had been staying with our Brother John, all this while; the two had ridden and roamed far and wide, but had found it unspeakably difficult to fix: Alick, however, had got so far as to prefer the neighbourhood of Brantford very decidedly to all other localities, and was even on treaty for the purchase of a farm there,&#x2014;agreed all but &#x2018;the price of the crop of this year,&#x2019; which was already sown: if they did <hi rend="italic">not</hi> agree, he had decided to take up house again on his own score, and look <hi rend="italic">deliberately;</hi> as the crops were now all <hi rend="italic">in</hi>, there was no special call for hurry.&#x2014; This, I think, is mostly what his Letter contained. He had received your Letter, &#x2018;forwarded to him from Alton,&#x2019; for which were many warm acknowledgements; two Atlas Newspapers<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably the London <hi rend="italic">Atlas. A General Newspaper and Journal of Literature</hi>.</note> also had reached him from you. He writes energetically, rationally, tho&#x2019; with here and there a tone of gloom, which latter I attribute in good part to his unsettled uncomfortable state of search and expectancy at present. You will see the Letter yourself &#x2018;early next week,&#x2019; if you keep your word; I have warned our Mother to have it ready for you then.</p>
<p>Nothing new has occurred here since you heard last. I am making a little better progress at my Book than when you were here. The drought is altogether excessive; the heat great, tho&#x2019; tempered by a continual brisk west wind.&#x2014; The <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> with &#x201C;York&#x201D; stamped visibly upon it gave me indication that you had not gone by Leeds, as I did not expect you would. You will be very well with your friend Rainy, and old Italian stories. Have you been to Lumley Castle, to Lambton &#x26;c?<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lumley Castle, 6 mi. NNE of Durham, seat of the earls of Scarborough; originally a fortified castle, erected <date when="1389-00-00">1389</date>, it was adapted to domestic use during the reigns of Elizabeth I and George I. Lambton Castle, 2 mi. N of Lumley, residence of the earls of Durham, built <date when="1799-00-00">1799</date>, on the site of the old House of Harraton.</note> I remember those places from the Coach-roof still in a very lively <pb id="pg-18-68" n="18:68"/>way.

There was some minor skirmishing along the Tyne and NW coast, but Leslie did little more than prevent Newcastle from joining other royalist forces in the south. In <date when="1644-04-00">April</date> Leslie joined in besieging Newcastle in York for some nine or ten weeks, when the city was relieved by Prince Rupert. See <hi rend="italic">Cromwell, Works</hi> 6:180, 186.</note> There was no action of consequence; but a &#x2018;canonading&#x2019; at a place called Hilton (near Sunderland), and then another do at a place called Easington between Hartlepool &#x26; Durham (Rushworth V. 616&#x2014;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Nichts, gar nichts zu bedeuten</hi></foreign> [Nothing, nothing at all of importance]).</p>
<p>Mrs Buller has been very unwell since you went away,&#x2014;is now a little better.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>It was with very great pleasure that we received your Letter written from Brother John&#x2019;s the other night. Our impatience to hear something of you was fast growing somewhat unpleasant; our good Mother&#x2019;s had already reached to a continual anxiety. Jamie endeavoured, and Jack and I endeavoured to convince her good heart that the failure of Letters from you was but accident; that you had (as it actually has proved) mistaken the post-day, or some such thing: we silenced her arguments, but her motherly anxieties and secret misgivings there was no silencing. Pray be very punctual in writing <hi rend="italic">every</hi> month, less <pb id="pg-18-69" n="18:69"/>or more! There is no need of filling your sheet; we will take cheerfully the smallest line: but do let us have some line, if it were but one. You know how our good old Mother takes it, in these cases!</p>
<p>Jack has gone out of Town; I despatched your Letter towards Scotsbrig within an hour: I do not know whether any of them will write to you, by this Packet; therefore I will, at any rate, tho&#x2019; in great haste.</p>
<p>Dear Brother, you have had a sad travelling hither and thither; with the two children ill beside you, no wonder your spirits are sometimes low. That is a sad business of the poor <foreign>Bairns</foreign>; we trust to receive better news of them better news of them<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> before long, poor things. Try, whatever you do, to get a <hi rend="italic">dry house</hi>, in a situation airy and remote from swamps! It is really the most indispensable of all the conditions of settlement you have to look after. Spare no pains upon that. Perhaps this thing may be a new monition to you how important it is: if so, poor Tom and little Jane will not have been suffering in vain.&#x2014; Your wanderings up and down Canada, presided over by mere Uncertainty and Interrogation, I can well conceive to be the most unpleasant. It is the one thing that makes a man&#x2019;s lot insupportable, That he cannot know it clearly, cannot give it battle manfully! But it will soon be over, this part of it; once seated on your own soil, with your axe and plough in your hands, a whole jungle of confusions will fall away from you, as it were at once. I am glad you have advanced so far as to ascertain that Brantford district is decidedly the best. Stand by that; your problem is already greatly narrowed. Perhaps you have <hi rend="italic">got</hi> this Farm you were in treaty for? If you refused it, it would be in clear expectations of getting a better in the same region. I clearly applaud your project of <hi rend="italic">purchasing;</hi> a man should anchor himself, especially on land. There is, as you say, less pressure now, no need to be in such haste, the seed being all in for this year. You will at any rate feel much more comfortable in your own house; and have, at worst, due deliberation there. God guide you, my dear Brother! For the rest, be not <hi rend="italic">too</hi> anxious about a choice. Study as you will, no man can make a <hi rend="italic">perfect</hi> choice, he can only do <hi rend="italic">his</hi> best towards that. Really I suppose there are drawbacks and compensations in every place whatever: I should be for choosing a healthy situation, that <hi rend="italic">first;</hi> then good convenient land in small quantity, rather than inferior and inconvenient in large quantity; and above all <hi rend="italic">having</hi> chosen, let it be finished; <foreign>adieu</foreign> to all regrets; look forward then, and not behind at all! There is nothing more fatal to the poor Emigrant, as you wisely <pb id="pg-18-70" n="18:70"/>remark, than that dim groping condition of his; regretting that he did not do otherwise, changing and fluctuating in false hope &#x26;c &#x26;c. Wherever you are, Mother Earth is under you, God&#x2019;s sky above; and a blessing waits on manful constancy there, even there. My dear Brother, I will again with my whole soul wish you a Good Guidance in this choice of yours; and anticipate a great alleviation so soon as you have fairly chosen,&#x2014;well knowing that you have ingenuity in you to make even an imperfect choice available.&#x2014; But now for some news; my sheet is going so fast!</p>
<p>We have had and have a most parched barren year on this side the Sea; very unwholesome for fruits and for living things. Six weeks of the withering east wind, changed only of late days into a strong West, and North-West, as yet without almost a drop of rain. The hay-harvest is ruined, and the barley; all round here is as brown as a fox: much sickness withal. It is partly to the season that I impute the increase of ailments which, I can trace thro&#x2019; their Letters, our dear Mother has been subject to, this Spring. They report her now, and she reports herself, &#x201C;as well as her old usual,&#x201D; but I do not know exactly that it is so. Digestion &#x26;c is not so good, I think:&#x2014;but Jack is gone thitherward now, and will probably do her good. Jamie the other day, reports her as &#x201C;over at the Gill&#x201D;; but your Letter, which would arrive at Scotsbrig yesterday, would bring her back in a hurry again!&#x2014; Jack went off about a fortnight ago, to &#x201C;pay visits,&#x201D; and stroll about; he had got to Darlington lately, to an old Roman friend thereabouts, and meant to be at Scotsbrig &#x201C;on Tuesday or Wednesday.&#x201D; He will probably not stay long there. He is without rest, as yet, poor fellow;&#x2014;you need not surprise yourself if you see him in Canada yet before all is done!&#x2014; Jamie seems to be well, and his farm does better with drought than with wet: I think he knows not what to do when his lease expires. Jamie Austin too, they said, was doing better. Jean and her people are quite right.</p>
<p>Tom Carlyle,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Paternal cousin, son of Francis (<date when="1761-00-00">1761</date>&#x2013;<date when="1819-00-00">1819</date>).</note> the disgraceful <foreign>slut</foreign>, has vanished from Dumfries, leaving debts and even frauds there,&#x2014;gone to Australia, or none knows whither: he too is one of those to be <hi rend="italic">suppressed</hi> from mention!&#x2014; Frank Little, as you would perhaps notice in the <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi>, is off again to New South Wales;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Frank Little, who had emigrated in <date when="1822-00-00">1822</date>; see <ref target="volume-02/lt-18220923-TC-MAC-01"><sic>2:163</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1822-09-23">23 Sept. 1822</date></corr></ref>. The <hi rend="italic">Dumfries and Galloway Courier</hi>, <date when="1844-05-13">13 May</date>, reported a dinner at Ecclefechan in his honor before he left again.</note> I wrote to him to call for me here, but nothing came.&#x2014; As for our two selves here, all is as well as usual. Jane still keeps afoot in spite of the influenzas: I, tho&#x2019; very bilious sometimes, get on better <pb id="pg-18-71" n="18:71"/>with my Book than before, and that consoles me for all things. Jane is for going to Liverpool to see her Uncle, a couple of weeks: I do not yet talk of leaving London at all,&#x2014;so ill did my work speed for a long while. We are an awful <foreign><hi rend="italic">brattle</hi></foreign> [noisy confusion] here; 150,000 strangers this month, rushing along as if Devils drove them! I keep well out of it here; as well as I can.</p>
<p>John Sterling, of whom you have heard me speak as a dear friend, is dangerously sick; a terrible attack in the lungs, spitting of blood &#x26;c; his friends seem to have the worst apprehensions. One Scott too, Irving&#x2019;s old Assistant, is understood to be in a dangerous state,&#x2014;a good fellow he too, and a brave-struggling, tho&#x2019; with little uccess!&#x2014; Dear Brother, you see I must end. I wonder if they would not let one write to Canada in a <hi rend="italic">cover</hi>, by the half-ounce; that would be handier: I will inquire! <closer><salute>May we hear good news of Jane &#x26; Tom,&#x2014;our love to them, poor things. Ever yours,</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name></p>
<ps><p>Jane&#x2019;s regards to Jenny and you and all of you <supplied>[who]</supplied><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> are not mentioned; but they may be confidently understood. <foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Brother. God bless you.</p>
<p>You will not neglect my kind regards to John Carlyle and Peggy.

<salute>Dear Jean,</salute>
<p>Here is a Letter just come from Alick, which I am to forward to you. It had gone up to Darlington where Jack now is; he has sent it back to me with instructions to send it in all haste to Dumfries, as a bit of good news;&#x2014;you, in the next to despatch it to Scotsbrig without loss of a moment!</p>
<p>There had another Letter come to myself, which is now at Scotsbrig since yesterday; it was of some ten days earlier date; and announced poor Alick as still in a <hi rend="italic">seeking</hi> state, two of his children ill of ague, and otherwise things rather uncomfortable with him: all which, as you will see by this present Letter, is now happily altered.</p>
<p>I am very glad to figure poor Alick as settled in his own house at last, and fairly beginning the world again. It seems to me farther to <pb id="pg-18-72" n="18:72"/>argue well for him that he has bought a neat <hi rend="italic">little</hi> handy Farm with his money,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alexander&#x2019;s son Thomas later wrote in his journal: &#x201C;We eventually decided to purchase Bield, 4&#xBD; miles west of Brantford, paying &#x24;20 an acre cash, with the growing crop thrown in. Here we all lived for many years and were modestly successful as farmers, and what was of most importance, led, on the whole, contented, industrious lives.&#x201D; John Carlyle, son of this Thomas, states in his &#x201C;Family History&#x201D; that in <date when="1849-00-00">1849</date> Alexander increased his original holding of 102 acres to 180 acres by purchasing the farm across the road, and in <date when="1857-00-00">1857</date> built on that property the brick cottage that he and his wife lived in for the rest of their days and that their grand-children always knew as Bield (Marrs 597).</note> rather than a big unhandy and unmanageable one: his fault, in all things hitherto, lay on the side opposite to that. Let us hope that better days are now coming for him.</p>
<p>Jack went off about a fortnight ago: to see George Johnstone the Surgeon, in Gloucestershire; that was his first movement He has gone since to visit the Roman Friend near Darlington, of whom, I think, we heard last year: he is to be &#x201C;taken up by Jamie and the Gig at the Galls Loaning,&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A loaning is a lane; probably the crossroads at Gullyland farm, 2 mi. S of Scotsbrig on the main Carlisle-to-Ecclefechan road.</note> on Wednesday Ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi> first, so that you will soon see him and hear his news! Our good Mother, it seems, was over at Gill; but this, and Alick&#x2019;s other Letter, will bring her home, I guess. Pray let not the second Letter linger; you know how glad she will be of it.&#x2014;</p>
<p>I am at <hi rend="italic">a Chapter</hi> today, and taking a kind of half holiday! I am getting on a thought better, tho&#x2019; bilious enough. Jane salutes you all, as I do. <closer><salute>Ever your affectionate /</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name></p>

Mazzini had discovered that his letters were being opened at the London post office, from the beginning of <date when="1844-03-00">March</date>, resealed and the postmark altered, on the orders of Sir James Graham, the home sec. As Mazzini wrote to his mother, <date when="1844-06-21">21 June</date>, &#x201C;as soon as I had the proofs, decided to put an end to the matter, and together with some of the individuals whose letters to me had been opened, presented a petition to Parliament, stating how our letters were illegally detained &#x2026; and read; that we were ready to give proofs of our assertions, and therefore requested justice and remedy from the House&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Mazzini&#x2019;s Letters</hi>, trans. A. de R. Jervis [<date when="1930-00-00">1930</date>] 90). Thomas Duncombe (<date when="1796-00-00">1796</date>&#x2013;<date when="1861-00-00">1861</date>; <ref target="volume-18/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/8239"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>) presented the petition, <date when="1844-06-14">14 June</date>. In reply Graham admitted authorizing the action but refused to give reasons except necessities of state policy. Mazzini went home and immediately wrote to JWC: &#x201C;Thank you for your note, and Carlyle for his noble-and-warm-hearted decision,&#x201D; no doubt to write to the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>. &#x201C;The petition for immediate redress and appointment of a Committee to inquire has been put off &#x2026; by the majority. Sir James Graham declared that the thing was perfectly true, but that an old act of Government &#x2026; empowered a Secretary of State to open letters, with an express warrant. After these few words, he did never utter a single word. Duncombe &#x2026; and &#x2026; others spoke, without getting any answer. &#x2026; The <hi rend="italic">dumb</hi> majority voted for Sir James Graham, and all was over. There was not a single spark of life&#x2014;a single feeling of honour&#x2014;a single instinct of noble ideas &#x2026; throughout the House. Within two days, the Continental press will laugh upon <hi rend="italic">English liberty</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">loyalty;</hi> but no body appeared to think of that. We shall see what the newspapers of to-morrow will say. Up to now, my only wish was to make this thing known, and it is fulfilled.&#x201D; On <date when="1844-06-17">Mon., 17 June</date>, the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> in a leading article said that the affair was &#x201C;unconstitutional, un-English, and ungenerous. &#x2026; And, truly, there was cause for indignation. The Home-office was arraigned for a treacherous breach of faith, which it was hardly credible could be charged upon the English Executive. Hitherto, it has been the peculiar boast of England that she is not as other countries, that her citizens are not liable to the same petty persecutions, the same rigorous police, the same insidious and incessant watching, the same dogging of their foot-steps, opening of their letters, and prying into cabinets as harass the subjects of continental states. But this boast cannot now be uttered with justice. The national <hi rend="italic">prestige</hi> has gone. &#x2026; Mr. M<hi rend="small-caps">azzini&#x2019;s</hi> character and habits and society are nothing to the point, unless connected with some certain or probable evidence of evil intentions or treasonable plots. We know nothing, and care nothing about him. He may be the most worthless and the most vicious creature in the world. But this is no reason of itself why his letters should be detained and opened.&#x201D;</sourceNote><head>
<person type="sender">TC</person> TO <person type="addressee">THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES</person>
</head><docBody>
<p><salute>Sir,&#x2014;</salute>In your observations in yesterday&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> on the late disgraceful affair of Mr. Mazzini&#x2019;s letters and the Secretary of State, you mention <pb id="pg-18-73" n="18:73"/>that Mr. Mazzini is entirely unknown to you, entirely indifferent to you; and add, very justly, that if he were the most contemptible of mankind, it would not affect your argument on the subject.</p>
<p>It may tend to throw farther light on this matter if I now certify you, which I in some sort feel called upon to do, that Mr. Mazzini is not unknown to various competent persons in this country; and that he is very far indeed from being contemptible&#x2014;none farther, or very few of living men. I have had the honour to know Mr. Mazzini for a series of years; and, whatever I may think of his practical insight and skill in worldly affairs, I can with great freedom testify to all men that he, if I have ever seen one such, is a man of genius and virtue, a man of sterling veracity, humanity, and nobleness of mind, one of those rare men, numerable unfortunately but as units in this world, who are worthy to be called martyr-souls; who, in silence, piously in their daily life, understand and practise what is meant by that. Of Italian democracies and young Italy&#x2019;s sorrows, of extraneous Austrian Emperors in Milan, or poor old chimerical Popes in Bologna, I know nothing, and desire to know nothing;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >An echo of the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>.</note> but this other thing I do know, and can here declare publicly to be a fact, which fact all of us that have occasion to comment on Mr. Mazzini and his affairs may do well to take along with us, as a thing leading towards new clearness, and not towards new additional darkness, regarding him and them.</p>
<p>Whether the extraneous Austrian Emperor and miserable old <pb id="pg-18-74" n="18:74"/>chimera of a Pope shall maintain themselves in Italy, or be obliged to decamp from Italy, is not a question in the least vital to Englishmen.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mazzini accused the govt. of telling the Neapolitan govt. (supported by the pope and Austrians) what he wrote. Later investigation showed that while his charges were mainly true, no information about individuals had been passed on.</note> But it is a question vital to us that sealed letters in an English post-office be, as we all fancied they were, respected as things sacred; that opening of men&#x2019;s letters, a practice near of kin to picking men&#x2019;s pockets, and to other still viler and far fataler forms of scoundrelism, be not resorted to in England, except in cases of the very last extremity. When some new Gunpowder Plot<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The aborted plot of a few Roman Catholics to blow up James VI and I along with the lords and commons in parliament, <date when="1605-11-05">5 Nov. 1605</date>.</note> may be in the wind, some double-dyed high treason, or imminent national wreck not avoidable otherwise, then let us open letters: not till then. To all Austrian Kaisers and such like, in their time of trouble, let us answer, as our fathers from of old have answered:&#x2014;Not by such means is help here for you. Such means, allied to picking of pockets and viler forms of scoundrelism, are not permitted in this country for your behoof. The right hon. Secretary does himself detest such, and even is afraid to employ them. He dare not: it would be dangerous for him! All British men that might chance to come in view of such a transaction, would incline to spurn it, and trample on it, and indignantly ask him, what he meant by it!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mazzini wrote to his mother, <date when="1844-06-21">21 June</date>, that &#x201C;without my having seen him or requested such a thing, Carlyle wrote to <hi rend="italic">The Times</hi> a letter of which I transcribe the first part for your satisfaction. &#x2026; / Carlyle, for his honesty and talent, is regarded here as some kind of power, and this letter is therefore important&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Mazzini&#x2019;s Letters</hi>, 91&#x2013;92).</note></p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I wrote to you only yesterday; and today, you may justly wonder what more I can have to say!&#x2014; Last night there came a Note from Jack, and along with it your <hi rend="italic">Second</hi> Letter, which quite alters the figure of your affairs for us; this fact too I thought it good to apprise you of, as a comfort to your mind till you hear of us again.</p>
<p>We are all very glad, my dear Brother, to learn that you have actually got a bit of Earth that you can call your own; and are now seated by a hearth which is <hi rend="italic">yours</hi>,&#x2014;were it under your vine and fig-tree, or even under the poorest thorn and bramble, this is an immense comfort to a man! So far as we can understand the affair, moreover, you seem to have decided with true wisdom. A small handy farm, near to a school, to a high road, to the only friends you yet have in Canada: all this is certainly infinitely preferable to some large tract of wild inarable land, destitute of these advantages. I for my share will take it as a good omen that you have made this choice. The only fault we all used to allege against you was, that you had a tendency towards the <hi rend="italic">cheap</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">large</hi> rather than towards the really good and small; I believe it is a real fault, and leads to very noxious results: but here you have entirely taken farewell of that,&#x2014;and decided I do believe like a wise man, awake to the other side of the question! The poor <foreign>Bairns</foreign> too are got better, and &#x2018;like to eat you out of house and hold&#x2019;; long may it continue so. All goes better in this Letter than in the former one. Our Brother John &#x2018;helping you to put in your barley&#x2019;; you yourself &#x2018;making three bed-steads&#x2019;; it is all very cheerful to us, tho&#x2019; full of toil and exertion. You contemplate a hard struggle for a while; but there are better omens now than there ever were. Not an honest stroke you put upon your Property there, but it will remain to you and yours. God&#x2019;s Earth is an <hi rend="italic">honest</hi> taskmistress; and you have now her to appeal to mainly. She says, &#x201C;Behave wisely, behave manfully, with patience, with industry, with real veracious endeavour; and I will reward thee!&#x201D;</p>
<p>What do you call the place?<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Bield, meaning shelter.</note> Or has it yet got any name? You must try to give it a good one! And explain all to us, very minutely, so that on a Map we may be able to find it, and picture it out for ourselves. But, for all this there will be ample time by and by, and <pb id="pg-18-76" n="18:76"/>we shall see it gradually.&#x2014; Your Letters have really good insight in them about Transatlantic affairs. I would recommend you not to spare writing down whatsoever thing you do see into there: such things deserve to stand on paper; the putting of them down may tend, more than you think, to good in all ways.</p>
<p>I sent on the Letter to Dumfries yesternight, with orders to forward instantly to Ecclefechan: Jack had already written to our Mother, imparting to her the outline of the better news. He was to get home by Carlisle, &#x201C;next Wednesday&#x201D; (precisely, <hi rend="italic">tomorrow</hi>), Jamie to take him up at the &#x201C;Galls Loaning.&#x201D; He bids me say that he will very speedily write to you, but is in a bad post-country, and too full of general botheration, to do it at present.</p>
<p>I am not sure, on reflexion, if I have not aggravated to you my own impression of our dear old Mother&#x2019;s rather more than usually ailing situation this Season. I impute it very much to the noxious weather. Our Doctor will tell us better about it when there, we hope. Jane sends you her love. I my blessing to one and all of you once more. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Brother. Ever your affectionate,</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name></p>

<salute>Dear Mrs Mackenzie,</salute>
<p>My Wife is in despair that we had to go away yesterday a little &#x201C;after 4&#x201D; before seeing you. We met you on the King&#x2019;s Road, at least so she imagined; but it was too late before the vehicles could stop. Your cards were all lying, a melancholy memorial, when we returned!</p>
<p>I am afraid I shall not be able to get up, tomorrow, to see your French-Indian Member of the Satanic School.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Identified on the MS, in an unknown hand, as &#x201C;General Avitabile of Peshawar.&#x201D; From Naples, once a lieut, in Napoleon&#x2019;s artillery, he was gov. of Peshawar under the Sikhs. Mackenzie had met him there, <date when="1840-00-00">1840</date>, and described him in detail as &#x201C;a man of great talent and dauntless determination, but capricious, somewhat cruel, and most unscrupulous in increasing his already large fortune by heavy fines. &#x2026; A tall, burly man, ordinarily apparelled in a magnificently-laced Horse-Artillery jacket, wide crimson Turkish trousers drawn in at the ankle, a golden girdle, and very handsome sabre; his large Jewish features and bronzed countenance adorned with fierce mustachios, which look like twisted bayonets, and a thick gray beard;&#x2014;the whole surmounted by a gold-laced forage cap, which he never takes off.&#x201D; The Mackenzies held a dinner party in his honor when &#x201C;no less than five languages were spoken&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Storms and Sunshine of a Soldier&#x2019;s Life</hi> 1:130, 2:5).</note> I will come up to tea if I can; but you are not to wait for me.

The <hi rend="italic">letter-question</hi> will not be let go to sleep God willing and in the course of discussion it is possible that new impertinences may <supplied>[be]</supplied> uttered against Mazzini distinct individual charges made&#x2014;a murder or two, got up&#x2014;&#x26;c&#x2014;which those who are best acquainted with <hi rend="italic">the facts</hi> may feel themselves called on to confute. But for the present, you are to observe, that the offensive words respecting him in <hi rend="italic">The Times</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1844-06-17">17 June</date>.</note> were in the shape of <hi rend="italic">an hypothesis</hi> merely, and thrown out, so far as the writer meant us to understand, for the sake of the argument. These have been effectually answered by a man who has first of all the merit of being <hi rend="small-caps">english</hi> (or <hi rend="italic">scotch</hi> at least which is all the same) and who has besides a reputation for <hi rend="italic">veracity</hi>&#x2014;and is known to keep himself clear of all political factions&#x2014; A better testimony&#x2014;I mean a more <hi rend="small-caps">credible</hi> one, I do not think could have been possibly given to Mazzinis worth&#x2014;so that any further vindication just now would seem superfluous, and from the part of <hi rend="italic">Young</hi> <hi rend="small-caps">italy</hi> or any aged <hi rend="italic">Italy</hi> I should fear that it would <hi rend="italic">provoke</hi> attacks on him rather than <hi rend="italic">prevent</hi> them.</p>
<p>But I shall see you at the Concert<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For the Italian Free School, <date when="1844-06-20">20 June</date>.</note> and&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">talk</hi> of this which may save the Austrian Embassy the trouble of deciphering an unreasonably long note.</p>

<salute>Dear Grant,</salute>
<p>Many thanks for your remembrance of us: you should come down in spite of the sick head; the sight of old friends would do it good.&#x2014; I hope something from this German Spa; and still more from the six months of better climate,&#x2014;six months of freedom from London tumult and hard work, in any climate.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Yerba</hi> has been theoretically known to me for some time, as Dr. Francia&#x2019;s favourite.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Yerba mat&#xE9;, a Paraguayan tea; see &#x201C;Dr. Francia,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 29:297, 320.</note> We are to make an infusion of it this Night, and try whether it does resemble the taste of incidental &#x201C;twine chewed in the mouth,&#x201D; or some more exhilarating substance!</p>
<p>My poor <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> gets along in the sorrowfullest manner; weighed down by my own stupidity, and the general funded stupidity of England, such as we have been accumulating on him for these two hundred years. I <supplied>[am]</supplied><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> in general despair of ever making a Book of Cromwell; yet I never entirely give it up,&#x2014;and in fact must do it or do worse.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Goethe</hi> you gave me long since has been framed and conspicuously hung up here, and meets with great approval from judges: unfortunately the Frame-maker has entirely clipt away the Painters or Engraver&#x2019;s name;&#x2014;of which, I am afraid, you kept no remembrance more than I?&#x2014;</p>
<p>The Post-Office affair is abundantly scandalous. I wish they would get up some meeting or demonstration about it, in the City or elsewhere; I think all men ought to denounce it, according to their opportunity, and damn it, and declare that they would not endure it.&#x2014;</p>
<p>W<closer><salute>ell, a right happy journey to you, dear Grant: come back soon, and report that it has healed you!&#x2014;</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Jamie,</salute>
<p>Your man Thomas Bell, of the Wylie-hole Bells,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Wylie (Wyllie) Hole farm, Tundergarth parish, 3 mi. E of Lockerbie. Thomas unidentified.</note> called here with your Letter the other day: I recognised his face as belonging to the kindred, and for what I remembered of old days was very willing to do him some service if I could. His Father, I could not but remember, ran about the <foreign>braes</foreign> in boyhood, with my Father!&#x2014; I was very <foreign>wae</foreign> to look at him, poor creature, and to think how he has been sailing about these ten years, with a surgeon&#x2019;s diploma in his pocket, and I daresay good enough skill in his head, at so very low a rate of wages.&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; I gave him no hope of my being able to assist him: but in the meanwhile I am trying what I can do among certain Indian friends of mine; and it is perhaps possible that something in his favour either now or afterwards may turn up.</p>
<p>Now I want to know from you very distinctly what kind of man this Thomas Bell, as to moral character and behaviour, is;&#x2014;especially if you can <hi rend="italic">certify</hi> me as to these two things, That he has nothing to do <hi rend="italic">with drinking whisky</hi>, nothing <hi rend="italic">with telling lies</hi>. Certain of his Brothers, I think, went to destruction in both these ways?<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably George Bell; see <ref target="volume-05/lt-18300319-TC-JAC-01"><sic>5:78</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1830-03-19">19 March 1830</date></corr></ref>.</note> This one has a fair appearance: but it would quicken my interest in him if I knew for certain his solidity in these particulars,&#x2014;as certainly all pleading for him or recommending of him on my part ought to be instantly abandoned if it be <hi rend="italic">known</hi> that he falls short in these.&#x2014; Certify me about him, therefore, all that you can. Perhaps Park<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably James Park, baker, of Ecclefechan; see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18360223-TCJWC-JAC-01"><sic>8:306</sic><corr>TCJWC to JAC, <date when="1836-02-23">23 Feb. 1836</date></corr></ref>.</note> or some trustworthy individual has known the man; perhaps in some way you may be able to attain a conviction to yourself about him. As the Doctor is beside you at present, he will write when you have examined. And the sooner the better; for I am to hear something on a certain side relative to him, in about a week hence.</p>
<p>This is all I had to write today. The Doctor, to whom I must answer a Note of last night, will give you the rest of my news or no-news. I am very glad of two things: That Isabella seems somewhat stronger (such is John&#x2019;s report of her); and that the drought has done you no harm. We are all burnt brown with it here, and have had no effectual <pb id="pg-18-81" n="18:81"/>rain yet, in fact hardly anything worthy to be called a good shower.&#x2014; You would be right glad of Sandy&#x2019;s news too!&#x2014;</p>
<closer><salute>Your affectionate Brother /</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name>
<ps><p>Of course, to avoid disappointments, you need not whisper anything of my hope there may be for poor Bell; which indeed I fear is but faint at any rate.</p></ps>

<salute>Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Your Note came last evening after Post hours; I had some thoughts to have written to Jamie before, but confused interruptions had intervened.</p>
<p>I had written to Alick before I got your former Note; and directly after, I wrote to him a second time, announcing the arrival of his good news. There is every reason. I think, to augur good from this settlement of Alick&#x2019;s: a small good farm at a dear rate, this if it be a fault is directly in the teeth of his former habit of faults: I believe indeed he has done very wisely in the matter.</p>
<p>You do not send me good accounts of my dear Mother; especially I should desire a more minute account. Surely your medical skill may effect something, in the way of ordering diet &#x26;c, in this case; surely no case came or will ever come before you in which you will be more willing to help! Pray exert your best industry: I am convinced much good might be done by improvement in our Mother&#x2019;s dietetics, which have always seemed to me very negligent and faulty. She will obey you faithfully, will she not? Tell her I command her to obey her own Medical Man!&#x2014;</p>
<p>All last week I have been fretted to pieces with confusions and excitations of various kinds. I had to go out twice to dinner: still worse, I had to write a Letter to the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> about Mazzini and the opening of his Letters by Sir James Graham,&#x2014;and set all the world a-clattering about it and me. I got next to no work of my own done. Do you get the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> still? If you have not seen that Letter, I will try to find some copy of it for you yet. I design to stir no farther in the matter; it is not specially my trade but other people&#x2019;s.</p>
<p>Jane is going off to Liverpool for two weeks tomorrow morning, to see her Uncle, and other Lancashire friends. She will not go farther. I <pb id="pg-18-82" n="18:82"/>mean to keep myself as still as a mouse within its hole, and see whether I cannot do something in my own way in the interim. It is of no use for me to run up and down seeking a place of rest; there is none for me. I must stay here; and in about a month now all the hurlyburly will roll itself off elsewhither and I shall hope to be very quiet here.&#x2014; You can perhaps assist Jamie in his inquiries about Bell the Surgeon. I sent him to Dr Willis;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. Robert Willis (<date when="1799-00-00">1799</date>&#x2013;<date when="1878-00-00">1878</date>; <ref target="volume-18/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/29585"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), librarian of the College of Surgeons: see <ref target="volume-07/lt-18341224-TC-MAC-01"><sic>7:357</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1834-12-24">24 Dec. 1834</date></corr></ref>.</note> but have no hope there.</p>

<salute>Dearest,</salute>
<p>I hope you are safe in Liverpool; may a Note of some kind, two hours hence, teach me so much!&#x2014; I infer also that you are getting a wet day: do not blame Lancashire for it; we have it here too,&#x2014;most welcome after the fierce heat of yesterday: this is a regular day of lazy but steadfast rain, I saw in the morning an air of &#x201C;real business&#x201D; on the face of it.</p>
<p>My news, poor Necessary Evil,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >One of TC&#x2019;s nicknames for her; cf. <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister&#x2019;s Apprenticeship, Works</hi> 23:288.</note> are nothing! I have not spoken one word since thy departure; I already feel wonderfully composed by such silence; a silence full of all manner of thoughts, sad and earnest It does one real good,&#x2014;as you know I always believe.</p>
<p>On coming out from the Railway Office after loss of you yesterday, I discovered&#x2014;that my Neat Fly had rolled off! Off without return; I had not told it to wait. I got upon an omnibus; rode outside, in my slippers; paid Mrs Nodes<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Elizabeth Nodes, stablekeeper, 21 Manor St.</note> and her astonished Fly-man, as I came past; worked afterwards at Cromwell in a small way all day,&#x2014;dined at 4, walked at 10.

<p><salute>Poor Goodykin!</salute> What a wretched passage to the North: and I fancied you all the day sitting sad indeed, but still, and growing ever more composed by the sight of the kind green Earth, in the front of the rail-carriage there!&#x2014; You must really get sleep; take all pains to be quiet, and secure some sleep, or you will spoil everything.</p>
<p>I have had a day of insignificant stupid labour again (tea to breakfast about <hi rend="italic">seven</hi>, being very bilious), and must now be off for a little exercise, and to &#x2018;leave cards,&#x2019; at the Lord Stanley&#x2019;s &#x26;c,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lord Stanley and Maria Josepha, b. Holroyd (<date when="1771-00-00">1771</date>&#x2013;<date when="1863-00-00">1863</date>), Lady Stanley, parents of E. J. Stanley. Lady Stanley did not much care for TC, and according to her Lord Stanley&#x2019;s interest in and liking for him waned over the years; see <hi rend="italic">The Ladies of Alderley</hi>, ed. N. Mitford (<date when="1938-00-00">1938</date>) 52, which quotes a letter of Lady Stanley to Henrietta Stanley (wrongly dated <date when="1843-05-03">3 May 1843</date>) about a visit from TC, saying that Lord Stanley &#x201C;began by fancying rather than finding some grains of corn in all the chaff &#x2026; but he is ending utterly disgusted. Surely he will shut up at last; not my Lord but the Monomaniac.&#x201D;</note> the burden of which duty is really lying heavy on me. This day is clear-grey, cool <pb id="pg-18-86" n="18:86"/>and very beautiful; a day on which one can walk. Thank Heaven for the rain</p>
<p>Nobody has called here, and I wish nobody to call. I am much better &#x2018;in a place by mysel&#x2019;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350128-TC-JCA-01"><sic>8:21</sic><corr>TC to JCA, <date when="1835-01-28">28 Jan. 1835</date></corr></ref>.</note> at present. I have a cartload of Books on the floor about me, and work forever.</p>
<p>Ellen is very busy and quiet. I am to dine today again on <hi rend="italic">cold-boiled</hi>, bought out of the shop. She is cleaning your bedroom these two days, has the carpet now on the green &#x26;c. No &#x2018;Numbers&#x2019;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Either musical numbers from next door or visiting servant girls.</note> have troubled us hitherto. Poor Mrs Lambert, she tells me, is in bed; the Deceased old person being <hi rend="italic">her</hi> mother.</p>
<p>I saw Mrs Buller last night; also Lady Harriet,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Baring, whose country place was Addiscombe, nr. Croyden.</note> by whom I am invited with Charles Buller to their place in the Country on Saturday. C. and I are to go together. Mrs Buller looks considerably improved, tho&#x2019; still very weak. Miss B&#xF6;lte was there too,&#x2014;just finishing off an engagement to go to Italy with the Bullers! All parties seem to be heartily delighted at it, as I was, and as you will be. She had not seen Mrs Macready<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Whom she had thought of as an employer the previous summer.</note> Mrs Strachey considers that there &#x201C;has been a Special Providence in it.&#x201D;&#x2014; Lady Graham appears to be an entire goose: one of the crimes of poor B&#xF6;lte was that when the children asked her, &#x201C;What the Holy Ghost was like?&#x201D; she said with all circumspection, she could not tell! Can you?&#x2014; Mrs Buller (observe that, you little <foreign>Cutty!</foreign>) had strictly charged everybody not to whisper a word of Sir James Graham&#x2019;s proceedings to B&#xF6;lte. Charles confessed he had &#x201C;told Lady Harriet,&#x201D; but under oath of secrecy. Of course all the world will know it.&#x2014; Buller had been too ill for speaking;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In the House of Commons on the subject of Mazzini&#x2019;s letters.</note> he says the business is by no means done yet.

<p><salute>Thanks Dearest for your note and the newspaper,</salute> which was the best part of my breakfast this morning&#x2014;not that I had &#x201C;lost my happityte&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;A patient in the York Asylum (country attorney, I was told), a small, shrivelled, elderly man, sat dining among others, being perfectly harmless, at the governor&#x2019;s table. He ate pretty fairly; but every minute or two inconsolably flung down his knife and fork, stretched out his palms, and twisting his poor countenance into utter woe, gave a low pathetic howl: &#x2018;I&#x2019;ve la-ast mi happetayte!&#x2019; The wretchedest scarecrow of humanity I almost ever saw, who had found <hi rend="italic">his</hi> &#x2018;immeasurable of misery&#x2019; in that particular &#x2018;loss&#x2019;! Date would be autumn <date when="1819-00-00">1819</date>; my first visit to England&#x2014;not farther south than York as yet&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note in <hi rend="italic">LM;</hi> the true date was <date when="1820-10-00">Oct. 1820</date>).</note>&#x2014; I slept much better last night&#x2014;in spite of cocks of every variety of power, a dog, and a considerable rumblement of carts! but the evil of these things was not doubled and tripled for me by the reflection that <hi rend="small-caps">you</hi> were being kept awake by them and what individual evil there was in them could not get the better of my excessive weariedness. I feel as if the outdoor sounds should not lay hold of my imagination for all the time I am likely to be exposed to them&#x2014;and within doors all is quiet enough and they let me go to bed whenever I like They are all as kind and considerate as possible even my uncle who did not use to make any practical admission that there was such a thing as irritable nerves in the world&#x2014; I suppose his own illness has taught him sympathy in this matter&#x2014; I find him looking fully better than I expected&#x2014;and he does not seem to me worse at walking than when I saw him last&#x2014;his speech is the worst thing&#x2014;so thick that I have great difficulty in catching what he says without making him repeat&#x2014;but this seems as much the result of the loss of his teeth which he has not supplied as of anything else They complain much of his temper but I have not seen the slightest trace of ill temper in him since I came except for a moment yesterday during dinner&#x2014;when he said some very sharp words to Jeannie&#x2014;who provoked them in the first instance and resented them in the second in a way that quite astonished <hi rend="italic">me</hi> who had never seen her otherwise than imperturbably good natured&#x2014; I am afraid my Babbie has been <hi rend="italic">deteriorating</hi> in these latter times&#x2014;she looks most painfully indolent, and <hi rend="italic">young-ladyish</hi>&#x2014; I have got into no free communication with her yet&#x2014;alone with me she is the same gentle sweet Babbie as ever&#x2014;but <hi rend="italic">impenetrable</hi>. I shall find out what is at the bottom of all this by and by&#x2014; Helen is grown more like my Aunt Jeannie in all respects <pb id="pg-18-88" n="18:88"/>a higher praise one cannot give her&#x2014; The one that pleases me least of all is Alick&#x2014;his Toryism is perfectly insupportable&#x2014;seems to be awakening reaction even in my uncle!&#x2014;even the letter-business<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Sir James Graham&#x2019;s opening of the Mazzini correspondence, for behoof of Pope and Kaiser on which I had written something to the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note in <hi rend="italic">LM</hi>).</note> Alick defends because it is the Ministers&#x2019; pleasure!&#x2014;not so my uncle, for whom <hi rend="italic">your letter</hi> had set the thing in its right light and who honestly confesses with all devotion to the Powers that be, that &#x201C;where such things are doing there must come <hi rend="italic">a break-down!</hi>&#x201D;</p>
<p>I have not written to M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Paulet yet&#x2014;a letter from Geraldine which was lying for me here informed me that she (M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Paulet) had been <hi rend="italic">salivated</hi> thro&#x2019; mistake&#x2014;her D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> in <hi rend="italic">meaning</hi> to give her ipechacuhana four times a day had been giving her mercury to that extent!

<p><salute>Thanks, Dearest, for your good Little Letter and the good news it brings.</salute> None of your noises annoy <hi rend="italic">me</hi>,&#x2014;I am far enough off, and quiet <pb id="pg-18-89" n="18:89"/>enough too, for that matter!

<p><hi rend="italic">How</hi> unhappy am I to be, you little gypsy? I suppose I am about unhappy enough at present.

Did not get in again till far too late,&#x2014;towards six, in fact. Dined on tough greasy corned-beef odious to the soul,&#x2014;had taken a pill, took punch, fell asleep, continued sleeping after tea was brought in,&#x2014;was at last awoke by Helen about half past eight; tea cold, and night setting in! You know the rest; the creature took to working again, continued that, after a sort, till past one. Breakfast this morning at half past 7 again; and here we are!&#x2014; The Story of Panizzi Ma&#x2019;am is that.</p>
<p>The reason of my lateness yesterday was accidental. I had one errand, to call at the Dover-Street Stanleys&#x2019;;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lord and Lady Stanley at 40 Dover St., Piccadilly, rather than E. J. and Henrietta Stanley, 2 Grosvenor Cres., Belgrave Sq.</note> ordering shop-goods by the way. Near Belgrave Square, Anthony Sterling put his arm in mine; volunteered to walk with me. At Dover-Street, blessing Heaven, I found <hi rend="italic">a card</hi> suffice: there remained ten minutes to spare. I turn, still with Anthony, to the Library,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The London Library, 57 Pall Mall.</note> having half a word to speak there. At the door we find W<hi rend="italic">m</hi> Cunningham who will not let me go till &#x201C;I have looked at his Picture;&#x2014;half a minute will do!&#x201D;&#x2014; Yes, but it turns out to need a shilling also and I determine on glancing over the Gallery at large for my money!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The annual exhibit at the British Inst., Pall Mall, of Old Masters and deceased British artists, which opened <date when="1844-06-10">10 June</date>. William Coningham&#x2019;s picture &#x201C;Our Saviour in the Gardens of Gethsemane,&#x201D; was described by the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, <date when="1844-06-15">15 June</date>, as &#x201C;a curious and elaborate specimen of the earlier style of Raffaelle &#x2026; , a study for the admirers of the great painter.&#x201D; The <hi rend="italic">Athenaeum</hi>, <date when="1844-06-22">22 June</date>, noted &#x201C;a new <hi rend="italic">Raffael</hi>, bought of late by an enterprising British amateur, W. Coningham, Esq., from an obscure Roman collection, that of the deceased Prince Gabrielli. We congratulate its individual, and its national, possessor&#x2014;the latter of whom, with a million eyes, we hope will see its worth, without looking through our spectacles.&#x201D;</note> Thus you see&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;<foreign>Oim&#xE8;</foreign> [Alas]!</p>
<p>Cunningham&#x2019;s Raphael is very excellent, gem-like as you say: but I think I should be very rich to give <hi rend="italic">one</hi> thousand for it. The Correggio Christ is all you called it too: a think<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> to be cut into pork-sausages if one found it alive. These Christs in Picture-Galleries are a real nuisance. The Reynolds Portraits were about as good to me as anything <pb id="pg-18-90" n="18:90"/>else I saw.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Athenaeum</hi>, <date when="1844-06-29">29 June</date>, was of the opinion that &#x201C;even Sir Joshua calls upon us rather for excuses than encomiums: several of his works now exhibited seem early or imperfect attempts&#x2014;some may have been mere experiments.&#x201D; Sir Joshua Reynolds (<date when="1723-00-00">1723</date>&#x2013;<date when="1792-00-00">92</date>), portrait painter. None of the reviews mentions the Correggio picture of Christ, nor according to the catalog was one exhibited.</note> Cunningham, in a proud shy way, asked me to dine with him on Saturday: &#x201C;Already engaged&#x201D;; to which Anthony kindly added that I was the most dyspeptic of all animals.</p>
<p>Coming along, before meeting Cunningham, we came athwart Empson<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Empson.</note> in St James&#x2019;s Street; melancholy, in a white hat too big for him. I thought of stopping, but he evidently did not see. A few yards farther on came a brougham,&#x2014;and your venerable lover,<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edward Sterling.</note> really in a very woe-begone state; who saluted eagerly.

<p><salute>Dearest&#x2014;</salute>I had only time to address a newspaper yesterday&#x2014;not that it takes much time to write such rags of notes as I send you&#x2014;but yesterday before I had got myself thoroughly awake, which one does somehow with an admirable deliberation in this house&#x2014;every one coming <pb id="pg-18-91" n="18:91"/>down to breakfast half asleep and continuing half-asleep till they go to bed again&#x2014;it was intimated to me that I must get ready to go with my Uncle and <hi rend="italic">four</hi> of the others on an excursion in an open carriage. And accordingly I had some twenty miles of driving thro very pretty country&#x2014;and saw a &#x201C;beautifullest village in all England,&#x201D; called <hi rend="italic">Hale</hi>, which is one of the Lions here&#x2014;where there is the grave of some human phenomenon called <hi rend="italic">The Child of Hale</hi>&#x2014;did you ever hear of him?<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In the township of Hale, Lancs., ca. 10 mi. SE of Liverpool, John Middleton, or the Child of Hale (<date when="1578-00-00">1578</date>&#x2013;<date when="1623-00-00">1623</date>), reputedly nine ft., three ins. tall. He was taken to London &#x201C;in a costly and fantastical dress&#x201D; and presented at King James&#x2019;s court (J. Corry, <hi rend="italic">The History of Lancashire</hi> [Manchester, <date when="1825-00-00">1825</date>] 2:707).

<p><salute>A thousand thanks, my Dearest, for the good little Note!</salute> It is the first friendly word I have heard this week; and I had need enough of it; and it has done me a world of good!&#x2014; I do not feel up to Barringdom today; I must give a shilling,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For special delivery of a message.</note> and send off to Charles Buller to make my excuse. In fact, with my &#x2018;solitude&#x2019; &#x26;c, and being &#x2018;unhappy <hi rend="italic">enough</hi>,&#x2019; I feel quite worn away. Perhaps I may go tomorrow &#x2018;when I am <hi rend="italic">not</hi> bound to,&#x2019;&#x2014;if I chance to be better. But the weather is horribly hot again; yesterday moreover, I had to <hi rend="italic">take coffee in the afternoon too</hi>,&#x2014; you know what that means! I had or might have traced the thing coming on since before you went. My work is my only comfort: <foreign><hi rend="italic">Ach Gott!</hi></foreign>&#x2014; I have <hi rend="italic">spoken</hi> hitherto almost nothing; and do not feel an inclination to speak,&#x2014;never had a wish to <hi rend="italic">send!</hi></p>
<p>On thursday evening, as I sat moody but diligent and composed, there came in upon me,&#x2014;whom think you, while so many noble and agreeable persons were courteously respecting my solitude?&#x2014;the wretched Edinburgh Dud, Russell or something is the name of him, whom Haddington Brown had introduced the other day: he, a second time, with a still more wretched Edinburgh Dud introduced by him, and little Masson to herald them!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Only Samuel Brown and David Masson can be identified. Masson wrote: &#x201C;Only on one occasion, in those early months of our acquaintance, do I remember a gruffish reception from Carlyle; and that was when one or two friends of mine, who were on a visit to London and had separate introductions to him, formed a party for a joint call upon him in the afternoon, and persuaded me to go with them. Mrs Carlyle was away; he was in a bad humour; one of the party introduced a topic not to his taste, and was rather combative in asserting his own views of it; and I could see that Carlyle wished all of us at Jericho&#x201D; (D. Masson, <hi rend="italic">Memories of London in the &#x2019;Forties</hi> [<date when="1908-00-00">1908</date>] 52). Brown wrote to Aird, <date when="1844-06-16">16 June</date>, that TC was well and that &#x201C;John Gordon saw him very lately in town. Robertson spends his Sundays evenings, or rather Sabbath Nichts with the Hero; so that you and he are already linked by the noble bond of the mutual friendship of a Countryman&#x201D; (MS: NLS 1889.30).</note> A precious three to be selected <pb id="pg-18-94" n="18:94"/>from the whole Population of this world. Miserable snaffles too, full of animal magnetism, free kirk and other mere rubbish;&#x2014;I had some doubts whether not to rise with red hot oaths, and pack them all instantly into the street. I gave them tea; but in my rage as I best could (for Dud the Second was inclined to Edinburgh logic even!),&#x2014;then took my hat, saying I must &#x201C;go to Kensington&#x201D;; which I did, to the <hi rend="italic">lanes</hi> of Kensington, and <hi rend="italic">walked</hi> the whole three out, instead of kicking them out. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Ceci devient trop fort</hi></foreign> [This becomes too strong], it beats Yankeedoodledoodom itself. I must take extreme care how I write one line more, or bestow one look more, on that illustrious Brown,&#x2014;who it seems to me wants common-sense very much, for one thing, and I doubt is not unlikely to go all into thrums in that Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> situation of his. World&#x2019;s wonder in Edinburgh: how infinitely safer to be World&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Zero</hi> in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, as I used to be!&#x2014; One of Cavaignac&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">snorts</hi> is all one can say of such things. That visit was the beginning of my sorrows; saddened me to the very heart.</p>
<p>Yesterday I had Helps; &#x201C;Not to dinner, ah no&#x2014;I cannot!&#x201D;&#x2014;whereupon the poor man walked out with me; poor Helps!

The feeling, I suppose, is universal: see Ballantyne&#x2019;s Letter too, received today.</p>
<p>In my absence yesterday, John Fergus had called; Elizabeth had been before, to ask me to meet him at dinner on saturday: &#x201C;Already engaged.&#x201D; His arrival was sudden, so I suppose will his departure be.&#x2014; A quantity of Books from Chapman&#x2019;s, and one most splendidly bound, with that adjoined Note in it. <foreign><hi rend="italic">A la bonne heure</hi></foreign> [Well and good].&#x2014; Colman&#x2019;s is today;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >An invitation from Henry Colman.</note> the answer &#x201C;No,&#x201D; with suppressed shrieks.&#x2014;</p>

<p>I arrived here last Monday my wish to see my Uncle and Cousins again having overcome my repugnance to visiting this place again&#x2014;my last recollections of which were so miserable!

<p><salute>Dearest,&#x2014;</salute> After a world of confused hithering and thithering, I did get to Baringdom yesterday,&#x2014;and had much better have staid at home! We were a party of great quality, more lords and elegant my-ladies as thick as blackberries; but, in result, the state of my inner man continued of the same and worse, and in brief, I found myself awake this morning at four, in <hi rend="italic">that</hi> biliary predicament, and no prospect of breakfast till 10! By dint of entirely or almost entirely holding my peace, and getting off as soon as there was any Brighton Train to London after a cup of coffee, I am here without need of a Coroner&#x2019;s <pb id="pg-18-98" n="18:98"/>Inquest; nay am much better than at 4 this morning, or at seven when I went out to walk, I expected to be! O dear, alack and welladay, what a visitor of foreign houses am I! Who we were all, and what we said and did, I will till you tomorrow if I have any time; or rather I will keep them all till you come back to me, and then you shall know &#x201C;how they <hi rend="italic">ac</hi>&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; cf. <ref target="volume-06/lt-18321010-JWC-EA-01"><sic>6:234</sic><corr>JWC to EA, <date when="1832-10-10">10 Oct. 1832</date></corr></ref>.</note> in these foreign parts.

<ps><p>There is still a great talk and excitement about the Letter business. A new debate, as I told you, is expected to come on about it tomorrow night. The &#x201C;whole plot is discovered now,&#x201D; said Milnes, said Baring, when I arrived yesterday: &#x201C;a plot brewed in Malta,&#x2014;200 men landed <pb id="pg-18-99" n="18:99"/>in Calabria!&#x201D;<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Milnes wrote to a friend, <date when="1844-07-01">1 July</date>: &#x201C;We have had a sort of ministerial crisis, which made a little row for three days. &#x2026; Sir Robert lost both tact and temper, and, it is said, resigned &#x2026; but was begged to reconsider&#x201D; (Reid, <hi rend="italic">RMM</hi> 1:330). Two young Venetian nobles&#x2014;Attilio (<date when="1811-00-00">1811</date>?&#x2014;<date when="1844-00-00">44</date>) and Emilio (<date when="1819-00-00">1819</date>&#x2013;<date when="1844-00-00">44</date>) Bandiera&#x2014;deserted from the Austrian navy and, inspired by Mazzini, planned a descent on the Italian coast from Corfu. The plot discovered, the Neapolitan govt. lured them to the Calabrian coast, captured them and had them shot. It was widely but wrongly believed that information obtained from opening Mazzini&#x2019;s letter had been passed to the Austrian govt., resulting in the brothers deaths, and Graham was called &#x201C;the assassin of the Italian patriots.&#x201D; See H.

He (Walter) bade me tell you that he was by no means forgetful about Ben Nelson&#x2014;that he had made three attempts to get him a situation and in the last instance believed that he had quite succeeded&#x2014;when the Employer asked as a last question what countryman he was and being told he was a Scotchman declared that &#x201C;it was <hi rend="italic">most unfortunate</hi>, for he had once sworn by his Maker a solemn oath that no <hi rend="italic">scotchman</hi> should ever enter his employment !&#x2014; &#x201C;God curse him for a <hi rend="italic">damned</hi> prejudiced fool,&#x201D; said Walter&#x2014;(<hi rend="italic">that</hi> is his present style of speech)&#x2014;you were to assure yourself however that he would not cease enquiring and that nothing would give him more pleasure than in being able to oblige you in this or any other way.&#x2014; Indeed he seems ready to lay the hair of his head under <hi rend="italic">our</hi> feet&#x2014;and you would have said that he made a <hi rend="italic">parade</hi> of this by way of giving additional poignancy to his contemptuous behaviour to all the rest his wife included&#x2014; To something I remarked he said &#x201C;Oh yes, but <hi rend="small-caps">you</hi> are accustomed to associate with human beings! with people that have some thought in their heads!&#x201D; and his looks and voice when he said this was that of a man likely to end in Bedlam or in Suicide&#x2014;</p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>You have heard of me not long since; but it seems a great while since I had any little word with yourself; therefore, this night before the light entirely go, I will send you a little line, in hopes of provoking you to send me an answer soon.</p>
<p>Since Monday gone a week, as I think you heard before, I have been alone, quite left to my own devices: Jane went away that morning to Liverpool to see her Uncle once more, where she still continues. She had a very bad passage, poor thing, having taken a kind of &#x201C;sea-sickness&#x201D; in the rail-carriage, which made a most uncomfortable journey of it for her: however, she is pretty well since, and lets me hear from her almost every day. She is to stay till next week at her uncle&#x2019;s, and then she has another visit or two to pay among the people there-abouts; so that I suppose it will be some ten days yet before she think of coming back to me. I am very much alone ever since she went away, and study to be diligent; but do not make much progress either,&#x2014;indeed the weather is so oppressive to me, I am not very brisk in working.</p>
<p>The other day I went out some ten miles into the Country, to the House of a Mr Baring, where I staid all night. The Country is beautiful, green and leafy, one of the prettiest countries; we were a grand party all official persons and <foreign>grandees</foreign> male and female, and polite exceedingly: but, alas, I awoke at four in the morning,&#x2014;what can the bare hand do! Come home to its work again, and give up visits!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Jack, it seems, is gone over to Kirkcudbright to visit Mrs Church;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mother of Duncan Church (d. <date when="1828-00-00">1828</date>); see vol. 1 and <ref target="volume-06/lt-18320831-TC-JAC-01"><sic>6:217</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1832-08-31">31 Aug. 1832</date></corr></ref>.</note> you are to be at Gill in the interim, he says. I hope the fresh air and sea-bathing there will do you good, dear Mother; you have need of it by all that I can learn. O do take care of yourself! Poor Jenny too, they tell me, has been suffering from a bad cold; I hope it is true that she has got better of it. And Mary, what is Mary doing? Toiling and working, Jamie and she, I dare say; it is the lot of us all in this world. And they are not the unhappiest by far that have honest work to do. There are some scores of thousands galloping about this place at present, to whom it would be the indisputablest blessing if any friend could set <pb id="pg-18-102" n="18:102"/>them fairly <hi rend="italic">to work</hi>, were it but at <hi rend="italic">breaking <foreign>lint</foreign></hi> [flax], or weeding potatoes!&#x2014; By the bye, I think I saw the old Marquis of Queensberry<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Douglas (<date when="1779-00-00">1779</date>&#x2013;<date when="1856-00-00">1856</date>), 7th marquess of Queensberry.</note> one day, riding about among the rest here; I noticed him looking at me, and then knew the face of him.</p>
<p>Poor Mrs Buller has been very unwell; it is a cough which continually plagues her: she has determined on going to Italy thro&#x2019; the winter. John Sterling continues in an altogether weak and dangerous state; his old Father, who was here today, is also very unwell,&#x2014;a fiery unreasonable old fellow, whom loneliness, the loss of his Wife and state of his son have driven into great excitement.</p>
<p>You would be delighted to get Alick&#x2019;s Letters; I have seldom put anything into the post-Office with better goodwill! Poor Alick</p>

<p><salute>Dear Goody Mine,&#x2014;</salute> Your Note came yesterday, your Creek <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> duly today. Thanks always for your kindness, for your punctuality. I yesterday sent nothing but a <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> with new Debate and humiliation of the poor Secretary: I knew you would have got, in a day more, by Creek; but I thought you would like to see it fresh and fresh.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, <date when="1844-07-03">3 July</date>, reported the extended Commons debate, <date when="1844-07-02">2 July</date>, when Graham himself moved a secret committee of inquiry. The opposition objected to the proposed members and to its secrecy, but Graham&#x2019;s motion passed. The <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, <date when="1844-07-04">4 July</date>, said that &#x201C;he has not only secured &#x2026; a private trial, but he has chosen his own jury.&#x201D;</note> Nothing can exceed the craven position of that unfortunate English Fouch&#xE9;:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Joseph Fouch&#xE9; (<date when="1763-00-00">1763</date>&#x2013;<date when="1820-00-00">1820</date>), French minister of police, <date when="1799-00-00">1799</date>&#x2013;<date when="1802-00-00">1802</date>, famous for his system of spies and political intrigues. The <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, <date when="1844-06-17">17 June</date>, in its initial account of the affair, said that &#x201C;Sir J. Graham must have been studying Vidocq and Fouch&#xE9;.&#x201D; Fran&#x26;ccedil;ois Eug&#xE8;ne Vidocq (<date when="1775-00-00">1775</date>&#x2013;<date when="1857-00-00">1857</date>), chief of a detective force in Paris, organized a daring robbery, was detailed to investigate it, was discovered and dismissed from the police force.</note> it might satisfy Mazzini himself to observe the whine he gives, like a lashed hound! It is to be hoped now that they will put an end altogether to the Privilege of Opening Seals, and so terminate this small business which has grown such a loud one.&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; By the bye let me not neglect to say that the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> I sent yesterday belongs to the Stimabile, and must be pointedly returned to him. He came down with it yesterday, poor old fellow, intending it for you,&#x2014;for there is some poor weak thunder of his own on the same subject in it: I did not even give <pb id="pg-18-103" n="18:103"/>him hope that you would see that individual copy, for I expected another from Darwin to send you, which however did not come. The poor old Thunderer is really very low, I think; not far from the end of his wits. Actually one might have fancied him half mad: His heart, all enlarged or enlarging to the size of a bagpipe was killing him <hi rend="italic">fast</hi>, at which he rejoiced, Ha, ha!&#x2014;passess<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> three or two half-days every week &#x201C;sitting <hi rend="italic">in the vaults</hi> yonder&#x2014;hoo!&#x201D;&#x2014;could not consent to go to the Country for recreation; &#x201C;by God, would like well to go where there was <hi rend="italic">a Battle</hi> transacting itself!&#x201D; &#x26;c &#x26;c He looks healthier, however; not so hot and flabby: also the accounts from John grow favourabler. The unfortunate old man, with his real suffering, with his crying, laughing, swearing all huddled together, and total want of earnestness or dignity in the matter, was really a distress to me. A more absurd bag of bluster, in real danger of bursting, I have not often seen.</p>
<p>The night before last, having got my Castor &#x26; Pollux<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC&#x2019;s slang for chop and potatoes. Castor and Pollux, twin sons of Jupiter and Leda, were worshiped as gods and finally placed among the constellations.</note> put away, I walked up to Darwin&#x2019;s in the ambrosial evening. Darwin sat as usual in manly <foreign>ennui</foreign>; brought out cigars; mentioned while we spoke of Peel&#x2019;s Macnaughten and Bedlam,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Referring to Daniel Macnaughtan&#x2019;s incarceration in an asylum after his acquittal of murder on grounds of insanity.</note> &#x201C;One would do very well, lodged there, I imagine!&#x201D; Hafway<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> home I was surprised by a heavy rain, which however could not wet me thro&#x2019; the Tweed, and did no mischief at all. Last night again I had a walk along the streets; dull Cromwell Books my company when I got home. My physical ailments are gone or going; nothing but weakness and laziness remain. I dined yesterday on one chop and bread; today do with potatoes. I was to dine with Maurice and certain Wilberforces,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably including Samuel Wilberforce (<date when="1805-00-00">1805</date>&#x2013;<date when="1873-00-00">73</date>; <ref target="volume-18/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/29385"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), archdeacon of Surrey, <date when="1839-00-00">1839</date>&#x2013;<date when="1845-00-00">45</date>, bishop of Oxford, <date when="1845-00-00">1845</date>, at this time a friend of Maurice; and any of his three brothers&#x2014;William (<date when="1798-00-00">1798</date>&#x2013;<date when="1879-00-00">1879</date>), who lived in London; Robert Isaac (<date when="1802-00-00">1802</date>&#x2013;<date when="1857-00-00">57</date>; <ref target="volume-18/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/29384/?back=,29385"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), archdeacon of East Riding, York; and Henry William (<date when="1807-00-00">1807</date>&#x2013;<date when="1873-00-00">73</date>; <ref target="volume-18/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/29383/?back=,29385"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), vicar of East Farleigh, Kent.</note> but will make tea serve.&#x2014; Today Perry came for his rent; Ellen sent him off &#x201C;till <hi rend="italic">your</hi> return&#x201D;;&#x2014;I have instructed her to go and bid him come to <hi rend="italic">me</hi> straightway.</p>
<p>Your account of Walter M&#x2019;Gregor is tragical! I really feel for the poor man; and fear for him. Such a coil as he is in might drive a quieter man to despair. You may thank him very kindly for his goodness to me in the matter of poor Nelson, whom it will give me very great satisfaction if he can help. The <hi rend="italic">No-Scotchman</hi> case, I suppose, is settled: otherwise it is pity Walter had not known that Nelson is by <pb id="pg-18-104" n="18:104"/><hi rend="italic">birth</hi> &#x26; genealogy on both sides a Cumberland man, and does not at all affect to be Scotch! In fact he is a denizen of the &#x2018;Country of Liverpool&#x2019; as we may say more properly than of any other region; Liverpool has all his days been a kind of Metropolis to him. But the case is not likely to recur.</p>
<p>You must go and see poor old Mrs Chorley; there are far worse phenomena in the best places of this world. Also John Chorley, if there be opportunity,&#x2014;to whom make my compliments. I know not whether you will be better at the Paulets&#x2019;s; but the idea of the fresh air seduces my imagination. May you do the pleasantest way, and the wholesomest. Poor Babby, is she <hi rend="italic">altogether</hi> over with it!<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Her feelings for Walter Macgregor.</note> Do you think of bringing any Cousin with you, or after you? The poorest of them is at least inoffensive to me. <closer><salute>God bless thee my own Jane! No more today</salute></closer></p>

<ps><p>Yesterday poor Thomas Campbell<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Who died at Boulogne, <date when="1844-06-15">15 June</date>, TC had known him quite well; see <ref target="volume-03/lt-18241214-TC-AC-01"><sic>3:220&#x2013;21</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1824-12-14">14 Dec. 1824</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-03/lt-18250122-TC-JAC-01"><sic>261</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1825-01-22">22 Jan. 1825</date></corr></ref>.</note> was buried in W<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Abbey: I was to have gone with Milnes, but did not&#x2014;for want of a <hi rend="italic">black waistcoat</hi>, and also of time &#x26;c &#x26;c.</p>
<p>Alas, the poor old woman in the Lamberts&#x2019;s, I think, must be dead! The windows were all blinded when I came home, and an unusual total stilness has reigned in the House ever since.</p></ps>

<salute>Dearest</salute>
<p>no <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> came yesterday; it came today along with Creek&#x2019;s and your letter&#x2014;and so yesterday morning I was <hi rend="italic">vaixed</hi>&#x2014;for I had come down to breakfast like a run-down watch and was relying on your &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Deticated</hi> attentions&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Untraced.</note> to <hi rend="italic">wind me up</hi>&#x2014;something at the Macgregor-dinner, the Indian-ale&#x2014;I fancy&#x2014;had been carrying on a <hi rend="italic">guerilla</hi>-warfare in my <hi rend="italic">Interior</hi> all the night&#x2014;and also in Helen&#x2019;s as afterwards appeared&#x2014;so that I had got no sleep and&#x2014;the post-hour yielding nothing to cheer me I spent a most cheerless day&#x2014;lying on the sofa&#x2014;hemming <hi rend="italic">a frill</hi>&#x2014;incapable of even the small exertion of writing you a word of commiseration over your blue-pill&#x2014;which was however sufficiently<pb id="pg-18-105" n="18:105"/>present to my imagination&#x2014; It was a regular wet day too, and the patter-pattering of the rain, and yawning-aspect of the <hi rend="italic">Alives</hi> beside me produced <hi rend="italic">altogether</hi> a sort of <hi rend="italic">enchantment</hi> which there was no use striving against.</p>
<p>Last night I slept very well and am to be shaken up presently with an excursion to a <hi rend="italic">lighthouse</hi>,&#x2014;unless it rains again, of which I am not without hope&#x2014;for a <hi rend="italic">pic nic</hi> with Gambardella for its presiding Genius, does not delight me in prospect&#x2014;indeed I refused <hi rend="italic">myself</hi> to this &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">little excitement</hi>&#x201D; until the rest were getting quite vexed at me&#x2014;and so&#x2014; here goes! for &#x201C;the welfare of others!&#x201D;&#x2014; Blessed are they who hope nothing for they shall not be disappointed!</p>
<p>Tomorrow, my uncle proposes taking us all over the Chester&#x2014;and <hi rend="italic">that</hi> I shall like well enough&#x2014; I go to Seaforth on Monday it is to be hoped I shall be able to practise the virtue of <hi rend="italic">silence</hi> till that day and then&#x2014;good gracious&#x2014;what a quantity of <hi rend="italic">liberalism</hi> I will pour out of me!&#x2014; My Uncle would not be so bad with his Toryism if it were not for Alick egging him up&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">his</hi> feelings of an honest man are always struggling against his prejudices, but the very <hi rend="italic">misgivings</hi> he has about the infalibility of his party make him only an <hi rend="italic">angrier partizan</hi>&#x2014;and nothing <hi rend="italic">can</hi> be more provoking than the things he occasionally says&#x2014;for instance he told me yesterday that &#x201C;Sir James had <hi rend="italic">said</hi> he only opened <hi rend="italic">one</hi> of Mazzinis letters that if Mazzini said he opened more&#x2014;he was a damed lying rascal&#x2014;and every body knew whether to believe the word of a <hi rend="italic">gentleman</hi> like Sir James or of a beggarly refugee&#x2014;turned out of his own country for <hi rend="italic">misconduct</hi>&#x2014;damn these people! if they got leave to find a shelter here what right had they to <hi rend="italic">insult the Queen</hi> by insulting her Alies!!!&#x201D; Fancy <hi rend="italic">me</hi> swallowing all that without answer&#x2014;to be sure the only alternative was to hold my peace altogether or produce a collision that must have ended in my calling a coach!</p>
<p>The Macgregors looked a good deal better at home&#x2014; They have a very nice house&#x2014;not too fine but <hi rend="italic">perfectly</hi> got up&#x2014;and she seems to be a good manager and to feel in that sphere more free and kindly&#x2014; I noticed a good many things in the drawing-room <hi rend="italic">bagged up</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Covered against dust.</note>&#x2014;perhaps they have <hi rend="italic">bagged up</hi> the best of their <hi rend="italic">interior furniture</hi> also&#x2014;from mistaken ideas of economy&#x2014;</p>
<p>You will have got soft water now to shave with? <closer><salute>God bless you dear&#x2014;kind regards to Helen</salute></closer></p>

<p>What ails my little Goody? Nothing important, I hope! But let me hear tomorrow, or I shall begin to imagine various things.</p>

I also saw <supplied>[in]</supplied><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> their <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> of the day some fresh thunder against poor Graham.

<p>The rain is abundant; today it is raining even now, and I decide on waiting Dinner before any walk be attempted. I got my hair cut yesterday,&#x2014;with an effort! Nobody can conceive the indolence that weighs me down; otherwise I am now well enough,&#x2014;purposing to dine on chop soon.</p>

<p>What could have detained the <hi rend="italic">Times?</hi> I put it with my own hand upon the Postmaster&#x2019;s Counter (too big for his slit) in fair time. Surely Sir James<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Graham.</note> does not detain Newspapers? Poor Sir James: you may let them praise him in Maryland Street, you <foreign><hi rend="italic">unbeschasiblich ruhig</hi></foreign> [arrogantly quiet one]; he is down in the gutters here, and all the world spitting on him. I believe indeed he is getting far too much, having been unluckier than others, as I often say, rather than radically worse in that particular.</p>
<p>Yesterday so soon as I had done my Note to you, and was thinking to be out, the skies opened again, and said No. &#x201C;Get ready the Chop and potatoes.&#x201D; I sat down to read in my Cromwell Rubbish-Books. After dinner, Perry with the stealthiest ring at the bell came backing in; I paid him his rent, and with difficulty got him out again and the gob of him closed. The rain still continued; and so did I, reading my old rubbish-book;&#x2014;not sleeping, no, nor thinking of it! I have a thought of restricting myself to one chop in future.</p>
<p>Tea over, the skies closed again; about 8 o&#x2019;clock, I had myself carried into Piccadilly over the <foreign>glar</foreign> of our Chelsea roads; and there rushed forth over the clean pavements, far and wide; penetrated&#x2014;to where think you?&#x2014;to the Regent&#x2019;s Park and Lockhart&#x2019;s,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >26 Sussex Pl.</note> being wishful of a little human speech. Lockhart tho&#x2019; it was only 5 minutes past 9 had &#x201C;gone to his bedroom Sir,&#x201D;&#x2014;not unwell; he always retires then Sir, when dinner is done! Not a bad plan, I imagine.&#x2014;I then called for the Macreadies (not mentioning that it was &#x2018;then,&#x2019; but leaving it supposable that I came on purpose): the three women<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Macready&#x2019;s wife, Catherine; his sister, Letitia; and his eldest da., Christina (Nina); at 5 Clarence Terr., Regent&#x2019;s Pk.</note> were sitting very still, with seams and two candles, in their dining room; I sat and talked really very pleasantly with them for about an hour: Miss Macready seems to me a truly good woman; the whole aspect of the House was full of cleanliness, clearness, placidity. Darwin had told them of B&#xF6;lte&#x2019;s <pb id="pg-18-109" n="18:109"/>dismissal from Grahamdon: that thing should really never have been mentioned. Dickens, it appears, on all the Letters he wrote after the &#x2018;explosure,&#x2019; put something <foreign>&#xE0; la</foreign> Childs on the back!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On the flaps of the envelopes addressed to Thomas Beard and John Forster, <date when="1844-06-28">28 June</date>, and probably to others, Dickens wrote: &#x201C;It is particularly requested that if Sir James Graham should open this, he will not trouble himself to seal it <supplied>[agai]</supplied>n&#x201D;; see <hi rend="italic">DL</hi> 4:151 &#x26; n.</note> He is gone to Italy, poor little man, as your missive indicates.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC had enclosed Catherine Dickens&#x2019;s letter to JWC of <date when="1844-07-01">1 July</date>: &#x201C;I had hoped and intended to have had the pleasure of calling upon you before we leave England &#x2026; tomorrow morning. &#x2026; I have never been able &#x2026; to get to you. &#x2026; I have no other resource but to write to wish you goodbye.&#x201D;</note> To Marseilles, then to Genoa. Good luck to him, poor little Dickens; there is something very good and gifted in him, and in his lot are tragic elements enough capable of unfolding themselves.</p>
<p>It will be a great relief to the poor Goody to get her mouth opened again, and that pent reservoir of Liberalism emitted! Really it is too bad to be plagued in these days with any debate about Sir James Graham and C<hi rend="italic">o;</hi> there are quite other considerations and questions opening around us at this o&#x2019;clock. Let the dead bury their dead.&#x2014; However, the uncle is so honest and brave a man, it beseems the niece to let him have his way and <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to call a Coach.</p>
<p>You will get no Letter on Monday, for none can be sent on Sunday; I wish before Tuesday (that means for you, <hi rend="italic">Tomorrow</hi>) you would send me the right address of Pauletdom; at present I know only &#x201C;&#x2014;Paulet Esq, Seaforth, Liverpool,&#x201D; which I suppose would do, but it will be better to have his first name too.&#x2014; &#x2014; Baringdom for tomorrow causes a shudder; the weather too is bad, and my health improving: <foreign>Stava bene, per star meglio, sto qui!</foreign><note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;I was well; but trying to be better, I find myself here!&#x201D; An old epitaph.</note>&#x2014;</p>
<p>I have a Letter to write to Jack, various Letters to write; this to the Burns Festival I have just written. Wretched mortals! The Sister of Burns<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Isobel Begg.</note> about a year ago could hardly be rescued from starving.&#x2014; <closer><salute>Bless thee poor Dear</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I should have written to you sooner; but I have been sadly tumbled about, I have also been in the <hi rend="italic">blue-pill</hi> line &#x26;c! On Thursday the <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi> came addressed in your hand, which taught me that you were at Dumfries one of those days: I do not precisely know where your address is at this present, but will venture on Dumfries as the likeliest. I shot off a small Note to my Mother the other day, which I hope would find her at Gill.</p>
<p>Jane continues in Liverpool at her Uncle&#x2019;s; seems pretty well: she is to shift to Seaforth &#x2018;on Monday next,&#x2019; has the Chorleys within reach of her: I suppose in another ten days, we may be looking for her home again.&#x2014; I make some little progress in Cromwell; not very much, but am always at it. I am getting <hi rend="italic">the Letters</hi> up; I can work at that when at nothing else.</p>
<p>The Town is <foreign><hi rend="italic">brashing</hi></foreign> [rushing] along with quality carriages yet, if one go up to it on an evening: I hope they will go about their business before long, and leave poor men to follow their affairs in more peace. Since Jane went away, I have been almost a hermit; speaking to no man, sometimes, for days. The Maurices are close at hand, if I wish to speak. Last week I was out at the Barings&#x2019;s Place for a day: Buller, Milnes, young England, and various Lordships and Ladyships too tedious to mention: I had an ugly bilious fit upon me, and got small good of the affair. Sir James Graham seems admitted to have fallen into one of his ugliest scrapes in this Letter Business: all men are hooting and howling at him,&#x2014;really beyond measure, poor scoundrel.</p>
<p>No news of Robertson, except incidentally about ten days ago that he was then in Edinburgh, minded if I recollect, to continue for a while. They are all agog about their Burns Festival:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robertson meant to go to it, as Brown wrote to Aird, <date when="1844-06-16">16 June</date>, in a letter of intro. for him.</note> I got an invitation yesterday, have written today to decline. Tomfoolery occurs of its own accord; one need not go so far to seek it. The miserable Wind-bags of this generation <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> reverence a man, can only get up &#x2018;Festivals&#x2019; and spout froth about him.&#x2014; Dickens is off to Genoa <foreign><hi rend="italic">mit Weib und Kind</hi></foreign> [with wife and child]: good voyage to him.</p>
<p>Jean wrote not long since about Jenny&#x2019;s being unwell, you intimate that she is a degree better, or almost altogether better, tho&#x2019; not yet well. I have been thinking ever since that her &#xa3;5 of money is due <pb id="pg-18-111" n="18:111"/>some time since? Perfect regularity in that business would be a great increase of benefit. Perhaps you have already inquired into it; if not, pray do. Jean knows the times and conditions. I have even forgotten which of us it is that has now to pay,&#x2014;but I think I settled that Martinmas and Whitsunday were to be the times, and paid at Martinmas. If so, whitsunday will be yours. Pray ask Jean, and then each of us will henceforth remember his day, and keep it.</p>
<p>Another pious service I will recommend to you: that of a residence for our Mother. She will have no house next Whitsunday, and some good arrangement for her ought to be fallen upon in that particular. Jamie can advise, and also Jean; and your own personal inspection of the lie of matters will be best of all. Of course whatsoever seems good to be resolved upon will have me for a grateful forwarder of it. The great point is to know <hi rend="italic">what:</hi> the rest will require no discussion.</p>
<p>Write to me more at large about all Annandale matters. Those brief Notes do not encourage to a reply! Surely there is a whole encyclopedia of things to write about; there, if anywhere.&#x2014; When you see Graham, my kind remembrances to him. You will go and see Stewart<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably James Hope Stewart, of Gillenbie Rig; see <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390815-TC-JAC-01"><sic>11:167</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1839-08-15">15 Aug. 1839</date></corr></ref>.</note> too.&#x2014; Yesterday the Postman sent up a &#x201C;Ship Letter&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >One carried by private vessel, not by ordinary mail boat.</note> (from Arbuckle seemingly) which I was &#x201C;to address&#x201D;: I might as well have kept it for this cover. Today there came two others, mere <hi rend="italic">catalogues</hi> evidently, which I flung aside.&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;  <closer><salute>Wherever you be or go, you are safe in offering my affection to all &#x26; sundry.</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dearest</salute>
<p>They are all gone to church save Babbie and I, who &#x201C;in <foreign>wera</foreign> desperation&#x201D; have mustered courage to resist such stupid Tyranny as attendance at church for forms sake would have been for us this day. Babbie prudently keeps her bed professing to be &#x201C;all over aches&#x201D; in consequence of our two pleasure excursions&#x2014;for me a second sunday in bed would have been a little too <hi rend="italic">strong</hi>&#x2014;but I found my claim of immunity on a <hi rend="italic">sore throat</hi> and make anybody welcome to look into my throat which is in truth very much inflamed. It has been the only disagreeable result of my two days passed in succession in the open <pb id="pg-18-112" n="18:112"/>air. Both <hi rend="italic">Larks</hi> have come off beyond my most sanguine expectations&#x2014; On Friday we sallied forth about twelve&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">we</hi> comprehending Helen Babbie Mary and myself&#x2014;with Gambardella for our only protector&#x2014;and followed by Gambardella&#x2019;s maid carrying a basket of provisions, and a small scotch terrier that kept us in perpetual excitement by biting our own and other peoples heels. Having crossed the water to New Brighton<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Across the Mersey, in Cheshire.</note> in a steamboat&#x2014;a voyage in which even I could not manage to be sick&#x2014;we were all set down on the beech to spend the day! and the prospect looked to me of the blackest!&#x2014; But before I had time to sink under it, Gambardella with a sudden inspiration of Genius rushed off like a madman, and returned after a little while on the ugliest of created ponies followed by two lads leading five donkies to accommodate the whole party maid and all! and on these creatures we actually rode eight miles&#x2014;along the shore&#x2014;to a place called Leesowe<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Leasowe Castle, Cheshire, built <date when="1593-00-00">1593</date> for the earl of Derby.</note> and back again&#x2014;sometimes galloping as if we had been on horseback; thanks to the lads who shouted and belaboured us from behind&#x2014;and all the way in fits of laughter at the stupidity of the creatures and our own ridiculous appearance. At Leesowe we sent them to graze and spread our provisions in a sand-valley all covered over with wild Thyme and white roses&#x2014;and Gambardella sung us Italian songs&#x2014;and we eat sandwiches and drank a good deal of wine&#x2014;and <hi rend="italic">it was a good joy!</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380909-JWC-TC-01"><sic>10:167</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1838-09-09">9 Sept. 1838</date></corr></ref>.</note> <hi rend="italic">Your</hi> health was proposed by G. and drank with enthusiasm&#x2014;&#x201C;success to his <hi rend="italic">wo-k!</hi> Goodhumour to him and a speedy journey to Liverpool&#x201D;!&#x2014; Even <hi rend="italic">you</hi> would have been conquered by the creatures efforts to amuse&#x2014;and endless consideration for <hi rend="italic">my</hi> comfort&#x2014;just think of his taking off a beautiful lightcoloured coat and making it into a cushion for me to sit on&#x2014;because the sand was damp&#x2014; He is far best in the open air, being in fact a sort of savage.

<p>You cannot imagine how this sort of thing goes to ones heart&#x2014; But I should tell you that the gate keeper at Eaton Hall refused to allow our carriage to pass&#x2014; &#x2014;&#x201C;quite against his orders on Saturday&#x201D;&#x2014;until M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Liddle privately handed him <hi rend="italic">five shillings</hi>&#x2014;when he said&#x2014;&#x201C;but I suppose since you are come on purpose I must make an exception&#x201D;&#x2014; &#x2014; Is not the like of that beastly at the gate of <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;the richest man in all England&#x201D;?</hi><note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Said of the marquess of Westminister because of his real estate holdings, esp. in Belgravia, London.</note></p>

<p><salute>My dear Goody&#x2019;s brisk little Note is here,</salute> redolent of all manner of nice things,&#x2014;with the exception of that <hi rend="italic">sore throat,</hi> which I beg her to have a care of, and to subdue by thin diet and recipes. Gambardella&#x2019;s Excursion, with the <foreign>Cuddies</foreign> [donkeys] and the <foreign>thymy</foreign> picnic is a most dainty affair; for which I thank the savage man. He has, as I say always, the faculties of a first-rate Newfoundland Dog, virtues of the same included, with a decided sense of colour and form super-added. On the other side of the Mersey, and providing <foreign>Cuddies</foreign> for my poor Goody he is decidedly agreeable to me. Your poor Uncle&#x2014;my poor Goody&#x2014;how the mournfullest tone, from the very depths of Being, chaces us on the flowery surface amid all light sounds, and in no moment leaves us! We are born to die, our little Time is in Eternity; we do need, among our other requisites, a courage like that of gods.

Lord Howick and Wife,&#x2014;Earl Grey&#x2019;s son: a thin lame man, turned of forty, looking very weak of body, but earnest, clear affectionate and honest, with good talent too, for the spiritual part; the Lady Howick a pale aquiline dark-eyed beauty bleached white, who did not captivate me or estrange me.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henry George Grey (<date when="1802-00-00">1802</date>&#x2013;<date when="1894-00-00">94</date>; <ref target="volume-18/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/11540"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), Viscount Howick and, from <date when="1845-00-00">1845</date>, 3d Earl Grey; son of Charles Grey (<date when="1764-00-00">1764</date>&#x2013;<date when="1845-00-00">1845</date>; <ref target="volume-18/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/11526/?back=,11540"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), 2d Earl Grey, prime minister, <date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>&#x2013;<date when="1833-00-00">33</date>; M.P., <date when="1826-00-00">1826</date>&#x2013;<date when="1845-00-00">45</date>; undersec. for colonies in his father&#x2019;s whig administration, <date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>&#x2013;<date when="1833-00-00">33</date>, and for home affairs, <date when="1834-00-00">1834</date>; sec. for colonies, <date when="1846-00-00">1846</date>&#x2013;<date when="1852-00-00">52</date>; led his party in Lords from <date when="1845-00-00">1845</date>; m., <date when="1832-00-00">1832</date>, Maria, b. Copley (<date when="1803-00-00">1803</date>&#x2013;<date when="1879-00-00">79</date>).</note> The immortal old Lady Holland,&#x2014;really a kind of witch of the (Kensington) Alps; very impressive in her way. She is terribly broken poor old body; has a Doctor the strangest little fellow I have seen, who did not speak one word good or bad, but seemed happy, and perfect in the social gesticulations: besides him she carries with her a page, and an old woman to rub her legs;&#x2014;these with the natural <foreign>etceteras</foreign> almost fill a house of themselves. Buller of course was there, as in his home; Stanley too again, but without his Wife. He and others too tedious to mention. The goose berries were ripe; I had a pocket of cigars, and other smokers to keep company: the day was soft grey without rain, a temperature like silk. The Lady Harriet is the most consummate of Land-ladies,&#x2014;regardless of expense; Baring himself had radiances of real talent: he is, I do think, a good modest man. The whole matter went off with effect. It is really entertaining to me to be part of such a company now and then; their art in speech, more and more noticeable gradually, is decidedly a thing to be considered valuable, venerable. Real goodbreeding, as the people have it here, is one of the finest things now going in the world. The careful avoidance of all discussion, the swift hopping from topic to topic, does not agree with me; but the graceful skill they do it with is beyond that of minuets!&#x2014; Among other subjects we came once pretty late in the evening upon Mazzini&#x2019;s Letters. Brougham had been privately telling all people in the Lord&#x2019;s one day, that Mazzini was a scamp after all, that &#x201C;he once kept a gaminghouse!&#x201D; so Stanley reported, glad of any stab to Brougham. The old stern Witch of the Alps thereupon asked Lady Harriet, What he really was, this Mazzini? &#x201C;A revolutionary man, the head of Young Italy,&#x201D; answered she.&#x2014; &#x201C;Oh then, surely they ought to take him up,&#x201D; rejoined the Witch of the Kensington Alps. Our adroit Hostess hinted, &#x201C;No, and that she herself knew him.&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;What!&#x201D; exclaimed the astonished Witch, with wide open eyes; the other persisted with the gentlest touch of light irrefragability,&#x2014;had actually &#x201C;asked him to come and see me.&#x201D; I added, addressing the Witch: &#x201C;He is a man well worth seeing, and is <pb id="pg-18-116" n="18:116"/>not at all specially anxious to be seen&#x201D;&#x2014; &#x201C;And did he <hi rend="italic">not</hi> keep a gaminghouse?&#x201D; said she. &#x201C;He had never the faintest shadow of connexion with that side of human business; the proudest person in this company is not farther above keeping a gaminghouse than Mazzini is!&#x201D;&#x2014; &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">That</hi> means Byng&#x201D; (an absurd old curly-headed Diner-out, whom they call &#x2018;Poodle Byng&#x201D;), said Buller, looking at the man;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Gerald Frederick Byng (<date when="1784-00-00">1784</date>&#x2013;<date when="1871-00-00">1871</date>), youngest son of 5th Viscount Torrington; clerk in foreign office, <date when="1801-00-00">1801</date>&#x2013;<date when="1839-00-00">39</date>, when superannuated; called &#x201C;Poodle Byng&#x201D; by George Canning (<date when="1770-00-00">1770</date>&#x2013;<date when="1827-00-00">1827</date>) on account of his curly hair.</note> upon which an explosion of laughter swallowed up my over-emphasis and the whole discussion,&#x2014;in a highly felicitous manner!</p>

<p><salute>All well here, Dearest, and not a word of news.</salute> W<hi rend="italic">m</hi> Cunningham called yesterday when I was out, and I have spoken to no creature&#x2014; Yes yesterday I went to leave a card for Lady Monro: alas, a card would not do; to my despair I was ushered in, and had to make conversation for a while,&#x2014;and poor enough conversation it was. Pictures, Art, Henry Taylor, and rubbish of various kinds! I am sorry for poor human creatures, and their embarassed communings together. Lady M. is a good woman, or<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably for &#x201C;of.&#x201D;</note> some dignity and great personal stature, and has seen and suffered many things; but&#x2014; In a word, she is coming to see <hi rend="italic">you</hi> whenever you come home, and then you shall, how cheerfully, have her all!&#x2014;</p>
<p>The Stanleys are to depart this week; I must go and leave a card for my beautiful Moonface; a card here, so oblique is Fortune, will be sure to do.</p>
<p>I walked all last evening thro&#x2019; innumerable quiet streets; I bought a big Book of Topography that I had need of, very cheap: I have even bespoken a pair of shoes,&#x2014;feat never to be forgotten. When I succeed in buying anything out of a shop here, it seems to me as if I had made it, as if I had conquered it by my bow and my spear: the shop-commerce of Cockneydom will never in this world become <foreign><hi rend="italic">heimlich</hi></foreign> [comfortable] to me.</p>
<p>I have worked in the drowsiest manner at my poor <hi rend="italic">Cromwell;</hi> stupid drudge&#x2014;work, <foreign><hi rend="italic">Ach Gott!</hi></foreign> My progress is small; but I wriggle on, were it like a tortoise thro&#x2019; abysses of tough mire. If I can live, I shall get an Oliver Made Visible to shew you, one day! <foreign><hi rend="italic">Allons</hi></foreign> [Forward].</p>
<p>But the chief thing that gives me pause today is my poor Goody&#x2019;s cold. I could have liked well to hear from you these words, &#x2018;My cold is gone.&#x2019; Perhaps it is but fancy: however, I must entertain this bur sticking on me till you speak and pluck it off.</p>
<p>Helen boils me the second quarter of my Dorking &#x201C;stalled&#x201D;&#x2014;hen;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A breed of hen.</note> this day, as yesterday. It makes a capital dinner.&#x2014; I fear we waste <hi rend="italic">cream</hi> here; there seems to be exactly the old quantity always, and one month fewer: I never interfere!&#x2014; <closer><salute>Tell me about the cold; and take care of thyself!</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute><hi rend="small-caps">My Dear Sir</hi>,&#x2014;</salute> You are probably right in your determination towards London; at least I will by no means say you are wrong. Your description of Edinburgh life has much in it that agrees with my own experience and observation there, and certainly the patience with which you have seen and admitted all that, and silently gone on with it, and are still ready to go on with it, in manful diligence under such conditions as there may be, is of good augury for you here or elsewhere. &#x201C;Go where we will, we find ourselves again in a conditional world.&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly from Goethe. See the conversation with Eckermann, <date when="1831-02-17">17 Feb. 1831</date>, in <hi rend="italic">Goethe, Conversations and Encounters</hi>, trans. D. Luke and R. Pick (Chicago, <date when="1966-00-00">1966</date>) 229.</note></p>
<p>Of Law in London I know nothing practical. I see some few lawyers in society at times, a tough, withered, wiry sort of men, but they hide their law-economies, even when I question them, very much under lock and key. I have understood that the labour is enormous in their profession, and the reward likewise; the successful lawyer amasses hundreds of thousands, and actually converts himself into <pb id="pg-18-121" n="18:121"/>what we might call a &#x201C;spiritual <foreign>speldrin</foreign>,&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A small fish slit open, salted, and dried in the sun.</note> no very blessed bargain! On the whole, I would not prophesy for you the first prizes in such a course, nor like you the worse that you went without prizes at all in it. But there is much here besides Law; Law is a small item here.</p>
<p>The great question is: Dare you, Must you? It is an awful enterprise that of London, but also full of generous results if you have strength. Strength to look chaos and hell in the face; to struggle through them toward the Adamantine Isles! For a literary lawyer, I should say Edinburgh was far preferable. Success in Law here is totally incompatible with Literature. This you should reflect on before starting.</p>
<p>On the whole, if you have the offer of a clerkship that will secure you subsistence, there can be no harm in coming up to take a view of us, and to try what kind of chaos we are. There is much here to interest a brave young Scotchman, to expand him, to repress him, and in many ways instruct him, if he have strength to learn. If he will not learn, they will kill him here in one way or other.</p>
<p>You may depend very certainly on my omitting no opportunity that may arise to further you in this matter. If my power equalled my inclination you were very safe in it. If your present half-certain outlook end in nothing, pray apprise me of that, and I will at least speak to some persons about it.</p>
<p>And so I will wish you a wise resolution, wise and genuine as in the sight of God your Maker, which indeed is wishing you all. The heedless clamour and babble of our fellow-creatures do but bewilder us. &#x201C;Thou must be a great man,&#x201D; they cry, &#x201C;or we will not be flunkies to thee!&#x201D; &#x201C;Who wants you for flunkies? I will be a small man!&#x201D;&#x2014; <closer><salute>Believe me, yours very sincerely,</salute></closer> <name><hi rend="small-caps">T. Carlyle</hi></name></p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>You are always very good and kind; but, alas, there is no possibility of such things at present!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Accepting his invitation.</note> I do not think I shall get away out of London at all this year; I have prospered so badly with my work, I seem to have no title to such recreation, and even a reproachful con-science would deny me the power of enjoying such.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-18-122" n="18:122"/>The fact is, I did not find that, last year, I got any benefit by three months of idle locomotion and spiritual stagnancy; no benefit, but only mischief,&#x2014;palpable increase of sorrow and stupidity. My poor nerves are not to be cured in weeks; it would take a plunge of a whole year&#x2019;s continuance, a deep bath of twelve months in the Silences and Solitudes, to do me any good! My present notion is to continue here. In about a month, the tumultuous Quality, with their racket and riot, will have gone their ways; London then, on my side of it, is one of the loneliest places in all the Queen&#x2019;s Dominions&#x2014; The air truly is dusty, the streets backed, the physical environment more or less detestable; but one is at home,&#x2014;there are other annoyances, even uglier than these, which a poor invalid creature keeping in his own den avoids. Cromwell, Cromwell! I must have done with Cromwell, if there be life enough left in me: then off to some foreign place, Swiss mountain-side, Scotch moor,&#x2014;only <hi rend="italic">far</hi> enough from Cockneydom,&#x2014;and there stay till one <hi rend="italic">be</hi> tired!</p>
<p>Glamorganshire is too distant for a Country house; measured by time it is farther than the South shore of the Solway,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Solway Firth, inlet between Scotland and England.</note> from which one&#x2019;s poor old native hills are visible. Alas, I feel at present as if I should never see Glamorganshire again,&#x2014;or not for many long years.</p>
<p>My Wife is, for these two weeks, gone to Lancashire, where the last Uncle she has, almost the last cousins and kindred she has, reside: I am a Hermit till she return; and very busy.</p>
<p><closer><salute>I send my very kind regards to your good Mother&#x2014;I pray all good to be with you; and am always</salute></closer></p>

<p>Alas, Dearest, there is no little Note from thee today: the poor little throat is still disordered? I wish I knew at worst; for one&#x2019;s fancy is apt to be not better than the reality! Pray do write to me tomorrow;&#x2014;I mean indeed <hi rend="italic">today</hi>, tho&#x2019; it is impossible that my petition can effect it: if I do not hear tomorrow either&#x2014;!</p>
<p>For one thing I do hope Mrs Paulet still keeps you in the quiet room. Sitting there, alone, within sight of the sea, and with perhaps a re<supplied>[a]</supplied>sonable<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted here and in penultimate sentence.</note> Book, to read in spite of <foreign><hi rend="italic">sniftering</hi></foreign> [sniffling], it will not <pb id="pg-18-123" n="18:123"/>be so bad. At worst, the cure is physic and a course of slops. Do tell me that it is over,&#x2014;my poor little Jean!</p>
<p>I have got little done today; answering the multiplicity of useless Letters. I have told Redwood that most probably I shall never see Glamorganshire more; at least not for an indefinite extent of years: he is a real weariness to me, that poor gaunt Welsh admirer; I wish I had not gone to his house, or ever hinted at going. With Cary on Saturday I <hi rend="italic">am</hi> to dine; poor old Cary!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >H. F. Cary.</note> I wish I knew Mazzini&#x2019;s Address specifically: the Lady Harriet gave me a Book for him on Sunday, and here it still lies. &#x201C;37. Devonshire Street&#x201D;: was not that it? I will at least try that, on Saturday when I shall be at Cary&#x2019;s in that region, if not sooner. <hi rend="italic">Punch</hi> has come today, still full of flogging to poor Sir James; the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> too, I find, is thundering as over a lost man, &#x201C;sinking, sinking!&#x201D;&#x2014; The Coleridges have no chance of me at dinner,&#x2014;<foreign>ach Gott!</foreign>&#x2014;nor of &#x201C;Mrs Carlyle&#x201D; either: if the time prove favourable, I mean to walk that way after tea. Derwent called the day before yesterday leaving a card (I do not insert it, to avoid weight): His sister coming, most anxious, a Miss Southey<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sara Coleridge (<date when="1802-00-00">1802</date>&#x2013;<date when="1852-00-00">52</date>; <ref target="volume-18/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/5889"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>) and Kate Southey, youngest of the poet&#x2019;s four surviving children (see <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410902-TC-JWC-01"><sic>13:240&#x2013;41</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1841-09-02">2 Sept. 1841</date></corr></ref>).</note> to be there too,&#x2014;<foreign><hi rend="italic">&#xE0; la bonne heure</hi></foreign> [just so]! Darwin called yesterday while I was with Milnes;
left two Books (<hi rend="italic">Strafford</hi><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably Sterling&#x2019;s (<date when="1843-00-00">1843</date>), but possibly Browning&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Strafford: An Historical Tragedy</hi> (<date when="1837-00-00">1837</date>).</note> your one), the second of them addressed Kajinski.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably Krasinski.</note>&#x2014; There was also an immense Letter from poor Edinburgh Dodds, who talks of coming up to try his fortune in London. I have answered, asking him, &#x201C;If he dare?&#x201D;</p>
<p>Poor Strachey<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Apparently a letter from Edward Strachey.</note> I send; hope springs eternal! My Moonface <hi rend="italic">was</hi> out, and there could only be a card. Today, after showerbath, I am for Miss Wilson&#x2019;s; you will see whether a card there will suffice!&#x2014; &#x2014; Ellen roasted <hi rend="italic">both</hi> my hen-quarters yesterday; what waste! It was &#x201C;the <foreign>flees</foreign> [flies],&#x201D; and I had nothing more to say. The wing remains cold for this days dinner. I am better now again, tho&#x2019; still bilious to a high degree,&#x2014;sleeping irresistibly after dinner &#x26;c. Today is to be my first shower-bath; in the evening I do propose going over to the Maurice Garden, and actually doing myself the inexpressible benefit of raising <foreign>reek</foreign> [smoke] there. They have brought over pipes; they have &#x201C;sent the key&#x201D; often enough: I really begin to have remorse. Stupid Cromwell Books will keep me going after that till my eyes fall together.</p>
<p>Brother Jack seems to be about Kirkchrist at Mrs Church&#x2019;s; I had <pb id="pg-18-124" n="18:124"/>a poor Note yesternight from Jenny, who has been &#x201C;really ill&#x201D; with a tedious cold, now mostly off again.&#x2014; But now for the shower-bath.</p>
<p>My dear good little Wifie, write to me that the throat is better; that things go well with thee. O my dear, my own poor dear,&#x2014;I declare I could greet a good deal; but it would not serve. <closer><salute>God ever bless thee, my poor little Jeanie!</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>Dearest</salute> had I got your little note yesterday morning it might have put strength in me to write&#x2014;but tho&#x2019; addressed to the house,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Seaforth House is three miles or so down river from Liverpool, Bootleward; a bare kind of big mansion (once Gladstone senior&#x2019;s [Sir John, father of W. E.]), in these years rented by the Paulets, extensive merchant people. Paulet was a good, cleverish Genoese; Mrs. Paulet, an early friend of Geraldine Jewsbury, a strange, indolently ingenious, artistic, &#x26;c., creature, very reverent of <hi rend="italic">us</hi> at this time.&#x2014;T.C.&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note in <hi rend="italic">LM</hi>). Paulet apparently was Swiss.</note> it was delivered to M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Paulet at his office, &#x26; I only received it when he came home at night. Thus left to myself I was ashamed to say that I was no better&#x201D;&#x2014; I thought no news at all would be more agreeable to you than that&#x2014; In fact I had <hi rend="italic">slept</hi> only from four till five&#x2014;and had again to keep my bed till midday&#x2014;but now thanks god I am <hi rend="italic">really</hi> recovered&#x2014; Last night I had an excellent sleep&#x2014;and was the first down to breakfast this morning&#x2014;and the aching is all gone out of my head and bones and if I commit no imprudence as certainly I shall be careful not to do&#x2014;I may consider my <hi rend="italic">cold</hi> finished off.</p>
<p>I have nothing to complain of here in the way of noise&#x2014;the House itself is &#x201C;of the nature of a <hi rend="italic">drum&#x201D;</hi> I perceive; one of my own <hi rend="italic">sneezes</hi> runs thro it from end to end like &#x201C;a great explosure in the Kent Road&#x201D;!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370321-TC-JAC-01"><sic>9:176</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1837-03-21">21 March 1837</date></corr></ref>.</note> but the people are extremely quiet during the night and late <pb id="pg-18-125" n="18:125"/>risers&#x2014;and there are no cocks or cats or external disturbances that I have yet discovered. M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Paulet makes an excellent Hostess, (<hi rend="italic">morally</hi> speaking)&#x2014; Her <foreign><hi rend="italic">menage</hi></foreign> is certainly susceptible of great improvements&#x2014;especially in the article of cookery&#x2014;but one would prefer living on any sort of victuals, <hi rend="italic">not poisoned</hi> in such pleasant company to having the preparations of Uds<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unexplained, perhaps a corruption of &#x201C;Lords&#x201D;; Froude prints &#x201C;these,&#x201D; which it cannot be.</note> and stupidity therewith.

<p>Geraldine is under eclipse since yesterday morning&#x2014;a severe fit of biliousness having not only taken the <hi rend="italic">wit</hi> out of her but the <hi rend="italic">good-nature</hi>, for a wonder&#x2014;! to see Geraldine <hi rend="italic">cross</hi> is a sight for sore eyes!&#x2014; The <hi rend="small-caps">Parent</hi> is gone&#x2014;and also the <foreign>gorb</foreign> [unfledged bird] of a governess whom you saw<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On his visit, <date when="1843-08-02">2 Aug. 1843</date>, when he also met Julia Newton.</note>&#x2014;in <hi rend="italic">her</hi> room they have got a dumpy, nothing-at-all-little german;&#x2014;(how ungraceful these german women are!) whom nobody seem to mind, not even the children, any more than if she were made of clouts!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I meant to have gone back to Maryland Street on Saturday&#x2014;for to make the removal here a final Coming away proved impossible&#x2014;my Uncle would have been quite angry and the girls hurt, so I engaged to go back there for a few days&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">now</hi>, I am not going till Monday, having <hi rend="italic">lost</hi> so much of the time in bed. You ask where I shall be on my <pb id="pg-18-126" n="18:126"/>Birthday&#x2014; My dear in what view do you ask? to send me something?&#x2014; Now I positively forbid you to send me anything but a letter with your blessing&#x2014; It is a positive worry for you the <hi rend="italic">buying of things</hi>&#x2014;and what is the chief pleasure of a birthday-present?&#x2014;simply that it is evidence of ones birthday having been remembered&#x2014;and now I know already without any bothering present that you have been thinking of it my poor good<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Good is masculine for Goody&#x2014;my frequent name for her.&#x2014;T.C.&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note in <hi rend="italic">LM</hi>).</note> for ever so long before!&#x2014; So write me a longer letter than usual and leave <hi rend="italic">presents</hi> to those whose affection stands more in need of vulgar demonstrations than yours does.</p>

<salute>My dear Madam,</salute>
<p>You are very kind; and your remembrance is highly gratifying to me.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >She had sent A. P. Stanley, <hi rend="italic">The Life and Correspondence of Thomas Arnold</hi>, 2 vols. (<date when="1844-00-00">1844</date>).</note> I well recollect that happy day I passed in your house; a day very memorable to me in itself, and rendered doubly so by the tragedy which soon followed. Every circumstance of those hours is still present to me, and will be: in particular a sentiment of yours, about the instability of all earthly blessedness, which you uttered, looking out upon the two beautiful merry Boys<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Either boys from Rugby School or Arnold&#x2019;s sons, two of whom were then age fourteen and sixteen.</note> seated outside the carriage there, has often come impressively to mind. Alas, the sword was already brandished to strike; and it was as if you had heard the whizzing of it in the air!&#x2014;</p>
<p>It has given me true satisfaction to learn from time to time that you bear your great bereavement, the greatest that could well fall on a human being without guilt, in a brave and devout manner. &#x201C;Tho&#x2019; He slay me, yet will I trust in Him.&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Job 13:15.</note> We have no other wisdom here below. The voice of all the Prophets and the Wise speaks very stead-fastly, responded to by our own inner voice, &#x201C;Be of hope.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Surely the kind Gift you announce shall be ranked among my precious things;&#x2014;precious for its intrinsic qualities, and for the adjuncts <pb id="pg-18-127" n="18:127"/>connected with it. From all quarters I hear it commended, on many sides I have already snatched specimens of it: my first two days of leisure have, for a month back, been preappointed for a deliberate perusal of the work. I shall read my own copy of it with a new clearness, and re-read it.</p>
<p>May all blessing be with you, my dear Madam; may strength be lent you for the Duties you have yet to do here, which is the summary of all blessings.</p>
<p><closer><salute>With many thanks, with much regard, I am always</salute></closer></p>

<p>I find myself in a little difficulty which you can help me out of&#x2014; <hi rend="italic">Sunday</hi> is my Birthday, on which Mary and Margaret must drink my health (in a good cup of tea at the least) or I shall not think that my new year has begun luckily for me.

<p>I am here in a very beautiful place with a very favourite friend and <hi rend="italic">might</hi> have got a great deal of pleasure out of the visit <hi rend="italic">if</hi> (there is always an if in worldly affairs) I had not been laid up most of the time with a bad cold&#x2014; I shall stay a few days in Maryland Street on my return to Liverpool and then home to my Husband who must be pretty well tired of having to order his own dinners by this time&#x2014;</p>

<salute>Dear Miss Wilson,</salute>
<p>This evening at half-past eight or nine I will with great pleasure join you, and stay till you put me away. Dinner, alas, is beyond my faculty: to-morrow I am engaged to old Cary Dante; and two days together would entirely kill me! What would become of you then? You would have to deplore a lost Brother, not guilty towards you but unfortunate, with many tears!&#x2014;</p>

<p><salute>Thanks, Dearest;</salute> here is the Note reporting that the cold is gone, and all well! I shall fancy you very tolerably off now, for a day or two. Be in no haste to exchange the big house and the Sea shore for Maryland Street,&#x2014;be in haste only, if there must be haste, to exchange them for Chelsea! You cannot stay long in that hubbub of sooty Liverpool, I fear, without getting your bits of nerves all spoiled again. What has become of Chorleydom? Have you anything to do with that?</p>
<p>Alas, my dear Necessary Evil, I am doing little good here; my progress at any work, in spite of all endeavours and remorses, is small. Endeavour? Alas, my &#x2018;endeavour&#x2019; is not so much a hearty <hi rend="italic">pushing against</hi> my work as a helpless powerless <hi rend="italic">lying down</hi> upon it: the hot weather and perverse destinies are against me. <foreign>Eheu</foreign> [Alas]!</p>
<p>Last night the Maurice smoking could not take effect; Maurice had gone out to dine. I walked on to Anthony Sterling&#x2019;s; Mrs Prior,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edward Sterling&#x2019;s sister.</note> Mrs Anthony, A. himself: a dull irrational hour of time.&#x2014; Judge if a card served Miss Wilson; judge if virtue be its own reward! I have positively declined the dinner, volunteered to go after tea&#x2014; The baronet Salusbury<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably the Rev. Sir Charles John Salusbury (<date when="1792-00-00">1792</date>&#x2013;<date when="1868-00-00">1868</date>), 3d bart., of Llanwern, Monmouthshire; d. unm. He and Thomas Wilson were Cambridge contemporaries.</note>&#x2014;I have some gaunt recollection of him. The Sir and the Lady and the whole business: distilled quintessence of <foreign>ennui</foreign> could not <pb id="pg-18-129" n="18:129"/>threaten to be duller! One must submit to fate. Last night, however, I escaped little Masson; perhaps he won&#x2019;t come again for some time!</p>
<p>I remember your Mrs Darbyshire, your Miss Newton with her hungry enthusiasms, her haggard Catholic chimeras: it was an admirable arrangement,&#x2014;acid and alkali combining into harmless neutral salt! Geraldine, however, must recover her good humour.</p>
<p>Who told you I meant any gifts, you little fool? Certainly I will write you a Letter!&#x2014; Today I send you <hi rend="italic">Punch:</hi> if you had seen the Statue &#x26; Fresco Exhibition in West<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Hall,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The number included an article and two pp. of illustrations to &#x201C;Punch&#x2019;s Fine Art Exhibition of Designs for National Statues,&#x201D; including &#x201C;Mercury giving Graham an Insight into Letters.&#x201D;</note> you would enjoy a certain Page of it still more.&#x2014; Here are heavy showers, interspersed with glaring sunshine; I am for a sh<hi rend="italic">r</hi> bath and out nevertheless. <closer><salute>Bless thee dear little Jean!</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dearest Babbie</salute>
<p>Thanks for your letter,&#x2014;doubly welcome that I was not expecting it. for the <hi rend="italic">justice</hi> of the matter was clearly that <hi rend="italic">I</hi> should write rather than <hi rend="italic">you</hi>&#x2014; My cold is not <hi rend="italic">quite</hi> gone&#x2014;at least I do not feel it safe to take the smallest liberty with myself&#x2014;durst no more, for instance, drink two tumblers of porter and two glasses of champaign and a glass of maidera all in one day than eat fire; but I am able to keep out of bed and go a <hi rend="italic">little</hi> into the open air which is here very <hi rend="italic">open</hi> indeed&#x2014;and am no longer the miserable being I was in the first days&#x2014;</p>
<p>I have had another trial of temper however substituted for the cold in my head&#x2014;an out-break&#x2014;in <hi rend="italic">practical</hi> form of what Geraldine <hi rend="italic">rightly</hi> termed her <hi rend="italic">tiger-jealousy</hi>&#x2014; I will tell you all about it when I come on Monday, suffice to say meanwhile that M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Jordan in <hi rend="italic">The Jealous Wife</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A dramatic adaptation of Fielding&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Tom Jones</hi>, by George Colman, the elder (<date when="1734-00-00">1734</date>&#x2013;<date when="1794-00-00">94</date>).

<salute>Dearest Good</salute>
<p>You are really a jewel of a husband in the article of writing!&#x2014;it is <hi rend="italic">such</hi> a comfort to me when the nice looking little letter drops surely in! Yesterday again however I did not get it till night&#x2014;and now I <hi rend="italic">understand</hi> the reason of this&#x2014; Letters addressed to <hi rend="italic">M</hi>r Paulet are all delivered at the office&#x2014;and those to <hi rend="italic">M</hi>rs Paulet come on by the cross post to the house&#x2014;and are here about eleven oclock&#x2014; Pity that we had not understood this sooner&#x2014; My cold is pretty well gone&#x2014; I dare not take all the liberty I should like with myself in this beautiful place&#x2014;but I can go out now in <hi rend="italic">moderation</hi>&#x2014;and can <hi rend="italic">enjoy</hi> what <hi rend="italic">joy</hi> is going&#x2014; It is really curious however how the Devil is always busy&#x2014; No sooner have I got rid of my headach and sore throat than a new botheration arises for me in what Geraldine <hi rend="italic">rightly</hi> termed her <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;Tiger-Jealousy&#x201D;</hi> You will hardly be able to conceive how <hi rend="italic">this</hi> could be anything beyond <hi rend="italic">laughable</hi> but I assure you it has entirely spoiled my comfort for the last twenty four hours and not only mine but M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Paulets and everybody else&#x2019;s in the house.&#x2014; We were fancying her bilious and it turned out to have been all rage at <hi rend="italic">me</hi> for &#x201C;giving such a <hi rend="italic">stab</hi> to her feelings as she <pb id="pg-18-131" n="18:131"/>had never suffered the like of from man or woman&#x201D;&#x2014;she came here on the understanding that I was to go back with her to Manchester and stay there a few days on the road to London&#x2014; But the day before yesterday when she was alone with me in my room I wearied out with my cold, and feeling that I had to go back to Maryland Street in the first instance&#x2014;it very naturally fell from me&#x2014;&#x201C;but since we are together <hi rend="italic">here</hi> Geraldine&#x2014;the going to Manchester does not seem to be any longer necessary? She answered me pettishly that &#x201C;if I <hi rend="italic">wished</hi> to <hi rend="italic">sacrifice</hi> her to M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Paulet and the Welshes&#x2014;in Gods name to do so&#x201D;!&#x2014; and went off in a nice little <hi rend="italic">tiff</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Geraldine Jewsbury had warned, in her letter of <date when="1844-06-20">20 June</date>, that &#x201C;I am as jealous as a Turk, and don&#x2019;t, besides, care half a straw for seeing my friends except <foreign><hi rend="italic">t&#xEA;te-&#xE0;-t&#xEA;te</hi></foreign>, when I feel strongly disposed to assassinate everybody who does not keep out of reach!&#x201D;</note>&#x2014; But I never thought of her being seriously offended&#x2014; And she had thrown the whole company into consternation by her rudeness to M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Paulet and Myself before we fancied she was anything else than &#x201C;out of sorts&#x201D;&#x2014; All yesterday however her vagaries exceeded my reminiscences of M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Jordan in <hi rend="italic">The Jealous Wife!</hi>&#x2014; Nothing but outbursts of impertinence and hysterics from morning till night&#x2014;which finished off with a grand <hi rend="italic">scene</hi> in my room after I had gone up to bed a full and faithful account of which I shall entertain you with at meeting&#x2014; It was a <hi rend="italic">revealation</hi> to me not only of Geraldine but of human nature!&#x2014;such mad <hi rend="italic">lover-like</hi> jealousy on the part of one woman towards another it had never entered into my heart to conceive&#x2014; By a wonderful effort of <hi rend="italic">patience</hi> on my part&#x2014;made more on M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Paulets account who was quite vexed&#x2014;than from the <hi rend="italic">flattering</hi> consideration that <hi rend="italic">I</hi> was the object of this incomprehensible passion, the affair was brought to a happy conclusion&#x2014; I got her to laugh over her own absurdity promised to go by Manchester if she would behave herself like a reasonable creature and with her hair all dishevelled and her face all bewept she thereupon sat down at my feet and&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;smoked a cigaritto!! with all the placidity in life!&#x2014; She keeps a regular supply of these little things&#x2014;and smokes them before all the world. In fact I am not at all sure that she is not <hi rend="italic">going mad!</hi> And M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Paulet too declares she often feels quite anxious about her.</p>
<p>I like this M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Darbyshire very much&#x2014;and another Lady<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mrs. Ames.</note> who was here yesterday enchanted me with her music&#x2014; I never heard such singing in my life&#x2014; So send the <hi rend="italic">trio</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-18/lt-18440710-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1844-07-10">10 July</date></ref>.</note> for Gods sake&#x2014; I keep to my purpose of going back to Maryland Street on Monday</p>

<salute>My Dearest,</salute>
<p>I promised you a <hi rend="italic">longer</hi> Letter; and behold, in my confusion, surrounded by above twenty <hi rend="italic">folios</hi>, I have mistaken the hour; thought it was 2 when it was 3,&#x2014;and I have to be at Cary&#x2019;s at 5;&#x2014;and on the whole there will be as good as no Letter at all! And it is the poor Goody&#x2019;s birthday too, when she reads this, and one ought to have <hi rend="italic">said</hi> what the inner man sufficiently feels that one is right glad to see the brave little Goody, with the mind&#x2019;s and the heart&#x2019;s eye, on such an occasion; and wishes and prays all good in this world and in all worlds to one&#x2019;s poor little Goody,&#x2014;a brave little woman, and on the whole a Necessary Evil to a man!&#x2014; All that, you see, is up.</p>
<p>Yesternight at the Wilson&#x2019;s I was driven nearly over the limits! Ditchwater was as nitrous-oxide to the thing we had. <foreign>Ach Gott!</foreign> A poor little Mrs Something fresh from Wor&#x2019;ster Cathedral, whom I was said to &#x2018;know,&#x2019; but did not in the least; complaining of horrid German vulgarity, thrice horrid German irreligion: baronet Salusbury himself&#x2014;the Devil stick him on the top of Salisbury Steeple for me,&#x2014;Yankee-doodledoodom itself could not beat him. A man with some defect about his eyes; one glass of his spectacles ground quite differently from the other, so that when you looked thro&#x2019; it it made his one eye as big as a bullock&#x2019;s, the other remaining of its natural size; an unbounded talker too, clack-clack, with a flavour of orthodox wit,&#x2014;twaddle smaller than the poorest of penny-wheep:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Very weak beer originally sold for a penny a bottle.</note> and I drank a cup of bad coffee, and lost two hours sleep by the job; confound it and all such!&#x2014; Today also is rainy, and I have to go to the Museum region,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >British Museum, Bloomsbury, where H. F. Cary lived.</note> and be bored again. You say I have no patience?&#x2014; Well, let us forget them altogether.</p>
<p>And now, Dearest, here is the small gift one of the smallest ever sent! Do not think it cost me any trouble to buy the thing; once fairly in the enterprize there was a real pleasure in going thro&#x2019; with it. Besides the people are good honest creatures; the <foreign><hi rend="italic">Papier-Mach&#xE9;</hi></foreign> people whom you know. I tried hard for a workbox, but there was none I could recommend to myself; I was forced to be content with a little Jewel-box, and there you see is the key!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On a small enclosure TC wrote: &#x201C;Key of a small Jewel-box that waits Goody on her return. / T. C&#x201D;; and on the back: &#x201C;&#x2014;<date when="1844-07-14">14 july, 1844</date>&#x2014;.&#x201D;</note> Blessings on thee with it; I <pb id="pg-18-133" n="18:133"/>wish I had diamonds to fill the place with for my little Wifie!&#x2014; I knew you had a Jewel-box already, but this is a newer one, a far smaller one;&#x2014;besides I bought it very cunningly, and &#x201C;the Lady, if she would like anything better, can at any time get it exchanged here, whenever she pleases.&#x201D; Is not that something? I am not sure but it will grow into a workbox, after all; for they can fit you up &#x201C;the inside&#x201D; in <hi rend="italic">any</hi> plan you please. And so dear Goody, kiss me, and take my good wishes. While I am here, there will never want one to wish thee all good,&#x2014;my poor little <foreign>bairn</foreign>!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Perhaps you had better not go to Manchester, if you can help it, after all? Geraldine seems to me every way likely to go crazy, since there is no outlet otherwise. Poor Geraldine, a good creature too But the <foreign><hi rend="italic">Endlich toll-werdenden</hi></foreign> [ones who are becoming ultimately mad] are never pleasant company I think.&#x2014; However, she has a nice enough little quiet house, very quiet, I should think and it is not far out of your way. Do what seems best to your own Interrogation-faculty on the spot. And so <foreign>Adieu</foreign>, Dearest, on thy Birthday, and may the worst of our days be all done, and the best still coming! <closer><salute>Thine evermore</salute></closer> <name>T.

<p><salute>No word from Goody today; which is a kind of disappointment, tho&#x2019; an unreasonable one, to the human mind!</salute> Pray only the poor Goody have not got her sore throat back again,&#x2014;all will be well, and we shall hear of her tomorrow.&#x2014; Or perhaps you did not get my Note at all <hi rend="italic">yesterday</hi>, there being no post on Sunday?

<p>Saturday grew wetter and wetter; a perfect steep of rain, which escorted me up to Cary&#x2019;s at the Museum, and escorted Darley and me down again (with mud enough), and continued all night. Dinner dull as dumps; old Cary a venerable good kind of soul, worth going to once; but his three sons very snuffy, limited and even foolish persons. The wife of one of them a &#x2018;professed beauty&#x2019;&#x2014;one of the worst trades in this world!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cary had six sons, and those mentioned are unidentified, as is the wife.</note> Darley was our main element; judge what the general sum of resources was! And I have lost (partly) two nights of sleep by <pb id="pg-18-134" n="18:134"/>the job, and have been as ill as a dinner of the highest sublimity need have made me.</p>
<p>Yesterday and today the weather is brisk wind with fitful sun and shadow; delightful to me. I walked, after a little work yesterday up to Mazzini&#x2019;s with his book, and back again; M<hi rend="italic">i</hi> not in.

Old Stimabile, Darwin; then after dinner, Fleming<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henry Fleming (d. <date when="1876-00-00">1876</date>); asst. sec. of poor law board, <date when="1848-00-00">1848</date>&#x2013;<date when="1859-00-00">59</date>; permanent sec., <date when="1859-00-00">1859</date>&#x2013;<date when="1871-00-00">71</date>. Introduced into society by Charles Buller, he &#x201C;made his way by his pleasant manners and amusing gossip. It was said that when Lady Palmerston wanted to know which way the political wind blew, she sent him out on a horse in the Park. He was very good-looking, and [no one could] &#x2026; guess his age. He wore an undeniable brown wig, and had a lovely complexion and brilliant teeth, how much due to art no one could tell&#x201D; (Mary C. M. S. Simpson, <hi rend="italic">Many Memories of Many People</hi> [<date when="1898-00-00">1898</date>] 115). According to another account Fleming was &#x201C;a kindly little man, &#x2026; commonly known as the &#x2018;Flea.&#x2019; &#x2026; He was well known in society, a friend of Charles Buller&#x2019;s, and an <foreign><hi rend="italic">habitu&#xE9;</hi></foreign> of Lady Palmerston&#x2019;s house. He was much made up; and when Lady Ashburton was told of his house being entered by burglars, &#x2018;It was hard on him,&#x2019; she said; &#x2018;for he could not move, having unfortunately left his backbone on the dressing-table&#x2019;&#x201D; (Algernon West, <hi rend="italic">Recollections <date when="1832-00-00">1832</date> to <date when="1886-00-00">1886</date></hi> [<date when="1899-00-00">1899</date>] 1:86&#x2013;87). His obituary in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, <date when="1876-03-03">3 March 1876</date>, said: &#x201C;He was a welcome member of society which his official chiefs [of the poor law board] could often not aspire to enter. &#x2026; As no one seemed to know his age, it was a constant subject of jocose speculation. His familiarity with Lord Palmerston was attributed to the alleged fact that Lord Palmerston had been his fag at Harrow.&#x201D;</note> on horseback to ask If Mrs Carlyle was home?&#x2014;perhaps by Mrs Buller&#x2019;s order? He would not come in, tho&#x2019; I by message invited him. In the evening I gave Helen two hours of <foreign><hi rend="italic">outrake</hi></foreign> [freedom to venture out], and myself wrote Cromwell stuff the while. And now for the showerbath and the walk.</p>
<p>Do you go today to Maryland Street? I believe so, for the little Dame usually keeps her word. And when to Manchester? And when home? God bless thee, my little one. Write a word, after all!&#x2014; These two Letters came on Saturday. <closer><salute>Ever thy affectionate</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>Oh my Darling&#x2014;</salute>I want to give you an <hi rend="italic">emphatic kiss</hi> rather than to write!&#x2014; But you are at Chelsea&#x2014;and I at Seaforth, so the thing is clearly impossible for the moment! But I will keep it for you till I come; for it is not with words that I can thank you adequately for that kindest of birthday-letters and its <hi rend="italic">small enclosure</hi>&#x2014; Touching little key! I cried over it and laughed over it! and could not sufficiently admire the graceful idea&#x2014;an idea which might come under the category of what Cavaignac used to call &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">idees de femme</hi></foreign> [woman&#x2019;s ideas]&#x201D;&#x2014;supposed to be unattainable by the coarser sex! and I have put the little key to my chain and shall wear it there till I return. I was vexed that I could not tell you yesterday how much you had pleased me&#x2014;but the letters were not given out at Seaforth till it was too late for writing by return of post. M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Paulet sent for them at eleven&#x2014;but the postmaster is <hi rend="italic">evangelical</hi> and declined giving them out till after church time! On the whole it was a <hi rend="italic">good</hi> birth-day, yesterday was!&#x2014; M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Paulet knew; for my Cousion Helen in a note to her had regretted that &#x201C;Cousin was not to be there on her birthday.&#x201D;&#x2014;indeed the wish <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to be <hi rend="italic">there</hi> had been one reason for my staying where I was&#x2014;the <foreign><hi rend="italic">rosbeefe</hi></foreign> [roast-beef] and dreadfully prosaical demonstrations with which such anniversaries are kept at Maryland Street make me always horribly sad&#x2014; M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Paulet managed the thing with a better grace&#x2014;not a word was said on the subject; only after dinner I noticed on the table a majestic cake and a peculiar looking bottle of wine&#x2014;when M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Paulet had filled all our glasses with this precious liquor&#x2014;(which certainly must have been the nectar which was drunk by the Gods&#x2014;) he suddenly sprung up, fetched a large rose from behind a screen, and presented it to me saying &#x201C;Madam may you have every happiness that your heart desires&#x201D;! and then drank to me, the rest all doing the same without knowing very well why&#x2014;for M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Paulet had told nobody but <hi rend="italic">him</hi>&#x2014; She has a beautiful tact that woman! I really love her considerably!&#x2014;it is a thousand pities to see her wasted on such a place as Liverpool</p>
<p>I am not going back to Maryland street till tomorrow&#x2014;A M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Ames&#x2014;the musical Lady I told you of&#x2014;was here again on Friday and pressed me to go to a party at her house this evening&#x2014;the Martineaus<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James and Helen, b. Higginson (<date when="1804-00-00">1804</date>&#x2013;<date when="1877-00-00">77</date>), m. <date when="1828-00-00">1828</date>.</note> were to meet me&#x2014;music of the spheres &#x26;c &#x26;c&#x2014;M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Paulet <pb id="pg-18-136" n="18:136"/>and the rest were anxious I should go with them and so I settled to go&#x2014;and now it is found stupid that I should go to Maryland Street beforehand&#x2014;and stupid that I should go <hi rend="italic">after</hi> the party which will be late; so I am to return to Seaforth to sleep&#x2014;and a messenger is just despatched to tell them not to look for me&#x2014;They will not be at all pleased&#x2014;but really it is too hard that when I am having a lark I cannot follow my own inclinations without exciting <hi rend="italic">tiger-jealousies</hi>.</p>
<p>Geraldine is returned to her usual devotion&#x2014;but the recollection of her extravagancies will not be easily effaced from <hi rend="italic">my</hi> mind or any one&#x2019;s who <hi rend="italic">assisted</hi> at them&#x2014; I set the whole company into fits of laughter the other night by publickly saying to her after she had been flirting with a certain M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Tel&#xf3;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not further identified.</note> that &#x201C;I wondered she should expect me to behave decently to her after she had for a whole evening been making love before my very face to <hi rend="italic">another man</hi>&#x201D;!</p>
<p>That M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Darbyshire is really a good woman&#x2014;deserves to be something better than a Unitarian. When she <hi rend="italic">does</hi> stand up for &#x201C;virtue and all that sort of thing&#x201D; it is with an <hi rend="italic">unsystematic</hi> simplicity that mitigates the offence even in <hi rend="italic">my</hi> eyes&#x2014;</p>
<p>But Oh dear, here have they been with a riding habit and &#x201C;the usual trimmings&#x201D; and a horse is ready in the stable. I said last night that I used to ride&#x2014;and <foreign><hi rend="italic">voila</hi></foreign> [there is] the result! As it is not a Paulet-horse but some other Lady&#x2019;s it is to be hoped it will be sure enough&#x2014; <closer><salute>God bless you Dearest ever your affectionate</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Not to lose a Post, I forthwith despatch Alick&#x2019;s Letter, just received,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; I have not time to write a word along with it. Alick&#x2019;s situation, with all his children planting Indian-corn around him, looks to me much cheerfuller than it had done for a long while.</p>
<p>I am still alone; working among Cromwell&#x2019;s Letters. Jane has been for a week with the Paulet&#x2019;s; and has got back, this very day as I compute, to her Uncle&#x2019;s. She will only stay there a day or two, I fancy; then another day or two at Manchester; and then home. She is very well, according to her own account.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-18-137" n="18:137"/>Write to me minutely how my good Mother is. I had Jenny&#x2019;s Letter duly; I figured them all at the Ecclefechan Sacrament last Sunday. Tell me exactly how she is. And do not relax your efforts about the House<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For their mother.</note> while you are there.&#x2014; I will answer more copiously when you write next.</p>
<p>I am bound at present to a Tea with certain stupid Derwent Coleridges here&#x2014;ah me!&#x2014;and am already too late!</p>

<p><salute>Thanks, Dearest, for thy good little Note, for thy two rose-leaves, for thy kiss&#x2014;payable on sight!</salute> I have not a particle of news, good or bad; but I scribble a line before dinner, according to my wont.</p>
<p>It was very well to stay and hear your music; I like better to fancy you there than at Maryland Street amid the noise and roastbeef. You will not stay long now, I think? Not after you are tired; yet till you are tired. Manchester and the mad Geraldine will not much detain you; and then&#x2014;I wait at the Railway with a &#x201C;neat fly,&#x201D; and Goody is my own again! I hope she will be better too, for this little bit of roaming; she is a stationary creature generally.</p>
<p>Today a great smell of suds issues from the lower regions; I consider it is the bewildered little <foreign><hi rend="italic">dottle</hi></foreign> [small particle] of a body engaged in washing its bits of duds. She is forever busy, just as when you were here; and, tho&#x2019; there is or can be next to no cleaning of rooms, or work that one can discover as when you were here and the house frequented, she never seems a whit nearer the end of her job. She cooks me my quarter of fowl in an unexceptionable manner, and I do not interfere farther.</p>
<p>I have bought a new pen-knife! At Baring&#x2019;s, being driven to dress in a hurried manner &#x2018;in Mr Buller&#x2019;s room,&#x2019; I had left my good old pen-knife lying there, and, after twenty years of service, it is lost to me forever, I fear! I applied to the valet since, who is a most obliging man; expended another shilling on the job, and commissioned him to send me the old knife by post; but nothing comes; I infer that nothing will come, and so have gone again to the shop. Very sorry indeed.&#x2014; Our &#x2018;Alexis&#x2019; too, as you see by the Note, has come to nothing. He is a <pb id="pg-18-138" n="18:138"/>French miracle of Animal Magnetism, this Alexis, whom all the quality are running after;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alexis Didier (b. ca. <date when="1824-00-00">1824</date>), Belgian, a <foreign>prot&#xE9;g&#xE9;</foreign> of the Rev. Chaunc<sic>e</sic>y Hare Townshend (<date when="1798-00-00">1798</date>&#x2013;<date when="1868-00-00">1868</date>; <ref target="volume-18/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/27622"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), who brought him forward as a medium under mesmerism. Dickens and many others were impressed, although Fanny Kemble thought he &#x201C;practised on the credulity of London society&#x201D;; see Fred Kaplan, <hi rend="italic">Dickens and Mesmerism</hi> (Princeton, <date when="1975-00-00">1975</date>) 64.</note>&#x2014;an arrant humbug, as Anthony Sterling who had seen him told me; he is very welcome to fail, forever and a day if he like.</p>
<p>I also, being once in the Ironmonger&#x2019;s shop, procured me a spade; remarkable conquest, if I can make any use of it. The Garden Green is very questionable since the rain: all bushy and luxuriant at the two side<supplied>[s]</supplied>;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> black, wormy, and hideous (like a scald head) in the middle,&#x2014;but there too it is now beginning to beard with a kind of new greenness. The Apple-tree will not bear one apple this year! They have all <hi rend="italic">fallen off</hi>, the last yesterday; and the foolish inexperienced Tree has taken to blossom again! Observing that distracted tendency, I this morning used the freedom to <hi rend="italic">prune</hi> the little fellow; cut away various unsightly lower branches, and said to him, as it were, &#x201C;Go to wood, then, this year, my lad, and see to get a little higher.&#x201D; Chalmers<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably Chambers, their next-door neighbor.</note> has mounted an amorphous strawhat,&#x2014;like a wooden Annandale <foreign><hi rend="italic">duddie</hi></foreign> in shape. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Duddie</hi></foreign> is a dish of turned wood; your Uncle can explain it, I doubt not. Chansellor has renewed the flags<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Flagstones. George Chancellor, 1 Cheyne Row.</note> before his door. Are not these important events?&#x2014; The Lamberts are loud as ever, and all is rolling on there again, after the old mother has gone her long road. <foreign>Ay de mi!</foreign></p>
<p>How am I ever to do the Coleridges tonight? I half prophesy that I will fall sick, take to Cromwell, and leave them and their twaddle progressing at their <hi rend="italic">own</hi> pace devilward! We shall see how the hen-broth agrees with me.&#x2014; <closer><salute>O Goody, Goody, I wish I were in thy pocket, safe. I am ever thy own, what is of me,</salute></closer></p>
<name>T. Carlyle</name>
<ps><p>Could you buy me Cloth for a new summer Coat about Manchester;&#x2014;something better than black &#x201C;stuff&#x201D; or &#x201C;Orleans Cloth&#x201D;; cost hardly to exceed ten shillings?&#x2014; No, I guess you had better not try! <foreign>Adieu</foreign>, the hour is here.</p></ps>

<dateline><place>Chelsea</place>, <date when="1844-07-17">Wednesday 17 july / 1844</date>&#x2014;</dateline>
<p>No Letter from Goody today; but indeed I hardly expected one, the poor creature being on the wing yesterday, engaged in flitting. Her cold being gone, I had nothing to be anxious about,&#x2014;for surely the Paulet horse did <hi rend="italic">not</hi> fling you off, or injure you at all, but benefit you! I will not have you bore yourself with <hi rend="italic">answering</hi> these duds of Notes; I have the pen in hand at any rate, and penny stamps close by: in your establishment I know it is very different indeed. Amuse thyself, dear Goody; do not bore thyself for any cause whatever, just at present! The poor Goody very seldom has a holiday</p>
<p>Yesterday I called for Mrs Helps; the foolish little atom has gone out of Town &#x2018;to Gravesend<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Town on Thames estuary, 22 mi. E of London.</note> for a month&#x2019;; so probably I shall have to write a Note after all. In the evening, scarcely was my sinful <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi> done, and the pipe half smoked, when there came to pass&#x2014;B&#xF6;lte. She pretended to decline coming in, to be only wanting some account of your homecoming; nevertheless at sight of me (for I was forced to lay down the pipe), she very freely came in: clattered in a wooden way, really very wearisome, about &#x2018;Sir James,&#x2019;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Graham.</note> the &#x2018;Holy Ghost&#x2019; and I know not what; consented to a cup of tea; and then, thank Heaven, went her ways. She had left Grahamdom only on Saturday night: I suppose she came to see if there were quarters here. Mrs Buller, &#x2018;greatly improved <pb id="pg-18-143" n="18:143"/>at Troston,&#x2019; is coming hither in about a fortnight. B&#xF6;lte is decidedly very poor company.</p>
<p>The evening being spoiled, I went off to the Coleridges; Trench,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Richard Chenevix Trench (<date when="1807-00-00">1807</date>&#x2013;<date when="1886-00-00">86</date>; <ref target="volume-18/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/27702"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), poet and clergyman; B.A., Trinity College, Cambridge, <date when="1829-00-00">1829</date>, M.A., <date when="1833-00-00">1833</date>; member of the Cambridge Apostles and friend of Maurice, Sterling, and Tennyson; special preacher at Cambridge, <date when="1843-00-00">1843</date>, and Hulsean lecturer, <date when="1845-00-00">1845</date>&#x2013;<date when="1846-00-00">46</date>; rector of Itchenstoke, <date when="1844-00-00">1844</date>; prof. of divinity, King&#x2019;s College, London, <date when="1846-00-00">1846</date>&#x2013;<date when="1858-00-00">58</date>; dean of Westminster, <date when="1856-00-00">1856</date>; archbishop of Dublin, <date when="1863-00-00">1863</date>; author of many works on philology, history, and divinity.</note> Maurice, a Painter Boxall,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Boxall (<date when="1800-00-00">1800</date>&#x2013;<date when="1879-00-00">1879</date>; <ref target="volume-18/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/3095"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), portrait painter; later director of the National Gallery.</note> and other shovelhattish persons male and female were there assembled; the women just going upstairs as I entered. Coleridge is a noisy flunky in part, but tends too towards a better meaning. Poor little Miss Southey was sitting upstairs when we went thither: a small miniature of her Father, I remembered her once here, under other omens.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Kate Southey.</note> She is going out to Wandsworth, with Miss Fenwick and the H<hi rend="italic">y</hi> Taylors, who have taken a house there for 3 months.

I talked chiefly to her and the Southey; came home in good time, innocent of all but a cup of coffee, and two gooseberries.&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; Same date by the evening post there had come a Letter from John enclosing one from Alick. Alick, at the time of writing, had his &#x2018;horses resting and taking their dinner&#x2019;; he appeared to be working like a lion, &#x2018;getting his crop in&#x2019;; had had &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">all</hi> the children&#x2019; out, planting Indian-corn, he dibbling holes, four children dropping in seeds, and Tom covering up in the rear! Is not that a pretty sight, compared with many? Poor Alick!&#x2014;</p>
<p>This big monster of a Town is now distinctly emptying itself,&#x2014;thank God! I was in the Park one afterdinner; found it very crowded still; but supposed it was the <hi rend="italic">whole</hi> world come to take leave of it, the evening being of the brightest after an abeyance of rain. I saw no soul whom I knew; nor indeed did I look except in crossing their Cavalcade, and carriage-files,&#x2014;and there, I generally found the sample ugly upon my honour! Certainly there has been an influx of ugliness this year; whence proceeding, the gods know. These two days the sky has a distinct autumn complexion: Heaven, the year is <pb id="pg-18-144" n="18:144"/>bending downwards again! I rather think of staying still, and 
being solitary <hi rend="italic">here</hi>. Really the complete isolation I have lived in, hardly speaking once in the day, and dining on the quarter of a chicken, seems to have done me good. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, Dearest!</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dearest,</salute>
<p>Here has been Mazzini, here has been &#x2018;a Suffolk man&#x2019; (foolish blockhead, wanting nothing with me), here lastly has been Anthony Sterling; and it has struck four, and the dinner is just to be eaten! I write a word, rather to keep up my high character (in speciocity at least) than for any other purpose.</p>
<p>The horse, the Paulet horse,&#x2014;well, I think I will prohibit you from ever under any pretext making use of any Paulet vehiculatory-apparatus whatever! The Devil seems to be in them all. Think how it would have been, had the wretched animal got its will, and <hi rend="italic">broken</hi> my poor Goody into a cripple for me! The conduct of these Lancashire Gigmen, however,&#x2014;that is the most astonishing of all: Shew a good horse at any rate, whose life soever go for it!&#x2014;</p>
<p>And you <hi rend="italic">are</hi> coming home next week? There is no news equal to that, after all. Come, my poor Goody, home from thy poor little holiday; I wish to Heaven I had some better thing to welcome thee to!&#x2014; Helen is overjoyed, or professes to be so. The old Stimabile too, who is just on the wing, will still get a sight of his offended goddess: poor old fellow, he looked in for an instant last night, and had a very grey appearance; &#x201C;going to Hampshire, next week.&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; The &#x2018;smoke&#x2019; at Maurice&#x2019;s was actually accomplished last night: a most poor feat; but we did not quarrel about Theology, thank Heaven.</p>

<salute>Dearest Mrs. Russell,</salute>
<p>Thanks for your unwearied kindness. The first of your Letters forwarded from Chelsea, was awaiting me here on my return, and the other came yesterday in due course.</p>
<p>I have now the pleasure of paying my small debt to you so soon as the deluge of rain which has hindered me from going down to the Post-office would allow. Do not take the trouble of acknowledging this in writing, only as one has no great reason to put trust in the English Post at present, you can send me an old Newspaper addressed to Chelsea the beginning of next week, as a token that it is all right.</p>
<p>I find my Cousins in the midst of preserve-making&#x2014;an operation which they carry on in this house on a scale that one stands amazed before, &#x201C;as in the presence of the Infinite&#x201D;! My Uncle is much as I left him: really very well to look at, except for his feebleness in walking; his good humour is a continual surprise to me, considering his natural impatience and the irritating restrictions which he has to live under. He will sit through a long dinner eating only his mashed potatoes (By the way does Dr. Russell think <hi rend="italic">mashed potatoes</hi> a wholesome diet? I don&#x2019;t, tho&#x2019; the Doctors here tell him he may take any quantity of <hi rend="italic">that!</hi>) as content apparently to see the others <hi rend="italic">filled with good things</hi> as if he were enjoying them himself. There is a prodigious quantity of human faculty expended on the business of <hi rend="italic">eating</hi> in this place; it looks very strange to me after London where the people <hi rend="italic">eat</hi> certainly, but without any appearance of <hi rend="italic">thinking</hi> about it.</p>
<p>I go to Manchester on Saturday to stay two days with a very dear friend I have there, and then home. My absence has been longer than I originally intended; but I have heard from my Husband <hi rend="italic">every day</hi> (!) that he was getting on well enough without me, and it is not easy to get away from so many kind friends as I have here.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-18-146" n="18:146"/>Often I look towards the North with sorrowful thoughts enough. How I used to shudder before the prospect of this <hi rend="italic">sea</hi> on which I was always so sick!&#x2014; O, if I might cross it now, once more on the same errand,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >To see her mother.</note> what would I care for all the sea sickness in the world!&#x2014; Love to your Husband and Father.</p>
<closer><salute>God bless you.</salute></closer>
<closer><salute>Your ever gratefull and affectionate</salute></closer>

<p><salute>My Dearest,&#x2014;</salute> Here is another bit of nonentity which I fire off at your head, before you quit Maryland Street; the new morning must bring its new necessary evil. You are a necessary Evil yourself, are you not?</p>
<p>Today I am in the bilious line; have got very ill on with work; have had an invitation to dinner, and &#x2018;a young man&#x2019; to call for me. The invitation to dinner, I have made, or will resolutely make, into <hi rend="italic">a Tea:</hi> indigestions are too ugly to encounter for any but those that do interest us,&#x2014;far bonnier men than the Harmonious Blacksmith!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC&#x2019;s nickname for William Whewell (<date when="1794-00-00">1794</date>&#x2013;<date when="1866-00-00">1866</date>; <ref target="volume-18/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/29200"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), master of Trinity College, Cambridge; see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400627-TC-EOT-01"><sic>12:177</sic><corr>TC to EOT, <date when="1840-06-27">27 June 1840</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014; My young man, whom I have just had, was Greenock Ker the young Chancery Barrister, Scott&#x2019;s nephew.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alan Ker (ca. <date when="1819-00-00">1819</date>&#x2013;<date when="1885-00-00">85</date>), eldest son of Robert of Greenock and Ann Scott&#x2019;s nephew; called to the bar, <date when="1842-00-00">1842</date>; attorney gen., Antigua, <date when="1851-00-00">1851</date>&#x2013;<date when="1854-00-00">54</date>; chief justice of Nevis, <date when="1854-00-00">1854</date>&#x2013;<date when="1856-00-00">56</date>, and Dominica, <date when="1856-00-00">1856</date>&#x2013;<date when="1861-00-00">61</date>; puisne judge of Jamaica, <date when="1861-00-00">1861</date>&#x2013;<date when="1885-00-00">85</date>; m., <date when="1851-00-00">1851</date>, Mary Tennyson (<date when="1810-00-00">1810</date>&#x2013;<date when="1884-00-00">84</date>), Alfred&#x2019;s sister.</note> He is tremulous as a caught hare; really otherwise not a bad youth; and I have desired him to come back. Helen described him, at his first vain attempt about an hour ago, as &#x201C;an <hi rend="italic">oald</hi> gentleman that had once been here.&#x201D; Most my<hi rend="italic">ster</hi>ous!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Last night I called for Lady Harriet. The usual Buller<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charles.</note> sat there, apparently almost asleep in the &#x2018;fever of digestion,&#x2019; or stupor of digestion, when I entered; the Lady herself, in spite of her sickness, is always brisk as a huntress. Buller brightened up soon; argued, talked with me, not to great purpose but in a cheery rational manner, presided over by this Divinity; and, with one cup of innocent black tea, and a mouthful of polite human speech, I came home little injured. <pb id="pg-18-147" n="18:147"/>Mazzini is authorized to call &#x201C;next week, some evening, &#x201D;&#x2014;poor victim! At a certain turn of the conversation I was asked to come out to Addiscombe next Sunday, and could not for the moment find means of declining,&#x2014;but did internally decline, and must externally now send some Note to that effect. It is very brilliant all, at Addiscombe; wealth in abundance ruled over by grace in abundance: but I&#x2014;I am bilious, I am busy; not equal to it for the present!</p>
<p>This young Ker informs me Scott is coming up to Woolwich again. The <hi rend="italic">pain</hi> of his disorder has very greatly abated; some hope the disorder itself may have abated. He is to get to the Wedgwoods in Staffordshire, and after resting a little there will come hither in some week or two.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A. J. Scott had been ill in Edinburgh and was returning home via the Wedgwood family home, Maer Hall, Staffs.</note></p>
<p>Today it is thundering. Autumnal mists, before their time, preside over evening and morning: this morning Helen proposed a fire; then the sun broke out in silver brilliancy, and now we have clouds and the thunder growing louder and louder.&#x2014; Punch is totally weak this time; not worth wrapping up and paying two pence for. Some small touches on &#x2018;Sir James&#x2019; still; Sir James had such a bout with these Mazzini Letters as no unlucky caitiff ever had: they have given the whole world that hated him an opportunity of flinging rotten eggs on him, and now he is in a pickle like few!&#x2014; The thunder is coming nearer and nearer.</p>
<p>Our grand question however is and remains, When the Goody will return? Let her not set any day till she have seen Manchester; Manchester, I guess, unless Mrs Darbyshire come almost miraculously to the rescue, will not detain her long. And then my dear little <foreign>Bairn</foreign> is back again; blessings on her!&#x2014; What is becoming of you today; have you also thunder? I have heard nothing, but hope in tomorrow. Bless thee, my little one. <closer><salute><foreign><hi rend="italic">Auf ewig</hi></foreign> [Always]</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>Dearest&#x2014;</salute> Altho I wrote you no letter yesterday it did not follow that I went to <hi rend="italic">the races</hi>. I had entered into <hi rend="italic">that</hi> project without looking at it on both sides&#x2014;and as the time drew near I grew always the more <pb id="pg-18-148" n="18:148"/>nervous about it&#x2014;a whole day of Walter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Macgregor.</note> and his &#x201C;Anne Jane,&#x201D; a crowded race-course, &#x26;c &#x26;c&#x2014;&#x201C;horrible was the idea to me&#x2014;so at the first sound of some impediment on Walters side I flung up the whole engagement with inconceivable alacrity&#x2014;even to the dinner&#x2014;part of it at Walters house afterwards&#x2014;as a penalty we are to have <hi rend="italic">them</hi> dining here today&#x2014; I am now going off to the Choreleys with whom I engaged myself to lunch&#x2014; I forgot to tell you my ill sucess with them. So soon as my cold allowed of my going out M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Paulet gave me the carriage to call for them at their <hi rend="italic">Primrose Hotel</hi> (certainly the aburdest place in the created world that unsettled people ever went to <hi rend="italic">play</hi> at being in the country at&#x2014;) They had just returned to Liverpool half an hour before&#x2014; The day before yesterday in spite of rain of which<supplied>[h]</supplied><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> we have enough and to spare I went to Sandon Terrace again&#x2014; They were at <hi rend="italic">dinner&#x2014;that</hi> being &#x201C;the only day they had dined at so early an hour for years&#x201D;&#x2014;but they had altered their usual dinner hour to accommodate a party of Friends&#x2014;that means <hi rend="italic">Quakers</hi>&#x2014; I wrote civilities on my card at the door and left it&#x2014;yesterday I went again and as near as possible missed them again&#x2014;they having gone to call for <hi rend="italic">me</hi>&#x2014;but we arrived at their door at the same moment&#x2014;so now a lunch is all that can be effected between us&#x2014;</p>
<p>I also called yesterday on my new musical friend M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Ames&#x2014;who sang to me and gave me four songs of her own composition&#x2014; She is a charming woman&#x2014;only that she has too great a gift of <hi rend="italic">fluency</hi>&#x2014; Your Miss Lamond<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Martha MacDonald Lamont.</note> (the Gladiator) lives with her but is at present on a visit to Irland&#x2014; I should have liked to see how she looked in the body&#x2014; M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Darbyshire said she had a very strong likeness to&#x2014;myself!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I leave tomorrow in time to get to Manchester to tea&#x2014; &#x2014;having withstood entreaties enough to move a heart of stone&#x2014;</p>
<p>And now to <hi rend="small-caps">do</hi> the Chorleys&#x2014; Bless thee my good Good. I mean to see a cotton-mill at Manchester to improve my benighted practical part&#x2014;</p>

<salute>Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Accept a still shorter Note than your own today; I counted on a longer one, but already the sun is getting far west, and I should have had my Showerbath over, and been out. I want my good Mother to understand that I am well, and how very glad I was to learn from you that she was well. By all means have a little more bathing, so long as the weather is fit. Were you going off that way on the morning you wrote? You spoke of &#x201C;departure&#x201D;, but did not say whitherward.</p>
<p>I am sorry you get no answer from the Duke;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of Buccleuch.</note> but I suppose he will not go out of his way, to serve anybody, in the letting of farms. Highest rent that there is a fair likelihood of seeing paid: that is the Auctioneer rule they follow. I sympathize much with Jamie, sent to hawk the world for a farm in such days as ours. But he will not be beaten either; he has sobriety, discretion, strength and insight in himself to avoid much that would entangle many others. He must not be beaten!&#x2014; For the rest, I do not imagine Sir James Grahame&#x2019;s business, unless your Duke is a pettier man than one likes to consider him, has anything to do with the silence. And yet who knows? Sir James has got into the ugliest pickle any man has been in for years, by means of that Letter business:&#x2014;also, it is a fact, tho&#x2019; one we keep strictly to ourselves, that Lady Graham, next day after the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> Letter, turned off poor Governess B&#xF6;lte, who being a great favourite the day before could not in the least understand it;&#x2014;Mrs Buller had given B&#xF6;lte&#x2019;s character as originating here, which <hi rend="italic">had</hi> been cheerfully accepted as good. Is not this magnanimity! B&#xF6;lte has gone back to the Bullers to go to Italy with them; which from the first she would have greatly preferred. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Es sey</hi></foreign> [So be it]</p>
<p>Jane is going over to Manchester today, to see Geraldine &#x26;c; to be home next week, perhaps about Wednesday.&#x2014; That bluster of a German<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> is not worth returning to me. I once thought of answering somewhat; but find no answer will do as well.&#x2014; Dodds is coming to London! Gordon&#x2019;s Wife<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Isabel.</note> is ill at Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, but seemingly recovering.</p>

<p><salute>Little Dearie,&#x2014;</salute> There is no event since yesterday,&#x2014;if it were not the extraordinary kicking of Mazeppa<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A high-tempered horse in a nearby livery stable;see <ref target="volume-15/lt-18420812-JWC-TC-01"><sic>15:10</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1842-08-12">12 Aug. 1842</date></corr></ref>.</note> during the night-watches; in spite of whom, however, I slept. I have seen no mortal since the &#x201C;oald gentleman&#x201D; (of five&#x2014;and&#x2014;twenty) yesterday;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alan Ker.</note> heard no news except those of Beggars on the Street, announcing that &#x201C;Koind pipple, we have long been out of employment, and do not know where&#x201D; &#x26;c &#x26;c. The arrival of your Letter is the principal event; and the partially succesful deciphering of one of Cromwell&#x2019;s. I ought to be in the Showerbath, and then swiftly out into the Sun, for the thunder has cleared the air, and all is bright today:&#x2014;but I will write a word for Manchester Sunday nevertheless. You will hardly need any more, I suppose? Do not hurry till you are tired; but I flatter myself Manchester will soon tire you.</p>
<p>Go and see the Mill<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A cotton mill.</note> by all means;&#x2014;highly proper! And see what you will bring away from it, you little goose! A sound of chaos dinning in your poor little ears. Take care, at least, not to hank any part of your apparel on their hooks or spindles, and get your own little person drawn in to be carded!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Our little Dottle<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Helen Mitchell.</note>, &#x2018;a desultory widow&#x2019; in these times, is very busy cleaning today. She has had three sovereigns from me since you went; and represents her household accounts as being in the most <hi rend="italic">liquid</hi> state, ready for your inspection. Of late days it rather seems to me, the &#x201C;Numbers&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Music from next door or visiting servant girls.</note> are getting a shade more numerous. I know not that they do or think or imagine anything amiss; but the sound of them, an element <hi rend="italic">not</hi> under my command, is more or less offensive to me. Were it not that Goody is returning to take the command, I would interfere with peremptory <hi rend="italic">veto</hi>; at least, would insist on understanding it. &#x201C;Who <hi rend="italic">is</hi> that?&#x201D; I said, the other night. &#x201C;Ou, it&#x2019;s Sairey.&#x201D; Sairey Gamp,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In <hi rend="italic">Martin Chuzzlewit</hi>.</note> thought I! &#x201C;And who is Sairey?&#x201D; Sairey was&#x2014;Some well&#x2014;known Entity, whom I had not and never shall have the slightest knowledge <pb id="pg-18-151" n="18:151"/>of.&#x2014; On the whole, however, this poor little Totem of an Helen has behaved, I really do think, in the most unexceptionable manner.</p>
<p>A heroic Letter comes today from Dodds; he is actually coming to London, poor fellow; and I even augur well of him. A cheerful enthusiastic strength is in poor Dodds; and a heart as <foreign>leal</foreign> [honest] and wholesome as haver-bread.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Bread made from oats. Dodds did not in the end move to London till late <date when="1846-00-00">1846</date>.</note> May the Destinies be kind to him here, poor creature!</p>
<p>Big <foreign>bursten</foreign> [bursting] London is getting emptier; thank Heaven. They will be all off, by and by; and then for a fling, under better auspices, at some bit of work! Anthony Sterling and his Wife are for the Cumberland Lakes, the Scotch Highlands, and I know not where. The news from Ventnor<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of John Sterling.</note> are represented as still entirely bad.&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; Well, make my compliments to Geraldine and Mrs Darbyshire; take care of all <hi rend="italic">delirium</hi>,&#x2014;and come safe home to me soon, thou little unfortunate! <closer><salute>Thy own Necessary Evil,</salute></closer></p>

<p>I cannot without entering on a very long story give you even &#x201C;a birds eye view&#x201D; of the <hi rend="italic">scene</hi> that took place here yesterday&#x2014;of the excessive annoyance occasioned to my Uncle and to every one else in the house&#x2014;most of all to myself&#x2014;by Geraldine&#x2019;s coming here two hours before the time of starting with a whole string of people to carry me off in a sort of <hi rend="italic">triumph</hi>, instead of allowing me to meet her quietly at the railway, and be accompanied there by my own family&#x2014; My Uncle&#x2019;s sorrow at parting with me, showed plainly enough that he as well as myself had great doubts of our ever meeting again&#x2014;and Babbie had taken to crying in the morning&#x2014;and gone on with it the whole day&#x2014;and the other good little souls were all grave and silent&#x2014;and into the midst of all this came Geraldine all flippancy and fuss&#x2014;bringing with her M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Paulet&#x2014;Julia Newton and even M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Paulet to <hi rend="italic">witness the partings</hi>&#x2014;having assured them against <hi rend="italic">their</hi> more delicate judgements that <hi rend="italic">she,</hi> &#x201C;who knew me better than they, knew that I would think them cold and heartless if they did not come&#x201D;! Nay she even began anew shewing off her <hi rend="italic">jealousy</hi>&#x2014;asking me with a sneer &#x201C;what on earth was the matter with me that I looked so poorly&#x201D;? and when Jeanie came in with her eyes all swelled&#x2014;she behaved to her with downright impertinence&#x2014; To <hi rend="italic">accept</hi> the intolerable last hour which she had prepared for me was more than my patience could resign itself to&#x2014; I took M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Paulet out of the room&#x2014;and begged her to <hi rend="italic">go away</hi> and take away Geraldine and the rest&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">she</hi> could <hi rend="italic">understand</hi> such a wish&#x2014;and only regretted that she had given up her own feelings in compliance with Geraldines representations&#x2014; But when she saw me so vexed she said to me&#x2014;&#x201C;you do not wish to go&#x2014;dont go then&#x2014;I take it upon myself to make it all right with Geraldine&#x201D;&#x2014;the suggestion came irresistably welcome at the moment&#x2014;I did so <hi rend="italic">hate</hi> Geraldine for her unfeeling conduct towards my uncle and Jeanie&#x2014;and so it was all settled that I should give up Manchester&#x2014;and stay here till the Tuesday a much more natural place for me to be in&#x2014;and my Uncle was <hi rend="italic">so</hi> pleased and the <hi rend="italic">children</hi> all dancing for joy&#x2014;and the servants laughing when they had to carry up my trunks again&#x2014;and my Uncle <hi rend="italic">then</hi> saw the Paulets and asked them to dinner for tomorrow&#x2014;a thing he never would be persuaded to do before&#x2014;and he asked Geraldine too but she persisted in going home without me and I hope she did&#x2014;that she may send the <pb id="pg-18-153" n="18:153"/>letter which I am sure is at Machester for me this morning!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-18/lt-18440720-TC-JWC-01">preceding letter</ref>. Jewsbury wrote, [<date when="1844-07-21">21 July</date>]: &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t like sending on your letter without a word from myself. &#x2026; I did not reach home last night till half-past eight. &#x2026; The house was looking so nice, and tea all set out, like a wedding&#x2014;breakfast with the principal character absent.&#x201D; She had had tea with Mrs. Darbishire and &#x201C;talked over Seaforth and you. &#x2026; I feel much more inclined to be jealous of the impression you have made on her than of that she has made on you, because I know how slow she is to care for anyone, especially a woman, and she loves you already; but I think you can stand a great deal of love. Yesterday, when I left you, I did not realise that I was really saying a final goodbye. The sudden surprise of not taking you with me prevented my feeling anything else, and it was not till I got home that it struck me, and I did not just then need anything to make me more melancholy. Write to me as soon as you can, and tell me that you love me, &#x2026; and I don&#x2019;t get feeling any remorse or evil fancies about you&#x2014;circumstanced as you are. I would not have you with me on any consideration. If anything were to happen to your uncle before you see him again you would never have forgiven yourself for grieving him by coming to me. &#x2026; You have a horribly tender conscience, and I fear you will, in some of your sleepless nights, go and torment yourself by fancying me pained or grieved in my mind. &#x2026; [W]hen I saw poor old Mr. Welsh&#x2019;s brightened&#x2014;up face I was quite contented you should remain with him instead of me.&#x201D;</note>&#x2014; I have been this morning to James Martineaus church but alas he did not preach himself and the substitute was not edifying&#x2014;however he is coming for me this evening to take me up to his house for an hour&#x2014;so I settled with his wife at church&#x2014;</p>
<p>And now I must &#x201C;down town&#x201D; again myself with this or it will be too late for the mornings post&#x2014; I shall be home on Tuesday God willing&#x2014;but I will write again to morrow to tell the hour&#x2014; My poor Uncle has been earnestly begging me to write to you that I will stay <hi rend="italic">another month</hi>&#x2014;impossible!</p>

<p><salute>Dearest&#x2014;</salute> I have no letter from you this morning&#x2014;in the course of nature none was to have been looked for from London&#x2014;but there might have come one from Manchester. Perhaps Geraldine did not go on to Manchester on Saturday after all but back to Seaforth&#x2014;to flirt with a M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Tel&#xf3;&#x2014;a brute of a man whom she is <hi rend="italic">doing the impossible</hi> to inspire with a <hi rend="italic">grand passion</hi>&#x2014;or perhaps she was in no haste to forward it and it may still come by the afternoon post&#x2014;or perhaps there <hi rend="italic">was</hi> no letter to forward&#x2014;but that is not likely&#x2014;considering my Good&#x2019;s extraordinary punctuality&#x2014;</p>
<p><pb id="pg-18-154" n="18:154"/>In any case it does not signify very much since I am to see him please God tomorrow night&#x2014; Helen has just been to enquire about the trains, and I am to go by the one which leaves at half after 10 in the morning and arrives in London at a quarter after nine (so they say&#x2014;but it is not likely they should be able to predict to a nicety) And now about coming to meet me with &#x201C;a neat fly&#x201D;&#x2014; I think <hi rend="italic">that</hi> would be a risk&#x2014;suppose that in the confusion of people we should miss each other&#x2014;or suppose that I should miss the train (not likely as I am notoriously always <hi rend="italic">too soon</hi> for every train) or that I should awake tomorrow with one of my even down headachs (not likely either as I can generally &#x201C;stave them off&#x201D; when I have <foreign><hi rend="italic">grandes choses a faire</hi></foreign>&#x2014;but one should take in all possibilities) suppose then any of these <foreign>contretemps</foreign> to take place and <hi rend="italic">you</hi> then waiting with a fly!&#x2014;we should both of us be doubly vaixed&#x2014; So that I vote for your staying quietly at home&#x2014;and having tea ready for me&#x2014;and trusting to my own tried powers of taking care of both myself and luggage&#x2014; I shall be so glad to get back again&#x2014;and I only wish the journey were over&#x2014;if &#x201C;association of ideas&#x201D; should make me <hi rend="italic">sea-sick</hi>&#x2014;tomorrow again! But we hope better things tho we thus speak&#x2014;</p>
<p>I am rather knocked up today&#x2014;my stewing in that church yesterday morning&#x2014;and my visit to the Martineaus at night were too much for one day&#x2014;not that the visit bored me like the sermon  On the contrary it was far too enlivening I found there the clergyman who had preached to me in the morning&#x2014;and three other men&#x2014;and there was a great deal of really clever speech transacted, which was the more exciting that one is not in the habit of it here. If you had heard me &#x201C;putting down virtue and all that sort of thing&#x201D; in opposition to the sermon I had been forced to listen to in the morning&#x2014;you would have wondered where I had found the <hi rend="italic">impudence</hi>&#x2014;as for the <hi rend="italic">arguments</hi> I got them of course all out of <hi rend="italic">you</hi>&#x2014; But the best of all was to hear James Martineau backing me out in all that&#x2014;almost as emphatically as yourself could have done&#x2014;in taking me down to supper he said with a heavy sigh &#x201C;that it was to be hoped the world would have soon heard the last of <hi rend="italic">all that</hi> <hi rend="small-caps">botheration</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Underlined thrice.</note> about <hi rend="italic">virtue</hi> and <hi rend="italic">happiness&#x201D;! He</hi> is anything but <hi rend="italic">happy</hi> I am sure&#x2014;a more concentrated expression of melancholy I never saw in a human face&#x2014; I fancy him to be the <hi rend="italic">victim</hi> of <hi rend="italic">Conscience</hi>&#x2014;which is next thing to being the victim of green tea!&#x2014; His heart and Intellect both protest against this bondage&#x2014;and so he is a man divided against himself&#x2014; I should like to convert him&#x2014;<foreign><hi rend="italic">moi!</hi></foreign>&#x2014; If he could be reduced into a wholesome state of spontaneous blackguardism for six months he would &#x201C;come out very strong&#x201D;&#x2014; But <pb id="pg-18-155" n="18:155"/>he feels that there is no credit in being (spiritually) <hi rend="italic">jolly</hi> in his present immaculate condition and so he is as sad as any sinner of us all. But what am I chattering for at this rate when I am to be home tomorrow</p>

<salute>My good Child</salute>
<p>It is not today that I can answer your most welcome letter as it deserves&#x2014; I must keep myself <hi rend="italic">very</hi> quiet today &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">morally</hi> and physically&#x201D;&#x2014; But I <hi rend="italic">will</hi> write a few lines just to certify you that I <hi rend="small-caps">do</hi> love you as well as before&#x2014;perhaps even better&#x2014;for I feel more <hi rend="italic">sorry</hi> for you than before&#x2014; Take that consolation, such as it is in the meanwhile, till I have got the <hi rend="italic">cramp</hi> fairly out of my stomach&#x2014;and my head recovered into its normal state. I stood the journey far too well&#x2014;and was too well the first day&#x2014;not to have some formidable reaction to apprehend&#x2014;and so I have been twentyfour hours in bed with headach and a sort of cramp that comes every five minutes or so, and makes me scream out&#x2014;</p>
<p>Carlyle looked very pleased to have me back at first but he is already relapsed into his usual indifference&#x2014; Darwin told me that he had seen him just once during my absence&#x2014;on Sunday last when he found him with M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Cunningham<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Coningham.</note> &#x201C;of whom he seemed dreadfully wearied&#x201D; that he looked indeed &#x201C;thoroughly wretched&#x201D; so wretched&#x2014; that he (Darwin) found himself wishing I would return immediately before &#x201C;the poor man died outright for want of having someone to grumble to&#x201D;! Darwin is going into Kent the end of this week and then to Shrewsbury&#x2014;he put off his going a week when he heard that I was coming&#x2014;and yet to have seen him walk in with his nonchalante air, one would have said he could have dispensed with a sight of me till the end of the world. Mazzini came the first morning&#x2014; I asked him &#x201C;how he knew?&#x201D; He shrugged his shoulders and said &#x201C;the wonder would rather have been if I had <hi rend="italic">not</hi> known&#x201D;&#x2014; I find him looking better than I expected&#x2014; He awaits the decision of the secret commuttee<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >To investigate the opening of his mail.</note> <pb id="pg-18-156" n="18:156"/>with supreme indifference&#x2014; On Lord Brougham&#x2019;s great idea of the <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;Gaming house&#x201D;</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-18/lt-18440708-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1844-07-08">7 [8] July</date></ref>.</note> he remarked that he wondered so imaginative a character as Brougham had not rather accused him of having &#x201C;kept a cook-shop of human flesh&#x201D;!

<salute>Dear Fitzgerald,</salute>
<p>I am very glad to hear of you again;&#x2014;you from the green odoriferous Summerfields,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >FitzGerald was staying at his cottage nr. Woodbridge, Suffolk.</note> I here amid the choking heat of Babylon and the baked bricks!</p>
<p>Alas, it seems to me I shall hardly get out into the Country this year at all. I have succeeded so dreadfully ill with my working affairs, I feel as if my conscience would forbid me to enjoy any rural thing. Besides, I found last year so sorry a result from nearly three whole months of roving and restless wandering,&#x2014;nothing but increase of sadness, of stupidity and every sort of darkness supervening thereupon: I really think I must try what sitting still will do for me this year. My one poor hope for the present, at least, is that the beautiful Quality will all go about their business in a week or two; and that then we shall have a quiet Town, where a poor wretch may be left alone to try if he <hi rend="italic">can</hi> get any work done: he will at least be more solitary than anywhere else, and may meditate on the error of his ways, if he can do no better. I could envy you your beautiful excursions, beautiful to a healthy heart; but I will honestly wish you happiness in them, new health from them and many merry days. I do not envy anybody anything,&#x2014;that really is true at present: I am as a <hi rend="italic">drowned mouse</hi>, to whom additional rains or the brightest sunny weather are very literally all one! Such is the &#x201C;Curse of Cromwell&#x201D; resting on me, for the time being.</p>
<p>I never give up, but I make almost no way. Such an element, of brutal dulness and every form of incoherent Ignorance and Falseness and Stupidity, no man ever worked in before! I go plunging about, in a very desperate manner, in that villanous<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> Quagmire of History; and on some sides find a little progress possible; on most sides none.&#x2014; I am fast gathering Oliver&#x2019;s Letters together; have a big sheath of them copied with my own hand, and tolerably elucidated: I find it very useful work; the Letters themselves stript of their ragged misspellings, &#x26;c become quite lucid and even lucent. The ground grows always a little firmer as I work in that quarter.</p>
<p>Last week I took a violent resolution that the whole of Cromwell&#x2019;s battles ought to be elucidated for the whole world: maps like the Winceby one, <hi rend="italic">exact</hi> portraiture of the face of the ground as it now is, <pb id="pg-18-158" n="18:158"/>with judicious selection of the contemporary testimonies as they now are; <hi rend="italic">faithful</hi> effort, in short, by a human being of the year <date when="1844-00-00">1844</date> to put down what he <hi rend="italic">can</hi> know of those things 200 years back, which will be memorable for 1000 years to come. Alas! I went to the Booksellers to give me an estimate of costs; the name of a fit artist, first of all: this they will do;&#x2014;but there I fear the matter will stick. Suppose <hi rend="italic">you</hi> try your hand at Naseby, and another or two!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >FitzGerald had sent a pen sketch of Naseby field to TC, <date when="1842-09-23">23 Sept. 1842</date>, and two wash drawings of the field, <date when="1842-09-27">27 Sept. 1842</date>; reprod. Terhune, <hi rend="italic">LEF</hi> 1:353 and between 402&#x2013;3. According to Terhune, eight of FitzGerald&#x2019;s sketches of Naseby are kept with his correspondence (1:344).</note> <hi rend="italic">Woodcuts</hi> not bigger than an octavo page,&#x2014;the Ordinance Survey and utmost geographical correctness lying at the bottom of them.

Carlyle prints &#x201C;short&#x201D;; Terhune prints &#x201C;Wood.&#x201D;</note></p>
<p>A poor Scotchman coming to me near starved, I gave him a guinea to copy for me certain particulars of an Ipswich Election: this if I find means, I have some thoughts of printing as a Magazine Article somewhere.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >It appeared as &#x201C;An Election to the Long Parliament,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine</hi> <date when="1844-10-30">30 (Oct. 1844)</date>:379&#x2013;93; rpt. in <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 29:322&#x2013;47. &#x201C;Scotchman&#x201D; is unidentified.</note> You will find enough of it in the enclosed Paper;&#x2014;if you can throw any light on it, you will. <foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear F.</p>

Other names not annotated may be found in TC&#x2019;s pbd. essay.</note> and soon after died. Undersherrif Mr Farran.</p>
<p>The Candidates were Mr Henry North, son of Sir Roger North, on the royalist side; and Sir Nathaniel Barnardiston and Sir Philip Parker, on the Puritan side. The two latter carried it hollow; greatly to the indignation of Sir Roger and C<hi rend="italic">o</hi>, who on the Tuesday and still more on the Wednesday did their best to raise a riot, &#x2018;riding about the Cornhill, <pb id="pg-18-159" n="18:159"/>with drawn rapiers,&#x2019; bullying the good Sir Symonds in his own Townhall, calling the sailors (who had mainly brought in the two Puritan Knights) &#x201C;Water-dogs&#x201D; &#x26;c;&#x2014;in short conducting themselves in so unwarrantable and almost distracted a way that had not High Sheriff d&#x2019;Ewes displayed, as his wont was, a nearly superhuman discretion and forbearance, the streets of Ipswich might have got dyed with blood on the occasion. It is to exculpate himself (if challenged in Parliament or elsewhere, which possible event does not seem to have happened) that Sir Symonds seems to have compiled this clear but very wordy Narrative, fortified with affidavits &#x26;c, which still lies among his Papers in the British Museum.</p>
<p><title>&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;</title></p>

Robert Clark&#x2019;s nose took to b<supplied>[l]</supplied>eeding, while he sat over the Poll-book, in that extreme windy day, and thereupon Sam Duncon, Constable, was appointed to write in his room (and a capital hand he has, as his affidavit still shews); upon which mad ground it chiefly was that the mad Sir Roger, foulmouthed Webbe, and Co, attempted to fasten a charge on the immaculate Sir Symonds,&#x2014;which he, however, bore in a very godlike manner.</p>

Letter omitted in &#x201C;bleeding&#x201D; in preceding paragraph.</note> There were strong trees here and there in it; the polling-tables were repeatedly overset by the press of people, and Sir Symonds had them then set up against trees, one of them against &#x2018;a large Elm&#x2019;: Duncon shifted away with the wrecks of another to what he calls the &#x2018;Conduit-head in said field,&#x2019; where I suppose he had a wall to lean upon?</p>

<p>sider to be the great secret of progress. He that waits always for good weather to work in, will find his job sadly in arrear at the year&#x2019;s end! I hope to get my poor bewildered Book done yet, by and by;&#x2014;and then I am for a <hi rend="italic">long</hi> spell of country, of idleness and silence,&#x2014;a complete <hi rend="italic">fill</hi> of country; which I have never yet had since I came to live here.</p>
<p>My health, in spite of the heat, keeps wonderfully good. Really I seem to be better than last year when I was &#x201C;clatching about the country,&#x201D; tumbling disconsolate from place to place, finding rest nowhere for the sole of my foot! I study to <hi rend="italic">humour</hi> the heat here; I do not go out at all till evening in those blazing sunshiny days; then I study some quietest line of Hedge-lanes (which I often find almost free of human Cockneys, among the Kensington Cabbage fields, a little to the North-west of me here), and there I walk under the blessed silver twilight, enough to suffice me. I pack blockheads more and more briefly out of my road: &#x201C;Why should you lap up my time from me, which is like lapping up my <hi rend="italic">blood</hi> and life, you blockhead!&#x201D;&#x2014; I am more solitary, and really quieter here, than I could be in many other places. In a week or two, especially, the Quality, most of whom are already on the wing, will be altogether gone: then we shall have beautiful empty streets in this Western end of London, and the place all to ourselves. I take a showerbath daily, which I find do me real good. None of you, I fear, ever meddle with that excellent showerbath at Scotsbrig! Yet I am nearly sure it would be beneficial to almost any of you, man or woman, that durst attempt it!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Our last <hi rend="italic">Ham</hi> ended honourably yesterday morning! They have been two faithful servants, those two Hams; better stuff was never cut;&#x2014;and I believe they are very wholesome too. The curing was good and the original stuff was good: let our kind Friends understand this <pb id="pg-18-161" n="18:161"/>for their comfort.&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; I think I shall perhaps have some clothes from Tom Garthwaite by and by; if Jamie be still in the season for <hi rend="italic">similar</hi> hams (which I doubt) we may perhaps commission him to try his hand at another pair. But in the interim, let him do nothing, unless he hear farther.</p>
<p>Where the Dr is at present, or what he is occupied in, I cannot very distinctly guess. In his last Note from Scotsbrig he spoke about &#x201C;breakfast and departure&#x201D;: the breakfast I have no doubt he ate; but in what direction did he &#x201C;depart&#x201D;? I have never heard more word of him.&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; Jean at Dumfries is my patient creditor for a Letter: tell her I have not forgotten the debt by any means; but she knows my hurry.</p>
<p>Dear Mother, here is a poor little Bank-Note, which I send you, to see if you will buy <hi rend="italic">yourself</hi> something with it. I do not know what will do you most good; but I beg as a real favour to me that you will ascertain for my sake, and do accordingly.&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; Alas, it is so little I can accomplish for you;&#x2014;as it were, absolutely nothing: and I owe you, and feel at all times that I owe you, so very much. My blessing on you, and life-long thanks, dear Mother!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Isabella I hope is somewhat improving in this summer weather. Jamie will not despond about Farms, but set himself manfully to doing what is to be <hi rend="italic">done</hi> in the business. Is Jenny with you, and is she quite recovered?<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Early in <date when="1844-07-00">July</date> she had a bad cold; see <ref target="volume-18/lt-18440703-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1844-07-03">3 July</date></ref>.</note>&#x2014; <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, my dear Mother; I have written far more than I intended, and yet but a small fraction of my story towards you!

<salute>Dearest Babbie</salute>
<p>What a horrid story! That poor girl has not been out of my head half an hour together since I read your letter; I see her always as she looked at the door that morning when I was coming away&#x2014;so quiet and welldoing! the only figure in your establishment that promised to be a comfort to you. And to think that such a terrible calamity was even then suspended over her,&#x2014;has already fallen on her poor little head!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Welshes&#x2019; servant Margaret, whose mother had been murdered.</note> People <hi rend="italic">do</hi> get over the heaviest afflictions even complications <pb id="pg-18-162" n="18:162"/>of misery like this&#x2014; God knows <hi rend="italic">how;</hi> but they do it&#x2014;the power of <hi rend="italic">suffering</hi> seems to approach nearer to the Infinite than any other power that human beings have&#x2014;and this is just <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the consolation one has in thinking about her. Had such a Tragedy been acted for <hi rend="italic">the first time</hi>&#x2014;one would be certain <foreign><hi rend="italic">a priori</hi></foreign> than<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> any <hi rend="italic">daughter</hi> of ordinary sensibility <hi rend="italic">must</hi> break her heart under it&#x2014;or lose her wits&#x2014;but one has seen instances enough to the contrary&#x2014; Be sure to tell me <hi rend="italic">particularly</hi> the result of the Coroners inquest&#x2014;and all that you know of the business. above all what effect it is likely to have on Margaret. I hope she will come back to you as soon as possible. <hi rend="italic">occupation</hi> and <hi rend="italic">kindness</hi> together will be the best medecines for her&#x2014;</p>
<p>I wish you had succeeded in realizing a Cook with <hi rend="italic">two</hi> legs. <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;A bad leg&#x201D;</hi> having once established itself is apt to be used in all cases of emergency for purposes of terror&#x2014; As David Roughhead at Haddington<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The man from whom JWC&#x2019;s father bought their house in Haddington; see <ref target="volume-05/lt-18300205-JWC-EA-01"><sic>5:70</sic><corr>JWC to EA, <date when="1830-02-05">5 Feb. 1830</date></corr></ref>.</note> used to snatch up his <hi rend="italic">wooden leg</hi> and flourish it over the head of his wife whenever she crossed his captious humour!

<p>There were several things in your last letter that pleased me much&#x2014;1st The practical move towards supplying the place of my <hi rend="italic">magic wand</hi> with which I proposed to touch the walls of your house and make it expand itself till there should be space in it for <hi rend="italic">the development of individual character!</hi>&#x2014;to say nothing of all the <hi rend="italic">material</hi> advantages&#x2014; If I were you I would concentrate all the <hi rend="italic">powers</hi> and <hi rend="italic">seductions</hi> I was mistress of, on that object! until the glimmer of hope you have should have &#x201C;brightened more and more unto the perfect day&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Untraced.</note>&#x2014;of a roomy&#x2014;well aired house! I am perfectly convinced that immense <hi rend="italic">physical</hi> as well as <hi rend="italic">moral</hi> improvement would result to you all from such a change&#x2014;and that you would never grudge having made it the object of the most painstaking systematic pursuit&#x2014;or even <hi rend="italic">persecution</hi></p>
<p>The sorting of your drawers was another fact that I could perfectly sympathize with&#x2014; How many <hi rend="italic">programmes</hi> of moral and intellectual improvement have commenced for myself with the <hi rend="italic">sorting of my drawers</hi> and&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">ended</hi> there?&#x2014; Not that I mean to dishearten <hi rend="italic">you</hi> and insinuate that <hi rend="italic">your programme</hi> will end there&#x2014;out of the seven <pb id="pg-18-163" n="18:163"/>attempts which the spider made to fasten its web to the wall the seventh prevailed<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Referring to the story of Robert Bruce and the persevering spider.</note>&#x2014;and should a human being be less persevering and successful than a spider? God forbid! Try above all things to get your throat cured &#x26; to keep your blood circulating&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">make yourself</hi> walk&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">walking</hi> may be as heroic as <hi rend="italic">fighting</hi> under certain conditions and is not to be neglected as a performance not worth the self sacrifice it costs.&#x2014; Whatever one does for a moral end and against ones natural ease is <hi rend="italic">virtue</hi>&#x2014;if there <hi rend="italic">be</hi> any virtue&#x2014;and if you cannot keep your mind well while your body is sick&#x2014;(and who can?) and if excercise be requisite for your bodily health, it is <hi rend="italic">virtue</hi> to walk and if you look at it under that point of view you will set about it in quite a different spirit&#x2014; But enough of preaching&#x2014; Heaven knows I am not in such an exalted way myself just now, that I should feel myself entitled to preach&#x2014; To make the day and the way meet is as much as I am up to&#x2014; A <hi rend="italic">series</hi> of blue pills however is slowly getting the better of this bilious fit and in the meanwhile like Cavaignac I <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;await&#x201D;</hi>&#x2014; I cannot flatter myself that it was the <hi rend="small-caps">ice</hi> which has worked me all this woe&#x2014; Maggie is in a state of primeval prejudice if she takes <hi rend="italic">ice</hi> to be <hi rend="italic">unwholesome</hi>&#x2014;for <hi rend="italic">me</hi> it is eminently the reverse&#x2014;as repeated experimen<supplied>[t]</supplied>s<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> have ascertained&#x2014;ice or no ice I have been in a most dejected state all these days and have been holding on like grim death by the <hi rend="italic">safety-rope</hi> of <hi rend="italic">method</hi>&#x2014;amidst the general shipwreck of my powers of body and mind&#x2014;doing certain <hi rend="italic">small things</hi>&#x2014;such as one <hi rend="italic">can</hi> still do&#x2014;with a certain regularity and a certain determination of purpose is I always find the best resource in these conditions&#x2014; If one attempt any thing <hi rend="italic">great</hi>&#x2014;or exerts oneself only by fits and starts&#x2014;nothing comes of it but failure and deeper discouragement.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Your Letter, in my dearth of news, was very welcome to me: you should keep me going at least for Scotsbrig news, while you are there! Our good Mother must go back to the Bathing; I hope the next Spring Tides will prove handier. Our weather here too is much broken with rains, tho&#x2019; otherwise warm and genial.</p>

<p>Our City is got almost empty, and very quiet in comparison: I hope I shall now get on with somewhat less interruption in my labours. It is a sluggish element; sluggish as thick mud; and bottomless, except where one <hi rend="italic">makes</hi> a bottom: nothing but strenuous hard work, harder than I have yet continuously given it, will ever bring me thro&#x2019;. For all is Chaos, within it, and without it! <foreign><hi rend="italic">Eheu</hi></foreign> [Alas]!</p>
<p>A starving Scotch youth came to me the other week; equal, as he <pb id="pg-18-166" n="18:166"/>said, to all kinds of Old Manuscripts &#x26;c &#x26;c: I gave him a sovereign to copy me that Election Tumult of d&#x2019;Ewes at Ipswich;&#x2014;I have got that here, and think of trying to make a Magazine Article of it somewhere.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-18/lt-18440729-TC-EF-01">TC to EF, <date when="1844-07-29">29 July</date></ref>.</note> The poor lad attempted farther to make an estimate of copying all d&#x2019;Ewes Parl<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Manuscript for me: &#xa3;30, he said, would do it, and I had for some days real thoughts of the thing; but alas my man, in the interim, was discovered by me to be a quite loose-talking dishonest-minded little thing unsafe to employ on any business; so having found him a job with Maurice,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >F. D. Maurice.</note> &#x2018;writing to dictation&#x2019; (in which dishonesty cannot long remain undetected), I shook him off. But it does partly appear to me, I must have that <hi rend="italic">Mss</hi>. to read and con over at my leisure,&#x2014;if possible.

On the whole, I am looking out for a handy Amanuensis, to copy me a great many things: I find such a one may be got, if you alight luckily, for some 60 or 80 pounds, to work all the year round! It is but the price of keeping a horse here!&#x2014; On the other hand, no Bookseller can be made in the least to bite at such a thing;&#x2014;the inane mountebank quacks: one must do it oneself or it will remain undone.&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; I made them get into the Library a <hi rend="italic">Sprigge</hi>, and now also a <hi rend="italic">Vicars</hi> Part First;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Joshua Sprigge (<date when="1618-00-00">1618</date>&#x2013;<date when="1684-00-00">84</date>), <hi rend="italic">Anglia Rediviva</hi> (<date when="1647-00-00">1647</date>).

<salute>Dear Emerson,</salute>
<p>There had been a long time without direct news from you, till four days ago your Letter arrived. This day I understand to be the ultimate limit of the American Mail,&#x2014;yesterday, had it not been Sunday, would have been the limit: I write a line, therefore, tho&#x2019; in very great haste.</p>
<p>Poor Sterling, even I now begin to fear, is in a very bad way. He had two successive attacks of spitting of blood, some three months ago, or more; the second attack of such violence, and his previous condition then so weak, that the Doctor as good as gave up hope,&#x2014;the poor Patient himself had from the first given it up. Our poor Friend has had so many attacks of that nature, and so rapidly always rallied from them, I gave no ear to these sinister prognostics; but now that I see the summer influences passing over him without visible improvement, and our good weather looking towards a close without so much strength added as will authorize even a new voyage to Madiera,&#x2014;I too am at last joining in the general discouragement; all the sadder to me that I shut it out so long. Sir James Clark, our best-accredited Physician for such diseases, declares that Life for certain months may linger, with great pain; but that recovery is not to be expected. Great part of the lungs, it appears, is totally unserviceable for respiration; from the remainder, especially in times of coughing, it is with the greatest difficulty that breath enough is obtained. Our poor Patient passes the night in a sitting posture; cannot lie down: that fact sticks with me ever since I heard it! He is very weak, very pale; still &#x201C;writes a great deal daily&#x201D;; but does not wish to see any body; declines to &#x201C;see even Carlyle,&#x201D; who offered to go to him. His only Brother, Anthony Sterling, a hardy soldier, lately withdrawn from the Army, and settled in this quarter, whom we often communicate with, is about going down to the Isle of Wight this week: he saw John four days ago, and brings nothing but bad news,&#x2014;of which indeed this removal of his to the neighbourhood of the scene is a practical testimony. The old Father, a <pb id="pg-18-168" n="18:168"/>Widower for the last two years, and very lonely and dispirited, seems getting feebler and feebler: he was here yesterday; a pathetic kind of spectacle to us. Alas, alas! But what can be said? I say Nothing; I have written only one Note to Sterling:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On <date when="1844-06-09">9 June</date>. &#x201C;Madiera&#x201D; thus in MS.</note> I feel it probable that I shall never see him more,&#x2014;nor his like again in this world. His disease, as I have from of old construed it, is a burning of him up by his own fire. The restless vehemence of the man, struggling in all ways these many years to find a legitimate outlet, and finding except for transitory unsatisfactory corruscations none, has undermined its Clay Prison in the weakest point (which proves to be the lungs), and will make outlet <hi rend="italic">there</hi>. My poor Sterling! It is an old tragedy; and very stern whenever it repeats itself of new.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>Today I get answer about Alfred Tennyson:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Tennyson wrote to TC, <date when="1844-08-07">7 Aug</date>: &#x201C;Was I not passing thro&#x2019; town into Kent &#x26; did I not stop because I desired to see you? Wherefore do you hit at me obliquely with allusions to infernal pavement? with whom would I more willingly smoke my pipe &#x26; fraternize on this side the grave? The very afternoon when I was coming down to Chelsea ill fortune grabbed me in the shape of a fever which said the Doctor would have been scarlet if he would have let it, three days have I lived on 18 lemons, I am today much better but miserably imbecile about the knees. I <hi rend="italic">must</hi> go into Kent tomorrow if I am strong.&#x201D;</note> all is right on that side. Moxon informs me that the Russell Books and Letter arrived duly, and were duly forwarded and safely received; nay farther that Tennyson is now in Town, and means to come and see me. Of this latter result I shall be very glad: Alfred is one of the few British or Foreign Figures (a not increasing number, I think!) who are and remain beautiful to me;&#x2014;a true human soul, or some authentic approximation thereto, to whom your own soul can say, Brother!&#x2014; However, I doubt h<supplied>[e]</supplied> will not come; he often skips me, in these brief visits to Town; skips <supplied>[every]</supplied> body indeed; being a man solitary and sad, as certain men are, dwelling in an element of gloom,&#x2014;carrying a bit of Chaos about him, in short, which he is manufacturing into Cosmos!</p>
<p>Alfred is the Son of a Lincolnshire Gentleman Farmer, I think;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Tennyson&#x2019;s father, the Rev. George Clayton Tennyson (<date when="1778-00-00">1778</date>&#x2013;<date when="1831-00-00">1831</date>), had been rector at Somersby, Lincs. TC is probably thinking of his grandfather, George Tennyson (<date when="1750-00-00">1750</date>&#x2013;<date when="1835-00-00">1835</date>), who set himself up as a country gentleman at Tealby Lodge, Lincs.</note> indeed you see in his verses that he is a native of &#x201C;moated granges,&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >As in Tennyson&#x2019;s &#x201C;Mariana.&#x201D;</note> and green fat pastures, not of mountains and their torrents and storms. He had his breeding at Cambridge, as if for the Law or Church; being master of a small annuity on his Father&#x2019;s decease, he preferred clubbing with his Mother and some Sisters,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Elizabeth, b. Fytche (<date when="1781-00-00">1781</date>&#x2013;<date when="1865-00-00">1865</date>), and his two spinster sisters&#x2014;Mary (<date when="1810-00-00">1810</date>&#x2013;<date when="1884-00-00">84</date>) and Matilda (<date when="1816-00-00">1816</date>&#x2013;<date when="1913-00-00">1913</date>).

In this way he lives still, now here now there; the family always within reach of London, never in it; he himself making rare and brief visits, lodging in some old comrade&#x2019;s rooms. I think he must be under forty, not much under it.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >He was to turn thirty-five, <date when="1844-08-06">6 Aug</date>.</note> One of the finest looking men in the world. A great shock of rough dusty-dark hair; bright-laughing hazel eyes; massive aquiline face, most massive yet most delicate, of sallow-brown complexion, almost Indian-looking; clothes cynically loose, free-and-easy;&#x2014;smokes infinite tobacco. His voice is musical metallic,&#x2014;fit for loud laughter and piercing wail, and all that may lie between; speech and speculation free and plenteous: I do not meet, in these late decades, such company over a pipe!&#x2014; We shall see what he will grow to. He is often unwell; very chaotic,&#x2014;his way is thro&#x2019; Chaos and the Bottomless and Pathless; not handy for making out many miles upon.

<p>Harriet Martineau has clearly shown in her <hi rend="italic">Life in a Sick Room</hi> that to accept more sympathy than one&#x2019;s accurate due is a turpitude little short of stealing a purse. I hasten to tell you then, that I am now in <hi rend="italic">my usual</hi>, can <hi rend="italic">eat</hi> and <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi> again in a reasonable sort of way, and if there be any truth in looking-glasses have changed my colour from seagreen to a modest yellow. <hi rend="italic">At last</hi> I shall receive those compliments on my <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;improved looks&#x201D;</hi> which even the force of habit as respecting persons who have had <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;change of air&#x201D;</hi> had not yet obtained for me from an observant public.

<p>With my improved health the standard of my occupations has proportionately elevated itself.

<p><salute>My dear Sir&#x2014;</salute>&#x2026; I rejoice heartily in the project you have in view, and hope to-day&#x2019;s meeting will be prosperous and productive. On the subject of Parks and Public Places of innocent Recreation in large Towns I have indeed nothing more to say at present than what I have already said: but I think often enough of it; and trust those whose hands are within reach of such a business will everywhere, the noble part of them, begin doing in it, without more saying than is needful. Among the thousand things which the Working People of large towns do, in the Supreme Court of All, mutely but imperatively demand of their richer Fellow-Citizens, this of open green spaces to breathe in for a half hour now and then, seems to me the most accomplishable, and by no means the least needful. It could be done, this thing; there are nine hundred and ninety-nine other things that cannot just at present be done. Begin with this thing! This well done, the next thing will have become doabler. I do sincerely hope you will get on with it,&#x2014;for the sake of the poor little sickly children, and the dusty toilsome men, to whom, for a thousand years, generation after generation, it may be a blessing!&#x2014;</p>

Good Heavens, what benefit might be accomplished would brave men with hearts and heads but bestir themselves a very little! &#x2026;</p>

<salute>Dear Scott,</salute>
<p>We are much gratified that you have come back to us; it is good in itself, and we hope it is a token of farther good.</p>
<p>If you be in Town again, give me warning, and I will wait for you. If you do not return soon, I will come to Woolwich, and look after you. Perhaps about the end of next week, I may turn up there, if I hear nothing from you.</p>
<p>My Wife has been in Lancashire, and has returned; we are in our usual state of infirm health, and have no thought at present but of remaining quiet here.&#x2014; Poor Sterling, as we learn from the best sources, is in a very dangerous if not an altogether hopeless way. I have long refused to consider him as dying; but even I now begin to fear the worst. He cannot lie down in bed; the Doctors say there is a cavity formed in his lungs, and hardly enough left to furnish him with painful breath of life. Alas, alas!&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p><closer><salute>I hope to see you in not many days.</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Lady Harriet,</salute>
<p>There has hitherto no Green Ticket<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Railway ticket to Addiscombe.</note> come; perhaps there may still; but I at any rate had better decide to go, with such Tickets as I have. <pb id="pg-18-173" n="18:173"/>My likeliest is the old hour on Sunday; and home again that night, if I be not stronger than now. One way or other, on Sunday or some following day, I must see you again before Addiscombe end.</p>
<p>On Wednesday evening I was within few feet of your chair (I suppose); and have regretted ever since that the Intrusion Principle misgave there. But indeed my dress, consisting chiefly of grey blanket-cloth, was ill adapted for select Evening Parties; and the Female mind too, tho&#x2019; much better equipt, by no means felt itself in proper case for being presented to Royalty!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Perhaps TC thought that Lady Harriet had been at the duke of Wellington&#x2019;s grand entertainment at Apsley House, Wed., <date when="1844-07-31">31 July</date>, following his banquet for members of the royal household and others. She was not listed in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, <date when="1844-08-01">1 Aug.</date>, as attending.</note> And so we vanished in the dark again. Alas, even in Comedy there is something of the tragic.</p>
<p>I will not forget your Clergyman, your Project of a Clergyman;&#x2014;no! Perhaps I shall be a Bishop myself yet, some day? Bishop and Grand-Almoner?</p>

<salute>Dearest Babbie</salute>
<p>I have been reading no German <hi rend="italic">Homer</hi> last week&#x2014;mending no linen&#x2014;and my <hi rend="italic">method</hi> has been scattered to the winds! Still I have been much and actively employed with a matter which has indeed taken up much of my thoughts ever since I returned to London A person<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Plattnauer.</note> whom I am deeply interested in&#x2014;(I will not <hi rend="italic">name</hi> him as connected with such circumstances&#x2014;you may <hi rend="italic">divine</hi> him perhaps&#x2014;and if you do, I desire that you will keep his name secret&#x2014;as it would be of the worst consequence to him in every sense that the facts I am about to tell you should be spread about concerning him)&#x2014; Well this person had disappeared out of my sphere in the most perplexing manner. A letter from him lying on the mantle-piece for me at my return showed him to be got into some very questionable state of mind&#x2014;laid hold of <hi rend="italic">all on a sudden</hi> by some of these &#x201C;new ideas&#x201D; that are infecting this lower world in these days. He talked of being &#x201C;completely regenerated so far as he could see&#x201D; of being now become from the most wretched the happiest of human beings&#x2014;&#x26;c &#x26;c&#x2014;and &#x201C;what mostly occupied him in these days was how he could <hi rend="italic">be of use to me</hi> and <hi rend="italic">M</hi>r <hi rend="italic">Carlyle!</hi>&#x201D;&#x2014; <pb id="pg-18-174" n="18:174"/>&#x201C;but alas,&#x201D; said he ldquo;with regard to the latter I fear his hour is not yet come&#x2014;if it ever will come&#x201D;!&#x2014; He concluded with stating his intention to return to London the following day and to see me immediately on <hi rend="italic">my</hi> return&#x2014;to which end he begged me to write to him at his usual London address&#x2014;saying when he might come&#x2014;</p>
<p>I wrote to him accordingly to come the first morning he could before one o&#x2019;clock&#x2014;adding that I had read his letter three times over and did not know what to think of it the last time any more than the first&#x2014;but that I looked to <hi rend="italic">him</hi> for helping me to the solution&#x2014; That I congratulated him on having arrived at Happiness by whatsoever inconceivable means, but wished he would name that word as little as possible&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">&#x201C;for I always heard it with a superstitious shudder&#x2014; Happiness if there was such a thing at all seeming to me of the nature of those delicate Spirits which vanish when one pronounces their name&#x201D;</hi>&#x2014; The sequel has shown that I wrote those words in the true spirit of Prophecy! It <hi rend="italic">did</hi> cross my mind that he might be falling into insanity&#x2014;but I struggled against the idea as too horrible&#x2014; Still it was a strange letter from a man not given to foolish enthusiasms and who has the utmost destestation<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> for all sorts of cant and humbug Day after day passed on and he did not come&#x2014;neither write any more&#x2014; At the weeks end I wrote again expressing my fears that he was ill&#x2014;and begging that if such were the case he would either write or make somebody write for him&#x2014; No answer&#x2014; Thouroughly alarmed I wrote again reproaching him for his indifference to my anxieties and entreating him <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;as a favour&#x201D;</hi> to make me understand what all this meant. Silence as of death!&#x2014; This was more than I could sit still under&#x2014; But for the english ideas of propriety as recently illustrated in the case of M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Fraser I should have got at once into a Street cab and driven to his house to enquire after him&#x2014; This I was regretting in the presence of Theresa (Revis) could not be done&#x2014;and the Child exclaimed you shall take Godpapa&#x2019;s carriage&#x2014;and Godpapa himself and the Servants and <hi rend="italic">then there will be no impropriety&#x201D;!</hi>&#x2014; And off she ran, and came back in two minutes, and told me all this precautionary equipage would be at my orders in half an hour&#x2014;clever Child! off then I went&#x2014; Old M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Buller driving me <hi rend="italic">thro the rain</hi> and having with some difficulty found his lodging, some five miles off, I made Escott<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Apparently a servant of the Bullers.</note> inquire if he were <hi rend="italic">returned</hi> and <hi rend="italic">well</hi>&#x2014; No&#x2014;he had not returned&#x2014;he had written that he was coming and then again that he &#x201C;would not come any more&#x201D;!&#x2014; &#x201C;And his letters&#x201D;?&#x2014; &#x201C;Had all been punctually forwarded to him.&#x201D;&#x2014; &#x201C;Then they could give me his actual address&#x201D;? The Servant went to <pb id="pg-18-175" n="18:175"/>enquire and returned presently with a slip of paper on which 
was written</p>
<p>Accordium<lb/>
Ham Common<lb/>
Surrey</p>
<p>This in itself was a revealation&#x2014; The name&#x2014;and situation taken together suggested to me at once of those dreadful <hi rend="italic">vegetable, fraternal, universal-religion</hi> establishments which Alcott<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A. Bronson Alcott. Ham Common is ca. 14 mi. W of London.</note> and the like of him have originated on this long suffering earth! Well, I thought, it might have been worse&#x2014;no wonder that he dared not confess to <hi rend="italic">me</hi> he had become a member of such an establishment!&#x2014; To be sure for the time being it is sad&#x2014;pitiable&#x2014;but he is too manly a person to be <hi rend="italic">long</hi> humbuged by such creatures and too <hi rend="italic">honest</hi> to live in a humbug a moment after he has recognised it as such. So I set myself down in forced composure <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;to await&#x201D;</hi></p>
<p>And I might have <hi rend="italic">awaited</hi> long enough had not a letter come from a mutual friend asking &#x201C;can you tell me what on earth has happened to &#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; I hear something dreadful has happened to him&#x2014;it is too horrible&#x2014;they say he has become <hi rend="italic">insane!</hi></p>
<p>There then was the horrid word put into so many letters for me by another!&#x2014;all my own vague fears turned almost into certainties by being given back to me by another!&#x2014; My tongue and my feet were at once loosened by this word as from a sort of enchantment. I went immediately to Carlyle and told him something <hi rend="italic">must</hi> be done&#x2014; Well said he I will go to Ham Common myself and see after him <hi rend="italic">next week</hi> if you can get nobody else to do it or <hi rend="italic">do not like to go yourself</hi> (!)&#x2014;or perhaps I will go tomorrow&#x2014;I could not wait till <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;next week&#x201D;</hi> nor yet on the strength of a <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;perhaps&#x201D;</hi> I put on my bonnet and set off to&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;Craik! That man desired no better ever than to be <hi rend="italic">suffered</hi> to do me service&#x2014;and in such an emergency I felt no delicacy in using him&#x2014; As I expected; Craik being informed of such particulars as I could give him flung by his work and set out on the instant for Ham Common, from thence to one place after another, and came back to me here between ten and eleven at night with a clear and full account of the whole sad affair&#x2014; <hi rend="italic">He</hi> had at the time mentioned, entered the <hi rend="italic">Accordium</hi>&#x2014;which he had been visiting occasionally for some weeks before&#x2014; For two or three days he worked <hi rend="italic">in the garden</hi> and appeared well enough&#x2014;but soon he began to reproach them that they <hi rend="italic">did not carry out their own principles</hi> (noble detestation of humbug surviving even in the wreck of reason!)&#x2014; The <hi rend="italic">Pater</hi> as he calls himself was <pb id="pg-18-176" n="18:176"/>angry and resisted his disciples innovations&#x2014;whereupon &#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; burst into frightful violence and proceeded to strike at them all and break everything within his reach&#x2014; The Pater as the easiest way of ridding himself of the poor young man&#x2014;got a Magistrates warrant and had him conveyed to the nearest gaol where he passed the night in a dark cell and was found in the morning raging mad&#x2014; This the wretch himself did not confess but Craik thinking he was holding back something hunted about in the neighbourhood till he found one that could tell him&#x2014; A young man of fortune, who had recently made &#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2019;s acquaintance in their mutual walks and taken a great fancy to him heard tell of the thing&#x2014;got him out of the prison and conveyed to a private house in Richmond&#x2014;but what to do next?&#x2014; There was nobody who knew any thing about him there&#x2014;and how to discover his friends if he had any?&#x2014; He had torn the letters he received into such small pieces that they could not put two words of them together&#x2014;the last which came when he was no longer in a state to read it the young man ventured to open&#x2014;and found it <hi rend="small-caps">without</hi> <hi rend="italic">date</hi> (of course, being <hi rend="italic">mine</hi>) and signed only with <hi rend="italic">initials</hi>. There was no light to be got from <hi rend="italic">it</hi>&#x2014;except that I had mentioned <hi rend="italic">one</hi> name&#x2014;which name they had traced to its owner and thence the letter <hi rend="italic">I</hi> had received&#x2014; Meanwhile his madness continuing too violent for any individual person to manage he was conveyed to Wandsworth Lunatic Asylum<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ca. 6 mi. S of Chelsea, in Surrey.</note>&#x2014;as a person belonging to nobody!&#x2014;</p>
<p>What I felt in hearing all these particulars you may <hi rend="italic">partly</hi> conceive&#x2014; I wished it were morning&#x2014;to <hi rend="italic">do</hi> something&#x2014;tho what I knew not&#x2014;all night I thought and thought&#x2014; To go to the Asylum and <hi rend="italic">see</hi> the locality and his doctor&#x2014;to get him proper medical assistance&#x2014;if the advice he had seemed inefficient&#x2014;to discover the address of his relations and write to them in case of the worst&#x2014;to discover also the address of his only intimate friend that I knew of in London<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> and communicate with him&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">to see himself</hi> if the D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> would suffer it&#x2014; All these things at least were clearly enough to be done&#x2014;and I got up with an agitated mind to do them&#x2014; Craik again kindly undertook to go in quest of the gentleman I wished to see&#x2014;and discovered him&#x2014;or rather the place where he had been&#x2014;for he was gone to France for some weeks&#x2014;I myself having written some letters of questions&#x2014;in the midst of which came <hi rend="italic">a Lady</hi> to pester me about James Baillie for more than an hour&#x2014; Went off to Wandsworth <hi rend="italic">via</hi> Marlbro&#x2019; Street which is precisely in the opposite direction to pick up Darwins <hi rend="italic">carriage</hi> and himself&#x2014;that I might go with such an appearance of <hi rend="italic">respectability</hi> as <pb id="pg-18-177" n="18:177"/>would impress the people favourably as to &#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; and ensure me lucid answers at all events <hi rend="italic">civil</hi> ones&#x2014; I fortunately found the consulting physician there at the time<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably Sir Alexander Morison (<sic><date when="1799-00-00">1799</date></sic><corr><date when="1779-00-00">1779</date></corr>&#x2013;<date when="1866-00-00">1866</date>; <ref target="volume-18/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/19264"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), from Edinburgh; a leading authority on mental diseases, and inspecting physician of lunatic asylums in Surrey since <date when="1810-00-00">1810</date>.

<p>On Friday we are engaged here, with Americans. Saturday will do, if the day prove good; failing Saturday, the first bright weekday there is. My Wife undertakes to accompany me,&#x2014;barring headaches, which is a weighty deduction. We shall be there early, when we do get there.</p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>This will bring you a glad hour; for it has good news in it from over the sea! Alick&#x2019;s Letter came this morning, and I will not lose a moment sending it off. Poor fellow, he is busy with his harvest while he writes; all in a heap of work, as usual with him from of old; and writes to me in his &#x201C;midday resting hour.&#x201D; I like the view he gives us of him very well indeed. He has grown leaner, he says, but far abler for work; I daresay he is much healthier than when at Ecclefechan; he is evidently in a far wholesomer way. Let us be thankful for all mercies!</p>
<p>I had a Letter from the Doctor on Saturday Evening last: I inferred that he was conducting you home from Gill, and passing the Post-office with you the evening before. You could get little bathing, it seems; but he describes you as not worse in health, in spite of the wet weather. Take care of yourself, my dear good Mother. When the sun breaks out again, you must yoke the <foreign><hi rend="italic">Clatch</hi></foreign> [old Gig], and be off to Gill for another trial.</p>
<p>With us too the weather is extremely broken; today it is peppering and raining while I write; the temperature too is still warm; so that I suppose it to be very bad weather for harvest-people; who have not yet by any means got finished entirely even in these parts. They call it a fine Summer this, but had to complain to the very last of drought in many quarters, whereby their turnip and some other crops have failed. I am in hopes this hearty day of wet may rain it out, and let us take it for a Lammas Flood.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Heavy <date when="1844-08-00">Aug.</date> rain.</note> The Town is got entirely solitary&#x2014;people that follow fashion are ashamed to be seen here in this month, poor people! We have still rather more company than we want; and the streets, in the intervals of rain, are pleasanter than usual. I hope <hi rend="italic">now</hi> to get a bit of work set about! Alas, I am very lazy; apt to be a real <hi rend="italic">cool-the-loom</hi> [lazy worker] whenever I have a chance. Or rather, tho&#x2019; I do not altogether <hi rend="italic">quit</hi> the <hi rend="italic">loom;</hi> I ply it so languidly; like the merest <foreign><hi rend="italic">ploot</hi></foreign>,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A form of <foreign>plowster</foreign> or <foreign>pluister</foreign>, i.e., a messy, inefficient worker.</note> no more vigour in me than in a &#x201C;Jay-<foreign>Piet</foreign> [Jay-bird],&#x201D; as Jamie would say!&#x2014;I must try to do better in time coming.</p>
<p>My health is pretty good; better, I think, than it was last year this time; I really am as well here as I could be in most other places, torn out of my old habits, and tumbled about as is the lot of travellers. Jane too continues pretty well, tho&#x2019; grumbling at the wet weather.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-18-179" n="18:179"/>Mrs Buller is here; waiting to go off for Nice on the borders of Italy, early next month. Jane goes often to see her. Three days ago I got a most mournful, brave and noble little Letter from John Sterling; written to me as a last Farewell!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dated <date when="1844-08-10">10 Aug.</date> from Ventnor: &#x201C;My dear Carlyle&#x2014;For the first time for many months it seems possible to send you a few words merely however for Remembrance &#x26; Farewell. On higher matters there is nothing to say. I tread the common road into the great darkness without any thought of Fear &#x26; with very much of Hope. Certainty indeed I have none. With regard to You &#x26; Me I cannot begin to write having nothing for it but to keep shut the lid of those secrets with all the iron weights that are in my power. Towards Me it is still more true than towards England&#x2014;that no one has Been &#x26; Done like you. Heaven help you! If I can lend a hand when I am <hi rend="italic">there</hi> that will not be wanting.&#x2014;It is all very strange but not one hundredth part so sad as it seems to the standers by. / Your wife knows my mind towards her &#x26; will believe it without asseverations / Yours to the last / John Sterling.&#x201D; On the MS TC wrote: &#x201C;The Last but one. died at 11 o&#x2019;clock in the night of <date when="1844-09-18">Wednesday 18 Sept<hi rend="italic">r</hi> 1844</date>&#x2014; This Letter came on a Sunday morning, as I was bound to Addiscombe;&#x2014;never to be forgotten&#x201D; (pbd: <hi rend="italic">Life of Sterling, Works</hi> 11:260&#x2013;61). On the envelope TC wrote &#x201C;(The Last Two [including one of <date when="1844-08-26">26 Aug.</date>]).&#x201D;</note> He has for some months considered himself as rapidly dying; and I now fear it is too true an anticipation. He is one of the cleverest and best men I have ever known.&#x2014; Scott, whom John knows of, is come back to Woolwich; I am to go and see him the first good day. We rather understand that he is better, tho&#x2019; still in a dangerous and precarious way.</p>
<p>The Doctor, I presume, will write a Sheet of news to Alick, direct from Scotsbrig. There will still be time if he is on the ground when this arrives. I will try to send a word to him also; but am little to be depended on for time; and far off the chief fountain of news. I am still in debt to Jean too at Dumfries; but you will send Alick&#x2019;s news on to her. The Doctor had better write to me again if I do not quickly answer him.&#x2014; The rain still batters. I will carry this out after dinner whatever rain it be. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign> dear Mother; blessings on you and on them all.</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>On the accompanying sheet I have written a kind of List of Oliver&#x2019;s Battlefields, with indications that might enable you to study them, when convenient.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-18-180" n="18:180"/>If at any time when opportunity otherwise served, you thought of trying to pourtray<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> one of these very famous Bits of Ground, which are like to continue famous for a thousand years to come, I should be very happy to communicate farther with you, and give what additional directions were in my power for your guidance.</p>
<p>I regret that the circumstances of the case and time do not seem as yet to offer any other feasibility in this matter. But it seems very certain, <hi rend="italic">Good likenessesses of these Spots of Mother Earth</hi> would continue precious to a date beyond most other extant &#x2018;Works of Art&#x2019;!</p>

<p><hi rend="italic">Grantham Fight:</hi><lb/>
Cromwell&#x2019;s first Fight was &#x2018;within two miles of Grantham&#x2019; (on the Newark side of Grantham, I suppose), on the evening of &#x2018;<date when="1643-05-13">Saturday, 13 May, 1643</date>.<supplied>[&#x2019;]</supplied> He beat the Newark Cavaliers,&#x2014;&#x2018;Colonel Cromwell.&#x2019; The exact locality is not recorded in any tradition that I hear of. Nor is there, known to me, any account of the business but Cromwell&#x2019;s own Letter about it, in <hi rend="italic">Cromwelliana</hi> p. 5.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Cromwelliana</hi>, a <hi rend="italic">Chronological detail of events in which Oliver Cromwell was Engaged; from &#x2026; <date when="1642-00-00">1642</date> to &#x2026; <date when="1658-00-00">1658</date>; with a Continuation of other Transactions to the Restoration,</hi> ed. James Caulfield (<date when="1810-00-00">1810</date>).</note></p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Gainsborough Fight:</hi><lb/>
<date when="1643-07-28">28 july, 1643</date> (still in Lincolnshire); attempting to relieve Gainsborough with stores of powder &#x26;c, Cromwell is set upon by Charles Cavendish the Earl of Devonshire&#x2019;s son: Cromwell storms the Hill he (Cavendish) had occupied; drives him into &#x2018;a Bog,&#x2019; and there Whalley<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edward Whalley (d. <date when="1675-00-00">1675</date>?) served as officer under Cromwell and was his active supporter in parliament. See <hi rend="italic">Cromwell, Works</hi> 6:154&#x2013;56.</note> &#x2018;stabs him under the short ribs.&#x2019; This action made an amazing noise. The place is still known as &#x2018;Cavendish&#x2019;s Bog,&#x2019;&#x2014;a meadow, as I understand it, about two miles from Gainsborough under the brow of steep hills. An excellent account of the Transaction is in Cromwell&#x2019;s own Letter about it (Rushworth V. 279,&#x2014;my edition of this vol. of Rushworth is of <date when="1692-00-00">1692</date>).</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Winceby Field,</hi> called also, <hi rend="italic">Horncastle Fight</hi>, <date when="1643-10-11">11 October 1643</date>. Sir <pb id="pg-18-181" n="18:181"/>John Henderson, Sir Ingram Hopton,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >(d. <date when="1643-00-00">1643</date>), royalist officer, killed at Winceby; see <hi rend="italic">Cromwell, Works</hi> 6:176&#x2013;77.</note> and a body of Cavaliers are cut to pieces by Cromwell and Fairfax; the Earl of Manchester was General-in-chief, but did not come up with his foot till the others, horse principally, had decided it. Winceby, a very small hamlet, and field on the crown of a hill, is some five miles east of Horncastle in Lincolnshire. The Parliament Horse lay on Bolingbrok-Hill the night before the battle; and a great deal of marching and skirmishing had taken place before the parties settled. A copious account, intelligible if well meditated, is to be found in Vicar&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Parliamentary Chronicle</hi> (called also <hi rend="italic">Jehovah-jiveh</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Magnalia Dei</hi> in the third edition), which has Indexes that will lead you to it. Abundant Traditions, as I find, still survive in the district. &#x201C;Slash Lane&#x201D; leading from the Field of Winceby is ever since the name of the lane along which the chase went. I have many Letters and details about it. The outline maps I shewed you were of this Winceby.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Marston Moor:</hi><lb/>
<date when="1644-07-02">Tuesday 2 july 1644</date>; began at 7 in the evening. The Place is some 4 miles west of York. The best accounts are in Rushworth V. 632,3, and Cromwelliana p. 9.&#x2014; Other accounts in Clarendon, in Whitlock, and in many modern Books are nothing but a jumble of confusions and delusions. This was the fiercest fight in the whole war.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Newbury:</hi><lb/>
There were two famous Fights at Newbury (near Reading);<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Scene of two civil war battles&#x2014;<date when="1643-09-20">20 Sept. 1643</date> and <date when="1644-10-27">27 Oct. 1644</date>&#x2014;both to the slight advantage of the parliamentarians. For the second battle, see <hi rend="italic">Cromwell, Works</hi> 6:195.</note> in the second of these Cromwell had a main share: <date when="1644-10-27">Sunday 27 Oct<hi rend="italic">r</hi> 1644</date>. Clarendon&#x2019;s account (II. 717, of the edition of <date when="1819-00-00">1819</date>) is one of the best: but Vicars, Whitlock and Rushworth should all be consulted. Donnington Castle, Speen and the localities on that side of Newbury, concern us most on this occasion. Cromwell and the Earl of Manchester, his chief, had a quarrel after this battle, because Manchester would not press on, and improve his victory; which quarrel ended in the &#x2018;Self-denying Ordinance,&#x2019; and putting the whole fraternity of Half-and-halfs out of the concern.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Islip Bridge:</hi><lb/>
A few miles north of Oxford, Islip Bridge (over the river Ray) with Bletchingdon House; and then <hi rend="italic">Radcot Bridge</hi> (over the Isis or Thames) and <hi rend="italic">Bampton Bush</hi> some miles west of Oxford, are scenes of <pb id="pg-18-182" n="18:182"/>noted skirmishes by Cromwell <date when="1645-04-24">24<hi rend="italic">th</hi></date>&#x2013;<date when="1645-04-27">27<hi rend="italic">th</hi> April 1645</date>.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <hi rend="italic">Cromwell, Works</hi> 1:202&#x2013;5.</note> His own &#x2018;Letters&#x2019; about them are lost. A summary of the business is in Rushworth VI. 24,5; and in Heath&#x2019;s Chronicle (p. 121, of the small edition):<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Heath (<date when="1629-00-00">1629</date>&#x2013;<date when="1664-00-00">64</date>), royalist historian, A <hi rend="italic">Brief Chronicle of the Late Intestine Warr</hi> (<date when="1663-00-00">1663</date>).</note> details may perhaps be discoverable in the King&#x2019;s Pamphlets<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;The huge stock of loose Printing now known as <hi rend="italic">King&#x2019;s Pamphlets</hi> in the British Museum&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Cromwell, Works</hi> 6:108).</note> of <date when="1645-05-00">May 1645</date></p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Naseby:</hi><lb/>
<date when="1645-06-14">14 june 1645</date>; this was the King&#x2019;s ruin; he never rallied in any force again. Naseby, a fine old solitary hamlet, is on the N. W. edge of Northamptonshire, a mile or two on the left as you go from Northampton to Market Harborough;&#x2014;it is perhaps some seven miles from Market Harborough. Cromwell dates his Letter from that Town (&#x2018;Haverbrowe&#x2019;) on the night of the Battle.<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 6:214&#x2013;15.</note> Sprigge&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Anglia Rediviva</hi> (which has Indexes) contains a Plan of the Armies, and all kinds of authentic details. Rushworth (Fairfax&#x2019;s Secretary) was also there in person: his account is in his VI volume (which has an Index);&#x2014;there are multifarious accounts, and I have an immense mass of letters and Investigations about it. N.B. the present monumental &#x2018;obelisk&#x2019; is about a mile off, to the eastward of the real place of fighting.<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-15/lt-18420918-TC-EF-01"><sic>15:89</sic><corr>TC to EF, <date when="1842-09-18">18 Sept. 1842</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-15/lt-18420929-TC-EF-01"><sic>110</sic><corr>TC to EF, <date when="1842-09-29">29 Sept. 1842</date></corr></ref>.</note> Parties resident there can afford every facility and direction, if they have right warning.</p>

Moor near Preston, between that Town and Stonyhirst, on the north bank of the Ribble, in Lancashire: <date when="1648-08-17">17 August 1648</date>; the chase, over Darwen Bridge, by Wigan to Warrington, lasts two days more, with a hot skirmish by the road, at &#x2018;Redbank&#x2019; (a place near Winwick I should suppose). Cromwell&#x2019;s long Letter on the subject is abridged in Rushworth; can be found entire in the King&#x2019;s Pamphlets for the month in question;&#x2014;it and all other details have been republished last year, in a convenient manner, by the &#x2018;Chatham Society&#x2019; at Manchester, and are procurable with little difficulty.<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >According to TC&#x2019;s note in <hi rend="italic">Cromwell, Works</hi> 6:338, in <hi rend="italic">Tracts relating to &#x2026; Lancashire during the Civil War</hi> (Chetham Society; Manchester, <date when="1844-00-00">1844</date>) 257.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>We have to thank you for the interesting and comfortable news we got a few days ago, by your Letter written &#x201C;at the hour when you should have rested.&#x201D; No doubt you had need enough of rest; <pb id="pg-18-185" n="18:185"/>nevertheless it was a good work to let us all have assurance of your wellbeing, to gratify and comfort us all by news of your procedure in that far home you have found. I sent the Letter off, directly after we had both read it here with true satisfaction; our good Mother and the Doctor, I learn since, found it straightway in their passing thro&#x2019; Ecclefechan from the Gill. I have had two Notes from the Doctor since; by one of which he warns me that I must write to you, and not he this time; and that this is the last day for doing it. Our dear Mother, I am to assure you, is well, better than your imaginations represent; Jack bids me &#x201C;assure you with perfect truth that she is at least as well as she was last year, and in better spirits.&#x201D; &#x201C;She was extremely glad to to<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> see his (Alick&#x2019;s) Letter, and hear that he had got strong again and able to work vigorously. She desires to have her love and blessings sent to him and all his household.&#x201D; This will be the most important piece of intelligence I have to send you. The rest of us are all in the old way, if not better. Jamie, while the harvest gets ready, is looking out for a new Farm, Jack assisting him; as yet without any success. Our Mother seems to have decided that it will be agreeablest for all parties, to continue living with Jamie for her part; Jamie it seems is warmly of the same mind. I commissioned the Doctor to look accurately into this business of a Dwelling for our Mother; and, if need were, to buy or build her a fit House: but it seems as if all parties were rather tending towards the above arrangement. Jenny will, as before, come and see our Mother whenever there is need or convenience; but they &#x26; she both think it will be better that she retain her old quarters withal. Isabella, in these weeks, has got a notable accession of strength, and can now go about the kitchen, and look after her affairs herself; which is of course an immense comfort to poor Jamie and her whole house. At the Gill, it appears, there is a goodish outlook for this season; and all goes on well. At Dumfries too all well. The Doctor, as perhaps you already know, has been in those regions some two or three months now; very idle, I suppose, for most part: but indeed he has not any work exactly handy anywhere at present. Perhaps he will find some by and by; but we must just give him his head up in the mean time, and make no observations.</p>
<p>Jane went away this summer, two months ago, to see her Uncle and Cousins at Liverpool; almost the only kindred she has now left her. She staid there about a month, with them and certain other friends in that quarter; she came home to me, certainly not worse than she went away; and has been pretty well ever since. Our City is now totally <pb id="pg-18-186" n="18:186"/>&#x201C;empty,&#x201D; as they say; that is about 100,000 persons have rushed out of it, to bathe, saunter, travel, and shoot partridges; among whom are very nearly <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the persons we have any acquaintance with: so that we are quieter here for the present than we could be almost anywhere; on which ground I decide to continue where I am for this season, and not go out of Town at all. I got but little quietness last year, and no perceptible improvement of health or heart, tho&#x2019; I went seeking it at a considerable cost over many weary miles. I have never suffered from the heat this year, tho&#x2019; it has been a very genial summer, and till the <date when="1844-07-00">July</date> time exceedingly dry: but there has always been a fresh brisk wind; besides I understand the climate better now, and guard against it better. My work is terribly behind;&#x2014;but I struggle along at it, and hope one day to bring some result that shall be useful out of all this.</p>
<p>We were all delighted, dear Brother, to read of your new Home in these late <supplied>[Let]</supplied>ters: the image of you and all your <foreign>Bairns</foreign> planting Indian corn, the Father digging holes, and the little ones busily dropping-in grains, was the beautifulest thing to me I had seen for some time. God&#x2019;s blessing is on that, I think, if on anything under this Sun. Doubt it not, dear Brother, better days are coming than you have for long been acquainted with. You always were a <foreign><hi rend="italic">fell</hi></foreign> [shrewd] little fellow since you were first bolted in this world;&#x2014;and if you will struggle to abate that fiery impatience of mind, which confuses one in all ways so that one can no longer <hi rend="italic">see</hi> clearly what is one&#x2019;s own error and one&#x2019;s own truth, and thus go on in the right direction, at the right step, I do predict a blessed harvest of good for you; good temporal and spiritual! Write to us always how you get on. Never mind how brief you are in busy times. We will wait till Winter for a complete description;&#x2014;tell us only in the meanwhile how you lie from Brantford and from John Carlyle&#x2019;s, whether there is any brook or landmark near, so that one may find you exactly on the map. Your tanned cheeks, grown thin, and with a deep <foreign><hi rend="italic">lirk</hi></foreign> [crease] in them; your muscles all grown lean, but tough as iron, and invincible by toil as formerly: all this is not sad to me, it is beautiful and blessed. Only, have a care: do not work too hard either, to do yourself a mischief; that also is a fault! Remember our brave Father;&#x2014;I have never seen such a worker! It were better for <hi rend="italic">all</hi> of us, if we were like him in many ways&#x2014; If the first brush were by, you will not be so pushed in another season: the beauty of such a place is that if you <hi rend="italic">are</hi> honest and wise towards it, it will infallibly reward you. Poor little Alick and his ague does not please us so well: but we hope it has past too as the others did: it seems as if all of you would need to get <hi rend="italic">acclimated</hi> in that new country; then, we hope, you will be as healthy as in the old.&#x2014; Will you <pb id="pg-18-187" n="18:187"/>inquire, the first time you have opportunity, what is the way of getting a Package, Parcel, Box or the like conveyed to you; what it costs by the cubic foot, laid down within reach of you; and what is the best port to ship it from, London, Liverpool or which? This by the first chance you have of accurately ascertaining.&#x2014; Jack farther bids me say you are not to put &#x201C;By Halifax British Mail&#x201D; on the backs of the Letters any more; it is at best <hi rend="italic">superfluous:</hi> it was the cause, he thinks, why certain of your Letters were much belated some months ago. (No more room <hi rend="italic">here</hi>) When you see Brother John, give him our kind regards. Does Jamie send you or him the <hi rend="italic">Herald</hi> Newspaper?<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Dumfries Herald</hi>.</note> I think it might be worth while; it would be very easy to do, if you spoke of it. You will have ample time for reading in Winter,&#x2014;Newspapers and better things.&#x2014; The harvest, they say, is going to be good, for the Corns, with us this year, tho&#x2019; bad for hay and fodder:&#x2014;they seem to me to be getting rather ugly weather for it in this quarter; the wheat hereabouts, I understand, is by no means all got in yet. Distress, difficulty, discontent abound among the working classes as when you left us; nay some of the L<hi rend="italic">d</hi> John Russells now are got to admit it.&#x2014; <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign> dear Brother; I have only half room to subscribe myself&#x2014;Your affectionate&#x2014;</salute></closer><name>T. Carlyle</name></p>
<ps><p>Jane sends her kind love to all of you; rejoices heartily along with me to hear of your welldoing and wellbeing. You must commend me to Tom and Jane; excellent workers I think they will both be!&#x2014; &#x2018;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Span</hi></foreign> of horses&#x2019; is a Dutch term: <foreign><hi rend="italic">Span</hi></foreign> is still the German name for <hi rend="italic">team;</hi> to <foreign><hi rend="italic">span</hi></foreign> is to <hi rend="italic">yoke</hi>.

<salute>Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I got both your Notes; I wrote to Alick, as you requested, and sent the Letter off on Monday.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1844-08-19">19 Aug.</date></note></p>
<p>I am still very idle,&#x2014;poor wretch; tho&#x2019; the Town is still enough, there are all manner of confusions within one&#x2019;s own self. I must really gird myself together, and begin working in good earnest. My health is not bad; better, I think, than it was last year while I roamed about the world. &#x201C;Within thyself lies the mean impediment&#x201D;:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister, Works</hi> 23:83; also Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi> 196.</note> alas, that is always the real truth!</p>
<p>On Saturday last I went down the River; saw poor Scott,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alexander Scott, at Woolwich.</note> who is come back to these parts. It seems to me he is very considerably better, tho&#x2019; he does not himself feel sure of it: or perhaps the Doctors from the first overstated his case. He is working a little at a Translation of one Balbo&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Life of Dante,</hi> which he thinks of printing with Notes.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cesare Balbo (<date when="1789-00-00">1789</date>&#x2013;<date when="1853-00-00">1853</date>), Count de Vinadio, <hi rend="italic">Vita de Dante,</hi> 2 vols. (Turin, <date when="1839-00-00">1839</date>). Scott&#x2019;s trans., if completed, was never pbd., although he quoted the opening lines in his inaugural lecture at Univ. College, London, <date when="1848-00-00">1848</date>.</note> His old women were all about him; I came home in one of their carriages, with a very talkative young man, a <hi rend="italic">Nephew</hi> of Miss Farrar&#x2019;s,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably either Thomas Henry Farrer, called to the bar, <date when="1844-11-00">Nov.</date>, and with the board of trade, <date when="1848-00-00">1848</date>&#x2013;<date when="1886-00-00">86</date> (see <ref target="volume-18/lt-18440531-JWC-JW-01">JWC to JW, [<date when="1844-05-31">31 May</date>]</ref>); or his younger brother, William James (<date when="1822-00-00">1822</date>&#x2013;<date when="1911-00-00">1911</date>), educ. Oxford, <date when="1839-00-00">1839</date>&#x2013;<date when="1844-00-00">44</date>, later a solicitor and high bailiff of Westminister, knighted <date when="1887-00-00">1887</date>.</note> for company, and was glad enough to get into silence again.&#x2014; Poor Sterling, I fear, is beyond hope of life: Clark<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sir James.</note> has seen him; pronounces him incurable by any furtherance. I cannot get poor John&#x2019;s Note out of my head; it sounds thro&#x2019; me like the voice of a war-trumpet, like the music of a Roman funeral-pile! Sometimes I think of going down to the Isle of Wight to see him yet once; but he will not indicate that he desires it, that it would be other than painful to him. Anthony continues at Cowes; he sent a Note yesterday to Jane, signifying that he had been over to see his Brother, and had only the old sad story to repeat.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>The other night we had a singular little German Improvisatress here; one Madam Lyser from Dresden, who <hi rend="italic">had</hi> once had a Note for <pb id="pg-18-189" n="18:189"/>me from Goethe&#x2019;s Daughter-in-law,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mme. Lyser not further identified. Ottilie von Goethe (<date when="1796-00-00">1796</date>&#x2013;<date when="1872-00-00">1872</date>); see <ref target="volume-04/lt-18280117-TC-G-01"><sic>4:303</sic><corr>TC to G, <date when="1828-01-17">17 Jan. 1828</date></corr></ref>.</note> but was now introduced by B&#xF6;lte. She is a little black-eyed, angular-visaged, wise, curious little Sibyl of a body, this Lyser; totally unacquainted with English: we wished you had been here with your German. Neither Darwin nor I could make any hand of speaking; but she is quick as a little witch. We gave her 14 end-rhymes, and in an inconceivably brief time (really not half a minute, I think, by the watch) she had a most respectable little Sonnet crystallized upon them! I have seen nothing come near it in the improvising line,&#x2014;a curious, but alas a barren one. She is to have <foreign><hi rend="italic">Sitzung</hi></foreign> [sitting or recital] at the Hanover Rooms tomorrow; but we apprehend it will hardly pay the room-rent, so totally empty is the season, so ignorant she of all the advertising and other London ways.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >No advert. or review has been traced. The Hanover Rooms, Hanover Sq., were used for recitals.</note></p>
<p>Our <hi rend="italic">Welsh</hi> Chorley is here at present;<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >W. B. Chorley.</note> brisk as a bee: he has been twice or thrice down upon us; speaks now of returning to his wet country. He was asking after you. The other Chorley is at Liverpool.<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Either John, who lived there, or Henry visiting.</note>&#x2014; Bunsen, we hear, has returned from Berlin; is escorting a Prussian Crown-Prince, or some such thing, about the Country at present.<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Bunsen had returned in <date when="1844-07-00">July</date>. Wilhelm Friedrich Ludwig (<date when="1797-00-00">1797</date>&#x2013;<date when="1888-00-00">1888</date>), second son of King Friedrich Wilhelm III; became Prince of Prussia on accession of his brother, Friedrich Wilhelm IV, <date when="1840-00-00">1840</date>, and king, <date when="1861-00-00">1861</date>&#x2013;<date when="1888-00-00">88</date>. He and Bunsen, with the duke of Wellington, were in Portsmouth, <date when="1844-08-20">20 Aug.</date>, and in Oxford, <date when="1844-08-21">21 Aug.</date> Then they were to visit Scotland.</note> Poor Plattnauer (but this is a great secret) went off to the neighbourhood of Richmond to &#x201C;follow the water-cure&#x201D;: he plashed, and dabbled; and did I know not what, till his wits suddenly quitted him! A kind of thing like a brain-fever, I suppose; from which he is now nearly altogether recovered. Jane has been much interested about him.</p>
<p>If you do really want any Books about Dante or anything else, they can be conveyed without difficulty to Chapman&#x2019;s<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Chapman &#x26; Hall&#x2019;s</note> about the end of the month, and will come direct to Dumfries for one shilling.&#x2014; Has my good Mother tried the sea again?

To <hi rend="italic">her</hi> only of these unknown persons have I written with perfect openness&#x2014;for I judge her by her letters to me in spite of her emblazoned coats of arms and all her magnificencies to be a really warmhearted, helpful woman a <hi rend="italic">very woman</hi> tho&#x2019; a <hi rend="italic">Marchioness!</hi><note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of Ailesbury.</note> (hush) With the others I have staved off &#x201C;the particulars&#x201D; which they asked, and confined myself to assurances of his being under the best care and rapidly recovering&#x2014; But no sooner do I answer than they write again&#x2014;and&#x2014;I am tired in fact&#x2014;</p>

During all the half hour that I staid with him he was perfectly rational and composed&#x2014;(more so I am afraid than myself for I was &#x201C;too happy for anything&#x201D;&#x2014;) recognizing his actual position with a mixture of stoicism and <hi rend="italic">humour</hi>&#x2014;which rendered it rather <hi rend="italic">absurd</hi> than <hi rend="italic">horrible</hi>&#x2014;nothing could be more manly and dignified than his whole way of taking the thing&#x2014;even to his last action&#x2014;insisting <hi rend="italic">dressed as he was</hi>&#x2014; in attending me to the carriage in which he <hi rend="italic">knew</hi> Darwin was waiting for me, and apologizing to him in the most courteous manner for having detained me so long.</p>

<p><salute>My Friend,&#x2014;</salute> Today another little Note from you makes the hearts start within us.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sterling wrote, <date when="1844-08-26">26 Aug.</date>: &#x201C;My dear Friend&#x2014;I am sending off a box for you the contents of which pray accept. There is Camden&#x2019;s Britannia, a couple more volumes of Puritan Sermons the whole of which pray keep, &#x26; the folio of Sir T. Brown added as packing. I have also added most of your letters to me: &#x26; in a separate budget your wife&#x2019;s. I have some Casts of gems for her but would not venture them among the heavy baggage. / Yours and her affec<hi rend="italic">e</hi> / J. S. / Enclosed is the key of the box.&#x201D; TC wrote on the back: &#x201C;The Last.&#x201D; Sterling had previously sent TC some Puritan sermons in <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>; see <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410302-TC-JOST-01"><sic>13:48</sic><corr>TC to JOST, <date when="1841-03-02">2 March 1841</date></corr></ref>. For William Camden, see <ref target="volume-13/lt-18411202-TC-RMM-01"><sic>13:310</sic><corr>TC to RMM, <date when="1841-12-02">2 Dec. 1841</date></corr></ref>.</note> On Sunday morning gone a fortnight there came another;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dated <date when="1844-08-10">10 Aug.</date></note> which will dwell in my memory, I think, while I have any memory left. Ever since, it mingles with every thought, or is itself my <pb id="pg-18-193" n="18:193"/>thought; neither do I wish to exclude it, if I could. To me there is a tone in it as of Sphere-music, of the Eternal Melodies which we know well to be sacred;&#x2014;sadder than tears, and yet withal more beautiful than any joy. My Friend, my brave Sterling! A right valiant man; very beautiful, very dear to me; whose like I shall not see again in this world!&#x2014;</p>
<p>We are journeying towards the Grand Silence; what lies beyond it earthly man has never known, nor will know: but all brave men have known that it was Godlike, that it was right <hi rend="small-caps">good</hi>,&#x2014;that the name of it was <hi rend="small-caps">god</hi>. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Wir heissen euch hoffen</hi></foreign> [We bid you hope]. What is right and best for us will full surely be. Tho&#x2019; He slay me yet will I trust in Him. &#x201C;<hi rend="small-caps">eterno amore</hi> [Everlasting Love]&#x201D;; that <hi rend="italic">is</hi> the ultimate significance of this wild clashing whirlwind which is named Life, where the Sons of Adam flicker painfully for an hour.</p>
<p>My Wife is all in tears: no tear of mine, dear Sterling, shall, if I can help it, deface a scene so sacred. The memory of the Brother that is gone, like a brave one, shall be divine to us; and, if it please the Supreme Wisdom, we shall&#x2014;O my friend, my friend!</p>
<p>In some moods it strikes me, with a reproachful emphasis, that there would be a kind of satisfaction for me could I see you with these eyes yet again. But you are in great suffering; perhaps I should be but a disturbance? There is a natural longing that way; but perhaps it is a false pusillanimous one: I have, at bottom, no speech for you which could be so eloquent as my silence is. And yet I could be silent there too; silent and quiet. I shall let Anthony decide it between us, to whom I write today.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In reply Anthony Sterling wrote from Cowes, <date when="1844-08-30">30 Aug.</date>: &#x201C;I send you poor Johns reply to my letter stating your wish to see him.&#x201D; The answer was: &#x201C;I am quite unfit to see Carlyle. His letter was too much for me. A kinder &#x26; better one was never penned by man&#x201D; (NLS 1766.144). To J. C. Hare, Sterling wrote about this time: &#x201C;There was a Note from Carlyle not long since, I think the noblest and tenderest thing that ever came from human pen&#x201D; (A. Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">CMSB</hi> 275).</note></p>

<ps><p>Poor John Sterling, you will be very sad to learn, is gradually sinking towards his end. He himself has not had any hope for many months, and I, the most obstinate of all his friends, have now quitted hope. He sees nobody; sits solitary at Ventnor. His brother and father, who are in the Isle of Wight too, occasionally visit him, as the Maurices do, who are at present here. He is calm and strong of soul, a most serene, valiant man, and goes down like the setting of a great sun.</p></ps>

<salute>Dearest</salute>
<p>You may well say <hi rend="italic">in this instance at least</hi> that while others talk I act&#x2014;</p>
<p>Certainly I have been <hi rend="italic">acting</hi>&#x2014;with a vengeance!&#x2014; You will wonder if I have not become insane myself when I tell you <hi rend="italic">the sequel</hi>&#x2014;would to Heaven I could call it <hi rend="italic">the solution!</hi>&#x2014; Last Sunday evening Carlyle and I had just finished an early dinner preparatory to setting off on a Cockney-Sunday-excursion to the Regent&#x2019;s Park to be helped out with tea at M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Macready&#x2019;s&#x2014;when I heard a gentleman&#x2019;s voice at the door inquiring for <hi rend="italic">me</hi>&#x2014; I had heard that voice only once before in my life but I recognized it instantly as Sir Alexander Morison&#x2019;s&#x2014; What on <pb id="pg-18-195" n="18:195"/>earth had brought so busy a man to my own house?&#x2014; Was he come to tell me that <hi rend="italic">He</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Plattnauer.</note> had committed <hi rend="italic">suicide</hi> or <hi rend="italic">escaped!</hi>&#x2014; I rushed up stairs to him as white as milk&#x2014;tearing my muslin gown by the way to an extent that would have tried even the temper of Ann Jane<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Macgregor.</note>&#x2014; With an impassive air, that operated like a shower-bath on me at the moment, the good old Doctor delivered me a letter from my friend&#x2014;stating that he had &#x201C;appeared before the Committee on the previous day been pronounced <hi rend="italic">cured</hi> and how only waited till some friend should &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">take him out</hi>&#x201D;&#x2014;a formality it seemed which could not be dispensed with&#x2014; Would I <hi rend="italic">send some one</hi>&#x2014; I told Sir Alexander of course that I would come myself next morning if C could not leave his work&#x2014; But what then?&#x2014;suffer him so soon as I had emancipated him to rush out into space under the first excitement natural to recovered liberty&#x2014;and without either money or plan from all I could learn&#x2014; &#x2014;The thing was not to be thought of&#x2014;so when Sir Alexander asked &#x201C;but where will he go&#x201D;? I looked imploringly at Carlyle who, good as he always is on <hi rend="italic">great</hi> occasions, said directly &#x201C;Oh he must come <hi rend="italic">here</hi> for a while till he sees what is to be done next&#x201D;&#x2014; And so it was settled and I had no difficulty in bringing <hi rend="italic">himself</hi> to consent to the arrangement.&#x201D; Thro unavoidable hindrances I was obliged to spend nearly <hi rend="italic">the whole day</hi> in the Lunatic Asylum and a <hi rend="italic">happier</hi> day I hardly ever past in life&#x2014; At seven at night I landed him here in <hi rend="italic">a fly</hi> and here he has been ever since and will be for some time yet&#x2014; Whether it be the consciousness of having done a good action&#x2014;or that he discovers a faculty and nobleness of character in him, which he had before not allowed himself opportunity to discover; I cannot say&#x2014;but the fact is that Carlyle seems to take to him most <hi rend="italic">lovingly</hi> and shows him the uttermost kindness!! Still I have much to keep me anxious for not only does his future lie most perplexedly before us but&#x2014;whatever the D<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> and Committee have judged&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">I</hi> do not consider him by any means <hi rend="italic">sane</hi>&#x2014; He is horribly excitable&#x2014;and has many wild whims in his head which might at any moment by injudicious treatment, be exploded into madness&#x2014; And his whole bearing and manner of speech is quite changed&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">for the better</hi>&#x2014; so far as that goes&#x2014;never did he seem half so clever or noble or highbred&#x2014;but this very superiority alarms one&#x2014; I know that <hi rend="italic">I</hi> can keep him from any new crisis so long as he is beside <hi rend="italic">me</hi>&#x2014;my influence over him is without limit&#x2014;but then he cannot be <hi rend="italic">always</hi> with <hi rend="italic">me</hi>&#x2014;and I tremble at the thought of what will become of him when left to himself&#x2014; God knows&#x2014;perhaps I frighten myself needlessly and his present state is but the <hi rend="italic">natural</hi> consequen<supplied>[ce]</supplied> of the past five weeks&#x2014;</p>

<salute>My dear Sir:</salute>
<p>The writer of the enclosed Note is not personally known to me;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Ballantine.</note> I have understood that he is a young Edinburgh <hi rend="italic">House-painter</hi>, who, in <pb id="pg-18-197" n="18:197"/>these late years, has found his way into Literary notice and applause in that City,&#x2014;not without some real talent, it may be presumed. He has sent forth two Books, somewhat in the style of a Scotch Dickens, tho&#x2019; with a great deal more of <hi rend="italic">verse</hi> than Dickens uses; the Books are called the <hi rend="italic">Gaberlunzie Man</hi>, and the <hi rend="italic">Miller of Deanhaugh;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">The Gaberlunzie&#x2019;s Wallet</hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1842-00-00">1842</date>; see <ref target="volume-14/lt-18420615-TC-JBA-01"><sic>14:203</sic><corr>TC to JBA, <date when="1842-06-15">15 June 1842</date></corr></ref>) and <hi rend="italic">The Miller of Deanhaugh</hi>, both sets of sketches, like Dickens&#x2019;s works, first pbd. in monthly pts.</note></hi> I think they were published in monthly parts; I saw them in the Collected State, and looked thro&#x2019; them both, with considerable recognition of real worth in the man. A beautiful innocent sympathetic character is everywhere manifest; felicitous touches of graphic insight;&#x2014;in the verses especially a certain wild genuine <hi rend="italic">music</hi>, a strange ragged picturesqueness, free-flowing breadth of rhythm, and general <hi rend="italic">sincerity</hi> and <hi rend="italic">melody</hi> in all the senses of these words: undoubtedly there is something Poetic in this Ballantine. The whole coupled with some unripeness of judgement,&#x2014;I should say decided unripeness; if indeed he <hi rend="italic">be</hi> completely <hi rend="italic">ripenable</hi> on that side. His verses are his strong part; and these hitherto, I think, are almost all in the Scotch dialect.&#x2014; This is pretty exactly a transcript of my impression about Ballantine; neither over nor under, so far as I can help it.</p>
<p>By his Note you see what it is he now requests. If you upon these data feel justified to undertake a real inspection of his Poem,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Lilias Lee,&#x201D; a five-canto historical poem.</note> I shall be very glad if you will do it. You do not bind yourself to accept the thing; but only not to reject it except on real examination.</p>
<p>Will you be so kind as decide me this, on practical business grounds (for those alone should come into play); and if your answer be No, pray let me have the Ballantine Note back.</p>
<p>Yesterday I forwarded a little Book for Miss Martineau,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The book is unidentified. Moxon was Martineau&#x2019;s publisher.</note> which I suppose you have received and will remember in due time.</p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I would very gladly do anything I could to assist you: accordingly I wrote with considerable minuteness to Mr Moxon, the only Publisher, known to me, who at all deals in Poetry. His answer, unhappily <pb id="pg-18-198" n="18:198"/>in the negative, is now here. I do not at present see what farther to attempt. All <hi rend="italic">rhyme</hi> everywhere is considered as a questionable business by our Publishers: and indeed, tho&#x2019; <hi rend="italic">Poetry</hi> can properly never go out, yet <hi rend="italic">versified</hi> Poetry is in these times justly held in suspicion.

<salute>Dearest</salute>
<p>I am as busy as busy can be, and in the crossest possible humour so that <hi rend="italic">you</hi> have not much to hope for this day so far as <hi rend="italic">I</hi> am concerned&#x2014; The long gawk of a Scotch man has dawdled on about that closet till I could wring his neck&#x2014; Such poor encouragement does one get for cultivating the <hi rend="italic">sensibilities</hi> national and all others!&#x2014;what had I to do employing him for the sake of his scotchness&#x2014; The keeping back of the closet hinders the cleaning of your bedroom&#x2014;and then the Library <pb id="pg-18-204" n="18:204"/>is also in a mess&#x2014;for the men will not come when I want them to beat the carpet I have had out all the books however and dusted them&#x2014;and put them up&#x2014;not in <hi rend="italic">Martha Tidy</hi> style<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Tidiness like that of Martha, sister of Lazarus, the type of good housewife; see Luke 10:40.</note> according to their <hi rend="italic">sizes</hi>&#x2014;but just as the<supplied>[y]</supplied><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> were before and that is one good job finished off&#x2014;</p>
<p>For the rest all goes well enough&#x2014; Since the night of Bain Plattnauer has shown no disposition to dash out any one&#x2019;s brains&#x2014;yet I cannot say that he has been wiser&#x2014; Do you know Bain is John Mills <hi rend="italic">great man</hi> at present!!! M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Fleming told me that he had described him to <hi rend="italic">him</hi> as a person of &#x201C;the wonderfullest insight and general information that he had ever fallen in with&#x201D;!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mill wrote about Bain in <date when="1842-00-00">1842</date>: &#x201C;I can completely understand <hi rend="italic">him</hi>, because I have been, long ago, very much the same sort of person, except that I had not half his real originality&#x201D; (Mineka 13:499); see also Mineka 13:594&#x2013;95.</note>&#x2014; Poor Mill should be sent to Wandsworth<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The insane asylum where Plattnauer had been.</note>&#x2014;really. on Wednesday night I had Bolte Tizzy<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Theresa Revis.</note> and M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Fleming&#x2014;with the valuable ingredient of Darwin who struck M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Fleming with an <hi rend="italic">awe</hi> which was quite edifying&#x2014; It seems he (Jenkins hen) &#x201C;respects tranquillity of manner above every thing&#x201D; and Darwin gave him enough of <hi rend="italic">that</hi>&#x2014; Mrs Buller quite regrets not to have seen Darwin in consequence of the splendid things Fleming said of him&#x2014; She has had in compensation another visit from Mazzini, who so turned her head with his passionate pleadings for Italy that nothing would serve her but to take his bust <hi rend="italic">with his name on it in large letters</hi> to his Mother&#x2014; You are not aware perhaps that it is <hi rend="italic">death</hi> for any one in Italy to have a book of Mazzinis or a picture of him in their possession&#x2014; M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Buller would not have been <hi rend="italic">executed</hi> perhaps had the custom house people found this <hi rend="italic">work of art</hi> but she might easily have been detained &#x26; had her papers taken and other disagreeable hindrances&#x2014; so I set all this before her in so positive a manner that she gave up the devout imagination<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mazzini, apparently not knowing this, wrote to his mother, <date when="1844-09-13">13 Sept.</date>: &#x201C;Having sent you the portrait of my accuser Lord Brougham, here is my portrait.

<p><salute>Thanks, Dearest;</salute> thy good little letter was lying safe on my hat this morning in the Hall, when I came down: it is one of the happiest things I have found here yet. The Painters, the Plattnauers, the leave-takings, the sortings and the sweepings: poor Goody has enough to do! Be patient with that Scotch blockhead; he will get it all done right if you give him time. Do not hurry so much; I shall evidently not get home on Tuesday<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1844-09-16">16 Sept.</date></note> as I speculated,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; unless I prosper better than hitherto, I cannot stand much beyond.</p>
<p>Alas, if I could sleep I might be very well here: but sleep does not come, sleep flies, and I have nights in which the virtue of patience is very useful to me! I do study to keep patient; in fact there is something very soothing in the deep dead silence, broken only by the rare hooting (last night) of one poor owl, seemingly a mile off, who appeared to be the only living thing awake beside myself. For the rest I have a capacity for smoking on those occasions, which is something; my bedroom (a bedroom and dressing room) has three huge windows, and seems near twenty-feet high; the bed is excellent, of the just degree of softness, of warmth, and bolstership, and extensive as the Bed of Ware or nearly so.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Great Bed of Ware, 10 ft. 9 in. in length and breadth, with richly carved headboard and posts, topped by a canopy, once in the Saracen&#x2019;s Head Inn at Ware, then in nearby Rye House, and now in the Victoria and Albert Museum; mentioned in <hi rend="italic">Twelfth Night</hi> 3.2.</note> But all these things avail not to the one thing&#x2014; sleep. I cannot yet by any precaution make out above 5 hours; if in the morning I get to doze again, the valet with his hot water awakes me like Fate at 20 minutes past 8. On the whole, it must be borne; it is only to last a few days.&#x2014; I start generally in the morning with a dull headache, very stupid; but the breezy fresh air, and the constant <pb id="pg-18-207" n="18:207"/>motion they keep me in drive it away gradually, and I feel pretty well again at dinner,&#x2014;which, however abstinent I make it, again spoils me. <foreign>Eheu</foreign> [Alas]!&#x2014;</p>
<p>We are not a brilliant party here, nay if it were not for the Lady Harriet and myself we should almost be definable as a dull common-place one. Strachey, when he gets out, which is but seldom, threatens always to become a bore; needs always to be quizzed in again; Buller is never yet come, but is now confidently expected tonight, and will really be a welcome acquisition to us. Poodle Byng&#x2019;s companion was one Greville, an old Official hack of quality who runs race-horses, whom I have often enough seen before: memorable as a man of true aristocratic manner without any aristocratic endowment whatever,&#x2014;a Lais without the beauty.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charles Cavendish Fulke Greville (<date when="1794-00-00">1794</date>&#x2013;<date when="1865-00-00">1865</date>; <ref target="volume-18/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/11515"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), diarist and intimate of statesmen of both parties; clerk to the council, <date when="1821-00-00">1821</date>&#x2013;<date when="1859-00-00">59</date>. His diary of forty years was pbd. as <hi rend="italic">Memoirs</hi> in three series (<date when="1874-00-00">1874</date>, <date when="1885-00-00">1885</date>, <date when="1887-00-00">1887</date>) and complete (<date when="1938-00-00">1938</date>). Lais was the name of two celebrated Greek courtesans. Although he wrote an entry at the Grange, <date when="1844-09-14">14 Sept.</date>, it did not refer to TC and concerned only the controversy over O&#x2019;Connell&#x2019;s sentence by the Irish courts being reversed by the Law Lords, <date when="1844-08-04">4 Aug.</date>, about which Lord Ashburton talked &#x201C;a great deal of nonsense&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Memoirs</hi> 5:188&#x2013;89).</note> He has Court gossip, Political gossip &#x26;c, and is civil to all persons, careless about all persons;&#x2014;equal nearly to zero. &#x201C;The Poodle,&#x201D; as they call him, is serviceable as a butt for quizzing, and is also liked for his good nature.&#x2014; Lady Ashburton somewhat improves upon me; and is very anxious to ingratiate herself: a square solid American woman, happily without the accent, but with the rugged go-ahead character of that people. It is from her that your lover Baring takes his features: she speaks greatly about Lockhart, Mrs Lockhart<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably Lady Ashburton had known Sophia Lockhart (d. <date when="1837-00-00">1837</date>), Sir Walter Scott&#x2019;s da., m., <date when="1820-00-00">1820</date>, to J. G. Lockhart.</note> and so forth, and seems to aim at Literary lions. I go and pay a visit to her every day, in her remote apartment, where the interior family is. The old L<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Ashburton, especially as he <hi rend="italic">smokes</hi>, is my favourite of all; a really good solid, most cheery sagacious simple-hearted old man; he takes me long walks, to see his new churches, his labourers&#x2019; cottages, his old cedar and yew trees; carries <hi rend="italic">spunks</hi> [lucifer matches] in his pocket and cigars, and talks and is talked to. In the afternoon we all, all that are not shooting, go out in some miscellaneous cavalcade; make some circuit that will last till five; then home tired, and for me a cigar, and solitary lye on two chairs in my room, or between two bushes in the Park brings me to dressing-time, and then dinner. Lady Ashburton, wheelin<supplied>[g]</supplied><note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> in on her chair, awaits us in the drawingroom, and the evening passes as it can, till half past eleven <pb id="pg-18-208" n="18:208"/>sends the women away, and then each of us retires when he likes. Last night I made the butler give me some hot milk for supper; and just now, since I began writing, a servant offers to procure me &#x201C;some broth,&#x201D; since I decline going down to lunch; which offer I shall perhaps accept!&#x2014; Thus they ac in the various parts. On the whole they have engaged to let me &#x201C;quite alone for two whole days&#x201D; if I prolong my stay with them beyond Wednesday: that would be a real improvement!</p>
<p>To finish my description, I have only to say that our House is built &#x201C;like a Grecian Temple&#x201D; of two stories, of immense extent, massive in appearance and <hi rend="italic">fronting</hi> every way: the interior is by Inigo Jones with modern improvements.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Designed in <date when="1809-00-00">1809</date> by the architect William Wilkins (<date when="1778-00-00">1778</date>&#x2013;<date when="1839-00-00">1839</date>), the Grange was built on the site of a house by Inigo Jones (<date when="1573-00-00">1573</date>&#x2013;<date when="1652-00-00">1652</date>), part of which was retained and altered.

The house, which was considered one of the great neoclassical structures of Europe, fell into disuse after World War II and the interior was demolished. The exterior was restored, <date when="1979-00-00">1979</date>&#x2013;<date when="1983-00-00">83</date>, and it was opened to the public, <date when="1983-00-00">1983</date>.</note> The rooms are full of excellent pictures; and there is every convenience, &#x201C;&#x2014;all things was pleasant in Life; But the all-wise Cre-a-tor&#x201D; &#x26;c<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The quotation ends: &#x201C;saw that he wanted a wife&#x201D;; see <ref target="volume-17/lt-18431011-JWC-JCA-01">JWC to JCA, [ca. <date when="1843-10-11">11 Oct. 1843</date>]</ref>.</note>&#x2014; Yesterday we went all in grand order to Winchester, which I was very glad to see, but will reserve all description of.

Allen was one of the first English school inspectors, <date when="1839-00-00">1839</date>&#x2013;<date when="1846-00-00">46</date>, and apparently FitzGerald accompanied him on an inspection tour to Winchester until <date when="1844-09-16">16 Sept.</date> Allen and TC&#x2019;s mutual friends included Milnes, Thackeray, Tennyson, and James Spedding, who had apparently introduced Allen to the Carlyles, <date when="1838-00-00">1838</date>&#x2013;<date when="1839-00-00">39</date>: &#x201C;Mr Spedding once took me, nearly forty years ago, to your house&#x201D; (Allen to TC, <date when="1878-09-04">4 Sept. 1878</date>, in R.

<p>Enough, dear Goody; more than enough!

<salute>Dearest,</salute>
<p>I am bound today to Mackintosh&#x2019;s,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert J. Mackintosh.</note> which is within riding-distance of this place; but I am to ride with Lord Ashburton who has business in that direction, and know not at what hour or minute I may be called,&#x2014;for everything in the excursion line seems to hang upon accidents here, which a little diminishes the pleasure of it to a regular man. One thing too I always find settled, That I am never or hardly ever to be left to my own individual devices, but some one or other, all eager to serve me, is to be of the party. In fact, why should they keep me here in such princely style otherwise?&#x2014;</p>
<p>In brief therefore I snatch the passing moment to say, that the business is to end on Thursday first. That is the day I am to get back to thee, and our own little quiet lodge; quiet and industrious, tho&#x2019; dusty and in Cockneyland. Thursday: I will write again to specify the hour. This is all my news that can be called essential.</p>
<p>Charles Buller came yesterday; our Poodle and Greville have already gone today. Strachey still lingers; but goes tomorrow. I, on Thursday, as I said; Buller on Saturday&#x2014;</p>
<p>Yesterday there came a rag of a Letter from Plattnauer; very daft; which I enclose: make to him, as from me, <hi rend="italic">any</hi> answer you see good: <pb id="pg-18-210" n="18:210"/>That I am coming soon; that he must by no means stir till I consult with him at large, that Dr Weiss<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A German physician resident in London; see <ref target="volume-18/lt-18440920-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1844-09-20">20 Sept.</date></ref> He was probably of the same family as Frederick F.

<p>I had also a Letter from Jack;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >From Scotsbrig, <date when="1844-09-11">11 Sept.</date></note> of some length; but giving almost no news of interest, except that the bacon hams are under way, and will arrive this week.&#x2014; Nickisson&#x2019;s Proof came also and detained me the whole day:<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Proofs of &#x201C;An Election to the Long Parliament&#x201D; for <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s</hi>.</note> a dull day, at any rate; partly rainy; which the Poodle and others had to pass chiefly under the Porticos, laboriously pacing to and fro.&#x2014; My sleep is slightly improved, not much; it will do till Thursday. My <hi rend="italic">shirts</hi> are then also exactly <hi rend="italic">out</hi>.</p>
<p>I know not what has dirtied my blotting-paper, and made this sheet shameful!&#x2014;</p>

<salute>My dear good Mother,</salute>
<p>I received Jack&#x2019;s letter here; for which you must thank him very kindly, and say I will answer straightway,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; from Chelsea most probably. I have sent Jane an account of his news and commissions thither.</p>
<p>But it seems to me I ought to write <hi rend="italic">you</hi> a word from this big House, for truly you are often in my thoughts here; and I fancy I could be blither in the upstairs room at Scotsbrig than in most of these sumptuous places where for the present days I live!</p>
<p>I have been here now exactly a week; I have decided to be off home again the day after Tomorrow. They brought me in a carriage <pb id="pg-18-211" n="18:211"/>from the Railway Station,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >At Winchester, 47 mi. from London.</note> and I suppose will take me back; there is then nothing but two hours of railwaying, and I am on the bank of the Thames within few minutes of Chelsea.</p>
<p>My visit has been pleasant &#x26; successful everyway,&#x2014;except for want of <hi rend="italic">sleep:</hi> I can never get enough of sleep!</p>
<p>Charles Buller is now here, various persons have been here,&#x2014;the L<hi rend="italic">d</hi>-Howicks whom John knows about, &#x201C;took cold&#x201D; and could not come. Old L<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Ashburton here is an excellent old man, whom I have real pleasure in talking with, as we ride together: there are his wife and two Daughters, and a Lady Harriet his daughter-in-law, one of the Queens of the world,&#x2014;really a most clever woman: these are our female outfit. The house is stately and commodious; there are 700 acres of wood and green by way of Park: on the whole, I hope I shall not be sorry that I came;&#x2014;nor that I went home again, to try for a little sleep!</p>
<p>Dear Mother, I am in very great haste; all manner of small silly calls upon me, and no regulation in my movements, because no <hi rend="italic">work</hi> in my day. &#x201C;Lunch,&#x201D; for example, is now waiting, and from minute to minute I expect a valet to summon me down.</p>
<p>I will send my blessings to you dear Mother and to all the rest,&#x2014; and write more at large soon. Jamie is busy shearing, I here am the idlest of men. Tell Jack that <hi rend="italic">D&#x2019;Ewes</hi> is coming out next Fraser. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign> dear Mother. Your affectionate</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dearest</salute>
<p>I have absolutely no composure of Soul for writing just now&#x2014; The fact is I have undertaken far more this time than human discretion would have dreamt of putting into one week&#x2014; Knowing your horror of <hi rend="italic">sweeps</hi> and carpet-beaters and &#x201C;all that sort of thing&#x201D; I would, in my romantic self-devotion, <hi rend="italic">sweep</hi> <hi rend="small-caps">all</hi> the Chimnies and lift <hi rend="small-caps">all</hi> the carpets before you came and had you arrived this day as you first proposed you would have found us still in a regular mess threatening to thicken into &#x201C;immortal smash&#x201D;</p>
<p>But by Thursday I hope to have &#x201C;got every thing satisfactorily arranged&#x201D; as poor Plattnauer is always saying&#x2014; And there have been so many other things to take me up besides the sweeps &#x26;c Almost every <pb id="pg-18-212" n="18:212"/>evening somebody has been here&#x2014; The evening of the Bullers departure Jenkin&#x2019;s Hen came pale as a candle with a red circle round each eye which was very touching&#x2014;he had evidently been <hi rend="italic">crying</hi> himself quite sick and sore&#x2014; Lady Lewis had invited him to dine with <hi rend="italic">her</hi>&#x2014; but &#x201C;he could not go <hi rend="italic">there</hi>&#x2014;he could not eat any dinner&#x2014;he was <hi rend="italic">afraid</hi> to go home to his own silent house&#x2014;he thought <hi rend="italic">I</hi> could <hi rend="italic">understand his feelings</hi> and so had come to pass the evening with <hi rend="italic">me</hi>&#x201D;&#x2014; What a gift of <hi rend="italic">understanding peoples feelings</hi> I am supposed to have&#x2014;<foreign>moi</foreign>&#x2014; Oh my Dear the Cat produced two kittens in your bed this morning&#x2014;and we have drowned them&#x2014;and now <hi rend="italic">she</hi> also thinks I can understand her feelings and is coming about my feet mewing in a way that quite wrings my heart&#x2014;Poor thing! I never saw her take on so badly before&#x2014; Well! but on Saturday night Helen had just gone to seek sugar for the tea when a rap came which I prefered answering myself to allowing Plattnauer to answer it&#x2014;and Oh Heavens&#x2014;what should I see in the dark opening? a little human phenomenon in a triple cornered hat!&#x2014; Bishop Terrot again! I <hi rend="italic">screamed</hi> a good genuine horrified scream! whereupon he stept in&#x2014;and, as the devil would have it, on my bad toe! and then I uttered a series of screams! which made Plattnauer <hi rend="italic">savage</hi> with him for the rest of the evening&#x2014; He had come up to seek himself a new assistant&#x2014;the old one being promoted&#x2014; There is no end of his calls to London! But he was plainly mortally afraid of Plattnauer&#x2014;who as good as told him that he was &#x201C;one of the windbags&#x201D;&#x2014; and will not trouble us again I think while he is here&#x2014;</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon came Henry Taylor but only for a few minutes&#x2014;he had been unexpectedly &#x201C;turned adrift on our shores&#x201D; and could only wait till a Wandsworth steamer should come up&#x2014; I was very kind to him, and he looked as if he could have <hi rend="italic">kissed me</hi> for being glad to see him&#x2014; Oh how old! I put on my bonnet and went with him to the boat&#x2014;and he complimented me on going out without gloves or shawl&#x2014;I was &#x201C;the first woman he had ever found in this world who could go out of her house without at least a quarter of an hours preparation&#x201D;!&#x2014; They have taken a house at Mortlake near Richmond&#x2014;</p>
<p>But there is no possibility of telling you all the things I have to tell at this writing.&#x2014; They will keep till you come&#x2014; Only let me not forget to say there is an American letter come for John which I send on by this days post</p>
<p>Your letter written apparently on Saturday evening was not read by me till yesterday afternoon. The Postman came so long after twelve, when I had been under an imperative necessity to go out.&#x2014; <closer><salute>Give my Love to <hi rend="italic">Mr</hi> Baring</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>A short Letter to our Mother would announce to you that I received yours<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1844-09-11">11 Sept.</date></note> at the Grange, and was going on in the usual way there. I came home, as appointed, yesterday; the good people took me in a carriage to the Railway Station; in a second-class carriage, in a sunny sharp <date when="1844-09-00">September</date> Afternoon, I was rapidly bowled back to Chelsea, <pb id="pg-18-214" n="18:214"/>and found all well here,&#x2014;myself terribly cut up with ten days of late dining and other excitement. I saw Winchester,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Carlyle had written: &#x201C;Have you been to see Winchester in detail? You should not neglect doing so with such an opportunity. The Cathedral particularly is well worth a visit.&#x201D;</note> and various other things that were interesting. The jaunt, I calculate, will do me good, were I once got to composure again. The people are good people, old Lord Ashburton especially I liked well; a fine old gentleman, somewhat in the style of Old Cressfield,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. William Little of Cressfield, a house nr. Ecclefechan built by TC&#x2019;s father; see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18351127-TC-JAC-01"><sic>8:258</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1835-11-27">27 Nov. 1835</date></corr></ref>.</note> but of lighter make and more elegant breeding; courtesy, sagacity, easy friendliness and good humour throughout: he and I went smoking cigars together, and grew very fond of one another.</p>
<p>At home Jane had papered anew and painted my little dressing-room, where you and I used to smoke together; she had also new-carpeted the diningroom in a very bright style; and in short had all the house shining for me, as her way is. Plattnauer had been quiet with her, but mad and ever madder in his notions: he is now going off this night by a Rotterdam Steamer towards Switzerland and lighter air; a certain Dr Weiss, a German of skill, who had seen him during his outbreak and before and after it, was altogether urgent upon Jane that such, without any delay at all, should be the arrangement. Madness, he says, and even fury is still in Plattnauer, only brewing towards new development, which will surely arrive in our first week of foggy weather; he ought to go, and must go, in <foreign><hi rend="italic">Gottes namen</hi></foreign> [in God&#x2019;s name];&#x2014;and so accordingly he goes, we making arrangements to know his Address in case his brother-in-law <hi rend="italic">should</hi> come, which however is not thought likely. So much for Plattnauer.</p>
<p>Jane tells me she sent-on Alick&#x2019;s Letter without venturing to open it; pray let me have a sight of it so soon as they have all examined it. You will perhaps send some summary of it sooner than that.</p>
<p>This morning came a sad stern Letter: news from Anthony Sterling that his Brother is no more. An <hi rend="italic">end</hi> to many things! We shall see that beautiful human soul no more on this Earth.&#x2014; Anthony, I think, had gone over as if by accident the night before last; found his Brother not sensibly altered; talked with him on many subjects from 9 o&#x2019;clock and afterwards: at 11 he was summoned hastily to see him die. His death was not painful. He has departed like a brave and true one. May we meet again beyond the Unseen Shore!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In his Journal TC wrote: &#x201C;My beloved friend John Sterling died at Ventnor in the Isle of Wight, on <date when="1844-09-18">Wednesday 18 Sept<hi rend="italic">r</hi> 1844</date> about 11 at night; his Brother, who had incidentally gone down thither &#x2018;about 9 that night&#x2019; had been talking copiously with him and had taken leave, anticipating nothing unusual. At eleven, it was all ended. / For a long while I refused to believe in Sterling&#x2019;s danger; of late weeks it became sternly apparent to me: he himself had for many months anticipated inevitable death only, and with singular calmness, and constant industry according to his strength, occupied himself in setting his house in order. I had two notes from him, very affecting to me, and sent him two. He refused to see me, tho&#x2019; I think there were few living he loved better. Four days before his death he composed some stanzas of verse addressed to me; not to be delivered till he were gone. I received them the day before yesterday; keep them among my precious things. I have had a great loss; which will gradually become more sensible to me in all its details. He was a noble character, full of brilliancy, of rapid light-flashes in every kind; and loved me heartily well. Ah me! These verses were written on Friday the <date when="1844-09-14">14 Sept<hi rend="italic">r</hi></date>, that day I was at Winchester. He sat writing at Ventnor in those hours; such words; in such a mood! In his conversation, during the late months, his Brother chiefly being with him, he would often say, &#x2018;God is Great.&#x2019; He held by that religion; that did not fail, tho&#x2019; much had proved chimerical, and been indignantly hurled out by him as false and inane. God is Great.&#x2014; I shall never see John Sterling more, then; my noble Sterling!&#x2014; / <date when="1844-10-01">Tuesday, 1 Oct<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, 1844</date>&#x2014;&#x201D; TC went on, as if in anticipation of his life of Sterling: &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">same date</hi>. There is much else to be written; but it does not cohere with what is already down, and may wait for a fitter day.&#x201D;<lb/><lb/>
Sterling&#x2019;s verses are:<lb/><lb/>
&#x201C;To Thomas Carlyle<lb/>
<lg><l>1<lb/>
O! Carlyle could I find a word</l><lb/>
<l>Before I leave this earthly shore</l><lb/>
<l>Of greater orb than e&#x2019;er was heard</l><lb/>
<l>By kinsman or by friend before</l></lg><lb/><lb/>
<lg><l>2<lb/>
To thee that Word I&#x2019;d surely breathe</l><lb/>
<l>For thou would guard it in a cell</l><lb/> 
<l>Deep-built as central caves beneath</l><lb/>
<l>And Silence is the Sentinel</l></lg><lb/><lb/>
<lg><l>3<lb/>
There long thy Thoughts are steeped in flames</l><lb/>
<l>And in the thrice-locked fount of tears</l><lb/>
<l>Till sounded forth at once they shame</l><lb/>
<l>And rouse a host with tingling ears.</l></lg><lb/><lb/>
<lg><l>4<lb/>
For not as in a bounded bay</l><lb/>
<l>Thy billows roll unripe &#x26; weak,</l><lb/>
<l>But from a thousand leagues away</l><lb/>
<l>The long vast waters booming speak</l></lg><lb/><lb/>
<lg><l>5<lb/>
Such roar on crags &#x26; sands of earth</l><lb/>
<l>I ne&#x2019;er have heard, nor felt the Soul</l><lb/>
<l>So startled into throes of birth</l><lb/>
<l>By piercing clang or awful toll.</l></lg><lb/><lb/>
<lg><l>6<lb/>
But greater een than this the Right</l><lb/>
<l>Of him who knows thee friend to friend</l><lb/>
<l>To whom Laugh groan &#x26; maddest flight</l><lb/>
<l>More than the Sage the Man commend.</l></lg><lb/><lb/>
<lg><l>7<lb/>
That I shall leave behind me here</l><lb/>
<l>A greater Soul below the sky</l><lb/>
<l>I know not, knowing none more dear</l><lb/>

<salute>Dear Jean,</salute>
<p>I must in a hurried word acknowledge the arrival of the Garthwaite clothes, in which tho&#x2019; there is no word said I detect your friendly and judicious finger, successfully doing its work! The dressing-gown is very well; the cloth much liked; and fits, and will suit well, tho&#x2019; Garthwaite has made it <hi rend="italic">without cuffs;</hi> following some distracted trace of a new fashion, I suppose. No matter about the cuffs; but there is one real omission; the want, namely <supplied>[of half a]</supplied> yard of the same cloth to mend with, to make new sleeves with. Perhaps the omission was not yours: and if so, Garthwaite must still have a mass of remnants, not one clipping <pb id="pg-18-217" n="18:217"/>of which shews its face here. Will you look into it for me. Your best way will be to forward this Note to Jamie at Scotsbrig (if you did intend that there should be a remnant), and let Jamie examine the state of the Tailor&#x2019;s Cabbage,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Waste clippings.</note> and report to you: at the end of the account, do not neglect to let me have by Jack a sufficient piece or set of clippings to mend with; whether rescued from the cabbage or purchased anew from the shop, let them arrive <hi rend="italic">here</hi>. My old dressinggown is not nearly done yet; I am strong in dressing gowns.&#x2014; The black waistcoat was well chosen as to cloth &#x26;c: it is wron<supplied>[g bu]</supplied>t we have now discovered a way of remedying it by a hook-and-eye. The Trowsers seem of a cloth not unknown here, and will fairly serve the turn.</p>
<p>Perhaps you already know I was in Hampshire, visiting great people for a few days lately. My host was Lord Ashburton, who did the American Treaty as our Ambassador two years ago:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Ashburton Treaty was concluded at Washington, <date when="1842-00-00">1842</date>; see <ref target="volume-14/lt-18420213-TC-TSS-01"><sic>14:42</sic><corr>TC to TSS, <date when="1842-02-13">13 Feb. 1842</date></corr></ref>.</note> a very worthy courteous and good old man. We had bright weather for most part, a pleasant company, an immense park and house all to ourselves: if I could have <hi rend="italic">slept</hi>, I should have certainly done well; as it was, I did well <hi rend="italic">enough</hi>, and really got some good of it, I hope. The legions of flunkies, stirring you up at every turn, were a great annoyance to me! It is all over now.</p>
<p>Returning home I found Jane well, and my side of the House <hi rend="italic">papered</hi> anew and painted. She beats us all for a deep thought! <supplied>[W]</supplied>e have had a poor German young gentleman these three weeks in our house; lately recovered from temporary <hi rend="italic">madness</hi>, and without any other even of the rank of an acquaintance here to look after him. He went away last night in a Rotterdam Steamer; he is to meet his Brother-in-law, a rich Silesian Count,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Oskar von Reichenbach.</note>&#x2014;from whom just in the nick of time we had a Letter of thanks to ourselves, and of direction for the poor Patient how to meet him over the sea. We were very glad to be handsomely quit of the business.</p>
<p>Poor John Sterling&#x2014;alas, he is now no more among us: he died on Wednesday night last; full of a kind of sublime composure; a most brave and beautiful soul of a man,&#x2014;whom we are not again to behold in this world. &#x201C;God is great.&#x201D; That was a word often in his mouth, while he sat composed to die.</p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>About a fortnight ago, just as I was leaving Town for a short run into Hampshire, there arrived from you a beautiful Box of Peaches addressed to my Wife; which now, at my return, I am shocked to find all eaten, and never yet acknowledged by any word of thanks or recognition! My Wife trusted to me for writing; says, I promised to write: I, unconscious of promise, naturally trusted to her. Enough, the Peaches, if there be truth in testimony, were excellent; and had a grateful welcome, as I can state without testimony. Many thanks to you for your continued friendliness, your unwearied remembrance of us.</p>
<p>This little excursion to Lord Ashburton&#x2019;s place in Hampshire is all the rustication I am to have this year. I saw Winchester, the tombs of the Old Saxon, Danish and Norman kings;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Winchester had been King Alfred&#x2019;s capital; Edward the Confessor was crowned there; and William the Conqueror, also crowned there as well as in London, made the city a joint capital. Some tombs that TC saw were long thought to be of certain kings but have since proved not to be. There are, however, six mortuary chests, dating from the sixteenth and seventeenth cents., which contain the bones of Canute, William Rufus, and several Anglo-Saxon monarchs.</note> a fair expanse of downs and parks, and pleasant cottages, and high-towered mansions here and there; and various other pleasant things and persons;&#x2014;and, on the whole have accomplished my little journey not unsuccessfully, nor perhaps without profit, tho&#x2019; I was very sick and sleepless all the while. My <hi rend="italic">work</hi> is now the one thing needful; and that, alas, lies very helpless-looking all round me! God only knows what I shall make of that; but I must really try now.</p>
<p>In the next <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine</hi> is a set of rather stupid old British-Museum Papers, which I have printed there, with some words of remark.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;An Election to the Long Parliament.&#x201D;</note> They cannot interest any human creature much; but, if they come in your way, you may cast an eye over them.</p>
<p>My Wife came home from Lancashire, where she staid a month among Friends, rather improved by the excursion, and still continues pretty well; my Brother is still in Annandale beside his Mother. None of us thought of going to the &#x201C;Burns Festival&#x201D;; which indeed I am happy to see the rational part of the community did rather universally avoid, being sick of that kind of Tomfoolery.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-18/lt-18440706-TC-WBAJG-01">TC to <sic>WB and JG</sic><corr>WBAJG</corr>, <date when="1844-07-06">6 July</date></ref>.</note> &#x201C;Respect for Genius&#x201D;: O my beloved brethren, when I look at the men whom you have paid <pb id="pg-18-219" n="18:219"/>respect to, and the men whom you have refused respect to, and hung on gibbets instead of setting on thrones, I have to declare that your &#x201C;respect&#x201D; smells somewhat malodorous in the human nostril; and will beg that you would on the whole carry it elsewhither!

<salute>Dear Lady Ashburton,</salute>
<p>This is not yet the &#x201C;Posthumous Letter,&#x201D; which I hope is still at some distance; this is a little Note to announce to you that I arrived safe; that the beneficent Phantom Gig, the rail-train, and all earthly and celestial propulsive powers <hi rend="italic">were</hi> beneficent and kind to me, on my way to and at and from The Grange;&#x2014;and that I have many many thanks to render you for the happy time I had there. Certainly I shall not soon forget The Grange. I was very sick of body while among you, and sleepless, and oppressed by chaos, as the Son of Adam is apt to be; and yet happier than I can remember for a long while back. Let us be thankful to the Heavenly Powers, and their servants here on Earth!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Among the litter of my Papers I have found you three Autographs, if you judge them worthy a place in your Collection. There is but one of the man whom I judge to be, even in a small way, of a perennial character; and he, I am happy to acknowledge, is your Countryman.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably Emerson.</note> The others too are persons of worth, more or less,&#x2014;as it pleases God. Varnhagen is known to the Lady Harriet; she, when she comes home again full of German Literature, will read you his Note,&#x2014;and find it most probably a hollow nut.</p>
<p>I desire my very kind remembrances to Lord Ashburton, whose social cigars and friendly communings are, and will be, pleasant to me to think of. Will the two young Ladies accept my regrets that I did not <pb id="pg-18-220" n="18:220"/>see them at parting?<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lydia Emily and Louisa Baring.</note> Will Miss Baring <hi rend="italic">revise</hi> certain of her opinions, especially about the Chimera &#x201C;Martyr,&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charles I.</note> and produce them in an improved state next time?&#x2014;</p>
<p>You can tell Lady Harriet that my Friend Sterling has quitted all his sorrows; his Transiency has become an Eternity,&#x2014;beautiful, I will hope, as the swift transient Life itself was. He died on Wednesday night, the night before I left you;&#x2014;unexpectedly at last, and to appearance without pain. To my mind it is like the setting of a summer sun; beautiful even to tears.</p>
<p><closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Lady Ashburton. I will wish fair weather and all good things to The Grange and its kind inmates. With many thanks and regards</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I applied to Mr Moxon about your Poem; he is the only Publisher dealing in Poetry whom I am acquainted with: here is his answer, which I regret to say is negative.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC had apparently forgotten that he had already told Ballantine this; see <ref target="volume-18/lt-18440910-TC-JBA-01">TC to <sic>JB</sic><corr>JBA</corr>, <date when="1844-09-10">10 Sept.</date></ref></note> What farther to do I know not; for I did my best with him, and I know no other likely. I am afraid you will find it difficult to meet with a Publisher here. Poetry of all kinds gets less and less acceptance in this time; and your Poem seems to be <pb id="pg-18-222" n="18:222"/>of a special sort, more adapted for Scotland than for the South. Indeed if I might give you counsel, it would be rather to beware of quitting the field where you have succeeded, and committing yourself to this new one, which is yet untried, and is not at best in great favour at present.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lord Cockburn sent &#x201C;Lilias Lee&#x201D; to Francis Jeffrey for his opinion; and Jeffrey replied, <date when="1845-03-13">13 March 1845</date>, that it was &#x201C;deficient in condensation &#x2026; and originality of conception&#x201D; and that Ballantine should look on poetry &#x201C;as an elegant and interesting occupation for his leisure hours&#x201D; and, <date when="1845-03-26">26 March 1845</date>, that he hoped Cockburn had &#x201C;softened my dehortation to the ingenious, and, I am persuaded, amiable author&#x201D; (Glasgow <hi rend="italic">Herald</hi>, <date when="1910-07-22">22 Jan. 1910</date>).</note> Direct Prose seems to me a better vehicle for uttering one&#x2019;s meaning, so long as it <hi rend="italic">can</hi> be uttered in Speech, or in Prose; and when it cannot any longer be <hi rend="italic">spoken</hi>, but must and will be <hi rend="italic">sung</hi>, why then you can sing it, in incidental verses, with good effect, as you have been used to do. But it is the quantity of beautiful and true things which a man has got in him that exactly determines the worth of his utterance, let it be in prose or in verse, by tongue, by pen or pencil, that he utters himself. Nay the best utterance of all, as I say often, is <hi rend="italic">silence</hi> and &#x201C;beautiful and true&#x201D; working and living, if that be one&#x2019;s appointment.</p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Plattnauer has quitted this country about a week ago; so that we need not now spend any more of our time on his case. He staid with us here a fortnight or more, in really interesting circumstances. I wished to certify you of a thing or two respecting him, of which I myself had become gradually certain: That he was a man of strict honour and integrity, of good talent and acquirement, of dignified manners, of much real manly worth; that he was not, and to appearence had never been, in the least disaffected against his native Government, or any person or thing connected therewith; that he seemed to me very capable of doing good service, by his sword, or his pen, or in many other ways, as his rank pointed out, in his native Country; were the career reopened to him;&#x2014;and that here, for want of such permission, <pb id="pg-18-223" n="18:223"/>the obstructions pressing on him were frightful. Of course you do not know his late history. External difficulties, long weighing on an earnest true and proud spirit, had at length acted on his health; being a man of iron energy and resolution he had decided on strenuous measures for the cure of his body at least,&#x2014;on the <hi rend="italic">water-cure</hi>, namely, and had prosecuted this with such determination that it brought on a kind of brain-fever (not uncommon, I am told, in such cases); and the kindness of comparative strangers had to deliver him, one may say, really from <hi rend="italic">the Abyss</hi>. He is now put in communication with friends; sent to travel by the pressing order of his Doctor; mind and body, I do think, on the way towards complete cure: and so we may hope better days at least than these latter ones are coming for the poor young man. I do not know that you can now do anything for him, or that you could ever have done much: but I state the above facts to you, as facts I am very clear about; and if at any time you have opportunity of repeating them in the proper quarter, with your own added conviction that they <hi rend="italic">are</hi> facts,&#x2014;why, it may do some good to a really brave man, and so give a pleasure to yourself withal. And now enough of Plattnauer.</p>

<salute>Dear Emerson,</salute>
<p>There should a Letter have come for you by that Steamer; for I wrote one duly, and posted it in good time myself: I will hope therefore it was but some delay of some subaltern official, such as I am told occasionally chances, and that you got the Letter after all in a day or two.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson wrote, <date when="1844-09-01">1 Sept.</date>: &#x201C;I looked eagerly for a letter from you by the last steamer, to give me exact tidings of Sterling. None came.&#x201D; TC&#x2019;s letter was dated <date when="1844-08-05">5 Aug.</date></note> It would give you notice, more or less, up to its date, of all the points you had inquired about: there is now little to be added; except concerning the main point, That the Catastrophe has arrived there, as we foresaw, and all is ended.</p>
<p>John Sterling died at his house in Ventnor on the night of <date when="1844-09-18">Wednesday 18<hi rend="italic">th</hi> September</date>, about eleven o&#x2019;clock; unexpectedly at last, and to appearance without pain. His Sister-in-law, Mrs Maurice, had gone down to him from this place about a week before; other friends were waiting as it were in view of him; but he wished generally to be alone, to continue to the last setting his house and his heart more and more in order for the Great Journey. For about a fortnight back he had ceased to have himself formally dressed; had sat only in his dressinggown, but I believe was still daily wheeled into his Library, and sat very calmly sorting and working there. He sent me two Notes, and various messages, and gifts of little keepsakes to my Wife and myself: the Notes were brief, stern and loving; altogether noble; never to be forgotten in this world. His Brother Anthony, who had been in the Isle of Wight within call for several weeks, had now come up to Town again; but, after about a week, decided that he would run down again, and look. He arrived on the Wednesday night, about nine o&#x2019;clock; found no visible change; the brave Patient calm as ever, ready to speak as ever,&#x2014;to say, in direct words which he would often do, or indirectly as his whole speech and conduct did, &#x201C;God is Great.&#x201D; Anthony and he talked for a while, then took leave for the night; in few minutes more, Anthony was summoned to the bedside, and at 11 o&#x2019;clock as I said the curtain dropt, and it was all ended.&#x2014; <foreign><hi rend="italic">Euge</hi></foreign> [Alas]!</p>
<p>Whether the American <hi rend="italic">Mss</hi>. had arrived I do not yet know,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >From Andrew L. Russell, a manufacturer of Plymouth, Mass., who had received MSS from Sterling and had considered publishing them but had failed to do so in spite of Emerson&#x2019;s urging. Emerson had written, <date when="1844-09-01">1 Sept.</date>, that the MSS were being returned to Sterling. See <ref target="volume-14/lt-18420719-TC-RWE-01"><sic>14:229</sic><corr>TC to RWE, <date when="1842-07-19">19 July 1842</date></corr></ref>.</note> but <pb id="pg-18-225" n="18:225"/>probably shall before this Letter goes; for Anthony is to return hither on Tuesday, and I will inquire. Our Friend is buried in Ventnor Churchyard; four big Elms overshadow the little spot; it is situated on the South-east side of that green Island, on the slope of steep hills (as I understand it) that look towards the Sun, and are close within sight and hearing of the Sea. There shall he rest, and have fit lullaby, this brave one. He has died, as a man should; like an old Roman, yet with the Christian Bibles and all newest revelations present to him. He refused to see friends; men whom I think he loved as well as any, me for one when I obliquely proposed it, he refused. He was even a little stern on his nearest relatives when they came to him: Do I need your help to die? Phocion-like he seemed to feel degraded by physical decay; to feel that he ought to wrap his mantle round him, and say, &#x201C;I come, Persephoneia; it is not I that linger!&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Phocion (<date>402?</date>&#x2013;<date>317 B.C.</date>), Athenian gen. and statesman, became virtual dictator in Athens under Antipater&#x2019;s domination, and on restoration of democracy was condemned to death on a false charge of treason. The quotation is attrib. to Zeno by Diogenes Laertius in his <hi rend="italic">Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers</hi> (Bohn&#x2019;s Classical Library, <date when="1853-00-00">1853</date>) 270.</note>&#x2014; His Sister-in-law, Anthony&#x2019;s Wife, probably about a month ago, while they were still in Wight, had begged that she might see him yet once; her husband would be there too, she engaged not to speak. Anthony had not yet persuaded him, when she, finding the door half open, went in: His pale changed countenance almost made her shriek; she stept forward silently, kissed his brow in silence; he burst into tears. Let us speak no more of this.&#x2014; &#x2014; A great quantity of papers, I understand, are left for my <supplied>[determ]</supplied>ination;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >MS torn; the word may be &#x201C;examination.&#x201D;</note> what is to be done with them I will sacredly endeavour to do.</p>
<p>I have visited your Bookseller Chapman; seen the Proofsheets lying on his table; taken order that the reprint shall be well corrected,&#x2014;indeed I am to read every sheet myself, and in that way get acquainted with it, before it go into stereotype.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson wrote, <date when="1844-09-01">1 Sept.</date>: &#x201C;I send by this steamer some sheets, to the bookseller, John Chapman,&#x2014;proof sheets of my new book of Essays. Chapman wrote me by the last steamer, urging me to send him some manuscript that had not yet been published in America, &#x26; he thought he could make an advantage from printing it, and even in some conditions, procure a copy-right; and he would publish for me on the plan of half-profits. The request was so timely &#x2026; that I came to town yesterday, &#x26; hastened the printers, and have now sent him proofs of <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the Address &#x26; of more than half the book. If you can give Chapman any counsel, or save me from any nonsense, by enjoining on him careful correction, you shall.&#x201D; Chapman had written to Emerson, <date when="1844-08-03">3 Aug.</date>, on a letter of introduction by Henry Wright.

<p>I should still wish that, if opportunity offered, you could see this Youth with your own eyes, and form your judgement about him: but in real truth, probably this Edinburgh situation may be a suitabler and safer one for him than any we could have fallen in with here.</p>

<p>We have no news here worth communicating, since I last wrote; besides I am very busy today. But it strikes me you are not likely to get a sight of <hi rend="italic">Fraser</hi> where you are, and so I may as well inclose you a Copy of the D&#x2019;Ewes Concern, which you may like to see under its new <pb id="pg-18-228" n="18:228"/>guise. There are some errors in the arrangement of the Notes &#x26;c; for it was all flying in confused slips while I had it at the Grange, and there was very little leisure to correct it there.&#x2014; I still wish considerably I had a Copy Complete of D&#x2019;Ewes&#x2019;s Parliament Notes; and think if I fall in with an eligible Copyist I will employ him. The wretched <hi rend="italic">Tick</hi> whom I employed to copy this of the Election offered to do the other for &#xa3;30; but I discovered that he was a mere quack and miserable liar; <hi rend="italic">lent</hi> him therefore an additional half-sovereign, and of course never saw him more&#x2014; I think I could make &#xa3;30 out of it by and by!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Jane has bought a new <hi rend="italic">Piano</hi>; very cheap; all with capital of her own: we have now therefore a little music of an evening.&#x2014; Craik&#x2019;s Professorship is undecided hitherto; tho Mr Denison sent me a very civil answer; had given my Letter to the Duke<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of Portland.</note> in whose house he was, with whom it would have &#x26;c &#x26;c: but there is nothing definite yet, or like it.&#x2014; Plattnauer has written; all well; he is in communication with his Brother-in-law, but seems posting rapidly up the Rhine towards Switzerland.</p>
<p>I want to know how my good dear Mother is, now that the leaves begin to drop!&#x2014; You can tell Jamie, on good authority, the ham is excellent; and very useful in its generation.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf.

<salute>Dear Forster,</salute>
<p>A certain Bookseller, one Chapman in Newgate Street, is reprinting with authority from Emerson himself a new Book of Emerson&#x2019;s; in which operation I am of course bound to be in all ways helpful.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-18/lt-18440929-TC-RWE-01">TC to RWE, <date when="1844-09-29">29 Sept.</date></ref></note> Chapman hopes and believes that by making some kind of application to <pb id="pg-18-229" n="18:229"/>some kind of Privy Council by virtue of some kind of Act about International Copyright, he can secure the property of this British edition for Emerson and himself;&#x2014;but the poor man does not know how to proceed; and the Attornies whom he consults shed on the operation only darkness visible. He has heard that Serg<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Talfourd is the oracle on all such matters;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Noon Talfourd (<date when="1795-00-00">1795</date>&#x2013;<date when="1854-00-00">1854</date>; <ref target="volume-18/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/26951"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), sergeant-at-law, dramatist (see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18321119-TC-JSM-01"><sic>6:262</sic><corr>TC to JSM, <date when="1832-11-19">19 Nov. 1832</date></corr></ref>), and authority on copyright (see <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390227-TC-JF-01"><sic>11:34</sic><corr>TC to JF, <date when="1839-02-27">27 Feb. 1839</date></corr></ref>), lived at 56 Russell Sq., with chambers at 3 Serjeants&#x2019; Inn, Chancery Lane.</note> and in his despair this poor Chapman wishes me to go and ask the learned Serg<hi rend="italic">t</hi> direct. For Emerson&#x2019;s sake I will cheerfully do it, if it be feasible;&#x2014;and it is upon this latter point that I now write to consult you.</p>
<p>First of all, is the learned Serjeant at home, and what is his address? Secondly under what condition can I with propriety go to him on such an errand; or can I with propriety go at all?</p>
<p>If affirmation be the result of your thoughts on this matter, then perhaps I might dun you farther to appoint me an hour with the learned gentleman,&#x2014;any hour of any day.</p>
<p>I was not in quest of this the other day when I called, but in quest of you.&#x2014; <closer><salute>In great haste</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>As this Proof<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of Emerson&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Essays, Second Series</hi>.</note> is again altogether correct or nearly altogether, I think we may adopt the method you suggest: pray let me have the Perfect Copy (as the Printers call it) of the successive sheets, beginning with the first; and&#x2014;your own vigilance continuing unabated,&#x2014;that shall suffice.</p>
<p>I have some acquaintance with Serg<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Talfourd; but was never at his house, nor ever had him here; farther I am uncertain whether he&#x2019;s at present in town. However, I have now written to an acquaintance we have in common for light as to the matter;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-18/lt-18441004-TC-JF-01">TC to JF, <date when="1844-10-04">4 Oct.</date></ref></note> and if I find any feasibility, will certainly call upon him for Emerson&#x2019;s sake: at all events I will, as soon as there is any conclusion either way, punctually let you know.</p>

<salute>Dearest Babbie</salute>
<p>It is really time that you had a letter now&#x2014;and a good one&#x2014; You have earned it during the last week&#x2014;but people do not always get their deserts in this world&#x2014;which on the whole, is perhaps a <hi rend="italic">mercy</hi> for them&#x2014;so do not <hi rend="italic">you</hi> be out of humour that you are not luckier than your neighbours&#x2014;no good letter <hi rend="italic">can</hi> come out of me this day&#x2014; I cannot even predict when there is a chance of one&#x2014; Tomorrow however is Sunday and a line you must have now&#x2014;to keep my own conscience from growing desperate, to say nothing of <hi rend="italic">your <foreign>coeur sensible</foreign></hi> [tender heart].</p>
<p>The last three days have been taken up with M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Paulet&#x2014;she and her husband and her daughter Julia, transformed by means of an improvised bonnet, into the strangest little <hi rend="italic">woman,</hi> &#x201C;came in upon me quite promiscuously&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech.</note> on Wednesday morning as I was sitting with the pen in my hand in meditation to write&#x2014; That day they &#x201C;had ordered their dinner at the Inn&#x201D;&#x2014;so they prefered engaging for the next day&#x2014;which also answered better for Helen&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">washing</hi> and my <hi rend="italic">headach</hi>. But they staid the forenoon&#x2014; Of course with the little man and the little girl&#x2014;I could get small good of <hi rend="italic">her</hi>&#x2014;so that the first visit passed off ineffectually enough Next day however she came alone soon in the morning having left the girl Julia at the Inn (!) to amuse herself as she could&#x2014;while Paulet looked after his business&#x2014;they would come in time for dinner at five which they did&#x2014; She saw that day Mazzini, old Sterling, Bishop Terrot and Count Krasinski&#x2014;so that she had pretty good luck&#x2014; Mazzini seemed to please her greatly&#x2014;&#x201C;quite another sort of man from what Geraldine had represented him&#x201D;&#x2014; What <hi rend="italic">he</hi> thought of <hi rend="italic">her</hi>, I have not yet heard&#x2014; I fancy he liked her because he <hi rend="italic">talked</hi> to her a great deal and on the subject of <hi rend="small-caps">Love</hi> of all things!&#x2014;the subject however, it must be owned, was of her own selection<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mazzini had given Elizabeth Paulet a letter of intro. to George Sand, <date when="1844-09-20">20 Sept.</date>, at the request of JWC (&#x201C;the woman I value the most in England&#x201D;): &#x201C;Mrs Pawlet &#x2026; belongs to a small number of sympathetic souls in England who understand and love you. &#x2026; It is no idle curiosity that brings her to see you, but a sincere desire to hear you, to tell you how much she admires you, to commune with you as much as her short stay in Paris permits&#x201D; (S<hi rend="italic">critti</hi> 27:26, trans.). Jewsbury had written JWC, <date when="1844-09-29">17 [29?] Sept.</date>, that Mrs. Paulet &#x201C;will be so pleased with that introduction &#x2026; for &#x2026; she will go now properly accredited &#x2026; . It will only be for half an hour, and the pleasure &#x2026; will last for life; so, on the whole, you may set it down as one of the best good deeds you ever did&#x2014;quite a &#x2018;Sunday best.&#x201D;&#x2019;</note>&#x2014; The following <pb id="pg-18-231" n="18:231"/>day she came again and I went up to town with her and wandered about till I was sick and sore&#x2014;</p>
<p>I wonder that when people go to travel they do not restrict their <hi rend="italic">programme</hi> to so much as they have ample cash to transact in a comfortable way better to take in <hi rend="italic">half</hi> the sights and see them with unfatigued eyes&#x2014; It is well enough for <hi rend="italic">me</hi> to pop about in omnibuses but the Macgregors&#x2014;the Paulets and so many well off people should really get themselves a carriage for the time of their stay&#x2014;or at lowest indulge in hackey&#x2014;coaches&#x2014; They saw nothing of London but what they could manage with omnibuses and their legs&#x2014;desperately little&#x2014; and then they were eternally getting into <hi rend="italic">wrong</hi> omnibuses and losing themselves and wasting hours of their time in finding themselves again&#x2014; Heigh ho!&#x2014; I wish I <hi rend="italic">were</hi> with you at Auchtertool I am so&#x2014;sleepy! I <hi rend="italic">have</hi> had two letters from Plattnauer since his departure&#x2014; The first highly satisfactory the second more flighty and ominous&#x2014; Oh that Count of Reichenbach if he would but hasten to him!&#x2014; I have not yet told you the circumstances of his departure&#x2014;well I must take another day for it&#x2014; I am not <hi rend="italic">up to narration</hi> at present&#x2014;Love to Walter and Maggie&#x2014; <closer><salute>Bless you my Babbie</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dearest Helen</salute>
<p>I swear to you I am almost quite sick of being alive&#x2014;it is such a perpetual strain upon the spirits!</p>
<p>Whether one be cleaning houses for ungrateful men, or talking one-self hoarse to exacting visitors, or wasting one&#x2019;s sweetness on the desert air!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard&#x201D; 56.</note> all is weariness and vexation of spirit!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Eccles. 1:14.</note> I really wish I were&#x2014;not &#x201C;where Helen lies&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The ballad &#x201C;Helen of Kirkconnell.&#x201D;</note>&#x2014;but with these other little wretches at Auchertool<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Maggie and Jeannie Welsh.</note>&#x2014;out of sight and out of mind&#x2014;&#x201C;<hi rend="italic">well let alone</hi>&#x201D; (as W. Grahame of Burnswark used to recommend that the fire should be)&#x2014; That wish however has no sense in it&#x2014;so far as regards Auchertool&#x2014;even there, in that remote region people have to make calls and eat dinners it seems&#x2014;and if one <hi rend="italic">must</hi> be sold off for the benefit of &#x201C;others&#x201D; as well be it in <pb id="pg-18-232" n="18:232"/>the Capital wholesale and at full cost&#x2014;as <hi rend="italic">by retail</hi> in the Provinces for an old song!&#x2014; &#x201C;Than<hi rend="italic">ks</hi> God&#x201D; however there has been no new tragedy in my life since I wrote to you&#x2014;only excessive worry and hurry&#x2014;in the midst of this&#x2014;rendered more <hi rend="italic">wearing</hi> by a long spell of sleeplessness there walked in on Wednesday morning last M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Paulet with her husband and daughter&#x2014;they staid three days in London and good part of the time <hi rend="italic">she</hi> passed with me&#x2014; I wished I had been in better trim for her&#x2014;but such as I was I still got good of her sunny looks and stirring words&#x2014;</p>
<p>She saw here Mazzini much to her contentment&#x2014;and I think also to <hi rend="italic">his</hi>&#x2014; I have not seen him since to hear all he thought of her but I am sure he <hi rend="italic">liked</hi> her by this token&#x2014;that he talked to her a good deal instead of sitting staring at her with his great black eyes&#x2014;the only notice which he usually bestows on <hi rend="italic">new people</hi>. Nay, heaven knows how, they fell within the first ten minutes into an animated discussion on <hi rend="italic">Love</hi>&#x2014;of all topics! I taking a trifling part, according to ability&#x2014; I am not aware that any <hi rend="italic">new</hi> light was thrown by any of us on this interesting subject&#x2014;tho many pertinent observations were made&#x2014;as for example this of Mazzini &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Woman</hi> is always desiring <hi rend="italic">to be loved,</hi> Man rather <hi rend="italic">to love</hi>&#x201D;&#x2014;if so one can but admit that <hi rend="italic">Man</hi> has chosen the better part, &#x201C;upon my honour&#x201D;&#x2014; She saw also Old Sterling Bishop Terrot and the Count Krasinski&#x2014;all of whom I must candidly confessed seemed rather <hi rend="italic">startled</hi> than <hi rend="italic">charmed</hi> with the beautiful Phenomenon&#x2014; Old Sterling indeed passed the subsequent night as he afterwards informed me in questioning himself &#x201C;how it was that being indisputably pretty, witty, good humoured, and gracious, <hi rend="italic">one</hi> nevertheless <hi rend="italic">could not</hi> fall in love with her&#x201D;? the reason I should have fancied plain enough&#x2014;without need of the <hi rend="italic">clairvoyance</hi> of a sleepless night&#x2014;and to lie simply in <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;ones&#x201D;</hi> seventy four years of age!&#x2014;with the additional fact that having just lost by death the noblest of sons <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;one&#x201D;</hi> might have had something else to think of than falling in love with other mens wives&#x2014;but he flattered himself to have found a more comfortable solution of the <foreign><hi rend="italic">grande mistero</hi></foreign> [great mystery] and what think you it was?&#x2014;&#x201C;her face was <hi rend="italic">too exclusively intellectual</hi>&#x201D;!! Oh the thrice grained Goose! As if any <hi rend="italic">woman&#x2019;s</hi> face was ever too <hi rend="italic">exclusively intellectual</hi> and as if M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Paulets particular face had not&#x2014;what shall I say?&#x2014;decidedly a dash of the improper&#x2014;very lovable &#x2018;improper&#x2019; I admit&#x2014;but still something that would bid a man who loved her&#x2014;in spite of the glaring fact of a <hi rend="italic">M</hi>r Paulet&#x2014;not utterly despair&#x2014;provided he were a man after her own heart&#x2014; which being not easy to find&#x2014;poor M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Paulet make<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS; for &#x201C;may&#x201D;?</note> keep <hi rend="italic">himself</hi> easy. <pb id="pg-18-233" n="18:233"/>Darwin is come back missed her by half an hour which was a pity&#x2014;one likes a person one likes to know the people one likes&#x2014;till that is the case there is always a certain extraneousness about them the <hi rend="italic">new</hi> friend I mean&#x2014;</p>
<p>By the way&#x2014;or rather by the direct&#x2014;M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Paulet seems to have a real hearty regard for <hi rend="italic">you</hi>&#x2014;Babbie also she likes&#x2014;but <hi rend="italic">you</hi> I think suit her best&#x2014; Babbie&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">stillness</hi> has indeed no affinity with her animated manner of being and she admires her accordingly as one admires &#x201C;the sleeping beauty&#x201D; of the fairy tale&#x2014; I tell you this not as a mere insipid piece of compliment&#x2014;but as a practical hint&#x2014;one can always get on better with people when we have&#x2014;a clear notion how they feel towards <hi rend="italic">us</hi>&#x2014; And now tho&#x2019; late thanks for your speedy and amusing letter&#x2014;another will be gratefully received</p>

<p>Will you remember me kindly to the Martins&#x2014;poor Mrs Martin does not seem in a flourishing way&#x2014;it is hard that her health should fail just when her worldly affairs begin to look promising about her&#x2014; without health there is no power of <hi rend="italic">enjoying joy</hi></p>

<p>I am sending you two men; this time, with no view to <hi rend="italic">your</hi> matrimonial interests, both being already provided with wives better or <pb id="pg-18-234" n="18:234"/>worse; but chiefly with a view to <hi rend="italic">their</hi> intellectual interests.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I have no time to write today; but I must acknowledge your Letter, which was very welcome to me; and say a word to satisfy our Mother that all is well with us here.</p>
<p>I have been a little busier of late, tho&#x2019; I still need constant spurring of myself to stand up to this ugly toil. I have got the greater part of Cromwell&#x2019;s Letters put on paper; the commentary of one often costs me a long week of rummaging: I have the Speeches still to do.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC wrote in his Journal, <date when="1844-10-01">1 Oct.</date>: &#x201C;Amid innumerable confusion I am struggling to get to work again; to resume my <hi rend="italic">Cromwell,</hi>&#x2014;and find it hitherto as good as impossible. But it is nevertheless the only remedy; and I must persist, persist, till I succeed.&#x2014;&#x201D; This was the last entry until <date when="1847-12-13">13 Dec. [1847]</date>.</note> My notion at present is to send out that as a Book before long, let what <hi rend="italic">will</hi> follow.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The final decision to make <hi rend="italic">Oliver Cromwell&#x2019;s Letters and Speeches, with Elucidations</hi> a separate and independent book was not taken until early <date when="1845-00-00">1845</date> (see <ref target="volume-18/lt-18450208-TC-EF-01">TC to EF, <date when="1845-02-08">8 Feb. 1845</date></ref>, Terhune, <hi rend="italic">LEF</hi> 1:483). Espinasse says that Chapman &#x26; Hall, according to JWC, &#x201C;if I understood her rightly,&#x201D; undertook publication &#x201C;with considerable reluctance, and only on the understanding that he would give them afterwards a complete biography of Cromwell&#x201D; (74), which may well be true though without documentary confirmation. After that, once TC wrote an intro. and his &#x201C;elucidations&#x201D; with increasing elaboration, there was no place for a separate life. He did what he wanted and gave a new interpretation of Cromwell; in fact, he even let this override his need to make a complete and thorough edn., which left him with an annoying problem of extensive additions and revisions with the second and third edns. of <hi rend="italic">Cromwell;</hi> for all which see later vols.</note> I am also in real treaty about hiring a Copyist for six months! Nickisson is aiding me towards one who he thinks will suit. I find I ought to have that Ms. of D&#x2019;Ewes; I think of making a preliminary volume from it too.&#x2014; Yesterday I was at the Museum, seeking out the truth of a Statement by Whitlocke about &#x2018;Captain Cromwell,&#x2019; Harrison&#x2019;s Captain, being killed at Appleby; the Ass Noble is clear that this was Oliver&#x2019;s son Oliver, or Philip:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Bulstrode Whitelocke, <hi rend="italic">Memorials of the English Affairs</hi> 318. Mark Noble, <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of the Protectorate-House of Cromwell</hi> 1:165&#x2013;66. Thomas Harrison (<date when="1606-00-00">1606</date>&#x2013;<date when="1660-00-00">60</date>), parliamentary army officer and regicide; see <ref target="volume-15/lt-18420918-TC-TCNBN-01"><sic>15:92</sic><corr>TC to TCNBN, <date when="1842-09-18">18 Sept. 1842</date></corr></ref>. Harrison was wounded at Appleby, in Westmoreland, <date when="1648-07-00">July 1648</date>. Oliver Cromwell (<date when="1623-00-00">1623</date>&#x2013;<date when="1644-00-00">44</date>), the Protector&#x2019;s second child, died of smallpox while serving in the army at Newport Pagnell, Bucks., as discovered much later. Philip is presumably the Protector&#x2019;s cousin Philip Cromwell (<date when="1605-00-00">1605</date>&#x2013;<date when="1645-00-00">45</date>), who died from wounds received when storming Bristol. FC f. 144r. shows from TC&#x2019;s brief notes, &#x201C;AT THE MUSEUM,&#x201D; that he found something in the King&#x2019;s Pamphlets&#x2019; Indexes &#x201C;Of Oliver&#x2019;s son that was killed with Harrison while in pursuit of Hamilton in &#x2019;<date when="1648-00-00">48</date>. &#x2026; Appears <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to be true.&#x201D;</note> I discovered that Captain Cromwell was not killed at all, but only <hi rend="italic">his</hi> lieutenant there! And so <pb id="pg-18-237" n="18:237"/>the whole matter is at sea again, and mere darkness visible!&#x2014; One of the chief necessities is to know where to <hi rend="italic">stop</hi> in such cases, and say, It is enough, it shall be enough.</p>
<p>Alfred Tennyson came to us the other day about 2; staid till near 11 at night: good company; but I got an ugly headache by the job, and still have it.&#x2014; We had seen the Paulets of Seaforth, on their return home from France, about a week ago; rather wearisome he; very bright and agreeable she. The Bullers and Barings are away towards Nice; Jane heard from B&#xF6;lte the other day from Chalons sur Soane; there was to be a general rendezvous of the scattered fragments at Lyon. Thomas Erskine and his Sister are likewise gone in that direction; intending for Rome.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Christian Stirling, b.

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I hope you have accumulated a sufficient stock of patience, within the last year during which I have let you lie fallow, to admit of my again coming in upon with some of my Scotch difficulties. I am upon Gilderoy the Robber<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Famous cattle thief, subject of several ballads; hanged in Edinburgh, <date when="1636-07-00">July 1636</date>; see also <ref target="volume-18/lt-18441028-TC-GLC-01">TC to GLC, <date when="1844-10-28">28 Oct.</date></ref></note> today; at least it is he that ultimately brings me to the point of writing to you.</p>
<p>Chambers in his <hi rend="italic">Scotch Songs &#x26; Ballads</hi> informs me very vaguely that &#x2018;Gilderoy was hanged on the Gallow tree between Leith and Edinburgh in the year <date when="1638-00-00">1638</date>.&#x2019;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Chambers, <hi rend="italic">The Scottish Songs</hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1829-00-00">1829</date>) 1:93.</note> I know Chambers&#x2019;s way in such cases; and, of course, can only use him as a Note of Interrogation. Gilderoy is mentioned twice or thrice in <hi rend="italic">Spalding;</hi> the places (in the <hi rend="italic">old</hi> edition of Spalding) are pp. 49, 98, 71 of Vol I: but there is no account of his death there: in the Bannatyne-Club <hi rend="italic">Spalding</hi> there may possibly be a Note about him at one of those passages,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; the work did not seem to be rich in elucidations when I looked at it.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Spalding, <hi rend="italic">History of the Troubles and Memorable Transactions in Scotland, from the Year <date when="1624-00-00">1624</date> to <date when="1645-00-00">1645</date></hi>, 2 vols.

(Edinburgh, <date when="1848-00-00">1848</date>).</note> or such like, may have an express Chapter upon him; in which case all will be right here, if you name it to me. One way or other I have got an image of this &#x2018;winsome Gilderoy&#x2019; with roses to his shoon and long garters,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. st. 1 and the last line of &#x201C;Gilderoy.&#x201D;</note> poor fellow, dangling somewhere on the gallows in those years; and would gladly know when it was, and where, and how,&#x2014;or know at least that all this was unknowable. By Spalding he does <hi rend="italic">not</hi> seem to have died in <date when="1638-00-00">&#x2019;38</date>, but to have been already dead then. &#x2018;John <pb id="pg-18-239" n="18:239"/>Dugar&#x2019;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >An outlaw who attacked the Forbeses&#x2019; part of Aberdeenshire, <date when="1638-00-00">1638</date>, as he blamed that family for Gilderoy&#x2019;s death (1:49, 98).</note> and other &#x2018;<foreign>lymmars</foreign> [rogues]&#x2019; are connected with him, and have reminiscences about him.</p>
<p>Another inquiry, since my hand is in, I may make of you. In <hi rend="italic">Thurloe&#x2019;s State Papers</hi> I. 101, there is a Letter of Oliver Cromwell, wherein he speaks of the &#x2018;Laird of Gramhead&#x2019;: I have no doubt this means <hi rend="italic">Greenhead</hi>, &#x2018;Sir W. Ker of Greenhead,&#x2019; concerning whom you teach me in <hi rend="italic">Baillie</hi>. Do you know anything farther concerning this Laird of Greenhead than what Baillie has;&#x2014;and was the &#x2018;Sir W. Ker Director of Chancery&#x2019; a different person from this Laird?<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Thurloe, <hi rend="italic">A Collection of the State Papers &#x2026; from the Year <date when="1638-00-00">1638</date> to the Restoration</hi>, ed. T. Birch, 7 vols. (<date when="1742-00-00">1742</date>). TC changes &#x201C;Gramhead&#x201D; to &#x201C;Greenhead&#x201D; in <hi rend="italic">Cromwell (Works</hi> 6:371). He is referred to in <hi rend="italic">Letters and Journals of Baillie</hi> as Greenhead (3:327) and indexed as Sir William Ker of Greenhead, although he was apparently Sir Andrew Ker of Greenhead (see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 6:374, 378). The other Ker was Sir William Ker of Halden (b. <date when="1638-00-00">1638</date>), 2d son of the 1st earl of Lothian, director of chancery in Scotland, <date when="1661-00-00">1661</date>.</note> He is not worth much search; but if you know, pray tell me. I am gathering all Oliver&#x2019;s Letters, and adding such commentary as may make them intelligible. They are uniformly full of sense, verity and manfulness, when one does understand them.</p>

<p>I have very lately got for myself, after many readings, questionings and attemptings, some kind of intelligible notion of the Battle of Dunbar; Oliver, I find, drove the Scotch right-wing pellmell upon the body of the Army which, hemmed in by the Doun Hill and Brox Burn, had not room to manoeuvre, and so was reduced by its own cavalry and their pursuers to &#x2018;immortal smash.&#x2019;<note n="15" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <hi rend="italic">Cromwell, Works</hi> 7:200&#x2013;8.</note>&#x2014; I find farther that there <hi rend="italic">is</hi> some <pb id="pg-18-241" n="18:241"/>feeble bandying of accusations between Lesly and the Clergy (Parliament Committee, I suppose it was, of Lords and Clergy; Jeffray the Quaker in it, and Waugh and Carstairs),&#x2014;as if <hi rend="italic">they</hi> had urged him to come down and fight.<note n="16" place="bottom" type="gloss" >David Leslie (d. <date when="1682-00-00">1682</date>), 1st Baron Newark.

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Here is a Letter just arrived which will be very welcome to you; I send it off without a moment&#x2019;s delay, after we have both read it. Our good Alick seems to be well, with all his Household; digging his Potatoes, on the other side of the Ocean, and sowing his winter corn, as we are doing on our side. Let us be very thankful that we get such good news from him.</p>
<p>I did not know, till I saw in this Letter, that you had sent him &#xa3;10 out of your poor Purse,&#x2014;my dear generous Mother! I suppose it would do yourself good withal; and so we must not complain of it; we ought rather to rejoice at it: &#x201C;a cheerful giver&#x201D; is <hi rend="italic">loved</hi> in High Quarters;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See 2 Cor. 9:7.</note> and a generous Mother&#x2019;s-heart is beautiful to see, whether it give away pounds or kingdoms!&#x2014;</p>
<p><pb id="pg-18-242" n="18:242"/>Jack had a very hasty Letter from me on Saturday afternoon:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1844-10-12">12 Oct.</date></note> I have gone thro&#x2019; nothing new since that;&#x2014;busy always at the old labour; the more mechanical part of which is well forward in this quarter of it. If ever I get you these Letters of Cromwell printed, you will be delighted to read them: a man who in all his ways acknowledges the Great Creator and Sender of him; looking to do His will here on Earth as the first and last of all objects. It is beautiful to see,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; the like is all but totally forgotten now among men like him, and indeed among all kinds of men. I seem to myself as if working towards a good object, in trying to make such a man memorable and credible once more among my fellow-creatures.&#x2014;</p>
<p>We have terribly wet weather these three days after long-continued dry: &#x201C;long fair, long foul&#x201D; is the proverb,&#x2014;but we are seldom oppressed with wet in this country, and far oftener suffer from drought and the dirt it is sure to bring with it,&#x2014;the very <hi rend="italic">air</hi> at last getting full of dirt.&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; My own health keeps very tolerable, better, I might say, than usual: but poor Jane, since the wet began, has got a &#x201C;stiff neck,&#x201D; kind of rheumatism in the back of the head which entirely lames her: she thinks she is a little better today and yesterday, but I do not expect she will be free for a few days yet. It will therefore be impossible for me to send off my Package of old Duds for Annandale this week yet; that important adventure must be delayed a little longer!</p>
<p>We hope Jamie is getting into his Potatoes by this time, having got the stockyard nearly regulated. I wish we heard some news of the Lease of Scotsbrig. He will of course be somewhat anxious, till he see clearly what is to become of him in that respect; there or elsewhere some reasonable up-putting for a reasonable man is still discoverable. Courage!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I send you a Note I had today from a Berkshire Member of Parliament, whom Jack knows about.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Philip Pusey (<date when="1799-00-00">1799</date>&#x2013;<date when="1855-00-00">1855</date>; <ref target="volume-18/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/22911"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>; see <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390311-TC-JAC-01"><sic>11:46</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1839-03-11">11 March 1839</date></corr></ref>), agriculturalist, M.P. for Berkshire, and elder brother of E. B. Pusey, wrote to TC, <date when="1844-10-14">14 Oct.</date>: &#x201C;Though I have not given up cornlawing, I have just renounced the vice of preserving partridges having been a great sinner in that way: but I have transferred the offence to my tenants with the condition however that there are to be no prosecutions for poaching, so that I have read you to some profit.&#x201D; He also saw &#x201C;a general agreement in the tendencies of your respective action&#x201D; between his brother, who admired Laud, and TC with his work on Cromwell; &#x201C;one main difference however being that you fix your attention more on the creative minds which spring up from time to time, while he looks to the framework in which such conditions are handed down.&#x201D; He wanted TC to visit him about Christmas at the same time as the Bunsens.</note> The <hi rend="italic">first</hi> man, I suppose in England, who has <hi rend="italic">abolished</hi> the preserving of Game! An old gentleman to whom I was reporting it this afternoon said almost with tears: &#x201C;May the Almighty <pb id="pg-18-243" n="18:243"/>bless him!&#x201D; This Pusey is elder Brother to the Clergyman Pusey, of whom as head of the Puseyites you hear so much.</p>
<p>Will you tell the Doctor to write for Jamie a set of Addresses to John Carlyle, Brantford &#x26;c or to Alick, whichever is judged the suitabler&#x2014;write them on slips of paper fit for wrapping up Newspapers in; and then by the aid of two wafers weekly, Jamie may easily do kind thing<supplied>[s]</supplied> to one of his Brothers: the Newspaper, old <hi rend="italic">Herald</hi><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Dumfries Herald.</hi> Letter omitted in &#x201C;thing<supplied>[s]</supplied>.&#x201D;</note> or any Newspaper, needs only to be thrown into the Post-Office, and it will go, free of charge to any one. Or perhaps Jamie would rather undertake to send the Address in his own hand? That of course would be still welcomer, as a sign of good tidings direct from Annandale.&#x2014; I wish the Doctor would write to Alick this time; I am so very busy.</p>
<p>I send another Note* here, of some kind of Invitation to be a Steward at a great Scotch Dinner, with which I am totally unacquainted; I understand only that it is meant as a bit of honour done me: but I think it will not suit.&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; I have a Letter too from Emerson tonight, who has sent me &#xa3;30 of American Book-produce: this also I may as well inclose; Jack will return it to me.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson&#x2019;s letter, dated <date when="1844-09-30">30 Sept.</date>, enclosed a bill of exchange for &#xa3;30 representing &#x24;150 from Little &#x26; Brown and from James Munroe &#x26; Co.</note></p>
<p>And now, dear Mother, I must see if I can catch a dry half hour, to stride out under cloud of night for a little walking, of which in the day time I have had decidedly too little. I will bid you all a right good night; and hope to hear good news from you before long. Keep out of the way of this wild weather, and take all care of yourself, dear Mother. <closer><salute>My blessing with you all.</salute></closer></p>
<closer><salute>Your affectionate /</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name>
<ps><p>*I find there is not admittance for that without an additional 2 pence,&#x2014;so we will let it wait; the <hi rend="italic">worth</hi> of it not being above a farthing (at highest)!</p></ps>

<salute>Dearest Helen</salute>
<p>This being the first hour in which I have been able to hold myself erect for the last five days, I should hardly have carried the enthusiasm <pb id="pg-18-244" n="18:244"/>for corresponding to such a pitch as to have employed it in answering your letter <hi rend="italic">by return of post</hi>. Only that I never like to put off where <hi rend="italic">business</hi> is concerned especially when any one&#x2019;s business is <hi rend="italic">waiting</hi>. So that I hasten to tell you I see absolutely no chance I have at present of being able to forward Isabella&#x2019;s<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> views&#x2014; There is hardly a family I am acquainted with now in London&#x2014; I know of nobody going abroad&#x2014;of nobody that is wanting a governess even here in England unless Mrs Macready be still on on the outlook, and <hi rend="italic">she</hi> requires such a thorough knowledge of so many different languages; that it were idle to propose to her an Englishwoman who had never lived in foreign parts As she gives a hundred a year of salary she has a right to first rate accomplishment&#x2014; I shall keep my ears open, indeed I have been doing so ever since Jeanie first told me of Isabella&#x2019;s having to leave her present situation, and if I hear of any thing likely to suit her, you may depend on my putting all my energies into action on her behalf&#x2014;for I think her a very true and thoroughgoing person&#x2014;besides that she is <hi rend="italic">your</hi> friend&#x2014;just now however I am bound to declare at once, that I have not the smallest ability to do her a service which were a service to myself at the same time as it would be a real pleasure to me could I by any amount of running and writing and talking have promoted her interests. Neither do I know of any governess just now adapted to the wants of M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Clay<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> Miss Bolte might have suited if belief in the &#x201C;first chapters of Genesis&#x201D; could be dispensed with: but Miss Bolte is gone to Italy with the Bullers&#x2014;where she is performing the functions of <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Interpreter</hi> rather than those she bargained for&#x2014;of <hi rend="italic">Governess</hi>&#x2014; The Child Theresa<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Revis.</note> will probably run off with some mustachioed count before long&#x2014;and so wash their hands of her altogether&#x2014;the premature Genius for <hi rend="italic">flirtation</hi> which has developed itself in her being from all accounts something <hi rend="italic">tremendous!</hi></p>

<p>I have had a <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;crisis&#x201D;</hi>&#x2014;not such as the Italian exiles are liable to, which means neither more nor less than what we term in the Scotch dialect &#x201C;cleanness of teeth&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably &#x201C;hunger&#x201D;; see Amos 4:6</note>&#x2014;but a bilious crisis&#x2014;<foreign><hi rend="italic">dans sa plus simple expression</hi></foreign> [most simply]&#x2014;<foreign>viz!</foreign> violent rheumatism in the head and neck&#x2014; For five mortal days had I to lie on the flat of my back, incapable of turning this way or that except with my eyes! a spectacle of &#x201C;heart-rending interest&#x201D; to all beholders&#x2014;for I <hi rend="italic">would</hi> be beheld&#x2014;<foreign>moi!</foreign> would lie on the sofa rather than in my bed&#x2014;that red bed is such a horrid sojurn for me in the day time!&#x2014;so associated with &#x201C;all things most <hi rend="italic">un</hi>pleasant in life!.

<p>Meanwhile Darwin let &#x201C;a piece of iron heavy and sharp&#x201D; fall upon his foot&#x2014;and will have to &#x201C;lose a nail&#x201D;&#x2014;and was without hope of getting a boot on for two months&#x2014;but he was here yesterday in <hi rend="italic">a sandal</hi>&#x2014;or rather to speak without flattery with his <hi rend="italic">foot</hi> in a black silk handkerchief neatly tied round with ribbons.

The Pepolis are returned to Felsina Cottage<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Pepolis&#x2019; home in London.

I have seen her just once and that only two days ago, she having been <hi rend="italic">doing</hi> a cold while I was laid up with my neck.

Pepoli she also says &#x201C;enjoyed himself very tolerably&#x201D;&#x2014; But I take his own postscript in a letter of <hi rend="italic">Elizabeths</hi> to Plattnauer as a more truthful picture of his feelings&#x2014; After praising &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Scotzia Melanconica</hi></foreign> [Scottish Melancholy]&#x201D; he adds: &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">fa freddo</hi></foreign> [it is cold]&#x201D; and that was in the heat of summer mind you.</p>
<p>I have this morning a fourth letter from Plattnauer for which I was very thankful to pay <hi rend="italic">one and threepence</hi>&#x2014;as he had this time exceeded the appointed week by several days I was beginning to get very anxious&#x2014;it is a very long letter&#x2014;perfectly sane if it were not for that perputal <hi rend="italic">hurry</hi> and <hi rend="italic">struggle</hi>&#x2014;forwards&#x2014;to he knows not what&#x2014;which seems never to leave him in peace for an hour&#x2014; I will send you the letter for sample of his state of mind but not today&#x2014;till I have first shown it to Miss Clayton<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Plattnauer&#x2019;s landlady.</note> From what he says I utterly despair of his family making any active exertions on his behalf&#x2014; What <hi rend="italic">is</hi> to be done for him if he return to England as he left it?&#x2014; But sufficient for the day is the evil thereof<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf.

<salute>Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I have had your two Notes, and have since written a line to poor Mary,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Austin.</note> whom I hope you will soon bring round again. I suppose it to be hard work and exposure to bad weather that have hurt her, poor thing. Hard work is a harsh thing;&#x2014;but no work at all, as I have heard you remark, is far worse!</p>
<p>I meant to have answered you two days ago; but literally could not manage it, so indifferently were my schemes laid! We have had, <pb id="pg-18-248" n="18:248"/>and have, deluges of wet weather and mud here, so that my exercise hours are often interrupted, and other irregularities brought in upon me. Today I take time by the <hi rend="italic">fore</hi>lock.</p>
<p>If Jamie can get Dalton Hook, I shall deem it a very nice thing. Carruthers I have heard described as a man of superior worth;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dalton Hook, a farm &#xBD; mi. N of Dalton, a village 4 mi. W of Ecclefechan, was once owned by Thomas Carruthers, Dormont, Ecclefechan. It was advertised for letting in the <hi rend="italic">Dumfries Courier</hi>, <date when="1844-09-30">30 Sept.</date> James applied for it, <date when="1844-10-06">6 Oct.</date>, but withdrew early in <date when="1844-11-00">Nov.</date>, when his lease at Scotsbrig was renewed after all.</note> that is of itself a great point. If you can help Jamie at all, of course you will. So of course I. Tell him to gather his judgement together, and make a manful offer at the thing: as much as he dare fairly undertake to perform, not more. We might then engage to be surety for his rent for the first year or two,&#x2014;or the like,&#x2014;perhaps with advantage? Whatever Jamie does deliberately decide upon, I shall think it safe and right to back him out in that.</p>
<p>Jane, in spite of the wet weather, has recovered her suppleness of <hi rend="italic">neck;</hi> but of course the damp imprisonment is not very genial for her: however, she holds on wonderfully. A mass of old clothes, bits of Carpet &#x26;c is now actually laid out <hi rend="italic">upon the floor:</hi> and will leave this place for Scotsbrig about Monday at noon: in a week more or so, I suppose it may arrive. So much for that.</p>
<p>On the other hand I am to say that our meal is <hi rend="italic">done</hi> to a fortnight&#x2019;s stock or thereby: so that Jamie can instantly bestir himself! We want him also to buy us, at Dumfries or Annan, a small <hi rend="italic">griddle</hi> (called &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">girdle</hi>&#x201D;) for baking a crum of oatcake! The diameter of it is to be <hi rend="italic">fifteen inches;</hi> more will be superfluous, less not enough. There must also be a <hi rend="italic">bow</hi> (or &#x201C;<foreign>bool</foreign>&#x201D;) of iron for it with a <hi rend="italic">swivel</hi> atop, such as the smiths commonly make for griddles;&#x2014;but it must not be <hi rend="italic">riveted on:</hi> leave it loose for the convenience of packing; we can easily get it riveted here. You understand now about the griddle!&#x2014; For the rest, Jane thinks as our last-years stock of meal has just held out and no more, and <hi rend="italic">cakes</hi> are <hi rend="italic">now</hi> a thing in prospect, two additional stone of meal (or one and a half) would not be amiss. This, I think, was my whole commission. Isabella knows about the Butter. The sooner all these things come, we shall be the merrier.&#x2014; Enough of <hi rend="italic">them</hi>.</p>
<p>I have actually engaged a &#x201C;Secretary&#x201D; since I wrote to you; and have him writing at this moment at the Museum. He is an Aberdeen Scotchman &#x201C;Dr Christie&#x201D; graduate in Medicine; one of the ugliest young men of his day, but full of sense, willingness, energy,&#x2014;and hunger, poor fellow.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Christie, M.D., Aberdeen, came to London, married, and went into partnership with an apothecary, an enterprise that failed. When TC first met him he was living in poverty with his beautiful wife and infant son at 27 Rathbone Pl., Oxford St. David Masson, who had been at Aberdeen grammar school and Marischal College with Christie, introduced him to TC, who had asked whether Masson knew anyone who for a moderate weekly wage would help with research and the copying of MSS in the British Museum. At the time, says Masson, Christie &#x201C;laboured at anatomical drawings for artists and coached artists in anatomy. He was ready&#x2014;the rough, strong-headed fellow&#x2014;for anything by which he could earn an honest living. &#x2026; A note from me to Carlyle, followed by an interview between Carlyle and Christie, settled the matter; and from that day till the conclusion of the &#x2018;Cromwell&#x2019; for the press Christie acted as Carlyle&#x2019;s <foreign><hi rend="italic">factotum</hi></foreign> in the British Museum, his deputy for researchings and copyings, and his personal amanuensis. Carlyle afterwards assured me that he could not have had an abler assistant for such work, or a more trustworthy. Both he and Mrs Carlyle contracted a real regard for Christie, and were very kind to him&#x201D; (D.

<salute>Dear Lady Ashburton,</salute>
<p>Some weeks ago, a vague bad hearsay incidentally came to me, That your hurt was not prospering so well as the Surgeon had at first anticipated. Since then I have heard nothing whatever;&#x2014;having indeed been out of the way of hearing anything; living apart from all extant human creatures; conversing only, in a very sorrowful manner, with those that are past and dead two centuries ago! You will do me a real <pb id="pg-18-250" n="18:250"/>satisfaction if you can assure me that the news are now of a better complexion. Perhaps they were never so bad as the hearsay represented. At all events, I should like to know how you actually are: &#x201C;Time and Patience!&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Time</hi> is running on always; and your energetic Patience, I think, will not fail you!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Our French Travellers are probably near Nice by this time? We hear not a word from any of the parties. My Wife had a Note, several weeks ago, from some of the Bullers, despatched, if I remember, from Chalons-sur-Soane; a general rendezvous at Lyons was shadowed forth there; which we suppose took effect.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Isabella and Charles Buller, with Amalie B&#xF6;lte and Theresa Revis, were to meet the Barings in Lyons; see <ref target="volume-18/lt-18441012-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1844-10-12">12 Oct.</date></ref></note> It is our last hint even for a guess: the rest is all <hi rend="italic">invisibility</hi> and <hi rend="italic">good hope</hi>&#x2014; Our weather is very disagreeable here; many things are disagreeable;&#x2014;nevertheless one has to say in many senses, under all kinds of weather and circumstance, &#x201C;Blessed is he that continueth <hi rend="italic">where he is!</hi>&#x201D; Such blessedness we will anticipate for the brave Lady, next year, and the coming years.</p>
<p>Emerson is publishing a new Volume of Essays; which, I imagine, you will have to read. The Bookseller here sends me the Sheets of the Reprint: I find it a very attractive, yet rather a <hi rend="italic">stiff</hi> kind of reading. The noblest spirit looks thro&#x2019; the man; an Old-Greek spirit in the form of a new and newest New-Englander: but he writes very much into the vague, like a man soliloquizing in unpeopled vacancy; sometimes in a distressingly fantastic manner, really hard even to understand. His little aphoristic enigmatic sentences do not cohere: the paragraph, the Essay generally, is not like a solid ingot of metal but like a well-tied, bag of shot,&#x2014;so many pounds of lead-drops held together by a tight piece of canvas!&#x2014; A much better Book for you, if you have it not already, will be Walpole&#x2019;s last Series of <hi rend="italic">Letters to Horace Mann</hi>.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Letters of Horace Walpole to Sir Horace Mann</hi>, concluding series, 4 vols. (<date when="1843-00-00">1843</date>&#x2013;<date when="1844-00-00">44</date>). Horace Walpole (<date when="1717-00-00">1717</date>&#x2013;<date when="1797-00-00">97</date>), author, gothicist, and voluminous letter writer. Sir Horace Mann (<date when="1701-00-00">1701</date>&#x2013;<date when="1786-00-00">86</date>), British envoy at Florence, corresponded with Walpole, <date when="1741-00-00">1741</date>&#x2013;<date when="1785-00-00">85</date>.</note> They are full of English news, written during and after the American War. Harsh, bitter, withered so far as I have looked; but full of vivacity, pictorial distinctness, and very amusing to read.</p>
<p>Philip Pusey has abolished the Game Laws on his Estate: the Tenants are to preserve the game or shoot it as they please, only to have no prosecutions on the Game Act! It is verily so. A good old Clergyman, to whom I reported the matter, exclaimed almost with tears, &#x201C;May the Almighty bless him!&#x201D;&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>I ought to have stopt long ago; having my whole day&#x2019;s-work still <pb id="pg-18-251" n="18:251"/>before me, and nothing but an emphatic <hi rend="italic">How-are-you</hi> really calling to be written:&#x2014;<closer><salute>and now my Paper stops me.&#x2014; Yours most truly</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Fitzgerald,</salute>
<p>I have sent your Name to the Library:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The London Library.</note> so soon as any Committee-meeting is, your business will be completed, and Cochrane the Librarian will announce fact to you and demand money. You will find it a very real convenience, I do expect, to be admitted freely to such an extent of Book-pasturage. In regard to all but the ephemeral rubbish, which are in great demand, and which you can well dispense with, the access to Books (I believe) is very fair; certainly there are many good Books in the Collection: bad rubbish Books too you can get, French Novels &#x26;c &#x26;c in very great abundance; but you must be on the spot,&#x2014;nay I believe you must even be a Lady,&#x2014;for that. Do not therefore attempt that!&#x2014;</p>

E. Davy Esq: of Ufford, a polite handsome old Gentleman, who had collected over 80 folios of Suffolk History, which he finally bequeathed to the British Museum. He supplied Carlyle (at my request) with all the particulars he wanted about an Election of County Members at Ipswich <date when="1640-00-00">1640</date> and&#x2014;was thanked in print under the name &#x2018;Dryasdust.&#x2019;&#x201D; TC had in fact thanked &#x201C;our Suffolk monitor&#x201D; in a note: &#x201C;D. E. Davy, Esq., of Ufford, in that County, whose learning in Suffolk History is understood to be supreme, and whose obliging disposition we have ourselves experienced&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 29:327). In subsequent notes, however, TC credited certain information to &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Dryasdust Mss</hi>&#x201D; (e.g., 29:327, 329, 330).</note> Pray sound him, from
the distance, and ascertain: I have still a great many Suffolk questions that I could ask him.&#x2014; I am getting a little better with my poor <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> in these days; I really must have done with it, if only to save my own life. It is still very frightful,&#x2014;a dark Golgotha as wide as the World; but here and there it does begin to get luminous, to get alive. Courage! I think it will be the joyfullest feat for me I ever did, when the last tatter of it is fairly shaken off my fingers, and I am free again.</p>
<p>One day we had Alfred Tennyson here; an unforgettable day. He <pb id="pg-18-252" n="18:252"/>stayed with us till late; forgot his stick: we dismissed him with <hi rend="italic">MacPherson&#x2019;s Farewell</hi>.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Burns&#x2019;s version of &#x201C;McPherson&#x2019;s Rant,&#x201D; the ballad and tune supposedly composed by James Macpherson, cattle thief of NE Scotland, before he was hanged at Banff, <date when="1700-00-00">1700</date>.</note> MacPherson (see Burns) was a Highland robber; he played that Tune, of his own composition, on his way to the gallows; asked, &#x201C;If in all that crowd the MacPherson had any clansman?&#x201D; holding up the fiddle that he might bequeath it to some one. &#x201C;Any Kinsman, any soul that wished him well?&#x201D; Nothing answered, nothing durst answer. He crashed the fiddle under his foot, and sprang off. The Tune is rough as hemp, but strong as a lion. I never hear it without something of emotion,&#x2014;poor MacPherson; tho&#x2019; the Artist hates to play it. Alfred&#x2019;s dark face grew darker, and I saw his lips slightly quivering!&#x2014; He said of you that you were a man from whom one could take money; which was a proud saying, which you ought to thank Heaven for.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >This sentence has been crossed out by FitzGerald or someone else. It is just possible to make out what was written. A. Carlyle omits it, and Terhune prints it without mentioning that it was crossed over. TC told C. E. Norton that FitzGerald had given Tennyson &#xa3;300 annually &#x201C;in Tennyson&#x2019;s poor days&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Letters of Charles Eliot Norton</hi>, ed. S. Norton and M. A. D. Howe [Boston, <date when="1913-00-00">1913</date>] 1:465). For a discussion of FitzGerald&#x2019;s possible gifts, and doubts about the accuracy of TC&#x2019;s memory, see Terhune, <hi rend="italic">LEF</hi> 1:459n.</note> It has struck me as a distinctly necessary act of legislature, That Alfred should have a Pension of &#xa3;150 a year. They have &#xa3;1200 every year to give away. A hundred and fifty to Alfred, I say; <hi rend="italic">he</hi> is worth that sum to England!

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I had not time to read your Poem with nearly the attention that it merited;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Lilias Lee.&#x201D;</note> nor indeed could my judgement have been of any essential value to you, inasmuch as the preliminary question, which bars all others till it be answered, would in any case have remained in suspense: Whether, be its character what it might, you could find a Publisher for your Metrical Tale?</p>
<p>I have therefore done what I considered usefuller for you; I have got the Messrs Chapman and Hall to submit the <hi rend="italic">Ms.</hi> to their practical Man of Advice in such subjects; he is actually to examine it, and to send you back some verdict about it, of Yea or No. I urged them above all things to commission him, after having really examined it, to give you some word about it that should be <hi rend="italic">sincere</hi>,&#x2014;his real mind upon it, on surveying it with a practical eye to publication. You will accordingly, thro&#x2019; the Bookseller Menzies, receive some such communication, along with the <hi rend="italic">Ms.</hi> itself; probably one of these very days.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Menzies (<date when="1808-00-00">1808</date>&#x2013;<date when="1879-00-00">79</date>), Edinburgh bookseller; see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18371204-TC-HI-01"><sic>9:355</sic><corr>TC to HI, <date when="1837-12-04">4 Dec. 1837</date></corr></ref>. Chapman &#x26; Hall&#x2019;s advice, <date when="1845-01-07">7 Jan. 1845</date>, was not to publish.</note></p>
<p>If your Poem cannot be published, certainly my distinct advice would be, that you gave it up,&#x2014;proceeded no farther in it; saying to yourself, &#x201C;Well, such is the temper of the time.&#x201D; Indeed, in any case, my notion is, that true victory does not lie for you in that direction. The appetite to write &#x201C;Poetry&#x201D; (meaning Metre, as if there were no <pb id="pg-18-254" n="18:254"/>other <hi rend="italic">Poetry</hi>) is almost universal among young men of genius at present; and the appetite to read it is (not without reason, as I compute) at as low an ebb, as it ever was, with the Public. Booksellers shudder at the very name of it!&#x2014; You could write Scotch Songs, I think, to good purpose, and ever to better, should you persevere; but if my notion be correct, you were wise to go no farther in that direction.</p>
<p><closer><salute>In great haste, and wishing you heartily a wise guidance, which however will have to come from your own general wisdom,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Here is the Proof,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of Emerson&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Essays, Second Series</hi>.</note> altered, I hope in a way to suit you. My own impression is, that you can really get no Copyright; nevertheless I would have you take some steps to make application to the Privy Council, or to do what else <hi rend="italic">seems</hi> to be prescribed in that case,&#x2014;were it only for setting the matter at rest.</p>
<p>Whether Serg<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Talford is come home again or not, I do not know; but most probably he is. I should think your best course (if you reckon him the oracle in the matter) would be to wait upon him, with that Copyright Act in your hand; and consult him as a man of business: What is to be done,&#x2014;if anything: What is the meaning of that Paragraph you found on, if it have any meaning?<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Earlier in <date when="1844-00-00">1844</date> Britain had adopted a new international copyright act (following the abortive act of <date when="1838-00-00">1838</date>) which gave authors of certain foreign countries the same rights in Britain as British authors, if they registered their work in Britain within a year of first publication abroad and if reciprocal protection was given by the country in question to British authors.</note></p>
<p>Probably your stereotype, your cheap price, and the face you shew in the business would deter Pirates if you could get any countenance at all, even the slightest, from that inscrutable Act of legislature.</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Thanks for your kind Note, which we had today. We shall be very glad to see you here again; so soon as you are all ready let a signal warn us.&#x2014; Perhaps you will stay a day or two at Liverpool; with the Chorleys, the Paulets &#x26;c &#x26;c? Miss Jeannie is in Fife with her Brother, which ought to be a kind of grief! What the Chorleys are doing I know not. The Paulet are at home I believe; she as bright and cheery as ever, he in the same old <hi rend="italic">mouse-eaten</hi> condition,&#x2014;like a man nibbled by mice; and very inarticulate in his finishings every way,&#x2014;but good too! Geraldine&#x2019;s Novel is actually at press: I am told great things about the spirit, the &#x26;c &#x26;c&#x2014;but have declined looking at it hitherto.&#x2014; &#x2014; A wonderful affair of Birkenhead Docks, enough in the eyes of the Liverpool people to shake the Earth&#x2019;s axis out of joint, has been going on in that quarter.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The new docks at the town of Birkenhead, on the opposite bank of the Mersey, were set up in rivalry with Liverpool, and a festival was held to celebrate the laying of a foundation stone, <date when="1844-10-23">23 Oct.</date>, although docks, warehouses, market, and town hall were said to have been nearly finished. Liverpudlians also joined in the celebration. See the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, <date when="1844-10-25">25 Oct.</date></note> I declined attending their &#x201C;Festival&#x201D;; and some blockhead, imagining I must be dying of regret and curiosity, shoots off at me in succession either four or five monstrous newspapers treating of it (I sent you a fresh one today), of which I seldom read one syllable. Another huge <foreign>Wen</foreign> of Mammonism:&#x2014;I know several things more beautiful than it that have not so many bumpkins to fling up their caps about them!</p>
<p>You will hardly know the King&#x2019;s Road when you come back to us,&#x2014; for we too are growing like a <foreign>Wen</foreign>. So many new houses have sprung up since you went, and are all full of shopkeepers, of Ladies&#x2019; worsted-work &#x26;c &#x26;c,&#x2014;and look quite sedate, as if already come to the years of discretion! What is far better than all, we have got a flag pavement, very nearly complete now, all the way from Sloane Square, which <hi rend="italic">is</hi> an improvement for us.</p>
<p>On Tuesday the Package of Duds went off to Pickford&#x2019;s:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The largest moving company in Britain.</note> I suppose it is in Liverpool before now; getting across the Solway perhaps at this very time. I am not sure but the Address was to <hi rend="italic">Jamie</hi> (for it was written in great haste); however the Package itself was meant for my Mother to Jamie&#x2019;s care. She will keep what is of any use to herself in the cargo,&#x2014;and divide the rest equitably, or as she sees good: it will <pb id="pg-18-256" n="18:256"/>be a mighty enterprise. Only I think there is a <hi rend="italic">thick</hi> coat which I meant for Jamie (unless he prefer the other) with black waistcoat and choice of the <foreign><hi rend="italic">breeks</hi></foreign> [trousers];&#x2014;also a pair of old boots, once <hi rend="italic">your</hi> gift to me. Some Books too let him have his will of; they are not in my Mother&#x2019;s way I think.&#x2014; And so good luck to the duds!&#x2014; &#x2014; I wish we heard of Daltonhook<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The farm James Carlyle had considered renting; see <ref target="volume-18/lt-18441002-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1844-10-02">2 Oct.</date></ref></note> being well taken!</p>
<p>Today I have sat stiffly enough copying Oliver&#x2019;s fourth speech <hi rend="italic">with illuminations;</hi>&#x2014;yet have made indifferent way. However, it is now towards 10 p.m.; I must out for a little more walking. Best good night to you all!</p>
<p>Poor Mrs Anthony Sterling has gone out of her mind! &#x201C;Hysterical Monomania,&#x201D; the Doctor calls it, and says it will soon end; but they that know her better shake their heads.&#x2014; Miss Martineau is sunk to the lips in animal magnetism; actually very <hi rend="italic">greatly</hi> mended of her ailment, can &#x201C;walk out five miles&#x201D; &#x26;c:<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >At the suggestion of friends and relatives, Harriet Martineau underwent mesmeric treatment for the supposedly incurable disease which had left her a cripple.

<p><salute><hi rend="small-caps">My dear Mrs. Welsh</hi>,&#x2014;</salute>There is a sort of fatality about your letters; the one you wrote to me from Leith came as I was in the very act of pronouncing your name. I was just expressing my annoyance to my husband that my Aunt Anne whom I had written to about you would not take any notice of my letter (nor has she taken any notice of it to this hour); the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> you wrote to me from Ireland came when I had <pb id="pg-18-257" n="18:257"/>been <hi rend="italic">dreaming</hi> about you over night&#x2014;and the last came half an hour after I had been regretting to Carlyle, that I did not know your address (supposing that you had gone to the other place) that I might have written to ask how you were going on; as I was become quite anxious to know.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >According to Huxley, Margaret Welsh was teaching in a clergyman&#x2019;s family at Cullen, Tipperary.</note> Thank you for being in such a thorough state of <hi rend="italic">sympathy with</hi> me, as to be able to anticipate or rather to <hi rend="italic">divine</hi> my wishes, and thank Providence that you have such good news of yourself to send. There are some precious people in this world who contrive wonderfully to <hi rend="italic">make</hi> good news where others would find only <hi rend="italic">bad</hi> or <hi rend="italic">indifferent</hi> news&#x2014;and <hi rend="italic">you</hi> it seems to me are one of these blessings to the community.</p>
<p>In return for the kindness these good people show you I feel tempted to wish, ungratefully enough, that their child might <hi rend="italic">never turn older!</hi> But older he will certainly turn in spite of my unchristian wishes&#x2014;so that for compensation we must just consider that your own son<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Welsh.</note> will also turn older, and that when the one no longer requires your care the other may be able to offer you his.</p>
<p>It is a great comfort for you always to have a son who <hi rend="italic">deserves</hi> to prosper in the world, let the prosperity come when it may!</p>
<p>For ourselves, we are going on much after the old fashion&#x2014;Carlyle as busy as busy can be over his book about Cromwell which for all that he works at it like a house on fire is still a long way from <hi rend="italic">done</hi>&#x2014;myself transacting the usual amount of headachs, colds, etc. but nothing material ailing me&#x2014;quite well enough for all practical purposes&#x2014;at least for all such as I ever dream of turning myself to. I have been greatly vexed lately with one after another of my acquaintance <hi rend="italic">going mad</hi>&#x2014; One would say that I did not <hi rend="italic">choose</hi> my acquaintance very discreetly since such an issue becomes <hi rend="italic">frequent</hi>&#x2014;but really there seems to be madness in the air just now which no stock of sense to start with can always resist. A very intimate Friend<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Anthony Sterling.</note> has just been here since I began to write, telling me that he has had to lock up his wife in two rooms, she having been running about like a wild cat flinging the poker at people and things. This one however in losing <hi rend="italic">her</hi> wits has sustained no great loss for they were never anything to speak of.</p>
<p>I never hear a word from my Aunts<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Elizabeth, Ann, and Grace Welsh.</note>&#x2014;it seems they can only write <hi rend="italic">sermons,</hi> to save my soul&#x2014;as my soul prefers to shift for itself independent <pb id="pg-18-258" n="18:258"/>dent of <hi rend="italic">their</hi> preaching they have entirely disowned the relationship. The more pity <hi rend="italic">for themselves</hi> I think&#x2014; God be with you&#x2014;let me hear of you again before long and believe always</p>

<salute>Dear Emerson,</salute>
<p>By the clearest law I am bound to write you a word today, were my haste even greater than it is. The last American fleet or ship, about the middle of last month, brought me a Draft for Thirty Pounds;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >With Emerson&#x2019;s letter of <date when="1844-09-30">30 Sept.</date>, representing payment from American booksellers.</note> which I converted into ready cash, and have here,&#x2014;and am now your grateful debtor for, as of old. There seems to be no end to those Boston Booksellers! I think the well is dry; and straightway it begins to run again. Thanks to you:&#x2014;it is, I dare say, a thing you too are grateful for. We will recognise it among the good things of this rather indifferent world.&#x2014; By the way, if that good Clarke <hi rend="italic">like</hi> his business, let him go on with it; but if not, stop him, poor fellow!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >E. P. Clark, the Boston banker.</note> It is to me a matter of really small moment whether those Booksellers&#x2019; accounts be ever audited in this world, or left over to the General Day of Audit. I myself shudder at the sight of such things; and make my bargain here so always as to have no trade with them, but to be <foreign><hi rend="italic">netto</hi></foreign> [clean] from the first: why should I plague poor Clarke with them, if it be any plague to him? The Booksellers will never <hi rend="italic">know</hi> but we examine them! The very terror of Clarke&#x2019;s name will be as the bark of chained Mastiff,&#x2014; and no need for actual biting! Have due pity on the man.</p>
<p>Your English Volume of Essays, as Chapman probably informs you by this Post, was advertised yesterday, &#x201C;with a Preface from me.&#x201D; That is hardly accurate, that latter clause. My &#x201C;Preface&#x201D; consists only of a certificate that the Book is correctly printed, and sent forth by a Publisher of your appointment, whom therefore all readers of yours ought to regard accordingly. Nothing more.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The pref., dated <date when="1844-10-25">25 Oct.</date>, warns &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">un</hi>authorized reprinters, and adventurous spirits inclined to &#x2026; the pirate line, it may be proper to recal the known fact, which should be very present to us all without recalling, that <hi rend="italic">theft</hi> in any sort is abhorrent to the mind of man;&#x2014;that theft is theft, under whatever meridian of longitude, in whatever &#x2018;nation,&#x2019; foreign or domestic, the man stolen from may live; and whether there be any treadmill and gallows for the thief, or no apparatus of that kind!&#x201D;</note> There proves, I believe, no visible <pb id="pg-18-259" n="18:259"/>real vestige of a Copyright obtainable here; only Chapman asserts that he <hi rend="italic">has</hi> obtained one, and that he will take all contraveners into Chancery,&#x2014;which has a terrible sound; and indeed the Act he founds on is of so distracted inextricable a character, it may mean anything and all things, and no Serj<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Talford whom we could consult durst take upon him to say that it meant almost anything whatever. The sound of &#x201C;Chancery,&#x201D; the stereotype character of this volume, and its cheap price, may perhaps deter pirates,&#x2014;who are but a weak body in this country as yet. I judged it right to help in that; and impertinent, at this stage of affairs, to go any farther. The Book, is very fairly printed, onward at least to the Essay <hi rend="italic">New England Politics,</hi> where my &#x201C;perfect-copy&#x201D; of the sheets as yet stops. I did not read any of the Proofs except two; finding it quite superfluous, and a sad waste of time to the hurried Chapman himself. I have found yet but one error, and that a very correctible one, &#x201C;narvest&#x201D; for &#x201C;harvest&#x201D;;&#x2014;no other that I recollect at present.</p>
<p>The work itself falling on me by driblets has not the right chance yet,&#x2014;not till I get it in the bound state, and read it all at once,&#x2014;to produce its due impression on me. But I will say already of it, It is a <hi rend="italic">sermon</hi> to me, as all your other deliberate utterances are; a real <hi rend="italic">word,</hi> which I feel to be such,&#x2014;alas, almost or altogether the one such, in a world all full of jargons, hearsays, echoes, and vain noises, which cannot pass with me for <hi rend="italic">words!</hi> This is a praise far beyond any &#x201C;literary&#x201D; one; literary praises are not worth repeating in comparison.&#x2014; For the rest, I have to object still (what you will call objecting against the Law of Nature) that we find you a Speaker, indeed, but as it were a <hi rend="italic">Soliloquizer</hi> on the eternal mountain-tops only, in vast solitudes where men and their affairs lie all hushed in a very dim remoteness; and only <hi rend="italic">the man</hi> and the stars and the earth are visible,&#x2014;whom, so fine a fellow seems he, we could perpetually punch into, and say, &#x201C;Why won&#x2019;t you come and help us then? We have terrible need of one man like you down among us! It is cold and vacant up there; nothing paintable but rainbows and emotions; come down, and you shall do life-pictures, passions, facts,&#x2014;which <hi rend="italic">transcend</hi> all thought, a<supplied>[nd]</supplied> leave it stuttering and stammering!&#x201D;&#x2014; To which he answers that he won&#x2019;t<supplied>[,]</supplied> can&#x2019;t, and doesn&#x2019;t want to (as the Cockneys have it): and so I leave him, and say, <pb id="pg-18-260" n="18:260"/>&#x201C;You Western Gymnosophist! Well, we can afford one man for that too. But&#x2014;!&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf.

I will try them again, with the Book deliberately before me.&#x2014; There are also one or two utterances about &#x201C;Jesus,&#x201D; &#x201C;immortality,&#x201D; and so forth, which will produce wide-eyes here and there.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably referring to Emerson&#x2019;s mention of &#x201C;the popular doctrine of the immortality of the soul&#x201D; in &#x201C;Nature&#x201D; and his listing Jesus with Pericles, Caesar, et al. in &#x201C;Nominalist and Realist.&#x201D;</note> I do not say it was wrong to utter them; a man obeys his own Daemon in these cases as his Supreme Law.

<salute>My dearest M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Russell</salute>
<p>I suspect that my Man-of-Genius-Husband has forgotten old Mary as completely as if she had never been born&#x2014;Oliver Cromwell having, as the servants at Craigenputtoch used to say, &#x201C;taken the whole <foreign><hi rend="italic">gang</hi></foreign> <pb id="pg-18-261" n="18:261"/>[road] to himsell.&#x201D; The wife of Sir Fowles Buxton<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sir Thomas Fowell Buxton (<date when="1786-00-00">1786</date>&#x2013;<date when="1845-00-00">1845</date>; <ref target="volume-18/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/4247"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), philanthropist and advocate of the abolition of slavery and the slave trade (see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18401203-TC-JAC-01"><sic>12:343</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1840-12-03">3 Dec. 1840</date></corr></ref>), m., <date when="1807-00-00">1807</date>, Hannah Burney (<date when="1783-00-00">1783</date>&#x2013;<date when="1872-00-00">1872</date>).</note> has been many times heard to wish that the <hi rend="italic">Blacks</hi> (<hi rend="italic">her</hi> Husbands fixed idea) were all at the bottom of the red Sea; and I am afraid I have often been undutiful enough of late months to wish the memory of Cromwell &#x201C;at the bottom of <hi rend="italic">something</hi>, where I might hear less about it&#x2014; It <hi rend="italic">is</hi> at the bottom of rubbish enough, I am sure; to judge from the tremendous ransacking of Old folios and illegible manuscripts which Carlyle is always going on with, but still he manages to bring it up, in season and out of season till I begin to be weary of him, (the Protector) great man tho he was. But as everything comes to an end, with patience; he will probably get himself written at last, and printed and published, and then my husband will return to a consciousness of his daily life, and I shall have peace from the turmoils of the <hi rend="italic">Commonwealth:</hi> For if Carlyle thinks of nothing else but his <hi rend="italic">book</hi> whilst he is <hi rend="italic">writing</hi> it; one has always this consolation that he is the first to forget it when it is <hi rend="italic">written</hi>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile; to return to old Mary I send an order for three Soversigns from my own <hi rend="italic">pin money</hi> (which is ample enough) to keep her poor old soul and body together a little longer&#x2014; And I shall not tell Carlyle that I have done so, as I know it would vex him that he should have needed to be <hi rend="italic">put in mind:</hi> So that if he sends another supply shortly; you will understand the mystery of the double sending&#x2014;</p>
<p>I wonder how you all are at Thornhill&#x2014; It seems so long since I have heard a word of news from that place which I think of more than of any other in the world&#x2014; I shall hear from you one of these days, and understand that &#x201C;the smallest contribution will be gratefully received.&#x201D;</p>
<p>I had a letter from Liverpool a week ago and all was going on well there&#x2014;my Uncle better than he had been some little while before&#x2014; Jeanie and Maggie are at Auchertool with Walter&#x2014;leading a very good for nothing life there according to their own account of it&#x2014;engaged in perpetual tea-drinkings with &#x201C;people whom they can take no pleasure in&#x201D; and &#x201C;making themselves amends in sitting at home with <hi rend="italic">their feet on the fender,</hi> talking over the absurdities of the said people&#x201D; whereupon I have written Jeanie a very <hi rend="italic">scolding</hi> letter which it is to be feared will share the common fate of all <hi rend="italic">good advice</hi> in this world&#x2014;make her angry at <hi rend="italic">me,</hi> without putting a stop either to the <hi rend="italic">teadrinking</hi> with pleople<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in <bold>MS</bold>.</note> &#x201C;one can take no pleasure in&#x201D;&#x2014;or the idle practice of sitting <pb id="pg-18-262" n="18:262"/>ting <hi rend="italic">with her feet on the fender</hi>&#x2014;and still worse practice of laughing at ones neighbours absurdities rather than <hi rend="italic">ones own</hi>.</p>

<salute>Dearest Babbie</salute>
<p>It is long since I wrote&#x2014;but this time my conscience acquits me, as I trust you will also; when I give you my word of honour that it has not been that beggarly <hi rend="italic">Force of circumstances</hi> that has hindered, but my own <hi rend="italic">reflective volition!</hi> I have discovered <hi rend="italic">better late than&#x2014;never,</hi> that writing so many letters as I write, is after all but <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;strenuous idleness&#x201D;</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Horace, <hi rend="italic">Epistles</hi> 1.11.28.</note>&#x2014;and that if I am to succeed in turning my life to any serious account, I must restrict myself in this particular&#x2014; So long as I was doing nothing better; it was a fault in me to leave any letter unwritten which could give a moments pleasure to any one I cared for&#x2014; But at present that I <hi rend="italic">am</hi> profitable employed&#x2014;and find the days too short for what I wish to get done, my friends must content themselves with hearing from me <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;in the intervals of Business.&#x201D;</hi> When <hi rend="italic">you</hi> can give <hi rend="italic">me</hi> the same reason&#x2014;(that you are profitably employed)&#x2014;for diminishing the frequency of your letters I shall admit it I promise you in all gladness&#x2014;but, <hi rend="italic">till then</hi>&#x2014;you will do well to write to me rather <hi rend="italic">oftener</hi> than more <hi rend="italic">seldom</hi>.</p>
<p>We expect John Carlyle tomorrow evening&#x2014;straight from Scotsbrig where he has been all this while&#x2014; He did not he said purpose coming <pb id="pg-18-263" n="18:263"/>by Liverpool&#x2014; &#x201C;as the weather was so bad besides that Miss Jeanie was not there at present&#x201D;&#x2014; If Miss Jeanie <hi rend="italic">had</hi> been there; I dare say he would have taken but a slight advantage of the circumstance&#x2014; He will <hi rend="italic">dander</hi> about here for a week or two till he find himself another lodging; but Carlyle and he are got too impatient of one another now, that I need fear any prolonged visitation. He wrote to Carlyle some weeks ago that <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;his work</hi> in Annandale being now terminated he was purposing to return to London&#x201D;&#x2014; Carlyle enquired very naturally <hi rend="italic">what work</hi> he alluded to as nobody was aware that he had any&#x2014;whereupon he wrote back in a tone of injured innocence or rather <hi rend="italic">injured industry</hi> that his work had been reading <hi rend="italic">Dante with annotations</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Carlyle eventually pbd. <hi rend="italic">Dante&#x2019;s Divine Comedy: the Inferno. A Literal Prose Translation</hi> (<date when="1849-00-00">1849</date>) with the text of the original and explanatory notes.</note>&#x2014;and that he really did not know what we would have&#x2014;as, if he were not in any professional employment for the moment at least he was <hi rend="italic">willing to accept of such when it came</hi> and in the meanwhile he <hi rend="italic">abated</hi> no <hi rend="italic">jot of heart or hope</hi>&#x2014;this magnanimous idea of &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">abating no jot of heart or hope</hi>&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Milton, sonnet &#x201C;To Mr. Cyriack Skinner Upon His Blindness.&#x201D;</note> in a state of the most complete <hi rend="italic">futility</hi> has tickeled Carlyle immensely&#x2014;as well it might!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I had a letter from Plattnauer a few days ago&#x2014;he is very steady to his programme of writing once a week&#x2014;which <hi rend="italic">in spite of the postage</hi>, I am heartily glad of as it keeps him always in ones sight at least&#x2014; I can trace no change in his letters either for better or worse&#x2014; He is hurrying on towards Italy&#x2014;as if the Devil were at his heels&#x2014;but what he is to do <hi rend="italic">there</hi>&#x2014;neither himself nor any of us has the smallest idea. The hope of his going towards Prussia has quite left my mind&#x2014; His Mother-in-law sits still on his own <hi rend="italic">estate</hi> and writes him urgent letters&#x2014;but these letters appear to have quite the contrary effect of what they are designed for&#x2014; He declares that &#x201C;altho he knows I wish him to go to to<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> Prussia that is, <hi rend="italic">to the Devil;</hi> he will nevertheless return to England in spring&#x2014;where there is work cut out for him for some years to come&#x201D;&#x2014;other sort of <hi rend="italic">work</hi> than <hi rend="italic">reading Dante with annotations</hi> I imagine!&#x2014;and he asks me emphatically, &#x201C;Having once taken me out of a <hi rend="italic">Lunatic Assylum</hi> are you prepared to come to Prussia and take me out of <hi rend="italic">a Prison?</hi> for that <hi rend="italic">might be</hi> what awaits me there!&#x201D; What is to be the upshot of his coming back to England in the same state of mind in which he left it I dare not let myself think&#x2014; &#x201C;Sufficient for the day is the evil thereof.&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Matt. 6:34.</note>&#x2014;</p>

<salute>Dear Scott,</salute>
<p>A good while ago you left a message here with my Wife, about the Copy of the Foscolo <hi rend="italic">Dante,</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">La Commedia di Dante Allighieri, illustrata da Ugo Foscolo</hi>, 4 vols. (<date when="1842-00-00">1842</date>&#x2013;<date when="1843-00-00">43</date>), ed. G. Mazzini from material collected by Ugo Foscolo (<date when="1778-00-00">1778</date>&#x2013;<date when="1827-00-00">1827</date>); see <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410415-JWC-TC-01"><sic>13:101</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1841-04-15">15 April 1841</date></corr></ref>.</note> which I had been mentioning to you, as belonging to my Brother, and at your service.</p>
<p>Both Brother and <hi rend="italic">Dante</hi> were in Scotland at the time, and have continued there far longer than I expected. I now find that Mazzini has a Copy of the Book, which he will willingly lend you; therefore as the briefer method I accept his offer;&#x2014;and have engaged him accordingly to leave the Volumes for you at the Wedgwoods&#x2019; in Gower Street. They will be there, with your Address upon them, and coming whence I tell you,&#x2014;in some three days from this date. More is not needful to be said on that head of our discourse.</p>
<p>I hope you get well on with your Dante operations; and find the study of such a man more and more fruitful. It is good to keep company with such: I say that, sometimes by way of consolation when ready to choke in <hi rend="italic">my</hi> hideous Puritan Golgotha. Courage!</p>
<p>It was a great and most welcome piece of news to us, that your Doctors had <hi rend="italic">withdrawn</hi> their ominous sentence from you. Not that I ever attach entire credence to the sentences of Doctors on such matters; but the Imagination lays hold of them, works mischievous confusion with them, nevertheless. It is best that they <hi rend="italic">withdraw</hi> themselves. You may be inclined to infer now that as to your ill-health, Doctors with their stethoscopes know very little of it; that it is in brief the general damage and set of wounds you have got, in a pretty tough Life-battle, continued for a good many years now;&#x2014;and that, by the blessing of Heaven, you may still be able to go on and fight, for an indefinite period, and give the Enemy many a home-thrust yet,&#x2014;and occasionally get your foot on his neck too; better than ever!</p>
<p>When the weather improves, we must certainly attempt a meeting. Pity there are so few. Do not neglect to call at any rate when you are <pb id="pg-18-266" n="18:266"/>in Town.&#x2014; <closer><salute>And all good be with you, seen by me or not seen.&#x2014;Yours very sincerely,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dearest Helen</salute>
<p>If your letter had not been so long or so amusing, if it had been in fact less &#x201C;creditable to your head and <hi rend="italic">hort&#x201D;;</hi> the chances are it would have been answered sooner. I should have flashed you off a few lines &#x201C;at the earliest opportunity&#x201D;&#x2014;but being a meritorious letter; I wished as poor William Gibson used to phrase it, &#x201C;to make a suitable <hi rend="italic">return&#x201D;</hi>&#x2014;and for <hi rend="italic">that,</hi> one has to await the &#x201C;convenient season.&#x201D; Thus you see my dear young Lady there is always &#x201C;something very particular&#x201D; occurring <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;here down&#x201D;</hi> (<foreign><hi rend="italic">qui gi&#xf9;</hi></foreign>) to prevent virtue having its &#x201C;own reward&#x201D;! There is one touch in your letter which has filled me with genuine admiration&#x2014;you were not at all aware I dare say (for merit is ever <hi rend="italic">unconscious</hi>) when you historically mentioned the fact; of the importance I was likely to attach to it, and the favourable inferences I should draw from it respecting the general state of your soul. You said that on being told how Margaret<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Welshes&#x2019; servant.</note> had poured boiling soup &#x201C;all over her&#x201D;&#x2014;you <hi rend="italic">ran for cotton,</hi> and <hi rend="small-caps">then</hi> down stairs &#x26;c &#x26;c&#x2014; Now <hi rend="italic">that</hi> is what I call having ones wits about one, <hi rend="italic">that</hi> is really being a <hi rend="italic">useful</hi> member of society. There is not one of a hundred young Ladies who would have <hi rend="italic">run for cotton</hi> <hi rend="small-caps">first</hi>, who would not have run to see the state of the accident first&#x2014;and so lost time which is always precious but never so precious as in cases of burning&#x2014; I make you my compliments on your calm ready helpfulness my gentle cousin&#x2014;it would be well if there were more of that sort of helpfulness circulating in this <hi rend="italic">fussy</hi> little world. And when I meet with an ccident&#x2014;&#x201C;happen a misfortune&#x201D; as my first London servant used to say<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400613-JWC-SAI-01"><sic>12:162</sic><corr>JWC to SAI, <date when="1840-06-13">13 June 1840</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014;I hope you may be at hand to help me&#x2014;you&#x2014;with your <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;little</hi> cry and <hi rend="italic">much</hi> <hi rend="small-caps">wool&#x201D;!</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A reversal of the proverbial &#x201C;Great cry and little wool.&#x201D;</note></p>

I asked do you seriously mean that she is gone mad&#x201D;?&#x2014; Yes said he&#x2014;she is at present in a decided state of Monomania&#x2014;which the D<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> say the slightest contradiction may drive into <hi rend="italic">Hysterical phrenzy</hi>&#x201D;&#x2014; Monomania? said I and what is her particular <hi rend="italic">idea?</hi>&#x201D;&#x2014; Her &#x201C;particular idea&#x201D; said Anthony with all the <hi rend="italic">military</hi> composure in the world, &#x201C;is, that I have fallen in love with <hi rend="italic">you</hi>&#x2014;that <hi rend="italic">you</hi> are a dreadful person&#x2014;and that I ruin myself in making you presents&#x201D;!&#x2014; Actually the poor wretch was raving one day about his (Anthony&#x2019;s) having <hi rend="italic">given me my new dining room carpet and new piano</hi>&#x2014; &#x201C;She was sure it was <hi rend="italic">he</hi>&#x201D; !!! and all these base visions growing out of the one poor little fact of her husband&#x2019;s having once given me <hi rend="italic">a crockery jug!!</hi>
You may fancy if I sat very comfortable in my chair after this <hi rend="italic">revealation</hi> He offered me wine, which I declined tho really <hi rend="italic">needing it</hi>&#x2014;as I also declined his offer to send the carriage home with me; tho&#x2019; I should have been the better of that too&#x2014;in short I conducted myself like an angel of <hi rend="italic">discretion</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">came away</hi> with all despatch&#x2014;but <hi rend="small-caps">my</hi> <hi rend="italic">discretion</hi> never <hi rend="italic">succeeds</hi> the unhappy woman was told by one of John&#x2019;s<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Sterling&#x2019;s.</note> children that I had been there, and forthwith fell into the <hi rend="italic">Phrenzy</hi> which the D<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> apprehended&#x2014; For several days the poor Husband&#x2019;s state was truly <pb id="pg-18-268" n="18:268"/>pitiable&#x2014;he could not leave her room a moment without her shrieking out that he was &#x201C;going to walk with M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle&#x201D;&#x2014;and flinging <hi rend="italic">the poker</hi> all about&#x2014; At last she suddenly took a violent <hi rend="italic">dislike to him</hi> and would not suffer his presence, which was so far good&#x2014; He still keeps her in his own house&#x2014;but shut up with <hi rend="italic">three</hi> experienced attendants in a part of the house which is <hi rend="italic">boarded</hi> off from the rest with improvised planks&#x2014;lined with <hi rend="italic">flock</hi> to prevent her noise being heard. It is very horrible&#x2014;she is sometimes like to lay all waste and has to be put in a straight waistcoat&#x2014; I wish she had chosen one of her maids or some other of her <hi rend="italic">friends</hi> than <hi rend="italic">myself</hi> to be jealous of&#x2014;almost <hi rend="italic">anybody</hi> would have been more feasable&#x2014; Nevertheless Anthony tell<supplied>[s]</supplied><note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> me this jealously has been an affair of some standing&#x2014;tho&#x2019; neither of us can recall a single circumstance that could have given a rational or even irrational ground for it&#x2014; Meanwhile it is slightly annoying to have ones name uttered <hi rend="italic">in shrieks</hi>, before assembled D<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> and servants&#x2014;and coupled with the most ignominious epithets.

<salute>Dear Jamie,</salute>
<p>I am, and shall likely be for a while, extremely busy; never busier; but I must write you half a word about the Meal-barrel and other goods. The whole arrived yesterday; carriage, I think, 23/ and some pence. The articles seemed all of first-rate quality, but the packing had been a little unsuccessful; the potatoe-box had given way,&#x2014;and alas <hi rend="italic">our</hi> Pot of Butter was found <hi rend="italic">broken</hi>,&#x2014;some of the Potatoes having run out, and left it room to jumble! The meal-barrel too was leaking a little;&#x2014;the Cocks, alas, had to be instantly given away to the Poor. We have a quiet surmise that it was &#x201C;The Ingineer of Trailbrow&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Carlyle. The barrel had been sent <date when="1844-11-09">9 Nov.</date></note> who advised an additional Box for the butter-pots, with Potatoes to fill up &#x26;c &#x26;c; tho&#x2019;, of course, there must be no whispering it to him!&#x2014; The best is, but little damage is done after all. Not many pounds of the meal have been lost; and we have shifted it into the old Barrel, with much beating;&#x2014;all safe now. The Butter was a sadder sight to our Dame: &#x201C;such excellent looking Butter!&#x201D; she said; &#x201C;and the Pot broken <pb id="pg-18-270" n="18:270"/>in several pieces, and even the clay of the Potatoes has been contact with it!&#x201D;&#x2014; The &#x201C;clay&#x201D; has spoiled but half a pound of it: the whole is now shifted into a fresh Pot, and by the aid of pickle and salt cloths, I suppose, it will keep well enough. There is on the whole no considerable harm done;&#x2014;but in future we will stick by the old mode of packing.&#x2014;</p>

Tell her so, when she comes back to you; and how I always forgot to mention it, and always had due regret.

<p>No news we have heard of late months was welcomer to us than this that you are to continue in Scotsbrig! There is nothing like continuing if one any way can. It saves an immense, indeed incalculable expenditure of trouble in every kind; work, suffering, uncertainty &#x26;c &#x26;c. besides you have got the place cheaper.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Carlyle wrote, <date when="1844-11-08">8 Nov.</date>, enclosing a copy of James&#x2019;s letter to George Cranston, the factor, withdrawing his application for Dalton Hook farm and giving TC details of the new lease at &#xa3;165 p.a., less certain allowances for repairs.</note> Really I could on the whole have been glad that you had got it the old way. We rejoice very much in this result for you;&#x2014;and for our good Mother especially it is welcome to us.</p>

<salute>Dear Jean,</salute>
<p>I have forgotten whether it was the <date when="1844-11-22">22<hi rend="italic">d</hi> November</date> (Martinmas,&#x2014; opposite to Whitsunday) or the <date when="1844-12-22">22<hi rend="italic">d</hi> December</date>, that was Jenny&#x2019;s day for getting her little fraction of a &#xa3;5 from me: but I am anxious to keep the day, both now and in future;&#x2014;so pray tell me, if you can. In the meanwhile I have written to Jenny by this same post, to say that you will pay her the &#xa3;5 whenever she demands it, for this year; and will tell me the precise day for next. Pray request James to attend to this. Punctuality is always beautiful; especially in a case like the present.</p>
<p>I do not send James any <hi rend="italic">money</hi>, as yet, to make the payment with; because there is already an account against me, and I have other tatters and tagrags of money to send: My next request to you therefore, properly my <hi rend="italic">first</hi> request of all is, To send me that Clothiers&#x2019; Bill and all the other bills and concerns that I owe you, or that I can pay by your means. Jamie of Scotsbrig was directed to send his Account to you, more than once directed; but probably he has not done it. Do not stay for him therefore; send me what you have, and let me get the affair settled up. It hangs there like an ugly tatter which I desire to <hi rend="italic">clip off</hi>.</p>
<p>We have had no direct Letter from you this long while; Jack sent us news from time to time which rather uncomfortably explained your silence. He reports now that the poor child is somewhat better, and your household more at rest again. May it continue; and perfect itself, this new state of matters!&#x2014; As there is now no regular writing hand in your region to send us due accounts, I conclude you will have to take up the pen again, even tho&#x2019; you be a little busy.</p>
<p>Jack is still with us, but goes into his new lodging tomorrow. He is still without work; very idle, indeed; but otherwise well. He <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> get to any work,&#x2014;so he says always, and such really on one account and another is <hi rend="italic">the fact:</hi> if any one could help him to a little work, it would be a real blessing to him, poor fellow!&#x2014; He is not to go into his old lodging: the Landlady<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Elizabeth Bone.</note> has kept him waiting all this while, upon <pb id="pg-18-272" n="18:272"/>some chance of turning out a <hi rend="italic">new</hi> pair of lodgers she had got and did not altogether like,&#x2014;but now she decides not to turn them off after all. His new place is fully nearer us than the old was; much quieter,&#x2014;looking out into nurseries, over a very unfrequented kind of thoroughfare, not a <hi rend="italic">street</hi> but a <hi rend="italic">road</hi> at that part of it: and the people, we find, are partly known to us,&#x2014;connected with very decent people whom we know. Most likely it will do very fairly.</p>
<p>As for myself I have had much ugly drudgery since I saw you, since I <hi rend="italic">wrote</hi> to you; and still have,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; with bright blinks in it too! I have gathered most of Cromwell&#x2019;s Letters, Public Speeches, everything that survives of <hi rend="italic">himself</hi>; washed it <hi rend="italic">clean</hi>, with infinite toil and disgust, from the horrible <foreign><hi rend="italic">stanks</hi></foreign> [stagnant pools] it has been lying hidden in for these hundred and fifty years or more;&#x2014;and mean to set <hi rend="italic">it</hi> out as a Book by itself, preparatory to whatever other Book I may find myself equal to about the man. <hi rend="italic">This</hi> will soon be ready to publish when I like: two volumes, I think:&#x2014;but I do not mean to be all at once in haste with <hi rend="italic">this</hi>; till I see how the other shapes itself, a little more clearly!&#x2014; No more of it at present. I <hi rend="italic">have</hi> some hopes of getting the frightful job <hi rend="italic">all</hi> done by &#x26; by: it will be a great deliverance to everybody!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Jane is pretty well in spite of the damp cold. Send us word that the poor little child is better; that you are all well.&#x2014; <closer><salute>Ever your affectionate Brother,</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name></p>

<salute>Dear Milnes,</salute>
<p>You will do us a real kindness if you will come down tomorrow evening (Sunday), and give us news of yourself and of the world. I am visible from half past two o&#x2019;clock to all that will come and look at me; but few come whom I care to look at. My Wife is at home all morning; often in this bad weather, all day.

He was delighted with your present, which he had been prepared for by a letter from you. They gave me a good account of Mill. Milnes too had been with them the evening before. He is fluttering about preparing to going to Berlin&#x201D; (MS: Marquess of Northampton).</note></p>

I am exceedingly busy, fishing up out of the depths of brutish human stupidity, washing clean and making legible the letters and speeches of Oliver Cromwell, a heroic man, buried in such an element of mud and darkness as few heroes ever were. It is an infinitely ugly kind of drudgery; I know no man living whom such stupidity and brutality do more disgust than me; but it seems a kind of duty lying on the like of me. I say, &#x201C;He <hi rend="italic">fought</hi>; thy poor trade is but to <hi rend="italic">speak</hi>; speak, then, for him.&#x201D; Happily, this branch of the business is now almost done; we must then try others, which, if still harder work, offer work a little more inspiring. I begin to be much disaffected to the whole business of books, and often think, if I have ever done with this, I will never write another.</p>
<p>We heard in some oblique way that our French travelers<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Bullers and the Barings.</note> had all got safe to Nice at last, though not without adventures, disarrangements, and, I understand, sickness to all, or most of them. They were in a steamer, all the Buller family, and driven into Toulon harbor that night Louis Philippe found himself storm-stayed on our coast here.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The French King Louis Philippe (<date when="1773-00-00">1773</date>&#x2013;<date when="1850-00-00">1850</date>) arrived in England, <date when="1844-10-08">8 Oct.</date>, for a state visit. He was supposed to sail from Portsmouth early on <date when="1844-10-14">14 Oct.</date>; but because of bad weather he went by train, via London, to Dover and left on a French mail-steamer the next day.</note> Poor Mrs. Buller must have suffered not a little. But Mr. Fleming seemed to say he understood they were all settled and well now.</p>
<p>I congratulate you on Devonshire<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Apparently she was visiting her sister Lady Louis at Cadwell House, Torquay, Devon.</note> in comparison with London. Daily these many years I have had one desire that never quits me,&#x2014;to see the green earth round me, godly <hi rend="italic">silence</hi>, and a sky undefaced with soot and other dirt. But we have to do without it the best we can. Except by some revolution in my affairs, I do not see how it is to be obtained within measurable periods.</p>
<p>Will you offer my kind regards to Lady Louis, of whom we saw a little in London, whom it must be a great pleasure to you to meet <pb id="pg-18-274" n="18:274"/>again?

<salute>Dear Madam,</salute>
<p>I had the honour yesterday to receive a very kind letter from you; for which I am bound to return many acknowledgements. Of Mr Scheffer I unluckily do not know much, except his Print of <hi rend="italic">Mignon</hi> which I have seen in the shop-windows here, and now find very vividly <hi rend="italic">re</hi>-engraved in my own head withal.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ary Scheffer (<date when="1795-00-00">1795</date>&#x2013;<date when="1858-00-00">1858</date>), Dutch-born French painter. He painted two well-known pictures of Mignon, the enigmatic character in Goethe&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister&#x2019;s Apprenticeship</hi>, both of which circulated widely in prints; see Harriet L. Grote, Memoir of &#x2026; <hi rend="italic">Ary Scheffer</hi> (<date when="1860-00-00">1860</date>) 58. Jane Stirling became a good friend of Scheffer&#x2019;s: &#x201C;In his &#x2018;Christus Consolator,&#x2019; this eminent artist had presented in one of his figures his ideal of female beauty, and was greatly struck, on being first introduced to Miss Stirling, to find in her the almost exact embodiment of that ideal. She was introduced afterwards in many of his pictures&#x201D; (Hanna 1:8n). He also painted Jane and Katherine with their niece Marion Russell; see Bone, opp. 8 and 53.</note> If I ever come again to Paris, certainly I shall not forget that so kind an Invitation has been given me.</p>
<p>That a friend of yours<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> thinks of translating some of my poor Books, in the hope doubtless that the French Nation also might like to become acquainted a little with them, cannot be otherwise than agreeable to me. But whether my fair critic&#x2019;s hope in that respect is in the least well-grounded, I cannot judge; nor if so, which Work were likely to be the suitablest for her and her People. The Work she herself likes best, and feels ablest for, this I should compute would be the probablest in her hands for being liked by the French Public too: and which of them <pb id="pg-18-275" n="18:275"/>this may be, she of course is the most competent of all persons to judge.</p>

<salute>Dear Christie,</salute>
<p>Many thanks for your Ludlow Note. We may take that story from thickheaded Edmund, with great certainty, as a rumour of the time; but not with any certainty as more.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edmund Ludlow (<date when="1617-00-00">1617</date>&#x2013;<date when="1692-00-00">92</date>), parliamentary leader and regicide, who wrote <hi rend="italic">Memoirs</hi> (Vevey, <date when="1698-00-00">1698</date>&#x2013;<date when="1699-00-00">99</date>). His story is given in <hi rend="italic">Cromwell, Works</hi> 8:258&#x2013;59n, about how Sir Anthony Ashley Cooper (<date when="1621-00-00">1621</date>&#x2013;<date when="1683-00-00">83</date>), later 1st Baron Ashley and 1st earl of Shaftesbury, &#x201C;being denied Cromwell&#x2019;s Daughter Mary in marriage,&#x201D; turned against Cromwell in various ways. Christie had found the tale, among passages omitted from the pbd. <hi rend="italic">Memoirs</hi>, in John Locke&#x2019;s handwriting, in papers in &#x201C;possession of Lord Lovelace.&#x201D; Mary Cromwell (b. <date when="1637-00-00">1637</date>), m., <date when="1657-00-00">1657</date>, Thomas Belsyse (<date when="1627-00-00">1627</date>&#x2013;<date when="1700-00-00">1700</date>), Viscount Fauconberg of Newburgh, a widower. TC writes of the story: &#x201C;Court-rumour, this of his, truth in the heart of it, details rather vague;&#x2014;not much worth verifying&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 8:259n). He was evidently mistaken about the MS having a &#x201C;Museum Title.&#x201D;</note> Edmund was far away from Whitehall and Hampton Court<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Govt. palaces, the first in the center of London, the second ca. 12 mi. W.</note> in those particular years; and a very thickheaded man to boot. I observe your Ashley Cooper is one of the excluded Members in Oliver&#x2019;s Last Parliament; and does not get in till after the <hi rend="italic">Petition and Advice</hi>, when the Young Lady was already married.&#x2014; Can you tell me what is the Museum Title of the Ludlow <hi rend="italic">Ms</hi>., if there should be occasion to refer to it?</p>
<p>I have had the Harrington <hi rend="italic">Ms</hi>. overhauled: John Harrington, a &#x201C;recruiter&#x201D; for Somersetshire; seemingly a Puritan Lawyer: alas, only 34 pages refer to the Parliament at all; and these, to judge from the samples, are of extreme insignificance.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Harrington of Kelston or Kelweston (ca. <date when="1590-00-00">1590</date>&#x2013;<date when="1654-00-00">1654</date>), M.P. for Somerset, presbyterian lawyer and his &#x201C;Memorandum Book of Private and Parliamentary Matters, <date when="1646-00-00">1646</date>&#x2013;<date when="1653-00-00">1653</date>&#x201D; (British Lib., Add. MSS. 10,114). Recruiters were M.P.s in the Long Parliament elected after <date when="1645-00-00">1645</date>.</note> However, I mean to have the whole copied.</p>
<p>If you should ever fall in with the most transitory notice of the <pb id="pg-18-276" n="18:276"/>Little Parliament, the Puritan Convention of the Notables, nicknamed &#x201C;Barbones Parliament,&#x201D; pray do not neglect to apprise me.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Little Parliament, a convention of puritan notables, convened <date when="1653-07-04">4 July 1653</date> and met till <date when="1653-12-22">22 Dec. 1653</date> named after Praisegod Barbon (<date when="1596-00-00">1596</date>?&#x2013;<date when="1679-00-00">1679</date>), anabaptist leather-seller, apptd.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Your Letter in answer to the last I sent you arrived duly, as you have already heard thro&#x2019; other channels; for I sent it off immediately after we had done with it here; and since that, I have seen in my regular turn various other Letters of yours, bringing down your history to the last arrival, which occurred a few nights ago. The Doctor, who was in Annandale all summer, professed to be very constant in writing to you from the scene of all others most interesting; so that at present I, who have not been out of London at all, can have little that is new to communicate. No man can well be busier either. But I write nevertheless, were it only to assure you that there are no news which you do not know.</p>
<p>The account you give us of your new farming operations is to me highly promising and agreeable. No pleasanter picture have I known for a long time in your biography than that you gave us of the planting of the Indian Corn,&#x2014;every soul of the establishment busy getting the grain dibbled in, the very infants, toddling about, each industrious after its kind; a little useful &#x201C;dottle of a body,&#x201D; already working for its little bit of bread there,&#x2014;claiming from the Great Parent of us all, with a noble <hi rend="italic">practical</hi> &#x201C;prayer,&#x201D; planted into the bosom of our general Mother Earth, &#x201C;Give us this day our daily bread!&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Matt. 6:11.</note> And then in your next Letter we had word of the <hi rend="italic">reaping</hi> of that same crop; all again busy, gathering where they had sown. Such sights, whatever be the &#x201C;state of markets,&#x201D; the &#x26;c &#x26;c, are very blessed to me. There lies health, and truth, and solid good for a man. We can make no more of it,&#x2014;few can make so much,&#x2014;in any sphere of life whatever. My prediction to myself is, That whatsoever is most serious, most patient, manful, industrious, good and worthy in you, will more and more unfold itself <pb id="pg-18-277" n="18:277"/>there,&#x2014;to the discouragement, to the extinction of whatever is not so;&#x2014;and that you will find a sober manful existence, which you have always longed after, at length possible for you there! And <hi rend="italic">if</hi> so why should we complain of anything? Life is a most grave matter; issuing in Death, and in what lies after Death;&#x2014;it is not a joyous matter, it is a matter full of toil and earnest difficulty, full of sadness, I believe, to all manful men! We have to get <hi rend="italic">above</hi> it; to say that we care not for its &#x201C;happinesses,&#x201D; that we can do with <hi rend="italic">all</hi> its sorrows, and patiently front them, and work a little <hi rend="italic">good</hi> even out of them,&#x2014;before its comforts, such as they are, come to any evidence for us. We do not get the good of Life till we have gained the victory over it.</p>
<p>Be not too sad, my dear Brother, that we are parted: this too is portion of the lot of man. Every one of us has, in many stern situations to say, &#x201C;Alone, alone! I tread the winepress alone!&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Isa. 63:3.</note>&#x2014; My solitude here, I believe, is equal to that of Canada. I too feel that my Mother will die; the being who of all others has loved me best;&#x2014;that already she is almost as if dead to me:&#x2014;and I have no refuge except saying, and trying to say truly from my heart, &#x201C;God made us all; God is the maker of <hi rend="italic">Death</hi> too; and nothing in us or of us which He found worthy, which was noble and godlike, <hi rend="italic">can</hi> die!&#x201D; Courage, Courage!&#x2014; Nay why should we look at it so sternly after all? You <hi rend="italic">can</hi> at any time come over to England again; by the outlay of a certain sum of money and time, it is always doable; many have come, visit after visit: why should we afflict our hearts, not knowing at any time what a day may bring forth?<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Prov. 27:1.</note>&#x2014;</p>
<p>Much better than all this moralising, however, is the fact which I can still assure you of, that our good old Mother is, so far as I can learn, in a really very good way at present. Jack is but an indistinct reporter; however I do gather from him that her health is reasonably good, altogether as we used to know it of late years; that she bears all things with a devout composure such as from of old we have all known and admired in her; and is in fact &#x201C;mercifully dealt with&#x201D; outwardly and inwardly, as she herself would say: for which we all of us have reason to thank God.&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; Of Jamie&#x2019;s getting Scotsbrig again you have already heard. We rejoice at it for her Mother&#x2019;s sake withal. Some kind of <hi rend="italic">rent</hi> we are now to pay to Jamie for her; and that will be the only change necessary. Did any mention to you the death of a young daughter of M&#x2019;Kinnow&#x2019;s from Hawick?<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The consumptive cousin, Marion, da. of Hugh McKinnon; see <ref target="volume-17/lt-18430827-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1843-08-27">27 Aug. 1843</date></ref>. John Carlyle wrote to his brother James, <date when="1844-12-20">20 Dec.</date>: &#x201C;I was not at all surprised to hear of poor Marion&#x2019;s death considering how far gone she was even in <date when="1844-09-00">September</date>. Perhaps I ought to have given her father my opinion more distinctly, so that he might have been better prepared for the event&#x201D; (MS: NLS Acc. 9086.210).</note> I forget her name. She came <pb id="pg-18-278" n="18:278"/>down to Scotsbrig when I was there last, a nice <foreign><hi rend="italic">blate</hi></foreign> [timid] little woman; seeking refuge from threatened Consumption: she came again last year, I think:&#x2014;and now a few weeks ago she is dead. Poor little thing; fluttering like a bird out from the talons of Death, and could not escape! The news made me very sad; made the image of her very sad to me.&#x2014; The rest of them in Annandale and elsewhere are, as you hear, much about their usual way. Jenny continues very industrious, they say; one of the best-behaved little bodies: I hope she will gradually dismiss the Past out of her mind; and may yet, even legally, get loose from so fatal an entanglement as that has been. Jean&#x2019;s children have been unwell, but seem recovering. Mary also complains; but our Doctor reports improvement in her too. He himself as you learn has got back to this neighbourhood again; he looks well in health, shews good spirits;&#x2014;has but one want, which indeed is a dreadful one, that of some real work to do! I do not now speak to him at all on that subject. But if I <hi rend="italic">could</hi> assist him towards getting to <hi rend="italic">work</hi>, I should esteem it the greatest blessing. I begin, however, to forsee for him a Future as it were nearly or altogether idle,&#x2014;furnished with what he will call &#x201C;work,&#x201D; but what impartial onlookers cannot call such. But we must still hope.</p>
<p>As for me I struggle at my very ugly task, sometimes with a little progress, at other times with none visible. Just at present I am in a kind of crisis: the day after tomorrow I am to attempt another time the real heart of the matter! It makes me very uncomfortable;&#x2014;but I have pretty good health for me; I must persevere till I do get the matter off my hands in one form or another.&#x2014; Did they tell you our brave Friend, the most intimate we had in this region, John Sterling, is dead? Of consumption; he died slowly, with great heroism and composure: he is a real loss to us here, where amid regiments of acquaintances &#x26;c whom it is one&#x2019;s first duty to <hi rend="italic">avoid</hi>, worthy friends are rare.&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; &#x2014; Dear Brother, you must write long descriptions about Canada thro the winter; let us thoroughly understand your locality, neighbours &#x26;c &#x26;c: one cover, you see, will hold a good deal of writing! <closer><salute>Jane sends her affectionate remembrance to you all. My kind regards to the little ones and Jenny. Take care of that ancle!</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I suppose you to be about the Gill at this time, for I have seen two little Notes of Jenny&#x2019;s and Mary&#x2019;s to that effect. At any rate they will send you the Letter on, if you have returned to Scotsbrig. So I will write a word to you, dear Mother; better late than never. It is long since you have heard a direct word from me; you always like right well to hear, and you never complain of <hi rend="italic">not</hi> hearing&#x2014;my dear <hi rend="italic">good</hi> Mother!</p>
<p>Yesterday which was my birthday, I meant to have written you: I said to myself, &#x201C;It is the least thou canst do on <hi rend="italic">her</hi> behalf for bringing thee into the world!&#x201D; I right fully purposed and meant: but just at the time intended for that pious object, an impertinent visitor was pleased to drop in, and my hands were tied! I reflected that you could not have <hi rend="italic">got</hi> the Letter any sooner at any rate; and so, decided to write today.</p>
<p>Dear Mother, many thoughts, sure enough, were in my head all yesterday! This time Nine-and-forty years I was a small infant few hours old, lying unconscious in your kind bosom; you piously rejoicing over me,&#x2014;appointed to love me while life lasted to us both. What a time to look back, thro&#x2019; so many days, marked all with faithful labour by you, with joy and sorrow! I too could weep over them: but we will not weep, dear Mother;&#x2014;surely we may say withal as the Old Hebrew devoutly did, &#x201C;Hitherto hath the Lord helped us!&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Said by Samuel, 1 Sam. 7:12.</note> Yes; for all our sorrows and difficulties, we have not been without help;&#x2014;neither shall we be. Your poor &#x201C;lang sprawl of an ill-put-together thing,&#x201D; as you once defined me,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-08/lt-18351223-JWC-MAC-01"><sic>8:273</sic><corr>JWC to MAC, <date when="1835-12-23">23 Dec. 1835</date></corr></ref>.</note> has grown up to be a distinct Somewhat in this world; and his good mother&#x2019;s toil and travail with him was not entirely in vain. Much is come and gone; and we are still left here:&#x2014;and ought not our true effort, and endeavour more than ever, for the days that yet remain, to be even this, That we may serve the Eternal Maker of us; struggle to serve Him faithfully, Him and not the Enemies of Him! Even so.&#x2014; My ever-loved Mother, I salute you with my affection once more, and thank you for bringing me into this world, and for all your unwearied care over me there. May God reward you for it,&#x2014;as assuredly He will and does: I never can reward you!&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; &#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>
<p>Alas, here comes in another visitor;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> who falls to my lot, Jane being out: so I have to break off abruptly while my tale is but half told! I <pb id="pg-18-280" n="18:280"/>will write again before long.&#x2014; I have been curious this while to know what <hi rend="italic">winter clothing</hi> &#x26;c you had got; how you were provided in all ways for the winter;&#x2014;pray do take all care of yourself in this bad weather. We hope poor Mary is a little better (Jack always reports her so) and that you will be able to get to your own <foreign><hi rend="italic">inglenook</hi></foreign> again, which I believe is warmest for you.</p>
<p>I wrote to Alick two days ago; Jack also adding a little Note. I am as busy as I can be: I doubt not by and by but something will come of it.&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; I sent Jenny&#x2019;s money to Dumfries; and Jamie&#x2019;s of Scotsbrig, what I owed him. We are all well. The Doctor has a really nice place to live in, within a mile of us; one of the quietest, I think, in London. I go up sometimes in the evening; give him a cigar, and he attends me smoking in my walk before bedtime.&#x2014; <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Mother. My regards and blessings to you all. Ever your affectionate /</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name></p>

<salute>Dear Fitzgerald,</salute>
<p>Thanks for your Copy of the Letter. It was, as you surmised, one of Dawson Turner&#x2019;s;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dawson Turner (<date when="1775-00-00">1775</date>&#x2013;<date when="1858-00-00">1858</date>; <ref target="volume-18/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/27846"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), botanist and antiquary of Gt. Yarmouth. Known personally to FitzGerald, he possessed many historical MSS. The letter was no doubt one of Cromwell&#x2019;s in Turner&#x2019;s possession, e.g., <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 6:166&#x2013;67, 171&#x2013;74.</note> but this is more of a facsimile&#x2014;worth having too.</p>
<p>At Kimbolton<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The duke of Manchester&#x2019;s Kimbolton Castle, Hunts. The papers, now in the NLS, were lent to TC in <date when="1845-00-00">1845</date>. See Ian Campbell, &#x201C;Carlyle, Cromwell and Kimbolton,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">The Bibliotheck</hi> 5 (<date when="1970-00-00">1970</date>):246&#x2013;52.</note> I should think there must be Papers well worth sorting, if there were any one to do it. The first Earl of Manchester is in the centre of matters all thro&#x2019; the reign of James, and to the Long Parl<hi rend="italic">t</hi> time, when his Son comes into play,&#x2014;who was one of the &#x201C;Five Members&#x201D; (or rather a &#x201C;Sixth&#x201D; member he, being already in the House of Lords); who was Oliver&#x2019;s Superior Officer till <date when="1645-00-00">1645</date>;&#x2014;all along one of the most conspicuous men of those times.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henry Montagu (ca. <date when="1563-00-00">1563</date>&#x2013;<date when="1642-00-00">1642</date>), 1st earl, and Edward Montagu, 2d earl of Manchester; see <ref target="volume-17/lt-18440216-TC-HC-01">TC to [HC], <date when="1844-02-16">16 Feb.</date></ref></note> I have seen many of his Letters in the Museum &#x26;c; and the hand is very easily read. I know no Family in all England half as worthy at present of having itself brought forth into daylight as that of the Montagues, of which this Duke of Manchester is now the head.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Montagu, 6th duke, succeeded <date when="1843-00-00">1843</date>.</note> But alas it cannot be done, I suppose. They will get some wretched twaddling ignoramus to do it, if they <pb id="pg-18-281" n="18:281"/>ever try to get anybody;&#x2014;and he will do it like a <hi rend="italic">Quack;</hi> in a way worthy to be <hi rend="italic">burnt</hi>. It is very sad; but that has been the lot of the English Aristocracy that have Historical names, for a long while back. There is no Book more mournful to me than Collins&#x2019;s Peerage!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Arthur Collins, <hi rend="italic">The Peerage of England</hi> (<date when="1709-00-00">1709</date>; a definitive edn., 9 vols., <date when="1812-00-00">1812</date>).</note> I could sit down and weep in it, as in a Slaughterhouse of Heroisms. The <hi rend="italic">accursed</hi> Blockhead; representative and outcome of millions of Block-heads and Blockheadisms, sad &#x201C;consummate flower&#x201D; of unutterable woes to us!</p>
<p>It is possible some Letters of Oliver to the second Earl of Manchester may lie in those Kimbolton repositories: of course if anybody can fish me out one or a number, it will be twice and three times welcome. But I hardly expect it.</p>
<p>Rejoice you in the Country; sung to sleep by the voice of the Sea.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >FitzGerald&#x2019;s cottage in Boulge, nr. Woodbridge, at the head of a wide inlet ENE of Ipswich.</note> London is frightful; full of dust, storm and frost; jingling with tenfold noise, all being hard as iron; nothing but bluenosed cabmen in dreadful &#x201C;comforters&#x201D;&#x2014;a bluenosed ugly population generally, all the women and their carriages being imprisoned by the cold. We have almost forgotten that there ever was any Sun; any sky except a hideous Coverlid woven out of coal-soot and every unclean emanation. I liken Piccadilly often, in my thoughts as I rush along, to&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;I will not say what locality!</p>

To deny that there is such a thing as animal magnetism, and that it actually <hi rend="italic">does</hi> produce many of the phenomena here recorded is idle&#x2014;nor do I find much of this, which seems wonderful because we think of it for the first time, a whit more wonderful than those Common instances of it which have never struck us with surprise, merely because we have been used to see them all our lives&#x2014;every body for instance has seen children thrown almost into convulsions by some one <hi rend="italic">going thro the motions</hi> of tickling them!

I touched them and they felt horrid&#x2014;stiff as iron&#x2014;I could not bend them down with all my force&#x2014;they pricked her hand with the point of a penknife she felt nothing&#x2014;and now comes the strangest part of my story&#x2014; The man who regard<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> Carlyle and me as Philistines said, &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">now</hi> are you convinced?&#x201D; &#x201C;Yes said Carlyle there is no possibility of doubting but that you have stiffened all poor little Miss B&#xF6;lte there into something very awful&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;Yes said I pertly but then she <hi rend="italic">wished</hi> to be magnetized what I doubt is whether <pb id="pg-18-284" n="18:284"/>anyone could be reduced to that state without <hi rend="italic">the consent of their own volition</hi> I should like for instance to see anyone magnetize <hi rend="small-caps">me</hi>!&#x201D; &#x201C;You think I could not&#x201D;? said the man with a look of ineffable disdain&#x2014;Yes said I&#x2014;I defy you&#x201D;!&#x2014; &#x201C;Will you give me your hand <hi rend="small-caps">Miss</hi>&#x201D;? &#x201C;Oh by all means&#x201D; and I gave him my hand with the most perfect confidence in my force of volition and a smile of contempt&#x2014;he held it in one of his and with the other made what H Martineau calls some &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">passes</hi>&#x201D; over it&#x2014;as if he were darting something from his finger ends&#x2014; I looked him defiantly in the face as much as to say, you must learn to sound your <hi rend="small-caps">hs</hi> Sir before you can produce any effect on a woman like <hi rend="italic">me!</hi> and whilst this or some similar thought was passing thro&#x2019; my head&#x2014;flash&#x2014;there went over me from head to foot something precisely like what I once experienced from taking hold of a galvanic ball&#x2014;only <hi rend="italic">not nearly</hi> so violent&#x2014; I had presence of mind to keep looking him in the face as if I had felt nothing and presently he flung away my hand with a provoked look, saying &#x201C;I believe you would be a very difficult subject, but nevertheless if I had <hi rend="italic">time</hi> given me I am sure I could mesmerize you at least I never failed with any one yet.&#x201D; Now if this destroyed for me my theory of <hi rend="italic">the need of a consenting will</hi>&#x2014;it as signally destroyed <hi rend="italic">his</hi> of <hi rend="italic">moral and intellectual superiority</hi>&#x2014;for <hi rend="italic">that</hi> man was superior to <hi rend="italic">me</hi> in nothing but animal strength as I am a living woman!

<salute>Dear Jenny,</salute>
<p>I dare say you can knit <hi rend="italic">Wristikins</hi>. It has struck me in these cold days, I might as well apply to you to have a pair! The best pair I yet have is a very old pair now; which either you, or I think Jean, knit for me at Hoddam Hill, when you were little <foreign>Bairns</foreign>, many years ago.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC lived at Hoddam Hill farm, <date when="1825-00-00">1825</date>&#x2013;<date when="1826-00-00">26</date>; see <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> 280&#x2013;81.</note> They have beautiful stripes of <hi rend="italic">red</hi> yet, as fresh as ever: in fact I sometimes wear them, in preference to the pair Jane has bought for me out of the shops here.&#x2014; Being already provided, as you see, I will not in the least hurry you, as to the matter,&#x2014;wait till you have leisure, till you can get right yarn colours &#x26;c &#x26;c&#x2014;only I will tell you what kind of thing will suit me, and empower you to do it when convenient.</p>
<p>The great defect of all my present wristikin is that they are too slight, too <hi rend="italic">thin</hi>, and do not fill up the cuff of the coat, which is rather wide with me. They should be at least <hi rend="italic">double</hi> the common thickness of those in the shops. If you had fine <foreign><hi rend="italic">foozy</hi></foreign> [fluffy] yarn, and took it two-ply, it would make a pretty article! Then as to colour, it should be <hi rend="italic">deep</hi> for our <foreign>reeky</foreign> atmosphere here: red is beautiful, a stripe of good red, and holds out well; but perhaps the basis had better be some sort of brown. Please your own eye. There never was a good horse had an <hi rend="italic">ill</hi> colour.&#x2014; As to breadth. I think they should be at least <hi rend="italic">three</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Copeland gives &#x201C;inches&#x201D; as the next word, but it is not in the MS.</note></p>

<salute>Dear Lady Ashburton,</salute>
<p>Many thanks for your kind remembrance of me and my affairs. Certainly I could like well to see your Daughter Lady Bath, to see Longleat, Stonehenge, and many interesting objects in that quarter of the world!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Harriet Thynne, b. Baring (<date when="1804-00-00">1804</date>&#x2013;<date when="1892-00-00">92</date>), second da. of Lord and Lady Ashburton; m., <date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>, Henry Frederick Thynne (<date when="1797-00-00">1797</date>&#x2013;<date when="1837-00-00">1837</date>), who succeeded as 3d marquess of Bath, <date when="1837-03-00">March 1837</date>; their son John Alexander Thynne (<date when="1831-00-00">1831</date>&#x2013;<date when="1896-00-00">96</date>; <ref target="volume-18/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/27422"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>) succeeded as 4th marquess, <date when="1837-06-00">June 1837</date>. Longleat, in Wilts., the seat of the marquesses of Bath, erected late sixteenth cent., is one of the most splendid country houses in England. Stonehenge, the great prehistoric monument on Salisbury Plain, is also in Wilts.</note> The Longleat Pamphlets and Manuscripts of the Civil-War Period<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In the Old Library of Longleat along with other treasures of books and MSS.</note> might also be of use to me. I read all such, where I can lay hold of them to borrow and bring home with me; they exist in great quantities in this country; and have never yet been examined, even partially that I can find, by any faithful rational person. They are dull, unspeakably dull; rubbishy, dark; <hi rend="italic">stupid</hi>, I should say, beyond any other kind of writing that I know to exist in this world. They have near broken my heart! There are thirty or forty thousand of them lying in the British Museum, where I have spent above a hundred headaches on them: I have of late months got a formidable Scotch Clerk<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Christie.</note> who reads there for me; a rugged fellow, with a skin as thick as a rhinoceros&#x2019;s, who can read there <hi rend="italic">without</hi> headaches, without disgust and despair!&#x2014; Yet always, as I said, they are of use when I can get convenient hold of them. It is like examining a waggonload of <hi rend="italic">Marine Stores;</hi> you do, if you have gained skill in the business, pick up an old tenpenny nail, an old doorhinge, that you can turn to use in some way.</p>
<p>I must not travel westward on such an errand: but if the Marchioness have a Tutor in her house, any writing reading person, who could examine those old things for me, and send me note of them, certainly I should keep them in my eye against any day of opportunity. From such a body of <hi rend="italic">Marine Stores,</hi> seventy volumes of them, I could surely pick a nail or two.</p>
<p>In these very weeks I find my friend Cromwell busy with what they call &#x201C;the affair of Sir James Thynne.&#x201D; The &#x201C;affair of Sir James Thynne,&#x201D; since Oliver saw good to meddle with it, is not entirely a nonentity to me: I have set the Scotch rhinoceros on boring into it a little. This Sir <pb id="pg-18-287" n="18:287"/>James I think is Lord Bath&#x2019;s Ancestor,&#x2014;at least the son of his Ancestor: an uncle of that Thynne who was murdered in Pall Mall during Charles Second&#x2019;s blessed time. Perhaps there is something in the Longleat Papers about this &#x201C;affair&#x201D; of Sir James?<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sir James Thynne (<date when="1605-00-00">1605</date>&#x2013;<date when="1670-00-00">70</date>), M.P. for Wiltshire, <date when="1640-00-00">1640</date>&#x2013;ca.<date when="1644-00-00">44</date>, contested the terms of his father&#x2019;s will because he thought it gave an undue proportion of the estate to his youngest brother, Sir Henry Frederick Thynne (<date when="1615-00-00">1615</date>&#x2013;<date when="1680-00-00">80</date>), 1st bart.

Sir James&#x2019;s father, Sir Thomas Thynne, was the direct ancestor of the 4th marquess of Bath through Sir James&#x2019;s half-brother, Sir Henry Frederick.

<p>Mr Baring, we conclude, must have arrived.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Home from France.</note> There came yesterday a Letter from the Bullers, which he seemed to have been the bearer of. Our sky, he will find, is now as soft as the Sardinian people&#x2019;s, only somewhat muddier. Alas, our very sky in London here seems made of <hi rend="italic">mud,</hi> suspended mud. As to the Frost,&#x2014;you at The Grange, you, who have a Sun and Firmament of the usual sort, know little of it! The ugliest weather I had ever seen before was beautiful to that London week of Frost. The dust was whirling and howling thro&#x2019; all streets; nothing to be heard but tenfold noise and jingle; all tradition of a sky quite gone from us,&#x2014;the poor women all hidden within doors, nothing to be seen but universal Stormy Dusk, and blue-nosed Cabmen careering in it with dreadful <hi rend="italic">Comforters</hi> round their necks;&#x2014;not unlike a kind of Demons!&#x2014;</p>

<p>I will try and write to you today, tho I am fearing I shall make but a poor hand of it.</p>
<p>It is not &#x201C;well-doing&#x201D; or <hi rend="italic">doing</hi> in any shape that has hindered me from writing till now&#x2014;but that I have been laid up for two or three weeks with one of my horrid colds&#x2014; All the last week I passed drearly enough in bed&#x2014;this week I am down stairs, but still so weak and headachy that I might as well be in bed yet for anything I am good for out of it&#x2014; Of course I often wished some comfort from you&#x2014;or some any thing from you&#x2014;but as I was a letter <hi rend="italic">in your debt</hi> I had no <hi rend="italic">reasonable</hi> ground to complain&#x2014;at last however you have mustered generosity enough to write a second time&#x2014;which moves me to muster physical force enough to answer&#x2014; All this time I have written just <hi rend="italic">two</hi> letters&#x2014;one to my uncle the other night&#x2014;on first getting out of bed&#x2014;when the <hi rend="italic">excitement</hi> of the thing was making me very talkatively disposed&#x2014;and Carlyle being out at dinner the only possible talking for me was on paper&#x2014;the other to M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Buller on a very serious piece of business which could not be put off till &#x201C;a more convenient season&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Acts 24:25.</note>&#x2014; She had written from Nice in great perplexity of spirit to ask <hi rend="italic">me</hi>&#x2014;sitting here or rather <hi rend="italic">lying</hi> here in Cheyne Row Chelsea what she was to do with Miss Bolte who had lost her senses in a fever she had had and gave no promise of recovering them: Upon my honour this element of <hi rend="italic">Madness</hi> in which I seem doomed henceforth to live and move is beginning to take effect on my own sanity&#x2014; I had been very uncomfortable about poor little Bolte for several weeks having heard of this fever&#x2014;and also that she considered herself very much <hi rend="italic">neglected</hi> by the Bullers&#x2014;which it was not difficult for me to believe&#x2014; Tizzy<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Revis.</note> being ill at the same time would leave them no sympathy or cares to bestow on any one else&#x2014; The fact is while they removed with Tizzy to their villa Miss Bolte was left to transact <hi rend="italic">her</hi> sickness in a Hotel&#x2014;first on the pretence that she could not be removed (tho John Carlyle says that in no stage of that sort of fever is removal attended with the smallest risk provided it be done carefully) and afterwards on the ground that M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Bacon alias Revis&#x2014; alias &#x201C;unfortunate female&#x201D; was on a visit to M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Buller along with the <pb id="pg-18-289" n="18:289"/>Capt. Bacom<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> whom for the time being she calls <hi rend="italic">her husband!</hi><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Theresa Revis, Tizzy&#x2019;s mother, previously Arthur Buller&#x2019;s mistress (see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400224-TC-MAC-01"><sic>12:54&#x2013;55</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1840-02-24">24 Feb. 1840</date></corr></ref>), lived in the S of France. Capt. Bacon is unidentified.</note> Really, all this is a little too strong for even <hi rend="italic">my</hi> morality! I sent M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Buller all the information I had about the poor things family that she might be enabled to communicate with them as fast as possible and recommend her being if possible sent home to her own Mother&#x2014; But before this letter could be received here I have since yesterday another which states the danger to be now of her <hi rend="italic">life</hi> rather than her intellects&#x2014;any how they seem very anxious to be rid of her&#x2014;and I trust in God she will get <hi rend="italic">alive</hi> out of the mess&#x2014; M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Fleming tells me that Tizzy who is &#x201C;the most artful little Devil&#x201D; in nature has got provoked with Miss Bolte for too much repressing her premature tendencies to <hi rend="italic">unfortunate femalisings</hi> and tells M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Buller all sorts of lies to get her turned off which M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Buller is silly enough to believe&#x2014; When they <hi rend="italic">have</hi> rid themselves of Miss Bolte&#x2014;if death alas do not anticipate them&#x2014;they may turn their hand with that young lady of theirs as they like but I am no <foreign><hi rend="italic">Schupingsing</hi></foreign> if this ridding herself of the only person who has succeed in having the upper hand of her be not her first decided step towards &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">the streets</hi>&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>

<salute>Dear Mr Baring,</salute>
<p>We are greatly indebted to Lady Harriet for her humane and generous procedure in this matter; we, and all parties interested. She may say, as the Patriarch Job did in old times, &#x201C;The blessing of her that was ready to perish was upon me!&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Job 29:13.

We can now imagine to ourselves a very great improvement indeed; a clear door of deliverance opened, and no lives lost, no irreparable damage done!&#x2014; Pray call, and receive my Wife&#x2019;s thanks when you come back to Town: you will also have a great arrear of questions to answer from myself&#x2014;</p>
<p>Today I send up to Stanhope Street a poor little Book, translated from Jean Paul&#x2019;s German,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Richter, <hi rend="italic">Flower, Fruit and Thorn Pieces,</hi> trans. E. H. Noel, 2 vols. (<date when="1845-00-00">1845</date>), listed on sale in the <hi rend="italic">Athenaeum,</hi> <date when="1844-12-14">14 Dec.</date></note> which perhaps Lady Ashburton may consent to try if she can read. If you be gone, the servants will take charge of forwarding it when opportunity next serves. There is no haste about it; unluckily none whatever; if it do prove readable, that will be all, poor thing!&#x2014;</p>

<salute>Dear Miss Stirling,</salute>
<p>The Jean-Paul Book was duly forwarded to me; I have read considerable passages of it; my Wife has faithfully read it all. The Translation seems very respectably done; in a style greatly beyond the average, indeed: but it remains a very different question whether Jean Paul and it will have much success in our English Public, or only a very <pb id="pg-18-291" n="18:291"/>limited one. It is twelve years since I read these &#x201C;Flower &#x26; Pieces,&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC had apparently read <hi rend="italic">Blumen- Frucht- und Dornenst&#xfc;cke</hi> (<date when="1796-00-00">1796</date>&#x2013;<date when="1797-00-00">97</date>) in <date when="1826-00-00">1826</date> while preparing for his <hi rend="italic">German Romance;</hi> see <ref target="volume-04/lt-18260425-TC-HCR-01"><sic>4:80</sic><corr>TC to HCR, <date when="1826-04-25">25 April 1826</date></corr></ref>.</note> or looked much into Jean Paul; and I find my toleration for his peculiar way of writing has not at all grown in that period! It is really a sad sin that of not being intent, first of all, on setting forth any <hi rend="italic">meaning</hi> you may chance to have; and taking up your attention with the <hi rend="italic">way</hi> of setting it forth: God deliver us all from it! As if a man sitting down to dinner should flourish his knife and fork to shew the fine rings he wears, the fine &#x26;c &#x26;c&#x2014;instead of honestly cutting his meat with the said knife and fork!&#x2014; &#x2014; On the whole I should judge it a likelier line for Mr Noel,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edward Henry Noel not further identified.</note> that of painting of Portraits than this of translating from the German. Probably enough he might get some employment too from the Foreign Review people, or such like: but &#x201C;Literature,&#x201D; as a craft for living by, is not to be recommended to any mortal that has another.</p>
<p>Some days ago Mrs Rich surprised us here with a Gift from M. Scheffer the Painter; a mask of the face of Goethe; which, in all ways, has gratified us much.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mary Rich often visited her friend Jane Stirling in Paris and, no doubt having met Ary Scheffer through her, was asked to deliver Goethe&#x2019;s mask. TC&#x2019;s copy was made from the copy sent to Scheffer by the duke of Weimar; see <ref target="volume-18/lt-18441222-TC-LHB-01">TC to <sic>Lady HB</sic><corr>LHB</corr>, <date when="1844-12-22">22 Dec.</date></ref> In <date when="1881-00-00">1881</date> Helen Allingham listed it as hanging on the staircase to the first floor. It was then given to David Masson and is now in the Univ. of Edinburgh Lib.</note> By far the liveliest emblem I ever had of the man Goethe. This then is the face I longed most of all to see; this;&#x2014;and <hi rend="italic">it</hi> is all vanished now, and gone into Eternity; nothing remains of it but this dumb lump of lime! There is something very sad and yet very precious to me in this Gift.</p>
<p>We have cold winter weather here; I hope it is better at Paris for invalids. My poor Wife has given in, some four weeks ago; that is to say, has retired within doors, and patiently, not without some coughing and other such symptoms of distress, endeavours to expect that the Sun <hi rend="italic">will</hi> turn northward again.</p>

<p><salute>My dear Lady Harriet,&#x2014;</salute> One brief word from me today;&#x2014;which it is questionable whether I have the right to write, did not circumstances impel me. You have done a beneficent, humane and right thing; for which we are all very grateful to you here, of which I for one am very proud!</p>
<p>It is now some three weeks or more since the mad German,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Plattnauer.</note> whom you once heard me speak of, whose roamings had led him incidentally to Nice wrote to my Wife: &#x201C;Lady Harriet Baring, who is here also&#x201D; (we had some inkling of that!) &#x201C;proposes to take poor Miss B&#xF6;lte into her own house.&#x201D; Since that we have heard the same kind tidings by repeated posts; now off, now on; that it would not be necessary, that it would;&#x2014;and yesterday a Note from Mr Baring certifies us that it is definitively so arranged; that B&#xF6;lte is to go to you, so soon as she is fit to be removed; that you take charge of the poor B&#xF6;lte, and give her shelter,&#x2014;you, interposing as a goddess, since mortals will not! May you never repent it, my dear Friend;&#x2014;you never will, I think. We are very sorry for the trouble you are like to have; but that, since it proves necessary, must be undergone: your act, so far as I understand it, is a real subject of satisfaction to me.</p>
<p>In fact there have come nothing but disastrous, bad, confused news from the Buller side of Nice, ever since you wrote. As if mere &#x201C;Chaos&#x201D; had broken loose there; and the Night-Empire were threatening to break in, presided over by Unwisdom! Sickness, disaster, distraction,&#x2014;&#x201C;houses too small,&#x201D;&#x2014;dark nameless Figures occupying place there, with whom the Daughters of Light could have no communing,&#x2014;and poor B&#xF6;lte lying sick, insane, among strangers in a h&#xF4;tel; apparently sick to death,&#x2014;and no use for her recovering if she could! Of all this I pretend to understand little, except that it did seem a real bit of Chaos come again,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Othello</hi> 3.3</note> and that it was like to end as Tragedies do with the loss of life. My Wife has been in great trouble about poor B&#xF6;lte; almost daily talking of her; I daily taking upon me to assert as if I saw it: &#x201C;Well, there is one person there who will not see the utmost extremities arrive without interfering in some right and generous way to see Humanity and Reason take effect in the sphere she inhabits!&#x201D; And so it proves. Very <pb id="pg-18-293" n="18:293"/>pleasant it has been to me, <foreign>Ma Dame</foreign> [My Lady], to figure you all along as a Beam of Light in that miserable element of Darkness; spreading round you what of order, settlement, humanity, good sense and nobleness was possible there. My blessings on you;&#x2014;mine, and those of the afflicted and the stranger that was forsaken within your Gates!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Deut. 5:14.</note> Poor Fleming, who seems to come here every Sunday (tho&#x2019; I keep carefully up stairs), says, &#x201C;It is a noble trait of Lady Harriet&#x201D;:&#x2014; Yes, Fleming, my man. In fact, we are all most grateful to the said Lady, and some of us, as I mentioned before, are partly proud of her in a silent way.</p>
<p>What you are to do with poor B&#xF6;lte will, I suppose, gradually become clearer. I fear she cannot but be somewhat in your way: for Heaven&#x2019;s sake let not her interfere with <hi rend="italic">your</hi> health, or the means towards it! I think, in black days, &#x201C;There is but one thing wanting now: to hear that <hi rend="italic">she</hi> is fallen unwell!&#x201D;&#x2014; B&#xF6;lte seemed to me always a decisive, hardy, useful-looking, clear-sighted nimble little creature;&#x2014;in whom there were utilities of many kinds, and nothing to be noted but utilities and general wholesomeness of mind. I have of late begun to apprehend there might be some hysterical flaw in her constitution; the Mesmeric phenomena first set me upon this:<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-18/lt-18441213-JWC-JWE-01">JWC to <sic>JW</sic><corr>JWE</corr>, <date when="1844-12-13">13 Dec.</date></ref></note> I remember also having noted, with amazement in one so calm and practical, some mad notion she seemed to have of getting to be Governess in the Queen&#x2019;s House itself: some <foreign><hi rend="italic">K&#xE4;mmerfrau</hi></foreign> [Lady in waiting] or the like had given her a Letter to some Dutchess which, Bolte was of opinion, surely should and would carry it! This has often recurred to me since I saw that Mesmeric Operation. I have also noticed a certain want of reticence in B&#xF6;lte. But I believe she has firstrate talents for teaching, and is a thoroughly honest creature. What drawbacks there are, and what good possibilities for her, what you are wisely to do with her while she remains with you; all this your own discernment will teach you far better than I or mine ever could. And so I will leave it with you; very confident that some good will come of the matter, begun as it has been, carried on as it is like to be.&#x2014; Well, it is beautiful to be a Queen:&#x2014;but there are few that can do it, even when the <hi rend="italic">equipments</hi> for the office are all there! Alas, the equipments will do little, when the Queen&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">self</hi> is not there!&#x2014;</p>
<p>One good result I anticipate from this good deed: that you will now actually learn German. It is a thing I wish you to do, as you have many times heard from me; it is perhaps really worth your doing! There is no reading elsewhere in the least comparable to German for <pb id="pg-18-294" n="18:294"/>one like you. Reading elsewhere is but a very questionable matter, for most part! Maurice the Puseyite Clergyman<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In fact, F. D. Maurice was at times an outspoken opponent of E. B. Pusey and other Tractarians.</note> and I were agreed, the other night, that it might be a real benefit if one generation of Englishmen were fairly born <hi rend="italic">dumb</hi>, or could have their tongues all cut out, and be totally debarred the use of pen and ink,&#x2014;that so they might try what of wisdom Nature did acknowledge to <hi rend="italic">be</hi> in them, not what of plausibility and frothy talk about wisdom a poor longeared quack-ridden Public could be persuaded to regard as wise! This, you will admit, was a bold expedient.</p>
<p>But in regard to German let me tell you of a small godsend that came to me the other day. It is a Mask of Goethe&#x2019;s Face; taken after death, they say; but they have altered the lips and eyes so that it looks like life;&#x2014;and is indeed the liveliest representation of the man to me that I have ever yet seen. One Scheffer a Paris Painter sent it, whom I had not personally known before. The Duke of Weimar,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Karl Friedrich (<date when="1783-00-00">1783</date>&#x2013;<date when="1853-00-00">1853</date>), grand duke of Saxe-Weimar, <date when="1828-00-00">1828</date>&#x2013;<date when="1853-00-00">53</date>.</note> it seems, sent a copy to Scheffer, and Scheffer made this for me. Many thanks to him. I look with an indescribable feeling into this actual facsimile of the face of a man that was so important to me. Thus was it; thus is it not no more;&#x2014;it has vanished away again, there remains nothing of it but this dumb lump of lime! We are such stuff as Dreams are made of. We need not go to Mesmerism for miracles!&#x2014; I hope you will like this face of Goethe; and call it with me a King&#x2019;s face. &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Voil&#xE0; un homme qui a eu beaucoup de chagrins</hi></foreign> [There is a man who has had many sorrows],&#x201D; said the Frenchman on looking at it. Not properly chagrin, said Goethe, but hard work as he went along.</p>
<p>Of myself at present, still less of the world round me, I can tell you nothing. I have &#x201C;chagrins&#x201D; enough in that sense; but they amount to little, for myself or others. I am very solitary, not willingly idle. My beautiful Blotting-book receives very little from me; the more is my sorrow! Yet I do put leaves into it; I kiss its hands (in imagination), and wish there were more. You must be patient with me; in time I shall do better. It is such a piece of work as I never tried in this world before. I do at least sit solitary; encompassed only with <hi rend="italic">shadows</hi> dead and living.&#x2014; Pusey<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Philip Pusey.</note> came in to me one day: it was in our tempestuous frost; he had come to the Cattleshow, where our poor Prince gained the prize for pigs.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Prince Albert (<date when="1819-00-00">1819</date>&#x2013;<date when="1861-00-00">61</date>; <ref target="volume-18/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/274"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), the Queen&#x2019;s husband, obtained the second prize for pigs, <date when="1844-12-11">11 Dec.</date>, at the annual Smithfield Club Cattle Show of oxen, sheep, plgs, and other farm animals, held at the Horse Bazaar, Portman Sq.

He was too polite to press his Christmas upon me; but signified that Bunsen &#x26;c Alas, Bunsen is not beautiful to me! We parted with the mutual wish to meet again.</p>
<p>Not of myself, but of yourself, my Lady! I have a thousand things I want to know;&#x2014;which you will tell me when the good hour comes! I do not need Letters to keep you in my mind,&#x2014;not that at any rate: neither do I think you have forgotten me when you are silent. I tell you again, your silences are more eloquent than any other person&#x2019;s words! Write when it is not a trouble to you; I will be patient and thankful.</p>
<p>For one thing can you spend a word for me upon the Brougham business;<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unexplained. Lord Brougham spent the winter months in Cannes, nr.

<salute>My dear Sir</salute>
<p>Mrs Rich delivered me the Mask of Goethe which you were so very kind as send me by her. I have fixed it advantageously on one of my Bookshelves, where daily, for a long while I hope, it will remind me in a beneficent manner of you and of him. Many thanks are due from me. This is, of all the portraits, medals &#x26;c which I have seen of Goethe, by far the most eloquent representation of him to me: a strange shadow of the very face itself, as it looked and lived in this world; a veritable fragment of the Past Appearances (to me the most important of them all for some centuries), strangely surviving here, now when they are gone, all melted into Formlessness again, into the Still Sea again! It is very tragic, very significant to me.</p>
<p>I return you many thanks; all the more grateful as I have not yet the happiness of being personally known to you. Your great Art with all its resources could hardly have furnished me a more interesting Product than this very simple one. For one does ask of your Art this fundamental question: How did great Men, and great Phenomena which we have never seen, look? This answered, if it ever could be completely answered, all were answered that the Plastic Artist has in charge. Your Gift is very valuable, and greatly enhanced by the kindness of your procedure to me in respect of it.</p>
<p>If you ever come to England I shall bespeak the pleasure of making acquaintance with you; as certainly, if I ever come again to Paris, I will not fail to go in quest of one so favourably shadowed forth to me in this and in many more important ways.</p>

<salute>Dear Jean,</salute>
<p>I have had a small message to send you these three days, and every day have been disappointed of time to do it in: I take the top of the morning today, and send it you the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> thing.</p>
<p>Poor Mary at Gill is evidently in a very weakly way, not likely to gather any real fund of strength till the sunny weather come again. It strikes me that all the prescriptions she could use do not together amount in effect to this one: keeping her skin rightly warm. Jack is agreed with me in thinking so. What I want of you therefore is, To get her two complete suits of interior flannel clothing,&#x2014;knit stocking work will be best: I mean two pair of knit drawers, two knit flannel shirts;&#x2014;one suit to wash the other. Pray get these for her, and send them out with my injunctions as soon as possible. You will buy them with your best skill; a good warm article: then send me the account of the price, and I will exactly pay you.&#x2014; This is my message.</p>
<p>I have hardly time to add a word more. We are very busy indeed, and somewhat sorrowful that our work prospers no better! We must try it again; we must stand to it thro&#x2019; fair weather and foul;&#x2014;by Heaven&#x2019;s grace, we shall perhaps get it done at last.</p>
<p>Jack is off in these days to the County of Durham! His old Italian Friend, Mr Rainie,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Rainey, whom John Carlyle had visited in Darlington in <date when="1844-06-00">June</date>.</note> whom he visited in coming up to you last summer, is at present in a low way; he invites Jack to come and see him as a Doctor, offering a fee of &#xa3;20: Jack is off accordingly on Wednesday night last; is to return in about a week. He dined here, his Christmas dinner, and then drove away.</p>
<p>I have got a cold three days ago; but by vigorous exertion have already subdued it somewhat. Poor Jane cannot so well subdue hers; She has not been across the threshold for a month; she struggles away wonderfully nevertheless,&#x2014;considerably better than she once was. Our weather is abundantly ungenial. Wild ringing frost, all flying with detestable <hi rend="italic">dust</hi> too and <foreign><hi rend="italic">reek;</hi></foreign> then foggy thaw,&#x2014;as in these two days,&#x2014;with all the smoke and dirt of London hurled over our heads; and a <pb id="pg-18-298" n="18:298"/>kind of dark <hi rend="italic">damp</hi> freezing temperature, <hi rend="italic">colder</hi> to the skin than Russia is! We keep good fires; and resist, outwardly and inwardly, the best we can.</p>
<p>I learned indirectly by Jenny that you had got the Bank draft, and that all was right there Our Mother and Jenny were to go from Gill on Monday last; I hope the weather did not prove too bitter for our Mother.&#x2014; Your <foreign>Bairns</foreign>, I fear, are still a little <foreign>feckless</foreign> [weak]? <closer><salute>Take care of yourself and them! My blessings with all of you.&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; In great haste</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dearest Helen</salute>
<p>Your kind letter and gift along with a packet from Babbie were brought up to me in bed <hi rend="italic">yesterday</hi> morning with my breakfast&#x2014;at an hour when there is no post from either Liverpool or Scotland!&#x2014; Today I have ascertained the meaning&#x2014;your&#x2019;s had been <hi rend="italic">missent to Camberwell!</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Suburb S of the Thames.</note> and, the post men having half a holiday on Christmas, Babbie&#x2019;s packet having arrived by the afternoon post was not delivered till the following morning Provoking enough that my dear little cousins should have been thus hindered in their good thought to enliven my Christmas day&#x2014;but so far as myself was concerned I am not sure that I was not a gainer by having the pleasure arrive so &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">promiscuously</hi>&#x201D;&#x2014; Kindness is kindness on the <date when="0000-12-26">26<hi rend="italic">th</hi> of December</date> all the same as on the <date when="0000-12-25">25<hi rend="italic">th</hi></date>&#x2014;and at that unusual hour of the morning it came with the additional charm of a most <hi rend="italic">complete surprise</hi>. Nay as to <hi rend="italic">Babbie</hi> the <hi rend="italic">surprise</hi> was at the same time a prodigious <hi rend="italic">relief</hi>&#x2014; I had made myself <hi rend="italic">sure</hi> of a letter from <hi rend="italic">her</hi> on Christmas day. She had not failed to write to me a long long letter every Christmas day. <hi rend="italic">since we knew each other</hi>, and when none came&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">only</hi> a letter from Geraldine and another from Plattnauer I had been so vexed with her so provoked that she should let herself be &#x201C;the victim of circumstances&#x201D; to <hi rend="italic">such a questionable length</hi>&#x2014;so convinced from this <hi rend="italic">last trait of her indolence</hi> that she was a Babbie all spilt on the ground and that could not be gathered! that I could really have cried&#x2014;nay I am not sure but I did cry a little&#x2014;certainly I did vent my <pb id="pg-18-299" n="18:299"/>spleen in flinging poor Geraldines letter into the fire&#x2014;of course after reading it. And to find that after all my Babbie had <hi rend="italic">not</hi> &#x201C;failed in her truth&#x201D;&#x2014;that it was merely her Majesty&#x2019;s postmen who had had a half-Holyday &#x2014;Oh I assure the <hi rend="italic">relief</hi> to my &#x201C;finer sensibilities of the heart&#x201D; was considerable! And to find that <hi rend="italic">you</hi> also my good girl had been thinking of me, <hi rend="italic">working</hi> for me&#x2014;and to such beautiful purpose&#x2014;that little letter-case delights me in every sense&#x2014;one would say you had <hi rend="italic">read the essay</hi> I wrote for my own edification some time ago on <hi rend="italic">Lady&#x2019;s work!</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Untraced.</note> wherein I lamented over the quantity of time which women fling away in producing results which a little taste and ingenuity could produce in what one calls &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">no time</hi>&#x201D;&#x2014;had you leaned over an embroidery frame for half a year you could not have produced a <hi rend="italic">prettier</hi> letter-case or one more to my liking than this same&#x2014;and the little memorandum book seemed also sent in the spirit of divination&#x2014;as repeatedly of late&#x2014;(before I was confined to the house) I had been saying to myself on finding that I had forgotten half the odds and ends I had gone out for to seek &#x201C;certainly I ought to buy myself a memorandum book!&#x201D; Thank you Dear and a hearty kiss to you&#x2014;your pains have not failed in the object&#x2014;to give me pleasure</p>
<p>I had another surprise&#x2014;very great&#x2014;on the Christmas day&#x2014;almost &#x201C;too great <hi rend="italic">for anything</hi>&#x201D; in fact&#x2014; You know I dare say Carlyles sacred horror of shopping&#x2014; To such an extent had he brought it that he could never be induced to order even his own coats and trowsers at the tailors until three or four years ago that having sent me to get him a coat; I ordered one <hi rend="italic">sky blue</hi> with <hi rend="italic">yellow buttons</hi> which made him &#x201C;an ornament to society in every direction&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18351026-JWC-TC-01"><sic>8:245</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1835-10-26">26 Oct. 1835</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014;and quite shook his faith in my judgement (he told me) &#x201C;so far as <hi rend="italic">the dressing of him</hi> was concerned&#x201D;&#x2014; You may imagine then what a thing it must be for a man thus puzzled to buy his own <hi rend="italic">indispensables</hi> when he has not only to buy but devise <hi rend="italic">a present</hi> for some one&#x2014; Accordingly he never dreamt of making me presents till in these last three years that a most kind and considerate motive has induced him to <hi rend="italic">give me something</hi> on birthdays and newyears days&#x2014;but the pleasure of receiving his little gifts is always spoiled for me by thinking of the plague he must have had in realizing them&#x2014;with such a habit of mind! So I asked him the other day to promise that he would do what I asked without knowing what it was&#x2014;on assurance that the thing was easy and rational&#x2014;and then when he had promised&#x2014;I told him he was not <hi rend="italic">to give me anything on new years day!</hi> He laughed very much and repeated that he would not&#x2014; But to reconcile his promise with his wish to show his <pb id="pg-18-300" n="18:300"/>kindness&#x2014;what does he do but sally forth and buy me a present for Christmas and in a fit of audacity almost incredible the thing he chose to buy was&#x2014;a cloak!&#x2014;a womans cloak!&#x2014;and when he came in on Christmas morning to ask how I was he cunningly slipt it down on the chair at the bottom of my bed where I first noticed it when I was putting on my clothes at midday it happened that just at that moment I was thinking of the warm dressing-gown which was to be sent <hi rend="italic">him</hi> every Christmas by <hi rend="italic">her</hi><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Her mother.</note>&#x2014;and all the flannel petticoats and night-caps and thoughtful things of her own making for myself; my heart was full of sorrow&#x2014;and just then I saw on the chair what seemed a new dressing-gown&#x2014;like the former ones&#x2014;there was something perfectly bewildering in the vision&#x2014;I stood staring at the thing uncertain if I was going mad and merely <hi rend="italic">fancying to see it</hi>. At last in a sort of desperation I laid hold of it and found it was a woman&#x2019;s cloak&#x2014;and then I understood the whole matter&#x2014;but I was made horribly sad and nervous by it for the whole day. Poor Carlyle! his gift deserved to have excited gladder feelings&#x2014;however I did my best to <hi rend="italic">look glad</hi> over it before him&#x2014; And he was much consoled by my assurance that <hi rend="italic">it would be worn</hi>&#x2014; He had bought it &#x201C;by <hi rend="italic">gass light</hi>&#x201D; he said&#x2014;and &#x201C;felt quite desperate about it when he saw it in the morning&#x201D;&#x2014; But it is a wonderful cloak for <hi rend="italic">him</hi> to have bought&#x2014;warm, and not <hi rend="italic">very</hi> ugly&#x2014;and a good shape&#x2014;only entirely unsuitable to the rest of my habiliments! being a <hi rend="italic">brownish colour</hi> with <hi rend="italic">orange spots</hi> and a brown-velvet collar!!</p>

<p>I have to ask your pardon for I did you a great injustice&#x2014; When the Christmas day <hi rend="italic">brought no letter</hi> from you I said to myself&#x2014;&#x201C;Well&#x2014;that girl &#x201C;is gone all to sticks&#x201D;!&#x2014; The Devil of Indolence has got entire possession of her&#x2014;and it is of no use for me to depend on <hi rend="italic">her</hi> for any portion of my earthly happiness any more&#x201D;&#x2014; Ah! and it was not that Babbie was <hi rend="italic">indolent</hi> or <hi rend="italic">inconstant</hi>, but simply that on Christmas-day our London post-men have half a holiday&#x2014;so that your packet arriving by the afternoon mail was not delivered till the following morning!&#x2014; One would say the Devil had a particular pleasure in spiting me on that day&#x2014;for in addition to this <foreign><hi rend="italic">contre-temps</hi></foreign>, just think of a packet from Helen being <hi rend="italic">missent to Camberwell</hi> and thus also arriving only on the following morning! The two were laid on my bed together&#x2014;along with my breakfast on the <date when="1844-12-26">26<hi rend="italic">th</hi></date>&#x2014; But all&#x2019;s well that ends well&#x2014; So bless you my Babbie for <hi rend="italic">not</hi> having &#x201C;gone over to the dragons,&#x201D; thanks for your letter and for the beautiful piece of netting which I am all the better pleased with, that you did <hi rend="italic">not</hi> work it <hi rend="italic">yourself!</hi>&#x2014; What <hi rend="italic">Charity children</hi> do with their time and their eyesight poor things is of less moment to me than what <hi rend="italic">you</hi> do with yours&#x2014;the thing is beautiful anyhow and a vast improvement on what had been over the green chair of late weeks&#x2014;not yours&#x2014;but one of a couple knitted for me by poor M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Fraser&#x2014;and oh so <hi rend="italic">substantial</hi>&#x2014;one might wear them sewed together instead of a flannel petticoat&#x2014; M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Fraser after her <hi rend="italic">crim con</hi> business took to knitting, poor soul, as a sedative&#x2014;and brought me these things one day with an air of self complacency quite curious to behold, when one thought of her having been the heroine of a scandalous Romance&#x2014;never was there such a Heroine&#x2014;a woman whose whole soul is centered in discovering the cheapest way of buying coals and potatoes and in making her old gowns into the utmost possible number of frocks for her children!</p>

<salute>Dear Lady Ashburton,</salute>
<p>I have to return you many thanks for your kind present of Game. The brace of Hares, the beautiful pair of Pheasants&#x2014;they have fallen into the hands of their enemies, they will never see the light of the Sun in Grange Woods any more!&#x2014; When you are writing to Longleat, and have a Cover that is light-loaded, you can introduce this accompanying sheet for Lady Bath. I searched out the matter for my own sake; and have written a Copy of it for yours.</p>
<p>We are beyond measure busy here;&#x2014;sunk in Colds &#x26;c withal. My Wife has been prisoner these four weeks, ever since the Frost began; I too, at length, imprudently gave way.</p>
<p>Mr Baring called here yesterday, but unluckily found nothing; I mean to go to Stanhope Street today, and try whether I can find anything.</p>
<p><closer><salute>With many kind regards to Lord Ashburton many kind remembrances to the heterodox Miss Baring and her Sister<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Louisa and Lydia Emily Baring, respectively.</note></salute></closer></p>

<ps><p>[TC&#x2019;S NOTES ENCLOSED]</p>
<p>Sir James Thynne Kn<hi rend="italic">t</hi>, of Longleat, sat in the Long Parliament for Wilts. In D&#x2019;Ewes&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Ms</hi> Journal of that Parliament, fol. 637 a (now among the Harley <hi rend="italic">Mss</hi> in the British Museum), stands this entry:</p>
<p>&#x2018;Tuesday, <date when="1641-06-01">1 june 1641</date>.&#x2014; Upon Mr Cromwell&#x2019;s motion it was ordered that &#x2018;Sir James Thinne should be here on Friday next, to shew cause concerning his Brother.&#x2019;</p>
<p><pb id="pg-18-303" n="18:303"/>On searching the matter farther, I find that this Sir James had two younger Brothers; one a full Brother, Thomas, who succeeded him in the Estates, whose son (also Thomas) made important improvements, avenues &#x26;c, in the grounds at Longleat, and is the same Thomas Thynne who was assassinated in his Carriage on London Streets in <date when="1682-00-00">1682</date>. The other younger Brother of Sir James was Henry Frederic Thynne, a <hi rend="italic">half</hi>-brother (by a different mother): he, the old Dryasdust Peerages inform me, had Queen Anne of Denmark, James the First&#x2019;s Queen, for godmother; &#x2018;the christening was <date when="1613-03-01">1 March 1613</date>&#x2013;<date when="1614-00-00">4</date>,&#x2019; and she gave him the name Frederick because it was her Father the King of Denmark&#x2019;s. It is of this Henry Frederick that the present Family descend. It is of him that the above Entry in D&#x2019;Ewes&#x2019;s Journal treats; he is the &#x2018;Brother,&#x2019; whom, on Oliver Cromwell&#x2019;s motion, Sir James Thynne the Hon. Member is ordered to come and &#x2018;shew cause concerning.&#x2019; &#x2018;On Friday next&#x2019;; that was the order;&#x2014;but there came nothing of it &#x2018;on friday next&#x2019;; nothing definite comes till the <date when="1641-07-20">20<hi rend="italic">th</hi> of july</date> next, when in D&#x2019;Ewes&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Ms</hi>&#x2014;again (folio 7920.) there is this Notice, sufficiently explanatory of the affair:</p>
<p>&#x2018;Tuesday, <date when="1641-07-20">20 july, 1641</date>. The case was in debate between Sir James Thynne, eldest son of Sir Thomas Thynne deceased, and Sir H. F. Thynne younger (youngest) son of the said Sir Thomas. There had been a suit between them in the Court of Wards, for two years past, concerning certain lands in the possession of the Younger Brother. The elder Brother being to find his office (I have no notion what this means; but it is repeatedly mentioned, &#x2018;find his office,&#x2019; and is clearly some law-operation analogous to taking seisin &#x26;c), had often moved for the Younger to bring in the Writings for those Lands; and had gotten near upon twenty several Orders to that effect: and the younger Brother had as many orders to hold the possession. (A complicated Lawsuit!)</p>
<p>&#x2018;Since this Parliament began, there was one Order made (in the Court of Wards, namely) that the said writings should be brought in by the Younger, <hi rend="italic">and</hi> that the possession of the Lands should still continue in him. Now Sir James Thynne, being a Member of this House, had taken advantage of the first part of the same (said) Order; and had copied out divers of the Writings which were brought into the same (said) Court (of Wards, to wit). But as to the <hi rend="italic">second</hi> part of the same Order, whereby his Brother&#x2019;s possessions were to be continued to him, <hi rend="italic">that</hi> he would avoid, by alledging his privilege in this House (He cannot be arrested, compelled by constables &#x26;c; he pleads this in the Court of Wards). By which doing, many of the House (Oliver Cromwell, for one) conceived he did unjustly: and the question was <pb id="pg-18-304" n="18:304"/>Whether the Privilege of the House should extend to this particular or not? It was argued long; and when we were ripe for the question, it was moved by three or four, That the affair might be referred to a Committee to set it right and report.&#x2019; &#x2018;Myself and others moved to put the question <foreign><hi rend="italic">super totam materiam</hi></foreign> [above all other matters]; for &#x201C;referring&#x201D; such questions was only to bring on a new discussion at the Report. I said: &#x201C;Were it my case, I should say to the Gentlemen below (and then I looked at Sir James Thynne who sat a little beneath me on the same form), I would <hi rend="italic">not</hi> use the privilege.&#x201D; But Sir James Thynne, having made divers friends in the House&#x2019;&#x2014;was inclined to have his Committee, and on a division of the House, got it (see Commons Journals II.217); Cromwell is one of the Committee, Whitlocke, Hyde (Clarendon), Culpepper &#x26;c are others.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Bulstrode Whitelocke; Edward Hyde, 1st earl of Clarendon; presumably Nicholas Culpeper (<date when="1616-00-00">1616</date>&#x2013;<date when="1654-00-00">54</date>), who fought on the parliamentary side although not a member of the Long Parliament. TC does not mention Thynne in <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi>.</note></p>
<p>This is the record by D&#x2019;Ewes concerning &#x2018;the affair of Sir James Thynne,&#x2019; which meets one now and then in those old regions of inquiry. As the County was just about breaking out into much graver &#x2018;affairs,&#x2019; and &#x2018;law-suits&#x2019; not to be settled except by sharp steel,&#x2014;as the Court of Wards itself was abolished; and as both Sir James and Sir Henry Frederick went off, next year, to join King Charles,&#x2014;I conclude that <hi rend="italic">their</hi> law-suit fell asleep, and was never settled at all. Both of them had to &#x2018;compound for their estates&#x2019; as vanquished Delinquents when the civil war was over,&#x2014;Sir Henry Frederick, especially, did not get the business ended for ten years afterwards, and, I think, was in a kind of trouble all along till the Restoration. What &#x2018;laws&#x2019; it was that these two Brothers were in suit about,&#x2014;this, and the whole particulars of their Estates generally, and of the Delinquent Percentages and Penalties they had to pay on them in settling with the Commonwealth, are all still to be found (rather in orderly condition, I believe) in Her Majesty&#x2019;s State-Paper Office,&#x2014;were it worth anybody&#x2019;s while to inquire. What the litigated &#x2018;lands&#x2019; were is of the less moment, as they all came together again into the Family, and are now peaceably possessed, I suppose, by the same. Sir James had no male descendants; he entailed his properties upon the children of his Brother Thomas; failing which line, upon those of his Brother Henry Frederick,&#x2014;who, as it proves, has a lineal successor in the present Marquess of Bath.</p>
<p>This old glimpse of the Thynne Family and its affairs was of a certain small significance to me, because Oliver Cromwell in the summer of <date when="1641-00-00">1641</date> entertained in his mind a wish to see justice done in respect <pb id="pg-18-305" n="18:305"/>of it. If in any other point of view, it can have any small or smallest significance to other parties interested, it is much at their service.</p>

<p><salute>Oh Babbie! my dear Babbie!</salute> I am thoroughly ashamed of myself&#x2014; &#x2014;Carlyle put my letter of yesterday in the post office on his way to the Bank&#x2014; On his return from that august place he proceeded to pull out <hi rend="italic">your</hi> pocketbook full of notes&#x2014;and while counting them, said to me, &#x201C;You told Jeanie how much I was pleased with her gift? it is really very pretty and <hi rend="italic">convenient</hi>&#x2014;poor little Babbie! it was very kind of her to take so much trouble for her Parent&#x201D;!&#x2014; My whole answer was &#x201C;Oh mercy&#x201D;! &#x201C;Mercy What&#x201D; said he&#x2014;&#x201C;Why I did not say a single word about the pocketbook&#x201D;!&#x2014; &#x201C;That was certainly a most extraordinary piece of negligence&#x201D; said he with such a <hi rend="italic">grave</hi> look!&#x2014; &#x201C;Will you <hi rend="italic">take</hi> <hi rend="small-caps">the trouble</hi> to thank her for it now then by the very next post&#x201D;&#x2014; &#x2014;I was vexed enough at myself without <hi rend="italic">his</hi> being cross about it&#x2014; &#x2014;the fact was, not only the pocket-book but the <hi rend="italic">man</hi> had entirely got themselves crushed out of my head by the confusion I was in yesterday&#x2014;confusion of soul I mean&#x2014;to be sure ones soul <hi rend="italic">ought</hi> to be above its <hi rend="italic">circumstances</hi> ought to keep <hi rend="italic">calm</hi>&#x2014;whatever else&#x2014;well I made amends by being very calm last night or rather this morning under circumstances of the most astounding nature&#x2014; About one in the morning not having been yet asleep and being as is common with me just now extremely <hi rend="italic">fidgety</hi> I gave my large square pan of hot-water a peevish push with my foot, which sent it right over the bed!&#x2014;where by the sound it gave in falling I knew that it had broken in pieces&#x2014;and all the hot water flooding my carpet!&#x2014;perhaps penetrating the parlour ceiling! and having turned into <hi rend="italic">ink</hi> in the process (as had once before happened to me) dripping down on my span new brussels carpet beneath! Distraction was in the thought&#x2014; I sprang over the bed and rang my bell furiously&#x2014;twice to bring up Helen&#x2014;who however being in bed did not see any propriety in coming tho&#x2019; I might have been <hi rend="italic">dying</hi> for anything she knew&#x2014; Carlyle however who was still <pb id="pg-18-306" n="18:306"/>below, reading, came with &#x201C;a certain&#x201D; deliberation&#x2014;and found me standing in my night clothes with the fragments of crokery and a lake of water at my naked feet&#x2014; So soon as I had light I got all the towels in the room and flung them down into the lake&#x2014;and then got down on my knees to soak it up&#x2014; Carlyle went like a sensible man for his bason and large sponge&#x2014;and fell to it more effectually with that ordering <hi rend="italic">me</hi> into bed&#x2014;but alas when I turned to go, I found my nightshift all dripping!&#x2014;had to take another un-aired from the drawer! and after I was in bed found that it had &#x201C;most <hi rend="italic">mistairously</hi>&#x201D; got wetted also&#x2014; Carlyle brought me <hi rend="italic">his small</hi> bottle&#x2014;and once more all was quiet&#x2014;except <hi rend="italic">my heart</hi> which went on at a fine rate for hours&#x2014;</p>
<p>Today of course I have more cold&#x2014;but not so much as was to have been anticipated&#x2014; I asked Helen when she came in in the morning if she had not heard the bell, &#x201C;Oh heard it?&#x201D; said she &#x201C;how could she miss hearing it?&#x201D; And why then did not she come?&#x2014;&#x201C;before she had <hi rend="italic">got her clothes on</hi> she heard M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle go up&#x2014;so she <hi rend="italic">thought that I had fainted</hi>&#x2014;and since <hi rend="italic">he</hi> was there there could be no use for <hi rend="italic">her&#x201D;!</hi></p>
<p>Cool!&#x2014;and not over-logical&#x2014; But she will make up for it <hi rend="italic">by going into fits</hi> the next time that I <hi rend="italic">faint in the day time</hi></p>
<p>Mazzini asked the other day if there was <hi rend="italic">any change in Miss Welsh&#x2019;s social position</hi>&#x2014;as in case there was none he would write to her at the new year&#x2014; &#x2014;I gave him the address of Auchtertool&#x2014;not knowing then that you had left<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For Glasgow.</note>&#x2014;</p>

<salute>My dearest M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Russel</salute>
<p>I send a money order for a sovereign to be given as heretofore and I know you will not grudge the trouble or any trouble I impose on you&#x2014; I send also a collar for Margaret and a worsted handkerchief for old Mary&#x2014; Such handkerchiefs are probably more common in Thornhill than in London&#x2014;but Mary will find one sent to her <hi rend="italic">all the way from London</hi>, and direct from me, infinitely superior to a better bought <pb id="pg-18-307" n="18:307"/>at her own door. And old Mary is not the only person in this world who thinks that &#x201C;far fowls have fair feathers.&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Proverbial.</note></p>
<p>I have still to thank you for your last interesting letter&#x2014; If you only knew with what eagerness I read all sorts of news about Thornhill, you would think nothing that happens there too insignificant to tell me. Here, we are going on as usual except that for the last five weeks I have been shut up in the house, having speedily fallen a victim to &#x201C;the inclemency of the season.&#x201D; But I am now so far recovered, that I feel no other inconvenience from my illness but some cough, which hinders me from breathing with all the freedom I could wish, and for which besides keeping the house I &#x201C;feel it my duty&#x201D; to breakfast in bed&#x2014;a thing I mortally dislike doing as it knocks the eye out of ones day. Another inconvenience I may mention which you a good housewife will sympathise with me in&#x2014;<foreign>viz</foreign>: that I find myself <hi rend="italic">running out of every thing</hi> even to tapes and threads&#x2014;my husband not being one of those Ladies-men who can do my shopping for me and there being no one else at hand just now to do it! My husband truly would almost as soon have an affair with a mad dog as with a Cockney-shopman! to such a pitch of sacred horror had he brought this reluctance that <hi rend="italic">I</hi> used to have to order even his own coats and trousers at the tailors!&#x2014;till some four years ago that being sent to choose him a coat I chose one <hi rend="italic">sky blue</hi> with glorious yellow buttons, which made him &#x201C;an ornament to society in every direction&#x201D; and quite shook his faith in my judgement he said, &#x201C;so far at least as the dressing of <hi rend="italic">him</hi> was concerned.&#x201D; Since then he has bought his own clothes very nicely; for it was not the want of <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;judgement&#x201D;</hi> which hindered him so much as the want of will&#x2014;nay the other day he had the incredible audacity to buy <hi rend="italic">me</hi> a cloak&#x2014;actually <hi rend="italic">a womans cloak</hi> for a christmas-present! and a very world-like cloak it is I assure you&#x2014;warm and sober and a good shape! so <hi rend="italic">in case of necessity</hi> he may even by and by learn to buy tapes and threads!</p>
<p>I had a letter from Liverpool the other day with good enough accounts of my Uncle&#x2014;he seems to be standing this winter better than he did the last&#x2014;Jeannie and Maggie are gone to Glasgow and will soon I suppose return home&#x2014; You did not tell me anything about Margaret Hiddlestone in your last letter&#x2014; Let me know how she is going on&#x2014;and if her little girls grow rapidly big&#x2014;I never renounce the idea of having <hi rend="italic">her</hi> about me some time or other if we both live long enough&#x2014; At all events she must bring up one of her little daughters to take care of me when I am old!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jessie Hiddlestone, one of her das., became JWC&#x2019;s maid in <date when="1865-07-00">July 1865</date>.</note>&#x2014;should I live to be old&#x2014;which <pb id="pg-18-308" n="18:308"/>to say the truth I do not think very probable&#x2014;I have still the same little Helen for servant who tugs on better and worse, never within many degrees of being a <hi rend="italic">perfect</hi> Maid-of-all-work, but <hi rend="italic">tolerable</hi> on the whole&#x2014;and I always go on keeping her longer, chiefly because <hi rend="italic">I have kept her</hi> so long.</p>
<p>What is your husband saying to this new gospel of Animal Magnetism? we here are sick of hearing about it.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Besides Martineau&#x2019;s articles and the attack on them (<date when="1844-12-28">28 Dec.</date>), the <hi rend="italic">Athenaeum</hi> printed many adverts, for books on mesmerism in <date when="1844-12-00">Dec.</date></note> Harriet Martineau expects that the whole system of medecine is going to be flung to the dogs presently, and that henceforth instead of Physicians we are to have <hi rend="italic">Magnetizers!</hi> May be so! but &#x201C;I as one solitary individual&#x201D; (my husbands favourite phrase) will in that case prefer my sickness to the cure&#x2014;one knows that sickness at all events comes from God&#x2014;and is not at all sure that <hi rend="italic">such</hi> cure does not come from the Devil&#x2014; The wonder is that sensible people who have heard tell since ever they were born of witchcraft and <hi rend="italic">demonaical possession and all that sort of thing</hi> should all at once fall to singing <foreign><hi rend="italic">to deums</hi></foreign> over magnetism as if it were a new revealation!

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Your Christmas Gifts, kindly reminding us once more of a friendly presence over in the West, arrived with the old punctuality: what can we return you, except many thanks! The &#x201C;festive season,&#x201D; if now good for little else, is good and praiseworthy for reminding friends of one another.</p>
<p>We are labouring somewhat here under the pressures of the season. My Wife has been prisoner with a cold and sorrowful set of colds, these four or five weeks; I too have not entirely escaped, but am now nearly free again. We have been rather solitary of late; which is of all states the wholesomest for me.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-18-309" n="18:309"/>I am very busy; with very bad success. It is a useless thing for me to talk about this sad enterprize of mine; I often remember Goethe who &#x201C;made a point of keeping all his enterprizes <hi rend="italic">secret</hi>.&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Goethe learned this from Herder; see <hi rend="italic">Dichtung und Wahrheit</hi> bk. 8.</note> Much better for me, had I too done so,&#x2014;to which indeed my inclination, did convenience otherwise serve, would lead me! It often seems to me as if I should <hi rend="italic">never</hi> get this work on Cromwell done; at other times, it seems as if I should one day or other! Nobody can help me. I must plunge along, floundering thro&#x2019; the abysses; try to get to land if I may. This grappling, breast to breast with ungainly <hi rend="italic">realities,</hi> with the &#x2018;horrors of chaos&#x2019; and the &#x2018;stupidities of two hundred years,&#x2019;&#x2014;alone, all alone,&#x2014; makes a man very savage! The only help is to work away;&#x2014;and <hi rend="italic">say</hi> nothing.</p>
<p>One Scheffer, a famed Painter at Paris, sent me lately a Mask of the face of Goethe; which gives me a strange lively impression of what the man veritably was;&#x2014;and is very affecting to me when I look earnestly on it. I should have so liked to see the living face of the one man whom I did reverence in my generation; and this, strange living-dead thing, is all I get of it.</p>
<p>I have still the vividest remembrance of Llandough; indeed I could emboss it all, and make a facsimile of it. The silent village on the hill-top, the whole silent friendly green locality, comes strangely into my mind in these tumults and roaring streets. Whether I shall ever see it again is very uncertain but we need not say absolute No;&#x2014;we need not be harder than the Fates themselves are.</p>
<p>Pray give from me many kind remembrances and real wishes to your good Mother. <closer><salute>Accept for yourself many thanks and grateful regards; and believe me ever</salute></closer></p>
<closer><salute>Yours very sincerely /</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name>
