<div1 type="section" id="ed-46-introduction"><head><title><pb id="pg-46-xi" n="46:xi"/>INTRODUCTION</title></head><p>Volume 46 of <hi rend="italic">The Collected Letters of Thomas and Jane Welsh Carlyle</hi> covers Thomas Carlyle&#x02019;s letters from <date when="1869-01">January 1869</date> to <date when="1870-04">April 1870</date>. It also includes any Mary Aitken letters written on TC&#x02019;s behalf in that period. Most of TC&#x02019;s longer letters in this volume are to his family in Scotland, particularly to his brother John A. Carlyle. His shorter letters are often about social arrangements for visits, either in London or to Lady Ashburton in Melchet, Hampshire, or about publishing arrangements with Chapman &#x00026; Hall or John Forster. The shorter letters perhaps predominate because of his increasing difficulty with his handwriting, reducing TC often to using a blue pencil. But longer letters were also written, at this point drafted by TC, then written out by his niece Mary Carlyle Aitken, who now lived with him. Later he was to learn to dictate to her. Giving as full a picture as possible of TC&#x02019;s life at this time, we have added many quotations from the copious number of letters written to TC that have survived. We are also fortunate to be able to continue our use of TC&#x02019;s journal, which often gives a more unmediated picture of his feelings and reactions than his letters do, as well as giving more detail as to what he was doing and who was visiting him. In addition, ensuring the continued presence of JWC in <hi rend="italic">The Collected Letters of Thomas and Jane Welsh Carlyle</hi>, we include two appendices of JWC letters found too late to have been included at their chronological places. [In the <hi rend="ital">Carlyle Letters Online</hi>, the letters that appear in Appendix One and Appendix Two have been moved to their appropriate chronological location.]</p>
    <p>The inclusion of two appendices in this volume reminds us of JWC&#x02019;s epistolary talents. Appendix One is of letters written to her friend Isabella McTurk (later Dinwoodie), and Appendix Two is of letters written between <date when="1850">1850</date> and <date when="1866">1866</date>. Appendix Two is mainly short letters about arrangements or with excuses for refusals, although as always they are highly characteristic of JWC. &#x0201C;So under this pressure of astonishing work excuse brevity and illegibility &#x0002F; Love&#x02014;oh dear no it was <hi rend="italic">affection</hi>&#x02014;<hi rend="italic">Affection</hi> then and respect to M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Gaskell and a kiss to Meta and ditto to yourself dear Woman&#x0201D; (<ref target="volume-26/lt-18511121-JWC-EG-01">JWC to EG, [<date when="1851-11-21">21 Nov. 1851</date></ref>]<sic>, Appendix Two</sic>), she wrote at the end of a dashing note of excuses to Elizabeth Gaskell. Appendix One, containing JWC&#x02019;s letters to Isabella McTurk &#x0002F; Dinwoodie, reminds us of the early, fully developed epistolary style of Jane Baillie Welsh. Isabella McTurk was one of many women friends to whom JWC wrote, and these previously unpublished letters (donated to the National Library of Scotland by Isabella&#x02019;s daughter Mary Agnes Dinwoodie) give fine examples of the satiric energy used in descriptions of JWC&#x02019;s surroundings. <pb id="pg-46-xii" n="46:xii"/>The earliest letter (<ref target="volume-02/lt-18231104-JBW-IMC-01"><date when="1823-11-04">4 Nov. 1823</date></ref>) shows the friendship between two young middle class women in Scotland in the early <date when="1820">1820</date>s who were, of course, piano playing; it includes JBW&#x02019;s transcription of part of the piano music for &#x0201C;Rance [ranz] des vaches,&#x0201D; the Swiss cow-call used as the basis for more than one formal piece of music. We also include two letters from Grace Welsh (JWC&#x02019;s mother) to Isabella Dinwoodie; they show the closeness of the Welsh family&#x02019;s friendship with the McTurk family and Isabella herself [see <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380219-GW-IMD-01">GW to IMD, <date when="1838-02-19">19 Feb. 1838</date></ref>, and <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380227-GW-IMD-01">GW to IMD, <date when="1838-02-27">late Feb.</date></ref>]. Most of Grace Welsh&#x02019;s letters to JWC are lost, but Isabella here is written to like a surrogate daughter, and these two letters, showing Grace Welsh as a fine as well as a sarcastic letter writer, can probably be read as exemplars of Grace Welsh&#x02019;s letters to her daughter. We have been able to include in this appendix a reproduction of a portrait of Isabella Dinwoodie [<ref target="volume-23/lt-18480421-JBW-IMD-01">JBW to IMD, <date when="1848-04-21">21 April 1848</date></ref>], very kindly donated, <date when="2017">2017</date>, by one of her descendants, John Beddoes, to the Edinburgh Carlyle Society; we also include Jane Baillie Welsh&#x02019;s pencil sketch of Grace Welsh [<ref target="volume-02/lt-18231104-JBW-IMC-01"><date when="1823-11-04">4 Nov. 1823</date></ref>], which was previously owned by Dr. James Gillan (also Isabella&#x02019;s descendant and uncle of John Beddoes), and is now owned by Ian Campbell.</p>
    <p>TC is, of course, the main concern of this volume. He was continuing his collecting and light editing of JWC&#x02019;s letters during the months covered. His references to how much he missed her were still present in his journal but were perhaps less acute than previously; he wrote less directly about her virtues as a letter writer in his journal of this time than he had earlier in his reminiscences of her (<date when="1866">1866</date>) and in his journal of <date when="1866">1866</date>&#x02013;<date when="1868">68</date>. Then he extolled her skills (see, for example, his famous passage on her letters, Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> 161 [cited <!-- 44:160, actually 44:6 -->in <ref target="volume-44/lt-18660710-TC-MRSSU-01">TC to MRSSU, <date when="1866-07-10">10 July 1866</date></ref>, note 3], and, in his journal; see <ref target="volume-45/lt-18671130-TC-RST-01"><sic>45:71&#x02013;72</sic><corr>TC to RST, <date when="1867-11-30">30 Nov. 1867</date></corr></ref>, <ref target="volume-45/lt-18680218-TC-LN-01"><sic>96</sic><corr>TC to LN, <date when="1868-02-18">18 Feb. 1868</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-45/lt-18681203-MAI-MEW-01"><sic>207</sic><corr>MAI to MEW, <date when="1868-12-03">3 Dec. 1868</date></corr></ref>). In this volume he commented on the fact of his editing (particularly the dating of letters) rather than on JWC&#x02019;s talents as a letter writer; these talents were now self-evident, and his task of collecting the letters for publication after his death were increasingly seen as an inevitable part of his later life&#x02019;s work. To Thomas Erskine, after thanking him for visiting Betty Braid in Edinburgh, TC wrote about his &#x0201C;work&#x0201D; on the letters: &#x0201C;I still keep working, after a weak sort; but can now do little, often almost nothing;&#x02014;all my little &#x02018;work&#x02019; is henceforth <hi rend="italic">private</hi> (as I calculate); a setting of my poor house in order; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> fain finish <hi rend="italic">in time</hi>, and occasionally fear I shan&#x02019;t&#x0201D; (<ref target="volume-46/lt-18690211-TC-TE-01">TC to TE, <date when="1869-02-11">11 Feb. 1869</date></ref>). Here he made the acknowledgment of his &#x0201C;private work,&#x0201D; echoing the way in which JWC&#x02019;s letters are viewed now as her &#x0201C;private writing,&#x0201D; as opposed to TC&#x02019;s &#x0201C;public&#x0201D; career of published writings. He retained a yearning to do &#x0201C;real&#x0201D; writing: &#x0201C;<hi rend="italic">With</hi> a little health after it, perhaps there are some <hi rend="italic">Last Words</hi> to my sunk generat<hi rend="italic">n</hi> in me still. If <hi rend="italic">not</hi>, no more, and it shall be <hi rend="italic">enough</hi>. In late nights, thinking of these things, I have come to that view; and it is something helpfully <hi rend="italic">fixed</hi> for me&#x0201D; (TC&#x02019;s journal, <date when="1869-04-29">29 April 1869</date>; privately owned).</p>
    <p>TC articulated what he was doing, <date when="1869-07">July 1869</date>, in one of his letters requesting JWC&#x02019;s letters, in this case to Betty Braid, the old servant from Haddington to <pb id="pg-46-xiii" n="46:xiii"/>whom JWC had remained close: &#x0201C;For this long while past I am busy collecting all her letters, getting them copied, dated, made legible to friends that may survive me. There is often mention of you, you may guess how kindly;&#x02014;if you have any of hers to you, as I think is likely, it would be a great favour to send them or such of them as you think the best&#x0201D; (<ref target="lt-18690714-TC-BB-01">TC to BB, <date when="1869-07-14">14 July 1869</date></ref>). During <date when="1869">1869</date>, TC gathered in various other collections of letters from, for example, John Forster and Isabella Simmonds. His family in Dumfries had already helped with copying and dating some family letters, late <date when="1868">1868</date> (see <ref target="volume-45/lt-18681112-TC-JRID-01"><sic>45:197</sic><corr>TC to JRID, <date when="1868-11-12">12 Nov. 1868</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-45/lt-18681222-TC-JAC-01"><sic>215&#x02013;16</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1868-12-22">22 Dec. 1868</date></corr></ref>). TC remained troubled by difficulties in dating JWC&#x02019;s letters, writing his first journal entry in <date when="1869-02-14">1869, 14 February</date>, about how &#x0201C;busy&#x0201D; he was in dating and sorting them:</p>
    <q>Am busy, what I fondly call &#x0201C;busy&#x0201D; with those &#x0201C;Letters&#x0201D;; progress almost <hi rend="italic">none</hi>: ah me, ah me! I feel it to be as my <hi rend="italic">sacred</hi><hi rend="small-caps">task</hi>; and that the time is short; yet the obstruc<hi rend="italic">ns</hi> and paltry impedim<hi rend="italic">ts</hi> in me and ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> me prove so numerous, so contin<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I am only got <hi rend="italic">to</hi> Craigenputt<hi rend="italic">h</hi> yet; and have stood there almost <hi rend="italic">stockstill</hi>, or painfully shuffling hither &#x00026; thither with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> real advance for a week past. I have <hi rend="italic">lost</hi> the tone of care and sincerity;&#x02014; must, <hi rend="italic">must</hi> recover that. (See <ref target="volume-46/lt-lt-18690217-TC-TDI-01"><sic>13</sic><corr>TC to [TDI], <date when="1869-02-17">17 Feb. 1869</date></corr>)</ref></q>
    <p>Later he was to express his grief at the approaching end of this task, as though it presaged a second parting from JWC:</p>
    <q>In spite of imped<hi rend="italic">ts</hi>, we are now getting done with that sacred <hi rend="italic">Task</hi>; in a month more (if permitted still) I can hope to see the whole of those dear <hi rend="italic">letters</hi> lying legible to good eyes (with the needful commentaries &#x00026;c). &#x02026; Ah, me; and now there is at times a sharp pang, as if this were a <hi rend="italic">second</hi> parting with Her; sad, sad, this too! &#x02026; Oh my lost lost One; <hi rend="italic">lost</hi>, and none left to <hi rend="italic">help</hi> me ever ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi>! ([<date when="1869-07-24">24 July 1869</date>]; see <ref target="lt-18690126-TC-JAC-01"><sic>64</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1869-07-26">26 July 1869</date></corr></ref>)</q>
    <p>By late <date when="1869-09">September 1869</date>, TC commented in his journal: &#x0201C;The &#x02018;<hi rend="italic">Task</hi>,&#x02019; in a sort, <hi rend="italic">done</hi>; Mary <hi rend="italic">finish</hi> my Notes (of <date when="1866">1866</date>) this very day;&#x02014;I shrinking, for weeks past, from any revisal or interference there, as a thing evidently <hi rend="italic">hurt</hi>ful, (evid<hi rend="italic">tly</hi> anti-somnial <hi rend="italic">even</hi>!) in my pres<hi rend="italic">t</hi> state of nerves.&#x02014; Essentially, how<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, Her Letters &#x00026; Memorials are saved&#x0201D; (see <ref target="volume-46/lt-18691001-TC-LLA-01"><sic>80</sic><corr>TC to LLA, <date when="1869-10-01">1 Oct. 1869</date></corr></ref>). This reference to JWC&#x02019;s &#x0201C;Letters &#x00026; Memorials&#x0201D; seems to indicate that he had already decided what any publication might be called; J. A. Froude (who &#x0201C;had no conjecture as to what it was&#x0201D; that TC had been working on) wrote in <hi rend="italic">Carlyle&#x02019;s Life in London</hi>: &#x0201C;This is the last mention of these &#x02018;Letters,&#x02019; &#x00026;c, in the Journal. &#x02026; It was tied together and laid aside for the present, and no resolution was then formed as to what was to be done with it&#x0201D; (Froude, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi> 4:382&#x02013;83). TC himself had promised Isabella Simmonds nothing was to be done soon with the letters:</p>
    <q><pb id="pg-46-xiv" n="46:xiv"/>Those precious Letters are all lying punctually locked up in Chelsea; waiting y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> return. I am greatly obliged by y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> loan of them. &#x02026; Niece Mary has taken Copies of those you sent, as was my object in asking for them: but you may trust me there is no vestige of intention to <hi rend="italic">print</hi> anything; on the contrary, a strict <hi rend="italic">prohibition</hi>,&#x02014;at least and lowest till all whom it c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> personally concern are out of the scene. (<ref target="volume-46/lt-18690904-TC-IEB-01">TC to IS [IEB], <date when="1869-09-04">4 Sept. 1869</date></ref>)</q>
    <p>Mary Aitken was now living permanently with TC, and one of her main tasks had been transcribing many of JWC&#x02019;s letters. TC saw her as an always willing &#x0201C;little&#x0201D; helper, as doubtless she was, but her own feelings were expressed to a friend, <date when="1869-02-10">10 Feb. 1869</date>; she was looking forward to the arrival of JWC&#x02019;s cousin Maggie Welsh for a visit:</p><p>I have never seen her; but I have no doubt we will be very good friends for all that. And she will be good company for me for I confess sometimes the days seem long &#x00026; my copying gets monotonous and then I threaten to get quite too homesick &#x00026; go to immortal smash. (<date when="1869-02-10">10 Feb. 1869</date>; MS: Harry Ransom Center, Univ. of Texas)</p>
    <p>Given Mary&#x02019;s considerable involvement in the work of putting together the text of JWC&#x02019;s letters, it is perhaps unsurprising that she should have felt so invested in the provenance and legal rights and wrongs of the speedy publication by Froude after TC&#x02019;s death of JWC&#x02019;s <hi rend="italic">Letters and Memorials</hi> (<date when="1883">1883</date>) as well as of TC&#x02019;s <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> (published very soon after TC&#x02019;s death, <date when="1881-02">February 1881</date>).</p>
    <p>There were always more letters to be collected and dated; Forster&#x02019;s own work over summer <date when="1869">1869</date> meant that he could not sort his and his wife&#x02019;s letters from JWC until <date when="1869-10">October 1869</date>; TC&#x02019;s commentary, as he took them up to read, indicated the mixture of pain, loss, and religious feeling with which he approached her memory:</p>
    <q>A mournful fascinat<hi rend="italic">n</hi> to me, the reading of them! I felt bereaved, as if I had lost Her <hi rend="italic">ag</hi>n when they ended. My feeling on that side, I think, is never like to abate at all. Sorrow not so lacerating, poignant, but almost deeper and tenderer than ever. Interwoven, incorporated (I might say), with all of <hi rend="italic">religion</hi>, of love, devoutness, goodness, that is in one. Let it accomp<hi rend="italic">y</hi> my now lonesome steps till I die. (<date when="1869-11-11">11 Nov. 1869</date>; see <ref target="volume-46/lt-18691023-TC-JAC-01"><sic>93</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1869-10-23">23 Oct. 1869</date></corr></ref>)</q>
    <p>Clearly, JWC&#x02019;s death in <date when="1866">1866</date> and TC&#x02019;s sense of grief after that underpinned many of his own increasing feelings of mortality. In <date when="1869">1869</date>, shortly after the anniversary of JWC&#x02019;s death, he lamented the illnesses affecting his friends and deaths of some of them:</p>

    <p>Dickens himself was to die, to the shock of TC and many others, <date when="1870-06-20">20 June 1870</date> (see vol. 47). The death, <date when="1869-10-05">5 October 1869</date>, of Eliza Stodart, friend of JWC&#x02019;s youth, led TC into expressing an unusual fellow feeling for her husband, David Aitken: &#x0201C;Poor &#x02018;Bess Stoddart&#x02019; (Mrs D. Aitken, once of Minto), a young intimate of [JWC&#x02019;s] (some years older than She) was suddenly summoned two weeks ago. &#x02026; <supplied>[P]</supplied>oor Aitken left suddenly alone too! They were a commonplace pair of people; but Death has made them also tragic to me&#x0201D; (<date when="1869-11-11">11 Nov. 1869</date>; see <ref target="volume-46/lt-18691111-TC-JAC-01"><sic>105</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1869-11-11">12 [11] Nov. 1869</date></corr></ref>). Six months later, he was lamenting the death of one of his and JWC&#x02019;s old friends, Thomas Erskine: &#x0201C;Ever since Tuesday morn<hi rend="italic">g</hi> I have had that sad &#x00026; solemn time in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> pres<hi rend="italic">t</hi> to me. Our good, and dear old Erskine gone away from us&#x0201D; (<ref target="volume-46/lt-18700324-TC-WSM-01">TC to WSM, <date when="1870-03-24">24 March 1870</date></ref>). TC continued to mourn JWC, somehow intertwining his feelings about her with his feelings about worship; by collecting her letters as well as recording his memories, his memorializing of JWC became his substitute for religion:</p>
    <q>Thursday next is the anniversary of my irreparable Loss. Four years ago now; and the sense of it not lightened or lessened,&#x02014;on the contrary bro<hi rend="italic">t</hi> home to me, practically sore and sad, many times every day I live. Indeed at no moment is my Lost One absent from me; but lies behind every tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> I have or thing I do,&#x02014;even in the presence of other people, when it is expected that I am to have totally forgotten (as they have done) the Calamity that came. Ah me, ah me. And yet there is occasionally (as this morning) a blessed balm in this mournful remembrance; a <hi rend="italic">sacredness</hi>, something more like &#x02018;worship of God&#x02019; than any<hi rend="italic">thg</hi> else I do. (<date when="1870-04-16">16 April 1870</date>; see <ref target="volume-46/lt-18700422-TC-JAC-01"><sic>196&#x02013;97</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1870-04-22">22 April 1870</date></corr></ref>)</q>
    <p>As well as his own feelings of mortality compounded by the deaths of others, and the continuing sense of loss of JWC, TC felt most beleaguered by his sleeplessness and the loss of capacity for writing with his right hand. One of Mary&#x02019;s other main tasks was, at times, to make a final copy of TC&#x02019;s letters for sending and, unsurprisingly, TC felt hampered by this change of practice and his letters of summer <date when="1869">1869</date> were much preoccupied with it; he wrote to <ref target="volume-46/lt-18690714-TC-BB-01">Betty Braid, <date when="1869-07-14">14 July 1869</date></ref>: &#x0201C;For the last year my hand has been very shaky, sometimes refusing altogether to <hi rend="italic">write</hi> for me; so that I am obliged to employ the hand of a good little Niece, who is very ready that way;&#x02014;as you may see here; but I have never yet got used to writing by dictation&#x0201D;; and to his brother: <pb id="pg-46-xvi" n="46:xvi"/>&#x0201C;today I have tried to write a line to the Rev<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Bearer; but was obliged to give it to Mary to <hi rend="italic">copy</hi> after all. The loss of my poor <hi rend="italic">pen</hi>-hand is a gr<hi rend="italic">t</hi> misery, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I must reconcile myself to. I sometimes think of trying to <hi rend="italic">learn with the left</hi>; for dictating (at least hitherto, with Mary, who is so soft, too, and so willing, if she only understood!) altog<hi rend="italic">r</hi> refuses to prosper with me!&#x0201D; (<ref target="volume-46/lt-18690811-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1869-08-11">11 Aug. 1869</date></ref>). He was no more successful than JWC had been (see <ref target="volume-42/lt-18650608-JWC-TC-01"><sic>42:69&#x02013;71</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1865-06-08">8 June [1865]</date></corr></ref>) at learning to write with his left hand. He wrote to Ralph Waldo Emerson: &#x0201C;you see I am reduced to <hi rend="italic">pencil</hi>! &#x00026; &#x02018;write&#x02019; with such difficulty (never yet c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> learn to &#x02018;dictate,&#x02019; tho&#x02019; my little Niece here is promptitude itself, and is so swift and legible&#x0201D; (<ref target="volume-46/lt-18700224-TC-RWE-01"><date when="1870-02-24">24 Feb. 1870</date></ref>). These letters provide a useful summary of TC&#x02019;s struggles with his writing and his shaky right hand. The new difficulties were a material change in his capacities that struck at the heart of his being a writer. But he was not without wit in describing the problem; he wrote to Lady Ashburton: &#x0201C;My hand <hi rend="italic">can</hi> write today,&#x02014;ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> as <hi rend="italic">fast</hi> as it once c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have engraved on some soft metal&#x0201D; (<ref target="volume-46/lt-18590811-TC-LLA-01"><date when="1869-08-19">19 Aug. 1869</date></ref>), and then refined the image to his brother: &#x0201C;I have taken such a <hi rend="italic">time</hi> over this, e.g.; c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have <hi rend="italic">engraved</hi> it (on <hi rend="italic">lead</hi>) sooner&#x0201D; (<ref target="volume-46/lt-18691103-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1869-11-03">3 Nov. 1869</date></ref>).</p>
    <p>His main health problem, continuously referred to in letters and his journal, was sleeplessness. Letter after letter complained. He wrote after a week with Lady Ashburton at her country house, Melchet, <date when="1869-04">April 1869</date>: &#x0201C;I was at Melchet lately for a week; all imaginable kindness &#x00026;c &#x00026;c,&#x02014;but was obliged to <hi rend="italic">leave</hi>, in a week, for absolute <hi rend="italic">want of sleep</hi>. Can&#x02019;t go (nor have been gen<hi rend="italic">lly</hi> for years past) to such places any more. <hi rend="italic">Small</hi> sacrifice, or none. The idle talk of mankind is grown quite unwelcome to me&#x0201D; (see <ref target="volume-46/lt-18690412-TC-RSTFC-01"><sic>37</sic><corr>TC to RSTFC, <date when="1869-04-12">12 April 1869</date></corr></ref>). John A. Carlyle, now TC&#x02019;s most regular correspondent, often heard TC&#x02019;s complaints: &#x0201C;The truth is, I am fallen ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi> into one of my great gulphs, or <hi rend="italic">abysses</hi> of sleeplessness&#x0201D; (<ref target="volume-46/lt-18690605-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1869-06-05">[5] June 1869</date></ref>). But both John and Mary had their own views about TC&#x02019;s sleeplessness. John, somewhat tartly (although he had been sympathetic enough to TC&#x02019;s complaints of sleeplessness at Melchet), wrote: &#x0201C;I suffer a good deal myself in that way, &#x00026; both Jamie at Scotsbrig, &#x00026; Jean here also suffer; so I suppose there must be something of a family sort in the matter&#x0201D; (JAC to TC, <date when="1869-04-16">16 April 1869</date>; see <ref target="volume-46/lt-18690428-TC-JAC-01"><sic>43</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1869-04-28">28 April 1869</date></corr></ref>), putting TC&#x02019;s sleeplessness firmly into the context of family tendencies. Mary Aitken shared her own interpretation of TC&#x02019;s sleeplessness with Lady Ashburton (that TC slept too much in the evening) after TC&#x02019;s return from Melchet: &#x0201C;We are fairly settled down here again &#x00026; I think my Uncle looks much better than he did before going to Melchet&#x02014;&#x00026; he is sleeping pretty well. I think the great mistake he made at Melchet was transacting the most of his sleep before, instead of after, going to bed&#x0201D; (see <ref target="volume-46/lt-18690412-TC-RSTFC-01"><sic>37</sic><corr>TC to RSTFC, <date when="1869-04-12">12 April 1869</date></corr></ref>). TC claimed some improvement during fall <date when="1869">1869</date>; after taking a drug recommended by Dr. John Chapman, he wrote to John: &#x0201C;my <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi>, I begin to really believe, seems to be on the improving hand. No drug swallowed for, I think, almost a fortnight now, and no night utterly bad&#x0201D; (<ref target="volume-46/lt-18691111-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1869-11-11">12 [11] Nov. 1869</date></ref>). <pb id="pg-46-xvii" n="46:xvii"/>But a few days later, he thought his sleep was more precarious, describing it humorously to Lady Ashburton: &#x0201C;My path (towards common Sleep) is like that of the Moslem Soul towards Paradise,&#x02014;on the Edge of a Sword&#x0201D; (<ref target="volume-46/lt-18691116-TC-LLA-01">TC to LLA, <date when="1869-11-16">16 Nov. 1869</date></ref>). He was socially aware enough to understand that he owed Lady Ashburton a great debt for her attempts to help him to health as well as in other ways; writing to her after another stay at Melchet, <date when="1870-02">February 1870</date>, describing himself as &#x0201C;one whose real place now sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be the <hi rend="italic">Hospital of Incurables</hi>,&#x0201D; acknowledging that &#x0201C;Melchet, I clearly perceive, has done me good, not harm; &#x00026; good not bodily only: let that be a shadow of reward for y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> immensity of trouble!&#x0201D; (<ref target="volume-46/lt-18700223-TC-LLA-01">TC to LLA, <date when="1870-02-23">23 Feb. 1870</date></ref>). But he continued complaining vociferously about his perceived lack of sleep.</p>
    <p>TC&#x02019;s main work during the months covered by this volume (other than collecting and editing JWC&#x02019;s letters) was the preparation of the library edition of his <hi rend="italic">Collected Works</hi> for publication; he complained about this project but nonetheless entered into it thoroughly. It had begun in <date when="1868">1868</date> (see <ref target="volume-45/lt-18670816-TC-JAC-01"><sic>45:10</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1867-07-16">16 July 1867</date></corr></ref>), ending in <date when="1871">1871</date> with the final volumes of <hi rend="italic">Frederick the Great</hi> (vols. 24&#x02013;30 of the library edition). Chapman &#x00026; Hall in <date when="1868">1868</date> was completing the publication of the uniform (cheap) edition of TC&#x02019;s works with <hi rend="italic">Frederick the Great</hi> (vols. 17&#x02013;23, published <date when="1869">1869</date>), but simultaneously was pushing ahead with work on the more up-market library edition. Forster, always protective and helpful to TC on business matters, produced a formal agreement between TC and Chapman &#x00026; Hall, which TC and Frederic Chapman signed, and Forster witnessed, <date when="1869-04-29">29 April 1869</date>. TC acknowledged his gratitude in his journal: &#x0201C;Today I meet Forster &#x00026; Chapman, to <hi rend="italic">sign</hi> Barg<hi rend="italic">n</hi> of &#x02018;Library Edit<hi rend="italic">n</hi>,&#x02019;&#x02014;good F<hi rend="italic">r</hi> takes inexpressible pains ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> all that; strange really, and <hi rend="italic">compelling</hi> thanks!&#x0201D; (<date when="1869-04-29">29 April 1869</date>; see <ref target="volme-46/lt-18690428-TC-JAC-01"><sic>44</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1869-04-28">28 April 1869</date></corr></ref>; see also <ref target="volume-46/lt-18690429-TC-AFC-01">TC&#x02019;s agreement with Frederic Chapman, <date when="1869-04-29">29 April 1869</date></ref>). From the continuing editions of TC&#x02019;s works, he was clearly a successful author for Chapman&#x02019;s; the agreement with Chapman makes clear exactly what TC was entitled to from this edition and how much his publications were an ongoing money maker, for TC as well as the publisher. During this volume (covering <date when="1869">1869</date>&#x02013;<date when="1870-04">April 1870</date>), TC was concerned with page proofs for the library edition&#x02019;s earlier volumes. There was also much time given to possible illustrations: &#x0201C;&#x02018;plates for library Edit<hi rend="italic">n</hi>,&#x02019; much paltry trouble with that thrice-insignif<hi rend="italic">t</hi> matter&#x0201D; ([<date when="1869-09-28">28 Sept. 1869</date>]; see <ref target="18691001-TC-LLA-01"><sic>81</sic><corr>TC to LLA, <date when="1869-10-01">1 Oct. 1869</date></corr></ref>). The apparently interminable procedure continued of sitting to George Frederic Watts for the portrait that had been commissioned by Forster specifically for one of the frontispieces. Originally intended for the very first volume of the library edition, <hi rend="italic">Sartor Resartus</hi> (published early <date when="1869">1869</date>; see <ref target="volume-45/lt-18681017-TC-FC-01"><sic>45:186&#x02013;88</sic><corr>TC to FC, [<date when="1868-10-17">17 Oct. 1868</date>]</corr></ref>), it became the frontispiece to volume 1 of <hi rend="italic">Critical and Miscellaneous Essays</hi> (see below). By <date when="1869-11">November 1869</date>, TC was complaining: &#x0201C;Proofsheets go on, and bother of Prints, of <hi rend="italic">improved</hi> Watts Portrait &#x00026;c &#x00026;c; but there is nothing of real interest in all that to me . &#x02026; Plenty of proofs of the world&#x02019;s <hi rend="italic">respect</hi> &#x00026;c &#x00026;c; &#x02026; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> of course is <pb id="pg-46-xviii" n="46:xviii"/>better than the opposite while I remain here, but is singularly grown a matter of indiff<hi rend="italic">ce</hi> too&#x0201D; (<date when="1869-11-11">11 Nov. 1869</date>; see <ref target="18691111-TC-JAC-01"><sic>107</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1869-11-11">12 [11] Nov. 1869</date></corr></ref>). This shows that TC was quite aware of his reputation being sustained by continuing publication of new editions even though he was producing no new writings.</p>
    <p>Watts&#x02019;s struggle to produce a satisfactory portrait of TC had begun in <date when="1867-06">June 1867</date> (see <ref target="volume-44/lt-18670608-TC-GFW-01"><sic>44:209</sic><corr>TC to GFW, <date when="1867-06-08">8 June 1867</date></corr></ref>); his attempts were restarted in <date when="1868">1868</date>, and TC continued sitting for him despite his many complaints about the painting and Watts himself (see <ref target="volume-45/lt-18680530-TC-JAC-01"><sic>45:142</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1868-05-30">30 May 1868</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-45/lt-18681031-TC-CPH-01"><sic>195</sic><corr>TC to CPH,<date when="1868-10-31">31 Oct. 1868</date></corr></ref>). TC and Forster had faced the inevitable, late <date when="1868">1868</date>, and used instead the reproduction of Elliott &#x00026; Fry&#x02019;s <date when="1865">1865</date> photograph of TC (that JWC had liked) for the frontispiece to <hi rend="italic">Sartor Resartus</hi>. Watts&#x02019;s struggle to produce a satisfactory portrait continued into <date when="1869">1869</date> with more complaints and criticisms from TC. TC wrote a note on a letter to Forster: &#x0201C;Watts&#x02019;s Blotch-Portrait (&#x02018;last sitting&#x02019; to <hi rend="italic">be</hi>, Friday next [<date when="1869-10-15">15</date> or <date when="1869-10-22">22 Oct. 1869</date>], 2&#x000BD; p.m. to end at 4 <hi rend="italic">forever</hi>).&#x02014; So distracted a monster of Painting I have never seen before: &#x02018;Cross bet<hi rend="italic">n</hi>&#x02019; a Lunatic &#x00026; an Imposter&#x02014;no fraction of me recognisable in it. Fie!&#x0201D; (see <ref target="volume-46/lt-18691010-TC-MAI-01"><sic>87</sic><corr>TC to MAI, <date when="1869-10-10">10 Oct. 1869</date></corr></ref>). Watts&#x02019;s ill-fated portrait was finally engraved for the frontispiece to volume 1 of <hi rend="italic">Critical and Miscellaneous Essays</hi> (volume 6 of the library edition, <date when="1869">1869</date>) (see <ref target="volume-46/lt-18690306-TC-JAC-01"><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1869-03-06">6 March 1869</date></corr></ref><sic>, and 19</sic>). Famously, Watts painted three portraits of TC, possibly simultaneously, one with hands (now in the Victoria and Albert Museum; see <ref target="volume-45/lt-18681031-TC-CPH-01"><sic>45:193</sic><corr>TC to CPH, <date when="1868-10-31">31 Oct. 1868</date></corr></ref>), commissioned by Forster for &#x00A3;150 (see <ref target="volume-45/lt-18680506-TC-JF-01"><sic>45:126&#x02013;27</sic><corr>TC to JF, <date when="1868-05-06">6 May 1868</date></corr></ref>), another completed portrait, without hands (now in the National Portrait Gallery, London; see <ref target="volume-45/lt-18680530-TC-JAC-01"><sic>45:140</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1868-05-30">30 May 1868</date></corr></ref>), and an unfinished portrait (now in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford; see 45:frontispiece [Viewable in the <hi rend="ital">CLO</hi> on the table of contents page for volume 45]). In all his references to and complaints about the sittings, TC only once referred to there being more than one portrait and even then it was an oblique reference. In <date when="1870-03">March 1870</date>, he wrote to John A. Carlyle about Amelia Robertson Hill&#x02019;s bust of him (see <ref target="volume-43/lt-18660405-TC-JWC-01"><sic>43:166</sic><corr>TC to JWC, [<date when="1866-04-05">5 and 8 April 1866</date>]</corr></ref>): &#x0201C;It is very considerably worse than Watts&#x02019;s first Picture of me; &#x00026; that is saying a gr<hi rend="italic">t</hi> deal&#x0201D; (see <ref target="volume-46/lt-18700304-TC-JAC-01"><sic>167</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1870-03-04">4 March 1870</date></corr></ref>). This implies that he at least knew of the existence of a second portrait by Watts, presumably the other completed one. Most of his comments about the portrait were clearly made about the one Forster commissioned as TC makes them either to Forster himself or in his journal in relation to the portrait still not being ready for the intended frontispiece.</p>
    <p>Chapman &#x00026; Hall&#x02019;s library edition is clearly part of TC&#x02019;s legacy (just as JWC&#x02019;s letters and memorials were to become her legacy), an assertion of his importance and continuing relevance to the cultural life of Britain (and the English speaking world generally) in the nineteenth century. TC&#x02019;s own thoughts were turning to possible bequests. In <date when="1869-12">December 1869</date>, TC willingly complied with a request from Haddington for a set of his works for the town library, describing it in his journal as: &#x0201C;a <hi rend="italic">Bequest</hi> from H<hi rend="small-caps">er</hi> (&#x02018;the noblest Daughter Hadd<hi rend="italic">n</hi> ever bore!&#x02019;)&#x0201D; (see <ref target="18691218-TC-TK-01"><sic>132</sic><corr>TC to TK, <date when="1869-12-18">18 Dec. 1869</date></corr></ref>). Another part of his own legacy was his decision (in <pb id="pg-46-xix" n="46:xix"/>the course of this volume) to bequeath his accumulated library of books from the writing of <hi rend="italic">Cromwell&#x02019;s Letters and Speeches</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Frederick the Great</hi> to a North American college. TC was particularly aware of this material at this time as he was preparing <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> for its new library edition (<date when="1870">1870</date>) and <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi>, first for its inclusion in the uniform (cheap) edition (<date when="1869">1869</date>) and then for the library edition (<date when="1870">1870</date>&#x02013;<date when="1871">71</date>). He began formally discussing this book legacy, <date when="1869-05">May 1869</date>, with his new acquaintance, Charles Eliot Norton, who reported TC&#x02019;s words:</p>
    <q>&#x0201C;I suppose there never was a man who had so much to do with books as I have, who owned so few. &#x02026; But in writing about Cromwell and Friedrich I have chanced to get together some things not wholly worthless nor yet easy to find, and I&#x02019;ve thought I should like when I die to leave these books to some institution in New England, where they might be preserved, and where they would serve as a testimony of my appreciation o&#x02019; the goodness o&#x02019; your people toward me and o&#x02019; the many acts o&#x02019; kindness they have done me; and perhaps you can help me to have this rightly done.&#x0201D; (<hi rend="italic">Norton&#x02019;s Letters</hi> 1:336)</q>
    <p>Norton suggested, <date when="1869-05-24">24 May 1869</date>, &#x0201C;the Library of Harvard College, Cambridge, Massachusetts&#x0201D; as the most suitable beneficiary; TC wrote his assent on the reverse of Norton&#x02019;s letter (see <ref target="volume-46/lt-1869-0526-TC-JF-01"><sic>49</sic><corr>TC to JF, <date when="1869-05-26">26 May 1869</date></corr></ref>) and proceeded to implement his plan in correspondence with Ralph Waldo Emerson and Norton over the following winter. He had Mary Aitken make two catalogues, one kept in Cheyne Row, the other sent to Emerson:</p>
    <q>For benefit of my <hi rend="italic">Survivors</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Representatives</hi> here, I retain an exact <hi rend="italic">Copy</hi> of the Catalogue now put into y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> keeping; so that everything may fall out square bet<hi rend="italic">n</hi> them and you, when the Time shall arrive. &#x02026; <supplied>[S]</supplied>o soon as I hear from you that Harvard accepts my poor widow&#x02019;s mite of a <hi rend="italic">Bequest</hi>, I will proceed to put it down in due form, and so finish this small matter, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> for long years has hovered in my tho<hi rend="italic">ts</hi> as a thing <supplied>[I]</supplied> sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> like to do. (<ref target="volume-46/lt-18700224-TC-RWE-01">TC to RWE, <date when="1870-02-24">24 Feb. 1870</date></ref>)</q>
    <p>TC assumed that his legacy would be overseen by his younger and closest brother, John A. Carlyle:</p>
    <q>I hope you will find everything clear as can be; and it is to you dear Brother (if you Survive me as is nat<hi rend="italic">l</hi> and desirable) that I trust for fulfilling everyth<hi rend="italic">g</hi> as if I were myself still here. &#x02026; Accept my thanks while I <hi rend="italic">can</hi> still give them!&#x02014; To set my house in order, is surely very becoming, <pb id="pg-46-xx" n="46:xx"/>now when I have as it were fairly ceased all <hi rend="italic">working</hi> of the old sort. (<ref target="volume-46/lt-18700319-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1870-03-19">19 March 1870</date></ref>)</q>
    <p>But, however well TC set his house in order, it was not to be John who carried out his wishes as John was to die before him in <date when="1879">1879</date>. It was to be TC&#x02019;s niece Mary Aitken (who had written the catalogue of the books) and Alexander Carlyle, by then her husband, who took charge of that responsibility. The material now makes up the extensive Harvard Carlyle Collection (HCC).</p>
    <p>TC was less active socially from <date when="1869-01">January 1869</date> to <date when="1870-04">April 1870</date>, his movements and activities apparently curtailed; nonetheless, as can be seen in his letters, he continued to think about trips he might take, tasks he might accomplish. He continued a pretense of living like a hermit, writing to Edward FitzGerald, &#x0201C;I am becoming a land hermit as much as you are a sea one&#x0201D; (<ref target="volume-46/lt-18691031-TC-EF-01"><date when="1869-10-31">31 Oct. 1869</date></ref>), and expressing resentment at intrusions on his time in person or by letter. His domestic life was now mainly organized by Mary Aitken; his housekeeper was still Sarah Warren who had one servant girl to help her. Where JWC had used TC&#x02019;s life and the running of 5 Cheyne Row as material for her narratives, TC paid so little attention to it that it is hard to be sure even what the current servant girl was called; Jean Aitken referred to her as Charlotte in <date when="1867">1867</date>, but it is not known whether she was still in the household <date when="1869">1869</date>&#x02013;<date when="1870">70</date>. Even trouble between Sarah Warren and Mary Aitken (presumably caused by a fear on Mrs. Warren&#x02019;s part that Mary was accruing too much household power) was only referred to in passing by TC in his journal (<date when="1869-11-20">20 Nov. 1869</date>; see <ref target="volume-46/lt-18691119-MAI-CAW-01"><sic>114</sic><corr>MAI to CAW, <date when="1869-11-19">19 Nov. 1869</date></corr></ref>). Mary Aitken had come for a visit, fall <date when="1868">1868</date> (see <ref target="volume-45/lt-18680917-TC-SWA-01"><sic>45:172</sic><corr>TC to SWA, <date when="1868-09-17">17 Sep. 1868</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-45/lt-18680926-TC-JAC-01"><sic>177</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1868-09-26">26 Sep. 1868</date></corr></ref>), staying on to become TC&#x02019;s main support and companion. As she wrote to a friend, <date when="1869-02">February 1869</date>: &#x0201C;<hi rend="italic">I have been very busy all the time with copying</hi>. &#x02026; I never went any further with my intention of going home (indeed you would be surprised how very many of my intentions I can not get accomplished); but have quietly remained at 5, Cheyne Row&#x0201D; (<date when="1869-02-10">10 Feb. 1869</date>; see <ref target="18690320-lt-TC-JAC-01"><sic>32</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1869-03-20">20 March 1869</date></corr></ref>). Presumably the family and she felt that life in London offered more opportunities for her than being a pupil teacher in Peebles, which she had been <date when="1867-02">February</date>&#x02013;<date when="1867-09">September 1867</date> (see <ref target="volume-45/lt-18680810-TC-HBO-01"><sic>44:163</sic><corr>TC to JCA, <date when="1867-02-24">24 Feb. 1867</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-45/lt-18670921-TC-JAC-01"><sic>45:35</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1867-09-21">21 Sep. 1867</date></corr></ref>). Living with her uncle provided her with a life plan, and, in due course, a life partner, as she was to marry, <date when="1879">1879</date>, her Canadian cousin Alexander Carlyle, both of them remaining with TC until his death in <date when="1881">1881</date>. From the start, she was made welcome by TC&#x02019;s friends, part of his trips to Melchet, his dinners with the Forsters. Forster even used the same nickname for her as TC, &#x0201C;Child of Nature&#x0201D; (see <ref target="volume-46/lt-18690605-TC-JAC-01"><sic>51</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1869-06-05">[5] June 1869</date></corr></ref>). TC himself, clearly fond of her, seemed to cast her in a kind of substitute role (however inadequate) to JWC, mildly patronizing as he was; &#x0201C;You are a clever enough creature when you keep on the alert,&#x0201D; he wrote to her, <ref target="volume-46/lt-18690719-TC-MAI-01"><date when="1869-07-19">19 July 1869</date></ref>, while praising her to his friends: &#x0201C;my little Niece here is promptitude itself, and is so swift <pb id="pg-46-xxi" n="46:xxi"/>and legible,&#x02014;useful here as a cheerful <hi rend="italic">rushlight</hi> in this now sombre element, sombre, sad, but also beautiful and tenderly solemn more &#x00026; more, in wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> she bears me company, good little &#x02018;Mary&#x02019;!&#x0201D; (<ref target="volume-46/lt-18700224-TC-RWE-01">TC to RWE, <date when="1870-02-24">24 Feb. 1870</date></ref>). While TC may have been casting her into the role of a supportive or submissive young relative, whom he saw as there to help him in his declining years, there are signs that Mary had her own character and opinions, with social outings independent from TC, including visits to JWC&#x02019;s old friends the Reichenbachs and their children (who were near to her in age). In that same letter to a friend (who, according to the letter, knew Geraldine Jewsbury), Mary wrote of one of her visits to the Reichenbach household:</p>
    <q>We were going to have a very pleasant evening a good many young ladies &#x00026; one remarkable <hi rend="italic">green</hi> young gentleman; but I most unfortunately did not know there were to be any others so had told Uncle I would be back early &#x00026; came off about nine. <hi rend="italic">I was very much disappointed not to hear Miss R</hi>h <hi rend="italic"> sing</hi>. They were most kind and I liked them very well. Didn&#x02019;t you think Reichenbach J<hi rend="italic">r</hi>. a handsome youth?!! There was a girl there who monopolized him however most effectually. (<date when="1869-02-10">10 February 1869</date>; MS: Harry Ransom Center, Univ. of Texas)</q>
    <p>She also told her friend that she had attended John Ruskin&#x02019;s lecture at the Royal Institution, &#x0201C;The Flamboyant Architecture of the Valley of the Somme&#x0201D; (<date when="1869-01-29">29 Jan. 1869</date>; see <ref target="volume-46/lt-18690209-TC-LLA-01"><corr>TC to LLA, <date when="1869-02-09">9 Feb. 1869</date></corr></ref>).</p>
    <p>In his life as in his writings, TC was seen as powerfully exaggerated in his style and effects, described as such by reviewers, readers, visitors, friends, and JWC. His journals contain flashes of self-knowledge; he wrote in his journal, <date when="1870-03-14">14 March 1870</date>, about a visit to Broadlands: &#x0201C;I really was <hi rend="italic">wild</hi> of tongue; a barbarous sincerity in me, clean ag<hi rend="italic">t</hi> polite rule&#x0201D; (see <ref target="volume-46/lt-18700223-TC-LLA-01"><sic>160</sic><corr>TC to LLA, 23 Feb. 1870</corr></ref>); and, during <date when="1870-04">April 1870</date>, he saw himself as others saw him, describing himself: &#x0201C;T. Spedding is here; walk with him last week; my style of talk to him, so fierce, exaggerative, scornful of surrounding men and things is painful to me to think of now&#x0201D; (<date when="1870-05-01">1 May 1870</date>; see <sic>198</sic><corr></corr>). But what this description misses (as readings of TC&#x02019;s works can also miss), was the exaggerated humor that could accompany his wild pronouncements. It is probable that, as he entered into his last full decade, he felt that there was little laughter in his life, but nonetheless in face of the sharp humor that still existed in his letters, it is unlikely that TC as a companion, &#x0201C;fierce, exaggerative, scornful&#x0201D; as he might be, was completely lacking in humorous satire or even laughter. This volume may show TC&#x02019;s strong sense of himself as declining in health and powers, but nonetheless his letters show him as vigorously engaged with his publications (even though no longer writing new works), aware of his sense of grief over the loss of JWC, but using <pb id="pg-46-xxii" n="46:xxii"/>it to drive his collecting and editing of her letters, his final memorial to her, as well as fully engaged with his friendship circles, however much he might complain about their demands. The volume, in the appendices of her letters, also gives us a reminder of the amusement and engagement shown by JWC with her life.</p>

TC writes Mary Aitken telling her not to hurry, but to come back to Chelsea when family conditions permit, and wondering if her mother, Jean, might also benefit from a visit to London (<date when="1869-10-019">19</date>). He tells John he is &#x0201C;very gloomy and lonely&#x0201D; but has been saved from sleeplessness by a sleeping draught from a Dr. Chapman (<date when="1869-10-23">23</date>). TC dines with the Forsters (<date when="1869-10-24">24</date>), and Watts visits (<date when="1869-10-25">25</date>) to ask for one more sitting (<date when="1869-10-28">28</date>). TC tells Anthony Sterling that the engraving of the John Sterling portrait is &#x0201C;tolerable&#x0201D; (<date when="1869-10-31">31</date>).</p>

He thanks his sister Jean for arranging for clothes to be made for him and sends money for her to give to Wilhelmina Cunningham (<date when="1869-11-16">16</date>). After a three-year gap he writes to R. W. Emerson and on the same day to Charles Eliot Norton to propose bequeathing his books on Cromwell and Frederick the Great to Harvard Library.

He thanks Lady Ashburton for presents of game (<date when="1869-12-17">17</date>). Illustrations for the new edition continue to take much of TC&#x02019;s time and energy. He sends a copy of his collected works to the Town Council of Haddington as a memorial of JWC (<date when="1869-12-18">18</date>). He writes his sister Jean in Dumfries with a new-year gift, and reassures her that the trouble between Mary and Mrs. Warren seems to be improving (<date when="1869-12-22">22</date>). He thanks Kenneth R. H. Mackenzie <pb id="pg-46-xxxvi" n="46:xxxvi"/>for his translation of a life of Bismarck (<date when="1869-12-29">29</date>).

He forwards Norton&#x02019;s letter to his brother John and talks of the recent letter from their brother Alick in Canada; he and Mary are to dine at the Froudes with Ruskin &#x0201C;no help for it&#x0201D; the following day (<date when="1870-01-06">6</date>). He writes to thank Althaus for a present of his book on Britain (<date when="1870-01-07">7</date>) and to Daniel Wilson for his life of Chatterton (<date when="1870-01-10">10</date>). He sends an affectionate letter to Alick in Canada bemoaning the state of &#x0201C;this wretched blockhead &#x00026; beggar of a world.&#x0201D; He finds writing very difficult and dictation to Mary still clumsy (<date when="1870-01-12">12</date>). He thanks John Hunter for the present of a book (<date when="1870-01-14">14</date>) and hesitates over Lady Ashburton&#x02019;s invitation to Melchet Court (<date when="1870-01-18">18</date>). He writes his brother John (<date when="1870-01-22">22</date>) that life for him is &#x0201C;empty and stagnant,&#x0201D; and he finds &#x0201C;neither strength nor <hi rend="italic">heart</hi> for work.&#x0201D; He and Mary are to dine with Forster and Dickens the next day (<date when="1870-01-23">23</date>). Mary is helping to find a governess for Lady Ashburton&#x02019;s daughter. He writes John that his &#x0201C;lame <hi rend="italic">hand</hi> hinders all free writing&#x0201D; and restricts him to proofreading and very little letter-writing. He found Dickens &#x0201C;very cheery&#x0201D; though showing signs of &#x0201C;some perman<hi rend="italic">t</hi> nervous damage&#x0201D; from his U.S. reading tour (<date when="1870-01-28">28</date>).</p>

Back in Chelsea, he writes Lady Ashburton to thank her for two weeks&#x02019; holiday in Melchet Court. Caroline Davenport Bromley calls (<date when="1870-02-23">23</date>). He formalizes with Emerson the arrangement for the bequest of his books, sending him a copy of the catalog (<date when="1870-02-24">24</date>). He writes to thank the author of <hi rend="italic">The Collier&#x02019;s Widow</hi> (<date when="1870-02-28">28</date>).</p>
    <p><hi rend="italic"><date when="1870-03">March</date></hi>. TC thanks Norton for all his help in arranging the Harvard bequest (<date when="1870-03-02">2</date>). Writing to John who is visiting Edinburgh, TC sends his best wishes to Thomas Erskine, who has been unwell, dismisses John Hill Burton as a historian, sends good wishes to David Masson, and derides Amelia Robertson Hill&#x02019;s bust of him (<date when="1870-03-06">6</date> [<date when="1870-03-04">4</date>]). He vigorously denies a suggestion he is a &#x0201C;pantheist&#x0201D; (<date when="1870-03-07">7</date>). He is arranging for a &#x0201C;vignette&#x0201D; of Cromwell&#x02019;s death mask (<date when="1870-03-08">8</date>) and is enjoying <hi rend="italic">Casimir Maremma</hi>, sent to him by Arthur Helps (<date when="1870-03-08">8</date>). He thanks Josephine Shaw Lowell for sending <hi rend="italic">Harvard Memorial Biographies</hi> (<date when="1870-03-10">10</date>). He tells John about a dinner at the Forsters and his meeting with Sir George Grey, ex-Governor of New Zealand (<date when="1870-03-15">15</date>). He sends John a letter received from <pb id="pg-46-xxxvii" n="46:xxxvii"/>Norton and mourns the approaching death of Erskine (<date when="1870-03-19">19</date>). Still working on illustrations for <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi>, he thanks Frederick Anderson for his pencil sketch with its &#x0201C;force and spirit,&#x0201D; though he questions its accuracy (<date when="1870-03-20">20</date> [<date when="1870-03-19">19</date>]). Thomas Erskine dies (<date when="1870-03-20">20</date>). TC writes to reassure Emerson after an accident had delayed the U.S. mail from Britain (<date when="1870-03-24">24</date>). He thanks Sir William Stirling Maxwell for his &#x0201C;beautiful, I might say splendid, Book&#x0201D; (<date when="1870-03-24">24</date>). TC writes Sir George Grey (<date when="1870-03-25">25</date>), reporting his discussions with Lord Derby on emigration and suggesting Grey visit Lord Derby to discuss more fully the whole question. Mary writes to Maria Henshaw (previously Maria Price) regretting that TC cannot find copying work for her sister and telling her that &#x0201C;one of my brothers is here&#x0201D; (James Jr.) and is just leaving (<date when="1870-03-028">28</date>). TC writes again (<date when="1870-03-30">30</date>) to wish Lord Grey success in the Newark by-election where he is standing on the emigration question.</p>
    <p><hi rend="italic"><date when="1870-04">April</date></hi>. TC writes to a young man discouraging him from taking up a career in literature (<date when="1870-04-01">1</date>). He tells John of his walk with Tennyson (<date when="1870-04-02">2</date>). He visits a dentist for an extraction (<date when="1870-04-04">4</date> and <date when="1870-04-05">5</date>), and he is anxious to see Lady Ashburton before she leaves London (<date when="1870-04-05">5</date>). He writes Emerson (<date when="1870-04-06">6</date>) concluding the arrangements for the Harvard bequest, and urging there should be no publicity. He writes David Davidson in Haddington thanking him for sending details of the death of Erskine and telling him that Betty Braid had also sent him an obituary (<date when="1870-04-07">7</date>). He tells John about his tooth extraction and says that &#x0201C;roaring London has got very loud again &#x02026; though I cannot say it contains almost anything I care much ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi>.&#x0201D; He reports that the previous day Lady Ashburton had taken him and Mary driving, to Norwood and Dulwich, and that Peter Swan of Kirkcaldy had called, that Emilie Venturi is coming that evening, and Erasmus Darwin and Frances Wedgwood the following day (<date when="1870-04-12">12</date>). TC writes to hurry the engraver who is copying Cromwell&#x02019;s death mask (<date when="1870-04-13">13</date>). Letters come from Canada, and TC suggests to John that they might help finance their younger relatives there. He walks unwillingly with Allingham and Tait in Hyde Park on the anniversary of JWC&#x02019;s death (<date when="1870-04-21">21</date>). The warmer weather disagrees with TC&#x02019;s health (<date when="1870-04-22">22</date>). He continues to have trouble with Chapman over prints for the library edn. TC walks with Thomas Spedding in the last week of <date when="1870-04">April</date>. He contemplates a holiday with sea air to improve his health (<date when="1870-04-29">29</date>).</p></div1></front>

The &#x0201C;North German Correspondent&#x0201D; of the <hi rend="italic">Newcastle Courant</hi> reported, <date when="1869-02-19">19 Feb.</date>: &#x0201C;The fifth volume of the Life of Frederic the Great, King of Prussia, has just appeared in a German dress. It is no easy matter to translate the works of Mr Thomas Carlyle, and the Life of Frederic II. presented more difficulties than almost any other of his writings to the German translator. For it was necessary that Mr Neuberg should re-examine the sources of the author&#x02019;s information in order that he might give the very words quoted, and not a translation of a translation. The death of that talented gentleman, who had carried down the work successfully to the conclusion of the fourth volume, caused a long lapse of time to intervene before the appearance of the fifth; and it was feared that the undertaking would have to be given up, or that at least no translator could be found capable of filling the place of Mr Neuberg. He has, however, fortunately found a worthy successor in Mr Althaus, and the fifth volume, which has just appeared, is fully worthy of a place beside its predecessors.&#x0201D;</note><pb id="pg-46-11" n="46:11"/>that <hi rend="italic">Plugson</hi> means the son of (<hi rend="italic">Pflock</hi> [<hi rend="italic">wooden peg</hi> or <hi rend="italic">plug</hi>] or <hi rend="italic">St&#x00F6;pfel</hi> [<hi rend="italic">stuffing</hi>]), and is merely intended to indicate a coarse stupid Manchester<note n="2" noteref="51">&#x0201C;Manchester&#x0201D; inserted in MS in another hand, probably Althaus.</note> man; <hi rend="italic">Undershot</hi> is the name used by manufacturers for a mill-wheel supplied with water from below; as <hi rend="italic">overshot</hi> is the name for one supplied from above. <hi rend="italic">Plugson of Undershot</hi> may be said to be emblematic of <hi rend="italic">Manchester Commercial Philosophy</hi>.

Althaus later wrote of the visit: &#x0201C;It seemed as if I had never seen before so bushy, so venerable a head: the thick gray hair hung low over his forehead, the beard was brushed toward the face, the eyebrows fell thickly over the deep-set gray eyes. Later, he took a comb from his pocket and combed his hair all the way toward the front and then back against his brow; but the bushy gray setting of the weather-tanned face impressed me as characteristic. Within, it seemed to me, lay something solitary, withdrawn from the world, veiled. I often wished that he would throw off this shock of hair completely and let his face freely emerge: only then would he be seen as he is&#x0201D; (F.

He concluded by justifying the materialist investigation of life, while insisting that materialism as a philosophy of ultimate existence was no more legitimate than spiritualism: &#x0201C;In itself it is of little moment whether we express the phenomena of matter in terms of spirit; or the phenomena of spirit, in terms of matter; matter may be regarded as a form of thought, thought may be regarded as a property of matter&#x02014;each statement has a certain relative truth. But with a view to the progress of science, the materialistic terminology is in every way to be preferred. For it connects thought with the other phenomena of the universe, and suggests inquiry into the nature of those physical conditions, or concomitants of thought, which are more or less accessible to us, and a knowledge of which may, in future, help us to exercise the same kind of control over the world of thought as we already possess in respect of the material world; whereas, the alternative, or spiritualistic, terminology is utterly barren, and leads to nothing but obscurity and confusion of ideas&#x0201D; (11:145). John A. Carlyle replied: &#x0201C;I have not seen Huxley&#x02019;s article, &#x00026; perhaps it is hardly worth reading. Let him try how dark &#x00026; base a view of man he can take, so long as it is permitted to him!

I was able to say on the spot that this was an error. From my own direct questionings I had learned that the feelings of the old man were those of gratitude rather than of dislike. At a time when his own countrymen, failing to recognise his need of a form of expression suited to his genius, had set him down as merely eccentric and wayward &#x02026; America &#x02026; had opened to him her mind, her heart, her purse. Still, to make assurance doubly sure, I told Grant-Duff that I would go down to Chelsea and make myself acquainted with Carlyle&#x02019;s present feelings. I went, and mentioned this conjectural dislike of Americans. &#x02018;What nonsense!&#x02019; he exclaimed; &#x02018;bring him down here immediately&#x02019;&#x0201D; (Tyndall, &#x0201C;Personal Recollections&#x0201D; 25). Norton had already heard a great deal about TC from various friends, including James Fitzjames Stephen; Norton wrote to a friend, <date when="1869-01-01">1 Jan.</date>: &#x0201C;[Fitzjames Stephen] is a great friend of Carlyle&#x02019;s, and walks with him often on Sunday afternoons. He says Carlyle is habitually in a state of very cheerful despondency, appropriate to the most wilfully dyspeptic man in her Majesty&#x02019;s Dominions. He is growing old, and has to be humoured a good deal. He is more extravagant in talk than ever; but one would rather hear him talk for two hours than any other man in London,&#x02014;&#x02018;and besides, he is so kind, with a real hearty kindness&#x02019;&#x0201D; (<hi rend="italic">Norton&#x02019;s Letters</hi> 1:314).</note> on the contrary, I feel a nat<hi rend="italic">l</hi> blood-relat<hi rend="italic">n</hi>ship to them, and am <hi rend="italic">sad</hi> when they are not of that pleasant category.<note n="2" noteref="158">Norton described the meeting in his journal, <date when="1869-03-23">23 March</date>: &#x0201C;Carlyle came in, in look like his recent photographs, save that there is less of despair and despondency in his actual countenance, and less wildness and uncouthness in his hair and aspect generally. His frame is large, his head is heavy and seems to have bent his broad shoulders, but there is nothing either in look or manner to suggest the feebleness of age. He is seventy-four years old, but he seems younger than his years. His hair is iron grey and he was dressed in a grey woolen wrapper buttoned round his chest and falling like a long dressing gown to his very feet, which were cased in slippers. No one could see him without being impressed by the massive shape and strong lines of his countenance and with the force and brilliancy of his deep-set eyes. He received us quietly and pleasantly, with a certain air of shyness, I fancied&#x0201D; (<hi rend="italic">Norton&#x02019;s Letters</hi> 1:323). TC talked to Grant-Duff about recent parliamentary debates, which he called &#x0201C;the miserable degradation of the faculties of man in such a convocation of discoursers&#x0201D; (<hi rend="italic">Norton&#x02019;s Letters</hi> 1:324); Norton noted: &#x0201C;All this talk was lightened by the play of Carlyle&#x02019;s face and by the laugh with which he showed his own sense of the fun in the sallies of his extravagance or his humour. He would seem to be desperately in earnest in his objurgations when the humour would surprise him, as it were, in spite of himself and he had to give way to it&#x0201D; (<hi rend="italic">Norton&#x02019;s Letters</hi> 1:325). Norton concluded his journal entry: &#x0201C;It was half-past ten when we came away. The old man came to the door with us and out on the step, where he stood talking, bareheaded, in the moonlight, leaning forward, with one hand raised, as he urged upon Tyndall the consideration of a new theory he had propounded as to the cause of the internal heat of the earth.

<head><sender>TC</sender> TO <addressee>JOSEPH HENDERSON</addressee></head><docBody><p>The picture is beautiful (colouring, finish, &#x00026;c. all excellent);<note n="1" noteref="178">Henderson had been commissioned to do a portrait of JWC from a photograph; Percy Bate wrote about the commission: &#x0201C;Glasgow folk did not &#x02026; pay too lavishly at that time for either pictures or drawings, and Joseph Henderson, with domestic claims increasing and sitters few and infrequent, did not disdain the production of likenesses painted from photographs. Many of these doubtless survive; of one of them, at any rate, a pleasant souvenir still exists in the shape of a letter from Thomas Carlyle [see <ref target="volume-46/lt-18690508-TC-JH-01">TC to JH, <date when="1869-05-08">8 May</date></ref>]&#x0201D; (P.

Henderson was also a watercolorist, so possibly it was a small watercolor portrait sent to TC as he mentions its coloring, rather than a photograph of an oil painting. The portrait is untraced.</note> and has a <hi rend="italic">great resemblance</hi>,&#x02014;though to me almost a distressing one, the <hi rend="italic">expression</hi> being such a failure! In general, I find the look of the face to be sickly, <hi rend="italic">suffering</hi>, and even <hi rend="italic">querulous</hi>,&#x02014;which latter it surely never was. The <hi rend="italic">photograph</hi>, as I have always read it, has something of a gentle <hi rend="italic">stoical smile</hi>; nothing of <hi rend="italic">complaint</hi>, though perhaps there is visible also enough to complain of. Such at least was the habitual expression of the <hi rend="italic">face</hi> in such situation.</p><p>I am too little of an artist to say what detail, or details (probably something very small) would quite rectify the picture; I was struck, first of all, by the <hi rend="italic">smallness</hi> and comparative insignificance of the <hi rend="italic">eye</hi>,&#x02014;and have sent Mr M<hi rend="italic">c</hi>Nab<note n="2" noteref="179">Alexander Macnab (b. ca. <date when="1822">1822</date>), Glasgow photographic artist and portrait painter; his studio was at 92 W.

The <hi rend="italic">new</hi> photograph which shows both the eyes,<note n="3" noteref="180">Apparently the photograph of JWC used by Henderson was a side view and that sent to Macnab a front view.

On a walk with Charles Eliot Norton, <date when="1869-05-01">early May</date>, Norton described TC&#x02019;s conversation in detail, including TC&#x02019;s thoughts about his books: &#x0201C;I suppose there never was a man who had so much to do with books as I have, who owned so few. &#x02026; But in writing about Cromwell and Friedrich I have chanced to get together some things not wholly worthless nor yet easy to find, and I&#x02019;ve thought I should like when I die to leave these books to some institution in New England, where they might be preserved, and where they would serve as a testimony o&#x02019; the goodness o&#x02019; your people toward me and o&#x02019; the many acts of kindness they have done me; and perhaps you can help me to have this rightly done&#x0201D; (<hi rend="italic">Norton&#x02019;s Letters</hi> 1:336). Norton wrote to TC, <date when="1869-05-24">24 May</date>, with his suggestion for an appropriate beneficiary in the U.S.: &#x0201C;I believe that your wishes would best be carried out were you to leave the books you propose to give, to the Library of Harvard College, Cambridge, Massachusetts&#x0201D; (<hi rend="italic">Norton&#x02019;s Letters</hi> 1:339). Norton quoted TC&#x02019;s affirmation of his intention, written, &#x0201C;so illegibly that the quotation must be incomplete,&#x0201D; on the reverse of his letter: &#x02018;n.b.

    <p>I have rec<hi rend="italic">d</hi> all y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Letters &#x00026; news; and find it very good [of] you to keep patiently writing, time after time, with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> getting any response from me: I guess you know what is the reason; that it cannot be my want of will, but my want of power most probably!<note n="1" noteref="223">Since TC&#x02019;s last recorded letter to John A. Carlyle, <date when="1869-05-06">6 May</date>, John had written four letters to him. However Mary Aitken wrote often, both to her mother and to him, with news of TC, so presumably he felt less need of writing regularly, particularly given his difficulties with handwriting.</note> Wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is indeed the fact; this time especially I have been waiting, every day, the last fortnight, for a fit hour; and, by one poor cause and another, <hi rend="italic">c</hi>d not find one.

In effect we are &#x0201C;changing our dinner-hour to 3 p.m.,&#x0201D; resolute to carry it out (<hi rend="italic">some change</hi> being clamorously indispensable),&#x02014;and all <hi rend="italic">new</hi> roads, as you know, being <hi rend="italic">rough</hi>, are liable to produce <hi rend="italic">tumbles</hi>.

    <p>I have this morning received the two beautiful <hi rend="italic">quartos</hi>, which your obliging letter of yesterday announced to me. They are among the beautifullest <pb id="pg-46-56" n="46:56"/>volumes I have seen; beautifully printed, illustrated, and indexed,&#x02014;in short, victoriously <hi rend="italic">edited</hi>, and made clear to every reader.<note n="1" noteref="244">William Fraser, ed., <hi rend="italic">The Red Book of Grandtully</hi>, 2 vols.

The book consists of charters and letters, dating from the thirteenth to the nineteenth century, relating to the Grandtully branch of the Steuart family, together with a history of the family written by Fraser.</note> I promise myself a great deal of entertainment and historical instruction in examining those curious old documents and correspondences, here brought to light in such a legible form. I beg you will convey to Sir William Drummond Steuart, Baronet, my lively sense of the great honour and kindness he has been pleased to do me, of which I shall not fail to entertain a grateful and pleasant memory henceforth.<note n="2" noteref="245">TC was sent one of the hundred copies of the book, which were printed privately for Sir William Drummond Steuart (<date when="1795">1795</date>&#x02013;<date when="1871">1871</date>), 7th bart. of Grandtully, soldier and adventurer; he traveled through the American frontier country for several years in the <date when="1830">1830</date>s and again in the early <date when="1840">1840</date>s.</note></p>

Carlyle reported on the improvements at Craigenputtoch, <date when="1869-07-12">12 July</date>: &#x0201C;Yesterday James Aitken, Annie, Tom &#x00026; I went early to Craigenputtock, &#x00026; staid there about eight hours. The day was very favourable, &#x00026; we walked through most of the woods &#x00026; fields before dinner, which was at two o&#x02019;clock; &#x00026; in the afternoon we went to the top of the Hill. I never saw the whole place look so well &#x00026; orderly. In the woods all the necessary drains have been restored, so that the roots of all the trees that are left now stand in firm ground, instead of being half-afloat as in former years: &#x00026; the rotten branches have been knocked off &#x00026; cleared away so as to give the winds less chance of making farther havock. And the dike of that part which is ready for replanting in autumn has been strongly rebuilt &#x00026; all rubbish of old trees &#x00026; roots removed; so that planting can be done whenever the proper time comes. The new triangular plantation of Stumpy looks thriving, &#x00026; plenty of the plants are growing well&#x02014;especially spruces &#x00026; birches. / The new meadow has got an excellent dike, &#x00026; even this year&#x02014;before draining &#x00026; lime have taken full effect&#x02014;will have a considerable crop of hay. And on the old meadow, which in Common&#x02019;s time had the unsightly &#x00026; ill-filled drains, there is an excellent crop of hay from the dunging of last year. The walls of the dwelling-house were &#x02018;pointed&#x02019; about a month ago with good mortar, the green space in front has been cleared of docks, &#x00026; rhododendrons &#x00026;c. planted in it here &#x00026; there; &#x00026; the garden got forty cart-loads of fresh soil put into it last spring &#x00026; is now deep enough for growing anything. Most of it this year is occupied with greens, cabbage &#x00026; potatoes. / It gave me considerable comfort &#x00026; satisfaction to find everything in such good order. Young James seems to have a real talent for managing things of the sort both thriftily &#x00026; effectually, &#x00026; his father too is always there at the right time to give good advice, &#x00026; takes interest in everything that is required. An old moss on the hill, which Alick used to make use of&#x02014;about 600 paces from the dwelling-house&#x02014;has been opened again this year, &#x00026; plenty of good peats got out if it &#x00026; stacked within the threshing-mill shed. And Jamie has a theory that quite incomparably good peats can be got there by going deeper, &#x00026; had resolved to have a few &#x02018;cast&#x02019; this morning by way of trial, the weather still being very droughty &#x00026; the situation high &#x00026; open. He meant to begin this experimental casting with his own hand. / All the stock of sheep &#x00026; cattle looked healthy &#x00026; thriving, but the proportion of lambs is rather smaller this season than usual.&#x0201D;</note> poor old Moorland <hi rend="italic">Home</hi>, the obstructed but kindly Days I had <pb id="pg-46-59" n="46:59"/>there shine out on me from afar with a strange pathetic brightness in the vanished <hi rend="italic">Long-Ago</hi>; &#x00026; it is perennially interesting to me, tho&#x02019; probably enoug<supplied>[h]</supplied> I shall never see it ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi>.

The statue had arrived at Peterhead, <date when="1868-10-06">6 Oct. 1868</date>, and was unveiled on Tolbooth Green, <date when="1869-08-16">16 Aug. 1869</date>. The <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph</hi> reported, <date when="1869-08-19">19 Aug.</date>: &#x0201C;PETERHEAD, in Aberdeenshire, has just witnessed a local celebration which has the advantage of not belonging to the centenary species. It has not been noised abroad in the newspapers; no literary or other &#x02018;lions&#x02019; had been invited to roar at the ceremony. The Scottish town has done its own hero-worship, in its own quiet, prudent, self-possessed, and earnest way.&#x0201D; Keith became a highly valued and trusted Marshal of Frederick the Great, and as such featured in <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi>, which led William I (<date when="1797">1797</date>&#x02013;<date when="1888">1888</date>), king of Prussia, to offer to send to Peterhead a copy of the statue of Keith in Berlin. The <hi rend="italic">Telegraph</hi> report continued: &#x0201C;There is something in this, we hope&#x02014;in this deliberate expression on the part of the King ruling a great people&#x02014;to console THOMAS CARLYLE for his laborious struggles with the &#x02018;German Dryasdust.&#x02019; As for his long journeying, his patient visits to every Bohemian, Saxon, or Silesian battle-ground, they were all in his day&#x02019;s work as a modern &#x02018;Scot abroad.&#x02019; Peterhead has to thank THOMAS CARLYLE for the statue; and it is not the only thing for which the thanks of Peterhead, and of the British Empire in general, are due to that strong and generous writer&#x02014;who, in his good hope, has done much noble work for the humanity of which he despairs.&#x0201D; See also <hi rend="italic">Memoir of Marshal Keith, With a Sketch of the Keith Family</hi>, [ed.

This I had sought for weeks but had not found it. It came at last. The spell of sleeplessness was broken, the food well digested and well applied and I felt as I stood there, puffing my cigar, a joy of life&#x02014;a pleasure in mere existence&#x02014;such as I have not felt for years. It was moreover no flash in the pan&#x02014;for day after day this feeling of health made life in the hills a pleasure to me. / <hi rend="italic">You</hi> crossed my thoughts and got entangled among them as I stood upon my mountain Knob, and I wished intensely that I could have had you there for 10 days, to prove the effect of the mountain air upon you. The experiment of going there would be dangerous, for the hotel, though a comparatively quiet one would not be called quiet by you.&#x0201D; Tyndall injured himself after bathing under a cascade: &#x0201C;My clothes were 20 yards distant from the cascade, and in returning to them I crossed&#x02014;unnecessarily&#x02014;some loose blocks of granite. It was the shortest way. The thought of caution never occurred to me, for there was nothing to excite it. So I slipped and fell.&#x0201D; His injuries became inflamed: &#x0201C;on the whole this paltry stagger lost me 6 weeks of bed &#x00026; the loss of all my splendid health. I came &#x02026; to Folkestone a fortnight ago&#x02014;there I halted for I could hardly walk 50 yards. Before I quitted it I was equal to 10 miles.

The case is this.</p><p>For many years back, a thought, which I used to check again as fond and silly, has been occasionally present to me, Of testifying my gratitude to New England (New England, acting mainly through one of her Sons called Waldo Emerson) by <hi rend="italic">bequeathing to it my poor Falstaff Regiment, latterly two Falstaff Regiments, of Books</hi>, those I purchased and used in writing <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi>, and d<hi rend="italic">o</hi> those on <hi rend="italic">Friedrich the Great</hi>. &#x0201C;This could be done,&#x0201D; I often said to myself, &#x0201C;this <hi rend="italic">could</hi> perhaps; and this would be a real satisfaction to me! But who then would march through Coventry with such a set!&#x0201D;<note n="3" noteref="549">See <hi rend="italic">Henry IV, Part I</hi> 4.2; Falstaff was supposed to be gathering a regiment of good fighting men; he had allowed them all to buy their way out and was left with only the dregs (the old, the young, the infirm, the criminals) and was too ashamed to ride with them through Coventry to meet the rest of the army. TC used the same reference in a letter to Emerson in <date when="1842">1842</date>; see <ref target="volume-15/lt-18420829-TC-RWE-01"><sic>15:57</sic><corr>TC to RWE, <date when="1842-08-29">29 Aug. 1842</date></corr></ref>.</note> The extreme insignificance of the Gift, this and nothing else, always gave me pause.</p>

At home we always thought Mary very prudent for not meddling in any way with the servants. She would rather have tried to hide their faults than speak of them. But I noticed a suspicious way Mrs W. had whenever you had occasion to find fault with the hard mutton for instance&#x02014;or the dirty room she always laid the blame to my account &#x00026; banged about trying to [&#x02026;] me into proper subjection, by refusing perhaps to let the lassie do an errand for me or sending my lunch up an hour or so later than usual&#x02014;fragments of something w<hi rend="italic">ch</hi> she &#x00026; Charlotte had dined off long before! This I took the liberty of declining to touch or make the least remark upon. We never had words that I recollect of; but I felt if I had staid much longer we would soon have come to the unbearable point. / I can see by the sad but temperate tone of Mary&#x02019;s letter that she has probably born a good deal before she came to the full determination of leaving for I know she is very fond of you &#x00026; I believe <hi rend="italic">has</hi> done her best to be a comfort to you while she staid: but looking at the thing on all sides I really cannot think her decision wrong or rash; when I think of the cruel unjust way Mrs W. bullied those little lasses I for one sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> never wish a child of mine to be at her mercy.

Among this correspondence was the letter supposedly written by Montcalm, <date when="1759-08-24">24 Aug. 1759</date>, to his cousin Matthieu Fran&#xE7;ois Mol&#xE9; (<date when="1705">1705</date>&#x02013;<date when="1793">93</date>), in which he predicted that the fall of Canada would result in the revolt of the British Colonies; TC quoted this letter in <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi>; see Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 18:144&#x02013;46. The marquis de Montcalm had two versions of the letter, in different handwritings; Parkman had them copied, and on his return to Boston he conducted further investigations, which led him and the Committee of the Massachusetts Historical Society to believe that the English version of the letter was probably the original, and the French copies two separate translations, and that therefore the letter was a forgery (<hi rend="italic">Proceedings</hi> 125). Parkman wrote to the marquis de Montcalm, <date when="1869-09-10">10 Sept.</date>, asking him to confirm whether the handwriting in either copy of the letter was Montcalm&#x02019;s; the marquis replied, <date when="1869-10-02">2 Oct.</date>, that neither copy was in Montcalm&#x02019;s handwriting: &#x0201C;They were, I think, sent over from England at the end of the last century, and then translated into French&#x0201D; (<hi rend="italic">Proceedings</hi> 127).</note></p><p>Here in Engl<hi rend="italic">d</hi>, for above a year past,&#x02014;when a new Edition (7 <hi rend="italic">voll. post octavo</hi>) <pb id="pg-46-134" n="46:134"/>of that Book on <hi rend="italic">Friedrich</hi> was sent forth,&#x02014;there has been no doubt left but the Almond Pamphlet was a <hi rend="small-caps">forgery</hi>.<note n="4" noteref="660">TC had received two newspaper articles from Boston, April and <date when="1868-05">May 1868</date>, suggesting that the letter was a forgery (see <ref target="volume-45/lt-18680518-TC-JCA-01"><sic>45:131</sic><corr>TC to JCA, <date when="1868-05-18">18 May 1868</date></corr></ref>) and, on investigation, had agreed with them.

In other respects your poor Hesekiel,<note n="2" noteref="674">Johann Georg Ludwig Hesekiel (<date when="1819">1819</date>&#x02013;<date when="1874">74</date>), German journalist, author, and editor.</note> was but an uncertain flary kind of light, largely intermixed with smoke and confused intermittency of <hi rend="italic">pitch</hi>-droppings, ashes and darkness; welcome truly in our great need, but only to be welcomed on that ground. Could not you, from Hesekiel and other [of] your own resources, contrive some Account of Bismarck and his Procedures, thoroughly <hi rend="italic">intelligible</hi> to English readers, and really applicable to our English wants about him? To all intelligent readers, it would be right welcome at present.</p><p>As to this Hesekiel, he is somewhat an enigma to me.

I wish much you would abolish Hesekiel by a right Book of your own!</p><p>Meanwhile, I am much obliged by what you have already done,&#x02014;the whole enhanced, in my particular case, by your peculiar civility in sending me a Copy and such proofs of your goodwill.<note n="4" noteref="676">Mackenzie wrote in the preface to <hi rend="italic">The Life of Bismarck</hi>: &#x0201C;The combination of an honest minister with a noble-minded king &#x02026; is rare. In Frederick the Second of Prussia, as to some extent in the first Napoleon, there was a will to be honest; but where the latter failed in his task, the former prevailed in the hearts of the people, and the admiration of the world.

As one of the translators of the &#x02018;History of Frederick the Great&#x02019; Dr. Althaus is naturally interested in its author; and the account of the manner in which that book was written will probably be new to the English public. Dr. Althaus says that, with a view of insuring quiet and guarding against interruption, Mr. Carlyle added another storey to his house; the whole of the new storey consisting of one large room, which was given up to his library. The only books admitted into this room were those that related to the history of Frederick the Great, but they occupied a considerable space, and, as the work advanced, the pile on the library-table became more and more formidable. Dr. Althaus contradicts the further report that the room was filled with a cloud of smoke from Carlyle&#x02019;s pipe, and that the composition of the History was carried on under this cover. Mr. Carlyle, he says, is as indefatigable a worker as those German Dryasdusts to whom this habit is ascribed, but he does not equal them in smoking. It may be that this has caused him to fall so far short of them in obscurity.&#x0201D;</note></p><p><pb id="pg-46-141" n="46:141"/>I return you many thanks; and remain,<note n="4" noteref="705">From here, the writing is TC&#x02019;s.</note> Dear Sir,</p>

Day before yesterday, to spare myself the expense of writing a Note, and in hope of finding somebody to speak with ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Erskine, I called at Stirling&#x02019;s House;<note n="6" noteref="920">Stirling Maxwell&#x02019;s London home was at 10 Upper Grosvenor St., Mayfair.</note> but all were gone out, and the Note itself remained indispensable.</p>
    <p>Sunday last Macmillan<note n="7" noteref="921">Alexander Macmillan.</note> came, with one Geikie the Geologist,<note n="8" noteref="922">Sir Archibald Geikie (<date when="1835">1835</date>&#x02013;<date when="1924">1924</date>; <ref target="volume-46/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/33364"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), Edinburgh geologist and historian. Geikie was traveling through London on his way to study the volcanic districts of the Lipari Islands in southern Italy. He later wrote: &#x0201C;When the door &#x02026; was opened by a little housemaid, the philosopher himself was seen standing at the far end of the narrow lobby, looking as if he would rather receive no callers. As soon as he recognised my friend, however, he came forward to meet us. He was wearing a black velvet cap, a grey coat or dressing-gown that reached to his feet, and had a long clay-pipe in his mouth. He &#x02026; led us upstairs to his drawing-room&#x02014;a quaint little chamber, with a number of antique pictures on the walls, some of them, perhaps, portraits of Mrs. Carlyle&#x02019;s forbears, and with old-fashioned nick-nacks dotted over the room. The grate with Dutch tiles up each side of the fireplace, the antique chairs and the various stools were all in excellent harmony, and one could see that some woman&#x02019;s hand, guided by good taste, had attended to the furnishing of the room. &#x02026; But the man himself was the chief centre of attraction. He sat between us right in front of the fire. Fortunately he was in the mood to talk, and soon found himself dealing with Daniel Wilson&#x02019;s recently published biography of Chatterton [see <ref target="volume-46/lt-18700110-TC-DW-01"><corr>TC to DW, <date when="1870-01-10">10 Jan.</date></corr></ref>]. &#x02026; He looked on Chatterton as one who never seemed to get into the essence and truth of things, but was more taken up with the roll, and the marching, and the trumpet-clang. He passed on to David Gray [<date when="1838">1838</date>&#x02013;<date when="1861">61</date>; <ref target="volume-46/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/11331"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>], the poor Scottish poet, who, he said, had something in him, but lost himself from the foolish desire to be famous. No one, he thought, has any business to wish to be famous, but should be content to do his own work honestly and well. He enlarged on the &#x02018;jackassery&#x02019; of the world in its craving for novels. &#x02026; <supplied>[H]</supplied>e gave us some graphic glimpses of scenes in his own life. He remembered having climbed the Lomond Hills of Fife with Edward Irving, and found the Ordnance Survey sappers at work there, one of them a surly fellow, who at last was fairly won over by Irving&#x02019;s imperturbable good nature. &#x02026; I was able to tell him some anecdotes of Ayrshire lairds and clergymen, and had the gratification of evoking from him such peals of laughter as I hardly ever heard before. He seemed sorry when we rose to leave, came down to the door with us, halting two or three times on the staircase to ask questions about the rocks of his native Dumfriesshire&#x0201D; (Archibald Geikie, <hi rend="italic">A Long Life&#x02019;s Work: An Autobiography</hi> [<date when="1924">1924</date>] 133&#x02013;34).</note> a <hi rend="italic">gleg</hi> little fellow; both of whom bragged of having met you at Masson&#x02019;s just before y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> leaving.

Grey wished to stand as a Liberal, but prime minister Gladstone opposed his candidacy because of Grey&#x02019;s more radical views on the colonies, emigration, and Home Rule for Ireland. Gladstone later supported Home Rule.</note> For he considers <hi rend="italic">emigration</hi> by far the most important question now on foot in England,<note n="2" noteref="938">Grey stood as an independent Liberal, committed to &#x0201C;promoting measures calculated to foster and advance the morality, welfare, and commerce of this vast empire . &#x02026; [and] opposed to the views of those who advocate the severance of the colonies from Great Britain, believing that they add to her strength, wealth, and glory. In accordance with these opinions, I have striven to initiate a policy of emigration, by which, if conducted under proper conditions, our colonies would be regarded as the natural outlet for our excessive population, and instead of being looked upon as places of exile would be considered &#x02026; a home and heritage for the people of England&#x0201D; (Rees 2:448).</note> and you of all Englishmen the most likely to bring it to a useful result. But for many years he has been resolved &#x02018;neither to vote nor be voted for, nor in any way to concern himself&#x02019; with any Parliament that can now be in England. But I am copying the parts out of his books in which he speaks of emigration,<note n="3" noteref="939">Passages untraced, but presumably some from <hi rend="italic">Chartism</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Past and Present</hi>; see <ref target="volume-46/lt-18700325-TC-JAC-01"><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1870-03-25">25 March</date></corr></ref>.</note> and shall forward them to you to-morrow.

Truly y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> acc<hi rend="italic">t</hi> of matters threw a glow of life into my tho<hi rend="italic">ts</hi> wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is very rare there now; altogether a gratifying little Transact<hi rend="italic">n</hi> to me,&#x02014;and I must add a surprising, for the enthusiasm of good-will is evid<hi rend="italic">tly</hi> great, and the occasion is almost infinitesimally small! Well, well; it is all finished off and completed,&#x02014;(you can tell Mr Eliot, with many thanks from me, that I did introduce the proper style, &#x0201C;Presid<hi rend="italic">t</hi> and Fellows,&#x0201D; &#x00026;c, and have forgotten nothing of what he said, or of what he <hi rend="italic">did</hi>);&#x02014;and so we will say only, <hi rend="italic">Faustum sit</hi> [may <pb id="pg-46-190" n="46:190"/>it turn out well], as our last word on the subject;&#x02014;and to me it will be, for some days yet, under these vernal skies, something that is itself connected with <hi rend="small-caps">the</hi> S<hi rend="small-caps">pring</hi> in a still higher sense; a little white and red-lipped bit of <hi rend="italic">Daisy</hi> pure and poor, scattered into T<hi rend="small-caps">ime&#x02019;s</hi> Seedfield,<note n="2" noteref="964">Cf. Goethe, &#x0201C;Die Zeit ist mein Besitz, mein Acker ist die Zeit,&#x0201D; <hi rend="italic">West-&#x00F6;stlicher Divan</hi> (Goethe, <hi rend="italic">Werke</hi> 5:55); see <hi rend="italic">Chartism</hi>, Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 29:193.</note> and struggling above ground there, uttering <hi rend="italic">its</hi> bit of prophecy withal, among the ox-hoofs and big jungles that are everywhere ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> and not prophetic of much!&#x02014;</p>
    <p>One thing only I regret, that you <hi rend="italic">have</hi> spoken of the affair!<note n="3" noteref="965">Emerson wrote, <date when="1870-03-21">21 March</date>: &#x0201C;It is very amiable &#x00026; noble in you to have kept this surprise for us in your older days. Did you mean to show us that you could not be old, but immortally young? &#x00026; having kept us all murmuring at your Satires &#x00026; sharp homilies, will now melt us with this manly &#x00026; heartwarming embrace? Nobody could predict &#x00026; none could better it. And you shall even go your own gait henceforward with a blessing from us all, &#x00026; a trust exceptional &#x00026; unique. I do not longer hesitate to talk to such good men as I see of this gift, &#x00026; it has in every ear a gladdening effect. People like to see character in a gift, &#x00026; from rare character the gift is more precious.&#x0201D;</note> For God&#x02019;s sake don&#x02019;t; and those kindly people to whom you have,&#x02014;swear them to silence for love of me! The poor little <hi rend="italic">Daisy</hi>kin will get into the Newsp<hi rend="italic">rs</hi>, and become the nastiest of Cabbages:&#x02014;silence, silence, I do beg of you to the utmost stretch of y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> power! Or is the case already irremediable? I will hope not. Talk about such things, especially Penny Editor&#x02019;s talk, is like vile coal-smoke filling y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> poor little world; silence alone is azure, and has a <hi rend="italic">sky</hi> to it.&#x02014;&#x02014; But, enough now.</p>
    <p>The &#x0201C;little Book&#x0201D;<note n="4" noteref="966"><hi rend="italic">Society and Solitude</hi>.</note> never came; and, I doubt, never will: it is a fate that seems to await three fourths of the Books that attempt to reach me by the <hi rend="italic">American</hi> Post; owing to some <hi rend="italic">informality in wrapping</hi> (I have heard);&#x02014;it never gave me any notable <hi rend="italic">regret</hi> till now. How<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, I had already bo<hi rend="italic">t</hi> myself an English copy, rather gaudy little volume (probably intended for the <hi rend="italic">railways</hi>, as if <hi rend="italic">it</hi> were a Book to be read there), but perfectly printed, ready to be read anywhere by the open eye and earnest mind;&#x02014;wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I read here, accordingly, with great attent<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, clear assent for most part, and admiring recognit<hi rend="italic">n</hi>. It seems to me you are all y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> old self here, and something <hi rend="italic">more</hi>. A calm insight, piercing to the very centre; a beautiful sympathy, a beautiful <hi rend="italic">epic</hi> humour; a soul peaceably irrefragable in this loud-jangling world, of wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> it sees the ugliness, but <hi rend="italic">notices</hi> only the huge new <hi rend="italic">opulences</hi> (still so anarchic); knows the electric telegraph, with all its vulgar botherat<hi rend="italic">ns</hi> and impertinences, accurately for what it is, and d<hi rend="italic">o</hi> d<hi rend="italic">o</hi> the oldest eternal Theologies of men. All this belongs to the Highest Class of tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> (you may depend upon it); and ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi> seemed to me as, in several respects, the one perfectly <hi rend="italic">human</hi> voice I had heard among my fellow-creatures for a long time. And then the &#x0201C;style,&#x0201D; <pb id="pg-46-191" n="46:191"/>the treat<hi rend="italic">t</hi> and express<hi rend="italic">n</hi>,&#x02014;yes, it is inimitable, best-Emersonian thro&#x02019;out. Such brevity, simplicity, softness, homely grace; with such a penetrating meaning, <hi rend="italic">soft</hi> enough, but irresistible, going down to the depths and up to the heights, as <hi rend="italic">silent electricity</hi> goes. You have done <hi rend="italic">very well</hi>; and many will know it even better by degrees.&#x02014; Only one thing farther I will note: How you go as if altog<hi rend="italic">r</hi> on the &#x0201C;Over-Soul,&#x0201D; the Ideal, the Perfect or Universal &#x00026; Eternal in this Life of ours; and take so little heed of the frightful quantities of <hi rend="italic">friction</hi> and perverse <hi rend="italic">impediment</hi> there everywhere are; the reflections upon wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> in my own poor life made me now &#x00026; then very sad, as I read you. Ah me, ah me; what a vista it is, mournful, beautiful, <hi rend="italic">unfathomable</hi> as Eternity itself, these last 50 years of Time to me!&#x02014;</p>
    <p>Let me not forget to thank you for that <hi rend="italic">fourth</hi> page of y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Note; I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> say it was almost the most interest<hi rend="italic">g</hi> of all, News from y<hi rend="italic">r</hi>self at first hand; a momentary glimpse into the act<hi rend="italic">l</hi> Household at Concord, face to face, as in years of old!

    <p>This appendix in the <hi rend="italic">CL</hi> includes Jane Baillie Welsh&#x02019;s &#x0002F; Jane Welsh Carlyle&#x02019;s letters to Isabella McTurk, then Dinwoodie, <date when="1823">1823</date>, ca. <date when="1831">1831</date>, <date when="1848">1848</date>, and <date when="1857">1857</date>/<date when="1858">58</date>. In the <hi rend="ital">CLO</hi>, these letters have been moved to their proper chronological location (see the links provided below). The print edition also includes two letters from Grace Welsh, JWC&#x02019;s mother, to Isabella Dinwoodie. They are placed chronologically below. The McTurk &#x0002F; Dinwoodie letters are followed in the <hi rend="italic">CL</hi> by <ref target="volume-46/ed-46-appendix-two">Appendix Two</ref>, consisting of some of JWC&#x02019;s letters to various correspondents, <date when="1850">1850</date>&#x02013;<date when="1866">66</date>, also found too late to be placed chronologically. We introduce them with a letter from Susan Stirling, novelist, to John Riddle Stodart, both Edinburgh friends of JWC&#x02019;s from the early part of her marriage before the Carlyles&#x02019; departure for London in <date when="1834">1834</date>. Susan Stirling&#x02019;s assessment of JWC&#x02019;s brilliance in this letter provides an appropriate introduction to this series of JWC&#x02019;s letters, showing as it does the private reputation that JWC had among her friends and acquaintances.</p>

<title>Jane Welsh Carlyle&#x02019;s letters to Isabella McTurk, later Dinwoodie</title>
    <p>The folder (MS: NLS Acc. 12039) which contains JWC&#x02019;s letters to McTurk &#x0002F; Dinwoodie has pages of etched sayings attached to it with the last page signed in the bottom right hand corner &#x0201C;To Isabella McTurk &#x0002F; from &#x0002F; Jane Carlyle.&#x0201D; As well as the letters, it also contains an undated note: &#x0201C;This Folio was Etched and mostly written by Jane Carlyle some of the writings being original and some copies. As will be seen it was presented by her to Isabella McTurk (my Mother) and has never been out of our possession[.] We have also in our possession a pencil Portrate [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] of M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Welsh done by her daughter Jane Welsh or Carlyle when 12 years of age<supplied>[.]</supplied> / M. A. Dinwoodie&#x0201D; (MS: NLS Acc. 12039). For the portrait of Grace Welsh (previously owned by Joan Gillan, widow of Dr. James Gillan, descendant of Isabella Dinwoodie; see also <ref target="volume-30/lt-18551021-JWC-J-01"><sic>30:260</sic></ref>), see 203. Previously we have followed JWC&#x02019;s usage of Dunwoodie as Isabella&#x02019;s married surname (see, for example, <ref target="volume-34/lt-18581230-JWC-MR-01"><sic>34:257</sic><corr>JWC to MR, <date when="1858-12-30">30 Dec. 1858</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-36/ed-36-biographical-notes"><sic>36:280</sic></ref>) but we are now using Dinwoodie, the spelling used by her daughter, Mary Agnes Dinwoodie, and by Grace Welsh in her letters to Isabella after her marriage (see below); Dinwoodie is also the spelling on Isabella McTurk and William Dinwoodie&#x02019;s marriage listing recorded in the register (Register House, Edinburgh). For the portrait of Isabella Dinwoodie, painted during her widowhood (donated to the Carlyle Society by her descendant John Beddoes), see <ref target="volume-23/lt-18480421-JWC-IMD-01">JWC to IMD, <date when="1848-04-21">21 April [1848]</date></ref>.</p>

<title>Grace Welsh&#x02019;s letters to Isabella McTurk Dinwoodie</title>
    
<p>Grace Welsh also corresponded with Isabella McTurk after Isabella&#x02019;s marriage to William Dinwoodie. To give context to JBW &#x0002F; JWC&#x02019;s friendship with Isabella and to the closeness of Isabella to the extended Welsh family, we include the two Grace Welsh to Isabella Dinwoodie letters that are in the same folder of material (NLS Acc. 12039). They give useful indications of Mrs. Welsh&#x02019;s letter writing style, undoubtedly similar to the way she would have written to JWC, most of those letters having not survived. Unusually we are including the addressee&#x02019;s name in our headnotes to Grace Welsh&#x02019;s letters to Isabella to provide further evidence that Dinwoodie was the preferred family spelling.</p>

            <p>I received your letter this morning which I looked upon as a [miracle?]. Who [How] any biped could have made its way here after such a day &#x00026; night. I thank you much for your speedy answer to my requests; with respect to the Lassie<note n="13" noteref="1054">Jessie McVeagh; see <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380219-GW-IMD-01"><corr>GW to IMD, <date when="1838-02-19">19 Feb. 1838</date></corr></ref>.</note> one, I am glad to find you neither required her yourself, or found any that did, as it would have proved the day after the Fair, where she wished to go&#x02014;where she went&#x02014;&#x00026; where she hired herself for &#x0201C;a note&#x0201D; to people of the <pb id="pg-46-210" n="46:210"/>name of Lorrimer<note n="14" noteref="1055">Lorrimers, previously of Keir, not identified further.</note> &#x02014;of black-something&#x02014;within five miles of Dumfries&#x02014;decent people they are said to be&#x02014;old and old-fashioned&#x02014;they once had a farm, in Keir.</p>
    <p>Tho&#x02019; they are not the kind of people I should have cared about&#x02014;or to speak more correctly, the sort of in-the-house, &#x00026; out-the-house work that she is engaged to <hi rend="italic">perform</hi>&#x02014;for I think the two together never fails in producing a compound of incongruities. Yet I believe it is the best place she could have had&#x02014;for a six months training to rise with the Lark, and to work for her food&#x02014;which will teach her the value of it. so let us hope the best for the poor Orphans sake&#x02014;nor let us lose sight of her&#x02014; I had a long letter from the Liverpool Jeanie&#x02014;she will send the fringe as soon as she can<note n="15" noteref="1056">Jeannie Welsh; see <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380219-GW-IMD-01">GW to IMD, <date when="1838-02-19">19 Feb. 1838</date></ref>.</note> but it may be some time before she gets it.
