<salute>My dear Jean,</salute>
<p>This is no suitable answer to your brave long Letter;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> yet I think of sending it, now when the Postage is so cheap, rather than none. You are a decisive despatching woman, and write a most solid effectual Letter, in spite of all obstacles. Poor Jane is in bed today with a headache, or she would have told you for herself how much gratified she was.&#x2014; In ten days more there will be <hi rend="italic">Penny</hi> Postage; we shall then be able to write one another a mere How-d&#x2019;ye-do, without apprehension of its being too dear. Whenever one likes, or has half a word to say, one may write! A most blessed result, due in good part to the <hi rend="italic">weakness</hi> of the present Whig Ministry: they found last year, when they were turned out, that the Tories meant to pass the Postage Bill; wherefore, unexpectedly getting in again, they passed it themselves.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380511-TC-HC-01">TC to HC [<date when="1838-05-11">11? May 1838</date>]</ref>, and <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390526-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1839-05-26">26 May 1839</date></ref>.</note></p>
<p>Precisely the day after your Letter came (I think), there arrived, for the first time this season, a Letter from my Mother.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> All is well there; our good Mother professedly &#x201C;better than when I saw her&#x201D;;&#x2014;nothing wrong except Jamie&#x2019;s little Boy who is still out of his due course somewhat. I had written to my Mother just the day before. I urged your want of Scotsbrig tidings, and said she was to write to you;&#x2014;which perhaps she has done? I think I will inclose her Letter to me, on this occasion! More for the whimsicality of the thing, that you should get news of Scotsbrig <hi rend="italic">by</hi> London, than for any weightier reason. We have a small machine that weighs Letters; if the half-ounce will admit, the thing shall go!</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Chartism</hi> is out last saturday;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1839-12-28">28 Dec.</date> A copy inscribed &#x201C;Jane W. Carlyle (her own). T.C. London <date when="1840-01-01">1<hi rend="italic">st</hi> Jan. 1840</date>,&#x201D; with ca. thirty notes and corrections in TC&#x2019;s hand, is at Yale, presumably item 22 in Sotheby&#x2019;s sale of <date when="1932-06-13">13 June 1932</date>.</note> the <hi rend="italic">Morning Chronicle</hi> Newspaper had hold of it yesterday for some purpose of its own;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Morning Chronicle</hi>, 2d leader (<date when="1839-12-31">31 Dec.</date>), which saw TC as &#x201C;no friend to the present Ministry, or to either the Whig or the Radical section of the Liberal party&#x201D; defended the government, pointing out how determinedly hostile the Tories were to TC&#x2019;s advocacy of national education. It referred to a recent article in the <hi rend="italic">Quarterly Review</hi> that was about the &#x201C;Tory anathema against teaching the people to read unless under clerical superintendence&#x201D; (probably William Sewell&#x2019;s review of Gladstone&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">The State in its Relations with the Church</hi> 65 [<date when="1839-12-00">Dec. 1839</date>]: 97&#x2013;153). It also noted that TC&#x2019;s advocacy of emigration agreed with the practical measures of the Whig ministry, but insisted it would be better to try the effect of first abolishing the Corn Laws: &#x201C;a fair trial of the immigration of food ought to precede any great attempt at the emigration of industry.&#x201D;</note> I was rather <pb id="pg-12-4" n="12:4"/>glad they accounted me a kind of <hi rend="italic">Tory</hi>,&#x2014;Heaven send the Tory Party abundance of <hi rend="italic">such</hi> Tories, now and in time coming! Two copies of the little Book went off to Scotsbrig by the Edinburgh Steamer a day ago; one for my Mother herself; another for general use: so soon as Jamie and Alick had read it, they were to think of Dumfries. It is but a two-hours work, the getting thro&#x2019; it.&#x2014; I suppose your James got his Cobbett&#x2019;s Grammar? Is he making progress in it.</p>
<p>Thanks for the Pipes. I hope they will be here before long. My tobacco will be out next! No supplying of <hi rend="italic">thy</hi> wants!&#x2014; The Pipes I have at present have no &#x201C;royal arms&#x201D; on them; mere simple rib-work instead; they are extremely welcome to drop the royal arms.</p>
<p>Jane wrote to her Mother about your poor little unfortunate of a <foreign>Lassie</foreign>, to see whether <hi rend="italic">she</hi> could do anything for her.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-11/lt-18391230-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1839-12-30">30 Dec. 1839</date></ref>.</note> It is a most melancholy history, as was ever heard. Ah me! there are sore struggles in this world for many;&#x2014;but they soon all <hi rend="italic">end</hi>, and then the question is not how <hi rend="italic">sore</hi> they were!</p>
<p>This morning our Doctor has the offer of a new situation! He is out this moment to go and look after it farther. &#xa3;500 a year for being permanent Physician to some infirm sort of hypochondriacal young gentleman of great wealth, seemingly in the North of Ireland.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Ogilby (called Ogilvie by TC). John was to stay with him at Pellipar House, nr. Dungiven, Co. Londonderry, which belonged to a branch of the Ogilby family (of Scottish origin, originally Ogilvy). It currently belonged to the child James Ogilby, who had inherited it in <date when="1838-00-00">1838</date>. This connection with Pellipar indicates that William Ogilby was certainly a relative and possibly the child&#x2019;s uncle, an untraced son of Robert Ogilby and Joice Scott, and brother of Alexander (d. <date when="1838-00-00">1838</date>) and James (<date when="1812-00-00">1812</date>&#x2013;<date when="1885-00-00">85</date>), who later owned Pellipar.

<salute>My dear Sterling,</salute>
<p>It is but three or four days since I became fully aware that this Madeira business was to be more than a theory; that it was actually to take effect, and carry you away across the seas from me again! I grieve heartily at this result. It seemed to me the days were growing long, the spring and summer coming; that Sterling would run over hither, and I over thither; that we should gallop together, and argue together; that we should &#x26;c &#x26;c. Alas, my dear fellow, we cannot make head against these things; Boreas and the climate of England are stronger than we! However, Calvert<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380825-JWC-JOST-01">JWC to <sic>JS</sic><corr>JOST</corr>, [<date when="1838-08-25">25 Aug. 1838</date>]</ref>.</note> tells me he has no reason to think your health in any fundamental danger; he expects to bring you back triumphant in three months: and <hi rend="italic">then!</hi> It seems to me you must come to Knightsbridge; you must get <hi rend="italic">a horse;</hi> I shall have a horse; there will be such a series of equestrian and palaestric exercises gone thro&#x2019; as the English summer has seldom witnessed! Ask Calvert if galloping on horseback is not the method of getting to be <hi rend="italic">at rest</hi>&#x2014;for a character like you! I will cheer myself with these dreams; knowing well enough that much which is possible cannot be, any more than if it were impossible; knowing it on all sides <hi rend="italic">too</hi> well. We will hope nevertheless; my wishes and prayers shall go with you over the waste sea-flood; nothing can prevent <hi rend="italic">them</hi> from going at any rate.</p>
<p>Your Volume of Poems<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> (London, <date when="1839-00-00">1839</date>).</note> was duly delivered here the other day; along with the copy for Emerson, which latter I straightway despatched by Covent Garden Kennet the Bookseller. Your Letter, which was also despatched long months ago, has had no answer yet?<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-11/lt-18391125-TC-JOST-01">TC to <sic>JS</sic><corr>JOST</corr>, <date when="1839-11-25">25 Nov. 1839</date></ref>. In his letter of <date when="1840-04-21">21 April</date>, Emerson wrote: &#x201C;Your letter [of <date when="1840-01-06">6 Jan.</date>] announces Wilhelm Meister, Sterlings Poems, &#x26; Chartism. &#x2026; But Kennett is no Mercury. Wilhelm &#x26; Sterling have not yet made their appearance. &#x2026; Little &#x26; Brown now correspond with Longman, not with Kennett. &#x2026; I am sad to hear that Sterling sails again for his health. I am ungrateful not to have written to him as his letter was very welcome to me&#x201D; (Slater, <hi rend="italic">CEC</hi> 266&#x2013;68).</note> I too <pb id="pg-12-6" n="12:6"/>have heard nothing from E. these four months; Miss Martineau wrote some time ago that he was &#x201C;fallen into a very strange state in regard to External Nature&#x201D;; taking it upon him, as I understood, to deny that poor old External Nature existed at all, &#x201C;otherwise than relatively&#x201D;;&#x2014;a most questionable state in these times in those latitudes! Mylnes is about reviewing him, I understand, in the next <hi rend="italic">London &#x26; Westminster;</hi> we shall see what comes of that.</p>
<p>As to our own Volume, which my Wife vehemently claims as <hi rend="italic">hers,</hi> I find that the Titlepage without any &#x201C;Rev<hi rend="italic">d</hi>&#x201D; upon it is much to my mind; the pieces I think are all known to me before; and detestable as all rhyme or most rhyme is to me, I mean to read several of them a second time. You know my notions about <hi rend="italic">singing</hi> of thought, how heterodox, one-sided, contracted-emphatic &#x26;c &#x26;c they are; and yet on the whole they stand rigid only as practical precepts for my own self, not rigid at all on <hi rend="italic">thy</hi>self or on his self. I fancy there are many men who will like emotions of that sort set forth in a vehicle of that sort; so accordingly let them be set forth. Surely if all the Volumes of British Literature printed in <date when="1839-00-00">1839</date> were ranked in a long row, as long as Piccadilly, and ordered peremptorily to give account of themselves, Why they existed? Why they should not instantly be made into bandboxes?&#x2014;there are few or none of them that could tell a better story for themselves than this same Volume by Moxon.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edward Moxon (<date when="1801-00-00">1801</date>&#x2013;<date when="1858-00-00">58</date>), 44 Dover St., pbd.

Is not this fair play on my part? Go on and prosper, till you either get into free Infinitude, or find yourself, as Goethe says, <foreign><hi rend="italic">zur&#xfc;ckgeprallt</hi></foreign> [rebounding back]! Either way it will be for real and indispensable profit to you.</p>
<p>As for myself my flight at present is very low; or rather I should say my <hi rend="italic">roost</hi>, for I do not try flying at all. <hi rend="italic">To be let alone</hi> is the utmost ambition of my soul in these times and circumstances. The speech of men for most part is a jargon and platitude to me; with which why should I quarrel? The far easier way were to keep well out of the road of it, which by the blessing of Heaven one can in a tolerable measure <pb id="pg-12-7" n="12:7"/>do. I still mourn for the want of Books; wish I had <hi rend="italic">you</hi> here to institute a Library for me. I read Eichhorn&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Alte Testament;</hi><note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >J. G. Eichhorn (see <ref target="volume-05/lt-18291221-TC-DA-01"><sic>5:45</sic><corr>TC to DA, <date when="1829-12-21">21 Dec. 1829</date></corr></ref>), <hi rend="italic">Einleitung in das Alte Testament</hi>, 3 vols. (Leipzig, <date when="1787-00-00">1787</date>).</note> endeavour to glean an image of some <hi rend="italic">thing</hi> here and there from that goodly heap of shadows of things. Neal&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Puritans</hi> I have from Maurice;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Daniel Neal (<date when="1678-00-00">1678</date>&#x2013;<date when="1743-00-00">1743</date>), <hi rend="italic">History of the Puritans</hi>, 4 vols. (London, <date when="1732-00-00">1732</date>&#x2013;<date when="1738-00-00">38</date>). F. D. Maurice wrote of it: &#x201C;My father being a Dissenter, I took great interest in a heavy and undoubtedly a somewhat narrow book, &#x2018;Neal&#x2019;s History of the Puritans.&#x2019; I owe much &#x2026; even of the form which my belief took when I became an Episcopalian&#x201D; (F. Maurice, <hi rend="italic">Life of F. D. Maurice</hi> 1:19).</note> a very considerably stupider book: <foreign><hi rend="italic">ach Gott</hi></foreign>, it is a sin for men to write stupid books, and afflict their fellow creatures with half-centuries after they are dead! Really this is true: a man ought to separate chaff from wheat, were it with never such pain to himself, that so thousands of other persons may not have the pain,&#x2014;may not at last find it too hard a pain, and fling <hi rend="italic">the whole concern</hi> into the chaff-heap!</p>
<p>There was a copy of my pamphlet on <hi rend="italic">Chartism</hi> left for you; in patient expectation of the Sterlingian censure. Your Father will take it, I suppose. Fox and the Radicals give tongue, vituperative-astonished;<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably in the <hi rend="italic">Morning Chronicle</hi> to which W. J. Fox contributed four leaders a week, <date when="1838-00-00">1838</date>&#x2013;<date when="1840-00-00">40</date>. As well as its leader on <hi rend="italic">Chartism</hi>, <date when="1839-12-31">31 Dec. 1839</date> (see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400101-TC-JCA-01">TC to JCA, <date when="1840-01-01">1 Jan.</date></ref>), the <hi rend="italic">Chronicle</hi> also criticized <hi rend="italic">Chartism</hi> in its first leader, <date when="1840-01-03">3 Jan.</date> It referred to TC&#x2019;s &#x201C;eloquent admonitions&#x201D; on the condition of the working people but continued: &#x201C;as a philosophy of Chartism, a delineation of the condition &#x2026; of the masses, an estimate of the efforts made in their behalf, or a proposal of remedial measures, the defects of the work are not less remarkable than its tone of pretension.&#x201D; The <hi rend="italic">Chronicle</hi>, which was for repeal of the Corn Laws and further parliamentary reform but against the Chartists, saw the &#x201C;position of Toryism&#x201D; as &#x201C;the great block to all working-class relief and to all national improvement. &#x2026; If the philosopher wants to serve his country let him analyse this monster&#x2019;s power, and do battle with it.&#x201D;</note> yesterday I read on some Newspaper Placard in big letters &#x201C;Carlyle&#x2019;s Cant on Chartism&#x201D;; my Brother was for stepping in to buy the Newspaper, but I decisively said NO. I have had too much bother with the miserable rag of a thing already; correcting proofs, higgling and arranging. It is as bad as you like but it utters in some way a thing that has been burning in the stomach of me these ten years, parts of it these twenty years: behold it is <hi rend="italic">out;</hi> what more have <hi rend="italic">I</hi> to do with it? To sweep it altogether out of my memory too: <foreign><hi rend="italic">schlag&#x2019; es mir aus dem Sinne</hi></foreign> [beat it out of my senses]! The Devil and the World have now to play their part or no-part with it; mine is played.</p>
<p>At this point the Postman with fateful double-knock delivers your Letter from Clifton!<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> Thousand thanks my kind friend; I did not expect you to take such trouble with me, and meant to say you need not in <pb id="pg-12-8" n="12:8"/>the pressure of so many other troubles. Your illness seems to have been far more grievous than I had interpreted from so many confused accounts. Get well, and come back with Calvert: this is what you will and shall do in spite of all hypochondria. &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Verfehltes Leben</hi></foreign> [Unsuccessful Life]&#x201D;! Foolish youth; your Life is not <foreign><hi rend="italic">verfehlt</hi></foreign>, not a bit of it!

There is nothing at all lost yet; and there is the whole world still to win. I speak this advisedly. If I could persuade the man to sit quiet and silent (<hi rend="italic">silent</hi>, I say, you&#x2014;!) for a twelvemonth or so, and do nothing at all but let the aeriform become liquid and solid, I would back him against the British Empire! That too will come; I never doubt it.</p>
<p>And so go in good hope, and return to us well and joyful. The clay is a dolorous prison many ways to all of us; ah me! But you do learn what the limits of it are; and <hi rend="italic">can</hi> then walk about a little without breaking your head on the walls. My Brother sends his wishes with you: he is still here; but on terms for a new place somewhat like his old one. My Wife salutes you as a Sister taking leave.

<salute>My dear Emerson,</salute>
<p>It is you, I surely think, that are in my debt now; nevertheless I must fling you another word: may it cross one from you coming hither&#x2014;as near the <hi rend="italic">Lizard Point</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Southwest Cornwall, southernmost promontory of England.</note> as it likes!</p>
<p>Some four sheets making a Pamphlet called <hi rend="italic">Chartism</hi> addressed to you at Concord are, I suppose, snorting along thro&#x2019; the waters this <pb id="pg-12-9" n="12:9"/>morning, part of the Cargo of the <hi rend="italic">British Queen</hi>.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">British Queen</hi>, of the British &#x26; American Steam Navigation Co., had sailed for New York from London, <date when="1839-12-30">30 Dec.</date></note> At least I gave them to Mr Brown (your unseen friend) about ten days ago, who promised to dispose of them; the <hi rend="italic">British Queen</hi>, he said, was the earliest chance. The Pamphlet itself (or rather Booklet, for Fraser has gilt it &#x26;c, and asks five shillings for it as a Book) is out since then; radicals and others yelping considerably in a discordant manner about it: I have nothing other to say to <hi rend="italic">you</hi> about it than what I said last time, That the sheets were <hi rend="italic">yours</hi> to do with as you saw good,&#x2014;to burn if you reckoned that fittest. It is not entirely a Political Pamphlet; nay there are one or two things in it which my American Friends specially may like: but the interests discussed are altogether English, and cannot be considered as likely to concern <hi rend="italic">New</hi>-Englishmen very much. However, it will probably be itself in your hand, before this sheet, and you will have determined what is fit.</p>
<p>A copy of <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister</hi>, two copies, one for Stearns Wheeler, are probably in some of the &#x201C;Line Ships&#x201D; at this time too: good voyage to them! The F. Revolutions were all shipped, insured &#x26;c; they have I will suppose, arrived safe, as we shall hear by and by. What freightages, landings and embarkments! For only two days ago I sent you off, thro&#x2019; Kennett, another Book: John Sterling&#x2019;s Poems, which he has collected into a Volume. Poor John has overworked himself again, or the climate without fault on his side has proved too hard for him: he sails for Madeira again next week! His Doctors tell me there is no intrinsic danger; but they judge the measure safe as one of precaution. It is very mortifying: he had nestled himself down at Clifton, thinking he might now hope to continue there; and lo he has to fly again.&#x2014; Did you get his Letter? The address to him now will be, for three months to come, &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Edward</hi> Sterling Esq<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, South Place, Knightsbridge, London,&#x201D; his Father&#x2019;s designation.</p>
<p>Farther I must not omit to say that Richard Monckton Mylnes purposes, thro&#x2019; the strength of Heaven, to <hi rend="italic">review</hi> you. In the next N<hi rend="italic">o</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">London and Westminster</hi> the courageous youth will do this feat, if they let him. Nay <hi rend="italic">he</hi> has already done it, the Paper being actually written: he employed me last week in negociating with the Editors about it; and their answer was, &#x201C;Send us the Paper, it promises very well.&#x201D; We shall see whether it comes out or not; keeping silence till then. Mylnes is a <hi rend="italic">Tory</hi> Member of Parliament; think of that! For the rest, he describes his religion in these terms, &#x201C;I <hi rend="italic">profess</hi> to be a <hi rend="italic">Crypto</hi>-Catholic.&#x201D; Conceive the man! A most bland-smiling, semi-quizzical, affectionate, highbred, Italianized little man of 5 feet, who has long olive-blond <pb id="pg-12-10" n="12:10"/>hair, a dimple next to <supplied>[no]</supplied> chin, and flings his arm round your neck when he addresses you <supplied>[in pub]</supplied>lic society! Let us hear now what <hi rend="italic">he</hi> will say of the American <foreign><hi rend="italic">Vates</hi></foreign> [Prophet].</p>
<p>Fraser the Bookseller was here few minutes ago about those everlasting <hi rend="italic">Miscellanies,</hi> which he has hardly got to Press yet; which he pleads amazingly to have made into <hi rend="italic">six</hi> volumes by adding <hi rend="italic">Chartism</hi> and things in <hi rend="italic">German Romance</hi>. I have got all the Book read over; punctuation corrected &#x26;c &#x26;c, and mean to wash <hi rend="italic">my</hi> hands of it as far as possible henceforth. I am doing little or nothing. When comes the Emerson <hi rend="italic">Book?</hi> At all events, the Emerson Letter!&#x2014; <closer><salute>Good be ever with you, my friend!&#x2014; Your affectionate,</salute></closer></p>

His liberal views on social questions, including popular education and emigration, were close to those expressed in <hi rend="italic">Chartism</hi>.

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Accept many thanks for the kind Letter you have written me. It is very gratifying to learn that a man like you has got some good of that wild savage Book of mine;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Arnold had written that &#x201C;ever since I read your History of the French Revolution I have longed to become acquainted with you. &#x2026; The wisdom of the Book, as well as its singular Eloquence &#x26; Poetry, was such a Treasure to me as I have rarely met with.&#x201D;</note> no less is it gratifying and unexpected that you sympathize so completely in the essential all-pervading Idea set forth there, <hi rend="italic">the fatally false condition of the Lower Classes;</hi> the <hi rend="italic">soul,</hi> as I may call it, of which that Book on the French Revolution, and the <pb id="pg-12-11" n="12:11"/>enormous French Revolution itself, was the embodyment! I will take it as an omen that many thinking heads in England are full of anxious meditation on this matter; as indeed it seems well worthy of <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the thought of all good men in these days. And yet, as you say, how few seem to be aware of the existence of such a thing! To me, when I came hither, it was matter of dumb astonishment to hear the notions of Lawgivers, Radical Members and such like on the matter; I have long ceased to speak of it at all in such circles: perhaps the public events of last year and the present may have spoken in a dialect more intelligible there.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Especially in the Chartist disturbances. On <date when="1840-01-08">8 Jan.</date>, John Frost was found guilty of high treason and was to be sentenced to death (then reprieved) as a result of the Newport rising, <date when="1839-11-00">Nov. 1839</date>.</note> To me it seems and has long seemed clear, that unless these people, and the upper classes generally, awaken to quite a <hi rend="italic">new</hi> sense of their duties, position and necessities in our system of society, there are results at no great distance from us such as very few of our public men have the smallest anticipation of, such as all men public and private might well sorrow to anticipate.</p>
<p>I have set down in that Pamphlet on <hi rend="italic">Chartism</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Arnold had written: &#x201C;I see by the Newspapers that you are writing on Chartism. &#x2026; I shall be curious to know whether you have any definite Notions as to the Means of relieving the fearful Evils of our social Condition, or whether you like myself are overwhelmed by the Magnitude of the Mischief.&#x201D;</note> some thoughts of mine, which have lain oppressive in my heart these ten, some of them these twenty years; I applied more than once in past times to Editors of Reviews for leave to publish them in that way: but to no purpose; the Editors even of <hi rend="italic">radical</hi> Reviews believe that the &#x201C;condition of the Working Classes is daily and yearly <hi rend="italic">improving&#x201D;;</hi>&#x2014;to which I used to answer, &#x201C;Then <hi rend="italic">what</hi>, in Heaven&#x2019;s name, are <hi rend="italic">you?&#x201D;</hi><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380100-TC-JSM-01">TC to JSM, [<date when="1838-01-00">late Jan.</date>&#x2013;<date when="1838-03-00">early March 1838</date>]</ref>.</note> At length, having now a kind of means to publish independent of Editors, I send forth the thing on its own footing,&#x2014;primarily, to relieve <hi rend="italic">myself</hi> of it, (which is one&#x2019;s only rule); and am now right glad that <hi rend="italic">I</hi> have done with it, and that now the world has to do,&#x2014;or not to do. I know not what you will say to the little Essay when you see it; I suppose there are several things in it you will heartily agree with: at all events, I will recommend it to you as an authentic shadow, so far as it goes, of my true sentiments on this subject; the completest utterance I could conveniently give at present of several things not very easy to utter.</p>
<p>For the rest I confess my hopes of the Aristocracy and Church are not high. I incline to fear that the Providence which governs this world will have appointed to teach them too, as is the usual case, only with <hi rend="italic">stripes</hi>. Taught they will infallibly be, as I calculate; if not by <pb id="pg-12-12" n="12:12"/>milder and nobler ways, then even by stripes,&#x2014;stripes and ever new stripes till they <hi rend="italic">have learned</hi>, or else till they have been abolished and cast out as unteachable. Such <hi rend="italic">striping</hi> is a frightful process,&#x2014;for them and for us! Surely it behoves every man, who so views it, to do what is in him for forwarding that lesson with the fewest possible stripes!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Luke 12:47&#x2013;48.</note></p>
<p>In this point of view, one would say it was extremely natural for the scattered individuals entertaining such thoughts, to unite themselves, and endeavour with mutual aid to make their thought an action. And yet do not most &#x201C;Societies,&#x201D; such is our spiritual impotency in this time, turn out very soon to be rather empty things; swollen mostly with cant, vanity and wind,&#x2014;the main reality in them the <hi rend="italic">dinners</hi> they eat! Alas, it is even so;&#x2014;and yet not necessarily so, not by any means. Man <hi rend="italic">can</hi> join with man for a true object; and &#x201C;ten men united can do what a thousand singly would fail in&#x201D;:<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Proverbial.</note> it needs only that the men be true and the object be true. As for me, with little money, little health, with in fact no resources whatever except what lie within myself, all I can say is, If such a Society should ever come to existence it would be one of the highest duties and a really precious pleasure for me to do in it whatsoever my best ability were equal to. I invite you therefore not to drop your idea; but to canvass it farther in your own thoughts, and with others; and see whether it be not possible after all.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Arnold had written: &#x201C;I have no Sort of Desire to push my Proposal about a Society, and would gladly be guided by wiser Men as to what is best to be done.&#x201D;</note></p>
<p>Many thanks for your kind invitation to Rugby. I used to know Warwickshire a little; to see you and what you preside over would be in all ways interesting: neither will I fling away the hope of making it out one day or other.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC went on <date when="1842-05-06">6 May 1842</date>; he knew Warwickshire from his visit in <date when="1824-00-00">1824</date> (<hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> 261&#x2013;63).</note> Unhappily I am one of the worst of Travellers;&#x2014;ought in short, as I many times think to have been made like a <hi rend="italic">snail,</hi> with my house and establishment on my <hi rend="italic">back</hi>. It is not with my will, but greatly against it, that I have led from of old one of the loneliest lives.</p>
<p>Probably you come up to Town in <date when="1840-05-00">May</date>, as all the world does? If so, pray find out Chelsea, and my dwellingplace here: you shall be a welcome sight to me, then or at any time.</p>

<p>I am sorry that I cannot throw any light whatever on your Paper about <hi rend="italic">Chartism</hi>.

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>As my <hi rend="italic">first</hi> penny-letter, and a specimen of what penny-letters may henceforth be, I fling off three words to you before the week be done;&#x2014;in the greatest haste imaginable.</p>
<p>We are all stirring about, Jane very tolerably strong; Jack just gone out on his rambles. He expects in 7 or 8 days some news from Londonderry about his proposed engagement there. He means either to reject it altogether, or to have a trial of it for a month before bargaining permanently. I think it was wise to stipulate so; I think they <hi rend="italic">will</hi> likely let him try,&#x2014;and also that it may prove a situation very fit for him. You shall hear.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Chartism</hi> I conclude is come into your hands before now. <hi rend="italic">Lay out a penny</hi> some of you, and let me know!&#x2014; It goes along at a brisk rate <pb id="pg-12-14" n="12:14"/>here; greatly to Fraser&#x2019;s satisfaction. I send a review of it today, the reasonablest I have yet met with, round by Jean and Dumfries indicating that they are to forward it to you. All is right on that side;&#x2014;but I expect abusive reviews too by and by; which also will do <hi rend="italic">good</hi> in the selling way.&#x2014; We have got the <hi rend="italic">first sheet</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">Miscellanies</hi> put into type; a great feat, like the first stone of a house actually laid down, and the workers all gathered round it. I must not complain of the <foreign><hi rend="italic">fash</hi></foreign> [trouble] it gives me; but it is very <foreign><hi rend="italic">fashious</hi></foreign> when one wants to be doing something better.</p>
<p>Your right good Letter came just the day after mine went.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> Thanks, many thanks, dear Mother! Thanks to you first; then also to Jamie whom I mean to write perhaps my next pennyworth to.&#x2014; Keep the Spencer on; put a bottle of hot water at your feet! It is venomously cold here,&#x2014;so damp withal.</p>
<p>I have been obliged to swallow Castor today, having caught a whiff of <hi rend="italic">snifterings</hi> yesterday morning. The sun is bright; I must out and walk before mist sink, and cold <hi rend="italic">rime</hi> envelope all things. We keep a blazing fire, in spite of dear coals. Do you likewise. Tell Isabella to wrap little Tom well</p>

<salute>Dear Emerson,</salute>
<p>Your Letter of the <date when="1839-12-12">12<hi rend="italic">th</hi> December</date>,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Slater, <hi rend="italic">CEC</hi> 253&#x2013;55.</note> greatly to my satisfaction, has arrived; the struggling Steamship in spite of all hurricanes has brought it safe across the waters to me. I find it good to write you a word in return straightway; tho&#x2019; I think there are already two or perhaps even three messages of mine to you flying about unacknowledged somewhere under the Moon; nay the last of them perhaps may go by the same packet as this,&#x2014;having been forwarded, as this will be, to <hi rend="italic">Liverpool</hi>, after the <hi rend="italic">British Queen</hi> sailed from London.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400106-TC-RWE-01">TC to RWE, <date when="1840-01-06">6 Jan.</date></ref></note></p>
<p>Your account of the <hi rend="italic">F. Revolution</hi> packages, and prognosis of what Little and Brown will do with them is altogether as it should be. I apprised Fraser instantly of <hi rend="italic">his</hi> invoice-less Books &#x26;c; he answers that order has been taken in that long since, &#x201C;instructions&#x201D; sent, and I conclude, arrangements for <hi rend="italic">bills</hi> least of all forgotten. I mentioned what share of the duty was his; and that your men meant to draw on him for it.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson had written: &#x201C;The duties at the New York Custom House on these and a quantity of other books sent by Fraser, amounted to $400.36 whereof, I understand, the Fr. Rev. pays for its share $243.00.&#x201D; Brown also wanted from Fraser &#x201C;an invoice of the <hi rend="italic">other books</hi> sent, &#x26; instructions&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">CEC</hi> 253&#x2013;54).</note> That is all right.&#x2014; As to the <hi rend="italic">F. Revolution</hi> I agree with your Booksellers altogether about it; the American Edition actually pleases myself better for looking at; nor do I know that this new English one has much superiority for use: it is despicably printed, I fear, so far as false spellings, and other slovenlinesses can go: Fraser &#x201C;finds the people like it&#x201D;; <foreign><hi rend="italic">credat Judaeus</hi></foreign> [let the Jew believe it];<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Horace, <hi rend="italic">Satires</hi> 1.5.100. The despised printer of the 2d edn. of <hi rend="italic">The French Revolution</hi> was James Moyes, Castle St., Leicester Sq., who had also printed vols. 1 and 2 of the 1st edn.</note>&#x2014;as for me, I have told him I will <hi rend="italic">not print any more</hi> with that man but with some other man. Curious enough: the price Little &#x26; B. have fixed upon was the price I remember guessing at beforehand, and the result they propose to realize for me corresponds closely with my prophecy too.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson had said: &#x201C;I confided the book very much to the conscience &#x26; discretion of Little &#x26; Brown. &#x2026;&#x201D; It was to sell for $3.75 a copy, with about &#x201C;$1.10 per copy, profit&#x201D; for TC &#x201C;and no more&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">CEC</hi> 253).</note> Thanks, a thousand thanks for all the trouble you never grudge to take. We shall get ourselves handsomely out of this export and import speculation; <pb id="pg-12-16" n="12:16"/>and know, taught at a rather <hi rend="italic">cheap rate</hi>, not to embark in the like again.</p>
<p>There went off a <hi rend="italic">W. Meister</hi> for you, and a Letter to announce it, several weeks ago; that was message first. Your travelling neighbour Brown took charge of a Pamphlet named <hi rend="italic">Chartism</hi>, to be put into the British Queen&#x2019;s Letter-bag (where I hope, and doubt not, he did put it, tho&#x2019; I have seen nothing of him since); that and a letter in reference to it was message second. Thirdly I sent off a volume of Poems by Sterling, likewise announced in that Letter. And now this that I actually write is the fourth (it turns out to be) and last of all the messages. Let us take arithmetic along with us in all things.&#x2014; Of <hi rend="italic">Chartism</hi> I have nothing farther to say except that Fraser is striking off another 1000 copies to be called 2<hi rend="italic">nd</hi> edition; and that the people accuse me not of being an incendiary and speculative <foreign>sansculotte</foreign> threatening to become practical, but of being a Tory.&#x2014;thank Heaven. The <hi rend="italic">Miscellanies</hi> are at press, at <hi rend="italic">two</hi> presses;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Vols. 1 and 2 were printed by J. L. Cox &#x26; Sons, 75 Great Queen St., Lincoln&#x2019;s Inn Fields, and vols. 3, 4, and 5 by Robson, Levey, &#x26; Franklyn.</note> to be out, as Hope asseverates, in <date when="1840-03-00">March</date>: five volumes, without <hi rend="italic">Chartism;</hi> with Hoffmann and Tieck from German Romance, stuck in somewhere as Appendix; with some other trifles stuck in elsewhere, chiefly as Appendix, and no essential change from the Boston edition. Fraser, &#x201C;overwhelmed with business,&#x201D; does not yet send me his net-result of those 250 Copies sold off some time ago; so soon as he does, you shall hear of it for your satisfaction.&#x2014; As to <hi rend="italic">German Romance</hi>, tell any friends that it has been out of print these ten years; procurable, of late not without difficulty, only in the Old-Bookshops. The comfort is that the <hi rend="italic">best</hi> part of it stands in the new <hi rend="italic">W. Meister:</hi> Fraser &#x26; I had some thought of adding <hi rend="italic">Tieck</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Richter&#x2019;s</hi> parts, had they suited for a volume; the rest <hi rend="italic">may</hi> without detriment to anybody perish.</p>
<p>Such press-correctings and arrangings waste my time here, not in <supplied>[the]</supplied> agreeablest way. I begin, tho&#x2019; in as sulky a state of health as ever, to loo<supplied>[k]</supplied> again towards some new kind of work. I have often thought of Cromwell and Puritans; but do not see how the subject can be presented <hi rend="italic">still alive</hi>. A subject dead is not worth presenting. Meanwhile I read rubbish of Books; Eichhorn, Grimm<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jakob Grimm (<date when="1785-00-00">1785</date>&#x2013;<date when="1863-00-00">1863</date>) and Wilhelm Grimm (<date when="1786-00-00">1786</date>&#x2013;<date when="1859-00-00">1859</date>), philologists and folklorists; which of their works is not identified.</note> &#x26;c; very considerable rubbish, one grain in the cartload worth pocketing It is pity I have no appetite for lecturing! Many applications have been made to me here;&#x2014;none more touching to me than one, the day before yesterday, by a fine innocent-looking Scotch lad, in the name of himself and certain <pb id="pg-12-17" n="12:17"/>other Booksellers&#x2019; shopmen eastward in the City! I cannot get them out of my head. Poor fellows! they have nobody to say an honest word to them, in this articulate-speaking world, and they apply to <hi rend="italic">me</hi>.&#x2014; For you, good friend, I account you luckier; I do verily: lecture there what innumerable things you have got to say on &#x201C;The Present Age&#x201D;;&#x2014;yet withal do not forget to <hi rend="italic">write</hi> either, for that is the lasting plan after all. I have a curious Note sent me for inspection the other day; it is addressed to a Scotch Mr Erskine (famed among the saints here) by a Madame Necker, Madame de Sta&#xEB;l&#x2019;s kinswoman, to whom he the said Mr E. had lent your first Pamphlet at Geneva.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson&#x2019;s &#x201C;first pamphlet&#x201D; was presumably the <hi rend="italic">Phi Beta Kappa Oration;</hi> see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18371208-TC-RWE-01"><sic>9:361</sic><corr>TC to RWE, <date when="1837-12-08">8 Dec. 1837</date></corr></ref>.

<p>I may as well send you my salutations on a separate bit of paper, as I am writing to Jamie, and have filled his.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note></p>

Rev</hi>n had arrived safe there, and were expected to be all sold off in some six months.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >From Emerson, <date when="1839-12-12">12 Dec. 1839</date> (Slater, <hi rend="italic">CEC</hi> 253&#x2013;55).</note> The <hi rend="italic">duties</hi> they charge on books from abroad are ruinous both here and in America: nevertheless I am to get my own money back out of that speculation, and about &#xa3;100 to boot, they say; which is as much as I ever expected from it.&#x2014; I have been writing to Emerson today; that is the reason why I have &#x201C;the pen in my hand&#x201D;;&#x2014;and a very bad pen it is!</p>
<p>Fraser has not given me his account yet, being &#x201C;so busy.&#x201D; I expect that after all fritterings and raspings, there will be a very tolerable story to tell about these <hi rend="italic">Miscellanies</hi> he has sold for me here.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, an innocent blithe wise-looking Scotch lad called upon me with a humble petition, which in his <foreign>blateness</foreign> [shyness] he could hardly get uttered, That I would come eastward into &#x201C;the City&#x201D; (the <hi rend="italic">trading</hi> part of London), and lecture on any or on all sorts of things to certain young Booksellers&#x2019; shopmen and others of the like, who were very anxious about it! The more I think of these poor fellows, I am the more struck with such a request. They have nobody to <hi rend="italic">preach</hi> a rational syllable to them on any subject whatever; and they want to hear rational words! I have half a mind sometimes to break out tumultuously, and begin lecturing like a lion over the whole world. But it is better, I do <supplied>[believe]</supplied>, to stay at home quietly and <hi rend="italic">write</hi>. We shall see into both sides of it by and by.&#x2014; Farewell today, dear Mother; you shall soon hear from me again. Jane&#x2019;s Newyears&#x2019; wishes, and all manner of wishes! Tell us of Hanning and Jenny, of Mary, Jean and them all.&#x2014;<closer><salute>Ever your affectionate&#x2014;</salute></closer><name>T. Carlyle.</name></p>

<p>On looking at your Note<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> a second time the other day, I found that I had committed a great mistake: leaving Madame&#x2019;s little Letter with Darwin in the <hi rend="italic">open</hi> state!

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>It is perhaps worth while to write you one line today, to say that nothing has yet been decided about Jack and his Irish situation.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >His appointment as William Ogilby&#x2019;s doctor. They left for Ireland, <date when="1840-02-01">1 Feb.</date> In his Journal, <date when="1840-01-21">21 Jan.</date>, TC commented: &#x201C;John about bargaining to go to the neighbourhood of Londonderry. &#x2026; Gone today to see Hanwell Madhouse in company with his Grace of Buccleuch. Poor Jack, the placablest simplest-hearted of men, the best of brothers. Why cannot we be usefuller to one another.&#x201D;</note> He expected to have met his man this day, and finally settled that he was <hi rend="italic">to go for a month</hi> and try the business; &#xa3;50 for this month, if he turned out not to like it: but the man has not come forward, that is to say, has not sent any Letter, at the time expected; and so the matter still hangs. Or perhaps it is only our Chelsea Post which, with its delays, he has miscalculated? One way or other the thing must decide itself now in a day or two. The Patient, we already learn, is quite willing for the arrangement. I think it likeliest that Jack <hi rend="italic">will</hi> go, for a month at any rate. It is a capital salary &#xa3;500 a-year with your bed <pb id="pg-12-21" n="12:21"/>and board; if salary is one&#x2019;s object. Jack does not seem to care very much about it otherwise. We shall see soon now what becomes of it.</p>
<p>Mary sent us a Letter,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> it was to the Dr., the other day. She complains sore of the <foreign>reek</foreign> [smoke]; of the great loss they have had by buying of the crop. It is very grievous; but, as I say, what can one help it? There was no other way of getting into the Farm, but simply that way. It comes only once. &#x201C;At every town-end there is a <foreign><hi rend="italic">dub</hi></foreign> [puddle]; and at this town-end a <foreign>loch</foreign>&#x201D;!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Proverbial; see <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340408-TC-MCA-01"><sic>7:129</sic><corr>TC to MCA, <date when="1834-04-08">8 April 1834</date></corr></ref>.</note> I have written to Mary a word of encouragement to that effect. She tells me that Jamie of Scotsbrig was over, for the first time, very lately. I wish he would write to me, according to my invitation, what he saw there.</p>
<p>The two Printers are fairly begun upon me; they will keep me going for a couple of months at any rate. I send you a bit of a Proofsheet, that you may discern what work it is. They determine to make a finer book of five volumes than the American of four was. We shall see whether or not.</p>
<p>Considerable reviewing of <hi rend="italic">Chartism</hi> still goes on; but very <hi rend="italic">daft</hi> reviewing.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC wrote in his Journal: &#x201C;Miscellanies <hi rend="italic">revised;</hi> five volumes; gone to Press (<date when="1840-01-21">21 Jan<hi rend="italic">y</hi> 1840</date>). <hi rend="italic">Chartism</hi> out; getting itself criticised.&#x201D;</note> They approve generally (such of them as I see, but that is not one in the three), but regret very much that I am&#x2014;a Tory! Stranger Tory, in my opinion, has not been fallen in with in these latter generations.</p>
<p>I have some <hi rend="italic">new</hi> applications for Lecturing in the district of London they call &#x201C;the City,&#x201D; that is, the quarter where the Merchants and business people live. I suppose I shall be obliged to try it some day or other.&#x2014; A poor Paisley Weaver wrote to me last week a very curious Letter,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found. Froude, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi> 3:179, quotes from the &#x201C;ill-spelt missive&#x201D; as if he had seen it, saying that it thanked TC &#x201C;for having taught him that &#x2018;man does not live by demonstration, but by faith. The world had been to him for a long time a deserted temple. Carlyle&#x2019;s writings had restored the significance of things to him, and his voice had been as the voice of a beneficent spiritual father.&#x2019;&#x201D;</note> of thanks for my writings, which had been a great comfort to him! I sent the epistle away to Mr Erskine<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Erskine, who twice wrote to TC about Bowie. On <date when="1840-02-10">10 Feb.</date>, he was nr. Glasgow, and said that he meant to &#x201C;seek&#x201D; him &#x201C;out.&#x201D; &#x201C;It is a comfort to find any of these hard-wrought drudges discovering that there is another way of freeing and righting themselves than by following John Frost; aye, and discovering, notwithstanding the dinginess of their own special holes, that they are in a real divine temple, full of significance. Our weaver is in the high way of becoming a priest in the Temple, offering himself up a living sacrifice, as the tent-maker says, for he seems to regard knowledge in a practical way, desiring direction. &#x2026; I shall go to Paisley and enquire after our friend. I have often heard of you since I saw you; but it is a great pleasure to hear a word direct. I am very much obliged to you and Mrs. Carlyle for remembering me. I remember you both with much love and regard, and join in William&#x2019;s prayer for you&#x2014;that the God of peace may rest and abide with you and strengthen you in every good word and work.&#x201D; He went on to say that he had read <hi rend="italic">Chartism</hi> &#x201C;with much sympathy,&#x201D; and that &#x201C;no legislative acts &#x2026; can do us any good. I believe that each man must do his duty &#x2026; recognizing himself to be in a temple and called to be a priest in it. I have read your Miscellanies also, and could say something, like William Bowie, about them.&#x201D; On <date when="1840-04-07">7 April</date> Erskine wrote that he had twice called on Bowie. The first time, he saw his &#x201C;host and hostess. &#x2026; They spoke well and kindly of him, calling him a <hi rend="italic">quiet</hi> <foreign>lad</foreign> that was fond of books. They said that his mother was an excellent, sensible woman, and his grandfather and grandmother <hi rend="italic">just first-rate folk, capital folk out of Ayrshire</hi>.&#x201D; When he met Bowie, &#x201C;I found him, in truth, a very quiet <foreign>lad</foreign>, a good deal isolated, liked by the people that are close to him, but understood or sympathized with by few, if any. Your &#x2018;Miscellanies&#x2019; were lying on his table. &#x2026; After sitting with him a little while, I told him that I knew you, which gave him great pleasure, and drew from him the acknowledgment that he had written to you and had received an answer. He was very inquisitive to know everything about you that I could tell him, and seemed to have formed his own picture of you already from your writings, which he often quoted with great delight, and with a look of kindly humourousness, indicating that he entered into the meaning, such as you never see on any other than a Scotch face. I afterwards called on him at his workshop, poor fellow, and got him out to take a walk with me. I like him, and intend to see him from time to time&#x201D; (A. J. Symington, <hi rend="italic">Some Personal Reminiscences of Carlyle</hi> [Paisley and London, <date when="1886-00-00">1886</date>] 43&#x2013;48).<lb/><lb/>
Symington knew Bowie and introduced him to Jean Carlyle Aitken. He possessed several hundred of Bowie&#x2019;s letters, which &#x201C;were full of thought and tersely expressed.&#x201D; Bowie &#x201C;knew of Carlyle&#x201D; through Thomas Ballantyne, formerly also a Paisley weaver. Symington also notes that TC talked with him about Bowie, one afternoon in <date when="1863-05-00">May 1863</date>, and said: &#x201C;Poor fellow! He kept by himself through life and thought; when we and other idiots were babbling and joining the insane throng&#x2014;swelling the noise with words not always better than the silences. Peace to poor William!&#x201D; (Symington 42, 49).</note> who is in Scotland at present, or I would have spent a penny in enclosing it to you.</p>

<p><salute>My dear Sir&#x2014;</salute> Yesterday your little Book on the Statistics of the Corn-Laws came to hand.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">The Corn-Law Repealer&#x2019;s Handbook: a Complete Manual for the use of those who wish to make themselves familiar with the Statistics of the Corn Law Question</hi> (Bolton, <date when="1840-00-00">1840</date>); advertised, with strong recommendations from anti-Corn Law newspapers, in the <hi rend="italic">Bolton Free Press</hi>, <date when="1840-02-15">15 Feb.</date> Thomas Ballantyne also lectured against the Corn Laws the <date when="1839-06-00">previous June</date>, the following <date when="1840-02-00">Feb.</date>, and perhaps at other times.</note> I have read it with great approval; it contains <pb id="pg-12-23" n="12:23"/>much truth in small space; the more that will familiarize themselves with these facts, the better surely for themselves and for all of us. I have not often seen a greater quantity of knowledge presented in as compressed a shape, or tending so conclusively towards its aim. Statistics of this kind are <hi rend="italic">not</hi> &#x201C;baskets of gravel.&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <hi rend="italic">Chartism, Works</hi> 29:125.</note> The difference between a heap of old buttons tumbled into a lumber-box and a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> of the same articles sewed on one&#x2019;s coat at the right places, is very great!</p>
<p>The &#x201C;Chapter&#x201D; you find wanting in <hi rend="italic">Chartism</hi> was left out with forethought; not because I reckoned it unimportant, but for a great many other reasons.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably Ballantyne as an anti-Corn Law enthusiast wanted a chapter on the Corn Laws.</note> For these two, if there were no more: <hi rend="italic">first</hi>, that the abrogation of the Corn-Laws seems to be the cause of the Middle Classes and manufacturing Capitalists still <hi rend="italic">more</hi> than it is that of the Lower Classes,&#x2014;whose wretched social situation, however it might be alleviated for a few years, could in no wise, as I think, be <hi rend="italic">cured</hi> thereby, nor even, without other provisoes, be put more decisively on the way towards cure; and <hi rend="italic">secondly</hi>, because this cause, whatever its worth be, <hi rend="italic">has</hi> found a voice, and talks very loud without help of mine, while the great cause I was speaking for, the soul of all justifiable Radicalism as I think, and of which this other is but an outpost and preliminary, continues <hi rend="italic">dumb</hi>, able to express itself only in groans and convulsions, and does need a spokesman. I must add too that the present Radical Members and Agitators, by their profound insensibility to the condition of the poor, and indeed to the condition of anything but their own interests and self-conceit, have filled me with a deep conviction that in them is no hope; that, for the cause of the Poor, one must leave them and their battles out of view, and address rather the great solid <hi rend="italic">heart</hi> of England, the rational and just man of England, and avoiding all outposts and their inconclusive tumult, go right to the heart of the matter. Abolition of the Corn-Law is as sure to my mind, as six o&#x2019;clock is when five has struck out of all the clocks and steeples. Abolition of the Corn-Law will very probably, as I compute, enlarge to a great extent the field of manufacturing industry for England; create, we shall hope, an additional demand for labour; raise the <hi rend="italic">economic</hi> condition of the labourer,&#x2014;for a certain number of years. That surely, even for the labourer&#x2019;s sake, is most important; <hi rend="italic">during</hi> that number of years, how much, by a Government, an Aristocracy, <hi rend="italic">aware</hi> of its task, might be done for the labourer! But by a Government not <pb id="pg-12-24" n="12:24"/>aware of its task nothing will be done;&#x2014;and in that case, I really know not that the final outlook is not even worse than we now have it. For, <hi rend="italic">after</hi> the given number of years, <hi rend="italic">new</hi> labourers, fresh floods of Irishmen, were there no other, <supplied>[will]</supplied> have flowed in on us, precisely to the present excess, and <hi rend="italic">then</hi> we have no Corn-Law Abrogation to fall back upon.</p>
<p>For the rest, you do me nothing but justice in your notion of my opinion about the Corn-Law itself. I reckon it the most brazenfaced injustice and also the blindest fatuity we have to look at and suffer under in these days. It is almost ten years now since I have ceased to talk of it; more than ten years since I have heard any reason given in favour of it that was not a thrice-refuted delusion,&#x2014;which, to keep my temper unruffled, I have found it good rather to step out of the way of altogether. Unjust I call it, and delirious;&#x2014;alas, did the Aristocracy read their horoscope as I do, they would find some fitter work than wrangling for a Corn Bill! Unhappy mortals; doing no work, leaving the imperatively necessary work without so much as a thought that they are to do it; pocketing at the same time huge wages (all the land of England) for the work as if it <hi rend="italic">were done</hi>, and clamouring withal for an overplus produced by obstruction, confusion, sin, suffering and starvation! They see not that before many years go, the question will be, not &#x201C;Shall we pay such no-workers and overplus produced by starvation?&#x201D; but, &#x201C;Shall we pay them anything at all; shall we not rather fling them into outer Darkness, Chaos and Nonentity, the native parish of such?&#x201D;&#x2014; I tremble to look at these results; and find that on the whole there are <hi rend="italic">more</hi> important questions than the Corn-Law, important as that it [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>].&#x2014; I may be said to hold my peace about it not so much from having nothing to speak, as from having things to speak which there are no convenient words for at present.</p>
<p>These are some of my notions; which of course I need not tell you are intended, in that shape, for yourself only.&#x2014; The Pamphlet <hi rend="italic">Chartism</hi> finds loud but by no means melodious greeting from the public press. I see few of the &#x201C;articles&#x201D;; but most of them seem to accuse me of a leaning to &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Conservatism</hi>.&#x201D; It must be so, Plato, thou reason&#x2019;st well!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Joseph Addison, <hi rend="italic">Cato</hi> 5.1.</note> The Bookseller tells me it circulates rather extensively;&#x2014; if <hi rend="italic">among</hi> the Conservatives, so much the better; your hidebound Benthamee Radical can get no good of it, except his temper disturbed, and gall-secretion put out of its way.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Harriet Martineau described her response to Fanny Wedgwood, <date when="1840-01-17">17 Jan.</date>: &#x201C;&#x2018;Chartism&#x2019; gave me more pleasure and less pain than I expected in the reading: but the more I think it over the worse it looks.

<salute>Dear Alick,</salute>
<p>Take a single word from me today, to signify that Jack is actually off. He went this morning at 8 o&#x2019;clock; was to breakfast with his man up in town, and then go by the railway at &#xBD; past 9. They are, if they have prospered as was natural, about Birmingham at this hour. They are in the Mail-train. It was uncertain whether they would not go right on with the mail-bags over to Dublin this very night: a first-rate steamer is always waiting for the mail; leaves you just an hour to get into her; and then dashes off. It would depend upon their own humour on arriving at Liverpool. They might wait if they liked till tomorrow <pb id="pg-12-26" n="12:26"/>morning, and then go with the other mail steamer: in that latter case they would arrive at Dublin tomorrow evening; in the former (which Jack seemed to prefer for his part, and think not unlikely) they would be there tomorrow morning. Tell our good Mother not to be in the least uneasy about the sea passage over to Dublin: they are the <hi rend="italic">best</hi> steamers and the best navigated in the Port of Liverpool, immense strong ships, these Post-office Dublin steamers; the voyage I suppose is not farther than to Annan, and certainly attended with less risk.&#x2014; Jack was to write to her from Dublin, so soon as he could find paper and ink; on Wednesday or perhaps Tuesday, you may hope to hear from him at Ecclef<hi rend="italic">n</hi> that all is right. They were to stay some three days in Dublin; to which place Jack had procured numerous introductions. He was, on the whole, in good spirits this morning, and for the last day or two. He was to have his expenses borne; to look at the thing for a month; and have &#xa3;50, if he did not like to concern himself with it farther; &#xa3;500 with every accommodation if he chose to engage with it for a year. Better wages need not be desired. True it is not possible for a man with his hair so grey to be comfortable when he has no fixed home, or constant work: but this is a thing our Doctor, as I often told him, can alter now whenever he likes. If the situation please him ill; it will possibly be no disadvantage; for it may set him more decisively on seeking some permanent up-putting. He talked of Ryde in the Isle of Wight<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On the north coast, five mi. SW of Portsmouth.</note> as a place to settle at; he and I talked of many places&#x2014;but nothing whatever could get beyond the length of theory with us.</p>
<p>Poor Doil, he has left me very dull; as dull as anybody in London need be. I think how I could give him no shelter, but a most imperfect one; how he could find no <hi rend="italic">home</hi> with me either; no home anywhere now, but must go and seek one for himself, as is the lot of man! Good go with him, the true Brother,&#x2014;whose very faults are parts of his guileless innocent character; a man whom I scold often, but whom I love well!</p>
<p>No farther word from me today. We hope your household has got round again to health. Be thankful in these sad times for a <hi rend="italic">small</hi> shelter; do not discourage yourself if your trade do fall off a little: how can it do otherwise in the saddest year this country has seen for long?&#x2014; Thank my dear Mother for her kind word. Tell Jamie I had his Letter and, will answer it.&#x2014; That Note came from Jean this morning;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >None found.</note> perhaps even round by London news from Dumfries may now be new!</p>
<p><pb id="pg-12-27" n="12:27"/>I want you to get me a <hi rend="italic">Stone more of Tobacco</hi>. Pray set about it without delay. I will say afterwards how it is to be sent &#x26;c.</p>
<p>God bless you all. Jane&#x2019;s love with mine.</p>

<salute>Dear Milnes,</salute>
<p>The demon of <hi rend="italic">Dyspepsia</hi> sits heavy on me at present. On friday I cannot come to breakfast;&#x2014;but shall try nevertheless to come to <pb id="pg-12-28" n="12:28"/><hi rend="italic">broken</hi>fast; that is to say, about eleven or soon after, I will hope to walk in, and hear and see you a little, as the niggardly Destinies allow.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For the breakfast on <date when="1840-02-07">7 Feb.</date>, see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400211-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1840-02-11">11 Feb.</date></ref></note></p>
<p>A Brother of mine, who has left me in these days, had undertaken to procure for a certain German Physician two orders of admittance to the House of Commons. Something miswent in the enterprise; and now my Brother writes to me in anxiety about it, from Dublin. The orders were to be for separate nights; that the stranger might have a better chance to get in. His Address is &#x201C;Dr Brunner, Chandos House, Cavendish Square.&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably Dr. Brunn, John A. Carlyle&#x2019;s medical friend from Coethen; see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350216-TC-JAC-01"><sic>8:47</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1835-02-16">16 Feb. 1835</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014; If the thing be not too complex, perhaps you, without going farther, could do it? If the two requisite orders (for <hi rend="italic">separate</hi> nights, such as <hi rend="italic">you</hi> chose, the sooner the better) were put into a cover to that address, and forwarded with the inclosed Card, my hands were washed of it. Shall I tell my Brother that it is a thing done?</p>
<p>No certain news of the Emerson Article yet;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Milnes&#x2019; article on Emerson; see <ref target="volume-11/lt-18391228-TC-RMM-01">TC to RMM, <date when="1839-12-28">28 Dec. 1839</date></ref>.</note> but I go on the hypothesis of <hi rend="italic">reading</hi> it, in indubitable print, before long. My curiosity is considerable.</p>
<p>Could you ask your friend Kemble if he know any rational Danish Grammar calculated for an English, German, French or other <hi rend="italic">articulate</hi>-speaking man?<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Mitchell Kemble; see <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390311-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1839-03-11">11 March 1839</date></ref>; at Trinity with Milnes; studied philology under Jacob Grimm in Germany; ed. of <hi rend="italic">Beowulf</hi>, <date when="1833-00-00">1833</date>.</note> Also any Danish-English &#x26;c Dictionary; and at what shop such implements are to be had.

<p><salute>Dear Sir,&#x2014;</salute>It would surely be a duty and a luxury to help a young man struggling in such difficulties, outward and inward, as those of your <pb id="pg-12-30" n="12:30"/>cousin.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Dodds (<date when="1813-00-00">1813</date>&#x2013;<date when="1874-00-00">74</date>), lawyer, lecturer and poet; apprenticed to Thomas Scott, a solicitor in Melrose, <date when="1836-00-00">1836</date>&#x2013;<date when="1841-00-00">41</date>, having previously been a strolling actor, schoolmaster, and ed. without success. He took TC&#x2019;s advice and, once qualified, and m. to Janet Pringle, he went to Edinburgh to work as a solicitor&#x2019;s clerk. TC corresponded with him after this letter. He met TC in <date when="1843-00-00">1843</date> through John Gordon, who also introduced him to John Hunter, whose firm (Lockhart, Hunter, &#x26; Whitehead) Dodds then joined. He moved to London, <date when="1846-00-00">1846</date>, and set up successfully as a parliamentary agent, his firm managing private bills, concerning the railway, and Scots appeal cases to the House of Lords. Through TC he became friendly with John Carlyle, Craik, G. H. Lewes, and particularly Leigh Hunt. He wrote <hi rend="italic">Fifty Years&#x2019; Struggle of the Scottish Covenanters, <date when="1633-00-00">1633</date>&#x2013;<date when="1688-00-00">88</date></hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1860-00-00">1860</date>), <hi rend="italic">Thomas Chalmers</hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1870-00-00">1870</date>), and other works.</note> Unfortunately, however, there seems nothing, or very little, beyond barren sympathy and wishes, that I could offer in the way of help. A man is not so easily <hi rend="italic">helped;</hi> the help that would avail such a man as your cousin seems to be must come from within rather than from without.</p>
<p>As to this project of writing for the periodical press, I must say, in the first place, that there is yet no evidence of your cousin&#x2019;s having acquired a faculty to write what would be successful or useful there. Then, secondly, my concern with that department of things was always in the utmost degree <hi rend="italic">exoteric</hi>, and for a good many years back has altogether ceased; so that any furtherance of mine could advance him but a little way, if at all. And then, alas! thirdly, that it is doubtful to me whether the highest conceivable &#x201C;success&#x201D; in that course might not be for your cousin an <hi rend="italic">evil</hi> in place of a blessing. I speak advisedly in this matter. There is no madder section of human business now weltering under the sun than that of periodical literature in England at this day. The meagrest bread-and-water wages at any honest, steady occupation, I should say, are preferable for a young man, especially for an ambitious, excitable young man. I mistake much if your cousin were not wise to stick steadfastly by his law and what benefits it will yield him; studying, of course, in all ways, to perfect and cultivate himself, but leaving all literary glory, &#x26;c. &#x26;c., to lie in the distance, an obscure possibility of the future, which he might attain, perhaps, but also could do very well without attaining. In another year, it seems, his official salary may be expected to increase into something tolerable; he has his mother and loved ones within reach; he has, or by diligence can borrow and have, some books worth reading; his own free heart is within him, to shape into humble wisdom, or mar into violent madness; God&#x2019;s great sky is over him, God&#x2019;s green, peaceable earth around him. I really know not that he ought to be in haste to quit such arrangements.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, if he persist in the purpose to write, which, in my ignorance of the details of his situation I know not that he should <pb id="pg-12-31" n="12:31"/>absolutely avoid doing, let him by all means try it. If he turn out to have the fit talent, he will decidedly find an editor; if not, it is better in all ways that he do not find one. I will, with great readiness, forward his paper to the proprietor of <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine</hi>, who is my bookseller, and have it looked at. I would offer it to any other editor whom your cousin might suggest, provided I know such editor; but except Mr. Tait of Edinburgh, whom I did once know, I can think of no other much worth applying to, if, indeed, these be worth it! They will make short work of the business, and answer truly, &#x201C;This thing seems <hi rend="italic">fit</hi> for <hi rend="italic">us</hi>; this thing seems not fit!&#x201D; That is all they will answer.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I should say that your cousin ought decidedly to try for some other subject to start with than criticism on Shakespeare. Doubtless <hi rend="italic">he</hi> must know best what he has the call to write upon, if he have really an <hi rend="italic">inward</hi> call. But the thing he will have the chance to write entertainingly upon will be something <hi rend="italic">he</hi> specially himself has seen; not probably Shakespeare, I should say, which all the world these two centuries has been doing its best to see.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >When he was eleven, Dodds had run away from Mertoun to Edinburgh: &#x201C;I had a vague idea of living by my pen, and carried away in my flight a quantity of poems, and a history of the world, by which I expected to get riches to live upon, and immortal fame after death.&#x201D; During his apprenticeship he not only spoke often in the Borders in political meetings, as a liberal, but was also a popular lecturer and reciter of Shakespeare (Dodds, <hi rend="italic">LC</hi> 6, 38&#x2013;40).</note> Excuse this abruptness. Heaven knows I would gladly help your cousin if I could. &#x03C4;&#x03BB;&#x1FC6;&#x03C4;&#x03B5; &#x03C6;&#x03AF;&#x03BB;&#x03BF;&#x03B9; [endure my friends]!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Homer, <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> 2:299.</note> <closer><salute>For the present I subscribe myself</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Your two Letters<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> have arrived. I was right glad of both; of the first especially; for the wind grew so loud that Saturday-night that I lay listening to it fancying you had either not gone, or must be tumbling about in great discomfort,&#x2014;who knew if not in danger? It appears you did go, and were safe asleep all the while. Heaven be thanked things went so well!</p>
<p>For the rest, I wish I had stood by my first purpose of writing to you on Wednesday (yesterday). I was in somewhat better ease yesterday; last night however I did not sleep &#x26;c, and today am somewhat of <pb id="pg-12-32" n="12:32"/>the dolefullest. But your first Letter said &#x201C;write on Thursday&#x201D;;&#x2014;perhaps meaning &#x201C;write <hi rend="italic">for</hi> Thursday?&#x201D; I can do no other now.</p>
<p>Of Saturday and all the thoughts I had it is needless to speak at all. It was one of the sorrowfullest days I ever spent; moping, regretting, secretly deploring:&#x2014;but it was spent in <hi rend="italic">silence</hi>, thank God; and I need not recall it into speech now. Your room here seemed to me like a thing I had cruelly <hi rend="italic">inherited</hi>; all the traces of you occurring at every place and hour were <hi rend="italic">mortuary:</hi> Poor Doil could get no shelter <hi rend="italic">here;</hi> and now he is gone, and needs none from thee! It was, as you say, an experiment that needed to be made: we will try the next under a change of conditions, and hope it may be more successful.</p>
<p>I sit here all the forenoons; the visible or even invisible work I have done is hitherto very small. But it is good in all ways for me to be left alone. &#x201C;Ay <foreign>maistly</foreign> works in a place by himsel&#x2019;!&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350128-TC-JCA-01"><sic>8:21</sic><corr>TC to JCA, <date when="1835-01-28">28 Jan. 1835</date></corr></ref>.</note> I shall have something more to do by and by; I ought to <hi rend="italic">keep</hi> myself in equilibrium till the word come to me. One of the most palpably wise things executable by me, were the getting back of my horse; which accordingly I resolve to do before long,&#x2014;the instant the roads and weather dry. I still merely read Norse Books,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><p>TC wrote in his Journal, <date when="1840-01-21">21 Jan.</date>: &#x201C;Reading Scandinavian things; set on by <hi rend="italic">Frithiof&#x2019;s</hi> Saga. The real old <hi rend="italic">Frithiof</hi> an excellent thing; Tegner the modernizer of it a watery singing man.&#x2014; I have got some incipient notions of Iceland. Odde, where Saegmund (first <hi rend="italic">Edda</hi>) lived and Snorro was educated. Snorro&#x2019;s Farm; both still extant; Snorro&#x2019;s second <hi rend="italic">Edda</hi>. Wish I could read these old Sagas for Frithiof&#x2019;s sake.&#x201D; About this time TC had been reading a number of books about Iceland and about Swedenborg, and he set down some purposeful notes as given below. Books he had been reading included <hi rend="italic">Frithiof&#x2019;s Saga</hi> (mentioned at the start) as retold by the Swedish poet Esaias Tegn&#xE9;r (<date when="1782-00-00">1782</date>&#x2013;<date when="1846-00-00">1846</date>), who was educated at Lund Univ., graduated <date when="1802-00-00">1802</date>, and was appointed prof. of Greek, <date when="1812-00-00">1812</date>. He remained at Lund till appointed bishop of V&#xE4;xj&#xF6;, <date when="1824-00-00">1824</date>. His greatest poem was <hi rend="italic">Frithiof&#x2019;s Saga</hi> (<date when="1825-00-00">1825</date>), a cycle based on an Icelandic saga of the fourteenth cent., which became a national poem and was trans. into most European languages. If TC read it in an English (rather than German) trans., there were several to choose from, such as George Stephens, <hi rend="italic">Frithiof&#x2019;s Saga, A Legend of the North</hi> (Stockholm and London, <date when="1839-00-00">1839</date>), which included a trans. of the <hi rend="italic">Sagann af Fridtheof Fraekna</hi> that it explained was taken &#x201C;from the Icelandic text in <hi rend="italic">Bj&#xF6;rner&#x2019;s Kampa Data</hi>.&#x201D; Evidently unknown to TC, this was <hi rend="italic">Nordiska K&#xE4;mper Dater,</hi> ed. Enricus Julius Bjoerner (Stockholm, <date when="1737-00-00">1737</date>). After this, TC made notes on <hi rend="italic">Iceland; or the Journal of a Residence in that Island, during the years <date when="1814-00-00">1814</date> and <date when="1815-00-00">1815</date></hi>, 2 vols. (Edinburgh, <date when="1818-00-00">1818</date>) by Ebenezer Henderson (<date when="1784-00-00">1784</date>&#x2013;<date when="1854-00-00">1854</date>), Scots linguist, missionary and theological writer. TC refers to Finnr J&#xf3;nsson, bishop of Sk&#xE1;lholt, <hi rend="italic">F. Johann&#xe6;i &#x2026; Historia Ecclesiastica Islandiae,</hi> 4 vols. (Copenhagen, <date when="1772-00-00">1772</date>&#x2013;<date when="1778-00-00">78</date>), but knew of his work only from a footnote by Henderson. He had evidently read Sir George Steuart Mackenzie, <hi rend="italic">Travels in the Island of Iceland</hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1811-00-00">1811</date>). He speaks of using the edn. of <hi rend="italic">Heims Kringla, eller Snorre Sturlusons</hi>, in Swedish, Latin and Icelandic, ed. J. Peringski&#xF6;ld, 2 vols. (Stockholm, <date when="1697-00-00">1697</date>), borrowed from Hensleigh Wedgwood, and notes having read the <hi rend="italic">Narrative of an Expedition to the East Coast of Greenland &#x2026; under the Command of Captn W. A. Graah, of the Danish Royal Navy &#x2026; translated from the Danish by the late G. Gordon MacDougall, F.R.S.N.A.</hi> (London, <date when="1837-00-00">1837</date>). He evidently turned to the <hi rend="italic">Introduction &#xE0; L&#x2019;Histoire de Dannemarc, o&#xf9; l&#x2019;on traite de la religion, des loix, des moeurs, et des usages des anciens Danois,</hi> 2 vols. (Copenhagen, <date when="1755-00-00">1755</date>&#x2013;<date when="1756-00-00">56</date>), by Paul Henri Mallet (<date when="1730-00-00">1730</date>&#x2013;<date when="1807-00-00">1807</date>). He makes a note about &#x201C;Lindl&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Faroe Isles</hi>,&#x201D; evidently meaning <hi rend="italic">A description of the Feroe Islands, containing an account of their Situation, Climate, and Productions</hi> (London, <date when="1810-00-00">1810</date>; in Danish, <date when="1800-00-00">1800</date>), by the Rev. J&#xf8;rgen J&#xf8;rgensen Landt (ca. <date when="1753-00-00">1753</date>&#x2013;<date when="1804-00-00">1804</date>). TC evidently knew of <hi rend="italic">Hermes Scythicus; or, the Radical Affinities of the Greek and Latin Languages to the Gothic</hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1814-00-00">1814</date>), by Dr. John Jamieson (<date when="1759-00-00">1759</date>&#x2013;<date when="1838-00-00">1838</date>); <hi rend="italic">Popular Ballads and Songs</hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1806-00-00">1806</date>), ed. Robert Jamieson (<date when="1780-00-00">1780</date>?&#x2013;<date when="1844-00-00">1844</date>); and works by the Rev. James Johnstone (d. <date when="1798-00-00">1798</date>), British chaplain at Copenhagen, who was born in Edinburgh, trans. of <hi rend="italic">The Norwegian Account of Haco&#x2019;s Expedition against Scotland A.D. <date when="1263-00-00">1263</date></hi> (Copenhagen and Edinburgh, <date when="1782-00-00">1782</date>) and author of <hi rend="italic">Antiquitates Celto-Normanicae</hi> (Copenhagen, <date when="1786-00-00">1786</date>). All of this reading is of particular interest because it antedates the lectures on <hi rend="italic">Heroes,</hi> although the subject had not yet been decided on, so that the two interest appear to have converged. Two and a half years later (<date when="1842-10-05">5 Oct. 1842</date>), TC returned to <hi rend="italic">Frithiof&#x2019;s Saga</hi>, to set down the story in his own words (FC: Forster MS, F.48.E.36, f.95). His jottings on Emanuel Swedenborg (see also <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390928-TC-JJGW-01">TC to JJGW, [<date when="1839-09-28">28 Sept. 1839</date>]</ref>) show that he had been reading a <hi rend="italic">Life of Emanuel Swedenborg, with some account of his writings; together with a brief notice of the rise and progress of the New Church</hi> (Boston, Mass., <date when="1831-00-00">1831</date>); also the 1st vol. of Johann Friedrich Immanuel Tafel, ed. <hi rend="italic">Sammlung von Urkunden betreffend das Leben und den Charakter E. Swedenborgs &#x2026; aus den Quellen treu wiedergegeben und mit Anmerkungen</hi>, 3 vols. (T&#xfc;bingen, <date when="1839-00-00">1839</date>&#x2013;<date when="1842-00-00">42</date>).</p>
<p><title><hi rend="italic">&#x201C;Norse Literature</hi></title></p>
<p>&#x201C;Frithiof&#x2019;s Saga, by Tegner set me on that. Tegner&#x2019;s version of the old Saga worth nothing very immense; but the old Saga itself an interesting thing (&#x2018;translated,&#x2019; it is said, &#x2018;from <hi rend="italic">Bj&#xF6;rner&#x2019;s K&#xE4;mpa Dater,&#x2019;</hi> whatever that may be); I wish I had plenty more of them!</p>

<p><hi rend="italic">&#x201C;Henderson&#x2019;s Travel&#x2019;s</hi> [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] <hi rend="italic">in Iceland;</hi> a simple Book; the man a Traveller for Bible society business, <hi rend="italic">has</hi> a pair of eyes, and one works something out of him. Was at the top of Snaefell J&#xF6;kul. Gives one a notion of peaceable grass vallies along the coast, of grim chaotic ice-solitudes, mud-volcanoes, lava-ruins, snow, heath, and steamy springs in the interior; poverty, contentment, simplicity, dirt and cutaneous disorders; has great difficulties in fording rivers which roll down from the snow-reservoirs very copiously in summer, carrying masses of ice; great difficulty in rough roads, precipices and the like; lives all winter at Reykiavik seemingly in a torpid state,&#x2014;a dirty punch-drinking card-playing set of Danish shopclerks and supercargoes there, &#x2018;with the pipe never out of their mouth.&#x2019; Sees <hi rend="italic">Holum</hi> (anciently Hoolum) in the North; printing-house now a stable. Does not see Skalholt (once a printing-place too, and a School) in the South. People all pilgrim to Reykiavik once a year (in spring, I think) to make their markets with the Danes; R. the only village in Iceland,&#x2014;for it too is but a village of some 500. The whole population guessed to be about 60,000.&#x2014; Bessastad a good stone house standing on the coast a few miles below Reyk<hi rend="italic">k</hi> (Once Snorro&#x2019;s property) is now the only public school: 25 scholars; beds of sea-weed ill-smelling, house dirty above &#x26; below; dark room, of 1000 vol. mostly Greek Danish German theology, their library,&#x2014;tend much to socinian courses. Holum, Skalholt and a later school all suppressed, and this <hi rend="italic">one</hi> made royal, since the middle of last century.&#x2014; Henderson saw Odd&#xE9; (<hi rend="italic">Oddi</hi>, I find signifies <foreign><hi rend="italic">linguila terrae</hi></foreign>), 30 miles S.W. of Heckla in the Rangarvalla Syssel;&#x2014;where <hi rend="italic">Saemund Sigfusson</hi> (elder Edda) had his abode. Saemund became a priest at Oddi (12 cent<hi rend="italic">y</hi>?), collected <hi rend="italic">Edda,</hi> founded a school or two at Oddi. Still better, Snorro Sturleson (Sturl<hi rend="italic">u</hi>son, H. calls him) spent 16 of his young years here, under the tuition of Saemund&#x2019;s grandson one Jou Loptson, I suppose a priest. Also there are &#x2018;Odd&#xE9; annals&#x2019;&#x2014;by whom? (Jonson, <hi rend="italic">Hist. Eccles. Island.</hi>!) Well then, what kind of place is Oddi O Henderson? Alas, one cannot learn clearly! S.W. of Heckla and the <hi rend="italic">Trehyrning</hi> (Three-horns) some 30 miles; lies itself on the S.<hi rend="italic">E.</hi> of a number of &#x2018;low hills very grassy&#x2019;; mounting the highest of these H. saw Heckla (&#x26; Tr.) disappointingly, saw &#x2018;the largest plain in Iceland&#x2019; some twenty miles in diameter (that is, a low grassy tract, of <hi rend="italic">knoles</hi>, called a plain, very grassy making a large <foreign><hi rend="italic">Tun</hi></foreign> (<hi rend="italic">Toon</hi>); very grassy, very pretty, snow mountain in the rear (sea I suppose in front), very pretty&#x2014;and that is all!&#x2014;</p>
<p>&#x201C;H. was at Reykhollt (<foreign>Reek-<hi rend="italic">shaw, aspectum, collicolum saxeti</hi></foreign>), and the day before at Hvam (a &#x2018;sloping valley&#x2019;); the latter is Snorro&#x2019;s birthplace (<date when="1178-00-00">1178</date>), the former his chief and final residence, where he was assassinated in <date when="1241-00-00">1241</date>, aged 63. One can make nothing out of H. except that Reykhollt stands in a confused <hi rend="italic">streamy</hi> country, full of <hi rend="italic">reek</hi> from boiling springs. What could one give for a <hi rend="italic">view</hi> of it! There is Hunda-hver (dog-kettle) a Tungu-hver (tongue-kettle?) &#x26;c; one is the Ar-hver (river-kettle) which boils up in the middle of the river &#x2018;from a rock eight or ten feet high&#x2019; (does not M&#x2019;Kenzie call it the <hi rend="italic">Kaldaa</hi>, that river?) Snorro got this place by marriage with &#x2018;the daughter of a rich priest who lived at Borg&#x2019; (southward a little, on the <hi rend="italic">Borgafiord</hi>.) His Bath still exists, H. bathed in it; water from the neighbouring hot marsh is brought in from a conduit. Snorro went to Odd&#xE9; (or Oddi?) as above said, at the age of 3,&#x2014;19 when he left. Raised by marriage his fortune to &#x2018;4000 rix dollars&#x2019; (not &#xa3;1000&#x2014;was even that <hi rend="italic">income</hi> annually, or property in whole?); he used to go <supplied>[to]</supplied> the <hi rend="italic">Thing</hi> sometimes with 800 men at his heels. Was <foreign><hi rend="italic">L&#xF6;gs&#xF6;gumadur</hi></foreign> (chief magistrate) for a good many years. Had the Farm of <hi rend="italic">Bessastad</hi> (where the school now is): a Patriarchal kind of man, with so many head of <foreign><hi rend="italic">Nanta</hi></foreign> (<hi rend="italic">Nowt!</hi>), with grassy meadows, hayricks, sheep, fleeces, webs,&#x2014;collecting the <hi rend="italic">Edda, Heimskringla</hi>, withal, and intriguing and polititianizing to all lengths! I find in all the North nothing that interests me more than old Snorro. Heimskringla by Peringskiold not the good edition; first vol. of it <hi rend="italic">here</hi> (Wedgwood&#x2019;s): have got little of it investigated yet. Snorro&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Laugh</hi> (Bath) has a seat round it, will hold &#x2018;30 persons&#x2019; (fancy old Snorro there!); is about 4 feet in the centre, shelves up saucer-wise towards the seat.&#x2014; Where is there any image to be got of Snorro? Try his <hi rend="italic">Heimskringla?</hi> <foreign><hi rend="italic">Vaut la chandelle</hi></foreign> [Worth the candle]?&#x2014; Little or nothing more to be got from prosy Henderson.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Graah&#x2019;s voyage to (<hi rend="italic">Icelandic</hi>) Greenland. Did not find East <hi rend="italic">Bygd;</hi> does not think it ever was on the <hi rend="italic">East</hi> coast of Greenland: &#x2018;remains&#x2019; not a few exist on the W. coast; no light at all to be got of them out of this Book; Danish antiquaries busy with them then (<date when="1828-00-00">1828</date>). A brave man this Lieut<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Graah. &#x2018;Seal&#x2019;s eyes flash fire&#x2019; when the Greenlander chaces them: how wrath and courage dwells everywhere!&#x2014; Who <hi rend="italic">are</hi> these strange bearded, dirty, frozen, famished <foreign>Esquimaux</foreign>? Something <hi rend="italic">Chinese</hi> in their eyes, Graah says. Women annoint their hair with some <hi rend="italic">urinary</hi>-liquid; a tub of which, horrible in smell, is kept in every hut. Very hospitable; have dances; have <foreign>Angekkoks</foreign> (swinderly, ventriloquism?)&#x2014;a huge or even extremely dwarfish <hi rend="italic">Monster</hi> at the bottom of the sea, &#x2018;white seafowl swim in the oil of its lamp,&#x2019; seals &#x26;c. attending it, having great power and knowledge: this is the kind of God the <foreign>Angekkoks</foreign> pretend to be in communication with. No worship or creed among the people at all (?). Northern lights are &#x2018;the spirits of the dead playing at football with the head of a Walrus&#x2019;! They also throw entrails of seal into the sea, seemingly by way of sacrifice. Great howlings when they meet, after a death has happened. Young <hi rend="italic">Yak</hi> gets a javelin in his hand, shoots from the very birth of him; becomes incredibly expert. Young women learn to sew, build, &#x2018;kill sharks in the moonlight of winter&#x2019;; very fond of finery. Have a yearly Fair among them. Sorrel seems to be their best vegetable. Hardly 500 souls in all on the East coast; and, these continually emigrating to the west, for warmer quarters and the Moravian Mission aid. Go all off together on their dog-sledges when the provisions run utterly out. Their mode of lawsuit: the injured man &#x2018;composes a satirical song,&#x2019; gets the neighbours gathered; a ring round him; he sings his song with infinite gesticulation &#x2018;cuts figures of 8 with his backside,&#x2019; jerks, twists, shuffles and sings with the tambourine (<foreign><hi rend="italic">wecht</hi></foreign> &#x26; handle to it),&#x2014;in <hi rend="italic">this</hi> way states his case: reply in the same fashion; <hi rend="italic">deeply,</hi> rejoinder &#x26;c. till both parties have enough: then &#x2018;force of public opinion&#x2019; decides it. They are extremely sensible to that, and have no other law or government. Not unveracious; not thievish or unjust; revenge very prevalent, implacable when murder happens.&#x2014; Poor fellows; with their bone spears, with their stinking seal-flesh, with their urine-cosmetics: what a world!</p>

<p><pb id="pg-12-36" n="12:36"/>An Italian Courier came here the other day; endeavouring to speak unintelligible English: I set him upon French; and it then seemed he wanted little or indeed nothing with you except to know &#x201C;whether the Duke <hi rend="italic">were</hi> going abroad&#x201D; &#x26;c!

F. answered in writing that <hi rend="italic">you</hi> were gone to the North of Ireland and likely to stay some time; but that your Brother&#x2019;s address was so and so, by whom any kind of communication was open. I have yet heard no tidings farther of this Captain Ricketts. No Parcels Company people called for the Box; it was sent off so soon as I could understand it (that is yesterday) by the Carrier.&#x2014; I wrote to Milnes about your two orders for the House of Commons; he had chanced to ask me <pb id="pg-12-37" n="12:37"/>to breakfast for friday that very morning. I enclosed my card and address bearing these words &#x201C;With Dr Carlyle&#x2019;s compliments&#x201D;; requested Milnes to forward the orders with that to your German;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. Brunn or Brunner; see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400204-TC-RMM-01">TC to RMM, [<date when="1840-02-04">4 Feb.</date>]</ref>.</note> and today Milnes writes me that they are with him. I will not go to breakfast tomorrow; I am not able: perhaps I may walk in upon them after breakfast and see who they are.</p>
<p>Fraser did not settle with me; does not seem ready to settle with me; pleaded hurry, trouble, immense difficulty of getting ready accounts &#x26;c: I am in such a wretched state of bodily irritability, that I had as soon it lay over for a few days. Mary&#x2019;s &#xa3;30 I suppose, however, will <hi rend="italic">be</hi> to be sent; I will <hi rend="italic">make</hi> Fraser table when that becomes necessary: I wrote yesterday to Jamie to ascertain <hi rend="italic">what</hi> sum specially it would be proper to send as the final one, and when was the time for sending it.</p>
<p>My Lectures come into my head occasionally; I have no appetite whatever that way; but must perform, I suppose: probably the black <hi rend="italic">horse</hi> will be one of the indispensablest performers in that!

Since most of his works were only available at this time in Polish or French it is not clear what TC means by &#x201C;books translated from the French.&#x201D; Mazzini admired Mickiewicz&#x2019;s poetry, though not his intense Catholicism and royalism, and had written an article on him in English, &#x201C;Literature and Education,&#x201D; for the second issue of <hi rend="italic">The Polish Monthly Magazine</hi> (<date when="1838-11-00">Nov. 1838</date>). TC&#x2019;s description of Mickiewicz is presumably based on information from Mazzini, who described him in very similar though more detailed terms to his mother, <date when="1840-01-15">15 Jan.</date> (<hi rend="italic">Scritti di Mazzini</hi> [Imola, <date when="1906-00-00">1906</date>&#x2013;<date when="1943-00-00">43</date>] 18:338). Mickiewicz had been prof. of Latin at the Acad&#xE9;mie de Lausanne since autumn <date when="1839-00-00">1839</date>. He became the first prof. of Slavonic languages and literature at the Coll&#xE8;ge de France, Paris, <date when="1840-12-00">Dec. 1840</date> to <date when="1844-05-00">May 1844</date>, when his increasing mysticism and apostolicism led to his replacement.

<salute>Dear Jenny,</salute>
<p>Had I known definitely how to address a word to you, I might surely have done so long before this. We have heard in general that you are stationed somewhere in the Village of Kirtlebridge or near it, and we fancy in general that your husband is struggling along with his old impetuosity. From yourself we have no tidings. Pray, now that the Postage is so cheap, send us a pennyworth some day. I address this through Alick, fancying such may be the best way.</p>
<p>I enclose my last letter from the Doctor. I wrote to him the day before yesterday to his final destination. I calculate he may have got my letter to-day,&#x2014;that is two days after his arrival. By that note all seems to be going well with him;&#x2014;we are all well here, as well as our wont is, and fighting along with printers, proof sheets &#x26;c, &#x26;c. Jane cannot regularly get out; so horribly tempestuous, wet and uncertain is the weather, which keeps her still sickly, but she never breaks actually down. How is the little &#x201C;trader,&#x201D; as Jean or some of them call her? I remember the &#x201C;bit creeture&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Margaret Aitken Carlyle Hanning (b. <date when="1838-00-00">1838</date>). &#x201C;Trader&#x201D; is presumably because her father had been a shopkeeper.</note> very distinctly.</p>
<p>This is the worst year or among the worst for working people ever seen in man&#x2019;s memory. Robert must not take this as a measure of his future success, but toil away steadfastly in sure hope of <hi rend="italic">better</hi> times. It is well anyway that you are out of Manchester; nothing there but hunger, contention and despair&#x2014;added to the reek and dirt! Be diligent and fear nothing.</p>
<p>Do you often run over to see our dear Mother in her Upper Room yonder? It will be a great comfort to her that she has you so near. Pray explain to me what part of the Village it is that you live in. I thought I knew it all, but I do not know Firpark Nook. Give my best wishes to your Goodman. Accept my thanks for your written remembrance, from one who always silently remembers you in his heart.</p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Yesterday I had a short Note written for you, inclosing that brief word of the Doctor&#x2019;s which had arrived the day before; but it proved to be some minutes too late for the Post; so I burn it, and write you a little more at large, the first thing I do today. Jack&#x2019;s word is in the highest degree brief; but it announces that he has arrived safe at his quarters, and found matters fully as favourable as he expected: this, if you have heard nothing from him after Dublin, will be very welcome to you. He is now much nearer Scotsbrig than he was in London: indeed I suppose there is a Steamboat from Londonderry to Glasgow which would bring him over in not many hours. The Penny-Postage, added to this circumstance, ought to make us contrast the Dungiven position favourably with those Italian ones far over sea. I sent the Doctor&#x2019;s last Note from Dublin round to Jenny at Kirtlebridge the other day; most probably she would shew it you; except his continued welfare and good prospects there was nothing in it. I wrote in answer to that; but he would not get my Letter, I think, till about Saturday last.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> was not sent to <hi rend="italic">you</hi> yesterday, but round to him, that he might forward it to you, with <hi rend="italic">his</hi> mark on it, I hope. There is an attack in it on the &#x201C;Condition-of-England Question,&#x201D; wherein the Editor, without naming me, does me the honour to be in a considerable vexation at the thing I have said, and set others in the way of saying and doing!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400211-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1840-02-11">11 Feb.</date></ref></note> From a respectable housedog, stationed there to bark in behalf of the present Ministry, nothing better could be desired. The people are beginning to discover (wise men as they are!) that I am not a &#x201C;Tory,&#x201D; ah no; but one of the deepest tho&#x2019; perhaps the quietest of all the radicals now extant in the world; a thing productive of small comfort to several persons! &#x201C;They have said, and they will say, and let them say&#x201D; &#x26;c. &#x26;c.</p>
<p>Yesterday the idle portion of the Town was in a sort of flurry owing to the marriage of little Queen Victory. I had to go out to breakfast with an ancient Notable of this place, one named Rogers the Poet and Banker; my way lay past little Victory&#x2019;s Palace, and a perceptible crowd was gathering there even then, which went on increasing all the time till I returned (about one o&#x2019;clock); streams of idle <foreign><hi rend="italic">gomerils</hi></foreign> [blockheads] flowing in from all quarters, to see one knows not <pb id="pg-12-41" n="12:41"/>what,&#x2014;perhaps Victory&#x2019;s gilt coach and other gilt coaches drive out, for that would be all! It was a wet day too, of bitter heavy showers, and abundant mud: I steered, by a small circuit, out of their road altogether, and except the clanking of some bells in the after part of the day heard no more of it.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Samuel Rogers lived at 22 St. James&#x2019;s Pl. Huge crowds assembled in the morning when Prince Albert (<date when="1819-00-00">1819</date>&#x2013;<date when="1861-00-00">61</date>), second son of the Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, and then the Queen left Buckingham Palace about midday for the Chapel Royal, St. James&#x2019;s, where the wedding was performed. They returned together to the palace, and left for Windsor Castle in the afternoon.</note> Poor little thing, I wish her marriage all prosperity too;&#x2014;but it is her business, not mine. She has many enemies among the Tories, who report all kinds of spiteful things about her; she seems also to have abundance of obstinate temper, and no great overplus of sense:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Greville referred to &#x201C;the busy mischief-makers and angry Tories, who make bad as much worse as they can.&#x201D; Victoria completely identified herself with Melbourne and the Whigs and was hostile to all Tories. Greville also commented that &#x201C;she had been as wilful, obstinate and wrongheaded as usual about her invitations&#x201D; (<date when="1840-02-13">13</date> and <date when="1840-02-18">18 Feb.</date>, <hi rend="italic">Greville Memoirs</hi> 4:240, 242).</note> I see too clearly great misery lying in store for her, if she live some years; and Prince Albert, I can tell him, had got no sinecure by the end! As for him, they say he is a sensible lad; which circumstance may be of much service here: he burst into tears, in leaving his little native Coburg, a small quiet town, like Annan for example; poor fellow, he thought I suppose how he was bidding <foreign>adieu</foreign> to <hi rend="italic">quiet</hi> there, and would probably never know <hi rend="italic">it</hi> any more, whatever else he might know.</p>
<p>Today however we have bright weather; good for invalids! That is always the alternation: bright and black; never eight-and-forty hours alike: bad weather I do imagine for all sorts of field work. So soon as it fairly dries, I will have my horse again; it will do me decided good. Neither Jane nor I are specifically complaining: yet she for one is by no means strong; being incapable of getting out in such weather, she cannot be vigorous. Our quality being now all back to Town, there is far more tumult too: I keep as much as possible <hi rend="italic">out</hi> of all that; and design to accept the fewest possible number of invitations this way or that; no good comes to me from such: a dinner with Victory and Albert even would hardly be worth having, at the cost of such a head as I have next day! My time, do what I can, gets itself dreadfully frittered away here; I think it no good place for a Writer to be in,&#x2014;if he could get his living in any other. Proofsheets and <foreign><hi rend="italic">etceteras</hi></foreign> go weltering on; the Printers proceed far more slowly than I wish; but we must not put ourselves in <foreign><hi rend="italic">fash</hi></foreign> [worry] about them; they will be done one day or other.</p>
<p>Jamie I suppose would receive the Letter I sent him. What progress has Alick made in the matter of the Tobacco? I should like well to <pb id="pg-12-42" n="12:42"/>hear that he had it lying by him with <hi rend="italic">permits</hi><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Issued by a &#x201C;permit writer,&#x201D; or the local excise officer in smaller places, authorizing movement of exciseable goods, in this case tobacco, after evidence of duty payment had been produced. This requirement was abolished in <date when="1840-07-00">July</date>.</note> &#x26;c, ready for despatch: my stock here is waning away fast enough. The Glasgow Pipes have never yet come, tho&#x2019; all the parties interested seem to say they will come directly; I have never yet absolutely got thro&#x2019; my old stock, tho&#x2019; long hanging on the verge of that.</p>
<p>Now, dear Mother, why do you not take a sheet any day, and writing on it, &#x201C;Dear Tom, I am so and so,&#x201D; send it off to me? I <hi rend="italic">hope</hi> you continue tolerably well, in spite of all roughness of Spring weather: but you ought to make a point now, I think, of telling me so, very often. I can do <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> for you but <hi rend="italic">ask;</hi> the more is the pity! But yet it is a blessing that except our affection you do not need anything from any one. Do you often get over to see Jenny, now when she is near? I suppose the weather is too wild as yet; but it will gradually mend now. Austin, I vote, should bring up the Pony, and drive you down in the Gig to see Gill, when the sun breaks out. They will be in a heap of confusions till once the new house be up and the premises clear.&#x2014; Are Alick&#x2019;s people young and old got well out of small-pox? He might write me on a bit of paper to say Yes.&#x2014;</p>
<p>I live down stairs now in the room that was Jack&#x2019;s (poor Jack, I feel as if I had <hi rend="italic">inherited</hi> him); we breakfast there; and then the fire being already lighted, I occupy the place with <hi rend="italic">close</hi> doors till I like to go out for walking. Jane is upstairs, or she would, in express words, send you her love. My love in word and in thought to one and all! <closer><salute>Good be with you dear Mother!</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Your Note<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1840-02-08">8 Feb.</date></note> arrived yesterday morning; welcome tidings so far as it went, we expect to hear more minutely one of these days. I have written to my Mother today, chiefly to apprise her of your safe arrival: as there seemed nothing secret in your Note, I inclosed that itself in my sheet, thinking she would like it better. Whenever you specially want anything to go no farther than myself, give some indication of your <pb id="pg-12-43" n="12:43"/>wish, and I will strictly follow it. In other and in all cases I hope my own attention to such considerations will be awake.</p>
<p>On Saturday night these Notes came from W. Hamilton: they can be of no immediate use to you; but they may as well be in your keeping as in mine. Hamilton<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Hamilton (d. <date when="1851-00-00">1851</date>; see <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310712-TC-JAC-01"><sic>5:302</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1831-07-12">12 July 1831</date></corr></ref>), an elder (<date when="1827-00-00">1827</date>&#x2013;<date when="1851-00-00">51</date>) of the National Scottish Church, Regent Sq. (previously Irving&#x2019;s church), was apparently an evangelical. The whole congregation and its minister, James Hamilton, left the Church of Scotland at the Disruption. He had m. Edward Irving&#x2019;s sister-in-law, Elizabeth Martin (<date when="1799-00-00">1799</date>&#x2013;<date when="1859-00-00">1859</date>).</note> asks me farther to get him introduction to the <hi rend="italic">Times Newspaper</hi> for certain Scotch Friends who are coming or come hither to advocate the antipatronage cause of the Scotch <foreign>Kirk</foreign>!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The divisions over patronage in the Church of Scotland (see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18330127-TC-MAC-01"><sic>6:312</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1833-01-27">27 Jan. 1833</date></corr></ref>) had reached another crisis with the case of the Rev. John Edwards, presented to Marnoch, Aberdeenshire, <date when="1837-00-00">1837</date>. Rejected by that congregation and then the General Assembly of <date when="1838-00-00">1838</date>, he appealed for legal backing. Petitions against the intrusion of ministers into parishes against the wish of parishioners were presented to parliament this month. The deputation, mentioned by TC, from the General Assembly&#x2019;s non-intrusion committee, consisted of the Rev. Robert Buchanan (<date when="1802-00-00">1802</date>&#x2013;<date when="1875-00-00">75</date>), a leading evangelical, and Alexander C. S. M. Dunlop (<date when="1798-00-00">1798</date>&#x2013;<date when="1870-00-00">1870</date>), advocate and procurator for the Free Church, <date when="1843-00-00">1843</date>. They hoped to negotiate a measure to protect the church from state interference on the matter of patronage or non-intrusion. They had arrived <date when="1840-02-00">early in Feb.</date> and first met Lord Melbourne on <date when="1840-02-19">19 Feb.</date> They were unsuccessful.</note> I can do nothing in that. I have not answered yet.</p>
<p>Nothing new has occurred with me since I wrote,&#x2014;if it be not that I have got my hair close cropt! Nothing has arrived, except worthless pamphlets &#x26;c. Mazzini was here, Craik, Cavaignac; they all asked kindly for you; the two latter specially desired to be remembered. Poor Mazzini, I suppose, perhaps felt the want of you more than anybody, no Italian medical adviser now here for him! He is in no good way I doubt, spiritual or physical. After long talk, I incline to consider him <hi rend="italic">irremoveably</hi> fixed to the <foreign><hi rend="italic">Progr&#xE8;s</hi></foreign><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Progress of the species,&#x201D; TC&#x2019;s ironic phrase (see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370601-TC-RWE-01"><sic>9:220</sic><corr>TC to RWE, <date when="1837-06-01">1 June 1837</date></corr></ref>) for those, usually radicals, who believed in inevitable progress.</note> concern; a man destined to walk forever on paths that lead to little but confusion; and, all his days, with a pair of the keenest <hi rend="italic">eyes</hi>, to look thro facetted <hi rend="italic">spectacles</hi> disturbing in the sorrowfullest way all things in Heaven and Earth for him. Poor fellow!&#x2014; At Milnes&#x2019;s breakfast I found a set of lords and sprightly persons of quality, some of them with <hi rend="italic">Charles-First moustaches:</hi> altogether unproductive for me, or nearly altogether. One Macarthy (I think) proved to be the person who was here seeking me: a head hairdressed in the mode of <hi rend="italic">Christ</hi> in Italian Pictures, a tall, would-be lofty-thoughtful man, who &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">thinks</hi> he is thinking&#x201D;;&#x2014;of whom the world is hardly worthy!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Heb. 11:38. Charles Justin MacCarthy (<date when="1811-00-00">1811</date>&#x2013;<date when="1864-00-00">64</date>), one of Milnes&#x2019;s closest friends; they had met in Rome, <date when="1832-00-00">1832</date>, when MacCarthy was training for the priesthood; after he abandoned that and while he was &#x201C;wandering aimlessly about Europe&#x201D; (J. Pope Hennessy, <hi rend="italic">Monckton Milnes: the Years of Promise</hi> [London, <date when="1949-00-00">1949</date>] 45), Milnes found him a post as collector of customs, ca. <date when="1842-00-00">1842</date>. Going to Ceylon in <date when="1847-00-00">1847</date> as auditor gen., he became colonial sec., <date when="1851-00-00">1851</date>, and gov., <date when="1860-00-00">1860</date>&#x2013;<date when="1864-00-00">64</date>. He was knighted, <date when="1857-00-00">1857</date>.</note> A goodnatured man too; volunteered to visit me <pb id="pg-12-44" n="12:44"/>here, and work wonders: Heaven be good to him! Shortly after myself, the repast now all over, old Rogers came in. I care nothing for the old man, except as old, and kind to me; but he applied in such pathetic wise for my company to breakfast &#x201C;any day at any hour,&#x201D; that, after so many refusals, I could not but go. Yesterday, <hi rend="italic">breakfasting</hi> first at home, I went; thro&#x2019; mud, rain, and the tumult of Queen Victory&#x2019;s wedding: who should be there but poor Kenny<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Kenney (<date when="1780-00-00">1780</date>&#x2013;<date when="1849-00-00">1849</date>), Irish dramatist; see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18311113-TC-JAC-01"><sic>6:50</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1831-11-13">13 Nov. 1831</date></corr></ref>; known of old to TC, and an old friend and frequent visitor of Samuel Rogers.</note> alone! Kenny &#x201C;smoked&#x201D; a good deal, what you call smoking, was full of civility; both were full of civility; both full of <foreign>ennui</foreign>. And yet do but think I am engaged to go and dine there on Thursday; I felt astonished at myself all the way home how I had engaged: I have not sufficiently the art of saying No! And tonight we are in for Wilsondom;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jane and Thomas Wilson.</note>&#x2014;and a <hi rend="italic">dog</hi> in the rear-quarters of N<hi rend="italic">o</hi> 6. has been annoying us for some nights, and&#x2014;pity me, and hope I shall learn <hi rend="italic">No!</hi></p>
<p>Hunt&#x2019;s Play was what they call successful; it really seemed to me as if here and there the audience did feel it in their heart;&#x2014;as if the Play might run for some time, which is the grand result. The account in the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> is not favourable enough, written in a negatory spirit.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">The Legend of Florence</hi> had thirteen performances, <date when="1840-02-07">7 Feb.</date>&#x2013;<date when="1840-03-10">10 March</date>. The <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> review, <date when="1840-02-09">9 Feb.</date>, by Hunt&#x2019;s friend John Forster, was a mixture of admiration for Hunt personally and as a writer and doubts about the dramatic qualities of the play and the acting: &#x201C;but the play had thought, fancy, feeling, passion.&#x201D; In the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, <date when="1840-02-16">16 Feb.</date>, Forster referred to &#x201C;the familiar beauty of its language, the homely and deep truth of its feeling, the quick and passionate interchange of its dialogue.&#x201D; Hunt may have complained to Forster, since Macready noted, <date when="1840-02-16">16 Feb.</date>: &#x201C;Forster told me of Leigh Hunt&#x2019;s ingratitude to him, who had done everything for him for years; he is not a good man, nor a good-<hi rend="italic">natured</hi> man&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Diaries</hi>, ed. W. Toynbee, 2:45).</note> Heraud sat behind us in the Box; as dirty and joyful as ever. I have not seen Hunt since.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> as you will see with satisfaction contains farther an angry shot at <hi rend="italic">Chartism;</hi> revealing withal, what I did not know, that many persons &#x201C;shake their lank locks&#x201D; over the Condition-of-England Question! A certain unwise Mr Slaney actually brought forward a thing of the kind,&#x2014;as if he had taken me up literally and verbally!<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Macbeth</hi> 3.4. The <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, <date when="1840-02-09">9 Feb.</date>, wrote of &#x201C;The Newest Quackery&#x201D;: &#x201C;Beware how you talk to a certain sort of men of Corn Laws, Ballot, improvement of the Suffrage, Reform of the Law, Emigration, Education and such topics, they will look at you with supreme pity for your imperfect views, shake their heads, and the lank locks pendant from them, and with a smile of mingled compassion and contempt, tell you that there is but one question of questions, THE CONDITION-OF-ENGLAND QUESTION.&#x201D; It derided R. A. Slaney (<date when="1792-00-00">1792</date>&#x2013;<date when="1862-00-00">1862</date>), liberal M.P. for Shrewsbury, for proposing on <date when="1840-02-04">4 Feb.</date> that a select committee be appointed to inquire into the causes of the discontent among the working classes. After debate this motion and an amendment for an inquiry into the condition of the working classes were withdrawn without a vote. The <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> concluded that working class welfare &#x201C;should be the main study of the Government &#x2026; but we scoff at the quackery of deluding them with pompous names.&#x201D;</note> The world <pb id="pg-12-45" n="12:45"/>is not a wise world.&#x2014; Of course you will send the Examiner across into Annandale: I told my Mother so; <hi rend="italic">two strokes</hi> if you are well.</p>
<p>I have written more than I intended; it is worth nothing. I expect some news from you directly in return for my former Letter, which I think you would get on Saturday or so. We need not <hi rend="italic">overlap</hi> at so short a distance as we now happily have to contend with: nor do I mean to do that.</p>
<p>No word from John Sterling direct hither. &#x201C;Penzance,&#x201D; the old <foreign>Stimabile</foreign> still says.<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sterling was at Falmouth, but writing to his parents, <date when="1840-02-15">15 Feb.</date>, that he hoped to go to Penzance; he did not go until <date when="1841-00-00">spring, 1841</date> (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 11:199). On <date when="1840-02-08">8 Feb.</date>, he had called for the first time on Robert Barclay Fox (<date when="1817-00-00">1817</date>&#x2013;<date when="1855-00-00">55</date>), Quaker and businessman, on behalf of Harriet Mill, there with her son Henry (<ref target="volume-09/lt-18360724-TC-JWC-01"><sic>9:20</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1836-07-24">24 July 1836</date></corr></ref>), who was dying of consumption. Fox noted: &#x201C;Sterling is a person with whom you cannot converse 5 minutes without being struck by his vigorous intellect &#x26; fluency of expression.&#x201D; They spent the day together on <date when="1840-02-13">13 Feb.</date>, and on <date when="1840-02-15">15 Feb.</date>; Fox read Sterling&#x2019;s poems and &#x201C;an original &#x26; vigorous work on Chartism by Carlyle.&#x201D; The friendship grew. After the death of his wife (<date when="1843-04-00">April 1843</date>) Sterling was to propose marriage to Fox&#x2019;s sister Caroline; but, it is said, &#x201C;he was not sound in his beliefs so they could not marry&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Barclay Fox&#x2019;s Journal</hi>, ed. R. L. Brett [London, <date when="1979-00-00">1979</date>] 20, 178&#x2013;79).</note> If I knew <hi rend="italic">where</hi> he was, I would fling him a line some day. I wrote a word to Jenny at Kirtlebridge one day, the briefest of words, pity that one cannot make <hi rend="italic">time</hi> go farther, as money now will, in that matter.&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; My days still get dreadfully frittered away; hardly a little <hi rend="italic">reading</hi> to be snatched from the waste whirlpool; say nothing of writing or thinking. Ah me! But that will and shall alter.</p>

<salute>My dear Alick,</salute>
<p>Many thanks for your Letter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> which came to me a few minutes ago. Many thanks also for the <hi rend="italic">Tobacco</hi>, which I am right glad to hear you have got safely to hand. I have written this day to Alick Welsh<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In Liverpool.</note> asking what address I must have put upon it, that it may get into <hi rend="italic">his</hi> hands immediately; he will then, by railway, be able to let me have it in another day. So soon as he answers, I will write you notice: meanwhile have you the due <hi rend="italic">Permit</hi> &#x26;c all in order? If so you can wrap up the Tobacco in any solid way; and have it standing ready for being addressed and sent off. I suppose <hi rend="italic">grey paper</hi> in sufficient quantity be the readiest wrappage? I have often wished I had some kind of monstrous old <hi rend="italic">cannister</hi>, with a good tight lid, to keep the weed in here; it is so apt to get too dry otherwise. Do not forget the <hi rend="italic">Permit!</hi></p>
<p>Your news from Scotsbrig, from your own hearth, and from Gill are very welcome to us. I wish the sickness would leave your poor little ones altogether; you have had rather a bad winter that way. Jamie was to settle what cash would still be needed for the Gill business, once for all; and then it will be sent. I am very glad indeed to hear you talk so of the Farm; they will surely be much better in it than as they were. How is Hanning prospering at Kirtlebridge? I sent a line to Jenny;&#x2014;no answer yet.</p>
<p>This is the last news from Jack; probably identical with what our Mother has got for herself: I send it nevertheless. One can make little out from it. I dare say the situation is <hi rend="italic">wearisome;</hi> that is just the <hi rend="italic">labour</hi> attached to it. I could almost wish it might prove too wearisome, if that would drive our Doctor into settling somewhere! Till then, he will never feel himself so comfortable as he ought to be.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Your Letter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> has just come, along with a short Note from Alick at Ecclefechan, reporting that all goes tolerably well there. As the day has begun to rain at my projected hour of setting out, I may as well send you half a word,&#x2014;even by this scandalous Pen; and with my <hi rend="italic">Fire</hi> quite departed; and a set of people howling under my windows, uncertain with what object, for indeed I never heard such screeching and braying combined in one till now,&#x2014;like the melody of jackasses concerting with gigantic he-cats! By Heaven&#x2019;s blessing, they are passing on, a little; likely soon to withdraw.</p>
<p>A Letter of mine, besides the one you got, is probably arriving at Pellipar by this time. I will write to you as often as you like. I have a notion of devoting <hi rend="italic">one day in the week</hi> exclusively to answering Letters; the Penny-arrangement brings so many, it eats in upon one&#x2019;s morning not a little. Yet <hi rend="italic">a word</hi> any day is easily sent; and often well worth a penny! Along with your former Letter came this Note from Thomas Erskine, relative to the poor Paisley weaver.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Erskine&#x2019;s letter about William Bowie, <date when="1840-02-10">10 Feb.</date>; see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400123-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, [<date when="1840-01-23">23 Jan.</date>]</ref>.</note> I think you might like to read it: pray send it back, when you have a half-ounce that will take it in.&#x2014; Scott, I hear otherwise, is lecturing in that region to an audience of 1,000 operatives; admittance three-pence each.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Erskine&#x2019;s friend, the Rev. Alexander J. Scott. On <date when="1840-02-03">3 Feb.</date> he had begun a course of lectures, given on Mons. and Thurs., on the mutual relations of religion and philosophy, at the Relief Church, John St., Glasgow. It was 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the whole course, and was given at Woolwich in <date when="1840-00-00">summer 1840</date> and repeated elsewhere. It is said to have asserted the essential harmony of scientific and religious truth (J. P. Newell, &#x201C;A. J. Scott and His Circle&#x201D; [Ph.D. diss., Edinburgh Univ., <date when="1981-00-00">1981</date>] 244&#x2013;45).</note> <hi rend="italic">My</hi> City friend, of the lecture affair, sent me the result of his investigations last night; he has &#x2018;instituted committees,&#x2019; done this and that: <pb id="pg-12-48" n="12:48"/>Will I come and lecture at Aldersgate-Street<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified; see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400117-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, [<date when="1840-01-17">17 Jan.</date>]</ref>, and <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400123-TC-MAC-01">[<date when="1840-01-23">23 Jan.</date>]</ref>. The City of London Literary and Scientific Institution was at 165 Aldersgate St. For an earlier refusal, see <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380612-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1838-06-12">12 June 1838</date></ref>.</note> four times at 8 o&#x2019;clock p.m. for a sum of&#x2014;&#xa3;30 in all? Would that sum peradventure be sufficient to induce me? <foreign><hi rend="italic">Ach Gott!</hi></foreign> I answer today with many thanks.</p>
<p>This morning too I have written a word to Fraser, demanding with civility to <hi rend="italic">have</hi> a settlement. The man takes, of his own accord no steps whatever that way. What else is the use of <hi rend="italic">all</hi> his fiddling and fidgetting so far as I am interested? Besides the Gill Farmers will need cash soon; &#xa3;30, Jamie seemed to say: it may as well be sent soon as not soon. Alick, it appears, had lately been over with Jamie (of Scotsbrig) at Gill; he reports highly of the Farm; but says withal that their hay &#x26;c having turned out so ill, they will need to have cash. Our Mother was for the moment at Kirtlebridge; he says she is better this winter, he thinks, than she has been of late seasons.</p>
<p>I did attend Rogers&#x2019;s Dinner, as appointed. His Sister<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sarah Rogers (<date when="1772-00-00">1772</date>&#x2013;<date when="1855-00-00">1855</date>), close to her brother and apparently like him in some ways, as George Ticknor had described her, <date when="1838-06-03">3 June 1838</date>: &#x201C;We began the day with a breakfast at Miss Rogers&#x2019;s in her nice house on Regent&#x2019;s Park, which is a sort of imitation&#x2014;and not a bad one either&#x2014;of her brother&#x2019;s on St. James&#x2019;s &#x2026; she keeps autographs, curiosities, and objects of <foreign><hi rend="italic">virt&#xf9;</hi></foreign>, just like her brother. Best of all, she is kind and good humoured&#x201D; (P. W. Clayden, <hi rend="italic">Rogers and his Contemporaries</hi> [London, <date when="1889-00-00">1889</date>] 2:165).</note> was there; an ancient lady, considerably more in <foreign><hi rend="italic">embonpoint</hi></foreign>, and with less of wit than he. Of her came little. The dinner was in the first style of tasteful <hi rend="italic">classicality;</hi> the company too not bad. Kenny at the foot of the table really pleased me; a most courteous innocent man, whose whole demeanour breathed patience, good breeding, inoffensive sense. Milnes, <hi rend="italic">Heiland</hi> [Savior] Macarthy,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Kenney and Charles MacCarthy, &#x201C;Heiland [Savior]&#x201D; referring to his Christ-like hairstyle; see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400211-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1840-02-11">11 Feb.</date></ref></note> and Spedding formed the rest of the company. I decidedly liked Rogers a little better. His love of young people is itself a good sign. He defended the poor little Queen, and her fooleries and piques and pettings in this little wedding of hers; he defended Macaulay warmly, against Milnes&#x2019;s reports of Parliamentary failure:<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >T. B. Macaulay had been friendly with Rogers since <date when="1831-00-00">1831</date>. Currently M.P. for Edinburgh and sec. of war in the cabinet, he had made a long speech on <date when="1840-01-29">29 Jan.</date> during the debate on a motion of no confidence. Greville agreed with Milnes: &#x201C;Last night Macaulay failed. He delivered an essay, not without merit, but inapplicable. &#x2026; The Tories affected to treat his speech with contempt, and to talk and laugh.&#x201D; The government had defeated the motion by twenty-one votes. According to Greville, the Tories were &#x201C;full of bitter animosity, and an impatience for party victory&#x201D; (<date when="1840-01-30">30 Jan.</date>, <date when="1840-01-14">14 Jan.</date>, <hi rend="italic">Greville Memoirs</hi> 4:234, 224). They continued to attack the government and, in <date when="1840-02-00">early Feb.</date>, obtained a reduction in Albert&#x2019;s allowance and forced the postponement of the question of his precedence over the rest of the royal family.</note> his old eyes were full of melancholy, the old grey eyebrows <pb id="pg-12-49" n="12:49"/>so serenely sad and thoughtful; the old figure was so spare and clean and <hi rend="italic">separate</hi> (in all senses): I really almost liked the good old man. He is getting rather deaf, a sad circumstance  It may be said of him, with great emphasis, he <hi rend="italic">consumes his own smoke;</hi><note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18371219-TC-DLR-01"><sic>9:374</sic><corr>TC to DLR, <date when="1837-12-19">19 Dec. 1837</date></corr></ref>.</note> and I err greatly if he has not had a pretty volume of it to make away with, first and last! Poor old fellow, I declare I like him.</p>
<p>The Wilson dinner, the Rogers dinner, therefore, and all dinners are done. I have swallowed pills, set my wretched stomach in some order; wi<supplied>[ll]</supplied> keep out of their way while I can. &#x201C;What to lecture on?&#x201D; becomes rather a pressing question with me. I shall surely have my horse again before long. Probably that is the <hi rend="italic">beginning</hi> of all wisdom for me. I still puddle in the <hi rend="italic">Norse</hi> matters; with some fondness; not with much result hitherto.&#x2014; Do you get the Newspapers; do you send them on to Scotsbrig?</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">This</hi> Letter of yours is marked <hi rend="italic">paid at Derry;</hi> the other came unpaid. Complaints become audible of unpunctuality here and there. The body Cole told me the stamps would be ready in &#x201C;three weeks.&#x201D;<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >They were not ready until <date when="1840-05-00">early in May</date>.</note></p>
<p>The other day I came upon Arthur Buller on the streets, who went along with me for an hour or more. <hi rend="italic">He</hi> is doing nothing; Charles is asking <hi rend="italic">What</hi> to to [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] do,&#x2014;writing a little in the Colonial Gazette (if that is the name of it); <hi rend="italic">agent</hi>ing for the Australian people; waiting upon Providence! Some say Durham is to come into the Cabinet, Melbourne going out; in which case Buller might have a chance.<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charles Buller did not gain office until his appointment as sec. to the board of control, <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>, in the last months of Melbourne&#x2019;s Whig government; see <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390526-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1839-05-26">26 May 1839</date></ref>. There was no question of Durham&#x2019;s return to politics; he d. <date when="1840-07-28">28 July</date>. The <hi rend="italic">Colonial Gazette</hi>, pbd. in connection with the Colonial Society, had begun <date when="1838-12-00">Dec. 1838</date>. Buller was presumably still connected with the South Australia Association (see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350112-TC-JAC-01"><sic>8:10</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1835-01-12">12 Jan. 1835</date></corr></ref>).</note> Of Mill I have seen or heard nothing,&#x2014;except indeed heard that he was worse in health. His brother had been obliged to go to Madeira since you went.<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mrs. Mill, Clara, and Henry had missed the boat to Madeira, <date when="1840-02-00">early in Feb.</date>, and were to stay in Falmouth until Henry d., <date when="1840-04-04">4 April</date>. Mill was negotiating the sale of the <hi rend="italic">London and Westminster Review</hi> to Cole and William Hickson. From <date when="1840-03-16">16 March</date> to <date when="1840-04-10">10 April</date>, he joined his family in Falmouth, when he spent time with Sterling and became friendly with the Fox family (see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400211-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1840-02-11">11 Feb.</date></ref>).</note></p>
<p>The Booths<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably James Booth (see <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390526-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1839-05-26">26 May 1839</date></ref>) and Jane Booth, b.

This is probably the invitation that Mazzini irritably described to his mother, <date when="1840-02-12">12 Feb.</date>: &#x201C;Even the best people &#x2026; thinking they are being kind, cause me annoyance. For example Carlyle invites me to dine. He is a good man. His wife is good. The three of us dine together without ceremony. That&#x2019;s fine, but then &#x2026; he invites me for Monday&#x201D; to meet &#x201C;some unknown with his wife who live near me and that I should therefore get to know them&#x201D; (trans., <hi rend="italic">Scritti di Mazzini</hi> 18:367).</note> (we met them that day in the <pb id="pg-12-50" n="12:50"/>Crabbe-Robinson Region)<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Crabb Robinson lived at 30 Russell Sq.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Alick Welsh&#x2019;s answer, about his address for the Tobacco, is come this morning. Their office, he says, is within not many yards of the place where the Steamers moor: he will with all readiness take charge of the Tobacco, and forward it straightway by the railroad.</p>
<p>Will you therefore get the thing despatched to Annan, with due <hi rend="italic">Permit</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">address</hi> (which I will give here) as soon as possible. As I have no means of <hi rend="italic">paying</hi> Alick Welsh, I wish also you would pay it to Liverpool. I suppose a piece of <hi rend="italic">white paper</hi> well wafered upon the gray, will be the best way of giving the address: the parcel will require a new address when despatched from Liverpool. I write you an address, and inclose it here:&#x2014;unless you have some better way of managing it? As this Note will come on Wednesday, perhaps you will have a chance to get the thing sent off without delay on Thursday! Failing Thursday there is no such <hi rend="italic">dreadful</hi> hurry; I think I can hold out yet two weeks good, or even more.&#x2014; On the whole, my dear Brother, I will leave the matter with you; not doubting but you will manage it right kindly and well. I shall owe you many thanks when we settle accounts,&#x2014;at our next meeting! Ah me!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Jane is gone out today, in a sort of half-desperate determination, fog tho&#x2019; it be; she <hi rend="italic">will</hi> not stay prisoner of Mud Rain and Fog any more! This is the wettest spring hitherto I ever saw here; a very ugly spring indeed. Queen Victory has got her bit wedding over; the people <pb id="pg-12-51" n="12:51"/>are all accusing her, poor little dear, how she has quarrelled with her mother, openly insulted her; how she has done this and that!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Victoria had apparently kissed Adelaide, the Queen Dowager, immediately after the ceremony, but only shaken her mother&#x2019;s hand. The <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, <date when="1840-02-11">11 Feb.</date>, noted that the Duchess of Kent was loudly cheered as she returned to Buckingham Palace after the wedding ceremony. See also <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390415-TC-JAC-01">TC and JAC, [<date when="1839-04-15">15 April 1839</date>]</ref>.</note> I am heartily sorry for her, poor little fool; but for the poor little fool&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Twenty Millions of people</hi> I am infinitely sorrier. Bad days are coming, as I often <foreign><hi rend="italic">spae</hi></foreign> [foretell].</p>
<p>I wrote to the Doctor on Saturday; for indeed directly after finishing your Note, it began to rain, and I could not get out. I send him the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> today; does <hi rend="italic">he</hi> send it forward to Scotsbrig, it and the <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi>.</p>
<p>These three nights I have had three longer sleeps than have been allotted me together these six months: great <hi rend="italic">stupidity</hi>, a sort of fixed icy sadness, has been the immediate result; but it will undoubtedly do me good. Where is our good Mother now? Was she staying with Jenny for a day or two? Thank Heaven for the news you send me about her health.</p>
<p>We have nearly 2 volumes of printing done; there are still 3 to do. I wish often enough it were done! Not that it is great <hi rend="italic">work</hi>,&#x2014;far from it; but it keeps me in a kind of continual <foreign><hi rend="italic">puddle</hi></foreign> [petty but hard work].&#x2014;<closer><salute>Good b&#x2019;ye dear Brother!&#x2014; Your affectionate</salute></closer></p>

The new vol. was <hi rend="italic">Cromwell and the Republicans</hi>.</note> You will find in the four volumes which I return no marks of reprobation that I remember; tho&#x2019; the whole was read by me with unusual attention,&#x2014;attention, however, rather of a learner than of a critic.&#x2014;The <hi rend="italic">style</hi> of the volume I carried with me yesterday seems altered a little? Altered and improved! It is right that a man learn and <hi rend="italic">grow</hi>; the meaning of his being alive is that he grow. But why do you make poor Noll such a Knave? I cannot believe him to have been at bottom dishonest, or <pb id="pg-12-52" n="12:52"/><hi rend="italic">false</hi> at all. Poor fellow, he was swimming as in a dim sea of wrecks and troubles: difficult to make good work there!&#x2014; I mean to read the whole Book over again, with new watchfulness.</p>
<p>And now for Saturday: do not by any means forget to come! I send you Spedding&#x2019;s Letter; a melancholy emblem of the state our poor scheme lies in at present,&#x2014;till you and your party cry heartily, <foreign><hi rend="italic">Manos a l&#x2019;obra</hi></foreign> [Hands to the plow]!

<p>If you have not a copy of the Prospectus, Spedding will send you one.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Forster had already been sent copies of Spedding&#x2019;s library prospectus; see <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390117-TC-JF-01">TC to JF, <date when="1839-01-17">17 Jan. 1839</date></ref>. &#x201C;Spedding&#x2019;s Letter&#x201D; was presumably that of <date when="1840-02-17">17 Feb.</date> in which he had refused to lead the campaign for the London Library and suggested Talfourd or Forster as possibilities.</note></p>

<p><salute>Dear Forster,&#x2014;</salute>I am desirous enough to come; but various Daemonic Agencies (the Apothecary among others!) have me by the throat at this moment; it were rash to promise in these circumstances!

<p>Your Prospectus is very ingenious;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably Forster had written a new prospectus to replace Spedding&#x2019;s of the previous year.

<p>Some Books come,&#x2014;a small instalment of an immense debt, which I mea<supplied>[n]</supplied> daily to pay, for indeed the sight of it afflicts me daily. Dare we <hi rend="italic">speak</hi> about your Prospectus tomorrow?&#x2014; <closer><salute>In haste</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Tho&#x2019; there is nothing new going on here, I will write you a word even to say nothing, except that I am specially thinking of you. I have written a Letter to Jean<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> at Dumfries with all the tidings I could be said to have; this she will perhaps send out to you,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; indeed it is not worth even that trouble: it contained at bottom nothing except that all things move along in their old course; proof-sheets &#x26;c, &#x26;c; and that, in spite of the fierce weather, both the wife and I are holding out in the usual state of health.</p>
<p>This is the season when the Town grows more than usually full; many thousands of Quality and their dependents crowding into this western quarter of it: one would think I had not much to do with all that; yet it does introduce a considerable agitation into our little quiet district too; and, strive against it as I will, interrupts me far more than I like. They ask me to dinner; I refuse and refuse; then not to cause absolute offence I consent, and the consequence is, a dinner somewhere between <hi rend="italic">six and nine o&#x2019;clock at night</hi>, and confused ferment of nervous discomfort for a week after! It requires a much thicker skin than I have, to stand that sort of thing. It is rather amusing: one sees the ways of these people; &#x201C;how they <hi rend="italic">ac</hi> in the various parts&#x201D;:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A regular comment of Mrs. Jeffrey&#x2019;s maid; see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18321010-JWC-EA-01"><sic>6:234M</sic><corr>JWC to EA, <date when="1832-10-10">10 Oct. 1832</date></corr></ref>.</note> the &#x201C;lions&#x201D; of the time (those whom the world runs after, to see, as if they were <hi rend="italic">lions</hi> in a show) all turn up here or there,&#x2014;individuals worth a look, and generally worth little more. I saw very lately the <hi rend="italic">chief</hi> literary lion of this generation, a certain Sir Lytton Bulwer, for example; he makes by far the most money of his books, has the most popularity &#x26;c of all living book-writers, and is pretty generally by men of sense admitted to be a very silly fellow and <hi rend="italic">bad</hi> bookwriter notwithstanding: a rather discordant state of matters for him! He is a miserable goggle-eyed scarecrow to look upon, tho&#x2019; dressed in the extremest style of dandyism; an uneasy incoherent-looking man:&#x2014;poor fellow, he has parted with his wife, who is writing books against him;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lady Rosina Bulwer; see <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390415-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, [<date when="1839-04-15">15 April 1839</date>]</ref>. In the pref. to her second novel, <hi rend="italic">The Budget of the Bubble Family</hi>, 3 vols. (London, <date when="1840-00-00">1840</date>), she wrote: &#x201C;Their characters will be thought overdrawn &#x2026; every one of their sayings, doings, seeings, and adventures, are subdued far under the original. &#x2026; For the abuse heaped upon my last book [<hi rend="italic">Cheveley</hi>] I return my sincere thanks, as it came from those whose praise is a blot, whose support is a degradation&#x201D; (dated <date when="1840-07-00">July</date>; pp. ix&#x2013;x).</note> he hopes he is a great character, <pb id="pg-12-54" n="12:54"/>and yet dreads always that men may take him for what he is, a small one: one fancies it no desirable existence that!&#x2014; For my own share, I confess, there is no <hi rend="italic">lionism</hi> nor looking at lions, nor late dining, nor trade of that kind at all, that suits me tenth-part as well as being left alone to try whether I can do any <hi rend="italic">work</hi> or not. At bottom, I find, that is <hi rend="italic">all</hi> this world can do for me. If I can do any work, it is a happiness to me; if I can do <hi rend="italic">no</hi> work, all is an insignificance, an <hi rend="italic">un</hi>happiness, and I had better be asleep than awake in such a world.</p>
<p>We have not Miss Martineau this winter: did I ever tell you she had gone to Newcastle to be under the care of a Brother-in-law who is a Doctor there? She writes to Jane sometimes; pretends to be &#x201C;very happy,&#x201D; poor Harriet; but cannot be <hi rend="italic">happy</hi>, having some grievous disorder about her, for which I believe a surgical operation will be needed.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-11/lt-18391208-TC-RWE-01">TC to RWE, <date when="1839-12-08">8 Dec. 1839</date></ref>. Harriet Martineau wrote to Fanny Wedgwood, <date when="1840-03-08">8 March</date>, that Erasmus Darwin had sent Mazzini&#x2019;s review of TC: &#x201C;It delighted us, and I have told Mrs. Carlyle, who quizzed it to me, that she won&#x2019;t get me to laugh at it. I <hi rend="italic">should</hi> like to know what you think of her. She is most kind to me, and I honour her on some accounts, but her scepticism is, with me, a bar to all confidence. Her inaccuracy is mischievous; but that might be mended. I grieve more over the scepticism she <hi rend="italic">strives to manifest</hi>, while I fully believe that there is some sound faith at the bottom of her soul. She could not have sustained herself and him all this time without it. I am glad she considered my note &#x2018;a long letter.&#x2019; I shall feel more easy under my poor replies to her very kind and entertaining letters&#x201D; (MS: Wedgwood Papers, Univ. of Keele; pbd: E. S. Arbuckle, ed. <hi rend="italic">Harriet Martineau&#x2019;s Letters</hi> &#x2026; 31&#x2013;32).</note>&#x2014; Mrs Buller too is removed out of town; lives now at a place called Leatherhead some sixteen miles off; in disgust, I believe, at the course of politics, which has not brought her son Charles into any office! She got another offence: about a year and half ago she thought good to &#x201C;adopt&#x201D; a young female child, of whose parentage she either gave no account, or else admitted in all privacy that it was an <hi rend="italic">irregular production of her son Arthur&#x2019;s!</hi><note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Theresa (&#x201C;Tizzy&#x201D;) Revis (b. <date when="1832-00-00">1832</date>). JWC described her at age nineteen, in a letter to John Welsh, <date when="1851-01-07">7 Jan. 1851</date>, as the original of Blanche Amory in <hi rend="italic">Pendennis:</hi> &#x201C;Not that the poor little &#x2018;Tizzy&#x2019; &#x2026; is <hi rend="italic">quite</hi> such a little devil as Thackeray who has detested her from a child has here represented,&#x201D; and as &#x201C;the only <hi rend="italic">legitimate</hi> child of a beautiful young &#x2018;improper female&#x2019; who was for a number of years Arthur Bullers mistress&#x201D; (MS: NLS 604.343). Thackeray had met her mother, also Theresa, at the Bullers&#x2019; in <date when="1832-06-00">June 1832</date>: &#x201C;a very pretty disagreeable girl.&#x201D; He had just visited Mrs. Buller at her &#x201C;charming place&#x201D; at Leatherhead: &#x201C;and that little girl whom she has adopted so strangely. &#x2026; It was really melancholy to see the airs and selfishness of the child&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Letters and Private Papers of W. M. Thackeray</hi>, ed. G. N. Ray [London, <date when="1945-00-00">1945</date>] 1:207, 413). Anne Ritchie wrote of her in <date when="1889-00-00">1889</date> as &#x201C;still alive,&#x201D; and the original of Becky Sharp, &#x201C;now no less a person than the Countess de la Torre&#x201D; (ed. Hester Ritchie, <hi rend="italic">Letters of Anne Thackeray Ritchie</hi> [London, <date when="1924-00-00">1924</date>] 208).</note> This proved a little too strong; and most of her lady-friends began to look shy upon her; a thing that made <pb id="pg-12-55" n="12:55"/>the country still more desirable. I used to see the little <foreign>snaffle</foreign> [weakling] of a child; but, suspecting what it was, never would take any notice of it, or so much as understand that it was running about and making a noise there. To me the Bullers were always kind and good; that is what I am bound to feel, in respect of her especially. I think, if I had my horse again, of riding out to see them some time. It is considered not to be impossible, after all, that Charles may get into some place before long. Arthur, whom I saw about a week ago, is talking about going out to New Zealand (near New Holland, nearly on the other side of the world), along with a Colony they are trying to establish there.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In <date when="1840-10-00">Oct.</date>, he was appointed Queen&#x2019;s advocate in Ceylon, serving till <date when="1848-07-00">July 1848</date>, when he was made a judge of Supreme Court, Calcutta, <date when="1848-00-00">1848</date>&#x2013;<date when="1858-00-00">58</date>; M.P. for Devonport, <date when="1859-00-00">1859</date>&#x2013;<date when="1865-00-00">65</date>, and Liskeard, <date when="1865-00-00">1865</date>&#x2013;<date when="1869-00-00">69</date>. In <date when="1843-00-00">1843</date> he m. Anne Henrietta Maria Templar (d. <date when="1907-00-00">1907</date>).</note>&#x2014; Enough of all this.</p>
<p>I enclose you our last Missive from the Doctor. All seems to be well with him, tho&#x2019; nothing yet settled: it is impossible to get hitherto any very distinct notion of <hi rend="italic">what</hi> he does, or how he is situated from such letters as he writes. The truth is, we may infer, he does not well know about it himself.</p>
<p>I think I shall lecture this year too, to my old audience! I seem to have a kind of hold of a <hi rend="italic">subject;</hi> but it is not yet got into any shape. I am considerably plagued with Proofsheets; but we are half thro&#x2019; the whole thing now, and shall see the end of it, I hope, in another month or little more. In the course of this week I expect to <hi rend="italic">settle</hi> with Fraser; we shall then see what <hi rend="italic">he</hi> has got to give us.&#x2014; Pray let Jamie remember to write me about the Austin&#x2019;s money; it shall be sent when wanted.</p>
<p>Dear Mother, did you ever read from me a greater Nothing? I am at the bottom of my sheet too: ah me! Do, I entreat you, take care of yourself in this fierce frosty weather. Tell me again how you are; I like your Letters well. Jenny wrote to me, a bit <foreign><hi rend="italic">canty</hi></foreign> [a little cheerful] Letter,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> for which I request you in the meanwhile to thank her; I will answer by and by. How is the little Tom down stairs? Alick, I suppose, is about sending me off my Tobacco. The Pipes arrived last week; alas, all smashed to a few! I have written by Dumfries to the Potters about them. Farewell, my dear Mother. I must write to you soon again. <closer><salute>Ever Your</salute></closer></p>
<name>T. Carlyle</name>
<ps><p>I enclose you also the last private criticism on <hi rend="italic">Chartism</hi>. It is by the <pb id="pg-12-56" n="12:56"/>Mr Spedding who once with his brother came to seek me at Scotsbrig: a letter from the one brother to the other, who shewed it me.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The criticism was by Thomas Story Spedding, sent to James Spedding.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>In answer to your hurried Coleraine Letter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Enclosed with <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400224-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1840-02-24">24 Feb.</date></ref>; John had passed through Coleraine, ca. twenty-four mi. NE of Pellipar, on a trip to see the Giant&#x2019;s Causeway.</note> I must send you a little word today; tho&#x2019; there is nothing very special astir, and I have been belated with what little work I had in view. Some mischievous urchin flung an oystershell thro&#x2019; one of these windows the night before last; I had become impatient to get it mended, and the Glazier came, just as I was sitting down to my Proofsheets, <foreign><hi rend="italic">gerade zur unrechten Zeit</hi></foreign> [just at the wrong time]! After fretting about, and starving [freezing] me with east-wind for the due space, he has at length departed, and my Proofs are finished too.</p>
<p>You have not made up any resolution for yourself; and cannot of course write anything clearly to another as yet. I can give you no advice; can advise only that you use your best discretion and reflexion; and wish and hope for you a true issue. Tell me at any rate whether you get the Newspapers; whether you want them to be still sent. I can form no notion of your environment, your hours, employments, way of spending the day. Your next Letter will perhaps contain something more decisive in regard to your purposes; if you determine on continuing, we shall gradually learn all things, as composure gradually comes upon you, if you do not say, we shall hope to learn otherwise before long. Again and again I wish you a happy outcome, a resolution that will prove wise and advantageous.</p>
<p>My Printers proceed with tolerable velocity; above a half is now fairly done. Four or five weeks more, and I shall be out of that dirty vortex; a real deliverance for me. Fraser wrote on Saturday last that he hoped to have the Accounts and Papers all sorted for me on Monday; I could then examine them, and the settlement should be on what day I liked to come. This is Wednesday; but no Papers have yet arrived.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >They arrived later this day; see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400228-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1840-02-28">28 Feb.</date></ref></note> I have kept aloof from him since the first date of my demand; I find it better to rest so till the demand be complied with.&#x2014; In the next <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine</hi> there is to be an article by Thackeray on the <hi rend="italic">Story of the Vengeur:</hi> do you see it at Pellipar?</p>
<p>We had such sharp frosty weather, with cutting venomous east-winds, as is enough of itself to make one sickly. Swift walking, with great-coat close-buttoned, is one&#x2019;s only recipe. Jane hardly ventures <pb id="pg-12-58" n="12:58"/>out at all; tried it on Sunday, amid the sunshine, but very nearly caught a cold. I again, as formerly, cook coffee in the mornings; fully as well to be &#x201C;in a place by myself&#x201D; till I have got that operation over! I think I must have back my Horse soon; I shall not get into any right heart till then.&#x2014; The Macreadys sent us the ticket of their box at Covent-Garden the other night; we two took Mazzini and the Jew,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified. They went on <date when="1840-02-21">21 Feb.</date> to Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, not Covent Garden.</note> and saw <hi rend="italic">Mary Stewart</hi>, a <hi rend="italic">rant</hi> they call by that name, enact itself,&#x2014;rather strikingly, so far as Macready was concerned.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Mary Stuart</hi>, by James Haynes (<date when="1788-00-00">1788</date>&#x2013;<date when="1851-00-00">1851</date>), had opened on <date when="1840-01-22">22 Jan.</date> It ran for twenty performances. Mazzini thought the play had beautiful passages but that of the actors only Macready was really good (<hi rend="italic">Scritti di Mazzini</hi> 19:9&#x2013;10).</note> The lady Macready was to have come and &#x201C;spent the day&#x201D; here yesterday, her husband to fetch her in the evening; a thing I looked forward to, in my then mood, with real horror: however, there had fallen out some sickness in their house, and there came a shoulderknot to say in the afternoon that &#x201C;unhappily it was impossible&#x201D;! I spent the evening, in grateful silence; reading two extremely bad tragedies of Landor&#x2019;s: <hi rend="italic">Giovanna of Naples</hi> and another;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably <hi rend="italic">Andrea of Hungary;</hi> both pbd. in London, <date when="1839-00-00">1839</date>.</note> all cracked to tatters by a barren bitterly spasmodic spirit of exaggeration and perversion; <hi rend="italic">calcined</hi>, in no kindly fire, into mere cinders and incoherency; among the worst writings I have ever seen by any man of talent.&#x2014; Hunt&#x2019;s Play still goes on; but I hear whispers that it will not altogether <hi rend="italic">last</hi>.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Your Letter, inclosing my Mother&#x2019;s,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alick&#x2019;s letter not found. Mrs. Carlyle&#x2019;s sent to John; see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400229-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, [<date when="1840-02-29">29 Feb.</date>]</ref>.</note> came yesterday; I was heartily glad to see my dear Mother&#x2019;s hand again;&#x2014;pray tell her this, and that she must not let me want for Letters now that they are so cheap. I get few Letters better worth reading than hers. It is one of my chief reasons of thankfulness in this world that I had such a Mother!&#x2014; I think she would receive a Letter from me with one of Jack&#x2019;s wrapt in it, about the same time. It contained nothing at all, either Jack&#x2019;s or mine; from him there are yet no farther news. Her Letter from him, indeed, seemed to be later than mine; and to indicate that they had <hi rend="italic">returned</hi> from the Giant&#x2019;s Causeway,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Rock formation on the coast, ca. thirty-five mi. NE of Pellipar House.</note> and found it not to agree very well with them. We shall hear probably before long what comes of that business: Jack is not likely to be content anywhere till he get himself <hi rend="italic">settled</hi> and see a roof of his own over his head in some manner or other. Perhaps one ought to wish that his present and all such situations might prove so <hi rend="italic">un</hi>comfortable to him that he were <hi rend="italic">obliged</hi> to set about getting some permanent arrangement made.</p>
<p>You are very kind and punctual, my dear Brother; many thanks to you for the trouble you take with me. The news of the Potatoes would have been hailed with great joy only a week before; for we have been somewhat annoyed all winter with <hi rend="italic">bad</hi> London Potatoes: but it so happened, Elizabeth Fergus (Elizabeth <hi rend="italic">Countess Pepoli</hi> that now is) sent <pb id="pg-12-61" n="12:61"/>us down a basket of Fife potatoes out of a barrel they had just received from Kirkcaldy; and these proved so excellent that we forthwith commissioned a competent stock for ourselves; and we have just learned that these are now shipped for us at Edinburgh, for which ship-cargo we accordingly wait, living in the meanwhile on borrowed Pepoli potatoes, which we mean to pay when our own come. So that the Annandale roots, which are probably of a similar quality, cannot come into play this year! Another year if I live, I will actually take order for Scotch potatoes at the very starting; the kind they sell here (unless you know <hi rend="italic">where</hi> to go and buy Perth or Fife potatoes, which <hi rend="italic">are</hi> for sale too, if one knew where!) are positively offensive to me. The Newcastle Steamer, I learned yesterday, does sail; but we need not meddle with it this season. Great delays take place always about the wharfs and custom houses: nay, I find, the railway people, in some kind of thing they call &#x201C;the waggon-train,&#x201D; undertake to carry goods too at &#x201C;six shillings the hundredweight.&#x201D; That is far the shorter and preferable method. Especially as we have Alick Welsh to guard against delays at Liverpool.</p>
<p>The Potatoes being out of the fight, we come to the munificent prospect of the Bacon-flitch! Jane says the bacon here is 9&#xBD;<hi rend="italic">d</hi> per pound, sometimes good, sometimes indifferent. The prospect of a good bacon-flitch, she declares, is highly agreeable; if you judge, by the price there and here, and the other circumstances, that it can be conveniently stuck into a Box along with the Tobacco, and sent hither, then surely send it;&#x2014;use your own consideration and insight. As for the Ham my dear Mother has got us, I incline greatly to think she will get <hi rend="italic">more good of it herself</hi>, and that she ought to suspend it at Scotsbrig, and <hi rend="italic">cut</hi> frequently from it! Nothing can satisfy us here with <hi rend="italic">fatness</hi> in hams; and you Annandale people, I think, like the <hi rend="italic">lean</hi> principally. This is all I can specify about the bacon or other victual proviant. As for the Tobacco, so soon as a Permit is got, let it be sent at any rate; if with the flitch then in a <hi rend="italic">box;</hi> if by itself, paper I suppose will do: but in either case, Liverpool and A. Welsh is the course for it,&#x2014;according to the directions sent last time. Pray do not neglect <hi rend="italic">the Permit;</hi> lest the harpies sieze [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] upon the whole and confiscate it!&#x2014; What trouble and troubles you have with me; never-ending, still beginning!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Dryden, &#x201C;Alexander&#x2019;s Feast&#x201D; 101.</note></p>
<p>The Pipes, as I mentioned in my Mother&#x2019;s Letter, were all broken but a mere fraction; sorrow take them! Even this fraction is mainly spoiled; choked up with sawdust, so that no <hi rend="italic">wire</hi> will clear them. I shall struggle on for a good many weeks with them (some seven weeks, I think), and then if the Glasgow blockheads will not attempt to partially <pb id="pg-12-62" n="12:62"/>make good their blockheadism, I will send to Edinburgh. What cares the sublimest philosopher, amid all his philosophies, is still bound to, while on this earth!</p>
<p>Yesternight, after considerable urging, I got Fraser&#x2019;s Account: three enormous expanses of Paper, full of items, strokes, crotchets, Debtors and Creditors;&#x2014;the immediately tangible result of which seems to be that he considers himself as at present owing me little more than &#xa3;200, at least &#xa3;50 lower than I had calculated! He or his, the miserable mortal, has got over his counter above &#xa3;450 of money for <hi rend="italic">selling</hi> my <hi rend="italic">Miscellanies;</hi> and <hi rend="italic">above</hi> half of the whole it seems is due to the sellers! However, I see several palpable blunders; I will consult an experienced friend here;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >G. L. Craik.</note> I determine on seeing the matter to the bottom, now that I am in for it, and will <hi rend="italic">till</hi> then keep as quiet as a lamb! I expect to do <hi rend="italic">some</hi> good, but not much; I shall see at least that I get fair <hi rend="italic">use and wont</hi> in that most distracted of all distracted trades. On the whole I reflect that I ought to be thankful even for this: putting one thing with another, is it not a kind of blessed miracle that one finds himself still allowed to live, and to have the prospect of living&#x2014;out of the workhouse or jail.&#x2014; The <hi rend="italic">new</hi> F. Rev<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, Meister, Chartism are not <hi rend="italic">included</hi> in this same settlement, I ought to say. Poor Fraser! Poor Booksellers all! For grasp as they like, and take as they do above a half for mere <hi rend="italic">selling</hi>, are they not all at the verge of <hi rend="italic">bankruptcy;</hi> not one in ten of them able to exist? I will accept their &#x201C;Common rate,&#x201D; since it is established: &#x201C;a common rate,&#x201D; as good old Peden said, &#x201C;is a common rule.&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">The Life and Prophecies of Mr. Alexander Peden</hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1776-00-00">1776</date>) 12 (section 19).

<p>There has arisen farther, in these days, new question of the <hi rend="italic">Library</hi> you heard speak about last year. I think it will perhaps go on now. I could wish I had nothing to do in it; but it will not float off without me. I fancy we shall have a public meeting in a week or two.</p>
<p>The Proofsheets go on; above half-done now. My Lectures get <supplied>[sa]</supplied>dly elbowed into the corner by all these claims on me; I must positively fasten on them.&#x2014; I will have my horse back too. I will also go out to no more <hi rend="italic">eight o&#x2019;clock dinners</hi>, except on double and treble compulsion! It is now the fifth or sixth day since that last, and I am still suffering from it. Why not say, <hi rend="italic">No</hi> one time for <hi rend="italic">all</hi> times!</p>
<p>You would get the <hi rend="italic">Glasgow Argus</hi> with the Criticism in it?<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <hi rend="italic">Chartism,</hi> <date when="1840-02-24">24 Feb.</date>; a favorable review, ending: &#x201C;Let all men, therefore, read and study Thomas Carlyle on Chartism.&#x201D;</note> It came along with your Letter yesterday; and I despatched it to you, not being <pb id="pg-12-63" n="12:63"/>able to write till I had made inquiries at the railway office, and considered myself.</p>
<p>I rejoice to hear your house and little Doil<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alick&#x2019;s son John Aitken Carlyle, given the same nickname as his uncle by TC.</note> too are recovering again, all but well now. I wish Jamie&#x2019;s little Tom were well again! Tell Jamie <supplied>[to]</supplied> instruct me about Austin&#x2019;s money.&#x2014; <foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Brother. Jane (very <supplied>[qu]</supplied>iet not otherwise ailing) salutes you all. God keep you! <closer><salute>Your affectionate</salute></closer></p>

<p>Your Giant&#x2019;s Causeway Letter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> has just come; one of mine that I had sent in the interim most probably was not got to hand when you wrote. I meant at any rate to send you today this good little Note which came from my Mother two days ago, which I have read with real pleasure. <foreign><hi rend="italic">A fortiori</hi></foreign> [more definitely] I will send it now that yours has come.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC has written at the end of his mother&#x2019;s letter, &#x201C;Do not lose this: send it back to me; along with Erskine&#x2019;s Note?&#x201D;</note></p>

You will see that they <hi rend="italic">are</hi> sent, if the Examiner have only <hi rend="italic">one</hi> stroke: take that as a token.&#x2014; I hope your <hi rend="italic">Campagne</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John was translating Goethe&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Campagne in Frankreich</hi>, pt. 5 of <hi rend="italic">Aus Meinem Leben</hi> (T&#xfc;bingen and Stuttgart, <date when="1822-00-00">1822</date>).

<p>Fraser has sent me his Account: &#xa3;239 for net proceeds of the <hi rend="italic">Miscellanies;</hi> which, by various additional expences, about the American F.R<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, he rasps down to &#xa3;217&#x201D;10&#x201D;3&#xBD;. Is not that a princely return out of our 500 guineas? But it is according to rule, Craik says; all but a few inaccuracies, which I will correct and perhaps make a pound or two of. I will not fling my patience after my vanished cash. Poor James is not dishonest. His &#xa3;217 too is not <hi rend="italic">ready</hi>-cash; it is <hi rend="italic">bill of ten months:</hi> <pb id="pg-12-64" n="12:64"/>but this too, Craik tells me, is according to rule. I will reconcile myself. The other Books are doing very tolerably; 300 F.R<hi rend="italic">n&#x2019;s</hi> sold &#x26;c: there will be something to divide on them too by and by.</p>
<p>Our Library is to get under way here; occupies far more of my time than I like.

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Here is a Letter come from John; containing nothing whatever I suppose that you do not know; which however I send, as worth a penny. Your good little Letter pleased us very greatly. Thanks, many thanks for it! And send another of the like, with your earliest convenience. A Letter from me, I think, would reach <hi rend="italic">you</hi> about the same time. I wrote to Alick yesterday. This is but a word <hi rend="italic">over and above</hi> that I send today.</p>
<p>My eight-o&#x2019;clock dinner is all gone now; I feel well again today; better than I have done for ten days. Fraser&#x2019;s Account <supplied>[is pronoun]</supplied>ced to be nearly accurate by Craik, the &#x201C;experienced friend&#x201D; I consulted about it. The Book-<hi rend="italic">trade</hi> is to blame; not poor Fraser, who gains only his share by it, and is I do believe a very punctual creature, honest in his way. I will screw him up a few pounds yet, and then settle for the <pb id="pg-12-65" n="12:65"/><hi rend="italic">Miscellanies</hi>. My other Books all go on well; there will be something from <hi rend="italic">them</hi> too next year.</p>
<p>It will be a great comfort to you to have a Minister<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Tait (<date when="1811-00-00">1811</date>&#x2013;<date when="1867-00-00">67</date>) from Fala was ordained on a unanimous call, <date when="1840-06-23">23 June</date>; Mrs. Carlyle had said: &#x201C;there is a call to be moderate on wednesday first. I think it will be given to a Mr Tait with concert of all the members.&#x201D; He remained until his death.</note> once more. I sincerely pray he may prove a good man that you fix upon. The want of regular &#x201C;assembling of yourselves together&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Heb. 10:25.</note> is a great want for all reasonable persons.&#x2014;&#x2014; Jane is just gone out; the weather having softened a little, and the sun at least being bright. We have nothing but east-winds; today it has shifted a point to the south of east&#x2014; I wish poor little Tom would get back the use of his leg! I suppose &#x201C;weakness&#x201D; to be ailment enough for the like of him in that situation.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James and Isabella had taken &#x201C;little Tom&#x201D; to Dr. Thom (<ref target="volume-05/lt-18300211-TC-JAC-01"><sic>5:74</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1830-02-11">11 Feb. 1830</date></corr></ref>) in Annan, who said &#x201C;the child ails nothing but weakness.&#x201D;</note> His Mother will of course do all <hi rend="italic">she</hi> can to restore him strength, to keep his <hi rend="italic">general health good,</hi> which is the only course for him. The warmer weather will help him like the rest of us.</p>
<p>I have written more than I meant; I must finish here. Keep within doors, dear Mother, except a little blink about noon if the Sun chance to be out.&#x2014; Good be with you all; Good and not Evil!</p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I am sorry I could not expect you yesterday; still more for the cause, which I hope is in the way of abating now. I did not call at the Club; my course leading me thro&#x2019; other streets.</p>
<p>You are an energetic labourer, with your twenty-one letters in a day! Pray, persist, and slacken not. A few such shoulders to the wheel, and the very wheel of Destiny must move.</p>
<p>Forster had seen Bulwer, Bulwer had written duly to Lord Morpeth, from whom however at that date there was no response. Bulwer attributed the silence to the pickle our poor Whig Ministry had got into <pb id="pg-12-66" n="12:66"/>again; in which, it seems, his Lordship had to act a main part.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On <date when="1840-02-27">27 Feb.</date> the Tories had defeated the govt. again in the debate on Sir John Newport&#x2019;s pension. The Tories were opposed technically because his office of comptroller gen. was not by law pensionable, but mainly because Spring Rice had succeeded him in that office and been created Lord Monteagle. Lord Morpeth had given the main speech for the govt.</note> An answer, Bulwer felt no doubt, would come, and in the affirmative; this he had undertaken to despatch instantly hither, as Forster was going out of Town till Thursday next. I will send it on to you. I must bring you and F. together directly on his return.</p>
<p>I found Empson; very willing to act, but unfortunately soon bound for the Country. He was to talk to Millman, to Lord Northampton &#x26;c. I have also seen Milnes again; he had made a convert of Pusey the Member for Bedfordshire, whom I wish I could see, for he is a good man, and slightly known to me.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Philip Pusey, M.P. for Berkshire, <date when="1835-00-00">1835</date>&#x2013;<date when="1852-00-00">52</date>. He was a member of the first committee, appointed <date when="1840-06-24">24 June</date>.</note> Could not you go, and blow upon Milnes again: the live-coal there is but of a <hi rend="italic">dull</hi> red as yet. John Mill never emerges in my horizon of late; I believe him heartily well disposed to the enterprise, could he be set in motion.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mill did not become involved, and left for Falmouth on <date when="1840-03-16">16 March</date>.</note> Agitators are wanted  Agitate! Agitate! Agitate!</p>
<p>If you can get so far before 2 o&#x2019;clock any day, or after 5 any evening, you are sure to find me here. Perhaps on Monday I may be in the Strand; I will in that case try Harcourt Buildings, but do not you stay in for me.</p>

<p>You have, indeed, my friend, written a very beautiful article.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;American Philosophy&#x2014;Emerson&#x2019;s Works,&#x201D; 33 (<date when="1840-03-00">March 1840</date>): 345&#x2013;72. The article included several allusions to and comparisons with TC.</note> There is a tint of poesy, humane insight, a soft graceful coherence, an undertone of pervading melody, which I like and call good. You will write a book one day which we shall all like. In prose it shall be if I may vote. A novel, an emblematic picture of English society as it is? Done in prose with the spirit of a poet, what a book were that!</p>
<p><pb id="pg-12-67" n="12:67"/>Emerson may object that he knew of your objections beforehand, that one needs in this world of antagonisms to smite only one side of a thing, while so many millions are everywhere assiduously smiting the other. To which you can answer, &#x201C;You knew the objections would come. Well, here they do come!&#x201D;</p>
<p>Another objection, that of setting up one Carlyle in the good Emerson&#x2019;s daylight there in that unwarrantable manner, seems to me still graver. How are you to answer that? Emerson will naturally see the article by-and-by, but a copy sent from you would undoubtedly be welcome to him; if with a small epistle from your own hand, of course, doubly so.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Milnes sent a copy with a note via Sumner (see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400401-TC-RWE-01">TC to RWE, <date when="1840-04-01">1 April</date></ref>). Emerson acknowledged it in a letter to Milnes, <date when="1840-05-30">30 May</date>.</note></p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Expect no straps! On going up to Fraser, I found that his Parcel <hi rend="italic">was off;</hi> that there was nothing more to be said! You will get a bit of leather somewhere, and have four holes slit in it: there is no riding without straps.</p>
<p>Just now your new Letter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found. In his letter, <date when="1840-03-06">6 March</date>, John wrote about their horses and &#x201C;the excellent weather for riding,&#x201D; and said that he had got straps that would serve him &#x201C;well enough.&#x201D;</note> has come, thanks for it. I send the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> to our Mother, as directed; and write this,&#x2014;which at any rate I meant to do. You are fixed at any rate till the 20<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, it seems: probably no better arrangement could be made. The case will then be entirely before you, to decide upon as you shall then see best.</p>
<p>My subject for Lecturing on ought hardly yet to be <hi rend="italic">named;</hi> lest evil befal it. I am to talk about gods, prophets, priests, kings, poets, teachers (<hi rend="italic">six</hi> sorts of them); and may probably call it &#x201C;On the Heroic.&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The six lectures were &#x201C;The Hero as Divinity,&#x201D; &#x201C;The Hero as Prophet,&#x201D; &#x201C;The Hero as Poet,&#x201D; &#x201C;The Hero as Priest,&#x201D; &#x201C;The Hero as Man of Letters,&#x201D; and &#x201C;The Hero as King,&#x201D; on <date when="1840-05-05">5</date>, <date when="1840-05-08">8</date>, <date when="1840-05-12">12</date>, <date when="1840-05-15">15</date>, <date when="1840-05-19">19</date>, and <date when="1840-05-22">22 May</date>; pbd. by Fraser as <hi rend="italic">On Heroes, Hero-Worship, &#x26; the Heroic in History</hi> (London, <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>).</note> Odin, Mahomet, Cromwell are three of my figures; I mean to shew that &#x201C;Hero-worship <hi rend="italic">never ceases</hi>,&#x201D; that it is at bottom the main or only kind of worship. But all as yet hangs in <foreign><hi rend="italic">posse;</hi></foreign> perhaps it will all evaporate yet; tho&#x2019; it is daily in my head more or less.&#x2014; Silence&#x2014;till we see!</p>
<p><pb id="pg-12-68" n="12:68"/>Lord Morpeth refuses to preside over our Library Meeting; at bottom I cannot afford to care much about that, just at present. I am sending off my Cambridge Books today.</p>
<p>No whisper of <hi rend="italic">settling</hi> yet with Fraser; I saw him on Saturday, but afar off, and without speech of that. We shall probably have a small <hi rend="italic">tussle</hi> for it. We shall see.&#x2014; Thackeray&#x2019;s Article is well enough.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >About the <hi rend="italic">Vengeur</hi>.</note> I am glad I did not write any farther on the subject.</p>
<p>A Letter this morning from Mrs Welsh: she had seen Jean lately, a day or two before; well and hearty, tho&#x2019; <hi rend="italic">thin</hi>-looking, her husband and she had both had colds.&#x2014; That poor Boy of Jamie&#x2019;s rather vexes me: could you not write Isabella any word of advice? I have an apprehension that the poor infant runs a great <supplied>[risk]</supplied> of growing up <hi rend="italic">lame;</hi> poor thing!</p>
<p>On Saturday night I declined the &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Royal Society Soiree</hi>&#x201D;;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On <date when="1840-02-29">29 Feb.</date>, given by the president, Lord Northampton, at his house in Piccadilly.</note> last night I refused the Elliots<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably Thomas Frederick and Jane Elliot.</note> &#x26; Sterlings; here is another 8 o&#x2019;clock business from the Stanleys, which I am studying how best to refuse.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >He accepted; see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400302-TC-HMS-01">next letter</ref>.</note> Had I but a thicker skin!&#x2014; Jane is still on foot.

<salute>My dear Maurice,</salute>
<p>Many thanks for what you have said of me, and for the sending of the Paper where it was said. Surely I owe you gratitude, and that only, for both the one and the other. Our views as to outward methods differ somewhat; but as to end and aim they are abundantly identical&#x2014;what more could two men (<hi rend="italic">two</hi> and not one) wish of one another? You hope of the Church where I all but despair of it: Heaven grant that <hi rend="italic">you</hi> may prove right, and not I, in this matter!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Maurice, in <date when="1839-09-00">Sept. 1839</date>, had taken a share in editing <hi rend="italic">The Educational Magazine</hi> before assuming full control, <date when="1840-01-00">Jan. 1840</date> to <date when="1841-00-00">spring 1841</date>. In an article on Chartism, dated <date when="1840-01-08">8 Jan.</date>, he had looked forward to reading TC on the subject in spite of his &#x201C;hereditary national antipathy&#x201D; to &#x201C;Churchmen.&#x201D; &#x201C;But &#x2026; he will be better able than most men to make us feel our need of a Church. In his &#x2018;History of the French Revolution&#x2019; he has borne more unconscious testimonies to the worth of a constitution, not based upon human ordinances and conventions, but upon a divine order; has given more proofs that the human heart can never be satisfied till it has discovered such a constitution, that the world can never be happy till it is acting in conformity with it, than any writer we know of. Such evidence at this time is quite invaluable. The Churchman must be a poor creature indeed who would not let an author laugh at him. &#x2026; We believe, therefore, that this book on Chartism &#x2026; may at least help us to know what manner of thing that education must be which is meant for a Chartist age.&#x201D; On <date when="1840-04-05">5 April</date>, declining an article by Strachey on TC, Maurice wrote: &#x201C;As for Carlyle, I do not know&#x2014;I will think it over again; but I fear I must not go out of my way to pay him compliments. There is no need for it, for his fame is most rampant. &#x2026; I believe there is no need to bring him to notice; that he attracts as much as is good for him or the world&#x201D; (F. Maurice, <hi rend="italic">The Life of F. D. Maurice</hi> [London, <date when="1884-00-00">1884</date>] 1:278&#x2013;80).</note> That is heartily my prayer.</p>
<p>You have not been to see me for months,&#x2014;for years? I was very sorry indeed to learn the other day that you have, of late, too good an excuse. Pray how <hi rend="italic">is</hi> Mrs Maurice?<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Anna Maurice was not strong, and overwork led her and Maurice to spend <date when="1840-07-00">July</date> and <date when="1840-08-00">Aug.</date> abroad &#x201C;to recover health&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Life</hi> 1:284).</note> This weather must be altogether hostile for her; but it cannot last.</p>
<p>If our Steamboats had begun again, Mahomet will come to the Mountain some day, since the Mountain will not to him.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Proverbial. Presumably TC meant to take one of the daily steamers from Chelsea, ca. six mi. down the Thames, to London Bridge nr. Guy&#x2019;s Hospital, where Maurice was chaplain.</note> No neater way, on record, of getting well thro&#x2019; a miracle!</p>

<salute>Dear Milnes,</salute>
<p>Christie has not been here; but no doubt he will agree with you, as I heartily do, about the propriety and indeed necessity of the hole-and-corner conclave. Lord Morpeth I fear will do nothing for us; it seems to me, besides, your friend Northampton<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lord Northampton.</note> would be the fitter man. I hear from Milman that you have gained him. The harvest is great!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Matt. 9:37.</note></p>
<p>If you could arrange a meeting for me with Pusey, I should be right glad to attend him anywhere and anywhen. At present I do not even know his Number in Hertford Street.&#x2014; Could not you go with me to him; say the day after tomorrow at 3 o&#x2019;clock,&#x2014;I taking you up in Pall Mall for that purpose? If you answer <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi>, I will suppose it to mean&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">yes</hi>. A negatory letter tomorrow evening (before 8 o&#x2019;clock, I think) would still be in time to stop me. Friday, then, at 3, if I hear nothing.</p>
<p>The Albemarle people<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Royal Institution, 21 Albemarle St., had a library, open to members, of ca. 25,000 vols.</note> lie out of my latitude: but Pusey&#x2019;s idea is certainly good, if practicable there. Somebody last year<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Craik; see <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390526-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1839-05-26">26 May 1839</date></ref>.</note> suggested that the <hi rend="italic">City</hi> of London Institution had become very poor, and would perhaps sell <hi rend="italic">its</hi> Library; one of the best little Libraries in England; perhaps the very best, having been collected under Porson&#x2019;s guidance mainly.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not the City of London Literary and Scientific Institution, but the London Institution, Finsbury Circus.

<p>By all means send Emerson your Article,&#x2014;corrected. You can get the loose sheets out of what the Printers call &#x201C;waste&#x201D; (or even tear up your copy of the Review,&#x2014;Nature will not shriek to any great extent); fold it together like a Newspaper or N<hi rend="italic">l</hi> Palaver<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;National Palaver,&#x201D; the House of Commons; see &#x201C;Chartism,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 29:190.</note> Petition, and send it off by the <hi rend="italic">British Queen</hi>, or any Line Ship; packages of that kind travel at small cost by the Yankee Postoffice, if you merely leave them open at the ends, to shew what they are.

<p>Or failing that, can you appear here on horseback, precisely at 2 o&#x2019;clock on Saturday, equipt for a canter of two hours? I have got my horse back again;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On <date when="1840-03-10">10 March</date>.</note> and have twice seen the blue sky; ascertained, to my infinite satisfaction, that God&#x2019;s Universe is not all a puddle of dust, smoke, uproar and mad gabblement, but has fields, trees, silence and eternal azure over it!</p>
<p>One or other of these things I will count on your doing, if I hear <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> of you. <hi rend="italic">Both</hi> of them will be still better. Tomorrow I am, conditionally, engaged to go with Milnes and stir up Pusey into proper Book-madness.</p>

<p>I think you should certainly get the Hole-and-corner people brought together some day this week if possible.

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>In the firm faith that you have still some remembrance of me, and that you are still the same friendly man as of old, I crave leave to introduce to you Signor Ruffini,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Agostino Ruffini (<date when="1812-00-00">1812</date>&#x2013;<date when="1855-00-00">55</date>), and his brother Giovanni (<date when="1807-00-00">1807</date>&#x2013;<date when="1881-00-00">81</date>), exiled from Genoa, had shared lodgings with Mazzini since their arrival in London together in <date when="1837-00-00">1837</date>; but friction between the two brothers and Mazzini led Agostino to move to Edinburgh. JWC also wrote letters of introduction for him. He taught Italian, first at 60 Castle St., then 81 George St., and was much admired (see D. Masson, <hi rend="italic">Memories of Two Cities</hi> [Edinburgh, <date when="1811-00-00">1811</date>] 120&#x2013;45). He returned to Italy in <date when="1848-00-00">1848</date>.</note> a young Genoese Exile, about to settle in Edinburgh as a Teacher of Italian; in whom, for his own and others&#x2019; <pb id="pg-12-75" n="12:75"/>sake, I take much interest. A generous, wise or unwise, interpretation of his duties as a citizen, and generous resolution to act upon that, has driven him out of his own country and an enviable position there, to work out a much more rugged destiny among strangers. The brave man deserves help from the brave. If you can in any way encourage or assist him, I will beg you to do it. He seems, what is not a universal case, capable of being helped; and indeed I think you will find him both likely and worthy to succeed.</p>
<p>It is many a day and year since I heard anything directly from you. My thoughts go often to Scotland, go daily thither; but all is becoming more and more <hi rend="italic">spectral</hi> for me there. Ah me!</p>
<p>If Moir<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Moir (<date when="1800-00-00">1800</date>&#x2013;<date when="1870-00-00">1870</date>), prof. of rhetoric and English literature at Edinburgh, was to resign in <date when="1840-00-00">1840</date> to return to legal practice, as his class was small. TC may have detected &#x201C;quizzing&#x201D; in some of his anonymous reviewing in <hi rend="italic">Blackwood&#x2019;s</hi> or in the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review</hi>, where for example (63:445, in <date when="1836-00-00">1836</date>) he wrote of the &#x201C;moral worthlessness&#x201D; of Goethe&#x2019;s poetry.

<p>As I do not hear from you, I must write again to tell you about Austin&#x2019;s money. Not getting any word from you, and growing to apprehend at last that perhaps Austin might be suffering from want of the cash, which <hi rend="italic">would</hi> have to be produced some time or other, I yesterday steered towards the Bank with Thirty pounds, and sent it off for him to the Commercial Bank at Annan. I have written to him that it will be there on Thursday first, or any day after that. I had written first that <hi rend="italic">you</hi> should go down to Annan too on Thursday, and &#x201C;help&#x201D; him in the getting of it out: but I find, on reconsidering, that it is very likely he may not get his Letter at all <hi rend="italic">till</hi> Thursday; wherefore I have written now that he is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to expect you or anybody, but to go himself on what day he likes, and (with a Paper I had sent him) present himself at <pb id="pg-12-76" n="12:76"/>the Bank. I hope therefore this matter is finished now. You said &#x201C;between &#xa3;20 and &#xa3;30&#x201D;; I have sent the largest of these sums, as you did not specify more minutely. Indeed, I began to consider that perhaps you would not like to specify more minutely. I shall like to hear farther news from you about <hi rend="italic">the Gill</hi>. Alick&#x2019;s opinion I was glad to observe, seemed to be very favourable as to the place.</p>
<p>Do you, for your own sake, know anything farther about that &#x201C;Duke&#x2019;s-Farm&#x201D; that was to fall vacant down in the Border somewhere? Jack and I were speaking of it the very day before he went away from London. I think you ought to keep your eye on the place, make up your mind clearly as to what it is worth, and offer for it if you saw good. Jack would &#x201C;speak or write to the Duke.&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of Buccleuch.</note> The Duke, it seems, does not do <hi rend="italic">favours</hi> to anybody in the matter of land; but of course Jack&#x2019;s word would go a certain length; and, I think, might <hi rend="italic">fetch</hi> such a thing if a fair rent were offered. Do not neglect it at any rate, should nothing better turn up.</p>
<p>I am still held very busy; the eastwind also is not a great favourite with me. I have got my horse again, however; and have a beautiful gallop almost every day of late. It is the very life of me. The horse came the day after I sent for it; in the most perfect condition, new-shod brisk and glittering to the outmost fringe of it! They have <hi rend="italic">clipt</hi> the skin of it; that is an art they have here, and a universal practice for smart horses: to the very tip of the ears all is clipt, in the neatest manner, and you cannot know it from the sleek fell [the way the hair lies] of a horse at midsummer,&#x2014;not even by the <hi rend="italic">colour</hi>, in my case; for mine is black as a coal down to the very root.</p>
<p>I suppose you have word from the Doctor fully as late as ours here. He told me he had written about poor little Tom. I hope the change of weather when it comes will do something for that poor little fellow.&#x2014; I have to write a word to my Mother. Why did not, why <hi rend="italic">do</hi> not <hi rend="italic">you</hi> write?&#x2014; <closer><salute>Ever yours,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>A Letter is going to Jamie; but I will write your salutation on a paper by itself. You did not hear from me all last week: I was too busy <pb id="pg-12-77" n="12:77"/>to write; the rather as there was absolutely nothing out of its usual routine; nothing new at all, except that <hi rend="italic">my horse had come</hi>, and the promise of brisker health along with it!</p>
<p>Our Printers have got into the <hi rend="italic">last</hi> volume now; Heaven be thanked for it: we shall hope to have done in some two weeks or so. I am also revolving and tumbling about among my projected &#x201C;Lectures,&#x201D; tho&#x2019; I have made no public announcement of them yet. They will <hi rend="italic">do</hi>, I think, better or worse.&#x2014; One has such a quantity of tumult and additional uproar at this season; the very streets with double and treble whirlpool of carriages are an agitation to look upon. After refusing several dinners I <hi rend="italic">had</hi> to go to another, last Saturday night. Wonderfully &#x201C;high people,&#x201D; among the highest in the land, wanted to see <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, it appeared! Lord Holland Lady Holland, Marquis of Normanby,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henry Richard Vassall Fox (<date when="1773-00-00">1773</date>&#x2013;<date when="1840-00-00">1840</date>), 3d Baron Holland, Whig statesman; opposed death penalty for theft; advocated emancipation of slaves; held various posts in Whig governments; trans. from Spanish and Italian. Elizabeth Vassall Fox, Lady Holland (<date when="1770-00-00">1770</date>&#x2013;<date when="1845-00-00">1845</date>), da. of a Jamaican, Richard Vassall; divorced from first husband to marry Fox; well known as hostess of the Whig circle at Holland House (<ref target="volume-09/lt-18371212-TC-JAC-01"><sic>9:364</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1837-12-12">12 Dec. 1837</date></corr></ref>). Constantine Henry Phipps (<date when="1797-00-00">1797</date>&#x2013;<date when="1863-00-00">1863</date>), 1st Marquess of Normandy (<date when="1838-00-00">1838</date>), and 2d Earl of Mulgrave (<date when="1831-00-00">1831</date>); gov. of Jamaica, <date when="1832-00-00">1832</date>&#x2013;<date when="1834-00-00">34</date>; lord lt. of Ireland, <date when="1835-00-00">1835</date>&#x2013;<date when="1839-00-00">39</date>; home sec., <date when="1839-00-00">1839</date>&#x2013;<date when="1841-00-00">41</date>; later ambassador at Paris and Florence. For further details of the dinner at the Stanleys, see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400317-TC-JAC-01">next letter</ref>.</note> Lord Morpeth,&#x2014;Lords and Ladies as thick as blackberries! Old Lord Holland alone, who is a nephew of the celebrated Fox,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charles James Fox (<date when="1749-00-00">1749</date>&#x2013;<date when="1806-00-00">1806</date>), statesman.</note> very like <hi rend="italic">him</hi>, and a brave old man, pleased me somewhat. His wife Lady Holland, who has sat here as a &#x201C;queen of lions&#x201D; these thirty years, is a stern-looking proud old dame, with an air of considerable character too.&#x2014; On the whole I paid for the honour by a decisive headache, and broken sleep. But my <hi rend="italic">horse</hi> carries me better thro&#x2019; than my feet could have done. This weather is good for galloping, if bad for many things; I buckle an old rough coat of Jack&#x2019;s about me, and dash into the country daily with great pleasure and profit.</p>
<p>Poor Jane has taken a kind of cold at last; yesterday she had headache as well; the headache is now gone tho&#x2019; the cold continues. I hope it will not amount to much; but go its ways shortly. Indeed I too began to feel the constant east-wind detrimental to me,&#x2014;till once the horse came.</p>
<p>You, dear Mother, how do you contrive to <hi rend="italic">fend</hi> against the blasts? I hope you keep mostly within doors; wrap yourself from head to foot when you venture out, and walk as fast as you can!&#x2014; I sent your good little Letter over to Jack; who has sent it back to me again, as he was ordered to do. I have no Letter for about a week. He seemed to expect some settlement of his scheme about the <date when="1840-03-20">20<hi rend="italic">th</hi> of this month</date>. Fraser and <pb id="pg-12-78" n="12:78"/>I are to meet finally for a settlement tomorrow night: he is very loath to offend me at present,&#x2014;poor man!</p>
<p>My tobacco is entirely done, tell Alick; and I am smoking perfect rubbish at 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi> an ounce! I hope the other is near me now.&#x2014; We had a Box from Mrs Welsh last week; containing, among other things a brave new dressing-gown for me;&#x2014;also a bit of excellent bacon! She seems to be well enough this winter; going on altogether in the old way.&#x2014; Our Fife potatoes are come, safe.</p>
<p>Jean wrote to me from Dumfries not long since;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1840-03-08">8 March</date>. Jean had written mentioning her shock that TC&#x2019;s last consignment of 675 pipes had been smashed, and that &#x201C;R. Haining boasts that he draws three or four pounds a day&#x2014; They all seem to say Jenny &#x26; he are doing well tho&#x2019; it is impossible to deny that he sometimes tries to make &#x2018;one thing seem two &#x26; ones ear half a bannock.&#x2019; But I think Jenny does not notice it. &#x2026; There is nothing new here at present. There was a kind of aim at raising a fuss at the Queens Marriage but it went off without effect. The chartists having dragged the Materials for the Bonefire &#x26; pitched them into the Nith.&#x201D;</note> she seemed to be expecting you there before long. Mrs Welsh, a while before, had described her as well, tho&#x2019; looking thin.</p>
<p>Jane, <hi rend="italic">not</hi> altogether on a sofa today, sends affectionate remembrances. We had Aitken the Minister of Minto here yesterday; looking <foreign><hi rend="italic">oorie</hi></foreign> [gloomy], old, unhappy.&#x2014; My blessing with one and all of you.&#x2014; When will you write again?&#x2014; <closer><salute>Ever your affectionate</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Just while I was sealing a Letter to my Mother, arrives yours; I send <hi rend="italic">it</hi> off to Scotsbrig (there being nothing secret in it), and will straightway proceed to fling you a word of answer.</p>
<p>No news from Scotsbrig; only a Letter from Dumfries, intimating that <supplied>[all]</supplied> was right there then.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >From Jean Carlyle Aitken, of <date when="1840-03-08">8 March</date>.</note> Of late days it had struck me that Jamie&#x2019;s delay to write about Austin&#x2019;s money might perhaps be causing <pb id="pg-12-79" n="12:79"/>inconvenience to Austin, as surely it was causing no convenience to me; so yesterday I sent off &#xa3;30 of money, and have written to Mary today that they will find it at the Annan Commercial Bank Office any day after Thursday first. Jamie (of Scotsbrig) said between &#xa3;20 and &#xa3;30; I have sent the largest sum, and hope we shall hear no more of it now.</p>
<p>My funds are not of the most copious at present, my &#xa3;50 being thus reduced to &#xa3;20, and Fraser&#x2019;s bills bearing &#x201C;10 months date&#x201D;; however, I believe I shall manage without any inconvenience whatever after all. Fraser and <supplied>[I]</supplied> have never got settled yet; tomorrow night I am to go up and try. Poor James seems very anxious not to quarrel with me; but I must not give him altogether his own way either.&#x2014; I have finished the <hi rend="italic">Koran;</hi> read some things on Iceland; a pamphlet of La Mennais<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400316-TC-RMM-01">TC to RMM, [<date when="1840-03-16">16 March</date>]</ref>.</note> &#x26;c. My Lectures remain dim and horrible; but I suppose I shall get them worked out too. We are in the fifth volume of our Printing: happily in some two weeks or so, that coil of confusions will be behind me; I shall study to clear the decks, and have my whole time to <hi rend="italic">study</hi> my oratory in.</p>
<p>Mrs Jameson was here one night; <hi rend="italic">not</hi> gone to Italy, her father being so ill:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Anna Jameson had set out for Italy in <date when="1840-02-00">Feb.</date>, but was recalled from Paris to her parents&#x2019; home in Notting Hill. Her father, Denis Brownell Murphy, an Irish miniature painter, had been semiparalyzed since his first attack in <date when="1833-00-00">1833</date>. He did not die until <date when="1842-00-00">1842</date>. She wrote, <date when="1840-03-15">15 March</date>, &#x201C;I believe there is little chance of him rallying again. &#x2026; I cannot but feel regret for all I have abandoned, though God knows I do not repent&#x201D; (G. Macpherson, <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of Anna Jameson</hi> [London, <date when="1878-00-00">1878</date>] 165).</note> she talked with the usual enthusiasm about news, rights of women,&#x2014;the &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">woral</hi> [world] and her horse.&#x201D; No bad person at all; a great deal of <hi rend="italic">heart</hi> in her, a kind of unsubduable courage, which is the grand root of all. Poor Mill is gone down to Falmouth; I understand, to see his poor Brother <hi rend="italic">die!</hi><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >He d. on <date when="1840-04-04">4 April</date>.</note>
You remember his mentioning that poor lad the night we went to Kensington after such a walk: he had been put into a <hi rend="italic">warmed room</hi> at that time; growing worse, he was sent towards Madiera about the same time with Sterling; missed the Packet at Falmouth being a day too late; has stayed there; and now&#x2014;! &#x2014; Mill has an article on Coleridge in the last Review which some admire much.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">London and Westminster Review</hi> 33 (<date when="1840-03-00">March 1840</date>):257&#x2013;302. Mill had written to John Sterling (<date when="1839-09-28">28 Sept. 1839</date>): &#x201C;If I carry on the review to another number it will be partly in order to publish in it an article on Coleridge which I have always thought desirable as a counter-pole to the one on Bentham. I have begun a fresh study of Coleridge&#x2019;s writings for that purpose&#x2014;but &#x2026; I am fearful of understating both his merit &#x26; his importance&#x201D; (Mineka 13:405&#x2013;6).</note> It is admirably <hi rend="italic">ex</hi>pressed; but with that my great admiration of it stops short. Milnes has also a very pretty Article on Emerson the <pb id="pg-12-80" n="12:80"/>American. If you can get at the N<hi rend="italic">o</hi>, catch it for the sake of these two: there is nothing else in it that I remember&#x2014;except some nonsense.</p>
<p>Poor Darley has got out a &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Thomas A&#x2019;Becket</hi> a Dramatic Chronicle&#x201D;; really very meritorious, Darleyish, even genial here and there; we read it with real pleasure for his sake and our own.</p>
<p>This morning the <hi rend="italic">Parcels Company</hi> brought me two pretty Books from Varnhagen von der Ense:<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Vol. 5 of Varnhagen von Ense&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Denkw&#xfc;rdigkeiten</hi> (<ref target="volume-09/lt-18371231-TC-KAVE-01"><sic>9:382</sic><corr>TC to KAVE, <date when="1837-12-31">31 Dec. 1837</date></corr></ref>); see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18401107-TC-KAVE-01">TC to KAVE, <date when="1840-11-07">7 Nov.</date></ref></note> on the inside of the first board of one is pasted a cover, wherein lay the beautifullest copperplate india-paper proof epistolet:<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Varnhagen was noted for his beautiful handwriting.</note> I send it you today; but must beg for it back again, <hi rend="italic">uncrumpled</hi>, to stick in its old place. Such a Note of itself is characteristic. Such a man could in no case become a <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;Threefingered Jack!&#x201D;</hi><note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A runaway slave turned robber in Jamaica, ca. <date when="1782-00-00">1782</date>, known in Jamaican nursery tales and in melodramatic literature; called &#x201C;the notorious rebel&#x201D; by G. W. Bridges, <hi rend="italic">Annals of Jamaica</hi> (London, <date when="1828-00-00">1828</date>) 2:183.</note> Yet Bunsen disliked him as a Radical, I remember!&#x2014; &#x201C;By the bye&#x201D; let me mention here, I heard that Bunsen had gone as Envoy to Berne,<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Bunsen had left England in <date when="1839-10-00">Oct. 1839</date> to be Prussian envoy to the Swiss Confederation till <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>. He later wrote about Varnhagen&#x2019;s &#x201C;malicious Diary&#x201D; and that he &#x201C;hated <hi rend="italic">me</hi> because I had never sought his acquaintance, and because he could not comprehend me. &#x2026; The man was uncongenial to me as an egotist and a negation&#x201D; (<date when="1860-03-00">March 1860</date>, Frances Bunsen, <hi rend="italic">Memoir of Baron Bunsen</hi> [London, <date when="1868-00-00">1868</date>] 2:540&#x2013;41).</note> and was now living there in great felicity and propriety.</p>
<p>Half an hour ago, I sent your message for Mrs Anthony by Sterling,<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >To Charlotte by Edward.</note> who was here. He came to persuade me to a &#x201C;dinner of lords&#x201D;; <foreign><hi rend="italic">ach nein</hi></foreign> [ah no], I had too much of that on Saturday last, when I was pressed into the Stanley service again! There at the dear cost of a shattered set of nerves, and head set whirling for the next eight and forty hours, I did see Lords and Lions. Lord Holland and Lady, Normanby &#x26;c; and then for <foreign>soir&#xE9;e</foreign> up stairs, Morpeth, Landsdown<supplied>[e]</supplied>, French Guizot,<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >F. P. G. Guizot was briefly in London as the French ambassador, <date when="1840-02-00">Feb.</date> to <date when="1840-10-00">Oct.</date>, when he was recalled by Louis Philippe to form the govt. He remained in power until <date when="1848-00-00">1848</date>.</note> the Queen of Beauty<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jane Georgiana, Lady Seymour (d. <date when="1884-00-00">1884</date>), Richard Brinsley Sheridan&#x2019;s granddaughter, Caroline Norton&#x2019;s sister; m., <date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>, Edward Adolphus Seymour (<date when="1804-00-00">1804</date>&#x2013;<date when="1885-00-00">85</date>), 12th Duke of Somerset (<date when="1855-00-00">1855</date>); she had been Queen of Beauty at the Eglinton Tournament, <date when="1839-08-00">Aug. 1839</date>. See <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400619-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1840-06-19">19 June</date></ref>.</note> &#x26;c. Nay <hi rend="italic">Pickwick</hi> too was of the dinner-party, I mean Dickens; tho&#x2019; they did not seem to heed him over much. He is a fine little fellow, Boz, as I think; clear blue intelligent eyes, eyebrows that he arches amazingly, large protrusive rather loose mouth,&#x2014;a face of the most extreme <hi rend="italic">mobility</hi>, which he shuttles about, <pb id="pg-12-81" n="12:81"/>eyebrows, eyes, mouth and all, in a very singular manner while speaking; surmount this with a loose coil of common-coloured hair, and set it on a small compact figure, very small, and dressed rather <foreign><hi rend="italic">&#xE0; la d&#x2019;Orsay</hi></foreign> than well: this is Pickwick;&#x2014;for the rest a quiet shrewd-looking little fellow, who seems to guess pretty well what he is, and what others are. Lady Holland is a brown-skinned, silent, sad-concentrated, proud old dame; her face when you see it in profile has something of the falcon character (if a falcon&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">bill</hi> were <hi rend="italic">straight</hi>), and you see much of the white of her eye. Notable word she spake none; sat like one wont to be obeyed and entertained. Old Holland whose legs are said to be almost turned to <hi rend="italic">stone</hi> pleased me much. A very large bald head, small grey invincible composed-looking eyes, the immense tuft of eyebrow which all the Foxes have; stiff upper lip, roomy mouth and chin, short angry yet modest nose; I saw there a fine old <foreign><hi rend="italic">Jarl</hi></foreign> [Earl], an honest, obstinate, candid, wholesomely limited, very effectual and estimable old man. For Normanby, see the Caricatures. Tall, slender, perpendicular as a plummet; a large <foreign>chevelure</foreign> (which you suspect falsely to be <hi rend="italic">dyed</hi> or a <hi rend="italic">wig</hi>); anxious eyes that strive to look serene and young from amid a mass of black confused wrinkles, speaking too plainly of <hi rend="italic">unsereneness</hi> and fifty-five good years! Morpeth also is very like his caricatures: big blue eyes that <hi rend="italic">smile</hi>, and are set in a big puffy ring of protrusive fat;&#x2014;you know him: old Thames is safe from him.<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Variant of saying about setting &#x201C;the Thames on fire.&#x201D;</note> Of the rest I will not say a syllable; not even of the Queen of Beauty (who looked rather withered and unwell): simply of Guizot one word. A curious ambassador; at first glance more like an ancient Geneva Presbyterian Minister;<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >He was Protestant.</note>&#x2014;yet decidedly likeable and estimable, I should guess. Look and complexion wholly <foreign><hi rend="italic">tauchy</hi></foreign> [greasy], French; baldish black head, broad low brow, a face that <hi rend="italic">hastens</hi> then to conclude itself&#x2014;as it were triangularly; <foreign><hi rend="italic">taille moyenne</hi></foreign> [middle stature] or lower; tolerable English, and great modesty and sense: an interesting kind of man, with nothing of the sulky pedantry which I have seen in some of his portraits. I could have wished to speak with him farther: but he was whirled into the vortex of things, and I beheld him no more.&#x2014; Why do I babble about all this? Heaven knows it is not because I have <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> to do!</p>
<p>The best news however is that I have got my horse a week ago, in the most superb order, all clipt and sleek; and that I ride daily into the free air. It is a luxury like no other. I do believe it will do my health good. I must &#x201C;lecture&#x201D; the better to pay it!</p>
<p>Poor Jane <hi rend="italic">has</hi> taken a cold at last,&#x2014;merely sitting at the fire!&#x2014; She had a head-ache yesterday; she has got quit of that but the other <pb id="pg-12-82" n="12:82"/>sym<supplied>[p]</supplied>toms remain. We trust she will shake it all off soon, and without its going deeper. I will not write another word today.&#x2014; <closer><salute>Yours ever truly</salute></closer></p>
<name>T. Carlyle</name>
<ps><p>Tell me nothing more about your situation than you like. I am well pleased that you have got it put on a footing &#x201C;of indifference whether you go or stay.&#x201D; That is the clear footing.</p></ps>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Milnes has appointed us all to meet in his apartment, N<hi rend="italic">o</hi> 26 Pall Mall, on Wednesday next,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1840-03-25">25 March</date>.</note> a little before 2 o&#x2019;clock. There are to be <pb id="pg-12-83" n="12:83"/>about Twenty chosen men,&#x2014;with sense in their head! I was to warn you. I also undertook to write to Bulwer, Milnes himself writing too; Milnes declared he would be the surer to come if I also wrote. Pray deliver him that Note therefore; I have forgotten the N<hi rend="italic">o</hi> of his house.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >36a Hertford St., Mayfair.</note> And withal bring him!&#x2014; Can you not bring Fox<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >W. J. Fox.</note> too? I w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> gladly write to him if I knew whitherward. Dickens is to be written to by Milnes. On the whole we must all come, each with utmost zeal in his heart, each with some kind of program and scheme of action in his head. My plan is for transmitting those Prospectuses with a lithographed circular to all the four winds. The preliminary of all, however, I should think is <hi rend="italic">that each pay down a sovereign</hi>, to cover expenses!</p>
<p>Every day except one I have gone to ride at two o&#x2019;clock: it is, as I said, the <hi rend="italic">established</hi> practice. Mrs Carlyle still coughs, close prisoner, under <hi rend="italic">Influenza</hi>, one of the ugliest jailors. My bath of <hi rend="italic">Torpor</hi>, accompanied with violent riding, will do me good by and by.</p>
<p>Two o&#x2019;clock the established practice!</p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I had summoned one or two people to Milnes&#x2019;s Conclave for Wednesday; but learning from him that it must be for Saturday, I altered the date accordingly for these parties. The hour I mentioned was &#x201C;Before <hi rend="italic">Two</hi>&#x201D;; we had better make it &#x201C;Half-past one <hi rend="italic">for</hi> Two&#x201D; (in the usual style of Placards): Milnes said &#x201C;One <hi rend="italic">or</hi> Two&#x201D;; and we must not alter again, if we can help it.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC had notified Forster of a meeting on Wed., <date when="1840-03-25">25 March</date>, then changed to Sat., <date when="1840-03-28">28 March</date>; see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400320-TC-JF-01">TC to JF, <date when="1840-03-20">20 March</date></ref>, and <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400321-TC-JF-01"><date when="1840-03-21">21 March</date></ref>. The one meeting definitely noted by TC as taking place was on Wed., <date when="1840-04-01">1 April</date> (<ref target="volume-12/lt-18400402-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1840-04-02">2 April</date></ref>).</note></p>
<p>The persons I have asked hitherto are Bulwer, Forster, Fox (doubtful he); Craik, who is to bring a City man called Fry, and a Scotch editorial character, Weir; he was also to warn Long, but perhaps you too had better speak or write to Long.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alfred Augustus Fry, papermaker&#x2019;s agent, 14 Earl St., Blackfriars, and 15 Chancery Lane.

<p>Two things I think you should be prepared with on the day we meet: First, a complete List of all the adherents already got; secondly, a correct tale of what number of Prospectuses (in Fraser&#x2019;s, Ridgeway&#x2019;s,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Ridgway &#x26; Sons, booksellers, 169 Piccadilly.</note> your own, Forster&#x2019;s and Spedding&#x2019;s hands) do still remain to us. In regard to the first matter, I have two new names to give you: Thomas De La Rue, 110.

Fraser mentioned to me yesternight that <hi rend="italic">he</hi> had sent a new name over to Spedding. The enumeration of the extant Prospectuses will, if we determine on a &#x201C;Circular,&#x201D; of course be essential.&#x2014; Perhaps I shall see you before the day of meeting? I go to ride daily at 2; am at home till then.</p>
<p>Ridgway forwarded the Pamphlet, thro&#x2019; the Post, this morning.

<salute>Dear Milnes,</salute>
<p>I had summoned Bulwer and some others for Wednesday; I have written again to say Saturday. The hour was &#x201C;Two for despatch of business&#x201D;; let us say in Placard-style &#x201C;Half-past one for two,&#x201D; and stand by that.</p>
<p>Bulwer, Forster (and thro&#x2019; him, unitarian Fox, tho&#x2019; with doubtful result); Craik, and thro&#x2019; him a certain zealous worthy Mr Fry, of the City Merchant class, disposed to be an apostle in this business; then also, still thro&#x2019; Craik, one Weir a Scottish-German radical literary person, rough, <foreign><hi rend="italic">b&#xfc;rschenartig</hi></foreign> [like a student],<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350615-TC-JAC-01"><sic>8:148</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1835-06-15">15 June 1835</date></corr></ref>.</note> but not without worth, faculty and opportunity,&#x2014;and Long of the Penny Cyclopedia; these are all the persons I have yet summoned. I fell upon Milman, one day, in the street; he said &#x201C;It will all depend on how you manage it.&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;Then come you, and help us!&#x201D; He gave a doubtful response; but might perhaps come if you asked him. Be you diligent, and bring men up to the drum-head! Your judgement in that is better than mine. Christie will assist you; he has the complete List. It seems to me, the more that come the better, unless they be noisy fellows! A silent man, if he bring nothing, will at least take nothing,&#x2014;except a little air to breathe, which we can spare him in these east winds. Spedding &#x26;c, and indeed all the others that I remember, are more accessible to you than to me.</p>
<p>Would it not be well that you directed your wheels hitherward <pb id="pg-12-86" n="12:86"/>some morning prior to Saturday? I am here daily till two; nightly after five. Put a Prospectus in your pocket!</p>

<salute>My dear Alick,</salute>
<p>I am really sorry you have such a quantity of trouble with that Tobacco business. In this remoteness from all Excise affairs, I am not able to throw any light on the course of procedure; tho&#x2019; I <hi rend="italic">believe</hi> that Lockerby Gauger must be wrong, and that a regular Permit indicating the Tobacco to have regularly paid its duties anywhere in Britain will carry it safe over the whole British Empire.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The local excise officer was supposed to issue a permit for movement of the tobacco once Alick proved that tax had already been paid on it.</note> Probably there would be no danger of the thing, were it once fairly in anybody&#x2019;s hands at Liverpool: but decidedly we <hi rend="italic">will not risk it;</hi> if the Excise vermin will not grant us a due <hi rend="italic">permit</hi>, we will leave the article safe where it is, to be consumed in detail where it has already arrived.&#x2014; For the rest, pray do not fret yourself too much about it. I have discovered a shop hard by this street, where the Tobacco is very tolerable; indeed considerably <hi rend="italic">like</hi> that that I was expecting,&#x2014;the main difference indeed recognisable enough, that it is at 1/4 per quarter lb.: but this on the whole is endurable, compared with dearth and badness both in one. There, in a Box from Mrs Welsh, there has already come a junk of very effectual bacon, which, as there is at present none to use it but occasionally I, will last a good while. So the hurry is considerably stilled, you see; and I will prescribe, as the first rule, that you do not flutter yourself, or on the whole take too much trouble about the affair at all. If the vexatious Excise interpose, and say &#x201C;No,&#x201D; we can answer, &#x201C;Well, No be it then, thou vexatious Ineptitude, we can do also with No!&#x201D;&#x2014; Next Letter you write, <hi rend="italic">put me in</hi> a pipe of the weed there as you have it, and I will try its quality! You can actually do this: half a sheet of paper will carry a good pipe of tobacco, and still be under half an ounce. Nay one might <pb id="pg-12-87" n="12:87"/>almost send it up in ounces by post, and have it but little dearer than I buy it here!&#x2014; Another thing is, do not detain any Letter of my Mother&#x2019;s again: clap in half a word of your own, and send it off, swift; I was occasionally in anxieties about her during this wild weather of ours.</p>
<p>Your weather, it seems indeed, has been much milder; I do not remember to have seen a more poisonous March than is <supplied>[this]</supplied> of ours, with bitter east-wind and cold. Today and yesternight we had a fair sprinkling of hail and snow, which perhaps will sweeten things a little.&#x2014; Poor Jane <hi rend="italic">gave in</hi>, in consequence of all this, about two weeks ago; and is still very weakly with a kind of cold, or influenza, such as many have here; tho&#x2019; she never yet actually keeps her bed all day. Indeed as she does not grow worse, I calculate that with the arrival of westerly weather, she will spring up again, little worse. On me too this bitter wind produces other than a good effect: without being precisel<supplied>[y]</supplied> <hi rend="italic">unwell</hi> I feel myself rather <hi rend="italic">more</hi> bilious than usual,&#x2014;and this altho&#x2019; I have been riding now with great diligence for above two weeks now. The doctors say, indeed, that riding does always at first make people more bilious, independently of weather! I will try to believe them; and certainly go cantering on. It is of great moment to me at this season to be in good case: my Lectures I often say will depend more on the black mare than on me; if I be not in clear condition of body, I cannot lecture on this subject at all! It is a subject, which I shall perhaps call <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;Heroes&#x201D;</hi> (or Great Men, <hi rend="italic">six</hi> of them); and if I had a fair chance I <hi rend="italic">could</hi> give them a mouthful about it. But in my old humour, I durst not say a word of what it were essential to say. You shall hear more before long. It comes on in <date when="1840-05-00">May</date>.</p>
<p>Alas, here is two o&#x2019;clock close at hand, and the morn will be here!&#x2014; Good b&#x2019;ye dear Brother for this day!&#x2014; <closer><salute>Yours ever affectionately</salute></closer></p>

<p>My notion of this conclave at Milnes&#x2019;s is that each come with his <hi rend="italic">own</hi> notion in some sort of utterable shape, and then utter it; whereby a general notion; and scheme of procedure, may be articulated and got together. It were good, if we had the complete list of <hi rend="italic">parties present</hi>, to consider beforehand, Whether we shall make a Chairman, Who shall be Chairman, Who the Provisional Committeemen shall be, &#x26;c: these points we cannot settle here; but these, and others, it will be well that we try to foreshadow for ourselves, so far as possible.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC was made sec. at the meeting on <date when="1840-04-01">1 April</date>.</note></p>
<p>Come you therefore, with Forster or with word from him,&#x2014;with whomsoever or with word from whomsoever you find good: if I fall in with Craik I will ask him too.</p>
<p>We have Tea here at six; but I suppose that is far too early for you? From half-past six there is no Tea more, and the decks are clear.</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Your Letter of Credit for &#xa3;100<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John had written sending &#xa3;100, &#x201C;the fruits of my labours here since the <date when="1840-02-00">beginning of February</date>.&#x201D;</note> arrived last night. I am much obliged by your goodwill in that matter; tho&#x2019; I think we shall not need the Document itself: Jane has some cash in the Savings Bank, which she is to take out for present wants; and then in a couple of months more I may expect to have a new supply from Lecturing. Many thanks to you, all the same! As I am to have, at any rate, tomorrow a non-riding day, I think I shall try to get into the City with your Paper, and send off the produce to Dumfries, where our Mother now happens to be. Or perhaps I may deduct from it the &#xa3;30 I sent to Mary; then <hi rend="italic">you</hi> will have advanced the whole of that <foreign><hi rend="italic">milde Spende</hi></foreign> [kind Gift], and I will be answerable for the half of it in due season. Mary sent me a Letter announcing with due thankfulness the safe arrival of the sum; <pb id="pg-12-89" n="12:89"/>I despatched her Note as an inclosure in one I was writing to our Mother the other day. Sowing &#x26;c appears to be going on at Gill, and all in a fair state of progress there.</p>
<p>Alick wrote to announce that the Tobacco could <hi rend="italic">not</hi> get away; owing to want of Permit, and erroneous arrangement as to getting one soon, or as to getting one at all! I am very unfortunate in my nicotian enterprises from Scotland this time. Alick&#x2019;s letter inclosed one from our Mother; which, tho dated some while ago, I will send today. She had since gone to Dumfries, as I said; driven up in the Gig by Hanning. A Letter came from Isabella, written just as they were going off: by the same post, I got a <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi> with the &#x201C;London&#x201D; written in my Mother&#x2019;s honest old hand. Field-labour was going on well at Scotsbrig too; Isabella more active tho&#x2019; intrinsically little &#x201C;better&#x201D;; the little child still powerless in its leg, but quiet and easy to deal with for the present.</p>
<p>Jane begins to look up a little again, within these two days, since the fierce wind abated. I have ridden diligently for three weeks now; as yet with small or no perceptible benefit. I have resolutely refused all dinings whatsoever (d&#x2019;Orsay, Sir James Clark &#x26;c), and have led the stillest life: but neither does this seem to stead. I pass my days under the abominablest pressure of physical misery,&#x2014;a man forbid!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Macbeth</hi> 1.3.</note> I mean to ride diligently for three complete months; <hi rend="italic">try</hi> faithfully whether in that way my insupportable burden and imprisonment cannot be alleviated into at least the old degree of endurability; and failing <hi rend="italic">that</hi>,&#x2014;I shall pray God to aid me in the requisite decisive measures; for positively my life is black and hateful to me, spent as I am forced to spend it here; I once for all must not and will not continue so. Enough of this;&#x2014;considerably more than enough!</p>
<p>I have settled with Fraser; he mostly demonstrated to me that it was all according to the &#x201C;rules of the trade,&#x201D; in some small points he gave in; was, in every way, fearful to offend,&#x2014;poor devil! The printing too will be done in a week. My Lecture-project hardly advances into clearness; stands waiting for a &#x201C;glimpse of health,&#x201D; which, alas, refuses to arrive. I have serious thoughts of writing them down; then flaming about, over both hemispheres with them (too like a Cagliostroccio!),<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC had written at length in &#x201C;Count Cagliostro&#x201D; about the count&#x2019;s travels through Europe using his &#x201C;miraculous gift of long-eared eloquence&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 28: 489).</note> to earn as much as will buy the smallest <foreign>peculium</foreign> of annuity whereon to retire into some hut by the sea-shore,&#x2014;and there lie quiet till my hour come! We shall see.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-12-90" n="12:90"/>Your Letters <hi rend="italic">are</hi> decidedly very brief! We know only that your money-wages are the best imaginable. God guide you always! <closer><salute>Your affectionate Brother</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Sir</salute>
<p>Thanks for your almanacs and books, for your kind remembrance of me. I am sorry to hear how the cold affects you. I too have got sore throat, and am entirely uncomfortable in such temperature. By the course of Nature and the Almanac, things must mend ere long.</p>
<p>If you have the other volumes of <hi rend="italic">Vasari</hi>,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Giorgio Vasari (<date when="1511-00-00">1511</date>&#x2013;<date when="1574-00-00">74</date>), Italian painter, architect and historian, who wrote an important series of artists&#x2019; biographies, <hi rend="italic">Le Vite de Piu Eccellenti Architetti, Pittori, et Scultori Italiani</hi> (Florence, <date when="1550-00-00">1550</date>).</note> I will take a look of them by and by. A small slip of paper containing a request to that effect went over to you some weeks ago; but I believe it escaped your notice. I am in no haste about <hi rend="italic">Vasari;</hi> nor indeed have I time for it at present, being busied with the Purgatorio of Dante. I have used your English edition so far; but now it leaves me, and now my own is as good as any of the others.</p>
<p>When your friend has done with Jean Paul F Richter,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably either TC&#x2019;s trans. (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 22:117&#x2013;332), his essays on Richter (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 26:1&#x2013;25, 27:96&#x2013;159), or an original work.</note> a lady wants to see it, having fallen in love with the large man.</p>
<p>Pray make my kind compliments to M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Orger,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Orger, Quaker husband (m. <date when="1804-00-00">1804</date>), of Mary Ann Orger (<date when="1788-00-00">1788</date>&#x2013;<date when="1845-00-00">1845</date>), actress, member of the Covent Garden company, and close friend of Hunt&#x2019;s mother-in-law, Mrs. Hunter.</note> and thank him without delay for his gift which &#x201C;T Carlyle, Armiger,&#x201D; (Penniger were better) is justly proud of.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC thought of himself as a &#x201C;pen-bearer&#x201D; (penniger) rather than an armorbearer (armiger), i.e., as an esquire, or someone entitled to bear arms.</note> As it happens, I have no other complete Anacreon, and I rather think no Sappho at all.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date>Sixth</date> and <date>seventh cent. <hi rend="small-caps">b.c.</hi></date> Greek lyric poets.</note> I design to read both; with the not unwelcome help of that English at the foot of the page. M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Orger&#x2019;s esteem of me is as good as a Lord Chancellor&#x2019;s; perhaps better; that of a wise and good man&#x2014;seated not on a woolsack, but a chair.&#x2014;</p>
<p><pb id="pg-12-91" n="12:91"/>Surely I shall see you soon?<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For their meeting at Craik&#x2019;s on <date when="1840-04-08">8 April</date>, see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400408-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1840-04-08">8 April</date></ref>.</note> If you have not the last N<hi rend="italic">o</hi> of the L and Westminister Review I can lend it you for a day.&#x2014; Courage!

<salute>My dear Emerson,</salute>
<p>A Letter has been due to you from me, if not by palpable law of reciprocity, yet by other law and right, for some week or two.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson had written on <date when="1839-12-12">12 Dec. 1839</date> and <date when="1840-03-18">18 March</date>; TC on <date when="1840-01-06">6</date> and <date when="1840-01-17">17 Jan.</date></note> I meant to write so soon as Fraser and I had got a settlement effected. The travelling Sumner<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charles Sumner.</note> being about to return into your neighbourhood, I gladly accept his offer to take a message to you<supplied>[.]</supplied> I wish I had anything beyond a <hi rend="italic">dull</hi> Letter to send! But unless as my Wife suggests, I go and get you a D&#x2019;Orsay <hi rend="italic">Portrait</hi> of myself, I see not what there is! Do you read German or not? I now and then fall in with a curious German volume, not perhaps so easily accessible in the Western world. Tell me. Or do you ever mean to learn it? I decidedly wish you would.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson replied, <date when="1840-04-21">21 April</date>: &#x201C;I have contrived to read almost every volume of Goethe, and I have 55 but I have read nothing else: but I have not now looked even into Goethe for a long time&#x201D; (Slater, <hi rend="italic">CEC</hi> 269); see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18401209-TC-RWE-01">TC to RWE, <date when="1840-12-09">9 Dec.</date></ref></note>&#x2014; As to the D&#x2019;Orsay Portrait, it is a real curiosity: Count D&#x2019;Orsay the emperor of European Dandies pourtraying the Prophet of spiritual <foreign>Sansculottism</foreign>! He came rolling down hither one day, many months ago, in his sun-chariot, to the bedazzlement of all bystanders; found me in dusty grey-plaid dressing-gown, grim as the spirit of Presbyterianism (my Wife said), and contrived to get along well enough with me. I found him a man worth talking to, once and away; a man of decided natural gifts, every utterance of his containing in it a wild caricature <hi rend="italic">likeness</hi> of some object or other; a dashing man, who might, some twenty years sooner born, have become one of Bonaparte&#x2019;s Marshals, and <hi rend="italic">is</hi>, alas,&#x2014;Count D&#x2019;Orsay! The Portrait he dashed off in some twenty minutes (I was dining there, to meet Landor); we have not chanced to meet together since, and <hi rend="italic">I</hi> refuse to undergo any more eight-o&#x2019;clock dinners for such an object.&#x2014; Now if I do not send you the Portrait, after all?<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390802-JWC-JWI-01">JWC to <sic>JW</sic><corr>JWI</corr>, [<date when="1839-08-02">2 Aug. 1839</date>]</ref>.</note></p>
<p>Fraser&#x2019;s account of the <hi rend="italic">Miscellanies</hi> stood legibly extended over <pb id="pg-12-92" n="12:92"/>large spaces of paper, and was in several senses amazing to look upon. I trouble <hi rend="italic">you</hi> only with the result. Two hundred and forty-eight copies<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of the American edn. sent by Emerson.</note> (for there were some one or two &#x201C;imperfect&#x201D;): all these he had sold, at 2 guineas each; and sold swiftly, for I recollect in <date when="1839-12-00">December</date> or perhaps <date when="1839-11-00">November</date> he told me he was &#x201C;holding back,&#x201D; not to run entirely out. Well, of the &#xa3;500 and odds so realized for these Books, the portion that belonged to me was &#xa3;239,&#x2014;the &#xa3;261 had been the expense of handing the ware over the counter, and drawing in the coin for it! &#x201C;Rules of the Trade&#x201D;;&#x2014;it is a Trade, one would surmise, in which the Devil has a large interest. However, not to spend an instant, polluting one&#x2019;s eyesight with that side of it, let me feel joyfully, with thanks to Heaven and America, that I do receive such a sum in the shape of wages, by decidedly the noblest method in which wages could come to a man. Without friendship, without Ralph Waldo Emerson, there had been no sixpence of <hi rend="italic">that</hi> money here. Thanks and again thanks. This Earth is not an unmingled ball of Mud, after all. Sunbeams visit it;&#x2014;mud <hi rend="italic">and</hi> sunbeams are the stuff it has from of old consisted of.&#x2014; I hasten away from the Ledger, with the mere good-news that James is altogether content with the &#x201C;progress&#x201D; of all these Books, including even the well-abused Chartism Book. We are just in the point of finishing our English reprint of the <hi rend="italic">Miscellanies;</hi> of which I hope to send you a copy before long.</p>
<p>And now why do not <hi rend="italic">you</hi> write to me? Your Lectures must be done long ago.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-11/lt-18391208-TC-RWE-01">TC to RWE, <date when="1839-12-08">8 Dec. 1839</date></ref>.</note> Or are you perhaps writing a Book? I shall be right glad to hear of that; and withal to hear that you do <hi rend="italic">not</hi> hurry yourself, but strive with deliberate energy to produce what to you is best. Certainly, I think, a right Book does lie in the man! It is to be remembered also always that the true <hi rend="italic">value</hi> is determined by what we <hi rend="italic">do not</hi> write! There is nothing truer than that now all but forgotten truth; it is eternally true. He whom it concerns can consider it.&#x2014; You have doubtless seen Milnes&#x2019;s review of you. I know not that you will find it to strike direct upon the secret of <hi rend="italic">Emerson</hi>, to hit the nail on the head, anywhere at all; I rather think not. But it is gently, not unlovingly done;&#x2014;and lays the first plank of a kind of pulpit for you here and throughout all Saxondom: a thing rather to be thankful for. It on the whole surpassed my expectations. Milnes tells me he is sending you a copy and a Note, by Sumner. He is really a pretty little robin-redbreast of a man.</p>
<p>You asked me about Landor and Heraud. Before my paper entirely vanish, let me put down a word about them. Heraud is a loquacious scribacious little man, of middle age, of parboiled greasy aspect, whom <pb id="pg-12-93" n="12:93"/>Leigh Hunt describes as &#x201C;wavering in the most astonishing manner between being Something and Nothing.&#x201D; To me he is chiefly remarkable as being still with his entirely enormous vanity and very small stock of faculty,&#x2014;out of Bedlam. He picked up a notion or two from Coleridge many years ago; and has ever since been rattling them in his head, like peas in an empty bladder, and calling on the world to &#x201C;List the music of the spheres.&#x201D; He escaped <hi rend="italic">assassination</hi>, as I calculate, chiefly by being the cheerfullest, best-natured little creature extant. You cannot kill him, he laughs so sof<supplied>[t]</supplied>ly, even when he is like killing you. John Mill said: &#x201C;I forgive him freely for interpreting the universe, now when I find he cannot pronounce the <hi rend="italic">h</hi>&#x2019;s.&#x201D; Really, this is no caricature; you have not seen the match of Heraud in your days. I mentioned to him once that Novalis had said, &#x201C;The highest problem of Authorship is the writing of a Bible.&#x201D;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Quoted by TC from <hi rend="italic">Die Christenheit oder Europa</hi> in &#x201C;Novalis,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 27:43.</note>&#x2014;&#x201C;That is precisely what I am doing!&#x201D; answered the aspiring, unaspirating.&#x2014; Of Landor I have not got much benefit either. We met first, some four years ago, on Cheyne Walk here: a tall broad burly man, with grey hair, and large fierce-rolling eyes; of the most restless impetuous vivacity not to be held in by the most perfect breeding,&#x2014;expressing itself in high-coloured superlatives, indeed in reckless exaggeration, now and then in a dry sharp laugh not of sport but of mockery; a wild man, whom no extent of culture had been able to tame!
His intellectual faculty seemed to me to be weak in proportion to his violence of temper: the judgement he gives about anything is more apt to be wrong than right,&#x2014;as the inward whirlwind shows him this side or the other of the object; and <hi rend="italic">sides</hi> of an object are all that he sees. He is not an original man; in most cases, one but sighs over the spectacle of commonplace torn to rags. I find him painful as a writer; like a soul ever promising to take wing into the AEther, yet never doing it, ever splashing webfooted in the terrene mud, and only splashing the worse the more he strives! Two new tragedies of his that I read lately are the fatallest stuff I have seen for long: not an ingot; ah no, a distracted coil of wire-drawings saleable in no market.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400227-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1840-02-27">27 Feb.</date></ref></note> Poor Landor has left his Wife (who is said to be fool) in Italy, with his children, who would not quit her; but it seems he has honestly surrendered all his money to her except a bare annuity for furnished lodgings;<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Walter Savage Landor m., <date when="1811-00-00">1811</date>, Julia Thuillier; they lived in Italy from <date when="1815-00-00">1815</date>, and separated in <date when="1835-00-00">1835</date>, Landor transferring &#xa3;400 of his annual &#xa3;600 income to her, and his villa and farms at Fiesole to his son Arthur. They had three other children.</note> and now lives at Bath, a solitary sexagenarian, in that manner. <pb id="pg-12-94" n="12:94"/>He visits London in <date when="1840-05-00">May</date>; but says always it would kill him soon: alas, I can well believe that! They say he has a kind heart; nor does it seem unlikely: a perfectly honest heart, free and fearless, dwelling amid such hallucinations, excitations, tempestuous confusions, I can see he has. Enough of him! Me he likes well enough, more thanks to him; but two hours of such speech as his leave me giddy and undone. I have seen some other Lions, and Lion&#x2019;s-<hi rend="italic">providers</hi>; but consider them as worthless species.&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; When will you write, then? Consider my frightful outlook with a Course of Lectures to give &#x201C;On Heroes and Hero-worship&#x201D;&#x2014;from Odin to Rob<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Burns! My Wife salutes you all.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>This morning (while the horse has not yet come, and my &#x201C;studies&#x201D; have ended) I will write you a Letter as short as one of your own; principally to counteract and correct the very sulphurous communication written two days since. I was <hi rend="italic">obliged</hi> to write that day, acknowledging your &#xa3;100; and all else but that acknowledgement might as well, I think, have remained unwritten. I felt a little better next day, or at least I had gathered myself together a little; I galloped as far as Richmond and back again by the loneliest roads discoverable; and tho&#x2019; I did not ride at all yesterday, I still feel in a better key today. With a bright sun shining, and wind enough, I expect to make a beneficial ride again. My Lectures begin to oppress me sore: but riding is the <hi rend="italic">recipe</hi>; I really <hi rend="italic">have</hi> something to say, and tolerable clearness of spirits and nerves is the first and last condition of getting it said. My subject, this time, is not so much historic as didactic; a partly new arrangement; which I must try to get thro&#x2019; as I best may. Next year perhaps I may find myself in condition to <hi rend="italic">omit</hi> Lecturing; perhaps I may have a Book on the anvil; which will be far better. Courage!</p>
<p>Yesterday, Jane had gone out; and so the Letter of Credit, left under her keeping, was not attainable when I left home; wherefore nothing could be done with it. I will go some morning into the City and send it off to Dumfries: one loses a few pence of interest daily (better not lost) by having it lie dormant here. Many kind thanks, once more, for your brotherly behaviour in this matter! I know not <pb id="pg-12-95" n="12:95"/>whether I shall keep the &#xa3;30 yet or not; it is not very momentous which way we decide.&#x2014; Our Library concern will be advertised very soon in the Newspapers: nothing momentous passed yesterday;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The meeting apparently postponed from Sat., <date when="1840-03-28">28 March</date>.</note> they have named me a Secretary, but do not as yet expect me to act at all A right Lending Library here will be an infinite benefit to everybody.</p>

I meant writing to Jean at Dumfries too; but fear it will not do today. Your second little short Note came. Write as briefly, and otherwise how and in what manner, <hi rend="italic">you</hi> find to be best. Half a word is worth sending.

<salute>Dear Mr Wilson,</salute>
<p>I have again some thoughts of inflicting a Course of Lectures on you; the title to be &#x201C;On Heroes, Hero-worship and the Heroic in Human History,&#x201D; or some such thing;&#x2014;beginning with Odin the Norse God, ending (say) with Robert Burns the Scotch Poet! Pray ask Miss Wilson,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jane Wilson; the lectures ended with &#x201C;The Hero as King,&#x201D; and Burns appeared in &#x201C;The Hero as Man of Letters.&#x201D;</note> what she thinks of <hi rend="italic">that?</hi></p>
<p>As it will be necessary in a few days now, I suppose, to decide either for Yes or No, might I not ask of you to look in, some time soon, at the old Lecture-shop in Portman Square, and see how matters stand there;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The lectures were given at 17 Edward St., Portman Sq.</note> to compute for me the times and seasons; to &#x26;c &#x26;c, in your old <pb id="pg-12-96" n="12:96"/>helpful way! The Lectures would be Six in Number; the <hi rend="italic">Book</hi>keeper would be Bookseller <hi rend="italic">Fraser</hi>, this year.</p>
<p>I am riding daily, and cannot, without losing a ride, see any one but those good souls that will come here to see <hi rend="italic">me</hi>,&#x2014;before 2 o&#x2019;clock, or after 5. Yet I will meet you any day, as I ought and must.&#x2014;&#x2014; For the rest, I am the more loath to lose a ride, as I feel deeply, from the nature of this course if it do take effect, that the Lectures will depend more on my horse than me,&#x2014;on the state of my health and spirits, that is to say: literally so!</p>

<salute>My dear Alick,</salute>
<p>The Tobacco came duly, in its little pasted Bag, the inside of which also (tho&#x2019; with some difficulty) I contrived to read;&#x2014;setting then to fill my pipe and raise reek from the contents! It is a precious invention this of the Penny Post.</p>
<p>In quality the Tobacco is altogether of the right sort; if you can get a Permit, I wish you would send it off without a minute&#x2019;s delay. But I understood you to signify that no right Permit could be got? In that case, alas, we cannot stir in the business; but must just be doing as we otherwise can: and I said already, you were not to trouble yourself too much about it.&#x2014; My stock of Pipes is running low too; the Glasgow people make no movement towards supplying me anew: so that I suppose I shall have to send to Edinburgh shortly. You never saw such a smash as the Glasgow box had become;&#x2014;all by their careless packing; which they were <hi rend="italic">bound</hi> to make good again, but will not,&#x2014;the scrubs!</p>
<p>My horse has been in action these four weeks and more; I make her work, when she is at it, galloping many a mile every day. My chief delight is to get <hi rend="italic">out</hi> of the confused whirlpool with its noises, smoke and confusions, altogether; to see quiet cottages and fields; the clear green of Earth intersecting sharply the clear blue of Heaven. It does me real good. I study never to grudge the great expense; to think indeed that it is a profitable needful <hi rend="italic">commercial</hi> outlay, which will come in again in the way of trade. For my Lectures are decidedly to go on. Next letter I hope to send you a printed <hi rend="italic">Prospectus</hi>. The subject is &#x201C;Great Men&#x201D;; or as I have named it, &#x201C;On Heroes, Hero-worship and the Heroic in human History&#x201D;;&#x2014;a great, deep and wide subject, if I were in heart to do it justice. Feeling clearly how indispensible health is towards that, I say always, &#x201C;It depends more on my <hi rend="italic">horse</hi> than on me,&#x201D; and so ride along with unabated alacrity! The country round here is green, fertile, bright and pretty beyond what you could fancy. Not an inch of <pb id="pg-12-98" n="12:98"/>what we call <hi rend="italic">wet</hi> or otherwise bad land in it; all broken into smooth leafy knolls with trim painted houses on them; or stretching in great fertile flats, of black rich mould and dead level, laid out as kitchen-gardens for the monstrous city, as flower-nurseries for the quality who drive out thither. The faults are: There is no <hi rend="italic">clear running water</hi>; there is no possibility of getting an <hi rend="italic">extensive</hi> view. The very Thames with its boats and ships is like a drab-coloured long lake. The best view you have is that of London in the distance (if you be to windward, as I always ride to be); monstrous London, filling half your horizon, like an infinite ocean of smoke, with steeples, domes, and the ghosts of steeples and domes confusedly hanging in it,&#x2014;dim-black under the infinite deep of Blue.&#x2014;&#x2014; My Lectures begin on Tuesday the <date when="1840-05-05">5<hi rend="italic">th</hi> of May</date>, and last on Tuesdays and Fridays for three weeks. I am not quite so terrified this year; but I sometimes calculate, it will be better <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to try it any more in future years; but to write rather, now that I <hi rend="italic">can</hi> get something for my books.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >These were his last lectures.</note> We shall see.&#x2014; The <hi rend="italic">last</hi> sheet of my Printing is just out of my hands, a few minutes ago. The Books will perhaps be ready for the <date when="1840-05-01">1st of May</date> to go with the Magazine Parcels to Edinburgh: in that case I mean to send you all copies. It will be a pretty Book in five volumes.</p>
<p>Nothing came of the Corn-law; but it seems the people have determined on bringing it on again this season. They mean also, in the interim and subsequently, to agitate and stir up all corners of the country by means of Lectures &#x26;c. I fancy there is no doubt at all but they will carry it; <hi rend="italic">when or how</hi>, nevertheless, is but dubious as yet.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The league was not yet strong. TC (who was in close touch with Henry Cole, William Weir, and others) is correct about the &#x201C;people&#x2019;s&#x201D; intentions; see Norman McCord, <hi rend="italic">The Anti-Corn Law League</hi> (London, <date when="1958-00-00">1958</date>) 71&#x2013;90. There had just been a long debate in the House of Commons, <date when="1840-04-01">1</date>&#x2013;<date when="1840-04-03">3 April</date>, on a motion of Charles Villiers, which had changed nothing.</note> One would say, it could not be very long. One would say also, it could not fail to give a great briskness to trade, and make the general population of Britain much better off <hi rend="italic">for some ten years or so</hi>; but <hi rend="italic">if</hi>, in these ten years or so, no steps were taken for improving and regulating the lower classes, why then, it seems to me, there would just be <hi rend="italic">more</hi> Millions of them, as miserable as ever, and no Corn-Bill Abrogation to fall back upon! The very delay in abrogating, nefarious, mad and self-destructive as it seems on the part of the Landlords, is perhaps <hi rend="italic">useful</hi> in this respect; appointed by Providence to continue till the so-called Reformers do learn what Reform really means.</p>
<p>Jack has written little, almost nothing but half-words, of late; we gather only that he is busy, that he is well, and gets immense wages. <pb id="pg-12-99" n="12:99"/>After all, it may perhaps be a question whether this of the wages is so lucky for him. He has no home of his own, poor fellow; and these great sums, earned in that way, are not the thing to stir him up towards resolving to conquer some home for himself. I sent him, the other day, a strange printed quiz of a thing,&#x2014;the cream of my <hi rend="italic">Chartism</hi> done up into Classical verse (the same verse as Homer&#x2019;s) by a certain Cambridge Professor of eminence; a thing one could laugh at for moments.</p>
<p>Jamie wrote to me by the same post as you. Say I will answer before long. Our Mother, I conclude, is still at Dumfries. The rest of you, let us be thankful, seem to be all well. Poor John Aitken! a solitary man; solitary a second time in his old days! I cannot say but I feel a real sympathy with him: he has had a hard life, and gained little by it.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In his letter of <date when="1840-04-04">4 April</date>, James had given farming news, his own and Austin&#x2019;s, who had &#x201C;got his money allright,&#x201D; and mentioned the death of Mrs. Aitken, their aunt.

<p>Jane still complains a little; but ventures out now, hopes to be herself again before long. Her kind love to you all. Is the <hi rend="italic">little</hi> Jane learning her lessons well?

<p><closer><salute>Your affectionate</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC met Leigh Hunt and John Hunter at Craik&#x2019;s house in Brompton this evening, and Hunter described the conversation at length: &#x201C;I never saw Carlyle in such vigour, and was delighted, even when I most differed from him, with the surging floods of his sonorous eloquence &#x2026; illuminated, as they always were, by the coruscations of a splendid fancy, sometimes lurid enough, to be sure, and heated to boiling fervour by the inextinguishable fire of deep emotion that is for ever gnawing his heart and brain. Hunt again was all light and air. &#x2026; I do not mean to make any attempt at giving an account of the conversation. &#x2026; It lasted without interruption from five till near twelve o&#x2019;clock, and embraced the most multifarious subjects. We had the Scottish Kirk, Wordsworth, Petrarch, Burns, Knox and Hume, the Church of England, Dante, heaven and hell, all through our &#x2018;glowing hands&#x2019;; and strange work was made with most of them. I gave some offence to Carlyle, but he recovered from it so swiftly, and redeemed himself so generously, that it heightened my admiration of him. He had been declaiming against Wordsworth, whom he represented as an inferior person to Cowper, adding that from the <foreign><hi rend="italic">d&#xE9;bris</hi></foreign> of Robert Burns a thousand Wordsworths might have been made. We laughed at all this, especially when we found that he had never read, or, at least, had no recollections of &#x2018;Laodamia&#x2019; and various other things in which Wordsworth&#x2019;s finest powers are exhibited. We next came to Petrarch, whom he crushed to a sapless nothing in his grasp. I stood out a good while on this subject, as did Hunt and Craik. At last Carlyle said&#x2014;&#x2018;All I have to say is, that there is one son of Adam who has no sympathy with his weak, washy twaddle about another man&#x2019;s wife. I cast it from me as so much trash, unredeemed by any quality that speaks to my heart and soul. And now you may say whatever you like of him or of me.&#x2019; I answered hastily&#x2014;&#x201C;Then I would say of you that you are to be pitied for wanting a perception which I have, and which I think, and the world in general will think, I am the richer for possessing; and I would just speak of what you have now uttered in these words:&#x2014;<lb/><lb/>
&#x201C;Say, canst thou paint a sunbeam to the blind, Or make him feel a shadow with his mind?&#x201D;&#x2019;<lb/><lb/>
A slight shade passed over his face at this, and he said&#x2014;&#x2018;Well, I admit you are right to think so, whatever I may think of the politeness of your saying it as you have now done.&#x2019; Hunt interposed to the rescue with, &#x2018;Well, that&#x2019;s very good. Carlyle knocks down all our idols with two or three sweeps of his arm, and having so far cleared his way to us, he winds up by knocking down ourselves; and when we cry out against this rough work, he begins to talk of&#x2014;politeness!&#x2019; This was followed by a peal of laughter, in which Carlyle joined with all his heart; and then addressed me cordially and kindly&#x2014;&#x2018;I believe, after all, you are quite right. I ought to envy you. I have no doubt you have pleasures and feelings manifold from which I am shut out, and have shut out myself, in consequence of the habit I have so long indulged of groping through the sepulchral caverns of our being. I honour and love you for the lesson you have taught me.&#x2019; This was felt to be very noble. &#x2018;There is Carlyle all over,&#x2019; said Hunt; &#x2018;that&#x2019;s what makes us all love him. His darkest speculations always come to the light by reason of the human heart which he carries along with him&#x2019;&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Good Words</hi> 23 [<date when="1882-00-00">1882</date>] 102&#x2013;3).</note></p>

<p>You are always very good to me. I calculated on seeing you yesterday, when I had business in Regent Street and then in the City; but, unfortunate man! the Chelsea Hospital Clock told me I was already too late for my engagement with Fraser; that I must walk, as with seven-league boots, and see no face of a friend that bout!

<salute>My dear Sterling,</salute>
<p>In the present vigorous state of the Penny Postage it does often seem to me a blameable anomaly that we should speak to one another so very seldom on paper. The date of your Letter is at a most wasteful distance from that of the preceding one.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Referring to a recent letter from Sterling that has not been found; the last known is of <date when="1839-09-30">30 Sept. 1839</date>.</note> The blame is half mine, you say? Perhaps so, perhaps not; but alas how does that help us either way! Alas, the noise of this insanity of an existence in London City is like to tear me in shreads at any rate; oftenest I can undertake to do nothing whatever but try to hold my peace and keep alive in the middle of it all! Is it not a pity, meanwhile, that the few <hi rend="italic">articulate</hi> voices of our Planet were so widely scattered, at Falmouth and elsewhere; that the smoke of the torment of this my Cockney-Tophet went up in such wise; alas, that our old Planet generally were such a mad old business&#x2014;?&#x2014; One other thing only I shall complain of: the dreadful hand you write; mysterious as Odin&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">runes;</hi> as if one were listening to a loved voice passionately thro&#x2019; the jangle of marrow-bones and cleavers!</p>
<p>Your mood in writing of that Letter is too well known to one other man, my friend! Take comfort: nothing so sinister lies in it; the <hi rend="italic">creative virtue</hi> acts in that manner too,&#x2014;in black whirlwinds and snow and thunder storms, before green worlds and bright summer suns disclose themselves. I fancy that the end of all this, one day or another, one year or another, will be a beautiful <hi rend="italic">Book;</hi> much nearer contenting you than anything you have yet done. Believe it. We think the fruitful <pb id="pg-12-103" n="12:103"/>Earth is <hi rend="italic">doing nothing</hi>, if we do not <hi rend="italic">see</hi> yellow wheat on the surface, and men busy reaping the same. We are fools. The worthy Earth was never idle at all; was busiest of all, when the foolish husbandman, passing by, said that she lay wasting, rotting, an idly unprofitable thing. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Festina lente</hi></foreign> [Make haste slowly] is a word I would write over Sterling&#x2019;s door-posts, and the <foreign><hi rend="italic">lente</hi></foreign> in double roman capitals.</p>
<p>My own winter and spring have passed,&#x2014;I cannot tell you how; I could break forth into excommunicating to tell you how! Proof-sheets, foolish visits, foolish books,&#x2014;not many even of these. <foreign><hi rend="italic">N&#x2019;en parlons pas</hi></foreign> [Let&#x2019;s not speak of it].&#x2014; And now next week comes out a Prospectus of <hi rend="italic">Lectures</hi> to my mind at present one of the fearfullest enterprises man ever engaged in. &#x201C;On Heroes, Hero-worship and the Heroic&#x201D;&#x2014;from Odin down to Robert Burns! Literally so. But you shall have the Prospectus itself next week; suspend your wonder till then.</p>
<p>For above a month past I have had a horse, and been diligently wellnigh daily using it. The world gets green again, the heaven blue again; I feel, often and often, had I but Sterling here!&#x2014;</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Westminster Review</hi> has come into the hands of Cole and Hickson;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On <date when="1840-03-12">12 March</date> Mill had formally made over his interest in the <hi rend="italic">London and Westminster Review</hi> to Henry Cole and William Hickson; see Mineka 13:420&#x2013;24. An undated letter of about <date when="1840-02-00">Feb.</date> or <date when="1840-03-00">early March</date> says: &#x201C;I.H. / Tuesday / Dear Cole / I have seen Robertson once since he saw you. &#x2026; He seemed to me to be neither <hi rend="italic">for</hi> nor <hi rend="italic">against</hi> the plan but to await my decision: now my decision if I consider myself only, will be, whatever becomes of the review, to withdraw myself from it. I have not received any answer from <supplied>[Thomas Wentworth]</supplied> Beaumont, but I cannot be much longer without it: if I do not come to terms with him I will make up my mind once for all. I should like best, in that case, that your schemes should proceed, with some other person than myself as the proprietor. / ever yours / J. S. Mill&#x201D; (MS: Duke, hitherto unpbd.).</note> to be conducted on new principles! What words are adequate? No words.</p>
<p>My Wife has been poorly during all this east wind; is getting better now; busy, this day, making marmalade; sends you and yours many kind salutations. <closer><salute>Blessings with you always, my dear Friend!</salute></closer></p>

</bibl><sourceNote>TC-GEJ, <date when="1840-04-12">12 April</date>. MS: NLS 3823.70. Hitherto unpbd. TC writes in reply to Jewsbury&#x2019;s letter of <date when="1840-04-06">6 April</date> (in J. Rosenmayer&#x2019;s dissertation; see below). Geraldine Endsor Jewsbury (<date when="1812-00-00">1812</date>&#x2013;<date when="1880-00-00">80</date>) was to be a close friend of the Carlyles. At this time she was keeping house in Manchester for her father (a cotton manufacturer), who was seriously ill, and her younger brother, Frank. Her elder sister, Maria Jane (<date when="1800-00-00">1800</date>&#x2013;<date when="1833-00-00">1833</date>; see <ref target="volume-12/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/14815"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), had educated her; and she had two married elder brothers&#x2014;Henry and Thomas&#x2014;and Arthur, who was younger and a problem to the family. She first read TC&#x2019;s essays in <date when="1839-00-00">1839</date>; her father d. late <date when="1840-08-00">August 1840</date>; she met the Carlyles in <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>, and made them an extended visit in <date when="1843-00-00">1843</date>. In <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date> she began her correspondence with JWC. (They agreed to destroy all their letters to each other and only a few of JWC&#x2019;s survive, though many of Jewsbury&#x2019;s.) With JWC and Mrs. Elizabeth Newton Paulet she started collaboration on a work of fiction, <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>. Her novel <hi rend="italic">Zo&#xEB;, The History of Two Lives</hi> was pbd. <date when="1845-00-00">1845</date>; her other works include <hi rend="italic">The Half-Sisters</hi> (<date when="1848-00-00">1848</date>, dedicated to JWC and Mrs. Paulet), <hi rend="italic">Marian Withers</hi> (<date when="1851-00-00">1851</date>), <hi rend="italic">Constance Herbert</hi> (<date when="1855-00-00">1855</date>), <hi rend="italic">The Sorrows of Gentility</hi> (<date when="1856-00-00">1856</date>), <hi rend="italic">Right or Wrong</hi>, and much journalism. She was also a reader for Bentley the publisher. In <date when="1856-00-00">1856</date> she met Walter Mantell (<date when="1820-00-00">1820</date>&#x2013;<date when="1895-00-00">95</date>), with whom she began a voluminous correspondence, much of which still survives. She cultivated the friendship of various distinguished men, including Froude, T. H. Huxley, and Ruskin. The full part she eventually played in the life of the Carlyles and in the controversy about their married life is left to later vols. She collaborated with Lady Morgan on her autobiography (pbd. <date when="1858-00-00">1858</date>), and with W. H. Dixon on Lady Morgan&#x2019;s memoirs (<date when="1862-00-00">1862</date>); d. of cancer and buried in Lady Morgan&#x2019;s vault in Brompton Cemetery.

<p>&#x201C;G. E. J.,&#x201D; whom I will take to be a Lady, of cultivated intellect, of clear conscientious character, between twenty and thirty, describes, <pb id="pg-12-104" n="12:104"/>with energy sincerity and evident truth to Nature, a spiritual history which is very painful, which to those that understand it cannot be other than interesting.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jewsbury had written that she ventured to address TC because she had heard that he was &#x201C;influenced in daily life by the same spirit of kindness which is shewn in your writings,&#x201D; which had &#x201C;only very recently fallen&#x201D; into her hands. &#x201C;Their chief value to me is the hope they have inspired of there being some means of escaping from the paralyzing influence of <hi rend="italic">Materialism</hi>. &#x2026; I did not yield lightly to disbelief&#x2014;but struggled honestly for years to quiet all doubtings, &#x26; to rest satisfied with the explanation generally received. I was brought up a strict <hi rend="italic">Calvinist</hi> &#x26; amongst a set of people who conscientiously discouraged both <hi rend="italic">doubt</hi> &#x26; <hi rend="italic">enquiry</hi>. &#x2026; I tried hard to be a <hi rend="italic">Catholic</hi>, but Materialism <hi rend="italic">once</hi> entertained destroys the very essence of Religion. &#x2026; It is impossible to create a satisfying notion of a <hi rend="italic">Deity</hi>, out of the wreck of Idols and Creeds, wh. have already proved &#x2018;things of no profit,&#x2019; yet to be &#x2018;without God in the World&#x2019; is of all states the most wretched. &#x2026; Your works seem to intimate that <hi rend="italic">you</hi> have at length found some ground of trust and certainty, am I asking more than you will grant, in entreating you to make known, <hi rend="italic">how</hi> you have. &#x2026; If you had not in some sort assumed the attitude of an <hi rend="italic">Instructor</hi>, I wd. not have intruded on you.&#x201D; She explained that she signed the letter with only her initials, but gave her real address. In reply TC drew largely on <hi rend="italic">Sartor Resartus</hi>, and on Goethe insofar as he had drawn on him in <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi>, using many favorite and familiar quotations.</note> She is right in supposing that I have struggled in precisely the same difficulties; and also that now, for a good many years back, I have triumphed over them, and seen them lying conquered, harmless or even beneficial, far enough under me. If G. E. J. persist with humility, with faithfulness, with true silent valour, I will <pb id="pg-12-105" n="12:105"/>confidently prophecy for her also a like victory. It ought to be some consolation to her that such is everywhere the history of persons possessing a certain force of mind in this generation; and that, on the whole, those only are vanquished at last who did not deserve to vanquish; who fought not for the truth, properly speaking, but for their own selfish interest in the truth.</p>
<p>How gladly would one speak a word that might profit such a combatant! There is unfortunately no <hi rend="italic">word</hi> that can be spoken which will assure or even certainly facilitate the victory;&#x2014;bring back <hi rend="italic">belief</hi> into a soul struggling in the dark depths of the fever of scepticism: belief, justly accounted to be itself &#x201C;the only true, god-announcing <hi rend="italic">miracle</hi>.&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Novalis; see Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi> 197n.</note> Will my fair unknown Friend accept of a maxim or two, written down in the midst of endless hurry here, but well enough vindicated by experience to myself, and which carry in them the truest wish to be of service to her.</p>
<p>1. <hi rend="italic">Logic</hi> is no evidence for or against any truth; the things we <hi rend="italic">believe</hi> were not, in any case, brought home to us by <hi rend="italic">argumentation;</hi> by <hi rend="italic">meditation</hi> rather (which was <hi rend="italic">silent</hi>, was beyond words), by practice, by imitation &#x26;c &#x26;c, by a thousand obscure processes, conscious, and oftener <hi rend="italic">un</hi>conscious. The utmost that Logic can do, even <hi rend="italic">Euclid&#x2019;s logic</hi>, is to <hi rend="italic">tell</hi> us what he the Logician did accurately believe; we then try whether we too (made like unto him, as face answereth to face) cannot believe it. There is an endless abuse of Logic in these days; a universal great overvaluing of it &#x201C;The Highest <hi rend="italic">cannot be spoken of in words&#x201D;:</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Goethe, <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister, Works</hi> 24:76.</note> this is one of the most pregnant truths; never to be lost sight of at all.</p>
<p>2. An Inquirer, especially on such matters, generally profits most by getting to discern not the arguments, but the mood of mind, the general way of thought of those whose belief he wishes to attain. Let the earnest sceptic communicate in this way with the works and words of believers. Does G. E. J. read German? I could almost advise her to learn it, if otherwise; indeed I will advise her. In no other Literature whatever is there any notable promulgation of new belief; nowhere else does one get at all into company of men who have belief. Goethe was the wretchedest of materialists once; it was to me like the risen sun to behold clearly that he nevertheless now did believe. Some of Goethe&#x2019;s works are in English. In an English Book called <hi rend="italic">Sartor Resartus</hi>, of my writing, G. E. J. will see shadowed forth under strange emblems a spiritual conflict not unlike her own, even in minute particulars; and discern what wild convulsions others before her have had, <pb id="pg-12-106" n="12:106"/>which nevertheless ended in victory. It is in this way that <hi rend="italic">teaching</hi> of man by man becomes possible.</p>
<p>3. But the great queller of Doubt is above all other things Practice. It is wisely written, &#x201C;Doubt of any kind can only be removed by <hi rend="italic">Action</hi>.&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister, Works</hi> 23:386.</note> The thing one acts upon and finds hold good, that thing is <hi rend="italic">true</hi>, independently of all argument, in spite of all argument. &#x201C;Do the duty which lies nearest hand,&#x201D; which thou discernest clearly to be a duty;&#x2014;the <hi rend="italic">next</hi> duty will already have become clearer!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister, Works</hi> 24:2; also Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi> 196.</note></p>
<p>4. It is well said, in this as in other respects, &#x201C;The beginning of true life is <hi rend="italic">Renunciation</hi>.&#x201D;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister, Works</hi> 24:334; Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi> 191.</note> One must learn to understand that his own poor individual love of ease, satisfaction, pleasure, what we call our &#x201C;happiness&#x201D; (for this world or for the other world) has nothing to do with the matter; one must learn to give up that altogether. That once altogether given up, it is surprising what films straightway fall from the eyes; how the great questions of Immortality and the like become simplified, become clear,&#x2014;as clear as is needful for us. Our own paltry interest in them no longer agitating the mind, the small still voice becomes audible to us.</p>
<p>5. Materialism is at bottom spiritualism.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi> 66&#x2013;67.</note> The highest results of modern Science point out the body, point out matter in general as <hi rend="italic">non-extant</hi>, as a mere <hi rend="italic">manifestation</hi> of what Faith names <hi rend="italic">soul</hi>. Our body is and can be nothing but a &#x201C;complex of forces,&#x201D; to us inscrutable, envesturing and rendering visible the divine mystery in us that calls itself <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;Me&#x201D;</hi>; our body too is &#x201C;a garment woven in the Loom of Heaven.&#x201D;<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Goethe, <hi rend="italic">Faust</hi> 1:501&#x2013;9; Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi> 55.</note> We are bound to say with the Moslem, in this and so many other cases, &#x201C;God is Great. <hi rend="italic">Islam;</hi> I <hi rend="italic">submit</hi> to God.&#x201D;<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See also &#x201C;The Hero as Prophet&#x201D;: &#x201C;That we must submit to God. &#x2026; &#x2018;If this be <hi rend="italic">Islam,&#x2019;</hi> says Goethe, &#x2018;do we not all live in <hi rend="italic">Islam?&#x2019;</hi>&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 5:56).</note></p>
<p>6. In <hi rend="italic">all</hi> senses of the word, Speech is small in comparison to Silence. G. E. J. will grow to understand this. A thing, because it does not speak, because it cannot speak, does not for that fail to <hi rend="italic">exist</hi>. Our Liturgies, Litanies are unspoken ones; of the Deity himself a wise man has said, &#x201C;Who dare <hi rend="italic">name</hi> Him?&#x201D; Let us know the virtue of silence; what unspeakable wealth we may possess which refuses to exhibit itself at the street door.&#x2014; Let us in fine shut our ear against the empty jangle of our own poor sceptical, cackling, barren, utilitarian, logic-chopping, futile, most unfortunate generation; and say to it, &#x201C;Go thou thy loud way; I go my silent one.&#x201D;</p>
<p><pb id="pg-12-107" n="12:107"/>7.

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I am about to employ you on rather a singular commission; which, however, I doubt not you will execute with your wonted good-nature.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-12-108" n="12:108"/>Close folded within this Paper is a card containing a gold half-sovereign. I am in pressing want of <hi rend="italic">Tobacco-pipes;</hi> this small gold coin is to procure me, thro&#x2019; your kindness, Tobacco-pipes from Edinburgh!&#x2014; Down in the Canongate, not far from John Knox&#x2019;s House, there used to dwell and labour that eminent Pipe-maker Thomas White.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In Jack&#x2019;s Close off the Canongate.</note> <hi rend="italic">He</hi>, very probably, is no longer alive; but his representatives, his manufactory, must be still there; and pipes of the same eminent fabric. The kind of pipes I was wont to get there were his <hi rend="italic">best</hi> and <hi rend="italic">biggest;</hi> 3/6 a gross.&#x2014; You now see clearly what it is that I solicit of you?</p>
<p>Having well fixed in your mind that &#x201C;Thomas White&#x201D; or the &#x201C;late Thomas White&#x201D; is the man, and &#x201C;3/6 per-gross&#x201D; the kind,&#x2014;there is nothing more to be added; except the propriety of straitly charging the people to be most careful in the packing; and then to ship by the first Steamer&#x2014;for my hurry is considerable. You must understand, I had ordered from Glasgow no fewer than 5 gross of a still nobler sort of pipes than White&#x2019;s; but the wretched people having packed them in a <hi rend="italic">deep</hi> box (instead of a broad shallow one) and with <hi rend="italic">saw-dust</hi> (in place of fine hay), the whole concern arrived here in the state of dust and ruin, some 45 pipes safe in all: this makes me anxious for speed; anxious too that the Whites may pack better,&#x2014;as indeed they were usually wont to do.</p>
<p>I write in such haste, I hardly know what I have said; but it seems to me you will not fail to decipher what I mean; and I know well you will, in your old manner, set about doing it straightway. As many best pipes as 10/ will buy and pack: that is it.</p>
<p>We are pretty well here; I am to lecture in <date when="1840-05-00">May</date>,&#x2014;a thing that terrifies me somewhat. I ride diligently every day, to get into clearer spirits at least!</p>
<p>We had your friend the Bishop<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Apparently a nickname for the Rev. David Aitken of Minto.</note> lately; who seemed to be immensely refreshed by the smell of our smoke, by the sight and sound of our tumult. It is the way with men! To him the roaring Strand is medicine; to me here Minto Craig seems not unlike a kind of Heaven!&#x2014; Good keep you always; my wife joins in kindest salutations</p>

<salute>Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Your Note<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> came, late on Saturday night; very welcome to me in the absence of news. Jean, who wrote to me last week from Dumfries, conveyed an extract from one of your late Letters to her; giving account of the disposal of your hours, your occupations &#x26;c &#x26;c; which threw considerable light on Pellipar for us.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jean had quoted from John&#x2019;s letter in which he spoke of riding in the day, playing billiards after dinner, and reading German, Latin, and French with his patient as often as he could persuade him to.</note> Go on and prosper there!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Our Mother is still at Dumfries; returning in some ten days by way of Gill. In Annandale all well. Our poor old Uncle John&#x2019;s poor old wife is dead at Dumfries; he is &#x201C;alone again&#x201D;: <hi rend="italic">her</hi> death, I understand was a relief to to all parties.&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; I sent off <hi rend="italic">seventy pounds</hi> of your <hi rend="italic">hundred</hi> to the care of my Mother and J<hi rend="italic">s</hi> Aitken at the Commercial Bank to be deposited there in your name, as requested by you. They will complete the transaction on Wednesday I expect; you shall then hear.</p>
<p>Jane gets better. I am sometimes terribly out of heart; then I rally again to great lengths. I ride diligently every day. I have determined not to accept <hi rend="italic">any</hi> invitation till my Lectures end. I am actually writing (say rather <hi rend="italic">splashing</hi> and shovelling) them down on paper; with intent to <hi rend="italic">speak</hi> them nevertheless.&#x2014; Printing is done, thank Heaven! The Cole and Hickson brotherhood came here the other night to offer me for my Lectures that they would hire a first-rate Gurney reporter (price &#xa3;30),<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A reporter using Thomas Gurney&#x2019;s system of shorthand, originally pbd. in his <hi rend="italic">Brachygraphy</hi> (London, <date when="1750-00-00">1750</date>).</note> and then give me &#xa3;50 for the privilege of printing what he made out in <hi rend="italic">their</hi> Westminster Review!&#x2014; <hi rend="small-caps">Rejected</hi>!&#x2014; I really do think of reporting however, of printing and publishing: perhaps it had been better to make it wholly a <hi rend="italic">Book</hi> from the first.&#x2014; I enclose you today a Letter of Thomas Erskine&#x2019;s about the poor weaver:<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Erskine&#x2019;s letter of <date when="1840-04-07">7 April</date> about his visit to William Bowie; see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400123-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, [<date when="1840-01-23">23 Jan.</date>]</ref>. He ended by saying that he hoped to get to London to hear the forthcoming lectures: &#x201C;It is long since I have seen you and Mrs. Carlyle&#x201D; (A. J. Symington, <hi rend="italic">Some Personal Reminiscences of Carlyle</hi> [Paisley and London, <date when="1886-00-00">1886</date>] 48).</note> you can send it on to my Mother; she expects it. <foreign>Adieu</foreign> dear Jack!

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Late on Saturday night, after I had written to Jean, came this very small Letter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> from our Doctor. There has nothing since come. It is better than nothing at all,&#x2014;which I bethink me has perhaps been your share. I will send it, at the small charge of one penny! A few minutes still remain to me after finishing my <hi rend="italic">task</hi> for the day; I have a pen and a sheet of paper: why should I not send it, with a word or with only half a word of my own?</p>
<p>My Lecture Prospectuses are probably printed, and lying at Fraser&#x2019;s; none of them have come down here yet, or I would enclose you one. I was to omit riding this very day, and go up to Fraser to see about them; but in the morning a certain Mr Marshall (son of the <hi rend="italic">Donor</hi> of the Horse) sent a Letter to say he would come and ride with me; so I must put Fraser off till tomorrow. For the last two days, I have taken, as a kind of relief, to splashing down upon paper, at great length, and quite off-hand, as fast as the pen will go, whatsoever thing I <hi rend="italic">might</hi> speak in the course of these same Lectures: it will help me at least to speak <hi rend="italic">some</hi>thing when I come to the place! I still mean to <hi rend="italic">speak</hi>, however, and in no wise to <hi rend="italic">read;</hi> I have found out by trial that I <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> read, that I have not <hi rend="italic">p<supplied>[l]</supplied>ayactor</hi> enough in me for that. I must <hi rend="italic">give</hi> the people what <hi rend="italic">is in me</hi> at the time, be it good or bad.</p>
<p>You would probably see the advertisement in last <hi rend="italic">Examiner;</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sunday, <date when="1840-04-12">12 April</date>.</note>&#x2014;or rather you <hi rend="italic">will</hi> probably, tomorrow. You shall get a Prospectus too by and by. Nay who knows but you may see the Lectures themselves, this time! There is a kind of speculation about having them taken in short-hand, and printed as a volume with corrections. A certain Review-Editor (the <hi rend="italic">new</hi> Editor of the <hi rend="italic">Westminster</hi>&#x2014;for Mill has given it up) came to me the other day, with a proposal to have a short-hand reporter of his own, and print the result in his review, and give me&#x2014;&#xa3;50. It was &#xa3;80 in all, he said; for the reporter (if first-rate) would cost about &#xa3;30! I <hi rend="italic">rejected</hi> this proposal totally, without hesitation;&#x2014;the said <hi rend="italic">new</hi> Editor&#x2019;s being a decided <hi rend="italic">Dud</hi> was reason enough for that, had there <pb id="pg-12-111" n="12:111"/>been no other.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably Hickson, who joint-ed. the first issue of the <hi rend="italic">Westminster Review</hi> 34 (<date when="1840-06-00">June 1840</date>) with Cole.</note> Yet we shall see what comes of it, on some other side. The Reporter will hardly get &#xa3;30 from me, I think; one would rather try to report it oneself.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I ride with as much diligence as ever. We have beautiful bright weather; today perfect summer. Jane is better; she is out today, up into the Town, an hour ago, far and wide. The riding surely does me <hi rend="italic">good</hi> too; tho&#x2019; it does not<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;So far a letter of mine to my Mother: stops abruptly;&#x2014;and my Dear One continues: white line&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note).</note></p>
<p>At this point came a Tailor with patterns for trowsers, who was followed by the Marshalls male and female<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;I remember very well the small insignif<hi rend="italic">t</hi> fract<hi rend="italic">n</hi> of this ride; to Dulwich, James Marshall &#x26; the Sister that became Lady Monteagle: still alive these two, gen<hi rend="italic">lly</hi> quite far from me&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note). James Garth Marshall and Mary Anne Marshall, who m. Thomas Spring Rice, 1st Baron Monteagle, in <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>.</note> to ride with him&#x2014;and the letter is brought to me to finish and <hi rend="italic">me</hi> cannot finish it for here is company&#x2014;never mind I will write a word myself in a day or two</p>

<salute>My dear Sterling,</salute>
<p>There was nothing wrong in our correspondence, so far as the Postman stood concerned: he, poor man, had done faithfully what little duty we entrusted to him. My phraseology had misled you; it did not mean that I had written more, but that you, with your gifts, opportunities, &#x26;c, &#x26;c (had Fortune aided) should not have written so little! It meant, at bottom, that I desire excessively to be spoken to, by a character like you,&#x2014;provided you would ask no speech from me; a modest desire; beseeming the Harpocrates-Stentor you were once pleased to say was my name.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400411-TC-JOST-01">TC to <sic>JS</sic><corr>JOST</corr>, <date when="1840-04-11">11 April</date></ref>. Sterling&#x2019;s letter, to which this is TC&#x2019;s reply, has not been found. Harpocrates came to be regarded by the Greeks and Romans as a god of silence; Stentor, the loud-voiced Greek warrior in the <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi>.</note></p>
<p>Here is a Lecture-Prospectus; sufficient to create some apprehension <pb id="pg-12-112" n="12:112"/>in the old River, I hope.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Fear by the Thames of being set on fire; proverbial.</note> Poor old fellow, he escapes unnumerable risks, with that ominous potentiality of his; but still remains in fact <hi rend="italic">un</hi>burnt.&#x2014; For avoiding ruts, and all other mischances, what hope have I!

The summer has burst forth suddenly; in a few days, the woods will all have their new jackets on; already it is a very blessedness to see the unfathomable blue above one, the young green around,&#x2014;and London lying like a great black <hi rend="italic">Malebolge</hi>, filling only half the Heaven, at a safe distance from one.

<p>That I may not altogether break my word&#x2014;I send this scrawl to bid you possess your soul in patience and hope better things another day  This warm weather sends all the people out like swarms of bees, so that when I am not out myself I have next to no peace at home&#x2014;but it is blessed weather and makes me feel already twenty degrees better&#x2014; <pb id="pg-12-113" n="12:113"/>Carlyle rides and has got all his bile jumbled up into a rather alarming state of activity&#x2014;for those about him. surely however all this riding must do him good in the long run&#x2014;</p>
<p>I have never yet been on the beasts back for influenza and one devilry after another&#x2014;but yesterday I actually bought myself a <hi rend="italic">riding cap</hi>&#x2014;which looks as if I were seriously meaning something<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC went riding for the first time on <date when="1840-04-18">18 April</date>.</note>&#x2014; When I rode in Towns formerly it was in a little man&#x2019;s hat but I find there are some things which years make a decided difference in and ones head gear is among them&#x2014; My Cap <hi rend="italic">suits</hi> better&#x2014;it is of cl<supplied>[oth]</supplied> and has a little brim in front and long tassel at one side&#x2014;</p>
<p>I have no fear about the lectures this year whatever I may have about the lecturer&#x2014; The subject is a fine one&#x2014;he has well reflected on it&#x2014;and has already <hi rend="italic">clashed</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Annandale for &#x2018;dashed,&#x2019; &#x2018;flung out hastily as from a pail&#x2019;&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note).</note> out matter enough on paper to carry him triumphan<supplied>[t]</supplied>ly thro&#x2014;</p>
<p>Excuse the black paper which I hope will not give you a fright M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Sterling has no other&#x2014;excuse also my unsatisfactoriness in consideration that I am writing in the midst of company Give my kindest love to Jane and James&#x2014;<closer><salute>and believe me ever in hurry and out of it your affectionate</salute></closer></p>

<p>Let all that love me keep far away on occasions of that kind. I am in no case so sorry for myself as when standing up there bewildered, distracted, nine-tenths of my poor faculty lost in terror and wretchedness, a spectacle to men. It is my most ardent hope that this exhibition may be my last of such; that Necessity, with her bayonet at my back, may never again drive me up thither, a creature more fit for uttering himself in a flood of inarticulate tears than any other way.</p>
<p>Time does not reconcile me to this immeasurable, soul-confusing uproar of a life in London. I meditate passionately many times to fly <pb id="pg-12-114" n="12:114"/>from it for life and sanity. The sound of the clear brooks, of woody solitudes, of sea-waves under summer suns; all this in one&#x2019;s fancy here is too beautiful, like sad, forbidden fruit. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Cor irrequietum est</hi></foreign> [The heart is restless].

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I may as well write to you half a word, in imitation of your own Letter last but one,&#x2014;for there is &#x201C;no chance till Monday&#x201D; otherwise. I have finished a great quantity of scribbling today already (my daily <hi rend="italic">task</hi>); Jane is out to <hi rend="italic">ride</hi>, for the first time, with Forster; I can deduct five minutes from my walk, and serve myself and you. I have had various interruptions today; but my task is <hi rend="italic">done</hi>.</p>
<p>What you say of speech upon an object <hi rend="italic">disgusting</hi> one with writing or working farther on it,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In one of John&#x2019;s lost letters.</note> is eminently true. I feel it to be so. I have fallen upon a kind of plan in consequence. Daily for some week past, I have taken out paper, to be written upon <hi rend="italic">only on one side</hi>. I there <hi rend="italic">splash</hi> down (literally as fas<supplied>[t]</supplied> as my pen will go) some kind of paragraph on some point or other of my <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;Course&#x201D;</hi> that has b<supplied>[een]</supplied> salient and visible to me; paragraph after paragraph, till at least 4 pages daily <pb id="pg-12-115" n="12:115"/>are full: in this way I put down legibly, if not something that I shall say, yet something that I might and should say. I can clip the paragrap<supplied>[h]</supplied>s out, and string them together any way I like. I am independent or nearly so of Reporters. I shall be the better able to <hi rend="italic">speak</hi> of the things written of even in this way. It seems the best I can do.</p>
<p>My riding must certainly do me good! It stirs up a great increase of <hi rend="italic">movement</hi> in the inner man of me; nothing decisively more as yet. I took a <hi rend="italic">blue pill</hi> the night before last. I feel <hi rend="italic">clearer;</hi> loquacious,&#x2014;alas, getting into a <hi rend="italic">fire</hi> again, I suppose! There is no help for it&#x2014; I will do these Lectures; and then hope never to do any more in the world.</p>
<p>No word from Dumfries yet, about your &#xa3;70 or otherwise,&#x2014;except indeed the <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi> with its usual strokes which went off to you yesterday.</p>
<p>Mrs Anthony Sterling is for Canada in <date when="1840-06-00">june</date>. She seems to me very poorly; especially in her <hi rend="italic">spiritual</hi> health!&#x2014; A serious-looking accident that to <hi rend="italic">your</hi> patient; yet who knows whether it may not in the long-run do good?<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John had written to his sister Jean on <date when="1840-04-15">15 April</date> saying that William Ogilby had recovered from a severe fall when riding.</note>&#x2014; Striking 3 o&#x2019;clock!</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Miscellanies</hi> and 2<hi rend="italic">nd</hi> edit<hi rend="italic">n</hi> of <hi rend="italic">Chartism</hi> out next week.&#x2014;</p>

<salute>My dear Alick,</salute>
<p>Why not send you one of my Prospectuses, and word that we are well,&#x2014;even tho&#x2019; I can do nothing more? These four days I have meant to do it; but I am busy every minute of my morning till 2 o&#x2019;clock when the horse comes; and then after dinner I am so sluggish, worn out, unable to do anything. Take this, in good part! You perhaps even do not hear of Jack, for our Mother I suppose is still at Dumfries. I send two Letters of his,&#x2014;as short as Letters can be. No I exclude <hi rend="italic">one</hi> of the letters too weighty; meaning &#x201C;all well&#x201D; (patient recovered again from fall).<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC inserted this sentence after the word &#x201C;two&#x201D; in the preceding sentence.</note></p>
<p>My own task at present consists in <hi rend="italic">writing</hi> as fast as my pen will go, all day from breakfast (about 8 or 9) till 2 o&#x2019;clock. I write down what I <hi rend="italic">might</hi> say in my Lectures; it will assist me in what I <hi rend="italic">shall</hi> get to say; for all seem agreed that I must <hi rend="italic">speak</hi> my Discourses, that reading will entirely ruin the charm and meaning of them. So I <hi rend="italic">clash</hi> [dash] away and write; &#x201C;lick for lash thro&#x2019; the Rickergate&#x201D;!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18361202-TC-JAC-01"><sic>9:102</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1836-12-02">2 Dec. 1836</date></corr></ref>.</note> Perhaps we may <pb id="pg-12-116" n="12:116"/>print some of them by and by! In a month I shall have done with the thing any way; and I hope very much (and indeed almost resolve) I may <hi rend="italic">never</hi> meddle with it again.</p>
<p>Jane is quite well again; the weather is sunny and good,&#x2014;terribly dry; but clouds are gathering this day, and we <hi rend="italic">hope</hi>.&#x2014; I have sent for pipes from Edin<hi rend="italic">r;</hi> I expect them this week. The tobacco continues tolerable here; if the wretched Exciseman will <hi rend="italic">not</hi> act, do not disturb yourself much: poor <hi rend="italic">dud</hi>, I suppose it is a kind of pleasure to him perhaps that he can stand in anybody&#x2019;s way; <hi rend="italic">act</hi> upon anybody even in that poor style.&#x2014; Good luck to you, dear Brother, and good b&#x2019;ye! Send my news to Scotsbrig; say there was seldom man so busy. I bid good be with you one and all;&#x2014;shall have more time soon. <closer><salute>Yours ever</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Alick,</salute>
<p>I sent you off a scrawl of a line or two yesterday, and stuck it in at the Battersea Post-Office as I went out to ride. Tho&#x2019; almost still <hi rend="italic">more hurried</hi> today, I must needs write were it but <hi rend="italic">half</hi> a word. The Tobacco is come, my boy! All safe and sound; bottled up in your canister, in my old jug, and set into presses, it stands here, and will keep me smoking for long! The cost I think was just 4 shillings here. Alick Welsh seemed to have addressed it. How it got across to him I do not know; but here it is&#x2014;all right; and the Lockerby Gauger, and all manner of functionaries like him, may go fiddle!&#x2014;I had gone out last night to consult with Fraser; and at my return, Jane had opened the Box and there it was.</p>
<p>But another curious thing happened yesterday. When I came home from riding, the Edinburgh Pipes were standing in the lobby! Could anything be more <hi rend="italic">seasonable</hi>&#x2014;since the weed itself was so near arriving? I broke open the box; found the packing excellent, almost no breakages at all; 3 gross as I judge of the same kind of Pipes I used to have at Puttock (you remember), a very good kind.&#x2014; One &#x201C;Sam Aitken&#x201D; a very kind Edinburgh man had taken the trouble to get them: I wrote him enclosing a half sovereign, and here they were.&#x2014; We shall surely be at rest now for a while on the <hi rend="italic">smoke</hi> side! Thanks to you, many thanks;&#x2014;and congratulations now too, that your friendly pains have not been disappointed of their purpose.</p>
<p>I scribble away at my Lectures; refuse <hi rend="italic">all invitations</hi> whatsoever, <pb id="pg-12-117" n="12:117"/>till the Lectures be done. One can manage without offence in that way. I ride too; I will ride and write: what can I do more? This day five weeks it will all be over, one way or other; and I shall try <hi rend="italic">never to do the like again</hi>.</p>
<p>Fraser has got the Book out; a very pretty green Book, in five volumes (&#x201C;Carlyle&#x2019;s Miscellanies&#x201D;).<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Critical and Miscellaneous Essays: Collected and Republished</hi>, 5 vols. (London, <date when="1840-00-00">1840</date>), the first British edn. The next day TC wrote in his Journal: &#x201C;Work ruined for this day,&#x2014;imprudently expressed complaints in the morning filled all the sky with clouds;&#x2014;portending <hi rend="italic">grave</hi> issues? or only inane ones? &#x2026; I have been <hi rend="italic">throwing</hi> my Lectures upon paper. &#x2026; I know not what will come of them: in twelve days now we shall see! <hi rend="italic">Miscellanies</hi> out; and <hi rend="italic">Chartism</hi> [second thousand, which Fraser calls second edition&#x2014;tho&#x2019; it only differs from the first by a few corrections of the Press]: <hi rend="italic">if</hi> I were a little healthier, ah me, all were well!&#x2014;&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s brackets).</note> He had been <hi rend="italic">subscribing</hi> it (offering it to the Booksellers, to see how many they would <hi rend="italic">take</hi> in the first place); he had begun that process yesterday;&#x2014;and was all in the clouds, poor Fraser, at the great speed he had come: &#x201C;above twice as many as he expected,&#x201D; &#x26;c, &#x26;c. Poor James is easily elevated, easily depressed.&#x2014; I hope to send you all copies of this Book (if I can); probably by the Magazine: next month.</p>
<p>Jean sent me a Letter today from Dumfries; our Mother it seems is back again; still well. My continual love to her,&#x2014;to all of you! <hi rend="italic">She</hi> is to write soon herself, as I hear with pleasure.</p>
<p>Two o&#x2019;clock <hi rend="italic">struck!</hi> I have still to dress myself. Not another word!</p>

<salute>Dear Miss Jewsbury,</salute>
<p>Your good modest, earnest, intelligent Letter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1840-04-18">18 April</date>, thanking him for his letter of <date when="1840-04-12">12 April</date>, telling TC more about herself, and asking for further guidance in reading trans. from German, which she meant to start learning.</note> gives me great pleasure. I predict for you a joyful victory one day over all those spiritual troubles. There is no doubt of it, if you persist with humble fidelity, with honest valour. They are properly a <hi rend="italic">disease</hi> of the soul these things; doubt is always a disease; we are not here to doubt and ask, but to see and do. Yet they are a disease, like so many others, of a noble sort; better than many sorts of health! I call them the struggle of the mind to <hi rend="italic">grow;</hi> great is the reward of those in whom they issue in new health. All <hi rend="italic">expansion</hi>, in all things, animals, trees, everywhere thro&#x2019; organic Nature, is it not a kind of disease? As I say sometimes, the bird is sick in moulting-time; the Phoenix has to <hi rend="italic">burn</hi> herself before she can become new and young again.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See, for example, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi> 3:ch. 5.</note> Fear nothing, dear young friend, except your own impatience of heart: one&#x2019;s own poor <hi rend="italic">egoism</hi>, hungry love of happiness &#x26;c, is the only thing one has to fear. I rejoice to believe that you are <hi rend="italic">not</hi> one of those for whom such noble disease is appointed to end not in health, victory, enlargement, but in chronic sickness, in mere hollow truce, or peace by surrender. I think you are not one of these; it is your own blame if you are. I bid you hope and struggle: struggle faithfully, and your hope is sure; no true soul need perish in such conflict. God assist you in it. God will assist you;&#x2014;why should I not say so in these words? For He is in the heart and inmost life of <pb id="pg-12-119" n="12:119"/>every one of us: I know no better <hi rend="italic">name</hi> yet for what we may all discern to <hi rend="italic">be</hi> verily there, if we will look truly.</p>
<p>Having literally no time at all in these days, with special causes of haste and confused labour all heaped round me for some weeks to come,&#x2014;I rather write you a short word about those German Books, than no word. I will name a work or two. Take my advice not as a <foreign><hi rend="italic">nostrum</hi></foreign>, or medical <hi rend="italic">recipe</hi>, for there is none such; but try it, see how it acts with you; follow it so far as it proves to lead you well.</p>
<p>By far the most instructive of German, or indeed of modern European men, the man above all others from whom an ingenuous gifted mind may hope to learn, is Goethe. Like all great men he has his own element, his own dialect every way, and is by no means to be understood at once; nevertheless I would advise you to persevere till you do understand him. His <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister</hi>, both the <hi rend="italic">Apprenticeship of Meister</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Travels of Meister</hi> I translated long ago; a second improved edition, combining both as one Book, was published here last autumn. I advise you to read that. You will find much to repel you, at first; but be not discouraged; insist on becoming acquainted with the world of this man. The <hi rend="italic">Apprenticeship</hi> especially is like to distress you: yet look at it; see how a Sceptic has abolished and got quite rid of his old sceptic entanglements; lives in a new universe, once more green and hopeful;&#x2014;if you even find it a godless Old-Heathen world, yet rejoice to see how in a true human soul Faith is compatible even with that! I know no Book at all of these generations, in which the workings, maladies, confused strugglings of poor human nature are more significantly set forth.
It is true with a deep truth. That great deep <hi rend="italic">mirror</hi>-mind is really as a mirror in which other minds may see their own likeness, find some interpretation of themselves. Of the common objections made to the <hi rend="italic">Apprenticeship</hi>, that it is &#x201C;immoral,&#x201D; unfit for a lady &#x26;c &#x26;c, I say nothing at all to <hi rend="italic">you;</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >This was a common criticism, as in De Quincey&#x2019;s reviews of <date when="1824-00-00">1824</date> and <date when="1825-00-00">1825</date>; but TC had done much to make Goethe acceptable to British taste, somewhat doubtful of his morality. Even so, Caroline Fox&#x2019;s journal (<date when="1841-10-16">16 Oct. 1841</date>) shows that John Sterling still saw <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister</hi>, which &#x201C;abounds with indecorums, but contains no immoralities,&#x201D; as unfit for young ladies (<hi rend="italic">Memories of Old Friends</hi>, ed. H. N. Pym [London, <date when="1882-00-00">1882</date>] 142). Yet there had been no doubt of Goethe&#x2019;s fitness for JWC in <date when="1822-00-00">1822</date>.</note> an earnest reader will find of himself that there need and should nothing be said about them. You, with your prudence, may avoid speaking of the Book, or intimating your acquaintance with it,&#x2014;if your circle seem to prescribe that. The <hi rend="italic">Travels</hi> again, a Book of still clearer and purer Faith, not godless now or heathen, but Christian we might say (<hi rend="italic">inclusive</hi> of Christianity and whatever we have of highest in our modern way of thought) will perhaps <pb id="pg-12-120" n="12:120"/>please you still more readily.&#x2014; At all events, I should say, get acquainted with this man; try whether there is in him nothing that will suit you, that will illuminate and direct you.</p>
<p>Jean Paul Friedrich Richter is another great German brother-soul; full of fearless denial, yet of free sure faith;&#x2014;wide as the world itself, rude, deep, artless magnificent, great as the world! Unfortunately he is very difficult to read; and there is nothing of him in English but a very poor sample, entitled I think &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Selections</hi>&#x201D; (published last year by Black and Armstrong here) mostly extravagant sentimental, not worth seeking after; and another rather poor specimen translated by me many years ago, and to be found in the third volume of a Book called <hi rend="italic">German Romance</hi>. One Chales attempted to translate his <hi rend="italic">Titan</hi> into French;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">The Death of an Angel and other pieces translated from the works of J. F. Richter (Specimens from the works</hi> &#x2026;), A. Kenney (London, Dresden [printed], and Leipzig, <date when="1839-00-00">1839</date>); &#x201C;Army-Chaplain Schmelzle&#x2019;s Journey to Flaetz&#x201D; and &#x201C;Life of Quintus Fixlein,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 22:131&#x2013;332. <hi rend="italic">Titan</hi>, 2 vols.

<p>Tieck is not a man of Religion; but he is a true disciple of Poetry, which one finds, in that sense of it, closely united with Religion. Read what of Tieck you can come at. Something of him is in that same <hi rend="italic">German Romance;</hi> the Rev<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Julius Hare translated some other things of his; and still others, if I mistake not, are extant in English.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Johann Ludwig Tieck (<date when="1773-00-00">1773</date>&#x2013;<date when="1853-00-00">1853</date>), <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 21:255&#x2013;382.

He shadows out, with clearness and brevity, some of the best German ideas on the history of religion: who knows but he might throw light on a point or two for you? At all events, read it if you can conveniently fall in with it: one is never wrong, reading the word of an earnest gifted man.</p>
<p>I do not much recommend German Philosophy, still less German Theology; or indeed Theology, Philosophy or Metaphysical logic of any kind or country. The good I got out of much earnest study of German Philosophy was to find that French and Scotch Philosophy <pb id="pg-12-121" n="12:121"/>(with its Atheisms, Materialisms) was thereby met in the teeth and scientifically <hi rend="italic">neutralised</hi> and ended;&#x2014;that in a word the soul-confusing jargon of Metaphysics, &#x201C;circulating like a self-creating self-swallowing <hi rend="italic">mahlstrom</hi>,&#x201D;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi> 33.</note> was thereby swept out of my mind, and I forever clear of it! In late years I have grown more and more to regard all Metaphysics as a <hi rend="italic">disease</hi>,&#x2014;a fever-fire for burning out of scepticism;<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. &#x201C;Characteristics,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 28:40.</note> I find that solid strong men (Goethe, Shakspeare, Johnson, Napoleon, Luther &#x26;c) would never meddle much with them;&#x2014;that to me, at least, the whole thing was as a spasmodic paralysis, one limb strained convulsively <hi rend="italic">against another</hi>, and no <hi rend="italic">way</hi> at all to be made while that lasted!&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>You do right wisely, dear young Lady, to keep these struggles, these discoveries and miseries of yours altogether a secret from those about you, who cannot help you in them, whom you would but afflict by them. It is altogether just, wise, necessary even. In silence! With lips closed, with eye, mind and heart open! Go<supplied>[od]</supplied> Influences will be with you.</p>
<p>If I at any time can help you in any way whatever, write to me frankly as to an elder brother.</p>

<salute>My dear Alick,</salute>
<p>Your Letter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> of Saturday night rather alarmed me; I have been looking for the Postman this morning with unusual anxiety. He has now called,&#x2014;with nothing but a harmless Newspaper; I take courage to believe that our dear Mother is better again, getting round at least, and not in a state that gives you uneasiness. You did well to write: it is good to have at all times the assurance that when we hear <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> there has nothing very specially gone wrong. But you must write now, were it only one word more, to assure me by affirmation as well as silence that our M<supplied>[oth]</supplied>er is better again. Or she will perhaps write to me herself? One way or other, <supplied>[I]</supplied> expect a word by return of post, if no conclusive word have arrived <hi rend="italic">before</hi> that.</p>
<p>The Newspaper I got (five minutes ago) was a <hi rend="italic">Bolton Free Press</hi>, containing some thing about <hi rend="italic">W. Meister</hi>, me, my Lectures and so <pb id="pg-12-122" n="12:122"/>forth.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> I sent it round by James Aitken, addressed to <hi rend="italic">you</hi>. I suppose he will know to forward it.&#x2014; I marked in Fraser&#x2019;s on Saturday a copy of the <hi rend="italic">Miscellanies</hi> for each one of your households, you, Jamie, Mary, Jenny, Jean<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mary&#x2019;s set was inscribed &#x201C;To my sister, Mary Austin, with affectionate regards.

I wish you all luck of them! It is a very pretty book; five <hi rend="italic">green</hi> ornamented volumes.&#x2014; I enclose today a Letter of poor old Hone&#x2019;s (you remember Hone?)<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Hone; see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400111-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, [<date when="1840-01-11">11 Jan.</date>]</ref>.

Hone wrote: &#x201C;My Dear Sir / I am a Cripple, but I purpose to return, or rather acknowledge, your kindness, by attending your lectures. How you came to send a Ticket to me &#x2026; I can only conjecture. Perhaps my friend Robert Fletcher mentioned me to you as being a Hero-worshipper, whether of a poor old woman or of Thomas Carlyle. / Let me laugh, under the influence of a bright sun, &#x26; your enclosure in an envelope addressed to me <hi rend="italic">Esqr&#x2014;!</hi> Laugh with me, &#x26; be still a friend to the helpless. / I had abandoned all thoughts of your lectures&#x2014;all wishes to hear them&#x2014;for after a solemn review of my few Books I could not spare enough to realize a guinea for a Ticket&#x2014;and this morning I find myself an Esquire worth a guinea! / Thanks, thanks, / My dear Sir, / Thrice thanks / W Hone.&#x201D; TC&#x2019;s gift of a ticket for the whole lecture series is mentioned by Thomas Hughes, <hi rend="italic">Memoir of Daniel Macmillan</hi> (London, <date when="1882-00-00">1882</date>) 91&#x2013;92, who says that Hone could attend only the last lecture. He met TC, who recalled how he used to see Hone&#x2019;s books, at home, twenty years before.</note>&#x2014;to whom I had sent a ticket, knowing he was poor and an admirer of mine. He writes not like a <hi rend="italic">happy</hi> man.</p>
<p>The weather has suddenly become burning hot. All my riding refuses to bring me into very eminent health: I agree ill with the heat, with the anxiety &#x26;c &#x26;c; however, I have floundered thro&#x2019; such a thing in <hi rend="italic">worse</hi> case before now. Jane says, I shall never lecture again. A good part of the thing is lying confusedly on paper; perhaps we <hi rend="italic">shall</hi> print it.</p>
<p>No word from Jack last week, that I remember of. My last account of him was in a Note which Jean forwarded hither, in which he spoke of having written to you.&#x2014; Jane has a headache today; but this weather generally quite sets her up.&#x2014; <closer><salute>Ever your affectionate</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I have forwarded your Letter to Craik, who, I doubt not, will respond directly. His Address, should he forget it again, is &#x201C;Vine Cottage, Old Brompton.&#x201D;</p>
<p>I am so busy I can hardly get a word uttered to anybody! Be content with the following <hi rend="italic">semi</hi>-articulations.</p>
<p>The Advocates&#x2019; Library is understood to have been instituted under the guidance of Sir George Mackenzie, a Lord Advocate celebrated in the time of Charles II and afterwards.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sir George Mackenzie (<date when="1636-00-00">1636</date>&#x2013;<date when="1691-00-00">91</date>), lawyer; educated at St. Andrews, Aberdeen, and Bourges univs.; called to the bar at Edinburgh, <date when="1659-00-00">1659</date>; reviled in Scottish history for his persecution of the Covenanters and immortalized as the &#x201C;Bloody Mackenzie&#x201D; of &#x201C;Wandering Willie&#x2019;s Tale&#x201D; in Scott&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Redgauntlet</hi> (<date when="1824-00-00">1824</date>). After his appointment as dean of the faculty of advocates, he enthusiastically worked for the library, which he opened in <date when="1689-03-00">March 1689</date>.</note> It contains now somewhat between 100 and 150 thousand volumes; probably the 5<hi rend="italic">th</hi> part (these are all statements that need <hi rend="italic">verification</hi>, or else <hi rend="italic">problematic</hi> wording, on my part) of the number in the British Museum: it is infinitely poorer in regard to all sorts of <hi rend="italic">Curiosa, Ms</hi>. old pamphlets, especially old English Pamphlets; but I should say for <hi rend="italic">learning</hi> out of, in regard to any subject of general or perennial interest, one would find it very probably much superior to that of the B. Museum.
It has had the advantage of a series of guiding minds at the centre of it; Ruddiman, David Hume &#x26;c have been successive Librarians of it (Lessing was Librarian of Wolfenb&#xfc;ttel, Heyne of G&#xF6;ttingen,&#x2014;very different from Sir Henrys these men!); under the guidance of such men, it has <hi rend="italic">created</hi> itself,&#x2014;instead of merely <hi rend="italic">agglomerating</hi> itself under no guidance but that of Stupidity and Chance.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Ruddiman (<date when="1674-00-00">1674</date>&#x2013;<date when="1757-00-00">1757</date>) was chief librarian, <date when="1730-00-00">1730</date>&#x2013;<date when="1752-00-00">52</date>. David Hume (<date when="1711-00-00">1711</date>&#x2013;<date when="1776-00-00">1776</date>) was keeper, <date when="1752-00-00">1752</date>&#x2013;<date when="1757-00-00">57</date>. Gotthold Ephraim Lessing (<date when="1729-00-00">1729</date>&#x2013;<date when="1781-00-00">81</date>), dramatist and critic, was librarian of the ducal library at Wolfenb&#xfc;ttel, <date when="1770-00-00">1770</date>&#x2013;<date when="1781-00-00">81</date>. Christian Gottlob Heyne (<date when="1729-00-00">1729</date>&#x2013;<date when="1781-00-00">81</date>), the great classical scholar, was also librarian at G&#xF6;ttingen. For TC&#x2019;s &#x201C;The Life of Heyne,&#x201D; see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 26:319&#x2013;54. Sir Henry Ellis (<date when="1779-00-00">1779</date>&#x2013;<date when="1869-00-00">1869</date>) had been principal librarian at the British Museum since <date when="1827-00-00">1827</date>, but after <date when="1836-00-00">1836</date> was virtually superseded as a result of his unprogressive methods.</note> Its funds are the &#xa3;200 which each new-made Advocate (called to the Bar as you say) is bound to pay towards it,&#x2014;the principal part of his expense in that process: I should guess the income annually might be some 3 or 4 thousand pounds, hardly more <pb id="pg-12-124" n="12:124"/>than that. They have a splendid edifice &#x26;c of many rooms. Dr Irving,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. David Irving (<date when="1778-00-00">1778</date>&#x2013;<date when="1860-00-00">1860</date>), biographer; M.A., Edinburgh, <date when="1801-00-00">1801</date>; librarian of the Advocates&#x2019; Library, <date when="1820-00-00">1820</date>&#x2013;<date when="1848-00-00">48</date>. His <hi rend="italic">History of Scotish Poetry</hi>, was to be ed. by John A. Carlyle (Edinburgh, <date when="1861-00-00">1861</date>).</note> a man known in Literary Biography, Bibliography and the like, is chief Librarian; three or four assistants are also skilled in books; none but the very porters who go about with dust-brushes and leather shoulder-straps are as thoroughly uncommunicative ignorant as the very Librarians in the B. Museum seem to be. You <hi rend="italic">ask</hi> the Librarian, What books exist on the subject in hand?&#x2014;he is expected to answer you better or worse. All literary men, all respectable <hi rend="italic">reading</hi> men, are considered by courtesy as having a privilege to sit and read and inquire there; you need to be &#x201C;introduced&#x201D; once by an Advocate: everybody is civil &#x26;c; yet you feel that you are there by <hi rend="italic">sufferance</hi> (not as you would wish to be); the <hi rend="italic">noise</hi> too is fully more distractive than in the British Museum, for the place is close on the Courts, and Advocates dive thither to lounge, to talk nonsense and read newspapers in the chief rooms.&#x2014; Each Advocate, however, has the privilege of borrowing 24 volumes; of these he can lend to any one (&#x2018;within seven miles of Edinburgh&#x2019; I think the Law says, but that Law is not heeded very strictly) what portion he pleases; the Books are called in, rigorously mustered and counted, once a year: a man failing to bring his books to muster, or do other bounden duty the Law may have appointed for him in that respect,&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">forfeits</hi> his right of reading; as a good many of my friends, the busier sort of Advocates, have accordingly done.&#x2014; The Advocates have long had, and even still have the privilege of a Copy of each Book from Stationers&#x2019; Hall,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The hall of the Stationers&#x2019; Company, which kept a register of copyrights (since <date when="1709-00-00">1709</date>), and which distributed copies of each book to nine libraries, including the Advocates&#x2019;.</note> a privilege they have well merited by their courteous treatment of all studious men,&#x2014;to which indeed they consider this privilege as partly <hi rend="italic">binding</hi> them in honour; as indeed it now reciprocally does. Were it <hi rend="italic">not</hi> for the courtesy of the Advocates, Edinburgh were indeed better than London, yet still but a very poor place for books. Compared with Germany and France I believe <hi rend="italic">it</hi> too, Advocates Library and all, to <hi rend="italic">be</hi> very poor.</p>
<p>Besides the Advocates, there is another Law Corporation the next to them in dignity called Writers to the Signet, who within the last 20 years or so are fast getting together, by their own resources and subscriptions, a very respectable Library (already <hi rend="italic">excellent</hi> in comparison with what exists here) under precisely similar conditions: they too admit literary men, lend books to literary men,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; they have no Stationers <pb id="pg-12-125" n="12:125"/>Hall privilege as yet. I should have excepted <hi rend="italic">this</hi> Library too when I compared Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> with London for books. London is <hi rend="italic">in</hi>comparable; the world cannot match it, not Reikiavik in Iceland can!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Advocates&#x2019; Library originated in <date when="1680-00-00">1680</date>, had premises by <date when="1682-00-00">1682</date>, and a keeper by <date when="1684-00-00">1684</date>. In <date when="1790-00-00">1790</date> it secured the use of the whole of the Laigh Parliament Hall.

TC&#x2019;s letter, <date when="1874-04-03">3 April 1874</date>, to the dean of advocates, Robert Horn, was to be used by supporters of the cause of a national library: &#x201C;I &#x2026; found the Library by very far the best I have ever been in; and, indeed, putting all qualities together, one of the best I have ever since become acquainted with&#x201D; (W.

Not at all, I should say.</p>
<p>This morning along with your Letter came that <hi rend="italic">Spectator</hi>, and the Paper in it,&#x2014;by Webbe, I dare say.

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I will write you half a word today, in answer to your brave little Letter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> which came the night before last: as my first Lecture-day (Tuesday, 3 o&#x2019;clock!) is so near at hand I know not when I may have a chance again, for some time, to write.</p>
<p>Your Letter was doubly and trebly welcome, as an evidence under your own hand that you were getting round again, out of your sharp fit of illness; that nothing had gone materially wrong with you. I suppose, with Alick, that it may have been the <foreign><hi rend="italic">trashing</hi></foreign> [fatigue] which one is always more or less exposed to on quitting one&#x2019;s own home for any kind of travel. You should not expose yourself; you should choose your <hi rend="italic">weather</hi> &#x26;c: a little travel, to see how the <foreign><hi rend="italic">bairns</hi></foreign> are getting on in their various stations, must certainly be cheering to you and good; but you should do it with precaution, and <hi rend="italic">stay no longer than you like</hi>, but order some of them to come for you when you feel that you would be better at home again.&#x2014; Let us be all thankful, that no permanent ill has happened this time;&#x2014;thankful as for one of the mercies of all others the most precious to us!</p>
<p>Jack, knowing I suppose how busy I am, has not sent me any Letter this week; indeed nothing but a very brief notice of welfare, this fortnight and more.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> One supposes him fixed, and going on equably, <pb id="pg-12-127" n="12:127"/>till the <date when="1840-05-20">20<hi rend="italic">th</hi> of this month</date>. A permanent bargain must then surely be made.</p>
<p>Jane complains a little of headache this day or two; but on the whole is very brisk for <hi rend="italic">her;</hi> gathering vigour as the sun mounts,&#x2014;like any flower of the field! Poor Miss Martineau is at the sea-side in Northumberland, all this while, in sore and dangerous illness of some sort; she that used to be so healthy, and wonder why anybody could be unhappy on account of health. We are very sorry for her; she is an honest, brave woman, notwithstanding our complaints of her.</p>
<p>As for myself, I have ridden, what riding can do: a sharp trot of 2 or 3 hours almost every day these two months now; I never in the same space of time had as much riding in my life before. Sometimes I think I take <hi rend="italic">too</hi> much. I am not altogether in <hi rend="italic">boxer&#x2019;s</hi> health; yet, on the whole, better than any of the years bygone at such a season. I have also <hi rend="italic">prepared</hi> the matter all over, almost as much as I could do. I must just step forward; do it as it <hi rend="italic">will</hi> do. This evening come four weeks, if I prosper, the whole thing will lie behind me, better or worse; neither, I hope, shall I be in haste to resume it. I am by no means sure that it would not have answered better to write the thing as a Book at once; if it were a good Book they would buy it now, and in the long-run cash does come in for it.&#x2014; On the whole I care less about &#x201C;succeeding,&#x201D; this year than I ever did; at bottom I care little whether I succeed or not. The Thing I have to say has truth in it; and if I cannot say it successfully <hi rend="italic">this</hi> way, I will some other way.</p>
<p>Jane, I suppose will write you, during the &#x201C;shouting&#x201D; [lecturing]&#x2014;for it is like that, I take it! At all events, you will get an &#x201C;all well over,&#x201D; or something of the sort as we go on.</p>
<p>Thank Jamie for his Letter; thank Alick</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>We do not hear from you this week; perhaps you think I am too busy to be interfered with at all. There have been two Letters from Alick, the first signifying that our good Mother had, after her return from Dumfries, been rather alarmingly out of order one day, just the day before Alick wrote, but that she was better then, and that if he did <hi rend="italic">not</hi> write by next post I was to infer her continuing well. <hi rend="italic">Next</hi> post-day was Monday: there came no Letter in the morning, whereupon <pb id="pg-12-128" n="12:128"/>I wrote a word or two; but in the evening, confirmatory of my hopes there did arrive a new Letter from Alick, that all was moderately right again; that our Mother had just been <hi rend="italic">there</hi>, at the preaching, well, tho&#x2019; looking &#x201C;pale&#x201D;; that she had written me a short Letter, but forgotten it, and would send it next day,&#x2014;as she accordingly did: this Letter of hers I now enclose; and herewith you have the whole narrative, which happily has ended without sinister consequence, and all now may be supposed in its usual course again. I wrote to my Mother today.</p>
<p>The Lectures are <hi rend="italic">prepared</hi>, as far as preparation will go; I tremble for Tuesday<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1840-05-05">5 May</date>, first lecture.</note> yet not more than is needful. My health is not good; riding does not profit effectually: tomorrow I am to try it <hi rend="italic">before</hi> breakfast, and see how that answers. One way or other, doubt it not, I shall get thro&#x2019;!&#x2014; The <hi rend="italic">Miscellanies</hi> Book is out; &#x201C;subscribed&#x201D; also to Fraser&#x2019;s great contentment. I sent a copy to each household of the family, every brother and sister. There is one still here for you, if you will tell me what to do with it. Would you like it sent to Pellipar? Or shall it lie here, waiting for some nearer haven? After the <date when="1840-05-20">twentieth of the month</date>, you will know. It is a beautiful Book really; &#x201C;pale green with gilt lettering,&#x201D; and will do very well, I daresay.</p>
<p>Jeffrey is here; comes skipping down sometimes; <foreign><hi rend="italic">bedeutet Nichts</hi></foreign> [it&#x2019;s of no importance]. He is about returning again. Tom Holcroft today sent for a Ticket; asked withal very kindly for you:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Journalist (d. <date when="1852-00-00">1852</date>), son of Thomas Holcroft (<date when="1745-00-00">1745</date>&#x2013;<date when="1809-00-00">1809</date>); see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18311113-TC-JAC-01"><sic>6:50</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1831-11-13">13 Nov. 1831</date></corr></ref>. He had met John in Paris in <date when="1836-00-00">1836</date>.</note> I have just bundled up his Ticket, and responded that you <hi rend="italic">are</hi> still in Ireland, doing well. John Sterling is here too; in the worst spirits I recollect him in; discontented greatly that he &#x201C;is so stupid,&#x201D; is forbidden work, <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> work &#x26;c &#x26;c. He and I were to ride together; but he came this morning before breakfast with an excuse. He is to dine here tomorrow with Mazzini. Craik is down stairs at this moment (sunset,&#x2014;a blistering east-wind heat); I must hurry down to him. William Cunningham came to tea one evening! Seemingly quite strong again, even fat; after being, as he says, given up by everybody, even by himself, and having the feeling of <hi rend="italic">death</hi> for some days close to his very heart. He desired especially to be remembered to you. His mother is said to be in a dying condition. The <foreign>Stimabile</foreign> hints obscurely that C<hi rend="italic">m</hi> will <hi rend="italic">go into the Church</hi>. Possibly.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hester Sterling&#x2019;s nephew, William Coningham; see <ref target="volume-11/lt-18391024-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1839-10-24">24 Oct. 1839</date></ref>.

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>How happy should I be to attend you, were my <hi rend="italic">nerves</hi> like those of other men! But I am dyspeptic, bilious,&#x2014;a dinner after six at night ruins me for ten days; and there are three fatal weeks of lecturing ahead of me.

<p>I pray you to pity me, and bring my good friends to do the like;&#x2014;yet with hope, were the Lectures and East winds over!</p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>By all means engage this cheapest of Reporters,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A Mr. Keane; see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400510-TC-JF-01">TC to [JF?], <date when="1840-05-10">10 May</date></ref>. Possibly David Deady Keane (<date when="1810-00-00">1810</date>?&#x2013;<date when="1870-00-00">70</date>), educated Trinity and G&#xF6;ttingen; parliamentary reporter; called to the bar, <date when="1835-00-00">1835</date>; later recorder of Bedford, <date when="1861-00-00">1861</date>&#x2013;<date when="1870-00-00">70</date>; Q.C., <date when="1864-00-00">1864</date>; author of various legal works.</note> and bind him down firmly to attend and work; six guineas surely will be worth laying out for his shadow of us, do what we like with it!</p>
<p>Fraser had spoken with another Reporter, who however made but a vague undertaking to give &#x201C;substance of the lecture,&#x201D; &#x201C;salient points&#x201D; &#x26;c; I write now to Fraser that he shall <hi rend="italic">revoke</hi> even that vague undertaking, that we will depend on this man of yours. I enclose a Ticket for him; there is no Prospectus here: but pray send him your own, and get another from Fraser. I leave it all with <hi rend="italic">you</hi>.</p>
<p>Christie seemed to understand that he had given you entire command over his stock of Circulars and Library ware; and the fact, it seems, is that you remain like myself entirely <foreign><hi rend="italic">extra muros</hi></foreign> [outside the walls], destitute even of one circular! I have written to Christie that he must communicate with you <hi rend="italic">straightway</hi>. I believe he will shew face somewhere among us tomorrow or next day. He is busy with his Library <hi rend="italic">Article</hi> for the West<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Review.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In &#x201C;Miscellaneous Notices&#x201D; 34 (<date when="1840-06-00">June 1840</date>):259&#x2013;60.</note> When is the fire to be opened in the Chronicle, in the &#x26;c &#x26;c? When are we to <hi rend="italic">begin advertising?</hi> When are we to&#x2014;O Heaven, nobody came but Craik and I to Committee yesterday; <hi rend="italic">we</hi> could not make a <foreign><hi rend="italic">quorum</hi></foreign>, could only leave a card! Do you know if Fitzgerald actually <hi rend="italic">has</hi> distributed those 2,000; or even if he is actually doing it? The beautifullest promises will avail nothing at all; Pusey&#x2019;s hard guineas will be as light fairy-money, and all our trouble to no purpose, unless they <hi rend="italic">be</hi> actually distributed those 2,000 Prospectuses,&#x2014;stuck, in real physical fact, into the fists of 2,000 individuals of the human species! I wish you would look after that too.</p>
<p>Fraser has had out the <hi rend="italic">Miscellany</hi> Book almost a week now;&#x2014;yet I doubt has still sent you no copy? A crack of the whip shall awaken him this day. If before Tuesday morning you do not see the Book lying visible on your table, fancy that there is something rotten in the State of Denmark,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi> 1.4.</note> and pray do me the kindness to send a hint of it swiftly over hither!</p>
<p>I have ridden like a Hector, subduer of horses:<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >As in the <hi rend="italic">Iliad;</hi> e.g., 24:804.</note> yesterday morning <pb id="pg-12-132" n="12:132"/>I galloped round by Highgate and Hampstead before breakfast.

<p>Darwin was to call for 12, in like manner; Craik for 12. I too could do with a half a dozen here. Would you in the meantime send one to E. Sterling Esq, 2. South Place, Knightsbridge.</p>

<salute>Dear Jean,</salute>
<p>I will send you the &#x201C;scrape of a pen&#x201D; today; Heaven knows I am not able to do much more; but I have owed it you long. Jane wrote to my Mother a word last night; perhaps you had as well forward this also to Scotsbrig, if it seem worth while; for I know not what Jane wrote; I had run out to have a gallop at the time.&#x2014; We have got our new Postage Covers, you see; but I hardly think they will answer in that shape. They cost 15 pence a dozen; &#xBC;<hi rend="italic">d</hi> each, too high a rate, and are inconvenient into the bargain. Tomorrow I mean to try a dozen of the little black <hi rend="italic">patch</hi> ones, which you merely wet, and stick upon the outside of any cover you like.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC refers to the prepaid penny postage envelope, designed by the artist William Mulready, available from <date when="1840-05-01">1 May</date>, and also to the imperforate &#x201C;penny black&#x201D; adhesive postage stamp.</note> They are also to have stamped <hi rend="italic">sheets</hi>, it would seem, paper of your own that you can get stamped on the back. One way or other they will get it to answer.</p>
<p>Yesterday I got my first Lecture off my hands;&#x2014;as well as could be expected! I thought I should get something like the <hi rend="italic">tenth part</hi> of my meaning unfolded to the good people; and I could not feel that I <hi rend="italic">had</hi> got much more. However, <hi rend="italic">they</hi> seemed content as need be; sat silent, listening as if it had been gospel: I strive not to <hi rend="italic">heed</hi> my own notions of the thing,&#x2014;to <hi rend="italic">keep down the conceit</hi> and ambition of me, for that is it! I was not in good trim; I had awoke at half past 4 o&#x2019;clock &#x26;c. My room was considerably fuller than ever before; the <foreign>bonniest</foreign> and <foreign>brawest</foreign> [well dressed] of people:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mrs. Sophia De Morgan wrote that she saw TC for the first time at these lectures: &#x201C;The tall figure, deep florid complexion, large blue eyes, and broad Scotch accent would have secured attention even before his hearers had been startled by the truths brought home to them by the rich strong voice. But the effect of the whole was like a revelation&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Threescore Years and Ten</hi> [London, <date when="1895-00-00">1895</date>] 226).</note> what more could the human mind require of such a business? I fancy, being once fairly <hi rend="italic">into</hi> the subject, I shall do a thought better perhaps on friday; tho&#x2019; Mahomet is not a very intimate friend either to any of us!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Froude printed the previous five sentences as if to Mrs. Carlyle (<date when="1840-05-06">6 May</date>), followed by two sentences taken from later in this para.</note>&#x2014; The Lecture of yesterday, it seems, was <hi rend="italic">not</hi> got reported. I trusted to <hi rend="italic">two</hi> people; and between two stools, we know what becomes of a man sitting down. It is probably just as well. I have a notion of <hi rend="italic">writing</hi> the thing, and printing it in free developement, as it should be, at my leisure; I could not have consented to <hi rend="italic">publish</hi> <pb id="pg-12-135" n="12:135"/>such a Lecture as yesterday&#x2019;s at any rate; but I would have given &#x201C;a guinea&#x201D; (that was the proposed charge; one offering to report for &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">five</hi> guineas each lecture&#x201D; I at once rejected) to have any kind of copy that even pretended to be done <foreign><hi rend="italic">verbatim</hi></foreign>. Whether I shall have any of the rest reported is a thing uncertain; which I am going up to consult with Fraser about, today. Likeliest <hi rend="italic">not;</hi> but I have heart and strength left, I will make a Book of it perhaps,&#x2014;and Be hanged to them! What the Newspapers say for or against, or whether they say anything appears to be of no consequence at all. Probably the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> will not report this year, I think; I will tell my Mother to send it, and then you can forward it to Jack, if it do.</p>
<p>Jack has written me a Letter; on Saturday<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found; &#x201C;Saturday&#x201D; has been written by TC above &#x201C;Monday,&#x201D; which is not crossed out.</note> last it got here. He seems to contemplate the likelihood of quitting his place on the <date when="1840-05-20">20<hi rend="italic">th</hi></date> after all. He has &#x201C;much troublesome correspondence&#x201D; with his Patient&#x2019;s relatives; but writes in good heart, seems too to think he is doing his Patient good. We shall see what comes of it.</p>
<p>You answered duly about our bathing in the Arbigland<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Estate and mansion on the Kirkcudbrightshire coast, one and a half mi. SE of Kirkbean. In her letter of <date when="1840-04-20">20 April</date> Jean had described &#x201C;nice little cottages on the shore kept for the express purpose of accomodating bathers.&#x201D;</note> region! Alas, I wish I were there, safe and quiet; but I doubt it will be hard to get thither. Jane, I think, does not like the country or the notion of it very much; I shall have to take it mostly on my own shoulders if we go. I too disagree hugely with <hi rend="italic">travelling;</hi> I long decidedly for a house where I could continue to live all the year round,&#x2014;not be driven out by stress of weather to <foreign><hi rend="italic">rake</hi></foreign> [roam] over the world in that unprofitable manner! It costs a lump of money too; and there is no work done. If it were not that I want to see my dear Mother and the rest of you, I believe I should endeavour to stick still here, and write my Book: we are getting <hi rend="italic">Venetian Shutters</hi> made against the heat for this room, and will see how they do!</p>
<p>One point about the Colvend Coast<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Parish and village on Kirkcudbrightshire coast, five mi. SE of Dalbeattie.</note> is not clear to me, and yet an important one: Is the water real green <hi rend="italic">sea</hi>-water there, so that you can bathe at all hours; or only tide-water, of a drab coloured untransparent quality? Something will depend on that.</p>
<p>We have had a Letter from Miss Martineau, about joining <hi rend="italic">her</hi> in her sea-residence, where lodgings enough are to be had; a place called Tynemouth, some miles farther off you than Newcastle: the sea is good, very accessible from London; and Annandale again by the Carlisle railway would be very accessible from it. Miss Martineau is loud in <pb id="pg-12-136" n="12:136"/>praises of the spot, in invitations to come thither: but, alas, I find it at bottom a fashionable bathing-village full of Northumbrian quality and half and quarter quality,&#x2014;to me a place to be fled from! Tynemouth, I conjecture, will not do.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Carlyles did not visit any of these places this summer. This letter of Harriet Martineau&#x2019;s is probably the one mentioned by Harriet Taylor, of <date when="1840-05-00">May</date> or <date when="1840-06-00">June</date>: &#x201C;She wrote to Mr. Carlyle approving the syllabus but reminding him that he had omitted the &#x2018;Hero&#x2019; as &#x2018;Martyr&#x2019; to which he replied that if he had not considered him that in every situation he should never have thought him worth talking about&#x201D; (F. A. Hayek, <hi rend="italic">John Stuart Mill and Harriet Taylor</hi> [London, <date when="1951-00-00">1951</date>] 111).</note></p>
<p>As to the Colvend region much would depend on what kind of house <hi rend="italic">were procurable</hi>. A habitable house to ourselves, and some way of keeping a horse: that would be the nicest; that would be worth paying something for, and bundling ourselves up to inhabit for a while! But I fear there is no chance of such. Then failing that, you might tell us what kind of thing the Lodgings are, what their price is &#x26;c,&#x2014;with or without horse-keep: perhaps it might do our Mother and me good to go and dabble in the water there for a while,&#x2014;leaving the rest of them here, since they do not want to go elsewhither. Indeed why should <hi rend="italic">they?</hi> Jane is always stronger the hotter it is,&#x2014;and dies away in solitude and coolness where alone I like best to be.&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; In short, you see, dear Jean, it is all as vague as need be; and we are not to be counted on at all: if James or you chance to learn anything about the sea-bathing establishments, it will help towards a decision; but if you even gave us up for a bad job, and did not inquire farther about the thing at all, <hi rend="italic">small</hi> were your blame.&#x2014; I shall be through these <hi rend="italic">dog</hi>-lectures (Lectures of <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;Salt-hound,&#x201D;</hi> I do think!)&#x2014;and then we shall see better how it is.</p>
<p>My Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Pipes have come; decidedly inferior to the Glasgow ones, but nearly <hi rend="italic">all</hi> whole. Alick&#x2019;s tobacco, what is singular, arrived the same day. I am now drying that,&#x2014;it is all spread out on the tables today; it was too wet and threatening to <hi rend="italic">mould</hi> in its close canisters;&#x2014;otherwise excellent stuff.</p>
<p>Our good Mother had a rather sore turn, as you will have heard, directly after getting home from you. She is happily got round again now.&#x2014; Mrs Welsh speaks of having seen you the other day; and celebrates your kindness to her, your good looks &#x26;c.</p>
<p>What is our poor old Uncle doing?<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Aitken.</note> I make a lonely forlorn image of him to myself.&#x2014; James will be right glad that he has got to work again. The &#xa3;70 for the Bank of course came all right, tho&#x2019; I think you do not expressly mention it. Have the <hi rend="italic">Miscellany</hi> Books arrived? They <pb id="pg-12-137" n="12:137"/>were all addressed to James, and should be getting to port now. James will forward the other copies, by his best speedy opportunities. If they have not come <hi rend="italic">yet</hi>, let me know; for they must be lying at Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>.</p>
<p>Wish me well thro&#x2019; this <foreign><hi rend="italic">pluister</hi></foreign> [bother];&#x2014;I shall get well enough thro&#x2019; it: good be with you; and nothing but luck among us all!</p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I was sorry I could not see you yesterday. I conclude you <hi rend="italic">got</hi> my two Notes; and hope also that you are far on with your Review Article. Cannot you come down hither, and see me?</p>
<p>I send you a dozen addresses for despatch of new Circulars. The return as yet, it seems from your examination, is but small, however, we must not despair. I suspect only a small fraction of Fitzg&#x2019;s Circulars are yet fairly off. We <hi rend="italic">must begin advertising;</hi> we must begin working the great bellows-machinery of the Newspaper Press. To it! I say to Forster and you; To it, like lions! Before the end of this month we may expect a very superior result to your actual &#x201C;fifteen.&#x201D;</p>
<p>If I can possibly I will attend you on Saturday; but, alas, in these present weeks I am like a matron in labour, and really do require to be dealt with accordingly. &#x201C;As well as can be expected, thank you!&#x201D;</p>
<p>Perhaps I shall see you before then.&#x2014;</p>

<p>Fraser, I suppose, will write to you today about the Article. Perhaps your briefest way will be to go to him, and so see at once what is feasible in the business.&#x2014; I want some Prospectuses here. Fraser will take <pb id="pg-12-138" n="12:138"/>200, will fold them up, and have them distributed on Friday at the door of the Lecture room. Names seem to continue coming in. Stir every finger! We <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> but prosper if we persevere.</p>
<p>Cole promises again this morning that he will do what he can. I do know slightly a young man called Lewes, and will speak to him by the first opportunity: but I understand the <hi rend="italic">Monthly Chronicle</hi> is just about expiring.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For G.

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I send you a small half-word of my own today, to assure (you) that all is still right here; that I gave my second Lecture yesterday to a larger audience than ever, and with all the success, or more, that was necessary for me. It was on <hi rend="italic">Mahomet;</hi> I had bishops and all kinds of people among my hearers; I gave them to know that the poor Arab had points about him which it were good for all of them to imitate; that <pb id="pg-12-139" n="12:139"/>probably <hi rend="italic">they</hi> were more of quacks than he,&#x2014;that, in short, it was altogether a new kind of thing they were hearing today! The people seemed greatly astonished, and greatly pleased; I vomited it forth on them like wild Annandale grapeshot; they laughed, applauded &#x26;c., &#x26;c.: in short, it was all right; and I suppose it is by much the best Lecture I shall have the luck to give this time.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >F. D. Maurice thought the lecture &#x201C;by far the most animated and vehement I have ever heard from him,&#x201D; but he preferred Christianity to TC&#x2019;s sense of &#x201C;the world as without a centre,&#x201D; and felt that some of it was &#x201C;miserable vagueness&#x201D; and &#x201C;silly rant.&#x201D; TC&#x2019;s &#x201C;inconsistencies &#x2026; seem to me to be the greatest providential blessings, explaining wherein he is false, and enabling us to receive his truth.&#x201D; On <date when="1840-05-12">12 May</date>, Maurice was to find the lecture &#x201C;wild pantheistic rant&#x201D; (F. Maurice, <hi rend="italic">Life of F. D. Maurice</hi> [London, <date when="1884-00-00">1884</date>] 1:282&#x2013;83). Richard Garnett says that John Mill interrupted by standing up and crying &#x201C;No,&#x201D; when TC said that &#x201C;Benthamee Utility&#x201D; gave a &#x201C;beggarlier&#x201D; and &#x201C;falser view of Man&#x201D; than Mahomet (<hi rend="italic">Life of Carlyle</hi> [London, <date when="1887-00-00">1887</date>] 171). Richard Chevenix Trench wrote to ask Samuel Wilberforce &#x201C;to string a few of Carlyle&#x2019;s choicest pearls&#x201D; for those who missed the lectures: &#x201C;I hear the second lecture was very good. The first &#x2026; was partially a failure; as indeed they always are, unless he works himself up into the true Berserker fury&#x201D; (Richard Chevenix Trench, <hi rend="italic">Letters and Memorials</hi> [London, <date when="1888-00-00">1888</date>] 1:248&#x2013;49). Crabb Robinson noted that &#x201C;it gave great satisfaction &#x2026; and was delivered with unusual animation&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Diaries</hi>, ed. T. Sadler [London, <date when="1869-00-00">1869</date>] 3:186).</note> For really it all depends on what we call luck; I cannot say in the least whether my Lecture will be good or bad when I begin to deliver it. So far it is well enough;&#x2014;and now, alas, as the <hi rend="italic">price</hi> of a good Lecture, my nerves are thrown into such a flurry that I got very little sleep last night, and am all out of sorts today! It is the regular course; I cannot help it.</p>
<p>I have ridden as far as Richmond with Cavaignac the Frenchman today, and am just back again before dinner. I mean to keep as quiet as a mouse, and tomorrow I shall probably be got round again. Two weeks more, and this sore business is done; and perhaps I shall never try it another time. My audience is between 2 and 3 hundred, and grew a good deal larger after the first Lecture. I expect to <hi rend="italic">clear</hi> &#xa3;200 out of it: that is the <hi rend="italic">result;</hi> and next year I may hope to be able to dispense with that aid,&#x2014;since it must be purchased with such a <foreign><hi rend="italic">tirrivee</hi></foreign> [commotion], which I like so ill. Two weeks more, and then!</p>
<p>I had a Letter from John, exactly a week ago: he was well; he seemed to anticipate the probability of giving up Pellipar soon. I wrote to Jean at Dumfries: did she send you the Letter?&#x2014; If anything about these Lectures be in the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, <date when="1840-05-10">10 May</date>, simply remarked of the second lecture that it was &#x201C;the noblest &#x2026; Mr. Carlyle has ever delivered,&#x201D; and said that it reserved its comments until later.</note> you are to send it round by her (after the rest have satisfied themselves about it), and she will send it on to Ireland.&#x2014; Jane did not sleep either last night! Our weather is <pb id="pg-12-140" n="12:140"/>mended by two delightful showers, and wind at last.&#x2014; I can only hope you continue well, dear Mother, that all is well, and send my best blessings to all.</p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>There is no Newspaper that I know of hitherto which gives any report of my Lectures this year. I never either authorized or prohibited <pb id="pg-12-141" n="12:141"/>such reporting, nor have I in the present case; but left the &#x201C;able editors&#x201D; to do with the thing as they liked;&#x2014;and this is the way they <hi rend="italic">like</hi> to do at present. Their reasons I might perhaps conjecture to be rather flattering to me; but at all events the fact itself I find to be highly convenient. The fuss and uproar of all that puffery and reportery (worthy of the name of <hi rend="italic">butchery</hi>) was in the utmost degree confusing to me; and it did not, as I suspected, and may now see, produce any result on the economical side to compensate for such confusion: we are almost a third more numerous this year than on any former year; and our Lectures go on much better in quietness, as they might be expected to do.</p>
<p>A reporter of Fraser the Bookseller&#x2019;s does attend, and make a kind of Note or Draft of the business; a diligent intelligent man: but what can any reporter do? I have seen his &#x201C;First Lecture,&#x201D; and would not have it printed with my name to it for any hire whatever. My only chance, if I persist in such a notion, and find I have strength left for it, will be to work the subject up by myself, and print it by and by as a kind of Book.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC does not mention Keane, possibly because he thought he could not send his transcript in time, and because he was thinking of publishing his full lectures as a book.</note></p>
<p>Lecturing does my health such mischief, and is every way so intensely disagreeable to me, that nothing short of compulsion, such as one may hope will not forever exist, can rationally drive me to it. It was a narrow turn of the balance that I did not decline such a business this year: and, with my present feeling, there is no hope dearer to me than that I may never do it again in the world. Four times spitted on the spear&#x2019;s point like a Surinam<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Now Surinam, formerly Dutch Guiana, South America; see &#x201C;The Hero as Man of Letters&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 5:195), where TC slightly misquotes from his trans. of &#x201C;Jean Paul Friedrich Richter&#x2019;s Review of Madame de Sta&#xEB;l&#x2019;s &#x2018;Allemagne&#x2019;&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 24:481), giving &#x201C;Sumatra&#x201D; for &#x201C;Surinam.&#x201D;</note> <hi rend="italic">fire-fly</hi> to give light to the fashionable classes: this is enough of times! I shall be right thankful to get through it without disgrace, and cease shining in that manner.</p>
<p>If you come to London, you will come to Chelsea, and find a friendly welcome here.&#x2014; In haste,</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I write you a word this evening to say that my third Lecture<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;The Hero as Poet.&#x201D; Macready attended, saw Browning and Mrs. Jameson, was &#x201C;disappointed&#x201D; in TC&#x2019;s &#x201C;treatment of the subject,&#x201D; thought he said &#x201C;little that was impressive,&#x201D; and took personally the comment that &#x201C;managers of playhouses&#x201D; were &#x201C;the most insignificant of human beings.&#x201D; He also attended the fifth lecture, when he was very &#x201C;interested and edified&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Diaries</hi>, ed. W. Toynbee, 2:60). Daniel Macmillan and his brother Alexander were given James Fraser&#x2019;s ticket, and Daniel recorded of TC at this lecture: &#x201C;He is very far from being a fluent speaker. Sometimes he rises into eloquence and gets applauded; sometimes he comes to a dead stand for want of a word. &#x2026; His whole appearance and manner is exceedingly simple.&#x201D; Alexander went to the fifth lecture, when TC was &#x201C;very much applauded,&#x201D; brought himself to an end &#x201C;abruptly, and left his hearers laughing at a quotation&#x201D; from Richter (Thomas Hughes, <hi rend="italic">Memoir of Daniel Macmillan</hi> [London, <date when="1882-00-00">1882</date>] 92&#x2013;93).</note> is also tolerably over; a thing I feel extremely thankful for. You will tell my dear Mother about it, whose anxieties after what I wrote to her last time are <hi rend="italic">not</hi> likely to be wanting. I was upon Poets today; and got thro&#x2019; not in an extraordinary way, but fully as well as I could expect. My audience had considerably increased; they sat very attentive, and seemed well enough content with me. I can assure you, I was right glad to get thro&#x2019; on any terms! My former Lecture, which they call the <hi rend="italic">best</hi> I ever delivered, was far <hi rend="italic">too good;</hi> it shivered my nerves all in pieces; and I have lost about the fourth part of my sleep ever since. Nobody but one that had tried would fancy what a misery that is: Last night I seemed as if I were not going to sleep at all; I do not remember a more anxious feeling, about any such thing, than I had all this morning. And now it is over; and the <hi rend="italic">half</hi> of the business, the far <hi rend="italic">worst</hi> half of it, is over. I calculate, and Jane too is of that mind, I shall not try the thing at all again, unless I see myself in greater want than I was in this year.</p>
<p>No reports appear in the Newspapers; you would notice the vacancy in the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, with a small sentence to account for it.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400509-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1840-05-09">9 May</date></ref>. There was a wooden report in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, <date when="1840-05-13">13 May</date>, of &#x201C;Mr. Carlisle&#x2019;s&#x201D; lecture.

We shall see what strength is left me.&#x2014; I wish you would get some express word sent to Jean and the rest of them: you can enclose Jean this Letter for that matter; I have no heart or leisure to write in these weeks.</p>

<p>I have had out my tobacco to dry it; it was all begun moulding,&#x2014;you had packed it so fiercely down into that canister! I gave it above twice as much room. It is excellent stuff when I get it to the right pitch of dryness; which now is not difficult to do.</p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Yesterday I called on Mrs Stanley,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henrietta, wife of Edward Stanley.</note> and spoke to her about Garnier.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >J. H. Garnier obtained a lowly government clerkship, but see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18401029-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1840-10-29">29 Oct.</date></ref>, for his failure in it.</note> She had not before heard of him; Buller,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charles Buller.</note> I suppose, had spoken only to her Husband. I described, as faithfully as I could, the worth, the honesty, the talent and valour of the man; treating as a light matter his foreign birth, and as a weighty matter his manly endurance of exile and his frank domestication among us; in fine urging, as I could, that he ought to have the place, being fit for it, and for a far better one. The good Lady professed to have &#x201C;no power&#x201D; over her Husband in such matters; but heartily promised to do what was possible in it,&#x2014;to speak with Buller who was coming to dine there that night; to attack Stanley in concert with him; in a word, to try well. She seemed to think that <pb id="pg-12-144" n="12:144"/>Buller himself, were he zealous enough, might probably prevail. I know not what will come of it; but my augury, on the whole, was rather good. You are behind Buller, I suppose, to flap him if he should become oblivious? I spoke what was true about Garnier, my honest belief about him. I shall be right glad to hear that by one means or another he succeeds in this aim of his.</p>
<p>Nothing has yet been decided about the ulterior fate of these Lectures I am now delivering. There seem to be one or two reporters doing daily their utmost. Fraser had engaged one; whose complete copy of the First Lecture I have now got, and read. It will do nothing for printing; it is like soda-water with the gas out of it. Yet I think it seems nearly made out with me that in some way or other I <hi rend="italic">am</hi> to write out these Lectures myself, if not what was said, yet what might and should have been said; and in some fashion to give that still farther forth into the world. There might be about 100 pages of it, pages of your Review.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See headnote. The lectures were eventually pbd. by Fraser in <date when="1841-04-00">April 1841</date>.</note> I know not if you would persist in offering me at the rate &#xa3;1 per page for what I might give you as printable in that way; and printing to the extent even of 100 pages the whole at a time? You may tell me, provided your answer, Yes or No, lie quite ready for giving. It is not worth while <hi rend="italic">seek</hi>ing and studying for an answer. My decision even were your answer <hi rend="italic">Yes</hi>, would still be very dubious. The only thing I feel at all certain about, is that <hi rend="italic">this</hi> course of lectures ought to be more accurately unfolded, and in <hi rend="italic">some</hi> way or other made more accessible to the curious respecting it. Your Review is one way; whether the suitable way for me or not. I am afraid not, in any case. But, as I say, if it be quite easy you may tell me whether the alternative does lie open to me there.</p>
<p>Of course the &#xa3;100 &#x26;c includes the reserved right to myself of publishing the thing, after a due lapse of time, for my own behoof as &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Miscellanies</hi>&#x201D; or otherwise.</p>

<salute>Dear Forster,</salute>
<p>Your Report,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Keane&#x2019;s report.</note> come of it what may, is decidedly excellent. It not only far surpasses Fraser&#x2019;s which is here; but I may say I do not recollect <pb id="pg-12-145" n="12:145"/>to have ever seen the real <hi rend="italic">cream</hi> of such a business more adroitly laid hold of, and presented,&#x2014;the <hi rend="italic">thin</hi> surplusage all left behind. A few altogether trifling mistakes weeded out (most of which I have marked), the thing might be printed anywhere. It is in fact a right readable <hi rend="italic">report</hi> of what, in common hands, becomes a vague rhapsody neither readable nor intelligible.</p>
<p>If you ask me my own separate wish in the matter, I should say first of all: That such a benignant process were performed for all these Harangues;&#x2014;and then that I had the whole here in my drawer, if I knew how to reward you for it! This were <hi rend="italic">my</hi> wish and interest in regard to it, this and no other; but I have no right to make such a demand of you.</p>
<p>I may say farther that I do mean to develope this subject, and publish it abroad to a greater extent in some way or other,&#x2014;by writing a Book on it; by lecturing farther on it; or indeed by <hi rend="italic">what</hi> way I have not yet at all determined. An editor of some Paper or another, an innocent Irish Catholic Lawyer,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Frederick Lucas (<date when="1812-00-00">1812</date>&#x2013;<date when="1855-00-00">55</date>), journalist and politician; brought up as a Quaker; student at Univ. College, London; called to the bar, <date when="1835-00-00">1835</date>; had become a Roman Catholic, <date when="1839-00-00">1839</date>, after conversations with T. C. Anstey (see <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380110-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1838-01-10">10 Jan. 1838</date>)</ref>, who had reported TC&#x2019;s lectures of <date when="1838-00-00">1838</date>. He started the weekly periodical the <hi rend="italic">Tablet</hi>, <date when="1840-00-00">1840</date>; M.P. for Co. Meath, <date when="1852-00-00">1852</date>&#x2013;<date when="1855-00-00">55</date>; identified himself with the Irish nationalist party.</note> stumbled in upon me one night; and obtained a kind of promise that I would <hi rend="italic">ignore</hi> his reporting of the First Lecture, at least till I saw what it turned out to be: but after the First Lecture (which he said would come out today&#x2014;in the <hi rend="italic">Tablet</hi> or some such thing),<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Tablet</hi>, <date when="1840-05-16">16 May</date>, reported the first lecture, &#x201C;Carlyle&#x2019;s Lectures on Heroes, Hero-Worship, and the Heroic in Human History.&#x201D; It began by explaining that it had no connection with TC, and that he had not seen the report. Though apparently fairly faithful, it can only be about half the length as given, and hardly a line is the same as TC&#x2019;s revised version. Lucas prefaced the report with a tribute to &#x201C;this extraordinary writer,&#x201D; from whose opinions he was bound to differ as a Catholic: &#x201C;Gifted with great discernment of character, a rare sincerity of heart and understanding, an utter inability to reconcile himself to anything but what appears to him to be true &#x2026; and haunted by an inborn necessity of everywhere discerning the soul of goodness in things evil; it yet appears to us &#x2026; as if one side of his mind were struck with paralysis.&#x201D; Yet, &#x201C;if in anything he is blind, it is with the blindness of a Sampson. &#x2026; More than one person, we know well, owes him an incalculable debt of gratitude for the guidance his writings have afforded to the precincts of the true faith.&#x201D;</note> I have determined to stop him: indeed I believe I was wrong to give him any permission at all, since I already thought of publishing the thing myself in some shape or other.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances what can I ask you to do? A short abstract of the First Lecture in the <hi rend="italic">Chronicle</hi>,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >None apparently appeared.</note> as it is likely to be reported <pb id="pg-12-146" n="12:146"/>and misreported already in that <hi rend="italic">Tablet</hi> or whatever they call it, could do no harm; but also it could not be of much service to anybody: and about all the rest of the Lectures there must be <hi rend="italic">silence</hi> till we have determined what <hi rend="italic">is</hi> to be done with them. I can see no farther into it as yet.</p>
<p>Follow your own light therefore in regard to this first lecture; publish no report of the rest. I cannot ask you to <hi rend="italic">make</hi> reports and write them on these terms: but I have already said how well I should like to have such, or even to know them in existence. I wish I could ask you; but I cannot and do not.</p>
<p>Some general description of the whole phenomenon of these Lectures and outline of the purport of them, given as an Article after they were over, would not be objectionable, so far as I see: yet I never know of such things whether for myself they are good or evil in the long-run, and am in the fixed habit of leaving them altogether to themselves. What can a man do with them? Begging is bad any way; but begging a man to criticize you,&#x2014;is it not begging him, if he be a true man, to tell you that he <hi rend="italic">thinks</hi> you a windbag and an impertinent fellow?</p>

<salute>Dear Sister Jean,</salute>
<p>You have not heard a word direct from me, nor have I from you, or indeed from any one out of Annandale, since this lecturing began. I know not whether they sent you the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> over from Scotsbrig as I desired, to let you <hi rend="italic">see</hi> that we <hi rend="italic">had</hi> begun, and were going on prosperously?</p>
<p>The Newspapers, which held their peace about us altogether at first, seem disposed <hi rend="italic">now</hi> to commence reporting; now when it can do no good, but only mischief. Here is a thing called <hi rend="italic">Tablet</hi>, a Paper just started, which contains my first Lecture; for which reason I send it you. They have the second <hi rend="italic">ready</hi>, they tell me; but I have put a prohibition on it,&#x2014;meaning to set forth the thing myself, in some shape, by and by. To a like effect I have prohibited the <hi rend="italic">Morning Chronicle;</hi> they too had &#x201C;the Lectures all in a state of forwardness&#x201D;; I told them <pb id="pg-12-147" n="12:147"/>they were not to publish <hi rend="italic">any</hi>, at this late date of the work,&#x2014;unless it were the First Lecture which stood here already reported in this <hi rend="italic">Tablet</hi>.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400516-TC-JF-01">previous letter</ref>.</note> The Second, and others, I would either publish for my own behoof, or let them lie unpublished,&#x2014; Had they begun at the very starting of the business, there might at least have been some shadow of likelihood of their benefiting <hi rend="italic">me</hi> by it; but now there is none,&#x2014;therefore &#x201C;Stop!&#x201D; say I. And indeed it could have been but a &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">shadow</hi> of likelihood,&#x201D; I think; for at the very starting we were more numerous considerably than ever, and something like 70 or 80 have joined us since,&#x2014;which proves once again the small use there is in all that <hi rend="italic">fluff</hi> of Newspaper work, and how, for practical purposes, nobody or very few have any belief in it.&#x2014; What you are to do with this <hi rend="italic">Tablet</hi> however is to read it; and instantly despatch it to my Mother with instructions to send it over to Jack, and notice that we are going on right, and have only two days more till we be done with it now. Do not neglect this, the sending straightway of a little Note to my Mother! You can inclose <hi rend="italic">this</hi>, if there be no better way. James will <hi rend="italic">write</hi> on a proper slip of paper the Dr&#x2019;s Irish <hi rend="italic">address</hi>, and inclose that too; so that they will have nothing to do, but wrap it on, put two wafers in it, and consign it to Postie. This is all; attend to this.</p>
<p>Did the Miscellany Books come? I infer so from the silence of all parties; I think you would have written had there been any mistake.</p>
<p>Not a word from the Doctor these ten days; tho&#x2019; just at present he must be making some <hi rend="italic">new</hi> arrangements. He hinted at its being likely he would <hi rend="italic">quit</hi>. We shall hear soon.&#x2014; My own manifold schemes, business &#x26;c &#x26;c <hi rend="italic">after</hi> this week! At present I but bid Good be with you, and thankfulness along with me that I am again nearly thro&#x2019; this horrible thing, in a creditable manner! My health does not grow worse; nay now that the <hi rend="italic">steam is up</hi>, I feel as if I were much better. Bless you all, <foreign>bairns</foreign>!</p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Take a single word from me today to say that all goes well here. I delivered my fifth Lecture yesterday, with as much acceptance as ever;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Caroline Fox attended, and sat next to Mill&#x2019;s sister Harriet, who introduced her to JWC. She thought TC &#x201C;a tall robust-looking man; rugged simplicity and indomitable strength are in his face, and such a glow of genius in it&#x2014;not always smouldering there, but flashing from his beautiful grey eyes, from the remoteness of their deep setting under that massive brow. His manner is very quiet, but he speaks like one tremendously convinced.&#x201D; She went home with Mill and his sister: &#x201C;A good deal of talk about Carlyle and his lectures: he can never get over the feeling that people have given money to hear him, and are possibly calculating whether what they hear is worth the price they paid for it.&#x201D; Mill chose to read the Quaker Caroline &#x201C;that striking passage&#x201D; from <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi> about George Fox making himself a leather suit. She also attended the last lecture on <date when="1840-05-22">22 May</date> and described both at length in her journal (<hi rend="italic">Memories of Old Friends</hi>, ed. H. N. Pym 95&#x2013;102).</note> and now there is but one more, which also I hope to get honourably <pb id="pg-12-148" n="12:148"/>thro&#x2019;. Jane says, and indeed I rather think it is true, that these two last Lectures are among the best I ever gave (she says, the very best, but I do not think that); and certainly they have not done me nearly so much mischief as the others were wont; I feel great pain and anxiety till I get them done, on the day when they are to be done; but no excessive shattering of myself to pieces in consequence of that: the thing seems a thing I could learn to stand by and by. Besides I am telling the people matters that belong much more to myself this year; which is far more interesting to me. I fancy myself to be perhaps offending this man today, and that man another day; but I say, &#x201C;No help for it, friends; you must just wait, see how it will turn, and adjust yourselves if it do <hi rend="italic">not</hi> turn well for you; the story <hi rend="italic">must</hi> be told!&#x201D; And so it goes along, really very tolerably well.</p>
<p>I sent Jean a Newspaper,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Tablet</hi>.</note> containing a report of my First Lecture; with order to send it forward to you without delay. Probably it will arrive just along with this. You are then to forward it to Jack. The Editor was for going on with his reports; but I cut him short. I am getting no fewer than <hi rend="italic">two</hi> separate reports drawn up for my own behoof; so the thing will not be lost, but come out farther in some way or other.</p>
<p>Our hot weather is all off again: plenty of Northwind now, sometimes <hi rend="italic">without</hi> sun, and copious wettings of rain. It is fine for riding; but it agrees ill with poor Jane, who has been in a poorish kind of way all this while; as indeed the lecturing agrees with <hi rend="italic">her</hi> almost rather worse than it does with me, I think. I tell her that when I go to lecture in America, she shall not go with me; there is no use in having two persons made miserable by it instead of one!</p>
<p>We had a Letter last night from Jack;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> the first for these ten days. He said, he was to write to you, and probably to Jean. He had had a cold for a day or two, but had doctored himself well out of it again. <pb id="pg-12-149" n="12:149"/>He is to stay for one month more at least. It seems to be a very curious situation that of his; but he throws no light on it for us.</p>
<p>You have <hi rend="italic">covers</hi>, have you not, dear Mother? Take one of them, and write by it three words merely to say you are well,&#x2014;if indeed it be so, as I am forced to content myself with hoping. Surely you may send me a <hi rend="italic">penny</hi>worth as often as you like!&#x2014; How is poor little Tom with his leg? I wish he were better poor little fellow. My love to the whole household, the whole kindred. Good be with you, dear Mother, and with one and all of them.&#x2014;</p>

At this time James Hutchison Stirling (<date when="1820-00-00">1820</date>&#x2013;<date when="1909-00-00">1909</date>) was a medical student at Glasgow Univ. with literary aspirations. Later he wrote, in <hi rend="italic">Thomas Carlyle&#x2019;s Counsels</hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1886-00-00">1886</date>) 27, that TC was then &#x201C;every literary young man&#x2019;s idol, almost the god he prayed to.&#x201D; In <date when="1851-00-00">1851</date> he was to give up medical practice, travel in France and Germany, and study German philosophy. His most important work was <hi rend="italic">The Secret of Hegel</hi> (London, <date when="1865-00-00">1865</date>), but he wrote much else of value on philosophy and literature. He had written to TC on <date when="1840-05-11">11 May</date> suggesting that a literary association (a so-called Letter League) might be formed to raise &#xa3;1,000 for a literary prize. In reply to TC&#x2019;s letter, Stirling wrote again, <date when="1840-05-26">26 May</date>, withdrawing the proposal, and expressing his gratitude, in a way which his daughter describes as having &#x201C;a certain flavour of youthful hyperbole&#x201D;: &#x201C;It is impossible for me to express the enthusiasm, firmness, energy, and hope which the words you addressed specially to myself infused into me. My whole being seemed to expand&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">JHS</hi> 53). There was no further reply, but Stirling wrote again in <date when="1842-00-00">1842</date>. TC was familiar with all kinds of such proposals; see Heather Henderson, &#x201C;Carlyle and the Book Clubs,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Publishing History</hi> 6 (<date when="1979-00-00">1979</date>): 37&#x2013;62.

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I have read your Letter, and shewn it to another literary man, a person of sound practical habits and judgement; who, lamenting along with you the evil as it at present stands, agrees with me that your proposed Plan is entirely inexecutable. No Society could be formed here, or else where that I know of, on such a principle; and if there were one formed, the <hi rend="italic">fallibility</hi> of its decisions would too certainly dissolve it again,&#x2014;for its decisions, only some degrees better than those of the huge gross Public, could not hope to be <hi rend="italic">in</hi>fallible; and, unlike those of the Public, they would not be reversible, capable of rectifying themselves in the long run. What is to be got from Societies of that kind, in the present epoch of the world, may be seen from many instances. <pb id="pg-12-150" n="12:150"/>Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge, to go no farther; let us look at that, and despair of Societies at present. &#x201C;Societies&#x201D; in fact are a kind of <hi rend="italic">machines</hi> for doing what is not mechanical, what cannot be done by machinery at all; windmills laboriously built up to grind&#x2014;let us say sunbeams or some other entirely ungrindable substance; they do not accordingly grind it; they produce nothing but fuss, dinner-oratory, newspaper-puffery, under various figures&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">wind</hi>.</p>
<p>For yourself, my dear Sir, if you are, as I suppose likely, a young literary man struggling towards the accomplishment of something good and manful, I will bid you in brief <hi rend="italic">accomplish it</hi>, and lay it down silently in this all-embracing universe, with the sure faith that if it <hi rend="italic">is</hi> good the universe will not reject it but accept it. Neither are the difficulties one strives under useless, wholly obstructive; very far from that; they have their most precious indispensable uses, and have furthered us while seeming only to obstruct: believe that you will find it so one day. Poverty itself, whatever the gross mass of the world may think of it, is by no manner of means a very great or the chief evil a man has to struggle under; nay, in these days, if you gave me a true man to breed up, with the heart of a man in him, I should say rather, <hi rend="italic">Let</hi> him be poor! This I believe to be decidedly true.&#x2014; Courage!</p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>You will rejoice with me that those Lectures are happily over. I write you a short word to communicate that pleasant fact. I got thro&#x2019; the last Lecture yesterday, in very tolerable style, seemingly much to the satisfaction of parties; and the people all expressed, in a great variety of ways, much very genuine-looking friendliness for me. I had been concerned with <hi rend="italic">drugs</hi>, had slept very indifferently the night before (in spite of riding 14 miles and walking above 6!), and was but in poorish order for speaking; nevertheless I contrived to tell them something about poor Cromwell, and I think to convince them that he was a great and true man,&#x2014;the valiant soldier in England of what John Knox had preached in Scotland. It was all right. They continued buying Tickets to the very last,&#x2014;paying out their guinea several of them for <pb id="pg-12-151" n="12:151"/>one Lecture, since they had not come at first to get all the six. Mrs Stanley, a <foreign><hi rend="italic">braw</hi></foreign> and beautiful dame of quality here, sent yesterday to advise that I would order the Porter to sell <hi rend="italic">single</hi> tickets for half a guinea; but I declined; not wishing to make a <hi rend="italic">theatrical performance</hi> of the thing, farther than I could avoid.</p>
<p>In a word, the people seem agreed, and I partly think so too, that it was my <hi rend="italic">best</hi> course of Lectures this; and now, you see, I am right handsomely thro&#x2019; it, and ought to be very thankful,&#x2014;and also to take care how I get into another! Indeed I have a notion that I will not be in haste to throw myself into such a tumble again; it stirs me all up into ferment fret and confusion, such as I hate altogether: and now I have got some fraction of cash, one way and another, and can wait a while: nay if I write my thoughts quietly down in a Book now, I can actually in the long run, and even thro&#x2019; Fraser, get some cash out of that!</p>
<p>I mean to have a full week or so of idling and riding, and considering what is next to be done.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Barclay Fox first called on TC this evening, when he did not return from a ride until after 6 p.m. Fox had brought letters of introduction to both JWC and TC from Sterling, whom he had met at Falmouth. He and his sister Caroline attended the last three lectures. After the fourth, Fox wrote of TC as &#x201C;a black-haired, beetle-browed, wooden-faced, earnest genuine <hi rend="italic">Man</hi>.&#x201D; He recorded the meeting in his journal, his warm welcome, his sense that TC was &#x201C;a delightful companion,&#x201D; TC&#x2019;s &#x201C;extraordinary&#x201D; conversation and wonder at how Sterling &#x201C;ever could have taken orders with his latitudinarian views,&#x201D; and much else. &#x201C;He gave me a deeply interesting sketch of his own life. His sense of the unrealities of the world commenced at 15&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Barclay Fox&#x2019;s Journal</hi>, ed. R. L. Brett [London, <date when="1979-00-00">1979</date>] 192, 196).</note> Indeed I have a great many visits to pay, were there nothing more; for I have rigidly refused to go out anywhere these five weeks past, and must go and see a little now what people are about at last. I will keep my horse a while longer, dear as it is, and try a little farther whether there is not some good use in it, <hi rend="italic">worth</hi> 25/ a week, yea or no!&#x2014; We are very busy with the &#x201C;Public Library&#x201D; too, and hope it will take effect. You perhaps noticed it in the <hi rend="italic">Examiner?</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The notice and the advt., <date when="1840-05-17">17 May</date>.</note></p>
<p>I have written some six or seven letters, while these Lectures went on, to various parties in Dumfriesshire; and got no slightest syllable of response from anybody whatever! I leave that fact standing on its own feet. I will beg of <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, my dear Mother, to write one word, and put it into a cover for me.</p>
<p>John wrote you I suppose? He sent a short notice hither, and said he would write both to Scotsbrig and Dumfries. You sent him the <pb id="pg-12-152" n="12:152"/><hi rend="italic">Tablet</hi> newspaper? If there be anything in any other Paper that you get, pray send it the same road. He is to stay where he is &#x201C;one month more&#x201D;: it is a curious way of bargaining.</p>
<p>I shall have accounts to settle &#x26;c &#x26;c: I will write again when all that is over. God bless you all!</p>
<closer><salute>Yours ever affectionate /</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name>
<ps><p>Perhaps you might forward this Note to Jean, after you have all done with it, at Ecclef<hi rend="italic">n</hi> &#x26; Scotsbrig? <hi rend="italic">Employ</hi> the penny post!</p></ps>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I wrote to you at some length a few days ago; we have, since that, had a Note from your hand;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> and now, all Lecturing being over, I will send you another word.</p>
<p>The Lecturing business went of with sufficient <foreign><hi rend="italic">&#xE9;clat;</hi></foreign> the Course was generally judged, and I rather join therein myself, to be the bad <hi rend="italic">best</hi> I have yet given. On the last day, Friday last, I went to speak of Cromwell, with a head <hi rend="italic">full of air</hi>,&#x2014;you know that wretched physical feeling! I had been concerned with drugs, had awakened at 5, &#x26;c &#x26;c. It is absolute martyrdom; my tongue would hardly wag at all when I got done. Yet the good people sat breathless, or broke out into all kinds of testimonies of good will; seemed to like very much indeed the huge ragged image I gave them, of a <hi rend="italic">believing</hi> Calvinistic soldier and reformer; &#x201C;sun-clear nucleus of intellect and force and faith, in its wild circumambient element of darkness, hypochondria, misery and quasi-madness,&#x2014;in <hi rend="italic">direct</hi> communication, once more, with the innermost Deep of things!&#x201D; In a word, we got right handsomely thro&#x2019;; and ought not to be in haste I apprehend to throw ourselves <hi rend="italic">into</hi> the like again.&#x2014; It seems they did send you the <hi rend="italic">Tablet;</hi> pray send it over hither; either the whole Newspaper, or you may cut out the report, and put it in a cover. The man had drawn up a report of <hi rend="italic">Mahomet</hi> (Lecture Second), but I prohibited him from proceeding. Forster is now drawing up a report of them all, for my own behoof; he for love, and also another man for hire:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Apparently, therefore, Forster (for love) was putting into shape the reports that Keane (duly paid) had taken down verbatim.</note> I have a serious thought of clapping down the thing in a permanent way, and publishing it farther. Forster&#x2019;s seemed to me far the best report; I saw his First Lecture, and requested him to proceed.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-12-153" n="12:153"/>My health is certainly (one would think) better than it was last year; at least I have far more clearness, vigour of mind; but all secondary symptoms seem as bad as ever;&#x2014;want of sleep &#x26;c &#x26;c; and today, over and above, I have caught a troublesome cold, and am to go and dine at the Wilsons&#x2019;s moreover! Daily riding, it seems, avails not. I rush out into the solitary woods and green place; the air is all odorous with blossoms, the sight reposes itself on a world of bursting greenness; three times, out in the Wimbledon region, I have heard the cuckoo,&#x2014;almost with tears! I mean to persevere in riding, for some time yet; dear as it is, fruitless as it seems to be. The Carpenters are putting up sun-blinds too today, in this Library room, which I hope will render it inhabitable. Thank God, I feel as if there did lie a little more work in me,&#x2014;as if my continued life and misery were <hi rend="italic">not</hi> for no purpose.</p>
<p>We are glad you are to try your place still farther. If you do quit it, you will quit it with full knowledge of all the properties it has. A good free insight, a good brave heart, be yours always.</p>
<p>Last night, after long silence, these letters came from Ecclefechan.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> I imagined I had written <hi rend="italic">frequently</hi>, to one or other;&#x2014;but their name is Unpunctuality. I like Alick&#x2019;s Letter better than usual. Write soon, and at large. <closer><salute>Yours ever</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Milnes,</salute>
<p>Your Note<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> arrives at the moment when I was about writing to you, or coming to speak with you (had it not been for this rain), concerning our great Library Scheme;&#x2014;which you, treasonably, deserted last Saturday;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1840-05-23">23 May</date>.</note> but must in no wise desert on Wednesday (tomorrow) at the same place and hour!</p>
<p>Come, and come with some program in your hand of what <hi rend="italic">a Public Meeting</hi> ought to be, and can be, in the present state of matters as to this business. All able men are wanted; some able man is indispensible. We had got 150 names, 50 of them within the last week; scattered indications of all sorts were beginning to show themselves above ground in an altogether hopeful manner: it seemed manifest that the thing <pb id="pg-12-154" n="12:154"/>was extensively taking root; that if we could <hi rend="italic">heat</hi> it by one good burst of sun-splendour, or artificial furnace <hi rend="italic">flash</hi>-splendour, it would germinate straightway, and soon fill all Cockneydom with its boughs and leaves! Come, I say; and get up the natural-artificial <hi rend="italic">caloric</hi> in a workmanlike manner!</p>
<p>Spedding was to speak to Lord Clarendon<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George William Frederick Villiers (<date when="1800-00-00">1800</date>&#x2013;<date when="1870-00-00">1870</date>), 4th Earl of Clarendon, statesman; ambassador at Madrid, <date when="1833-00-00">1833</date>&#x2013;<date when="1839-00-00">39</date>; lord privy seal, <date when="1839-00-00">1839</date>&#x2013;<date when="1841-00-00">41</date>; foreign sec., <date when="1853-00-00">1853</date>&#x2013;<date when="1858-00-00">58</date>, and <date when="1865-00-00">1865</date>&#x2013;<date when="1866-00-00">66</date>.</note> for President; failing whom you were to speak to Lord Northampton: some in the fervour of desperate zeal even proposed Lord Brougham. I went to Pusey yesterday; found him hopefully disposed; got his promise to attend on Wednesday, if some mysterious accident did not prevent. Forster&#x2019;s is N<hi rend="italic">o</hi>. 58, Lincoln&#x2019;s Inn Fields; the hour is half past two. You are actually bound to come;&#x2014;and also to bring Fitzgerald and others; him above all. Is not his invisibility there, in the Carlton Ida, these two weeks, wellnigh inexcusable?<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >E. M. Fitzgerald, still co-sec., of the Carlton Club, yet as remote as Homer&#x2019;s gods on Mount Ida, from which they viewed the Trojan war (<hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> 8).</note> Let him descend, with thunder in his right hand,&#x2014;in the Devil&#x2019;s name!</p>
<p>As to Thursday,&#x2014;I will tell you on Wednesday. I have got cold, I cannot sleep, I have to dine out tonight; I am fast becoming one of the wretchedest of men. Have you any pity? Not you.</p>

<p>Here are two very premature Letters from a certain Mr Macray of Oxford,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Macray (<date when="1796-00-00">1796</date>&#x2013;<date when="1878-00-00">1878</date>), b. in Aberdeen, had worked in London for the foreign booksellers Treuttel &#x26; W&#xfc;rtz, and was currently with John Henry Parker, at Oxford. He was to be librarian of the Taylor Institution, Oxford, <date when="1847-00-00">1847</date>&#x2013;<date when="1871-00-00">71</date>.</note> who wishes to become our Librarian. I answered his first Letter; promising to write again if there arose any likelihood of his being useful to us or our being useful to him. I now give up the Letters to your keeping, as safer than mine.</p>
<p>It seems to me we want greatly a man <hi rend="italic">experienced</hi> in Public Meetings; as yet it all hangs very theoretic to me, very questionable. What <hi rend="italic">is</hi> a Public Meeting?<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The committee was working toward the public meeting to be held on <date when="1840-06-24">24 June</date>.</note> I now, for almost the first time, ask myself that,&#x2014;and know not how to answer.

<p>I have been quite unwell since I saw you. I will <hi rend="italic">attempt</hi> Saturday; yet with no absolute certainty of making it out.</p>

<p>For the last week I have done, according to my determination, nothing. Two of the days I had a dirty cold; it had been long working on me; and at last it came to a head,&#x2014;face-ache, head-ache, sniftering &#x26;c, &#x26;c, very complete indeed! It is all gone now, and I feel distinctly <pb id="pg-12-156" n="12:156"/>better for it: I calculate I shall go on gathering strength now from this point.&#x2014; On Monday I am to <hi rend="italic">begin work;</hi> to begin dealing with those reports of my Lectures, and what I <hi rend="italic">can</hi> and should do with them.</p>
<p>You are very kind, dear Mother, to urge me to come home to you again straightway! Surely I will try what is to be done some time or other in the season; and greatly I shall be disappointed if we do not meet this year again for a longer or a shorter time: but I feel stronger for work now than I did; and I must really begin working here and now,&#x2014;and not run about like a truant and &#x201C;cool-the-loom [lazy person],&#x201D; as I have been obliged to do of late years! If the heat begin to disagree with me, I will run out of London; but we have beautiful weather as yet; and I will keep my horse too so long as I am working. We have got outside shutters put up on my Library room: it is a quite cool agreeable place as yet, and all my tools lie round me in it.&#x2014; I had a Letter from Jean<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> too, urging me greatly; but alas! alas! inclination is one thing, duty is another;&#x2014;we must wait a few weeks to see how the matter will turn.</p>
<p>I inclose you Jack&#x2019;s last Note. I write half a word to him today.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Neither found.</note>&#x2014; To you, dear Mother, I have innumerable things to say: ah me! I can get none of them said at present. God keep you, now and always, you and all of them.</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Your Letter came last night; a prior Note, which must have crossed mine on the road, also arrived duly, and then a copy of the <hi rend="italic">Globe</hi> Newspaper with a report of one of the Lectures. The other <hi rend="italic">Globe</hi> mentioned by you last night as containing a poem of Leigh Hunt&#x2019;s did not come.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Globe</hi>, <date when="1840-05-09">9 May</date>, carried a report, &#x201C;Mr. Carlyle&#x2019;s Lectures,&#x201D; which referred to the first two, and was critical of TC&#x2019;s &#x201C;germanised&#x201D; thought and his &#x201C;tenderness&#x201D; for some &#x201C;mighty great ruffians.&#x201D; &#x201C;For Mr. Carlyle there exists a sort of demigods, who must not be judged by common rules. Once for all, we acknowledge no such people.&#x201D; But it was glad &#x201C;to find so many people at the polite end of town will assemble to hear that powerful though peculiar writer <hi rend="italic">talk</hi> on such matters.&#x201D; The <hi rend="italic">Globe</hi>, <date when="1840-05-28">28 May</date>, pbd. Leigh Hunt&#x2019;s &#x201C;Offering of Gratitude on Her Majesty&#x2019;s Birthday.&#x201D;</note> I have had this Letter of Jean&#x2019;s lying three days by me, waiting till I could enclose it in a cover for you; it must go now &#x201C;inclosed&#x201D; in such despicably brief fashion as you see. I have been unwell, unable for any work, and have not <hi rend="italic">yet</hi> got myself fastened to anything. The sickness however, is going or gone; it rose to the height of a violent <pb id="pg-12-158" n="12:158"/>cold for two days with headache face-ache &#x26;c, &#x26;c, but being then promptly fronted was kind enough to take itself away, and indeed I think to take some ugly sediment of disorder, which had long been working on me, away with it. Your cold, as you say nothing of it, we conclude to be now gone.</p>
<p>I can yet send you no plans; I have yet been able to form none. Unless the weather turn to be insupportable here, I mean to finish out this Lecture concern here where I sit; I have got from Forster this morning a very fair skeleton of Lecture First, and shall straightway begin trying whether I cannot write it out in full; we have also the Library project to watch over (a &#x201C;Public Meeting&#x201D; this day fortnight)<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >It was first planned for Wed., <date when="1840-06-17">17 June</date>, as mentioned here, but was in fact on <date when="1840-06-24">24 June</date>.</note> tho&#x2019; I keep in the distance from that: till these things are over I anticipate no marked change of place or other arrangement. We have green outer blinds on these windows now (Library windows up stairs), which promise to render the room inhabitable even in sunshine: <foreign><hi rend="italic">Frisch zu</hi></foreign> [On with it]! I feel on the whole as if I <hi rend="italic">had</hi> a turn of work in me now; I will not let the mood pass in sleep. It is the only blessedness I have. My horse I still retain, for a while, in spite of its dearth; I suppose it does do me some good: yesterday (cased in your old coat with an old hat, for it was showery and thundery) I went as far as Norwood.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >District in Surrey, ca. six mi. SE of Chelsea.</note> Very beautiful all: I have heard the Cuckoo three times. I rode with Fonblanque of the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> one evening; rather poor company: I feel on the whole better alone. No man nor body of men can do much for me; not if they would take all the trouble in the world: could the whole of them unwrap the baleful Nessus&#x2019;-shirt of perpetual pain and isolation, in which I am lamed, embaled and swathed as in enchantment till I quit this Earth? Not they. Let them go their road; go thou also thine, in God&#x2019;s name!</p>
<p>I have had a host of foolish visitors: American &#x201C;spirits of beauty,&#x201D;&#x2014;one young New England lady<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably Jane Tuckerman; see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400702-TC-RWE-01">TC to RWE, <date when="1840-07-02">2 July</date></ref>.</note> full of shadowy brainwebs about that. Tulke was here one night with Willis;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charles Augustus Tulk and Dr. Robert Willis.</note> dull both, as ditch-water;&#x2014;especially in the Miscellany of foreign and domestic heteroclites (Mazzinis, Thirlwalls and others) who happened to be with us at the time. Nay Macready and his Wife had been here just before; but happily I was out riding at that moment.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Macready noted the visit on <date when="1840-05-31">31 May</date>: &#x201C;We &#x2026; sat half-an-hour with Mrs. Carlyle&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Diaries</hi>, ed.

<p>I have not a moment my escort<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified. Presumably not Charles Buller, though in his letter of <date when="1840-06-05">5 June</date> he speaks of meeting her at Charing Cross to go on a coach.</note> being come and waiting for me</p>

<salute>My dear Sir</salute>
<p>I sent you yesterday a most hurried and illegible note&#x2014;I seem indeed born to be hurried and illegible &#x201C;as the sparks fly upwards.&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Job 5:7.</note>&#x2014; Since writing it my husband has learned from Fraser that the steamboat &#x201C;happened a misfortune&#x201D; (as the Londoners say) ran aground on a rock whereby the book package was greatly damaged&#x2014;</p>
<p>Would it not be best to apply to the Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> agent for a new copy at once returning the old one&#x2014;to be repaired at <hi rend="italic">their</hi> cost instead of my Mothers&#x2014; if we send a new copy from here we have to pay for it just at the same rate as if <supplied>[he?]</supplied> had had nothing earthly to do with the writing of it&#x2014;and Fraser is responsible for the books going out of <hi rend="italic">his</hi> hands in safety.&#x2014; the eighteen pages too are absurd&#x2014;better to have another copy at once&#x2014;and let them pay for their own blunders.</p>
<p>Now dont you think me your evil genius&#x2014;always arising to <hi rend="italic">trouble</hi> you&#x2014; you will not get rid of that impression till you come to see me here w<supplied>[h]</supplied>ere I shall be so glad to bid you welcome, and shall make so much of you that you will find I have a touch of natural feeling in me after all&#x2014;</p>

<salute>Dear Miss Jewsbury,</salute>
<p>Your Letter, the express image of an honest, clear, energetic, humbly and nobly resolute soul, gives me great pleasure, in spite of all my sympathy for what you suffer. Persist in that way, my dear friend; it is the right way; and will lead you (you do not yet guess how) to a happy not an unhappy goal. Understand also that whatever suffering you have, and bitter grief for longings that are are [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] not fulfilled,&#x2014;is but the <hi rend="italic">measure</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">quantity</hi> of right life and worth that is in you! A stone suffers nothing, longs for nothing. Be of comfort in your silent pain; all growth is sickly, painful. At bottom, what is <hi rend="italic">pain</hi> but <hi rend="italic">fatigue</hi>, weariness under the burden that is laid on us? No labour is joyous; it is grievous. Yet the <hi rend="italic">greater</hi> our burden, are not we too the greater,&#x2014;learning to bear that! The end of all labour is peaceable fruit and conquest, if we stand to it.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Heb. 12:11. She had written on <date when="1840-06-08">8 June</date>. Probably what TC thought &#x201C;right&#x201D; was the earnestness and sincerity of her questioning and self-questioning. She had also ended by saying that her &#x201C;notions of right and wrong &#x2026; are somewhat confused.&#x201D;</note> Persist, and faint not&#x2014;</p>
<p>It is by no means clear to me that I could, even by free long-continued speech, throw much light for you on those so natural but yet so unfathomable questions. You yourself (open more and more to small still voices such as speak to us responsive everywhere) will work out a peaceable solution, adequate for your own wants, one day. For us, and for all mortals in all times, the solution must be fractional, a <hi rend="italic">part</hi> only <supplied>[of]</supplied> the <hi rend="small-caps">immeasurable</hi>; cannot possibly be complete, or finally correct. A <hi rend="italic">peaceable</hi> solution, unmutilated by craven falsehood on our own part; some peaceable solution, that will let us work wholesomely <pb id="pg-12-164" n="12:164"/>in welldoing, with the divine Spirit of this universe inspiring us, in whatsoever logical shape: this seems to me the grand result of all. Ours is a world, as old Johnson said, &#x201C;where much is to be <hi rend="italic">done</hi> and little is to be <hi rend="italic">known</hi>.&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Against Inquisitiveness and Perplexing Thoughts,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Prayers and Meditations</hi> (London, <date when="1785-00-00">1785</date>).</note> That is a true saying&#x2014;</p>
<p>To your first question, therefore, what can I answer, but that you do wisely <hi rend="italic">well</hi> to recognize God with worship &#x201C;in every blade of grass.&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >She had written that &#x201C;there are times when I could almost be a Pantheist &#x26; venerate the very Grass in the fields as an embodiment of <hi rend="italic">Him</hi>.&#x201D;</note> That <hi rend="italic">is</hi> God; the Highest reveals himself in that too,&#x2014;how much more in <hi rend="italic">us</hi>, in our perpetually miraculous Life: and our eyes and hearts should be open for him everywhere. At bottom I know not what other worship the like of you can have at present: all liturgies have gone silent; the star-domed temple is the only divine one left.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In reply TC again reverts to arguments and phrases from <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi>, where he also speaks, e.g., of &#x201C;the star-domed City of God&#x201D; (Harrold 264), which is also a phrase from Richter&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Flower, Fruit and Thorn Pieces</hi>.</note> And yet to call this Pantheism,&#x2014;I do not advise that. Call it no <hi rend="italic">ism</hi> at all; follow after it in silence, in truth and humbleness of heart, to get your life guided by it: you will find it actually good and helpful, actually bad and obstructive,&#x2014;in this as in many other ways will &#x201C;Doubt remove itself by Action,&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi> 196; <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister, Works</hi> 23:386.</note> and by that only! But to call the worship one follows (the inner light that keeps one living) by any <hi rend="italic">name</hi>, at present, is to transform it into a wretched logical crotchet; no Faith any more, for most part, but a barren jangle in the argumentative <hi rend="italic">head</hi>.
I laugh at Pantheism when people plague me with it; and ask them, Do you not prefer <hi rend="italic">Pot</hi>-theism rather!<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350604-TC-JOST-01"><sic>8:137</sic><corr>TC to JOST, <date when="1835-06-04">4 June 1835</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014; <hi rend="small-caps">silence, silence</hi>: in a thousand senses I proclaim the indispensable worth of Silence, our only safe dwelling-place often. &#x201C;Who dare <hi rend="italic">name</hi> <hi rend="small-caps">him</hi>?&#x201D; says Faust. Aye who,&#x2014;if we think of it, my Friend! This shallow generation knows nothing of Silence: that is even the <hi rend="italic">disease</hi> of it; will be the death of it, if not cured. &#x201C;Self-renunciation&#x201D; too,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi> 186, 191; <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister, Works</hi> 24:334.</note> that is <hi rend="italic">Silence</hi> in one of its senses. Your own noble heart (go on as you are doing) will teach you better what <hi rend="italic">it is</hi> than any word of mine could. I find it the primary fundamental act required in the Christian and all other moral Laws; the beginning of virtue for a man&#x2014; But this too if we <hi rend="italic">talk</hi> much of it will degenerate into an <hi rend="italic">ism;</hi> a vain babble of no use for us. We must keep this too hidden&#x2014;if possible even from our selves.&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; I will add only one other word; about Physiology: do not study that for such a purpose; it has no light for <pb id="pg-12-165" n="12:165"/>you, but darkness visible, the thing they call Physiology at present.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >She had asked TC to &#x201C;say one word as to the value of <hi rend="italic">Physiology</hi> in regard to this enquiry.&#x201D;</note> &#x201C;Science falsely so called!&#x201D; Man&#x2019;s Body too, is it not &#x201C;a <hi rend="italic">garment</hi> woven in the loom of Heaven?&#x201D;<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >1 Tim. 6:20.</note> I mean that scientifically; in spite of all royal societies, that is the very truth of it. My right hand is miraculous to me (were I not stupid of heart), as miraculous as a soul made visible<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi> 262.</note>&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">is;</hi> as a ghost rising from the dead would be. Consider what <hi rend="italic">is</hi> your right hand. Were there only <hi rend="italic">one</hi> right hand in the world! On the whole, you will see by and by that &#x201C;Materialism&#x201D; is but a black spectral Illusion,&#x2014;to be <hi rend="italic">looked</hi> at, with brave eyes, and then it vanishes, owns itself to be Nothing.<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >She had asked, indirectly, about &#x201C;Materialism,&#x201D; and TC answered her much as in <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi> 3:ch. 8, &#x201C;Natural Supernaturalism.&#x201D;</note></p>
<p>My haste today, dear Miss Jewsbury, is very great, and these are not subjects to be written about in haste. Perhaps I but confuse you, do not forward but obstruct you; I always doubt that, there is such a fundamental <hi rend="italic">infirmity</hi>, vitiating insufficiency, in all <hi rend="italic">words</hi>. Yet your mind seems to me always one I may try to speak to: I speak to you, as to a right brave sister, freely from the heart, with hope at least&#x2014; Friend Goethe says &#x201C;we begin to be in error the first <hi rend="italic">word</hi> we speak!&#x201D;<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390928-TC-JOST-01">TC to <sic>JS</sic><corr>JOST</corr>, <date when="1839-09-28">29 [28] Sept. 1839</date></ref>.</note></p>
<p>Your criticism on <hi rend="italic">Meister</hi> is worthy of what I otherwise know of you. I<supplied>[t]</supplied> is true, modest, genuine&#x2014;I will not say all I think of it, for good reasons&#x2014; There is a soul &#x2018;<foreign><hi rend="italic">grande comme le monde</hi></foreign> [large as the world]&#x2019; in that Book. A kind of old Heathen greatness,&#x2014;for in Heathenism too there was truth; I see not why we should forget true Heathenism altogether&#x2014;stern in its beauty, great, silent, almost cruel-looking is that soul,&#x2014;as the kind great World itself is, withal! Ye<supplied>[t]</supplied> I will agree with you about Lothario.<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jewsbury had written that Goethe&#x2019;s novel would never have had the same influence on her as TC&#x2019;s own works: &#x201C;Goethe sees clearly into the heart of man, &#x26; speaks as one from whom no secrets are hid, but it is with the calmness of one who has ceased to have a personal stake in the joys and sorrows &#x26; strugglings of Life.&#x201D; She deeply felt the story of Mignon, felt some exception to the morality of the episode of Lothario, and expressed surprise that it was &#x201C;the <hi rend="italic">second-rate</hi> characters who have the most passionate suffering to endure,&#x201D; as if &#x201C;the sympathy excited for them is the kind we should bestow on a <hi rend="italic">maimed</hi> or <hi rend="italic">cripple</hi>. Will you tell me whether it <hi rend="italic">should be so?</hi>&#x201D;</note> One never could have written that<supplied>[,]</supplied> one would have left it unwritten. The tragic suffering of the secondary characters is also a real trait of the man, which you have finely discerned  It means I suppose that the truly great soul is superior to pain; <pb id="pg-12-166" n="12:166"/>that <hi rend="italic">pain</hi> (of which a soul, I think, shares exactly in proportion to its greatness) does not with the great soul get the length of <hi rend="italic">disease;</hi> that the <hi rend="italic">lastingl</hi><supplied>[<hi rend="italic">y</hi>]</supplied> <hi rend="italic">miserable is</hi> truly as you say &#x201C;a cripple.&#x201D; Ethnic, Roman, that; but great, and with a truth in it. I thank you much for understandin<supplied>[g]</supplied> it.</p>
<p>I find Goethe&#x2019;s other book<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister&#x2019;s Travels</hi>.</note> here; and send it (today by some coach or other). An old circulating library copy; it belonged honestly to me nevertheless; and now, if you will have it&#x2014;. It is well worth your reading.</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Your long-expected Letter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> came on Saturday; and I fully purposed to answer it, according to your request, &#x2018;that same day.&#x2019; But I was busy over head and ears with writing at the time; thought there would be space enough when my task was done; and, alas, on looking next at the clock, I found that <hi rend="italic">four</hi>, our last post hour, <hi rend="italic">had</hi> already come! I know not how this will now get to you; or whether at all: I send it nevertheless; trusting in David Hope<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >David Hope, of Fleming &#x26; Hope, commission merchants, 26 South Hanover St., Glasgow; see <ref target="volume-02/lt-18220323-TC-DH-01"><sic>2:71</sic><corr>TC to DH, <date when="1822-03-23">23 March 1822</date></corr></ref>.</note> or some other good friend.&#x2014; You will write to me again, of course, from some part of your Highland route; I hope, without delay. I was gratified to find you in Glasgow; in your own country once again: it seemed as if you were far nearer <hi rend="italic">me</hi> too than heretofore. I consider too that you will enjoy yourself more; perhaps do your Patient good. The voyage to America shall remain a private theory till we see how it turn. My own speculation in that direction is also still a mere theory.</p>
<p>We are quite as well as usual; Jane rather better; I have not suffered much from the heat hitherto. My green blinds do me great service; the room has been inhabitable all day; for most part, indeed, I have been close in it till past the heat of the day. I go less into Town than heretofore; the noise and stir there proves really a pain and hurt <pb id="pg-12-167" n="12:167"/>to me: I get a kind of emblem of the country and its composure for an hour by galloping as deep into Surr<supplied>[e]</supplied>y as I can get. One cannot ride in Country lanes for dust, except immediately after rain; one is forced to go upon the <hi rend="italic">watered</hi> ways; our Wandsworth Portsmouth Highway is both much the nearest me, and also the quietest I have fallen in with. Often enough I do not go out at all till towards six o&#x2019;clock; then gallop alone for two hours till tea. It is mournful, but it is not tormenting; it is placid, full of a sad beauty for me. My soul longs vehemently to live altogether in the Country again; and yet there too I should not be well;&#x2014;I shall never be other than ill, wearied, sick-hearted, heavy-laden till once we get to the final rest, I think! God is good. I am a poor poltroon to complain.&#x2014; Dinners I avoid as the very devil. What&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">ta use on them?</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-07/lt-18341224-TC-WG-01"><sic>7:350</sic><corr>TC to WG, <date when="1834-12-24">24 Dec. 1834</date></corr></ref>.</note> What are Lords coming to call on one, and fill one&#x2019;s head with whims? They ask you to go among champagne gases, bright glitter, semi-poisonous excitements, which you do not even like for the moment; and you are sick for a week after. As old Tom White said of whisky, &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Keep</hi> it;&#x2014;Deevil a [if] ever I&#x2019;se better than when there no a drop on&#x2019;t i&#x2019; my <foreign>weam</foreign> [belly]!&#x201D;&#x2014;so say I of dinners, popularity, lords and lionism. Keep it; give it to those that like it!</p>
<p>With a great explosion of ink I have written down my <hi rend="italic">First Lecture</hi>, as it should and could have been; that was the work I was ending on Saturday. I like it very ill, the style I am forced too [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] there; and know not whether I shall persist beyond <hi rend="italic">Mahomet</hi>, the second Lecture. To that I will begin tomorrow. My head is full of ideas;&#x2014;my poor <hi rend="italic">liver</hi> in the state you know of when that is the case!</p>
<p>I have got nothing out of Annandale but Newspapers with due stroking. Write again directly. I have much to say if I knew surely <hi rend="italic">whither</hi>ward.&#x2014;</p>

I am endeavouring to write down <pb id="pg-12-168" n="12:168"/>my Lectures somewhat in the style of <hi rend="italic">speech;</hi> as they were, or rather as they might have been, and should have been, and wished to be, delivered to the people. It is a new kind of task for me; and does not prosper as one would expect. The First Lecture, however, is down, finished off; I mean to do the Second at any rate, to begin it tomorrow: we shall see at the end of that how it looks. I determine on publishing the business somehow or other;&#x2014;in America and here and everywhere,&#x2014;by lecturing, by printing, or such other audible way as I have! The people do not know about it; and many of them ought to know. But I feel often as if I had better have made a Book of it in my own sovereign way, than <hi rend="italic">lectured</hi> it off in that simple prescribed fashion. Perhaps;&#x2014;and also perhaps not. We shall see.</p>
<p>I stay here; because I <hi rend="italic">am</hi> here, and see not on the whole where I could get forward with my work much better. The heat has never yet afflicted me much: I have <hi rend="italic">outer</hi> blinds, which are a great help; in very glaring days I stay in altogether till night. The horse is of considerable use; carries me out into the clear afternoon air, the bright greenness of the world; shews me how like Elysium it is. Alas, I know well, if I were there daily and always I should care little for it. Except on compulsion I go little into the Town; call on nobody there;&#x2014;they can come here, if they want me; if not, I shall like it still better. Our old wooden Battersea Bridge takes me over the River (a toll of one penny or one halfpenny renders even walkers <hi rend="italic">scarce</hi> on the other side);<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The wooden bridge of seventeen arches exacted tolls until <date when="1878-00-00">1878</date>, and was replaced by an iron suspension bridge in <date when="1881-00-00">1881</date>.</note> in ten minutes&#x2019; swift trotting I am fairly away from the Monster and its bricks; all lies behind me like an enormous world-filling <foreign><hi rend="italic">pluister</hi></foreign> [muddle], infinite potter&#x2019;s furnace,&#x2014;sea of smoke, with steeples, domes, gilt crosses, high black architecture swimming in it: really beautiful to look at from some knoll top, while the sun shines on it. I plug away, away, some half-dozen miles out; the Monster is then quite buried,&#x2014;its smoke rising like a great dusky-coloured mountain, melting into the infinite clear sky: all is green, musical, bright; one feels that it is God&#x2019;s world this, and not an infinite Cockneydom of <foreign><hi rend="italic">stoor</hi></foreign> [cloud of dust and smoke] and din after all! Enough of it at present.</p>
<p>Our Doctor wrote to me on Saturday from Glasgow!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> He is there, or rather was there then, with his Patient, on a tour to the Highlands. All well, he indicates; but his Letter is as brief as need be. I was to write that very day (Saturday) but did not, having missed my chance, till this morning: &#x201C;Post-Office, Glasgow&#x201D;;&#x2014;I hope some one will be there still to forward it. He seems to speak of probably staying &#x201C;till <pb id="pg-12-169" n="12:169"/><date when="1840-08-00">August</date>&#x201D;: but all is dim in the account he gives; vague as ever.&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; By the bye can you explain to me how I got <hi rend="italic">two</hi> Courier Newspapers last Saturday! One in the morning, one at night.</p>
<p>My dear Mother must be apprised of Jack and me; that we are well. Explain how busy I am&#x2014;ah me! Send on this Note, that will be the best way  Till I have another hour&#x2019;s leisure. Commend us to James, and <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the rest. <closer><salute>Good be ever with you all!</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I fear you think me <supplied>[an un]</supplied>natural <foreign><hi rend="italic">bairn</hi></foreign>, neither to come to you <supplied>[when you]</supplied> ask me; nor even to write, now when le<supplied>[tters are so]</supplied> cheap. Alas, I forget you no day of my life I am very busy; writing down my Lectures; bu<supplied>[st]</supplied>ling hither and thither; I can only send silent thoughts to you for most part. I have got the first Lecture fairly down; I am fairly into the second: I will put it down too, come of it what may. The thing must, in some shape, be published farther. Occasionally I have <hi rend="italic">fits</hi> of bilious depression: but on the whole I almost think my general health is decidedly improving. Sometimes I feel as if I might yet be healthy again! Nay, after all, what would I do with health, if not <hi rend="italic">write</hi> true good words and books with it,&#x2014;as I am endeavouring to write them <supplied>[even]</supplied> with the health I have? One should not <supplied>[compl]</supplied>ain; I should not.</p>
<p><supplied>[Heat]</supplied> has never much troubled me yet: <supplied>[the new]</supplied> outer blinds keep out the sun well, <supplied>[and r]</supplied>ender this room of mine up-stairs among <supplied>[my]</supplied> books always habitable enough. Indeed we have very frequent showers,&#x2014;not so good for the hayharvest, which is in full progress everywhere: but making truly delightful weather. My horse does not do me all the good I had hoped; but it does do me good; I mean to keep it, and try it farther. If at any time the weather should grow to <hi rend="italic">burn me out</hi>, I could mount the mare, and ride off towards you, without consulting anybody! It will disappoint me much if I do not see you some way this season too.</p>
<p>I keep out of the way of all people as much as possible. Whoever wants to see me has to co<supplied>[me]</supplied> hither; I seldom want to see anybod<supplied>[y; go]</supplied> out nowhither, except on great occas<supplied>[ions. The]</supplied> other morning I went to break<supplied>[fast with]</supplied> an ancient notability here; one <supplied>[R]</supplied>og<supplied>[ers,]</supplied> <pb id="pg-12-170" n="12:170"/>a very fine old man. We had Lords <supplied>[and]</supplied> fine ladies: the Queen of the Eglinton T<supplied>[in Tour]</supplied>nament, she they called &#x201C;the Queen of Beauty<supplied>[&#x201D;]</supplied> was there,&#x2014;really as beautiful a creature as I ever saw; worthy of something better than a Tin Tournament! I returned sick for the day; as indeed I expected to be. This afternoon, indeed directly <hi rend="italic">this minute</hi> (had I once ended), I am to attend a committee-meeting of London Library people; I suppose I shall have to make a kind of <hi rend="italic">speech</hi> on Wednesday: this too I could not help. But my <hi rend="italic">work</hi> is writing these Lectures; I feel that all else is idle; that I have no other work.&#x2014; Jane flourishes in the warm weather; desires no better.</p>
<p>Jack you perhaps know already is in Scot<supplied>[land w]</supplied>ith his patient; on a bathing expedition to Ob<supplied>[an in Argyll]</supplied>shire! He wrote to me twice from <supplied>[Glasgow. I sent]</supplied> you his last letter. All goes <supplied>[well e]</supplied>nough with him, as it seems. He con<supplied>[tri]</supplied>ves always to have travelling. A great Traveller; from Pepperfield onwards!</p>
<p>I must write to Jamie soon. I owe Alick a Letter. They must have patience with me Ali<supplied>[ck]</supplied> will regret sore to hear that my poor tobacco is <hi rend="italic">all</hi> spoiling, do what I will! I think I must send it all back to be sold at half price;&#x2014;and also <hi rend="italic">not</hi> trouble my kind brothers any more with my tobacco botheration!</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I received today your second Letter, dated Inverary.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> I had sent on two Newspapers to Oban, which I hoped would indicate that we had heard of your whereabout, and that all was well here. I have still no word out of Annandale; I wrote to my Mother on Saturday, enclosing your <hi rend="italic">second</hi> Glasgow Letter; the first I keep here. You must take this Line as a widow&#x2019;s-mite<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mark 12:42.</note> from me tonight: it is all I can find leisure for; indeed when it tells you that I am busy and in my usual way of health, it has told you all.</p>
<p>My first Lecture does not in the least <supplied>[please?]</supplied> me; but it lies written, and may lie till we see. The Second only began to move with any freedom this day. The wheels get clogged; the steam, once low, is difficult to get up again. I had an ugly fit of I know not what,&#x2014;indigestion <pb id="pg-12-171" n="12:171"/>produced by hot weather, I suppose,&#x2014;and could not write during that; but it is over now. I will go on with such light as I have on this matter of <hi rend="italic">Heroes;</hi> it decidedly ought to be published, and shall in some way or other, I hope. <hi rend="italic">Mahomet</hi> will serve me another week yet, or more. There was a paragraph of <foreign><hi rend="italic">blarney</hi></foreign> in Aird&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Herald</hi> today about the thing;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In the issue of <date when="1840-06-18">18 June</date>, in a letter to the editor: &#x201C;You are an admirer of Thomas Carlyle and have done something to make known the rugged masses of his strength, with the sweet unsuspected flowers of beauty, gentleness, and mercy, bursting in a thousand tangled knots from their unearthly fissures. I heard Christopher North say lately that Carlyle&#x2019;s French Revolution is never off his table, so fascinated is he with that prodigious amalgam.&#x201D; The writer enclosed a list of the lectures on heroes, with the hope that TC had preserved them, since he ought to write a history of the world. &#x201C;I need scarcely say that &#x2026; though he is a little child in his uneasy diffidence to face his London audience,&#x201D; he &#x201C;never fails to do the giant when he gets a little heated in wrestling with his vast themes: how he breaks the jaws and backbone of monstrous difficulties. Mastadons and megatherions are in his hands as mice.&#x201D; Signed &#x201C;Gangrel.&#x201D;</note> I sent it forward to my Mother thro&#x2019; Jean: I once thought of sending it to Oban; but I had already made up the <hi rend="italic">Tablet</hi> for you, and fancied you had enough in that. It is got up by one Lucas here, a Roman Catholic, cidevant Quaker; he told me <hi rend="italic">I</hi> had converted him! <foreign><hi rend="italic">Troppo grazia Sant&#x2019; Antonio</hi></foreign> [Too much thanks, Saint Antony]!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Italian saying meaning &#x201C;too much of a good thing.&#x201D;</note> Do you remember the Italian old gentleman who could not get upon his saddle, who prayed to Saint Antony, and then with a terrible effort&#x2014;went over on the other side? <foreign><hi rend="small-caps">Troppo</hi> <hi rend="italic">grazia</hi></foreign>.&#x2014;</p>
<p>On Wednesday we are to have a Public Meeting for that Library affair. I apprehend it will be but flat; I have taken little trouble with it; I am to make some kind of speech, along with the others. The thing seems really as if it were taking life. You will see some record of our meeting in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, I fancy.</p>
<p>Leigh Hunt has left this quarter, for Edwardes Square, Kensington; we are decidedly rather glad of it. Our intercourse lately had reduced itself altogether to the <hi rend="italic">lending of sovereigns</hi>  Poor Hunt had great difficulty to get away at last; had to prowl about, borrowing &#x26;c &#x26;c. He has dissatisfied all his friends by his late behaviour during what he reckoned his theatrical <hi rend="italic">success</hi>, which proves to be no success either, for they do not now act his play. He is a born fool. His son has got out of the Glasgow <hi rend="italic">Argus</hi>, and is here too. They are a generation of fools.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For Hunt&#x2019;s play, see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400211-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1840-02-11">11 Feb.</date></ref>; his son is Thornton Hunt; and cf. Job 30:8, &#x201C;children of fools.&#x201D;</note> They are better in Edwardes Square.</p>
<p>The other morning I went to Rogers&#x2019;s; met Mrs Norton and her sister the Queen of Beauty,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Caroline Norton and Jane Georgiana, Lady Seymour.</note>&#x2014;truly a most beautiful creature, well <pb id="pg-12-172" n="12:172"/>worth looking at when one has opportunity. I had seen her transiently before. Mrs Norton did not seem in any way so superlative; sweet-voiced, frank, discursive, no longer setting up for a beauty, she too was likeable. Lord Landsdown and a handful of other eminencies were there. I got a headache for the day. Tomorrow night we go to Taylor&#x2019;s; probably to meet Spring-Ricedom.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henry Taylor had m. Theodosia Alice Spring Rice, <date when="1839-10-00">Oct. 1839</date>.</note> Last night we were at a Dud called Swynfen Jervis&#x2019;s: O&#x2019;Connel<supplied>[l]</supplied>, Bowring, Hickson, Southwood Smith, <hi rend="italic">pinchbeck</hi> people all; what I called a &#x201C;literary-political swell-mob.&#x201D; Jane had a headache today in consequence. O&#x2019;Connell is beginning to look very old.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Daniel O&#x2019;Connell (age 65), John Bowring, William Hickson, and Dr. Thomas Southwood Smith.</note> There was a &#x201C;celebrated Florentine&#x201D; Signora Vespucci<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >America Vespucci, apparently the only living descendant of Amerigo Vespucci; Lucretia Mott (see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400912-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1840-09-12">12 Sept.</date></ref>) met and exchanged cards with her, <date when="1840-06-24">24 June</date>, at the abolitionists&#x2019; tea at the Crown and Anchor.</note> there, very dashing, in turbans and stage tragicalities; but she spoke only French; and I declined doing more than look. The Earth has bubbles!<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Macbeth</hi> 1. 3.</note></p>
<p>You bring me in mind of those great dumb masses of Highland Mountains with their melancholy seas and glens; the most impressive thing I have yet seen on Earth. I wish I were on the sand-beach beside you; the great Ocean, instead of Cockneydom, inarticulately talking to me! But <foreign><hi rend="italic">das geht nicht</hi></foreign> [that&#x2019;s impossible]. Why should I complain? I cantered round by Wimbledon this day (it is growing a common route of mine) by lanes of respectable loneliness, amid mere verdure, umbrage and the fragrance of hay: one had no sea, one cannot have everything.</p>
<p>If you do part from your office in Autumn, it will be a rare profit to take a tour with me! I shall be about free then too; if you had a horse and were here&#x2014;! I really often think of having a ride <hi rend="italic">in England</hi>, go where I may next. You may think about it as a thing <hi rend="italic">I</hi> were ready for. We can hope; we shall see.</p>
<p>There was surely something more I had to add! But I have forgotten it. <foreign>Adieu</foreign> for this night, dear Brother!&#x2014; Oh, this was it: I saw John Greig the American.<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Greig of Canandaigua (<ref target="volume-08/lt-18360205-TC-AC-01"><sic>8:297</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1836-02-05">5 Feb. 1836</date></corr></ref>).</note> Alibama [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] Stock, <hi rend="italic">he</hi> says, is good.

<salute>My dear Alick,</salute>
<p>I will snatch up this little half hour I have, and send you a word, in discharge of my long debt to you. In these days I am so busy, and so lame for any kind of work not forced upon me, especially for any <hi rend="italic">writing</hi> work!</p>
<p>I am within about a day of ending my Second Lecture; then we had a Public Meeting about our London Library this week; and people come in and take me up: very busy indeed! But I ought to fling you a word too, at short intervals, to say how it stands with me.</p>
<p>What will become of these Lectures I do not yet know; nor whether in the written state they are worth much: however, I write them, you see. It is a kind of ungainly job, and I am not very fit for it; yet it ought to be done, I think, some way or other. I will have a day or two of play again, were this Second Lecture done; we shall then consider farther.</p>
<p>Our Public Meeting, at which I had to make a speech, was considered to have gone off beautifully. I did not speak long; but kept the people all in first-rate spirits while I did speak. I am told there is a good report of the business in the <hi rend="italic">Morning Chronicle</hi> of yesterday: I sent out this morning to get it; but the unfortunate Newsvender had it net, and in this huge whirlpool if you do not take a paper on the day of its coming out, nobody has it afterwards; it is gone, and only by mere chance can you get it at all! If I do find a copy, I will send it to <pb id="pg-12-174" n="12:174"/>you. We had &#x201C;noble lords,&#x201D; and what not, a very fair turn out of people;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For the London Library meeting, at the Freemasons&#x2019; Tavern, with Lord Eliot in the chair, instead of Lord Clarendon as announced. Lord Monteagle and the Rev. H. H. Milman spoke first, followed by Lord Lyttelton, who proposed that such a library would present many advantages not offered by the British Museum or by circulating libraries. He was seconded by TC, who was received with loud cheering: &#x201C;He said it would not become them, who were yet only struggling for existence, were merely nascent, and had nothing but hopes and a good purpose, to commence by casting any censure on the British Museum. Accordingly they meant no censure by this resolution. They would leave the British Museum standing on its own basis, and be very thankful that such a library did exist in this country. But, supposing it to be managed with the most perfect skill and success, even according to the idea of such an institution, still he would assert that this other library of theirs was requisite also. In the first place, by the very nature of the thing, a great quantity of people were excluded altogether from the British Museum as a reading-room. Every man engaged in business was occupied during the hours in which it was kept open, and innumerable classes of persons found it extremely inconvenient to attend the British Museum Library at all. But granting that they could all go there, he would ask any literary man, any reader of books, any man intimately acquainted with the reading of books, whether he could read them to any purpose in the British Museum? (Cheers). A book was a kind of thing that required a man to be self-collected. He must be alone with it. (Cheers.) A good book was the purest essence of a human soul. How could a man take it in a crowd, with bustle of all sorts going on around him? The good of a book was not the facts that could be got out of it, but the kind of resonance that it awakened in our own minds. (Cheers.)
A book might strike out of us a thousand things, might make us know a thousand things, which it did not know itself. For this purpose he decidedly said that no man could read a book well with the bustle of three or four hundred people about him. Even forgetting the mere facts which a book contained, a man could do more with it in his own apartment, in the solitude of one night, than in a week in such a place as the British Museum. Neither with regard to circulating libraries were they bound to utter any kind of censure; circulating libraries were what they could be in the circumstances. He believed, if a man had the heroism to collect a body of great books, to get together the cream of the knowledge that existed in the world, and let it be gradually known that he had such a library, that he would find his advantage in it in the long run; but it would be only in the long run; he must wait ten or twenty years, perhaps a lifetime; he must be a kind of martyr. You could not expect a purveyor of circulating literature to be that. (Cheers and laughter.) The question for such a person to ask was not &#x2018;Are you wanting to read a wise book?&#x2019; but, &#x2018;Have you got sixpence in your pocket to pay for the reading of any book?&#x2019; (Laughter.) Consequently he must have an eye to the prurient appetite of the great million, and furnish them with any kind of garbage they would have. The result was melancholy&#x2014;making bad worse&#x2014;for every bad book begot an appetite for reading a worse one. (Cheers.) Thus they came to the age of pinchbeck in literature, and to falsehood of all kinds. So leaving all other institutions and the British Museum and the circulating libraries to stand, he said that a deservedly good library of good books was a crying want in this great London. How could he be called on to demonstrate a thing that was as clear as the sun? London had more men and intellects waiting to be developed than any place in the world ever had assembled.
Yet there was no place on the civilised earth so ill supplied with materials for reading for those who were not rich. (Cheers.) He had read an account of a public library in Iceland, which the King of Denmark had founded there. There was not a peasant in Iceland that could not bring home books to his hut better than men could in London. Positively it was a kind of disgrace to us, which we ought to assemble and put an end to with all convenient despatch. (Cheers.) The founding of a library was one of the greatest things we could do with regard to results. It was one of the quietest of all things. But there was nothing that he knew of at the bottom more important. Every one able to read a good book became a wiser man. He became a similar centre of light and order, and of just insight into the things around him. A collection of good books contained all the nobleness and wisdom of the world before us. Every heroic and victorious soul had left his stamp upon it. This collection of books was the best of all universities. For the university only taught how to read the book. You must go to the book itself for what was in it. He called it a church also. Every devout soul that ever lived spoke out of it. It was a church, but with no quarrelling; no church-rates&#x2014;(the remainder of the sentence was drowned in cheers and laughter, in the midst of which Mr. Carlyle sat down.)&#x2014; The resolution was passed unanimously.&#x201D; TC was followed by other speakers, including Charles Buller, who said that, &#x201C;great as was the disadvantage of following Mr. Carlyle, it had one advantage, in reminding him of the University of Edinburgh, to the library of which they had both been indebted.&#x201D; A committee was then appointed, and the meeting adjourned. From the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, <date when="1840-06-28">28 June</date>; see also the <hi rend="italic">Morning Chronicle</hi>, <date when="1840-06-25">25 June</date>; Shepherd, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi> 1:217&#x2013;21; A. Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">NL</hi> 1:198&#x2013;200; and Harrison 61&#x2013;72. The <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, <date when="1840-06-25">25 June</date>, noted that &#x201C;the number of persons present was not very great, though the room in which the meeting took place, being small, was filled.&#x201D;</note> it is thought our Library will actually get itself established by and by: a thing pressingly wanted here.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-12-175" n="12:175"/>Jack now dates from Oban; I had another line from him today; it contains little except an address I am to put on some Books for him; I will keep <hi rend="italic">it</hi>, and send you the prior one. All is well with him; but he still talks of quitting the business in <date when="1840-08-00">August</date>.</p>
<p>How are Jenny and the little Newcomer?<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James (d. <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>).</note> Jean, from whom I had a Note the other day, mentions that our Mother is &#x201C;somewhat out of sorts&#x201D;: I wish I heard something more about that! She was expected to write to Jean, and Jean was to send the Letter; but nothing as yet comes. I hope she is getting round again; I will not let myself get into fear.&#x2014; Jamie&#x2019;s cattle were mislucking, Jean said; her own little child was not thriving: many things were more or less out of joint. I know Jean always tells me the worst, the truth whatever it may be. That is a comfort.</p>
<p>Our weather is far from <hi rend="italic">too warm</hi> here; these two days we have a Northwind, which has driven Jane to light her fire again. Frequent rains fall; it is in general a delightful London June for me. I still ride daily almost, in the country far oftenest: my unfortunate liver ought to be better than it is!</p>
<p>In my Mother&#x2019;s Letter I mentioned that the tobacco was <hi rend="italic">all</hi> spoiling on me. In truth, it seemed all <hi rend="italic">spoiled</hi>, when I broke into the jars the other day: I had taken out the whole <hi rend="italic">mouldy</hi> part some weeks before, dried the remainder, packed it quite loose and set it by; I had <pb id="pg-12-176" n="12:176"/>smoked diligently to get thro&#x2019; the damaged portion, and now went to rejoice in the sound,&#x2014;when, lo, this too was become mouldy, and had a taste and smell altogether wretched! I thought I should have to send it back, not knowing what to do with it here. But after being spread out for a week and <hi rend="italic">thoroughly</hi> dried, it has improved not a little, and can be smoked now without difficulty; indeed it is better yet than any I know how to buy here. I have spread it loose in a broad open box, and hope to keep it without farther damage.&#x2014; I was very much vexed, and <foreign><hi rend="italic">wae</hi></foreign>, not for the loss of the weed, but to think how my poor brother had done all he could, and taken such pains to serve me in this; and it was all to be a failure! Yet I liked you better, it made it sadder and kindlier, even <hi rend="italic">because</hi> it had failed, and gone all for nothing.&#x2014; Happily it turns out not so bad, however. I believe the Tobacco to have been perfectly good at first; but very wet, and we did not know how to keep it in hot weather. It should have been left loose, loose, and not excluded from the air. We will <foreign>ken</foreign> [know] again! I find also that all tobacco ought to be of a certain age. None I ever get, even of the best sort, is like that I used to get from your shop,&#x2014;when it could gain nothing except increase of age.&#x2014;</p>
<p>Jack in that Letter speaks of travelling! He has always schemes of locomotion. I know not what I shall do: I am at work here; must work; and the weather does not as yet obstruct me. There is no good <foreign><hi rend="italic">raiking</hi></foreign> [wandering] if one can help it.</p>
<p>Will you tell Jamie that I consider myself a Letter in his debt: I deeply sympathize about poor Tom, which I suppose is the misfortune he cares about beyond all: but the child will perhaps get round again; one must have patience, have hope.&#x2014; Jean, I think, ought to go to Mary&#x2019;s with her child, for a little sea air.&#x2014; Let my Mother write half a word with her own hand!</p>
<p>Take my best blessing one and all of you.</p>

</bibl><sourceNote>TC-EOT, [<date when="1840-06-27">27 June</date>]. MS: FC. Quot: Fielding, <hi rend="italic">L&#x26;S</hi> 34&#x2013;35. Sent to the ed., refused &#x201C;for the sake of avoiding controversy,&#x201D; and returned on request. Forster advised against publication elsewhere (<ref target="volume-12/lt-18400702-TC-JF-01">TC to JF, <date when="1840-07-02">2 July</date></ref>). The letter was written in answer to a letter in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, <date when="1840-06-26">26 June</date>, against the London Library: &#x201C;I cannot help expressing the utmost astonishment at the approbation which you have been pleased to bestow, in Wednesday&#x2019;s number, on as foolish a concern as was ever offered to the public. When I say &#x2018;foolish,&#x2019; observe, I do not mean to confine my description to that word only, for seldom are fools concerned in any work or enterprise by themselves; they are usually drawn in by others of a different character&#x2014;not wise, indeed, but cunning, crafty, guileful. The project which you seem to cherish, and which I deprecate as mere humbug, is A SCHEME FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A NEW LIBRARY OF A MOST COMPREHENSIVE CHARACTER. Comprehensive, indeed! And you, too, Mr. Editor, to recommend such a project, whose daily publication is itself a library! This is most unbecoming in you.&#x201D; It referred to the meeting of <date when="1840-06-24">24 June</date>. &#x201C;Of all the things upon earth, I apprehend a library is one, which is least wanted in this metropolis; there is hardly a street without one: all the Club-houses have libraries; parish vestries have lending libraries; booksellers, circulating libraries.&#x201D; The writer could see no point in its being possible to borrow books: &#x201C;If a man were to take home for his perusal the excellently learned and profound works on the inductive sciences recently published by Professor Whewell, from this new library, he would also have to wheel down the street a barrowful of other books along with them, for the purpose of reference and explanation. &#x2026; Do, Mr. Editor, redeem your error, and prevent a set of cormorants from feeding on gulls.&#x201D; Signed, &#x201C;ORBILIUS / Chatham-place.&#x201D; The <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> commented: &#x201C;A Correspondent of ours &#x2026; &#x2018;ORBILIUS&#x2019; (and he seems to be of the &#x2018;Plagosus&#x2019; kind too), censures very justly some scheme of a newly concocted library of which he says we have approved. There are, no doubt, some well-meaning men engaged in the plan; but the article which we published was &#x2018;from a correspondent&#x2019; and if we seemed to concur in his view of the subject, it was from inadvertence in the hurry of putting together the paper.&#x201D;</sourceNote><head>

<dateline>[<date when="1840-06-27">27 June 1840</date>]</dateline>
<p><salute>Mr Editor,&#x2014;</salute>Orbilius,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Horace&#x2019;s schoolmaster, Orbilius Pupillus (ca. <date>112</date>&#x2013;ca. <date>17 <hi rend="small-caps">b.c.</hi></date>), whom Horace described as fond of flogging.</note> whom you surname Plagosus [one who likes to flog], your correspondent of Friday last,&#x2014;who surely is a polite man <pb id="pg-12-177" n="12:177"/>for one thing,&#x2014;rushes out into the street with a noble zeal to defend the cause of suffering Humanity; but I doubt whether, on that subject of the London Library, he is well instructed.</p>
<p>It seems, Orbilius cannot peruse &#x201C;the excellently learned and profound works of Professor Whewell&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Whewell (<date when="1794-00-00">1794</date>&#x2013;<date when="1866-00-00">1866</date>), English philosopher and mathematician; prof. of moral philosophy, Cambridge, <date when="1838-00-00">1838</date>&#x2013;<date when="1855-00-00">55</date>; master of Trinity College, <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>&#x2013;<date when="1866-00-00">66</date>; author of a <hi rend="italic">History of the Inductive Sciences</hi>, 3 vols. (London, <date when="1837-00-00">1837</date>), and other works.</note> without a &#x201C;barrowful of other books&#x201D; to refer to. Really it is a hard case; and if matters do stand so, it may in truth <hi rend="italic">be</hi> the best plan for Orbilius to peruse those excellently learned and profound works at the British Museum rather than elsewhere. He will find, however, I should hope, a few other good books, which he <hi rend="italic">can</hi> read <foreign>seriatim</foreign>, one or two at a time, without a wheelbarrowful all going on at once. These others he will like better to read at home. How it may stand with Professor Whewell I know not; but if Orbilius can read, to his satisfaction, works of real depth and excellence in any kind, such as are usually thought to require study, meditation, self-concentration, in the bustle, dust and din inseparable from the active presence of five hundred persons,&#x2014;he possesses a faculty which many of Her Majesty&#x2019;s subjects are in want of.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-12-178" n="12:178"/>But, adds he, there are Lending Libraries, Circulating Libraries, Vestry Libraries, &#x201C;scores of them,&#x201D; in every Street. Will Orbilius have the kindness to mention in what Street, at what Number, there is a Lending Library such, I do not say, as there should be in the greatest City of the world, but at all comparable to such as already are in Bristol, Norwich, Liverpool, Leeds, and generally in all towns of the British Empire, and indeed of the civilized World,&#x2014;London alone excepted! Does Orbilius know that there are six Government Libraries in Paris, several of them far superior in all respects to our Museum one; all of which, open, lighted, and warmed, till late night, are accessible to the poorest working man; all of which moreover <hi rend="italic">lend</hi> books freely to whosoever has real claims on them? That there is a similar Government Library in every considerable Departmental Town in France? That in Germany, not twice as populous as England, perhaps not a tenth-part as wealthy, there are three hundred of such Public Libraries;&#x2014;one of which, the Munich one, some years ago, offered to exchange <hi rend="italic">duplicate</hi> volumes with our Museum, to the extent of 150,000 volumes, which proposal was respectfully declined?<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In <date when="1828-00-00">1828</date>; see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18280417-TC-DI-01"><sic>9:387&#x2013;88</sic><corr>TC to DI, <date when="1828-04-17">17 April 1828</date></corr></ref>.</note> Does he know that there is in Iceland itself, in the wretched fishy village of Reykiavik, a Public Lending Library, free to all Icelanders, very decidedly better than any such that exists in London? Has Orbilius examined the Advocate&#x2019;s Library in Edinburgh, and the good and evil that results therefrom? The Signet Library in Edinburgh? The Merchant&#x2019;s Library?<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Apparently a library and reading-room in Merchants&#x2019; Hall, Hunter Sq., the premises, <date when="1790-00-00">1790</date>&#x2013;<date when="1879-00-00">1879</date>, of the Merchants&#x2019; Company of Edinburgh.</note> Has he ever read in any good history, any considerable number of good books? any good book? Does he know anything at all about Libraries or Books or reading?&#x2014; In that case, what has he to do with this project, except close his lips about it, till he get some understanding of it,&#x2014;convince himself that it is a right good project, and then forward it with his whole heart and his whole soul! He says the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> Newspaper is a daily Library. Alas, <hi rend="italic">he</hi> has never had a course of reading in Iceland!</p>
<p>Orbilius concludes with an admonition to prevent &#x201C;a set of cormorants from feeding on gulls.&#x201D; So many eminent persons in Church and State, Bishop of Salisbury, Lords Eliot, Clarendon, Monteagle, Lyttleton,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Rev. Edward Denison the elder (<date when="1801-00-00">1801</date>&#x2013;<date when="1854-00-00">54</date>), D.D. and bishop of Salisbury, <date when="1837-00-00">1837</date>. George William Lyttelton (<date when="1817-00-00">1817</date>&#x2013;<date when="1876-00-00">76</date>), 4th baron, educated at Eton and Trinity College, Cambridge. He had pbd. some trans. with Gladstone, <date when="1839-00-00">1839</date>; was fellow of the Royal Society, <date when="1840-00-00">1840</date>; principal of Queen&#x2019;s College, Birmingham, <date when="1845-00-00">1845</date>; and under-sec. of state for the colonies, <date when="1846-00-00">1846</date>. He had a distinguished career in public life showing an effective interest in education. Lyttelton, Clarendon, and Eliot were all to become vice-presidents of the London Library in <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>.</note>&#x2014;their names, position, procedure in this business, indicate to <pb id="pg-12-179" n="12:179"/>Orbilius that they wish to pick his pocket of five pounds! Orbilius clearly is not a cormorant; he will do no feats in that line. But has he reflected that, in important concerns of life, such as this and some others, the most fatally situated of all gulls is the one who lives in undue terror of being gulled? Here are a set of beneficent persons, coming to him with the first of blessings, true spiritual nourishment, that is to say good reading; he too is to have a taste, probably for the first time, of true spiritual nourishment; and his heart would leap with joy if he once got to taste it: but no; spying their advent from afar, he cries, &#x201C;Cormorants! coming to eat me!&#x201D;&#x2014;and flies, with a shriek, into the hungry wastes again.</p>
<p><closer><salute>Praying to Heaven that this London Subscription Library were once fairly open; and that no Orbilius, Plagosus, Asinosus [Ass], or other honest man however stupid, may be eaten,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Your <hi rend="italic">Miscellany</hi> Book is off to Edinburgh, addressed according to your order for Glen at Dunlop&#x2019;s in Millar [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] Street Glasgow.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Archibald Glen at James Dunlop &#x26; Sons, 86 Miller St.</note> The two pairs of trowsers were discovered where you indicated, at least the two we thought you must mean; and sent along with the Book. Fraser intimates this morning that they are off; probably they will be in Glasgow by the time this reaches you. I hope no delay will occur; if any do occur, Glen had better apply to Fraser&#x2019;s Publisher in Edinburgh,&#x2014;whose name I think is <hi rend="italic">Menzies</hi>, but whom any Glasgow Book-seller*<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Menzies, 61 Princes St.; see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18371204-TC-HI-01"><sic>9:355</sic><corr>TC to HI, <date when="1837-12-04">4 Dec. 1837</date></corr></ref>. TC&#x2019;s asterisk indicates a marginal note, &#x201C;Nay the Magazine itself will!&#x201D; but <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s</hi> does not give the address.</note> will be able to give him the address of. There is a Fraserian Parcel monthly <hi rend="italic">direct</hi> for Glasgow; but that goes by land all the way, Fraser unwilling to load it beyond necessity; and indeed at any rate owing to miscalculation (on Fraser&#x2019;s own part, or his man&#x2019;s) the trowsers proved to be <hi rend="italic">too late</hi> for having gone by that. I hope all will <pb id="pg-12-180" n="12:180"/>come safely and be of use to you.&#x2014; Are you returned from the Hebrides? Your solitude among those ancient mountains, by the Ocean strand there, with no society but your Patient&#x2019;s, must be deep! As distasteful almost, as <hi rend="italic">this</hi> overcrowded ever-bustling half-maddening way of life is to me! One cannot help his way of life at all times. I am very sick of living here; but know not, on the whole, whither I could hopefully turn to make myself much better. My Horse, at 5 guineas a month, begins to seem to me decidedly too dear. The traceable benefit is small or none; the very <foreign><hi rend="italic">fash</hi></foreign> of the thing is great. In another month or so I think I shall part with my quadruped in some rational way; and not be in haste to resume the like.</p>
<p>These three days I have been kept in quite <hi rend="italic">special</hi> annoyance by two summonses to go up to Westminster, and serve <hi rend="italic">as a Special Juryman</hi>;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >One selected to try important civil cases.</note>&#x2014;in two different courts both at once too, is not that a peculiar beauty! The whole aspect of the thing, the maddest-looking stew of lies and dust and foul breath, fills me with despair. I attended two days,&#x2014;neither of my cases coming on; I inquired of all persons what I had to do, or look for: in vain; there was no gleam of daylight in it for me; not so much as a seat to sit down upon: at length I followed the hest of nature, came quietly away, out of a place which I could understand nothing of except that I was very sick and miserable in it; determined to let Nature and Accident work out an issue in it which I <hi rend="italic">could</hi> understand. They have a power it seems of fining me to the extent of &#xa3;100; but are not like to do it. The world I live in is too mad, and I am not patient enough of its madness. My soul is sick of it, <hi rend="italic">im</hi>patient of it, contemptuous of it; desiring or expecting nothing more, in general, than to be well out of it, <hi rend="italic">with my work well done</hi>. This latter is an important point; Thank God, <hi rend="italic">it</hi> grows to seem to me ever more important. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Patientia</hi></foreign> [Patience]!</p>
<p>My <hi rend="italic">Mahomet</hi> is done,&#x2014;not so very ill, I suppose, tho&#x2019; it looks to me as very ill. I must begin the third,&#x2014;<foreign><hi rend="italic">umgenebelt</hi></foreign> [confused] as I am. Be patient with me, my Brother!&#x2014; A certain Augsburg German, and acquaintance of yours, Dr&#x2014;God knows what (Arndlhofer? no!) &#x201C;editor of the Augsburg Gazette,&#x201D; is coming to tea tonight. Vogelsang he says brought you and him together.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >August Joseph Altenh&#xF6;fer (<date when="1804-00-00">1804</date>&#x2013;<date when="1876-00-00">76</date>), journalist, and translator; educated at W&#xfc;rzburg; had become ed. of <hi rend="italic">Augsburger Postzeitung</hi>, and asst. ed. of <hi rend="italic">Allgemeinen Zeitung</hi>, <date when="1833-00-00">1833</date>; later ed. of latter, <date when="1865-00-00">1865</date>&#x2013;<date when="1869-00-00">69</date>.

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I have received three Numbers of the <hi rend="italic">Knickerbocker</hi> Magazine; and, close following on them, a Letter of yours, which seems to have been forwarded from Portsmouth, and being addressed merely &#x201C;London&#x201D; has perhaps had to loiter a day or two. Please to accept many thanks for both these favours. Occasionally for the last year or two I have noticed your <hi rend="italic">Knickerbocker</hi> lying in our Bookshops here; it seems to be becoming our chief representative of America in that department. The little I have had opportunity to read of it pleased me well. I will examine more in detail these three Numbers which have become my own.</p>
<p>Unluckily it is not, for the present, in my power to send you any contribution. I am very busy otherwise: I am quite out of that province for a number of years past;&#x2014;or rather, properly speaking, I never was in it. Surely should an occasion occur I will not forget the honour you do me.</p>

<salute>Dear Forster,</salute>
<p>I know not if you noticed in the Times of last week a vituperative Letter about our Library, signed <hi rend="italic">Orbilius</hi>; which the able Editor volunteered to back in another part of his paper by a vituperative paragraph? Paragraph and Letter were worthy of a Scythian Jackass, rather than of any other animal.&#x2014; On Saturday last, at Milnes&#x2019;s, some were for having the Letter answered, others not. I, after tea, jotted down a <pb id="pg-12-182" n="12:182"/>few words,&#x2014;in the most <hi rend="italic">speechless</hi> manner: a copy of them is here. The <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> Editor, it seems &#x201C;for the sake of avoiding controversy,&#x201D; will not insert them. I demand them back; here they are. Can you do anything with them? Alter them, clip them, carve them, insert them in the <hi rend="italic">Chronicle</hi>,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Forster did or could not arrange for publication in the <hi rend="italic">Morning Chronicle</hi> or elsewhere.</note>&#x2014;burn them if you like: only be secret as Death or a <hi rend="italic">Secretary!</hi> Sterling and my Wife are as yet my only confidants&#x2014; Perhaps the cheapest and best way will be to burn the Paper: but I leave <hi rend="italic">you</hi> to judge of that. If you do print, pray send me the Paper it appears in, and&#x2014;Mum!</p>
<p>You are the prince of reporters; no other man should ever report me if I could so manage it!</p>
<p>The Lecture <hi rend="italic">Mahomet</hi> is all written down here in full, as it might have been, if not as it was. I am now to begin the third.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;The Hero as Poet: Dante; Shakspeare.&#x201D;</note> Pray do not bother yourself with Mahomet or any of the others,&#x2014;at least till you are perfectly at leisure. I sincerely do wish it so. What I <hi rend="italic">said</hi> was of small moment to what I should have said. You never either walk or ride hitherward now, not you!</p>

<salute>My dear Emerson,</salute>
<p>Surely I am a sinful man to neglect so long making any acknowledgement of the benevolent and beneficent Arithmetic you sent me! It is many weeks, perhaps it is months since the worthy citizen, your Host as I understood you in some of your Northern States,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Grinnell, a merchant of Providence, R.I., who dealt in paints and hardware. Emerson wrote about him, <date when="1840-04-21">21 April</date>: &#x201C;as at his house during my visit to Providence [in <date when="1840-03-00">March</date>] I was eagerly catechised by all comers concerning Thomas Carlyle, I thought it behoved me to offer him for his brethren, sisters, &#x26; companions&#x2019; sake, the joy of seeing that wonderful man&#x201D; (Slater 266).</note>&#x2014;stept in here, one mild evening, with his mild honest face and manners; presented me your Bookseller Accounts; talked for half an hour, and then went his way into France. Much has come and gone since then; Letters of yours, beautiful Disciples of yours:&#x2014;I pray you forgive me! I have been lecturing, I have been sick; I have been beaten about in all <pb id="pg-12-183" n="12:183"/>ways. Nay, at bottom, it was only three days ago that I got the <hi rend="italic">Bibliopoliana</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson had sent TC the account of James Munroe &#x26; Co. for the 1st Boston edn. of the <hi rend="italic">Miscellanies:</hi> &#x201C;By sending you this account, I make it entirely an affair between you and them&#x201D; (<date when="1840-04-22">22 April</date>, Slater 268&#x2013;69). As well as this letter of <date when="1840-04-21">21</date>&#x2013;<date when="1840-04-22">22 April</date>, Emerson had also written his introductory letters to TC for Grinnell and to JWC for Jane Tuckerman on <date when="1840-04-22">22 April</date>.</note> back from Fraser; to whom, as you recommended, I, totally inadequate like yourself to understand such things, had straightway handed them for examination. I always put off writing till Fraser should have spoken. I did not urge him, or he would have spoken any day: there is my sin.</p>
<p>Fraser declares the Accounts to be made out in the most beautiful manner; intelligible to any human capacity; correct, so far as he sees, and promising to yield by and by a beautiful return of money. A precious crop, which we must not cut in the blade; mere time will ripen it into yellow nutritive ears yet. So he thinks. The only point on which I heard him make any criticism was on what he called, if I remember, &#x201C;the number of copies <hi rend="italic">delivered</hi>&#x201D;&#x2014;that is to say, delivered by the Printer and Binder as actually available for sale. The edition being of a Thousand, there have only 984 come bodily forth; 16 are &#x201C;waste.&#x201D; Our Printers, it appears, are in the habit of <hi rend="italic">adding</hi> 1 for every 50 beforehand, whereby the <hi rend="italic">waste</hi> is usually made good and more; so that in 1000 there will usually be some dozen called &#x201C;author&#x2019;s copies&#x201D; over and above. Fraser supposes your Printers have a different custom. That is all. The rest is apparently every-way <hi rend="italic">right</hi>; is to be received with faith; with faith, charity and even hope,&#x2014;and packed into the bottom of one&#x2019;s drawer, never to be looked at more except on the outside, as a memorial of one of the best and helpfullest of men! In that capacity it shall lie there.</p>
<p>My Lectures were in <date when="1840-05-00">May</date>, about <hi rend="italic">Great Men</hi>. The misery of it was hardly equal to that of former years, yet still was very hateful. I had got to a certain feeling of superiority over my audience; as if I had something to tell them, and would tell it them. At times I felt as if I could, in the end, learn to speak. The beautiful people listened with boundless tolerance, eager attention. I meant to tell them, among other things, that man was still alive, Nature not dead or like to die; that all true men continued true to this hour,&#x2014;Odin himself true, and the Grand Lama of Thibet himself not wholly a lie. The Lecture on Mahomet (&#x201C;the Hero as Prophet&#x201D;) astonished my worthy friends beyond measure. It seems then this Mahomet was not a quack? Not a bit of him! That he is a better Christian, with his &#x201C;bastard Christianity,&#x201D; than the most of us shovel-hatted? I guess than almost any of you!&#x2014; <pb id="pg-12-184" n="12:184"/>Not so much as Oliver Cromwell (&#x201C;the Hero as King&#x201D;) would I allow to have been a Quack. All quacks I asserted to be and to have been Nothing, <hi rend="italic">chaff</hi> that would not grow: my poor Mahomet was &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">wheat</hi> with barn-sweepings&#x201D;; Nature had tolerantly hidden the barn-sweepings; and as to the <hi rend="italic">wheat</hi>, behold she had said Yes to it; and it was growing!&#x2014; On the whole, I fear I did little but confuse my esteemed audience: I was amazed, after all their reading of me, to be understood so ill;&#x2014;gratified nevertheless to see how the rudest <hi rend="italic">speech</hi> of a man&#x2019;s heart goes into men&#x2019;s hearts, and is the welcomest thing there. Withal I regretted that I had not six months of preaching, whereby to learn to preach, and explain things fully! In the fire of the moment I had all but decided on setting out for America this autumn, and preaching far and wide like a very lion there. Quit your paper formulas, my brethren,&#x2014;equivalent to old wooden idols, <hi rend="italic">un</hi>divine as they: in the name of God, understand that you are alive, and that God is alive! Did the Upholsterer make this Universe? Were you created by the Tailor? I tell you, and conjure you to believe me literally, No, a thousand times No! Thus did I mean to preach, on &#x201C;Heroes, Hero-worship and the Heroic,&#x201D; in America too.
Alas, the fire of determination died away again: all that I did resolve upon was to write these Lectures down, and in <hi rend="italic">some</hi> way promulgate them farther. Two of them accordingly are actually written; the Third to be begun on Monday: it is my chief work here, ever since the <date when="1840-05-00">end of May</date>. Whether I go to preach them a second time <foreign>extempore</foreign> in America rests once more with the Destinies. It is a shame to talk so much about a thing, and have it still hand <foreign><hi rend="italic">in nubibus</hi></foreign> [in the clouds]: <supplied>[but]</supplied> I was, and perhaps am, really nearer doing it than I had ever before been<supplied>[. A]</supplied> month or two now, I suppose, will bring us back to the old nonentity again. Is there, at bottom, in the world or out of it anything one would like so well, with one&#x2019;s whole heart <hi rend="italic">well</hi>, as <hi rend="small-caps">peace</hi>? Is lecturing and noise the way to get at that? Popular Lecturer! Popular writer! If they would undertake in Chancery, or Heaven&#x2019;s Chancery, to make a wise man Mahomet Second and Greater, &#x201C;Mahomet of Saxondom,&#x201D; not reviewed only, but worshipped for twelve centuries by all Bulldom, Yankee-doodle-doodom, Felondom New Zealand, under the Tropics and in part of Flanders,&#x2014;would he not rather answer: Thank you; but in a few years I shall be dead, twelve centuries will have become Eternity, part of Flanders Immensity: we will sit still here if you please, and consider what quieter thing we can do!&#x2014; Enough of this.</p>
<p>Richard Milnes had a Letter from you, one morning lately, when I met him at old Rogers&#x2019;s. He is brisk as ever; his kindly <hi rend="italic">Dilettantism</hi> looking sometimes as if it would grow a sort of Earnest by and by. He <pb id="pg-12-185" n="12:185"/>has a new volume of Poems<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Poetry for the People, and Other Poems</hi> (London, <date when="1840-00-00">1840</date>). Emerson had written to Milnes, <date when="1840-05-30">30 May</date> (see Reid, <hi rend="italic">RMM</hi> 1:241&#x2013;42, and <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400200-TC-RMM-01">TC to RMM, [<date when="1840-02-00">late Feb.</date>&#x2013;<date when="1840-03-00">early March</date>]</ref>).</note> out: I advised him to try Prose; he admitted that Poetry would not be generally read again in these ages,&#x2014;but pleaded, &#x201C;it was so convenient for veiling commonplace!&#x201D; The honest little heart.&#x2014; We did not know what to make of the bright Miss Tuckermann<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In his letter to JWC, Emerson had described Jane Tuckerman: &#x201C;her father&#x2019;s name Gustavus Tuckerman, a merchant in Boston, Mass.; her grandfather&#x2019;s name is John Francis, in Birmingham, England. She sailed from New York the <date when="1840-04-01">1 April</date>. She is in delicate health, &#x26; her friends have hoped that a voyage &#x26; a visit would restore her. She is very well worth seeing &#x26; hearing on her own account, being a lovely person, the dear friend of very good friends, and the sweetest of singers. I know it will gratify her very much to see &#x26; know you &#x26; your great man; &#x26; if she should be in London for any time, you must not fail to do her that grace. Miss Martineau, if she is in London again, will certainly know of her movements; &#x26; I have just written a note of introduction to you to be sent to Miss Tuckerman. If you see her, be sure to make her sing Xarifa to you, one of Lockhart&#x2019;s Spanish ballads I believe. If you do not love that I should send you so many visitors&#x2014;I cannot help it that you are yourself and also Thomas Carlyle&#x2019;s wife.&#x201D; &#x201C;Xarifa&#x201D; is the heroine in &#x201C;The Bridal of Andalla,&#x201D; J. G. Lockhart, trans., <hi rend="italic">Ancient Spanish Ballads</hi> (Edinburgh and London, <date when="1823-00-00">1823</date>) 129&#x2013;31. Emerson wrote to Margaret Fuller, <date when="1840-07-21">21 July</date>, &#x201C;A new letter from Carlyle who would seem to be too old to see Jane Tuckerman clearly.&#x201D; He also wrote to Caroline Sturgis, <date when="1840-08-17">17 Aug.</date>, &#x201C;At Jamaica Plains I saw Jane Tuckerman&#x2019;s letter to you with great content. Mr. Carlyle can not be forgiven&#x201D; (Slater, <hi rend="italic">CEC</hi> 270, 276).</note> here; she fell in love with my Wife,&#x2014;the <hi rend="italic">contrary</hi>, I doubt, with me: my hard realism jarred upon her beautiful rosepink dreams.
Is not all that very morbid; unworthy of the Children of Odin, not to speak of Luther, Knox and the other Brave? I can do nothing with vapours, but wish them <hi rend="italic">condensed</hi>. Kennett had a copy of the English <hi rend="italic">Miscellanies</hi> for you, a good many weeks ago: indeed it was just a day or two <hi rend="italic">before</hi> your advice to try Green henceforth. Has the <hi rend="italic">Meister</hi> ever arrived?<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson mentioned on <date when="1840-04-21">21 April</date> that Little &#x26; Brown now used Longman (rather than Kennett; see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370601-TC-RWE-01"><sic>9:218</sic><corr>TC to RWE, <date when="1837-06-01">1 June 1837</date></corr></ref>). TC may refer to Green here because he assumed that Emerson meant the firm of Longman, Orme, Brown, Green, &#x26; Longmans, 38&#x2013;41 Paternoster Row. No mention has been found of Green in Emerson&#x2019;s letters until <date when="1840-10-30">30 Oct.</date>, when he makes clear that he meant John Green, bookseller and publisher, 121 Newgate St. (Slater, <hi rend="italic">CEC</hi> 283).</note> I received a controversial volume from Mr Ripley:<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Letters on the Latest Form of Infidelity</hi> (Boston, <date when="1840-00-00">1840</date>).</note> pray thank him very kindly.

<salute>Dear Sterling,</salute>
<p>Before parting with this Horse of mine, as I have now nearly resolved to do, it seems to me a question, Whether I ought not first to take a free ride on the quadruped, and survey with my own eyes some section of English land, better than a <foreign><hi rend="italic">sedes exploratoria</hi></foreign> [explorer&#x2019;s seat] on the Coach-roof will [were]<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Inserted in pencil above the line.</note> one never so intent upon it? Many times has such a purpose been in me; and who knows whether I am likely soon or ever to have a better opportunity The thing does go through my head occasionally; and at the Category <hi rend="italic">Whitherward?</hi> You will not wonder that Clifton, and an unreasonable Friend of mine there, should turn up oftener than any other place whatever. Well: what are you doing; what think you of this thing; will you have anything to do with it, or at all relate yourself to it except by an &#x201C;unblameable passivity&#x201D; alone? Speak a word if you have leisure. A word on this will at least be a word: no word at all is the worst way of it from you.&#x2014; But indeed I know not whether I should at bottom invite you to speak, or have myself spoken; the practical chances are so small: this is the real truth! Were you <hi rend="italic">here</hi>, booted and road-ready to go with me, I do indeed believe I should go at once, and be benefitted by going. But you are not here; it is four days of a solitary ride:&#x2014;cannot you <hi rend="italic">meet</hi> me about Stonehenge or some where to encourage my heart! Alas, I get so dyspeptical, melancholic, half-mad in the London summer, all courage to do anything but hold my peace fades away; I dwindle into the pusillanimity of the ninth part of a tailor;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">I Henry IV</hi> 1.3.</note> feel as I had nothing I could do but &#x201C;die in my hole like a poisoned rat.&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Swift, <hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi>, ed. Harold Williams (Oxford, <date when="1963-00-00">1963</date>), 3:383.</note> <foreign><hi rend="italic">Ach Gott!</hi></foreign> However, I take shipping usually; find that there is fresh everlasting sea-water; rivers, mountains, simple peaceful men; that God&#x2019;s Universe is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> wholly an accursed dusty deafening distraction of a Cockneydom;&#x2014;and so get some strength again by and by! I will let you speak or not speak, as you like; that is the best rule.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-12-187" n="12:187"/>Your Letter by your lady Mother, which was dated <date when="1840-06-04">4<hi rend="italic">th</hi> June</date>, did not get here above a week ago; it had lain at the bottom of a travelling-bag, I guess! Fox<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Barclay Fox, who had said good-bye to TC, <date when="1840-06-13">13 June</date>, on his London visit, when he noted: &#x201C;Found the philosopher in a glorious state of disgust &#x26; declamation at what he calls the &#x2018;<foreign>laissez-faire</foreign> principle,&#x2019; adducing the late attempt on the Queen as a proof of the misery &#x26; discontent of the lower classes. An extraordinary specimen of female Yankee coarseness, vulgarity &#x26; shrewdness was there when I arrived. When she cleared out Sterling&#x2019;s father came in &#x2026; a sort of whirlwind of a man. &#x2026; He &#x26; Mrs. Carlyle packed off in his carriage &#x26; the cynic taking his pipe invited me into his back garden where we walked up and down for half an hour, he philosophising on Irving&#x2019;s character, woman&#x2019;s place &#x26; sphere, the injury done by controversialists &#x26; the absence of faith in the world, in very sublime style&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Barclay Fox&#x2019;s Journal</hi>, ed. R. L. Brett [London, <date when="1979-00-00">1979</date>] 201).</note> is a fine open-souled young man; one wishes him right well in his clear wholesome Quakerism,&#x2014;but sees not entirely how he is to get it <hi rend="italic">kept</hi> in these times, and grow as he seems minded to do. They are all good people; we saw them at Mill&#x2019;s. Their admiration for a certain Sterling amounts to the Transcendental.</p>
<p>The Review of you in the <hi rend="italic">Quarterly</hi><note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Sterling&#x2019;s Poems,&#x201D; 66 (<date when="1840-06-00">June 1840</date>): 156&#x2013;62, by H. N. Coleridge.</note> is welcome to all friends; significant then and now; but not in itself of much significance. I found the praise rather underdone,&#x2014;stingy one might have called it; the advice given or implied, not good. Why, man, <hi rend="italic">I</hi> with a safe conscience could have praised your Poems far more; and yet behold I would have repeated with emphasis the old precept to write Prose! You must pick your way, out of conflicting cackle of all kinds; <hi rend="italic">you</hi> for yourself, my Friend; as we all have to do. A brave manly goal, if you err not all-<hi rend="italic">too</hi> unconscionably, is surely possible.</p>
<p>Here is the Horse; the Groom&#x2019;s inexorable Knock. No word more. <foreign>Adieu</foreign>, <foreign>adieu!</foreign></p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I have just been greatly gratified with a short Note from Alick, assuring me that you are well, in your usual way, and down at Powfoot bathing for a week.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Note not found. Powfoot or Queensberry is a hamlet on the Solway, four mi. SW of Annan.</note> I am right thankful to hear that. Isabella, it seems, is with you. Mary is within reach. Alick says, a line sent on to Gill can be conveniently handed forward. I calculate that it might be welcome some day before or after tide-time! So here it is.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-12-188" n="12:188"/>Nothing has happened since I last wrote to Alick. I have been mainly recreating myself; making ready for the <hi rend="italic">Third Lecture</hi>,&#x2014;the Second being now off my hands. I have no overplus of heart to the business; but think I must persevere in it, and shall, a little farther at least. The weather is certainly not oppressive with <hi rend="italic">heat:</hi> Jane has a fire down stairs today, and the sight of it is unwelcome to nobody. I have a thick flannell dressing-gown on up here, a winter garment which I resumed two hours ago. We never see the face of the clear sun, for a fortnight now. Continual grey wind with drops of rain, seldom getting the length of a hearty shower; neither dry weather nor wet. I oftenest go to ride with an old thick coat of Jack&#x2019;s, fit for the depth of winter; it is not burdensome in the blustering wind; it cannot <hi rend="italic">spoil</hi> with wet, being already spoiled, and half a day&#x2019;s rain would not get thro&#x2019; it.&#x2014; By the way, I think of laying aside my Horse; the expense is so heavy in proportion to any good I get of it: but I think of having some country excursion, a day or two of right riding, and visiting some friend or friends, by means of it first.</p>
<p>Letters came from America some time ago, with account of my Bookselling operations there. All went well; there seemed a distinct prospect of some farther <hi rend="italic">monies</hi> coming out of that country for me yet. Nothing stranger has happened in my history, I think, than actual receiving of so much hard cash from beyond the ocean, out of the hands of people I had as good as never seen, and had no concern at all with! There is always some kind of <foreign><hi rend="italic">scraffle</hi></foreign> [struggle] of a life for a poor man in this world: one has to stand by his work, and be confident of that.</p>
<p>A certain Mr Greig from America, of whom you have heard me speak, was here not long ago: he told me among other things about Robert Clow and his sons who are settled in that district, that they were all doing well and hopefully; their farm a good paying profitable farm, their money lent at 7 per cent interest;&#x2014;their health too, he said, was recovered again, they had never had any ill health to speak of, but a kind of &#x201C;seasoning&#x201D;; in fact all was going very handsomely with them, according to Greig. I think our Brother John will be a great fool if he come back out of that country into this. With better information he might have saved himself immense vexation; and now he <hi rend="italic">is</hi> there, and the Earth grows fruit for him, which no man steals away: who can say as much for himself in <hi rend="italic">this</hi> land of distress, controversy and starvation? The fewest can say as much.</p>
<p>Our Library is likely now to take effect here; but it will be slowly: the mass of the people are dull to all such things, and will require immense <hi rend="italic">pricking</hi> into, shouting, and dashing with cold water, before <pb id="pg-12-189" n="12:189"/>they will awaken. But men of influence have now hold of the business; Lords, Bishops and what not, really bearing a hand in it: the thing I imagine <hi rend="italic">will</hi> get into existence, and probably be the beginning of immense benefit, in a quiet way, both to London and all England. It does not occupy much of my time; yet more than I like. They all say, what is a fact, &#x201C;Was it not <hi rend="italic">your</hi> work from the first? And now you grudge a little trouble?&#x201D;</p>
<p>Alick reports very well of Mary, Austin and the Gill; which gives us true satisfaction. Probably you see Mary often at present: I think she must be some three miles off or less. Tell Isabella, I hope poor little Tom and she will get good of the sea-bathing. There is a good chance. I wish I were there too for a plunge!</p>
<p>Write me a line soon with your own hand, dear Mother. Get benefit of your sea-air and water, take care of yourself. Good be ever with you!&#x2014;<closer><salute>Your affectionate</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Jean,</salute>
<p>Your <hi rend="italic">second</hi> Letter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> is here this morn<supplied>[ing. I]</supplied> am, as you compute, very busy; I write no word of letter to anybody that I can help. I wrote to my Mother, <hi rend="italic">since</hi> her Letter to you,&#x2014;which I like right well to read, a nice little Letter! I have now written to Alick. This day I employed Jane to write to you; but she is out, somebody came to give her a drive; and I fear the Post will be over before her return. A poor Edinburgh lad,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> come here to push his fortune, has detained me above half an hour; it is 3 o&#x2019;clock; my task not yet done;&#x2014;you will put up with a very imperfect word from me!</p>
<p>I have wished to say, many times, that you <hi rend="italic">should</hi> take the little girl down to Mary&#x2019;s, for some seabathing: I had, at bottom, nothing else to say. It is very gratifying to me that the poor little thing is better, and running about. But do not overlook the seabathing still, when a blink of good weather comes.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-12-190" n="12:190"/>I am nearly finishing my Third Lecture. It is a work against the grain; yet I persist, out of a kind of superstition against giving anything up half done. We shall see what comes of it.&#x2014; The Library does not cost me much <foreign><hi rend="italic">fash</hi></foreign><hi rend="italic">:</hi> I stand out of the way of that, and leave others to manage it, who lie <hi rend="italic">nearer</hi> it in place, who have more time than I.</p>
<p>My horse still gallops with me; but my <hi rend="italic">liver</hi> is far from well! I think of giving up the horse; it is such an expense: however, I speculate always on having a <hi rend="italic">ride</hi> into the country of England for a few days before parting with the quadruped. I can find no <hi rend="italic">comrade</hi>, or I would set out at once, and try it; but whether, in the feckless humour one gets into as to all &#x201C;amusements,&#x201D; I shall be able to muster resolution for going by myself, is very dubious; yet still possible, or even not without probability.</p>
<p>There has been another Letter from the Doctor since this that I inclose; another longer one; I keep <hi rend="italic">it</hi> for my Mother. Jack is well; rather melancholy of mood in his solitude; seems as uncertain as ever about what he is to turn to, continuing in that situation &#x26;c. He makes heaps of money; but <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> more; and that is not enough.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC wrote in his Journal, <date when="1840-07-11">11 July</date>: &#x201C;Opening this today, I mark that the Lectures were all tolerably delivered &#x2026; that I am even now writing down the third of them, on <hi rend="italic">Dante and Shakspeare</hi>,&#x2014;uncertain to what issue.&#x2014; Think of <hi rend="italic">parting</hi> with my Horse; wish to have a &#x2018;ride in England&#x2019; somewhere, first. Sterling, expected today, will perhaps decide me.&#x2014; Brother John is at Oban with his Derry Patient; not sure of continuing, nor of quitting.&#x201D;</note></p>
<p>Thanks for your news about Mary. I get seldom any full narrative from any but you. I wish you would tell me, if you know, how Alick gets on; and chiefly, what is the real state, progress or decrease, of that very sorrowful habit of his!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >His drinking.</note> Poor fellow: could one once know that he were done with that, one would have no fear for him; but <hi rend="italic">with</hi> that&#x2014;alas, one knows not what is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to be feared! Good at any rate, never came of it, nor will come. There is, as you may fancy, nothing connected with any one of you that afflicts me at all in comparison with this. But do not speak; there is <hi rend="italic">evil</hi>, and no use, in speaking about such cases.</p>
<p>Jamie expects a Letter from me. I never can muster time,&#x2014;time and energy together. My <hi rend="italic">liver</hi> is not my friend. Ah me, I wish I were far out of this braying whirlpool; left to be quiet, to be quiet! By God&#x2019;s blessing that time will come perhaps.&#x2014; I know not whether Scotland is to see me or not this year; but I still keep confidently hoping it.&#x2014; <foreign>Adieu</foreign> dear Sister. Commend me to James, and then to all of them. <closer><salute>Your affectionate</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Having this instant finished my <hi rend="italic">Third Lecture</hi>, I set about answering your two Letters, both of which were, as always, welcome messengers; the last, I think, is the most interesting I have had for a long time. Your feelings there at Oban, &#x201C;looking over to the black mountains of Morven,&#x201D; are very natural: I have often felt for you too, that money, if you could not turn it to some vital purpose, was but a poor remuneration, however much of it there might be! William Cunningham was here the other night, a man overflowing with annual cash; but not knowing what to make of himself or it.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >He was earnestly discussing religious questions about this time with his cousin John Sterling; see <hi rend="italic">Sterling&#x2019;s Letters to Coningham</hi> (privately printed, <date when="1848-00-00">1848</date>; London and Bath, 3d edn., <date when="1872-00-00">1872</date>).</note> I fancied that, apart from ill health, which <hi rend="italic">he</hi> has nothing to do with now, he might have a worse posture of it than mine in &#x201C;stony Edinburgh&#x201D; long ago, when I possessed some seventy pounds sterling, weekly diminishing, and in the whole world of visible expectancy, as friend, helper or outlook, nothing more at all!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ca. <date when="1819-00-00">1819</date>&#x2013;<date when="1820-00-00">20</date>.</note> Men are to be pitied for other things than the want of money.&#x2014; As to you, dear Brother, I never quit hope that a man of so just a heart and good insight will and must get to a solution. I have no doubt of it, at bottom. You will find what does in verity seem your chief good, and then adhere to that, sacrificing whatsoever must be sacrificed to it; <hi rend="italic">not</hi> expecting that you can keep both the merchandise and the price. I should guess too that the <hi rend="italic">silence</hi> you are kept in, even tho&#x2019; rather dreary, were perhaps the best place for progress in this. It is with our own foolish heart that we have to sit in judgement. The faults of others, even when they work as injustices against ourselves, concern <hi rend="italic">us</hi> little. We cannot mend them; what we can mend is elsewhere,&#x2014;and is the only thing it will profit us much to mend! I can give you no counsel; I have counselled and criticised you far too much already first and last. Not with an unfriendly feeling, no; yet with a too impatient one often enough. The heart knoweth its own bitterness;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Prov. 14:10.</note> all hearts of men do. In such a case as this, more than any other, the patient will minister unto himself.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Macbeth</hi> 5.3.</note> I pray heartily for a composed wise issue to you; for few things in the world more heartily. Meanwhile is not, as you too know, the wisest of all rules: <hi rend="italic">Do</hi> the duty which is at <pb id="pg-12-192" n="12:192"/>hand? If you can help that poor fellow man, or even save him from present worse pain, is it not right well to do so? If you stay with him, if you part from him, I shall consider that it is well computed on your part, and be content for your sake.&#x2014; Meanwhile let us not grow melancholy: I too am looking over into black dumb mountains, where is little home or cheer for me!</p>
<p>My health continues very uncertain; my spirits fluctuating between restless flutter of a make-believe satisfaction, and the stillness of avowed misery,&#x2014;which latter I have grown by long practice to think almost the more supportable state! The meaning is, I suppose, that my nervous-system is altogether <hi rend="italic">weak</hi>, excitable; the nervous-system and whatsoever depends on that. I am not equal to much work: indeed properly I accomplish <hi rend="italic">every</hi> sort of work at the expense of a diminution of health. These Lectures are pure trash: I could write one of them straight on, if I had a <hi rend="italic">body</hi> that would stand it. I take ten or twelve days to each; and get into violent extremes of indigestion, this way and that, by means of it. We cannot help it! This <hi rend="italic">Third Lecture</hi>, which was far the worst of all as I delivered it, is considerably the best hitherto as written. The rest of the story too, in some way or other, must not be lost. It is not a new story to <hi rend="italic">me;</hi> but the world seemed greatly astonished at it; the world cannot too soon get acquainted with it!&#x2014; I keep my horse still, will not part with it rashly; yet do get more and more impatient of the great price of it and small benefit of it. My theory is still either to ride off for an excursion, and then sell; or else to sell without riding. I must decide now in not many days.</p>
<p>John Sterling is here. Some &#xa3;1700 of his lay on some American Canal-Enterprise, which has stopt payment, not finally it is hoped;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Almost certainly Sterling had stock in the troubled Morris Canal &#x26; Banking Co., New Jersey, which was closely linked with the Bank of the U.S. Philadelphia. They had issued bonds to obtain funds in London from <date when="1837-00-00">1837</date>. The American economic crisis, <date when="1837-00-00">1837</date>&#x2013;<date when="1845-00-00">45</date>, was contributing to their difficulties. By <date when="1840-08-17">17 Aug.</date> the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> reported that &#x201C;the New York and Philadelphia money-markets were in a very uneasy state. All eyes were fixed on the Bank of the United States, and great anxiety prevailed respecting &#x2026; that establishment &#x2026; and that of the Morris Canal and Banking Company.&#x201D; A committee had been set up to investigate. The Bank of the U.S. was to fail, <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>. Presumably the Morris Co. failed earlier.</note> he is here for that. Italy again is to be his winter-quarters. He professes to work at nothing. We find him very perceptibly fluttered asunder by Wilson eulogies<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Prof. John Wilson in <hi rend="italic">Blackwood&#x2019;s</hi> in <date when="1837-00-00">1837</date>; see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370608-TC-JOST-01"><sic>9:225</sic><corr>TC to JOST, <date when="1837-06-08">8 June 1837</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-09/lt-18371225-TC-JOST-01"><sic>379</sic><corr>TC to JOST, <date when="1837-12-25">25 Dec. 1837</date></corr></ref>; said by TC, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 11:152, to have lavished on him &#x201C;torrents of praise&#x201D; that he bore &#x201C;very gently.&#x201D; For TC&#x2019;s and Sterling&#x2019;s &#x201C;Pantheism&#x201D; and &#x201C;Pottheism,&#x201D; see also <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350604-TC-JOST-01"><sic>8:137</sic><corr>TC to JOST, <date when="1835-06-04">4 June 1835</date></corr></ref>.</note> and other the like small causes; growing daily &#x201C;liker his father&#x201D;! On the whole, already his speech does no good to me. His theories are worth nothing at all to me: to his &#x201C;Pantheism&#x201D; story, I answer <pb id="pg-12-193" n="12:193"/>by a story about &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Pot</hi>theism&#x201D;; and then he argues: really a most <hi rend="italic">wearing</hi> man! Yet kindly too; one cannot help liking him. With stronger nerves I should find him delightful sauce to meat.&#x2014; Yesterday in the Park, I met Calvert<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. John Calvert.</note> who asked for you. A queer man: dangling with bent back, free and easy, on a very small pony, clothes, hat and the rest, a world too wide for him, face brown as a berry, no other such figure visible among the quality for some time! Yet a fine honest look; a Cumberland peasant-gentleman. We rode towards Chelsea together, in watery speech.&#x2014; Did I say before how Jane and I attended one quality <foreign>soiree</foreign> at the Monteagles&#x2019;? Full of Lords, marchionesses and the like; not amusing,&#x2014;and it cost us nine shillings for fly-hire! &#x201C;You ought to have fly too, by the bye,&#x2014;for going out at night!&#x201D; We have refused all other things. On the whole, a lord-<foreign>soiree</foreign> <hi rend="italic">is</hi> best: they are beautifullest and politest there.</p>
<p>Thackeray has brought out a book; kind of picture-book about Paris.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">The Paris Sketch Book, by M. Titmarsh</hi>, 2 vols. (London, <date when="1840-00-00">1840</date>).</note> Mill is going to reprint his Articles, certain of them.<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mill had written to Sterling, <date when="1839-11-04">4 Nov. 1839</date>, about his plan &#x201C;to collect the few things I have printed which are worth preserving &#x26; republish them in a volume,&#x201D; and in <date when="1840-04-00">April</date> had told Robert Barclay Fox that they should &#x201C;during the time you are in London be made into two little volumes&#x201D; (Mineka 13:411, 426). But they were not pbd. until <hi rend="italic">Dissertations and Discussions</hi>, vols. 1 and 2 (London, <date when="1859-00-00">1859</date>).</note> Seemingly there is an Article on <hi rend="italic">me</hi> in the present Edinburgh Review. They tell me it is by Macaulay; and is to cut me all to pieces.<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;The French Revolution,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review</hi> 71 (<date when="1840-07-00">July 1840</date>): 411&#x2013;45. It was critical, and not by Macaulay but Herman Merivale (<date when="1806-00-00">1806</date>&#x2013;<date when="1874-00-00">74</date>), who was a barrister, prof. of political economy, Oxford, <date when="1837-00-00">1837</date>&#x2013;<date when="1842-00-00">42</date>, contributor of sixty-six articles to <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review</hi> on historical, literary, and economic topics, and later permanent under-sec. of state for India.</note> <foreign><hi rend="italic">&#xc0; la bonne heure</hi></foreign> [well and good]. Macaulay cannot well like my way of thinking; I have so small a love for his.</p>
<p>Did you write lately to our Mother? Do not neglect writing. I had a small note from Jean, with one she had received from our Mother; all right enough: my Mother&#x2019;s was dated <date when="1840-06-22">22 june</date>, a truly interesting little thing; Jean&#x2019;s is only a day or two old yet,&#x2014;was chiefly to dun me for a letter. I have no heart to write what can possibly do without being written. I think, however, of sending a few words to our good Mother today. Ah me!&#x2014;I am very sorry withal that I am not there at present; but no weather has yet driven me out: perhaps this, for we have a beginning of heat again these two days, may.</p>
<p>Cavaignac has been in France, and we hear is come back again for a time. The Pepolis have a grand lot of Bologna Pictures, which they <pb id="pg-12-194" n="12:194"/>are still passionately anxious to sell; no sale for them. I keep off Pepolidom, not liking the task of it: Elizabeth,<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Elizabeth Pepoli.</note> whom I have much interest in, comes often here; Jane is up there at present to see what has kept her away almost ten days. The Mazzinis have got a house in Chelsea; as you go towards Fulham by the low <hi rend="italic">narrow</hi> road, near the World&#x2019;s End inn.<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mazzini and Giovanni Ruffini had moved to 4 York Buildings, King&#x2019;s Rd. When Mazzini sent his mother the new address, <date when="1840-07-15">15 July</date>, he mentioned that it was two streets from the Carlyles.</note> I like Mazzini; and wish he could interpret his zeal for <foreign><hi rend="italic">Progr&#xE8;s</hi></foreign> into a wiser and as noble zeal. I have written quite enough. Take a <foreign>swash</foreign> [plunge] in the blue sea-water there. Be quiet, cheerful, and love me always.</p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Third Lecture</hi>, which I have been busy with, this week and more, is just off my hands a few hours ago; I have written a Letter to Jack, who was waiting for that posture of circumstances; and now before the day go, I will write a third <foreign><hi rend="italic">screed</hi></foreign> for you too. You got the little Note I sent on by Mary&#x2019;s, I suppose? I had a Letter from Jean<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found, nor is Mrs. Carlyle&#x2019;s letter to Jean. Mrs. Carlyle wrote to TC, <date when="1840-07-19">19 July</date>.</note> three days ago, wherein she tells me you have now quitted Powfoot, and got home again; how she herself was at Mary&#x2019;s, how Alick and Jamie came driving down just while she was there. She incloses me a nice little Note from you to her; really a nice little Letter, which it does me good to read. It is dated almost four weeks back, indeed; I should like you would write a &#x201C;scrape of a pen&#x201D; for us here at Chelsea now. I sent forward the bit Note to Oban; Jack I knew would like it.</p>
<p>This Third Lecture,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;The Hero as Poet.&#x201D;</note> which was considerably the worst as spoken, is not so bad now when written, &#x201C;with improvements&#x201D;; on paper it will do as well as any of the rest, I hope. There are none of them worth much to my mind. If I were a bit <hi rend="italic">tougher in the stomach</hi>, I could soon write them all down. But alas, alas!&#x2014; Really it depends on the stomach, on the nerves, much more than anything else. Whether I shall begin the next immediately or what I shall do, is very uncertain at this <pb id="pg-12-195" n="12:195"/>moment. We have had no weather that <supplied>[I]</supplied> could dislike hitherto; indeed it was too much as if made expressly for me,&#x2014;very windy, grey, decidedly damp, cold and bad for everything <hi rend="italic">but</hi> me. These two days there has been promise of heat: today is bright; warmer than I like it,&#x2014;if it were not that I think of the corn. I suppose you in Annandale, who I hope have got the like change, are still gladder of it than we: the crops on cold land must be in a very <foreign><hi rend="italic">blate</hi></foreign> [backward] condition, I doubt. The people here had a very troublesome hayharvest; tho&#x2019; there hardly ever was a shower half an hour long, yet it was always spitting, and plaguing them. Their haystacks are huge things like a good big <hi rend="italic">Meetinghouse;</hi> the<supplied>[y]</supplied> mount regular scaffolds to fork from: they had all, this year a huge sail-cloth (which is moved up and down by pullies, and hangs on large <hi rend="italic">masts</hi> at each end) to screen the top of them while they were in progress. The wheat looks well, as far as I see, tho&#x2019; it will be latish.</p>
<p>Poor Mrs Gavin Irving, once of Annan, is gone! They sent me an announcement the other day from Glasgow to that effect. She had been tried with many sufferings, in her old days, poor woman; that is the heaviest time for suffering. I notice also by the Newspaper that Senhouse Nelson is dead. No continuance for us here!&#x2014; The Newspaper also taught me that you had got a Minister settled at Ecclefechan;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mary Irving, age 76 (see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350110-TC-MAC-01"><sic>8:3</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1835-01-10">10 Jan. 1835</date></corr></ref>), mother of Edward Irving, had d. <date when="1840-07-09">9 July</date> in Glasgow at her daughter&#x2019;s Janet Dickson&#x2019;s (see <ref target="volume-03/lt-18240625-TC-AC-01"><sic>3:94</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1824-06-25">25 June 1824</date></corr></ref>).

William Tait, had been ordained, <date when="1840-06-23">23 June</date> (<hi rend="italic">Dumfries Herald</hi>, <date when="1840-06-25">25 June</date>).</note> this I think will be a real comfort to you among others. It has been in a very doleful state, all that business of late years.</p>
<p>I still have my horse; I have not got any &#x201C;ride&#x201D; yet. I do believe it would do me good; and perhaps I <hi rend="italic">ought</hi>, as a duty, to bundle and go. At all events I will either go in a day or two now, or give up talk about it,&#x2014;and send my horse off <hi rend="italic">without</hi> it. I wish Annandale were but three times as near!&#x2014; Am I not coming to Annandale, however, in one way or other? That is the question, you ask, my dear Mother! Alas, I wish I were there; but it is an ugly business going. I still count that I shall and will go. A few weeks of weather like this would <hi rend="italic">start</hi> me thither or somewhither! Thomas Erskine asks us to go to his place near Dundee:<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Linlathen, a large mansion on the banks of the Dighty, Forfarshire, nr. Monifieth. For a photograph, see J. Malcolm, <hi rend="italic">The Parish of Monifieth</hi> (Edinburgh and London, <date when="1910-00-00">1910</date>) 300. It is now largely demolished.</note> it is not likely to take effect, tho&#x2019; he is an extremely good man. We shall see. Some way or other I must get to my Mother&#x2019;s hearth again if I can!</p>
<p>Jack has written to me twice since you heard last from this. He had <pb id="pg-12-196" n="12:196"/>got back to Oban; had received his trowsers and the <hi rend="italic">Miscellanies;</hi> had two good rooms close by the sea, and looked out, over the blue waves, on the black Hills of Morven, Ossian&#x2019;s old country.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Morven is in northwest Argyllshire and occupies the large part of a triangular peninsula, bounded by Loch Sunart, the Sound of Mull, and Loch Linnhe; also a legendary Scottish kingdom. John&#x2019;s letters not found.</note> He had no company at all, except that his Patient and he read together, walked together; but he said he felt less solitary than in Italy. I liked his last Letter very well, and had some thought of sending it to you; but it is too heavy for this cover, and there are no news but these.</p>
<p>A certain Paisley Writer called on me the other day, with unexpected news that at a Public Meeting of Paisley people I had been named as one of a deputation to wait upon Lord John Russel about emigration!<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On <date when="1840-07-10">10 July</date>. TC noted in his Journal, <date when="1840-07-11">11 July</date>: &#x201C;Paisley Deputation (about carrying weavers to New Zealand and, I to go with the rest to Lord J. Russel: hooh! hooh!) first intimated yesterday; by one Simpson, an honest-looking, longwinded Paisley writer.

Simpson of Simpson &#x26; Martin, writers, 1 Smithhills, and Bishopton House, Paisley.</note> Much obliged for the honour, gentlemen: but we shall hardly <hi rend="italic">go</hi>, I think. They are terribly ill off the poor people in Paisley I understand.&#x2014; Great quantities of things and persons come to me; one has to <hi rend="italic">stave them all off</hi>, or almost all. A weak body like me might be torn in pieces otherwise.</p>
<p>Jane agrees as usual with the heat. Her foolish beau cousin James Bailey<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For the most complete account of Lt. Baillie, see K. J.

Jane too is quite weary of him after their one interview, and seems to determine on no second. Mrs Welsh writes us in quite a wrath at him, as a &#x201C;disgrace to the clan.&#x201D; He has still cash enough, fine clothes enough; but really <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> more: a <hi rend="italic">silly fellow</hi>, as I said.</p>
<p>Make my compliments to Sandy&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Jamie</hi>, and to Jamie&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Tom;</hi> these are the youngest, then go off at the eldest. Good be with you all, young and old. Blessings on you always, dear Mother. I will write again soon.</p>
<p>We dine at 2 o&#x2019;clock these two days; and then I go and ride, as I am now about to do. We will see how that answers. <foreign>Adieu</foreign> dear Mother</p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Your Paper seems to me of a genuine spirit, and to have in it a right insight into the heart of <supplied>[the]</supplied> matter. I agree altogether with what you say; and should with pleasure see it printed and circulated, the more widely the better. It seems to me, at bottom, a thing which must some day or other be circulated; that thing, or some other thing and innumerable other things like it!</p>
<p>Yet I question whether Newspaper Editors will not find it too <hi rend="italic">far ahead</hi>. They are judges of that. You must try; and prosper if you can,&#x2014;and change your shape, and try, and shift, till you do prosper, for the spirit of the thing is true! Perhaps the <hi rend="italic">Spectator</hi> would be your best London vehicle? The Editor is understood to be a rational, candid, decisive man.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Stephen Rintoul (<date when="1787-00-00">1787</date>&#x2013;<date when="1858-00-00">1858</date>), founder and ed. of the <hi rend="italic">Spectator</hi> from <date when="1828-00-00">1828</date>. The article was almost certainly Redwood&#x2019;s &#x201C;Paper about Chartism,&#x201D; apparently sent to TC some time after <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400109-TC-CR-01">TC to CR, <date when="1840-01-09">9 Jan.</date></ref>, when TC had not seen it.</note></p>
<p>But after all, I see it will do you no ill should all Editors once more <hi rend="italic">refuse!</hi> An idea in a man, like fire in certain circumstances, is not to be trampled out by refusals. You will have observed too that the longer a bit of ore has been kept in the smelt-furnace, the better metal does it make. Do not regret if they refuse you;&#x2014;perhaps rejoice rather.</p>
<p>As I know not whether I shall be here at the end of the week, it seems shorter and safer to return your Paper to Cowbridge straightway.</p>

<salute>Dear Miss Jewsbury,</salute>
<p>It gives me true pleasure, and is indeed what I expected, that you find such profit and significance in Goethe.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC was replying to Jewsbury&#x2019;s letter, <date when="1840-06-30">30 June</date>, saying that she had received <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister&#x2019;s Travels</hi>, that &#x201C;as a guide for <hi rend="italic">practice</hi> it is to me of more use than the Apprenticeship,&#x201D; and that &#x201C;coming from you it seems to speak with your voice.&#x201D;</note> Sincere natures recognise <pb id="pg-12-199" n="12:199"/>the voice of a sincere nature, be the dialect never so different. I have long felt, as you do, that there are no modern words like these of this man. It <hi rend="italic">is</hi> the kind of Speech which men were wont to call <hi rend="italic">inspired</hi>, in times when the worth of true Speech was better understood than now. You will by and by, as I compute, find great benefit, instruction, solace, furtherance in many ways, as you get more intimately into that sphere of German Thought, and make yourself at home there.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, think not by any means that I forbid your studies in Physiology!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >About the study of physiology she wrote regretting TC&#x2019;s belief that it was &#x201C;useless,&#x201D; because she had been reading a great deal &#x201C;in that line&#x201D; for the past year or two, &#x201C;hoping to have my mind set at rest, tho&#x2019; that has not been the case.&#x201D;</note> You are to prosecute these till you yourself feel that you have done with them. There is no branch of human inquiry, however unwisely handled, but has valuable elements of knowledge scattered in it. I myself spent many bewildered days in reading about those matters; neither can I say, tho&#x2019; the result threatened to prove mere darkness of the Everlasting Black, that I did not at last derive a certain profit from them. But in regard to reading, really old Johnson&#x2019;s rule, one of the simplest, is among the best: That we are to read what we really have a desire for reading! Take the book you have a true wish for.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Boswell, <hi rend="italic">Life of Johnson</hi> 303&#x2013;4.</note> You are prepared for that book then; you will get good of it then. Our authentic <hi rend="italic">appetite</hi>, not our false superficial one which often differs widely from that, is well worth attending to, here as always.</p>
<p>You take up, with your usual clearness, what Goethe means by <hi rend="italic">Renunciation</hi>; we must not be too strict in searching out the details.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >She had written, &#x201C;What do you consider is meant to be shewn by the Rules of the &#x2018;Renunciants&#x2019;? is it, that sometimes it is wise voluntarily to deny ourselves legitimate enjoyments that so doing we may more easily endure the evils laid on us by <hi rend="italic">Destiny?</hi> or is it rather that in this life we are not to &#x2018;dwell at ease,&#x2019; but be always ready to be <hi rend="italic">up &#x26; doing?</hi>&#x201D;</note> Many of these, I have no doubt, depend on the mere <hi rend="italic">form</hi> of his Book; that it is a Prose Poem, composed under such and such conditions. We are to understand, in general, that he finds withal an <hi rend="italic">infinite rigour</hi> under the soft surface of Life; that he looks on this as the <hi rend="italic">basis</hi> of Life,&#x2014;as the hard everlasting rocks are of the beautiful and fruitful green of the Earth. It was to me, I can still recollect, like a light-beam, that saying of his, &#x201C;that with Renunciation, Life properly <hi rend="italic">begins</hi>.&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 24:334, and Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi> 191.</note> The desire of happiness, implanted in all creatures, is but <hi rend="italic">animal</hi>, then? I said: <hi rend="italic">Desire</hi> must be perfected into Will, which is <hi rend="italic">human</hi>, rational? One then properly <hi rend="italic">begins</hi> to live!&#x2014; Say to all manner of Happiness, &#x201C;I can do without thee!&#x201D;&#x2014;a man is thereby made a kind of god. I believe you will see more and more into this. The watery &#x201C;sensibility&#x201D; <pb id="pg-12-200" n="12:200"/>&#x26;c &#x26;c of these times is another of its waterinesses, with which a healthy soul is required to have nothing to do, or next to nothing.</p>
<p>But when is the <hi rend="italic">necessity</hi> of Duty? Why should we and must we follow thro&#x2019; mere pain and suffering, if perhaps it be still towards mere pain? This thought, a kind of beginning of madness, a staggering as if over the Abyss, is also not unknown to me. My dear friend, it is an unanswerable question.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >She had written that she questioned, &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Why</hi> must we thus labour day after day to perfect ourselves? to what <hi rend="italic">purpose</hi> are we struggling?&#x201D;</note> No other answer, I think, is possible except even this, That the question itself is a beginning of madness! How <hi rend="italic">can</hi> such a question be &#x201C;answered&#x201D;; by what <hi rend="italic">plainer</hi> thing shall we make Moral Necessity plain,&#x2014;itself the very central element of our being, to be taken as the <hi rend="italic">first axiom</hi> in all other speculation? Why must the harp be musical? Why, because it is a harp! It is there for that purpose. So with a man and morality. It is a <hi rend="italic">disease</hi>, literally a disease, that he should ask himself such a question. Alas, there are many, too many inducements, in times of ruin, scepticism insincerity and semi-delirium or whole-delirium, to make any of us ask it! We have Benthams, Paleys,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Paley (<date when="1743-00-00">1743</date>&#x2013;<date when="1805-00-00">1805</date>), author of <hi rend="italic">Principles of Moral and Political Philosophy</hi> (London, <date when="1785-00-00">1785</date>), and other works; see <ref target="volume-01/lt-18170705-TC-RM-01"><sic>1:104</sic><corr>TC to RM, <date when="1817-07-05">5 July 1817</date></corr></ref>.</note> Moral <hi rend="italic">Philosophies</hi>, Immoral: all of which, necessary products of these latter centuries, and not without worth for their purpose,&#x2014;seem to me essentially based on wind, <hi rend="italic">logic</hi> and nonentity; and, tho it looks most arrogant to say it, have to me grown altogether <hi rend="italic">in</hi>credible, and are not there for me at all! It is like a poor man who fancies himself all made of glass, and that he would break if you struck him,&#x2014;this singular moral hypochondria of a Bentham, and his &#x201C;motives,&#x201D; his &#x201C;pains and pleasures&#x201D; &#x26;c &#x26;c. Brother, thou art not made of glass; thou wilt not break!&#x2014; But no <hi rend="italic">reasoning</hi> will cure him. He is fit for the hospital, for our prayers and his own. Consider it, my dear friend, as a piece of the <hi rend="small-caps">Atheism</hi> of our age, that you are put upon such questions. You will grow one day to see them lie beneath you,&#x2014;deep, far down as death and chaos; to which region, and not to our upper world of the sun, they do indeed properly belong. I wish I could say something better to you; but the best is, Go on <hi rend="italic">do</hi>ing what is right: all kinds of solution, enlargement and healing lie in that.</p>
<p>Neither can I tell you much more about <hi rend="small-caps">Silence</hi>.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >She had questioned his teaching on Silence, as possibly encouraging those who were not &#x201C;practised thinkers&#x201D; to be &#x201C;satisfied with vague indistinct notions.&#x201D;</note> My friends, to whom I speak, all or nearly all cavil about this that I call &#x201C;Silence,&#x201D; &#x201C;unconsciousness,&#x201D; and the like: I answer, Really I have in my hopelessness no other <hi rend="italic">word:</hi> I do mean by it a great world of things; which are unknown unheeded to this generation;&#x2014;which you probably do <pb id="pg-12-201" n="12:201"/>not know, and, I can assure you, <hi rend="italic">ought</hi> to know!&#x2014; &#x201C;Precision of idea,&#x201D; is a thing I insist upon, as of primary moment; to go upon the vague, the hypothetic or uncertain, in any sense, will never do, according to me. <hi rend="small-caps">Silence</hi> has nothing to say against all this; Silence <hi rend="small-caps">begins</hi> when all this has got itself said and done. But I mean to indicate withal that when our words are all over, the secret of the thing is not yet over; nay properly the secret may be said to be beginning just then! I would have us to consider that after all our scheming, calculating, working and exhibiting, we are a kind of growing <hi rend="italic">trees;</hi> that our <hi rend="italic">roots</hi> are in the deep bosom of the Infinite, and all that we <hi rend="italic">shew</hi> above ground, to others or even to ourselves, is poor and small in comparison. For all speculation, still more for all conduct I find this of Silence (what I mean thereby) a most significant fact. Or rather I find it becomes the basis of my whole conception of the world, so far as I attempt to form one. But what can I <hi rend="italic">say</hi> of it here, that will not too probably add confusion to the already obscure! Do you know an Essay of mine, called <hi rend="italic">Characteristics</hi>, in the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review</hi> of some ten years ago, and published since in that book of <hi rend="italic">Miscellanies?</hi><note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Characteristics,&#x201D; pbd. <date when="1831-00-00">1831</date>; see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 28:1&#x2013;13.</note> It is very cramp reading; yet I will bid <hi rend="italic">you</hi> read it till you have understood it, a thing you are equal to: the germ of all I have since concluded upon these matters lies there. I think you may make it all out if you have curiosity enough. I know not but it might be profitable.</p>
<p>Your Letters, dear Sister, are always welcome; doubly so if I can in any thing be of help to you. Continue your noble solitary pilgrimage, with assured step and heart.</p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Having to leave Town, probably tomorrow, for a journey of a week, I cannot promise myself the honour of attending with you at the Colonial Office on Tuesday. A copy of the Memorial from Paisley has been forwarded to me since you were here. I beg you will express, to the Gentlemen who named me as one of their Deputies on this occasion, my sincere acknowledgements for such a mark of their respect.</p>
<p>Whether my presence with you on Tuesday could have done any good, there or elsewhere, is still doubtful: but that your object is good, and that no furtherance of mine whensoever possible should be withheld from it, is very clear. The request you have to make seems one of the reasonablest, justest; deeply grounded on the natural truth of things. What juster request could be made by Persons Governed, to the Person Governing them, than this same: &#x201C;We cannot get existed here; we are perishing, soul and body, and causing others to perish here: for us the result of all British legislating, instituting, governing, and Parliamentary debating, is this, that, by the utmost labour of our bodies and contrivance of our minds, we cannot, in the over-crowded British land, get food to eat: we petition <hi rend="italic">to be let out of it</hi>, into another land where by working we may live!&#x201D; The funds of a Nation cannot, one would say, be expended on any more legitimate object.</p>
<p>What a Minister of State, hampered by considerations very partially known to the like of me, may decide upon as to this request, I will not predict: but it requires no gift of prophecy to understand that this, and very many more of the like tendency must one day be acceded to, or even be anticipated and invited, if worse is not to befal. Governments, one may venture to guess, will actually, for one thing, have to set on foot an organised continuous <hi rend="italic">System of Emigration</hi>, as they have an organised continuous System of Soldiering, and various other System: they may find, in such an Europe as ours, in such an England as ours, that <hi rend="italic">this</hi> and not Soldiering has more and more become the business of Governments.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The members of the deputation would have known of TC&#x2019;s strong interest in emigration from <hi rend="italic">Chartism</hi>.</note> And I think he will be a right noble Minister of State, and have deserved well of his country, who <pb id="pg-12-203" n="12:203"/>first, in a wise way, in spite of impediments, contrives to plant the germ of such an Emigration System&#x2014;the sooner the better!</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Impossible</hi> cannot be considered the final answer here. Much is possible, much will have to be possible. In My Lord Castlereagh&#x2019;s time, I can recollect, it was found possible to raise 120 Millions a-year to put the French to death:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Stewart (<date when="1769-00-00">1769</date>&#x2013;<date when="1822-00-00">1822</date>), Viscount Castlereagh; 2d Marquess of Londonderry, <date when="1821-00-00">1821</date>. Foreign sec., <date when="1812-00-00">1812</date>&#x2013;<date when="1822-00-00">22</date>; at his instance in <date when="1813-00-00">1813</date> the British government raised its subsidies to foreign powers to &#xa3;10,000,000 to maintain the coalition of northern powers against Napoleon.</note> cannot the tenth, the hundredth, the thousandth part of that be raised to keep the English alive?</p>

<salute>My dear Alick,</salute>
<p>Considering the cheapness of Postage now, I think it seems a pity not to write, even a word were it no more, when one can snatch a moment! This morning I received the inclosed Letter from Oban; reporting all well there. I will send it forward to you: on the Sabbath morning, it may be a cheerful little message for our dear Mother when she comes over to the Sermon: or failing her, you may walk along to Scotsbrig with it yourself. I received my Mother&#x2019;s Letter; I am right glad to hear she is well; glad that she has a new &#x201C;peat-shed put up in the garden&#x201D;; that all is going on in some sort of tolerable way.&#x2014; I do not write half as often to you as I could wish,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; I write very often too! I am very busy; I think daily of you, daily wish all good to all of you.</p>
<p>I am now busy at my <hi rend="italic">Fourth Lecture;</hi> and shall have it done in about a week. By and by, I suppose, I shall get all the six put down and most probably have them printed, for the whole world&#x2019;s benefit, that of Annandale not forgotten! This Fourth is on <hi rend="italic">Luther</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Knox</hi>.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;The Hero as Priest. Luther; Reformation: Knox; Puritanism.&#x201D;</note></p>
<p>My &#x201C;rural ride,&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC has in mind William Cobbett&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Rural Rides</hi> (<date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>).</note> prior to putting away my horse, is never taken yet. A certain French friend, named Cavaignac, a man whom I like well, had agreed to go with me, and we were actually to have set out &#x201C;on <pb id="pg-12-204" n="12:204"/>Thursday&#x201D; (that is, this day) for a week&#x2019;s riding over Cambridgeshire and that neighbourhood,&#x2014;where Oliver Cromwell first came into being and action; which scene I wanted and still want to see with my eyes: it was all settled so; but some delay occurred on Cavaignac&#x2019;s side, wherefore <hi rend="italic">I</hi> struck into work again; and now when Cavaignac is ready, I refuse to move till this Fourth Lecture be got done. I am like an old spavined horse,&#x2014;&#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Gude guide us to, Sandy, rather stiff t&#x2019; ye reise</hi> [get up in the morning]!&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Quoted again in <ref target="volume-28/lt-18530408-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1853-04-08">8 April 1853</date></ref> (Marrs 698), where someone has written on the back of the letter, &#x201C;The man who had a horse to sell, and when going to it, in its stable, it struggled vainly to get up, he exclaimed &#x2018;Gud guide us, etc.&#x2019;&#x201D;</note>&#x2014;and once set in motion, I must keep moving. What will become of C&#x2019;s ride and mine I know not now. But I still mean to have a ride. I am also still of mind to part with my horse, as too expensive for any good it does me. Yet it does do me some good; I feel distinctly better at times (at present, for instance):&#x2014;then I fall back into indigestion again, into pain and chagrin: I am a poor fluctuating soul!</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">review</hi> by Macaulay which Jack speaks about has come out; and I read it with considerable satisfaction. The man does not like me; yet is forced to praise me. I too most heartily <hi rend="italic">dis</hi>like his whole way of thought, or even I might say detest it: no wonder he dislike <hi rend="italic">me</hi>. But the man is clever; and one of Her Majesty&#x2019;s Minister&#x2019;s [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] at present. His notion of Freedom and Radicalism seems to be that starvation and misery among the poorer classes is perpetual and eternal; that all good Government consists in uniting of the monied classes to keep down that one miserable class, and make the pigs <hi rend="italic">die without squealing</hi>. No wonder he and I are mutually abhorrent.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Macaulay was sec. of war, <date when="1839-00-00">1839</date>&#x2013;<date when="1841-00-00">41</date>, and did not write the review in the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review;</hi> see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400715-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1840-07-15">15 July</date></ref>. It criticized his style and argued against &#x201C;the theory implied throughout&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">The French Revolution</hi> &#x201C;which makes hunger the one great mover of revolution&#x201D; (71 [<date when="1840-07-00">July 1840</date>]:416). TC may also have had in mind Burke&#x2019;s image of the &#x201C;swinish multitude&#x201D; in his <hi rend="italic">Reflections on the Revolution in France</hi> (London, <date when="1790-00-00">1790</date>).</note>&#x2014; But the <hi rend="italic">review</hi> gratifies Fraser highly, and will quicken the Book&#x2019;s sale, he thinks. Be it so.</p>
<p>Here is a caller waiting for me again, down stairs! I must off, dear Brother. Commend me to one and all.&#x2014; I never in the least give up my notion of Annandale this year yet: but I fancy the summer is pleasanter really where I am. We have cool grey weather; you I suppose very frequent rain. We shall see what comes of it when <hi rend="italic">this</hi> Lecture is done.&#x2014; I wish you would write me a long detail of yourself, your shop, interests and business. Welcome to poor &#x201C;little Jamie!&#x201D;&#x2014; <closer><salute>Your affectionate</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>After some searching, I have found your Agreement with Hamilton:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly the interest on the Illinois bonds bought through Hamilton in <date when="1838-00-00">1838</date>; see <ref target="volume-10/lt-18381226-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1838-12-26">26 Dec. 1838</date></ref>.</note> there is nothing whatever specified in it about the <hi rend="italic">terms</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">times</hi> I mean, for paying the interest. Six per cent, for &#xa3;1700 till the <date when="1840-02-06">6<hi rend="italic">th</hi> of Feb<hi rend="italic">y</hi></date>; then five percent onwards after,&#x2014;for one year at least, and you to give six months warning: this is the whole stipulation. You will have to write to W. Hamilton, I suppose, and inquire what the <hi rend="italic">usual</hi> times of paying interest in such a case are. If I can do anything in it, direct me what.</p>
<p>Your Letter<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> has come, yesterday, or the day before. I am glad you are at rest there by the sea-shore, and that if nothing is yet settled, nothing is <hi rend="italic">mis</hi>settled, and all is getting readier for settlement. You will see onto it by and by, see thro&#x2019; it; and then choose what course will be best for you. It is not a cheerful service: but no labour whereby one earns money is apt to be that. Write to me as often as you can.</p>
<p>I am at my <hi rend="italic">Fourth Lecture</hi>, not riding thro&#x2019; England! Yet the latter had very nearly happened. All was ready for it, at least for a few days of riding, when Cavaignac returned from France, and I told him of the scheme. He instantly agreed to accompany me if I would wait two days longer than the day proposed,&#x2014;if I would wait &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">till Thursday</hi>.&#x201D; I agreed; went idle in the interim. But now the prospect of a gratuitous horse turns up for Cavaignac (I learn on the Tuesday) if I would wait a <hi rend="italic">little longer still</hi>, how long not yet known! I <hi rend="italic">wait;</hi> but return home, and instantly begin my Lecture. Cavaignac writes next day that he will be ready, after all, <hi rend="italic">on friday</hi>. I answer that nothing can take me off till I have done with this Lecture now that I am in it! So here the matter stands. We were to have gone by Cambridge to Oliver Cromwell&#x2019;s birth-town Huntingdon; then round by Chalgravefield [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>]&#x2014;where Hampden fell, &#x26;c &#x26;c. Whether <hi rend="italic">we</hi> shall go at all now is doubtful. I am still bent for a little piece of equitation; I may not so soon have a horse again: I have always wanted to <hi rend="italic">see</hi> a bit of England. In a week I shall have done with this Lecture, and be at scheming again.&#x2014; I never give up the notion of a run to Annandale still; but all along I have fancied myself as well off here, or better, in grey cool weather, at worst damp, while in Scotland I suppose they <pb id="pg-12-206" n="12:206"/>have it often rainy. I shall regret greatly if I do not see my Mother this autumn. It is a kind of <hi rend="italic">duty</hi> drawing me thitherward, as none does elsewhither. If I had heart enough, I would mount at once by myself, and ride all the way: but, alas, the heart of a bilious nervous mortal is of small compass for mere enterprises of enjoyment! I must have my <hi rend="italic">Luther and Knox</hi> done first, at any rate.</p>
<p>My pen goes briskly, some days; at other times it is very <hi rend="italic">dour</hi> indeed. It is the evening, near sunset, now when I write: this morning I awoke at four o&#x2019;clock. Generally, however, I am <hi rend="italic">better</hi> than you used to see me. One advantage of the horse is that it takes me at any rate <hi rend="italic">into the country</hi> almost every day. I sometimes do not go into the Town at all for almost a week. I can of course call on nobody; it is a lonely life; but I find solitude far fruitfullest for me. Even today I do not feel nearly so wretched as I used often to do here in summer. The weather indeed has suited me better,&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">too</hi> well, for the world&#x2019;s sake: besides I have an employment this year, tho&#x2019; a poor one. I hope to write another <hi rend="italic">Book</hi> by and by!</p>
<p>Macaulay&#x2019;s Article is not so bad; on the whole rather interesting to me, and flattering rather than otherwise. &#x201C;See,&#x201D; I said to Jane, &#x201C;we have produced an effect even on Whiggery; awakened an appetite under the ribs of Death!&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;Awakened an <hi rend="italic">indigestion!</hi>&#x201D; she answered. That really is it. Fraser delights greatly in the review; calculates that it will quicken him perceptibly! It seems there is a <hi rend="italic">Quarterly</hi> onslaught coming too: so James has heard in all diplomatic privacy.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Fraser. William Sewell reviewed the <hi rend="italic">Miscellanies, The French Revolution, Sartor</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Chartism</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Quarterly Review</hi> 66 (<date when="1840-09-00">Sept. 1840</date>):446&#x2013;503, beginning, &#x201C;These remarkable volumes contain many grave errors.&#x201D;</note> All glory <hi rend="italic">then</hi> is exhausted; we can as our Mother used to say, &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">dicht</hi></foreign> [clean] our <foreign><hi rend="italic">neb</hi></foreign> [bills], and <foreign>flee</foreign> [fly] up,&#x201D;&#x2014;to roost for the night.</p>
<p>One thing struck me much in this Macaulay, his theory of <hi rend="italic">liberal</hi> government. He considers Reform to mean a judicious combining of those that have any money to keep down those that have none. &#x201C;Hunger&#x201D; among the great mass is <hi rend="italic">irremediable</hi>, he says. That the pigs be taught to <hi rend="italic">die without squealing:</hi> there is the sole improvement possible according to him. Did Whiggery ever express itself in a more damnable manner. He and I get our controversy rendered altogether precise in this way. His theory of Dumouriez&#x2019; Campaign is also altogether amazing from a man of any judgement: <hi rend="italic">whiggish</hi> to the backbone. And lastly Robespierre&#x2019;s <foreign><hi rend="italic">Etre Supr&#xEA;me</hi></foreign> being a <hi rend="italic">Religion;</hi> of the same sort as that of Cromwell! O Babington what is <hi rend="italic">a Cant</hi> then? Didst thou ever see a Cant in this world?<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Merivale had written &#x201C;that Robespierre was sincere in his way it is impossible to doubt; the cant of the school to which he belonged is odious to the educated mind; but so is that of Cromwell. &#x2026; Robespierre&#x2019;s was a religion&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review</hi> 71:428). For his view of Dumouriez&#x2019;s campaign&#x2014;that its success was owing to secret negotiation, not bravery&#x2014;see 71:437&#x2013;40.</note> No: a man in jaundice never sees the colour <hi rend="italic">yellow</hi>.&#x2014; At <pb id="pg-12-207" n="12:207"/>bottom this Macaulay is but a poor creature, with his Dictionary literature and erudition, his saloon arrogance; he has no vision in him: he will neither see nor do any great thing, but be a poor Holland-House Unbeliever, with spectacles instead of eyes, to the end of him, I think!</p>
<p>&#x2014;And now we will wait for the <hi rend="italic">Quarterly</hi> onslaught; and hope for a decided increase of sale. That is the only benefit of being reviewed.</p>
<p>Did you see in the Newspaper that poor Webbe<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Egerton Webbe (<date when="1810-00-00">1810</date>&#x2013;<date when="1840-00-00">40</date>), minor occasional writer on literary and musical topics, who had assisted the cause of the London Library; see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400428-TC-WDC-01">TC to WDC, <date when="1840-04-28">28 April</date></ref>.

<p>No word out of Annandale. I wrote yesternight to Alick; I had the Newspaper as usual, which I have forwarded to you today.</p>

<p>The American young lady<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jane Tuckerman.</note> you speak of (it can be no other) has been here: &#x201C;a little diseased rosebud,&#x201D; of whom we could make almost nothing.

<p>Light is quite gone, my dear Jack: I too must go. You are looking over the everlasting Sea, I suppose; I over red tiles and chimney pots. My stupidity is inexcusable,&#x2014;if I had not awakened at four&#x2014;</p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>If you are from home, or are otherwise engaged at home, pray consider this Missive as an arrow shot into the vague, which <hi rend="italic">has missed;</hi> and do not take any trouble whatever with it.</p>
<p>These several weeks, I have been painfully meditating an enterprise of the most momentous description,&#x2014;a rural ride <hi rend="italic">into England</hi>, before parting with a Horse I have had for some time! A <foreign><hi rend="italic">Keblah</hi></foreign>,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The point to which Moslems kneel when praying.</note> as the Moslem name it, has been greatly wanting: towards which of the thirty-two azimuth-points was it, of all others, the most advantageous to ride? I decide at last for the sea-coast, thro&#x2019; Surrey. I set out tomorrow; shall stay at Leatherhead till Monday or perhaps Tuesday. And now a certain kind message Sterling once delivered me comes to mind; and I say to myself, If the good Mr Hare is at home, why should I not go and see Herstmonceux, William Bastard&#x2019;s battleground, the ocean-stream, a good Library, a fruitful country, and a gifted friendly man?<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William the Conqueror (<date when="1027-00-00">1027</date>?&#x2013;<date when="1087-00-00">87</date>), natural son of Robert II, Duke of Normandy, fought the battle of Hastings, 1066, at Battle, six mi. NW of Hastings, East Sussex. For an account of Hare&#x2019;s scholarship and library with its large collection of German books, see C. R. Sanders, <hi rend="italic">Coleridge and the Broad Church Movement</hi> (Durham, N.C., <date when="1942-00-00">1942</date>), 267&#x2013;70; and for his life at Herstmonceux, see Augustus J. C. Hare, <hi rend="italic">Memorials of a Quiet Life</hi> (London, <date when="1872-00-00">1872</date>) 2:74&#x2013;90.</note> If the Destinies be not unkind I may see all this.</p>
<p>Should a Note arrive from you at Leatherhead before Monday evening, it will accordingly have a great chance to bring me. My address there is, &#x201C;Care of Charles Buller Esq<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, Priory, Leatherhead, Surr<supplied>[e]</supplied>y.&#x201D; What the arrangement of the Country Posts is I know not; but there seems ample time. If I hear nothing, I shall consider you from home, or that the thing is otherwise become no-thing.</p>
<p>In the opposite happy case, a few words about the route were very welcome. I suppose I must get across to Tunbridge Wells; go by Frant, Mayfield, and somewhere near Hailsham find you? Penshur<supplied>[s]</supplied>t and a shadow of Philip Sidney<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sir Philip Sidney (<date when="1554-00-00">1554</date>&#x2013;<date when="1586-00-00">86</date>), b. at Penshurst, Kent. Herstmonceux is four mi. E of Hailsham in East Sussex.</note> seem to lie on the way: anything more of the like sort?</p>
<p>I hope you have no Ladies! My wardrobe contained in a saddle-valise of not many square-inches in extent, is like to be of the most <pb id="pg-12-209" n="12:209"/>Scythian description: indeed the chief article is a <hi rend="italic">Macintosh</hi>,&#x2014;one cannot dine in that with Ladies!</p>
<p>At all events, let me have your prayers for this expedition. Nothing so remarkable in the riding way has been undertaken, I think, since Quixote took the road.</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Yesterday I despatched for you a Letter which had just arrived from Miss Elliot.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John had known Elisabeth Elliot when she was Lady Clare&#x2019;s travelling companion, <date when="1834-00-00">1834</date>&#x2013;<date when="1835-00-00">35</date>; see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18351026-JWC-TC-01"><sic>8:247</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1835-10-26">26 Oct. 1835</date></corr></ref> and Ian Campbell, &#x201C;John Carlyle in Italy,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Carlyle Newsletter</hi> 3 (<date when="1982-00-00">1982</date>): 16.</note> I wrote to her that it was off; that an answer took about a week to come. A short Note of yours arrived just the day after I had sent off my last letter; but as this contained a reply to the question you put, I did not write again. I was very busy, as I had explained; working at my Fourth Lecture; which I finished three days ago. Having now determined on a plan of operations, I send you word about it. A Letter from Alick arrived very lately; pleasantly written, and reporting all to be well in that quarter.</p>
<p>Cavaignac does not go with me on any tour: the humour had passed in the interim; I am not very sorry. After great scheming, it is at last settled that I set out tomorrow morning,&#x2014;for the Bullers&#x2019;s at Leatherhead. I have got a Macintosh, a valise (borrowed from Sterling), a Walker&#x2019;s Map of Surrey. I shall spend perhaps a couple of days, in the Buller neighbourhood, about Leith Hill, Guil<supplied>[d]</supplied>ford &#x26;c So far is made out.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >J. &#x26; C. Walker pbd. county maps in their <hi rend="italic">British Atlas</hi> (London, <date when="1837-00-00">1837</date>) and in pocket form. Leith Hill is a beauty-spot seven mi. S of Leatherhead and thirty mi. SW of London.</note> I mean to spend a week in all; but the rest of it is uncertain. I have written to Julius Hare (the Rev<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) who once before invited me, to Herstmonceux near Battel [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] in Sussex, that if he is at home I will come now. His answer or no-answer at Leatherhead on Monday will decide. If not to him I shall ride somewhither else; towards the sea, I think, to have a dip there at least  The weather is now bright. A week of the green country anywhere will do me good.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-12-210" n="12:210"/>Furthermore, as a finale of the riding concern, I have written to W. Marshal that I wish him to accept the <hi rend="italic">present</hi> of my Mare and furniture; as I am now minded to have done with it. This will be much the handsomest way of getting to be a <foreign><hi rend="italic">Pedes</hi></foreign> [walker] again. If he decline, I must sell the creature: James Fraser last night was speaking about buying her. One way or other we shall be loose. I find six-and twenty shillings a week decidedly more that I can afford for such a benefit.</p>
<p>Lastly, as finish of the whole, I think I shall return with strength enough to complete my two last Lectures at a heat, before the <date when="1840-09-00">middle of September</date>, indeed perhaps about the <date when="1840-08-00">end of August</date>. I shall then be ready for a run into Scotland by steam or otherwise, if the weather and circumstances look promising. I may fly off to America if I like! Before that time, moreover, your course will be in some measure determined.&#x2014; Thus then is it to stand.</p>
<p>My Lectures seem to myself absolutely worth nothing at all. They looked ill as delivered; but wanting all the unction of personal sincerity expressed by voice and face, they look entirely dull and tame on paper. Whether they should be printed straightway will remain a question. There is small temptation as to cash. Poor James dare not risk any money; will go at half-profits, not otherwise! Indeed, as I mentioned to him, it is very curious to reflect that after all this blaring of &#x201C;popularity&#x201D; &#x26;c &#x26;c, the entire sum of cash I have yet got from <hi rend="italic">him</hi> amounts to the munificent bou<supplied>[n]</supplied>ty of one hundred pounds sterling and odd! By American friends I have had not far from four hundred pounds: the <hi rend="italic">Miscellanies</hi> (sold here, prepared there) amount to some &#xa3;240,&#x2014;even allowing James and the Booksellers &#xa3;260 for <hi rend="italic">their</hi> sublime function in the business! It is a concern worth noting; not worth talking about, for we cannot help it. Neither need we. Happily I am not likely to be in want of cash for any time visible yet. Much cash, I feel often, would do me no good. To buy Books, and without any anxiety keep a horse, were perhaps almost all the benefit of wealth for me here. With an independent stock of money I should indeed not continue here. But it sometimes strikes me of late that before long I shall be spoiled for any other place; and obliged to continue, money or no money. On the whole, I begin to grow more and more quiescent. The rule of heeding no <hi rend="italic">hearsay</hi> of others, but minding more and more exclusively what <hi rend="italic">I</hi> do like or dislike, which is really important for <hi rend="italic">me</hi> or not for me,&#x2014;shews many things in a new light. If I could have held by this rule from the first, several sad mistakes had been avoided. Alas, how can the whole world help one? The whole world had perhaps better never <pb id="pg-12-211" n="12:211"/>mind one. It may do its uttermost for a man, and leave <hi rend="italic">him</hi> altogether poor, insolvent, and only <hi rend="italic">seeming</hi> to be rich! I find in the British Empire astonishingly little that it would do me essential benefit to have. I sit in a sort of mournful inexpugnable acquiescence, and look at the green and the paved world; really not very covetous of anything connected with the one or with the other. I hope a New Book is ripening in me; there were the only blessedness; that too a very painful one!</p>
<p>Lytton Bulwer is said to have fallen very unwell; some affect to consider that he is in danger of life: he went to Cheltenham some time ago.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Bulwer had been ill and visiting spas from Cheltenham to Margate to Aix in the <date when="1840-00-00">summer of 1840</date>.</note> It will be a rather tragical fate for this poor Bulwer, I think, in the one case or the other. He is certain before many years to be universally found out and proclaimed as a piece of pinchbeck: how sad when one&#x2019;s youth is all <hi rend="italic">done</hi>, to have then one&#x2019;s evil days, decline of glories, falling off of friends or sycophants, general detection as a quack,&#x2014;beginning!</p>
<p>Charles Buller, they say, aims towards India and a lucrative Judgeship there; meaning to quit politics for five or six years! His Mother, who has been in town for a day or two, but returns today, is very disconsolate at the course things have taken; Lord Durham having now died,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On <date when="1840-07-28">28 July</date>. Charles Buller did not go to India; see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400215-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1840-02-15">15 Feb.</date></ref> It was Arthur who became an Indian judge, <date when="1848-00-00">1848</date>.</note> it seems all <hi rend="italic">up:</hi> she meditates going to Madeira next winter bag and baggage! Not that there is much additional gone wrong with her health; but &#x201C;England and the English&#x201D; are quite disconsolatory to her. Old Buller is very deaf and grey. I called last night on them: Gibbon Wakefield was there. I had seen Gibbon once before; he is the unlucky Theseus who attempted long since to <hi rend="italic">steal</hi> Ariadne Turner, the young Chancery Ward; and, not prospering, had to lie in gaol,&#x2014;and either rot, or become a political philosopher. He chose the latter; is head of the New Zealand and various other schemes: really a remarkable man.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-10/lt-18381226-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <sic><date when="1838-12-16">16 Dec. 1838</date></sic><corr><date when="1838-12-26">26 Dec. 1838</date></corr></ref>, when TC describes their earlier meeting.</note> Ugly, fat; altogether without <hi rend="italic">eyebrows</hi>, and with a pair of small crocodile eyes of sharp blue colour, much overlapped with their fat lids,&#x2014;the face of him, sitting on its great thick neck, with its dirty snub nose, mouth silent yet half-open, expressive of lazy insolence, lazy violence, coarseness, strength and sensuality, is one of the most unloveable faces! But the man is of polite manners; taciturn-emphatic in speech; a fellow of infinite shift, decision, cunning: a kind of Mirabeau with the <hi rend="italic">animal</hi> intellect only. I could heave [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] learned something from him. <pb id="pg-12-212" n="12:212"/>But you cannot handle pitch and have your fingers clean!

<p>Will you have a Letter here about this day week; waiting my return? Perhaps I may write half a word on the journey. <foreign>Adieu!</foreign> <closer><salute>Yours ever</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Before setting out on my long-talked-of Excursion I must send you a word! I am to go to the Bullers&#x2019;s place tomorrow; a place near Epsom (the great race-course), some eighteen miles off. I am to ride out, with a Macintosh before my saddle, and a small round <hi rend="italic">trunk</hi>, the size of a quartern loaf, fastened behind, and no clothes upon me that bad weather will spoil;&#x2014;I shall be one of the most original figures! I mean to stay a day or two about Buller&#x2019;s, riding to and fro to see the fine green country; I have written to a Clergyman, an acquaintance of mine on the South Coast, some 40 miles farther off; if he repeat the invitation he once gave me, perhaps I shall ride to him, and see the place where William the Conqueror fought &#x26;c,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Nr. Hastings.</note> and have one dip in the sea: I mean to be out in all about a week. The weather has grown suddenly bright; I calculate the sight of the green Earth, spotted yellow with ripe corn, will do me good. After that I am to part with my horse. The expense of it is a thing I cannot but continually grudge. I think it will suit better henceforth to get rolled out on a railway, some 20 miles, <hi rend="italic">clear</hi> of all bricks and reek, to <hi rend="italic">walk</hi> there for half a day, now and then, and so come home at night again. The expense of a horse every day here is nearer 4 than 3 shillings,&#x2014;far too heavy for a little fellow like me, whom even <hi rend="italic">it</hi> does not make altogether healthy!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC recorded later in his accounts the costs of the horse: &#x201C;<date when="1840-06-04">4<hi rend="italic">th</hi> June</date> to <hi rend="italic">Horse</hi>, Fly &#x26;c &#xa3;7"0"0 (all but 4 shillings). /<date when="1840-07-06">6 july</date> to Horse, Fly (<hi rend="italic">Monteagle</hi>) &#x26;c / 5"2"0 / sundries in the interim 2"0"0 / <date when="1840-07-27">27<hi rend="italic">th</hi> July</date> to Horse&#x2014; 5 /to <hi rend="italic">Macintosh</hi> and sundries till then&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; 4 / <date when="1840-08-02">2<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Aug<hi rend="italic">t</hi></date> off to ride&#x2014; 5 /Horse gone, weeks ago: all straight seemingly&#x201D; (NLS Acc. 2712).</note> I have offered to <hi rend="italic">give</hi> the beast to Mr Marshall (<hi rend="italic">son</hi> of the original donor) who kept her for me last winter; I hope he will accept, on my return: it will be much the handsomest way of ending the concern. If he refuse <pb id="pg-12-213" n="12:213"/>I think I shall sell.&#x2014; I meditated long on riding all the way up to Carlisle and you! But in the humour I am in, I had not heart for it. These Southern Coasts too are a still newer part of England for me. I give up the <hi rend="italic">riding</hi> northward; but not the <hi rend="italic">coming</hi> northward yet, as you shall hear.</p>
<p>My Fourth Lecture was finished three days ago. On returning <hi rend="italic">strong</hi>, as I hope to do a week hence, I will attack my <hi rend="italic">two</hi> remaining Lectures, and dash them off speedily; the Town will be empty, none to disturb me: about the <date when="1840-08-00">end of August</date> I may hope to have my hands quite free, and then! Thomas Erskine invites me to Dundee &#x26;c; there are steamers, steam coaches: I shall surely see you!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Alick&#x2019;s good Letter gave me welcome tidings of you. I had read your own dear little epistle before.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1840-07-19">19 July</date>; pbd: Froude, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi> 3:191, except the postscript: &#x201C;I forgot to say I have got a little snug peat house up in the garden.&#x201D;</note> Heaven be praised for your welfare. I am glad to hear of the &#x201C;peat-shed&#x201D;; to fig<supplied>[ure to myself my inv]</supplied>itation there,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >MS cut away.</note> with the <hi rend="small-caps">cauldron</hi> singing under your windows.&#x2014; I have written to-day to Jack; there had come a Letter from Miss Elliot for him from the Isle of Wight: he once talked of <hi rend="italic">settling</hi> there; I know not whether that is still in the wind again. He will have to decide about the Pellipar affair in three weeks or less.</p>
<p>Today I enclose a little half-sovereign: you must accept it merely to buy gooseberries! they are really very wholesome!&#x2014;I am to go into the City, to send off some money for the Bank at Dumfries. I am in great haste; I will write again directly on my return, if not sooner.</p>
<p>Alick&#x2019;s Letter,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> tell him, was the pleasantest he has sent for many a day. I thank him much for it, and will answer soon. I still owe Jamie a Letter too; he is very patient, but shall be paid. Did you ever go near the sea again? This is beautiful weather for it now. It would do you and little Tom good I think.</p>
<p>Jane still likes the warmth, and salutes you all. Wish me a good journey! It is like to be a very brief and smooth one. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Mother!</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>As I find this Case will yet carry a word, I may as well return my thanks now for your very pleasant Letter as afterwards. I like the <pb id="pg-12-214" n="12:214"/>tone that prevails in this; it gives me comfort to read it. Never mind what uncomfortable people you have to deal with; what small work it may seem you are engaged in! No work is <hi rend="italic">small</hi>, that an immortal soul has to transact: all work is alike great, if we go to that. <hi rend="italic">Do</hi> the work well; deal with the degraded people <hi rend="italic">wisely</hi>, not foolishly: it will all be right then.

This news too, if it please God, I shall hear and see, one day. You have had great troubles, enough to exasperate a very proud heart. But they will be for good; they will!&#x2014; I should think of you in your little shop, with your household round you, in quiet industry, and God&#x2019;s blessing over you,&#x2014;with true pleasure. Let me not <hi rend="italic">speak</hi> any more of this.</p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Your very kind note has lain by me unanswered for several days;&#x2014;waiting until a practical issue should have perfected itself. My manifold schemings as to rural equitation have ended in a ride over Surrey, and probably as far down as the sea-beach somewhere in Sussex: I set out today; am to return home to my work in about a week, and then sit quiet till about the beginning of next month at least. No Skiddaw therefore, no Friends about Skiddaw. I still calculate, were my work once done, I ought to go and see my Mother for a little while: but all <pb id="pg-12-215" n="12:215"/>this is cast into the prophetic region; a thing not to be diplomatised about at present. In <date when="1840-09-00">September</date> some time, we shall see.</p>
<p>My &#x201C;three disciples&#x201D; in your county<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unspecified members of the Spedding and Marshall families.</note> ought to join with the other three in other counties, and see whether they could not bestir themselves out of speculation into some sort of activity! Unfortunately they seem to me to be almost the only souls in this generation who have any faith that the world is other than a beggarly upholstery concern, to be kept together by plaster and green paint and other such <foreign><hi rend="italic">arcana</hi></foreign>,&#x2014;which is threatening hourly to tremble now. I predict to them that it will; and that paint and plaster are not the methods to keep it standing, or to rebind it when down. At all events, our own <hi rend="italic">life</hi> is trembling; gradually mouldering away, shorter every night than it was in the morning:&#x2014;the Three, and the Four, and all sons of Adam are called to look after this. &#x201C;The end of Man is an action not a thought!&#x201D;</p>
<p>Ah me, I wish we were among the clear brooks, on the fresh hill tops of the North Country,&#x2014;far, very far from this confused distracted irremediable Puddle!</p>
<p>Remember me affectionately to the serene soul of the Colonial Secretary;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Spedding.</note> and keep for me, so long as possible, a place in your own.</p>
<p>So much by way of stirrup-saluation. The horse is at the door.</p>

<salute>Dear James,</salute>
<p>This morning I am just about setting out to execute a little excursion into the Country which I have been long talking of; preparatory to getting <hi rend="italic">quit</hi> of my horse. I go first of all to the house of some old friends of mine, the Bullers, twenty miles off, in Surrey to the south. I hope to reach the sea-coast in that direction, to get a bathe, to have got a ride, to be back here in about a week; to send off my too-expensive horse, and then fall to my work again. The weather has grown as bright as a diamond of late days; the hottest we have had since <date when="1840-04-00">April</date>; people are cutting the yellow fields: I calculate, the sight of it all, for a series of days, will do me good.</p>
<p>I finished my Fourth Lecture half a week ago. I have <hi rend="italic">two</hi> more to accomplish; which I calculate setting about directly on my return  My present project to finish these, about the <date when="1840-08-00">end of August</date>; and then be <pb id="pg-12-216" n="12:216"/>ready for a new expedition northward! I wrote yesterday to my Mother to that effect.</p>
<p>My reason for writing to you today is connected with money. Yesterday, namely, I despatched, by the Bankers Jones &#x26; Lloyd here,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jones, Lloyd &#x26; Co., 43 Lothbury, previously used by TC; see <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340912-TC-MAC-01"><sic>7:293</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1834-09-12">12 Sept. 1834</date></corr></ref>.</note> a sum of one Hundred Pounds, directed to you at the Commercial Bank Dumfries. It will probably be there about Wednesday. Will you go, as on former occasions, and laying claim to it, get me a Deposit-Receipt (Bank Receipt) for it in my name, and keep the same lying safe in your Drawer for me till you hear farther. If Jean or you write a word that it is done, all will be right in regard to that.</p>
<p>If I have any leisure I may perhaps fling you a line in the course of my ride: at all events I will write soon after my return.</p>
<p>Alick sent me a Letter lately; good news from Ecclefechan. The Doctor is still at Oban, in the old posture: something will be decided on there in the course of this month.</p>
<p>Did Jean take the little child down to Mary&#x2019;s to sea-bathing? It would decidedly have a likelihood to do her good.</p>
<p>A noted man has been criticizing me in the last Edinburgh Review. His notions differ from mine as ice from fire; but I am flattered by the way he is forced to speak of me in.&#x2014; Not a word more today.&#x2014; <closer><salute>Yours ever truly</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Mrs Rich,</salute>
<p>Many thanks for your kind message with the Woolwich Newspaper. It is unfortunately not in my power to comply.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Evidently to hear the Rev. Alexander Scott. He had been at the Welsh Chapel, on Parson&#x2019;s Hill, since <date when="1839-01-00">Jan. 1839</date>, where, though an extremely active lecturer and preacher, he was able to continue his studies. The Woolwich Institution for the Advancement of Literary, Scientific and Technical Knowledge had been started in <date when="1838-00-00">1838</date>; Scott had been connected with it from the first; and he can be traced publicly lecturing for it from <date when="1840-07-00">July 1840</date>. Mrs. Rich may have sent TC the <hi rend="italic">Woolwich Gazette</hi> of <date when="1840-07-25">25 July</date>, with its report of one of Scott&#x2019;s lectures and an account of the Institution and Scott, or the issue for <date when="1840-08-01">1 Aug.</date>, with a further report of his series on the &#x201C;Harmony of Nature and Revealed Truth&#x201D; (J. P. Newell, &#x201C;A. J. Scott and his Circle&#x201D; [Ph.D. diss., Edinburgh Univ., <date when="1981-00-00">1981</date>] 235, 249). Scott was elected vice-pres. in <date when="1840-11-00">Nov.</date>, and pres. in <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>.</note> My long-projected &#x201C;rural ride&#x201D; has issued in an expedition to the Sussex coast for a week; <pb id="pg-12-217" n="12:217"/>and I am off today! I hope to return stronger; with the spirit of the everlasting Ocean-salt in me.</p>
<p>I am always glad to hear that Mr Scott <hi rend="italic">speaks;</hi> it is a sign for me that he has got something to say. I think there are <hi rend="italic">many</hi> mortals in this country waiting to hear him. My notion generally is that he has never yet got into the right topic or dialect for these days. But who is there that in this matter can prescribe for another? We must seek honestly, try honestly, and we shall find.</p>
<p>Linlathen lies in the <hi rend="italic">reverse</hi> direction at present! Nevertheless I do not yet give up the daydream of seeing you there this autumn. I have two Lectures to &#x201C;report&#x201D; on my return; and am then ready for another sally. Saint Thomas and Sinner Thomas,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The &#x201C;saint&#x201D; and &#x201C;sinner&#x201D; are Erskine and TC. Mary Rich had been a fervent disciple of Thomas Erskine since the <date when="1830-00-00">early 1830</date>s, and Scott a profound influence on Erskine since they met in <date when="1826-00-00">1826</date>. Their circle had included the Rev. J. Macleod Campbell, the Rev. James Dunn, John Sterling, F. D. Maurice, and eventually George MacDonald. Scott, Campbell, and Erskine in particular contributed to a &#x201C;breaking up&#x201D; of Calvinism in its old form, which culminated in Campbell&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">The Nature of the Atonement</hi> (London, <date when="1869-00-00">1869</date>), &#x201C;perhaps Scotland&#x2019;s greatest theological work&#x201D; (J. P. Newell 219).</note> with you for a Mediatrix, might make a very pretty party!</p>

<p>Thanks for your Letter and Papers. The Welsh D. D. looking into his new raree-shew, with such an honest just expression of his feeling <pb id="pg-12-218" n="12:218"/>about it, entertains me much.

<p><salute>My dear dear Goody,&#x2014;</salute>I hope you are very anxious about me, and that this letter will come in fulfilment of much longing!&#x2014; I have only a minute, and must beg you to be content with a word.</p>
<p>Julius Hare has written; I enclose you his letter,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> one of the kindest. But the perversity of country posts nearly ruins us: instead of finding his Letter <hi rend="italic">yesterday morning</hi>, I get it <hi rend="italic">this</hi> morning,&#x2014;or rather, as inevitably has happened, for I rode off <hi rend="italic">without</hi> waiting for the Post (not to lose <hi rend="italic">another</hi> day)&#x2014;I got it at 4 o&#x2019;clock this afternoon, and Hare has to be off for London on Friday!&#x2014; After some considerable deliberation, I determine still on <hi rend="italic">going:</hi> I am off tomorrow about six o&#x2019;clock; I expect by dint of great effort to get within some twenty miles of Herstmonceux tomorrow evening; I may dine, or even perhaps, tho&#x2019; not probably, breakfast with Hare on Thursday: on Friday or at farthest Saturday I set off on my return homewards; on Saturday night, or at farthest Sunday I expect to be home. Were it not that you would laugh at me, you gipsey! I think I should set off tomorrow morning, and be <pb id="pg-12-219" n="12:219"/>home to dine. For the weather is hot as the Simoom; all roads a mere whirlpool of chalk-dust, and a glaring sun like to roast the brains <hi rend="italic">and</hi> eyes out of one! But I will as much as may be keep off the highways, and ride in lanes.</p>
<p>Miss Bethune<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably a da. of John Drinkwater Bethune (<date when="1762-00-00">1762</date>&#x2013;<date when="1844-00-00">1844</date>), historian of the siege of Gibraltar, who lived at Thorncroft, nr. Leatherhead.</note> sang at boundless length to me last night, and really to my very great entertainment. <hi rend="italic">Adam</hi> is a fine old fellow; Eve his wife pleases me too; Cain also was there: they are all good people.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably Adam, Eve, and Cain are Charles Buller, Sr., his wife, and one of the sons.</note></p>
<p>Today I went off about seven of the clock to Leith Hill, a celebrated Eminence of these parts. I breakfasted in the strangest hedge-alehouse at the opposite foot of the Hill; plucked a twig of heath; rode thro&#x2019; innumerable lanes, woods, lone-lying hamlets, spoke to all manner of persons,&#x2014;and so arrived here, as you comprehend, to find Hare&#x2019;s Letter, and have my dinner. The ride has done me distinct good. I seldom, in spite of the horrible <hi rend="italic">heat</hi>, have spent a more interesting day of locomotion. Particulars when we meet! The good hosts here are as kind as possible. Milnes turned up in the neighbourhood today; they are anxious that I would stay; but <hi rend="italic">you</hi> would laugh at me, and I cannot! Have your earthquakes done; and the house all ready for me to begin work at my return.</p>
<p>I know not whitherward to bid you write to me, if not to &#x201C;Rev<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Julius Hare, Herstmonceux, Sussex,&#x201D; without loss of time after receiving this.

<salute>Dear Sterling,</salute>
<p>Yesterday, at my return home from foreign parts, I found waiting for me among several messages one which concerns you in some slight degree; namely, &#x201C;a poor lithograph,&#x201D; so Emerson the New-Englander calls it, &#x201C;of Concord Battle-field and Village.&#x201D; Two copies of the thing had come: one is for me; the other, &#x201C;as Sterling seems to be of more nomadic habits,&#x201D; I am to request Sterling to accept as a particle of the unexplored spaces where friends of his dwell and love him. The Print <pb id="pg-12-220" n="12:220"/>includes Emerson&#x2019;s Grandfather&#x2019;s house, &#x201C;under the trees near the monument,&#x201D; where E. himself once lived. His present residence is not in the field of the Picture.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Concord Freeman</hi>, <date when="1840-06-26">26 June</date>, had advertised a &#x201C;large and handsome lithographic engraving of the BATTLEGROUND AND MONUMENT in this town,&#x201D; at 25&#x26;cent; each; Emerson had sent them to his brother William in New York for G. H. Calvert to bring to TC: &#x201C;Carlyle has such a passion for exact inform<hi rend="italic">n</hi> that I know the thing will be welcome to him&#x201D; (Slater, <hi rend="italic">CEC</hi> 272, and Rusk 2:307).</note> The &#x201C;monument&#x201D; seems to stand where the first English soldier fell in the American War of Independence.&#x2014; I will roll the thing together, and leave it with your address at your Father&#x2019;s. As a print it is worth nothing; but as the shadow of a Friend&#x2019;s residence far over the ocean water it is worth something.</p>
<p>My surprising expedition, as you already guess, has been <hi rend="italic">accomplished;</hi> I have &#x201C;ridden into England,&#x201D; and am safe back! My course proved not to be towards Stonehenge, but to Leatherhead and thence to Herstmonceux and Julius Hare. My eyes and brains were as if roasted out of me by the blazing heat: I spent my days, astride of the mare <hi rend="italic">Citoyenne</hi>, in unfathomable mournful meditation, speechless colloquy with the green pleasant fields and everlasting skies, <foreign><hi rend="italic">voll Unmuth, Sehnsucht, wehmuth und verdruss</hi></foreign> [full of gloom, longing, sadness, and vexation], and such other sable humour as goes with me everywhere, <foreign><hi rend="italic">post equitem sendens</hi></foreign> [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>].<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><foreign><hi rend="italic">Post equitem sedet atra cura:</hi></foreign> &#x201C;Behind the horseman sits black care&#x201D; (Horace, <hi rend="italic">Odes</hi> 3.1.40).</note> I often longed for Sterling; it is not good for the riding man to be alone. I loved Hare, and his pleasant dwelling place; his good sister-in-law was good to me:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Maria Hare, b. Leycester (d. <date when="1870-00-00">1870</date>), m.

On the whole I have got myself horribly tired and burnt; but fancy I have laid up something out of my enterprise, and would not, for a greater price of pain, have forborne it. One gets nothing in this world except by tabling the price for it.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Your Letter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> lay waiting me here on my return on Saturday; I had heard word of it from Jane in the course of my travels. For my &#x201C;travels,&#x201D; as you are to understand, have actually taken place, and been accomplished, tho&#x2019; not entirely in the way anticipated at first. Cavaignac, when the day came, could not go. Curious enough: he had anticipated a horse from one Montauban,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Col. Buffet de Montauban, who had come to London with Louis Napoleon, and who took part in the attempted coup at Boulogne.</note> a noisy Buonapartist Colonel of his acquaintance, who was bound in those very days &#x201C;for Paris&#x201D;; but it turned out that the horse could not be spared. And now it strikes me as most probable that this same loud Buonapartist may be one of those who accompanied Louis Napoleon on his late onslaught against the windmills at Boulogne;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charles Louis Napoleon Bonaparte (<date when="1808-00-00">1808</date>&#x2013;<date when="1873-00-00">73</date>). Since <date when="1838-10-00">Oct. 1838</date> he had been in London, mixing in the Blessington, D&#x2019;Orsay, and Disraeli circle, planning his &#x201C;Quixotic&#x201D; coup (<date when="1840-08-06">6 Aug.</date>), when with a small band of followers he tried to provoke a rising of troops at Boulogne. He failed and was to be tried and sentenced to detention for life in the fortress of Ham, from which he escaped to London in <date when="1846-00-00">1846</date>.</note> that he probably took his horse with him, <pb id="pg-12-222" n="12:222"/>and that both he and it are now lying safe in the keeping of Louis Philippe of the Orleans branch of Bourbons, King of the French or Citizen-King!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-05/lt-18300809-TC-GE-01"><sic>5:139</sic><corr>TC to GE, <date when="1830-08-09">9 Aug. 1830</date></corr></ref>.</note> So strangely are world-history and parish-history interwoven. Montauban was a man mad enough for such a windmill expedition. He threatened once to call here; where I did not want him, where I shall probably now never see him. He one day met Lord Something or other whose brother had suddenly died a few days before; mistaking the personal identity, Montauban exclaimed with astonishment: &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Quoi, Monsieur? Mon Dieu, vous n&#x2019;&#xEA;tes pas mort, vous voil&#xE0;</hi></foreign> [What, Sir? My God, you are not dead, there you are]!&#x201D;&#x2014; Enough, Cavaignac did not go; nor at bottom did I much regret it.</p>
<p>I set off on Sunday gone a week; to Leatherhead where the Bullers live; meaning thence to go to Herstmonceux, on the Sussex coast, where Julius Hare lives, to whom I had written proposing it; from whom I had of old an invitation. The weather was sultry, dusty; I should rather say, windy and fiery. I would have given five guineas to desist and stay at home; but I could not for very shame  I went off with my Mackintosh in fronth [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>], my saddle valise behind; pocket full of maps, cigars and <foreign><hi rend="italic">et-ceteras;</hi></foreign> my heart very much in the mood of Attila Schmelzle&#x2019;s,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In Richter&#x2019;s &#x201C;Army-Chaplain Schmelzle&#x2019;s Journey to Flaetz,&#x201D; TC&#x2019;s trans., <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 22:131&#x2013;92.</note> I believe;&#x2014;right against the teeth of the blazing sun. And so I rode for a week all but some hours. I staid in the Bullers&#x2019; neighbourhood till wednesday morning; mounting Leith Hill, scouring the beautiful lanes, villages and hill tops all round that region; waiting for Hare&#x2019;s answer which the cross-posts had delayed. Fortified at last with this document, I took the uplands for Riegate [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] and the South, on Wednesday morning early: I had slept little or none the night before; I was in such mood as you may fancy. I rode all day; finding about eventide no reasonable-looking inn, I rode on, and on, till Sussex was getting all asleep, and the very moon had sunk: finally after the stroke of ten I did find Herstmonceux Rectory, and was welcomed with both hands by the good Julius;&#x2014;much to my mind, for I was well wearied by that time; having come, I fancy, something like fifty miles in spite of the ardours of the sun. I staid here one full day and the two nights: on friday morning, Hare had to go and preach at Thirlwall&#x2019;s episcopation; I rode off too, directly after him, by another route,&#x2014;that of Mayfield, Tunbridge Wells &#x26;c; I slept, or rather did not sleep at Seven Oaks<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ca. twenty-two mi. SE of London.</note> a pleasant town in Kent; got home next day by Dulwich (flying the dust-torrent of the white hot glaring highway); found all right <pb id="pg-12-223" n="12:223"/>here about two o&#x2019;clock; &#x26; so have lain <foreign>perdue</foreign> doing little but rest myself ever since. Thank Heaven, the tour is over. Many things dwell with me from it: the Weald of Sussex, Jack Cade&#x2019;s and the Norman Conquerors Country, the green chalk Hills, pleasant villages, good people, and yellow corn: it is all, in my preternatural sleepless mood, like a Country of miracle to me.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Weald was the area between the North and South Downs in Kent, Surrey, and Sussex. Jack (John) Cade led a rebellion of the men of Kent, <date when="1450-05-00">May</date> to <date when="1450-07-00">July 1450</date>, won a skirmish at Sevenoaks, but was eventually defeated and killed. TC had written in his Journal, <date when="1840-08-09">9 Aug.</date>: &#x201C;Mayfield and St. Dunstan&#x2019;s tongs. Hurstmonceux and Castle. Leith Hill, especially Cold Harbour there. Old Miller at Abinger Mill. View of Dorking, Leith Hill &#x26;c from the solitary heights above Park Farm. Rustic asleep on Ranmere Common.&#x2014; Reigate; Bletchingly, the Smith there, Godstone in the hollow. East Grinstead church on the hilltop, almshouse there,&#x2014;solitary pipe there. Maresfield, inn and churchyard. Uckfield in the sunset. Hoathly turnpike; Hornbridge in the dark, and wondrous ride to Herstmonceux rectory, with final kindest reception by the good rector Hare.&#x2014; Frant, emaciated poor woman. Tunbridge Wells&#x2014;villainous artificial-looking &#x2018;larger Hampstead.&#x2019; Tunbridge, Dr Knox&#x2019;s Buildings. Seven Oaks, night and morning. Home by Farnborough (thro&#x2019; roads like the blaze of Sahara in the dog days, <hi rend="italic">plus</hi> the dust), by Bromley and Dulwich. Long before I ride again!&#x201D;</note> I feel it strange that it <hi rend="italic">is</hi> there, that I am here! Want of faculty to sleep determines, more than all else, the conditions of such an adventure for me. Ah me, what unutterable deeps of mournful reverie, as you plod along thro&#x2019; this fair earth, which for you will never be a home! I struggled to talk with all manner of peasants and the like: they are good people; their life for most part more supportable than I have seen it elsewhere. Hare has a noble library, a tastefully decorated house and life; wholly like a bit of beautiful crockery, fine but fragile. Bunsen&#x2019;s bust stood among many busts. His Sister-in-law (Hare&#x2019;s) joined us to dinner; a <foreign><hi rend="italic">sch&#xF6;ne Seele</hi></foreign> [beautiful Soul], not without gaiety of humour too.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >C.

Finally here we are once more, dear Brother; I do not regret that I went, I rejoice that I am home,&#x2014;and will waste no more paper talking about it today.</p>
<p>William Marshall to whom I offered the present of my horse cannot take it; he will send a servant for it any day, sell it and give me the money. I feel decidedly as if I should be rid of the beast. James Fraser talked of buying it; I mean this day to speak to him on the matter. Perhaps I shall manage without troubling Marshall. I think before we get another horse, we must be a little richer, and then it <pb id="pg-12-224" n="12:224"/>should include &#x201C;a fly too to take you out at night,&#x201D;<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400715-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1840-07-15">15 July</date></ref>.</note> and the riding on it reduce itself to a constitutional jogtrot on occasion! We shall see by and by.&#x2014; Or perhaps if James Fraser do not take this Citoyenne I may still keep her till I have done with my two Lectures, and then send her a-walking somewhither? The weather is of the hottest; were it not for these outer blinds I should find this house uninhabitable: walking till towards sunset is a thing one cannot attempt.</p>
<p>Tomorrow morning, however, in one fashion or another, I am to begin these last two Reports. The former four are worth nothing; yet I will finish. They may then lie till after my autumn movements are over; the <hi rend="italic">dust all laid</hi>, we shall then see more clearly what they are, what can be made of them. Fraser will venture no money; I am not in want of money: we need not stir either way on that account.</p>
<p>There has come nothing but a Newspaper out of Dumfriesshire. I am to write to my Mother or some of them today. I have had American Letters, <foreign><hi rend="italic">nichts-bedeutend</hi></foreign> [nothing important]; visitors <foreign><hi rend="italic">ditto</hi></foreign>. A blockhead<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> fires off at me from Pesth in the Eastern regions of Europe<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably Budapest, Hungary.</note> a Letter about Sclavonic History books,&#x2014;having seen from the Newspapers my speech about a London Library! I seal up his ass of a letter again, decline to pay 1/4 for it; and reflect on the stupidity of mortals. Many fools fire at me now:<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC had written in his Journal, <date when="1840-08-09">9 Aug.</date>: &#x201C;Notes &#x26;c requiring answer and assortment for this day. &#x2018;Miss Gillum.

If you turn out to be free when the Lectures are done, some three or four weeks hence, we might meet somewhere; but without some ulterior plan I cannot altogether wish you to be free. I have some notion of a sail to Dundee, where Thomas Erskine lives, very desirous to see me. I long for the breath of the sea. A clear running river even would do me good. I applaud your rowing and your bathing. Farewell dear Brother for this day. <closer><salute>Ever your affectionate</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Jamie,</salute>
<p>It is very long now that I have owed you a Letter; I will write today a little word, just to let you all know that I am safe home from my travels, and about getting quietly to my work again. The &#x201C;rural ride&#x201D; extended to the South coast of the Island, within sight of the sea, in Sussex; hardly seventy miles off in point of space, and not quite a week in time. I staid two days at the Bullers&#x2019;, in a nice house they have some twenty miles from this; I rode about the country, and like the ducks came always home at night. On the Wednesday morning, I set off for the South; had a long lonely ride of five and forty miles or more, to a certain Mr Hare&#x2019;s, where I arrived late at night, very wearied, and was altogether hospitably welcomed. Hare is a clergyman, a man of some rank, what they call an Archdeacon; a most worthy person, a great German scholar and so forth. I was right glad to rest with him, till friday morning, when I set out on my return direct homewards; and arrived, accordingly, on Saturday before dinner; very much broiled in the sun and dust, but otherwise without accident of any kind. The weather was excessively hot; the country very beautiful, very strange; I could not sleep well at nights; that was the grand draw-back. However I have been making it up since I came home, these two nights! I had no heart whatever for the business when it came to the point; I had to <hi rend="italic">force</hi> myself out, and <hi rend="italic">go</hi> in order to get done with it. Nevertheless I feel persuaded it will do me good. I have seen many things; talked with various sorts of people; have brought home with me a strange dreamlike remembrance of that solitary week. The country is all dry chalk knolls, covered with the finest green, except where they have <hi rend="italic">quarried</hi> in them for lime, and you see the white <foreign><hi rend="italic">scaur</hi></foreign>. Trees abound; beautiful villages and houses, mostly of red brick; all looks clear, smart and fruitful. No water to be seen! The dry earth absorbs it mostly all; or the drippings stagnate away, in some kind of obscure drab-coloured <hi rend="italic">ditch</hi> not worthy of the name of brook. I did not see one decisive running stream in all my journeyings. There is no clear river in all England, I believe, from Derbyshire till you get to Devonshire far westward of where I was. The farms are smallish; the barns built of pitched boards with immense roofs. They have no threshing machines; I saw the men threshing with flails; two at once, not <hi rend="italic">face</hi> to face, but face to <hi rend="italic">back;</hi> they also <hi rend="italic">stooped</hi> far more than our threshers <pb id="pg-12-226" n="12:226"/>do.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC is correct; see E. J. Hobsbawm and George Rud&#xE9;, <hi rend="italic">Captain Swing</hi> (Harmondsworth, <date when="1973-00-00">1973</date>) 318&#x2013;19.</note> Their way of reaping too is different: they go round all the outskirts of a good mass of corn all at once, <hi rend="italic">chipping</hi> at it, guiding it lightly by the <hi rend="italic">tops;</hi> then hew in more decisively, keeping the whole mass as it were afloat, and <hi rend="italic">mowing</hi> at it; till a whole sheaf is done in this way at once, and so lifted. Their <hi rend="italic">stooks</hi> they build with twelve sheaves, set as your ten are, but with no <hi rend="italic">hoods</hi>. They were hoeing Swedish turnips here and there, with their hands. The harvest was not far on; but much of it (wheat mostly) was standing yellow, or rather <hi rend="italic">red</hi>. I understood the crop to be rather fair; it <hi rend="italic">looked</hi> very well. But the <hi rend="italic">hops</hi> (and every farm almost has a hopgarden, that is a <hi rend="italic">permanent</hi> hopfield in it, the roots standing from year to year) were a <hi rend="italic">total</hi> failure;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Morning Chronicle</hi> (<date when="1840-08-19">19 Aug.</date>) confirms that the failure of the hop harvest was &#x201C;a worse calamity than any that has visited the hop grounds &#x2026; since <date when="1833-00-00">1833</date>.&#x201D;</note> and great lamenting was heard in consequence. I talked with all of the people I could come at handily: a very civil people, and not at all destitute of plenty of sense; their wages were still about 12/ a-week, sufficient to keep them even in that dear country in their own rather thriftless way: but I think this state of things is about ceasing; for many are out of work; and the Farmers at present are only held to the 12/ by a kind of point of honour, a general understanding that a man cannot live under 12/ a week. This very year, however, it seems they have begun to put an end to the <hi rend="italic">gleaning</hi> of the poor; Hare was declaring he would <hi rend="italic">preach</hi> against so unchristian a thing: but, alas, what will preaching do? By the way of reaping, above described, a good many ears were left; and the poor Mothers with all their children came gleaning there, and sometimes amassed a &#x201C;winchester&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The &#x201C;Winchester&#x201D; bushel was smaller than the imperial bushel of eight gallons or ca. sixty lbs. of wheat that had replaced it in <date when="1826-00-00">1826</date>.</note> or two of wheat: but all this is to be ended now. Many things besides will have to end. But they are some good way, I think, short of our sad pass as yet; and nobody suffers continual hunger, as they do in Macturkdom<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >At Strathmilligan, Nithsdale; for &#x201C;MacTurkdom,&#x201D; see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18351026-JWC-TC-01"><sic>8:244</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1835-10-26">26 Oct. 1835</date></corr></ref>.</note> and else where!&#x2014; I will now say no more about my travels, till perhaps I get a chance of telling them by word of mouth.</p>
<p>Tomorrow morning I am to begin my last two Lectures; I will give myself some three weeks or so; but indeed I must not hurry. After that I shall perhaps be ready for some new expedition,&#x2014;I will hope to the <hi rend="italic">northward</hi> this time! <hi rend="italic">Riding</hi> home to you with my horse will by no means do: it is too slow a business; too mournful when you are all alone, and cannot sleep at nights. If I had <hi rend="italic">two</hi> horses or even three, I <pb id="pg-12-227" n="12:227"/>could do better: to ride them all down before night, and so have my day quite <hi rend="italic">filled</hi> till I were ready for bed! In this way, one might ride from three to four score miles a day very handsomely!</p>
<p>Jack writes to me that Jean was with our Mother at Scotsbrig. Perhaps she is gone before now. I hope the little <foreign>lassie</foreign> got profit by the country air.&#x2014; I fancy you in the midst of hay at present; one imagines, this blazing burning weather must be general. I have no doubt it is welcome to you; for there has been no heat till now. Some people seem to have a hope that trade will mend a little at last. I rejoice to understand that you still &#x201C;carry on&#x201D; with good heart, in spite of all losses and crosses: the times are sore upon a man; he must stand up to them like a man. I am not now so altogether destitute of cash; as for Jack he abounds in cash: at any pinch you must apply to us, and know that brothers will not see their brother beaten. It is all we can do for one another; not much, in this world of toil and trial for us all.</p>
<p>I am afraid poor little Tom&#x2019;s leg is not well yet. It will depend, I take it, on his general health. One must hope all, endeavour all. The poor boy might have lost his <hi rend="italic">sense</hi>, which would have been far worse.</p>
<p>The Mr Marshall will not accept my horse, unless to <hi rend="italic">sell</hi> it and give me the money. I will have it off my hands soon, one way or other.</p>
<p>My dear Mother is up stairs, is she not, in her usual way? She must shift into the big room looking <hi rend="italic">east</hi>ward, if this heat be as strong with you! I will write to her soon. My best remembrances to Isabella, and to one and all. Our oatmeal is done!&#x2014;<closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Brother!</salute></closer></p>
<name>T. Carlyle</name>

<salute>My dear Alick,</salute>
<p>This morning there has arrived a Letter from the Doctor, which I may as well along with half a word from myself send forward to you. It contains nothing; but you will see by it that he is well, and that there was nothing to send. I got a Letter from Jean also, two days ago, with an American Letter which is yours from our Half-Brother in America:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Neither letter found.</note> this I have safe by me, and will not neglect to send back to <pb id="pg-12-228" n="12:228"/>you. I despatched the last Dumfries Newspaper to poor John in Canada, according to this address: I hope you will write to him soon all the news out of Annandale; which are naturally the most interesting of all things to him. He seems to be doing very tolerably well, after all his tumblings. The only distracted thing I hear him talk of is that scheme of his wife&#x2019;s for coming back again. Alas, there is nothing here but hunger and hardship, growing ever <foreign>feller</foreign> [more dire] for the poor working man: he should in no wise, for his children&#x2019;s sake, decide on coming hither again. I suppose, it is his wife mainly, who was an impatient kind of woman.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John and Peggy Carlyle remained in Canada with their three sons&#x2014;John (later a farmer of Delhi, Ontario), James, and William (later a school principal and school inspector)&#x2014;and their two daughters, the eldest named Janet (see <ref target="volume-01/lt-18180902-TC-JCE-01"><sic>1:139</sic><corr>TC to JCE, <date when="1818-09-02">2 Sept. 1818</date></corr></ref>). After leaving New York in <date when="1837-00-00">1837</date> (<ref target="volume-09/lt-18371109-TC-MAC-01"><sic>9:348</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1837-11-09">9 Nov. 1837</date></corr></ref>), they had travelled to Detroit because John had read about the prairies. In a letter to John A. Carlyle, <date when="1869-03-18">18 March 1869</date>, he described how he &#x201C;went to a land office&#x201D; and &#x201C;got the Numbers of all the lots unsold in a fine county in Michigan.&#x201D; It was &#x201C;45 miles from the City; no communication for travil but with a team, I went into the market and bought a yoke of cattle and a waggon and started for this fine country&#x2014;; lost ourselves in the woods once&#x2014;yet wonderfully preserved got to the far end got into a house.&#x201D; His lots included too much water and there was no Church: &#x201C;No sabbath kept by the settlers; they were plowing, draging, washing, going to the mill every day alike. &#x2026; I concluded to come to Canada to see what it was like.&#x201D; He lost money on the move but in Toronto found people that he knew and was well treated. He came to own a farm near Brantford, and when Alexander Carlyle emigrated in <date when="1843-00-00">1843</date> was proud to be able to help him: &#x201C;He came on the <date when="1843-04-01">first of April</date> and before the end of the month he had a home and settled&#x2014;, when I came I had no person to give councel and the change was great.&#x201D; In the same letter he wrote: &#x201C;I have thought some times that I was not like one of the family, but now there is a brotherly love kindled in my bosom that will never be forgot&#x201D; (MS: NLS 1775D.20).</note></p>
<p>My Letter this week to Jamie would give you all manner of intelligence about my wayfaring, about my safe return from that &#x201C;rural ride.&#x201D; I went off with my horse on Tuesday last about twenty miles, to the residence of Mr W. Marshall, son of the Giver of this animal, and left her there for him to sell or do as he liked with. I had before that, offered him the gift of her; not being willing to <hi rend="italic">sell</hi> a creature I had got in that way: but I could not get him to accept; he had no use for the beast; said he would sell it for me, if I liked. I took it accordingly (came home by railway again), and there for the last five days it goes at grass or I know not how;&#x2014;I at least have done with it. The expense contrasted with the benefit was decidedly too high. I feel it a great <hi rend="italic">ease</hi> to be rid of such a daily outlay, and shall so feel it for some time!</p>
<p>My Lecture does not get on nearly so fast as I wished. My whole wish, this week, has been to <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi>, or sit like a man asleep doing nothing! Hardly till today could I get myself roused up again,&#x2014;into a right <pb id="pg-12-229" n="12:229"/><hi rend="italic">fuss</hi> for doing any work! There is not the fourth part of my Lecture on paper yet; but perhaps better than <hi rend="italic">half</hi> of the real work is done. I design to write the following Lecture too without stopping at all.</p>
<p>Our warm weather is entirely gone these three days; nothing but wet and wind again! It suits me, but suits no other mortal. There will be a bad harvest this year again; and none knows what result from it.</p>
<p>I have always forgotten to tell you what good I have got of the axe and sickle you sent me long since! The axe operates successfully in splitting timber and all such jobs. The hook hangs, by right, on a branch of our old scrag of a cherry-tree (which grows large quantities of cherries, mostly eaten by the sparrows); I mow the grass with it, hew down the superfluous vine-branches with it; and many a time thank poor Alick&#x2019;s brotherliness. Many thanks, to you, Boy, for this and for many things!</p>
<p>I have not another word today. My Mother must have the next Letter. I hope the Lecture will prosper better next week. My love to my dear Mother, and to all the rest of you young and old!&#x2014; <closer><salute>Ever your affectionate Brother,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>A Letter was promised from me today; and shall now get itself despatched. I did not calculate that the Sunday would intervene; that there <hi rend="italic">could</hi> be no Letter for you &#x201C;the day after tomorrow&#x201D;: but you will know what is what. To my Mother I made a similar engagement; which I wish she may be able to interpret as well.</p>
<p>My Lecture <hi rend="italic">was</hi> finished yesterday; tho&#x2019; not till after the toughest fight. People interrupted me, my hand was out, all went awry; I had nothing for it but to say and swear that it <hi rend="italic">should</hi> and must be <hi rend="italic">done:</hi> so the tea was up before I would stir from the spot; it was towards sunset when I first got out into the air, with the feeling of a <hi rend="italic">finished</hi> man. <hi rend="italic">Finished</hi>, you will say, in more than one sense! Eviting [shunning] crowds and highways, I went along Battersea Bridge, and thence by a wondrous path, across cowfields, mud-ditches, river-embankments, over a waste expanse of what attempted to pass for country,&#x2014;wondrous enough in the darkening dusk, especially as I had never been there before, and the very road was uncertain! I had left my <pb id="pg-12-230" n="12:230"/>watch and purse; I had a good stick in my hand. Boat-people sat drinking about the Red House;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A tavern in College St., Chelsea.</note> Steamers snorting about the river, each with a lantern at their nose; old women sat in strange old cottages, trimming their evening fire; bewildered-looking mysterious coke-furnaces (with a very bad smell) glowed, at one place, I knew not why; Windmills stood silent; blackguards, whores and <foreign><hi rend="italic">miscellanei</hi></foreign> sauntered, harmless all; Chelsea lights burnt many-hued bright, over water, in the distance,&#x2014;under the great Sky of silver, under the great still Twilight: so I wandered, full of thoughts, or of things that I could not <hi rend="italic">think</hi>. I mean to revisit the place; but in daylight. The days now are so hot and bright, one cannot walk well till towards evening. I go in Steamers and omnibuses; I have the lightest dress in the world, a coat of female <hi rend="italic">serge</hi> or something of the sort, which hardly weighs two pounds, and yet being bright black passes for a coat; nankeen trowsers without drawers; all made at Thornhill, on <hi rend="italic">easy</hi> terms every way. With a light heart and a thin pair of breeches, a man may go far!</p>
<p>Before the steam fall again, which I have had such work in getting <hi rend="italic">up</hi>, I mean to proceed straightway with the last of these sorrowful <hi rend="italic">Lectures</hi>.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;The Hero as King.&#x201D;</note> They will be off my hand; I shall have that satisfaction. For the rest, nothing I have ever written pleases me so ill. They have nothing <hi rend="italic">new</hi>, nothing that to me is not <hi rend="italic">old;</hi> the style of them requires to be low-pitched, as like talk as possible;&#x2014;the whole business seems to me wearisome triviality, wearisome yet toilsome to produce, which I could like to throw into the fire! Some ten days more will get me to the end of it. That is the best. Ah me, I sometimes feel as if I had lost the art of writing altogether; as if I were a <hi rend="italic">dumb</hi> man, whose thought could not so much as utter itself on Paper now, not to speak of utterance by Action! I do lead a most self-secluded, entirely <hi rend="italic">lonesome</hi> existence. &#x201C;How is each so lonely in the wide grave of the All!&#x201D; says Richter.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Richter, <hi rend="italic">Siebenk&#xE4;s</hi>, as trans. by TC, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 27:157.</note>&#x2014; &#x2014; Jane comes, here, to take me out to walk. <foreign>Adieu!</foreign></p>
<p>7. p.m.&#x2014; After an interval of four hours or more, having now despatched Dinner and Tea, I resume. We went to Allan Cunningham&#x2019;s, to pay a long-delayed visit; found Allan in,&#x2014;rather better now than when you saw him last. He looked rosy enough (perhaps <hi rend="italic">too</hi> rosy); was quieter than usual, and in his conversation there seemed a kind of <hi rend="italic">halt</hi>, not defect of utterance, but defect of ideas.&#x2014; We have not seen Darley for long: he was out of health last time when here; in as bad spirits as ever. The other night I went up to Mill: he was sitting over <pb id="pg-12-231" n="12:231"/>Book, and office-paper, a worn-looking man; he <hi rend="italic">twitched</hi> excessively and twinkled all the time I was there; very kind nevertheless: he told me it was <hi rend="italic">not</hi> Macaulay that had reviewed me, which I was glad to hear, but a certain Herman Merivale, a writing Barrister, of common <foreign><hi rend="italic">Philister</hi></foreign><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A German student term for persons not connected with the univ.; see Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi> 140.</note> qualities whom I remember meeting years ago, and discerning the <hi rend="italic">Philistriosity</hi> of. I have heard no other speak of the critique. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Hat Nichts zu bedeuten</hi></foreign> [It&#x2019;s of no importance].</p>
<p>Did I mention that my Horse went actually away almost a fortnight ago? W. Marshall would not accept it as a present; undertook, however, to <hi rend="italic">sell</hi> it: James Fraser, who had once talked of buying, was supplied in the interim: whereupon I rode the <hi rend="italic">Citoyenne</hi> up to Marshall&#x2019;s place, and left her there to his tender mercies. It struck me that I could not well accept a horse to <hi rend="italic">sell</hi> from the Marshall&#x2019;s; but that, in any case, it would be well they knew <hi rend="italic">what</hi> cash was got for it, accept or not! We shall see what results. I do not find myself <hi rend="italic">better</hi> in health for disuse of riding; but also hardly or not at all worse; and it saves me a great deal of expense and constraint. <hi rend="italic">Constraint;</hi> for I felt a kind of consciencious [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] obligation to ride daily.</p>
<p>The Town is altogether empty for <hi rend="italic">us;</hi> and even singularly empty to the mere walker on the streets: hot withal as an oven; I seldom look near it. Darwin still lingers; the last to go, the first to return. Miss Fergus, Elizabeth Pepoli&#x2019;s Sister<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably Jessie Fergus.</note> was here lately for ten days; at her Sister&#x2019;s, that is. We went, one evening last week, to her <hi rend="italic">closing</hi> <foreign>soiree</foreign>. Immense heaps of Tea-cake and waxlights; a Piano, and Italian men in moustachios,&#x2014;men or chimeras. None but Mazzini seemed to have much <hi rend="italic">reality:</hi> they sang and fiddled. Lady Morgan entered with an enormous green fan, to save her eyes, which indeed stand awry in her head, and look very wild;&#x2014;a most chimerical-looking little woman she too. Most Irish: do you remember <hi rend="italic">Daft Sally?</hi><note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> Can you figure her half a foot shorter, dressed in the extremity of mode, green fan advanced,&#x2014;and persuaded that she is a &#x201C;woman of genius&#x201D;? I did not introduce myself to her. A certain withered Pea-bloom Lady Stepney<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lady Catherine Stepney, b. Pollok (d. <date when="1845-00-00">1845</date>), minor novelist and literary hostess; she had first m. Russell Manners, and then m., <date when="1813-00-00">1813</date>, Sir Thomas Stepney (<date when="1780-00-00">1780</date>&#x2013;<date when="1825-00-00">1825</date>).</note> insisted on being introduced to me; as weak a &#x201C;distinguished female&#x201D; as I have ever had to talk with in this world. We were home before eleven.</p>
<p>Light is failing me, dear Jack. I know <supplied>[not]</supplied> what to say about that <pb id="pg-12-232" n="12:232"/>of coming to Scotland, coming to Oban. I fear the latter is too far west! A man<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> invites me to come and see him in Dublin Castle: <foreign><hi rend="italic">Il n&#x2019;y a pas de moyen</hi></foreign> [The means are lacking]. The Sterlings are gone to Ryde; Jane <hi rend="italic">declined</hi> to go with them. The Wilsons are at Malvern.&#x2014; I must have my Lecture done, and <hi rend="italic">then</hi>. Enough, dear Brother. Paper and Lights are both literally done.</p>

<p>I think always some time or other I shall get myself a little house by the seaside; and live far away from all the noise of London. But one must &#x201C;follow his star.&#x201D; I seem to have considerable work cut out for me here; and I ought to feel I was greatly blessed in getting it put forward. London does not <hi rend="italic">seduce</hi> me in any way; but I grow more accustomed to it, see much in it one might learn to like. On the whole I compare myself to the <hi rend="italic">Cats;</hi> I am dreadfully ill to <foreign><hi rend="italic">heft</hi></foreign> [become accustomed]to a place; and then dreadfully difficult to stir when once <foreign><hi rend="italic">hefted</hi></foreign>.</p>
<p>No work is yet lying <hi rend="italic">disengaged on the stithy</hi> with a hammer in one&#x2019;s hand freely striking it! Work I do imagine goes on; but alas, I think it may be a long while yet before much of it get fairly to <hi rend="italic">the stithy</hi>, for the nature of it indeed is a little abstruse. Nothing hurries me from without, nothing,&#x2014;I have grown also lately not to care one penny about all the fame &#x26;c &#x26;c that such a generation as the present could give me, or withhold from me&#x2014;or indeed any generation of Adam&#x2019;s posterity, it seems a mighty small matter to me; and for the rest I have money to buy meal and broadcloth, with; and I do not know what else, particularly &#x201C;the <hi rend="italic">world</hi>&#x201D; has in it that could be superlatively useful to me! Really one feels that with one&#x2019;s head getting grey, and one&#x2019;s heart long tempered in the Stygian waters, very <hi rend="italic">independent</hi> indeed, and quite as a kind of secret emperor among these beggarly population, all hunting like <hi rend="italic">ravens</hi>, and as <hi rend="italic">hungry</hi> as ravens, <pb id="pg-12-233" n="12:233"/>though with heaps of ill-smelling carrion piled round them! So let us be quiet, let us be pious-minded, listen to the Silences&#x2014;to &#x201C;the small still voices&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. 1 Kings 19:12.</note>&#x2014;ourselves silent.</p>

<salute>My dear Jean,</salute>
<p>You have just cause to think yourself unhandsomely dealt with by me!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jean replied, <date when="1840-08-30">30 Aug.</date>: &#x201C;I was far from coming to the conclusion I was ill treated by you either now or formerly.&#x2014; &#x2018;Quite the reverse sir&#x2019;  As &#x2018;John&#x2019; said when asked if he was any the worse for being pitched from his seat on the <hi rend="italic">dickie</hi>&#x2014;into the pavement.&#x201D;</note> Why do I never send you a word since you wrote? Not one pennyworth of Postage-stamp, a few minutes of my time, and &#x201C;Dear Jean. How do you do?&#x201D;&#x2014; Well; I will learn to do better by and by! I will learn to <hi rend="italic">send off</hi> Letters containing the bare statement of the needful; there will never be <hi rend="italic">plenty</hi> of Letters till then.&#x2014; Alas, I am kept in such a fuss of w<supplied>[rit]</supplied>ing (as trade) every day; and then at the ti<supplied>[me]</supplied> when I am not either writing or walking, there is such a stupidity and sick laziness possesses me, I positively cannot stir my finger. Today, for example, it is <hi rend="italic">after dinner;</hi> I have written three pages, and walked to Hyde Park, in the <foreign><hi rend="italic">mooth</hi>est</foreign> [most humid] sultry weather: I write at present with the feeling that there is no man in Middlesex&#x2014;with a greater desire to sleep than I! Take a word from me therefore, dear Sister, and think it is all I can give today.</p>
<p>I have finished my Fifth Lecture, and fairly begun the Sixth. At the rate that proceeds at, it cannot last much longer than eight days; for when I once get rightly <hi rend="italic">ill</hi>, the writing goes along like fire well <hi rend="italic">kindled</hi>. I will finish these beggarly Lectures, then, and have them off my hand. After which I seriously think of taking myself away somewhither, for a week or two; <hi rend="italic">northward</hi>, this time, likeliest of all. That is the essential thing to tell you. I really have some hope now to get into the Solway or some other honest piece of Sea again:&#x2014;ah me! The good Thomas Erskine asks me to Dundeed [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>], whither we have excellent steamers: once there, I am as good as beside you.</p>
<p>All people have gone out of Town; a universal painting, papering and plastering goes on everywhere; and the weather is <hi rend="italic">baking</hi> hot: a dirty close baking weather; eminently unpleasant to me anywhere, here worst of all. I parted with my Horse two weeks ago and more; it <pb id="pg-12-234" n="12:234"/><hi rend="italic">is to be</hi> sold, is not yet sold. I do not regret the want of it; I was tired of daily riding at such a cost. My plans, in short, extend to the length of terminating this Lecture. After that, we shall <hi rend="italic">see</hi> what plans.</p>
<p>I wrote to Jack; to my Mother,&#x2014;charg<supplied>[ing]</supplied> her withal to send you some word of me. But indeed her Letter was no better than this; she will have, as it were, nothing to send.</p>
<p>Jane determines to continue where she is; she likes this Oven-Babylon; which is much more than I do. But indeed what place <hi rend="italic">do</hi> I like? All places, to such a sick wretch, are more or less afflicting. I shall find no right place, as I calculate always till&#x2014;!&#x2014; The Doctor continues at Oban; he does not yet say for how long. Neither do I now know on what terms he continues, whether on the old or on some new arrangement. He has a capital salary, I guess; and seems now growing rather to like his Patient.</p>
<p>If James is as busy as the people are here, he has nothing to complain of in respect of that! But London is here, Dumfries is <hi rend="italic">there</hi>. About <hi rend="italic">ten</hi> fiddles seem to be playing round me, the cackle and squealing of a thousand children, the hammering near and far of many grown people and horses! Pity me.&#x2014; Take the little <foreign>Bairn</foreign> to the Sea again. I have returned the American Letter.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Carlyle of Cockermouth&#x2019;s letter to Alick; see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400815-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1840-08-15">15 Aug.</date></ref></note> <closer><salute>Yours ever affectionately</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Here is your Cousin&#x2019;s fragment again; with thanks for the trouble you have taken in shewing it me. I approve much of the course he is adopting; it is probably far the fittest for him:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Dodds; see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400205-TC-JADO-01">TC to <sic>Rev. JD</sic><corr>JADO</corr>, <date when="1840-02-05">5 Feb.</date></ref> The fragment is probably the paper referred to in that letter. Either the Rev. James Dodds had written to TC again to say that his cousin would follow TC&#x2019;s advice not to give up the law, or TC had heard from Dodds himself, perhaps the long letter referred to in <ref target="volume-12/lt-18401209-TC-DA-01">TC to DA, <date when="1840-12-09">9 Dec.</date></ref></note> at all events, it is like to be the safest;&#x2014;on beaten roads, not thro&#x2019; pathless wilderness full of monsters! When a man has once <hi rend="italic">made up his own mind</hi>, the half of the battle is gained for him. He has thenceforth to be silent, and fight right onwards.&#x2014; It will give me real pleasure to learn that your Cousin prospers according to his purpose. According to what real stuff there turns out to be in him, he is pretty sure to prosper. If it lay in my power to help such a man, at any time, surely it were a luxury for me. <pb id="pg-12-235" n="12:235"/>But one man very rarely can be <hi rend="italic">helped</hi> much by another: it is melancholy to reflect how true this is! A kind feeling, a brotherly loving look to cheer our brother on; this is too often almost all we can do for him.</p>
<p>I do not know much about Mentzel;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Wolfgang Menzel, German critic; see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18361105-TC-RWE-01"><sic>9:85</sic><corr>TC to RWE, <date when="1836-11-05">5 Nov. 1836</date></corr></ref>. The trans. was probably by Thomas Gordon (Oxford, <date when="1840-00-00">1840</date>), although the American C. C. Felton also pbd. a trans. (London, <date when="1840-00-00">1840</date>), as vols. 7&#x2013;9 of Ripley&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Specimens of German Literature</hi>.</note> nor have I been led to consider him as any very momentous man. He seems to me to have far worse heresies than thinking poorly of Sir Walter Scott. With all heresies the Translation of his Book will probably do some good.</p>

<salute>Dear Milnes,</salute>
<p>Tell me a little more minutely what your movements are to be; that we may see whether there is any possibility in this. I do seriously meditate a run to the North; and indeed most probably shall be off thitherward in a week. My course is vague,&#x2014;as that of Life itself. Except to see my Mother, I have no <hi rend="italic">duty</hi> or errand anywhither; only friendly faces, Heaven thank them, in this place and that, looking towards me, &#x201C;Could you not come and be happy for a day or two with <hi rend="italic">me?</hi>&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;Happy? <foreign><hi rend="italic">Ach Gott!</hi></foreign>&#x201D;&#x2014; So I meditate on many Railways, on all manner of Steamers, from Lowestoff [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] up to Dundee, which latter is my <hi rend="italic">Thule</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lowestoft is a fishing port in Suffolk; Thule, the extreme northern limit of the known world to the ancients.</note> for the present. The chance is, I shall box myself, desperately, into the Liverpool Steam-vehicle,&#x2014;wishing I could be drunk or dead all the way; thence straight into a Solway Steamship, and so home to my poor birthland; wander, mostly silent, for a week or two there, with the strangest disconsolate <hi rend="italic">ghost</hi>-feeling, as if one were <hi rend="italic">already</hi> a ghost, and disembodied or nearly so of all earthly bonds: after which the rule is, Plunge hither again, the faster the better, shot out of a cannon if you could get it so,&#x2014;readier to weep than to laugh! This is generally the history of my Scotch Tours. Sinner that I am!</p>
<p>But really I think I should like well to see you <foreign><hi rend="italic">sub Dio</hi></foreign> [under God], among green fields, in your Yorkshire kingdom. Had you been there <hi rend="italic">now</hi>, I believe it would have decided me for Hull, Selby, and the <pb id="pg-12-236" n="12:236"/>rest that might have followed. My speed Northward is generally not so intense. Prophecy, a little, of your times and places! I will keep it in my eye, as a beautiful possibility. &#x201C;Alas,&#x201D; says Goethe, &#x201C;that not only the Impossible should be denied us, but so much that is Possible too!&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Untraced.</note></p>
<p>That day in <date when="1840-07-00">July</date> when you called at the Buller&#x2019;s with your friend Hope,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably James Robert Hope (<date when="1812-00-00">1812</date>&#x2013;<date when="1873-00-00">73</date>), parliamentary barrister; at Eton and Oxford; fellow of Merton College, <date when="1833-00-00">1833</date>; called to bar, <date when="1838-00-00">1838</date>. His speech against the ecclesiastical duties and revenues bill in the House of Lords, <date when="1840-07-24">24 July</date>, led to his appointment as chancellor (i.e., law officer to the bishop) of Salisbury, <date when="1840-08-25">25 Aug.</date> until <date when="1845-00-00">1845</date>. A close friend of Gladstone, he was to join the Tractarians and become Newman&#x2019;s chief adviser. He became a Q.C., <date when="1849-00-00">1849</date>, and a Roman Catholic, <date when="1847-00-00">1847</date>. He m. Charlotte Lockhart, <date when="1847-00-00">1847</date>, and they inherited Abbotsford from her brother, <date when="1853-00-00">1853</date>, and adopted the name of Hope-Scott.</note> I was on the top of Leith-Hill;&#x2014;a pleasant enough place, but nothing so celestial as old John Dennis<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Dennis (<date when="1657-00-00">1657</date>&#x2013;<date when="1734-00-00">1734</date>), dramatist and critic; his description of Leith Hill not traced.</note> found it! The air was dim that day; but what indeed could any day have done? A blowsy mass of green fertility, very &#x2018;beautiful&#x2019; in its way,&#x2014;the beauty of a fat dumpling? There are few things <hi rend="italic">beautiful!</hi> Nevertheless I smoked a cheroot with great satisfaction, lying on the heath there; saw God&#x2019;s everlasting Sun over me, tho&#x2019; with starving labourers and corn-law landlords under me;&#x2014;and the damnable cackle of Cockneydom was safe&#x2014;and far!&#x2014; Mrs Buller was urgent to get up a dinner-party, and have you and Hope over next day; but I had to mount early in the morning: Julius Hare expected me; and I arrived. It was an <hi rend="italic">explosion</hi> of riding, wherewith to end fitly my <hi rend="italic">Equitism:</hi> I am now <foreign><hi rend="italic">Pedes</hi></foreign> again, and my Horse standing for sale.&#x2014;</p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>The Rev<hi rend="italic">d</hi> David Aitken Minister of Minto (between Jedburgh and Hawick), who is here for a few days, wishes to be acquainted with your Cousin: I think they must be within reach of one another. Mr Aitken has travelled, is wealthy, has a Library, has experience, connexions with the world; a prudent, cultivated man: such an acquaintance might prove beneficial to your cousin, and could hardly by any possibility do him harm.</p>
<p>I have undertaken that you would write to Mr Aitken, and, if not send your Cousin to him (which would <supplied>[be]</supplied> the readiest way, if otherwise suitable), at least let him know how the young student is to be come at.</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>&#x201C;Readier to be written to than to write&#x201D;:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John had written to TC, <date when="1840-08-29">29 Aug.</date>: &#x201C;I feel much less call for writing than for being written to.&#x201D;</note> that is precisely my own case too, at present, and indeed generally! However, I must send you a word before the Sunday intervene.</p>
<p>My Lectures ended the day before yesterday: a sorry job, which I am glad to see off my hands, and lying written for Printing, for <hi rend="italic">Combustion</hi>, or whatever else. Most probably, after it has lain a while, I shall go over it again, and with certain parings and addings send it to the Press. It is what I had got to say in those days; better than nothing or else worse. The style of the thing disgusts me exceedingly; but there are truths in it which the people might as well know, and did not seem to know.</p>
<p>I might now embark anywhither; but the weather has got suddenly wet. Expense goes for something with a man whose shillings have to be all numbered. Annandale, except for my good Mother, seems questionable. I have got Steamboat <hi rend="italic">Bills</hi>, and study them; I have <hi rend="italic">undertaken</hi> nowhither as yet. The Town itself is one of the <hi rend="italic">loneliest</hi> places: indeed in what place are there many companions one can get as much pleasure from as an honest silent <hi rend="italic">Book</hi> will give? Milnes will have me come and see <hi rend="italic">him</hi> in the South of Yorkshire; but it is only in the <hi rend="italic">end</hi> of this month. Had he been there at present, I could almost have ventured on him, and gone Northward that way. I find the Newcastle Steamer much cheaper than the Dundee one; and two days nearer. Perhaps I <hi rend="italic">ought</hi> to go and fling myself among fellow creatures? I am very bilious, frettable; inconclusive too;&#x2014;and the weather is very brittle! In a few days, I shall either go, or have determined not to go. You can always write hither till you hear.</p>
<p>David Aitken and his Wife<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC&#x2019;s childhood friend, Eliza Stodart; see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370217-TC-JAC-01"><sic>9:144</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1837-02-17">17 Feb. 1837</date></corr></ref>.</note> were with us yesterday; returning from a three-months continental tour. Very wizzened, very wearisome: and they had to be asked back tomorrow, for decency&#x2019;s sake, to dine! The &#x201C;immortal Creek&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >G. L. Craik.</note> has been called in; a solid featherbed to stand the brunt of <foreign>ennui</foreign>! Poor Aitken is devoured with secret vanity; and his cash has literally only made him wretcheder.

<p>Did I ever tell you that poor old Basil Montagu has, even in the pecuniary sense, gone to pot? They have a &#x201C;Subscription among Friends&#x201D; on foot for him; Swanston and others at the bottom of it: his debts turn out to be &#xa3;12,000 in overplus, no mortal can guess how, and he and his affairs entirely an inextricable coil!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >No mention of Basil Montagu&#x2019;s financial difficulties has been found elsewhere. He was not declared bankrupt. His obituary in the <hi rend="italic">Gentleman&#x2019;s Magazine</hi> n.s. 37 (<date when="1852-00-00">1852</date>): 412, mentions that &#x201C;in the decline of his life, an abused confidence, and an unwise trust in a speculative friend, involved Mr. Montagu in considerable difficulties&#x201D; but seems to date this before his appointment as accountant gen. in bankruptcy, <date when="1835-00-00">late 1835</date>&#x2013;<date when="1846-00-00">46</date>, perhaps in <date when="1834-00-00">1834</date> when the Carlyles&#x2019; friendship with the Montagus had effectively ended (see <ref target="volume-07/lt-18341121-JWC-MAC-01"><sic>7:337&#x2013;38</sic><corr>JWC to MAC, <date when="1834-11-21">21 Nov. 1834</date></corr></ref>). The difficulties could presumably have increased until he needed rescuing. Yet the obituary also says: &#x201C;Mr. Montagu&#x2019;s prosperity was amply shared by his friends and the sons of his friends, and he was most bounteous in his charities.&#x201D; For TC&#x2019;s resentment of Montagu&#x2019;s offer of a clerkship in <date when="1836-00-00">1836</date>, see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18360126-TC-JAC-01"><sic>8:288</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1836-01-26">26 Jan. 1836</date></corr></ref>; and for his critical description of the Montagu household, see Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> 248&#x2013;53.

<p>Some weeks ago, one night, the Poet Tennison and Mathew Allan [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] were discovered here, sitting smoking in the garden. Tennison had been here before, but was still new to Jane,&#x2014;who was alone for the first hour or two of it. A fine large-featured, dim-eyed, bronze-coloured, shaggy-headed man is Alfred; dusty, smoky, free-and-easy: who swims, outwardly and inwardly, with great composure in an inarticulate element as of tranquil chaos and tobacco-smoke; great now and then when he does emerge: a most restful, brotherly, solidhearted man. Allan looked considerably older; speculative, hopeful, earnest-frothy as from the beginning.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alfred Tennyson (<date when="1809-00-00">1809</date>&#x2013;<date when="1892-00-00">92</date>) had presumably met TC through Spedding or Milnes, perhaps at the meetings of the Anonymous (later Sterling) Club, of which all were members. Mathew Allen was an old acquaintance of TC (see <ref target="volume-01/lt-18200519-TC-MAL-01"><sic>1:250</sic><corr>TC to MAL, <date when="1820-05-19">19 May 1820</date></corr></ref>). Tennyson had invested all his money, &#xa3;3,000, by <date when="1840-11-00">Nov.</date> in Allen&#x2019;s scheme for &#x201C;Pyroglyphs,&#x201D; machine wood carving. The scheme failed by <date when="1843-00-00">early 1843</date>.

Think whether you do want it; whether <hi rend="italic">my</hi> share will not do for you.</p>
<p>I will write again whether hearing from you or not if I rush off anywhither. Write you as soon as you like, as you can.</p>
<p>If you go to the O<supplied>[r]</supplied>kneys, our chance of meeting will be at zero till you come back. At Oban, it was not great.

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I have done with my last Lecture two days ago; and all is right here,&#x2014;except the weather! It has got rainy again; not much to my detriment while on the pavement here, but much to the world&#x2019;s damage, I doubt,&#x2014;and small invitation to setting out on a journey! I cannot yet tell what to do. You shall hear farther from me in a few days.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-12-241" n="12:241"/>I send you this sheaf of Leaves purely for the Portrait of <hi rend="italic">Knox</hi>, which seems to me much the best I have ever met with of him.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly TC had finished with his &#x201C;sheaf&#x201D; of portraits after writing out the lectures; and he may have acquired them from Charles Knight, who pbd. <hi rend="italic">The Gallery of Portraits,</hi> 7 vols. (London, <date when="1833-00-00">1833</date>&#x2013;<date when="1838-00-00">38</date>), including Ben Jonson (3:156) and the Somerville portrait of Knox (6:40). On the other hand, TC wrote of the latter in &#x201C;The Portraits of John Knox,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine</hi> n.s. 11 (<date when="1875-00-00">1875</date>): 435 (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 30:360), that he did not see it till <date when="1849-00-00">1849</date>. If that is correct, then both portraits are unidentified.</note> The face of a sorrowful, but valiant wise-hearted Scottish man. A twinkle of <hi rend="italic">humour</hi> in it too; a most genial significant <hi rend="italic">snarl</hi> if you urge it into telling its mind! I believe it must be very like him. My Plan is that you get this Portrait <hi rend="italic">framed well</hi>, as you can (at Dumfries or elsewhere), at my charge: then we will hang it beside Luther, as a memorial of several things. The other Portraits you can keep or give away as you like; they will be worth little to you, or to any one. The whole frolic costs but <hi rend="italic">two shillings,</hi> and is amazingly cheap.</p>
<p>Our acquaintances are almost all gone out of Town; what we can call friends are all gone &#x201C;but about <hi rend="italic">one</hi>.&#x201D; The evening goes pleasantly, over a Book; not much company that is as good. The Sterlings wanted Jane with them to the Isle of Wight; but she does not regret that she stayed. She has not been as well for a good while.&#x2014; Aitken the Minister of Minto with his Wife are here. They have been &#x201C;travelling on the Continent&#x201D; these three months: poor bodies, they have a great quantity of money with no work they take hearty hold of, whereby the much money has literally become worse than <hi rend="italic">none!</hi></p>
<p>Jean wrote to me from Dumfries since you last heard: she reports all well, or in the old way.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On <date when="1840-08-30">30 Aug.</date> Apparently TC had also sent her a print of Knox, as she had had it and one of Luther (sent by John A. Carlyle) framed in &#x201C;beautiful oak frames with oak leaf gilt slips,&#x201D; and they were &#x201C;looking over on each other with great complacence.&#x201D;</note> You had <hi rend="italic">sent</hi> the Letter on to her, as I requested. She does not say much about <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, and you yet say nothing about yourself! Jamie&#x2019;s crop <hi rend="italic">promised</hi> excellently she said: but the weary weather again, what will <hi rend="italic">it</hi> be? Alick and the rest of them I fancy fighting along as usual.</p>
<p>Here is a man come in wanting me! A very fine kind of man, Captain Erskine by name; of the Navy: a cousin of worthy Thomas&#x2019;s.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Elphinstone Erskine (<date when="1806-00-00">1806</date>&#x2013;<date when="1887-00-00">87</date>), entered navy, <date when="1819-00-00">1819</date>; capt., <date when="1838-00-00">1838</date>; appointed capt. of <hi rend="italic">Illustrious</hi>, flagship of North America and West Indies, <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>; admiral, <date when="1869-00-00">1869</date>; M.P. for Stirling, <date when="1865-00-00">1865</date>&#x2013;<date when="1874-00-00">74</date>. He was the grandson of James Erskine of Cardross (<date when="1732-00-00">1732</date>&#x2013;<date when="1802-00-00">1802</date>), Thomas Erskine&#x2019;s uncle.</note> They call <hi rend="italic">him</hi> &#x201C;Saint Thomas,&#x201D; some of the wags that know us both,&#x2014;and in an underhand way to distinguish us, they call me &#x201C;Sinner Thomas&#x201D;: the dogs!</p>
<p><pb id="pg-12-242" n="12:242"/>I must go to this Captain. Except another Letter soon, dear Mother. Write one of your own, why do you not?</p>
<p>Jane&#x2019;s love to you all. My blessing on you from the youngest infant upwards.&#x2014; Take care of wet feet, dear Mother, and other exposures in this failing weather.</p>
<p>Jack writes to me with great brevity of his continued welfare at Oban. He speculates on perhaps coming nearer you; down into Ayrshire. <foreign>Adieu</foreign>, my dear Mother!</p>
<closer><salute>Your ever affectionate /</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name>

<salute>Dear Miss Jewsbury,</salute>
<p>Your Letters<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >She had written again, <date when="1840-08-25">25 Aug.</date></note> awaken in me many thoughts; many feelings, among which affectionate interest in you, sympathy and hope for you, occupy a prime place.</p>
<p>What you ask about &#x201C;Unconsciousness&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >She had written that there were &#x201C;one or two things&#x201D; that she did not understand after reading &#x201C;Characteristics.&#x201D; &#x201C;Do you think the highest gifts can be possessed <hi rend="italic">unconsciously</hi> for any length of time &#x2026; and is not the Faith wh. all the great Natures who have governed the World have felt in their own powers, been one element of their influence?&#x201D; She then went on to ask: &#x201C;How far do you consider the habit of constant self examination a <hi rend="italic">healthy one?</hi>&#x201D; TC answers this in his third and fourth paras.</note> is abundantly pertinent; consistent too with your having rightly understood what the heart of that matter may mean: to all these questions I should answer, precisely as you yourself would, <hi rend="italic">Yes</hi>. With all that can be said about Unconsciousness, surely our whole Life is <hi rend="italic">a becoming conscious</hi>. And yet by these words, <hi rend="italic">Unconsciousness, Silence,</hi> and so forth, I mean something; I mean much, almost all that men ever meant by the highest words. You will see that the contradiction is of the surface, apparent merely. One has to speak out the centre of the business, as <hi rend="italic">it</hi> can get itself <hi rend="italic">spoken;</hi> and leave ingenuous hearers to adjust the details. Things are not speakable otherwise. &#x201C;When we begin to <hi rend="italic">speak</hi> we have begun to <hi rend="italic">misstate</hi>&#x201D;; the first word we utter is more or less an error.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400615-TC-GEJ-01">TC to GEJ, <date when="1840-06-15">15 June</date></ref>.</note> How often have I been reminded of this, in regard to these very subjects! People find something in them, an unfathomable possibility of significance in them;&#x2014;and then straightway their <hi rend="italic">Logic</hi> shews them <pb id="pg-12-243" n="12:243"/>this and the other &#x201C;inconsistency&#x201D;; they get involved among the extremities of the <hi rend="italic">radii</hi>, &#x201C;skip from radius to radius, and miss the centre altogether,&#x201D; come to me as with a great discovery, That there is no centre! Alas, one does not mean to say that men walk on their head, in asserting that New Zealand is antipodal!&#x2014; These are the class of gainsayers that afflict you, my fair Disciple: let them have their say out: we shall see who <hi rend="italic">gets</hi> to the centre; and <hi rend="italic">he</hi> will be the winner, let his tune be loud or low!</p>
<p>My notion about the <hi rend="italic">progressive</hi> Consciousness we do attain in Life may be also worth stating to you. It seems to me, whatever power, gift, or work we have got to see clearly extant, in us or about us, and to be <hi rend="italic">conscious</hi> of, has thereby in several senses really become small, measurable; the <hi rend="italic">vitality</hi> which connected it with the Infinite is <hi rend="italic">out</hi> of it before we could become conscious of it. At best, it is like the part of a Tree you see above ground; so many measurable feet of <hi rend="italic">timber</hi>, good or better,&#x2014;useful for the carpenter, indispensable, and according to Nature: but the <hi rend="italic">roots</hi> of the Tree, the mysterious virtues and workings of the Earth that grew it; these go down to the foundations of the world; these alone are great. This partly illustrates what I mean. We may add, in the same figure of speech, that one should not lay the roots <hi rend="italic">bare</hi>, that &#x26;c &#x26;c, all which your own ingenuity will abundantly develope. On the whole, so far as this doctrine of &#x201C;Unconsciousness&#x201D; will elucidate the world of Being for you, I advise that you dwell in the heart of it rather, and look at the details from that, rather than at that from the details. Which indeed is the rule in all Thought whatsoever,&#x2014;as contradistinguished from Argument, too often the antagonist and destroyer of Thought! The older I grow, all Logic, from being at the <hi rend="italic">top</hi> where it once was, sinks ever lower in the scale with me. It is the deep blindness of this time to conceive of no thought that cannot <hi rend="italic">speak</hi> itself:&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">perfect speaking</hi>, Logic means that; and all speech is by the nature of it radically <hi rend="italic">im</hi>perfect. Benthameeism<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For TC&#x2019;s recent consideration of Bentham along similar lines, see &#x201C;The Hero as Man of Letters,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 5:172&#x2013;73. For &#x201C;Benthamee,&#x201D; TC&#x2019;s adjectival coinage to express contempt, see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18360126-TC-JAC-01"><sic>8:289</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1836-01-26">26 Jan. 1836</date></corr></ref>, and &#x201C;The Hero as Prophet,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 5:76.</note> and all the rest of it follow in a man&#x2019;s head, when he calls the <hi rend="italic">Un</hi>speakable the Nonextant: Logic is good, but it ought to know that is not the best; if it know not this, it approximates to the worst.</p>
<p>I rejoice that you ask me about self-examination. I believe well that there <hi rend="italic">is</hi> an excess in it,&#x2014;that a serious solitary heart like yours is very apt to have erred on that side. <hi rend="italic">Un</hi>consciousness has its word to say here too. Doubtless we should examine ourselves; we must and will do it, in so far as we are not mere animal creatures. We examine <hi rend="italic">all</hi> things, <pb id="pg-12-244" n="12:244"/>ourselves among the number, by virtue of having a faculty to <hi rend="italic">examine</hi> with,&#x2014;an intellect namely! It were possible here also to get into endless hair-splittings, confusions of logic. Omitting all that, I will repeat to you what I have written somewhere, That <hi rend="italic">Know thyself</hi>, tho&#x2019; the old Greek Oracle spoke it as from Heaven, seems to me an altogether impossible attempt, dangerous if too far persisted in; that <hi rend="italic">Know what thou canst work at</hi><note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi> 162&#x2013;63.</note> is a much safer rule,&#x2014;altogether serviceable, which we <hi rend="italic">are</hi> competent to set about! <hi rend="italic">Thyself</hi> never can be even guessed at except by the things <hi rend="italic">thou</hi> hast <hi rend="italic">done:</hi> one&#x2019;s working accumulates itself all round as a natural mirror, wherein the <hi rend="italic">Self</hi> so far as that is suitable may see its image on this side and on that. Decidedly I call it health of mind not to have too much self-listening, study of perfection &#x26;c &#x26;c,&#x2014;too much even of repenting. Go and <hi rend="italic">do</hi> better; that will be the best! Men <hi rend="italic">hollow</hi> themselves out, and become vacant, morbid, often enough go to Bedlam itself, by <hi rend="italic">eating their own heart</hi><note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >As in Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi> 170 and elsewhere; see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18320831-TC-JAC-01"><sic>6:220</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1832-08-31">31 Aug. 1832</date></corr></ref>.</note> in this sense too. As you say, it is but another form of Self-conceit. Who am <hi rend="italic">I</hi> that I should set up for being the model of the Universe!&#x2014; On the whole, one must pray for <hi rend="italic">health of mind</hi>. It will show one the reasonable middle-course in all these matters; and nothing else will.</p>
<p>Dear Scholar, I wish you did live always in the midst of &#x201C;beautiful scenes,&#x201D; of beautiful souls and friends; of things you could take a pleasure in!<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jewsbury had ended: &#x201C;We have been from home a good deal this summer for my Father&#x2019;s health&#x2014;do you not think that if we were able more constantly to look on beautiful objects, our Life wd. be of pleasanter complexion?&#x201D;</note> Welcome <hi rend="italic">enjoyment</hi> withal, seek it; that too is a duty. The Earth has little flowers, brighter than Solomon&#x2019;s glory, amid its stern rocks, under its great awful skies. To you I may say, without danger of your leaving out of view the <hi rend="italic">other</hi> side of it: Consult yourself, what you have a genuine desire for; your genuine desire, in the simplest things as in the highest, is always an important element; an audible monition as if from Nature herself. &#x201C;Our wishes are presentiments of our Capabilities&#x201D;:<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For TC&#x2019;s discussion of &#x201C;capability,&#x201D; see Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi> 119&#x2013;20, 163.</note> that is a brave word. <hi rend="italic">Genuine</hi> desire: how often have our very desires small or no genuineness,&#x2014;mere <hi rend="italic">hearsays</hi> gathered from others (as Ambition &#x26;c &#x26;c), not <hi rend="italic">facts</hi> derived from our own self! The good Doctor says, Eat what you <hi rend="italic">really</hi> long for;&#x2014;and foolish sickly children think it is peppered sweetmeats that their appetite craves. Really, as old Johnson says, we should &#x201C;clear our minds of Cant&#x201D;;<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Boswell, <hi rend="italic">Life of Johnson</hi> <date when="1235-00-00">1235</date>.</note> not our <hi rend="italic">words</hi> only but our thoughts, our very feelings. We should then see whereabouts we did stand; what was substance for <hi rend="italic">us</hi>, what was <pb id="pg-12-245" n="12:245"/>wind and shadow only. I have hardly any other precept to give a true soul in these days. Be true and silent: cast away cant; step silently forward, whither you <hi rend="italic">are</hi> bound;&#x2014;sit down and rest, even, if you can find yourself bound nowhither! Honestly <hi rend="italic">rest;</hi> say honestly, I am nothing, I can do nothing; the whitherward, to your glad surprise, <hi rend="italic">will</hi> by and by disclose itself.</p>
<p>Alas, my Friend, what a sad saying is that about &#x201C;Life forever&#x201D;! It tells me, as in stern epitome, a long history of sorrow, disappointment, fruitless wasting pain. You are not alone in these feelings; but do not indulge in them. For the <hi rend="italic">fact</hi> of the matter, as to other worlds, we know and can know as good as nothing at all. We are in our Maker&#x2019;s hands, there as here; we are to say, as the wise have all said, &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Thy</hi> will be done.&#x201D; Be sure it will go well with us, <hi rend="italic">conscious</hi> or not. Job said long since, &#x201C;Tho&#x2019; He slay me yet will I trust in Him.&#x201D;<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jewsbury had written about there being &#x201C;something inexpressibly oppressive in the notion of <hi rend="italic">Eternal Consciousness</hi>.&#x201D; TC&#x2019;s quotation in reply is Job 13:15.</note> Ought we to say less?&#x2014; I will promise you, too, that such mournful transcendency of <hi rend="italic">Renunciation</hi> will abate in due season; become an earnest background of Eternity of which this fantasm-reality of Time will paint itself all the more touching and lovely for you. Hope always; we are here to hope.</p>
<p>When you write again, cannot you tell me something more of what you <hi rend="italic">are</hi> historically as well as spiritually, what your practical environment is; what things you do, what books you read, kind of persons you see, &#x26;c &#x26;c! No more of this, however, than you like. But it seems to me if I saw even your Portrait once, I could know better what I was saying. Do you never come to London? My Wife would welcome you right kindly here; and, as we are only two, our small household has generally a vacant room in it. Or if I came to Manchester;&#x2014;but I never come of late years.</p>
<p>Good be with you, dear Friend.</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>It was &#x201C;the toss of a halfpenny&#x201D; whether I had not been with you at this point of time, instead of only writing still from my old place that I am not now to come! On Monday and Tuesday, all my bits of business being now either done or cast aside, I meditated strongly whether I should not take some Steamer or Railway and be off. But the weather is fallen rainy, little more good weather to be looked for now, so far as travelling goes; I count how I shall be <foreign><hi rend="italic">brashed</hi></foreign> [shaken] and smashed, getting or giving so much sorrow among my pleasure:&#x2014;in brief, with a very <foreign><hi rend="italic">wae</hi></foreign> heart, I resolve that I shall recruit myself better <hi rend="italic">here</hi> than I have a chance to do elsewhere at such a season, and so ought to <hi rend="italic">renounce</hi> the hope of seeing you this year. It is very sad to me: but what can I do? The miserable irritation of health that I live in renders me the worst of travellers. I think it will be better really to content myself here; and save all the cash I can fo<supplied>[r a]</supplied> <hi rend="italic">wh<supplied>[ole sum]</supplied>mer of country life next year</hi>,&#x2014;somewhere within reach of you, I hope. I mean this, if I live, if I can get a house; nay I almost think I will go to <hi rend="italic">Puttoch</hi> itself, and live like a <hi rend="italic">Moss cheeper</hi> [meadow pipit], rather <pb id="pg-12-247" n="12:247"/>than want silence and free air for another summer of my life! I decidedly do mean to be off, in this way or some way <supplied>[ere]</supplied> another June sun were here. However, it is needless talking of that y<supplied>[et]</supplied> I must do it <hi rend="italic">myself</hi>, for the necessity is my o<supplied>[wn.]</supplied> I surely <hi rend="italic">can</hi> also do it! If I could get some cheap house or cottage by the sea shore, it would be all right. I will take timely measures to get one. Puttoch at any rate could be cleared of Corson:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >One of the Corson family of Nether Craigenputtoch, apparently using the house at Craigenputtoch.</note> one <hi rend="italic">can</hi> get fresh air;&#x2014;and one will!</p>
<p>My plan, at present, however, leads to the reading of all manner of Books; I have got that to do, with an eye to another <hi rend="italic">Book</hi> I am going to <hi rend="italic">write</hi>.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On Cromwell or his period.</note> It is a great blessing to me that some kind of Book does begin to dawn as a possibility again in my head. There is no other use in living that I can find except <hi rend="italic">working wisely;</hi> and that is my work. It will require a great deal of reading first: then I think, next summer if we live to see it, I shall get away into the country to <hi rend="italic">write</hi>. My Book is to be about&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; But, indeed I had better not yet tell anybody, lest the whole pla<supplied>[n of]</supplied> it go! You will hear duly by and by.</p>
<p>My <supplied>[Lecture]</supplied>s, <supplied>[I s]</supplied>uppose, will have to be printed very soon. I <supplied>[nee]</supplied>d not keep them here now that they are written. If Fraser were not out of Town for a fortnight, perhaps we should have made a bargain before now, and have had the thing at press: indeed this was one of my reasons for staying here at present and not travelling.</p>
<p>But to say Truth, travelling into t<supplied>[he]</supplied> count<supplied>[ry a]</supplied>t this brown dim <hi rend="italic">failing</hi> season seems to me, tho&#x2019; universally p<supplied>[ursu]</supplied>ed in this London, to be of all absurdities among the absurdest. London is decidedly pleasant enough at present as to weather; in rain, it is far beyond any kind of country; in sunshine it is never disagreeable for heat. A hot dry June again in these streets strikes me as the nearest approach, so far as weather goes, to&#x2014;a place we will not name! Well, the people quietly continue to be baked all <date when="1840-06-00">June</date>, and now when the country is growing unpleasant and the town the reverse, they rush all out into the country! Wise that they are! But indeed it all comes to the <hi rend="italic">partridges;</hi> they never reflect on this. The gentry need partridges to shoot; their wives &#x26;c have to go with them; all lawyers, traders, men of business can now best follow. Therefore from August till March is the season <hi rend="italic">for the country</hi>. The partridges rule them all.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The seasons for grouse began <date when="1840-08-12">12 Aug.</date>, for partridges <date when="1840-09-01">1 Sept.</date>, for pheasants <date when="1840-10-01">1 Oct.</date>, and fox hunting <date when="1840-11-01">1 Nov.</date></note> They shall not rule me.</p>
<p>Dear Brother, I am writing in the most confused manner. I have <pb id="pg-12-248" n="12:248"/>sat all morning reading one of my <supplied>[Books]</supplied>; I am not well either,&#x2014;I have been out of order all week, <supplied>[but d]</supplied>aily getting better as I keep quiet. But I determined not to let this day go again without a word from me. You must tell my dear good Mother. It will make her <foreign><hi rend="italic">wae:</hi></foreign> but tell her we will live in hope; we will count that a better day is coming<supplied>[. I wi]</supplied>ll <supplied>[wr]</supplied>ite to her myself one of these days.</p>
<p>Ah me, <supplied>[if]</supplied> I had a long <hi rend="italic">prospect-glass</hi>, one of the places I would peep at were Scotsbrig and that region, to see how all is going on there! I fancy the harvest to be going forward: Jamie, I hope, is not getting drowned and wasted this season again.&#x2014; I know not how you yourself go on, my dear Brother: do you ever yet &#x201C;take stock&#x201D; as the Merchants call it, and <hi rend="italic">see</hi> decisively what progress you have? It seems impertinent to be advising you so often on this matter; but I ha<supplied>[ve]</supplied> the greatest faith in good order as the beginning of all good and prosperity in all things whatsoever. I wish you would write to me minutely how you manage and are. Do not repine, my dear Brother, do not waste yourself away with regrets and discontents more than are unavoidable. Alas, we have all our heavy burden to bear: it is a fact also, true as the God of Truth, that we bear it well, it shall be well with us! Courage!&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; I commend myself heartily, in unchang<supplied>[abl]</supplied>e affection, to all of you. My blessings on the youngest-born, <supplied>[its]</supplied> Name<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James; see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400626-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1840-06-26">25 [26] June</date></ref>.</note> <hi rend="italic">you</hi> never told me,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; I did once know <supplied>[it, I]</supplied> now do not.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I may as well write to you without farther delay, that my schemes of Travelling have all gone to nothing; and that I find it will be best for me to sit still here, and &#x2018;silently ruminate sad thoughts,&#x2019; for this year!</p>
<p>On Monday last, I was on the point of setting out; detained only by some washings of apparel, and the like, for a day or two: at that time my favourite speculation was thro&#x2019; Liverpool towards Ardrossan, from which latter point I thought I might probably with small trouble get over to you; and thenceforward accomplish a variety of travel,&#x2014;see my good Mother beyond and before all. This was my plan.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-12-249" n="12:249"/>But the weather grew rainy, cold; I myself was bilious, heartless, solitary and forlorn; I summed up all the smashing and exasperation a poor sleepless creature might count on in short days, long frosty nights: after sad silent meditation and computation I have come to the result that actually <hi rend="italic">here</hi> is the place wherein Prudence bids me continue! The heat is quite out of the weather: I have Books here, Solitude here; my one sole palliative or remedy is <hi rend="italic">sitting still;</hi>&#x2014;which why should not I do <hi rend="italic">here</hi> first of all? It gives me a right sore heart; but so I do decide. &#x201C;I can&#x2019;t get out.&#x201D; I have taken to the reading of things needful, to solitary walks,&#x2014;avoiding the pestiferous Wen where my life is jailed for these years, I take mostly to the lanes and fields such as they are,&#x2014;&#x201C;grieving, by the shore of the&#x201D; Mother of dead dogs!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Pope, <hi rend="italic">Dunciad</hi> 2:260.</note> So stands it with me. I lament above all about my dear Mother: but that also I must bear. When I go to her, she is old and weak; I am sick, sleepless, driven half mad: it is <hi rend="italic">better</hi> that I stay here, and have <hi rend="italic">beautiful</hi> sorrow rather than ugly! I had a Letter from her own good hand this morning;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> I could have <hi rend="italic">wept</hi> over it, but there was no good in that. She has some hope of seeing you: pray do you fulfil it if it be at all possible.</p>
<p>In return for all these disappointments, I calculate all the more intensely that if God spare me alive I will spend the whole of next Summer in the Country; I, tho&#x2019; I should even go to live at Puttoch again for that purpose! I will stay in the peaceable country till I really <hi rend="italic">want</hi> to come back to this at present abhorred tumult! I calculate that I shall be writing another <hi rend="italic">Book</hi> then; that it will be much easier to write anywhere than here. I am bound to save all the money I can, to enable me to effect this object. You would laugh (perhaps not with much <hi rend="italic">mirth</hi>) if you knew all the schemes I turn over in my head, for attaining this unattainable blessing! All country in <hi rend="italic">this</hi> neighbourhood is nigh unbearable to me: defaced with green-paint, cockneyism, dust and din,&#x2014;an abominable <hi rend="italic">aping</hi> of country. I want to be far off, solitary, by the shore of the sea. I must have a cheap country too; I should wish to be within a day&#x2019;s journey of my mother. I have thought of the Northumberland Coast; I have thought of the Isle of Man! We shall think yet more about it,&#x2014;but if in silence all the better.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, thank God, I have again some notions towards writing a Book. Let us see what comes of that. It is the one sole use of living for me.&#x2014; Enough today, dear Jack. Write to me what you are about, whither to go; and continue loving me. <closer><salute>Yours ever</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Jean,</salute>
<p>I am not to come to you this year after all! Such is the result I have made out after summing up all the <foreign><hi rend="italic">Pros</hi></foreign> and <foreign><hi rend="italic">Contras:</hi></foreign> that I had better, in my present state of health, at the point the year is got to, with cold and wet ahead of us, stay still where I am. It was in the beginning of this week, after sore meditating, and not with a very light heart, that I so made up my mind. Nothing grieves me at all, in the many chances of tours, visits &#x26;c, but this of failing to see my Mother, and the rest of you. I care not a whit literally about all the rest, and can surrender them rather with cheerfulness, and think I have had a good escape: but this is rather hard to abide. I must abide it, however. I have settled accordingly to read again; I shall probably print my Lectures; I have even some inklings of beginning another Book. Let us all be content, and <hi rend="italic">do</hi> what is in us: there is no other course profitable. I had a letter from my Mother this morning; expecting confidently to see me soon: alas, it cannot be! I believe I <hi rend="italic">ought</hi> to stay here. For the present there is no remedy.</p>
<p>The consolation I employ for myself is a fixed purpose of getting out of this place next year for the whole Summer. I even calculate that I will come and live at Puttoch if I can get no other place. An authentic <hi rend="italic">silent</hi> Peatbog would have been most blessed to me, many a time, in late years. I should greatly prefer the sea-shore; or some attainable house in a habitable country: but Puttoch <hi rend="italic">might</hi> do, if better were not. I must think of this; and give Corson <hi rend="italic">warning</hi>, if need be, in time. By the bye, has anybody ever seen the colour of his money yet; or to whom was he to pay it? I think it will be needful to awaken him by and by.</p>
<p>We have now cool or even cold weather here, not without occasional rain. I wish your Farmers had their crops up! My Mother says, Austin is getting on; Jamie is about beginning. I wrote to Alick yesterday, the bad news that I was not coming.&#x2014; All people almost that we knew are out of Town: the Town itself is in one of its pleasantest seasons; fresh, clear, comparatively quiet: I suppose 100,000 persons or perhaps far more are out of it, roaming in all quarters of the Island, of the World! One can read here, one has some liberty to meditate,&#x2014;little company comes to me at any time equal to a good Book. I have light Summer clothes; in these I can walk a long way without getting wearied. It does me good to consider myself fixed and settled <pb id="pg-12-251" n="12:251"/>now for a certain series of months: time to be <hi rend="italic">worked</hi> in, or time to be wasted, let me try which!</p>
<p>I sympathize much with James in his <hi rend="italic">irregularity</hi> of employment.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jean wrote, <date when="1840-08-30">30 Aug.</date>, that &#x201C;trade has got suddenly very dull in our line.&#x201D;</note> It is really one of the most provoking miseries; with which I too in my way have had a great deal to do. He would be wise, I think, if he could devise for himself any secondary employment to fill up gaps. He is a shifty scheming man. Alas, a man has need of it all in this country at this point of our history. The distress of all kinds of people is very great.</p>
<p>How are the little <foreign>Bairns</foreign>? Has the little sickly Annikin<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Anne, b. sometime in <date when="1838-00-00">winter 1838</date>&#x2013;<date when="1839-00-00">39</date>, had had chicken pox.</note> got any more bathing?&#x2014; Be good <foreign>bairns</foreign> all of you!</p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Your good little Letter, with a Postscript from Alick, came to hand yesterday. I was <foreign><hi rend="italic">wae</hi></foreign> enough for the disappointment that was on the way towards you; it will reach you today;&#x2014;wherefore I console myself with writing you a word about the same period of time. You must not disturb yourself about my not coming. You ought to rejoice rather that I am sitting so snug here; no coach-horn, steamboat-rumbling, or other the like confusion, to make me afraid! You know what I suffer in these cases. Then with short days coming on me, harvest-work all about me, and the quick prospect of travelling back, sad at parting with you all, thro&#x2019; the stormy weather of <hi rend="italic">hind-harvest</hi> [the time between harvest and winter];&#x2014;it is really better as it is. Next year, as I told Alick, I calculate on making amends. I shall bring a <hi rend="italic">bit of work</hi> in my pocket too perhaps; and so be better content with the country. Our weather here is as pleasant as need be, sunshine not oppressive, with sharp clear air: the best of harvest-weather; and good also for the like of me in these streets. London is at no season so agreeable is [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] in late autumn, and the corresponding season of Spring. I have got my Books, all sorts of thoughts in me about <hi rend="italic">a new Book;</hi> I sit quiet, disturbed by almost nobody. I am fast recovering out of the biliousness produced by my Lecture-writing; I have just one way of recovering: that of <hi rend="italic">sitting quiet</hi>. And so, in my upstairs room here, with my winter dressing-gown <pb id="pg-12-252" n="12:252"/>on but no fire in the grate yet, my Books and Work will be better company than Coach-guards; and perhaps I shall be in better case to start the winter again than the hundred thousand that are at present &#x201C;<foreign>clatching</foreign> [squelching] athwart the country on cuddy asses,&#x201D; or other conveyances,&#x2014;&#x201C;<foreign>gay</foreign> [very] idle of work!&#x201D; They seem to me a set of great fools here, in regard to these things; I need not follow their example. Except that I must not see my dear good Mother this season, but have to content myself with thinking daily of her as before,&#x2014;I do not in the least regret anything else I have missed sight of: most things and most persons I could have seen are perhaps as well <hi rend="italic">waiting</hi> still to <hi rend="italic">be</hi> seen!</p>
<p>The inclosed money is to buy you a suit of winter clothes: it would have been all spent before I could have got up to you by almost the cheapest way; and now if I fancy you, all winter, <hi rend="italic">well wrapt up</hi> on the produce of that, will it not be a comfortable thrift? I know you do not need it; thank Heaven you do not: but from <hi rend="italic">me</hi> it will have a particular <foreign><hi rend="italic">gusto</hi></foreign> nevertheless. Get yourself, over and above, dear Mother, something you wished to get: a little keg of beer over winter, a little this or a little that; stir yourself about, more at ease than you would have done! It will be my greatest luxury. I meant to get you a brave new cloak, of grey frieze or the like, from the front-end of the little purse; but Jane says you can buy such things cheaper <hi rend="italic">there</hi> than here; and perhaps you may have some choice that will please yourself better than mine could have done. Let me know that you are warmly-clad at any rate! Get a good stock of coals, and put them in the new peat-house. I hope to send you up my <hi rend="italic">Lectures</hi> in print by and by; and you must read them with a good fire.</p>
<p>Jack&#x2019;s last Letter was about a week since or more.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably the one of <date when="1840-08-29">29 Aug.</date></note> It appeared not improbable that he might shift towards the Ayrshire Coast; within reach of you by a day&#x2019;s journey. I wrote to him yesterday; enclosing your Letter; advising him to see you if he could. His Patient seems to be rather improving, a good man sunk in that sad distress; Jack in that case might the better reconcile himself to his work.</p>
<p>I have had wearisome Americans here: they are sent by kind friends, and I study to receive them as well as I can. They claim nothing of me but a little of my company, poor fellows! We had certain American <hi rend="italic">Women</hi> in the summer-time; they had come over here as &#x201C;delegates,&#x201D; to discourse and speculate in a grand assemblage gathered in London from all the world to <hi rend="italic">civilize</hi> Africa, and look after the black slaves  <hi rend="italic">Female</hi> delegates were a class of persons the Assemblage <pb id="pg-12-253" n="12:253"/>did not understand, but rather <foreign><hi rend="italic">scunner&#x2019;d</hi></foreign> <hi rend="italic">at</hi> [viewed with disgust], and finally had to reject.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC refers to two separate organizations. The Society for the Extinction of the Slave Trade and for the Civilisation of Africa had its first anniversary meeting on <date when="1840-06-01">1 June</date> in Exeter Hall, chaired by Prince Albert. The British and Foreign AntiSlavery Society had a &#x201C;world&#x201D; convention, mainly in the Freemasons&#x2019; Hall, <date when="1840-06-12">12</date>&#x2013;<date when="1840-06-23">23 June</date>, and their annual public meeting, <date when="1840-06-24">24 June</date>, at Exeter Hall. The first session of the convention, <date when="1840-06-12">12 June</date>, had included an acrimonious debate on the admissibility of women delegates from societies in Mass. and Philadelphia. Lucretia Coffin Mott (<date when="1793-00-00">1793</date>&#x2013;<date when="1880-00-00">1880</date>), preacher, abolitionist and women&#x2019;s rights reformer, m. to James Mott (<date when="1788-00-00">1788</date>&#x2013;<date when="1868-00-00">1868</date>), also a delegate, was the best known of the women and an unorthodox &#x201C;Hicksite&#x201D; Quaker, unacceptable to the British Society of Friends. Other women delegates were Sarah Pugh (<date when="1800-00-00">1800</date>&#x2013;<date when="1884-00-00">84</date>), Abby Kimber (<date when="1804-00-00">1804</date>&#x2013;<date when="1871-00-00">71</date>), Elizabeth J. Neall (b. <date when="1819-00-00">1819</date>)&#x2014;all Friends&#x2014;and Mary Grew (<date when="1813-00-00">1813</date>&#x2013;<date when="1896-00-00">96</date>), Ann Green Phillips (<date when="1813-00-00">1813</date>&#x2013;<date when="1885-00-00">85</date>), Emily Winslow, and Abby Southwick. The vote in convention against their admission was cheered. Elizabeth Cady Stanton, also present, believed the movement for women&#x2019;s suffrage in Britain and the U.S. stemmed from this exclusion, and gave a long report of the debate in <hi rend="italic">The History of Woman Suffrage</hi> (New York, <date when="1881-00-00">1881</date>) 1:54&#x2013;62. On <date when="1840-06-12">12 June</date>, Barclay Fox (also a delegate) noted how well Wendell Phillips &#x201C;brought forward in a very clever manner the indignity offered to his co-delegates by the council by not admitting their credentials nor allowing them a seat in the convention. He referred to Lucretia Mott &#x26; Co., the Amazonian phalanx who sat round 2 sides of the hall, but outside a bar which divided them from the Council.
This led to a hot &#x26; furious argumentation which waxed hotter &#x26; more boisterous for 3 hours &#x26; a half, on the rights of women &#x26; whether it was fit that they should or should not sit as delegates.&#x201D; Fox had described on <date when="1840-06-07">7 June</date> an antislavery tea where Lucretia Mott &#x201C;gave tongue in fine style. She has a happy knack of telling a story &#x2026; showing no disposition to stop once set agoing&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Barclay Fox&#x2019;s Journal</hi>, ed. R. L. Brett 200&#x2013;201). Fox had probably told TC about these events on his farewell visit of <date when="1840-06-13">13 June</date>.</note> The good women were very angry; and determined to preach for their own behoof still, they themselves, in a meeting-house they borrowed. The audience met accordingly; the main female delegate got up to discourse, and, sad enough,&#x2014;could find nothing to say, but sat down again in a very broken manner!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lucretia Mott had &#x201C;called a meeting of women to protest&#x201D; against their exclusion, <date when="1840-06-10">10 June</date>, but TC&#x2019;s public meeting has not been traced. He apparently thought it took place after he had met Lucretia Mott, <date when="1840-07-03">3 July</date>, but he may have heard reports of the convention of <date when="1840-06-20">20 June</date> when she had been scathingly invited to speak &#x201C;if the spirit moves you,&#x201D; by Nathaniel Colby, one of the women&#x2019;s American opponents. Despite &#x201C;the abundance of a full heart and an indignant spirit&#x201D; she did not speak. A projected women&#x2019;s public meeting, suggested <date when="1840-06-16">16 June</date> according to Mott&#x2019;s diary, apparently did not take place; instead a &#x201C;Company of Anti-Slavery Ladies&#x201D; called on her on <date when="1840-06-27">27 June</date>. On <date when="1840-06-24">24 June</date> she addressed an abolitionist tea with four hundred present, but recorded no meeting in London between <date when="1840-07-03">3 July</date> and her departure on <date when="1840-07-11">11 July</date> (<hi rend="italic">Slavery and &#x201C;The Woman Question&#x201D;; Lucretia Mott&#x2019;s Diary of Her Visit to Great Britain to Attend the World&#x2019;s Anti-Slavery Convention of <date when="1840-00-00">1840</date></hi>, ed.

I added moreover that I myself had been a slave all the days of my life; and had still a hard battle to fight, at all moments, to get any portion of my own just will made good.

JWC told George Bradburn (<date when="1806-00-00">1806</date>&#x2013;<date when="1880-00-00">80</date>), presumably one of the American visitors TC complains of here, that TC was &#x201C;much pleased with the Quaker lady &#x2026; whose quiet manner had a soothing effect on him&#x201D; (quoted <hi rend="italic">Diary</hi> 54n.).</note></p>
<p>We have great work with <hi rend="italic">Temperance</hi> here: ballad-singers satirizing it on the streets; on the other hand, rough earnest men, reformed-drunkards as they profess themselves, speaking to great crowds about it on the Sundays, who listen very considerately. I understand it is making real progress. The very Irish, poor wretches, are abjuring drink by the million.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Father Theobald Mathew (<date when="1790-00-00">1790</date>&#x2013;<date when="1856-00-00">1856</date>), Franciscan friar and apostle of temperance, was conducting an enormously successful campaign in Ireland, which included the taking of an estimated 758,000 pledges in <date when="1840-00-00">1840</date>, yet TC may be referring only to the Irish in London. The supporters of temperance and antislavery &#x201C;met in the same premises, used the same arguments, attracted the same individuals&#x201D;; see Brian H.

Articles in the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> of <date when="1840-08-00">Aug.</date> and <date when="1840-09-00">Sept.</date> confirm how active the movement was at this time and include the comment that &#x201C;the march of temperance in London is apparently progressive&#x201D; (<date when="1840-08-30">30 Aug.</date>).</note> I say, it is the <hi rend="italic">first beginning</hi> of <hi rend="italic">emancipation</hi> to them. I could almost weep to hear these poor rude workmen zealously calling on their fellow-creatures, in such way as they can, to awake into manhood, and abjure the slavery of Gin! They speak evidently from the heart: <hi rend="italic">this</hi> is something practical and true they are talking of,&#x2014;while nothing but <hi rend="italic">organ</hi> psalmody and vague jinnerjanner [idle talk] is going on all round them from those <hi rend="italic">hired</hi> to speak. A Scotch Bricklayer in this quarter is said to be one of the most zealous: a head man among the Teetotallers from the North Country was telling us this Bricklayer&#x2019;s history, a while ago.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly James McCurrey (<date when="1801-00-00">1801</date>&#x2013;<date when="1881-00-00">81</date>), b. in Glasgow, a Chelsea bricklayer, who had taken the pledge in <date when="1837-00-00">1837</date> and was a well known open-air Sunday preacher on teetotalism. He worked for Thomas Cubitt, the builder. Thomas Whittaker (<date when="1813-00-00">1813</date>&#x2013;<date when="1899-00-00">99</date>), one of the teetotal national missionaries from Preston, and a lecturer at the meeting where Margaret and James McCurrey had signed the pledge, may be the northern teetotaller that TC refers to, but possibly John Dunlop (<date when="1789-00-00">1789</date>&#x2013;<date when="1868-00-00">1868</date>), Scottish teetotaller, in London since <date when="1838-00-00">1838</date>.

<p>&#x2014;I have this moment received a Letter from Jack; which I will now enclose.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> I have other Letters to answer.

She is well, she salutes you all. Jamie, I hope, will get brave weather for his harvest: no weather could be better than we have here: I wish him well thro&#x2019; it, poor fellow.&#x2014; &#x2014; On the whole, as Jack&#x2019;s Letter contains no new thing whatever, I think I need not enclose it. They have wet weather at Oban, he says; they are <hi rend="italic">not</hi> going to Orkney (which you will rejoice at) but to &#x201C;Dundee&#x201D; perhaps: an Irish friend is come over to them for a day or two, and all goes well.

<salute>Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Erskine&#x2019;s place is a country house, <hi rend="italic">Linlathen</hi>, some four or five miles from Dundee, to the north and inland, as I understand it. He is <pb id="pg-12-256" n="12:256"/>there at present; but not often there; never takes kindly to it.&#x2014; So far as I remember, the coast there is not attractive; clear sea-water is all it boasts of, if even of that. Dundee is a dirty smoky place; a minor Liverpool. Broughty Ferry<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ca. three and a half mi. E of Dundee, and two and a half mi. S of Linlathen.</note> is nearer Linlathen; a diffused village, with streets of loose sand. If you name yourself to Erskine, he will welcome you. Most probably I shall be writing to him in a day or two, and mention this chance there is of you.</p>
<p>On the whole, you do well not to go to Orkney. Choose where you will; the world is all before you where to choose!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi> 12:646.</note> St Andrews I should esteem a fine quiet old City, with Professors of their kind, with books, with venerable old edifices and reminiscences.

I have often thought of it, looking out over the ocean, grim, forsaken, in its old stone-coat,&#x2014;Saint Andrew&#x2019;s bones still availing it so much. Or the finest sea of all I have yet seen,&#x2014;it is the North Coast of the Frith of Forth about Inverkeithing or between that and Burntisland. You are solitary enough; yet Edinburgh across the pure water lies in sight, accessible in two or three hours. I would not have much <hi rend="italic">sailing</hi> more, if I were in your place, this year.</p>
<p>Whitherward you bend for the winter, will be an interesting question for us. Why not Ryde or the South of Wight, not out of reach of us here? In two months when the <foreign><hi rend="italic">canaille</hi></foreign> [rabble] of Cockneydom is home again, it will be a right pleasant place.</p>
<p>I take kindly to my repose here; am in better humour than yesterday; shall gather new strength if <hi rend="italic">well let alone</hi>. Our weather is as good as need be. I am in my grey gown up here; window open, and the temperature much to my mind so.</p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Will you return many hearty thanks on my part to Herr Heintze for the Gift you were kind enough to forward from him. You judged rightly that it would give me pleasure.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC reviewed <hi rend="italic">Lieder und Balladen des Schotten Robert Burns: Ubertragen von Heinrich Julius Heintze</hi> (Brunswick, <date when="1840-00-00">1840</date>) in the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, <date when="1840-09-27">27 Sept.</date> (MS: FC; pbd: Muir, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle on Burns</hi> 55&#x2013;62, and S.

<p>Of Kaufmann&#x2019;s projected Version I recollect hearing once from Goethe; nay I think I saw some manuscript specimens of it, which however did not seem to promise much. That his, and Herr Heintze&#x2019;s, and two other Translations, had actually come forth in print, was certainly new to me.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC wrote in the review: &#x201C;Whether the Germans mean now to run upon Burns, and produce translation on translation of him, thick as blackberries&#x2014;thick as English <hi rend="italic">Fausts</hi>&#x2014;we cannot say. Four in one summer do seem to be enough! &#x2026; What we have to report is that there are four: Kaufmann&#x2019;s of Berlin, this of Heintze&#x2019;s from Brunswick&#x2014;both these reported to be good; then two others, names not given, which probably are rather bad. We ourselves know little of Kaufmann, of the other two nothing at all. But this Heintze, in smart blue octavo &#x2026; him we will salute with some kind of welcome, if merely as the first that has arrived here.&#x201D; The review is an expansion of the points in this letter. For Philipp Kaufmann and his trans. <hi rend="italic">Gedichte von Robert Burns</hi> (Stuttgart und T&#xfc;bingen, <date when="1839-00-00">1839</date>), see <ref target="volume-05/lt-18301023-TC-G-01"><sic>5:179</sic><corr>TC to G, <date when="1830-10-23">23 Oct. 1830</date></corr></ref>.</note></p>
<p>This work I find to be done throughout in a really meritorious manner, all things considered. The grammatical sense is in general accurately seized; a thing not easy to do always in such a case. The poetical expression and physiognomy is given also, more or less; if not always <hi rend="italic">Burns&#x2019;s</hi>, then <hi rend="italic">Heinze&#x2019;s</hi>, who I find has one of his own too. Some Songs I would even call felicitously done; I have read none that were not done creditably.</p>
<p>Perhaps the one counsel I should venture to give Herr Heintze were this: In all cases to <hi rend="italic">learn the tune</hi> first. Thomson&#x2019;s Collection of Scotch Songs, Johnson&#x2019;s Collection,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">A Select Collection of Original Scotish Airs for the Voice</hi>, ed. George Thomson, 4 vols. (London, <date when="1793-00-00">1793</date>&#x2013;<date when="1799-00-00">99</date>); <hi rend="italic">The Scots Musical Museum</hi>, ed. James Johnson, 6 vols. (Edinburgh, <date when="1787-00-00">1787</date>&#x2013;<date when="1803-00-00">1803</date>).</note> or other the like works are not difficult <pb id="pg-12-258" n="12:258"/>to procure; and all the Germans are musicians. The tune is the <hi rend="italic">soul</hi> of a true Song,&#x2014;that is to say, if it be a <hi rend="italic">Song</hi> at all, if it have any <hi rend="italic">soul</hi>. Burns always strummed upon the fiddle till he got his head and mind <hi rend="italic">filled</hi> with the tune (such is his own account); then came the words, the thoughts, all singing themselves by that. There is tune in every syllable: they are the truest Songs, these of Burns&#x2019;s, that we have had in Europe for a long while. The prime root of Herr Heintze&#x2019;s shortcomings, where he has come short, one might define to be this, That he had forsaken the tune, that he did not know the tune: Pray tell him so, if you judge it worth while.</p>
<p>I should guess farther that the Germans would like well to be acquainted with Burns as man, no less than as singer. Herr Heintze might make himself at home in this; his Sketch of Burn&#x2019;s Life already indicates that he is on the way thither. He ought to <hi rend="italic">read</hi> Lockhart&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Life</hi>, Cunningham&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Life</hi>, Currie&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Life;</hi> above all, the Letters of Burns himself, with annotations,&#x2014;till he make the whole present to his own conception.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >J. G. Lockhart, <hi rend="italic">Life of Robert Burns</hi> (Edinburgh &#x26; London, <date when="1828-00-00">1828</date>); Allan Cunningham, vol. 1 of <hi rend="italic">The Works of Robert Burns</hi>, 8 vols.

<salute>Dear Milnes,</salute>
<p>It is as well to tell you now as afterwards that my whole travelling schemes have misgone; that I travel nowhither, but sit still here, and <pb id="pg-12-259" n="12:259"/>wait till my friends return to <hi rend="italic">me!</hi> So, after mature meditation, and computation rigorous as Cocker,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edward Cocker (<date when="1631-00-00">1631</date>&#x2013;<date when="1675-00-00">75</date>); his book of arithmetic was widely known.</note> have I with a sad but a quiet heart decided. It is like the life of Samuel Coleridge; it is like the walking-stick of Joseph Andrews,&#x2014;&#x201C;he did design&#x201D; to carve upon it Mother Goose and Gammer Gurton; then he did design to carve upon it Guy of Warwick and the Dun Cow; likewise he did design to carve upon it Robin Hood, Friar Tuck, and the Pindar of Wakefield (meaning one Richard Monckton Milnes); likewise he did design &#x26;c &#x26;c,&#x2014;and, alas, he ended by carving on it <hi rend="italic">one</hi> nutcracker countenance, there being room for nothing more!

<p>We have clear weather here, and a temperature fast hastening towards zero. I have Books round me, and paper; solitude nearly perfect,&#x2014;for I walk oftenest across the River, avoiding the Wen and its ways: the smoky monster, blotting out only <hi rend="italic">half</hi> my sky in that distance, plays the part of a rather beautiful theatrical phantasmagory for me,&#x2014;exhibited <foreign><hi rend="italic">gratis</hi></foreign>.</p>
<p>On Saturday night there arrived a curious present here: a German Translation of Burns&#x2019;s Songs by one Heinze. The man has missed the <hi rend="italic">tune</hi> for most part; otherwise the workmanship is really not so bad. It seems there are <hi rend="italic">three</hi> others of the same; one by a certain Kaufmann of Berlin, of whom I remember Goethe spoke to me once: Germany has had Four Translations of Burns sent forth this summer!

<p>I wish you would give up occasional poems and write one right poem (in prose I would advise) with what of true music and insight does dwell in you! And yet why should I wish it? Perhaps you could <pb id="pg-12-260" n="12:260"/>no longer be a merry-hearted man; perhaps the smile would depart out of your face, and Richard never were himself again in this world!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Milnes continued to write &#x201C;occasional poems.&#x201D; His most recent collection, <hi rend="italic">Poetry for the People,</hi> had appeared in <date when="1840-06-00">June</date>. &#x201C;Richard&#x2019;s himself again,&#x201D; from the version of <hi rend="italic">Richard III</hi> 5.3. by Colley Cibber.</note></p>

<p>I have got lately, not till very lately, to fancy that I see in Cromwell one of the greatest tragic souls we have ever had in this kindred of ours. The matter is Past; but it is among the great things of the Past, which, seen or unseen, never fade away out of the Present.</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>To avoid all possibility of disappointment I despatch this half-word to wait for you at Stirling; where, if you have taken due measures, <hi rend="italic">two</hi> other Letters of mine must also be found lying. They were directed as of old to Oban. They indicated, alas, that I was not to get out of London <pb id="pg-12-262" n="12:262"/>this year. Except for the sight of my friends, indeed, especially of my Mother, I need not regret the arrangement much: all of a sudden our weather has changed here, and blustery rain, cold almost as winter, has come upon us. Travelling, in these circumstances, would have been very miserable.</p>
<p>I spend my time in lonely reading, with all manner of reflexions and prospections. I got my windows repaired yesterday, so that they cannot any longer jingle upon me! I meditate <hi rend="italic">Books</hi> again; my Lectures are not worth a snuff, but I <hi rend="italic">can</hi> still write a Book, I think. Let us try.&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; I had a Letter from Emerson yesterday: some little cash coming soon from the Yanke<supplied>[e]</supplied> F. Rev<hi rend="italic">n</hi> (which you recollect of, last year); it has cleared its heavy harbour-dues, and seems to promise some &#xa3;50 or so, forthwith.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson had written, <date when="1840-08-30">30 Aug.</date>, that Little &#x26; Brown&#x2019;s account showed a payment of $249.77 due to be paid to TC after <date when="1840-10-01">1 Oct.</date>, for sales of the 500 copies of the 2d edn. of <hi rend="italic">The French Revolution</hi> (Slater, <hi rend="italic">CEC</hi> 277).</note>&#x2014; Except to let me get away out of this London, and be <hi rend="italic">alone,</hi> and a little healthier, I do not see what good more cash could do me.</p>
<p>You are lucky to have a rural winter on the sea-coast before you; and yet, ah me, I know well enough, that too has its evils. We must compose ourselves.&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; You passed close by the gate of Kinnaird,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Where TC had lived with the Bullers, <date when="1823-05-00">late May 1823</date> to <date when="1824-02-00">early Feb. 1824</date>.</note> about a mile on this side of Logierait (where Tummel &#x26; Tay join); at a strait <hi rend="italic">pass</hi> in the road hard by the foot of a wooded hill rising steep on your left.</p>
<p>Write me a word when you can.</p>

<salute>Dear Sterling,</salute>
<p>Here are half-a-dozen Prospectuses, which I beg of you to distribute, as you purpose, with all imaginable zeal.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sterling had written, <date when="1840-09-18">18 Sept.</date>: &#x201C;Will you have some of the printed papers about the London Library sent me? I may be able to <hi rend="italic">place</hi> one or 2 of them here.&#x201D; A copy of the prospectus has been kept with the letter.</note> You shall have more, readily, on demand. It really seems to me that of our innumerable English evils there is no remediable worse one whatever than our condition as to Books in such a country as ours. Worse than Iceland, literally <pb id="pg-12-263" n="12:263"/>so! I met the new Bishop Thirlwall the other week; who warmly participated in my lamentations, and had engaged to himself (he said) that now in his new sphere he might perhaps succeed in helping to remedy such a state of things. It is positively shameful; worthier of Dahomey<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >An independent West African kingdom notorious for human sacrifice and women soldiers.</note> than of England. I, for one instance, have to bear this mournful testimony that I never in my whole life had, for one month, complete access to Books,&#x2014;such access as I should have had in Germany, in France, anywhere in the civilized Earth except in England! Books are written by martyr-men, not for rich men alone but for all men. If we consider it, every human being has, by the nature of the case, a <hi rend="italic">right</hi> to hear what other wise human beings have spoken to him. It is one of the Rights of Men; a very cruel injustice if you deny it to a man!</p>
<p>As to this &#x201C;voluntary-principle&#x201D; scheme of ours, I by no means expect that it will supply the deficiency: but it will do something towards that, it will begin doing it: a beginning must be made. An actual commencement of a Library, it seems, will get into existence this winter, and do what it can to wax towards completeness: the Clerk already counts 400 and odd; 500 once there, we start, with invocation of the gods!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >It did not open until <date when="1841-05-24">24 May 1841</date>, but in the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, <date when="1840-09-20">20 Sept.</date>, TC and Christie advertised the committee&#x2019;s hope that the library would open later in the year. For the first 500 subscribers there was an initial fee of &#xa3;5 and &#xa3;2 annual subscription; for those joining later, &#x201C;the entrance money&#x201D; was to &#x201C;be higher.&#x201D;</note> Help us, what is in you! Could I but persuade you to write a fiery essay on the subject, to kindle the whole Island about it, that were something.</p>
<p>You are a lucky man to see the work of your hands lie on paper, hopeful if not &#x201C;satisfactory.&#x201D; Let it lie till it cool; then, To it with the file and the <hi rend="italic">rasp</hi>, and fancy yourself a very Smelfungus that preferred p<supplied>[r]</supplied>ose to verse! He that spareth the rasp hateth the Book.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sterling had written: &#x201C;I have just finished the first Copy of a poem of 2000 lines&#x2014;but it will want a deal of polishing yet. There is some good stuff in it but on the whole I do not know what to think.&#x201D; It was to be pbd. as <hi rend="italic">The Election: A Poem in Seven Books</hi> (London, <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>).</note></p>
<p>Thanks anew for your love of the poor Miscellanies. No man ever yet &#x201C;said&#x201D; braver words than you about such a thing. It stands in print against you. To me it is inexplicable, inextricable all that affair, now lying ten good years beneath me; the chief joy is that it is all over, off my hands, and may go <hi rend="italic">its</hi> road,&#x2014;godward or devilward, I have no charge of it more.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >After praising TC highly in the <hi rend="italic">London and Westminster Review</hi> 33 (<date when="1839-10-00">Oct. 1839</date>): 1&#x2013;68, Sterling had written: &#x201C;I have been reading again some of the Miscellaneous Works &#x26; may tell you that I find more in them the more I study them &#x26; of course am less contented with anything I have been able to say of them. It is <hi rend="italic">the</hi> book of the last 25 years of England.&#x201D;</note></p>
<p><pb id="pg-12-264" n="12:264"/>My Reviewer, of whom you spoke, is not Macaulay, as was at first told me, but one Merivale whom I think you know about. He is a slightly impertinent man, with good Furnival&#x2019;s Inn faculty,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lawyer-like abilities, Furnival&#x2019;s Inn being an Inn of Court.</note> with several Dictionaries and other <foreign>succedanea</foreign> about him,&#x2014;small <hi rend="italic">knowledge</hi> of God&#x2019;s Universe as yet, and small hope now of getting much. Three things struck me somewhat: first, the man&#x2019;s notion of Dumouriez&#x2019; Campaign,&#x2014;<foreign><hi rend="italic">platitude absolue</hi></foreign> [absolute platitudes]: second, the idea that Robespierre had <hi rend="italic">a religion</hi> in that <foreign><hi rend="italic">Etre Supreme</hi></foreign> of his,&#x2014;O Heaven, what then <hi rend="italic">is</hi> Cant?&#x2014;third, that the end of liberal government was not to remedy &#x201C;Hunger&#x201D; but to keep down the complaint of it; pigs <hi rend="italic">must</hi> die, but their squealing shall be suppressed!<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400724-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1840-07-24">24 July</date></ref>.</note> <foreign><hi rend="italic">Aus dem wird Nichts</hi></foreign> [From this nothing will come]. There is no <hi rend="italic">heart</hi> of understanding in an intellect that can believe such things; a heart paralytic, dead as a pound of logwood! I was heartily glad to hear this heart was <hi rend="italic">not</hi> Macaulay&#x2019;s; of whom I have still considerable hopes.</p>
<p>My Lectures are written out, in a way; but I do not yet decide for printing them. They are not <hi rend="italic">worth</hi> a rush to me;&#x2014;in fact I had said the whole thing already, tho&#x2019; the people did not seem to have understood it there.&#x2014; I am reading Puritan Histories Scotch and English; thrice and four times in my life have I tried that before, with inconsiderable effect. <hi rend="italic">Baxter&#x2019;s Life</hi><note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Richard Baxter (<date when="1615-00-00">1615</date>&#x2013;<date when="1691-00-00">91</date>), English Presbyterian divine, <hi rend="italic">Reliquae Baxterianae</hi> (London, <date when="1696-00-00">1696</date>).</note> was the theme this day; not so unreadable as the most. A kindly, clear-hearted, clear-headed man; terribly dyspeptical too. It seems to me there is no great epoch known at all so buried under rubbish as this of Cromwell and his Puritans. I fancy I have got to see into Cromwell, for the first time very lately, as one <supplied>[of]</supplied> the <hi rend="italic">greatest</hi> amorphous souls we ever had in this land. The stupidities and curses of the world lie heaped upon him these 200 years: let us consider that!</p>
<p>You say nothing about winter and your whereabout; we learn with pleasure that it is to be Falmouth not Italy. As for me when it came to the point of setting out, some two weeks ago, I decided on <hi rend="italic">going nowhither;</hi> the preferable way I found of all ways would be to sit still,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; with many regrets. My daydream is always that I shall by and by get out of this inane hubbub altogether: a small cottage by the seashore, with Books, with Pen and Paper, with hills and a sky&#x2014;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Ach</hi></foreign> <pb id="pg-12-265" n="12:265"/><foreign><hi rend="italic">Gott!</hi></foreign> But the rule at present is, &#x201C;hold your jaw, <foreign>Dinnish</foreign> [loud-talking] boy, and eat your <foreign>pratees</foreign> [potatoes] with it then!&#x201D;</p>
<p><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Sterling; be a good boy, and love me. My Wife sends many salutations.</p>

<salute>My dear Emerson,</salute>
<p>Two Letters of yours are here, the latest of them for above a week:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1840-06-30">30 June</date> and <date when="1840-08-30">30 Aug.</date></note> I am a great sinner not to have answered sooner. My way of life has been a thing of petty confusions, uncertainties; I did not till a short while ago see any definite highway, thro&#x2019; the multitude of byelanes that opened out on me, even for the next few months. Partly I was busy; partly too, as my wont is, I was half asleep:&#x2014;perhaps you do not know the <hi rend="italic">combination</hi> of these two predicables in one and the same unfortunate human subject! Seeing my course now for a little, I must speak.</p>
<p>According to your prognosis, it becomes at length manifest that I do <hi rend="italic">not</hi> go to America for the present.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson wrote, <date when="1840-08-30">30 Aug.</date>: &#x201C;I have heard so oft of your projected trip to America, that my ear would now be dull &#x26; my faith cold, but that I wish it so much&#x201D; (Slater, <hi rend="italic">CEC</hi> 277).</note> Alas, no! It was but a dream of the fancy; projected, like the French Shoemaker&#x2019;s fairy shoes, &#x201C;in a moment of enthusiasm.&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not traced.</note> The nervous flutter of <date when="1840-05-00">May</date> Lecturing has subsided into stagnancy; into the feeling that, of all things in the world, public speaking is the hatefullest for me; that I ought devoutly to thank Heaven there is no absolute compulsion laid on me at present to speak! My notion in general was but an absurd one: I fancied I might go across the sea, open my lips wide; go raging and lecturing over the Union like a very lion (too like a frothy mountebank) for several months;&#x2014;till I had gained, say a thousand pounds, therewith to retire to some small quiet cottage by the shore of the sea, at least three hundred miles from this, and sit silent there for ten years to come, or forever and a day perhaps! That was my poor little daydream;&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">in</hi>capable of being realized. It appears, I have to stay here, in this brick Babylon; tugging at my chains, which will not break for me: the less I <hi rend="italic">tug</hi> the better. Ah me! On the whole, I have written down my last course of lectures, and shall probably print them; and you, with the aid of proof-sheets, may again print them; that will be the easiest way of lecturing to America! It is truly very weak to speak about that matter so often and long, that matter of coming to you; and never to come. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Frey ist das Herz,</hi></foreign> as Goethe says, <foreign><hi rend="italic">doch ist der Fuss gebunden</hi></foreign> <pb id="pg-12-267" n="12:267"/>[The heart is free, but the feet are still bound].<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Goethe&#x2019;s poem, &#x201C;An Lord Byron.&#x201D;</note> After innumerable projects, and invitations towards all the four winds, for this summer, I have ended about a week ago by&#x2014;simply going nowhither, not even to see my dear aged Mother, but sitting still here under the autumn sky such as I have it; in these vacant streets I am lonelier than elsewhere, have more chance for composure than elsewhere! With Sterne&#x2019;s starling I repeat to myself, &#x201C;I can&#x2019;t get out.&#x201D;&#x2014; Well, hang it, stay <hi rend="italic">in</hi> then; and let people alone of it!</p>
<p>I have parted with my horse; after an experiment of seven or eight months, most assiduously prosecuted, I came to the conclusion, that tho&#x2019; it did me <hi rend="italic">some</hi> good, there was not <hi rend="italic">enough</hi> of good to warrant such equestrianism: so I plunged out, into green England, in the <date when="1840-07-00">end of July</date>, for a whole week of riding, an <hi rend="italic">explosion</hi> of riding, therewith to end the business, and send off my poor quadruped for sale. I rode over Surrey,&#x2014;with a leather valise behind me and a mackintosh before; very singular to see: over Sussex, down to Pevensey where the Norman Bastard landed; I saw Julius Hare (whose &#x201C;Guesses at truth&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >(London, <date when="1827-00-00">1827</date>); see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18360412-TC-JOST-01"><sic>8:333</sic><corr>TC to JOST, <date when="1836-04-12">12 April 1836</date></corr></ref>. For TC&#x2019;s journeys, see his letters of <date when="1840-07-00">late July</date> and <date when="1840-08-00">early Aug.</date></note> you perhaps know), saw Saint Dunstan&#x2019;s stithy and hammer, at Mayfield, and the very tongs with which he took the Devil by the nose;&#x2014;finally I got home again, a right wearied man; sent my horse off to be sold, as I say; and finished the writing of my Lectures on Heroes. This is all the rustication I have had, or am like to have. I am now over head and ears in <hi rend="italic">Cromwellean</hi> Books; studying, for perhaps the fourth time in my life, to see if it be possible to get any credible face-to-face acquaintance with our English Puritan period; or whether it must be left forever a mere hearsay and echo to one? Books equal in dulness were at no epoch of the world penned by unassisted man. Nevertheless, courage! I have got, within the last twelvemonth, actually, as it were, to <hi rend="italic">see</hi> that this Cromwell was one of the greatest souls ever born of the English kin; a great amorphous semi-articulate <hi rend="italic">Baresark;</hi><note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cromwell is called &#x201C;the great savage Baresark,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Heroes, Works</hi> 5:209.</note> very interesting to me. I grope in the dark vacuity of Baxters, Neales;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Daniel Neal; see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400106-TC-JOST-01">TC to <sic>JS</sic><corr>JOST</corr>, <sic><date when="1840-01-09">9 Jan.</date></sic><corr><date when="1840-01-06">6 Jan.</date></corr></ref></note> thankful for here a glimpse and the<supplied>[re]</supplied> a glimpse. This is to be my reading for some time.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Dial No I</hi> came duly: of course I read it with interest; it is an u<supplied>[t]</supplied>terance of what is purest, youngest in your land; pure, ethereal as the voices of the Morning! And yet&#x2014;you know me&#x2014;for me it is <hi rend="italic">too</hi> <pb id="pg-12-268" n="12:268"/>ethereal, speculative, theoretic: all theory becomes more and more confessedly inadequate, untrue, unsatisfactory, almost a kind of mockery to me! I will have all things condense themselves, take shape and body, if they are to have my sympathy. I have a <hi rend="italic">body</hi> myself; in the brown leaf, sport of the autumn winds, I find what mocks all prophesyings, even Hebrew ones,&#x2014;Royal Societies, and Scientific Associations eating venison at Glasgow, not once reckoned in! Nevertheless go on with this, my Brothers. The world has many most strange utterances of a prophetic nature in it at the present time; and this surely is well worth listening to among the rest.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson wrote to TC on <date when="1840-08-30">30 Aug.</date> that &#x201C;The Dial, poor little thing, whose first number contains scarce anything considerable or even visible,&#x201D; had been generally attacked, and to Margaret Fuller on <date when="1840-10-20">20 Oct.</date> that &#x201C;I have yesterday a letter from Carlyle who &#x2026; faintly praises The Dial Number 1&#x201D; (Slater, <hi rend="italic">CEC</hi> 277, 280&#x2013;81). The British Association for the Advancement of Science had just had its annual general meeting and dinner in Glasgow, at which members were supplied with venison from their current president&#x2019;s estates.</note> Do you know English Puseyism?<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Another name for Tractarianism or the Oxford Movement, <date when="1833-00-00">1833</date>&#x2013;<date when="1845-00-00">45</date>, led by Edward Bouverie Pusey (<date when="1800-00-00">1800</date>&#x2013;<date when="1882-00-00">82</date>), John Keble, and John Henry Newman, who produced <hi rend="italic">Tracts for the Times,</hi> <date when="1833-00-00">1833</date>&#x2013;<date when="1841-00-00">41</date>, and favored a return to Roman Catholic observances and practices.</note> Good Heavens, in the whole circle of History is there the parallel of that,&#x2014;a true worship rising at this hour of the day for Bands and the Shovel hat. Distraction surely, incipience of the &#x201C;final deliration,&#x201D; enters upon the poor old English Formulism that has called itself for some two centuries a Church. No likelier symptom of its being soon about to leave the world has come to light in my time. As if King Macready should <hi rend="italic">quit</hi> Covent-Garden, go down to St.-Stephen&#x2019;s, and insist on saying, <foreign><hi rend="italic">Le roi le veut</hi></foreign> [The King wills it]<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >W. C. Macready; St. Stephen&#x2019;s Chapel, Westminster, where the House of Commons sat until destroyed by fire, <date when="1834-00-00">1834</date> (see <ref target="volume-07/lt-18341024-TC-JCA-01"><sic>7:317</sic><corr>TC to JCA, <date when="1834-10-24">24 Oct. 1834</date></corr></ref>); &#x201C;<foreign>Le Roi le veut</foreign>&#x201D;: the formula of royal assent when a bill was passed.</note>&#x2014; I read last night the wonderfullest article to that effect, in the shape of a criticism on myself, in the <hi rend="italic">Quarterly Review</hi>. It seems to be by one Sewell, an Oxford doctor of note, one of the chief men among the Pusey-and-Newman Corporation.<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Sewell, 66 (<date when="1840-09-00">Sept., 1840</date>): 446&#x2013;503; see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400724-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1840-07-24">24 July</date></ref>. Sewell withdrew from the Oxford Movement, <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>.</note> A good man, and with good notions, whom I have noted for some years back.

As the Turks say, <foreign><hi rend="italic">Allah akbar</hi></foreign> [God is great]!</p>
<p>I forget altogether what I said of Landor; but I hope I did not put <pb id="pg-12-269" n="12:269"/>him in the Heraud category: a cockney windbag is one thing; a scholar and bred man, tho&#x2019; incontinent, explosive, half-true, is another.<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400401-TC-RWE-01">TC to RWE, <date when="1840-04-01">1 April</date></ref>.</note> He has not been in town, this year; Milnes describes him as <hi rend="italic">eating</hi> greatly at Bath, and perhaps even cooking! Milnes did get your Letter: I told you? Sterling has the Concord landscape; mine is to go upon the wall here, and remind me of many things. Sterling is busy writing; he is to make Falmouth do, this winter, and try to dispense with Italy. He cannot away with my doctrine of <hi rend="italic">Silence;</hi> the good John. My Wife has been better than usual all summer; she begins to shiver again as winter draws nigh. <foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear E. Good be with you and yours. I must be far gone when I cease to love you. &#x201C;The stars are above us, the graves are under us.&#x201D;<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Goethe&#x2019;s &#x201C;Symbolum,&#x201D; st. 3, trans. by TC as &#x201C;Mason Lodge,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 10:237, and a favourite phrase of TC&#x2019;s (7:103, 117).</note> <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>.</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Lest Jack in his rapid wanderings may have omitted to send you sufficient notice of himself, I despatch you that hasty Letter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> of his, <pb id="pg-12-271" n="12:271"/>which has just arrived here. He is enjoying an admirable view of the country at least! I am very glad he means to come down hitherward to the Isle of Wight: it is but some three hours off us by railway; and a beautiful climate for winter.</p>
<p>All this morning we have been packing up a box of duds for you; Jane and I had just finished it when Jack&#x2019;s Letter arrived. It goes off tomorrow by Pickford and the Canal; Alick Welsh will take charge of it at Liverpool; after that it is addressed to <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, &#x201C;care of of [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] Ben Nelson&#x201D;; if anybody be down at Annan, Ben may be directed how to send it up. I should think it might get to Scotsbrig in about ten days hence. Some of the things are <hi rend="italic">marked</hi> as to the ownership; the old clothes ought to be made up straightway into <hi rend="italic">little</hi> <foreign><hi rend="italic">breeks</hi></foreign> and waistcoats: do you divide them,&#x2014;and set the tailor to work!</p>
<p>We have not had a grain of meal these many weeks, and are wearying sore to taste meal again. A barrel the size of last years would be welcome, the sooner the better. Jane says <hi rend="italic">thirty pounds</hi> of butter; if we get it moderately soon, we can consume all that in first-rate order.</p>
<p>Dear Mother, I had your good little Letter,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably MAC to TC, [<date when="1840-09-00">late Sept.</date>].</note> and give you many thanks for it. There are some woollen things in the Box for you; pray wear them for our sake: we have determined to have you warm if possible! Jenny is far mistaken in thinking I forget her; she knows little how I am situated here. I thought I had answered her last Letter? Tell her to be patient with me: I could not &#x201C;forget&#x201D; her for her kindness to you, if for nothing else.&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; Poor Jamie, I often think, is getting but indifferent weather for his harvest: bid him fight away, with the brave good-humour, the cheerful patience we admired so much last year! Austin I suppose will have done<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mrs. Carlyle replied on <date when="1840-10-10">10 Oct.</date> that Jamie&#x2019;s crop was very good and all cut, and Alick reported in his postscript that Austin&#x2019;s crop at the Gill was &#x201C;as well as could have been expected in the present state of the farm&#x201D; and that Jamie&#x2019;s was &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">clean</hi> above an average.&#x201D;</note></p>
<p>I go along reading, reading. My <hi rend="italic">Book</hi> is a very long way off yet, if it come at all. It is to be upon the <hi rend="italic">Puritans,</hi>&#x2014;John Knox&#x2019;s people in <hi rend="italic">this</hi> end of the Island, especially Oliver Cromwell: but who knows whether we shall ever get rightly into the heart of that, or <hi rend="italic">have</hi> any Book to write about it? We shall see by and by&#x2014; Did you notice the little review of Burns in the last Examiner? It was by me. I send my brotherly love to Alick, and to all the rest. I hope to write again before the Box arrive. Good be with you, dear good Mother! <closer><salute>Your affectionate</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Your Letter, which I had begun to long for, came yesterday; I sent it off in a small Note to my Mother, lest perhaps she too, short of intelligence, might have begun to have apprehensions in the late rough weather. I must send you a word today, tho&#x2019; in the worst of all conditions for doing it (the old story, <hi rend="italic">bile</hi> &#x26;c): to wait till Monday might perhaps fling us out of Stirling Post Office, and then we should not know w<supplied>[h]</supplied>ither to address.</p>
<p>This short Letter from my Mother is all the news I have had out of Dumfriesshire. I sent off a Box, chiefly of <hi rend="italic">clothes</hi> new and old, this day by Pickford. Pray do not you neglect to send news of yourself to Scotsbrig. I could like much that you got a glimpse of Scotsbrig in passing, for our poor Mother&#x2019;s sake: but I fear that is very doubtful.</p>
<p>You lead a most nomadic life! If one were in moderately good health, and had a taste for seeing the country (as at least everybody ought to have for seeing his own Country, at least), such an existence would have pleasures and advantages. I recollect nothing farther noteworthy in your present neighbourhood, if it be not the battlefields of Falkirk (Wallace&#x2019;s and the Chevalier&#x2019;s),<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Wallace (<date when="1272-00-00">1272</date>?&#x2013;<date when="1305-00-00">1305</date>) was defeated by Edward I of England in <date when="1298-00-00">1298</date>; and, in <date when="1746-01-00">Jan. 1746</date>, Prince Charles Edward (<date when="1720-00-00">1720</date>&#x2013;<date when="1788-00-00">88</date>), retreating north, inflicted a severe repulse on General Hawley, at South Bantaskyne, SW of the town.</note> Carron Iron-works,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >At Carron, ca. two mi. NW of Falkirk, started in <date when="1760-00-00">1760</date>, where carronades (a kind of naval gun) were first made.</note> Bannockburn<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Nr. Stirling, where Robert Bruce (<date when="1274-00-00">1274</date>&#x2013;<date when="1329-00-00">1329</date>) defeated the army of Edward II of England in <date when="1314-00-00">1314</date> and liberated Scotland.</note> (but probably you have seen all these things); then Montrose&#x2019;s localities would to me be notable: his old manorhouses about Keir &#x26;c, his two battle grounds, Tippermoor (3 miles from Perth), Kilsyth on the other side of you, &#x26;c &#x26;c.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For Montrose, see <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390204-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1839-02-05">5 Feb. 1839</date></ref>. Keir belonged not to Montrose but to Sir George Stirling, m. to Montrose&#x2019;s niece, Margaret Napier, <date when="1637-00-00">1637</date>; and imprisoned with her father, Archibald, Lord Napier, and Montrose in Edinburgh Castle, <date when="1641-00-00">1641</date>. In <date when="1847-00-00">1847</date> the estate was inherited by William Stirling, Sir William Stirling-Maxwell from <date when="1865-00-00">1865</date> (<date when="1818-00-00">1818</date>&#x2013;<date when="1878-00-00">78</date>), later TC&#x2019;s friend. Montrose defeated the Covenanters at Tippermuir (ca. four mi. from Perth), <date when="1644-00-00">1644</date>, and Kilsyth (fifteen mi. SSW of Stirling), <date when="1645-00-00">1645</date>.</note>&#x2014; But the best news of all is that you are coming to Ryde for winter: almost next-door to us, thanks to the railways! We can hope to meet face to face in no great length of time.&#x2014; You did not see Erskine I conjecture, or you would have <pb id="pg-12-273" n="12:273"/>mentioned him. Did you go and look at my old Schoolhouse in Kirkcaldy? The Kirk-Wynd would name itself to you.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC lived in Kirk Wynd, <date when="1816-00-00">1816</date>&#x2013;<date when="1818-00-00">18</date>; Ryde is in the Isle of Wight, ca. seventy-nine mi.

<p>My Reviewer in the Quarterly is understood to be Sewell, an Oxford notability of the Puseyite Sect. He is a very &#x201C;curious specie this by [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>]<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A pencilled note has been written on the letter to say that &#x201C;T.C. overheard a Cockney in Paris Picture gallery remark of a Work of Art &#x2018;d&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;d queer specie &#x26;c.&#x2019;&#x201D;</note>&#x2014;!&#x201D; A well-disposed, not stupid man, who has got it into his head that the Shovel-hat is after all no earthly felt, but a thing that <hi rend="italic">has</hi> descended out of Heaven: I praise him greatly for understanding, as he seems to do, that if it <hi rend="italic">be</hi> a merely earthly felt, it is travelling rapidly to the devil. That he and the like of him are now bringing it resolutely to this crisis seems to me the fatallest phasis poor old Church-of-Englandism has ever exhibited. Let them be doing; let us be doing. Fraser, I suppose, will find his account, as you say, in this Critique:<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sewell&#x2019;s article, though critical, helped to publicize TC&#x2019;s works.</note> it is all right.</p>
<p>Jane en<supplied>[g]</supplied>ages herself in selling my <hi rend="italic">Ms.</hi> Lectures to Fraser! <hi rend="italic">She</hi> can do it better, she thinks.

<salute>Dear Sterling,</salute>
<p>It grieves me to pass with you, even for a moment, as a blabber of secrets. This secret, you may believe it, would have lain long unhinted at by me:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sterling had asked in his letter of <date when="1840-09-18">18 Sept.</date> that nothing be said about his poem &#x201C;The Election.&#x201D;</note> but my Wife usually has leave to read such of my Letters as she likes, unless some express injunction to the contrary exist; and usually, I ought to add, her discretion is sufficient. Nay I find on this occasion she has not yet disclosed your secret, but only disclosed that she knows it,&#x2014;and truly in so incidental and harmless a way as, I think, when once she has explained it, you will be forced to pronounce pardonable. For the rest, your good Mother&#x2019;s temporary vexation is what chiefly grieves me; <hi rend="italic">she</hi>, kind soul, had no call to suffer in the matter: as for the rest of you, you are wrong and you are right, and will settle it as you can!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Have you read my beautiful Sewell of the <hi rend="italic">Quarterly Review?</hi> Did you, in the course of your historical inquiries, ever fall in with any phenomenon adequately comparable to Puseyism? The Church of England stood long upon her Tithes and her Decencies; but now she takes to shouting in the marketplace, &#x201C;My Tithes are nothing, my Decencies are nothing; <hi rend="italic">I</hi> am either miraculous-celestial or else nothing!&#x201D; It is to me the fatallest symptom of speedy <hi rend="italic">change</hi> she ever exhibited. What an alternative: men will soon see whether you are miraculous-celestial or <hi rend="italic">not!</hi> Were a pair of breeches ever known to beget a son?</p>

Suppose now that, before exploding this shower of crackers on my devoted head, you had taken a moment&#x2019;s breath to enquire into the <hi rend="italic">merits of the case,</hi> who knows but you might have saved your crackers for some future emergency, and I might have saved my head? My head, however, is fortunately a tolerably hard one, and, armed with the helmet of Innocence, as at present, it can defy such fire-showers to do it any <hi rend="italic">deadly</hi> hurt. For my own sake as you have already done your worst, it is hardly worth while to vindicate myself; but for the sake of <hi rend="italic">the species</hi>, it may be as well perhaps to make you aware, that the present <foreign><hi rend="italic">contre-temps</hi></foreign> has been produced, rather by an unlucky conjunction of your stars, than by individual female indiscretion.</p>
<p>One day that I dined at Knightsbridge some fortnight back, your Father said to me &#x201C;Where is Cavaignac?&#x201D; &#x201C;In Leeds,&#x201D; I answered. &#x201C;What is he <hi rend="italic">doing</hi> there?&#x201D; says he. &#x201C;What is <hi rend="italic">your</hi> business?&#x201D; says I. Presently thereupon, he told me you had written a poem &#x201C;On what subject?&#x201D; I very naturally enquired: &#x201C;I do not choose to tell you, says he, with a tone of retaliation. &#x201C;Perhaps you do not know,&#x201D; says I. &#x201C;I <hi rend="italic">do</hi> know&#x201D; says he, &#x201C;but I am not at liberty to mention it.&#x201D; There you have scene first. Scene the second occurred on the day your Letter<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1840-09-18">18 Sept.</date></note> came to us. It was on the table when your Father and Mother came to call. There seemed less imprudence in saying my husband had received a letter from you that day, than in making a mystery of so simple a fact. &#x201C;Does he tell you about his Poem? said your Mother. &#x201C;Yes.&#x201D; &#x201C;Has he told you the subject?&#x201D; says she again.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Someone, possibly TC, has added &#x201C;n.b.&#x201D; above the line at the end of this sentence.</note> &#x201C;Yes; but that we were not to speak of it.&#x201D; Now I refer it from M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> John Sterling in a passion, to M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> John Sterling in his sober reason,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. &#x201C;From Philip drunk to Philip sober,&#x201D; <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350203-TC-RWE-01"><sic>8:40</sic><corr>TC to RWE, <date when="1835-02-03">3 Feb. 1835</date></corr></ref>.</note> what else could I, or ought I to have sai<supplied>[d]</supplied> supposing, as I had every reason to do, that your Mother was in the secret? Your Father had known it for a fortnight, and if it were conceivable that <hi rend="italic">he</hi> should have kept it from her so long; was it conceivable <pb id="pg-12-276" n="12:276"/>that you should have placed more confidence in your <hi rend="italic">Father&#x2019;s</hi> discretions, than in your Mother&#x2019;s, your Father being precisely the indiscreetest human being that ever was born! I saw in an instant that something had gone wrong. Your Mother looked exceedingly vexed,&#x2014;and said: &#x201C;He has not chosen that <hi rend="italic">I</hi> should know; but pray don&#x2019;t tell me.&#x201D; Then, of course, I wished that I had had the forethought to hide the <foreign><hi rend="italic">corpus delicti</hi></foreign>, or that I had braved the odium of observing impenetrable silence about it; but &#x201C;a word spoken, eight horses cannot hold it back.&#x201D; And so I tried to laugh her out of her annoyance the best I could. Apparently, I have not succeeded since letters have been written to Clifton, on the subject, and <hi rend="italic">from</hi> Clifton.</p>
<p>What a much ado about nothing,&#x2014;for me, who can scarce give myself the trouble to do <hi rend="italic">a little</hi> about something.</p>

<p><salute>Dearest Mrs. Jameson&#x2014;</salute>I have seen Fraser; have held a most animated debate with him for upwards of an hour; and ended where I began,&#x2014;or rather a little further back than where I began. I stated to him in the modest language of innocence and truth, that I would have &#xa3;150 for my Book or would have back the MS. He on the other hand demonstrated to me by his Bookseller Arithmetic, that no edition of the Book, whether large or small, whether sold at 7s.6d. or at 10s.6d., could under any conceivable human circumstances, yield one farthing more than just &#xa3;150 as the whole amount of profit; so that if this sum were paid to the Author, &#x201C;what,&#x201D; he asked with a look of blank pathos, &#x201C;remained for the Publisher?&#x201D; &#x201C;Plainly nothing,&#x201D; I told him, &#x201C;which I regarded as a clear intimation of Providence that no such character as a Publisher should exist!&#x201D; But still he thinks that he has a right to exist, and will exist, I am afraid; but it shall not be by eating up the best part of this &#xa3;150.</p>
<p>Confused and almost driven to despair by his numerical figures,&#x2014;knowing all the while there was &#x201C;a <hi rend="italic">do</hi> at the bottom of them,&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-08/lt-18360401-JWC-HW-01"><sic>8:330</sic><corr>JWC to HW, <date when="1836-04-01">1 April 1836</date></corr></ref>.</note> tho&#x2019; I, poor Ignorama, could not point it out, I took my stand on <hi rend="italic">your</hi> authority, <hi rend="italic">your</hi> more comprehensible arithmetic, and turned a deaf ear to the voice of the tempter.&#x2014; At last, seeing that I <hi rend="italic">would</hi> swear by my Egeria,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Female adviser: the nymph who advised the early Roman King Numa.</note> let him talk as he would, he offered me to wait upon <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, and &#x201C;make you also sensible, etc.,&#x201D;&#x2014;a proposal which I sanctioned with perhaps a too selfish readiness.</p>
<p>Accordingly he proposes to call upon you on Thursday at twelve <pb id="pg-12-278" n="12:278"/>o&#x2019;clock. Will this visit bore you? If so, say it without hesitation and I will crush it in the bud.</p>
<p>As I <hi rend="italic">know</hi> that the MS. would yield <hi rend="italic">upwards</hi> of &#xa3;150 if cut up into Review Articles, he absolutely is not to have it for less. We can try some other consequence of the Fall of Adam in the shape of Publisher, and if they all prove alike desperate of getting anything out of it, and averse to publishing it for virtue&#x2019;s own reward, why then it can lie there, eating no bread, until some blessed &#x201C;three days&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >1 Sam. 30:12.</note> in Book-sellerdom have brought out a new order of things; or it can get published among his <hi rend="italic">posthumous Works</hi>. &#x2026; Pardon me giving you all this trouble; it is the result of your own rash kindness.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Saunders &#x26; Otley were Anna Jameson&#x2019;s regular publishers. They were to offer only &#xa3;50 for an edn. of 750.</note>&#x2014; Fraser wished me to assist at the interview, but I do not see what I can say to him more than I have already said.</p>
<p>Kind regards to my Lover;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Perhaps Denis Brownell Murphy, her invalid father; see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400317-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1840-03-17">17 March</date></ref>.

<salute>Dear Mill,</salute>
<p>I perused your <hi rend="italic">Tocqueville</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mill&#x2019;s review of Alexis de Tocqueville&#x2019;s completed <hi rend="italic">De la Democratie en Am&#xE9;rique</hi>, 4 vols. (Paris, <date when="1835-00-00">1835</date>&#x2013;<date when="1840-00-00">40</date>), and of Henry Reeve&#x2019;s trans., <hi rend="italic">Democracy in America,</hi> 4 vols. (London, <date when="1835-00-00">1835</date>&#x2013;<date when="1840-00-00">40</date>), in <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review</hi> 72 (<date when="1840-10-00">Oct. 1840</date>): 1&#x2013;47. He had earlier reviewed the first pt. in <hi rend="italic">London Review</hi> 2 (<date when="1835-10-00">Oct. 1835</date>): 85&#x2013;129; see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350615-TC-JAC-01"><sic>8:150</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1835-06-15">15 june 1835</date></corr></ref>. Mill wrote to Tocqueville about the book, <date when="1840-05-11">11 May</date> (Mineka 13:434).</note> last night, with great satisfaction. It is a pleasure to see anything so well stated, in such lucid sequence and completeness, the pen so effectually performing what it undertakes to do. Tocqueville, I think, suits you a little better than he did me; tho&#x2019; I honour him too after his kind. Your objections to him are precisely to the same effect as mine, but luckily they do not run so deep as mine,&#x2014;almost into the very heart, I fear! The Book will do much good, and your Article much.</p>
<p>And now when will you write of the <hi rend="italic">New Aristocracy</hi> we have to <pb id="pg-12-279" n="12:279"/>look for? That seems to me the question; all Democracy a mere transitionary preparation for that. You hint pertinently at it in concluding; but had no room there to do more.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mill concluded: &#x201C;It is a chimerical hope to overbear or outnumber the middle class. &#x2026; The ascendancy of the commercial class in modern society and politics is inevitable, and, under due limitations, ought not to be regarded as an evil. &#x2026; But it needs not therefore be all-powerful. Now, as ever, the great problem in government is to prevent the strongest from becoming the only power. &#x2026; Any counter-balancing power can henceforth exist only by the sufferance of the commercial class; but that it should tolerate some such limitation, we deem as important as that it should not itself be held in vassalage&#x201D; (72:47).</note> I should really like to hear you on <hi rend="italic">the Sequel;</hi> you and all wise men.</p>
<p>My friend Sewell of the <hi rend="italic">Quarterly</hi> is what the Germans call <foreign><hi rend="italic">ein Sonderbarer</hi></foreign> [strangely singular] <hi rend="italic">Christ;</hi> his &#x201C;thirty-nine glasses&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >I.e., the thirty-nine articles to which those taking orders in the Church of England had to subscribe. For an earlier response to them by TC, see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350604-JWC-JOST-01"><sic>8:139&#x2013;40</sic><corr>JWC to JOST, <date when="1835-06-04">4 June 1835</date></corr></ref>.</note> lift him above comparison with Men or Formulas. In all History, I think, Puseyism seeks its fellow! The poor old shovel-hat beginning, at this hour of the day, to assert from the housetops, &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">I</hi> either came out of Heaven and am a godlike miracle and mystery, or <hi rend="italic">else</hi> an importunate old felt, demanding to be flung to the beggars!&#x201D; It is the fatallest alternative I ever heard of for the Church of England.</p>
<p>A huge hamper of Cromwell Books arrived yesterday;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >From Forster. See <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400928-TC-JF-01">TC to JF, [<date when="1840-09-28">28 Sept.</date>]</ref>.</note> frightful to look upon. I am for coming up one of these nights to see what you have in that sort. One learns almost nothing; yet one has to read,&#x2014;it keeps one&#x2019;s own mind fixed vehemently on the thing; really that is the chief use of it!</p>
<p><closer><salute>Yours ever truly /</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name><note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Two of Mill&#x2019;s letters about this time contain assessments of TC&#x2019;s style and influence. &#x201C;Art needs earnest but quiet times&#x2014;in ours I am afraid that Art itself to be powerful must be polemical&#x2014;Carlylean not Goethean&#x201D; (to John Sterling, <date when="1840-10-01">1 Oct.</date>, Mineka 13:446). &#x201C;The &#x2018;Genius&#x2019; paper [6:239] is no favorite with me. &#x2026; It was written in the height of my Carlylism, a vice of style which I have since carefully striven to correct. &#x2026; I think Carlyle&#x2019;s costume should be left to Carlyle whom alone it comes &#x26; in whom it would soon become unpleasant if it were made common&#x2014;&#x26; I have seen &#x2026; grievous symptoms of its being taken up by the lowest of the low&#x201D; (to G.

<p><salute>Dear Jenny,&#x2014;</salute> Will you take a word from me to-day in place of many hundreds which I wish I had the means of sending you? My <pb id="pg-12-280" n="12:280"/>time is very limited indeed, but the sight of my handwriting may be a kind of enlivener to your kind thoughts about me. My dear Mother tells me you are afraid sometimes I may have forgotten you. Believe that never, my dear little sister, it will forever be an error if you do! The whirl I am kept in here is a thing you can form no notion of, nor how natural or indeed inevitable it is for me to give up writing letters at all except when I am bound and obliged to do it. You have no lack of <hi rend="italic">news</hi> from me; to my Mother at least I send abundant details. Did I not <hi rend="italic">answer</hi> your letter too? I surely meant and ought to have done it. If at any time you wanted the smallest thing that I could do for you, and wrote about, I should be busier than I have ever yet been, if I did not answer.&#x2014; In short, dear Jenny, whatever sins I may have, whatever <hi rend="italic">more</hi> I may seem to have, try to think handsomely of them, to forgive them. And above all things, consider that whether I write many letters or few, my affection for you is a thing that will never leave me.</p>
<p>My Mother tells me frequently how good you are to her; what a satisfaction it is that you are so near her. I thank you a hundred times for your goodness to her; but I know you do not need my thanks or encouragement&#x2014;and to me it is a real comfort to reflect that you, with your true heart and helpful hand, are always so near. Surely it is a duty for us all, and a blessing in the doing of it, to take care of our Mother, and promote her comfort by all means possible to us! I will love you better and better for this.</p>
<p>You would see by my Mother&#x2019;s last letter, where the Doctor is at present. I have heard nothing since I had a Newspaper from Dumfries, the other day, no letters. I mentioned that the box for Scotsbrig was to <hi rend="italic">be</hi> sent off; it <hi rend="italic">went</hi> accordingly and is now on the way to Liverpool, likely to be with you soon. There is a small parcel in it for you. We rejoice to hear that Robert prospers in his business: it is difficult to prosper in any business at present. A man of industry, sobriety, and steadiness of purpose; such a man has a chance if anybody have. Jane is certainly in better health this year than I have seen her for a good while. We wait to see what she will say to the <hi rend="italic">cold weather!</hi> I myself am as well as usual; no great shakes of a <hi rend="italic">wellness</hi> at any time. I expect to be busy, <hi rend="italic">very busy</hi> this winter, which is the best consolation for all things. How I should like to hear of Jamie&#x2019;s harvest being all <hi rend="italic">thatched!</hi> My love to my Mother, to Alick and all the rest. Jane unites with me in special remembrances to Robert and the <foreign><hi rend="italic">glegg</hi></foreign> [bright] little <foreign>lassie</foreign>.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Margaret Aitken Carlyle Hanning, b. <date when="1838-09-00">Sept. 1838</date>.</note></p>

<p><salute>My dear Sir&#x2014;</salute> I am very glad to hear of you again, and hear nothing but good. Occasionally some trace of you turns up in the <hi rend="italic">Anti-Corn-Law Circular,</hi> which they send me hither; but otherwise, for a longer time than usual, I have had to fancy what you were about. By the bye, who writes that <hi rend="italic">Anti-Corn-Law Circular?</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390913-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1839-09-13">13 Sept. 1839</date></ref>. Cobden and John Bright wrote many of the leading articles: &#x201C;broad and mighty statements of the newest aspects of their case&#x201D; (John Morley, <hi rend="italic">The Life of Richard Cobden</hi> [London, <date when="1881-00-00">1881</date>] 1:212).</note> He is a man of some emphasis; apt to get a little boisterous at times; but zealous, thoroughly in earnest, likely to be useful. I know not what progress the cause makes. It seems to me many things between the Middle and Lower Classes will have to be adjusted before there can be any right settlement there. And who knows but the blind landlords, at their own extreme peril, are doing a <hi rend="italic">good service</hi> by <hi rend="italic">delaying</hi> the Corn-Law settlement till much else be once a little better settled? Small thanks to <hi rend="italic">them</hi> for that! But all things do, in some sort, work together for good.</p>
<p>My Critic in the <hi rend="italic">Quarterly</hi> is understood to be an Oxford Doctor of the name of Sewell, a notability and leading Puseyite there. I have known the man from afar for some years; and wondered, as he reciprocally does, to find how lovingly in many directions he and I went along together, always till we arrived at the conclusion, and how <hi rend="italic">there</hi> we whirled round to the right and to the left about, and walked off like imcompatibles, mutually destructives, like fire walking off from water! I do not like the Puseyites so ill as you do; in fact, though I think them as mad as anybody does, I might say I rather like them well. They have many good ideas, genuinely true, and sadly forgotten in our times; and the practical application they make of all these seems so entirely distracted as to be altogether harmless, and incapable of injuring anything except the Church of England itself,&#x2014;for <hi rend="italic">which</hi> institution, indeed, they really appear to me to be the fatallest symptom that it has ever yet exhibited. In one sense or other, it is true and must be forever true, that this world is a God&#x2019;s world, and must be governed as a &#x201C;Church,&#x201D; or else ill-governed, anarchic, wretched. Too many cannot be convinced of this, all ought to be convinced of it. And then, as the next step, when the Puseyites come forward and say, Behold are not <hi rend="italic">we the Church;</hi> is not Heaven&#x2019;s thaumaturgy with <hi rend="italic">us,</hi> dwelling here under this Shovel-hat?&#x2014;the world will naturally answer, Let us see it, then; <hi rend="italic">work</hi> miracles with it; or <hi rend="italic">else,</hi> working none, go to perdition <pb id="pg-12-282" n="12:282"/>with it! I think that crisis is rapidly drawing on. The Puseyites will contribute their share of good; the Benthamees and they may well neutralize each other, and give us some solid result, the madness of each party being left as <foreign><hi rend="italic">caput mortuum</hi></foreign> [death&#x2019;s head] there!</p>
<p>My reviewer in the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh</hi> seemed to me of a much more detestable school than these poor Quarterlies. He writes down this doctrine, That <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;hunger&#x201D;</hi> is perennial, irremediable among the lower classes of men, here, everywhere and at all times,&#x2014;the horse that will work is fed and lodged, but the man cannot be so; and all &#x201C;liberal government,&#x201D; what does it mean but a joining together of those who have some money to keep those who have none quiet&#x2014;in their hunger? The pigs have all to die, <hi rend="italic">no</hi> help for that; but by God&#x2019;s blessing we will keep down their <hi rend="italic">squealing!</hi> It struck me I had never seen in writing so entirely damnable a statement; though it is what all manner of Whigs and Benthamee Radicals, and other Atheistic men (as our Pusey friends would call them) do constantly act upon without writing it.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mill had just written to Sterling that &#x201C;Merivale&#x2019;s article has many sound criticisms, as much of appreciation as you can expect from an Edinburgh reviewer, &#x26; a few damnable heresies. Carlyle&#x2019;s dislike of it seems to me excessive, &#x26; nothing that he says surprises me more than that he should think that Macaulay would have done it better. Macaulay would not have had half as much appreciation of him&#x201D; (<date when="1840-10-01">1 Oct.</date>, Mineka 13:446).</note> Good never came from such people. It is to me not a sorrowful prognostic that the day of that class of politicians does in all ways draw towards its close.</p>
<p>You ask me for liberal political philosophers among the Germans. I rather think none of the great Germans have ever gone much upon political <hi rend="italic">philosophies;</hi> I fancy even, they did not care much for that sort of produce. The great political philosophy is that every man be a real man, not an imaginary one; he will then whether as Tory politician or as Radical one say and do something useful! Richter and Fichte were resolute Liberals (as we should say); Fichte even a loud one: whom many others, but not of great mark, have followed. The present race, of which I know but little, seemed to be of small moment; <foreign>Sansculottists</foreign>, Ballot-boxists, etc., etc. I suspect no help lies there for us in this matter,&#x2014;except indeed as help does lie for the sick paralysis of man&#x2019;s soul in this epoch, and therefore help for all matters that man has to do with.</p>
<p>My pen to-day is obliged to go as for the King&#x2019;s Hundred.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unexplained.</note> I suspect small light can lie in these words of mine to guide your inquiries; but rather darkness visible. Nevertheless I do mean what I write; and <pb id="pg-12-283" n="12:283"/>perhaps to make it all out and put it all together will be no useless exercise for your own thoughts.</p>
<p>It was a great pity you had not been a day earlier last year! We hope you will come again, when the time serves us better.&#x2014; I have hardly been out of Town this year at all. I have been writing down my Lectures of last Summer; I know not whether I shall print them. I have an immense stock of reading about English Puritanism and Oliver Cromwell, laid out for the Winter. Till <hi rend="italic">we</hi> become Believers and Puritans in our way, no result will be arrived at!&#x2014; <closer><salute>Believe me, my dear sir,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I hasten to fire off half a word at you, now that I know whither to aim. The thought that you have come and are still coming nearer is very agreeable to the fancy; tho&#x2019; I regret much that you had not been able to run off for a single day to let my Mother see you. It is perhaps at bottom &#x201C;just as well&#x201D;!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >An expression of John&#x2019;s.</note> At all events, it cannot be helped. Our Mother will be very sorry; but we could do nothing for her this year, the good Mother. Indeed she is so feeble now, I sometimes think the flurry of a visit from us does her ill as well as good. Ah me!</p>
<p>Not a syllable of news has reached me from the Homeland since you last heard: weekly <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi> announcing that nothing is wrong; this, with two Newspapers for <hi rend="italic">you,</hi> in James Aitken&#x2019;s hand, is all.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC had not yet received his mother&#x2019;s and Alexander&#x2019;s letter of <date when="1840-10-10">10 Oct.</date></note> One of the latter I directly forwarded to Stirling, where probably it still lies; the other (also a <hi rend="italic">Herald</hi>), which has arrived just now, I despatch to Bangor. You get also today a <hi rend="italic">Tablet,</hi> the new Catholic Newspaper which they forward always to me,&#x2014;I <hi rend="italic">skipping</hi> dextrously <hi rend="italic">all</hi> their Catholicities, a thing infinitely wearisome to me: this N<hi rend="italic">o</hi> contains some notice, which was new to me on Saturday night, of a hurlyburly the Radical Editors have been making over Sewell my Quarterly Reviewer.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Tablet,</hi> <date when="1840-10-10">10 Oct.</date> (&#x201C;Mr. Carlyle and the <hi rend="italic">Quarterly Review</hi>&#x201D;), had just commented on Sewell&#x2019;s &#x201C;splendid essay&#x201D; and its reception by the <hi rend="italic">Morning Chronicle,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Globe</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Sun</hi>. It began by satirizing the confusion of these three leading liberal journals when first faced by TC, &#x201C;like dogs put &#x2026; upon the scent of some strange beast.&#x201D; Sewell had admitted TC&#x2019;s merits &#x201C;with the greatest frankness and cordiality&#x201D; and then discussed what he saw as his errors; but the liberal reviewers had fallen on Sewell &#x201C;open-mouthed, with a mixture of savage ferocity and blundering stupidity which we have rarely seen equalled.&#x201D; As for TC, the <hi rend="italic">Tablet</hi> assumed that he must have been amused by the whole affair.</note> You can forward it to Jean at Dumfries when you have done with it.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-12-285" n="12:285"/>We are <hi rend="italic">flitting</hi> [moving] today, in the very act of shifting upstairs. My desk now, and self at present, are in your old quarters the front room below;&#x2014;pasting of the door &#x26;c is still to <hi rend="italic">do;</hi> and I hear Jane&#x2019;s hammer diligently going overhead. It makes me <foreign>wae</foreign> to look at the suddenly contracted room, and think of you and last winter! <foreign><hi rend="italic">Es konnte nimmer seyn</hi></foreign> [It can never be]! But what is all the <hi rend="italic">Past</hi> but &#x201C;a burial-aisle&#x201D;?&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; They have brought down the <hi rend="italic">Bookpress</hi> from the upper story<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;First-floor&#x201D; is written above &#x201C;upper story.&#x201D; For TC&#x2019;s earlier use of the downstairs room, see <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380121-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1838-01-21">21 Jan.</date></ref>, and <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380215-TC-MAC-01"><date when="1838-02-15">15 Feb. 1838</date></ref>.</note> (the mahogany press you remember), and set into the <hi rend="italic">recess</hi> between mantelpiece and front wall where it fits very well, to hold <hi rend="italic">my</hi> special Books, with which I am very busy. I have borrowed a huge stock, <hi rend="italic">Rushworths, Whitlocke&#x2019;s</hi> &#x26;c &#x26;c from one Forster, all about Puritanism and Cromwell; I am even buying a few. My work thro&#x2019; winter is to be studying and re-studying that business: <hi rend="italic">if</hi> I get any direct clear insight I will write about it; if not, not. Meanwhile the search, tho&#x2019; amid mountains of shot rubbish, gets more and more entertaining. I have bought a capital Atlas of England that of <hi rend="italic">Walker;</hi> you had some of the county-maps, last year, on your travels:<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400801-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1840-08-01">1 Aug.</date></ref></note> I wanted a Scotch Atlas, but despair of getting any good one for a while.&#x2014; My poor inner man is and continues wofully bilious; otherwise I complain of nothing, and feel much quieter than I once did.</p>
<p>Cavaignac is gone to France, perhaps thence to Algiers, several weeks ago; we had seen little of him for the last six months; he seemed to have some <hi rend="italic">trade</hi>-speculation in hand, and perhaps did not care to let us know of it. His manner of departing finally was by what they call &#x201C;French leave,&#x201D; a cold scrawl of a Note sent hither some days <hi rend="italic">after</hi> he was gone. I never distinctly saw the force of that phrase before; which Mazzini informs me is Italian too: I suppose it must lie in the French blood, that habit.</p>
<p>Mill is in some distress about his Young Brother, a fine modest wise boy of 15, who looks only 12; whom Clarke has ordered him to send to Devonshire for a bad cough that will not go away. Mill knows nobody at Torquay;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Grote Mill (ca. <date when="1825-00-00">1825</date>&#x2013;<date when="1853-00-00">53</date>), the youngest brother.

He stayed at Torquay until ca. <date when="1841-05-00">May 1841</date>.</note> was thinking of this and of that: I told him, or rather sent word to him, that <hi rend="italic">you</hi> were going to Wight or that region: I have no doubt you would keep an eye upon the poor lad, if he were boarded any where within your reach? Till Mill speak in return, if at all, you need not mind it. Perhaps the <hi rend="italic">place</hi> itself will not do. Mill will ask nothing unreasonable; and he and his Brother are worth obliging.&#x2014; <pb id="pg-12-286" n="12:286"/>By what path do you come southward? Over the top of Snowdon and Pendennis, by Chepstow Castle and the banks of the Wye? Write frequently. Be well and happy.</p>

<p>Your Letter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> from Woodside indicated that you were to be at Bangor for a week; I wrote, if not by that same post, yet by the next, namely Monday&#x2019;s; and that Note of mine, with two Newspapers, must now be lying at the Post-Office of Bangor, unless you have arranged means for having your Letters forwarded. It contained nothing of the smallest moment, that Note, tho&#x2019; it was a longer one than the present; general assurances of our welfare &#x26;c: one of the Newspapers had come addressed to you by James Aitken, a <hi rend="italic">Dumfries Herald</hi>.

<p><pb id="pg-12-287" n="12:287"/>I am busy with Rushworths, with Parliamentary Histories, with Puritanisms and Cromwelleana. I see a long course of reading and inquiry before me: what will come of it we shall not prophecy as yet.</p>

<p>If you <hi rend="italic">had</hi> come last Wednesday!

Not a morsel of victual was cooked in the house that day: my Husband had to seek his dinner at a Tavern, and I&#x2014;oh think of it&#x2014;I had to glide stealthily to the nearest cook-shop and buy myself all-blushing a few ounces of cold beef!! And if you would know the meaning of all which questionable phenomena; it was, in plain prose, that my maid&#x2014;my only Help was thro&#x2019;out that whole day, and part of next, lying <hi rend="italic">dead drunk</hi> on the kitchen floor, amidst a chaos of upset chairs, broken crockery, and heaven knows what besides, &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">fragmenta</hi> rerum non bene puncturam</foreign> [fragments of things not well broken up]&#x201D;&#x2014;in fact the sunk-story of this <hi rend="italic">respectable</hi> aesthetic house was by one of those sudden yawnings of &#x201C;the universal volcanic gulf underneath our feet,&#x201D; converted into a lively epitome of St Giles&#x2019;s<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Notorious district in London in the parish of St. Giles, especially before the building of New Oxford St. (<date when="1843-00-00">1843</date>).</note> or, to speak more accurately, of a <hi rend="italic">place</hi> one may not name.</p>
<p>Now the poor little <foreign><hi rend="italic">Disgraziata</hi></foreign> [disgraced female] is on her legs again&#x2014;for a time&#x2014;and I embrace the favourable moment to ship her off to Scotland where she will at least get drunk on <hi rend="italic">genuine</hi> whisky instead of blue ruin&#x2014; So <hi rend="italic">next</hi> Wednesday, God willing you will find us all <hi rend="italic">sober</hi> and most glad to see you.</p>

A fourth authority, who meant to testify that such a quantity was inadequate as proof, arrived too late. She was condemned to life imprisonment with hard labor.

<salute>Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>This Letter has just arrived, and goes off without any delay. I have a Note from Jean too, but it is mostly about <hi rend="italic">straw bonnets:</hi> perhaps I may as well inclose it.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Neither letter has been found, and the writer of the first, the &#x201C;foreign one&#x201D; mentioned in <ref target="volume-12/lt-18401016-TC-JCA-01">TC to JCA, <date when="1840-10-16">16 Oct.</date></ref>, has not been identified.</note></p>
<p><pb id="pg-12-289" n="12:289"/>We are in considerable confusion of household; Jane with a tendency to &#x201C;cramp in the stomach,&#x201D; produced by want of sleep, by fret and fry; our unfortunate <hi rend="italic">Tick</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Helen Mitchell.</note> appointed to depart on Monday, a foolish stalking Kirkaldy joiner encumbering the house, whom I have to restrain myself from flinging out head foremost; a dinner to be transacted at the Wilsons&#x2019;,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jane and Thomas, this evening.</note> &#x26;c, &#x26;c, &#x26;c.

<salute>My dear Sister,</salute>
<p>Thanks for your Letter; it is the only one I have had from the Homeland for a good many weeks. Being in haste, and having no paper quite at hand but this fraction, I will answer by a still shorter. Your Letter is already folded up for Jack, for whom another <hi rend="italic">foreign</hi> one had arrived this morning: he is now gone from Bangor in Wales to Beaumaris a Town in the Island of Anglesey few miles off that; there they have a house, he says, &#x201C;2. Victoria Terrace,&#x201D; and mean to continue &#x201C;a few days.&#x201D; No rest for the wicked,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Isa. 48:22.</note>&#x2014;nor for some others not altogether wicked! I am glad to hear of his gift to the Sisterhood; a right proper thing.</p>
<p>Poor Miss Grahame&#x2019;s straw hat is almost an affecting thing. Tell her that the offer itself gives me great pleasure; but that she owes me no gratitude, I rather owe <hi rend="italic">her</hi> gratitude,&#x2014;for being a good industrious ingenious girl, <hi rend="italic">capable</hi> of being aided in so easy a way. She must persist in her manufacture, and extend it; she does the country-side credit.&#x2014; I am not allowed to wear straw hats here; the Cockney &#x201C;force of public opinion,&#x201D; gazing at one with astonishment on the streets, renders it more advisable to submit patiently to the absurdest monster <pb id="pg-12-290" n="12:290"/>of a <hi rend="italic">felt</hi>. I tried the straw four years ago (a hat of her plaiting, which I used to wear in Edinburgh);<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably the grown-up da. of Janet (or Mary) Graham of Myer, nr. Hoddam, helped by TC in <date when="1827-11-00">Nov. 1827</date>; see <ref target="volume-04/lt-18271100-TC-ANM-01"><sic>4:286&#x2013;87</sic><corr>TC to ANM, <date when="1827-11-28">28 Nov. 1827</date></corr></ref>. For TC&#x2019;s previous hat plaited by Mrs. Graham, see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18320731-TC-MAC-01"><sic>6:199</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1832-07-31">31 July 1832</date></corr></ref>.</note> but found it would not do.</p>
<p>Not to mortify the young artist, however, as you say a refusal would do, I am to submit that Jane will most cheerfully accept a bonnet, and wear it for the sake of the maker; a thing truly not difficult to do. She pronounces the plait to be original, eminently beautiful, and calculated to succeed here among dealers in that article. Miss Graham should get apprentices, make arrangements &#x26;c! Meanwhile, for Jane&#x2019;s individual bonnet, this is to be the way of it:</p>
<p>Inclosed is the species of plait which she prefers;&#x2014;point <hi rend="italic">first</hi>. The second point is, that the bonnet must not be <hi rend="italic">made</hi>, that is, shaped or sewed; let a due quantity of plait be provided, wrapt up in paper; and sent off along with a Provision-box or barrel they are now in the act of getting ready at Scotsbrig: it will travel in the handsomest way along with that; and the bonnet-maker here can put it in the true perfection of fashionable shape;&#x2014;this is point <hi rend="italic">second</hi>. And now (point <hi rend="italic">third</hi> and last), lest the London sewers, as they are like to do, mistake the plan of <hi rend="italic">sewing</hi> the plait, Miss G. is to sew two pieces together as an intelligible effectual specimen; and putting this in with the rest, the whole matter seems to me to stand clear and square;&#x2014;and we shall <hi rend="italic">see</hi> what comes of it!</p>
<p>Jane is not well at present: she has been flurried all to pieces by the little Dottle [small drunkard] of a Maid-Servant who has fallen into distraction of <hi rend="italic">Gin</hi> itself, within the last week; and, after three years of most useful service otherwise, is to be</p>

<p><salute><hi rend="small-caps">My Dear Aird</hi>,&#x2014;</salute>Yesterday a <hi rend="italic">Herald</hi> reached me with one Article in it which I did not fail to notice!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A review of <hi rend="italic">The French Revolution, Dumfries Herald</hi>, <date when="1840-10-15">15 Oct.</date>, signed &#x201C;Apollodorus&#x201D;; not by Aird but George Gilfillan; see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18401029-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1840-10-29">29 Oct.</date></ref></note> It is not, in general, seemly or convenient that the reviewed make any answer to his reviewer; but the <pb id="pg-12-291" n="12:291"/>present is a case worthy beyond most of forming an exception to such a rule.</p>
<p>You <hi rend="italic">will</hi> not laugh at me when I tell you that I read the Paper with very great pleasure. It is a noble panegyric; a picture painted by a Poet, which means with me a man of Insight and Heart&#x2014;decisive, sharp of outline, in hues borrowed from the sun! I find an enormous <hi rend="italic">exaggeration</hi> of all features; but the <hi rend="italic">resemblance</hi>, so far as I may judge, is altogether good. It is rare indeed to find oneself mirrored so in a brother-soul; and one of the truest pleasures when by a happy chance it does offer itself. Not many things have ever been written about me in which I could see my own image with so many features that I knew to be mine. Reviews for most part have next to no resemblance, the reviewers being blockheads; in that case, whether they are loud with censure or loud with eulogy goes for absolutely nothing; one has to hand them aside, like a letter misdirected; they do one neither ill nor good. This present is an altogether different business!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For a description of the review, see J. M. Sloan, <hi rend="italic">The Carlyle Country</hi> (London, <date when="1904-00-00">1904</date>) 266&#x2013;67.</note></p>
<p>For the rest, it is really a truth, one never knows whether praise be good for one; whether it be not, in very fact, the worst <hi rend="italic">poison</hi> that could be administered. Blame, or even vituperation, I have always found a safer article. In the long run a man has and <hi rend="italic">is</hi>, just what <hi rend="italic">he</hi> is and has,&#x2014;the world&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">notion of him</hi> has not altered him at all. Except, indeed, if it have poisoned him with self-conceit, and made a <foreign><hi rend="italic">caput-mortuum</hi></foreign> [death&#x2019;s head] of him!&#x2014; I will not thank you for so much praise; but I will right heartily for being a brave, true-hearted man and loving me so well; this is an entirely lawful pleasure. That a craftsman recognise so generously his fellow-craftsman, and his work, seems to me, even were I not the object of it, a most brave thing.</p>
<p>You spoke rightly of my Edinburgh Reviewer; a dry, sceptical, mechanical lawyer (one Merivale, I hear), with his satchell of Dictionaries dangling at his back&#x2014;with the heart of him torpid or dead, and the head of him consequently not alive. His notion of Robespierre&#x2019;s &#x201C;religion&#x201D; struck me, as it does you, the product of a heart <hi rend="italic">dead</hi>. Kill the heart rightly, no head then knows rightly <hi rend="italic">what</hi> to believe; has then any right sense of true and false left in it! His notion of Dumouriez&#x2019;s campaign, taken up in this place, at this time of day is enormous&#x2014;little inferior to R.&#x2019;s religion itself. But it does not equal a third thing which I found in that article, which I wonder no Iconoclast, radical or other took note of; this namely: that &#x201C;hunger&#x201D; is universal, perennial, and irremediable among the lower classes of society&#x2014;unknown only among the horses and domestic animals; that enlightened liberal government <pb id="pg-12-292" n="12:292"/>means a judicious combining of those who are not hungry to suppress those who are, and lock them up from revolting! &#x201C;The pigs are to die, no conceivable help for that; but we, by God&#x2019;s blessing, will at least keep down their squealing!&#x201D; It struck me as the most infernal proposition, written down in that cold way, I had ever had presented to me in human language&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">un</hi>attended with its fit corollary, the duty of &#x201C;universal simultaneous suicide,&#x201D; and a giving up of this God&#x2019;s creation on the part of Adam&#x2019;s race as a bad job!</p>
<p>I did not <supplied>[visit]</supplied> Scotland this summer; and I got nowhither, except for one short week down into Sussex. I trust always I shall be able to get away altogether some day. The sight of a silent green field with the great silent sky over it: ah me, why should it be denied to any mortal man?</p>
<p>My wife is in general better this year than usual; though complaining a little these two days. She sends many kind remembrances <supplied>[She wants]</supplied> to clip out the Article and preserve it among her valuables. &#x201C;An excessively clever thing!&#x201D;</p>
<p><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Aird. My pen is bad, my paper and time are both done to-day. Live happy, busy; remembering us now and then!</p>

<salute>Dear Jack,</salute>
<p>Here is a Letter from my Mother,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1840-10-10">10 Oct.</date>, with postscript from Alexander Carlyle.</note> just arrived; here are two Newspapers, <hi rend="italic">Tablet</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Herald</hi>,&#x2014;in the latter of which you will find a very striking article, by Aird, which when you have read it you can forward to my Mother; it will be gratifying to her at Scotsbrig. The <hi rend="italic">Tablet</hi> can go to Jean, as before. I heard from Jean the other day:&#x2014;or did I not send you the Letter itself!&#x2014; Your own last Letter arrived here on Saturday night.</p>
<p>Our little <hi rend="italic">Tick</hi>, after all was arranged for her departure which was to be this morning by Hull, is to <hi rend="italic">stay</hi>, and try it again! She looked so brokenhearted, spoke almost nothing, comported herself so like a <hi rend="italic">penitent</hi> clinging to the last plank in total and final shipwreck, &#x26;c &#x26;c, that Jane, last night, agreed to dismiss the new <hi rend="italic">charwoman</hi>, and try her again for one month. I do not object. Servants of all kinds, especially new servants, are a misery to me. I vow often I would rather serve <pb id="pg-12-293" n="12:293"/>myself,&#x2014;in all except cleaning of grates and shoes. B<supplied>[r]</supplied>ief, the house is in order again <foreign><hi rend="italic">taliter qualiter</hi></foreign> [such as it is]. I calculate, this little body may last for a few months longer. <hi rend="italic">Three</hi> falls, and <hi rend="italic">then</hi> she rises no more. If she hold out six months, she will excel my expectation. But there is a possibility: let her have the benefit of it.</p>
<p>Lothian&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Atlas</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Either the <hi rend="italic">Historical Atlas of Scotland</hi> (<date when="1829-00-00">1829</date>) or the <hi rend="italic">Atlas of Modern Scotland</hi> (3d edn., <date when="1838-00-00">1838</date>), both pbd. by John Lothian. John had presumably suggested Lothian as a possibility after TC mentioned needing a &#x201C;Scotch atlas&#x201D; on <date when="1840-10-12">12 Oct.</date></note> is easily procured here; but it seemed to me worth little. I will examine again.&#x2014; I read and note what I can; terribly interrupted. I will send note of you to Mill. Not a word more today.&#x2014; Jane is sadly shaken by her last week&#x2019;s work; fallen into sleeplessness again; fretted all to pieces. We must be as quiet as may be.</p>
<p>Jeffrey was here yesterday; I out. He returns towards Scotland today. I saw him when he called first, some three weeks ago: a very loquacious, rather watery, but brisk and cheerful old man.</p>
<p>Gordon, the goose, invited me some time ago to become candidate for the &#x201C;Rhetoric Chair&#x201D; in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, vacant by Moir&#x2019;s resignation.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For John Gordon, general sec. of Edinburgh Univ., since <date when="1833-00-00">1833</date>, see <ref target="volume-04/lt-18270329-TC-AC-01"><sic>4:201</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1827-03-29">29 March 1827</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-06/lt-18320528-TC-MN-01"><sic>6:168</sic><corr>TC to MN, <date when="1832-05-28">28 May 1832</date></corr></ref>; for TC&#x2019;s previous consideration of this chair in <date when="1834-00-00">1834</date> when Andrew Brown&#x2019;s tenure was coming to an end, see <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340121-TC-JAC-01"><sic>7:80</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1834-01-21">21 Jan. 1834</date></corr></ref>; George Moir (<ref target="volume-04/lt-18280418-TC-G-01"><sic>4:365</sic><corr>TC to G, <date when="1828-04-18">18 April 1828</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400316-TC-SWH-01">TC to WH, <date when="1840-03-16">16 March</date></ref>) had been his successor, in <date when="1835-00-00">1835</date>, and was followed by William Spalding (<date when="1809-00-00">1809</date>&#x2013;<date when="1859-00-00">59</date>), elected <date when="1840-11-02">2 Nov.</date> (resigned <date when="1845-00-00">1845</date>) through Jeffrey&#x2019;s interest.</note> I answered, <foreign><hi rend="italic">Ganz und gar nein</hi></foreign> [Completely and absolutely no].</p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Take a short word from me rather than none. Your dear little Letter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1840-10-10">10 Oct.</date>; pbd. A. Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">NL</hi> 1:217&#x2013;18. She ended, &#x201C;I could like a letter every day.&#x201D;</note> has just arrived here; many thanks for it! Not one of them writes a more compact little epistle than you do, when once you have your implements about you. I am much obliged always by the pains you take; for it requires energy in you to take to writing: your writing-materials do not, like mine, stand always on a table, ready for seizing!&#x2014; The poor Box, I calculate, may be jumbling along, down Butcherbeck Brae about this hour, slowly arriving at Scotsbrig. Then you will have <pb id="pg-12-294" n="12:294"/>an opening of them, and a sorting of the old duds! One thing only I advise: that you <hi rend="italic">do</hi> despatch them instantly about their business, and not keep the house lumbered with them.</p>
<p>In Jamie&#x2019;s Letter<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found; nor is the letter from John that arrived on Sat., <date when="1840-10-17">17 Oct.</date></note> I talked of the household tribulation we were in; owing to the accursed power of <hi rend="italic">drink</hi> over our little <hi rend="italic">Teetotum</hi> of a maid-servant. All was arranged for her having to go this morning at ten. The poor creature, however, looked so entirely broken-down with woe, hopeless, silent, without any <hi rend="italic">tears</hi>, <hi rend="italic">a</hi>lmost without any words, that Jane, after serious consideration, determined to try her yet one other time. It seems to me there is still a possibility, tho&#x2019; the probability is small. She <hi rend="italic">may</hi> last us a few months; she may save her own little soul and body: let her have a fair <hi rend="italic">third</hi> chance! We have never had so &#x201C;comfortable a bit useful creature&#x201D; about the house. Cheerful as a cricket, handy, quiet, easily supported and dealt with: all <hi rend="italic">right</hi>, if it were not that unhallowed malison! It makes one shudder at oneself to see what precipices lie close at the footsteps of us all. Let him that standeth thank God for it.&#x2014; On the whole, however, the practical fact is that our establishment is once more <hi rend="italic">tranquil</hi>, and I once more at my work: a most comfortable fact. Poor Jane has got herself terribly shattered by this week&#x2019;s tumult; must now try to <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi>, and rally again. She will write you a Letter before long, she hopes, with all manner of news in it.</p>
<p>There is a brave Article upon me by <hi rend="italic">Aird</hi> in the <hi rend="italic">Dumfries Herald</hi> of last week: Jack will forward it when he has done with it. A really clever Article; and does not want for extravagant <hi rend="italic">praise</hi> at least.

He had been blamed for wanting to &#x201C;re-establish serfdom or personal slavery &#x2026; including the iron collar as a badge of slavery&#x201D; with whips for &#x201C;the refractory slaves.&#x201D; Thus Gurth and his brass collar in <hi rend="italic">Past and Present</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 10:211&#x2013;12, 251) were partly anticipated by the reviewers.</note> Fraser, I dare say, likes it right well; as to me, it is really not <hi rend="italic">my</hi> concern but another&#x2019;s.</p>

<salute>Dear Miss Jewsbury,</salute>
<p>Will you put up with a hurried word from me today, instead of long discourses which I could like so well to hold with you, were it permitted me. I am busier than usual; I have had, and have, <hi rend="italic">colds</hi> and <foreign><hi rend="italic">etceteras</hi></foreign><hi rend="italic">:</hi> you shall not think me forgetful of you, which at any time is far from being the case.</p>
<p>I heartily condole with you on this mournful loss of your last Parent; mournful no doubt, and ever sudden when it comes, tho&#x2019; long expected. It is the lot of all men; by the clearest course of Nature we <hi rend="italic">are</hi> to lose our Fathers and Mothers here below; a world-old thing: but yet it comes on every one of us with a stern <hi rend="italic">originality</hi>, as if it had never befallen till now. We ourselves, as you remark, seem far nearer to Death; there is now nothing between us and Death.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Jewsbury had d. <date when="1840-08-28">28 Aug.</date>, aged 75. She had been nursing him &#x201C;so that now it seems as if all my <hi rend="italic">real</hi> occupation were gone. &#x2026; <supplied>[T]</supplied>ill I was placed in actual contact with&#x201D; death &#x201C;I was scarcely aware of the utter want of meaning &#x26; reality there is in the usually received doctrines &#x26; topics of comfort &#x2026; but with the process of dissolution beginning before our eyes &#x26; continuing, till that wh. was our friend, has become a handful of dust we tread upon&#x2014;how <hi rend="italic">can</hi> we do other than <hi rend="italic">feel</hi>, that we shall see them again no more for ever?&#x201D;</note> And the little fraction of the Past which was ours, which we ourselves lived in, is gone irrevocably far,&#x2014;swallowed up with the &#x201C;great and famous Nations of the Dead.&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-06/lt-18321119-TC-JSM-01"><sic>6:259</sic><corr>TC to JSM, <date when="1832-11-19">19 Nov. 1832</date></corr></ref>. Untraced, but cf. Ezek. 31, 32.</note>&#x2014; You will not indulge these thoughts too much; there is no profit in them: we must &#x201C;up, turn back into life&#x201D;;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Untraced.</note> we too have to live, and work,&#x2014;this day or never. I hope your new duties and tasks are gradually getting clear to you; no life of a human being is <pb id="pg-12-296" n="12:296"/>without these; and all true knowledge is simply to ascertain how and what they are. Shall I not withal predict for you, dear modest heroine, a Future calmer and profitabler than the Past has been. You are getting thro&#x2019; your sore struggles. Streaks of a new day-spring, not due to words of mine, but to yourself and Heaven&#x2019;s favour for the like of you, are breaking on your path. Doubt not, it will ripen gradually into tranquil day.</p>
<p>Before quitting this subject, let me say, among the few utterable thoughts one has about this great mystery of Death,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >She had said: &#x201C;How much I wish that you would tell me what <hi rend="italic">you</hi> think about that change wh. is called <hi rend="italic">Death</hi>.&#x201D;</note> and the many <hi rend="italic">un</hi>utterable, That I do not now participate in your sad feeling of that total &#x201C;impossibility.&#x201D; No; it is most surely <hi rend="italic">possible;</hi> it were not even more <hi rend="italic">wonderful</hi> than that we now <hi rend="italic">live</hi>. The miracle of miracles lies for us in that word. The <hi rend="small-caps">Unnamed</hi> who has cast the wondrous essence of us down into this imprisonment of a bodily shape, He, if it please Him, can sustain us under all imaginable forms and conditions. The Dead are with Him even as we the Living are. Their state is not more solemn, near to Him, than our own. We have to say, as the poor Arabs do, &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Islam</hi>, His Will be done!&#x201D; Or with Job of old, &#x201C;Tho&#x2019; He slay me, yet will I trust in Him.&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Job 13:15.</note> All prophecy about our future destiny seems to me, by the nature of it, futile, and at this epoch of the world, worthless: but an indestructible boundless hope about it seems permitted and sanctioned.&#x2014; On the whole, I find I have great sympathy with the Chinese religion too; that <hi rend="italic">worship</hi> of their Dead Fathers practiced there. This so far as one can see is probably the chief <hi rend="italic">worship</hi> they have. God, they say, is &#x201C;that blue sky,&#x201D; is &#x201C;that Immensity all round there&#x201D;; about Him we know little: but our Loved Ones that lie buried, are not they as Gods to us,&#x2014;deified; do not our hearts overflow in sacred pity, in solemn reverence for them! We offer these oblations at their tomb;&#x2014;our mute voice towards them, expressive of what no words will speak!&#x2014; Alas, what a wretched thing were Life, if there were no Death in it. I fancy the foolishest man would grow desperate of his existence and its paltrinesses, if that celestial temple, fearful and wonderful to the foolishest, stood not always in the background. Standing there, it makes the meanest life divine. Dying we do become a kind of Gods. I will speak no more of all this at present.</p>
<p>Your dear sister&#x2019;s name was well known to me; and, I remember, did suggest itself the first time I saw yours signed. Unluckily I have read none of her writings, except some scattered fragments which I <pb id="pg-12-297" n="12:297"/>caught in passing, which are now grown indistinct to me. From one source and another I had gathered some image of her as of a clear decisive rational woman, not unlike what you now describe.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Maria Jane Jewsbury (<date when="1800-00-00">1800</date>&#x2013;<date when="1833-00-00">33</date>). Encouraged to be a professional author by Alaric A. Watts in Manchester, she wrote <hi rend="italic">Phantasmagoria</hi> (London, <date when="1825-00-00">1825</date>), also <hi rend="italic">Letters to the Young</hi> (London, <date when="1828-00-00">1828</date>), <hi rend="italic">Lays of Leisure Hours</hi> (London, <date when="1829-00-00">1829</date>), <hi rend="italic">The Three Histories: &#x2026; of an Enthusiast, &#x2026; a Nonchalant, &#x2026; a Realist</hi> (London, <date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>) and contributed to the <hi rend="italic">Athenaeum</hi>, <date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>&#x2013;<date when="1832-00-00">32</date>. She m., <date when="1832-00-00">1832</date>, William Kew Fletcher (d. <date when="1867-00-00">1867</date>), chaplain in the East India Company, and d. of cholera at Poona; see Francis Espinasse, <hi rend="italic">Lancashire Worthies</hi>, second series (London, <date when="1877-00-00">1877</date>) 323&#x2013;39. Geraldine had written that she owed her &#x201C;whatever may be good for anything in my character, she had the entire management of me from the time I was six years old at my mother&#x2019;s death, till she married. &#x2026; There are few women like what she was, her writings gave no indication of how much really lay in her.&#x201D;</note> We unhappily never met. I lived far away then, among the Dumfriesshire hills, and knew almost nobody except from afar. The other day I made a clutch at one Book of hers (a strange reprint, it seemed, put into the oddest neighbourhood, done at Philadelphia); but my Dealer in Old Books had already parted with it.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC attached to the first page of the MS a cutting from a bookseller&#x2019;s catalogue: &#x201C;8451 Tytler&#x2019;s Life of Sir Walter Raleigh: Autobiography of John Galt; <hi rend="italic">Miss Jewsbury&#x2019;s</hi> Three Histories: Mitchell on the Formation of Water; Parry&#x2019;s Three Voyages; The Bengalee, in 1 vol. royal 8 vo. cloth 4s.6d.

<p>My wife accepts with much affection the message you send.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >She had asked TC to tell JWC &#x201C;that I am very grateful for the kindness you have expressed to me on her behalf.&#x201D;</note> She is as heterodox as yourself, and a true soul withal. Some mutual esteem could not fail between you if you met. Pray understand, however, for the present, that it is always with me you correspond, not with her and me; that she is to know no more than I judge publishable, and expects or desires to know <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> if that please me. Write always as to me alone.</p>
<p>Today I must have done. I love to fancy you by the sea shore beside your friend.<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Elizabeth Newton Paulet, Seaforth House, four and a half mi.

The very breath of the Sea its great everlasting voice are a kind of healing to me. Go often thither. You will use your Catholic Priest, so <pb id="pg-12-298" n="12:298"/>far as he proves serviceable,&#x2014;not perhaps without an eye of caution on him.<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jewsbury had told TC about the conversion of Julia Newton (Mrs. Paulet&#x2019;s sister) to Catholicism, which led to their meeting &#x201C;a Priest who stands high in the Church for his learning&#x2014;he is the most single hearted good man that can be imagined &#x26; one who does what he thinks right without caring for consequences. &#x2026; He helps us with books &#x26; information without expressing any inclination to convert us&#x2014;he is very romantic about his religion, for <hi rend="italic">him</hi> its Liturgy is not &#x2018;gone silent.&#x2019;&#x201D; He became a model for Everhard in her first novel, <hi rend="italic">Zo&#xEB;</hi> (<date when="1845-00-00">1845</date>).</note> They are busy these people in England at present; I know not well with what degree of moral merit; surely with small intellectual: i<supplied>[t]</supplied> seems to me the rest <hi rend="italic">they</hi> can yield any soul is no very noble one.

<p>Do you read many Books? You will find resources in Literature, the more as you get deeper into it. A picture of the struggle of a man; every book is that. All men in all ages, one finds, have had intrinsically the <hi rend="italic">same</hi> struggle as we; identical, tho under such diversity of vesture. The face<supplied>[s]</supplied> of them, on this hand and on that, give one comfort: We are <hi rend="italic">not</hi> alone then; we are in an endless <hi rend="italic">army</hi> of comrades!</p>
<p>I have written more than I meant. Good be with you, dear sister Geraldine. Write always when you feel called to it as if you were my sister,&#x2014;domestic news or what you will.</p>

<salute>Dear Mr Lockhart,</salute>
<p>In reference to one of the topics touched upon yesterday, when I was lucky enough to come athwart your o<supplied>[r]</supplied>bit for a little,&#x2014;it strikes me that I might as well have asked you, If you did not by chance possess a copy of the Covenanter Baillie&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Letters and Journals?</hi> Or perhaps you know some charitable soul who has one, and would lend it me to read? As I borrow Books from all persons, it ought to be added that I endeavour to make conscience of punctually returning them uninjured. I have been in quest of this <hi rend="italic">Baillie</hi> for two years and more, to no purpose hitherto. It strikes me that one Peterkin republished it at Edinburgh lately, or was about doing that; in which case you are more likely to have it.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For <hi rend="italic">The Letters and Journals of Robert Baillie</hi>, see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400917-TC-JF-01">TC to JF, <date when="1840-09-17">17 Sept.</date></ref> Peterkin is presumably Alexander Peterkin, 5 Deanhaugh St., Edinburgh, who ed. <hi rend="italic">Records of the Kirk of Scotland</hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1838-00-00">1838</date>) and <hi rend="italic">The Booke of the Universall Kirk of Scotland</hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1839-00-00">1839</date>) but not Baillie&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi>.</note></p>
<p>I will ask farther, now that my hand is in, whether you have not, in defect of Baillie or not in defect, some stock of Books on that Period of History; in which a hungry reaver might be allowed, on occasion, to forage? I desiderate greatly the <hi rend="italic">Literature</hi> of it, Songs, Pasquinades &#x26;c &#x26;c,&#x2014;so far as it had any Literature.</p>
<p>At lowest, perhaps you can tell me something about <hi rend="italic">Jenny Geddes!</hi> I search to no purpose for any glimmering of light about Jenny. K. Sharpe (in <hi rend="italic">Kir</hi><supplied>[<hi rend="italic">k</hi>]</supplied><hi rend="italic">ton</hi>) says, she had sat on the <hi rend="italic">Cutty Stool</hi> for a mistake in behaviour; but even this small fact I am unable to verify. Burns, you tell me, named his mare after her;&#x2014;proper surely. In truth, she stands as a most memorable monumental Figure, this poor Jenny, to me; <hi rend="italic">featureless</hi>, I am afraid, forever.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For Jenny Geddes, see <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390227-TC-JF-01">TC to JF, <date when="1839-02-27">27 Feb. 1839</date></ref>.

<salute>Dear Mother</salute>
<p>I make no excuse for being so long in complying with your often repeated hint that I should write to you&#x2014;it is for the like of &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">Tom</hi>&#x2019; to &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">take the hint</hi>&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;&#x2018;Toam tuik ta hint,&#x2019; our little <hi rend="italic">Craw</hi> Jean had a long inane comically solemn <hi rend="italic">Dialogue</hi> to report of an excell<hi rend="italic">t</hi> simple old Mrs Clough (Br<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Alick&#x2019;s Mother-in-law <supplied>[)]</supplied>; of wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> this ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">Toam</hi>&#x2019; (her own Son Tom) was a kind of cardinal point or (solemnly inane) corner stone&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note).</note>&#x2014;but for me, your highly original daughter-in-law, I am far beyond hints, or even direct commands, in the matter of letter-writing&#x2014; I have now in fact no character to lose and make myself quite comfortable in the reflection that far from feeling any indignant surprise at my silence, my friends will henceforth receive any communication I may vouchsafe them in the course of years as an unexpected favour for which they cannot be too thankful&#x2014;</p>
<p>What do I do with my time you wonder? with such &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">a right easy seat of it</hi>&#x201D; one might fancy I should be glad to write a letter now and then just to keep the devil from my elbow&#x2014; But Alicks Jenny and all of you were never more mistaken than when you imagine a woman needs half a dozen squeeling [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] children to keep her uneasy&#x2014;she can manage to keep herself uneasy in a hundred ways without <hi rend="italic">that</hi>. For my part I am always as busy as possible&#x2014;on that side at least I hold out no encouragement to the Devil&#x2014;and yet, suppose you were to look thro&#x2019; a microscope&#x2014;you might be puzzled to discover a trace of what I do&#x2014;nevertheless depend upon <supplied>[it&#x2014;]</supplied>my doings are not lost&#x2014;but invisible to human eyes they &#x201C;sail down the stream of time into the ocean of eternity&#x201D; and who knows but I may find them after many days.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Eccles. 11:1. &#x201C;&#x2018;Oh Lord,&#x2014;we&#x2019;re a&#x2019; sailing down the stream of time into the ocean of eternity:&#x2014;for Christ&#x2019;s sake: <hi rend="italic">Amen,</hi>&#x2019; was the Grace-before-meat (according to myth) of some <foreign>extempore</foreign> xtian suddenly called on, and at a loss for words&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note).</note></p>
<p>At present I have got a rather heavy burden on my shoulders. the guarding of a human being from the perdition of strong liquors. My poor little Helen has been gradually geting more and more into the habit of tippling&#x2014;until some fortnight ago she rushed down into a fit of the most decided drunkeness that I ever happened to witness&#x2014; Figure the <hi rend="italic">Head of the Mystic School</hi> and a delicate female like myself <pb id="pg-12-302" n="12:302"/>up till after three in the morning, trying to get the maddened creature to bed, not daring to leave her at large for fear she should set fire to the house or cut her own throat&#x2014; Finally we got her <hi rend="italic">bolted</hi> into the back kitchen in a corner of which she had established herself all coiled up and <hi rend="italic">fuffing</hi> [puffing and fuming] like a young tiger about to make a spring&#x2014;or like <hi rend="italic">the Bride of Lammermuir</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Scott&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">The Bride of Lammermoor</hi> (London, <date when="1819-00-00">1819</date>) ch. 34.</note> (if you ever read that profane book)&#x2014;next day she looked black with shame and despair and the day following, overcome by her tears, and promises, and self-upbraidings I forgave her again very much to my own surprise&#x2014; About <hi rend="italic">half an hour</hi> after this forgiveness had been accorded I called to her to make me some batter&#x2014;it was long of coming&#x2014;and I rung the bell&#x2014;no answer. I went down to the kitchen to see the meaning of all this delay&#x2014;and the meaning was very clear, my penitent was lying on the floor dead drunk&#x2014;spread out like the three legs of Man<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Symbol of the Isle of Man: &#x201C;See any Manx halfpenny. Common similitude on these coasts&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note).</note>&#x2014;with a chair upset beside her and in the midst of a perfect chaos of dirty dishes and fragments of broken crockery&#x2014;the whole scene was a lively epitome of a place that shall be nameless&#x2014; And this happened at ten in the morning!&#x2014; All that day she remained lying on the floor insensible&#x2014;or occasionally sitting up like a little bundle of dirt&#x2014;executing a sort of <hi rend="italic">whinner</hi>&#x2014; We could not imagine how she came to be so long of sobering&#x2014;but it turned out she had a whole bottle of whiskey hidden within reach, to which she crawled <hi rend="italic">till it was finished</hi> thro&#x2019;out the day&#x2014; After this, of course I was <hi rend="italic">determined</hi> that she should leave&#x2014; My friends here set to work with all zeal to find me a servant&#x2014;and a very promising young woman came to stay with me until a permanent character should turn up&#x2014; This last scene &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">transpired</hi>&#x201D; on the Wednesday on the Monday she was to sail for Kirkaldy&#x2014; All the intervening days&#x2014;I held out against her pale face, her tears, her despair&#x2014;but I suffered terribly for I am really much attached to the poor wretch who has no fault under heaven but this one&#x2014;on the Sunday night I called her up to pay her her wages and to inquire into her future prospects&#x2014;her future prospects! it was enough to break any body&#x2019;s heart to hear how she talked of them&#x2014; It was all over for her on this earth, plainly, if I drove her away from me who alone have any influence with her&#x2014; Beside me she would struggle&#x2014;away from me she saw no possibility of resisting what she had come to regard as her Fate&#x2014; You may guess the sequel&#x2014; I forgave her a third time&#x2014;and a last time&#x2014; I <hi rend="italic">could</hi> not deny her this <hi rend="italic">one</hi> more chance&#x2014;the creature is so good otherwise&#x2014; <pb id="pg-12-303" n="12:303"/>Since then she has abstained from drink, I believe, in <hi rend="italic">every</hi> shape&#x2014;finding abstinence, like old Samuel Johnson, easier than temperance<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Boswell, <hi rend="italic">Life of Johnson</hi> 851.</note>&#x2014;but how long she may be strong enough to persevere in this rigid course, in which lies her only hope&#x2014;God knows. I am not very sanguine&#x2014;meanwhile I feel as if I had adopted a child&#x2014; I find it necessary to take such an incessant charge of her&#x2014;bodily and mentally&#x2014;and my own body and soul generally keep me in work enough without any such additional responsibility.</p>
<p>Carlyle is reading voraciously great folios preparatory to writing a new book&#x2014;for the rest he growls away much in the old style&#x2014;but one gets to feel a certain indifference to his growling&#x2014;if one did not, it would be the worse for one&#x2014; I think he committed a great error in sending away his horse&#x2014;it distinctly did him good&#x2014;and would have done him much more good if he could have &#x201C;damned the expence&#x201D;&#x2014; Even in an economical point of view he would have gained more in the long run by increased ability to work than he spent in making himself healthier&#x2014;but a willful man will have his way&#x2014; My kind love to Isabella&#x2014;and all of them&#x2014;I hope she is stronger now&#x2014;it was all she seemed to want to be a first rate wife&#x2014; I never forget her kindness to me last year&#x2014;tho I do not write to her any more than to others</p>

<p>Impossible to date with accuracy; the poor Incid<hi rend="italic">t</hi> I recollect right well in all its details, but not the point of time. &#x2018;Helen&#x2019; Mitchell, from Kirkcaldy (originally from Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>), must have come hither ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> the <date when="1837-00-00">end of 1837</date>; she staid with us (thanks to the boundless skill and patience of her mistress) ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> 11 years; and was, in a sense, the only Servant we ever got to <hi rend="italic">belong to us</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">be</hi> one of our household, in this place.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I meant to write yesterday, and the day before yesterday; much more today! And yet it is as it were perforce, and more to the semblance than the reality, that I am able to accomplish even this latter. Captain Sterling (just home from Canada) came in upon me when I was getting out the pen; and sat <hi rend="italic">here</hi>, Jane being out, till 4 o&#x2019;clock struck, and dinner was at hand.&#x2014; I am down stairs <hi rend="italic">altogether</hi> today; Jane is gone on some dramatic expedition to the Macreadys&#x2019; whither I could not be persuaded;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >To see J. Stirling Coyne&#x2019;s burletta, <hi rend="italic">Laffarge;</hi> Macready noted on <date when="1840-10-29">29 Oct.</date> that he came home to find Forster, &#x201C;who had convoyed the family and Mrs. Carlyle to see Madame Laffarge at the Adelphi!!!&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Diaries</hi>, ed. William Toynbee [London, <date when="1912-00-00">1912</date>] 2:92).</note> I have dined here, and am to read here (more convenient for my folios);&#x2014;so while tea is not yet come, I fling you a word, right sorry that half a post if not a whole one is again lost.</p>
<p>Except a snivelling little vermin of a cold which plagued me for a while, I do not recollect that there is any new thing since you heard last. I had to attack the cold with <hi rend="italic">ol. ricin</hi> [castor oil] my old friend; I have still to go buttoned rather close. Today I have not gone out at all, the dirty foggy rain having fallen almost incessantly till Sterling went away. Health makes considerable difference in my reading work; tho&#x2019; I sit at the book well or unwell, the liveliness of one&#x2019;s attention is of course various.&#x2014; On the whole I do not find that I make great progress in this new enterprise, sometimes no progress at all,&#x2014;or even <hi rend="italic">retro</hi>gress; that is to say, my interest in it threatens sometimes to decline and die! It is not tenth part such a subject as the French Revolution; nor can the art of man ever make such a Book out of it. However we must hold on. One dreadful circumstance is, that the Books, without exception, the documents &#x26;c one has to read are of a dulness to threaten locked-jaw; I never read such jumbling, drowsy, endless stupidities: &#x201C;seventhly and lastly&#x201D;!&#x2014; Yet I say to myself a Great Man does lie buried under this waste continent of cinders, and a Great Action: <pb id="pg-12-306" n="12:306"/>canst thou not <hi rend="italic">un</hi>bury them, present them visible, and so help as it were in the creation of them? We shall see.</p>
<p>Aird was not the writer of that Article, it seems; but one Gilfillan, a young Burgher Minister at Dundee.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Gilfillan (<date when="1813-00-00">1813</date>&#x2013;<date when="1878-00-00">78</date>), miscellaneous writer, minister at the Burgher Church, School Wynd, Dundee, <date when="1836-00-00">1836</date>&#x2013;<date when="1878-00-00">78</date>. In the course of <date when="1840-00-00">1840</date> he wrote a number of articles for the <hi rend="italic">Dumfries Herald</hi> including this one on TC (see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18401017-TC-TA-01">TC to TA, <date when="1840-10-17">17 Oct.</date></ref>) and others on such figures as Jeffrey, Irving and Chalmers. They first met in <date when="1843-00-00">1843</date>. Gilfillan&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">A Gallery of Literary Portraits</hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1845-00-00">1845</date>) included a different sketch of TC, whom he still admired; but in <hi rend="italic">Christianity and Our Era</hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1857-00-00">1857</date>) he was to write that TC&#x2019;s &#x201C;discontent has darkened into something fiercer than misanthropy&#x2014;into universal hatred. &#x2026; His aversion to Christianity &#x2026; has of late assumed a deeper shade. &#x2026; His system, always a flower-dressed corpse, is fast becoming putrid&#x201D; (160&#x2013;61).</note> How he contrives to hold such notions, and be a Burgher Minister, one cannot well say.&#x2014; In the <hi rend="italic">R&#xE9;vue</hi> [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] <hi rend="italic">des Deux Mondes</hi> I find a still more striking piece, on the same great topic, by one <hi rend="italic">Chasles;</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400426-TC-GEJ-01">TC to GEJ, <date when="1840-04-26">26 April</date></ref>. <hi rend="italic">Revue des Deux Mondes</hi> 24 ser. 5 (<date when="1840-00-00">1840</date>): 109&#x2013;26.</note> who, I remember, is the Translator of Jean Paul&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Titan:</hi> it is really a remarkable Article; I did not think any Frenchman would have understood the Book so well. And now, verily it may be hoped, we are reviewed enough!&#x2014; Jane is bargaining with Fraser about the <hi rend="italic">Lectures;</hi> she, not I: if no money can be had for them, they shall not be printed at present.</p>
<p>The inclosed Note, from Jean two days ago, is all my Scotch news. The Box she speaks of is understood to have <hi rend="italic">oatmeal</hi> in it; a thing immensely wanted here. &#x201C;Miss Grahame&#x201D; is the little <hi rend="italic">Leghorn-Plait</hi> woman; who is bent on sending Jane a bonnet, out of gratitude.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.

<p>Mill seems to have gone to Normandy for a few weeks of rustication.

Angry about the Treaty of London, <date when="1840-07-15">15 July</date>, signed by Palmerston and Nicholas I in relation to Turkey, Thiers was threatening to support Mehemet Ali of Egypt against Turkey, which was supported by Russia, Britain, and Austria. The external events were accompanied by an internal political crisis over who was to control the government of France, Louis Philippe or his ministers. The French radicals were seen as wanting war as a &#x201C;more plausible, though circuitous, path to revolution&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, <date when="1840-10-29">29 Oct.</date>). After an attempt to assassinate Louis Philippe, <date when="1840-10-15">15 Oct.</date>, the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, <date when="1840-10-23">23 Oct.</date>, reported that Lammenais&#x2019; <hi rend="italic">Le Pays et le Gouvernement</hi>, Louis Blanc&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Organisation of Labour</hi>, Thore&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">The Truth Respecting the Democratic</hi>, and the <hi rend="italic">Democratic Alamanack</hi> had all been seized as dangerous revolutionary pamphlets. Cavaignac is not mentioned, but TC perhaps knew that he had some connections with the <hi rend="italic">Democratic Alamanack</hi>. Thiers had resigned, <date when="1840-10-21">21 Oct.</date>; and Guizot, recalled from London, replaced him and pursued a line more conciliatory to Britain and closer to Louis Philippe&#x2019;s views. TC here reiterates the view of the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, <date when="1840-10-27">27 Oct.</date>, that the radicals were warmongering and that &#x201C;the democratic press is vomiting forth a torrent of the wildest elements of anarchy&#x201D;; for Mill&#x2019;s more liberal opinion, see Mineka 13:445&#x2013;46.</note> Like the man who &#x201C;by the quickset hedge&#x201D; (by <hi rend="italic">Bonapartism</hi>, let us say) had &#x201C;scratched out both his eyes,&#x201D; they are determined by the same quickset hedge to &#x201C;scratch them in again!&#x201D;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For the nursery rhyme &#x201C;There was a man of Thessaly,&#x201D; see <hi rend="italic">The Original Mother Goose&#x2019;s Melody &#x2026; reproduced in Facsimile from the first Worcester</hi> [<hi rend="italic">Mass</hi>. <date when="1785-00-00">1785</date>] <hi rend="italic">Edition</hi>, ed.

<salute>Dear Mr. Grahame,</salute>
<p>I have just written a long letter about you to Mr. Greig of &#x201C;Canadaigua, New-York State&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Greig of Canandaigua; see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18360205-TC-AC-01"><sic>8:297</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1836-02-05">5 Feb. 1836</date></corr></ref>.</note> (is that the address?)&#x2014;adding fuel, if I could, to fire, about this business of the Glasgow American Consulship. It is a relief to me to do it. I <hi rend="italic">burn</hi> with impatience to see this project take effect, to do something, anything towards it! My brothers letter arrived last night;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found; probably from Alick asking him to contact Greig on Graham&#x2019;s behalf, as an influential businessman in New York State, and someone who already knew Graham; see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370305-TC-AC-01"><sic>9:163</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1837-03-05">5 March 1837</date></corr></ref>.</note> I wished I had but been President of Yankeeland for one hour.</p>
<p>In good truth, you must <hi rend="italic">bestir</hi> yourself heartily for this enterprise. It is worth striving for. I straitly charge you that you leave no stone unturned. Stir up <hi rend="italic">all</hi> your friends here and yonder: there is no man that has ever known you but will think any pains well bestowed in giving help here. Harrison, it seems, will certainly be elected.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Henry Harrison (<date when="1733-00-00">1733</date>&#x2013;<date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>), elected pres. of the U.S., <date when="1840-00-00">1840</date>, served from <date when="1841-03-04">4 March</date> to <date when="1841-04-04">4 April 1841</date>, when he died of pneumonia.</note> Forward, then, forward!</p>
<p>Ought you not to go to Glasgow, and get a Testimonial from as many influential persons, especially American Merchants, as know you there? I have suggested that to Greig; who, I doubt not, will think it suitable. Is there anybody here in London, attainable or unattainable, that has anything to say to it?</p>
<p>I will never forgive you, if you let this business slip thro&#x2019; your <pb id="pg-12-310" n="12:310"/>fingers for want of making a stir about it. Hand to the work, and no looking back!</p>
<p>I am as busy as mortal can be at present;&#x2014;and <hi rend="italic">bilious</hi> enough besides. I think often and often of you tho&#x2019; I say no word;&#x2014;you know that well enough.

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>As you may not perhaps be quite instructed about Jack&#x2019;s movements of late, and be giving way to one knows not what anxieties, I <pb id="pg-12-313" n="12:313"/>send you this Note<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> from him which has just arrived. It announces that he is safe out of Wales and the Mountain Country into a plain smooth easy region; and has now no more <hi rend="italic">sailing</hi> at all to execute,&#x2014;unless he chooses to <hi rend="italic">seek</hi> more. The Welsh Country must be <foreign><hi rend="italic">glarry</hi></foreign>[muddy] and rough at this season: it appears when they got to the end of Wales, the Steamer was off, and they declined to sail by anything else, but came round by land. It is as if you were at Kirkcudbright, wishing to be at Liverpool, and had at last decided to go round by Carlisle on land all the way. He is now at Bristol,&#x2014;as it were at Carlisle. Tomorrow (Friday) he calculates on being at his journey&#x2019;s end. It is the finest part of England: if I were in his place I should like to <hi rend="italic">set up my staff</hi> for a little there!</p>
<p>We have Alick&#x2019;s Letter today, announcing that you are all toreably [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] well, and that the Box is under way. We shall be blithe to see it. We have flown to some <hi rend="italic">bought meal</hi>, being absolutely <hi rend="italic">bent</hi> on porridge. It is very rough (Berwickshire meal) but eatable  The butter also is getting bad.</p>
<p>Anthony Sterling saw me at the close of a very <hi rend="italic">wet day</hi>, during the whole of which I had not been out. I decidedly <hi rend="italic">feel</hi> better than I did &#x201C;when he went to America.&#x201D; Jane&#x2019;s sickliness was only the little brush she had in consequence of our Maid&#x2019;s confusion; about which she told you, I suppose, when she wrote the other day.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Anthony Sterling had just returned from Canada; otherwise unexplained.

<p>This is no Letter, dear Mother, far from it! It is a mere <hi rend="italic">good-day</hi>, uttered in extreme haste, but, as ever, from the inmost heart. Good be with you all!</p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>A fair Traveller<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sophie, mentioned later in the letter, not further identified.</note> from your country, who has done us the honour and pleasure of a visit, reminds me that I ought to write, that I ought to have written long weeks ago. Weeks, or even months, for on looking at your last Note I am shocked to discover that it must be almost half a year since it, and the new volume accompanied by it, arrived here! <pb id="pg-12-314" n="12:314"/>Why I have shamefully delayed so long, were now hard to say. Certainly it was not for want of thankfulness; neither was it for the rather common reason, that I had not read the Book and so knew not how to speak of it. The new volume of the <hi rend="italic">Denkw&#xfc;rdigkeiten</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Vol. 5; it had arrived on <date when="1840-03-17">17 March</date>.</note> was eagerly read in the first days after its arrival here, and with a pleasure which is still vividly present to me.&#x2014; Alas, you are a sickly man like myself; you know well enough, I doubt not, what <hi rend="italic">Procrastination</hi> means! One of our poets calls it the &#x201C;Thief of Time.&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edward Young, <hi rend="italic">Night Thoughts</hi> 1:393.</note> After long months one is suddenly astonished, some day, to find how much of Life, and of the best uses of life, it has stolen from us.</p>
<p>The most striking piece in this Fifth volume was, to me, the <hi rend="italic">Congress of Vienna</hi>. All was good and very good; but this best. At the risk of speaking things which, in a vapid hollow time like ours, were perhaps as well unspoken, I must express my real admiration (that is the word) of the talent, skill, and faculty of many sorts, displayed in such a composition. That is what we call the <hi rend="italic">art</hi> of writing,&#x2014;the summary and outcome of many arts and gifts. The grand secret of it, I believe, is <hi rend="italic">insight</hi>,&#x2014;just estimation and understanding, by head, and especially by heart. Give a man a <hi rend="italic">Narrative</hi> to make, you take in brief the measure of whatsoever worth is in the man. The Thing Done lies round him, with length, breadth, depth, a distracted chaos; he models it into order, sequence and visibility,&#x2014;justly with whatever force of intelligence is in him. So far could <hi rend="italic">he</hi> see into the genesis, organisation, course and coherence of it; so truly and far, no trulier and farther: it is the measure of his capability&#x2014;of his <foreign><hi rend="italic">Taugend</hi></foreign> [worth], and even if you like, of his <foreign><hi rend="italic">Tugend</hi></foreign> [virtue]. I rejoice much in such a style of delineation; I prefer it to almost all uses which a man can make of the spiritual faculty entrusted him here below. Let us understand the Thing Done; let us see it, and preserve true memory of it: a man had understanding given him, and a pen and ink, chiefly for that. In the name of the present and of future times, I bid you continue to write us <hi rend="italic">Memoirs</hi>.</p>
<p>Your proposed visit to London did not take effect last year. In another year perhaps you may execute it. You will find some persons here right well-affected towards you; much to see and consider; many things, I may suppose, which at first, and some which to the last, will afflict and offend you. We are near two millions in this City; a whole continent of brick, overarched with our smoke-canopy which rains down sometimes as black snow; and a tumult, velocity and deafening torrent of motion, material and spiritual, such as the world, one may hope, never saw <pb id="pg-12-315" n="12:315"/>before. Profound sadness is usually one&#x2019;s first impression. After months, still more after years, the method there was in such madness begins a little to disclose itself.</p>
<p>I read few German works at present; know almost nothing of what you are doing. Indeed except your own writings there turns up little, which a lover of German <hi rend="italic">Literature</hi>, as I have understood the word in old years, would not as soon avoid as seek. In these days I have read a new volume of Heine&#x2019;s, with a strange mixture of feelings. <hi rend="italic">Heine &#xfc;ber B&#xF6;rne;</hi> it is to me the most portentous amalgam of <hi rend="italic">sunbeams</hi> and brutal <hi rend="italic">mud</hi> that I have met with for a long while. I remember the man B&#xF6;rne&#x2019;s book; in which he called Goethe the <foreign><hi rend="italic">graue Staar</hi></foreign>[cataract] that had shut into blindness the general eye of Germany.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Heinrich Heine (<date when="1797-00-00">1797</date>&#x2013;<date when="1856-00-00">1856</date>), lyric poet and literary critic. Ludwig B&#xF6;rne, b. L&#xF6;b Baruch (<date when="1786-00-00">1786</date>&#x2013;<date when="1837-00-00">1837</date>), republican political writer and satirist. Both lived in Paris after <date when="1830-00-00">1830</date> and were associated with the Junges Deutschland. B&#xF6;rne disliked and attacked Heine, who, after B&#xF6;rne&#x2019;s death, had retaliated with <hi rend="italic">Heinrich Heine &#xfc;ber Ludwig B&#xF6;rne</hi> (Hamburg, <date when="1840-00-00">1840</date>), which defended himself at B&#xF6;rne&#x2019;s expense. TC had read B&#xF6;rne in <date when="1834-00-00">1834</date> (see <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340506-TC-JPE-01"><sic>7:142</sic><corr>TC to JPE, <date when="1834-05-06">6 May 1834</date></corr></ref>), possibly his <hi rend="italic">Briefe aus Paris</hi> <date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>&#x2013;<date when="1831-00-00">31</date> (Hamburg, <date when="1832-00-00">1832</date>&#x2013;<date when="1834-00-00">34</date>). The reference to Goethe is untraced.</note> Heine seems to have given up railing at Goethe; he, Heine himself, it seems, has now become a &#x201C;Column of Luxor,&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >As in the Temple of Luxor, one of the ruins of Thebes, ancient capital of Upper Egypt.</note> <foreign><hi rend="italic">aere perennius</hi></foreign> [more lasting than bronze],<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Horace, <hi rend="italic">Odes</hi> 3.3.</note> and a god does not rail at gods. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Eheu! Eheu!</hi></foreign> [Alas! Alas!]</p>
<p>If you stand in any correspondence with Dr Schlesier of Stuttgart, will you take occasion to signify, with many thanks on my part, that I have received his Third volume of <hi rend="italic">Gentz&#x2019;s Writings;</hi><note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Gustav Schlesier, <hi rend="italic">Schriften von F. von Gentz Ein Denkmal</hi>, 5 vols. (Mannheim, <date when="1838-00-00">1838</date>&#x2013;<date when="1840-00-00">40</date>). Friedrich von Gentz (<date when="1764-00-00">1764</date>&#x2013;<date when="1832-00-00">1832</date>), political writer and diplomat, first in the service of Prussia, then Austria; financed by the British govt., he wrote against the French Revolution and Napoleon; a supporter of Metternich at the Congress of Vienna.</note> that I did make some attempt to get the Book <hi rend="italic">reviewed</hi> here, but, having now no connexion with that department of things, could not find a proper hand to undertake the business. Indeed I apprehend Gentz has altogether passed here. I can remember him as a popular pamphleteer with a certain party in my early boyhood; but the party has now disappeared, the ideas of it have disappeared; and nobody will now recollect Gentz in the old light, or recognise him in a new. To myself I must confess he hitherto will by no means seem a Hero. The only portion of his writings that I have read with any entertainment is that Historical Piece delineating the prologue to the Battle of Jena. What you somewhere <pb id="pg-12-316" n="12:316"/>say about him I can read; hardly what any other says. A Lady here, daughter of the late Sir James Mackintosh,<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mary Rich had visited Vienna, in <date when="1814-09-00">Sept. 1814</date>, during the Congress with her husband Claudius Rich, before meeting her father, Sir James Mackintosh, in Basel in <date when="1840-09-00">late Sept.</date> Sir James had been a friend and correspondent of Gentz.</note> remembers him at Vienna: &#x201C;a man in powdered ceremonial hair, with a red nose,&#x201D;&#x2014;seemingly fond of dining! <foreign><hi rend="small-caps">edidit</hi> <hi rend="italic">monumentum</hi></foreign> [he has eaten his memorial]!</p>
<p>The fair Sophie kindly undertaking to carry any Parcel, I send you a little Pamphlet of mine published last year. <hi rend="italic">Chartism</hi>, whether one hear the word or do not hear it, is the great fact of England at present.</p>
<p>Did any one ever write an adequate Life of your Frederick the Great? Is there anywhere a legible Life of Luther; so much as an attainable edition of his <hi rend="italic">Tischreden?</hi><note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Tischreden oder Colloquia Doct. Mart. Luthers</hi> (Eisleben, <date when="1566-00-00">1566</date>). A trans. by Capt. Henrie Bell, <hi rend="italic">Dr. Martin Luther&#x2019;s Divine Discourses at his Table</hi> (London, <date when="1652-00-00">1652</date>) had been repbd. in a new edn. (London, <date when="1818-00-00">1818</date>).</note> I fear the answer is, No, in all these cases.</p>
<p>Farewell, dear Sir; be, I do not say happy, but nobly busy, and think of us here as Friends.</p>
<p>Sophie promises to see us a second time tomorrow. I do not rightly know her name yet; but she has a right <foreign><hi rend="italic">gem&#xfc;thlich</hi></foreign> [agreeable] face, and laughing eyes of that beautifullest <hi rend="italic">German grey!</hi></p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Your Letter arrives by the morning mail; opportunely, according to my hope, to announce that your travel is safely accomplished. One word from me must suffice at present: my time is out, my hurry great; take this one word, and the accompanying blockhead of a Letter, to amuse you for a minute, then to burn. Of course I made no answer to it; of course&#x2014;the man is a wellmeaning ass;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> let him live and graze there.</p>
<p>I am in my usual state of biliousness &#x26;c; sunk almost to disappearance in heaps of the stupidest folios that ever were composed by man. Whether any thing, or what, will ever come of that Cromwellean business is all chaotic dubious as yet. Grains as of metal hid under mountains of dust, cinders and sand: whether they can be gathered, can be fused into a figure? Most part of those Books deserve only to be burnt, <pb id="pg-12-317" n="12:317"/>and forgotten to all eternity: that is what <hi rend="italic">they</hi> want of a reasonable man. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Voyons</hi></foreign> [Let us see]!</p>
<p>This morning Sterling sends me a huge horrible Manuscript Poem in four thick copy-books: to be criticized, to be read!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In <date when="1840-09-00">Sept.</date> Sterling had told TC and other friends &#x201C;under seal of secrecy&#x201D; that he had finished the first draft of his new poem (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 11:203 and <ref target="volume-12/lt-18401005-TC-JOST-01">TC to <sic>JS</sic><corr>JOST</corr>, <date when="1840-10-05">5 Oct.</date></ref>). It was to be pbd. anonymously as <hi rend="italic">The Election: A Poem in Seven Books</hi> (London, <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>). For TC&#x2019;s response after reading the poem, see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18401112-TC-JOST-01">TC to <sic>JS</sic><corr>JOST</corr>, <date when="1840-11-12">12 Nov.</date></ref></note> I will never read it; that is certain. He adds a small Note, wherein is honourable mention of you, as of a man whom &#x201C;he likes greatly.&#x201D; Cunningham&#x2019;s match does not seem to be of the most brilliant; may it be of the happiest. Mrs Strachey, as I find, has taken to the writing of Theological <hi rend="italic">Books</hi>. Did you see or hear of her Book&#x2014;on St. John (I think)? We have not seen Maurice, hardly heard of him, since the German Tour.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The &#x201C;small note&#x201D; not found; for Coningham&#x2019;s marriage, see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18401015-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, [<date when="1840-10-15">15 Oct.</date>]</ref>; Mrs. Strachey&#x2019;s theological publications not traced; F. D. Maurice had spent <date when="1840-07-00">July</date> and <date when="1840-08-00">Aug.</date> on the Rhine and in Switzerland.</note></p>
<p>I have to write a short Note to Mary: James Stewart, writing of Craigenputtoch, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> he does not seem to have hope of selling, praises the management of Austin and Mary; this is what I have to <hi rend="italic">tell</hi> her.</p>
<p>No farther news from Annandale; except indeed a short Note from Alick, announcing that all is well, that a certain barrel of meal is under way for us.</p>

<p><hi rend="italic">Carlyle, by way of &#x201C;brief portable commentary&#x201D; on Sewell and the Quarterly Review, deposes:</hi></p>
<p>1. That he the said Carlyle is not, and never was, in use to make much of Pantheism or indeed of any other <hi rend="italic">theism</hi> or <hi rend="italic">ism</hi> now or lately current in the world; that he is willing to let all men be Pantheists or Pottheists according to their convenience, and claims a like liberty for <pb id="pg-12-318" n="12:318"/>himself. That he infinitely prefers <hi rend="small-caps">silence</hi> on that highest matter to any Speech, or other utterance by Liturgy, Ceremony, Painting, Poetry, Surplice, Pitchpipe, or Hand-organ, that he has met with in these latter ages, or hopes to meet with for an age or two. That he says sometimes, with Faust in Goethe, &#x201C;Who dares <hi rend="italic">name</hi> <hi rend="small-caps">him</hi>?&#x201D;&#x2014;and yet struggles to pardon the very Calmucks, who pray by means of a &#x201C;rotatory calabash.&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A favorite image; see &#x201C;Chartism,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 29:196. Kalmucks were a Mongolian nomadic people on the Russian-Chinese border who were Buddhist. The absurdity of &#x201C;new religions&#x201D; is also mentioned in similar terms in <hi rend="italic">Past and Present, Works</hi> 10:225&#x2013;38.</note></p>
<p>2. That he feels a pleasant surprise at finding himself taken up under the category of Puseyism or Antipuseyism, little more pertinent than that of Teetotalism or Antiteetotalism; and could not forbear thanking Heaven and Oxford, as for an unexpected mercy, and kindness bestowed altogether to boot, that he had founded a new religion, as it were, in his sleep.</p>
<p>3. That participating in Father Sewell&#x2019;s earnest feelings about many things, the said Carlyle regards Sewell, morally considered, as a man of worth; and Puseyism as a thing of worth,&#x2014;cheering as a <hi rend="italic">symptom</hi>, likely to do much good as an agent,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; whether in revivifying the Church of England or in more swiftly exploding it, deponent saith not, and indeed hardly cares.</p>
<p>4. That Carlyle regards the said Sewell and Puseyism, intellectually or practically considered, as a chimera (or even, according to Detrosier the Manchester Lecturer,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For Roland Detrosier, see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18320122-TC-MAC-01"><sic>6:94</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1832-01-22">22 Jan. 1832</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-08/lt-18360126-TC-JAC-01"><sic>8:290</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1836-01-26">26 Jan. 1836</date></corr></ref>.</note> as &#x201C;a chimera&#x201D;), literally, as it were, the shadow of a <hi rend="italic">shade</hi>,&#x2014;shadow, namely, of the right reverend Father Archbishop Laud, who, little more than a cobweb even while living, had the head cut off him nearly two hundred years ago,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Laud (<date when="1573-00-00">1573</date>&#x2013;<date when="1645-00-00">1645</date>), archbishop of Canterbury, <date when="1633-00-00">1633</date>, and predominant in the Church of England after the accession of Charles I (<date when="1625-00-00">1625</date>); he attempted to compel uniformity on churchmen. Condemned and beheaded, <date when="1645-00-00">1645</date>.</note> and is not appointed to appear in England a second time at this day, or at any day, short perhaps of the <hi rend="italic">Last</hi>.</p>
<p>5. That the said Carlyle&#x2019;s pen is very bad, and his time short. That he persists and is like to persist in hearty goodwill towards Thomas Spedding; and wishes often he lived, like him, among the everlasting hills, far from all jargon and chaff; and even proposes to do it some day. And farther the deponent saith not.</p>

<salute>Dear James,</salute>
<p>Not hearing from you, I infer, according to bargain that my notion of the account was correct; that &#xa3;7&#x201D;9&#x201D;5 is the sum I owe you.</p>
<p>Yesterday I went along to the City, and despatched for Dumfries to your care at the Commercial Bank, a Hundred and Eight Pounds. The Hundred you are to take out a receipt for, similar to that of the former hundred; and lay them both up together, carefully, in the heart of your repository, till farther news! Or perhaps you may join the <hi rend="italic">two</hi> into one receipt in my name; which will make &#xa3;200 and some fraction? I have forgotten the ways of the Bank. They are easier <hi rend="italic">kept</hi> as one paper; but otherwise they will answer perhaps <hi rend="italic">not</hi> so well. Do as you like.</p>
<p>The &#xa3;8 that will then remain over is your change; which now makes us straight. An overplus of some ten shillings is a present to the little enemy of a Boy (James the Second),<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Carlyle Aitken (b. <date when="1836-00-00">1836</date>).</note> to buy him a pair of breeches,&#x2014;so soon as he arrives at that preferment of breeches, if not already arrived: it will be a memorable day to him for the days he has to live.&#x2014; And finally Jane or you can write &#x201C;all right,&#x201D; or even signify it by a Newspaper with <hi rend="italic">one</hi> stroke, if you absolutely have not a minute to spend in writing; and so we shall have managed for this time.</p>
<p>Yesterday I had brief notice<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> from the Doctor that he had <hi rend="italic">arrived</hi> at Linton in N<hi rend="italic">th</hi> Devonshire; all well: if I were in his place, I should be inclined to stay there a while!</p>
<p>In the <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi> I saw nothing about that miserable M&#x2019;Turk riot, except the suicide of the poor man. The rest, perhaps with a kind intention, was suppressed.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Davidson, farm servant of M&#x2019;Turk of Pennersaughs, and Walter Scott, carrier between Ecclefechan and Carlisle, had been sentenced to four months&#x2019; imprisonment for stealing corn from M&#x2019;Turk. M&#x2019;Turk had been assaulted when pursuing Scott and the corn at Kirtlebridge. William Robertson, a journeyman miller, had been examined on <date when="1840-10-29">29 Oct.</date> in connection with this assault, and then remanded in custody on a charge of resetting [receiving] the corn. He hanged himself that night (<hi rend="italic">Dumfries Courier</hi>, <date when="1840-11-03">3 Nov.</date>).</note></p>
<p>I forget always to tell Jean that I did not see the Johnston Criticism in the <hi rend="italic">Herald</hi>.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Johnston article not traced.</note> The Appolodorus one, I find, is not Mr Aird&#x2019;s but by one <hi rend="italic">Gilfillan</hi> who it seems is a young Burgher Minister in Dundee. The <pb id="pg-12-320" n="12:320"/>best that I have seen of all is one that has appeared in Paris in a (French) Review there.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For Gilfillan and for Chasles&#x2019;s review, see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18401029-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1840-10-29">29 Oct.</date></ref></note> He calls me very savage, but &#x26;c &#x26;c</p>
<p>Lately I picked up a small old Book or pamphlet here, which I designed for you, if the Box had not been <hi rend="italic">gone:</hi> it is called &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">the Siller Gun</hi>,&#x201D; a Dumfries Poem, by a Dumfries man named John Mayne, who died here very old, not many years since, as an Editor and man of some mark. The thing is curious, and worth reading: <hi rend="italic">every</hi> name it names is vanished now; Dumfries is the <hi rend="italic">grandson</hi> of what it then was!<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Mayne (<date when="1759-00-00">1759</date>&#x2013;<date when="1836-00-00">1836</date>), poet, journalist; printer in Dumfries, Glasgow, and London, where he lived from <date when="1787-00-00">1787</date> and was ed. and joint proprietor of the <hi rend="italic">Star</hi> evening newspaper. His poem <hi rend="italic">The Siller Gun</hi>, describing the competitions at a Dumfries wapinschaw, was first pbd. in twelve stanzas in <date when="1777-00-00">1777</date>. TC could have bought James the expanded versions in four cantos (Gloucester, <date when="1808-00-00">1808</date>) or in five (London, <date when="1836-00-00">1836</date>). See also <hi rend="italic">Historical Sketches</hi>, ed. A. Carlyle (London, <date when="1898-00-00">1898</date>) 137&#x2013;38.</note></p>
<p>When I went eastward yesterday, and got near the City, I was like to be choked by &#x201C;the Lord Mayor&#x2019;s shew&#x201D;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The elaborate procession on Lord Mayor&#x2019;s Day, <date when="1840-11-09">9 Nov.</date>, an annual holiday to mark the inauguration to office of the lord mayor elected by the aldermen.

<salute>My dear Sterling,</salute>
<p>Your Poem is full of talent, and full of faults.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In his <hi rend="italic">Life of Sterling</hi>, TC explained that <hi rend="italic">The Election</hi> was &#x201C;in a new vein,&#x2014;what might be called the mock-heroic, or sentimental Hudibrastic &#x2026; ;&#x2014;it had touches of true drollery combined not ill with grave clear insight; showed spirit everywhere, and a plainly improved power of execution. Our stingy verdict was to the effect, &#x2018;Better, but still not good enough. &#x2026;&#x2019;&#x201D; Commenting on its publication in <date when="1841-00-00">late 1841</date>, he wrote that &#x201C;now, in reading the poor little Poem over again, after ten years&#x2019; space, I find it, with a touching mixture of pleasure and repentance, considerably better than it then seemed to me.&#x201D; He gave a fairly full account of the poem, explaining that it was about a contested election between Peter Mogg (&#x201C;pattern English blockhead&#x201D;), and Frank Vane (&#x201C;Sterling himself&#x201D;), which is enlivened with a love interest (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 11:203, 216, 217&#x2013;20).</note> I wish to Heaven I could give you some wise word of advice about it:&#x2014;but indeed would <pb id="pg-12-321" n="12:321"/>you have the smallest chance to follow such advice if given? I have read this <hi rend="italic">Election</hi> with much more entertainment than I ever before read any Poem of yours with. Nay at bottom it is perhaps almost the only Piece, especially of such length, that I could, independently of my regard for the Writer, have read <hi rend="italic">with</hi> real entertainment. In spite of the rhyme, in spite of the afflictive snakishly ambiguous hand (the <hi rend="italic">s</hi> not knowing whether it will turn out an <hi rend="italic">h</hi> or even an <hi rend="italic">m</hi> or <hi rend="italic">n!</hi>) I found the reading of this thing not a duty but a pleasure. So much from me, you will admit, is a great deal.</p>
<p>I do not yet find a <hi rend="italic">musical tune</hi> in either the soul or the body of this Piece; but the rhyme flows easily along, does not <hi rend="italic">much</hi> obstruct the grammatical perspecuity [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>]; and in the burlesque parts the jingle of it at the end of the lines has a gratifying effect on me. I, even I, find some benefit in rhymes on such occasions. The serious passages again, which in themselves are the truest as well as far the worthiest, I could have liked better to see still in prose,&#x2014;if it were Sterlingean prose. This is the naked truth; tho&#x2019; you will not believe much of it, but will only believe that I believed it. For the rest, I like the burle<supplied>[s]</supplied>que too, think it good of its kind, and that, as I said, the rhyme has a good effect on it. But in the <hi rend="italic">serious</hi> there struggles a great meaning, seizable here only in straggling glimpses, obstructed altogether by the form of the composition, and generally out of place when you do seize it.</p>
<p>The master-fault of the Piece, hear it my Friend with a frown, is, as ever, that it <hi rend="italic">is too easily born</hi>. Could I enwrap <hi rend="italic">you</hi> in <hi rend="italic">one</hi> of the thick atrabiliary cloaks-of-darkness that envelope my poor self, cloak above cloak, till my light seems quenched for most part as in London fog, and all utterance of myself is so inexpressibly difficult, inexpressibly hateful,&#x2014;what a fellow I should make of you! I would sink this Piece down into the <hi rend="italic">Orcus</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A god of the underworld.</note> of your soul, and it should not spring up but with a fight at every step; and arise at last a shorter and a wiser Poem! But it may not be. Who knows how much of your gift were inconsistent with such wrappages and practices, and might expire in such handling?</p>
<p>As it stands, your <hi rend="italic">Story</hi> in this <hi rend="italic">Election</hi> is eminently loose-jointed, improbable, not to say incredible; your <hi rend="italic">earnest</hi> does not cohere with your <hi rend="italic">sport</hi> (indeed they would be terribly difficult to make cohere <pb id="pg-12-322" n="12:322"/>well), the <hi rend="italic">earnest</hi> is too long, and nothing to the purpose in hand for most part;&#x2014;in short the whole thing coheres very loosely, or is incoherent; and only by natural worth of material <hi rend="italic">forces</hi> some pleasure on you,&#x2014;no inconsiderable pleasure.</p>
<p>On the whole what is to be done? I am clear that the thing see the light, under one condition or another. As a separate volume in its present form, I should say, Questionable, or even Unquestionable. Will Blackwood print it? It might do better there than elsewhere; if, as is perhaps likely, you want no more trouble with it. I know not that I would recommend <hi rend="italic">very</hi> much more trouble now; you have my thoughts above, as to that, <foreign>pro</foreign> and <foreign>contra</foreign>. Consider, however (even for Blackwood), whether your young lady, whom I decidedly like, would not be better to have a longer <hi rend="italic">shift</hi> on her,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC relented in the <hi rend="italic">Life</hi>, and quoted the lines in bk. 5 about Anne undressing with some relish: &#x201C;But Anne, at last her mute devotions o&#x2019;er, / Perceived the fact she had forgot before / Of her too shocking nudity; &#x2026; / She blew the light out, and escaped to bed.&#x201D; On the question of publication he reported that &#x201C;the Piece was thrown away and taken up again, at intervals; and the question, Publish or not publish? lay many months undecided&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 11:219, 204). It was not pbd. in <hi rend="italic">Blackwood&#x2019;s</hi>.</note> if indeed she have rightly any shift at present! Whether Vane&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Life</hi><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A substantial part of bks. 3 and 6.</note> be not for most part a superfetation; far too long, for any thing he ever did or suffered; eminently unsuitable for <hi rend="italic">courting</hi> with &#x26;c &#x26;c.</p>
<p>On the whole, and this is the sum of my advice, take <hi rend="italic">deep</hi> and ever deeper counsel with yourself, what it is that will really give <hi rend="italic">you</hi> most satisfaction in the ordering of this business (to print or not to print); and account that a greater fact than any other,&#x2014;if you can once ascertain it well. Do you really from the heart like this thing; or do you merely think and hope that others may like it &#x26;c? Doctors say the <hi rend="italic">real</hi> voice of the appetite is the best rule in Dietetics; but it has to be carefully discriminated from the superficial, transient fallacious voice, which declares for gingerbread, peppercake, comfits and the like!</p>
<p>You see what a pen I have; in what impetuous velocity I must write! You have the rudest thoughts of my heart; all the truer for that, if you can read them. <foreign>Adieu</foreign>, my friend; and a <hi rend="italic">wise</hi> decision to you, be it in any sense or not in mine.</p>
<closer><salute>Yours ever /</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle.</name>
<ps><p>P.S. Do you mean to entitle yourself <hi rend="italic">The Rev</hi>d J. Sterling still! It is awfully heterodox much of that quizzing; tho&#x2019; to me all the welcomer.</p>
<p>What am I to <hi rend="italic">do</hi> with the four copybooks?</p>
<p><pb id="pg-12-323" n="12:323"/>[Additional Comments]<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sterling has headed this separate page &#x201C;Received <date when="1840-11-16">Nov<hi rend="italic">r</hi>. 16&#x2014;1840</date>.&#x201D;</note></p>
<p>Not &#x201C;more earnestness and strength&#x201D;; no, but more perfection and consistency; making <hi rend="italic">this</hi> thing more what <hi rend="italic">it</hi> means to be.</p>
<p><title>&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;</title></p>
<p>The Story?</p>
<p>There is no reason assigned, or easily conceivable, why Vane (for example) might not have driven leisurely over to Aleborough, and proposed for the young lady, and <hi rend="italic">got</hi> her&#x2014;with a bounty; without any Election at all! Pray remedy <hi rend="italic">this;</hi> it is remediable. Much else of the story is dramatic, lively, good;&#x2014;much else too, as it now stands, <hi rend="italic">not</hi>.</p>
<p><title/>&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>
<p>The Life?</p>
<p>There is no incident in it; nothing done; it amounts to <hi rend="italic">no</hi> life: the man has looked at Alpine chasms, some picture-galeries; <hi rend="italic">been</hi> in love (no recommendation to him in Miss Ann&#x2019;s case); had money dropt into his mouth; and, after looking at the wrecks of an Auction,&#x2014;is here! It is no life, and yet is the good <hi rend="italic">abstraction</hi> of a life and Sterling can make it the <hi rend="italic">concretion</hi> of one,&#x2014;and shall.</p>
<p><title/>&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>
<p>Not like Swift, like me, like anybody; only like Sterling, but <hi rend="italic">like</hi> him: let it <hi rend="italic">be</hi> the pure essence of <hi rend="italic">him</hi>.</p>
<p><title>&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;</title></p>
<p>In a word, pass the whole business rigorously thro&#x2019; your limbecks once more; produce it not till rectified, clarified, that all men at taste thereof may say, &#x201C;Yea, verily!&#x201D;&#x2014; And so Heaven love you, and whatsoever you do!</p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>You have got nothing from me of late but mere <hi rend="italic">offputs</hi> of Letters: I ought to write you Letters; I can do nothing else for you! Today I call myself as usual extremely busy; but is there any likelihood that I shall be <hi rend="italic">less</hi> busy soon? I will send you a line today, were I twice as busy: I privately determined upon it last night, while I smoked my last pipe! I smoke this pipe, sitting on the <hi rend="italic">floor</hi> (usually) with my <hi rend="italic">side</hi> to one of <pb id="pg-12-324" n="12:324"/>the jambs, by the embers of the dining-room fire, when all has gone to sleep around me; and things far off and dear to me, and Scotsbrig always among the number, come masquerading thro&#x2019; my head and heart.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Margaret A. Carlyle wrote, <date when="1840-11-20">20 Nov.</date>: &#x201C;I often think on you when I am taking my smoke at bed time.&#x201D;</note></p>
<p>Yesterday was the fiercest day of wind and rain I ever saw here (Friday); indeed almost or altogether as fierce a day as I ever saw anywhere. We never stirred out of doors at all. The rain beat harmless against the windows; only set us thinking, what are they doing with such a Southwester against the gable at Scotsbrig yonder? What is all the world doing; on wild mountains, on roaring seas? I fear much mischief has been done. Nobody came to us, nor have we yet seen anybody. Today is bright as diamonds, all clear and dry even under foot; the streets here are all as of sand, and drink in any quantity of moisture, especially if the wind favour. We are all as if new-washed.&#x2014; Jack has not written again since he got to Linton; he was writing to you, he said, while last writing to me there:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;I had a letter from John the same day I got your last [this letter]. He has been very mindfull in writing&#x201D; (Margaret A. Carlyle, <date when="1840-11-20">20 Nov.</date>).</note> I fancy you would like as well yesterday that he was not steaming or sailing, but sitting as we could conceive by the side of a warm fire! I wrote to him directly after getting his Letter; and expect most probably to hear from him in the beginning of the week. He had no more travelling to execute that would be of any difficulty.</p>
<p>Our Meal-barrel is now expected daily, or almost daily. Alick&#x2019;s Letter gave us a sketch of the contents. Last night, in the middle of the rain, there came a Barrel of Potatoes to us from Kirkcaldy;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >From the Ferguses. Alick&#x2019;s letter (not found) had arrived <date when="1840-11-05">5 Nov.</date></note> we almost <hi rend="italic">feared</hi> it had been the meal, in so bad a night for it. We have taken lately again to porridge, even on London shop-meal, the dearest and the worst of its kind to be found in this Island.</p>
<p>Lately I had a Letter from Mr Stewart of Gillenbie, about Craigenputtoch, which there seems no speedy prospect of selling. He takes occasion to mention Austin and Mary; and praises them both for their management, seemingly very sincerely. I clipt out the passage of his sheet, and enclosed it to Mary the other day.</p>
<p>Nothing new occurs with me here, or <hi rend="italic">as little</hi> as I can possibly manage to make it! I keep away from all noises as much as in me lies; generally refuse every invitation (not judged <hi rend="italic">in</hi>despensable [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>]); much seldomer go into the heart of London at all, but prefer walking about the Parks and Lanes. I get far more profit silently communing with <pb id="pg-12-325" n="12:325"/>myself than from the gabble of most I could meet. It is absolutely indispensable for me to be <hi rend="italic">alone</hi> a great part of my time; I go all to weeds and rubbish otherwise! The clatter of other people does not <hi rend="italic">increase</hi> one, does not alter one at all: if all the earth will fling their caps up about a man, the poor man himself remains just 5 feet ten inches high; if no mortal fling his cap up, the man still measures the same! Ah, me; Eternity is round about us all: the whole world with all the good or all the ill it can do, and the loudest noises it can make, will soon be silent, small!&#x2014; On the whole, I am best, as James Aitken said, &#x201C;to work ay mostly in a place by mysel&#x2019;.&#x201D; I have strong thick shoes that fear no mud; I wear <hi rend="italic">inward</hi> flannel (a knit woolen jacket like yours), and am warm without heavy greatcoats or any wrappage as yet; I can walk far, much farther I often find than last year. I have great reason to be thankful for very many things,&#x2014;perhaps for my <hi rend="italic">weak nerves</hi> and sad stomach among the rest! I read very many books; my whole work at present is reading. Perhaps I shall get out another Book by and by. But we will not hurry about that. I am no longer in absolute fear of coming to want; cash enough to go on with, to bid <hi rend="italic">such</hi> a Fear begone for a saucy <foreign>hallanshaker</foreign> [vagabond] that has insulted me too long! The business is to write a right Book, not a swift-selling Book, or any other sort of Book.</p>
<p>Dear Mother, I wish I could get a long account from you, of all that you are doing, and thinking! You cannot write so easily as I, or you would, I know. I ought to be thankful that you write at all; that I can hear so much of you. I figure you in the end-room yonder, many and many a time; there burns no <hi rend="italic">candle</hi> under the wide canopy of Night so interesting to me as that of yours in the little brass candlestick, with my good Mother sitting by it, a wise brave woman, wise, brave, silently trustful in God in her old days as in her young. God is there as well as here; merciful and great above us all: one has no other composing thought in this wild whirl of life and death. Our heart cries, Have Thou Mercy on us all!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I will write no more today. It is time I should get out, and have a long, long walk. The mist will sink (if the wind fail) about four o&#x2019;clock, and there will be no good walking. Farewell, dear Mother. Blessings on every one of you. Jane is gone out, and her regards must be understood. <closer><salute>Your affectionate Son</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I send you off today with all brevity the inclosed Letters, to keep you in a kind of entertainment for a minute or two. The American pair you may return.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found or identified.</note> They came along with your own an hour ago.</p>
<p>We were longing for this Letter of yours<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> before it would arrive. A small word now is better than none. On friday last, which was far the worst day for wind and rain I ever saw here, I often thought how it was with <hi rend="italic">you</hi> at Linton, getting it all fresh from the very mouth of the Southwest. Had you still had any occasion for sailing, I could have got into all manner of hypochondriacal suppositions, in the way our good Mother does. I wrote to her on Saturday somewhat at large; you should send off a despatch too, to say that all is well.&#x2014; The <hi rend="italic">mud</hi> is surely a great grievance; I found it last year make all riding detestable here at this season. You will get to Wight I hope before very long: meanwhile the lightening of your charge by the presence of your Patients relatives will be a kind of compensation.</p>
<p>My reading goes on, my stupidity seems to increase with it. More and more I get to see that no <hi rend="italic">History</hi> in the strict sense <hi rend="italic">can</hi> be made of <hi rend="italic">that</hi> unspeakable puddle of a time, all covered up with things entirely obsolete for us&#x2014;a Golgotha of Dead Dogs! But some kind of <hi rend="italic">Book</hi> can be made? That is the question, that we are still looking to.</p>
<p>Jane has had a long negociation with Fraser about publishing the <hi rend="italic">Lectures</hi> for a sum of money down; money down is a thing Fraser stands aghast at,&#x2014;would fain make demonstrations, politenesses &#x26;c stand instead of it: the negociation has ended; the <hi rend="italic">Ms</hi>. has come <hi rend="italic">back</hi>. Saunders &#x26; Otley do offer me &#xa3;50 for an edition of 750! There is happily no haste to publish the thing at all. I consider it a paltry thing; really care not if it were burnt: till some stronger temptation outward or inward arise, we will let it lie there. What a strength it is to have a little sum of money before one&#x2019;s hand; not to stand any more between the great angry tide of Beggary close-flowing in your rear and the open throat of carnivorous Booksellers waiting for you in front!</p>
<p>Today Jane goes to call for Miss Anderson of Stroquhan, poor woman, who seems to live now about Islington (tutoring some yellow or black children of her Brother&#x2019;s, as we understand); a most melancholy wreck of baffled pride,&#x2014;sullen, bare, ceremonious narrow, like <pb id="pg-12-327" n="12:327"/>an old whinstone Border-tower! She would call us nothing but <hi rend="italic">Sir</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Ma&#x2019;am</hi>; she, at parting, omitted not a stately express remembrance (nay I do believe a kind one withal) of you. How help <hi rend="italic">her?</hi> Poor woman! Of Andrew &#x26;c there was no hint.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >She was the sister of Rev.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Your Note, some considerable while ago, taught us to expect the Provision Cargo; I delayed answering till it should arrive. Last night, in the middle of rain and wind, very frequent at present, the long-looked-for came: returning from a desperate piece of walking <hi rend="italic">after dark</hi>, which the day&#x2019;s continual storm had reduced me to, I found Pickford&#x2019;s Waggon drawn up at the door; and the Annandale Barrel getting itself lodged in a place they call the &#x201C;china closet.&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On the ground floor between the dining room and garden.</note> We were right glad to see it. I take the first post to certify you that it has come; your kindness will not consider itself as <hi rend="italic">complete</hi> till you know that. The arrow shot never so rightly out of the bow, one wants to ascertain that it has <hi rend="italic">hit</hi>.</p>
<p>I speedily burst up the Barrel; found the interior, as we may say, <hi rend="italic">all right</hi>. Poor Jenny&#x2019;s Pot of Honey was indeed all gone to squelch,&#x2014;alas and woe&#x2019;s me! But that was the <hi rend="italic">only</hi> thing that had run wrong. <pb id="pg-12-328" n="12:328"/>We found, they had had the Barrel lying on its <hi rend="italic">side</hi> (for they turn these things in all ways, and indeed this Cask was set down here <hi rend="italic">bottom uppermost</hi>, and I almost began opening it from that end); now, lying on its side, in the bouncing and shaking of the Ship, our oatmeal had more or less given way, till the two <hi rend="italic">pigs</hi> [earthenware pots] came in contact, and the small honey one was squelched to atoms under the big butter one. Jane lamented much, for she could still taste that the honey had been excellent. It was all run out now; most of it into the side of the sack; the rest of it had formed a kind of honey-<hi rend="italic">paste</hi> about the fragments of the crockery, on the cheese, even on the little ragstone [whetstone]: itself lost, and a handful or two of meal with it; no other mischief whatever done! Jane thought it altogether lucky that no drop had got into the straw of the bonnet; but had all been arrested by the paper, and done no ill there either. The white stockings she thinks are the prettiest she ever saw. My stockings too are a superb lot and of the right kind; I only grieve that they must have cost my good Mother so much money. We had right porridge last night; the meal, you can tell Jamie, is unsurpassable. The <hi rend="italic">Peppers</hi> [Peppermints], tell Jane, were safe! The Bacon too was disclosed this morning, and is said to promise to promise [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] to be admirable; I will tell you when I write next. In short, it is all safe and right; and we shall think often of the kind souls in Annandale to whom we owe it all, who grudge no trouble for us at any time.</p>
<p>It is not long, not above three days I think, since I wrote to my Mother, with the current of my news. Nothing but wet blustery weather since out of doors; within doors hardly any novelty whatever. I sit steadily reading. I fancy myself perceptibly better in health than I used to be in the last and former winters. It is the effect of my summer&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">riding</hi> perhaps. By the bye, these good Marshall&#x2019;s have sold my horse for me; I wrote requesting them to give the price away to the Anti Corn-law Union,&#x2014;not thinking it perfectly genteel to pocket any of it, under all the circumstances: but they would not; they mean to &#x201C;retain it for getting me some more riding <hi rend="italic">next</hi> spring&#x201D;;&#x2014;to which what can one do but answer vaguely with many true thanks! Old Mr Marshall<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Marshall.</note> is a kind, wiseheaded, just old man; silent, almost <foreign><hi rend="italic">blate</hi></foreign> [shy] as a young lad; and rich, I believe, with some &#xa3;80,000 a year. I enclose the Son&#x2019;s last Note about that business; and have left it as you see it there.&#x2014; My reading is not sore work; it is the <hi rend="italic">easiest</hi> kind of life, indeed, that one can have; easier than very idleness. I do not yet see what sort of result will come of it; but some result will perhaps come.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-12-329" n="12:329"/>Since the Letter to my Mother there has arrived a Letter from the Doctor at Linton. He is roaming about on that Southwest Coast; riding on &#x201C;grass-fed ponies&#x201D; &#x26;c: it is very solitary, he says, and muddy, but his Patient has relations there: I fancy they will get to Wight by and by, and then I may hope to meet poor Jack again. He has had a most wandering year since he rolled off from this door! He makes a great deal of money; and having himself such an appetite for travel, and an incapability as yet of fixing anywhere, we ought to esteem him very lucky.</p>
<p>Jean sent me a short Note<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> this morning, about some cash accounts &#x26;c. She complains that she has heard nothing from our Mother or any of you for a long while. I too begin to be impatient. I wonder what is becoming of you all in these dismal tempest<supplied>[s]</supplied>. It is the roughest, wettest weather I have yet seen in any winter here. It nearly equals Puttoch in all its glory&#x2014;with the addition of an unparallelled [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] <foreign><hi rend="italic">glar</hi></foreign> [mud], which we had mostly got the better of there. Poor Puttoch; how far off is it now, are those old years now! They will forever be memorable to us all.</p>
<p>This is a far longer Letter than you have written to me, my dear Brother, for many a month. You should take pen, and write largely! I know you are like to be sadly interrupted; but you would learn to write in spite of that. I long to hear what aspect your business offers to you; what comfort you yourself are able to adjust out of it, that is the main question of all. &#x201C;Better a <foreign>wee</foreign> bush than no <foreign>bield</foreign> [shelter],&#x201D; in these times! I believe the distress of the lower classes is great and pitiable; small hope of remedy soon. Did you notice that of the people at Stockport murdering their own children to swindle some club out of the burial-fees! It is like what we read of in the uttermost misery prophecied against the Jews: &#x201C;the hands of the pitiful women have sodden their own children,&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lam. 4:10. The <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, <date when="1840-10-23">23 Oct.</date> and <date when="1840-11-02">2 Nov.</date>, carried reports of the deaths, apparently by poison, of two children, and of the coroner&#x2019;s jury finding that, as well as the parents, Ann and Robert Sandys, George and Honor Sandys were also guilty of willful murder or of aiding and abetting. It was assumed that the children had been killed for the &#xa3;3 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. due for each from the burial club. But at their trial in <date when="1841-08-00">Aug. 1841</date> all four were found not guilty of the murder of one of the children, and only Robert Sandys guilty of the murder of the second (<hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, <date when="1840-08-04">4</date>&#x2013;<date when="1840-08-06">6 Aug.</date>). TC relied on the first report of the case in <hi rend="italic">Past and Present, Works</hi> 10:4.</note>&#x2014;boiled them for food, in the extremity of siege and famine! Granting these Stockport people to be the perfection of blackguards and wretches, that helps the matter but little. It remains every way among the frightfullest things ever written of a Country or a time.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-12-330" n="12:330"/>I must end here. I will write to my Mother, or some other of you, before many days. We have not <hi rend="italic">tried</hi> any of the wares yet except the oatmeal; this is not to be omitted in making the report: tonight the butter will be tried, tomorrow the bacon.&#x2014; Jane is not here; but with some company or other (as I <hi rend="italic">think</hi>, but care not to verify lest they seize me too) up stairs: she ought to answer about her stockings &#x26;c herself.</p>
<p>Ask Tom what progress he is making in the elementary parts of learning? What he expects to have to say for himself when I see him next year? The idle dog that he is!&#x2014; I bid good be with you all, dear Alick, for this time. <closer><salute>I am always</salute></closer></p>

I have little doubt they will do great good in New Zealand.</p>
<p>Your <hi rend="italic">Neal</hi>, your <hi rend="italic">Baxter</hi> stand here these many months; not entirely idly of late months.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For Daniel Neal and Richard Baxter, see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400106-TC-JOST-01">TC to <sic>JS</sic><corr>JOST</corr>, <date when="1840-01-06">6 Jan.</date></ref>, and <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400919-TC-JOST-01"><date when="1840-09-19">19 Sept.</date></ref></note> Dull both; dull as Lethe; but not to be dispensed with.

<p>Do you know St Catherine Creed [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] Church, which Archbishop Laud dedicated in that famous fashion?<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Catherine Cree (or Christ Church), on the N side of Leadenhall St., was rebuilt in <date when="1629-00-00">1629</date> and reconsecrated by William Laud, then bishop of London, <date when="1630-01-16">16 Jan. 1630</date>&#x2013;<date when="1631-00-00">31</date>. The story told about Laud&#x2019;s dedication was that there were persons stationed at the doors of the church to call with a loud voice on his approach, &#x201C;Open, open, ye everlasting doors, that the King of Glory may enter in.&#x201D; When Laud had reached the interior, he fell on his knees and, lifting his hands, exclaimed, &#x201C;This place is holy, the ground is holy; in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, I pronounce it holy&#x201D;; then throwing dust from the ground into the air, he bowed to the chancel, and went in procession round the church (John Timbs, <hi rend="italic">Curiosities of London</hi> [London, <date when="1868-00-00">1868</date>] 156).</note> I think it was not burnt in <pb id="pg-12-331" n="12:331"/>the great Fire, but still stands somewhere in your region. I have thoughts of making a pilgrimage to it. Can you tell me of any wise word that has been written <hi rend="italic">in behalf</hi> of poor Laud; or at least of the <hi rend="italic">wisest</hi> word? I have read <hi rend="italic">Heylin</hi>, faithfully read it all; but it, alas, is little other than a &#x201C;Golgotha of Dead Dogs&#x201D; for me!</p>
<p>Next week, or soon, on some as yet unappointed day, I have to be in the City; and mean to try whether I cannot get across the River before returning.</p>

<p><closer><salute>Yours always /</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name><note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Maurice had recently written to his wife about Sewell&#x2019;s article: &#x201C;I was reading the article on Carlyle in the &#x2018;Quarterly&#x2019; to H. last night. We were interrupted, and therefore I did not come to what I suppose is the objectionable part. As far as I read I agreed with it entirely, and thought it beautiful. I cannot help thinking that Carlyle is a little nettled at the tolerance and kindness of it. Others, besides Churchmen, have been struck with it, the Scotts and Mrs. Rich, to wit; they say they think the criticism on Carlyle admirable, and the feeling of the whole article delightful, though they cannot agree in his remedies for the evils which he and Carlyle lament. What these are I do not know, but if his writing is to be called roaring, and Carlyle&#x2019;s plain sense, I must think that the words have changed their meaning since I was a child. I have no prejudice in favour of Sewell, and expected not to like the article, so my judgment is not an unfair one&#x201D; (<date when="1840-10-17">17 Oct.</date>); and &#x201C;I dare say your criticism on Sewell&#x2019;s article is correct, but I thought, on the whole, that he took a very generous and yet accurate measurement of Carlyle&#x201D; (<date when="1840-10-29">29 Oct.</date>). Earlier this year he had written to Edward Strachey: &#x201C;men are beginning to talk and cant after him in all directions. Sewell, I hear, denounces him in his lectures, and Whewell is very indignant, and believes he is doing the greatest mischief. Hare has much the same opinion. &#x2026; Therefore I object to Sewell, Whewell, and Hare. &#x2026; <supplied>[T]</supplied>he best &#x2026; is, when he comes naturally in one&#x2019;s way, to say kindly and honestly what one thinks of him&#x201D; (<date when="1840-04-05">5 April</date>); and &#x201C;The subject of Carlyle oftentimes oppresses me with great sadness, and I would not wish to speak of it, though this resolution cannot be kept, at least in London, at this time, among the persons I chiefly see; for all are much interested in Carlyle&#x201D; (<date when="1840-05-04">4 May</date>).

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>You seem to be pretty well supplied with Letters from the Doctor at present; so that perhaps this, which arrived some hours ago, is a superfluity. Nevertheless, now that you can have it for a penny, why should I not send it to you?&#x2014; Jack is coming eastward to the Isle of <pb id="pg-12-332" n="12:332"/>Wight; to set off on Monday. If he were once over the Devonshire Hills, it is all a plain sheltered country, and travelling may be still almost pleasant,&#x2014;especially if you have cash enough and a carriage of your own! Wight is the pleasantest place in all the British Isles, and has a winter milder than any other. I wish Scotsbrig with all the <foreign><hi rend="italic">etceteras</hi></foreign> could be flown away down thither!&#x2014; But why do you not write to the poor Doctor? Why do you not write to me?<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >She had just written him a fairly long letter dated <date when="1840-11-20">20 Nov.</date></note> Even Jean complains that she does not hear of you. I had a letter from Mary<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> this morning; she mentions that Alick and Jamie were there very shortly before; that all was &#x201C;as usual&#x201D;; that you and they were &#x201C;going to drink tea with the Minister.&#x201D; From which I thankfully infer that nothing had gone far wrong.</p>
<p>We are rejoicing here in the possession of excellent materials for eating and wearing, which came in the Barrel. The meal makes admirable porridge. Butter and cheese, tell Isabella, give perfect satisfaction; especially the butter, the most important article of the two, far excels any that we can count on here, and indeed is itself not to be excelled. The Newcastle rag-stone deserves an especial word of thanks: I suppose it was Jamie&#x2019;s act the remembering of that! Tell Alick we have tried the bacon now, and pronounce it of first quality, many thanks to him. Finally, dear Mother, I have had on <hi rend="italic">the stockings;</hi> I daily wear a pair of them when I go out to walk; they are as good as can be woven,&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">better</hi> to me, considering where they came from! It is curious enough that I was specially in want of <hi rend="italic">thin</hi> wool stockings; <hi rend="italic">not</hi> of thick: I wear the thick only within doors now, and find it answer better for the feet. I will announce to Jack his share of the booty. For my own part, taking my choice, I have preferred the <hi rend="italic">lavender</hi>-grey sort; leaving Jack the six pairs of <hi rend="italic">blue</hi>-grey: if he complain, I will tell him he ought to have been on the spot, looking after his own interest! Again and again, dear Mother, I give you thanks. It was a pity to lay out money to such extent;&#x2014;but what can I say? Probably <hi rend="italic">you</hi> too got more good of it that way than in another.</p>
<p>Our weather is incessantly blustering and broken at present: nevertheless we hold out handsomely. I believe I am really rather better this year than of late years; better at the heart of me,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; on the outer surface there is still biliousness &#x26;c &#x26;c in sufficiency. But I can walk farther, and the like: the other week, by way of a right spell of exercise, I walked to Hampton Court Palace and back again, a distance of more than twenty miles, one day.&#x2014; What a pen!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC had struck out a badly formed word just before &#x201C;back again.&#x201D;</note> My time too is done, <pb id="pg-12-333" n="12:333"/>and <hi rend="italic">more</hi>.&#x2014; I want to know what is becoming of poor little Tom and his leg.&#x2014; I commission somebody to write me a Letter. Take care of yourself, dear Mother, in this wild blustery weather; never go out without effectual wrappages; a good fire within; and study your diet more minutely than you are wont. This last is an important precept,&#x2014;as you, if you were advising <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, would know right well, tho&#x2019; you heed it too little for yourself.</p>
<p>Jane salutes you all with kind thanks. Good be among you. When you see Jenny, tell her to be a good <foreign>bairn</foreign>, and not suspect me of forgetting her! <foreign>Adieu</foreign> dear Mother; not another word.</p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Here is your kind and good little Letter come to hand this morning; a thing long-looked-for, bringing good news; one of the welcomest things! I return you many thanks. You too, I think, would get a little Note from me this morning: we must have been writing to one another at the same time.&#x2014; I like well to hear of your spinning on the big wheel;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC&#x2019;s mother had written, <date when="1840-11-20">20 Nov.</date>, &#x201C;I am spinning of the big wheell it procures me sleep do you sleep well.&#x201D;</note> you always like to see yourself <hi rend="italic">doing something;</hi> that will be a good dry employment in the dark weather;&#x2014;only I hope you will not overdo it: <hi rend="italic">three cuts</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A variable measure of yarn.</note> a-day, I think, in such a dark season, will be an abundant task. You ask, How I sleep? Better, than I have often done; better, I doubt, than you sometimes do. Besides, now they get me my breakfast with altogether amazing despatch, even if I do get up too early: this is a great accommodation to me; for I can then begin work, and do not mind having risen early.</p>
<p>This is not to count as a Letter from me; it is only a chance word,&#x2014;the day is rapidly declining; I shall get no walking if I make it more! But Jack&#x2019;s new Note<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> arrived along with yours; intimating that his travel was already about as good as <hi rend="italic">done:</hi> this I thought would be a <hi rend="italic">penniworth</hi> for you; so here it goes, and this poor poor word along with it. You need not make yourself anxious, therefore, about Jack&#x2019;s journey, for it is already accomplished. The place he dates from (Weymouth) is a town on the <hi rend="italic">Southern</hi> Coast (all the Devonshire and other Hills fairly behind it), and not above fifty miles or so from the place <pb id="pg-12-334" n="12:334"/>he aimed at. They must be resting somewhere today about Lymington or that neighbourhood; which is almost within sight of Ryde. The next Letter, we may fairly hope, will tell us that <hi rend="italic">this</hi> years travel has fairly managed itself, and there is now to be a little <hi rend="italic">rest</hi>.</p>
<p>Yesterday was a clear brisk day, a considerable breeze of wind from the North, and many paths tolerably dry. I had a solitary walk of three hours, which has done me good. I have a good enough brown great-coat, with other apparel, in which I button myself more to my mind than usual,&#x2014;for the Cockney <hi rend="italic">Snips</hi> [tailors] do not often satisfy me well: I am very warm as I go about, and yet not overloaded with clothes.</p>
<p>I have to go and dine to-day with the old Poet Rogers, of whom you have perhaps heard me speak: a pale, baldheaded, sagacious kindly old man, whom I like to see sometimes, in spite of all his <hi rend="italic">flunkies</hi>. He does not build upon his wealth, indeed; yet is very rich.&#x2014; I have refused <hi rend="italic">all</hi> dinners for the last six weeks or more.</p>
<p>In a day or two, some of you will, likely, hear from me again.&#x2014; No more at all now,&#x2014;lest the daylight entirely vanish!</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Your Weymouth Letter reached me yesterday. If you accomplished your purpose for Sunday, getting to Lymington as you proposed, you must have ample means to be in Ryde at your journey&#x2019;s end before this reach you. I fancy you to be there perhaps even now. It gives me no little satisfaction to consider that your wandering is now over, and has settled you for a space of rest in a corner so near me. I imagine Wight to be the elegiblest of all places for passing these dim months;&#x2014;not enveloped in fog, drizzle, and <foreign>glar</foreign> [mud], as we here; but with a fresh sea round you, with glimpses of blue sky, and some constant evidence that this Earth and her Seasons still exist. I shall be impatient to learn minutely how you are situated, what kind of house you have got &#x26;c <pb id="pg-12-335" n="12:335"/>&#x26;c.&#x2014; Fraser&#x2019;s Books did not come hither; they are lying in his Repositories; I saw one of the bound volumes of <hi rend="italic">Goethe;</hi> he was doing my Goethe and some other books of mine, and shewed it me as a specimen. If I can afford you any aid in getting books or otherwise, speak. There are two of Jean Paul&#x2019;s Novels here, <hi rend="italic">Hesperus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Titan</hi>,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Hesperus</hi> (Berlin, <date when="1795-00-00">1795</date>) and <hi rend="italic">Titan</hi> (Berlin, <date when="1800-00-00">1800</date>&#x2013;<date when="1803-00-00">3</date>).</note> which I think you never read: would you like to try them?</p>
<p>A Note from Mary, and then yesterday another from our good Mother, are my news from Annandale: I enclose them both here. My Mother speaks as if one of hers to you had been <hi rend="italic">lost</hi> about Bangor? Poor body, she seems to be as well as we could expect: it is infinitely affecting to me often to think of her yonder. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Tempus edax</hi></foreign> [Time the devourer]!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ovid, <hi rend="italic">Metamorphoses</hi> 15:234.</note> We have no <hi rend="italic">continuing</hi> here,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Heb. 13:14.</note> no halt in this march of ours: on, on! Some God did make us, will assuredly provide for us what is <hi rend="italic">best</hi>. One has no other anchorage; it is a frightful waste of world-devouring quick sands otherwise.</p>
<p>In the Annandale Barrel were twelve pairs of nice fine-spun Hawick socks from our Mother; six pairs of them for you. They are of a blue grey colour; comfortable for wearing. Yours lie in your old drawer up aloft. Would you like them sent?</p>
<p>My reading progresses, with or without fixed hope. I struggled thro&#x2019; the <hi rend="italic">Eikon Basilike</hi> yesterday: one of the paltriest pieces of vapid, shovelhatted, clear-starched, immaculate falsity and cant I have ever read. It is to me an amazement how any mortal could ever have taken that for a genuine Book of King Charles&#x2019;s. Nothing but a surpliced Pharisee sitting at his ease afar off could have got up such a set of &#x201C;meditations.&#x201D; It got Parson Gauden<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Gauden (<date when="1605-00-00">1605</date>&#x2013;<date when="1662-00-00">62</date>), chaplain to the Earl of Warwick, <date when="1640-00-00">1640</date>; bishop of Exeter, <date when="1660-00-00">1660</date>, and of Worcester, <date when="1662-00-00">1662</date>; he claimed to be the author of the <hi rend="italic">Eikon Basilike</hi>, for which see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400928-TC-JF-01">TC to JF, [<date when="1840-09-28">28 Sept.</date>]</ref>.</note> a Bishoprick; it remains as an offence to all genuine men (a small minority still) for some time yet.&#x2014; The writing of that Book, if I ever write it, will be considerably the hardest feat I have attempted hitherto.</p>
<p>Last night, greatly against wont, I went out to dine with Rogers. Milman, Babbage, Pickwick, Lyell the Geologist<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charles Lyell (<date when="1797-00-00">1797</date>&#x2013;<date when="1875-00-00">1875</date>), eminent geologist. Dickens (Pickwick) was busy with the <hi rend="italic">Old Curiosity Shop</hi> at this time.</note> &#x26;c with sundry indifferent-favoured women. A dull evening; not worth awakening for, at four in the morning with the dance of All the Devils round you!&#x2014; Pickwick seemed to me looking wrinkly, rusty a little: he is not nothing, yet neither is he much. Babbage continues eminently unpleasant <pb id="pg-12-336" n="12:336"/>to me, with his frog mouth and viper eyes, with his hidebound wooden irony, and the acridest egoism looking thro&#x2019; it. Old Rogers himself is growing deaf; is still brisk, courteous, kindly-affectioned; a good old man,&#x2014;pathetic to look upon there!&#x2014; I have to go out, to see after several things; perhaps to the Museum all the way. We have a glimpse of sunshine; for which let us be thankful. On Sunday I walked three hours, by Holland House, Notting Hill, and out Harrow-ward thro&#x2019; the fields. It did me good. I am tolerably clad for winter this year: with a close waistcoat buttoning up single-breasted accurately to the very stock, then a thin film coat <supplied>[w]</supplied>hich<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >MS torn here and in several places in the rest of this paragraph.</note> I used to wear in summer, and the great-coat tight-buttoned over all [word(s) missing] <supplied>[tolera]</supplied>bly well, and can walk a long way when the <hi rend="italic">wind</hi> serves. I [word(s) missing]ne; a great deal of solitude I find indispensable for my health of mind. The generality of men have no <hi rend="italic">sincerity</hi> in their speech; no sense or profit in it: you are better listening to the inarticulate winds; regulating, if you can, the dog-kennel of your <hi rend="italic">own</hi> heart!</p>
<p>John Sterling was to go on Friday last to Torquay, there to abide till he saw whether Italy were indispensable. W. Cunningham is wedded, and has his Wife now in Town. The old <foreign><hi rend="italic">Stimabile</hi></foreign> reports of her mainly in shrugs, in turnings up of the eyes. Mrs Sterling says she will do admirably well. Why not?&#x2014; I am again at the bottom of my paper. <foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Brother. Let me hear from you soon,&#x2014;good news, I will hope.</p>

<salute>Dear Miss Jewsbury,</salute>
<p>Your house now set in order, you are asking yourself, How may the household of the mind be wisely ordered?<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >She had just moved to a smaller house because of her father&#x2019;s death in <date when="1840-08-00">Aug.</date></note> What thing, and course of things, were it now most of all for my advantage to do?&#x2014; It is a question infinitely momentous;&#x2014;as I say sometimes, &#x201C;We have waited a whole eternity to be born, and have now a whole eternity waiting to see what we will do when born!&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi> 90.</note> A question which the anxious inquirer, let others help as they will, has in the long-run to answer almost <pb id="pg-12-337" n="12:337"/>altogether for himself; to which there <hi rend="italic">is</hi> beforehand no definite complete answer; which indeed our whole Life is a <hi rend="italic">Life</hi> because it answers more and more. &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Do</hi> faithfully, with all thy might, what thy hand findeth to do&#x201D;:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Eccles. 9:10 and Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi> 197.</note> sufficient for <hi rend="italic">this</hi> day is such counsel; this day well spent will itself lend new counsel and clearness for the morrow. One has to discover what it is one most of all wishes; not what others fancy we may wish, what others will envy us for having &#x26;c &#x26;c: this once discovered, held steadily in view, and resolutely striven after, is a mighty point; a kind of pole-star in all our confused voyagings and accidents of sea and weather. Necessity and Chance will still play their part; but we too have there a part to play. There is much wisdom in what Goethe says somewhere to this effect: &#x201C;I honour him who has an aim, and walks towards it: what his aim is, whether good or worse, is but my second question.&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See TC&#x2019;s trans., <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister, Works</hi> 23:444&#x2013;45.</note> Nature would teach us, as she does the wild healthy creatures of the forest, if we could but listen to her,&#x2014;which indeed in the whirlpool of our artificialities it is sometimes difficult to do.</p>
<p>A considerable portion of your time will naturally lie open for reading, for self-cultivation in what is called Literature: this, with your faculties, with your wants, will probably continue one of your chief interests. Follow it out zealously, while strength and hope abide with you. One knows not what, or how much may come of it. The &#x201C;promised land&#x201D; proves indeed to be no land of emerald and asphodel, here more than elsewhere: yet I know not well what attainment or possession there is in life of a superior or equal value. The <hi rend="italic">intellect</hi> that is in us, called by what name we will, is <hi rend="italic">we</hi>, is a divine thing, forever miraculous and transcending all else. &#x201C;Ask of the Dead,&#x201D; says Plutarch&#x2019;s old oracle:<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not traced in Plutarch, but there is a Latin proverb, &#x201C;<foreign>optimi consilarii mortui</foreign> [the best advisers are the dead]&#x201D;; see also Francis Bacon, <hi rend="italic">Apophthegmes</hi> (London, <date when="1625-00-00">1625</date>) 129&#x2013;30: &#x201C;He was a great Necromancer, for that he used to ask counsell of the Dead: meaning Books.&#x201D;</note> Inquire and see how the Noble and the True, your Brethren of other countries and ages, led their Life; learn in many ways to lead your own thereby! Reading, speculative study, cannot do all; but it can do much; it is the best foundation for the doing of all.</p>
<p>And now what is it that you <hi rend="italic">like</hi> most to read; that you can get, and have the clearest desire to get? Old Johnson&#x2019;s rule is better than most others.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For the rule, see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400716-TC-GEJ-01">TC to GEJ, <date when="1840-07-16">16 July</date></ref>. Jewsbury had asked for advice about reading, and said that she hoped &#x201C;to get on with German.&#x201D;</note>&#x2014; As for my own experience, I should say <hi rend="italic">Histories</hi>, faithfully studied, which end in <hi rend="italic">Biographies</hi> as the flowers of History, have been <pb id="pg-12-338" n="12:338"/>the fruitfullest reading for me. Biographies are a kind of communing face to face with the Heroes and Teachers that have been; each of them still a kind of <hi rend="italic">Gospel</hi> to us. To understand Biographies rightly one requires Histories; some notion of the country and people in which the Biography lay. Histories I have always found should be read with at least <hi rend="italic">maps</hi> lying open before us; chronology, geography, travels &#x26;c, a multitude of subsidiary studies open with promise on us; for it is a solid study, and takes into question the whole man. In English we have some good Histories; in French some,&#x2014;especially innumerable <hi rend="italic">Memoirs</hi>, which are the pleasantest reading; the Germans too have their share. To whosoever would read much, and in any way make a business and interest of reading, I answer always: Read History, far and wide; and not read it only but study it; you will see there, from <hi rend="italic">all</hi> sides, innumerable vistas open on you.</p>
<p>But for you Literature is more than a Study or Instruction; it is to be a Prophecy for you. Well, my dear Friend, that is the way to find out the real Prophecy there is in it too! Read Poets, express Sages and Teachers; get closer and closer acquaintance with these: for me too I find all History with its <foreign><hi rend="italic">etceteras</hi></foreign> little other than the vestibule which is to lead me to these,&#x2014;or at most the temple wherein I am to inquire of these. These are the oracles; from these I gain what is to be gained of man;&#x2014;not all I want; alas, no; yet much that is infinitely precious to me.&#x2014; After all, who knows but the surest practical thing you could do at present would be to set effectually about the learning of German, and to learn it? I incline to think so, guessing as I can. Suppose you devote, with or even without the occasional aid of a teacher, <hi rend="italic">two hours</hi> every day to it? In some two months it will be free and open to you. You have then a Schiller, a Jean Paul, a Goethe to become acquainted with: they are well worth your looking at till you have seen them truly. Altogether in such difficulties as you now struggle in, have they struggled and <hi rend="italic">conquered:</hi> that is in brief their value for us. In no other modern Literature can you see such a phenomenon; at best, poor shadows of it; or perhaps (as in the modern French) distracted disgusting aperies of it.&#x2014; In a word, dear Scholar, see a little whitherward you are bound, then about all manner of details and indications question me as often as you like till farther help is not in me.</p>
<p>I by no means object to your choice of Heraud and his Substances or Shadows. Grant that they were but Phantasms, those notions of his, they will at least expel a balefuller set of opposing Shadows and Phantasms: I mean the horrible Nightmare which Physiology (as they still call it) lays on our souls, to the paralysis and almost extinction of them, in these days. I speak feelingly on this subject; the brutal martyrdom <pb id="pg-12-339" n="12:339"/>I suffered from it (in a most aggravating state of bodily disease too) is forever memorable. Death or some escape I believe to have been then the alternative; happily, thro&#x2019; slow toiling years, it proved escape,&#x2014;and no <hi rend="italic">re</hi>capture possible! But as I say Phantasm neutralises Phantasm in these things. On the whole, all that I have gained from an endless reading of Metaphysics, Materialisms, Spiritualisms and abstractions of every colour and side, is that finally by God&#x2019;s blessing I got my head entirely swept clear of them, and felt the mandate of Nature (audible to few at present) audible thro&#x2019; my whole soul, &#x201C;Have done with brainwebs and cobwebs: here thou standest face to face with God&#x2019;s Universe, it a fact, thou a fact; in God&#x2019;s name open <hi rend="italic">thy</hi> eyes and look!&#x201D;&#x2014; This Book <hi rend="italic">Uriel</hi>, of Heraud&#x2019;s I have not seen; but I know the man Heraud these good many years.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For J.

Jewsbury had written about reading his poems when staying in Bolton; she had been impressed by them though with some misgivings: &#x201C;I do much fear lest after disbelieving so long, I should at last take up with a vain fancy;&#x2014;or lest mysticism should be only a refuge from the needful labour of endeavouring to <hi rend="italic">work out</hi> a definite conclusion. &#x2026; One difficulty remains as strong as ever&#x2014;how can <hi rend="italic">evil</hi> be a form of <hi rend="italic">good?</hi>&#x201D;</note> Let me not discourage you from reading him: his notions are what they call Pantheisms, mainly borrowed from Coleridge; very harmless; beautiful; and in him (if you knew the man) truly wonderful.&#x2014;
What can you do?

But it was not without long travel that I arrived there: whether that is your destination, or another may be suitabler, there is no predicting.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>A brief word from me tonight must suffice as better than none. I did not see your Letter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> till near dinner-time. It is the second of two entirely wretched and distracted days that I have been obliged to spend in the Common Pleas Court at Westminster Hall, trotting after a Jury case, to wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I am summoned as Special Juryman under penalties! You have to be there at half past nine (think of that in a nasty smoky frosty morning), you have to wait lest your case come on, and you be fined for absence; you have then to come back on the morrow and begin the same game again: &#x201C;hereof fail not.&#x201D; My business is not a whit farther advanced for these two days; it was likely, not by any means certain, I might get done tomorrow. And <hi rend="italic">then</hi>&#x2014;I hold a second summons, dated likewise for tomorrow (as the actual one still pending, was for Wednesday); and so bidding fair to lose a <hi rend="italic">second</hi> week by the business, am in a hopeful way! The penalty <hi rend="italic">can</hi> be &#xa3;100 I believe; the fine usually inflicted is &#xa3;10. I had another such business (<hi rend="italic">two</hi> almost consecutive summonses) about six months ago. After wasting two days <foreign><hi rend="italic">re nondum incepti&#xe2;</hi></foreign> [with nothing yet beginning], I determined to go home and let them fine me if they would. They did not. Indeed I find they but seldom do. If they were to fine constantly, it would produce a rebellion in a week. They only do it occasionally to keep men in mind. In my life I have seen no madder business. I have inquired of every person known to me, especially of every Lawyer, what was the nature of it? Whence this <foreign><hi rend="italic">manus e nubibus</hi></foreign> [hand from the clouds] came that had power to snatch me from my home and work, to be tormented for indefinite days in a madder place than Bedlam, might be supposed to come; above all how it might be parried or eluded? The all but universal answer is, &#x201C;God knows!&#x201D;&#x2014; Finally I have ceased to curse at it; have almost begun to be amused with it, it is so exquisitely absurd. Tomorrow morning I mean to go again, if I awake in time, as is too likely: the <hi rend="italic">second</hi> summons I mean to risk; one week lost is enough.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For the summons six months previously, see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400701-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1840-07-01">1 July</date></ref>. TC was evidently not on the jury of <date when="1840-12-02">2</date> and <date when="1840-12-03">3 Dec.</date> On <date when="1840-12-04">4 Dec.</date> he was impanelled on a special jury in the court of queen&#x2019;s bench, in <hi rend="italic">Hakewell v. Dearman</hi>, about the infringement of a patent, in which Fitzroy Kelly (see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18401205-TC-MRI-01">TC to <sic>MR</sic><corr>MRI</corr>, <date when="1840-12-05">5 Dec.</date></ref>) appeared for the defendant and lost. In <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>, JWC was advised by W. F. Pollock what to do if TC were called in future, but he had to serve once more; see next vol. and Pollock, <hi rend="italic">Personal Remembrances</hi> (London, <date when="1887-00-00">1887</date>) 1:152&#x2013;57.</note> Farther I have determined in future, by some <pb id="pg-12-342" n="12:342"/>means or other, to be rid altogether of such a distraction worse distracted;&#x2014;and hope, I have after infinite inquiry got upon the track of it. I would quit London altogether rather than live under such a bondage, recurring every three months. I have got a right fit of bile by means of it;&#x2014;and will now take to talk of something else.</p>
<p>We did not well know what to hope from your first Ryde Letter. That I should so soon see you in London seemed too good news. But I could not write till the issue came. Your second Letter takes away such hope for the present,&#x2014;shewing us all the more provokingly that it did exist. From the tone of both Letters I collect also that your situation is probably very embarrassing in reference to the great business of it. With real sympathy I can fancy how many difficulties you may have. Patience, steadfastness, clearness of heart, which is the surest source of clearness of head! I know not what farther to advise. If the thing get too distracted, you can, as you say, straightway quit it. Your old room is here untenanted, the old welcome is here to such cheer as we have. Come again, and stay with us till you see what farther will unfold itself. You must put up with the sickliness of my poor liver; you must try to read a Brother&#x2019;s heart under all these mournful perversions of the surface.&#x2014; Or perhaps it is not all so bad as my bilious fancy paints? Perhaps we shall get better news soon? At all events write without delay.</p>
<p>If you continue in Wight, I will decidedly make an attempt to get down and see you, even tho&#x2019; I try a lodging for it. The trip will do me no harm; I wish to Heaven I had six months of country in store for me. I want of course to see you; but I want even to see the Isle of Wight itself. I have had serious thoughts of actually shifting myself thither, or somewhither, where quiet and free air, the chief blessings I could get in life, might be vouchsafed me. I think of several places; Wight the likeliest. I do not know but I shall fly, if nothing else will do, to Puttoch itself next summer! I am truly in a most sickly and encumbered way here; several degrees of additional pain laid upon me, almost half of my one blessing, the power to work, taken sorrowfully out of my hands. Jane alone, I think, has kept me here for the last two years. She is thoroughly reluctant to quit London; this is of course a great point: but tho&#x2019; she will not assist me in a removal, she will of course consent,&#x2014;and ought, if real interests are involved. I do not think I shall undertake the writing of this new Book in Town; it is a frightful aggravation of it, the Town. Neither would I willingly quit all that I have in London; the only vestige of free neighbourhood I ever had among my fellow men in this world. On the whole there are several considerations that point towards your Isle rather than elsewhither. <pb id="pg-12-343" n="12:343"/>The Isle of Man has sea, is cheap, is within reach of poor old Annandale. Puttoch itself has already a house on it, and is <hi rend="italic">lonely</hi> as Trophonius!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >As a punishment for killing his brother, the legendary king Trophonius was swallowed up by the earth at Lebadeia, in Boetia, and remained imprisoned in an underground chamber where he was consulted as an oracle.</note></p>
<p>All this, you understand, is shot into the air: but if in your wanderings about the Isle, you should see any tolerable, small humble cottage on a hillside near by the waves of the sea, marked &#x201C;to let,&#x201D; you might ask what the rent was. Generally you might pick up some notions about the place which might throw some light on the business to me. We will do nothing rashly. But a thing I begin to see more and more must verily be done.</p>
<p>You <hi rend="italic">got</hi> my last news out of Annandale. Mrs Welsh&#x2019;s Servant is married to her Farmer;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly Mary Mills; see <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390727-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1839-07-27">27 July 1839</date></ref>; the farmer at Templand is unidentified.</note> which has produced a little revolution in her household.</p>
<p>Poor Dr Marshall has decided on going as Surgeon to one of the Ships in the expedition which Government, impelled by Fowell Buxton, is now fitting out for Africa.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Fowell Buxton (<date when="1786-00-00">1786</date>&#x2013;<date when="1845-00-00">1845</date>), Quaker philanthropist and brewer; M.P. for Weymouth, <date when="1818-00-00">1818</date>&#x2013;<date when="1837-00-00">37</date>; made bart., <date when="1840-00-00">1840</date>.

<salute>Dear Miss Wilson,</salute>
<p>The Farce of the Special Jury is absolutely threatening to become tragical to me. Next day after my visit to Eccleston St<hi rend="italic">t</hi> there came a <hi rend="italic">second</hi> summons; the first for Wednesday, the second for Friday! I have been bottled up now for three days in that accursed porch of Bedlam till the life is almost stewed out of me, and as yet there is nothing whatever done, my two summonses both still valid, and tomorrow morning at 9 o&#x2019;clock I must attend again. I have asked and inquired of all people, &#x201C;Whence comes it? Whither goes it?&#x201D; The universal answer, &#x201C;God knows!&#x201D; No madder thing ever came athwart me in this world. How long it will last I do not know; but I must struggle to the end of it now. I must also contrive to get delivered from it for the future,&#x2014;were it even by rushing off into the moors of Nithsdale again!</p>
<p>I am thoroughly sick, bilious, sleepless, next door to desperate. Alas, on Monday Evening I shall probably be sitting in that scandalous Gehenna,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The valley of Hinnom, nr. Jerusalem, where some of the Israelites sacrificed their children to Moloch (Jer. 7:31); see Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi> 107.</note> getting thro&#x2019; my <hi rend="italic">first</hi> Jury summons; fitter for the Hospital than for your kind Dining-room! As good as two weeks of my time will have been blotted out as with a great ugly blotch of Madness, dropt on it by God knows whom or what; but dropt on it; lying there; ready to return in three months, if milder Destiny prevent not! Pity me, and pray for me.</p>

<salute>Dear Mrs Rich,</salute>
<p>A decidedly meritorious, and evidently very necessitous young German, of the name of Bentheim,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> applied here repeatedly some months ago; whom I am right glad to recommend to you for Teacher. His dialect of <hi rend="italic">English</hi> is not such as you will admire; but the error turns out to be rather in pronunciation than in intelligence,&#x2014;an incoherent articulation, as if he were speaking thro&#x2019; water, as if he were speaking <pb id="pg-12-345" n="12:345"/>with two or more tongues at once. I suppose it is a German peculiarity; Charles V. said, He would speak to his horse in German.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Emperor Charles V is credited with the remark &#x201C;I speak Spanish to God, Italian to women, French to men, and German to my horse&#x201D;; a saying known to Gulliver, <hi rend="italic">Gulliver&#x2019;s Travels</hi> 4:ch. 3.</note> Fancy this a <hi rend="italic">river</hi>-horse endeavouring to speak to you!</p>
<p>What is most to the purpose, Bentheim is a person of intelligence in his own language; he even writes meritoriously in German, is a scholar, philologer, a modest man,&#x2014;and I should hope would prove a superior artist for your purpose. I have given him a card for you; with which he will probably introduce himself straightway.</p>
<p>Should he have quitted London, and not appear, or if on appearing you do not like him, I doubt not I can readily discover another.</p>
<p>If I were near Mr Scott I should surely go and hear these things. Why does he never come to see me of late?</p>

<salute>Dear Christie,</salute>
<p>On Saturday and for a whole week prior, and so onwards till yesternight, I was caged in that accursed Dogkennel of a Common-Pleas Court at Westminster, in the character of special Juryman; driven nearly mad; and have come to the conclusion that I will be mulcted, incarcerated, shot and almost crucified rather than go back for such an errand. Macaulay,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Kenneth Macaulay (<date when="1815-00-00">1815</date>&#x2013;<date when="1867-00-00">67</date>), lawyer; educated at Jesus College, Cambridge, B.A., <date when="1835-00-00">1835</date>, M.A. <date when="1839-00-00">1839</date>; called to the bar, <date when="1839-05-00">May 1839</date>; Q.C., <date when="1850-00-00">1850</date>; M.P. for Cambridge, <date when="1852-00-00">1852</date>&#x2013;<date when="1854-00-00">54</date>, <date when="1857-00-00">1857</date>&#x2013;<date when="1865-00-00">65</date>.</note> who saw me in my despair on Saturday, I fancied might have told you how it stood with me.</p>
<p>Nothing whatever has been brought to pass here as to the Library. Macray of Oxford writes that he will not be Librarian on our terms; talks of a certain Mr Cochran, once a Scotch Bookseller, then Editor of the Foreign Quarterly Review, now I know not what; who perhaps may apply to us; who is not worth our applying to, or worth perhaps our accepting.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The committee of the Library had met on <date when="1840-12-05">5 Dec.</date>, when it was decided that it should have a catalogue prepared of books for purchase, and a report should be drawn up to present to candidates for the post of librarian; salary to be decided at next meeting. For John George Cochrane (<date when="1781-00-00">1781</date>&#x2013;<date when="1852-00-00">1852</date>), publisher, see <ref target="volume-05/lt-18300714-TC-JAC-01"><sic>5:123</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1830-07-14">14 July 1830</date></corr></ref>. He had been ed. of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Quarterly Review</hi>, <date when="1827-00-00">1827</date>&#x2013;<date when="1835-00-00">35</date>, of the Edinburgh <hi rend="italic">Caledonian Mercury</hi>, cataloguer of Scott&#x2019;s library at Abbotsford, and had also ed. a newspaper at Hertford. He was appointed librarian, <date when="1841-02-03">3 Feb. 1841</date>. For John Macray, see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400529-TC-WDC-01">TC to WDC, <date when="1840-05-29">29 May</date></ref>.</note> The first grand thing to be done, the soul of the whole enterprise now, seems to me this of getting a right Librarian. He will devise the form of our Library, and all manner of <foreign><hi rend="italic">etceteras</hi></foreign><hi rend="italic">;</hi> he, I think, or no one to right purpose. As to me, I am greatly desirous to be out of the Secretaryship, being nothing but a mere cloak while in it, the whole business falling on you. I will stay on the Committee, if you like, and do whatever is possible for me; but really that cannot be much, for I am to be very busy otherwise thro&#x2019; winter. I wish much you would get this managed for me,&#x2014;and be my great Apollo.</p>
<p>Tite of the Moorfields concern absolutely will not see me, as it seems, unless I force my way to him with axe and crowbar; I believe he knows what I have to urge, that he cannot grant it, and also that there is no reasonable account to be given of refusing it; wherefore he declines to see me;&#x2014;and I now decline to be seen, and beg to wash my hands of him and Moorfields from this date altogether. We shall manage to get a set of Books in some other way.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-12-347" n="12:347"/>The most important event is perhaps the inclosed Letter from Cole.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henry Cole; letter not found.</note> Not that I know much of Cole&#x2019;s scheme-of-action as there laid down; but of the man Cole, as desirous to become a Committee-man, and to exert himself for the business, I judge that his services may be in the highest degree valuable. He is a man of infinite cunning activity; in reference to this monster of a London Public, one of the skilfullest men, successful hitherto in the most desperate-looking things he has undertaken in that kind. By all means, see him, get him yoked to the business; he now judges it to be <hi rend="italic">vital</hi>, alive and like living; he is the man of men (in his way) to make it grow swiftly.</p>
<p>I am here generally till two; not in your region voluntarily once in the month. Every evening too, or almost every evening, I am at home: in a swift cab it is not 20 minutes from your Club. By all means, come to see me soon.</p>

<salute>Dear Sterling,</salute>
<p>Thanks for your kind greeting from Torquay.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> We had heard of your going thither; and rejoiced greatly that at least you were not to be wafted over the Alps again, but to spend the winter in your own Island. Be content, my Friend Solitude is not joyful but sad for one of your temper; yet at bottom there are far more unprofitable things than solitude. How often do I, poor wretch, from amid this inane whirlpool, which seems to be grinding my life to pieces, cry aloud for a hut in the wilderness, with fields round me and sky over me; that on any terms consistent with life at all I might be allowed to live there! Nay perhaps I shall verily fly to Craigenputtoch again before long. Yet I know what solitude is, and imprisonment among black-cattle and peatbogs: The truth is, we are never right as we are: &#x201C;O, the Devil burn it!&#x201D; said the Irish Drummer flogging his countryman, &#x201C;there&#x2019;s no pleasing of <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, strike where one will!&#x201D;</p>
<p>I commend your improvements of the <hi rend="italic">Election</hi>, and shall watch with you what the world will say of it. A man has no other course: let him speak his best to mankind; let mankind&#x2019;s response give him farther guidance;&#x2014;so far as guidance may lie there for him. My regret will be <pb id="pg-12-348" n="12:348"/>continual that you do not stand by the first-rate <hi rend="italic">prose</hi> that you could write; but your own feeling is other, the call of your own nature seems to you to be other: you decidedly must and shall persevere, and <hi rend="italic">try</hi> till you have ascertained. I feel well that whatsoever I could add on the matter would be impertinences henceforth. I am not infallible either!</p>
<p>My feeling of Harriett [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] Martineau&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Hour and Man</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">The Hour and the Man</hi>, 3 vols. (London, <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>), was an antislavery novel about the emancipation of Haiti by Toussaint L&#x2019;Ouverture, which attracted much praise, though some (like Jeffrey) found the characters unrealistic; see R. K. Webb, <hi rend="italic">Harriet Martineau, A Radical Victorian</hi> (London, <date when="1960-00-00">1960</date>) 191&#x2013;92. Harriet Martineau had been in poor health when she wrote it, and found it &#x201C;a resource, and some anxiety to me, all summer&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Autobiography</hi> [London, <date when="1877-00-00">1877</date>] 2:157). Sterling thought the book &#x201C;eloquent, but an absurd exaggeration&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Life, Works</hi> 11:206).</note> is very similar to your own. A beautiful enthusiasm<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310831-TC-JWC-01"><sic>5:388</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1831-08-31">31 Aug. 1831</date></corr></ref>.</note> reigns in it; a half-enviable half-pitiable faith in Socinian Formulas, beauties of virtue &#x26;c &#x26;c. The banyan does by no means to my knowledge grow in the West Indies; indeed I hear there are eminent errors not a few of that sort in the Book: but if Shakspeare made seaport in Bohemia<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">The Winter&#x2019;s Tale</hi> 3.3.</note> without much damage, what should <hi rend="italic">they</hi> avail? Harriet is unfortunately not in your neighbourhood, but at Tynemouth far in the North. She is a brave creature; full of heart, full of healthy swift faculty: &#x201C;God has given to every people a Prophet in its own speech,&#x201D; say the Arabs.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370601-TC-RWE-01"><sic>9:220</sic><corr>TC to RWE, <date when="1837-06-01">1 June 1837</date></corr></ref>.</note> For Prophet read Poet; and wonder that even to the Socinian people of England in the nineteenth century the common lot has fallen!</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Nickleby</hi> I never read, except pieces of it in newspapers:<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Nicholas Nickleby</hi>, pbd. in one vol., <date when="1839-10-00">Oct. 1839</date>.</note> the Author I have seen sometimes, not without satisfaction; a kindly-constructed clear-sighted, good little fellow,&#x2014;good enough and too good for the course he is flung into here.</p>
<p>My Brother has been with us these two days; today he returns to Ryde: he seems not much in love with his situation, nor very fast tied to it: the great salary, I suppose, is the main blessing of it.</p>
<p>As for me, I am sunk beyond audibility in black deluges, bottomless, shoreless, of Laudism, Rushworthism, Cromwellism, desperate incomprehensible inanity, and dulness without a name; a truly pitiable man. Whether any thing will ever come of it all, seems more than doubtful. But <hi rend="italic">today</hi> I am just returned from a week&#x2019;s mad martyrdom as Special Juryman, and am one of the miserablest inhabitants of London. Enough! <closer><salute>Yours ever</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>This morning by the Postman there was a Letter from you left here;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> and about an hour afterwards, another Functionary, mounted on wheels, made his appearance with the Box which your Letter had predicted: all safe, and in perfect order: a right kind message, delicately sent; for which, and for the feelings it proceeded from, take many thankful acknowledgements. I judge from the style of your appearances here that I ought to reckon you among my possessions in this world. Cornelia had no precious stones; but she said, pointing to certain living souls, &#x201C;These are my jewels.&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cornelia, Roman matron of the <date>second cent. B.C.</date>, pointed to her two sons, the Gracchi, saying, &#x201C;These are my jewels,&#x201D; in reply to a visiting lady who had asked to see her jewels.</note> I have sought out Llandough on the map, know now to distinguish it from Llandow not far off; and shall understand that there also is a good household belonging to me.</p>
<p>What you say of being an Attorney brings a laugh into my face: Destiny seems to take a kind of satirical pleasure in practically quizzing me for what I have heedlessly written under that rubric,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >As, e.g., in <hi rend="italic">Chartism, Works</hi> 29:148: &#x201C;Dost thou take me for a Quackery? For a Conventionality and Attorneyism?&#x201D;</note>&#x2014;really little or nothing more than a convenient piece of nomenclature for me. You are not the first estimable and honest man, who with a sardonic triumph has announced himself to me as an Attorney; nay it so happens that precisely all the Attornies I know are of that category. &#x201C;They have but one fault; but that one is a thumper!&#x201D;&#x2014; Well, I must bear your triumph and Destiny&#x2019;s.</p>
<p>What you say of your venerable Quaker Mother, of your quiet village Household, in the hollow of the Welsh Mountains, near by the shore of the many-sounding everlasting sea,&#x2014;is full of beauty to me. My own daily prayer is that my lot too might be cast in such a locality. It is not impossible but you may see me some time or other at Cowbridge; were I not the worst of travellers, I should say it was not even unlikely.</p>
<p>As to your two questions, I answer, of Goethe&#x2019;s marriage, Yes, he was married; tho&#x2019; some have told me, it was a kind of <hi rend="italic">afterthought</hi>&#x2014;a little while later than one could have wished and his Wife not altogether <pb id="pg-12-350" n="12:350"/>the pattern of women!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Christiane Vulpius (<date when="1765-00-00">1765</date>&#x2013;<date when="1816-00-00">1816</date>), Goethe&#x2019;s acknowledged mistress from <date when="1788-00-00">1788</date>. She bore him five children, four dying in infancy. Her conduct during the French occupation of Weimar, <date when="1806-00-00">1806</date>, protected Goethe from harm, and he m. her five days later.</note>. They had a son, who proved a drunkard and sensualist as I have heard; and died at Rome, sent thither to be out of the way, about a year before his Father.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >August (<date when="1789-00-00">1789</date>&#x2013;<date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>); he d., as TC says, in <date when="1830-10-00">Oct. 1830</date>; see <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310122-TC-G-01"><sic>5:218</sic><corr>TC to G, <date when="1831-01-22">22 Jan. 1831</date></corr></ref>. Goethe d. <date when="1832-03-22">22 March 1832</date>.</note></p>
<p>With regard to lecturing I can only answer, Not except on compulsion,&#x2014;and this year I trust in Heaven not. The whole element of Lecturing is foreign to me; a detestable mixture of &#x201C;Prophecy and Playacting,&#x201D; in which I have never yet found any right bottom; and would not unless compelled to it seek farther for one.</p>
<p>If you come again to this Babylon and have an hour to spare, pray seek me out.&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; <closer><salute>With thanks and good wishes</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Partly connected with the <hi rend="italic">Booke of the Kirk,</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400908-TC-DA-01">TC to DA, <date when="1840-09-08">8 Sept.</date></ref></note> which you were kind enough to leave me as a legacy when you last went hence, there is another Book, <hi rend="italic">Baillie&#x2019;s Letters and Journals,</hi> which I want very greatly to get, and cannot fall in with here for love or money. I have looked on it in the <hi rend="italic">British Museum;</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400917-TC-JF-01">TC to JF, <date when="1840-09-17">17 Sept.</date></ref> The library had two copies (Edinburgh, <date when="1775-00-00">1775</date>), of the two-vol. edn.</note> but it is beyond my faculty to read it there; and nowhere else, in Bookshops, Cambridge Libraries or the shelves of private friends, can I discover more than traditions and provoking rumours of it. I am told the Book is common in Scotland: who knows but you may have it, or may in some way have access to it, and could let me have a loan of it for a little? I boast of the virtue of returning books lent me, in a faithful manner! Our friend Sam<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Samuel Aitken.</note> could easily find means of conveyance,&#x2014;to the care of Fraser in Regent-Street. On the <pb id="pg-12-352" n="12:352"/>whole, Letters being so cheap, and you so helpful, I find I may at least ask you about it.&#x2014; Literary men borrow books <foreign><hi rend="italic">sub ros&#xe2;</hi></foreign><hi rend="italic">,</hi> it is said, from the Advocates&#x2019; and Signet and all manner of open Libraries, and have them sent hither and sent thither, punctually restoring them; it is a thing not entirely unknown to myself of old; but I am out of all their Ledgers there for a long while past.</p>
<p>Baillie&#x2019;s is not the only Book I want; the History of Scotch Covenanting, which is the History of Scotland altogether in Charles <hi rend="italic">First&#x2019;s</hi> time, is the point I drive at. Much that perhaps is common in Edinburgh is unattainable here. Did not some &#x201C;Stevenson&#x201D; or other lately put forth a publication on that subject?<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Andrew Stevenson, <hi rend="italic">The History of the Church and State of Scotland, from the Accession of K. Charles I. to the Restoration of K. Charles II.,</hi> 3 vols. (Edinburgh, <date when="1753-00-00">1753</date>&#x2013;<date when="1757-00-00">57</date>). TC is referring here to the shorter recent version, <hi rend="italic">The History of the Church and State of Scotland, from the Accession of King Charles</hi> I. <hi rend="italic">to the Year <date when="1649-00-00">1649</date></hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1840-00-00">1840</date>).</note> I have now by me a very trivial <hi rend="italic">History of the Covenanters</hi> published by Waugh &#x26; Innes in <date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>, two small volumes;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >[William Sime], <hi rend="italic">History of the Covenanters in Scotland,</hi> 2 vols. (Edinburgh, <date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>).
The publishers were Waugh &#x26; Innes.</note> but it tells me nothing which I did not long ago know, or even know the contrary of. Did Peterkin<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alexander Peterkin; see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400908-TC-DA-01">TC to DA, <date when="1840-09-08">8 Sept.</date></ref>, and <ref target="volume-12/lt-18401026-TC-JGL-01">TC to JGL, <date when="1840-10-26">26 Oct.</date></ref></note> promulgate nothing on this? Do no Pamphlets, Records, State Trials or the like exist, which can help one to represent to himself those actual Scottish years from <date when="1637-00-00">1637</date> to <date when="1660-00-00">1660</date>, especially the earlier portion of them? What for example, <hi rend="italic">is</hi> known about Jenny Geddes<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390227-TC-JF-01">TC to JF, <date when="1839-02-27">27 Feb. 1839</date></ref>.</note> and her performance in St Giles&#x2019;s in that summer Sunday of <date when="1637-00-00">1637</date>? Do not laugh, I pray you; but ask some Dr Lea<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Lee (<date when="1779-00-00">1779</date>&#x2013;<date when="1859-00-00">1859</date>), M.D., <date when="1801-00-00">1801</date>; D.D., <date when="1823-00-00">1823</date>; well-known churchman and church historian; principal of Edinburgh Univ. from <date when="1840-03-12">12 March</date> till his death.</note> or other; if so be any Dr can tell.

(Aberdeen, <date when="1792-00-00">1792</date>).

<p><pb id="pg-12-353" n="12:353"/>Did you ever see the young man Dodds?<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Dodds; see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400205-TC-JADO-01">TC to <sic>Rev.

No word since. I am interested in this forlorn Dodds, and find traces of a valiant substantial heart in him; a man perhaps <hi rend="italic">capable</hi> of being helped (which so few are), if one knew how! It is a divine office; the divinest we have here below, that of helping. Tell me whether I have procured you such a luxury in this man&#x2019;s acquaintance; or only a new trouble and futility.</p>
<p>My Wife is better than usual this winter: we join in many cordial salutations to you and Mrs A.</p>

<salute>Dear Emerson,</salute>
<p>My answer,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >To Emerson&#x2019;s letter of <date when="1840-10-30">30 Oct.</date></note> on this occasion, has been delayed above two weeks, by a rigorous searching investigation into the procedure of the hapless Book-conveyer Kennet, in reference to that copy of the Miscellanies.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson had written, &#x201C;Kennett, I hear, has failed. I hope he did not give his creditors my &#x2018;Miscellanies,&#x2019; which you told me were there.&#x201D; See <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400702-TC-RWE-01">TC to RWE, <date when="1840-07-02">2 July</date></ref>.</note> I was deceived by hopes of a conclusive response from day to day; not till yesterday did any come. My first step, taken long ago, was to address a new copy of the Book, not to you luckless man, but to <hi rend="italic">Lydia</hi> Emerson the fortunate Wife; this copy Green now has lying by him, waiting for the <date when="1841-01-00">January</date> Steamer (we sail only <hi rend="italic">once</hi> a month in this season): before the New Year has got out of infancy the Lady will be graciously pleased to make a few inches of room on her bookshelves for this celebrated performance. And now as to Kennet, take the brief outcome of some dozen visitations, judicial interrogatories, searches of documents and other piercing work on the part of methodic Fraser, attended with demurrers, pleadings, false denials, false affirmings on the part of innocent chaotic Kennet: namely that the said Kennet, so urged, did in the end of last week, fish up from his repositories your very identical Book directed to Monroe&#x2019;s<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Munroe &#x26; Co., Boston.</note> care, duly booked, and engaged for, in <date when="1840-05-00">May</date> last, but left to repose itself in the Covent-Garden <pb id="pg-12-354" n="12:354"/>crypts ever since without disturbance from gods or men! Fraser has brought back the Book, and you have lost it;&#x2014;and the Library of my native Village in Scotland is to get it, and not Kennett any more in the world, but Green ever henceforth is to be our Book Carrier.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably John Green, 121 Newgate St.; see RWE to TC, <date when="1840-10-30">30 Oct.</date> (Slater, <hi rend="italic">CEC</hi> 283).</note> There is a history. Green, it seems, addresses also to Monroe; but the thing, I suppose, will now shift for itself without watching.</p>
<p>As to the bibliopolic accounts,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson had sent Munroe&#x2019;s accounts of the sale of TC&#x2019;s books with his letter; see Slater, <hi rend="italic">CEC</hi> 282, 284&#x2013;85.</note> my Friend!&#x2014;we will trust them with a faith known only in the purer ages of Roman Catholicism,&#x2014;when Papacy had indeed become a Dubiety, but was not yet a Quackery and Falsehood, was a thing <hi rend="italic">as</hi> true as it could manage to be! That really may be the fact of this too. In any case what signifies it much? Money were still useful; but it is not now so indispensable. Booksellers by their knavery or their fidelity cannot kill us or cure us. Of the truth of Waldo Emerson&#x2019;s heart to me, there is, God be thanked for it, no doubt at all.</p>
<p>My Hero-Lectures lie still in Manuscript.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson had asked TC to send proofs of the lectures when they were in type.</note> Fraser offers no amount of cash adequate to be an outward motive; and inwardly there is as yet none altogether clear, tho&#x2019; I rather feel of late as if it were clearing. To fly in the teeth of English Puseyism, and risk such shrill welcome as I am pretty sure of, is questionable: yet at bottom why not? Dost thou not as entirely reject this new distraction of a Puseyism as man can reject a thing; and couldst utterly abjure it, and even abhor it,&#x2014;were the <hi rend="italic">shadow</hi> of a cobweb ever likely to become momentous, the cobweb itself being <hi rend="italic">beheaded,</hi><note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Archbishop Laud.</note> with axe and block on Tower Hill, two centuries ago? I think it were as well to <hi rend="italic">tell</hi> Puseyism that it has something of good, but also much of bad and even worst. We shall see. If I print the thing, we shall surely take in America again; either by stereotype or in some other way. Fear not that!&#x2014; Do you attend at all to this new <hi rend="italic">Laudism</hi> of ours? It spreads far and wide among our Clergy in these days; a most notable symptom, very cheering to me many ways; whether or not one of the fatallest our poor Church of England has ever exhibited, and betokening swifter ruin to it than any other, I do not inquire. Thank God, men do discover at last that there is still a God present in their affairs, and must be, or their affairs are of the Devil, naught, and worthy of being sent to the Devil! This once given I find that all is given; daily History, in Kingdom and in Parish, <pb id="pg-12-355" n="12:355"/>is an <foreign><hi rend="italic">experimentum crucis</hi></foreign> [a crucial experiment] to shew what <hi rend="italic">is</hi> the Devil&#x2019;s and what not. But on the whole are we not the <hi rend="italic">formallest</hi> people ever created under this Sun? Cased and overgrown with Formulas, like very lobsters with their shells, from birth upwards; so that in the man we see only his breeches, and believe and swear that wherever a pair of old breeches are there is a man! I declare I could both laugh and cry. These poor good men, merciful, zealous, with many sympathies and thoughts, there do they vehemently appeal to me, <foreign><hi rend="italic">Et tu Brute?</hi></foreign><note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Julius Caesar</hi> 3.1.</note> Brother, wilt thou too insist on the breeches being old; not ply a needle among us here?&#x2014; To the naked Caliban,<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >As in <hi rend="italic">The Tempest</hi>.</note> gigantic, for whom such breeches would not be a glove, who is stalking and groping there in search of <hi rend="italic">new</hi> breeches and accoutrements, sure to get them, a<supplied>[nd]</supplied> to tread into nonentity whoever hinders him in the search,&#x2014;they are blind a<supplied>[s if]</supplied> they had no eyes. Sartorial men; ninth-parts of a man:&#x2014;enough of them.</p>
<p>The Second N<hi rend="italic">o</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">Dial</hi> has also arrived some days ago. I like it decidedly better than the first; in fact it is right well worth being put on paper, and sent circulating;&#x2014;I find only as before that it is still too much of a <hi rend="italic">soul</hi> for circulating as it should. I wish you could in future contrive to mark at the end of each Article who writes it, or give me some general key for knowing. I recognise Emerson readily; the rest are &#x03BF;&#x1F31; &#x03C0;&#x03BF;&#x03BB;&#x03BB;&#x03BF;&#x03AF; [the indistinguishable many] for most part.<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson had sent a list of authors with TC&#x2019;s copy of the first number.</note> But it is all good and very good as a <hi rend="italic">soul;</hi> wants only a body, which want means a great deal! Your Paper on Literature is incompar<supplied>[a]</supplied>bly the worthiest thing hitherto; a thing I read with delight. Speak out, my brave Emerson; there are many good men that listen! Even what you say of Goethe gratifies me; it is one of the few things yet spoken of him from personal insight, the sole kind of things that should be spoken! You call him <hi rend="italic">actual</hi> not <hi rend="italic">ideal;</hi><note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Thoughts on Modern Literature,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">The Dial</hi>, <date when="1840-10-00">Oct.</date>, repr. in <hi rend="italic">Works,</hi> ed.

Emerson had written that &#x201C;Goethe, then, must be set down as the poet of the Actual, not of the Ideal; the poet of limitation, not of possibility; of this world, and not of religion and hope; in short, if we may say so, the poet of prose, and not of poetry&#x201D; (331).</note> there is truth in that too; and yet at bottom is not the whole truth rather this: The actual well-seen <hi rend="italic">is</hi> the ideal? The <hi rend="italic">actual,</hi> what really is and exists: the past, the present, the future no less, do all Lie there! Ah yes, one day you will find that this sunny-looking, courtly Goethe held veiled in him a Prophetic Sorrow deep as Dante&#x2019;s,&#x2014;all the nobler to me and to you, that he <hi rend="italic">could</hi> so hold it. I believe this; <pb id="pg-12-356" n="12:356"/>no man can <hi rend="italic">see</hi> as he sees, that has not suffered and striven as man seldom did.&#x2014; <foreign>A propos</foreign> of <hi rend="italic">this,</hi> Have you got Miss Martineau&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Hour and Man!</hi> How curious it were to have the real History of the Negro Toussaint; and his <hi rend="italic">black</hi> <foreign>Sansculottism</foreign> in Saint-Domingo; the most atrocious form <foreign>Sansculottism</foreign> could or can assume. This of a &#x201C;black Wilberforce-Washington&#x201D; as Sterling calls it, is decidedly something.&#x2014; <foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Emerson: time presses, paper is done. Commend me to your good Wife, your good Mother, and love me as well as you can. <closer><salute>Peace and health under clear winter skies be with you all.</salute></closer></p>
<name>T. Carlyle</name>
<ps><p>My Wife rebukes me sharply that I have &#x201C;forgot her love!&#x201D; She is much better this winter than of old.</p>
<p>Having mentioned Sterling I should say that he is at Torquay (Devonshire) for the winter, meditating new publication of Poems. I work still in Cromwellism; all but desperate of any feasible issue worth naming.<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson had written, <date when="1840-10-30">30 Oct.</date>: &#x201C;I shall be glad if you will draw Cromwell, though, if I should choose, it would be Carlyle. You will not feel that you have done your work until those devouring eyes &#x26; that portraying hand have achieved England in the Nineteenth Century. Perhaps you cannot do it until you have made your American visit. I assure you the view of Britain is excellent from New England.&#x201D;</note> I &#x201C;enjoy bad health&#x201D; too,&#x2014;considerably!</p></ps>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I send you a short line today; a line to you, tho&#x2019; I doubt you are none of the faithfullest correspondents, and I rather think my own last Letter to you is still unanswered. Nevertheless here goes.</p>
<p>Our good Mother would get a short Letter from the Doctor one of these days; it will not be new to you therefore that we have met here. He walked in, on Sunday morning last, altogether unannounced, while the coffee stood just about ready; a most joyful apparition, you many fancy. I thought him looking fatter and healthier somewhat; not changed otherwise. His situation too I could now better understand and appreciate. I find it <hi rend="italic">preferable</hi> to what I had supposed. In the first place an Aunt of the Patient&#x2019;s, an old maiden dame,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mary Scott.</note> stays always with them, travels always with them; shares the responsibility: this is a considerable point. Then the Patient himself is really an inoffensive, <pb id="pg-12-357" n="12:357"/>almost an amiable interesting kind of man: he seemed to me by no means <hi rend="italic">insane,</hi> not at all, rather a clever man even and polite and mild to a degree: his disease seems chiefly an excess of <hi rend="italic">timid sensitiveness:</hi> Jack brought him down hither, the first forenoon, and I talked with him again in their H&#xF4;tel: you would have said, it was an interesting delicate-minded man, much oppressed with <foreign><hi rend="italic">blate</hi>ness</foreign> and entirely distrustful of himself; this was all. I believe it <hi rend="italic">is</hi> all; and, alas, enough; and that in very fact if Jack left him, and another were not found to do a similar duty for him, the poor young man, possessed of immense wealth <hi rend="italic">depending</hi> on his sanity, would soon get into such a state of nervous tremour and excitement as would actually amount to confusion of head,&#x2014;be submitted to investigation by jury, be sent into Bedlam, and have his money given over to others to manage! It is frightful to think of. I never in my life have seen money such a malison to any man. Had this man no money, above all had he his bread to work for, I believe all were mended with him: as it is, with thousands and tens of thousands in his pocket, he has to hover always on the verge of the miserablest doom.&#x2014; Jack seems to like him and pity him somewhat: I doubt not he feels the situation irksome for him; but no man can gain &#xa3;1000 a-year without working: besides it has the advantage of being always open to him to quit at a month&#x2019;s warning, and yet free to him to stay in, I calculate, probably as <hi rend="italic">long</hi> as he likes! On the whole, till he <hi rend="italic">fix</hi> his own purposes some way or other, what better <hi rend="italic">situation</hi> could one devise for him? I think he will talk often about going away, yet perhaps hardly go till he either do fix himself, or find the thing more tiresome than it yet is.&#x2014; What alarming <hi rend="italic">indiscretions</hi> are these things I am now telling you! Really I believe it is understood that a Doctor does tell nothing good or bad; but I thought you would all be interested to learn so much: and now if I charge you all not to whisper a syllable of it to any one, will it not be all as if you had never <hi rend="italic">been</hi> told it?</p>
<p>We could get no very long interview with one another, poor Jack and I,&#x2014;for we were both occupied in unlucky ways; but we did what was possible; walked up and down together; had flying meetings at tea; talked a very great deal; and parted in the hope of meeting soon again. Poor Ogilby the Patient was much &#x201C;pleased with his reception here,&#x201D; he said: in a most <foreign><hi rend="italic">blate</hi></foreign> [shy], but most interesting way, he asked me to come down and see them at Wight. Unless they return before long, I mean to do it. They went the night before last. I have written to Jack today, sending forward Alick&#x2019;s last Letter,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> which had <pb id="pg-12-358" n="12:358"/><hi rend="italic">come,</hi> but been inadvertently left, on the Dr&#x2019;s last flying call here. Their H&#xF4;tel, a grand place, as big as all the Inns in Dumfries put into one, was some three miles off. Ogilby is a <foreign>sonsy</foreign>[pleasant]-faced gentleman-like person, of short stature, inclining very slightly to fatness, about 29 years of age, and already considerably gray. Jack had a dark surtout on him, doublebreasted shawl-waistcoat, massive wool trowsers, longish hair and a broadbrimmed hat. Do you not thank me for all these details?</p>
<p>Alick&#x2019;s Letter you can tell him was among the best I ever got from him; I mean the cheerfullest for me to read. He spoke like a <hi rend="italic">wise</hi> man, settled or settling: if so, he will be <hi rend="italic">rich</hi> enough; poor fellow, and all his sore sufferings will in the end turn to profit for him. Tell him no more of this than you see good (if you object to any of it); but say I will certainly write. Poor old Jenny Lockhart!

For above a week past I was kept in the dolefullest state of imprisonment; hanging about the Law Courts here, summoned to act as Special Juryman, obliged to go under terror of penalties.

<p>I enclose the half of a sovereign to buy a frock for poor little Tom my namesake. I am afraid his leg is never whole yet; but I have told myself of late always that it was getting better.&#x2014; Your harvest is good this year for once! Well, let us be thankful.</p>

<salute>Dear Christie,</salute>
<p>There cannot be a better <hi rend="italic">Circular</hi> than this which you have constructed. Let it be printed, and sent abroad, with all despatch. The line in Italics seems to me to express sufficiently all that we can do as to shaping out a general form of a Library, <hi rend="italic">till once a right Librarian be found</hi>. That is the great point at present. General maps of Human Knowledge, Encyclopedical Trees of the Sciences &#x26;c &#x26;c can be found in abundance ready-made (d&#x2019;Alembert<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jean Le Rond d&#x2019;Alembert (<date when="1717-00-00">1717</date>&#x2013;<date when="1783-00-00">83</date>), French mathematician and philosopher, and until <date when="1758-00-00">1758</date> one of the eds. of the <hi rend="italic">Encyclop&#xE9;die, ou Dictionnaire Raisonn&#xE9; des Sciences, des Arts et des M&#xE9;tiers,</hi> 35 vols.

Let us get the best possible <hi rend="italic">man,</hi> and set <hi rend="italic">him</hi> to work in the middle of our possibilties: the line in italics will be his best guidance, I think.</p>
<p>As to Cole,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-12/lt-18401207-TC-WDC-01">TC to WDC, <date when="1840-12-07">7 Dec.</date></ref></note> consider that I have said whatsoever I had to say; that, for the rest, I have no wish in it at all.

<p>You will scan Fisher<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. Fisher, resident in London, candidate for the post of librarian; see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18401218-TC-TM-01">TC to TM, <date when="1840-12-18">18 Dec.</date></ref>; not further identified.</note> as with microscopes, you, Spedding, Venables<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Stovin Venables (<date when="1810-00-00">1810</date>&#x2013;<date when="1888-00-00">88</date>), barrister and journalist, an active member of the committee; a friend of Tennyson from student days at Cambridge, and a prominent member of the Ashburton circle.</note> and the rest of you.

<salute>Dear Sterling,</salute>
<p>In a corner of your last Note, lies an interrogatory which I, punctual as I wished to be, did <hi rend="italic">not</hi> answer. A most momentous interrogatory!</p>
<p>The Mr Richardson, who struggles vainly to vend his Book by some recommendation of mine, must be a certain David Lester Richardson, an Indian Scotch Soldier, now for the second time in Calcutta, who once, some ten years ago, as a Halfpay here made some efforts as an Editor and Critic; but not succeeding to his mind, went back to regions of the Sun again. There collecting his <foreign><hi rend="italic">disjecta membra</hi></foreign> [scattered pieces] of Prose and Rhyme, he printed them on dim paper, and sent me a copy. I had never seen his face; but knew who he was; found him an affectionate, melancholy, smooth-spoken man, of decided elegance and ingenuity,&#x2014;tormented seemingly not a little with many things; with the need of approbation from his fellow creatures, for one. I found him really cheerful-tragic reading; and told him so veraciously, with honest emphasis. He&#x2014;unhappy man&#x2014;printed my Letter, had it reprinted here, &#x201C;on sweet compulsion&#x201D;; and I&#x2014;would write no more. He is now in his second edition, on finer paper; sends me <hi rend="italic">two</hi> copies; one of which, if you will undertake to review it, <hi rend="italic">you</hi> shall have straightway and my blessing to boot!
The Newspaper puff, I have small doubt, is extracted from the same luckless Letter.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >David Lester Richardson (<date when="1801-00-00">1801</date>&#x2013;<date when="1865-00-00">65</date>); see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18371219-TC-DLR-01"><sic>9:372</sic><corr>TC to DLR, <date when="1837-12-19">19 Dec. 1837</date></corr></ref>; currently principal of the Hindu College, Calcutta.

<salute>SIR,</salute>
<p>WE are instructed by the Committee of the LONDON LIBRARY to inform you that at a Meeting held by them on Saturday, the <date when="1840-11-28">28th of November</date>,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Prof. Malden was in the chair, TC present and first named of the listed members in the minutes.</note> it was resolved,&#x2014;</p>
<p>That the Library shall be opened, and books issued on the <date when="1841-05-01">first of May, 1841</date>.</p>
<p>That the entrance-money, &#xa3;5, be now declared due, and the subscribers requested to pay the same to Messrs. Bouverie and Co., 11 Haymarket.</p>
<p>That the first annual subscription of &#xa3;2 be declared due on the <date when="1841-05-01">first of May, 1841</date>.</p>
<p>We have therefore to request, unless it should have already been done, the early payment of your entrance-money.</p>
<p>The Committee are now of necessity actively engaged in the collection of books for the Library. In collecting books for a Library which is to embrace every department of literature and philosophy, they must of course proceed both systematically, and with that fair degree of attention to all subjects, which will for a long time preclude the possibility of completeness in any one. The Committee are anxious, however, to combine, so far as is possible, an adherence to system with the satisfaction of the wants of subscribers; and with this view <pb id="pg-12-363" n="12:363"/>we are instructed to invite you to send in to the Committee <hi rend="italic">a list of the books which you are likely to apply for from the library</hi>. The Committee wish it to be understood that they do not bind themselves to the purchase of the books named, but that they will be happy to be guided by your wishes, so far as is compatible with the system of their proceeding.</p>
<p>We are also instructed to state, that the Committee will be glad to receive any donations which you may be kindly disposed to make to an institution having very large objects in view, and requiring very large means for their adequate realization; and that they will feel obliged by any exertions which you may have it in your power to make in the way of promising additional subscribers.</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I am far from having time or composure today for answering your last Letter as it merits. But I have a small piece of charitable business for you, which ought not to wait: you will put up with a small word for the present, expecting better some other day.</p>
<p>Your news of the death of poor old Jenny Lockhart has opened all manner of thoughts in me;&#x2014;or rather has given a form and direction to thoughts that, in one form or another, hardly ever quit me night or day. Poor old Jenny! I can remember dimly the time when we were running about as children; when she used to bake us small <hi rend="italic">rolls</hi> in her back-house,&#x2014;things that she called <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;nods&#x201D;!</hi> It must be not far from forty years ago. Ah me! One has no word to utter what all this means for us,&#x2014;this strange whirlpool of a world, this ever-flowing stream of Life and of Death.&#x2014; At present, however, I remember that Jenny&#x2019;s Daughter Mary is living near you, probably in very great distress; I want you to give her that inclosed sovereign in the quietest way you have, and say anything that is sympathetic to the poor creature. She was a merry kind of child once; and she too is grown sad enough. One can do nothing for her.&#x2014; On the whole, it was a praiseworthy act in <pb id="pg-12-364" n="12:364"/>Wull to make that exertion for his poor old Mother. It ought to cover, in him, a considerable quantity of sins, the <hi rend="italic">slut</hi>.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mary Carlyle (d. <date when="1847-00-00">1847</date>) was married to a weaver named Harkness and lived in the Ecclefechan area (Marrs 511). Her brothers&#x2014;&#x201C;Wullie&#x201D; and John&#x2014;were wrongly identified in <ref target="volume-04/lt-18270101-TC-AC-01"><sic>4:179</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1827-01-01">1 Jan. 1827</date></corr></ref> as having the surname Brown. They were the children of Jenny Lockhart Carlyle (<date when="1771-00-00">1771</date>&#x2013;<date when="1840-00-00">1840</date>), and John Carlyle (<date when="1754-00-00">1754</date>&#x2013;<date when="1801-00-00">1801</date>), elder brother of TC&#x2019;s father, &#x201C;beside whom our boyhood was passed, none of whom have come to anything but insignificance. He was a well-doing man, and left them well; but their mother was not wise, nor they decidedly so&#x201D; (Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> 33, and Marrs 214).</note>&#x2014;</p>
<p>All my news were written to Jamie almost the day after I received your Letter. We have since heard from Jack more than once; I inclose you his last Letter.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> It seems to me as if he were likely to stay where he is (I mean, in his situation) for a considerable while yet. It has this great charm, That he <hi rend="italic">feels he can be off</hi> at any time; he is not obliged to resolve for more than a month or two ahead of him! The wages too are supereminent; and he begins, I imagine, to like to see his purse gather.&#x2014; Yesternight (Jack&#x2019;s Letter had arrived in the morning) there came a beautiful little Note from my Mother.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1840-12-12">12 Dec.</date></note> Tell her I will not fail to answer it. Tell her I am deeply interested with her little Letters; they give me a glimpse into the very fireside yonder where she is sitting and thinking of me.</p>
<p>What you say of the Ecclefechan Libra<supplied>[ry]</supplied> seems worth notice. The poor fellows will have to lay 45/ before they can get my Book of <hi rend="italic">Miscellanies;</hi> and then perhaps a good many of them will not understand much of it! Another piece of business, therefore, that I had with you today, was to <hi rend="italic">stop</hi> that enterprise of theirs if still possible,&#x2014;with tidings that I will make them a present of a copy, if it be still time. I suppose I may direct it to you? Or to whom? It can be sent cost-free to Edinburgh; after which I do not well know the history of it. It will arrive some way without much cost. The only point is <hi rend="italic">if they have not yet irrevocably bought it elsewhere</hi>. Pray inquire into that, and write me one word <hi rend="italic">immediately</hi> about it; if you write immediately there will still be time to send it by the Magazines of this month, and it will arrive in the early days of <date when="1841-01-00">January</date>. I know not whether you yourself are in the Library? The like of that is good to encourage. Poor fellows! they shall have a copy of the Book, and my blessing along with it.</p>
<p>Dear Alick, it is a great while since I got a Letter that I liked so well from you as the last. but I will not enter into that. You are getting calmer, and clearer; all else is with me a most secondary matter in comparison. That you find yourself actually &#x201C;making a livelihood&#x201D; is to be accounted great success, I think, in these times. Persevere without <pb id="pg-12-365" n="12:365"/>misgiving. I see very well how true it all is that you say about the habits of successful merchants, and how different it all is from your nature: yet I say, never mind; have a faith that as, old Samuel Johnson said, &#x201C;useful industry <hi rend="italic">will</hi> be rewarded.&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Penultimate para. of the Pref. to the <hi rend="italic">Dictionary;</hi> see also <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370122-TC-MAC-01"><sic>9:125</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1837-01-22">22 Jan. 1837</date></corr></ref>.</note> If a man does keep honest ware, and deal like a faithful man,&#x2014;however crabbed he may be people in the long run will actually grow to like him better than any other. It is a faith all kinds of men have need of in these days.</p>
<p>Tell Tom his carreer [si<hi rend="italic">c</hi>] will require deep studies; and if he means to preach with any <foreign><hi rend="italic">birr</hi></foreign> [forcefulness] at all, it will behove him to study like a lion! Let him consider this, the obstinate dog, and set to work accordingly.&#x2014;</p>
<p>My Lectures are never yet gone to Press. I am <foreign><hi rend="italic">sweer</hi></foreign> [reluctant] about publishing them; expecting a great quantity of useless cackle if I do; and not being either tempted by money, or necessitated by the want of it, to set them forth till my own time,&#x2014;which latter is a great blessing. I begin to find it probable that they <hi rend="italic">will</hi> be printed now, some time in the course of the winter. We shall see.</p>
<p>Jane continues pretty well; but cannot go out these four days: we have a fierce frost, which is like to last for a while, it began so gradually, prefaced by three days of dry cold wind from the N. East.&#x2014; I walk largely, and am warmly clad.</p>
<p><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Alick. I have written far more than I meant; than I had any time for.</p>
<p>Our affectionate regards to one and all.&#x2014; I eat bacon every morning, and find it capital!</p>
<closer><salute>Your affectionate /</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name>
<ps><p>Has anybody sent Jean at Dumfries any word lately? I hear nothing from her.</p>
<p>John&#x2019;s Letter, I find, is too weighty!</p></ps>

<dateline><place>Chelsea</place>, Wednesday Night [<date when="1840-12-16">16 December 1840</date>]</dateline>
<salute>Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>We had your Letter yesterday morning; in the evening there came the inclosed beautiful little Note from my Mother.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1840-12-12">12 Dec.</date> She had written, &#x201C;how dose John look after his wanerins is he any way happy think you. like your self he is very dutifull in writting to me may an old Mothers blissing atend you both.&#x201D;</note> I like her little <pb id="pg-12-366" n="12:366"/>Notes very much; cramp, stiff, yet rational, affectionate, even a kind of grace in them! In their poor obstruction they are very eloquent to me.</p>
<p>Jane, I think, sent off some acknowledgement for her sumptuous gift; of which, as reasonable, she is very proud. She has never drawn the cash yet, being held close prisoner by the frost; tho&#x2019; I suppose this snow now may liberate her; and then there will be a rare bout of shopping!</p>
<p>We had the Wilsons and the Wedgwoods here last night: &#x201C;very agreeable&#x201D; as it is called; indeed they were friendly pleasant and pleased people: but&#x2014;I awoke at five! The night before, I had gone to H<hi rend="italic">y</hi> Taylor&#x2019;s, expecting no party; nor indeed finding any of much moment; nevertheless, tho&#x2019; it was a walk of four miles up and then down, in dry pleasant frost, it shattered me all to rags. I am a poor weak creature; I really do think, of the <hi rend="italic">irritablest</hi> constitution that had ever Life in it, or nearly so!</p>
<p>Yesterday at the <hi rend="italic">crossing</hi> in Knightsbridge leading past Wilton Crescent, I saw to my surprise a man <hi rend="italic">standing,</hi> with one leg slightly advanced and resting on its toe: you guess who it was&#x2014;Kenny!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Kenney.</note> We saluted cordially; whereupon he got under way again. He lives in this region somewhere, he said: he had an <hi rend="italic">old</hi> Petersham coat upon him; looked rather wizzened, and scraggy.</p>
<p>Today there came a large unlicked American;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> I sent him on his way. I was packing my Cambridge Books; I went on with the operation. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Hat Nichts zu bedeuten</hi></foreign> [It&#x2019;s of no importance].</p>
<p>I am just returned from carrying up said Books (to the Golden Cross),<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >3 Cross Lane, Longacre, from which the mail was sent out.</note> and then attending the Library Committee. It is a business that never profits me; that I wish to be done with. We are choosing a Librarian. Cochrane once of the Foreign Q. Review is not unlikely to be the man. He once chosen, I design to be off. Poor old fellow, he must be turned of fifty now; still hanging in the waters: he is willing to come at a salary of &#xa3;150, with prospect of augmentation if the Library succeed. The <foreign><hi rend="italic">gomerils</hi></foreign> [fools], this night, had very nearly decided to take some mere Clerk at a salary of &#xa3;100. The whole is to be settled at Candlemas. I really desire much to be out of it.</p>
<p>You are continuing with your Patient, for some time at least; I find it to be altogether reasonable. You seem to me to have what is as good as a very peculiar privilege there: that of staying as long as you like, <pb id="pg-12-367" n="12:367"/>and yet going almost as soon as you like! I am glad to consider your man as <hi rend="italic">settled,</hi> and giving you some composure for the present. &#x201C;Do the duty that is at hand!&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister, Works</hi> 24:11.</note> says Goethe: <foreign><hi rend="italic">Kannst auch auf ein Morgen hoffen</hi></foreign> [You can also hope for a tomorrow]<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Spr&#xfc;che in Reimen,&#x201D; &#x201C;Zahme Xenien&#x201D; 4, <hi rend="italic">Goethes Werke</hi> (Stuttgart, <date when="1867-00-00">1867</date>) 13:83.</note> &#x26;c</p>
<p>My reading toils along thro&#x2019; many interruptions. I am very much distressed about my Book occasionally. Heaven only knows what will come of it, whether ever anything.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Sterling wrote to John Carlyle, <date when="1840-12-14">14 Dec.</date>, to suggest that he undertake trans. from &#x201C;some of the better German books. Few could do it so well &#x26; you must have leisure enough.&#x201D; Referring to TC as &#x201C;True Thomas,&#x201D; he said that TC &#x201C;writes huge accounts of his puritanical performances. I suppose he will raise some sort of granite pyramid to old Cromwell&#x2014;&#x26; exclaim Look here you builders of plaster triumphal arches &#x26; makers of pasteboard trophies!&#x201D; John wrote to William Glen, <date when="1840-12-12">12 Dec.</date>, that he had recently seen TC and JWC in London, &#x201C;&#x26; thought them both looking quite as well as last year. He is busy studying the Times of Cromwell &#x26; the Commonwealth. I found him in a little front room, where he has collected some hundreds of volumes &#x2026; &#x26; set to work resolutely. &#x2026; The whole affair still seems a mass of dark confusion, but here &#x26; there bright spots are discernible, which may in time expand &#x26; cohere into something that will require to be spoken of.&#x201D;</note> <foreign><hi rend="italic">Voyons</hi></foreign> [Let us see].</p>
<p>I wrote a long Letter to the poor Dud Cochrane (who seems to be some kind of Editor at Hertford), purely out of charity, since my <hi rend="italic">six</hi>-o&#x2019;clock dinner;&#x2014;pure humanity as I say; for which <hi rend="italic">your</hi> Letter must now be all the shorter. I am <foreign><hi rend="italic">wae</hi></foreign> to think of the old man, so often baffled and tumbled; rallying yet once again &#x201C;to turn his peculiar acquirements to some use,&#x201D; as he says!</p>
<p>I met A. Cunningham in the street one day; he seemed brisk, and was walking fast, &#x201C;to drive off the cold.&#x201D; I have some thoughts of walking thither tonight; to see if I can purchase a sleep!&#x2014; Yesterday I fell in with Lockhart in the Grosvenor Square region: he turned with me down to Piccadilly. An effectual kind of man, &#x201C;and rational in speech as of the Greeks are few!&#x201D;<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Untraced.</note> I like well to talk a while with him. Unhappily he is growing very decidedly deaf, I fear.</p>
<p>Enough, dear John; it is time I took my smoke, and went out if at all tonight.</p>

<salute>Dear Murray,</salute>
<p>You may depend upon it I will bear well in mind this Letter of yours, in whatsoever it falls to me to do about Mr Simpson.</p>
<p>There was talk of him last Wednesday at the Committee Meeting,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter not found; TC passed it to Christie; see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18401224-TC-WDC-01">TC to WDC, <date when="1840-12-24">24 Dec.</date></ref> Simpson is probably Hunter Simpson, 6 Cheyne St., librarian of Edinburgh Select Subscription Library, Waterloo Pl. The committee had met on <date when="1840-12-16">16 Dec.</date>, when TC had moved that the librarian&#x2019;s salary be &#xa3;150 rather than &#xa3;100. Christie was to prepare a statement on the library&#x2019;s aims.</note> and one or two Letters were read respecting him: his character, very much as you now represent it, seemed well substantiated to the most; the doubt was whether he might be of active energetic habits for not only buying and classing of Books, but for modelling and executing the multifarious miscellany of general Business which would fall to him here,&#x2014;in regard to which the palpable fact of his not knowing London or its ways naturally weighed against him. Another circumstance, well worth his own consideration, is the fundamental question, Whether the salary they may be enabled to offer him here will in real value <hi rend="italic">for London</hi> exceed what he now has for Edinburgh? There are yet but 500 names; there may be, if the thing prosper, 5000. The skill of the Librarian, it is considered, will be a main element of success. With him, as with the thing he ventures on, it can at best be but a progressive business. The salary they could offer him at present will necessarily be very limited. A certain Dr Fisher resident here, highly recommended for learning, grammatical and bibliographical, for method, diligence, fidelity &#x26;c,&#x2014;and as to Business, <hi rend="italic">not yet tried,</hi>&#x2014;can, it is understood, be got for &#xa3;100.</p>
<p>The matter is to be decided on the first Wednesday of <date when="1841-02-00">February</date>. Fisher and Simpson seem to be the favourite candidates of this non-business sort. But Cochrane, once of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Quarterly Review,</hi> is also in the field, seems eager to do all he possibly can in lowering himself towards the present possibilities of the business, trusting by his activity to make it a great thing, and himself a great person, by and by. So far as I can judge, the odds at present were in favour of Cochrane&#x2019;s getting it, if he will have it on such terms as can be offered him.&#x2014; This is the true prognosis of the case; presented you not as by an official secretary but by a private eye-witness; such part of which as you see good and discreet (taking on <hi rend="italic">yourself</hi> the character of secretary!) you may <pb id="pg-12-369" n="12:369"/>communicate to Mr S. for his guidance. On the whole, tho&#x2019; they put my name on their papers, I have had in reality, at least since the thing became visible above ground, very little to do with it; wishing always to have less. So soon as a Librarian is got, I purpose to withdraw altogether. The true <hi rend="italic">working</hi> &#x201C;Hon Secretary&#x201D; is young Brother Christie (W. D. Christie Esq<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, 4. Harcourt Buildings, Temple) to whom, and not to me, if there be anything wanted, Mr Simpson should address himself. Or indeed, to the &#x201C;London-Library Office, 57. Pall Mall,&#x201D; where for the present a Clerk always is in waiting.</p>
<p>May it turn out well; and good reading be provided in this black benighted city,&#x2014;under Mr Simpson&#x2019;s guidance, if that be best for it and him!</p>
<p>Do you still study occasionally in old Scotch Covenanterism?<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ch. 9 in particular of Murray&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Literary History of Galloway</hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1822-00-00">1822</date>) was about the Covenanters; he had also written <hi rend="italic">The Life of Samuel Rutherford</hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1828-00-00">1828</date>), the seventeenth-cent. presbyterian divine and &#x201C;covenanting hero.&#x201D;</note> I read at present partly in that province; but with great want of material as attainable here. Can Baillie&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Letters and Journals</hi> be procured in Edinburgh by borrowing, buying, begging, on any supportable terms? Perhaps you yourself have it; for they say it is not uncommon in Scotland. In the British Museum here I can look at it, not read it; elsewhere not so much even as look at it after digging in a dozen Bookshops. Fraser&#x2019;s Edinburgh Agent is named Menzies, I think; I, on my side, make conscience of <hi rend="italic">returning</hi> Books that the charitable lend me!</p>
<p><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Murray; a merry Christmas to you, a cheerful hearth and whatever else is good to you and all yours!&#x2014; <closer><salute>With affectionate remembrance&#x2014;</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Jean,</salute>
<p>It is a good while since we heard any whisper of you, or you directly of us; only the Newspaper strokes give some assurance that nothing material is wrong. It is pity to trust to <hi rend="italic">strokes,</hi> now that Letters cost only one penny sterling! Here goes a little word for you, accordingly; till time give us convenience for more. <hi rend="italic">First</hi> however let me mend the <hi rend="italic">pen,</hi>&#x2014;hang it and the paper both for me!&#x2014;the wretched &#x201C;factory <pb id="pg-12-370" n="12:370"/>stuff&#x201D; in that and in all kinds which the Cockney people manufacture [letter torn]ys, grieves me often to the soul.</p>
<p>I know not if you were ever expressly informed that Jack was here with us lately for a few days; he and his Patient. They staid at a H&#xF4;tel in this region of the Town (less than 3 miles off, that is!) and we met as often as possible. I wrote an account of the whole thing to Scotsbrig; but perhaps they did not communicate it to Dumfries. Jack struck me at first glance as a very little <hi rend="italic">fatter</hi> and fresher than when we saw him formerly. His Patient is altogether a comfortable man,&#x2014;not <hi rend="italic">insane</hi>, properly speaking, at all; but so timorous, nervous, so very <foreign><hi rend="italic">blate</hi></foreign> [shy], as to be in continual danger of getting into quandaries that would infallibly make him be accounted mad;&#x2014;and send his great property to the Lawyers, as a <supplied>[con]</supplied>sequence. I have never seen the <supplied>[effects of?]</supplied> money so palpably noxious and even [letter torn] any other man. If he had his <hi rend="italic">bread to</hi> <supplied>[<hi rend="italic">earn</hi>]</supplied>, I believe he would ail no more than any of us, but be even a very amiable man!&#x2014; Jack talks ever and anon about quitting the situation; yet I should not wonder if he staid in it a good lucky time: it seems a situation <hi rend="italic">made</hi> for <hi rend="italic">him</hi> in his present humour; loose as the wind, yet &#xa3;1000 a-year attached to it; and as for its annoyances, he says himself, &#x201C;How can you gain &#xa3;1000 a-year without some trouble for it?&#x201D; If his own purposes do fix themselves at any time, he will surely quit, and ought to do it; but otherwise Why should he</p>
<p>My own reading goes on,&#x2014;dull as ditchwater, wide as the Solway sands: we shall see what comes of it, if anything. I also begin to feel a notion of <hi rend="italic">printing</hi> my Lectures that are written. There is small temp<supplied>[tation]</supplied> [word torn]<hi rend="italic">ney</hi>, perhaps it is all the bette<supplied>[r]</supplied> [words missing] to speak should come from within<supplied>[, not from w]</supplied>ithout.&#x2014; I live as solitary as I possibly can. My own thoughts are often ugly company, but generally far the profitablest. The <hi rend="italic">uglier</hi> they are, the more reason have you to keep company with them till they be got into order a little!</p>
<p>Jane sits prisoner in the house this week or more; decidedly healthier than last year, but still inadequate to this December climate. We have rigorous frost, with sky the colour of drugget; occasionally considerable powderings of snow. I fancy it will last, it began so deliberately. <hi rend="italic">Poo&#x2019; Gawna&#x2019;s</hi> (poor gardeners) are begging with frozen cabbage-stocks;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-09/lt-18361229-TC-JCA-01"><sic>9:110</sic><corr>TC to JCA, <date when="1836-12-29">29 Dec. 1836</date></corr></ref>.</note> I yesterday gave a wretched man a penny who was singing barefoot in the snow.</p>

<p><salute>My Dear Sir,&#x2014;</salute> Many thanks for the pamphlet and kind letter which have reached me this morning. In the former, as I glance over it, I already discover many things to be glad of; the latter is wholly a glad, welcome thing. We have an honorable printed &#x201C;Charge&#x201D; to the spiritual troops under your captaincy; and then the written Charge to a poor <hi rend="italic">non</hi>-<foreign>soldado</foreign> (alas!) of the <foreign><hi rend="italic">guerrilla</hi></foreign> or moss-trooper species,&#x2014;who hopes, nevertheless, that he perhaps fights on your side, too!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hare&#x2019;s letter to TC (the second &#x201C;charge&#x201D; here) not found. His enclosed pamphlet was <hi rend="italic">The Better Prospects of the Church: A Charge to the Clergy of the Archdeaconry of Lewes</hi>, later collected in <hi rend="italic">Charges to the Clergy of the Archdeaconry of Lewes, delivered &#x2026; from the year <date when="1840-00-00">1840</date> to <date when="1854-00-00">1854</date></hi>, 3 vols. (Cambridge, <date when="1856-00-00">1856</date>).</note></p>
<p>My expedition into Sussex grows ever the pleasanter to look back upon. It was transacted, as most of my journeys are, in a strange, preternatural humor, the fruit of sleeplessness, excitability, and nerves all torn to pieces; so that the whole world looks to one, like what it partly is, a spectral vision, proscenium to Hades, and hardly differing in quality from that! Months after, this and the other clear, living figure, clear beautiful scene, dawns out on you in quiet visibility of fact, all the lovelier for such environment. Uckfield, Cuckfield, Mayfield, Maresfield,&#x2014;all these fields and strange, blue-green, sunny, shady places are henceforth portion of my private picture-gallery.</p>
<p>That you ask me back to Hurstmonceaux<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >There are variant spellings.</note> is very gratifying to me. Why should I not say to myself, Yes, this too is possible one day? Your &#x201C;inhospitality&#x201D; remains forever memorable to me; how I plumped in upon you, weary, out of the waste-howling labyrinthic night, and found&#x2014;one waiting to devour me! There are few things beautifuller in the world and its wayfarings than the like of that.</p>
<p>For several months past I sit here, <foreign><hi rend="italic">perdu</hi></foreign> [lost], in a little back room, sunk to the ears, or almost deeper, in Cromwelliana, Laudisms, Covenanterisms,&#x2014;the dullest, dreadfullest stuff I ever engaged with in this world. The vapidest <hi rend="italic">Moniteur</hi> of the French Year One<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Moniteur</hi>, founded in <date when="1789-00-00">1789</date>; said by TC in the <hi rend="italic">French Revolution</hi> to be &#x201C;official, safe in the middle&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 3:27).</note> was Homeric in comparison with these &#x201C;continents of cinders.&#x201D; <foreign><hi rend="italic">Ah me, aus dem wird Nichts</hi></foreign> [out of this comes nothing],&#x2014;except one&#x2019;s own deliverance from it by and by! Hurstmonceaux has no books on this subject. <pb id="pg-12-372" n="12:372"/>I find it difficult to get books; and then wish almost it had been impossible.</p>
<p>Darley was here not very long since, but saw only my wife. He speaks of Hurstmonceaux as of Eldorado. Milnes passed along towards France two weeks ago; he looks happier than ever, and even threatens to grow <hi rend="italic">fat</hi>,&#x2014;fatter than bard beseems. We hear occasionally of Sterling. I think of late years I have noticed <hi rend="italic">a book</hi> lying in him, occasioning various pains and phenomena. Lucina<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Goddess of childbirth.</note> be good to him, poor fellow!</p>
<p>Did you see a &#x201C;tragedy,&#x201D; by Mrs. Gore, called Dacre of the South, or some such thing, the scene of which is your castle, Hurstmonceaux?<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Dacres of Herstmonceux were among the ancestors of the Hares.</note> It has nothing else remarkable. We are overrun with dramas at present, or &#x201C;legitimate dramars,&#x201D; as most of the authors call them here.</p>
<p>Will you commend me in all kindness of remembrance to your fair sister,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably Maria Hare, his sister-in-law, rather than Georgina Hare, his half-sister.</note> begging for me some reciprocity, if that be possible.</p>
<p>All lies bound in its winding-sheet of ice and snow, and gray, moaning skies. Strange to think that the sun and the everlasting blue do exist and shine above it all!</p>
<p>Good be with you, in all senses of that word.</p>

<p>My Brother, to whom I forwarded your Letter, communicates his answer<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC&#x2019;s letter is written on the same sheet as John&#x2019;s of <date when="1840-12-22">22 Dec.</date></note> in passing; and I cannot but add a word, expressive of my continued sympathy in this matter, and also of my decided adherence to the opinion John pronounces of it here. Poor William would be altogether overset by a change of place and revolution in his daily habits, in such a humour as he is in about it; this infallibly would be the first result; and what good or what ill would farther follow from it, remains at best problematic, a thing to be <hi rend="italic">tried</hi>. Where <hi rend="italic">he himself wishes to be</hi>, there, unless it be a place evidently hurting his bodily health or the like, is first of all the place where he ought to be.&#x2014; His Letter is still very confused: the strong soul buried under mountains of confusion; wrestling and weltering like a giant under painful dreams! <pb id="pg-12-373" n="12:373"/>We must say still, While there is Life there is Hope. If it please God, he may yet be restored to us all; like a Traveller brought back from a far, very <hi rend="italic">far</hi> country!&#x2014; Pray send him my love when you write next.

<salute>Dear Christie,</salute>
<p>Inclosed is a Letter about Simpson the Candidate for the Librarianship: the writer is a Dr Murray, an Edinburgh literary man of respectable character, whom I knew long ago. Let it be <foreign><hi rend="italic">in retentis</hi></foreign> [held] till this mighty matter get settled.</p>
<p>I had yesterday an immense Letter from Cochrane; he is coming up on the <date when="1841-01-02">2<hi rend="italic">nd</hi> of January</date>; and, I suppose, will invade your quarters then. He has sent a considerable Pamphlet of Testimonials, printed several years ago, without effect, in reference to the Advocate&#x2019;s Librarianship and the Signet d<hi rend="italic">o</hi>,&#x2014;in both of which adventures he failed.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >J.

I leave them with Brittan,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mr. Brittan, the clerk at 57 Pall Mall mentioned in <ref target="volume-12/lt-18401218-TC-TM-01">TC to TM, <date when="1840-12-18">18 Dec.</date></ref>, temporary sec. of the London Library; the minutes of <date when="1841-02-20">20 Feb. 1841</date> record that he was voted an extra &#xa3;10 in addition to the &#xa3;50 he had already received.

One other point: the Pamphlet, it seems, is <hi rend="italic">unique</hi>, the safety of it must be guarded like the apple of one&#x2019;s eye!

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I meant to write you a good long Letter today; but here is John Mill come in (at the wrong hour!), and I have no means of proceeding. Take one word to assure you that, in spite of the frost, we are all well.</p>
<p>A short Note came from Jack yesterday, and a Newspaper today: he seems to be going on perfectly well; driving over to Portsmouth &#x26;c: <hi rend="italic">travelling</hi>, you know, from of old was his passion; and here surely he has enough of it! He promises to be here again before long.</p>
<p>Jane has staid in the house, close as a dormouse, these two weeks and more: she gets up every morning to make breakfast, does not try <hi rend="italic">coughing</hi> at all yet; and on the whole is much better than in late winters.</p>
<p>I sent a Letter to Jamie; then one to Alick: I have been expecting some syllable of answer to that latter every day; in a day or two it will be <hi rend="italic">too late</hi> for sending the Book: one word would be well worth <hi rend="italic">two</hi> pence!&#x2014; Not one of them all writes so punctually as my dear good Mother; her last little Note, like all her Notes, is a real little blessing to me. I sent it first to Jack to read; then to Jean. Jean herself has sent me nothing this long time. I begin to consider that perhaps she is making baby-clothes, poor little creature! Some of you send word about her.</p>
<p>Here is an express <hi rend="italic">message</hi> from Mill, that he is come to walk &#x26;c! I must step up stairs and speak to the man.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mill wrote to Sterling, <date when="1841-01-05">5 Jan. 1841</date>: &#x201C;I had a long walk with Carlyle on Xmas day&#x2014;he is as usual&#x201D; (Mineka 13:463).</note></p>
<p>What becomes of you, dear Mother, in this bitter frost? For all sakes, spare not the coals; put on your flannel dress, put on all sorts of flannel to keep out the cold. <foreign>Adieu</foreign> dear Mother, for this day! I will write again very shortly. Good be with you all. <closer><salute>Ever your affectionate</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>We have had several little flying notices from you; the last a Dumfries Newspaper yesterday, which I readdressed, and forwarded to <pb id="pg-12-375" n="12:375"/>Glen. I had seen the Article on <hi rend="italic">E. Irving</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;No. X. The Late Rev. Edward Irving,&#x201D; in &#x201C;Our Gallery of Literary Men,&#x201D; signed G. G. [Gilfillan], <hi rend="italic">Dumfries Herald</hi>, <date when="1840-12-17">17 Dec.</date></note> before; it is seemingly by the same hand that reviewed me there (one Gilfillan?) a your [<hi rend="italic">sic:</hi> young?] Burgher Minister of Dundee. Aird himself sent the Paper to us: Jane has cut out the article; which is, for the present, in the hands of Mrs Hamilton and Mrs Irving;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Isabella Irving, Edward&#x2019;s widow, and her sister Elizabeth, Mrs. William Hamilton.</note> to be returned hither. Archibald Glen&#x2019;s Letter was also forwarded; I adding a few lines to yours, in confirmation of them. To take Glen from Carstammon, where he is comfortable and at home, has always seemed to me, a very questionable project. The poor fellow is evidently not a whit better; plunging and weltering amid bottomless confusions as before. The chances, alas, are greatly against his ever recovering.</p>
<p>Jane forced her way up to Charing Cross, and got her money,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >There was a suboffice (which could cash money-orders) at 15 Charing Cross; the money was from John, as mentioned in <ref target="volume-12/lt-18401216-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, [<date when="1840-12-16">16 Dec.</date>]</ref>.</note> about a week ago: she has not any other occasion whatsoever stirred out since the frost began. Today and yesterday, it is considerably more <hi rend="italic">venomous;</hi> one of our detestable frozen fogs, which pierce you into the bone. Jane has been daily at the making of breakfast hitherto; yesterday she complained of an incipient cold however; and today, tho&#x2019; she called herself a little better, I would not let her come. I hope she will not break down yet: it is a great aggravation for the whole business of existing here, as well as a distress for herself. She is evidently much stronger this year; but really we have a temperature today, which a Cossack might sink under.</p>
<p>I get on as badly as need be with my studies; cannot begin to write, yet get next to no good of reading, &#x26;c &#x26;c. I retired into the back room some days ago; but shall be forced to retreat into the old one, this is so villainously cold, draughts in every corner of it.</p>
<p>Yesterday Mill came to me to walk; the first time almost for a year. He has few holidays, every Sunday he is <hi rend="italic">engaged</hi>,&#x2014;I suppose with his old <foreign><hi rend="italic">Platonica</hi></foreign>;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Harriet Taylor.</note> a rather dreary service now! We talked a great deal, not unreasonably; till poor Mill, who had come out unwrapt, grew almost frozen with cold, and we had to hurry home. This week I have been at <hi rend="italic">three</hi> parties, or quasi-parties,&#x2014;curiously inviegled; Sir R. H. Inglis&#x2019;s with the Wedgwoods, Mrs Austin&#x2019;s, and on a night before, a quiet mutton-chop with Darwin! Pickwick was at Inglis&#x2019;s, and a host of dull black people, clerical and legal: dull as ditch water. Dull parties do one almost no ill&#x2014;or good.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-12-376" n="12:376"/>I must out my dear Brother; it is verging towards three!&#x2014; Some visitor is up stairs; I shall take good care <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to ascertain who.</p>

<salute>Dear Christie,</salute>
<p>There is much in what you say about Cochrane that seems to me altogether reasonable;&#x2014;well worth considering, and balancing against what is to be said on the <hi rend="italic">other</hi> side. He is evidently <hi rend="italic">older</hi> by ten years than one could have wished. He <hi rend="italic">may</hi> have a shade of &#x201C;obstinacy&#x201D; in him,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; the testimonials praise him as a man of courtesy and good temper, and I in my experience of him never saw anything else: I can well believe, at least, that he will not be so easily <hi rend="italic">guidable</hi> as one of the mere Clerk species might be;&#x2014;the <hi rend="italic">guidablest</hi> of all quadrupeds is a starved <foreign>cadger&#x2019;s garron</foreign> [hawker&#x2019;s nag], reduced to skin and bone; no kicking or plunging from <hi rend="italic">him;</hi> but, alas, withal there is no <hi rend="italic">go</hi> in him! What I have known or got to believe of Cochrane is that he possesses sense, energy, discretion, enterprise; that his whole life has been a qualifying of himself for the management of such a business&#x2014;and that now he would undertake it, sharing the risks along with us, in such a spirit as promises, were reasonable field granted him, the best results for us. He certainly does not write in a very oracular manner; but he writes not without clear sense of something that he means, of something that he ought to mean: and elegant writing is not the chief point with us. I think it one of the most promising symptoms our Adventure has ever exhibited, that a solid man, of grave years, of much acquirement, capability and experience, is willing to embark his life-interest upon it, and make it either prosper or fail himself to prosper. We should not lightly throw away such a possibility.</p>
<p>For the rest I do not so much fight for Cochrane as for the principle of action involved in choosing him. A saving of &#xa3;50 annually to get a Clerk instead of a Manager, and Fellow-Adventurer hopefully on mature <pb id="pg-12-377" n="12:377"/>calculation committed to the scheme, and <hi rend="italic">bound</hi> to make it succeed,&#x2014;seems to me the Deplorablest thrift. Lewis<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sir George Cornewall Lewis.</note> says we must feel our way, save our &#xa3;50, get a subordinate man, and then when we have succeeded appoint some Cochrane over him! It is like sending out a military expedition for conquest in foreign countries under <hi rend="italic">a Serjeant</hi>, with strict proviso that <hi rend="italic">when</hi> he has made conquests, we will send a General! Alas, too clearly, there will never be any General needed.&#x2014; I must oppose this serjeant-scheme as altogether unwise,&#x2014;if there be any general, on not impossible terms, attainable for us. Perhaps this other Hertford man, the Sub-editor,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> <hi rend="italic">is</hi> a general? If so let him produce probabilities of it superior to those of Cochrane, and it is for him and not Cochrane that we must all vote. <hi rend="italic">Does</hi> he in reality still continue a candidate? I understood you to announce that he had given up. It is very possible that he in that case might ultimately prove to be the likelier man. But for Heaven&#x2019;s sake, no Clerk when there is a real Librarian attainable! Let us all decide upon that.</p>
<p>My notion of the Librarian&#x2019;s function does not imply that he shall be King over us; nay that he shall ever quit the address and manner of a servant to the Library; but he will be as a <hi rend="italic">wise</hi> servant, watchful, diligent, discerning what is what, incessantly endeavouring, <hi rend="italic">rough-hewing</hi> all things for us; and, under the guise of a wise servant, <hi rend="italic">ruling</hi> actually while he serves. Like a Nobleman&#x2019;s Steward: that is in some sort the definition of him. We may make more or not so much approximation to getting such a man. But I am deeply sensible that with no such man we are still hovering among the shallows, a cargo to win or to lose. No enterprise in this world ever prospered without some one man standing to it not <foreign><hi rend="italic">par amours</hi></foreign> [for love] but heart and soul as a business. Lewis says, Yes, but Christie will be that man. Dare you undertake so much? If so, it will very greatly alter my computation; I shall feel greatly disposed to vote for whom you like! But fancy a boat propelled now by this man giving it a kick and going his ways; and there by another giving it a kick and going his ways! There must absolutely be a man with the tiller always in his hand,&#x2014;or the voyage will end in <foreign><hi rend="italic">Limbo Patrum</hi></foreign> [the half-way zone between earth and heaven].</p>
<p>Cochrane writes to me this morning a most despondent response<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> to the Letter he has got from you. The endless <hi rend="italic">hours</hi> (from 8 to 6) &#x26;c &#x26;c strike him altogether dumb. I explained that these are as yet but <hi rend="italic">suggestions</hi>, that nothing is fixed but the &#xa3;150;&#x2014;that on the whole he had better still persist in coming up on Saturday, in looking at the <pb id="pg-12-378" n="12:378"/>business and letting us look at him face to face. Could I not see you tomorrow evening here? I broke the back of a good forenoon today, and except a fruitless word with Lewis made nothing of it. There is another Candidate with Testimonials &#x26;c in Pall Mall:<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly Hunter Simpson, who had been given the London Library&#x2019;s address of 57 Pall Mall to write to; see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18401218-TC-TM-01">TC to TM, <date when="1840-12-18">18 Dec.</date></ref></note> pray look you after him.</p>
<p>There, dear Christie, are my notions about this Librarianship; but I promise always to avoid obstinacy, to lie <hi rend="italic">open</hi> to light; nay I may profess that my first wish about the thing is not for this man or that man but to get my own poor self <hi rend="italic">honourably winded out</hi> of it in some way before long.</p>
<p>I will willingly do whatever I can about Lists. But what in the world can anybody do? It is not a universal Library of the King; alas, we have only &#xa3;2,000 to cover the whole field of knowledge with! I think one of your first things should be the buying of a good Book of Bibliography. Such a thing ought to be in the Library at any rate; one or more such. Brunet&#x2019;s<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jacques Charles Brunet (<date when="1780-00-00">1780</date>&#x2013;<date when="1867-00-00">1867</date>), French bibliographer who compiled a <hi rend="italic">Manuel du libraire et de l&#x2019;amateur de livres</hi> (Paris, <date when="1810-00-00">1810</date>).</note> in French is very common. But there is one <hi rend="italic">Ebers</hi> [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>]<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Friedrich Adolf Ebert (<date when="1791-00-00">1791</date>&#x2013;<date when="1834-00-00">1834</date>), German librarian and bibliographer, who ed. <hi rend="italic">Allgemeines Bibliographisches Lexikon</hi>, 2 vols. (Leipzig, <date when="1821-00-00">1821</date>&#x2013;<date when="1830-00-00">30</date>).</note> (I think) which I have seen in one volume that seemed much preferable.</p>
<p>Can you lend me the Signet Library Catalogue,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The most recently printed was <hi rend="italic">Catalogue of the Library of the Society of Writers to the Signet</hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1837-00-00">1837</date>).</note> or any good Library Catalogue? I could mark in certain provinces what Books I understand to be good. Our first set of purchases ought to be popular, entertaining; What people will read and <hi rend="italic">continue to read</hi> (which last narrows the field greatly): that is, to a great extent, the rule for us.</p>
<p>Is anybody drawing up a Code of Regulations? This must by no means fail, and will take jargon enough before it get completed. How needful is a <hi rend="italic">man</hi> for us in these very days!</p>
<p>The Lord forgive you for making me scribble all this stuff!&#x2014; Come and see me tomorrow, or <hi rend="italic">soon</hi> at latest.</p>

His second visit to Europe, after appointment to a chair at Harvard, was in <date when="1835-00-00">1835</date>, when, with a letter of introduction from Emerson, he had called on JWC, <date when="1835-05-21">21 May</date>. On <date when="1835-05-30">30 May</date>, TC called on the Longfellow party inviting a return visit that evening. Meanwhile Longfellow (already an admirer of <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi>) read TC&#x2019;s life of Schiller, &#x201C;a work of rare merit.&#x201D; He breakfasted at Cheyne Row, <date when="1835-06-03">3 June</date>, after which they presumably said goodbye.

In <date when="1838-00-00">1838</date> he is said to have praised TC for his &#x201C;universal benevolence&#x201D; (E. Wagenknecht, <hi rend="italic">Longfellow: a Full Length Portrait</hi> [London, <date when="1955-00-00">1955</date>] 25), and perhaps this feeling persisted long enough for him to send his first vol. of poems, <hi rend="italic">Voices of the Night</hi> (Cambridge, Mass., <date when="1839-00-00">1839</date>), which TC mentions.

<p><salute><hi rend="small-caps">My dear Sir</hi>,&#x2014;</salute>About two weeks ago arrived your letter. &#x2026;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> From you, since the morning when we parted at the end of Leigh Hunt&#x2019;s Row, some fitful reports and notices have reached me; one in particular which, I remember, frightened us all,&#x2014;the rumor that you were in that fatal steamer<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> where so many perished! Happily, this was soon contradicted; and about the same time there came an indistinct message that a copy of your Poems had been left for me at Fraser, the bookseller&#x2019;s. It now beckons to me from one of my shelves, asking always, When wilt thou have a cheerful vacant day? &#x2026;</p>
<p>Alas, my dear sir, what a wretched scrawl is this, with the worst of pens; time, composure, and all elements of social intercourse entirely denied me! It is a hideous, immeasurable treadmill, this smoky soul-confusing Babylon; I address one prayer to the heavens that I were well out of it, before it take the life from me! Happy you who sit in Cambridge, Old or New, with clear air around you, with liberty to commune with your own thoughts, not compulsion to commune with the infinite hubbub of Cockney thoughts and no-thoughts, which&#x2014;<foreign><hi rend="italic">mag der Teufel holen</hi></foreign> [may the Devil take]! But, patience! we must have patience, and shuffle the cards.</p>
<p><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear sir, and Good be with you ever.</p>
