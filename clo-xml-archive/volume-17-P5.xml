<salute>Dearest,</salute>
<p>I hope you got the little Note of yesterday; I had a good run with it down to the Post-Office, and got thither two minutes, as I understood, within the time.</p>
<p>In the evening we went, that is, Jack and I, to tea with the Chorley&#x2019;s. Great explosion of welcome &#x26;c; the two women were to be off to Tremadoc in Wales early this morning; the eldest son,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Rutter Chorley, in fact the second son.</note> who is the cleverest of all the Chorleys (and really a superior man) was then to be left alone in a wide house; he earnestly entreated our &#x201C;putting up&#x201D; in his establishment; an invitation with which I should not wonder if John, to whom also failing me it was specially addressed, should yet comply. He (John) once &#x201C;saved the life&#x201D; of a Cousin of the Chorleys &#x26;c &#x26;c.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified, possibly in his practice in Rome, where he had known friends of the Chorleys; see <ref target="volume-17/lt-18430802-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1843-08-02">2 Aug.</date></ref></note> He is ill lodged at &#x201C;the Feathers H&#xF4;tel,&#x201D; a nasty place full of grease and bagmen; and Chorley will rejoice in any kind of company that even seems to be intelligent. We are to dine there today, &#x201C;at five o&#x2019;clock,&#x201D;&#x2014;almost so soon as I have done this writing.</p>
<p>Jack&#x2019;s situation at present gives me real distress. He is without plan, even for the passing day. Who <hi rend="italic">can</hi> be other than unhappy in such circumstances? I have long ceased advising the man; but if by any method of speech or silence I could forward him towards a deliverance from that most despicable and most painful of situations, right gladly would I. Last night the Chorley women and he got into a <hi rend="italic">cross-fire</hi> of talk, the Chorley man talking to me simultaneously and expecting me to talk, at the same small table,&#x2014;a thing, as you know too well, which I cannot do! For relief out of what was growing real martyrdom, I had to rise and propose an adjournment.</p>
<p>Yesterday the Paulet and Geraldine were here, &#x201C;to appoint a day,&#x201D; Jeannie having written to them that we were coming. Nobody saw them. Today they came again, before 12 o&#x2019;clock,&#x2014;while Baby was still making breakfast for me; for I had <hi rend="italic">two</hi> &#x201C;treacle sleeps&#x201D; last night, and the second of them did not end till 11 a.m., the good Baby respecting rigorously my somnolent privileges! To the Paulets I reported myself &#x201C;unwell&#x201D;; and it was all settled in my absence: Tomorrow we <pb id="pg-17-4" n="17:4"/>are to go out in all the stateliness of an omnibus at noon, then to be received into the Paulet carriage, and rolled on to Formby, where I <hi rend="italic">will</hi> look into the Lodgings, if any; then to dinner at five o&#x2019;clock,&#x2014;John Martineau was proposed but not accepted:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Almost certainly James Martineau.</note> finally <hi rend="italic">home</hi>, as I hope, early, and the affair well ended. Another bathing-place called Hoylake (I think)<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coastal village in Cheshire, on S side of the Mersey, 9 mi. W of Liverpool.</note> is proposed to us: this also, on Thursday, I may have perhaps an opportunity of looking at. Goody&#x2019;s views as to the matter will probably be here before that; and then it will all be before me, and I shall retire over to Annandale to meditate it a little. I at present think of going to Annandale by the first Steamer; this, I find, sails at 3 in the morning of Friday; which means as late on Thursday as we like, and one night of the &#x201C;destruction of Babylon&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Isaiah 14:23 and 21:9.</note> on board the thing itself. I will and must take the first, unless I grow a little less bilious: I am yellow as saffron, with really a great supply of bile,&#x2014;and on the whole in pressing need of being well let alone! After all, however, I have the assurance that there will be, that there already is, a kind of benefit in it for me.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC wrote in his Journal, <date when="1843-10-02">2 Oct.</date>: &#x201C;My biliary <hi rend="italic">preternaturalism</hi> seems to increase the more I travel: perhaps there is at bottom some increase of nervous energy? The indolent stupor, in which as in my most supportable condition my days in the country flow on, is scandalous to think of! I seem to myself like a man buried in the mud, in the Augean horrors. It cannot be helped? Perhaps I ought to be quieter under it.&#x2014;&#x201D;</note></p>
<p>Today little Mary and Mrs Martin&#x2019;s Daughter went off to Helensburgh;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >To join John Welsh.</note> indeed their Steamer is hardly yet out of the River, I suppose. Little Baby has still to stay for some week or ten days; her paintings, joinerings, and new maid-servantings and what not, being still in an incomplete state. The good little Baby; she is a real consolation to one here.</p>
<p>I have written to the Chapman &#x26; Hall people, with an &#x201C;inscription&#x201D; and a plan for the Varnhagen Book such as you suggest; I also despatch a chivalrous Note of intimation and regret to von Willisen the Major General who is &#x201C;plumb and more.&#x201D; I wish really I had seen him. Pray tell me the title of the &#x201C;little Book&#x201D; the other German brough<supplied>[t]</supplied>. <note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.

<p>You do not mention what the fate of Mazzini and Lady Harriet was: I am somewhat curious to know! John Mill has there ventured on a stroke of engineering, which I durst hardly have imitated. However, I hope they did not leave one another &#x201C;cold&#x201D;? <foreign><hi rend="italic">Voyons</hi></foreign> [Let us see].</p>
<p>Dear Goody, what more can I say to thee, bilious wayworn as I <pb id="pg-17-5" n="17:5"/>am, and the paper just ending? That thou art a brave little dame after all; whom I would not part with for five pounds and more,&#x2014;in fact that I love thee very considerably indeed. <closer><salute>And so <foreign><hi rend="italic">Gott befohlen</hi></foreign> [God guide you] I send thee kisses and blessings.</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My Dearest,</salute>
<p>Your Letter was delivered with two thundering knocks while we sat at breakfast this morning. It was well worth delivering, well worth reading! Great work going on at London, &#x201C;on my honour&#x201D;! The &#x201C;Lady Baring&#x201D; narrative is altogether excellent: &#x201C;one of those female souls, whom no man escapes,&#x201D; whose net takes all manner of fish! I am rather curious to see how the Mazzini adventure will develope itself. John Mill and Robespierre and all the rest of him is, as you say, too absurd.</p>
<p>With a sigh of thankfulness, the <hi rend="italic">inverse</hi> of the shriek or howl which <hi rend="italic">would</hi> have been, I survey the Shuttleworth dinner, rejoicing that I was not there! <foreign>Ach Gott</foreign>, I know it all; the horrid shark face of Pedant Lewis, Unfortunate-female A.,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lewis was a scholar as well as politician. JWC had compared Sarah Austin to a &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">retired</hi> unfortunate female.&#x201D;</note> little Milnes himself congealed, and the whole body of poor human individuals fallen sheer into vacuum. Bishop Cuittikins too&#x2014;for what we have <hi rend="italic">escaped</hi> Lord make us thankful!</p>
<p>I have written Mariotti&#x2019;s Note and Nickisson&#x2019;s; written Stewart Ker&#x2019;s;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Stewart Ker (b. <date when="1802-00-00">1802</date>), businessman; see <ref target="volume-13/lt-18411226-TC-SK-01"><sic>13:328</sic><corr>TC to SK, <date when="1841-12-26">26 Dec. 1841</date></corr></ref>.</note> and have still to write a word into Annandale;&#x2014;and then on the spur of the moment Pauletdom to do! We were to go out at 11 o&#x2019;clock, and then be driven to Formby: but the day is wet, tho&#x2019; promising to dry itself now; but the Coadjutor it seems cares no straw about Seabathing or any Formby: wherefore we will take our time. It is already past 11. I feel no call towards Paule<supplied>[t]</supplied>dom;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> but shall take a more deliberate view of the Lady Patroness today, since such is my fate. Jack is already here in waiting; and his cigar, alas, will not last forever! A man and brother without any aim is but a sorrowful neighbour anywhere.</p>
<p>We went last night to Chorley, who had all in apple-pie order; cigars, coffee-pots of ample bounds to wind up with; and philosophic speculation in the highest abundance all evening. He is a very good <pb id="pg-17-6" n="17:6"/>man that Chorley too. &#x201C;Why is he an unhappy man?&#x201D; I could wish him a good little wife, of some sort,&#x2014;for they have all money now, these Chorleys; and a man in that case should have a &#x201C;wife to keep him <hi rend="italic">unasy</hi>.&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Like the &#x201C;man in Ballinacrazy&#x201D;; see <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390202-TC-MAC-01"><sic>11:9</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1839-02-02">2 Feb. 1839</date></corr></ref>.</note> Chorley has very considerable intellect, and a most honourable, timidly fastidious, and truly rather intere<supplied>[s]</supplied>ting<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> character of mind. He again pressed us to come and stay with him; and failing of me, did get John, who was not unwilling, I suppose, to quit his greasy hostel for good quarters in Chorleydom. There perhaps for a day or two he may be a real acquisition. Chorley and I attended him down to &#x201C;the Feathers&#x201D;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The hotel.</note> about ten o&#x2019;clock, and there with a car cut him triumphantly loose, and came all off together. They dropt me in Rodney Street, for I understood Walter MacGregor was here waiting for me. Walter was gone before my arrival: he had left a dinner-invitation for Thursday; this, after deliberation, has been declined,&#x2014;changed into a dinner for Walter here on that day.</p>
<p>The Annan Steamer sails on Friday at 3 in the morning. The hour is highly inconvenient; but I still have my eye on that conveyance. That is the likeliest still; but you shall hear tomorrow what specially has been decided on. I cannot stand this <foreign><hi rend="italic">brashing</hi></foreign> [rushing about] and daily dining: ought I not to be off?</p>
<p>Go to Ryde, if you see it doable, dear Goody. <closer><salute>And so <foreign>Adieu</foreign> for this day; and pity me and love me.</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>It is impossible to exaggerate the hurry I am in; but you must have a word from me, according to promise.</p>
<p>The first Annan Steamer, I find, is to sail at 3 in the morning of Friday: it will be at Annan some time about the middle part of the day, therefore, on Saturday. The hour of starting is terribly bad; but I still think it likeliest that I may try that. Jamie<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Carlyle.</note> may send again to the <pb id="pg-17-7" n="17:7"/>Post-Office tomorrow; and if he get no other word, look for me on Saturday. I will <hi rend="italic">write</hi> again tomorrow at any rate, indeed; that will be the surer way.</p>
<p>We are both well; Jack is well lodged now with an old friend of mine, a Mr Chorley not far off this; some of whose friends he has himself known at Rome. He does not seem to have shaped any plan for his movements yet;&#x2014;and indeed, I suppose, feels that for the present, he is snug enough; and might go farther and fare worse.</p>
<p>Dear good Mother this is a poor letter, one of the poorest of the poor; but I have many to write this morning, and Jack is already here waiting for me to go out to a place they call Seaforth<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Paulets&#x2019; home.</note> where we have to dine &#x26;c today. I am heartily tired of dining, and cannot stand much more of it!</p>
<p>There is a Letter from Jane this morning; all well there. I add no other word, but my love and blessings to you all. If it please Heaven, we shall soon see one another face to face once more!</p>

<salute>Dearest,</salute>
<p>I am in the agonies of packing and leave-taking today, with the prospect of a Macgregor dinner at night, and then a lodging in the mere chaotic belly of an Annan Steamer;&#x2014;I am somewhat unwell to boot; and therefore in no condition to write beyond what is indispensable.</p>
<p>There came a Newspaper from you this morning; no Letter. Your next Letter must be directed Scotsbrig, Ecclefechan: I sail thither at 3 this morning. Innumerable cowardly desires and persuasives besiege me all morning <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to go yet: but I see very well that they are at bottom only <hi rend="italic">cowardly</hi>, fruits of mere dastard Indolence; and there in spite of &#x201C;rain,&#x201D; of &#x201C;3 in the morning,&#x201D; of &#x26;c &#x26;c, I persist in going; and write to Jamie for the Gig to that effect. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Allons</hi></foreign> [forward], I ought to be thro&#x2019; this; I ought to be into what lies beyond this!</p>
<p>Yesterday, in the interval of thunderplumps, we did accomplish Pauletdom; reached all three the sacred domain about 3 o&#x2019;clock; sumptuous <pb id="pg-17-8" n="17:8"/>lunch, of which I ate some ten grapes, and enjoyed a smoke on the sunny lawn; then came a drive to Formby (<hi rend="italic">nine</hi> miles off, instead of three), and the most entirely desolate savage-looking establishment of human habitations,&#x2014;I cannot call it <hi rend="italic">village</hi>, for the huts are sprinkled over a whole parish, bound together by deep-rutted narrow sand-lanes with green stagnant ditches and <foreign><hi rend="italic">midden</hi></foreign>-holes;&#x2014;about <hi rend="italic">two</hi> miles from the Sea; and without &#x201C;lodging&#x201D; in it that we could notice for anything bulkier than a rabbit! That will never do; not that, clear enough! We returned home half an hour beyond dinner time,&#x2014;along roads all <hi rend="italic">paved,</hi> and so loud that not a word could be heard except it were spoken in a shout. Paulet and Geraldine were waiting patiently; Mrs Paulet was still far from any haste Our reception and welcome was of the most exquisite. Great disappointment because I could not stay all night. Geraldine was terribly busy about <hi rend="italic">tobacco</hi> &#x26;c, but otherwise looking well and quieter than formerly. She bade me say that she would be at her post on Saturday to receive the Mudie<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Juliet; see <ref target="volume-16/lt-18430720-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1843-07-20">20 July</date>]</ref>.</note> at Manchester.&#x2014; On the whole it is a curious establishment Pauletdom, which I am not sorry to have seen;&#x2014;where some time or other I could spend a day or two with satisfaction. The Lady seems to me a singular mixture of <foreign><hi rend="italic">haveril</hi></foreign> [silly person] and sultana; a thoroughly innocent-hearted person,&#x2014;very &#x201C;detached,&#x201D; but handy enough to converse with.
Paulet, I believe, to be a really good character too; but could almost guess, by the ways of him and by hints I got, that he must have spent his early life and fashioned his manner in the trade of <foreign><hi rend="italic">Contrebandiste</hi></foreign>,&#x2014;a fragment he of the Giant Smuggler too strong even for Napoleon!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mark Etienne Paulet (d. <date when="1850-00-00">1850</date>), Swiss businessman; see <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410719-TC-JWC-01"><sic>13:189</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1841-07-19">19 July 1841</date></corr></ref>.

<salute>Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Mr Chorley and you, I think, would get a little taste of rain before
you reached Sandon Terrace:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Chorley lived at No. 2.</note> I hope you neither of you caught damage by your hospitable escort of me. I heard rain pattering on the deck before you had time to be home.</p>
<p>As for me I at first in vain essayed sleeping in that upper shelf of the cabin; men were snoring, men were talking, men were drinking; it was the nastiest shop in all Nature: I was twice aroused from incipient sleep by some loud sound or other; and then, about half past three, gave up the attempt, finding that the ship was now about departure, and that I might have leave to smoke a cigar in the open air. Liverpool and the Sea and environs lay all grey-visible, the lights growing <pb id="pg-17-11" n="17:11"/>pale everywhere; no rain, but the world all wet as a sponge: I surveyed with many meditations the objects by land and sea, and thought of the good friends and complicated kind relations that existed for me in that region once all foreign. The cigar fairly over I returned to my shelf in the Ship&#x2019;s belly again, and there in spite of very fate did fall asleep for four good hours; reawakening to the sight of St Bee&#x2019;s Head,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >St. Bees Head, cape S of entrance to Solway Firth.</note> and one of the beautifullest mornings, which held up into a rainless, often beautifully brilliant day, and enabled me to pass the weary hours of hovering and hanging off in the shallows of the Solway with tolerable comfort after all. It was past five before we got to Annan-foot; neither Jamie nor any soul that I had ever seen before was there recognisable.
The Letter which I put into the receiving office in Bury Street before 3 o&#x2019;clock had not been forwarded (as I conjecture) to the General Office till the time for the <hi rend="italic">London</hi> Mail: at least it had not got to Ecclefechan; for Jamie had an express over at the right hour in the morning, who found nothing! I got a glass of brandy and water, at Benson&#x2019;s,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Benson, Queensbury Arms Hotel, High St., Annan.</note> with a biscuit, for dinner; and then a Gig, which brought me up handsomely enough about half past seven to our Mother&#x2019;s door: she herself and Jenny running down to welcome me, as a right glad arrival tho&#x2019; an unexpected one. This is my travel&#x2019;s history since we parted in the Clarence Dock.</p>
<p>Our good Mother seems wonderfully lively and cheerful, tho&#x2019; she looks a good deal paler than when I was last here. She speaks about all things, about Alick too, in her old rational and peaceable manner. Jennie is active, orderly; has the children well under command. I think great improvement might be made in our Mother&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">diet</hi>, were there one of proper knowledge and authority here to do it. Isabella is weaker than when you went away; she lies mostly in bed; they have a wet-nurse for the child.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jenny (probably christened Janet), b. in the spring.</note> Of Jamie I have not yet seen very much; he was from home last night, &#x201C;buying lambs&#x201D;; and did not return till I was almost ready for bed: &#x201C;the price of lambs has fallen one half,&#x201D; lower than he ever saw it before; <hi rend="italic">he</hi> struggles along, be the price and prices what they may. Ben Nelson, as I learned from my Gig-driver, has <hi rend="italic">lost</hi> his place (the Gig-driver knew not why at all), and a Stranger from Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> is there in his stead.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ben Nelson (<date when="1783-00-00">1783</date>&#x2013;<date when="1845-00-00">1845</date>), TC&#x2019;s old friend, timber and slate merchant, Ednam St., Annan; see <ref target="volume-01/lt-18210109-TC-JAC-01"><sic>1:304</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1821-01-09">9 Jan. 1821</date></corr></ref>. In <date when="1838-00-00">1838</date> he had been apptd. bank manager of the Southern Bank of Scotland, which was taken over by the Edinburgh-Leith Bank in <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date> (see <ref target="volume-10/lt-18381226-TC-JAC-01"><sic>10:249</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1838-12-26">26 Dec. 1838</date></corr></ref>).</note></p>
<p>As for me I feel terribly smashed; and altogether decided, for one <pb id="pg-17-12" n="17:12"/>thing, on having <hi rend="italic">rest</hi> now for a space, and doing <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi>. You are partly expected here, desired here and there is still room enough for you. I said, it seemed to me likeliest you would go by Darlington and return before long thro&#x2019; Carlisle. Perhaps this very evening there may be some news of you? If you be still with Mr Chorley, offer him my very kind regards for all his at<supplied>[ten]</supplied>tions<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letters omitted.</note> to us. He seems to me a really superior man, who in spite of all obstructions will utter himself yet in some profitable way, if he have years given him.</p>
<p>I wish before quitting Liverpool you would go to the Tobacconist in Bury Street (where Arbuckle<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS. The tobacconist was probably Barnett Isaac Levy, cigar manufacturer, 14 Berry St.</note> and we were), and buy me three shillings worth of their <hi rend="italic">cheap</hi> cigars (&#x201C;C.H.&#x201D;s I think they call them); you get ten for a shilling: they are the cheapest going, and much better than any of the thrice-wretched &#x201C;Havannahs&#x201D; tapsters offer you in inns. Ten of them yesterday proved a real convenience to me. Also do not forget <foreign>fusees!</foreign>&#x2014;</p>
<p>I hope, before long, some one of your many possibilities will ripen for you into the likeness of a feasibility; you will then, following it out in spite of whatever may obstruct, feel much happier than you do.</p>
<p>I am in no case to write; have already written fully three times as much as I counted on, and must cease now.</p>
<closer><salute>Ever your affectionate</salute></closer>
<name>T. Carlyle</name>
<ps><p>My Mother is very proud of the two Books you have sent her; and is at this very moment deep in one of them, which I have cut up for her.</p>
<p>We have every symptom of a wet night!&#x2014;</p></ps>

<p><salute><hi rend="small-caps">Dear Cousin Jeannie</hi>,&#x2014;</salute>Very probably our Doctor gave you some account of my embarkation; what a wretched, sleepy, muddy, confused piece of dim, drowsy squalor it was: nevertheless, thanks to the good bright sunshine, and the silence of all human babblement and business that could concern me, I got along unexpectedly well, and made on the whole an average voyage of it. What ought not to be forgotten, <pb id="pg-17-13" n="17:13"/>is that Alick&#x2019;s man had done <hi rend="italic">his</hi> full duty to the luggage and message, delivering both <hi rend="italic">to the Captain</hi> in a most punctual manner&#x2014;as I discovered towards night when near Annan: the Steward and most other persons had been asleep when the said luggage and message had been received by the Captain; at my arrival, the Captain was gone to sleep, the sailor in charge was nearly altogether drunk, and the steward, only half awake, in that dim element, had never heard of me before! A bed and berth, too, had been secured for me, as I discovered when near Annan! The remedy is, no man should go in these vehicles except by day.</p>
<p>Having arrived here, I decide with my whole soul and body on <hi rend="italic">lying down to sleep</hi> for a moderate while! It is a thing I have pressing need of. Further is not yet decided.</p>
<p>As for you, good Babby, I think you should hasten off to Helensburgh while the weather is good, while at least the day is long, and there &#x201C;enjoy Nature&#x201D; a little,&#x2014;and if you have any leisure at all, read &#x201C;in the works of your parent&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >I.e., TC&#x2019;s; see <ref target="volume-17/lt-18430808-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1843-08-08">8 Aug.</date></ref></note> till you have completed them!</p>
<p>Pray give that letter to our Doctor in the meanwhile. In his uncertainty he named Maryland Street as his Post Office. And forget not hearty compliments to your Brother Alick my kind landlord, and Brother John who is too unwilling to sing. Among the multitudes of things that begin to dawn on me into distinctness out of the confusion of the last four weeks, I do not think there will be a prettier little spectacle anywhere, or &#x201C;image of the mind,&#x201D; than that of a certain little cousin of mine, whom you poor foolish child <hi rend="italic">know</hi> nothing about, tho&#x2019; living so close to her!</p>
<p>And so be a good girl, and may a blessing always be with you, dear little Jeannie.</p>

<salute>My Dearest,</salute>
<p>Here I am since yesternight, a most wearied tide-tossed man; and proceed to despatch you a line significant of that fact, there being hardly any other to signify.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-17-14" n="17:14"/>I took leave of Maryland Street and all the remaining Cousins at their hour of bedtime on Thursday evening; and stept over to Chorley, who is a late sitter, and had invited me for that hour. Walter M&#x2019;Gregor had been with us; looking much better than formerly, tho&#x2019; limping with a lamed shin at present. Little Jeannie and all the Cousins parted from me with kind wishes and, I do believe, hospitable hearts: the Doctor had come over to fetch me; and so towards midnight we wended along Rodney Street; found Chorley with his lights all trimmed, and a small supper-collation on the table, which being declined he at once removed it, and substituted cigars and mere conversation in its stead. His conversation was not bad; two o&#x2019;clock came on, and we all sallied forth to the slumberous streets again, and my two guides landed me at last in the Chaos of the Victoria Steamer, and took their leave. In the Victoria Steamer, it was, as I say, <hi rend="italic">Chaos;</hi> cloudy, dim, bewildered, half-asleep more than half drunk;&#x2014;altogether like a nasty damp, clammy Dream of confusion, dirt, impediment and general nightmare. I had no bed; could hear no tidings of my luggage till a drunk sailor helped me to find it&#x2014;it will be a winter evening&#x2019;s tale for us some time! All well, if it end well.
At half past three in a rainless but thoroughly drenched morning we got into the Mersey Stream; and I, at liberty now to smoke at least (for in the Dock they permit no fire, no light that is not sealed within a bottle) took leave of Liverpool, gazing on it in the ghastly damp dawn really with some interest. I could have staid longer, had not my &#x201C;constitution&#x201D; been so bad,&#x2014;nay, had I not spurred myself up with the greatest severity to <hi rend="italic">shake away idleness</hi>, and keep my set time. All regrets, suggestions &#x26;c I could not but admit to be mere indolence, <hi rend="italic">lazinness</hi>, on my part; and therefore I had spurned them out of doors.</p>
<p>The voyage itself, thanks to a bright sunshine all day, was far tolerabler than it promised to be: nay, in spite as it were of very fate, I snatched some five hours of sleep at various dates, from various shelves and benches;&#x2014;I on the whole fared well enough. My poor native Annandale never looked so impressive to me that I remember. Black rain curtains hung all around; but there, when I saw it, was a kind of <hi rend="italic">bewept</hi> brightness: all seemed so small, remote, eternally foreign; I said to myself, &#x201C;There among these poor knolls thy life-journeyings commenced, my man; there didst thou <hi rend="italic">begin</hi>, in this outskirt of Creation; and thou hast wandered very far since then,&#x2014;far as Eternity and Hades, so to speak, since then!&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>
<p>Nobody was there to receive me; Jamie&#x2019;s Letter, owing to the Liverpool Post-Office which is not equal to the London one, had not <pb id="pg-17-15" n="17:15"/>reached him, tho&#x2019; he inquired for it, at the time set. I got a kind of gig straightway at Benson&#x2019;s Inn, and came hither to kind welcome, to dinner, tea and sleep, all in the lump almost. My determination is to rest here for a space; I feel quite smashed, done up, and pressingly in need to pause and do nothing whatever.</p>
<p>I have spread out my things; cut up even a piece of my Iceland Grammar; I sit in the little easternmost room, saved from interruption; I really will rest now. My poor Mother is very cheery; but very pale, thin, and has evidently been suffering much since I saw her. She speaks about Alick and all manner of things quite composedly; sees clearly that there was the finger of Necessity in it, and no remonstrance to be made. Jenny is here; very active, orderly; and has her two poor little lassies in good trim, in right obedience; today I heard her teaching them to read,&#x2014;poor little Jenny. Isabella is fallen worse again; is kept mostly in bed, thro&#x2019; sheer weakness, they have a wet-nurse for the infant: Jamie goes on in the old cheerfully stoical manner in these &#x201C;worst of times.&#x201D;&#x2014; I declare I am sorry for all people!
Yesterday, was and<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> old dirty feckless-looking man in tattered straw-hat sitting in the Steamer, notable to me all day; at night a rugged hearty kind of old woman came on deck, who proved to be his wife: they had been in America, where all their children 11 in number were, &#x201C;but the auld man, ye seiy, wadna bide,&#x201D; tho&#x2019; they had sent for him; and so here he was with his old dame come daundering back again to beggary and the Hawick<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Town in Scottish borders, ca. 44 mi. NE of Dumfries.</note> native soil! Poor old devil, I was heartily sorry for him;&#x2014;and the sturdy old wife I honoured her as a true heart of oak, the main stay of her old man, who grinned intelligence as he saw Scotch land again. Their goods were in certain <foreign>duddy pokes</foreign> [ragged cloth bags] and one old painted chest, of which the woman carried the key; her sturdy way of undoing the padlock had first attracted my attention to her. Is not life a &#x201C;joyous&#x201D; kind of thing to this old woman? &#x201C;I declare I&#x2019;se quite shamed,&#x201D; she said, &#x201C;to gang hame sae dirty: a&#x2019;s dirty, and I could get nothing washed!&#x201D;&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>O Goody, why do I twaddle to thee about all and sundry in this manner! Really silence would be preferable, and the saving of a penny stamp. I shall perhaps grow a shade sensibler now that I am left a little to myself. For one thing I decide not to write <hi rend="italic">so often</hi>.</p>
<p>Art thou gone to Ryde? What <hi rend="italic">art</hi> thou doing; what is all the world doing? There will be no Letter tonight, I fear;&#x2014;but tomorrow! And next day&#x2014;or at latest Tuesday, the day <hi rend="italic">after</hi> that!</p>

<dateline>Sunday forenoon [<date when="1843-08-06">6 August 1843</date>]</dateline>
<salute>My own Babbie</salute>
<p><hi rend="italic">Have you comprehended</hi> me the least in the world? I fear not&#x2014; I fear that your faith in me, steadfast as it is, must have received a <hi rend="italic">shock</hi> more or less, from this prolonged silence. If so; now hear &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">the solution</hi>&#x201D; and be sorry for having doubted a moment. Babbie I <hi rend="italic">could</hi> not write to you while my husband was there, because I could and would and needed to write to <hi rend="italic">thee</hi> more confidentially than to <hi rend="italic">him</hi> even, and I felt that it were placing you in an embarassing predicament to send you letters which he naturally would wish to see and which you would not feel at liberty to show him&#x2014;better&#x2014;easier and more prudent, to write always straight to himself than to be writing as it were <hi rend="italic">for</hi> him <hi rend="italic">thro</hi> you or else <hi rend="italic">for</hi> you to the exclusion of him&#x2014; Not that I have had any mysteries of iniquity to communicate&#x2014;but all my bits of household troubles&#x2014;all my sympathy with <hi rend="italic">you</hi> in <hi rend="italic">your</hi> troubles, which with <hi rend="italic">two</hi> such men<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC and John Carlyle.</note> must have been considerable&#x2014;all my amusement at their <hi rend="italic">planlessness</hi>&#x2014;their <hi rend="italic">lionizing</hi> &#x26;c &#x26;c&#x2014; all my apprehensions of having John landed with <hi rend="italic">me</hi>&#x2014;all in short of the <hi rend="italic">intimate little</hi> things which it came naturally to say to Babbie and to no person else all <hi rend="italic">that</hi> it would have puzzled you to repeat to <hi rend="italic">them</hi>&#x2014;and when I tried to <hi rend="italic">compose</hi> a letter to you a letter for the public&#x2014;<foreign>Ach Gott</foreign> I found it not possible&#x2014;I have got so into the way of <hi rend="italic">splashing</hi> off whatever is on my mind when I write to you, without forethought or back thought that I must go on so if at all, to the end of the chapter.
Well! now the coast is clear again&#x2014;and now my Babbie how do you do? For <hi rend="italic">me</hi> I have been but indifferently all last week Carlyle would perhaps tell you that I had been to Tunbridge Wells, and that feeling out of sorts next day I took an immense doze of shower bath to enable me to <hi rend="italic">do</hi> the Kay Shuttleworths&#x2014; The step I believe was <hi rend="italic">too</hi> energetic&#x2014;all that cold water drove my cold not <hi rend="italic">away</hi> but <hi rend="italic">in</hi>&#x2014;and so I have been in a <hi rend="italic">curious</hi> and rather wretched state ever since&#x2014;</p>
<p>I seriously think of going for three or four days to the Isle of Wight on Tuesday&#x2014;for the good of my <hi rend="italic">body</hi>&#x2014;and thro&#x2019; my body of my soul&#x2014; <pb id="pg-17-17" n="17:17"/>going actually with <hi rend="italic">Old</hi> Sterling The poor old fellow is utterly broken down of late weeks and one may go with him anywhere now, into the deserts of Siberia even without apprehension of being <hi rend="italic">ravished!!</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC had told Jeannie in <date when="1843-04-00">April</date> that she was not &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">safe</hi> travelling alone with him&#x201D;; see <ref target="volume-16/lt-18430425-JWC-JW-01">JWC to JW, [<date when="1843-04-25">25 April</date>]</ref>.</note>&#x2014; In fact he <hi rend="italic">ought</hi> not to be from home alone&#x2014;is too feeble to be without some one to take care of him&#x2014;(<hi rend="italic">varnish!</hi>)&#x2014; Carlyle wrote to me several notices of bathing quarters Formby &#x26;c &#x26;c&#x2014;and asked if I would <hi rend="italic">like</hi> to come and take up my quarters there after he had paid his visit in Annandale&#x2014; Remarkable proposition to take up my quarters in the place w<supplied>[h]</supplied>ere<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> all that I wished to see were no longer to be seen!
He did not seem to perceive somehow that your all being at Helensburgh needed to make any difference in <hi rend="italic">my</hi> desires after a seabathing place <hi rend="italic">near Liverpool</hi>&#x2014;What on earth were <hi rend="italic">Liverpool</hi> to me more than Kamchatka<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Peninsula, NE Russia; see <ref target="volume-04/lt-18260402-TC-JBW-01"><sic>4:67</sic><corr>TC to JBW, <date when="1826-04-02">2 April 1826</date></corr></ref>.</note> under these circumstances, indeed were worse than the most unknown region&#x2014;for it would be a sort of cruel mockery&#x2014; He wants I think to bring his mother over there for seabathing&#x2014; Well&#x2014;that is all as it should be&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">she</hi> likes seabathing and the distance were convenient for her&#x2014;but in Gods name What uses were there for <hi rend="italic">me</hi> in the business&#x2014;a pretty lark to have all the botheration of settling my house here and going off twohundred miles to weary&#x2014;and be fretted from morning till night in a dreary seabathing establis<supplied>[h]</supplied>ment<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> on the Mersey with M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle&#x2014; To be sure there would be the Paulets and Geraldine left! But if I am to do with offputs I think I could find still better offputs nearer home</p>
<p>I am out of humour&#x2014;so I had better speculate no further on this particular question&#x2014; I had letters from both Mrs Paulet and Geraldine yesterday&#x2014;full of enchantment over the &#x201C;Angel visit&#x201D;&#x2014;and comprising even John in their <hi rend="italic">questionable hero-worship</hi>. &#x201C;Jeannie looked nice and pretty as she always does&#x201D;&#x2014; &#x2014; Carlyle seems to have been rather charmed with M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Paulet and not displeased with Geraldine&#x2014;indeed with all his hatred of being made a lion of he seems to tolerate those who make him so marvelously well.&#x2014;</p>
<p>I also have been doing a bit of hero-worship&#x2014;a thing not much in my line nowadays&#x2014;I see so much of it that the whole thing has grown to look mawkish and absurd to me&#x2014;</p>
<p>But my &#x201C;youthful enthusiasm&#x201D; as John Sterling calls it&#x2014;which I had long supposed quite extinct kindled at the advent of&#x2014; &#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;Father Mathew! Indeed Babbie I regard that man as the greatest Benefactor <pb id="pg-17-18" n="17:18"/>of his century and knowing him within reach of me I could not rest till I had told him so in so many words&#x2014; I said to Robertson when he was here on Friday evening&#x2014;that I <hi rend="italic">must</hi> see and speak to Father Mathew&#x2014; Well said he you have only to fix your time and I will get an introduction for you and myself from M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Hall<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably Anna Maria Hall.</note>&#x2014; No sooner said than done&#x2014; I fixed next evening&#x2014;that is to say last night&#x2014;when he was to be administering the pledge in the Commercial road<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The main thoroughfare of the borough of Stepney, E of the City of London; a poor area. Fr. Mathew&#x2019;s mission there was <date when="1843-07-31">31 July</date> to <date when="1843-08-06">6 Aug.</date> The <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, <date when="1843-08-05">5 Aug.</date>, reported: &#x201C;Father Mathew seems to practise as well as to preach total abstinence. During the twelve hours he was on the ground, he never tasted food nor drank anything, and he was hard at work talking and administering <supplied>[pledges]</supplied> during the whole of the time. His speeches were temperate, and imbued with kindly feeling, and he took great pains to convince his hearers that he did not wish to advance the interests of any particular party, either in religion or politics, and declared that the Protestants in Ireland, to great numbers of whom he had administered the pledge, had received him with the same cordiality as the members of his own church.&#x201D;
Since the start of his mission, about 30,000 persons took the pledge (<hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, <date when="1843-08-12">12 Aug.</date>).</note>&#x2014;a place a mile and half beyond the furthest stretch of the Omnibuses&#x2014;eight or nine miles from Chelsea&#x2014; Robertson presented himself with the letter at five and we started in the Omnibus and arrived on the scene of action about seven&#x2014;the most impressive scene I ever witnessed in this world&#x2014;all the theatrical exhibitions that I ever assisted at melted into one could not have so moved me&#x2014;there were faces, both of men and of women among those who received the pledge which will haunt me to my death&#x2014;such concentrated wretchedness struggling a last deadly struggle as it were with the powers of darkness&#x2014;such hope founded on despair&#x2014; Oh such things in those faces! pale as paper some of them and covered with cold sweat&#x2014;it was unspeakable&#x2014;heartbreaking&#x2014; &#x2014;I never&#x2014;saw before the lot of humanity so fearfully laid bare&#x2014;nor the mercy of heaven shining so brightly as from the eyes of that good Priest&#x2014; He was on a scafolding with one or two gentlemen and a number of common-men and policeman&#x2014;the scafolding was higher than my head and had no visible means of access to it&#x2014; We handed up our letter to a Policeman who took it to Father Mathew where he was standing alongside of an american capptain<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> who was making an address&#x2014;presently the Father himself came to us&#x2014;he reached down his hand to me with the look of the best of Fathers&#x2014;but what more to do?&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">we</hi> could not mount <hi rend="italic">he</hi> could not discend&#x2014; &#x2014;I saw a piece of rope hanging from the edge of the scafolding like a festoon&#x2014;remember I was in a moment of wild enthusiasm&#x2014;I placed a foot on the rope&#x2014;still holding the Fathers hand&#x2014;with the other hand seized the edge <pb id="pg-17-19" n="17:19"/>of the scafolding and swung myself God knows how onto the boards&#x2014;landing of course in a horizontal position at his feet&#x2014;he gave a cry&#x2014;thinking I must fall back&#x2014;but in a moment I was on my feet safe and erect&#x2014;I said to Robertson in coming home&#x2014;&#x201C;What must the Father have thought of me arriving at him in that way like a rope dancer&#x201D;&#x2014;to which he answered roguishly &#x201C;Oh no, M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle <hi rend="italic">not</hi> like a rope dancer&#x2014;&#x201D; I dare say I showed my legs dreadfully. He made me sit down in the only chair for a moment and then taking me by the hands as if I had been a little girl he led me to the front of the scafolding to see him administer the pledge&#x2014;a sight which affected me as I have told you&#x2014;I was all in tears and could hardly help laying down my head on the good mans shoulder&#x2014;and taking a good cry there before the whole crowd&#x2014; &#x2014;Robertson who had rejoined me&#x2014;insisted I should come away that I was going to faint&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">that</hi> I knew I should not do&#x2014;but it did seem more prudent that I should come away&#x2014;but then followed the grandest piece of folly (if you like to call it so) of all&#x2014;I thought &#x201C;I shall never see this truly good man again&#x2014;let me carry away some remembrance of him and leave him some remembrance of me&#x201D;&#x2014; What had I that I could give?&#x2014;only three <hi rend="italic">rings</hi> on not one of which could be parted with&#x2014;I had no <hi rend="italic">silk handkerchief</hi>&#x2014;what then?
I bethought me joyfully of a very beautiful memorandum book which had been given to me by old Sterling and was then in my reticule with some memoranda on it&#x2014; I hastily and privately rubbed out these with my handkerchief&#x2014;then I drew the Father aside and said to him hurredly&#x2014;only half intelligibly I dare say&#x2014;give me one of your medals&#x2014;I cannot take your pledge but I want a medal to keep for your sake and do you keep <hi rend="italic">this</hi> for <hi rend="italic">me</hi>&#x2014; He looked astonished for a moment as I <hi rend="italic">thrust</hi> the memorandum-book into his hand. and then puzzled&#x2014;for as it happened he had no <hi rend="italic">silver</hi> medal and he wished to give me a silver one&#x2014; &#x2014;but he observed one attached to a green ribbon round the neck of a Gentleman where he had just placed it&#x2014;he gently removed it from his neck again, saying let me have this <hi rend="italic">you</hi> shall have another in a few minutes and then taking it off the string he laid it in my hand with such a benignant smile&#x2014;and such a devout <hi rend="italic">blessing</hi>&#x2014; I only wished that he had laid his hand on my brow as on the poor women&#x2019;s&#x2014; I came away finally, more <hi rend="italic">excited</hi> than ever Gambardella himself was when his &#x201C;hairs&#x201D; were at the longest!&#x2014; I could not speak on the way home&#x2014;I could not sleep when I went to bed&#x2014;I could not even this morning subside into my &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">normal</hi> state&#x201D; till I had written Father Mathew a long letter&#x2014;expressing something of the meaning which I had found it utterly impossible to <hi rend="italic">articulate</hi> last night&#x2014; Now I have told you this long story of myself very <hi rend="italic">ill</hi> I am sure&#x2014;have made it merely <hi rend="italic">absurd</hi>&#x2014; <pb id="pg-17-20" n="17:20"/>whereas it was something else as well it was a mixture of the absurd and the deeply touchingly earnest</p>
<p>&#x2014;Juliet Mudie goes off to Manchester tomorrow morning and I have just packed the picture and the frame into her trunk&#x2014;to the care of Geraldine who will easily get them forwarded to you&#x2014; I do not think they can possibly take any hurt&#x2014;wrapped up as they are&#x2014;</p>

<salute>Dearest,</salute>
<p>No man in all Britain can have less material to write a Letter on than I this day! I have <hi rend="italic">slept</hi> largely in the literal sense, and in the metaphorical sense almost entirely, ever since I arrived here: the weather is wet, the roads generally muddy; I have travelled nowhither but to the top of Scotsbrig Moor; seen or suffered nothing that is worth any record other than silence. Goody&#x2019;s Letter, forwarded from Liverpool on Saturday, and the Newspaper of yesterday by the same route: <pb id="pg-17-21" n="17:21"/>these are literally the main arrivals since I landed here. Donothingism is the thing I have all along been passionately seeking in these Travels; and here or nowhere seems to be the place for carrying it on! Seriously I think it will do me good; and all these confused tumblings hither and thither will do me good,&#x2014;if I had once got them fairly summed up and set in order. We shall see.</p>
<p>My Icelandic Grammar does not promise well; one of the dullest even of Grammars hitherto;&#x2014;but perhaps it will mend. A deep, unutterably deep <hi rend="italic">sadness</hi> takes hold of me often: but this too I have no wish to avoid; this too will do me good. I feel it like the voice of innumerable <hi rend="italic">dumb</hi> things within me and about me struggling to <hi rend="italic">speak if they could</hi>. These things I believe speak to no man in a dialect of the &#x201C;joyous&#x201D; kind; they are dumb wholly and forever if spoken to in that. I want to be alone here for a little while.</p>
<p>Jack sends no word of himself; I suppose him to be waiting for a response from his Darlington Roman friend,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Rainey (<date when="1801-00-00">1801</date>&#x2013;<date when="1884-00-00">84</date>; <ref target="volume-17/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/23026"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), anatomist; lived mainly in Italy for his health, <date when="1837-00-00">1837</date>&#x2013;<date when="1842-00-00">42</date>; demonstrator at St. Thomas&#x2019;s Hospital, <date when="1846-00-00">1846</date>; known as one of the ablest instructors in London.</note> that he may set out from Liverpool thitherward, and then return perhaps to Scotsbrig before long. They speak of him with praise here, tho&#x2019; not without criticism too. He is thought by Jamie to have not a little contributed to the getting of poor Alick off this summer; Jamie thinks had he not been here, Alick might very possibly have lingered till the season was past. One thing this Doctor said, which I learned last night, which I will now report in the quarter best deserving it,&#x2014;this namely: &#x201C;That Jane, he believed, was the best Wife within the four corners of London!&#x201D; This is a fact, he thinks. Did anybody ever hear the like?</p>
<p>On thursday, if the weather by chance prove good, I must try to get to Dumfries: I should get my business done there, I might then sleep here perhaps still <hi rend="italic">better</hi>. The Gig is all repaired, and new harness on it, and a good horse to draw it: one might go to Dumfries if the clouds would shut themselves a little!&#x2014; It is very disastrous the aspect of all things here; soaking rains drowning the poor people&#x2019;s hay and crops; ugly ruin, in so many other ways, having already done its work on many! Ben Nelson is out of his Bank-business; suddenly; owing to some mistake about a Bank-parcel, say some; owing to habitual tippling of whisky, say others. Poor Ben!&#x2014; Did I tell you that we saw Father Mathew giving the pledge at Liverpool? Ah yes I did; and I still think often of him. Had Ben and others taken his pledge ten years ago, it had been better for them. But ruin, at any rate, goes his way. John M&#x2019;Turk is out of Pennersaughs and Scotland; ruined out; &#x201C;keeps <pb id="pg-17-22" n="17:22"/>a Spirit-Vault&#x201D; now at Preston,&#x2014;poor M&#x2019;Turk!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For previous problems at the farm (1 mi.

<salute>Dear Jean,</salute>
<p>I got here according to engagement; and according to engagement too I have done almost nothing but <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi> since I arrived! Jenny is here, very active tho&#x2019; suffering from something of a sore-throat or undeveloped cold. Our Mother is fully as well as I expected; busy reading &#x26;c; and glad as ever to see her son again. Poor Isabella is weak, lies mostly in bed; I have never seen her yet but once.</p>
<p>My Mother and I purpose making up towards you about Thursday. Thursday if the weather be fair,&#x2014;but it is a most uncertain weather; raining, or continually liable to rain! I myself too am in a <hi rend="italic">bilious</hi> way, not in good travelling condition just now. The safest will be <hi rend="italic">not to <pb id="pg-17-24" n="17:24"/>look for us till we come:</hi> but we do aim towards Thursday, if things answer <supplied>[our]</supplied> hopes.</p>
<p>Jack parted with me on the deck of the Victoria about half past 2 on Friday morning. He is staying with a friend a Mr Chorley at Liverpool; Chorley and he escorted me so far and would not take their leave till there. I have written to Jack, but heard nothing. I fancy he will go round by Darlington, where he has a visit to pay; and then perhaps return this way.</p>
<p>I am weary tonight; and thirsty for tea:&#x2014;besides what use is there in writing when I can hope to see you soon!</p>
<p>My kind regards to James and all the younger branches that can receive them. And so goodnight till Thursday, dear Sister.</p>

<p><salute>Thanks, Dearest,</salute> for your good little Note, which contrary to expectation came home for me by the Messenger last night. It had arrived on Sunday by the evening mail; they got me a Newspaper which had been in Liverpool, by the Morning Mail. Perhaps there will be something tonight too. I am well supplied with <foreign><hi rend="italic">Canty</hi></foreign> [lively] little Notes; and a great comfort they are to me.</p>
<p>All day I have done nothing,&#x2014;but read drowsily in my dull Icelandic Grammar, which is nearly done now; and talk drowsily. I have slept four <hi rend="italic">long sleeps</hi> in succession, during these nights I have been here: a feat which is unparalleled with me these several years. If there be credit in that, I may be honoured: if not, alas not; for my whole function at present is to sleep. All day again it has rained; I have sat in this little eastern room (where you used to sleep) with a fire and the window generally up; something eminently stagnant in that grey infinite of dim wet, far from the haunts of &#x201C;busy men,&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;In the busy haunts of men&#x201D;; Felicia Hemans, &#x201C;Tale of the Secret Tribunal&#x201D; pt. 1, 203.</note>&#x2014;a few turnip-hoers returning home from their attempt at labour the only event all day. Pigs too have grunted, ducks quacked; and one immense woman wrapt in plaid took to raking the cattleyard; Middlebie burn beginning to run red! Human nature could require no stiller kind of life.</p>
<p>I did intend partly to write to Robertson as you request: I suppose <pb id="pg-17-25" n="17:25"/>&#x201C;the Reform Club&#x201D; is his address?<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Liberal club in Pall Mall.</note> But on the whole there is nothing pressing. Your Peter Buchan (his Christian name is Peter), as he emerges in my memory, figures there as somewhat of a goose: I suppose I shall have to subscribe for his poor Book, but to recommend it in any way will be questionable. My recollection of the last rather is that it was a watery very questionable jumble of old doggrel pieced together with new: in fact it is very dim in my memory; the only thing clear is the effigies of Peter himself, one of the mournfullest <foreign>Pilgarlocks</foreign> smit with the poetic furor you could see in a summer day!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Peter Buchan (<date when="1790-00-00">1790</date>&#x2013;<date when="1854-00-00">1854</date>; <ref target="volume-17/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/3826"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), printer and ballad collector. TC refers to his <hi rend="italic">Ancient Ballads and Songs</hi>, 2 vols. (Edinburgh, <date when="1828-00-00">1828</date>), with a frontispiece portrait by James Forbes. TC means &#x201C;<foreign>pilgarlock</foreign>&#x201D; in the sense of &#x201C;poor fellow,&#x201D; not &#x201C;bald headed,&#x201D; as Buchan has a full head of hair in the portrait and was described by Sir Walter Scott, in <date when="1828-00-00">1828</date>, as &#x201C;a hirsute poet of Peterhead.&#x201D; Scott, Jeffrey, David Laing, and Terrot subscribed to the work. Buchan had been collecting <hi rend="italic">Ancient Scottish Tales</hi> since <date when="1827-00-00">1827</date> and seeking a publisher since <date when="1829-00-00">1829</date>.
He announced its publication in <date when="1840-00-00">1840</date> but apparently failed to find subscribers. This is probably the book TC refers to. Buchan&#x2019;s Peterhead printing firm had failed, and he lived in Aberdeen from <date when="1831-00-00">1831</date> and in Glasgow from <date when="1838-00-00">1838</date> to about <date when="1844-00-00">1844</date>.

<salute>Dear Spedding,</salute>
<p>It is many a day since I had your Letter;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1843-05-26">26 May</date>; see &#x201C;Carlyle and the Speddings&#x201D; 14&#x2013;16. Spedding discusses <hi rend="italic">Past and Present</hi> at some length, and while agreeing with its attacks on Sir Jabesh (Peel) puts in a word for his fellow magistrates and poor law guardians: &#x201C;little dilettantism there.&#x201D; He ends, &#x201C;In fine I have read this your last utterance with more understanding and edification than any of the preceding ones&#x2014;which I hope argues the growth of Grace in one at least of your disciples.&#x201D;</note> and often have I promised myself a pleasant hour in answering it; but the hour and the pleasure never came,&#x2014;shut out by the unkind Destinies !</p>
<p>For the last four weeks and more I have been wandering incessantly; restless as the ancient Shoemaker of Jerusalem (whom sonnet-writers call &#x201C;the Undying One&#x201D;),<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Wandering Jew, who refused Christ permission to rest at his door and was condemned to wander endlessly; cf. <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340521-TC-JWC-01"><sic>7:170</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1834-05-21">21 May 1834</date></corr></ref>.</note> and with about as much satisfaction, I suppose, as his: I have seen Rebecca turnpikes lying in wreck; orthodox wise Bishops, at least one such,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Connop Thirlwall.</note> studying to be wise in the worst of times,&#x2014;and saw myself, not without surprise, kneeling as if in prayer in the Chapel of Laud! I have been on the top of Snowdon, looking into mere bottomless <hi rend="italic">mist;</hi> I have encountered endless rain-deluges, distressing aspects of every kind; and seen all I wish to see of Wales, or indeed of the world at large, for some time to come! It was right pleasant to me to take refuge here, in my good Mother&#x2019;s cottage, once <pb id="pg-17-27" n="17:27"/>more; and fling myself down to sleep,&#x2014;as I have continued doing, in a most grateful and harmless manner, ever since my arrival, I may say.</p>
<p>At present, reawakening to some consciousness, I can dimly see Skiddaw again; and not dimly but very clearly remember the kind of friends I have under the vapours there. Whether I shall get to see you this time is very uncertain;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC had visited Spedding at his home, Greta Bank, in late summer <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>.</note> the weather is broken into continual rains, I feel myself as if broken, all locomotion, or change farther, somewhat of a horror to me.

<p>Tell me at any rate where you are to be for the next fortnight. Perhaps some impossibility on your side may itself put an end to all dubieties on mine! I have a Brother, whom I parted with in Liverpool, who has or had a kind of chance to take a course thro&#x2019; Yorkshire and return shortly by Carlisle: him, in my hoping moments, it sometimes seems possible that I could intercept with a gig at Penrith, and lead round by Hallsteads along Ulleswater to Greta Bank in a pleasant manner for a few days.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Penrith, a town in Cumberland, 16 mi.

<salute>Dear Robertson,</salute>
<p>There is no doubt whatever that I once read Mr Buchan&#x2019;s former volume or volumes of Scotch Ballads; but the impression they have left with me is to the last degree dim! Some reminiscence of innocent old doggrel,&#x2014;which, alas, I have a suspicion, seemed to be eked out with <hi rend="italic">new:</hi> this, in a faint, vague, half-distracted condition, is all I can fish out of memory&#x2019;s depths on that subject. Clear only, or in some degree clear, is the Portrait opposite the Frontispiece: a lean-visaged, crane-necked, scraggy-bearded human figure, with an air of enthusiasm, <pb id="pg-17-28" n="17:28"/>simplicity, distraction and ill luck, subscribed &#x201C;Peter Buchan&#x201D;;&#x2014;as if appealing to all benevolent mortals: &#x201C;I Peter Buchan am actually extant here; <hi rend="italic">can</hi> any of you tell me why?&#x201D;</p>
<p>Under these circumstances I will certainly subscribe to Peter&#x2019;s new Book, and wish him all sale and success with it, poor fellow; but to recommend it, or sanction it in any other way, is beyond my commission.&#x2014; Pray tell him what is agreeable about this, carefully in your benevolence <hi rend="italic">suppressing</hi> the rest; and do the best you can for the poor man.</p>
<p>I have been wandering in Wales, South and North amid Rebecca-riots, rain-tempests, multiplied confusions; and am right glad to have got to rest here for a few days. Next month perhaps I may hope to see you again in Babylon.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >London.</note></p>

<salute>Dear Goody Coadjutor,</salute>
<p>There is a bright Day come out of Heaven this time; and all lies green and azure, bright as sapphire and emeralds, a real enlightenment to the soul of man! I have written various of my Letters, to Robertson among others; and begun to <hi rend="italic">stir</hi> among my rubbish again, and feel some slight determination to have it put in order if I can.</p>
<p>No Letter from thee last night, thou Graceless! Well, I did not deserve any. I scribble as usual; the rather as, if tomorrow prove bright, I shall be off to Dumfries, and there will be a gap for once; who knows if not a gap for <hi rend="italic">two</hi> days running. I have various confused things to settle and manage at Dumfries, and there is small convenience for writing there. Last night instead of a Letter from Goody, there arrived, unpaid, this horrid mass of vocables from W. Grahame, which now for thy sins I doom thee also to read:&#x2014;no, I will not; I will retain the document for pipe-matches, remembering what the infirmity of female human nature is! Poor Grahame is in the worst of situations, and seemingly quite broken down in spirits: poor fellow; yet with an insatiable appetite for human converse, such is still his noble trust in his brethren of the sons of men. A true nobleness of mind; yet to me a dreadfully wearisome one at present. Jamie and I had decided that we were to <pb id="pg-17-29" n="17:29"/>walk up to him this evening, seeing the weather dry: but since that, the Austins, Mary, Jamie and two children have arrived; there will be no adventure of that kind for tonight. I will have a long drive in the Gig with my Mother,&#x2014;my poor old Mother is not at all well: a sight of God&#x2019;s green world, capped once more with its dome of eternal Blue, will be useful to us both. Poor body, she has reconciled herself to Alick&#x2019;s waygoing; the hearts of all good men reconcile themselves soon to the irrevocable, inevitable. Some of Jamie&#x2019;s details about the matter are very striking to me. Jenny, on stepping into the hackney-coach that was to take them down to the ship, <hi rend="italic">broke thro&#x2019; the bottom of it;</hi> the old wreck was fated to ruin under her! Little Jane looked extremely agitated; kept her eyes &#x201C;fixed on me&#x201D; (says Jamie), so long as she was in sight. Tom, on the other hand, who has wonderfully developed himself last year, and promises to be a &#x201C;clever boy,&#x201D; lay down on his side and elbow on a box on deck, and looked unconcerned about him.
Alick was firm as iron;&#x2014;poor toil-worn, heavyladen, embroiled bewildered Brother, may God be guide to thee!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alexander Carlyle wrote to his mother from Alton, N.Y., <date when="1843-08-10">10 Aug.</date>: &#x201C;I regretted exceedingly that Jamie had taken so much trouble upon him to so little purpose. Our short stay [in Liverpool] after his arrival; the large concourse of idle people gazing heedlessly on our departure; the wild &#x2018;Ye-ho,&#x2019; cursing, blaspheming, and indescribable tumult of the sailors (and all this on the Sabbath morning), filled me with a feeling of sadness I had never felt before. It seemed also as if Jamie, whom I still recognized by his Scotch plaid, long after he had lost sight of me, was the last honest person I should perhaps ever again meet in this Earth,&#x2014;so much disgusted did I feel with the villany I had met with in Liverpool&#x201D; (Marrs 574).</note>&#x2014;</p>
<p>In one of the Newspapers you sent last night is a long address of George Rennie&#x2019;s to Scotch Farmers, inciting them to emigrate with him to &#x201C;New Edinburgh.&#x201D; The Address is well enough, not too well; the adventure, under such auspices, seemed to me a little questionable! May it prove otherwise. Poor Rennie too, driven hither and thither by <hi rend="italic">demons</hi>, of ambition, impatience and such like, is not without deservings, and has suffered much. One wishes he also could &#x201C;find his work and do it.&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-06/lt-18320216-TC-JAC-01"><sic>6:122</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1832-02-16">16 Feb. 1832</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-06/lt-18320522-TC-JAC-01"><sic>158</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1832-05-22">22 May 1832</date></corr></ref>.</note> The danger is, his violent egoistic <hi rend="italic">temper</hi>; that government of his will require a &#x201C;heroic patience,&#x201D; I think, at the basis of all: true insight, or any heroic thing, is not to be had otherwise.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Rennie had first put forward plans for a new colony in the South Island of New Zealand in a letter to the directors of the New Zealand Co.

His original intention was to send a preliminary expedition of civil engineers, surveyors, and laborers to set up a town before the main body of colonists arrived. This was obviously the scheme JWC knew about in <date when="1842-08-00">Aug. 1842</date> when seeking work for her cousin John Welsh and about which she became annoyed when Rennie&#x2019;s optimism misled her into thinking the plan imminent (see <ref target="volume-15/lt-18420820-JWC-MW-01"><sic>15:37</sic><corr>JWC to MW, <date when="1842-08-20">20 Aug. 1842</date></corr></ref>).

<p>Here I actually am&#x2014;and so far as has yet appeared, &#x201C;if it had not been for the honour of the thing&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech, origin unknown; cf. <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370829-JWC-TC-01"><sic>9:300</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1837-08-29">29 Aug. 1837</date></corr></ref>.</note> I had better have staid where I was&#x2014; The journey hither was not <hi rend="italic">pleasant</hi> the least in the world, what <hi rend="italic">journey</hi> ever was or shall be pleasant for poor me?&#x2014; But <hi rend="italic">this</hi> railway seems to me particularly <hi rend="italic">shaky</hi>, and then the steamboating from Gosport, <note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Town in Hampshire, W of Portsmouth harbor.</note> tho it had not time to make me <hi rend="italic">sick;</hi>&#x2014;the water moreover being smooth as the Thames&#x2014;still it made me as perfectly <hi rend="italic">uncomfortable</hi> as need be&#x2014;a heavy dew was falling&#x2014;one could not see many yards ahead&#x2014;every body on board looked peevish&#x2014; I wished myself at home in my bed&#x2014;</p>
<p>We reached Ryde at eight in the evening&#x2014;and the second Hotel being filled, had to take up our quarters for that night at the first&#x2014;which &#x201C;is the <hi rend="italic">dearest</hi> Hotel in Europe&#x201D;&#x2014;and the Hotel in Europe so far as I have seen, where there is least human comfort&#x2014; I had to make tea from an urn the water of which was certainly <hi rend="italic">not</hi> &#x201C;as hot as one could drink it&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Lady mistress and guests have sat down to tea; butler is summoned up in haste: &#x2018;John, John, how is this?

Of course fevered and nervous as I was at any <pb id="pg-17-32" n="17:32"/>rate from the journey&#x2014;I could not sleep at all&#x2014; I do not mean that I <hi rend="italic">slept ill</hi> but I have absolutely <hi rend="italic">never been asleep at all the whole night!</hi> so you may fancy the favourable mood I am in towards Ryde this morning!

I sent for her over last Sunday that the Sisters might have a day in comfort together before Juliets departure for Manchester.&#x2014; And now I am about sending <hi rend="italic">her</hi> to Manchester also!&#x2014; Actually I have the offer of a place for her which <hi rend="italic">sounds</hi> very nice indeed&#x2014; She accepted with a face all red with joy&#x2014;and my first work on returning must be to get <hi rend="italic">her</hi> equipped with a decent little wardrobe like her Sisters&#x2014;which will consume another third part of the money&#x2014;and then there will remain another third to put the child out to board&#x2014;if Mrs Mudie herself can find a situation and she says she wishes to do. I cannot tell you how glad I am at getting <hi rend="italic">both</hi> these girls placed&#x2014;and out of London, away from the Mother, who if near would have been continually taking their cloathes to pawn&#x2014;and beside one another in the same sort of services&#x2014; I really regard it as the saving of them both&#x2014;they <hi rend="italic">must</hi> have gone to the streets before much longer&#x2014;on the Sunday when Elizabeth came to me at one clock she told her sister they had nothing to eat at home all that day!&#x2014; I took Juliet myself to the Railway&#x2014;and committed her to the care of a decent looking man and his wife&#x2014;she was to take a cab and go straight to Geraldine&#x2019;s&#x2014;she looked very composed and strong-hearted&#x2014; I augur well of her. She has very little to say for herself&#x2014;but her watchful <hi rend="italic">waiting upon me</hi>&#x2014;always flying to answer my bell&#x2014;to open the door&#x2014;to do every thing like a servant while she staid&#x2014;proved that she had cast all pride out of her heart, and felt a wish to please me&#x2014;</p>
<p><pb id="pg-17-33" n="17:33"/>The other is equally <hi rend="italic">willing</hi> and has I think as much capacity for service&#x2014; But I dare say I weary you with my eternal Mudies&#x2014; It is so little good one ever succeeds in doing &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">here down</hi>&#x201D;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech.

<p>And now let me tell you something which you will perhaps think more <hi rend="italic">questionable</hi> than the placing of the Mudie girls&#x2014;a little piece of <hi rend="italic">Hero-worship</hi> that I have been after&#x2014; &#x201C;My &#x201C;youthful enthusiasm&#x201D; as John Sterling calls it is not extinct there, as I had supposed&#x2014;but must certainly be <hi rend="italic">immortal!</hi> Only think of its blazing up for&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">Father Mathew!</hi>&#x2014; You know I have always had the greatest reverence for that Priest&#x2014;and when I heard he was in London&#x2014; &#x2014;attainable to me, I felt that I <hi rend="italic">must</hi> see him&#x2014;shake him by the hand&#x2014;and tell him I loved him considerably!&#x2014; I was expressing my wish to see him to Robertson the night he brought the Ballad collector<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;&#x2018;Peter Buchan,&#x2019; poor Phantasm (must be something <hi rend="italic">lost?</hi> / n.b.&#x2014;<supplied>[two or three words-illegible]</supplied>&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note).</note>&#x2014;and he told me it could be gratified&#x2014;quite easily&#x2014; Mrs Hall had offered <hi rend="italic">him</hi> a note of introduction to Father Mathew, and she would be pleased to include my name in it&#x2014;&#x201C;fix my time then&#x201D;&#x2014;he was administering the pledge all day long in the Commercial Road&#x2014;

To be sure Ryde is a place well worth <hi rend="italic">having seen</hi>&#x2014;and knowing about with a view to future needs but what I get out of it for the time being&#x2014;<foreign><hi rend="italic">moi</hi></foreign> [I]&#x2014;is sleeplessness indigestion and incipient despair. I finished my last letter to you the first thing I did on taking possession of the lodging&#x2014;it (the lodging) looked passable enough so far&#x2014;a small but neat sitting room&#x2014;with two bedrooms of which the roomiest was assigned to <hi rend="italic">me</hi>&#x2014;plainly in the <hi rend="italic">expectation</hi> that I should modestly prefer the inferior one&#x2014; But not at all&#x2014;my modesty remained perfectly passive&#x2014;for I knew that he could have had the bedrooms equally good for two or three shillings a week more&#x2014;and if <pb id="pg-17-36" n="17:36"/>he chose to make a sacrifice of comfort for so paltry a saving, I was resolved it should be of his <hi rend="italic">own</hi> comfort, not <hi rend="italic">mine</hi>&#x2014; Having ended my letter and one to Helen at Chelsea&#x2014;I went out alone to look at the town while Sterling was buying twopenny worths of all sorts of groceries &#x26;c &#x26;c in the shops&#x2014;tho Clark is with us and could have saved him that trouble&#x2014; In the course of my walk I went into a confectioners and had an ice (!) and bought a bag of biscuits to bring home, against the probability of being starved! Nothing makes one so deadly selfish and taken up about owns<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> own accommodation as the neighbouring of selfishness&#x2014;</p>
<p>On my return I found John and Teddy arrived<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Sterling and his son Edward (b. <date when="1831-00-00">1831</date>), &#x201C;John&#x2019;s older boy&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note).</note>&#x2014;and dinner awaiting&#x2014;mutton broth (at my particular request) which the Stimabile had to help with an old coffee cup!&#x2014;soup-ladles being apparently unknown in this locality&#x2014; I walked again in the evening with John while his Father took Teddy a-boating&#x2014;the Maurices were to arrive next day&#x2014;he had to return that night and would not be able to come again&#x2014; He offered me every so many German books to read&#x2014;as if one could read any thing here!</p>
<p>I went to bed in fear and trembling&#x2014;I do think another such night as the preceding would have thrown me into a brain fever&#x2014;but I slept&#x2014;mercifully&#x2014;not well&#x2014;but <hi rend="italic">some</hi>&#x2014; On looking however at my fair hand in the morning, as it lay outside the bedclothes I perceived it to be all&#x2014;&#x201C;what shall I say&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;elevated into inequalities<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Euphemism of a cert<hi rend="italic">n</hi> rustic goose (in our Craigh time) to express the condition of his brow bitten by midges. The preced<hi rend="italic">g</hi> locut<hi rend="italic">n</hi> is established Mazzinian; the following clearly mine&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note).</note>&#x2014;&#x201C;significant of much&#x201D;!&#x2014; Not a doubt of it I had fallen among bugs!&#x2014;my pretty neck too especially that part of it Babbie used to like to kiss was all bitten infamously&#x2014;and I felt myself a <hi rend="italic">degraded</hi> goody as well as a very unfortunate one&#x2014; As I sat exceedingly low at something which in the language of flattery we called breakfast&#x2014;Clark brought me your letter and one from Babbie and <hi rend="italic">three</hi> from Geraldine who always outdoes you all! administering comfort each after a sort&#x2014;but Geraldines most&#x2014;for they afforded me the handsomest pretext for returning home suddenly&#x2014; One of her letters was to announce the safe arrival of Juliet Mudie whom she expressed herself outrageously pleased with&#x2014;the other <hi rend="italic">two</hi> were to say that I must get Elizabeth off immediately as the Lady could not wait&#x2014;and in case of missing me she had written to this effect to Chelsea and Ryde at the same time&#x2014; &#x2014;I was not to mind clothing her&#x2014;all <hi rend="italic">that</hi> could be done there&#x2014;if I was absent I must employ Mazzini <pb id="pg-17-37" n="17:37"/>or somebody to see her off&#x2014; &#x2014; But I was too glad of the excuse to dream of <hi rend="italic">employing</hi> any body&#x2014;besides one always does ones own business best oneself&#x2014;should she miss the thing thro any interference from the Mother or other hindrance which my presence could have obviated who knows but it might be the losing of her whole chances in life!&#x2014; So I wrote to her instantly to go home and take leave of her Mother on receiving my letter (today) and make one or two small preparations which were <hi rend="italic">indispensable</hi>&#x2014;unless she should go among strangers like a beggar which of course poor thing, being very handsome or whether or no, she would not like to do&#x2014;and that I would be there tomorrow to take her to the railway tomorrow evening&#x2014; Meanwhile I am getting together <hi rend="italic">one</hi> decent suit of clothes for her here in the Isle of Wight! that is what I call taking time <hi rend="italic">by the middle!</hi></p>
<p>Today I have another letter from you as a sort of marmlade to ones bad bread and tea urn&#x2014;skimed milk-tea! Do you know I <hi rend="italic">pity</hi> this poor old man in his meanness&#x2014;the notion of <hi rend="italic">saving</hi> seems to be growing into a <hi rend="italic">disease</hi> with him&#x2014;and he has still a sufficient natural sense of what <hi rend="italic">looks</hi> generous and even magnificient to make it a very <hi rend="italic">painful</hi> disease&#x2014;he is really pitiable in every way&#x2014;and if it were <hi rend="italic">possible</hi> for me to stay with him; I would out of sheer <hi rend="italic">charity</hi>&#x2014; Neither of his children care rigmaree for him&#x2014;and he knows it&#x2014;nobody <hi rend="italic">does</hi> care rigmaree for him&#x2014;he is incapable of applying his mind to reading or writing or any one earthly thing&#x2014; And he cannot move about &#x201C;to <hi rend="italic">distract</hi> himself&#x201D; as he used to do&#x2014;he suffers so much from incessant pain in one of his thighs&#x2014; He cannot even talk for every minute needing to roar out&#x2014;&#x201C;this is <hi rend="italic">torture</hi> by Jove&#x201D;! &#x201C;My God this is agony &#x26;c &#x26;c&#x201D;&#x2014; He always <hi rend="italic">will</hi> go out to <hi rend="italic">walk</hi>&#x2014;and then for hours after he pays the penalty of it&#x2014; But enough of him poor old fellow&#x2014;it is a mercy he has Clark who is a really judicious well conducted servant.</p>
<p>I went this morning (while a man was taking down my bedstead to look for the bugs which were <hi rend="italic">worse</hi> last night of course having found what a rare creature they had got to eat) and investigated another lodging which Clark had taken for <hi rend="italic">us</hi> and Sterling gave it up for no other reason one could imagine than just because <hi rend="italic">Clark</hi> had taken it&#x2014;and he likes to do every thing over again himself&#x2014; I thought it would be good to know something about lodgings here in case you might like to try <hi rend="italic">it</hi> next time&#x2014; Ryde is certainly far the most beautiful seabathing place <hi rend="italic">I</hi> ever saw&#x2014;and seems to combine the conveniences and civilization of town with the <hi rend="italic">purity</hi> and quiet of the country in a rather successful manner&#x2014; The lodging I looked at was quite at the outside of the town&#x2014;a sitting room and two bedrooms in the house of a single Lady&#x2014;the sitting room beautiful the bedrooms small but in compensation <pb id="pg-17-38" n="17:38"/>the <hi rend="italic">beds</hi> very large&#x2014;good furniture&#x2014;and I should expect good attendance&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">&#x201C;sitting&#x201D;</hi> in a beautiful little garden&#x2014;villa-wise&#x2014;rejoicing in the characteristic name of <hi rend="italic">Flora Cottage</hi>&#x2014;and within two minutes walk of the sea and romantic looking bushy expanses&#x2014;a very superior affair to Newby<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On Solway Firth, nr.

<salute>Dearest,</salute>
<p>The Post was missed yesterday; and if I do not take heed it will be omitted till too late today again. I had not heard a word from you for three days when I left Scotsbrig: I hope there is something lying there for me! This is the worst of conven<supplied>[ien]</supplied>cies<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letters omitted.</note> for writing; but to save poor Goody from anxiety I must endeavour to jot down a word.</p>
<p>We got hither thro&#x2019; beautiful weather which still holds up tho&#x2019; not without misgivings, on Thursday afternoon. Yesterday I managed all my affairs, saw Adamson &#x26;c; today we go home again by Gill. I had some thoughts of going up to Craigenputtoch, poor old Puttoch, today, and not going home till tommorow; but my Mother thinks it would do her mischief to attend me, and my own heart <foreign><hi rend="italic">scunners</hi></foreign> [feels disgust] <pb id="pg-17-39" n="17:39"/>at the idea: I will not go today; but I will try it yet some other day before quitting this region; for it seems to be a kind of duty I have got to do, and one ought in that case to do it.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC had last visited Craigenputtoch in spring <date when="1842-00-00">1842</date>; see <ref target="volume-14/lt-18420321-TC-JWC-01"><sic>14:77&#x2013;80</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1842-03-21">21 March 1842</date></corr></ref>.</note></p>
<p>Jean has the beautifullest little secluded cottage here shut out by a wall and briar-hedges from the street and all contiguous houses, looking out altogether pleasantly upon the river, town-mill wheels, observatory and green knolls and trees,&#x2014;but, as Jack says, &#x201C;she has involved herself in a terrible mess with children&#x201D;;&#x2014;she has all things prettily furnished, but confusion as before cannot be kept from encroaching! I have had a quiet bed, but could not sleep well these two nights. All is bustle here, getting things ready for departure &#x26;c: I have not a particle of composure to tell you what I am about. I shall have more time by and by.</p>
<p>I saw the M&#x2019;Diarmids yesterday; the dame of the house not with any pleasure! She is grown fat and old, and more drawly and conceited, and distasteful to me, or I less tolerant of the like, than ever.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Anne M&#x2019;Diarmid; see <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380927-TC-JWC-01"><sic>10:189</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1838-09-27">27 Sept. 1838</date></corr></ref>.</note> A tragedy was transacting itself in this town: a tailor some ten years ago married a pretty servant-girl from Dorsetshire whom he found here; they took to drinking, successively or simultaneously, or had from of old been drinkers; wreck, ruin, rage and total desperation in the usual forms ensued; Last week the woman walked out with two of her children, tied them to her by a shawl, and jumped into the water: yesterday was the funeral; &#x201C;many women weeping at the doors,&#x201D; the town in much emotion, but no &#x201C;riot,&#x201D; as Mac was clear there would be, against the surviving unfortunate. Whisky is really worth celebrating at present!</p>
<p>With an effort, in memory of those not now here, I decided on calling for Mrs Mundell.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Widow of Robert Mundell, rector of Wallace Hall School, Closeburn (see <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390805-TC-TA-01"><sic>11:164</sic><corr>TC to TA, <date when="1839-08-05">5 Aug. 1839</date></corr></ref>), who had d. <date when="1842-05-05">5 May 1842</date>.</note> She received me in her new smart house in Buccleuch Street, in her widow weeds, with the old snappish alacrity, and I sat a few civil minutes, till certain frightful M&#x2019;Murdo old redfaced woman came waddling in,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> whereupon I took my leave. All is adjusted in that establishment again; so soon grass fills up all furrows, and they that survive must still live! I looked at this poor Mrs Mundell with an interest better people would not have awakened.</p>
<p>Did anybody tell you poor Roger Kirkpatrick was dead? It happened last spring, he had &#x201C;made money&#x201D; anew: his widow lives in one <pb id="pg-17-40" n="17:40"/>of the houses that overlook this one.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably one of the Kirkpatrick family of Closeburn, Dumfriesshire; see <ref target="volume-01/lt-18201014-JBW-EA-01"><sic>1:280</sic><corr>JBW to EA, <date when="1820-10-14">14 Oct. 1820</date></corr></ref>.

<p>My chief company has been Gilfillan the Hades Minister, and friendly critic, escorted by Aird.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Gilfillan (<date when="1813-00-00">1813</date>&#x2013;<date when="1878-00-00">78</date>; <ref target="volume-17/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/10725"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), author and minister of a Burgher Church, Dundee, who had pbd. his sermon of <date when="1842-10-02">2 Oct. 1842</date>, <hi rend="italic">Hades, or the Unseen</hi> (Dundee, <date when="1843-00-00">1843</date>), and who had written about <hi rend="italic">The French Revolution</hi>; see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18401029-TC-JAC-01"><sic>12:306</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1840-10-29">29 Oct. 1840</date></corr></ref>. Thomas Aird.</note> They have walked me about both evenings, had tea here,&#x2014;in short got far more talk out of me than was good. Gilfillan looks somewhat like a &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">saft tatie</hi></foreign>&#x201D; [simpleton]; but is, one ultimately finds, a really good youth, with what I should call a <hi rend="italic">frightful</hi> future before him. He <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> swallow <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, and continue a burgher minister! Yesternight I noticed him sighing deeply. I rather think he is married too.<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >To Margaret, b.

<salute>Dearest</salute>
<p>I have not for a long time enjoyed a more triumphant moment than in &#x201C;descending&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;&#x2018;Scende da Carossa,&#x2019; said Degli Antoni once describing Pepoli&#x2019;s idly discursive ways&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note). An earlier note is more explanatory: &#x201C;describing the erratic Town life of a brill<hi rend="italic">t</hi> acquaintance here&#x201D; (see <ref target="volume-15/lt-18420814-JWC-TC-01"><sic>15:14</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1842-08-14">14 Aug. 1842</date></corr></ref>).</note> from the railway yesterday at Vauxhall, and calling a <pb id="pg-17-41" n="17:41"/>porter to carry my small trunk and <hi rend="small-caps">dressing box</hi>, (of course!) to a Chelsea steamer! To be sure I looked&#x2014;(and <hi rend="italic">felt</hi>) &#x201C;as if just returning from the thirty years war&#x201D;&#x2014; Sleepless, bug-bitten, bedusted and be-devilled I was hardly recognisable for the same trim little goody who had left that spot only four days before, but still, I was returning <hi rend="italic">with</hi> my shield&#x2014;not <hi rend="italic">on</hi> it&#x2014;a few minutes more and I should be purified to the shift&#x2014;to the very skin&#x2014;should have absolutely <hi rend="italic">bathed</hi> myself with <foreign><hi rend="italic">eau de Cologne</hi></foreign>&#x2014;should have some mutton broth set before me (I had written from Ryde to bespeak it!) and <hi rend="italic">a silver spoon</hi> to eat it with&#x2014;(these four days had taught me to <hi rend="italic">appreciate</hi> my luxuries) and then the prospect of my own red bed at night&#x2014;! <hi rend="italic">that</hi> of itself was enough to make me the most thankful woman in Chelsea!&#x2014; Helen screamed with joy when she saw me (for I was come about an hour sooner than I was expected) and then seized me round the neck and kissed me from ear to ear&#x2014;then came Bessey Mudie&#x2014;with her head quite turned&#x2014;she could do nothing in the world but <hi rend="italic">laugh</hi> for joy&#x2014;over her own prospects so suddenly brightened for her&#x2014;and from consciousness of her improved appearance in a pair of stays and a gown and petticoat which she had got for herself here by my directions&#x2014; And when I showed her the <hi rend="italic">shawl</hi> and other little things I had fetched her from Ryde she laughed still more and her face grew so very red that I thought she was going to burst a bloodvessel&#x2014; She had been home and had taken leave of her Mother who offered no hindrance whatever but was extremely thankful.
So all was in readiness for taking her to the railway that evening according to programme. Mazzini called just when I had finished my dinner, to inquire if there had been any news from me, and was astonished to find <hi rend="italic">myself</hi>&#x2014;still more astonished at the extent to which I had managed to <hi rend="italic">ruin</hi> myself in so short a time&#x2014;I looked he said, &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">strange</hi>&#x2014;upon <hi rend="italic">my</hi> honour!&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">most like</hi>&#x2014;if he might be allowed to say it&#x2014;to Lady Macbeth in the sleeping scene!&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Macbeth</hi> 5.1.</note>&#x2014; No wonder! four such nights might have maid a somnambulist of a much stronger woman than me&#x2014;<foreign><hi rend="italic">poverina</hi></foreign> [poor thing]&#x2014;</p>
<p>At half after seven I started with Bessy for Euston square committed her to the care of a very fat benevolent looking old man who was going all the way<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >To Manchester.</note>&#x2014;pinned her letter for Geraldine to her stays&#x2014;kissed the poor young creature and gave her my blessing&#x2014;came back <pb id="pg-17-42" n="17:42"/>wondering whether these two girls that I had launched into the world would live to thank me for it, or not rather to wish that I had tied a stone about each of their necks and launched them in the Thames!&#x2014; Impossible to predict!&#x2014; So I had a tumbler of brandy punch (there was still some in your last bottle) and thus fortified went to bed and was asleep in two minutes! After some hours of the <hi rend="italic">deadest</hi> sleep I ever slept on earth I was wakened with pain in my head&#x2014;but where I <hi rend="italic">was</hi> I could not possibly make out&#x2014; I sat up in the middle of my bed&#x2014;to ascertain my locality&#x2014;and there &#x201C;I happened&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Maid at Ampton [where they had lodged; see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18320616-JWC-EMI-01"><sic>6:172</sic><corr>JWC to EMI, <date when="1832-06-16">16 June 1832</date></corr></ref>]: &#x201C;This morn<hi rend="italic">g</hi> m&#x2019;em I&#x2019;ve &#x2019;appened a misfortune, m&#x2019;em&#x2019; (viz. broken something)&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note).</note> the oddest mystification you can fancy&#x2014;I actually <hi rend="italic">lost myself in my bed!</hi>&#x2014;could not find the right way of lying down again!&#x2014; I felt all about for pillows&#x2014;none were findable! and I could not get the clothes spread up on me again!&#x2014;they seemed to be <hi rend="italic">fixed</hi> down&#x2014; At last still groping with my hand I felt <hi rend="italic">the foot board</hi> at my head! I had lain down &#x201C;with my head where my feet should be&#x201D;&#x2014;and it was a puzzling business to rectify my position! I went to sleep again and rose at half after eight and eat my coffee and good bread with such relish! Oh it was worth while to have spent four days in pretentious parsimony&#x2014;to have been bitten with bugs&#x2014;to have been irritated with fuss and humbug&#x2014;and last of all to have been <hi rend="italic">done</hi> out of my travelling expences back!&#x2014;it was worth while to have had all this botheration to refresh my sense of all my mercies&#x2014;every thing is comparative &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">here down</hi>&#x201D;&#x2014;this morning I need no other paradise than what I have&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">cleanness</hi>&#x2014;(<hi rend="italic">not</hi> of teeth) modest comfort&#x2014;silence&#x2014;independence&#x2014;that is to say dependence on no other but one&#x2019;s own husband&#x2014;yes&#x2014;I need to be well of my headach over &#x26; above&#x2014;but that also will come with more sleep&#x2014;</p>
<p>I found on my return three book-parcels and your last letter parcel first John Sterlings <hi rend="italic">Strafford</hi> for myself&#x2014;you will see a review of it in todays Examiner which will make him desperately angry<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The review of John Sterling&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Strafford: A Tragedy</hi> (<date when="1843-00-00">1843</date>) in the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, <date when="1843-08-12">12 Aug.</date>, criticized its failure to face the truth boldly: &#x201C;Details are laid hold of and highly wrought; some insulated matters are given with power and masterly completeness; but of the thorough concentrated meaning of the matter, we see comparatively little. It is not that the writer fails to take a <hi rend="italic">side</hi>, but that on both sides we want distinctness and strength of purpose.&#x201D; Sterling&#x2019;s freedom with history was &#x201C;hardly to be justified.&#x201D; But, in conclusion, &#x201C;all objections made, what fine writing this tragedy contains! Enough, most assuredly, to have established Mr Sterling&#x2019;s claim to poetical genius, if that were still to do.&#x201D; For TC&#x2019;s views when he read it in MS, see <ref target="volume-14/lt-18420120-TC-JOST-01"><sic>14:20&#x2013;21</sic><corr>TC to JOST, <date when="1842-01-20">20 Jan. 1842</date></corr></ref>. John Stuart Mill wrote, [<date when="1843-08-11">11?

<salute>Dearest,</salute>
<p>There are still a few minutes left for me of the idlest of sick (<hi rend="italic">medicinal</hi>) days to write thee a few words in: the Tailor is to carry them over to Ecclefechan, whence if steam and Post prove true they will depart tomorrow morning, and reach Chelsea on Wednesday. It is of importance to keep a poor Goody just returned from Ryde and bug-biting from being <hi rend="italic">vaixed</hi>. You would get a Letter this day? I put one into the Post-Office at Ecclefechan with that view: it was all crumpled by lugging along in my pocket, having been written at Dumfries. By the same occasion, in reward of my virtue, I got your first Letter from Ryde: it lay there with one from Spedding, which I now send, and with another from Robertson on the Peter-Buchan business too insignificant for sending.</p>
<p>Thanks to thee dear Goody for such diligent writing. The two Letter<supplied>[s]</supplied>,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> of which I read great part to the hearth-circle here gave universal satisfaction, excited universal admiration&#x2014;&#x201C;she <hi rend="italic">is</hi> a hand!&#x201D; &#x26;c &#x26;c. Even the Father Mathew exploit was approved of; my Mother declared that &#x201C;she could have done the same.&#x201D; On the whole, however, does it not seem wonderful now in sober hours? On the whole ought I not to &#x201C;beat&#x201D; so foolish a Goody when I get back to her? I will think about it; and perhaps do it. Who knows but it may be useful to her! Father Mathew is a kind of hero, tho&#x2019; a very simple one: the scene of his labour in Liverpool affected me to the neighbourhood of tears, to the lifting of my hat and saying of &#x201C;So be it.&#x201D; It is a God that inspires such men.

<p><pb id="pg-17-46" n="17:46"/>Much sadder is the Ryde business. Thou poor sleepless one! And then the bugs, the blue milk, the vainglorious beggarliness! It was a real relief to me to figure thee in our own clean house at Chelsea again; free at least from all that. Thanks too for looking at the lodgings: some day we will go ourselves, and have a temporary household of our own there. At Beaumaris<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In Anglesey, N Wales.</note> I also looked at lodgings: the price seems to have been much the same as Ryde; the situation also was delightful, and furnished with all conveniences for civilized living.

<p>Three Tailors sit below stairs working for me; and I have <hi rend="italic">castor</hi> in me for a petty kind of feverish cold: such has been the equipment of existence provided for <hi rend="italic">this</hi> day.

Tomorrow is Lockerby Fair, and all the world is in attendance, even Garthwaite my Tailor and his 2/9 of men are off. I read, in the extremest state of laziness attainable by man, a most simple, foolish but yet excellent Book by a Missionary Williams, about the South-Sea Islands, where he long laboured and at last perished: a Book almost equal to Robinson Crusoe become a <hi rend="italic">fact</hi>.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Williams (<date when="1796-00-00">1796</date>&#x2014;<date when="1839-00-00">1839</date>), English missionary, left London for missionary work in the Polynesian archipelago, SW Pacific Ocean, <date when="1816-00-00">1816</date>, learned the language of the Society Islands, trans. the New Testament into Rarotongan, was murdered and eaten by the natives of the New Hebrides; wrote <hi rend="italic">A Narrative of Missionary Enterprises in the South Sea Islands</hi> (<date when="1837-00-00">1837</date>).</note> The time flows on gently as Dutch canals; surely I shall be rested, the petty feverish cold once gone.

<salute>Dear darling of a Babbie!</salute>
<p>Your letter followed me to the Isle of Wight and reached me there on Thursday last&#x2014;and good faith; it was one of the few glad sights I had in my travels. Oh Babbie!&#x2014;what distraction for a sky-rocket &#x201C;to go out for to see the world in the same box with a red-hot poker!&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edward Sterling.</note>&#x2014; The result needed no witch to foretell it, what else <hi rend="italic">could</hi> it be but that the sky-rocket would fly off&#x2014;and leave the red-hot poker to burn a hole in the box at its leisure?</p>
<p>But let me try to be a little circumstantial&#x2014;my head indeed has had itself so unmercifully jumbled that it is not easy to rise above <hi rend="italic">the Chaotic</hi> this evening&#x2014;however I will try&#x2014; Know then that I left this house last Tuesday&#x2014;with a very small trunk and my &#x201C;eternal dressing-box&#x201D; (as Carlyle used to call it in our last journey) along with old Sterling&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">in a street-cab</hi>&#x2014;Clark his man-servant&#x2014;the only sane element of that household&#x2014;being seated on the front&#x2014; (From the commencement you will observe <hi rend="italic">a strict regard to economy</hi> as characterising our movements) I felt a little &#x201C;scandalized&#x201D; at the beggarly turn out&#x2014;however&#x2014;the cab deposited us at the steamboat&#x2014;the steamboat at the Vauxhall railway<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >They went by steamer from Chelsea to Vauxhall, where, at the Nine Elms Terminus, they joined the London &#x26; Southampton Railway to Gosport.</note>&#x2014;where there was as much <hi rend="italic">demonstration</hi> about the buying of the tickets as if they had been to carry one into the Kingdom of Heaven&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; I felt rather inclined to turn back then and there&#x2014;and I wish to God that I had&#x2014;after a wearisome journey of four hours we found ourselves in another steamboat&#x2014;under a heavy dew&#x2014;and half an hour&#x2019;s sailing landed us at Wight without our having been able to see thro the fog a yard before our noses&#x2014;</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">The</hi> <hi rend="small-caps">second-rate</hi> <hi rend="italic">Hotel being filled</hi>&#x2014;we were under the necessity of putting up for the night at the first rate&#x2014;which Sterling told me often enough was &#x201C;the dearest Hotel in Europe&#x201D;&#x2014;also he might have said the most uncomfortable in Europe&#x2014;dinner tea and supper were combined for us &#x201C;in their simplest expression&#x201D;&#x2014;tea made from a luke warm tea urn&#x2014;butter tasting of straw&#x2014;stale bread&#x2014;and a fowl which the Waiter told us with triumph was &#x201C;hardly cold&#x201D;&#x2014;formed our sad repast&#x2014;after which having nothing to do but sound the depths of vacuum I retired to bed&#x2014; &#x201C;Bow wow wow&#x201D; cried a great dog just under my open window&#x2014;and a whole world of dogs in the distance answered fiercely <pb id="pg-17-48" n="17:48"/>&#x201C;bow wow wow&#x201D;&#x2014;and this intercourse between the near dog and the far off ones was kept up without five minutes intermission throughout the whole night!&#x2014; Of course I rose as I had lain down without one wink of sleep&#x2014;in what a state to bear with old Sterling and the cold tea-urn you may figure! In the course of the forenoon we were transfered to &#x201C;a quiet lodging&#x201D; that is to say a very <hi rend="italic">shabby</hi> one where you may take for symbol <hi rend="italic">an old coffee-cup</hi> presented at dinner to help the mutton-broth!&#x2014;and the morning and the evening were the second day<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Gen. 1:8.</note>&#x2014;and again I went to bed&#x2014; I slept a little while&#x2014;feverishly&#x2014;then I awoke and tossed and tumbled about rather madly till day light&#x2014; Then may eyes resting by chance on my lilly&#x2014;hand I perceived&#x2014;Oh Babbie&#x2014;innumerable red-spots&#x2014;&#x201C;significative of much&#x201D; &#x2014;I rose and looked in the glass and one cheek and one side of my poor little neck was also covered with red spots. I put on my clothes and read the Vicar of Wakefield&#x2014; But why be so minute?&#x2014;enough to say that my discomfort, and indignation increased with every hour&#x2014;and a letter or rather <hi rend="italic">three</hi> letters from Geraldine received all at once, demanding the second Mudie to be sent off <hi rend="italic">immediately</hi>, affording me a decent pretext for hurrying home, I told my fellow traveller that if he chose to stay longer in such a mess, I should go up to London by myself, on Saturday morning&#x2014; He prefered staying I verily believe to <hi rend="italic">save</hi> my expenses back&#x2014;for he has fallen into an absolute <hi rend="italic">disease</hi> of parsimony&#x2014;such wretched meanness as he manifested on this journey I never had the shame of being connected with&#x2014;only figure&#x2014;tho he had a paragon of a Man servant there&#x2014;his going to the shops himself and buying here a pound of candles&#x2014;there <hi rend="italic">two penny worth</hi> of bread&#x2014;and there <hi rend="italic">a quarter of a pound</hi> of butter!&#x2014; &#x26;c&#x2014; Actually I had to go to a confectioners and get myself some lunch both forenoons to be kept from starving!&#x2014; When I arrived at home on Saturday forenoon I was scarce recognisable &#x201C;upon <hi rend="italic">my</hi> honour&#x201D;&#x2014; Mazzini said &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">My Dear</hi> you look most like what shall I say&#x2014;Lady Macbeth in the sleeping scene.&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>
<p>But I deserved it all for having let myself be over-persuaded into such a frantic measure as going from home with <hi rend="italic">him</hi>&#x2014;</p>
<p>That same evening I took <hi rend="italic">Bessey</hi> Mudie to the Manchester Railway, and then I swallowed a tumbler of <hi rend="italic">stiff</hi> brandy <foreign>negus</foreign> and tumbled into my own red bed&#x2014;Heaven bless it!&#x2014;and slept&#x2014;Oh so sound!&#x2014;like a dead thing&#x2014;till the middle of the night when I was awoke with pain in my head&#x2014; I sat up in my bed to ascertain if possible <hi rend="italic">where I was</hi> and <hi rend="italic">how it all was</hi>&#x2014;and there in the middle of my bed I&#x2014;what shall I say&#x2014;lost myself!!</p>

<salute>Dear Fitzgerald,</salute>
<p>Your letter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of [ca. <date when="1843-07-16">16 July</date>].</note> found me amid the mists, rain-tempests, slate-chasms and other intricacies of a Welsh tour, on which enterprise I had embarked some weeks before. I have now got home to my Mother&#x2019;s <pb id="pg-17-50" n="17:50"/>Cottage; heartily tired, meaning to rest here for a week or two, and see what will come of that. All sight of waterfalls and such like, almost all speech of men, shall be far from me for a while! I do literally nothing: I saunter along the slopes of the high grounds, wide grassy expanses, bare of wood, tenanted only by sheep which need no shepherd, where all is silent, in this noble Autumn weather, &#x201C;as if Pan <hi rend="italic">slept</hi>.&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Untraced.</note> At evening I can see the windows of Carlisle, twenty miles off, gleaming against the setting sun; and westward and southward an endless sea of mountains, not one of them speaking an impatient word to me;&#x2014;and so I rove about, and like Alexander Selkirk, for the time being, am monarch of all I survey.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Cowper, &#x201C;Verses Supposed to be Written by Alexander Selkirk.&#x201D; Selkirk (<date when="1676-00-00">1676</date>&#x2013;<date when="1721-00-00">1721</date>) was the original of Defoe&#x2019;s Robinson Crusoe; see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18311113-TC-JAC-01"><sic>6:45</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1831-11-13">13 Nov. 1831</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014;</p>
<p>My purpose to visit Naseby holds firm as ever. Nothing is fixed with me as to movements farther, except that I do not return to Babylon till this month of <date when="1843-08-00">August</date> and its heats be over. If your projects continue firm, perhaps the end of your &#x201C;six weeks&#x201D; might almost suit the time of my return southward: in that case it would be right pleasant for me to pause at Crick, and spend a couple of days with you at Naseby; terminating my travels in a worthy manner.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >FitzGerald had written in <date when="1843-07-00">mid-July</date>: &#x201C;I came to Ireland nearly a week ago, and shall be here, I suppose, six weeks or so. Then back to England and to Naseby&#x2014;will you come to that place then?&#x201D; (Terhune, <hi rend="italic">LEF</hi> 1:392). Crick was the closest railway station to Naseby, 9 mi. away.</note> But it is not worthwhile to alter anything on my account: if you have not returned as I pass, we will wait for some other opportunity. Write, some time soon, how it is. I shall be here yet for a week or ten days; here or appointed to return hither.</p>
<p>Were my travelling faculty a shade better, I should be tempted to run up to Dunbar;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Port 30 mi. E of Edinburgh, where Cromwell defeated Gen. David Leslie&#x2019;s army of covenanters, <date when="1650-09-03">3 Sept. 1650</date>.</note> and see if on the spot it were possible, what by all books and study it has never hitherto been, to form some rational conjecture about the manner of the Fight there. I went about a hundred miles out of my way to see Gloucester and Worcester,&#x2014;and made mighty little of them when I did see them! The &#x201C;crowning mercy&#x201D; <note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >From a letter by Cromwell, <date when="1651-09-04">4 Sept. 1651</date>, reporting his victory at Worcester the preceding day; see <hi rend="italic">Cromwell, Works</hi> 7:331.</note> I could only look at from Severn Bridge, with a poor labourer out of work for guide, who &#x201C;wished to God we had another Oliver, Sir, times is so cruel bad!&#x201D; I wished it too, but knew not where to find him. One wanders in vain over battlefields and antiquarian wrecks seeking the <pb id="pg-17-51" n="17:51"/>man; he is not here, he has gone to his place<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Mark 16:6.</note>&#x2014;and has left Peel Russel and comp<hi rend="italic">y</hi> behind him.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lord John Russell (<date when="1792-00-00">1792</date>&#x2013;<date when="1878-00-00">1878</date>; <ref target="volume-17/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/24325"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), M.P. for the City of London and leader of the opposition to Peel&#x2019;s gov&#x2019;t.</note></p>
<p>Spedding&#x2019;s Brother wishes me over to Skiddaw and his Lake Country which is about forty miles off. It is uncertain whether I shall be equal to going. The charms of <hi rend="italic">sitting still</hi> are great! Yet Thomas Spedding is a chief favourite of mine; I sit not still without regret. James S., it seems, is shooting partridges in Yorkshire, and shortly expected at his Brother&#x2019;s.</p>
<p>As to the Picturesque, I have been dreadfully annoyed with it ever since I left home. Not properly with <hi rend="italic">it</hi>, for I rather like big rocks, high mountains, swift rivers, etc, as I suppose all mortal men since the beginning of the world have done; but the eternal cackle and babble about it from all persons, even sensible persons, in these times, is truly distressing to me. It is like a human being uttering to me, &#x201C;Cuck-<hi rend="italic">oo!</hi> Cuck-<hi rend="italic">oo!</hi>&#x201D; With a tongue that might speak real <hi rend="italic">words</hi>. Far more shocking than you think!&#x2014; This among other things attracts me rather to these bare solitudes: the grand meaning of <hi rend="italic">them</hi> too is that God Eternal made them, that they are still solitary of all but the needful four-legged sheep!</p>
<p>Well; I bid you enjoy the Green Island,<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ireland.</note> I bid you pray daily you could cure what is ragged and awry in it, by <hi rend="italic">Repail</hi> or otherwise; <note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Daniel O&#x2019;Connell (<date when="1775-00-00">1775</date>&#x2013;<date when="1847-00-00">1847</date>; <ref target="volume-17/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/20501"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), now M.P. for Cork, had founded the Repeal Assoc., <date when="1840-00-00">1840</date>, for repeal of the Act of Union of <date when="1800-00-00">1800</date> (which unified the parliaments of Ireland and Britain), because of his conviction that the root of Ireland&#x2019;s poverty was political.

<salute>Dearest,</salute>
<p>The Tailor called at the Post-Office this morning, but got nothing: as he did not even get an <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> which ought to have come last night, and confesses that he saw only a little boy, I am in hopes it may be a miss, and that when we try again tonight there may be a line from Goody after all. At night indeed there will have come another post, nay properly two others. I have never yet got authentic news or sign of your return to Chelsea, and am now anxious to hear. No use making a toil of a pleasure; no use writing to me when it is a hurry and a burden to write: but yet&#x2014;but yet there is an insatiable appetite for Goody Letters in me at this time! Think also what it is to be &#x201C;vaixed&#x201D;; and on the whole do thy best.</p>
<p>Fitzgerald&#x2019;s Letter inviting me to Naseby has never been answered till this morning; I have no appetite for writing, for speaking, or in short doing anything but sitting still as a stone while that is conceded me!&#x2014; Confound it, here are two beggarly people from Ecclefechan come driving in a Gig in probable search for me! May the Devil give them luck of it. I hope Jenny will gulp a lie (<hi rend="italic">door</hi> lie) for my sake.

<p>What kind of weather you have in London I know not; but here it is hot as Demerara,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In Guyana.</note> windless with a burning sun: I do not count on getting out at all till night. Even then a drive will be better than a walk. I am lazy, in addition to all; lazy as I almost never was. Work past or future, not to speak of present, is a weariness to me. I sometimes think of Cromwell:&#x2014;O Heaven I shall need to be in another mood than now! The truth is, dear Goody, my <hi rend="italic">castor</hi> proved an entire <pb id="pg-17-53" n="17:53"/>humbug, and I am a wreck ever since! I must take new measures; this will never do. I am as languid almost as Isabella: poor Isabella, she cannot <hi rend="italic">speak</hi> but in a whisper, all self-motion is nearly impossible for her; only for some half hour or less can she stand being driven slowly in the gig, or led about on the back of an Ass. She complains of cold too, if not wrapt in threefold wool, in this burning weather. Jamie is very kind to her.</p>
<p>Jack has not yet given sign of himself from Dumfries; I fear all peace will go with his arrival, which is to be expected daily. He needs a new project every three days, having nothing of his own to do,&#x2014;not even this poor thing of mine, To do nothing. He also is much to be pitied, if one did not incline to censure him rather. News from Alick are anxiously expected, &#x201C;before long now.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The Tailor has turned me off two pairs of good trowsers, has two winter waistcoasts, and much else in progress: I find nothing wrong but the Dumfries buttons yet, which I have duly execrated, and flung aside, &#x2014;poor hunger-ridden quack-ridden Dumfries! Wages yesterday at Lockerby Fair were &#x201C;lower than any man ever saw them.&#x201D; A harvest man for five weeks coming hither is to have one sovereign: a weaker individual works thro&#x2019; the same period for 15 shillings or 12/6 according as he proves. The latter is a shoemaker&#x2019;s apprentice, who has harvest granted him to earn his year&#x2019;s apparel: fifteen shillings will not do it handsomely! Ruin, by sliding-scales and other conveyances, slides rapidly on all men.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >At the Lockerby Fair, <date when="1843-08-15">15 Aug.</date>, the number of lambs for sale was down and prices were low.</note></p>

Ralph Erskine (<date when="1685-00-00">1685</date>&#x2013;<date when="1752-00-00">1752</date>), poet, minister at Dunfermline; although sympathetic to the founding of the Secession Church, <date when="1733-00-00">1733</date>, he did not secede till <date when="1737-00-00">1737</date>.</note> It is <pb id="pg-17-54" n="17:54"/>absolutely very strange. A long soft poke-cheeked face, with busy anxious black eyes, &#x201C;looking as if he could not help it&#x201D;;&#x2014;and then such a character, and form of human existence: conscience living to the finger-ends of him, in a strange, venerable tho&#x2019; highly questionable manner! There have been strange men in this world;&#x2014;and indeed every man is strange enough. This Ralph makes me reflect&#x2014;Whitherward are we now bound? What has become of all that? Is man grown into a kind of brute that can merely spin, and make railways? <foreign><hi rend="italic">Mir w&#xE4;re lieber dass ich pl&#xF6;tzlich st&#xfc;rbe</hi></foreign> [I should be happy to die suddenly].</p>
<p>O Jeannie dear what is the use of scribbling away in this manner Were it not better that I lit my pipe, and suddenly sat silent? A small utterance of clatter to somebody is essential now and then for man; and Goody falls to receive it this time,&#x2014;the unfortunate Goody!</p>
<p>By the bye, will you bid Helen look in the cellar, bring you up my Tobacco store; and do you lift the papers, and examine what is becoming of the thing. You may look also in the desk-drawer (top-drawer, right hand); and see what is passing there. Nay there is still, I think, some accumulation in the big black canister, which used to sit in the press now torn away; let the eye of the mistress alight there too.&#x2014; And tell me generally in what state the House is; whether Pearson and Co are fairly out of it; what the neighbouring Piano says &#x26;c &#x26;c. Were the weather once cool enough, I must bend back thither, and take to some kind of work. Unhappy wanderer that I am; not in the least calculated for wandering! It is the idlest trade a Son of Adam can follow. A trade entailed upon me while I continue Cockney! Let us be patient.&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>
<p>I awoke this morning at half past five: it is the first time I have yet failed here of a long good sleep; perhaps it was useful to <hi rend="italic">fail?</hi> I will out and walk at any rate. I send my blessings to poor Goody; I wish I had her in my pocket here! I do not think I shall write tomorrow, but will promise nothing <foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dearest. The sun begins to get around even into this window, for the hours are bending westward: I had better fly out of this,&#x2014;and put on a pair of jane<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Twilled cotton.</note> trowsers!</p>

<salute>Dear John</salute>
<p>Thanks for your remembrance of my friend&#x2014; But this situation would never do&#x2014; Miss B&#xF6;lte is a woman of too much mind and heart for being made into mince-meat to indiscriminate boardingschool misses:&#x2014;at &#x201C;a small salary&#x201D; too!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC had written many of her friends and acquaintances in search of a position for Amalie B&#xF6;lte. In a letter postmarked <date when="1843-07-25">25 July 184[3 or <date when="1846-07-25">6</date>?]</date>, Thackeray replied: &#x201C;For God&#x2019;s sake stop M<hi rend="italic">lle</hi> Boelte&#x2014;I have governidges calling at all hours with High Dutch accents and reams of testimonials. One to day, one yesterday &#x26; a letter, or letter the day before, and on going to dine at Punch by Heavens there was a letter from a German lady on my plate. And I don&#x2019;t want a Gerwoman; and all our plans are uncertain&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Letters of Thackeray,</hi> ed. G. N. Ray [<date when="1946-00-00">1946</date>] 2:242).</note> <foreign>Ach gott!</foreign> Better one good sixpenny-worth of arsenic once for all, than to prolong existence in <hi rend="italic">that</hi> fashion!&#x2014; <hi rend="italic">I</hi> at least should choose the arsenic in her place, and I estimate her quick determination too highly not to believe she would do the same.</p>
<p>For the rest; I was never more thankful in my life than to get home again&#x2014;my disgusts at Ryde had reached the point of insupportability and, tho&#x2019; there had not been &#x201C;a <hi rend="italic">Mudie</hi>&#x201D; in existence, I must have flown, to save my own life!&#x2014;from <hi rend="italic">bugs</hi>&#x2014;from <foreign><hi rend="italic">vacuum</hi></foreign>&#x2014;from every thing moral and material that I most particularly abhor!&#x2014; What else could possibly come of an adventure entered on under such auspices? Well! I have got <hi rend="italic">some</hi> good out of it anyhow&#x2014;<foreign>viz</foreign>: a more open sense for the comforts of my own lot&#x2014;especially for the inestimable blessing I enjoy in having a bedroom undisturbed by noise and without vestige of bugs.</p>
<p>&#x201C;<hi rend="italic">My Dear</hi>&#x201D;&#x2014;said Mazzini who came for news of me half an hour after my return, and was amazed to find my living self&#x2014; &#x201C;My Dear&#x2014; <pb id="pg-17-56" n="17:56"/>you are in four days no longer the same! I find you&#x2014;what shall I say?&#x2014;looking <hi rend="italic">strange</hi> upon <hi rend="italic">my</hi> honour!&#x2014;most like Lady Macbeth in the sleeping scene&#x201D;! No wonder&#x2014;so many hideous nights were enough to have made one with a twentieth part of my excitability into a somnambulist&#x2014; But it is all over now thank god&#x2014;that is; the great damnatory fact is over&#x2014;and the consequences&#x2014;the headachs &#x26;c &#x26;c will soon be over also&#x2014;</p>
<p>A letter from my husband today indicates that he is still in being&#x2014;and without any present intention of coming home&#x2014;</p>
<p>I found your Straford on my table when I arrived for which accept my benediction&#x2014; It has not however got itself cut up yet&#x2014;I have been too ill and too busy&#x2014; Fancy a <hi rend="italic">Secretary of State</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Maid of all work</hi> jumbled into one&#x2014;and a perpetual dull headach for crowning complication!&#x2014;</p>

A crime, which ought to be punished. But at no time could the Letter have come more pleasantly to hand: in the glorious twilight, all heat now grown tepid, and the Sun gone to other countries that needed him more, I had wandered out in hope of meeting the messenger; and meet him I did on the Potter Knowe beyond Middlebie, and saw by the look of him that he had a Letter from Goody; and there under the last light of blessed day nothing but soft vapours and silence round me everywhere it was read.

<p>Young Sterling has been ill-advised to publish that simulacrum of a <hi rend="italic">Strafford,</hi> good for little that I see, except to shew that a man wanted to write a Tragedy. Fuz&#x2019;s critical doctrines, so far as he has any, are rather weak; but his feeling of the total hollowness of the Article and his desire to express that by some doctrinal proposition or other are good. When will that mania of the legitimate drammars end? How glad am I he has given <hi rend="italic">you</hi> this Copy; it will be you my dame and not I that have to answer! After all some of those Extracts are decidedly better than anything I can recollect of the <hi rend="italic">Ms.</hi> Strafford: probably the print introduces them more handsomely; the ugly illegibility of the handwriting has no doubt hut it somewhat with me.</p>
<p>Jack, as was to be anticipated, decides on getting hither tomorrow. Not without a considerable explosion of cross-purposes and other misarrangements already! Peace of course will depart when he arrives; and our stay here must not be long.</p>

<salute>My Child</salute>
<p>The sympathy that is between thee and me has something of&#x2014;what shall I say&#x2014;supernatural in it. Morally and materially we go on at this distance in the beautifulest fellowship of worries&#x2014;first heart-worries that cannot be put on paper&#x2014;then household-worries from cleanings &#x26;c&#x2014;and finally indignant worries with one&#x2019;s maid&#x2014;during the last week I have been exercising a quantity of philosophy that will never be known or estimated &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">here</hi>-down,&#x201D; in merely abstaining from taking a poker and killing Helen for the woe she has brought me&#x2014;</p>
<p>But to start fair&#x2014; After I wrote to you last I was really very ill&#x2014; I did not get over my horrid Ryde expedition so easily as I expected&#x2014; I had a spell of headachs and the most extraordinary aches in my limbs as well making it imperative on me for one day to keep my bed&#x2014; Well I had got on foot again, Carlyle had begun to <hi rend="italic">talk</hi> of coming home&#x2014; I must wind up my fag ends of radical reform and get in readiness for him&#x2014;and just when I was sitting down to breakfast with a feeling of the necessity of despatch making me rather flighty&#x2014;says Helen &#x201C;My!&#x2014; I was just looking up at the corner of my bed this morning, and there ye <foreign>ken</foreign> what should I see but two <foreign><hi rend="italic">bogues</hi></foreign> (<hi rend="italic">anglic&#xEA;</hi> bugs!) I hope there&#x2019;s <foreign>nae mair</foreign>&#x201D;! &#x201C;Good god said I you hope? It will be a precious affair if you have let bugs into your bed again after the fright you got five years ago&#x201D;!</p>
<p>And off I ran to investigate with my own eyes&#x2014;I had <hi rend="italic">killed</hi> two in the first instant&#x2014;and on pulling the bed separate I saw&#x2014;oh heaven and earth plenty of &#x201C;little <hi rend="italic">beings</hi>&#x201D; (as Mazzini would say) moving&#x2014;I told her so in despair&#x2014; But now she considered her honour concerned&#x2014;went and investigated after me and returned very angry to tell me &#x201C;there was not a single <foreign><hi rend="italic">bogue</hi></foreign> there&#x2014;<hi rend="small-caps">she</hi> had looked and there was nothing of the sort&#x2014;needless to argue with a wild animal&#x2014;so there was nothing for it but to have back Pearson and get the bed taken down&#x2014; Which Helen <hi rend="italic">left</hi> me to do with him myself, going out messages during the time and staying&#x2014;that she might not be <hi rend="italic">openly</hi> proved in the wrong&#x2014; It was just as well for plainly she would have been an insecure hand to have delegated such a critical business to&#x2014; We found them as Pearson phrased it &#x201C;pretty strong&#x201D; and the slaughter was a thing to make ones blood curdle to think back on. With my own hands I threw some twenty pails of water over the kitchen floor to drown any who might attempt to save themselves&#x2014;and all the bed was then flung <pb id="pg-17-60" n="17:60"/>piece by piece into water and steeped for several days&#x2014;and emboldened by my former victory. I do opine that there is no <foreign>bogue</foreign> alive therein But in the course of my bug investigations I had made another discovery the woolmatrass under her was absolutely alive with moths threatening soon to eat up the whole house&#x2014;so all that had to be pulled in pieces and washed and boiled and put in again&#x2014;and then I could not rest till I had all the other beds taken down and looked into&#x2014;all except my own&#x2014;in which so long as I am not <hi rend="italic">bitten</hi> I may be perfectly sure there is no shadow of a bug&#x2014; A simpler way would have been to have gone and slept in them all by turns but that idea was too horrible to me.</p>
<p>So you may figure what a week I have had&#x2014;for seeking after bugs and slaying them is a mission that cannot be delegated&#x2014; I have been up at seven every morning and not in bed til twelve&#x2014;and have never got half done that I proposed to do in the morning&#x2014; So you may figure that when the letters that must be written to the master of the house were written I had little faculty never to speak of time remaining&#x2014;the idea of his arriving at home after such a time consumed in brightening the outside of the platter and finding me in a beastly mess of this sort being an idea that has chased me all thro the day and even haunted my dreams&#x2014;</p>
<p>Surely some time again we shall be at leisure Babby!&#x2014; It does not look like it yet&#x2014;</p>
<p>I do pity you with <hi rend="italic">your</hi> servants from the bottom of my heart&#x2014; And what is to come of you?&#x2014; You cannot go away and leave strangers in the house? Should not Helen return now and let <hi rend="italic">you</hi> go a while&#x2014;</p>
<p>I have a hundred things to tell you some of them much more poetical than what I <hi rend="italic">have</hi> told&#x2014;but it is midnight and I am dead weary&#x2014;and if I do not go to bed I shall put myself entirely off my nights rest which I need of all things</p>
<p>The quantity of needlework too that I have done! the beautiful house that I have maid&#x2014;for absolutely nothing at all so far as money is concerned! If I had you now to shew it you all and then kiss you&#x2014;after twenty times what a difference</p>
<closer><salute>Your own /</salute></closer> <name>Jane C</name>
<ps><p>The garters! never once thanked you for them&#x2014;Ah&#x2014;but they had passed away from me! Only think I gave them to Darwin and said you worked them for him and the poor man blushed up to the eyes and so will you at hearing of it&#x2014;never mind I put it all to rights after I told him you had worked them for me who <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> wear that sort and that I <pb id="pg-17-61" n="17:61"/>could not have them wasted on anybody <hi rend="italic">you</hi> did not care for He declared he should be <hi rend="italic">delighted</hi> to receive them&#x2014;!</p>
<p>Just as I was going to seal I bethink me of that eternal picture&#x2014;(and I have not a bit of writing paper left)&#x2014; Only, fancy it&#x2014; When I was thinking that at last you had it safe&#x2014;for they were so beautifully packed in wadding&#x2014;and tied up and all <hi rend="italic">sealed</hi> there comes a note from Geraldine&#x2014;saying &#x201C;she had received from Juliet Mudie a <hi rend="italic">sealed</hi> parcel for you to her Care that she knew at once&#x2014;it was my picture&#x2014;she struggled with her inclination for two days&#x2014;finally she could hold out no longer but broke the seals and now there I was <hi rend="italic">sitting very like myself</hi> on the drawingroom table!!! &#x201C;&#x2014;so much for confession&#x2014;then for humble request&#x201D; might she&#x2014;surely she might get Patten to make <hi rend="italic">her</hi> a sketch from it!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <date when="1843-00-00">1843</date> Manchester directory lists two Pattens, Daniel and John, both of Tickle St., nr.

<p>If you expect a <hi rend="italic">spirited</hi> letter from me to day either; I grieve that you will be disappointed.

Darwin came yesterday after my dinnertime&#x2014;I had dined at three&#x2014;and remarked in the course of some speculative discourse that I &#x201C;looked as if I needed <pb id="pg-17-62" n="17:62"/>to go to Gunter&#x2019;s and have an ice&#x201D;!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Fashionable confectioners, 7&#x2013;8 Berkeley Sq., founded by Domenico Negri, <date when="1775-00-00">1775</date>.</note> do you comprehend what sort of <hi rend="italic">look that</hi> can be? certainly he was right anyhow; for driving to Gunters and having an ice revived me considerably&#x2014;it was the first time I had felt <hi rend="italic">up to</hi> crossing the threshold since I took Bessey Mudie to the railway the same evening I returned from Ryde&#x2014; Darwin was very <hi rend="italic">clever</hi> yesterday: he remarked&#x2014;apropos of a pamphlet of Maurice&#x2019;s (which by the way is come for you) intitled: <hi rend="italic">A letter to Lord Ashley respecting a certain proposed measure for stifling the expression of opinion in the university of Oxford</hi><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >F. D. Maurice, <hi rend="italic">On Right and Wrong Methods of Supporting Protestantism</hi> (<date when="1843-00-00">1843</date>). Maurice defended the right of Tractarians to speak their views, a right that Lord Ashley and certain evangelicals believed should be suppressed. In <date when="1843-05-00">May</date> Pusey had been suspended from the office of univ. preacher at Oxford for two years on the charge of Romanism.</note>&#x2014;that &#x201C;pamphlets were for some men just what a fit of the gout was for others&#x2014;they cleared the system&#x2014;so that they could go on again pretty comfortably for a while.&#x201D;&#x2014; He told me also a curious conversation amongst three <hi rend="italic">grooms</hi>&#x2014;at which Wrightson had <hi rend="italic">assisted</hi> the day before in a railway carriage<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Wrightson had introduced Darwin to the Carlyles; see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350615-TC-JAC-01"><sic>8:152</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1835-06-15">15 June 1835</date></corr></ref>.
He is probably Thomas Barnardiston Wrightson (<date when="1806-00-00">1806</date>&#x2013;<date when="1850-00-00">50</date>), fifth son of William Wrightson of Cusworth, Yorkshire; educ.

Groom the first took a pamphlet from his pocket saying he had bought it two days ago and never found a minute to read it yet&#x2014; Groom the second inquired the subject&#x2014; 1<hi rend="italic">st</hi> Groom &#x201C;Oh a hit at the Pusseyists&#x201D;! 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Groom:&#x2014;&#x201C;The Pusseyists?&#x2014; Ha&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">they</hi> are for bringing us back to the times when people <hi rend="italic">burnt</hi> one another!&#x2014;</p>

<p>3<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Groom&#x2014; Well I cannot say about the Pusseyists&#x2014;but <hi rend="italic">my</hi> opinion is that what we need is more <hi rend="italic">christianity</hi> and less <hi rend="italic">religionism&#x201D;!!!</hi> Now Wrightson swears that every word of this is literally as the men spoke it&#x2014;and certainly Wrightson <hi rend="italic">could</hi> not <hi rend="italic">invent!</hi></p>
<p>I had a long letter from Sterling which stupidly I flung into the fire in a rage (the <hi rend="italic">fire?</hi>&#x2014;yes&#x2014;it is only for the last two days that I have not needed fire in the mornings!) and I bethought me afterwards, that I had better have sent it to <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, whom its cool Robert Macaire<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A rogue in cartoons of Honor&#xE9; Daumier (<date when="1808-00-00">1808</date>&#x2013;<date when="1879-00-00">79</date>); see <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380915-TC-JWC-01"><sic>10:179</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1838-09-15">15 Sept. 1838</date></corr></ref>. The letter was from Edward Sterling.</note>&#x2014;impudence might have amused&#x2014;tho I, still suffering from his vile conduct felt only enraged by it&#x2014; Only fancy his inviting me to <hi rend="italic">come</hi> <hi rend="small-caps">back</hi> and <pb id="pg-17-63" n="17:63"/>&#x201C;<hi rend="italic">this time</hi> he would take care that I should have habitable lodgings&#x201D;&#x2014;His letter began&#x2014;&#x201C;the last chord which held me to existence here is snapped&#x201D;&#x2014;meaning <hi rend="italic">me!</hi> and&#x2014;so on!&#x2014; Oh &#x201C;the Devil fly away with&#x201D; the old sentimental curmudgeon!</p>
<p>I had letters from both Mr and Mrs Buller yesterday&#x2014;explaining their having failed to invite me&#x2014;she appears to have been worse than ever&#x2014;and is likely to be soon here again&#x2014; Poor old Bullers modest hope that the new medicine &#x201C;may not turn <hi rend="italic">Madam blue</hi>&#x201D; is really touching!</p>
<p>Here is your letter come&#x2014;and you have not yet got any from me since my return! <hi rend="italic">Somebody</hi> must have been very negligent for I wrote to you on Sunday added a postscript on Monday and sent off both letter and newspapers by Helen in perfectly good time. It is very provoking after one has been (as Helen says) &#x201C;just <hi rend="italic">most</hi> particular&#x201D; not to vaix you, to find that you have been <hi rend="italic">vaixed</hi> nevertheless&#x2014; You ask the state of the house <hi rend="italic">Pearson &#x26; co are</hi> out of it&#x2014; <hi rend="italic">Both the public rooms</hi>&#x2014;are in a state of perfect habitableness again&#x2014;a little still to be done in the needlework department&#x2014;but nothing (like Todger&#x2019;s Boy&#x2019;s nose) &#x201C;to speak of&#x201D;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Dickens, <hi rend="italic">Martin Chuzzlewit</hi> ch. 8, in which the serving-boy at Todgers&#x2019;s boarding house is said to have &#x201C;no nose to speak of.&#x201D; Originally JWC had made a small &#x201C;t&#x201D; in &#x201C;Todger&#x2019;s&#x201D; and then changed it to a capital. On the copy the word has been transcribed as &#x201C;Rodger&#x2019;s,&#x201D; and TC has crossed out the &#x201C;R&#x201D; and written above the line: &#x201C;(<hi rend="italic">See</hi> in Dickens&#x2019; work).&#x201D; Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi> prints &#x201C;Dodger&#x2019;s.&#x201D;</note>&#x2014; <hi rend="italic">Your</hi> bedroom of which the ceiling had to be whitened and the paint washed &#x26;c &#x26;c will be habitable by tomorrow&#x2014; The front bedrooms into which all the confusion had been piled are still to clean&#x2014;but that will soon be done&#x2014; my own bed room also needs to have the carpet beaten and the bed-curtains taken down and brushed&#x2014;all this would have been completed by this time but for a most unexpected and soul-sickening <hi rend="italic">mess</hi> which I discovered in the kitchen&#x2014;which has caused work for several days&#x2014;only fancy while I was brightening up the outside of the platter to find in Helen&#x2019;s bed a new colony of bugs!!&#x2014;
I tell you of it fearlessly <hi rend="italic">this time</hi>, as past victory gives me a sense of superiority over the creatures.

<salute>My poor little Dame,</salute>
<p>I am very sorry for thy headache; for the complication of mischances that have attended this Ryde expedition. Tell me soon that it is over now, that all is right again.</p>
<p>If you have weather at Chelsea like ours here, it must be frightful! I remember nothing hotter; the sun blazing, hardly a breath of air stirring. Till today too, there has not even been a country <hi rend="italic">view</hi> to comfort one; all was hot steamy haze, falling at night as a very shower of dew. Today however, one sees Cumberland again; sitting under the <pb id="pg-17-66" n="17:66"/>shade of a tree, it is not so bad. We are bound for Burnswark; all to go and dine there, tho&#x2019; the Gig will only hold two: it is the inevitable! Poor Grahame has his back at the wall; one must humour him in this sad whim he has. Jack is to walk beforehand, by a shorter road, and announce us; my Mother and I are to drive together.</p>
<p>Jack arrived last night, bringing your Letter with him: he is studiously bent on good order and quiet hitherto; but it will of course be impossible: I must get him over into Cumberland, up to Craigenputtoch or somewhither: my days of repose here cannot now be long!&#x2014; If the Ferguses write to me,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >From Kirkcaldy; See <ref target="volume-17/lt-18430817-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1843-08-17">17 Aug.</date></ref>].</note> I am not sure but I may go. It would really be the handiest way of getting home again; besides I do want to see the ground of Dunbar Battle,&#x2014;it is the last locality of Cromwell I had in view! If, after that, I do not <hi rend="italic">write</hi> a <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> of one sort or the other, localities at least will do nothing for me. On the whole, I believe, I <hi rend="italic">must</hi> set to work, and <foreign>handsel</foreign> [use for the first time] the new Library and Goody&#x2019;s repairs by writing a thing of the sort in it. We shall make the attempt, shall we not?</p>
<p>This morning I read the article &#x201C;Thomas Carlyle&#x201D; in the <hi rend="italic">Border Magazine:</hi> you once saw an extract from it in the newspapers.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For William Thom&#x2019;s article, <date when="1842-10-00">Oct. 1842</date>, see <ref target="volume-15/lt-18421116-TC-MAC-01"><sic>15:184&#x2013;85</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1842-11-16">16 Nov. 1842</date></corr></ref>.</note> I intended to cut the whole thing out, and send it you; but Jean&#x2019;s own copy is lost, and this which she has borrowed is to be returned intact. Little matter! But the thing is good enough: the poor writer of it has quitted his School-office for Non-Intrusionism; Duncan of Ruthwell and the others have made him Editor of a Newspaper they are about starting in Dumfries and mean to call the <hi rend="italic">Standard:</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Dumfries and Galloway Standard</hi> had begun <date when="1843-03-22">22 March</date> as a liberal weekly to support the evangelical party; the owners were George Henderson and twenty-seven shareholders, of whom half joined the Disruption. Its first ed. was Henry Duncan, then William Johnstone, <date when="1843-00-00">1843</date>&#x2013;<date when="1846-00-00">46</date>. Presumably Thom was an asst. ed.</note> poor fellows! The reading of Ralph Erskine has given me strange reflexions as to the profoundly <hi rend="italic">enveloped</hi> state in which all Sons of Adam live. This poor Ralph, and his formulas casing him all round like the shell of a beetle: what a thing it is!
&#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Chraist</hi>&#x201D; and so ma<supplied>[n]</supplied>y poor AEneas Raits,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Aeneas Rate or Rait, originally from Northumberland; like John Carlyle had attended Edinburg Univ., <date when="1822-00-00">1822</date>, first-year lit.; a poet and religious enthusiast; see <ref target="volume-03/lt-18240101-TC-JAC-01"><sic>3:5</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1824-01-01">1 Jan. 1824</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-04/lt-18271129-TC-JAC-01"><sic>4:291</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1827-11-29">29 Nov. 1827</date></corr></ref>.

Man is a born owl. I consider it good however that one do <hi rend="italic">not</hi> get into the state of a <hi rend="italic">beetle;</hi> that one try to keep one&#x2019;s shells <hi rend="italic">open</hi>, or at least openable: I mean to persist in endeavouring that.</p>

<p>Jack saw Mrs Cunningham, as you noticed in his Note; she had not been in Dumfries while I was there; she was to leave it today for London, for Brompton (I think) where her son Peter was getting up a new house for himself,&#x2014;I hope not for her too; Mrs Peter being of the Martins who are all wildish in the head!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jean Cunningham (<date when="1791-00-00">1791</date>&#x2013;<date when="1864-00-00">1864</date>), widow of Allan, who d. the previous <date when="1842-10-00">Oct.</date> Peter Cunningham (<date when="1816-00-00">1816</date>&#x2013;<date when="1869-00-00">69</date>; <ref target="volume-17/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/6930"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), their third son, author and critic; clerk in audit office, <date when="1834-00-00">1834</date>, chief clerk, <date when="1854-00-00">1854</date>&#x2013;<date when="1860-00-00">60</date>; treas. of the Shakespeare Soc.; ed. of Walpole&#x2019;s letters and works of Drummond of Hawthornden; best known for his <hi rend="italic">Handbook to London</hi>, 2 vols.

<salute>Dear Spedding,</salute>
<p>Before your letter came, my Brother had taken another course; had sailed into Galloway to pay some visits there,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >SW Scotland, then thought of as including parts of Ayrshire and Dumfriesshire.</note> and left his Yorkshire expedition still hanging. He is now here; speaks dubitatingly, by no means yet desperately, of a look at Keswick and you. Neither do I as yet give it up by any means; but my laziness, nay let me say my weariness is great! I have been two days at Dumfries on actual heat of affairs; and refuse otherwise to stir from my place, as if I were a mountain. <pb id="pg-17-68" n="17:68"/>Of course this mood will have to end. I need to drive into the Galloway wildernesses, a course of three days; it is the one vestige of what is called business that still awaits me here. Not an unlikely thing after that, were to fling myself into the current of some railway, and get home to Chelsea, at one fell swoop, longing that the 30 miles an hour were 300!&#x2014; On the other hand there is a kind of call into Fifeshire, to old friends there,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Ferguses.</note> and places sad but ever-memorable. I want to see the ground of the Battle of Dunbar, and try if human nature <hi rend="italic">can</hi> understand it. Oliver&#x2019;s battlefields are now almost all personal acquaintances of mine; the man himself is grown a personal acquaintance,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; alas, still a dumb one: he ought now to speak, or else hold his tongue forever. On Severn Bridge at Worcester an honest nutbrown peasant, of whom I was asking questions, said to me: &#x201C;Well, I think, we need another Oliver, Sir; times is at such a pass!&#x201D;&#x2014; From Fife I should get home at once by steam.</p>
<p>The difficulty of Keswick is, whether we could come in one day? We have a stout free-going free-feeding pony of fair size, a tight enough rustic &#x201C;respectability&#x201D;: but we are twenty miles on the wrong side of Carlisle. The notion of staying all night at Cock Bridge<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Village on river Cocker, nr. Keswick.</note> is appalling! My Farmer Brother<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James.</note> speaks well of the horse&#x2019;s capabilities: Mirehouse<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Home of Spedding&#x2019;s father, John (<date when="1770-00-00">1770</date>&#x2013;<date when="1831-00-00">1831</date>), on Bassenthwaite.</note> too, I think, is somewhat nearer than Greta Bank?&#x2014; Fife and Cumberland, I doubt, will be inexecutable if taken both: I must choose one or the other. Why <hi rend="italic">is</hi> there no wishing-carpet?<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380927-TC-TSS-01"><sic>10:194</sic><corr>TC to TSS, <date when="1838-09-27">27 Sept. 1838</date></corr></ref> and Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi> 153.</note> Why must a man lie awake amid the horrors of inns and general contradiction of sinners? Why could we not be magnetised, packed into a box, and sent like &#x201C;glass with care?&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>
<p>This is our vortex of whirling possibilities and pusillanimities; not yet fixed into any certainty; nor to be fixed till some contingencies declare themselves, and the mind of man then say to itself: &#x201C;Now, thou sluggard, thou must decide now or go to the ditch or the devil!&#x201D; I write you this account, lest in the interim you think me neglectful, oblivious, something other than I am. I would to Heaven there were a wishing-carpet;&#x2014;but there is, in plain fact, none.</p>
<p>Within a week the decision will arrive, and you shall hear of it straightaway.</p>
<p>With love and regards to all, the Game-destroyer<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Spedding, shooting in Yorkshire.</note> among the rest,</p>
<closer><salute>Yours ever truly /</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name>

<p>A terrible battle against <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;<foreign>bogues</foreign>&#x201D;:</hi> well done, Goody! Steep them all into destruction; it is a work that cannot be delegated!&#x2014; The house seems to be getting into trim again; I begin to think I ought to be back there, and falling to some work again. The days are rapidly shortening now; there is no great fear of heat henceforth. Here, at any rate, I can have no continuing city.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Heb. 13:14.</note></p>
<p>The Tailor has made me a fair stock of clothes; not much amiss at all. He is gone to his place, since Saturday night; but if I could find anywhere a little dark-speckled or black piece of stuff for a summer waistcoat, methinks I should still employ him; for these jane waistcoats, so beautiful when clean, need incessant washing; and all the other waistcoats I have are thick as house-doors, fit for frost and tempest only. Meanwhile here is a little job for Goody, if she like. Inclosed is a patch of one of the waistcoats (and pairs of trowsers) I have got; no buttons other than condemnable were procurable in these regions. Yellowish silk buttons were sent; twice as large as they ought to be; smaller, of any similar colour, existed not in Annan, Ecclefechan or Dumfries. Gilt metal buttons next came, with a detestable Prince-of-Wales feather<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >From the heraldic arms of the Prince of Wales.</note> etched on them,&#x2014;bless the mark! Perhaps I ought to have acceded in spite of the feather? The buttons lie here in the drawer; and in despair (mindful of Goody I was determined to do my poor best), certain big mother-of-pearl shirt buttons, which Jenny had got for two new flannel shirts of mine, were taken&#x2014;and they have a &#x201C;bad effect.&#x201D; There is the cloth; the buttons wanted are nine in number; let Goody, if she like, go up to Regent Street, and choose.
Silk buttons of the due size and colour would do best, I fancy; but anything that pleases Goody shall be pleasant. A penny stamp, or at the utmost a twopenny one by return of post will frank the concern; on thursday evening it may arrive. <hi rend="italic">Or,</hi> in fine, if you had rather not meddle with it, let the thing all lie there, and mind it no more till I arrive. Only, a small alteration being needful at any rate, and even another waistcoat being possible, I could make the Tailor free us of the business all at once. So much for the buttons. I think I will add one of the Prince-of Waleses (which need not be returned) that you may see whether it is <pb id="pg-17-70" n="17:70"/>admissible. Something whispers to my soul that gilt metal in any case looks too like one of Wrightson&#x2019;s philosophical groom<supplied>[s]</supplied>?<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> I feel such a noble sartorial ardour at present that I could almost resolve to provide as many clothes as would last me to the probable end of all, and so deliver my existence from what is at present a real annual plague to it.

<p>I said we could not now continue long here. Jack for these two days is perfectly quiet, having <hi rend="italic">Vittoria Accorombona</hi> to read! He is hidden today in the Linn, no man knows where. But, alas, it will end this night, and then we are a prey to all the elements. So far as I can discern, he has just one faintest vestige of a call anywhither for the present or the future: a visit to pay somebody at Darlington. He has already corresponded on the subject, and now again waits answer to some correspondence.

I find I have just one trace of a work to do here, that of going to Puttock; it will take three days; I think of embarking on that, or abandoning it, straightway. Kirkcaldy and Keswick<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >To visit either the Ferguses or the Speddings.</note> both together will be too much for me; I think I should prefer Kirkcaldy perhaps; but no word comes hitherto; no word in a day or two will amount to none for altogether. Jack rather would incline, I fancy, to go with me to the Keswick country: but it is beyond a single day&#x2019;s drive; and of Inns and their appendages I shall have enough otherwise. Travelling really has become a bore to me; it never was much else, but on that side I do believe I am getting old. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Eheu</hi></foreign> [Alas]&#x2014;I wish I had my Cromwell done: there is nothing else that will do anything for me!

<p>A poor slut of a man, Jamie&#x2019;s next neighbour here, has a farm too dear, deficient stock, arrears of rent with all manner of sorrowful <foreign><hi rend="italic">etceteras;</hi></foreign> and hangs of late years continually on the verge of ruin.

For ten days he rode and ran; &#x201C;sleeping none,&#x201D; or hardly sleeping, for ten days. By Jamie&#x2019;s help he did at length get the due &#xa3;50 ready.

<p>Our fiery weather is gone; we have it now windy, intermittent-sunny, and sufficiently cool. Lightning on Saturday night began to to gleam on us as we got home from Burnswark. Lightning, and then finally just about bedtime there commenced a lively universal battery of thunder, loud tho&#x2019; still distant and far up in the air. Had it not been for the terror of Jenny and my Mother one would have called it very beautiful. The flashes were frequent, the whole black world gleaming with that greenish-coloured splendour, fiercely bright for one instant, was grand to look upon. But the fear was great; I could see that it was reckoned for a kind of piety to fear. Poor Isabella, Jamie reported, was &#x201C;nearly dead&#x201D; with terror. The ploughman had risen from his stable-loft, left his comrades all snoring, and gone down and sat by old Betty.<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably Elizabeth Smeal (Smail), cottager and dependent at Scotsbrig; see <ref target="volume-04/lt-18280800-JWC-JCA-01"><sic>4:395</sic><corr>JWC to JCA, <date when="1828-08-23">23 Aug. 1828</date></corr></ref>.</note> The thunder went and came; it was two o&#x2019;clock before we got to sleep, and left it muttering in the distance. The God Thor has no worship here now. He was &#x201C;blowing in his beard&#x201D; at a great rate on Saturday night, and hurling his <hi rend="italic">Miollner</hi> (Smasher so-called)<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >I.e., his hammer.</note> in a really remarkable manner.</p>

I saw the poor young man on the street, a disguised Keeper walking in sight; Aird spoke to this Tennyson, naming him, that I might notice: a miniature polished edition of Alfred, like in his very voice, nay in his very turn of ideas and phraseology.

<p><salute>Dearest&#x2014;</salute> I meant to have written you an exceedingly long and satisfactory letter last evening, but a quite other work was cut out for me&#x2014; <pb id="pg-17-73" n="17:73"/>which I cannot say I regret&#x2014;it is but little good that one can do to a sane man&#x2014;whereas for an insane one much is possible&#x2014;and I did even the <hi rend="italic">impossible</hi> for such a one last night&#x2014; Poor Garnier walked in at five and staid till after nine<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;&#x2018;Garnier&#x2019; was from Baden; a revolutionary Exile, filled to the brim with mutinous confus<hi rend="italic">n</hi> of the usual kind, and with its usual consequences: a black-eyed, tall stalwart-looking mass of a man, face all cut with scars (of <hi rend="italic">duels</hi> in his student time), but expressive still of frankness, honesty, ingenuity, and good humour; <hi rend="italic">dirty</hi> for most part, yet as it were <hi rend="italic">heroically</hi> so; few man had more experience of poverty and squalor here, or took it more proudly.

Ah, me!&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note in Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM,</hi> but not on copy).</note>&#x2014; It was a selfish request on my part&#x2014; &#x2014; I would not go myself for a thousand guineas&#x2014; But send the POUND5 for Old Mary<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mills.</note> before you leave the country&#x2014;her money falls entirely done at the end of this month&#x2014; I computed it quite accurately when M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Russel wrote that she had still 30/&#x2014; She will not be <hi rend="italic">long</hi> to provide for poor old soul&#x2014;</p>
<p>I have sent the books for Lockart&#x2014;</p>
<p>I am busy with a little work just now that makes me so sad&#x2014; You remember the new curtains that came from Templand<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sent in <date when="1842-04-00">April 1842</date>.</note>&#x2014; When she made them&#x2014;she wrote to me &#x201C;they looked so beautiful that she could not find in her heart to hang them up till I should be coming again&#x201D;&#x2014;and the first sight I was to have of them was here!&#x2014;and it was here&#x2014;not there that they were to be hung up&#x2014; It needed a deal of scheming and altering to make them fit our <hi rend="italic">high</hi>-room and <hi rend="small-caps">picking out</hi> <hi rend="italic">her sewing</hi> has been such sorrowful work for me&#x2014;still I could not let anybody meddle with them except <hi rend="italic">myself</hi>&#x2014;and to keep them <hi rend="italic">lying</hi> there was just as sorrowful&#x2014; Oh dear dear&#x2014;</p>

<p><salute>Dear Goody,</salute> this evening your Letter has come; and a Boy being bound to Ecclefechan with a Horse to shoe tomorrow morning early <pb id="pg-17-76" n="17:76"/>there will, if he and all parties do their duty, still <supplied>[be]</supplied><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> time for a word to reach you on Thursday morning. The <hi rend="italic">Monday</hi> people had failed somewhere; an insignificant Note written in full time for that post went over by the Tailor; probably he, the ninth-part of a human messenger,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Referring to the proverb &#x201C;nine tailors make a man.&#x201D;</note> was in fault. I have written again since that. Tonight I got your Letter myself at Ecclefechan; being out with my Mother on a <hi rend="italic">showery</hi> drive. She is always willing to go, poor body, and it does her good; she has a wonderful heartiness of nature still left; has suffered and struggled much, and still hopes and lives. Thank God, for that among other mercies, denied to many worthier than I! Old age is not joyful; but there is sometimes a strange sad beauty in it:&#x2014;all <hi rend="italic">true</hi> things are beautiful each in its kind.</p>
<p>Surely my Dame did well in comforting poor Garnier; nay even it would seem in restoring him to sanity from insane! I know not what his project of Schools is, for I cannot yet <hi rend="italic">read</hi> your cardinal word there:<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In her <ref target="volume-17/lt-18430821-JWC-TC-01">letter of <date when="1843-08-21">21 Aug.</date></ref>, writing about Garnier&#x2019;s scheme for small schools, the second &#x201C;p&#x201D; of &#x201C;propogation&#x201D; was unclear.</note> but the business is not like to be of much practical result; I rejoice much more in the improved aspect of German economics for the poor Garnier,&#x2014;a wild man better than many a tame one. Somebody told me lately (I cannot at this moment guess who) that he had broken with the <hi rend="italic">Allgemeine Zeitung</hi><note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Newspaper founded in Stuttgart, <date when="1798-00-00">1798</date>, and transferred to Augsburg, <date when="1810-00-00">1810</date>.</note> people in the most disastrous manner, having involved them in a fatal calumny and platitude both in one about Lord Stuart de Rothsay.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charles Stuart (<date when="1779-00-00">1779</date>&#x2013;<date when="1845-00-00">1845</date>; <ref target="volume-17/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/26698"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), 1st Baron Stuart de Rothesay, diplomat; ambassador to St. Petersburg since <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>. It was JWC who told TC about Garnier and the libel in the <hi rend="italic">Allgemeine Zeitung</hi>, but TC seems to have misunderstood which Lord Stuart was involved, as in her <ref target="volume-17/lt-18430827-JWC-TC-01">letter to TC, <date when="1843-08-27">27 Aug.</date></ref>, JWC says that it was not Lord Stuart de Rothesay but Lord Dudley Coutts Stuart (<date when="1803-00-00">1803</date>&#x2013;<date when="1854-00-00">54</date>; <ref target="volume-17/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/26701"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), an outspoken advocate of Polish independence.</note> Let us pity the poor <hi rend="italic">mad</hi> man.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech, modifying &#x201C;pity the poor white man&#x201D;; see <ref target="volume-03/lt-18241110-JBW-TC-01"><sic>3:190</sic><corr>JBW to TC, <date when="1824-11-10">10 Nov. 1824</date></corr></ref>.</note></p>
<p>Adamson writes to me tonight to sign &#x201C;the call&#x201D; for some Intrusion Parson to Dunscore in room of poor Bryden:<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Adamson had asked TC to support a new Church of Scotland minister (who accepted intrusion, or the presentation of a minister by the patron) for Dunscore, which was in the presentation of the crown, to replace the Rev. Robert Bryden (<date when="1792-00-00">1792</date>&#x2013;<date when="1860-00-00">1860</date>), there since <date when="1822-00-00">1822</date>, who had joined the Disruption in May and become the Dunscore Free Church minister.

Five-and-thirty shillings for five harvest weeks were the common wages for a complete harvest man at Lockerby Fair; &#x201C;such wages as were never heard of before,&#x201D; says Jamie, &#x201C;Since I kenned the woral.&#x201D; Jamie pays his own man, last year<supplied>[&#x2019;s]</supplied> wages, five-and-forty: &#x201C;Folk think,&#x201D; he says, they will make it a&#x2019;right by screwing doon <foreign>thae puir craturs</foreign>.&#x201D; He is a good fellow Jamie; he was greatly flattered by your <hi rend="italic">salutation</hi>,<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The kiss sent in the postscript of <ref target="volume-17/lt-18430811-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1843-08-11">11 Aug.</date>]</ref>.</note> the shadow of which I duly communicated to him; making him blush up to the eyes. He has a somewhat heavy burden, and bears it well.</p>
<p>Certainly I will send something to Macready: but up to this moment I can think of nobody worth knowing but Emerson and perhaps Greig. I will at least write a Note to himself one of these very days. The Yankees are fading altogether out of my mind since I left home; and I reflect now that except from Emerson alone I never got much but <hi rend="italic">boring</hi> from any soul of them; that Emerson himself seems half in danger of melting into one knows not what <foreign>deliquium</foreign>;&#x2014;that if America were to think of <hi rend="italic">me</hi> no more till Doomsday, it would &#x201C;probably be just as well.&#x201D; Go to the Macready women by all means, and comfort them about &#x201C;William.&#x201D; William is really a man of worth; might put many a higher man to shame in these days. May he find a <hi rend="italic">Bible,</hi> and read it!</p>
<p>We have got our old confusion of rain again after the thunder. All is wet and bleak, with a cold bleared wind even when the rain is done, and big ugly clouds sailing about in a sky of ominous paleness. Otherwise I had meant for Dumfries today, and Craigenputtoch; to have that off my hands. Tomorrow, as Wednesday, it seems, will not do for Dumfries: at any rate there is small probability of fair weather. Thursday, Friday and Saturday would still do for the expedition. You may rely on it, poor old Mary shall not be forgotten!&#x2014; Happily no M&#x2019;Kinnons (Hawick cousins) have arrived here tonight: the expectation now is that they will not come till they are asked, and we are gone. No news from Kirkcaldy; that affair is rapidly getting beyond the hog&#x2019;s-score.<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Beyond the limit or distance-line, beyond which every scoring shot must pass at curling.</note> I have written to Spedding that on Monday next I will either decide on coming and name my day, or else abandon the project. Time is rushing on,&#x2014;the time for sleeping is about done.</p>
<p>My dear wife, you are very sad;&#x2014;nor is it any wonder, busied as you are at <hi rend="italic">this</hi> time! My dear little Jeannie,&#x2014;ah me! We shall go to <hi rend="italic">them,</hi> they will not return to us.<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. 2 Sam. 12:23, referring to Grace Welsh.</note> That is the stern fact; stern yet most <pb id="pg-17-78" n="17:78"/>beneficient. What were it if we had to stay <hi rend="italic">here</hi> always! Forward, forward: the Eternity they dwell in is also dimly round <hi rend="italic">us</hi>. God is their Governor as ours.&#x2014;</p>
<p>I can write no more at present; it is past supper-time; it is bedtime, and this room is Jack&#x2019;s, not mine. I wish thee from my heart a blessing and good-night. Courage, my brave little woman; we have gone a long way together now, and rough road it was; and we will wander on together fearless to the end of it. I believe God Almighty is Just!

<p><salute>Dearest,&#x2014;</salute>We are arrived thus far on the way to Puttoch; in a hurried moment, with a pen that will hardly mark, let me announce it to thee. The day in spite of watery clouds promised to clear into brightness, and bright gleams are to be snatched at in Dumfriesshire weather. This day has kept its word. Riding, for most part silent, beside my ever-<foreign><hi rend="italic">clavering</hi></foreign> [-talking idly] companion, I have had the feeling of a kind of <hi rend="italic">cleanly</hi> day; beautifully clear without, and dignified within by thoughts sad but not ignoble. We went by Annan; did not unyoke the Gig there; sat and talked three quarters of an hour with poor old Nelson, whose business does not take a good shape; whose agitation, as natural, was great. Poor Ben: I hope something good, of which there still seemed a possibility, will yet come out of all this for him. At Gill we found poor Mary sick of the thing they call a <foreign><hi rend="italic">weed</hi></foreign> [puerperal fever]; poor creature she is brown as a berry, worn to tatters with incessant hard work: we left her still in bed but better than when we arrived.</p>
<p>Among my sad thoughts was one that I ought to call for poor old Duncan of Ruthwell. Five and twenty years ago I used to know his Manse well, and he was one of the earliest friends I had; he is now old, a Non-Intrusion &#x201C;martyr,&#x201D; about to quit said Manse: in spite of John I decided that we ought to call. Admire my firmness of purpose, I pray thee! We found the old Manse, much <hi rend="italic">bushier</hi> than twenty years <pb id="pg-17-79" n="17:79"/>before; the old Dr somewhat barer;&#x2014;just in the act of flitting towards &#x201C;Kedar&#x2019;s vale&#x201D;;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-17/lt-18430816-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1843-08-16">16 Aug.</date></ref> Henry Duncan had been minister at Ruthwell since <date when="1799-00-00">1799</date>.</note> a new Wife was there, a stern grey woman (a professed admirer of mine):<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mary Duncan, b. Grey (d. <date when="1877-00-00">1877</date>), widow of the Rev. Robert Lundie of Kelso; m. <date when="1836-10-00">Oct. 1836</date>; author of several books, including a <hi rend="italic">Memoir</hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>) of her da. Mary (d. <date when="1840-00-00">1840</date>), who had m., <date when="1836-07-00">July 1836</date>, Henry and Agnes Duncan&#x2019;s son William Wallace.</note> we sat down among the wreck, and talked half an hour not unpleasantly: I was right glad that I had gone. I shall be in that room probably no more: how many that I knew there are already gone out of it; Mitchell, the kind first Mrs. D. &#x26;c &#x26;c!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Mitchell (ca. <date when="1795-00-00">1795</date>&#x2013;<date when="1836-00-00">1836</date>), schoolmaster; see <ref target="volume-01/lt-18140430-TC-RM-01"><sic>1:6</sic><corr>TC to RM, <date when="1814-04-30">30 April 1814</date></corr></ref>.

It was in that room that the dying Burns looked out upon the setting Sun, and said, &#x201C;Let me see him yet a little while.&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On <date when="1796-07-15">15 July 1796</date>, during the week preceding his death, Burns visited Ruthwell Manse. Agnes, da. of Duncan&#x2019;s predecessor, John Craig (d. <date when="1798-00-00">1798</date>), and of Burns&#x2019;s hostess, Barbara Craig, seeing his weakness, rose to let down the window blinds so as to block out the bright sun. Burns said: &#x201C;Thank you, my dear, for your kind attention; but oh, let him shine; he will not shine long for me&#x201D; (Robert Chambers and William Wallace, eds., <hi rend="italic">Life and Works of Robert Burns</hi> [Edinburgh, <date when="1896-00-00">1896</date>] 4:283).</note>&#x2014; Drunken peasants, in considerable variety of figure and equipment, were the main phenomena after that,&#x2014;returning from market &#x201C;with the same relish.&#x201D; Stupid-looking peasants;&#x2014;and added to these the beautifullest sea of molten mountains far up as the Lothers far down as the Westmoreland Fells,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >I.e., from the Lowthers, a mountain range in S Lanarkshire and N Dumfriesshire to the Westmoreland hills.</note> for the Sun went down right ahead like a really glorious Light, and I sat looking in absolute silence at the death of one other Day, in this great Sum of Time,&#x2014;not without reflexions. Jean welcomed us in her choicest mood. Jack now writes at one side of a table, I at the other; and a modicum of porridge will be ready before long.</p>
<p>Nobody dare promise much of weather here: but I do intend not Craigenputtoch only, but the other place too if I can manage it.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thornhill.</note> Yes, Dearest, I see it will be a satisfaction to thee; and it can, with a certain effort, be done! It requires only to <hi rend="italic">resolve</hi> on swallowing these &#x201C;bitter herbs,&#x201D;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Exod. 12:8.</note> and they become endurable, nay they are often useful and blessed. At lowest, I have brought poor old Mary&#x2019;s money in my pocket. There <hi rend="italic">shall</hi> nothing practical be left unadjusted.&#x2014; On Saturday night; perhaps on Friday (tho&#x2019; not so likely) we are to be at Scotsbrig again.</p>
<p>When this will reach you I know not; probably on Friday morning. May it find my Goody well, and cheerfuller than last night! Nay <hi rend="italic">be</hi> <pb id="pg-17-80" n="17:80"/>sad, dear <foreign>Bairn</foreign>, if it must be so!&#x2014; Jean desires me to send her kindest salutations. Good night. <closer><salute>Thine Ever</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>Here are your bits of buttons, dearest,</salute> which I think will suit the taste of a philosopher&#x2014;better than metal princes-feathers&#x2014;as for the mother of pearl!&#x2014;the bare idea was enough to make one scream&#x2014;!&#x2014; When I said to Helen I must go to get some buttons for you she tossed her head with an air of triumph and remarked&#x2014; &#x201C;Well, its a mercy theres <hi rend="italic">one</hi> <pb id="pg-17-81" n="17:81"/>thing which the master fancies is to be got in <hi rend="small-caps">London</hi> better than in <hi rend="italic">the country</hi>&#x201D;&#x2014;a small mercy&#x2014;for which let us be duly grateful&#x2014;</p>
<p>I have absolutely <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> to tell you: I have not spoken with a single soul since Garnier was here on sunday night&#x2014; No&#x2014;the Macreadys I think were after him&#x2014;I am not sure&#x2014;these bug-investigations have entirely bothered my intellects&#x2014; Elizabeth <hi rend="italic">Pepoli</hi> sent a note asking me to come on Sunday evening to meet &#x201C;a young frenchman <hi rend="italic">said to be very clever</hi>&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> but &#x201C;terrible was the idea for me&#x201D;!&#x2014;so I excused myself and had an old german<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Garnier.</note> <hi rend="italic">said to be insane</hi> instead&#x2014; &#x201C;It comes all to the same ultimately&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Br<hi rend="italic">r</hi> John&#x2019;s constant phrase&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note).</note>&#x2014; I hope you will not pack your trunks all with new clothes to the exclusion of a small bag of <hi rend="italic">oatmeal</hi>&#x2014; I do devoutly long for some porridge again!&#x2014; I have had none all these two months that you have been away.</p>
<p>I had a note from John Sterling about a situation for Miss B&#xF6;lte&#x2014;(not feasable<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS; corrected by TC to &#x201C;feasible.&#x201D;</note>) in which he says &#x201C;Pray read <hi rend="italic">Strafford</hi> and tell me what you think of it&#x2014;the critic in the Examiner is a fool&#x2014;and a liar (!!!) to boot&#x2014; I do not wonder that you prefered fasting with me to dining with him.&#x201D; (alluding to my refusal to stay and dine with Forster one day that I was scampering about in cabs with John when he was here)&#x2014; Strong words <hi rend="italic">fool</hi> and <hi rend="italic">liar</hi>&#x2014;because a man can not swallow ones legitimate drammar!</p>
<p>Poor little Jeannie<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;At Liv<hi rend="italic">r</hi>pool&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note).</note> has been worse bothered than I am, and does not look as if she were going to get away to Helensboro&#x2019; at all&#x2014;first she had to change her cook&#x2014;and then the housemaid with whom she thought she could safely trust the new cook&#x2014;having had <hi rend="italic">some month or two&#x2019;s</hi> experience of her&#x2014;turns out to be &#x201C;a deception&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;no better than she should be&#x201D;&#x2014;has intrigues with <hi rend="italic">gentlemen</hi>&#x2014;the Liverpool servants have all intrigues with gentlemen<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;The L<hi rend="italic">r</hi>pool Servants always have intrigues with gent<hi rend="italic">n</hi>&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note).</note>&#x2014;when they have them at all&#x2014;which seems to say less for the gentlemen than the maids I think&#x2014;</p>
<p>It has rained pretty continually ever since I ordered all the feather beds and pillows out into the green to get aired&#x2014;they go out and then have all to retreat into the lobby&#x2014;where they lie appealing to posterity&#x2014; You perceive that I am utterly stupid in fact I am very tired&#x2014;I am writing at night in case I do not find time tomorrow&#x2014;</p><lb/>
<dateline>Thursday morning [<date when="1843-08-24">24 August</date>]</dateline>
<p>It was well I wrote last night better or worse&#x2014;for tho I was up at seven <pb id="pg-17-82" n="17:82"/>I should not have had time today&#x2014;first my stockings proved to be in holes and that was not supportable&#x2014;it was ten before I got them properly mended&#x2014;then I fell to <hi rend="italic">painting</hi> the wardrobe in the china closet&#x2014;which had a badd effect&#x2014;and while I was in the midst of that, came the letters&#x2014;not yours only but another brace from the Bullers in answer to my answer&#x2014; I thought if they would make a conditional arrangement with Miss Bolte it might be useful to the poor girl in her present bedevilled position&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; She could stay with them perhaps for their salary of 60&#xa3;&#x2014;some six months and then <hi rend="italic">they</hi> would be applied to for her character and would have no calumny to state about &#x201C;the first chaps of Genesis&#x201D;&#x2014;and they would agree perhaps to her leaving them during that term should a better situation turn up. &#x2014;They seem extremely bent on the thing and instruct me to arrange it all with her on these terms if I can.
So I must now write all the ins and outs to little B&#xF6;lte who is perishing of <foreign>ennui</foreign> in the house of some stupid country parson&#x2014;where she writes to me also this very day, complaining of her dismal prospects. Certainly to goodness I have &#x201C;unconsciously&#x201D; opened a bureau for destitute young women!&#x2014;I am trying for another situation for B&#xF6;lte abroad, that is to say with a Lady travelling abroad&#x2014;but that dawdles so on account of the distance and slow posts<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Poor B&#xF6;lte <hi rend="italic">went</hi> on those terms, to Nice &#x26;c; but, as usual, made a mess of it there;&#x2014;ultimately fell ill of nervous fever; was carried back by Lady Harriet Baring (Ashburton), and started anew here on her precarious adventures,&#x2014;saving clergy a little money if nothing more&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note).</note>&#x2014;</p>
<p>Now however I have painted out the press as <hi rend="italic">that</hi> could not be left in the midst without being ruined&#x2014;and must procede to write to B&#xF6;lte and to the Bullers&#x2014; I have also a letter from Juliet Mudie this morning expressing herself extremely contented with <hi rend="italic">her</hi> place and stating her sister to be equally blessed&#x2014;</p>
<p>And so goodby to you dearest&#x2014; You perceive that I do <hi rend="italic">not</hi> weary at all rates since I have never so much as time to write legeibly</p>

<salute>Dearest,</salute>
<p>You must take a hurried word from <supplied>[me]</supplied><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> at this hour and place, or Monday too will be a blank with you. It was impossible to catch any post yesterday, and today, if I put off till Scotsbrig will also be a failure. I am far out of ease for writing; but do it as I may.</p>
<p>We got up to Craigenputtoch thro&#x2019; the bright hot autumn weather; paused at Carstammon,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Nr. Craigenputtoch, home of Peter Austin, brother of TC&#x2019;s brother-in-law, James.</note> appointing the people there to cook us a set of mutton-chops Jean had tied up for our dinner;&#x2014;the drive had been far enough from joyful, yet full of meaning and emotion for me. The last time I had gone that road was in setting off for London in <date when="1834-00-00">1834</date>. The place lay all there, the road covered with people faring towards some Non-Intrusion Preaching at &#x201C;the Martyrs&#x2019; Sacramental Stones,&#x201D; by Candlish up among the Hills;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Smith Candlish (<date when="1806-00-00">1806</date>&#x2013;<date when="1873-00-00">73</date>; <ref target="volume-17/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/4547"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), theologian; one of the Free Church leaders; see <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390607-TC-AG-01"><sic>11:122</sic><corr>TC to AG, <date when="1839-06-07">7 June 1839</date></corr></ref>. He gave &#x201C;an eloquent and impressive sermon&#x201D; to ca. 200 people, Thurs., <date when="1843-08-24">24 Aug.</date> (<hi rend="italic">Dumfries Courier</hi>, <date when="1843-08-28">28 Aug.</date>). The &#x201C;Martyrs&#x2019; Stones&#x201D; were on Skeoch Hill in Kirkpatrick-Irongray parish, where the Rev. John Welsh (<date when="1624-00-00">1624</date>?&#x2013;<date when="1681-00-00">81</date>), deprived of his parish by the restoration of the episcopacy, <date when="1661-00-00">1661</date>, was one of the militant presbyterian field preachers who gave communion to 3,000 covenanters on the hillside in <date when="1678-00-00">1678</date>.</note> the place was there not much changed, but the traveller thro&#x2019; it was altered somewhat!&#x2014; We got along to Puttoch with Glen,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Glen (<date when="1803-00-00">1803</date>&#x2013;<date when="1852-00-00">52</date>), who was insane and lived with Peter Austin; see <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310824-TC-JWC-01"><sic>5:364</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1831-08-24">24 Aug. 1831</date></corr></ref>.</note> who is madder than ever, blethering about <hi rend="italic">out</hi> and <hi rend="italic">in</hi>,&#x2014;singularly <hi rend="italic">like</hi>, in his effects on me, to the <hi rend="italic">usual</hi> style of speakers in this world, all or nearly all blethering as poor G. does without clear belief, sincerity or significance, from the teeth outwards!
Macadam&#x2019;s farming was <hi rend="italic">dirty</hi> as ever, nearly unexampled in dirt; I did not see the ass himself, nor want to see him. Corson&#x2019;s house was in much better order, some <hi rend="italic">Gig</hi>man now inheriting the greater part of it with his guns: the roofs had been repaired according to order, the windows were hung again; a piece of the tin spout blown off, which I made arrangements for having instantly replaced.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >M&#x2019;Adam was the tenant farmer at Craigenputtoch. Corson, who rented the house, was one of the Corson family of Nether Craigenputtoch; see <ref target="volume-14/lt-18420321-TC-JWC-01"><sic>14:77</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1842-03-21">21 March 1842</date></corr></ref> for TC&#x2019;s previous comments.</note> Poor Corson, he stands by the <hi rend="italic">Intrusion</hi> side of the Kirk, and has lost certain of <pb id="pg-17-84" n="17:84"/>his audience: a man of <hi rend="italic">bounded</hi> prospects! The woodman had done the trees all well, except the planting close by the house: all there was a luxuriant thicket; I hired a man to thin it under Corson&#x2019;s eye: the shrubs we planted are grown high branchy trees; all is an impervious wood in front of Macadam&#x2019;s house now. I left the place <hi rend="italic">willingly</hi>. Carstammon willingly too; tho Peter was really civil, and all the people shewed a sort of kindness. I had for you many compliments and so forth from all and sundry: none more affecting to me than poor Glen&#x2019;s who seemed to feel that they were sent from the centre of the abysses and not worth receiving. He spoke repeatedly about your beauty; and inquired with interest, How you looked now? As for him being a poor degraded &#x201C;out,&#x201D; he did not deserve to look other than ugly. Poor Glen!</p>
<p>We went over the Hill by <hi rend="italic">Shangan</hi><note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Or Drumshangan, 4 mi. E of Craigenputtoch.</note> (a road you and I once came, and once only) into Glencairn, and across by the bonny glen of Shinnel &#x26; Penpont into Thornhill. My Dearest, I was there; but you must not send me back again: it was one of the painfullest expeditions I ever made in the world! We found the Russells at home in the quiet twilight; most prompt to receive us, and every way kind: we slept (or tried to sleep) and put the horse up at M&#x2019;Kinnell&#x2019;s Inn,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Inn, High St., Thornhill.</note> and spent almost all our other time with these good people. They are really good; Russell himself is a shrewd hardy man with more humanity than he wears on his sleeve; the old Dobbie and Mrs Russel pleased me better than ever. They seemed to have but one room, and so consented with only the right reluctance to let us lodge elsewhere. Tea supper and breakfast we had in their house.</p>
<p>Mary Mill&#x2019;s money was not done; your Uncle had sent some lately: Mrs Russell produced her &#x201C;Mary&#x2019;s purse&#x201D; with two unbroken pounds in it; and a book in which the whole of the fractions were duly jotted. I declined to let her sum the thing, taking her reiterated assurance that the &#x201C;&#xa3;2 and more&#x201D; were still Mary&#x2019;s; and adding three sovereigns to extend it to this time twelve month. They assured me the poor old creature was as well as she could be made in that way; that more money per week would not do her more good. On the morrow morning I went and called for Margaret Hiddlestone; found her all neat, in a neat little room, of her father-in-law&#x2019;s house: cheerful, affectionate, the extreme of order of poverty and humble welldoing. Her two girls are at Wallace Hall School:<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Wallace Hall School is nr. Closeburn, ca. 3 mi. SSE of Thornhill; see <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390805-TC-TA-01"><sic>11:164</sic><corr>TC to TA, <date when="1839-08-05">5 Aug. 1839</date></corr></ref>.</note> &#x201C;it had cost her many a sleepless night,&#x201D; that <pb id="pg-17-85" n="17:85"/>of <hi rend="italic">going</hi> to live with us at Chelsea; but she could <hi rend="italic">not</hi> leave the youngest <foreign><hi rend="italic">bairn</hi></foreign>.<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For the fruitless negotiation over Margaret Hiddlestone&#x2019;s coming to Chelsea, see <ref target="volume-15/lt-18421215-JWC-MR-01"><sic>15:231</sic><corr>JWC to MR, <date when="1842-12-15">15 Dec.</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-15/lt-18421228-JWC-JW-01"><sic>255</sic><corr>JWC to JW, <date when="1842-12-28">28 Dec. 1842</date></corr></ref>.</note> The eldest lassie herself (twelve years old now) wanted much to go to you. I left Margaret half a crown each &#x201C;for a <foreign>fairing</foreign> [gift] to her two lasses,&#x201D; and went away amid many expressions of a sufficiently &#x201C;grateful&#x201D; nature! Margaret is poor, but not indigent; a really well-doing estimable woman. I also saw Wull Fingland (Russell&#x2019;s lad),<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-14/lt-18420412-TC-JWC-01"><sic>14:144</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1842-04-12">12 April 1842</date></corr></ref>.</note> and gave him half a crown with a kind word. Lastly I went, and after one failure did the second time find old Mary. She is looking better than her wont, poor old creature; was overjoyed to see me; went off into endless clatter of the old innocent sort. Shall I tell my poor Jeannie one thing? Yes I will; for tho&#x2019; sad it is affecting,&#x2014;like the <hi rend="italic">speech</hi> of the dumb.
Poor old Mary made a journey to Crawford last autumn! She entered into endless details about this journey when I hinted at it; of her going with the carrier, of getting a bed &#x26;c &#x26;c: at last she said, &#x201C;and we went to the place, and read the grave stone, and made it a&#x2019; out but <foreign>ae</foreign> [one] word, the last word; it was very bonny,&#x201D; she added in a lower tone, and then burst into tears,&#x2014;as my poor little <foreign>Bairn</foreign> herself now does. As a hardhearted stranger might, at that moment. I left the poor creature with a new assurance that she should not be left to want while I lived; and putting a trifle of money into her old hard hand, hastily took my leave. There was now nothing more to do but get away out of so mournful a place, where the obligation to speak at all was growing insupportable to me. I will do whatsoever my poor little Wife desires as to all that; but do not bid me go there again, if it can be helped!</p>
<p>We got down to Dumfries before the rain, which had preceded us, and which soon followed us. Today as you know we go home by Gillenbie.<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >They did not go; See <ref target="volume-17/lt-18430827-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1843-08-27">27 Aug.</date></ref></note> I have had bad sleep, bad living; I am out of sorts a great way; in pressing desire to get into some haven, which I shall not find. There are Letters at Ecclefechan; arrangements were made to have them brought up here this morning, but by the stupidity of men that has all gone awry; we shall find them tonight as we pass. I have many things to do here, and to settle; finishing all off, as I hope: I wish we were fairly home! In fact I wish I were at Chelsea again: I do not feel lightly disposed for any more rambling at all; I cannot bear to be tumbled about in this way. No heat now to hurt me in London; I really must get off thither.</p>
<p>Macready&#x2019;s Letter is not forgotten, only postponed till tomorrow.

<salute>Dear Forster,</salute>
<p>Here is a Letter waiting me from a Mr Leitch;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dated <date when="1843-08-24">24 Aug.</date> from 62 Gt. Russell St., from John Leitch, saying: &#x201C;I have nearly completed a translation of C. O. M&#xfc;ller&#x2019;s &#x2018;Prolegomena zu einer Wissen Schaftlichen Mythologie,&#x2019; and as Chapman and Hall have already published several translations from the German I mean to offer them mine. Nickisson has suggested to me that a letter from you to Mr. Fo<supplied>[r]</supplied>ster would be of great service, and I shall therefore feel obliged if you would give me a few lines to him. I have considerable diffidence in asking this favor of you, as I had only the honor of a slight acquaintance with you, and I daresay you may have nearly forgotten me, as I have long been absent from London. In case you may not have read M&#xfc;ller&#x2019;s book I inclose copy of a letter from your friend Sir W<hi rend="italic">m</hi> Hamilton; in which he expresses a very favorable opinion of its merits.&#x201D; Leitch&#x2019;s trans. of the work by the German classical philologist and archaeologist Karl Otfried M&#xfc;ller (<date when="1797-00-00">1797</date>&#x2013;<date when="1840-00-00">1840</date>) was pbd. by Longman, Brown, Green, and Longmans as <hi rend="italic">Introduction to a Scientific System of Mythology</hi> (<date when="1844-00-00">1844</date>) and dedicated to Edmund Lushington (see below). In the pref. Leitch thanked Sir William Hamilton (<date when="1788-00-00">1788</date>&#x2013;<date when="1856-00-00">1856</date>; <ref target="volume-17/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/12144"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>) for examining some of his trans. in MS.

(<date when="1859-00-00">1859</date>&#x2013;<date when="1868-00-00">68</date>), was suggested by F. D. Maurice (whose lectures on ecclesiastical history he had attended at King&#x2019;s College, London). John Leitch is not further identified.</note> of whom ransack my poor memory as I may I cannot find the slightest vestige, either in this or any prior state of existence! What in these singular circumstances is to be done?&#x2014; Pray read his Letter nevertheless; pray look at him with humanity when he presents my card: examine his credentials and proposals with gentleness tempering caution,&#x2014;for I do certify that Nickisson speaks of him as an actually extant man not unknown to me, that Sir W<hi rend="italic">m</hi> Hamilton&#x2019;s and Glasgow Lushington&#x2019;s<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edmund Law Lushington (<date when="1811-00-00">1811</date>&#x2013;<date when="1893-00-00">93</date>; <ref target="volume-17/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/17210"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>); B.A., Trinity College, Cambridge, <date when="1832-00-00">1832</date>; prof. of Greek at Glasgow, <date when="1833-00-00">1833</date>&#x2013;<date when="1875-00-00">75</date>; friend of FitzGerald, James Spedding, and Tennyson, whose sister he m., <date when="1842-00-00">1842</date>, and whose wedding is celebrated in the epilogue to <hi rend="italic">In Memoriam</hi>.</note> testimonials are <pb id="pg-17-87" n="17:87"/>those of competent men; and that&#x2014;on the whole you ought to let Chapman &#x26; Hall have a look at him in that state of matters!</p>
<p>He cannot be Leitch <hi rend="italic">Ritchie?</hi> O Mnemosyne!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Leitch Ritchie (<date when="1800-00-00">1800</date>?&#x2013;<date when="1865-00-00">65</date>; <ref target="volume-17/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/23678"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), popular novelist and journalist.

<p>My wayfarings hitherward have been of chequered character, with as many rests intervening as I could effect, with as much of <hi rend="italic">silence</hi> as was possible for me. I begin to long for Chelsea again; and know not whether I can undertake &#x201C;to return by Edinburgh&#x201D; or not. Returning whatever way, I hope to see you again before long, and hear good news of the whole world from you. Let that be enough.</p>
<p>Getting home to my Mother&#x2019;s here last night, I found some <hi rend="italic">twelve</hi> Letters, all about as momentous as this of Ritchie Leitch&#x2019;s; all requiring some answer or other. May the Devil confound it!</p>
<p>I add not another word at present; except to bid you call at Chelsea for my Wife as you ride past, and to prosper and be of good cheer always.</p>

<p><salute><hi rend="small-caps">Dear Emerson</hi>,&#x2014;</salute>The bearer of this is Mr. Macready, our celebrated Actor, now on a journey to America, who wishes to know you. In the pauses of a feverish occupation which he strives honestly to make a noble one, this Artist, become once more a man, would like well to meet here and there a true American man. He loves Heroes as few do; and can recognize them, you will find, whether they have on the <hi rend="italic">Cothurnus</hi> or not. I recommend him to you; bid you forward him as you have opportunity, in this department of his pilgrimage.</p>
<p>Mr. Macready&#x2019;s deserts to the English Drama are notable here to all the world; but his dignified, generous, and every-way honorable deportment in private life is known fully, I believe, only to a few friends. I have often said, looking at him as a manager of great London theatres, &#x201C;This Man, presiding over the unstablest, most chaotic province of English things, is the one public man among us who has dared to take his stand on what he understood to be <hi rend="italic">the truth</hi>, and <pb id="pg-17-88" n="17:88"/>expect victory from that: he puts to shame our Bishops and Archbishops.&#x201D; It is literally so.</p>

<salute>Dear Mr Macready,</salute>
<p>Here are two Letters,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >To Emerson and John Greig; see two preceding letters <corr>[<ref target="volume-17/lt-18430827-TC-RWE-01">TC to RWE<sic/><corr>, <date when="1843-08-27">27 Aug.</date></corr></ref>; <ref target="volume-17/lt-18430827-TC-JG-01">TC to JG, <corr><date when="1843-08-27">27 Aug.</date></corr></ref>]</corr></note> to the only two men I can at present fish out of my memory as much worth seeing among my American set, and not likely to be better accessible to you otherwise. Indeed my Americans generally belong, alas, alas, to the species Bore, or even Bore with Emphasis; and I can recommend no man to them nor them to any man!</p>
<p>Emerson&#x2019;s place<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Concord, Mass. In Boston, Macready noted, <date when="1843-11-16">16 Nov.</date>: &#x201C;Waldo Emerson called, and sat with me a short time. &#x2026; I liked him very, very much&#x2014;the simplicity and kindness of his manner charmed me&#x201D; (W. Toynbee, <hi rend="italic">Diaries</hi> [<date when="1912-00-00">1912</date>] 2:236).</note> is some sixteen miles from Boston. He is a man of small but competent fortune; of truly notable faculty and worth, one of the clearest, shrewdest, most simple-hearted and friendly of men,&#x2014;in quiet but invincible opposition, as I conjecture, to the whole current of American things. There is no man in that Country so well worth seeing, that I have heard of.</p>
<p>Greig is an Annandale Scotchman, very intimate with my Wife&#x2019;s people in old days, and by frequent visits to this country still keeping up his old relations. His place<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Canandaigua, N.Y.</note> is towards Buffalo in the N. W. part of New York State: he is now a man of great wealth, great influence and business; lives in a stately mansion, &#x201C;like a Castle&#x201D; the Yankees say, and exercises &#x201C;princely hospitality.&#x201D; He is an excellent &#x201C;old Scotchman&#x201D; (if <pb id="pg-17-89" n="17:89"/>you know what that is); in face and figure of head, bears a noticeable resemblance to Sir Walter Scott; neither good sense, good humour, nor good breeding, nor good will is likely to be in defect there! When about Niagara it may be worth while to call.&#x2014;</p>
<p>Perhaps I shall still see you before you go?<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Macready sailed from Liverpool, <date when="1843-09-05">5 Sept.</date>, and TC did not arrive back in London till <date when="1843-09-15">15 Sept.</date></note> Within three weeks, within ten days more probably, I expect to be in London. At any rate I will say now as then, May a right prosperous voyage await you, in all ways,&#x2014;and the <hi rend="italic">speediest</hi> return compatible with that! Speedy; for we cannot altogether want you!&#x2014; <foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Mr Macready.</p>

<salute>My Dearest,</salute>
<p>Last night we got hither, as anticipated: we did not go by Gillenbie, the day proving wet; we only drove round by Lockerby, and left there a written apology, indicating withal a <foreign><hi rend="italic">velleity</hi></foreign> to have drunk tea at least had the weather altered;&#x2014;such was Jack&#x2019;s scheme, which had become almost a fixed-idea with him; to which, as he had managed the negociation, I for <hi rend="italic">silence</hi> sake willingly acceded! Poor old Lochmaben lay stagnant as of old; the big-bellied clouds sailing over it in the bleared sky; certain parties practising in the chief Loch for a &#x201C;Dumfries &#x26; Lochmaben regatta&#x201D; that is coming.
Lockerby was full of <foreign><hi rend="italic">glar</hi></foreign> [mud]; the people whom we met wore mostly an air of sulky embarrassment.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lochmaben is 10 mi. NE of Dumfries and ca. 3 mi. from Lockerbie. The apology was presumably left for James Stewart of Gillenbie Rig Farm, ca. 4 mi. NE.</note> An open Cab of very humble character, with two horses, and a postilion all in <hi rend="italic">duds</hi> and waving with a high grey head (very curious to see), shewed us at Milk-Bridge two dismissed Members of Parliament,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Queen prorogued parliament, <date when="1843-08-24">24 Aug.</date> Milkbridge is ca. 2 mi. S of Lockerbie.</note> such we supposed them to be, posting home; I, smoking my long pipe at the moment, was an object of extreme interest to them, as it seemed! Such visions flit across this Earth. Finally at Ecclefechan not without difficulty we procured a pocketful of Letters; and two from my dear Goody were still decipherable to me. The buttons are of the most exquisite quality! The Tailor is to come on Monday evening, and <pb id="pg-17-90" n="17:90"/>sew them on; and take another waistcoat over with him which he has to make for me. Thanks for the buttons, for the Letters, for all things, my Goody! The plan for B&#xF6;lte is sagacity itself; really a neat plea for getting rid of that atrocious Genesis affair;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-17/lt-18430808-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1843-08-08">8 Aug.</date></ref>, and <ref target="volume-17/lt-18430823-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1843-08-23">23 Aug.</date>]</ref>.</note> truly glad am I that it is like to take effect. You say nothing of Mrs. Buller&#x2019;s journey this time; or of her turning blue?</p>
<p>On arriving here we discovered not without a momentary alarm that the two M&#x2019;Kinnows<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Or McKinnon. Marion was the cousin who was ill.</note> had arrived! Two trim handy Roxburghshire lasses; one of them coughing considerably, poor young creature,&#x2014;one fears not in a very good way. She is her Mother over again with a change of eyes from bright black to bright grey. Tibbie, I rem<supplied>[em]</supplied>ber<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letters omitted.</note> &#x201C;Aunt Tibbie&#x201D; from very early days: she died, after many sufferings, last year. My poor Mother, at sight of this lassie at the door, had &#x201C;burst into <foreign><hi rend="italic">greeting</hi></foreign> [weeping]&#x201D;: Time the All-devourer! The lassie herself, both the lassies <foreign>grat</foreign> [wept],&#x2014;their Mother&#x2019;s counterpart risen there on them out of foreign space. Ah me.&#x2014; They are good sensible girls these; nor was a feasible arrangement for the hour difficult to fall upon. A fire was kindled in the east room for John and me; a stricter division of apartments enforced; and so we shall do for a day no worse than before. The rather as Jack talks of going off to Liverpool &#x201C;tomorrow&#x201D;! He has no work to do there, or none that could not easily be done by Letter: but on the whole what work has he anywhere? I never in my life have seen a rational man hanging as completely like a leaf in the wind. A kind of thought strikes me at moments that he still has a sort of half lingering eye to little Jeannie:<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Welsh.</note> I declare if he do not mend immensely I could not advise the little Cousin that way. She is far too good for what he is;&#x2014;unless perhaps she could make him what he might be? Be silent, silent as a stone!&#x2014; I do not dissuade him from going; he is a real distress in this quarter. I too shall shortly have to go.</p>
<p>But whitherward? Aye, look; there are certain of my last night&#x2019;s &#x201C;pocketful&#x201D; of Letters; and all this blessed day I have been answering others of them,&#x2014;and have already written above a dozen: to Macready with Emerson &#x26; Greig, to Haddington Brown,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Samuel Brown (<date when="1817-00-00">1817</date>&#x2013;<date when="1856-00-00">56</date>; <ref target="volume-17/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/3649"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), chemist; b. Haddington; M.D., Edinburgh, <date when="1839-00-00">1839</date>; devoted to proving the atomic composition of bodies. Presumably he had asked TC for support for his candidacy for the chair of chemistry at Edinburgh, to be decided in <date when="1843-09-00">Sept.</date> He was supported by Thomas Chalmers, Prof. Robert Christison and others. The Town Council, the chair&#x2019;s patrons, postponed their decision to give him time to verify the experiments on which his candidacy rested; See <ref target="volume-17/lt-18440309-TC-SB-01">TC to SB, <date when="1844-03-09">9 March 1844</date></ref>.</note> to &#x26;c &#x26;c (the
Devil <pb id="pg-17-91" n="17:91"/>confound them all)&#x2014;and Spedding and Fergus are still to answer (nay the <hi rend="italic">decision</hi> has yet to be taken on them), and they must be answered tomorrow. My mind rather points to Fife; but the details are very dim, the weather doubtful: tomorrow I am <hi rend="italic">bound</hi> to decide. All this day Jack has been off with my Mother at Gill, where Mary is still unwell: They have <hi rend="italic">arrived</hi> within the last five minutes, and report her better. They bring also a Letter from Fitzgerald, with a new scheme about Naseby! <foreign>Eheu</foreign>; I shall have to <hi rend="italic">unsay</hi> my half promise of meeting <hi rend="italic">him</hi> there?</p>
<p>Dearest, in a word, I think I should be best of all at home now? Now that the house is swept, the &#x201C;<foreign>bogues</foreign>&#x201D; all dead, and my own little Goody still so kind and lively. There are worse Goodies I do believe! Well I wish I saw her again the little gypsey. <closer><salute>God bless thee, Dearest /</salute></closer> <name>T. C.</name></p>

<p>Did Mrs Russel say any thing about not having answered my last <pb id="pg-17-95" n="17:95"/>letter&#x2014; I sent a little shawl on my last birthday to Margaret to M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> R&#x2019;s care and a pound of tea&#x2014;that is; <hi rend="italic">money</hi> for it to old Mary in a letter to M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Russel<note n="22" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-16/lt-18430712-JWC-MR-01">JWC to MR, [<date when="1843-07-12">12 July</date>]</ref>.</note> and as I have never heard a word from Thornhill since, I have sometimes feared the things had been taken by the way&#x2014;it is very stupid in people not to give one the satisfaction of writing on these little occasions&#x2014;</p>
<p>Not to fall into the same error let me duly commemorate the arrival of M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Adamsons letter containing the money order<note n="23" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably the money referred to in <ref target="volume-17/lt-18430828-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1843-08-28">28 Aug.</date></ref>; possibly the rent for Craigenputtoch, from Robert Adamson as its factor (see <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380214-TC-JA-01"><sic>10:23</sic><corr>TC to JA, <date when="1838-02-14">14 Feb. 1838</date></corr></ref>).</note>&#x2014;which I have laid in a safe place&#x2014;</p>

<salute>My dear Spedding,</salute>
<p>The Fates are against us. I have got myself wetted, wearied, entirely dispirited among the Galloway moors; the rain still alternates with mere Scotch mist: I feel unequal to any kind of travelling that is not flatly indispensable. My Brother is off to Lancashire, towards London, this morning: for me it seems likeliest that I may try to sleep here with all diligence till Saturday afternoon,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >He is writing on Mon.</note> and then have myself wheeled into the Liverpool Steamer at Annan, and so forwarded by Birmingham and the utmost velocity of human mechanism,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >By rail.</note> home to Chelsea again,&#x2014;there to repent of my sins, and turn over a new leaf if it be possible!</p>
<p>Truly it grieves me to come to this conclusion; but there is at present no help. Next time I come hitherward, I must take you <hi rend="italic">first</hi>, before ever seeing Scotland: that will perhaps answer better. At present I am a totally unprofitable servant;&#x2014;full of vain regrets that man, that at least one man, is not a Spirit, able to travel like his own Thoughts: but lodged in a beggarly body, unfit for travelling at all.</p>
<p><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Spedding. May the Highest Power, for whom there is at present no <hi rend="small-caps">Name</hi> but a canting ghost of a name, watch over you in very fact forevermore! <closer><salute>I commend myself with true affection and many regrets and wishes to you all.</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Fitzgerald,</salute>
<p>If I go by Liverpool and the Railway at all, it will be directly after getting across the Solway waters <hi rend="italic">on the night of Saturday first;</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Meaning the next Sat., <date when="1843-09-02">2 Sept.</date> FitzGerald wrote on Sat. morning, <date when="1843-09-02">2 Sept.</date>, on his way to Liverpool, assuming TC would go to Dunbar and then London: &#x201C;I shall not wait to catch a glimpse of you at Liverpool, but step out of this boat upon the railroad, and so to Naseby. I leave it entirely to your pleasure when and how you follow me there: only repeating that I shall be very glad to see you.&#x201D; He wrote again, <date when="1843-09-09">9 Sept.</date>, that &#x201C;you must not feel bound to do so because we have agitated it so long&#x201D; (Terhune, <hi rend="italic">LEF</hi> 1:397, 399).</note> that is to say, on the morning of Sunday (3<hi rend="italic"><hi rend="superscript">d</hi></hi> of <date when="1843-09-00">September</date>) I shall be in Liverpool, and disposed to start with the delay of hardly more than two days or one day. But it is not now certain that I shall go by Liverpool; for if so I lose Dunbar, whitherward as well as to Edinburgh and Fife (if the weather and my spirits would but brighten) I have a kind of call, a kind of possibility. My route homeward in that case would be, perhaps a week later, by an Edinburgh or Dundee Steamer. How to appoint in this uncertainty,&#x2014;uncertain as Murphy&#x2019;s Almanack!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Patrick Murphy (<date when="1782-00-00">1782</date>&#x2013;<date when="1847-00-00">1847</date>; <ref target="volume-17/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/19583"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>) created a sensation when his <hi rend="italic">Weather Almanack</hi> (<hi rend="italic">on Scientific Principles, showing the State of Weather for every Day of the Year <date when="1838-00-00">1838</date></hi>) accurately predicted <date when="1838-01-20">20 Jan. 1838</date> to be &#x201C;Fair, prob. lowest deg. of winter temp.&#x201D; Many of his other predictions for <date when="1838-00-00">1838</date> and for later years were wrong, and confidence in him waned.</note></p>
<p>The best way will be that you do not thwart, hurry or cramp yourself in any of your Irish movements, nor I in any of my Scotch: this in the first place. Secondly, that when you do get spontaneously to Naseby, and feel in readiness, you signify the fact to me, by a Note, which, if posted on or before the third of <date when="1843-09-00">September</date>, should be addressed: &#x201C;Care of John Welsh Esq 20. Maryland Street, Liverpool&#x201D;;&#x2014;not posted until after that date, &#x201C;Chelsea.&#x201D; From Chelsea, or at Chelsea, it will find me; and the due steps, whatever they are, can then be taken. This straightens the thing a little, in spite of Murphy?</p>
<p>Francis Edgeworth when I knew him was a walking lexicon; books, and books only. Yet I can fancy him doing good service as a country gentleman, even as a judge of fat oxen. There is obstinacy enough in the man; yet another element too in singular antagonism to that.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Francis Beaufort Edgeworth (<date when="1809-00-00">1809</date>&#x2013;<date when="1846-00-00">46</date>), half-brother of the novelist Maria Edgeworth (<sic><date when="1767-00-00">1767</date></sic><corr><date when="1768-00-00">1768</date></corr>&#x2013;<date when="1849-00-00">1849</date>; <ref target="volume-17/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/8476"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>); see <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380205-TC-JWI-01"><sic>10:22&#x2013;23</sic><corr>TC to JWI, <date when="1838-02-05">5 Feb. 1838</date></corr></ref>. He and FitzGerald had been at Trinity together, and FitzGerald visited him for a week from <date when="1843-08-19">19 Aug.</date> at Edgeworthstown, Longford co., where he apparently managed his half-brother&#x2019;s estates. FitzGerald described him to Frederick Tennyson, <date when="1843-08-31">31 Aug.</date>: &#x201C;He farms, and is a justice: and goes to sleep on the sofa of evenings. At odd moments he looks into Spinoza and Petrarch. People respect him very much in those parts&#x201D; (Terhune, <hi rend="italic">LEF</hi> 1:396).</note> Poor <pb id="pg-17-98" n="17:98"/>Miss Edgeworth! One would so fain say to such a light, Burn thou forever; but it cannot be. Nature must be very opulent: she snuffs out her Suns with equal indifference as her farthing candles, and goes on her way.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Maria Edgeworth had been seriously ill earlier in the year and had not fully recovered. &#x201C;Old Miss Edgeworth is wearing away,&#x201D; FitzGerald wrote, <date when="1843-08-31">31 Aug.</date>; &#x201C;she has a capital bright soul which even now shines quite youthfully through her faded carcase&#x201D; (Terhune, <hi rend="italic">LEF</hi> 1:396).</note></p>
<p>One is right glad to hear you say of Ireland that you know and see it to be quiet.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >FitzGerald had told TC in <date when="1843-07-00">mid-July</date>: &#x201C;As to Repeal, etc., one hears more about it in England. The word is faintly chalked on one or two walls in Dublin, to the exclusion perhaps of lighter topics. People seem rather amused at the soldiers and ammunition that are seen occasionally upon the dreary roads hereabout.&#x201D; To R. M. Milnes he wrote, <date when="1843-08-09">9 Aug.</date>: &#x201C;I heard Dan O&#x2019;Connell two days ago. &#x2026; Judging by that meeting, I should say that the papers had much exaggerated, if not the numbers, the enthusiasm, of the folks assembled on such occasions. The people seemed to me too starved to be capable of much action, or even of much cheering&#x201D; (Terhune, <hi rend="italic">LEF</hi> 1:392, 393).</note> The Irish will begin to get their thousandfold grievances redressed the instant they attain a right <hi rend="italic">patient</hi> impatience<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">As You Like It</hi> 5.2.</note> with them,&#x2014;never till that; and they have wanted it from the beginning hitherto.</p>
<p>If I had known you were going to Edgeworth&#x2019;s I would have sent my remembrances with you. I have now nothing more to say except in Irish phraseology:</p>
<p>&#x201C;Come out of that!&#x201D;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Mark 5:8, also <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310121-TC-JAC-01"><sic>5:215</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1831-01-21">21 Jan. 1831</date></corr></ref>.</note></p>

<p><salute>The smallest of Notes, my little Dear,</salute> will suffice thee today; for indeed there is nothing to be said since yesterday, or hardly anything.</p>
<p>Jack went away this morning shortly after six: I had shifted beforehand into the other (what I call the eastern) room; and did not see him, tho&#x2019; I heard the sound of him. He will be in Liverpool about an hour hence if he have prospered. Arbuckle is to sail for Pernambuco<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Seaport (now called Recife) and a state on E coast of Brazil; see also <ref target="volume-08/lt-18351006-TC-JWC-01"><sic>8:218</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1835-10-06">6 Oct. 1835</date></corr></ref>. John Carlyle wrote to James Carlyle, <date when="1844-03-08">8 March 1844</date>, that Arbuckle &#x201C;who gave Alick the books &#x26; maps for America &#x2026; got into a very good practice at Pernambuco&#x201D; (MS: NLS 9086).</note> <pb id="pg-17-99" n="17:99"/>on Wednesday; Jack&#x2019;s sole errand that I could see was to accommodate poor Arbuckle, who is disappointed of remittances, with a loan to enable him to embark. This of course is a secret. I approved of the loan; and indeed should have felt impelled, had I been the party admitted into confidence, to have advanced it to him myself. He has laid out all his money, not in schemes of his own, but in setting up his poor brother and sisters who had no other resources. He has in those Equinoctial Countries a fair chance of doing well.&#x2014; Jack&#x2019;s program did not extend beyond Liverpool; but it is likeliest he will before long move towards London &#x201C;to seek lodgings.&#x201D; It would not surprise me if he went over to the Paulets, and staid a few days with them, should they ask him. He was very sorry at going away; everybody was sorry, yet could not help feeling it as a relief. He is very unhappy, and will require to be more so before a resolution is possible for him, which is the only remedy possible. His good nature too has very considerably diminished. One&#x2019;s best resource with him is reserve. If you lodge him aloft, and give him breakfast patiently, he will not trouble you much till I come, should he get thither before me.</p>
<p>I have this <supplied>[day]</supplied><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> <hi rend="italic">declined</hi> Spedding. The weather is all broken into mud again; I am much out of sleep; have no heart for Speddingdom. Fergus I have not yet answered: if the weather brightened up, I should have a considerable temptation towards Dunbar,&#x2014;and of course Dunbar would include many things in that quarter. One can get from Dumfries to Kirkcaldy in a day. Before tomorrow night I shall require to decide about that too. Fitzgerald, whose Letter is here, has been directed to arrive at Naseby when he likes, and then straightway to tell me that he has arrived. If before <hi rend="italic">Saturday first</hi>, it is to be directed to Maryland Street. For, in fine, failing Kircaldy<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> and all things, it is not unlikely I may in despair throw myself into the Annan Steamer of that evening (much as I hate it), and coming home to my bed at Chelsea. You I daresay are the quietest at this season! By Kirkcaldy I should have to linger for a week longer. Our poor Cousins are no annoyance to me here:<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The McKinnons.</note> in fact I see almost nothing of them; sitting (with a fire today) in my own private apartment!</p>
<p>You will receive perhaps along with this a Banker&#x2019;s Letter for Sixty Pounds.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >It had already arrived; See <ref target="volume-17/lt-18430827-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1843-08-27">27 Aug.</date></ref>].</note> You are to lock it up in a safe place, and never <foreign>fash</foreign> [worry] <pb id="pg-17-100" n="17:100"/>your little thumb till I return; the cash will not be due for three weeks yet.</p>
<p>Was there not something more to say? Nothing; except that if I had Goody here I would&#x2014;give her a good beating, I think! She is the <hi rend="italic">worst</hi> wife ever a poor Author in my circumstances was tried with; a most unrestful, bug-destroying, house-painting, destructive Goody; whom, if I had her here, I would&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;! <closer><salute>Blessings on thee, poor lassie &#x201C;after all.&#x201D;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340805-TC-MAC-01"><sic>7:258</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1834-08-05">5 Aug. 1834</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014;</salute></closer> <name>T.

<p><salute>Dearest,&#x2014;</salute>It is all right: Mazzini&#x2019;s revolution has burnt priming; my Goody is well,&#x2014;and has got a new sofa for nothing!</p>
<p>The Tailor&#x2019;s Boy bringing over my <hi rend="italic">last</hi> new waistcoat yesternight duly brought your Letter along with it; and I read. There was not time to write by him; nay the thing to be written was not yet matured <hi rend="italic">till today&#x2019;s weather</hi> disclosed itself. In all locomotive projects here you must compute the horoscope of wet and dry. These two days are again bright and beautiful as new silver; <hi rend="italic">three</hi> days of dry are always a considerable sign of more: I decided some time yesterday that on the morning of the third fair day (which will be tomorrow now, if it prove fair, as there is at present good prospect of its doing), I should accept that as the best assurance there was of continued fair weather, and take Dunbar Battlefield with me before I came home. If on the other hand tomorrow prove wet, the omens are against me; I will stick where I am till, on Saturday afternoon,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >He is writing on Wed.</note> they can tumble me into the first Liverpool Steamer, and thence home direct by the swiftest method. A terrible pleading went on within me to have <hi rend="italic">this</hi> settled as the best method at once; the easiest and pleasantest (with Goody at the end of it) none could deny it to be: but at bottom I detected in the heart of all objections to the other these two, as the grand substance of the whole: Laziness and Pusillanimity;&#x2014;to whom, as was fit, I at last resolved to give no heed. I wrote last night to Fergus, leaving the matter open; but a probability still in it. Indeed he, I think, will only come in for a day or two in any case; I can linger nowhere now; and Dunbar and the <hi rend="italic">South</hi> shore of the Forth hold all the <hi rend="italic">business</hi> I have to do thereabouts. Tomorrow <pb id="pg-17-101" n="17:101"/> morning, if it do prove dry, I will write to Miss Donaldson;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jean, eldest of the sisters at Haddington.</note> the same day I must get across to Dumfries; then on friday morning off by the Mail to Edinburgh, and if possible (I think it will be still possible) out to Haddington that night. Haddington&#x2014; O my dear little <foreign>Bairn</foreign>! The next day I can devote to Dunbar; scan it at full leisure (<hi rend="italic">alone</hi> will be best); and return at least to Haddington that evening. <hi rend="italic">If</hi> the weather do keep up! A curious feature of the business will, in that case, be that I see the Battlefield on the very Anniversary of the Battle; the third of <date when="0000-09-00">September</date>, namely, Oliver&#x2019;s grand day, ultimately his death-day:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The battle at Dunbar and Cromwell&#x2019;s death were on <date when="1650-09-03">3 Sept. 1650</date> and <date when="1658-09-03">1658</date>.</note> this without any forethought;&#x2014;is not this too an omen? Finally, this morning, having awoke for perhaps the tenth morning <hi rend="italic">hours</hi> too early, tho&#x2019; with a distinct feeling of improved health too, I decided&#x2014;ye immortals do but think of it!&#x2014;decided on a desperate drench of <hi rend="italic">castor</hi> which I had to mix with coffee with my own hand! The last, mixed by others, was a futility, melancholy to think of;&#x2014;but this is none! I believe the old Egyptians were quite right to begin their year as <hi rend="italic">they</hi> did: hast thou, a poor innocent Goody, any notion how? Not the least. But the price of <hi rend="italic">senna</hi> rose always at that season; and the sanity of mankind felt itself increased.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Egyptian year is called vague because it began sometimes at one season, sometimes at another.</note></p>
<p>If therefore, O Goody, there come not contradiction by the Postman 24 hours after he leaves this, that is to say as I compute on Friday night about tea-time,&#x2014;nay if possible there shall come confirmation then,&#x2014;thou art to fancy me gone off as I say: at Dumfries while thou readest <hi rend="italic">this;</hi> at or near Haddington on the subsequent evening. And if on Saturday there be a Letter duly despatched&#x2014;whither shall it direct itself? &#x201C;Post-Office Edinburgh&#x201D;: there will be nothing else so safe: but I will give precision of direction tomorrow. I wait only for weather here; and then bolt. If tomorrow do break down again, it will be rather provoking, such a mass of heroic resolution all wasted;&#x2014;yet how easily shall I console myself! If you wrote off to Miss Donaldson a line for herself on the friday, it <hi rend="italic">might</hi> arrive while I was there? But no; do not bother yourself. I will stand by the Edinburgh Post-Office whether or not,&#x2014;if tomorrow do not dash the whole thing.</p>
<p>Jack must be at Liverpool; extremely in want of a resolution for the morrow, I guess; Arbuckle sails today, and then there will again rise, What to do? Today I will apprise him that in me is no sure hope. He is <pb id="pg-17-102" n="17:102"/>likeliest to come off then towards London: but perhaps will not go, if he find good quarters anywhere, till towards the time of my arrival. He ought to be helped in &#x201C;seeking a lodging&#x201D;: it is the first foundation-stone of all benefit for him.</p>
<p>Let me not forget: Mrs Russell and both Margaret and Mary did repeatedly report or express &#x201C;thanks, thanks&#x201D; for Mrs Carlyle&#x2019;s kind gifts.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC had criticized Mrs. Russell for not acknowledging them; see <ref target="volume-17/lt-18430827-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1843-08-27">27 Aug.</date>]</ref>.</note> I did not know there would be any newness in them to you. Mrs Russel did not speak apologetically about Letters, nor indeed at all about them; but the &#x201C;Thanks&#x201D; rose everywhere, so there is no mistake. Poor Margaret was decided to come and &#x201C;meet you at Annan,&#x201D; if you came into this quarter. She told me Mrs Russell gave poor old Mary a jug of milk every day.&#x2014; I must tell you another thing I heard there, which struck me considerably. You remember a lump of an old woman, half-<foreign>haveril</foreign> [idiot] half-genius, called Jenny Fraser? &#x201C;The Duke&#x201D; had decided on high that not an inch of ground for a Non-Intrusion Church should be allowed in that region; no Church shall there or thereabouts be.
It is paltry to stop the <hi rend="italic">mouths</hi> of men that observe any measure in their complainings; very poor,&#x2014;even if a Duke had <hi rend="italic">made</hi> all the land he refuses to concede a few square yards of. Well; but old Jenny Fraser possesses about Boatford a patch of ground, independent of all persons, just about equal to holding a church and its eaves-drops; and says, <hi rend="italic">she</hi> will give it! Hunter of Morton-Mill<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Hunter; see <ref target="volume-14/lt-18420305-TC-JWC-01"><sic>14:58</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1842-03-05">5 March 1842</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-14/lt-18420310-TC-JWC-01"><sic>66</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1842-03-10">10 March 1842</date></corr></ref>.</note> and Agents are at work; go to Jenny, offer her &#xa3;10, &#xa3;20, indicate possibilities perhaps of more: Jenny is deaf as whinstone, tho&#x2019; poor nearly as Job; she answers always: &#x201C;I got it from the Lord and I will give it to the Lord&#x201D;;&#x2014;and there the Free Kirk it seems in spite of Duke and Devil is to be!<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The duke of Buccleuch owned almost all Penpont parish. Janet Douglas Fraser, a weaver, bequeathed her freehold to the new congregation of six neighboring parishes, which was meeting in the open air. The deed said: &#x201C;This deed of gift is to be as free from henceforth to the Free Church of Scotland as I wish the Heavenly Mansions to be made to me, and to last the property of the Free Church while sun, moon and stars endure&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Annals of the Free Church</hi>, ed. W. Ewing [Edinburgh, <date when="1914-00-00">1914</date>] 2:47). Boatford, though not traced, was probably a local name for the bank of Scaur Water on the edge of Penpont village, 2 mi. WSW of Thornhill.</note> I had a month&#x2019;s mind to go and give Jenny a sovereign myself; but I remembered two things, First that she had for some reason or other become a <hi rend="italic">stranger</hi> to her former Benefactress;<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably Grace Welsh.</note> and then secondly that it might have a factious look, better to avoid at that moment. We can do it better afterwards; and I shall hear your opinion withal. &#x201C;Duke <hi rend="italic">versus</hi> <pb id="pg-17-103" n="17:103"/>Jenny Fraser&#x201D;: it is as ridiculous a conjunction as has happened lately These poor people, living under their Duke, in secret spleen and sham-loyalty are somewhat to be pitied. &#x201C;The Earth&#x2019;s the Lords and no the Duke&#x2019;s,&#x201D; as Charlie Rae<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charles Rae, poet and songwriter; see <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340211-TC-MAC-01"><sic>7:96</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1834-02-11">11 Feb. 1834</date></corr></ref>.</note> said!</p>
<p>But I waste time, and have none to waste. Expect tomorrow evening a Letter or even <hi rend="italic">no letter;</hi>&#x2014;but I will try to put in a word as we pass Ecclefechan.</p>
<p><foreign>Adieu</foreign> Dearest, <foreign>adieu</foreign>. It will be about a week longer before I see thee; but please Heaven, it shall not be long. I think there are worse Goodies to go home to? Yes!&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>

<p>The weather is not rainy, nor perhaps like to rain, tho&#x2019; to my eyes it looks dimmish;&#x2014;in my pusillanimity I could almost have prayed that it had been otherwise! However, Forward is now the word; in terms of the agreement we must off. Jamie goes with me to Dumfries, thro&#x2019; the grey windless day. I have written to Miss Donaldson, to John Gordon. Write thou on Saturday, &#x201C;Post-Office Edinburgh.&#x201D; I think I shall probably run on direct to Haddington tomorrow night.&#x2014; John, it seems by his letter to me, will be with you tonight.

<p>She answered me by return of post&#x2014;very sensibly&#x2014;that the salary would be dreadfully counter balanced by the tender years and multitude of the children&#x2014;that she feared the <hi rend="italic">tone</hi> of the house would not suit her&#x2014;and that having been in the family of an <hi rend="italic">Actor</hi> might be &#x201C;a terminus&#x201D; to her carreer as Governess&#x2014; <hi rend="italic">I</hi> however, she thought, knowing them personally and knowing how far the english prejudice against actors extended was better able to decide for her than herself was&#x2014;and so she ended by bidding me &#x201C;take her fate into my own hands and send her where I thought she would be best&#x201D;&#x2014;I decided at once as I would have done had it been for <hi rend="italic">myself</hi>&#x2014;that she should adhere to the Bullers&#x2014;and an hour after having received her letter yesterday forenoon I had written to M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Buller that she would be ready for her on the <date when="1843-10-01">1<hi rend="italic">st</hi> of October</date> and to M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Macready that for the present she declined taking charge of such young children&#x2014; And at five when I was complaisantly reflecting that <hi rend="italic">there</hi> was another piece of business fairly wound up&#x2014;comes another note from Bolte&#x2014;apparently quite reconciled to the Macready situation by merely having slept upon it&#x2014;and asking, would it suit me to have her, and them to see her on Sunday?<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC enclosed the letter of [<date when="1843-08-30">30 Aug.</date>]: &#x201C;After having dreamt of you the whole night, I have got so much out of my poor brains, that I would come on Saturday&#x2014;being holiday for my idle pupils&#x2014;by the five o&#x2019;clock train to Town &#x26; return on Sunday &#x2026; if this day would suit M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Macready for <hi rend="italic">sounding me</hi>, &#x26; his Lady for giving me an opportunity to look at her house &#x26; her children. &#x2026; If therefore my <hi rend="italic">only objection</hi> is an erroneous one, I must make the money a compensation for all other little drawbacks I find everywhere, and try it. &#x2026; You are a dear angel to trouble yourself with all the calamities of Eve about the poor German Sceptic, who is playing <foreign>en attendant</foreign> the role of a perfect saint. &#x2026; A line from you will tell me if I have to come or not, or what to do.&#x201D;</note> I wrote her a long letter before going to bed&#x2014;telling her that as she had empowered me to act for her I had done so with decision and promptitude that she might not fall down between two stones&#x2014;and that now she was to go to the Bullers and no more about it&#x2014; But I must off to my Staircarpets Helen you know cannot drive a nail tho&#x2019; it were to save her soul alive&#x2014; I sent on a letter from Alick (?) to John <pb id="pg-17-106" n="17:106"/>yesterday which I rather felt tempted to break open&#x2014;kindest regards to all&#x2014; Poor Mary her illness lasts long&#x2014;and she can so ill afford to be sick&#x2014;</p>

<salute>My Dearest,</salute>
<p>I am here safe in John Gordon&#x2019;s; just preparing to get out to Haddington: as the London Posts there (which go now by Carlisle, some tell me) are a little uncertain, I must despatch this word to you where I am that you may have something on Monday without fail. I too shall find something at the Post-Office here; shall I not? You see what ink I have; what paper and pen; and I have already written three Notes, and my time is fast going!</p>
<p>As the Mail was to start from Dumfries at six o&#x2019;clock without pause by the way, and there seemed no great convenience in Jean&#x2019;s for a getting up of breakfast so early, and I myself had had enough of sleep, I preferred the heavy Coach yesterday at 9; Aird and the rest warmly recommending it. It took me by Thornhill &#x26;c! I had not duly calculated on that. And yet who knows but a day of such sad solemnity spent in utter silence, tho&#x2019; painful exceedingly, was <hi rend="italic">worth</hi> enduring. Nobody knew me; I sat two minutes on Thornhill street, unsuspected by all men; a kind of ghost among men. The day was windless, the earth all still. Grey mist rested on the tops of the green hills, the vacant brown moors; <hi rend="italic">silence</hi> as of Eternity rested over the world. It was all like a journey thro&#x2019; the Kingdoms of the Dead; one Hall of Spirits till I got past Crawford. At Glenochar a man stood waiting for a newspaper; the driver called him &#x201C;Mr Hunter&#x201D;; I looked, he was redhaired, large-nosed, the rustic counterpart of poor Adam Hunter,&#x2014;his Brother.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Adam Hunter d. <date when="1843-06-22">22 June</date>, Brompton, Mddx. His obituary in the <hi rend="italic">Dumfries Courier</hi>, <date when="1843-07-17">17 July</date>, says that as well as having been physician to the Gen. Infirmary, House of Recovery (Fever Hospital) and public dispensary at Leeds, he had also been the lecturer on the practice of physic at the School of Medicine; that he was author of <hi rend="italic">Mineral Waters of Harrogate</hi> and had been a founder and supporter of the Leeds Philosophical &#x26; Literary Society and the Mechanics&#x2019; Inst. The Hunters were grandsons of Thomas Hunter of Tynron, Upper Nithsdale. Adam&#x2019;s brother was possibly John Hunter, co-schoolmaster of the parochial school, Durisdeer. Glenochar is unlocated.</note> John Blackley<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Farmer of Drumcruil, Durisdeer, nr. Thornhill.</note> stood speaking within a yard of me at the Inn door in <pb id="pg-17-108" n="17:108"/>Thornhill; I was as a spirit, in the land of spirits, called land of the living.</p>
<p>At Crawford, Dearest,&#x2014;I was on a <hi rend="italic">sacred</hi> spot; one of the two <hi rend="italic">sacredest</hi> in all the world: I was at Her Grave! I tried first to gain as much time on the Coach; this being impossible the goodnatured Driver offered to wait. In my life I have had no more unearthly moment. Perhaps it was not right,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; doubtless you will thank me: at any rate, I could not decide to pass. O Heavens,&#x2014;and all is so silent there; smoothed into the repose of <hi rend="italic">God&#x2019;s</hi> Eternity: and the hills look on it and the skies;&#x2014;and I thought How blessed all <hi rend="italic">that</hi> was beyond the dreary sorrows and agitations of all <hi rend="italic">this</hi>. Why should I dwell on such a matter?&#x2014; I mean to go and see your brave Father&#x2019;s Grave too;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In St. Mary&#x2019;s Abbey, Haddington.</note> and I will speak no word about it; you shall hold it for done without my speaking.&#x2014; If in your Letter of tomorrow, you indicate where Betty lives I will try to call for her here;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Betty Braid, JWC&#x2019;s old nurse, in Edinburgh.</note> but after that I shall perhaps not have it in my power.</p>
<p>Kindness itself could be no kinder than Gordon: he had failed once at the <hi rend="italic">Mail</hi> whither I appointed him, and had come out to try again at the other Coach,&#x2014;in time to rescue me from the Boots of the Waterloo H&#xF4;tel.

<salute>My Dearest,</salute>
<p>Tho&#x2019; I have little time or composure for writing you a Letter this morning, I must nevertheless put pen to paper while there is any opportunity at all: a line with the date this has will have meaning enough for you.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Meaning &#x201C;Haddington&#x201D; in the dateline. Her father d. at Haddington, <date when="1819-09-19">19 Sept. 1819</date>.</note> These two days the image of my dear little Jeannie has hovered incessantly about me, waking and sleeping; in a sad, yet almost celestial manner; like the spirit, I might say, of a beautiful Dream. These were the streets and places where she ran about, a merry eager little fairy of a child;&#x2014;and it is all gone away from her now, and she from it; and of all her possessions poor I am, as it were, all that remain to her! My Dearest, while I live, one soul to trust in shall not be wanting. My poor little Jeannie, how solemn is is<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in text. TC also writes &#x201C;prophecit&#x201D; subsequently.</note> this <hi rend="italic">Hall of the Past;</hi> beautiful and mournful; the miraculous River of Existence rolling its grand course here, as elsewhere in the most prophecit places; now ever as of old: godlike tho&#x2019; dark with death.&#x2014; I will <hi rend="italic">speak</hi> no more of all that.</p>
<p>On Saturday afternoon, tho&#x2019; not till late, I did get out hither; at 7 o&#x2019;clock the three good women sat waiting me at tea; Kate ran out to the lawn to welcome me; Miss Donaldson and Jessy (is that the name?) were at their post within. I have really done very well with them; and got all my bits of enterprises finished in a satisfactory manner. The weather has been and still is rainless; I slept tolerably well, in the stillest of all apartments; and feel readier now, not less ready, for the remainder of my expedition. No Coaches going to Dunbar on Sunday, I had to resolve on doing the thing by walking. Before quitting Edinburgh I had gone to David Laing and refreshed all my recollections by looking at his Books,&#x2014;one of which he even lent me out hither. Fortified with all studies and other furtherances I took a stick from the lobby here, and set forth about half past nine, the morning grey and windy, wind straight in my back. To Linton the walk was delightful; the rich autumn country and sabbath solitude altogether solacing to me: at Linton a shoal or rather endless shoals of ragged Irish reapers <pb id="pg-17-110" n="17:110"/>made the highway thenceforth far too populous for me.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >East Linton, midway between Dunbar and Haddington, which are 11 mi. apart.</note> Indeed between Mussellburgh and Dunbar, with the above exception, they have made all thoroughfares a continued Donnybrook;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >I.e., Irish and riotous; see <ref target="volume-15/lt-18421121-TC-JOST-01"><sic>15:198</sic><corr>TC to JOST, <date when="1842-11-21">21 Nov. 1842</date></corr></ref>.

There is not work for the fourth part of them; wages one shilling aday. They seemed to subsist on the plunder of turnips and bean-fields, they did not beg; only asked me now and then for the &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">taime</hi> plaise Sur?&#x201D; seeing I had a watch. It was curious to see at Linton the poor remnant of Highland Shearers all lying decently at rest in rows on the green, while the Irish were hovering they knew not wither, without plan, without repose. Other bodies of them in the evening met me all the way as I returned, and still others are visible today.

Broxmouth (spelled Brocksmouth in <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi>), was then in the possession of Sir William Drummond Ker (d. <date when="1675-00-00">1675</date>), 2d earl of Roxburghe; the dukedom came into the family in <date when="1707-00-00">1707</date>.</note> I had the conviction that I stood on the very ground.&#x2014; Having time to spare (for dinner was at six) I surveyed the old castle,<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The ruins at the N end of the High St.</note> washed my feet in the sea (smoking the while), took an image of Dunbar with me as I could; and then set my face to the wind and the <foreign><hi rend="italic">stour</hi></foreign> [storm], which had by this time risen to a quite tempestuous pitch. No rougher walk have I had for a long time; boring thro&#x2019; it with my broadbrim set <hi rend="italic">perpendicular</hi> to it, face <hi rend="italic">parallel</hi> to the highway; that was the only possible method, except sometimes that I set the broadbrim on my breast and walked bare-headed, the only ill effect of which is that it has filled my hair with sand; till the sea-water wash it out again. I got home in good time; drank half a bottle of Prestonpans<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Small town 8 mi.

A <pb id="pg-17-111" n="17:111"/>Coach is to take me off soon after noon; I shall be in Kirkcaldy about seven at night as they are warned to expect, if all go well with me.</p>
<p>I shall find thy Letter at the Post-Office; shall I not? Write again with all velosity to Kirkcaldy. I look to Saturday as the day of my Steamer; I understand it is the Dundee Steamer&#x2019;s day also: I have written to Erskine; if he be at Linlathen,<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >His home nr.

<p><salute>Goody Dearest,</salute> what on earth has become of thee? It is a full week since I heard a word; and surely I myself have written with exemplary diligence! I made myself cock-sure of a Letter at Edinburgh on Monday; in fact, walked in quite as if I had it: there was none. &#x201C;Are you sure?&#x201D; None, Sir!&#x2014; And here today again the Mondays Post has arrived, and not a line from Jeannie. Do, write, wilt thou! Nay I am not without hope of an Edinburgh Letter after all; for I have sent again to inquire by the Kirkcaldy Carrier, and he is to return this afternoon at four o&#x2019;clock. You got the Haddington Letter written on Monday?</p>
<p>Since that date various disappointments, small mischances more in number than during all my journey, have befallen me. No Letter from Goody; Portmanteau at Gordon&#x2019;s irrecoverable as my Omnibus passed, the servant being out and the house dead: <hi rend="italic">item</hi>, hole burnt in the skirt of my Coat by a cigar <hi rend="italic"><foreign>fusee</foreign>; item</hi> misdirected into the <hi rend="italic">Dysart</hi> Steamer in place of the Kirkcaldy one; <hi rend="italic">item</hi> &#x26;c &#x26;c! Nay yesterday worst of all going out to ride and call for Cousin Walter,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Welsh, in Auchtertool, 4 mi. W of Kirkcaldy. Dysart is 2 mi. NE of Kirkcaldy.</note> I found Cousin Walter and even his Landlady clean gone; I thereupon rode round by the Coast, the beautifullest or nearly so in all the world, and there on perfectly flat road at perfectly moderate pace, the horse fell with me,&#x2014;peeled its own knees, and bruised me on the ancle, elbow &#x26;c (nothing to speak of)! I will ride no more on <hi rend="italic">it</hi>. Happily I am no worse at all, only stiffish a little; I am to drive off with Fergus in ten minutes to Lesslie<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Leslie, 9 mi. NW of Kirkcaldy, nr. where Fergus had his bleaching and flax-spinning works; see <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380826-TC-JWC-01"><sic>10:155</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1838-08-26">26 Aug. 1838</date></corr></ref>.</note> the weather being beautiful.</p>
<p>O Dearest I wish to Heaven I were beside thee! But it will not be many days now. I think of Saturday sometimes; but fear I must take in Erskine too, and then it cannot be till this day week that I get off. <pb id="pg-17-113" n="17:113"/>I do not think of going over to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> again, except it quite suit, and then only for one day. I will write tomorrow to say <hi rend="italic">what</hi> I specially determine on.</p>
<p>Incidentally I hear that Jack and you were calling for Elizabeth;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Pepoli, John Fergus&#x2019;s sister.</note> I try to convince myself that if anything were wrong I should hear of it thro&#x2019; that channel.&#x2014; We have visitors here, a Yorkshire Mr &#x26; Miss Ellerton(?),<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> well enough; by no means charming to me. This house is full of wax-lights, down sofas, assiduous flunkies and other sumptuosities,&#x2014;considerably the most sumptuous house I have been in during these travels. The kind hospitalities of the people are beyond praise: but the flunkies, the formalities the late dinner; and I cannot <hi rend="italic">sleep!</hi></p>
<p><foreign>Adieu</foreign> Dearest; my time is up. If you <hi rend="italic">have</hi> written already do not write again till you hear tomorrow.</p>

<salute>Dear Mr Erskine,</salute>
<p>It shall be as you have said. I will go with you on Monday, and on Wednesday you shall send me home with your blessing.</p>
<p>Only this new circumstance is to be added: I too have to be over in Edinburgh, for which purpose either tomorrow or Saturday will suit; and the good Mr Fergus and his Sisters have long been ambitious of knowing you. Such being the state of matters they employ me to convey their cordial request that you would start on friday from home, and do them the honour of passing friday night in their house: on the morrow morning a carriage and boats at all hours for Edinburgh are at your service. I have of course held out no hope that you would comply (nor have I introduced any despair); I add only my hearty certificate that my Hosts here are people of peaceable elegant habits, of many good qualities, and that it will be a kind of epoch with them to see you under their roof.</p>
<p>Our Dundee-Mail for this day is past; but Mr Fergus conveys this in a parcel by the noon coach to Dundee, and there has one of his Correspondents instructed to forward it by express.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Erskine answered the same day to say that because he had to attend a funeral he could not come to Kirkcaldy on Fri., <date when="1843-09-08">8 Sept.</date>, but looked forward &#x201C;to Monday&#x2019;s meeting on the coach.&#x201D; He was sorry not to meet the Ferguses: &#x201C;I like to know the friends of my friends.&#x201D;</note></p>
<p>I am to be heard of in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> at 29. Claremont street, Mr Gordon&#x2019;s&#x2014;if on saturday, failing all this, there arose any chance of meeting. Failing everything I expect to find you in the Dundee Coach on Monday, and to get an outside place there, and fare along with you.</p>
<closer><salute>Yours ever truly /</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>You must have another word from me, for I doubt not you have sent, in your solitude, many an inquiring thought after me.</p>
<p>I got happily out to Haddington, was received in all kindness by the good people, and passed two nights there. I <hi rend="italic">walked</hi> out to Dunbar, <pb id="pg-17-118" n="17:118"/>eleven miles off, and back again; saw the very field of Battle, and understood far better than is usual in such cases how the thing had been. It was a most interesting walk; and would have been delightful, except that a high wind blew dust about me,&#x2014;and still more that the road, and indeed the face of the country, was covered with Irish Shearers, by the hundred and the thousand; such a ragged host as it was truly painful to look at. The corn (wheat mostly) was not all ripe; and if it had they seemed able to shear and even to eat it, they alone, in few days; I was told not the fourth part of them could get any work, and they were living on bean fields and turnip fields, at the back of stooks;&#x2014;the frightfullest squadron of <foreign>duddy</foreign> [ragged] scoundrels I ever in my life beheld. The crops seemed all beautiful there; but all the people were complaining. Wages of Shearers one shilling a day with victuals. I was right glad to get out of sight of them again.</p>
<p>At Edinburgh, in coming or in going I found various people whom I knew besides Gordon: Jeffrey is at Craigcrook (his Country-house there) and expects me out if I will go. But here at Kirkcaldy I am quieter while I can stop; I decide that I will make one day serve Edinburgh. I have not heard a word yet from Jane; that is the worst of my cares: but I persuade myself it is but the delay of posts; incidentally the Ferguses here heard from their Sister that&#x2014;&#x201C;Jane and Dr Carlyle&#x201D; had been calling for her. So I will fancy still it is all right.</p>
<p>Today on counting my shirts I find but <hi rend="italic">five</hi> instead of <hi rend="italic">six:</hi> I brought seven away from home, and voluntarily left one old one: I think there must be a new one lying dirty somewhere about Scotsbrig? If so, my name is on it; and you will send it with the meal:&#x2014;of course I should like to <hi rend="italic">hear</hi> whether it is there or not, whenever you write. If it be lost altogether we cannot help it.</p>
<p>Dear Mother, I have hardly a moment of time: but I must tell you still what my future motions are to be, and how I am to get home. Thomas Erskine from Dundee, who is passing this way, will take me up on Monday and carry me to his place near that town. On Wednesday he puts me into the Dundee Steamer, and I get home in five and forty hours,&#x2014;to dinner on Friday, if all go well. The Dundee Steamers are reported to be the <hi rend="italic">best</hi> of all; and I usually agree well with Steamers. I wish I were at home! But it will soon be, now. And then if I could do some work there; to justify my Mother for bringing me into the world, and for loving me so! Let us try, let us see.</p>
<p>I will write again before I leave Scotland. Did you send the news of me to Jean. It is strange how one is tossed about, and cannot find an hour for writing. This house is full of sumptuosities, of flunkies, and <pb id="pg-17-119" n="17:119"/>all sorts of superfluities: I excuse all for the people&#x2019;s real kindness and worth. I shall be quieter at &#x201C;Linlathen, Dundee,&#x201D; with Thomas Erskine.</p>
<p>Give my affection to Jamie, to Isabella; write a word to Chelsea next week, you or some of you. God&#x2019;s blessing be with you my dear good old Mother; I pray earnestly for good to be with you forever-more. If it please the Great God that made us&#x2014;Yes, He will do all things <hi rend="italic">well</hi>. <closer><salute>My heart&#x2019;s love with one and all of you.</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>O Goody, Goody!</salute> Not a word yet!The Carrier came home with my Portmanteau yesternight, and no Letter from the Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Post-Office; and today has brought me only a Note from Thomas Erskine. Art not thou a careless disobedient Goody? I wrote twice on the two last days of my stay at Scotsbrig; the second time not many minutes before departure; I wrote from Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> on Saturday, from Haddington on Monday; and still not a syllable of response. Art not thou a disobedient faithless goody? This morning I was getting really alarmed, tho&#x2019; not very prone to do so: but Fergus computed for me that there could be no answer to my Haddington letter till tomorrow morning; wherefore I pacify myself, and suppose merely that you did not like to risk the &#x201C;Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Post-Office&#x201D;; that being lazy you said, &#x201C;He has not given me precise enough instructions.&#x201D; Well, if I hear tomorrow, and all right&#x2014; &#x2014;But if I do <hi rend="italic">not?</hi></p>
<p>This morning Erskine&#x2019;s note, which you read here, has settled my plans. It is added only that I invite the good Saint Thomas to pass the friday night here; and go over to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> with him myself on the morrow: this I have done, and the Note is off by express; but I do not much think he will come. At all events I am to go northward with him at Noon on Monday, and then finally to embark at Dundee on Wednesday, and come home to my Goody and her new house and old heart as fast as the Steam can go! That is the arrangement. The Boat takes some 45 hours, arrives along with the Edinburgh one; some time in the day of Friday the Chelsea Steamer brings me up, and I dine with poor Goody, if it please the beneficent Powers. My long pilgrimage will then <pb id="pg-17-120" n="17:120"/>have ended,&#x2014;thank God. O Goody, Goody; I have seen many things; but a thing half as good as my Goody, my own Goody? Thou little wretch!</p>
<p>Yesterday our pilgrimage to Lesslie in the softest vehicle with two swift horses accomplished itself altogether handsomely. I saw an Infant School, ridiculous in the extreme; I saw green countries; bleaching women, spinning boys, hatchelling (<hi rend="italic">hackling</hi>) men;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The infant school may have been the Misses Fergus&#x2019; Initiatory Charity School, Kirkcaldy; see <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380826-TC-JWC-01"><sic>10:153</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1838-08-26">26 Aug. 1838</date></corr></ref>. The hackle (or heckle) was in instrument for dressing flax, seen at Fergus&#x2019;s business in Leslie.</note> and slept half an hour on three chairs,&#x2014;awakening with a start as I dreamt that the horse was falling with me! My three bruises, ancle, elbow, breast, were considerably improved on my return; today they are a stage better still, my last night&#x2019;s sleep having proved luckier,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; still capable of some amelioration. In fact the two first nights here, especially the second with a rattling window curtain and the flurry of my tumble, I slept somewhat wretchedly; and yesterday I did not deem it prudent to bathe, which might have helped me.
But I have now got my portmanteau, my pipes and equipments; today I begin to feel at home,&#x2014;had I but a Letter from Goody! As for these same bruises, trouble not thy head with them; they are totally insignificant; nearly gone in fact, if it be not the one on the breast-bone and throat, which is also fast going: the Stupid Quadruped (for it was the quadruped&#x2019;s main blame all of it) must have struck me there, I think with its head as it got up again. I sat on till my feet, and its nose, got fairly to the ground; it then heeled with me, and of course the lower ancle and elbow came to suffer. Fergus received the news with extreme propriety,&#x2014;the hurt on his pony&#x2019;s knees going for nothing, total nothing. Truly I am sorry that it fell in my hands; but that it has fairly fallen and disgraced itself, has perhaps saved another man from broken bones or neck, for undoubtedly it had been at the trade before: at least so Mrs Nixon says,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Another Fergus sister (d. <date when="1853-00-00">1853</date>), who had married an Irish navy capt. (who committed suicide) and had a son.</note> and I love to believe.</p>
<p>Today there lies close before us a drive to &#x201C;Mrs Royd&#x2019;s,&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jane Royd, another sister of John Fergus; see <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380906-TC-JWC-01"><sic>10:162</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1838-09-06">6 Sept. 1838</date></corr></ref>.</note> ten or a dozen miles off; Miss Jessie,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Fergus.</note> with some chance of John, my companion. Please the Pigs! I am to bathe, however, as I come back; to be set down; that is, on the cliffs south of this, and left to bathe. Till one o&#x2019;clock too I have solitude, and a big beautiful Library-room, fire blazing (tho&#x2019; the Sun also blazes), and writing materials and equipments <pb id="pg-17-121" n="17:121"/>all round me. Could one but <hi rend="italic">continue</hi> such a thing till one did get entirely sated of it! Six months or so.</p>
<p>I will write to Gordon that Saturday shall be my day in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, that he must have Dodds &#x26;c up at the scratch on that day. If my spirits serve, I may go and dine with the Duke; if not, not. I saw old Laing at Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> on the street;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Gordon, James Dodds, Francis Jeffrey, and David Laing.</note> his cordiality did not seem to me excessive; I shall go no more near him.

<salute>My dear Jean,</salute>
<p>You may think it strange that I have never yet found time to send the smallest notice of my fate since I left your kind sisterly house on Friday last, exactly a week ago. It has not been for the want of thinking of you: but the truth is, one&#x2019;s obstructions are m<supplied>[words obliterated]</supplied> I have been somewhat unusually out of order; an absurd brute of a horse <supplied>[t]</supplied>umbled down with <supplied>[me]</supplied> here on perfectly flat ground, the day after my arrival; and tho&#x2019; no bones were hurt or real injury done, I have been impeded in all my enterprises by a kind of feverish languor ever since. I am now nearly mended however;&#x2014;you are to <hi rend="italic">say</hi> nothing of it, for our Mother does not know, and <supplied>[need]</supplied> not for a month or two!&#x2014; Enough<supplied>[. I]</supplied> have literally <hi rend="italic">ten minutes</hi> left today, and will use them on your behalf.</p>
<p>Gordon, as you perhaps know, received me at Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> with open arms; was much astonished, and laughed heartily to hear that little Jane had grown large, and possessed a flock of little children!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jean Aitken herself, whom Gordon had met on her visit to Comely Bank, <date when="1827-12-00">Dec. 1827</date>&#x2013;<date when="1828-01-00">Jan. 1828</date>.</note> With Gordon I got more talk than I wanted, and less sleep: Next day I went out to Haddington, had the warmest welcome from the &#x201C;dear Donaldsons,&#x201D; good <supplied>[o]</supplied>ld dames reduced now to a narrow circle of three; on the following day I walked out to Dunbar: I found the battlefield agree well with my ideas of it or the descriptions I had got; much more recogniseable than such scenes usually are. The walk was silent, pious, beautiful; but the return was terribly obstructed by high wind and dust,&#x2014;still more perhaps by endless shoals of Irish Shearers covering the face of the world <supplied>[like]</supplied> locusts, and wandering restle<supplied>[ssly]</supplied></p>

<p>I passed thro&#x2019; Portobello, and repassed, on my Dunbar Expedition lately; but except vivid remembrance of you, and a sharp outlook for <pb id="pg-17-123" n="17:123"/>some <hi rend="italic">miracle</hi> in my favour on the streets, could not be said to have any intercourse with you on those occasions. Ever since, I have been quiet here, indeed somewhat unwell, and highly indisposed for travelling. On Wednesday I am to take the Steamer at Dundee, and have myself conveyed home. It will be among my regrets if I go without having seen you; and yet I fear there is now but small chance of it.</p>
<p>Tomorrow I am to be in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> for certain hours, 2 o&#x2019;clock p.m. and afterwards; my main station Mr Gordon&#x2019;s 29. Claremont Street, but subject to various uncertain excursions, and my time at all events extremely short: this fact I mention to you, as my all of possibilities; hardly hoping that it will yield fruit on such sudden warning.</p>
<p>Seeing you or not seeing, I shall heartily wish you all manner of true successes and prosperities; and leave your neighbourhood with many kind thoughts of you.</p>
<closer><salute>Yours with much sincerity</salute></closer>

<salute>Dearest,</salute>
<p>I am just arrived across the Frith<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Firth of Forth, from Kirkcaldy on the N.</note> about 1 o&#x2019;clock of the sultriest dusty <date when="1843-09-00">September</date> day; glad to have got into Gordon&#x2019;s cool drawing-room with a North exposure; and write to my Goody an account of the fact.</p>
<p>Your great thick Letter<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of [<date when="1843-09-06">6 Sept.</date>], apparently enclosing the letter of [<date when="1843-08-31">31 Aug.</date>].</note> did lie waiting me at breakfast yesterday; the welcomest of sights: thanks, Dear, and never mind all disappointments; the joy of relief from them makes amends for all. Indeed I myself was partly to blame: the Scotsbrig people were ordered, if anything came <hi rend="italic">after</hi> Sunday, to forward it to Chelsea. That is all right now.</p>
<p>Thomas Erskine could not come to our Fergusdom yesterday; had a friend&#x2019;s funeral to go to; wrote a polite excuse. I probably shall not see him till Monday at noon on the roof of the Coach in Kirkcaldy. I expect to be a shade happier with Erskine; but there will be no peace for me till I get on board the Steamer and fling myself out at full <pb id="pg-17-125" n="17:125"/>length with no obligation to speak a word to anybody,&#x2014;till I get home to my Own with obligation to hear her speak!</p>
<p>Dodds is to be here, and Brown this evening;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Samuel Brown.</note> I had written vaguely to Jeffrey; offering to come out if I could; but privately this morning I had made up my mind that I would breakfast with them tomorrow, and stay overnight here rather, beside my pipes and freedom; and now lo, since I began writing to thee, here is a Letter from the Duke precisely to that same tune. I will begin therefore by &#x201C;calling at Moray Place.&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >No. 24, Jeffrey&#x2019;s home in Edinburgh.</note> I mean to see poor Betty, our Aunts &#x26;c; nay there is no &#x201C;&#x26;c&#x201D; but Sam Aitken, whom I did already try without effect. I avoid all labour, as I do disease, at present.</p>
<p>There was still some hope of the &#x201C;Fife Cousin&#x201D; whom I had not forgot.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Walter Welsh.</note> If he come tomorrow to <hi rend="italic">preach</hi> at Auchtertoul, he will find a Note that I am still there to be dined with at Kirkcaldy on Sunday Ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi> and no longer: the good Fergus was to write him a Note to that effect this day. A more hospitable Landlord I have never in my life lodged with</p>
<p>Thanks for your news about Alick I shall long earnestly to see the Letter itself: I hope my Mother&#x2019;s too will yet turn up?</p>
<p>Yes, <hi rend="italic">be</hi> good, my Duckie, till I come! What can be more absurd than much of that you describe.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mainly John Carlyle&#x2019;s behavior.</note> But the way to do with it is to be doubly wise in face of it. My own patience with much of the phenomenon was as good as exhausted.</p>
<p>Will you write then, nay are you writing to Linlathen this day? It will be my last at present: but I myself will write again,&#x2014;probably the day after tomorrow.</p>

<salute>My Dearest,</salute>
<p>It is eight in the morning; I am all shaved, have smoked, and stand in complete readiness for breakfast here,&#x2014;which alas, I am told, is still an hour off: the flunkies woke me at seven or earlier,&#x2014;with a murrain to them. On mature consideration I decide that a line to Goody (for my writing materials are all here, thank Heaven) will be the plan for turning this melancholy hour into a partially joyful one. Alas, it seems too the Post is already gone: from Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> I partly promised to write yesterday, but it was not possible: poor Goody will be for a day disappointed, nay for two days, this Sheet not arriving till the evening of the second as I count. We cannot help it. We hope it may be the last either appointment or disappointment; the Ship that is to carry me rides in Dundee harbour, and tomorrow afternoon is the time!</p>
<p>Out of Gordon&#x2019;s at Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, so soon as I had sealed your letter on Saturday, I sallied forth to various quarters, the kind but awkward Gordon sticking to me everywhere like my shadow. We called first for the Aunts, whom G. also a little knew. Grace was there; the other two were out at Currie.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Village 6 mi. S of Edinburgh.</note> Grace is grown somewhat older, thinner of figure, rougher of skin; but is otherwise in spite of her sainthood entirely the old woman. Indeed her Sainthood shews itself to an unusual degree <hi rend="italic">recognisable</hi> as a mere gauze or form of evening and morning dress for the soul of woman, the soul remaining precisely as it was before the fashion came in. It was somewhat distressing to me; but in the way of pity not of anger. Poor Mrs George Welsh has had another sad economic loss, which indeed has now put her out of the reach of more, for now, it would appear, she has as good as nothing left.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Margaret, b. Kissock (<date when="1803-00-00">1803</date>&#x2013;<date when="1888-00-00">88</date>), widow of JWC&#x2019;s paternal uncle George (d. <date when="1835-00-00">1835</date>); see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350920-JWC-MW-01"><sic>8:204</sic><corr>JWC to MW, <date when="1835-09-20">20 Sept. 1835</date></corr></ref>. For her losses, see <ref target="volume-14/lt-18420708-JWC-MW-01"><sic>14:216&#x2013;17</sic><corr>JWC to MW, <date when="1842-07-08">8 July 1842</date></corr></ref>.</note> A Scoundrel of a neighbour farmer, whom George had appointed executor of his will, and who had become trustee of the money by consent of the other executors, turns out some time ago to have been drawing the money in large handfuls for his own uses; turns out to have nearly drawn it wholly; and now sits <hi rend="italic">bankrupt</hi>, insolvent in his place, with the liberty to the poor Widow to hang or banish him, but no capacity to yield any money more! Did you ever hear of such a thing among Heathen or even Christian men? Such a Scoundrel ought to be hanged; the world <pb id="pg-17-127" n="17:127"/>should see his carcase swinging, have assurance that such a hound is no longer ranked among <hi rend="italic">its</hi> population! Poor Mrs George is for the present out at Currie with her Sisters-in-law; eager as you may fancy to turn her talents for work, which are now all she has of resource, to some account. Talking the matter over there, it came into Gordon&#x2019;s head that at Campbelltown there was a richly endowed female School just likely to become vacant:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably the school for poor girls in Dalintober, Campbeltown (Argyll, W Scotland), set up by Miss Campbell of Gowan Bank, further endowed on her death in <date when="1843-01-00">Jan.</date>; or the Female School of Industry, Campbeltown, to which she also left money.</note> &#xa3;45 salary a year with school-fees, with good house &#x26;c; and the suggestion was instantly closed with; Gordon is one of the trustees, and can get her the place if it do fall vacant. I shall entirely rejoice if Gordon&#x2019;s being with me on that occasion prove the source of such a refuge for this poor Widow, which Grace seemed to think would be in the very highest degree acceptable to her. (There is a bell ringing; half an hour before its appointed time! I must go down and see what it means, whether breakfast or only prayers. Shall I? Better stay where I am till sent for!)&#x2014;
From Grace&#x2019;s we walked to Adam Street East, on the opposite corner of Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, down in the Richmond street and Drummond Place region. Betty and her man<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alexander Braid.</note> have a rough little provision-shop, with flourbags &#x26;c all filling it, at the very bottom of the Street, and looking with one window into the Pleasance: you now know where it is? She received me with astonishment, with emotion; made the kindest inquiring &#x26;c in her little back-shop, the tear hanging in her eye all the while; was &#x201C;terribly obleeged t&#x2019;ye Sir&#x201D;;&#x2014;poor Betty there could no heart be filled with truer <foreign><hi rend="italic">pietas</hi></foreign> [goodness] than was hers towards her old Haddington home. Her regret was great and repented that I could not see her young boy, now grown a young man and watchmaker&#x2019;s apprentice, that I might report to you what a monster of robustness he was now grown to. I shook hands with the husband who was busy weighing meal &#x26;c, a heavy substantial man; and so took my leave of Betty&#x2014;poor good Betty!</p>
<p>Dodds and Dr Brown and an evening of <hi rend="italic">incessant</hi> semi-interesting or uninteresting talk succeeded till midnight delivered me. <foreign>Ach Gott!</foreign> It is the horriblest insupportability to be tumbled about and set down first here and then there with the expectation, almost expressed to you, that you are to talk, talk! I could have started up and exclaimed, &#x201C;In the name of God, let me be silent!&#x201D; Nay I did sit silent often; and listen to the small flow of the subsidiary streams. Dodds is a right healthy, merry little fellow, with a broad blonde head, massive Roxburgh <pb id="pg-17-128" n="17:128"/>nose, and pair of most laughing healthy intelligent eyes: his talk was as good as weariness; but I was right glad to form a favourable horoscope of Dodds: a thrifty, sober, sturdy little fellow, with a <foreign><hi rend="italic">fond gaillard</hi></foreign> [vigorous foundation], which will carry him thro&#x2019; much. He will likely become a rich advocate yet, if he live. Brown&#x2019;s chance of the Chemistry chair seemed to himself good: he is the very contrast of Dodds, lean height versus cheery breadth with a <foreign><hi rend="italic">fond gaillard</hi></foreign>.&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; On the morrow morning at Craigcrook I found the old phenomena somewhat in a deteriorated state. The little Duke has lamed his <hi rend="italic">shin;</hi> sits lean, disconsolate, irritable, talkative and argumentative as ever, with his foot laid on a stool: poor old fellow, I talked with him, him chiefly, till two o&#x2019;clock, and then they drove me off homewards in their carriage; and I finally got myself delivered from Gordondom too, and with a sigh of most sad but deep satisfaction found myself left alone, entirely silent, on the deck of the Kinghorn Boat.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The ferry to Kinghorn, Fife, across the Firth.</note>&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>Well, yesterday at noon Thomas Erskine did take me up, and the good Ferguses dismissed me with many blessings. The day was damp, almost wet; we got here about five: my Goody&#x2019;s Letter did lie on the table; thousand thanks to her! This House is a huge place fit to lodge a regiment of men; intricate staircases, wings new and old,&#x2014;I shall not learn the way of it at present! Ha! there <hi rend="italic">is</hi> the <hi rend="small-caps">gong</hi>: breakfast! <foreign>Adieu</foreign>&#x2014;</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">After breakfast.</hi> I have been in the Garden and outer premises, sauntering with the good Saint Thomas; at length a &#x201C;person in business&#x201D; called him away, and I have liberty to resume. We are here a numerous somewhat sombre household; Patersons, the Captain and Mrs, and then various Miss and Master P.s, and an ancient honest-looking taciturn Miss or Mrs P.:<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Erskine&#x2019;s sister David (Davie) Paterson (<date when="1791-00-00">1791</date>&#x2013;<date when="1867-00-00">1867</date>) and her husband, James (<date when="1795-00-00">1795</date>&#x2013;<date when="1856-00-00">1856</date>), who had lived at Linlathen since they m., <date when="1821-00-00">1821</date>; see <ref target="volume-02/lt-18221124-TC-JJ-01"><sic>2:211</sic><corr>TC to JJ, <date when="1822-11-24">24 Nov. 1822</date></corr></ref>. They had a surviving son, James Erskine, and two das. The &#x201C;ancient&#x201D; Miss or Mrs. P. was probably one of James&#x2019;s three sisters&#x2014;Margaret (d. <date when="1845-00-00">1845</date>), Mary (d. <date when="1871-00-00">1871</date>), or Augusta (d. <date when="1844-00-00">1844</date>)&#x2014;who all lived in Edinburgh. His mother, Ann, had d., <date when="1802-00-00">1802</date>.</note> somewhat a monastic aspect! The day itself is hot sunless, still as Trophonius,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Shut up in a cave and consulted as an oracle; see <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410508-TC-RWE-01"><sic>13:127</sic><corr>TC to RWE, <date when="1841-05-08">8 May 1841</date></corr></ref>.</note> hardly the murmur of a pigeon audible. Many Carpenters nevertheless are working in the farther wing of the house, which has been detected to be all in a state of <hi rend="italic">dry rot;</hi> so that an instantaneous huddlement, and flight into the other parts of the house, had to take place; and all is rather topsiturvied at present. It would amuse you to see the good Saint Thomas officiate as Chief Commander of a Squire Mansion! I think he likes it dreadfully ill; but does it since it has to be done. &#x201C;Miller!&#x201D; he cries to the flunky, striving to <pb id="pg-17-129" n="17:129"/>throw a tone of <hi rend="italic">menace</hi> into it. The good Thomas. Only Mrs Paterson with her round healthy face is a little secular-looking, and what we call world-like in these solemn spaces; where if all did not seem so heartily to love &#x201C;Tom&#x201D; (that is <hi rend="italic">Saint</hi> Tom) and one another, it would almost threaten to look a little sombre. We stand on a beautiful green knoll amid profusion of respectable green umbrage, shrubbery, and woodery; our lawn unfortunately is under a crop of magnificent turnips just now: but all is very beautiful, could one have leave to walk about unseen in it.</p>
<p>A rational apprehension exists that I shall not get the Stirlings visited today,<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James and Susan Stirling.</note> that I shall have to put myself off with a slight passing call before sailing tomorrow. We have today for some reason or other no available carriage; the distance is above 4 miles; and that ancle of mine which the horse hurt is still swoln, and not in a case to be trifled with: besides I find that Thomas will walk with me; if I go, it will have to be in company! For the present I have as good as declined. I have a Letter to write to my Mother too. The <hi rend="italic">less</hi> work I do, the less laborious idleness I do, it will be the better for me. I have never even in London of late felt such an appetite for being well let alone, as here in the Scotch circles of so-called repose. O Goody, I wish I were with thee again. Yes, we will go into a room together, and have a little talk about time and space.<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-17/lt-18430831-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1843-08-31">31 Aug.</date>]</ref>.</note> Thou wilt hardly know me again; I am brown as berry, face and hands; terribly bilious, sick even; yet with a feeling that there is a good stock of new health in me, had I once leave to sub-side. Courage! In few hours more it will be done.</p>
<p>To write tomorrow unless I have freest leisure will be superfluous. We sail at 4 in the afternoon. I am booked for one of the best places; and there are not many passengers at this Season: on friday afternoon, to dinner probably, I shall, if all go well&#x2014;see Goody again! Dear Goody!</p>
<p>Saint Thomas was charmed with your message to him. He had totally mistaken his appointment at Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> about the clergy; it was for <hi rend="italic">this</hi> week, not for last: likewise he lost his Bag at Kinghorn, and it went travelling to St Andrews and all over Fife in his absence, and only <hi rend="italic">met</hi> him on the road yesterday near home! <foreign>Adieu, Adieu</foreign> my Dearest; while you read this, I am tumbling incessantly towards you on the crest of waves; impatient enough to arrive, if it please Heaven! <closer><salute>God foreverer<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> bless thee.</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute><hi rend="small-caps">My dear Mother</hi>,&#x2014;</salute>According to promise, I write you another little word to announce that I am safe so far on my way, that I embark tomorrow and hope to be home on Friday afternoon. I am heartily desirous of it! This last part of my travels has been considerably the <hi rend="italic">weariest</hi>, for I have been all along eager chiefly to have done with it. Jamie knows how fain I would never have entered upon it all. He took notice of my reluctance at Dumfries and how welcome a shower of rain would have been to me! However it is near ending now; and I shall enjoy the quiet of home all the more. One thing, dear Mother, let me straightway tell you; that I have <hi rend="italic">not</hi> left one of my new shirts, that the whole six, when I fold them duly out, are here. I grieve that you should have had a moment&#x2019;s uneasiness about that matter, which is due only to my own blindness and numbness; my hope is that you did not take it up too earnestly, but left the matter over &#x201C;till Jenny came.&#x201D;</p>
<p>I have now got two letters from Jane, the last of them only yesterday! All is well at Chelsea; Jack not yet settled in any lodging, nor in the least decided what to do, but &#x201C;in a state of torpor&#x201D; as Jane says &#x201C;playing with the cat.&#x201D; He was dining with Lady Clare; that was the last feat recorded of him. I was much grieved to hear that you had somehow missed Alick&#x2019;s letter: has it never yet turned up for you? I am too ignorant about the business to form any conjecture how it could have come about. Meanwhile it was very lucky that there came another letter of the same date for Jack:&#x2014;this I am in hopes will be ready for me at London when I arrive. By the bye, might it not be that Alick had only <hi rend="italic">meant</hi> and fully intended to write you a letter, and then had suddenly found that he would not have time by that mail? Of course the two letters, if there had been two, would come together: it is unaccountable how <hi rend="italic">one</hi> of them should drop by the way. What a blessing to us to hear that poor Alick is safe there and ready to begin <pb id="pg-17-131" n="17:131"/>his adventure on fair terms. Jane says his letter is of very composed tone and &#x201C;very practical looking.&#x201D; She seems to like the tone of it well. I went over to Edinburgh since I last wrote. I there saw Gordon, saw various other friends&#x2014;with more or less of labour and fatigue. I spent a forenoon with Jeffrey who is very thin and fretful I think; being at any rate weakly, he is much annoyed at present by a hurt on his shin&#x2014;a quite insignificant thing otherwise, which however disables him from walking. Poor Jeffrey! he does not make a nice <hi rend="italic">old</hi> man, he has too little real seriousness in him for that. On the whole I was heartily glad to quit Edinburgh again and get away from it into quietude across the Frith. I wrote to Jean at Dumfries one day. <supplied>[&#x2026;]</supplied> on my first Letter to her? At all events she now knows what is become of me.</p>
<p>Yesterday, by appointment, the good Thomas Erskine took me up at Kirkcaldy; carried me off hither on the top of the coach, bag and baggage. The day was damp and dim, not exactly wet, yet in danger of becoming ra<supplied>[in]</supplied>y. There had been rain in the night time (Sabbath night or early on Monday morning); but there fell no more. This day again is oppressively hot, dry, yet without sun or wind,&#x2014;a baddish &#x201C;day for a stook.&#x201D; But they prophecy fair weather now;&#x2014;which I shall be glad of; and the whole country will be glad, for all is white here, in sheaves and stooks and little got into ricks yet.&#x2014; We got here about five in the evening; a great party of people in the house (a big <hi rend="italic">laird&#x2019;s</hi> house, with <hi rend="italic">flunkies</hi> &#x26;c &#x26;c): I was heartily tired before I got to bed. I do not think I shall be rightly at rest till I get on Shipboard: there I <hi rend="italic">will</hi> lie down, and let all men have a care of stirring me; they had better let the sleeping dog lie!&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; The Dundee Steamers are allowed to be the best on these waters; large swift ships, and very few passengers in them at present. I spoke for my place yesterday, and am to have the best; the kind people here will whirl me down (it is four miles off); and then, about four o&#x2019;clock in the afternoon, I shall&#x2014;light a pipe in peace, and <hi rend="italic">think</hi> of you all speaking not a word! I expect to sleep well there too; and then on friday perhaps about 3 o&#x2019;clock, I may be at London Bridge, and home by the most convenient conveyance to Chelsea for dinner. This, if all go well, this ends for the present my pilgrimings up and down the world.</p>
<p>Dear Mother, I wish I had gone direct home when I left you; for it is not pleasant somehow to be still in Scotland, and far from you. I speak not the thoughts I send towards you, for speech will not express them.&#x2014; If I arrive <hi rend="italic">noon</hi> on friday, you may perhaps find a Newspaper at Ecclef<hi rend="italic">n</hi> on Sabbath morning. Monday much likelier. <closer><salute>God bless you all!</salute></closer></p>

<salute><hi rend="italic">My</hi> Babbie!</salute>
<p>&#x201C;You <hi rend="small-caps">are</hi> good,&#x201D; to make apologies to me all the same when I am your debtor as your creditor; it is well-judged moreover, for <hi rend="italic">the which</hi> makes in fact no difference in the impatience with which I look for letters from you and my disappointment when they do not come&#x2014; I do not know how it is; but I have somehow of late cut the cables of all my customary habitudes and got far out at sea&#x2014;drifting before the wind of circumstance in a rather helpless manner&#x2014;not that I am become lazy or indifferent&#x2014;I was never more full of energy and <hi rend="italic">emotion &#x201C;since I <foreign>kennt</foreign></hi> [knew] <hi rend="italic">the worl</hi>&#x201D; (as they say in Annandale), but a Destiny seems to have taken possession of me body and soul&#x2014;and orders me this way and that, and thro&#x2019; <hi rend="italic">my</hi> head and hands perform <hi rend="italic">its</hi> will, without giving me the smallest voice in any matter. To look at me <hi rend="italic">in action</hi>, you would say that my whole heart and life was in it&#x2014;and so it is; but then there is a something dominating my heart and life&#x2014;some mysterious power which mocks my own volition and fore-thought.&#x2014; The results are good so far&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">useful</hi>&#x2014;contributory to &#x201C;the greatest happiness of the greatest number&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Benthamite phrase.</note>&#x2014; Never says Bishop Terrot have I seen any one so <hi rend="italic">improved in amiability</hi> as you are!&#x2014;why you seem to aim at superseeding Providence on the face of the earth&#x201D;! Letters come to me commencing with &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">ange tul&#xE9;laire</hi></foreign> [guardian angel]&#x201D; and such like recognitions of my practical helpfulness&#x2014;and then my zeal and superhuman success in the rehabilitation of my house makes me pass for the model of wives&#x2014;and all the while Babbie&#x2014;between ourselves hang me if I have the slightest natural bias either to the career of <hi rend="italic">benevolence</hi> or of <hi rend="italic">notableness!</hi>&#x2014; Neither do I wish to <hi rend="italic">act</hi> either of these <hi rend="italic">r&#xf3;les</hi>. I tell you they are <hi rend="small-caps">put upon</hi> me by some superior power and I go thro with them like a person in the magnetic state doing the bidding of his Magnetiser&#x2014;with a vague, internal, spell-bound protest which goes for nothing&#x2014;</p>
<p>But I should like much better to talk to you of all this than to write about it&#x2014; The only direction in which I seem to have got myself put out lately&#x2014;in any thing like a voluntary, spontaneous way has been, in revolting every day and hour of the last week against the infliction of John!&#x2014; Of course I do not mean that I <hi rend="italic">openly</hi> quarrel with him&#x2014;in Carlyle&#x2019;s absence <hi rend="italic">that</hi> would be a sad impropriety&#x2014;but I concentrate all my forces into a position of grim impassivity, which any power <pb id="pg-17-133" n="17:133"/>of teazing and boring except his own would <foreign><hi rend="italic">echouer</hi></foreign> [be wrecked] against&#x2014; There is something so irritating at the very outset in having a man fix himself down in your house&#x2014;palpably for <hi rend="italic">its</hi> sake not yours&#x2014;so that his material wants be all supplied&#x2014;it is no matter by <hi rend="italic">whom</hi>&#x2014;nay one would say that he considered the act of administering to <hi rend="italic">his</hi> wants like Virtue its own reward!&#x2014;for he will sit morning after morning munching away at his breakfast and gazing into vacancy without once addressing me as if I were the Chinese figure that one sees in some of the tea-shop windows!&#x2014; &#x201C;The Devil fly away with him&#x201D; for having come to hand before my husband returned&#x2014;I should have been glad to have had my new house hanselled by <hi rend="italic">him</hi>&#x2014;rather than this other who makes <hi rend="italic">confusion</hi> wherever he be&#x2014;and I <hi rend="italic">should</hi> have liked after so long an absence to have been a day or two with <hi rend="italic">himself</hi> in peace and reason&#x2014;but John&#x2019;s peculiar talent as I have long known is to be &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">toujours hors de propos</hi></foreign> [always ill-timed]&#x201D; so there is no help for it&#x2014; In his attempt at being civil even&#x2014;&#x201C;few and far between&#x201D; this <foreign><hi rend="italic">hors de propos-ness</hi></foreign> discloses itself Just <hi rend="italic">one</hi> such attempt has he made since his return&#x2014; On Thursday last I was feeling particularly knocked up&#x2014;and just on Thursday and on no other day he <hi rend="italic">would</hi> have me to go out somewhere with him.
&#x201C;I lived too quietly&#x201D; he said&#x2014;&#x201C;I should go out more, and <hi rend="italic">see things</hi>&#x201D;&#x2014;it would be good for me to go that evening to the Surrey zoological gardens&#x201D;&#x2014; I refused at first on the score of being too weak&#x2014;but as he continued to press me I yielded at last merely to show a disposition to receive anything so unwonted as a courtesy from <hi rend="italic">him!</hi> He told me the place was &#x201C;close by Vauxhall&#x201D; to which we were to go in the steamboat&#x2014;it was at least two miles beyond Vauxhall&#x2014;when I was breaking down however providence sent a stray cab to my aid&#x2014; &#x2014;The gardens we finally reached and there I &#x201C;saw things&#x201D; with a vengeance! You may fancy how he would lead one this way and that, backwards and forwards, to this and the other beast and bird&#x2014;and tell one its name and properties over and over and over again&#x2014;in an hour I was half dead with it and declared that if he did not let me sit down on a seat that presented itself I should certainly faint&#x2014;&#x201C;Much better come this way&#x2014;there was something well worth seeing farther on&#x2014;one might find a better seat than that&#x201D;&#x2014;so I dragged after him till we came in view of the <hi rend="italic">grand wonder</hi> of these gardens &#x201C;The Indian City <hi rend="italic">of Elora</hi>&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ellora, village in Hyderabad, India, famous for its rock temples carved out of the hillside.</note> all <hi rend="italic">done</hi> into pasteboard, as large as life, and shone on by the <hi rend="italic">real</hi> moon!&#x2014; &#x201C;And it was nothing now&#x201D; he told me in comparison with what it would be by and by&#x2014;and he handed me a bill by which it appeared that at half after <hi rend="italic">eight</hi> oclock (observe <pb id="pg-17-134" n="17:134"/>it was then only half after five) <hi rend="italic">the Indian City of Elora</hi> would be &#x201C;all lighted up with <hi rend="italic">fire</hi>&#x201D;&#x2014;there would be <hi rend="italic">fire</hi> in the caves in the palaces&#x2014;&#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Jet <foreign>d&#x2019;eaus</foreign> of</hi> <hi rend="small-caps">fire</hi>&#x201D; (as the bill had it) from the Lake,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">fire</hi>-dragons&#x2014;&#x201C;a sacrifice to the Spirit of <hi rend="italic">Fire</hi>&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;Brilliant Apotheosis of the <hi rend="italic">Fire</hi>-God&#x201D;&#x2014; &#x26;c &#x26;c&#x2014;so much <hi rend="italic">fire</hi> that my poor head <hi rend="italic">took fire</hi> at the bare thought of it!&#x2014;and when in addition I found it was to be waited for <hi rend="italic">three hours;</hi> a sacred horror crept over my heart and I felt for the moment that my whole happiness here and hereafter depended on my getting away from that place without an instants delay!&#x2014; John protested, argued against &#x201C;the stupidity of going back without having seen what I had come for&#x201D;&#x2014; God is my witness that I knew no more <hi rend="italic">what</hi> I had &#x201C;come for&#x201D; than the Babe unborn!&#x2014;away I came anyhow, and mercifully was <hi rend="italic">just in time</hi> for the last Steamboat&#x2014;he had no scheme for getting me home <hi rend="italic">the seven miles</hi>, had we stayed!&#x2014;there was no cab-stand no Omnibuses&#x2014;and for this tremendous adventure he had chosen just a day when I was pale as a ghost and to the outward eye even more than usually <hi rend="italic">suffering</hi>. Of course I had to go to bed quite ill&#x2014;having realized a cruel headach&#x2014;and while I was taking off my clothes he knocked at my door and proposed that I should &#x201C;come upstairs and look thro&#x2019; his telescope at the four moons of Jupiter!! A chance when I should see them to such advantage again?&#x201D;&#x2014; &#x201C;Oh&#x201D; I thought &#x201C;if <hi rend="italic">you</hi> were in one of them!&#x2014;or <hi rend="italic">quartered</hi> into the four!&#x2014; How much more insupportable is that inveterate egotism which has absolutely lost all of other peoples feelings, than a good downright, spirited vice!</p>
<p>If Helenborough were not in Scotland I should long so much to fly away to you all! Your letter gives one such a feeling of a place all sunshiny and hearts all sunshiny&#x2014; Next year&#x2014;if we live to see it I have a scheme for a <hi rend="italic">grande reunion</hi> at the Isle of Wight.&#x2014; I even looked after <hi rend="italic">a house</hi> for my Uncle there!&#x2014; I believe the <hi rend="italic">place</hi> would be charming under ordinary circumstances&#x2014;and so accessible!</p>
<p>Carlyle is to be home on Friday I expect&#x2014; He has been to Haddington (!) and Kirkaldy and is now off to Thomas Erskine at Dundee!&#x2014; It was very strange for me getting a letter from him dated Haddington&#x2014; He went there for the sake of <hi rend="italic">a battlefield of Oliver Cromwells</hi> at Dunbar&#x2014; Whither he <hi rend="italic">walked</hi>&#x2014;(eleven miles and back again) spending two nights with the Donaldsons at Sunny Bank&#x2014; He was at Thornhill too by my desire&#x2014;much against his own feelings&#x2014; He saw old Mary and Margaret and the Russels&#x2014; &#x2014;He has seen all that remains for me in Scotland&#x2014;two graves. &#x2014;I do not know what good it does me that <hi rend="italic">he</hi> should have been there&#x2014;at Crawford and at Haddington&#x2014;but I am pleased to have as it were sent a message to them since I want force to go myself&#x2014; Oh Babbie I am horribly sad <pb id="pg-17-135" n="17:135"/>always at the bottom of my heart&#x2014;my external life is all smoothed over again, and flows on noiselessly enough&#x2014;but underneath!&#x2014; Happily the world troubles itself little what we have <hi rend="italic">deep down</hi>&#x2014;and the thing to be chiefly guarded against in suffering is plaguing ones fellow creatures with ones individual griefs&#x2014;</p>
<p>Carlyle rode over to Walter&#x2019;s and found not only Walter but his Landlady gone<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >At Auchtertool.</note>&#x2014;he brought down Mr Fergus&#x2019;s pony and peeled one of its knees and bruised his own ancles and wrists in the business!</p>
<p>The other Walter is a puzzle to me<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Macgregor.</note>&#x2014;for my life I cannot make out whether he cares a farthing for that intended of his or no.</p>
<p>How very glad I am to hear such good accounts of my Uncle&#x2014;a dozen kisses to him&#x2014;and love to all the rest&#x2014;I do not forget that I owe Helen a letter&#x2014;</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>It is a long time since I have had the smallest written intercourse with you. At the time of your departure I was involved in such a whirl of hurry, and business night and day, as I hardly ever was in before: I did write to you in time for Liverpool, nay the Letter had been lying there on the very morning (Saturday) when you sent your Letter off to me; but you never got it; a good while afterwards it came back to me, without effect! I shall not soon forget the emotions of those days. At every vacant moment my mind was full of the image of you,&#x2014;all the sadder that I had to <hi rend="italic">fall to work again</hi>, and think only of my work. Furthermore I always hoped to get up perhaps and see you still; on the Tuesday I should have been ready for it, and I still thought you might linger for a day or two: alas, on the Tuesday came John&#x2019;s Letter to say that you had sailed!&#x2014; I keep your last Note to me as a very stern and yet blessed memorial: my short Note to you, which you never read, is now laid beside it; they shall lie there to keep me in mind of several things. Dear Brother, I write all this, lest at any <pb id="pg-17-136" n="17:136"/>moment you should have fancied what never was the fact that I was too careless of writing to you; sure enough that was not it! Two weeks after your departure I myself, considerably exhausted by writing &#x26;c, set out on a wandering and visiting thro&#x2019; Wales North and South, by Liverpool, Scotland, not forgetting Scotsbrig and dear old Annandale; and it was only three nights ago that I returned hither, and for the first time got sight of your Letter to the Doctor; and knew rightly <hi rend="italic">where</hi> to address that I might find you. My Tour, ending in a Sail by Steam in rough seas all the way from Dundee, has in the first place tired and lamed me so that I can hardly stir: a few words, however, shall go by this Packet; so much is still possible for me: Jack agreed that he should address you at John Carlyle&#x2019;s in Canada, I at R. Clow&#x2019;s in New York State; and <hi rend="italic">both</hi> our letters we hope, will find you without much delay. Luckier than <hi rend="italic">both</hi> yours; for of these only one (that written to Jack) has yet come to hand.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alexander&#x2019;s letter to his mother, sent on from Scotsbrig, arrived after this letter was posted; see <ref target="volume-17/lt-18430929-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1843-09-29">29 Sept.</date></ref></note> Your two New York Newspapers came, one of them while I was at Dumfries; you cannot overrate the joy they gave us. Our good Mother brought out the Cover of hers with a peculiar look when I came back to Scotsbrig. Your letter to our Mother also will surely come? At all events, we should be right thankful for what we have got.</p>
<p>We are all much pleased with the healthy practical tone of your Letter, and take it as a good augury of your success in that new field. What you say of the Yankees agrees too well with my own experience and ideas of them. With some few shining exceptions they have come to appear in my eyes as a truly unpleasant set of persons, full of cant, full of vanity, and of a forwardness, not to say an impudence that seeks its fellow in the world. Visages among them, not unlike &#x201C;living red herrings,&#x201D; I have also seen. Not a pleasant set of men! Of course we cannot in the least advise you in that new scene; but perhaps you will find upper Canada with Scotch neighbours round you, a more kindly place. You will have time to look about you, and deliberate. A piece of ground all <hi rend="italic">your own</hi>, moreover, would perhaps be most acceptable to you. You have endless skill in you for battling with a work like what that would be. Jack has already advised you about health&#x2014;pray attend very specially to that. We shall long to know where you ha<supplied>[ve]</supplied> ultimately pitched your tent; many a thought we shall all send thither, I believe. Nor, if you will write duly, shall due Letters from one of us at least be ever wanting while I can wag a pen. Courage, my dear Brother; may the <hi rend="italic">worst</hi> of our days be past!</p>
<p>The wretched windbag Hanning sent a Letter to Jamie while I was <pb id="pg-17-137" n="17:137"/>at Scotsbrig; urging that Jenny should be advised to go out with you to join him. Jamie, after consulting with me and also with Jenny herself, answered in brief, that neither he nor you nor Jenny herself nor any one of the kindred wished to hear any farther talk from such a character as he had proved himself; that in short he had better go his ways, and leave all us to go ours. The consummate blown-up Nothingness! Jenny herself seems now to have renounced him: if he did chance to marry, or to get hanged, or in some way to terminate all legal hold of her, it would be by far the handsomest thing he could do.&#x2014; At Scotsbrig, as Jack will have told you, our good Mother was in better health than when you left her; indeed wonderfully cheery; speaking about you and your voyage with endless affection indeed, but without despondency, with peaceable hope: the good old Mother; as good a Mother as lives on this Earth at present! Jenny had staid with her for a considerable while; two Cousins from Hawick, good young women, one of them in poor health, were there when I came away about a fortnight ago; they and Jenny were to go over to Gill for a while; then she perhaps to join them there. Alternative like that was judged to be the best way. The kindred all were in good health, except Isabella who remained as before. Jamie seemed to have a fair crop, and this is the best harvest weather I have almost ever seen. Austin was behind with his rent; inevitably, like many others. A good harvest was growing everywhere; but no abatement, or hardly any was yet visible of the <hi rend="italic">Universal</hi> distress. Rejoice that you are out of it. Black days are coming for this country.&#x2014; Alas, dear Brother my paper is done! Write by the very earliest chance; you shall have a better answer in return. <closer><salute>God bless you all.</salute></closer></p>

<ps><p>Jane is well here, better than her worst. She had provided a little gift for you, quite <hi rend="italic">useless</hi> but very precious for it had been her Father&#x2019;s: this stood ready, but could not be sent in time; one day we may have a better opportunity.&#x2014; I rejoice greatly to hear that Tom was becoming a brave fellow worthy of the name.

<salute>Dear Fitzgerald</salute>
<p>We are to give up Naseby till convenient times arise; a result suitable to the state of your affairs; and highly suitable to mine, for I never in my life felt so weary of travelling, such a desire to shut my eyes and lips, and all my seven senses, and lie down to sleep like Epimenides, Rip van Winkle, or the Christian sleepers, were it for a hundred and fifty years!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Epimenides, in Greek legend a shepherd who as a boy fell asleep in a cave and awoke fifty-seven years leter. Rip Van Winkle, in Washington Irving&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Sketch Book</hi> (<date when="1819-00-00">1819</date>), fell asleep for twenty years and awoke to find himself an old man.

<p><pb id="pg-17-139" n="17:139"/>I arrived on friday last nearly tumbled to death in the Dundee Steamer among fat Cattle and stupid men. My answer to all the world is &#x201C;Take my life; but leave me, O leave me my repose&#x201D;</p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Your kind Letter found me still in Scotland: it is not yet much more than a fortnight since I returned, by aid of a Dundee Steamer, thoroughly sick of travelling, and more entirely wearied in body and mind than I ever felt in my life before.</p>
<p>The Bishop&#x2019;s Palace<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Connop Thirlwall&#x2019;s.</note> did not hold me long; I went away, glad to have seen it and its owner, yet saying to myself, &#x201C;Here is not my rest!&#x201D; A long days driving brought me round to Gloucester; a night truly horrible, in an Inn full of Lawyers (for I fallen again into the wake of Assizes), and then another busy day, procured me a glimpse of Worcester Battlefield as well as the localities of Gloucester Siege; and without any <hi rend="italic">new</hi> attempt to sleep, I was in Liverpool, ready to take North Wales on that the accessible side of it. North Wales on any side did not please me greatly: a country of mist, barrenness and rain; of scraggy bare bleak moors, crumbling cottages unhappy-looking people; to which the few slate chasms with their torrents, infested all of them by the vermin of &#x201C;the Picturesque,&#x201D; were but a poor offset! I was on Snowdon top; but unhappily might as well have lain in my bed under nightmare; the mist had swallowed all things; hardly even would a cigar take fire in the bitter tempestuous damp: one came down to &#x201C;the Grave of Gellert,&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Beddgelert, village at the foot of Mt. Snowdon, supposedly named after the hound of Llewellyn (or Llywelyn) the Great (d. <date when="1240-00-00">1240</date>).</note> with wearied bones, and a sense that Snowdon was a failure Terrible &#x201C;Welsh wettings&#x201D; also were provided us on <pb id="pg-17-141" n="17:141"/>other occasions; wettings equivalent to steeping in the Ocean! Some beautiful things, Menai Bridges, queer old cities, precipices and cathedrals, do rest in my memory, struggling as yet to evolve themselves out of the clouds and discomforts: but on the whole I was glad enough to quit Wales and the trade of Picturesque Tourist both together; and, in a very silent mood, get across the Solway, and take shelter beside my Mother. Three weeks there, passed as far as possible in silence, were, except the other similar three weeks at Llandough, by far the best I had in my travels I declined Cumberland; declined several things. A &#x201C;sense of duty,&#x201D; a really <hi rend="italic">painful</hi> sense at least, took me round by Dunbar Battleground, and thereupon by Edinburgh, Fife, and old friends in that region of the world;&#x2014;among whom, also I had to live as one half-alive, denizen not of Earth, but of Hades and Chaos;&#x2014;making naturally the greatest haste to <hi rend="italic">get away!</hi> It was real relief to me to sit down with a cigar on the deck of the Steamer, and say to myself, &#x201C;Now, by the Eternal Powers, I will at least speak no more, for some time!&#x201D; A horrible brute of a horse, <hi rend="italic">higher</hi> than Madge Wildfire,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Redwood&#x2019;s mare.</note>
and too unlike her in all respects, fell plump down with me, on plain road, while I was in Fife; a feat I cannot yet forget: the fruits of it in those hours were a real addition of annoyance to me. After unheard-of meditations, I did get home to Chelsea at last, found my good Wife well, and all bright as a new guinea here: continual lying on sofas, and the most absolute donothingism, such has been my employment ever since. On a larger scale than ever heretofore I have convinced myself that I cannot travel. To judge by actual sensation of the moment, I do not seem to have gained in health, but to have lost; nevertheless there is a kind of deeper intimation in me that some slight improvement does lie ready for developing itself; that, had those tumultuous mud-billows once subsided, some increase of fertility and solidity will be apparent. London is at present the quietest of all places for me; all men gone out of it, or nearly all whom I have the slightest knowledge of. As health clears up, Conscience too will arouse herself, with cockatrice sting: I shall have to do one of two things, get to work or grow mad! May the gods turn it to good.&#x2014;</p>
<p>Llandough I cannot forget while I live; but it seems to me at this moment impossible that I should ever visit it again. Good be with you all there, ye true ones! Your good, quiet Mother, clear and venerable to me; the simple faithful Jones and James;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Servants.</note> the daisy-rake, the beehive, porch-seat, hill, trees, and meadow: all that, and the friendly owner of all that, remains forever a possession to me.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-17-142" n="17:142"/>On the whole you must bid me prosper in my work,&#x2014;for that is the one salvation or alleviation possible to me. You must remember me with tolerance; you must come and see us when you get to London. <closer><salute>And so <foreign><hi rend="italic">Vale mei memor</hi></foreign> [Farewell and remember me].</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Jean,</salute>
<p>Yesterday your welcome Letter was carried off, after a due interval, to Jack;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Carlyle had moved, <date when="1843-09-15">15 Sept.</date> to lodgings at 6 Brompton Grove.</note> with a due intimation that he was to send Alick&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">second</hi> Letter down to me; by which method I intended to let you see them <hi rend="italic">both</hi>, not knowing exactly which of the two it was that you specially required. Jack was out when I called, so that I had to leave a short message in writing; and this has not yet been attended to, Jack has not seen that there was haste in it. I will send you off the Letter which I have, therefore; that probably is the one you did want to see (Alick&#x2019;s Letter to our Mother): so here it is, and there shall at least be no delay in the business. I consider it not unlikely that Jack may put off with the others till Sunday, unless I chance to see him in the interim.</p>
<p>You can return this Letter to <hi rend="italic">my Mother</hi> when you have done with it, for it is <hi rend="italic">hers</hi>. We were much satisfied with reading it and the other: they have a solid veracious kind of look, somewhat <hi rend="italic">quiet</hi> too, and be-token a well-doing humour in poor Alick. One hopes good for him, poor fellow, in that new scene of industry. It seems likeliest he will go over to Canada; nor is that, perhaps, to be regretted: the Yankee people, &#x201C;living red herrings&#x201D; in look, are an untowardly set in more important respects than that. I like them ever less the more I know of them.&#x2014; One other thing is to be added about this Letter: it arrived here just three hours<supplied>[. &#x2026;]</supplied><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Part of the MS is missing at this point. NLS 515.95 begins here.</note></p>
<p>as near as possible <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi>. Indeed it already prospers with me; I feel better, clearer, and my conscience already begins to clamour, Work, work, thou sluggard! That will have to be the end of it:&#x2014;alas, I am not even at the beginning yet! Yesterday I began to get out my papers, and had got my pen and ink put in order, when just at that moment the neighbouring young lady with her piano,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >One of the Lambert das.</note> who had been silent ever since <pb id="pg-17-143" n="17:143"/>my return till then, began thumping like ten pairs of fanners, and squalling and trilling like a cat-concert twenty strong:&#x2014;it went thro&#x2019; me like sharp shot, and drove all writing far way! This morning too, while we sat at breakfast, she started again as if to keep me in mind. I have determined to shift myself altogether up to my bedroom upstairs, and then defy her and the world. It is a back bedroom of good size, three stories from the ground; looks out over fields and gardens; has a closet &#x26;c: I think of shoving away my big bed, getting a very small folding-bed that can stand in a corner; and so starting in the name of Heaven. Jane has made this drawingroom a perfect beauty in my absence: but what&#x2019;s ta use on&#x2019;t for my writing purposes? We shall leave it for company, and fly up stairs.&#x2014; Alas, a bad worker never had good tools! I shall have an awful battle with this next Book; I have, as it were, <hi rend="italic">done nothing</hi> since the F. Revolution; and must really get up the steam again! At bottom I have no other ground for continuing to eat bread (which is so indigestible for me) in this world. God speed us:&#x2014;if so, there is no man nor pianoforte woman, nor body of men or women, that can entirely retard us!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Jack came here just as I was turning this leaf; and has sat a while. He is clear that it cannot be the Letter to <hi rend="italic">him</hi> that you are wanting; which Letter, he says, you saw at leisure nearly a month ago: it is in his lodging; he will bring it on Sunday in case. Jack, as you understand, is already fixed in Lodgings about a mile and a half from us: an excellent lodging, in a really eligible place, and very cheap at the money (one guinea per week); he looks out from the rear where is the sitting-room over more gardens and shady fields, on front his bit of street is withdrawn certain yards back from the public road; has an iron railing, a bit of gravel, and a carriage gate at each end. The people too are very respectable; the widow of one Bohn, a notable painter in enamel, is landlady.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Elizabeth, b. Vandermeulen, widow (m. <date when="1780-00-00">1780</date>) of Henry Bone (<date when="1755-00-00">1755</date>&#x2013;<date when="1834-00-00">1834</date>), R.A., enamel painter to George III, George IV, and William IV.</note> Jack seems to have been lucky in lodgings. He does not as yet come much here, except regularly on Sundays to dine: he is much quieter than he was, and I daresay is profitably considering himself about many things.</p>
<p>He had a Letter from our Mother last week; she was in her usual health and heart, good old Mother; represented Jamie as on the eve of geting done with shearing: the poor M&#x2019;Kinnow lass, she said, had got additional cold in the Dumfries quarter, and returned home very hoarse. Poor little thing; she seemed a clear innocent little lassie; it was very sad to see her in so bad a way.</p>
<p>Jane is well here, well for <hi rend="italic">her;</hi> she sends you many regards. Poor <pb id="pg-17-144" n="17:144"/>Mary at Gill! We hope she is past the worst now, almost recovered now. She is a sore-working body. Little Tom ought to stay in that <foreign><hi rend="italic">gang</hi></foreign> [course] for a time,&#x2014;as long as possible otherwise.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jean&#x2019;s son (b. <date when="1841-02-00">Feb. 1841</date>), who was staying at the Gill. Janet Hanning wrote to Jean, <date when="1843-10-06">6 Oct.</date>: &#x201C;he is very cheerfull. &#x2026; He sleeps well and upon the whole is brisker than ever I saw him&#x201D; (NLS Acc. 9086.36).</note> <foreign>Adieu</foreign> dear Sister. I have written at endless length to you, and know not when I shall write so much again. God bless you all.</p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Tho&#x2019; I am very much hurried again today, I really must not let the Post go without a small word of notice from me. You got a most brief Letter from <supplied>[me]</supplied><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> almost directly after my arrival; and since then you have heard nothing. Jack shewed me your kind little Letter in the beginning of this week: it really is our duty to make some answer, were it all the shorter!</p>
<p>Jack and I both wrote to Alick, one of us to Clow&#x2019;s, the other to John Carlyle&#x2019;s Care. We hope he will get both the Letters: the <hi rend="italic">places</hi> they were directed to, it seems, are not far distant. The Letter to <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, which had been so long missing, did not arrive here, unfortunately, till the evening post-time,&#x2014;till our Letters to Alick were both gone; so that he will have to continue for another fortnight in uncertainty about its arrival. We were all much pleased with the tone and style of his writing from that new country; and take it for a good augury of his speculations and procedure there.</p>
<p>As to me I was terribly wearied with my long travels; I have not yet mustered energy to begin any decisive labour at all since my return. London is totally quiet, free from all interruption of visitors, or nearly so; and the weather, which was at first hot, is now sufficiently cool: I remain therefore <hi rend="italic">resting</hi> myself, with all the composure that I can;&#x2014;my <hi rend="italic">Conscience</hi>, ever as I get clearer, loudly summoning me to get to some employment! I have a long hard work lying ahead of me; and must actually embark upon it before many days pass. Jane has made all the house bright as a new guinea, a most beautiful little drawingroom <pb id="pg-17-145" n="17:145"/>here:&#x2014;but my unfortunate neighbour of the <hi rend="italic">Piano</hi> starts playing at the same time; and so I believe, once for all, I shall have to shift my writing desk to a back room, which I at present occupy as a bedroom, at the top of the house; and <hi rend="italic">there</hi> defy the foolish creature to annoy me any more! The joiner has been here today, all morning, and we have entered upon plans about it. Alas, they say, &#x201C;a bad workman never had good tools!&#x201D; I must really try to make some kind of result out, not unworthy of all these preparations. I solicit all your good wishes;&#x2014;well do I know I <hi rend="italic">have</hi> them all!</p>
<p>Jack seems very lucky and happy in his new lodgings; much quieter he is in manner than we have seen him heretofore. He will gradually get into some useful course of industry, I doubt not, and do very well.</p>
<p>Poor Mary! But we hope she has got the worst of it over now. The poor M&#x2019;Kinnow Cousin too has made but little of her journey; poor thing, it is very sad what Jean says of her. I send you Jean&#x2019;s Letter which came the other day. We are much gratified to hear of Isabella&#x2019;s improvement;&#x2014;of Scotsbrig and Gill being all <hi rend="italic">shorn</hi> in this fine weather.&#x2014; O my dear Mother, surely I will write again, a better Letter than this, before many days go! I seem to have a thousand things to say, and none of them is said. By degrees I shall get <hi rend="italic">to work</hi>, and be more composed. <closer><salute>My heart&#x2019;s blessing with you always!</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Spring Rice,</salute>
<p>You are very kind to remember me, to ask me out again to see you.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >At Lewisham, where TC had visited Spring Rice in <date when="1843-01-00">Jan.</date></note> Alas, such a pleasure is far from my poor circle of possibilities at present!

How long that will be the Gods and the Fatal Sisters<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The three Fates.</note> alone know. Long enough;&#x2014;a long dreary time, not yet to be counted in months!</p>
<p>I have been on foot incessantly, a mere Wandering Jew, ever since the end of <date when="1843-06-00">June</date>; in Wales, England, Scotland, over mountain and chasm, thro&#x2019; town and desart, by sea and land: I returned home three weeks ago, the weariest mortal in all England; full of <hi rend="italic">remorse</hi> too; and <pb id="pg-17-146" n="17:146"/>am daily busy getting my workshop set in order, that I may <hi rend="italic">begin</hi> working,&#x2014;or else go mad! Come you and see me, when you are in Town and westward. At all events, give me your prayers.&#x2014;</p>
<p>I rejoiced to hear that my little sea-hero has made money.

<salute>Dear Procter,</salute>
<p>Many thanks for your kind Letter, for your graceful ingenious <hi rend="italic">Essay on Shakspeare,</hi> both of which I have received and read with very great pleasure.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">The Works of Shakspere &#x2026; with a Memoir and Essay on his Genius,</hi> 3 vols. (<date when="1843-00-00">1843</date>).</note> The <hi rend="italic">Essay</hi> abounds in just views, very happily set forth; many of them very far from common among English critics, or any sort of critics, in this time: to me in letter and spirit they are altogether welcome.&#x2014; Has Themis with her Eldorados stolen you <hi rend="italic">altogether</hi> from the Muses?<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Themis, mother of Prometheus and symbol of justice. Procter was a barrister and conveyancer, 4 Gray&#x2019;s Inn Sq., and a metropolitan commissioner of lunacy, <date when="1832-00-00">1832</date>&#x2013;<date when="1861-00-00">61</date>. He had pbd. no poetry since <hi rend="italic">English Songs</hi> (<date when="1832-00-00">1832</date>), when he wrote in the intro. that they were &#x201C;somewhat in the shape of a farewell offering&#x201D; (xvi). He wrote a <hi rend="italic">Life of Edmund Kean,</hi> 2 vols. (<date when="1835-00-00">1835</date>) and a memoir in <hi rend="italic">The Works of Ben Jonson</hi> (<date when="1838-00-00">1838</date>).</note> I never will believe it.</p>
<p>Rebecca is by no means &#x201C;beautiful&#x201D; to look upon: a daughter of <hi rend="italic">Nox,</hi> some say of Erebus too;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Nox, goddess of night; Erebus, darkness personified.</note> how can <hi rend="italic">she</hi> be other than ugly?&#x2014; I was not a little disappointed in Wales generally: a poor bare scraggy country, with a poor bare scraggy people; the few beautiful objects drowned generally in rain and mist; infested on every side by the fatal generation of view hunters! I do not care to look on it again for some time.</p>
<p>You will do me a true kindness if you come down to me here. I sit aloft in my garret, and rarely hear a voice that has much of sphere-melody in it. Do come: in the name of old days, why should you not? <pb id="pg-17-147" n="17:147"/>If you do not,&#x2014;not to say if you do,&#x2014;I myself, on my own resources, will come to Harley Street!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Procters lived at 13 Upper Harley St., 4 mi. N of Chelsea.</note></p>
<p>My wife joins with me in many kind regards to Mrs Procter and you;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Anne B. Procter wrote to R. M. Milnes, <date when="1843-10-09">9 Oct.</date>: &#x201C;I saw Carlyle some time since&#x2014;indeed, the day after his return home. He was, as usual, very like himself, and totally unlike any other two-legged animal. To speak with him is like opening some rare and rich book. One is better for it for some days. His society is a fine antidote against London life, which you tell me makes all people alike&#x201D; (Reid, <hi rend="italic">RMM</hi> 1:307).</note> <closer><salute>many blessings and good wishes.</salute></closer></p>

the whole result being plenty of <hi rend="italic">possibilities</hi>&#x2014;and a positive order for a pair of window boards to be all stuffed with cotton! to fasten on the back windows or the front (<foreign>viz</foreign> in <hi rend="italic">your</hi> room) at pleasure&#x2014; &#x2014;and as these will prevent the sleeping with windows <hi rend="italic">open</hi>&#x2014;zink pipes are to be introduced thro the walls to let in a sufficiency of fresh air! You are to observe by the way that it is only when the windows are wide open that this distant cock ever makes itself heard and&#x2014;that the simple expedient which Pierson suggested&#x2014;of <hi rend="italic">shutting the windows</hi> and <hi rend="italic">opening the door</hi> would have solved the problem as effectually and much more cheaply than all this apparatus of stuffed shutters and zink pipes! But then if the shutters make even the front room quiet enough for <hi rend="italic">him</hi> to sleep in&#x2014;and the zink pipe brings in air enough for <hi rend="italic">him</hi> to breath; the piano-problem is also solved!&#x2014;for his present-bedroom where alone the piano noise is not clearly audible is to be converted into his study&#x2014;the partition taken down between the two front rooms&#x2014;that the <hi rend="italic">two</hi> four posted beds may have room to stand up <hi rend="italic">there!</hi> until we can get a lease of the house (which is not procurable) and then a <hi rend="italic">silent</hi> room&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">twenty feet long&#x2014;lighted from above</hi>&#x2014;is to be built on the roof!!!&#x2014; So here is a quite other prospect than that of quiet order which I was looking forward to for the next twelve months at least! And I assure you it is with a heartrending sigh that I resign myself to the thought of lifting and altering all the carpets again, before they have been well down and having carpenters plasterers and white washers as before&#x2014;besides the inconvenience of having ones spare room as it were annihiliated&#x2014;for could <hi rend="italic">you</hi> for instance sleep in a doublebedded room with Carlyle? However there may be many plans, before the definitive one gets <hi rend="italic">carried into effect</hi>&#x2014;and anyhow I cannot help it&#x2014;and at least as Darwin <pb id="pg-17-150" n="17:150"/>says I &#x201C;have always the consolation of knowing that he will need some <hi rend="italic">new</hi> arrangements in six months or so&#x201D;!&#x2014; But indeed Babbie if you saw how pretty the upstairs floor is in its actual state and knew all the toil and scheming I had in bringing it into such order you would not wonder that I am fretted&#x2014; Your room too with the blue carpet from his bedroom (his had got the drawingroom one) and the position of the bed altered looked so like the Templand bedroom&#x2014;all the little things in it arranged as they were <hi rend="italic">there</hi>&#x2014;that one could almost deceive oneself into its being the same&#x2014; &#x2014;And all this to be overturned&#x2014; Well Well I cannot help it and what <hi rend="italic">is</hi> the use of talking&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">such</hi> woes are but very petty ones after all!&#x2014;</p>
<p>My darling I wonder how you <hi rend="italic">really</hi> are&#x2014; I get the most thorough conviction from your letters that you are in one of two states&#x2014;either much better in health than ever you have been <hi rend="italic">since I knew you,</hi> or&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;in the preparatory stage of a severe illness&#x2014;god grant the former may be the truth&#x2014;but when I consider how certainly all this newfound activity&#x2014;all this sensibility to natural objects&#x2014;in fact all this development of <hi rend="italic">gass in the blood</hi> would in my own case be symptomatic of approaching illness I cannot be quite easy about you&#x2014;</p>

<salute>Dear Milnes,</salute>
<p>Wherever on the face of this Earth you are, let me have a word from you once more.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In <date when="1843-09-00">Sept.</date> Milnes visited Connop Thirlwall in Carmarthen, and then, as he wrote to a friend, was to &#x201C;be about in Wales and Cornwall till the end of <date when="1843-10-01">October</date>, then to Fryston till Parliament meets [<date when="1843-11-00">mid-Nov.</date>]&#x201D; (Reid, <hi rend="italic">RMM</hi> 1:304).</note> The sound of your voice has become very desirable, even the picture of the sound of it,&#x2014;ah me!</p>
<p>I did design to send you tidings of me long ago. But I have been unfortunate; a weary, forlorn, most sickly wanderer; and could only sit silent,&#x2014;looking grimly into the Infinite of Black and Bright, an in-articulate Infinite! What can be &#x201C;said&#x201D; of it? You remember Cowper&#x2019;s Crow, perched on the top of the weathercock, and therefrom taking &#x201C;general views&#x201D;; he looks abroad too into the general sum of things,</p>
<p>And says,&#x2014;what says he?&#x2014; Caw!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;The Jackdaw,&#x201D; trans. from the Latin of Vincent Bourne (<date when="1695-00-00">1695</date>&#x2013;<date when="1747-00-00">1747</date>), by William Cowper (<date when="1731-00-00">1731</date>&#x2013;<date when="1800-00-00">1800</date>).</note></p>
<p>I too might have written &#x201C;Caw!&#x201D; could the post have carried such a syllable with due intonation: but it could <hi rend="italic">not</hi>.&#x2014; &#x2014; Some six weeks ago I returned home, the weariest man in all the Earth; lay down on sofas, to reading and other inanity, till the mud-whirlpools should subside again; which now at length, thank God, they begin to do; and so once more I address myself to the Hon. Member for Pomfret, and say, O Hon. Member speak to me!</p>
<p>To Thirlwall&#x2019;s for three days I did go, memorable days; saw myself kneeling in Laud&#x2019;s Chapel, not without reflexions, not without amazement; found the Bishop a most loveable, most considerable man; then emerged into secular life again, to Cromwell battlefields, bare Welsh wildernesses, and innumerable confusions;&#x2014;and on the whole will give you no history of myself at present, my time being brief.</p>
<p>For in fact the cause or excuse for my writing is a question I have to put. In one of the Chaotic volumes I am reading there turns up a trace, not indubitable, yet of some promise, that a certain Henry Darley, member two hundred years ago for Malton, &#x201C;took constant notes of the Long Parliament.&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For the Long Parliament notes, see <ref target="volume-17/lt-18431031-TC-RWE-01">TC to RWE, <date when="1843-10-31">31 Oct.</date></ref></note> Notes of the Long Parliament&#x2014;why, it were almost as if we had a <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> report of the debate between Agamemnon and the divine Achilles! That was the flower of all Parliaments, the greatest that ever had been, and also the greatest that ever will be: <pb id="pg-17-155" n="17:155"/>notes of <hi rend="italic">it</hi> are worth hunting like Books of the Sybil! Well, this Darley as I laboriously make out was the son of a Sir Richard Darley K<hi rend="italic">t</hi>, whose place was Buttercrambe some ten miles or so to the N.E. of York. He Sir R. had another son Richard, who at a later period of the Parliament was member for Northallerton: he himself had &#x201C;suffered losses&#x201D; for the Covenant&#x2019;s sake, and did at the end of the war get &#xa3;5,000 allowed him for compensation of the same. This is all I can dig out as yet that has essential reference to the Darleys.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sir Richard Darley (d. ca. <date when="1654-00-00">1654</date>), whose principal property was Buttercrambe, Yorks. Henry Darley (ca. <date when="1596-00-00">1596</date>&#x2013;ca. <date when="1671-00-00">1671</date>), also of Buttercrambe, M.P., for Aldborough, <date when="1628-00-00">1628</date>, for Northallerton, <date when="1641-00-00">1641</date>&#x2013;<date when="1653-00-00">53</date>. Richard Darley (ca. <date when="1603-00-00">1603</date>&#x2013;ca. <date when="1681-00-00">1681</date>), Henry&#x2019;s younger brother, M.P. for New Malton, <date when="1645-00-00">1645</date>&#x2013;<date when="1659-00-00">59</date>. The Long Parliament, <date when="1640-00-00">1640</date>&#x2013;<date when="1653-00-00">53</date>, was dissolved by Cromwell.</note></p>
<p>Now the question is, Do you know who at present holds that same manor of Buttercrambe?<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The manor of Buttercrambe, including Aldby Park, had been bought, <date when="1557-00-00">1557</date>, by the Darley family. By the eighteenth cent. it had descended to Jane Darley, m. to Henry Brewster; their son, Henry Brewster Darley, styled &#x201C;of Aldby Park,&#x201D; not of Buttercrambe, was grandfather of the current owner, Henry Darley (<date when="1777-00-00">1777</date>&#x2013;<date when="1846-00-00">1846</date>), m., <date when="1803-00-00">1803</date>, Mary Anne Martin (d. <date when="1865-00-00">1865</date>) and had three sons and two das. Aldby Park was on the edge of Buttercrambe village, 9 mi. NE of York.</note> Can you ask him if he got it by descent or otherwise from the Darleys,&#x2014;and above all what in Heaven&#x2019;s name has become of the Darley Papers? I really wish you would make a little inquiry about this affair: it strikes me you may fall in with some Yorkshire Antiquary, failing him of Buttercrambe, who might throw light on it. Not without advantage: for as I say the Long Parliament is a <hi rend="italic">forever</hi> memorable one. Let me add however that I have <hi rend="italic">another</hi> trace of Long Parl<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Notes; and that this Darley one is not an indubitability yet, but only a high or almost highest probability.</p>
<p>And so my good Friend <foreign>adieu</foreign> again. One never meets but to part; it is the Law of living here below. And true good souls are wrapt in such swathings and casings, each in his own wrappage, up to the very eyes, and cannot kiss and embrace with souls! <closer><salute>God pity us!</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I last night received your little volume of Poems dedicated to myself;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See also <ref target="volume-16/lt-18430622-TC-WIBA-01">TC to WIBA, <date when="1843-06-22">22 June</date></ref>.</note> and beg to acknowledge the same with many thanks. Your strenuous <pb id="pg-17-156" n="17:156"/>effort towards self-cultivation is an honourable fact; to which this little Book itself, as we glance thro&#x2019; it, will bear honourable testimony. I will fearlessly bid you, Persist in that, slacken not in that,&#x2014;for that, well understood, does in fact include the whole duty and profit of a man.</p>
<p>If you find encouragement to develope yourself in the way of Poetry, of course you will continue in that direction. Meanwhile, such is the temper of the present times, it may not be useless to remind you that, even if <hi rend="italic">dis</hi>couraged in that direction, there are others, a whole world of others, still open to you. A man who feels a heart and intellect stirring within him cannot want for objects to work upon. Nay he that in any province whatsoever makes the crooked straight, the disorderly methodic,&#x2014;has not he too made <hi rend="italic">music</hi> out of discord, has not he too <hi rend="italic">sung</hi> and been a Poet, if not in word, then in act, which is still better, still more imperishable? For the finest verse is, after all, mortal, and dies <hi rend="italic">one</hi> day, and is abolished; but the true <hi rend="italic">act</hi> lasts thro&#x2019; Eternity itself. We are commanded to be &#x201C;fervent&#x201D; (melodious) &#x201C;in spirit&#x201D;; but before all to be &#x201C;diligent in business&#x201D;:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Rom. 12:11 and Prov. 22:29.</note> and to me the noblest of all Poetry is that which sings itself thro&#x2019; a man&#x2019;s practical task in this world, and makes the general field of his life an orderly productive garden for him. On the whole, if the prosaic time do even forbid you in one path, you must try it in another, with unabated heart.</p>
<p>Wishing you all success,&#x2014;and courage, patience clearness, openness of mind, which are the elements of all success,</p>
<closer><salute>I remain with many thanks</salute></closer>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Thanks for the ray of light you have thrown over that dreary labyrinth of a mouldering Necropolis, named <hi rend="italic">Record Office,</hi>&#x2014;a true City of the Dead, and not yet properly Buried!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cole&#x2019;s letter, <date when="1843-10-24">24 Oct.</date>, was written from &#x201C;Branch of Public Record Office. Carlton Ride, east of Carlton Terrace. Pall Mall.&#x201D; Not till <date when="1851-00-00">1851</date> were English public records gathered at the Public Record Office, Chancery Lane, but were scattered in various London buildings and were largely uncatalogued. Cole was asst. keeper; see also <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350811-TC-HGR-01"><sic>8:191</sic><corr>TC to HGR, <date when="1835-08-11">11 Aug. 1835</date></corr></ref>.</note> How to turn those Parchments to account, if <hi rend="italic">not</hi> by making glue of them, seems to be a problem at present.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-17-157" n="17:157"/>Charles First&#x2019;s Roll would have been of some use or interest to me, as being one fixed statistic element, tho&#x2019; a most small one, in a watery chaos which, I believe, for undecipherability and sheer stupid confusion is without example among Nations that do record by writing, and not by Wampum or Peruvian thrums. Alas, life is far too short and Art far too long for an adventure like the one you shadow forth. I will leave this unfortunate Roll forever and a day,&#x2014; and hope at least that the rats may not get it, but the human carpenters to make useful glue!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cole wrote: &#x201C;If any record or role was made of the Muster in <date when="1634-00-00">1634</date> it ought &#x2026; to be in some department of the Exchequer,&#x2014;probably in that which until late years was the joint property of Rats &#x26; other vermin&#x2014;the Queen&#x2019;s Remembrancers Office. The records of this Office are now here and undergoing arrangement. &#x2026; The Records, among which the Muster Roll might be found are still practically inconsultable. &#x2026; I have caused a superficial hunt to be made among them without success.&#x201D;</note>&#x2014;</p>
<p>In seriousness, all I wanted was some guess, grounded on any authentic basis, at the Population of England in Charles First&#x2019;s time. It is but lately I have learned to guess that of London at some 3 or 4 hundred thousand. In regard to the general Population, there is not even, that I know of, ground for a guess.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Your note also hints at interest about the question of Population. There are records &#x2026; rolls of Subsidies &#x2026; if critically looked at, would certainly elucidate this matter. &#x2026; If you are ardent in the Chase &#x2026; and not daunted at the prospect of much toiling over much waste, &#x2026; go to the State paper Office, by the grace of the Home Secretary &#x26; one Henry Hobhouse [keeper of the state papers]&#x2014;a very jealous man of letting people into his Office. They profess to have papers relative to musters made in Charles I<hi rend="italic">st</hi> time&#x2014; So likewise in the Land Revenue Office in Spring Gardens but the State Paper Office is &#x2026; a likely enough place to find something,&#x2014;if you have time, patience &#x26; leave of entry.&#x201D; In <date when="1650-00-00">1650</date> the population of London was 350,000 and of England ca. 5,600,000.</note> Perhaps you know of some somewhere? If so, it will be a real service to point it out to me.</p>
<p>Let me also, since my hand is in, put another question. Can you inform me clearly, in the dialect of mortal men, what a &#x201C;subsidy&#x201D; actually was? They speak of a &#x201C;fifteenth&#x201D; too: what in God&#x2019;s universe <hi rend="italic">was</hi> this &#x201C;subsidy and fifteenth,&#x201D; &#x201C;subsidy and two fifteenths,&#x201D; which all the world writes of as a thing known to everybody, and no individual I can meet in the world will give any distinct explanation of?<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Subsidies were sums of money granted by parliament to the crown and raised by extraordinary taxation; these were distinct from the proceeds of the customs and other taxes levied by royal prerogative. The usual annual subsidy consisted of a tax at the rate of four shillings in the pound on the yearly value of the land and of two shillings eight pence on the value of good, besides other minor sums. Subsidies were replaced during the Commonwealth with revenue raised by a land tax. The fifteenth was also a tax forming part of an annual grant to the crown (from ca. <date when="1272-00-00">1272</date> to <date when="1624-00-00">1624</date>). The subsidy was a &#x201C;tenth and fifteenth,&#x201D; i.e., a tenth of the value of movables of inhabitants of cities, boroughs and ancient demesnes, and a fifteenth from all others.</note> Subsidies come down, I think, to the time of Charles II perhaps lower: what the <pb id="pg-17-158" n="17:158"/>value of a subsidy was in Charles First&#x2019;s time, if one first well knew what the subsidy itself was, would certainly throw light on the economics of that time. Perhaps you yourself know about all this; perhaps you can twitch by the ear some learned gentleman that does? A clear word in that direction would be a decided comfort to me. Let the learned gentlemen say also which the <hi rend="italic">last</hi> subsidy was,&#x2014;the date, namely, of the last tax ever levied under that name, or to be levied while time runs. We should then have done with it!&#x2014;</p>
<p>For the rest do not bother yourself about all this: if you can without undue trouble, then speak; if not, let it go to the winds,&#x2014;with my malison upon it! And believe me ever</p>

<p>I entreat Miss Babbie that you would devote ten minutes of your valuable time just to certify me that you are alive and whether you be returned to Liverpool&#x2014; To be sure you may think in a commercial spirit (wholly unworthy of you) that whilst your last long letter from Helenburgh remained unanswered I could not have any desire to know about you&#x2014;at all rates if I had any such desire that I did not deserve to have it gratified&#x2014;but I have my own idea babbie that if a Radamanthus had to administer justice in this case<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In Greek mythology Rhadamanthus was so just in life that he became a judge in the infernal regions.</note>&#x2014;he would pronounce unmitigated sentence on <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, whereas <hi rend="italic">me</hi> he would find &#x201C;guilty under <hi rend="italic">extenuating circumstances</hi>&#x201D; and commute my sentence to a one-farthing fine&#x2014; When that letter arrived hoping that my troubles would pass over with the blue pill&#x2014;I was already up to the ears in them. Pearson with his troop of incarnate fiends carpenters bricklayers whitewashers plasterers has already spread themselves <foreign><hi rend="italic">per ogne dove</hi></foreign> [everywhere]&#x2014;and Helen, at sight of such unexpected finale to her cleaning labours had been struck with a temporary ideocy&#x2014;so that I had to follow her about and supply her with wits as well as with active help at every turn, and with such heart as you can imagine&#x2014;besides having to ward off the deluge of confusion from the man himself&#x2014;who conducted himself on the occasion much like a half-conjuror&#x2014;finding that he had not the counter-spell to allay the storm which himself had raised he <pb id="pg-17-159" n="17:159"/>raged and lamented and all but rent his garments and tore his hair<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >As in Goethe&#x2019;s ballad &#x201C;Der Zauberlehrling,&#x201D; about the sorcerer&#x2019;s apprentice.</note>&#x2014; The front-bed-rooms were to have been thrown into one in <hi rend="small-caps">two</hi> days according to Pearson&#x2014;in <hi rend="italic">ten</hi> days the workmen had finished there!&#x2014;then the room had to be instantly fitted up for Carlyles sleeping room&#x2014;at least so long as the people should be breaking out a chimney and instituting a small fire place in his dressingroom, which last plan had dawned on his mind as the probablest escape from the piano forte&#x2014;another <hi rend="italic">week</hi> they were messing <hi rend="italic">there</hi>&#x2014;Carlyle unable to sleep in the new room&#x2014;not for noise&#x2014;his <hi rend="italic">stuffed</hi> window shutters fastened on with as many screws and bolts as if they were for the windows of a mad house almost wholly exclude all noise from the street&#x2014;but merely from the nervousness always incident with him on &#x201C;finding himself in a new position&#x201D;&#x2014; There were wanderings about during the night&#x2014;fires kindled with his own hands, bread and butter eaten in the china-closet!&#x2014;all sorts of what shall I say-strange things upon my honour done&#x2014;and I all the while lying awake listening with a bouncing heart but <hi rend="italic">afraid</hi> to meddle with him&#x2014;even to offer any assistance&#x2014;then the sort of days sure to follow that sort of nights!
I will not try to describe&#x2014;to have overlived them was botheration enough,&#x2014;no sooner were the workmen out of the dressing room than back he must be moved bag and baggage into his old bedroom&#x2014;and at this point of the business I caught a fine rheumatism in the back of my head and shoulders&#x2014;in consequence of spending a whole forenoon in papering the broken parts of the plaster and all the afternoon of the same day in nailing carpets&#x2014; &#x2014;<hi rend="italic">that</hi> is a thing that Helen <hi rend="italic">can not</hi> do&#x2014;and the hands of me are absolutely blackened and coarsefied with the quantity of it I have had to transact this season&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; To make the mess still thicker the dining-room grate which you may remember was a perpetual source of execration was finally voted insupportable for another twentyfour hours&#x2014; &#x2014;another must be got&#x2014;and then&#x2014;as all our things are never to be made like other peoples but on some superior plan of our own&#x2014;the new gratewith cover of dutch tiles&#x2014;needed ever so much of the chimney to be pulled down and a man building and plastering at it for two days and a half&#x2014;of course all the carpets and furniture of that beautifully clean room had to be removed also&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; <supplied>[Ten]</supplied> days ago I nailed down the carpets of <hi rend="italic">it</hi>&#x2014;and readjusted the things and today I have nailed down all the stair and passage carpets&#x2014;at last!&#x2014;there is still a good piece of work for me in the front bedroom which will be all the fitter for your and our visitors reception in consequence of what it has undergone&#x2014; <pb id="pg-17-160" n="17:160"/>but if he had only allowed me to do these things when I was about it in the summer it would have spared a world of <foreign>fash</foreign> [bother]&#x2014;and such a sickening feeling towards &#x201C;household good&#x201D; as I do not remember ever in my life before to have experienced&#x2014; I am physically ill of the long continued discomfort and the cinderella labours in which I have had to put forth the activity of a maid of all-work&#x2014;along with improvisation and inventive-faculty of a woman of genius&#x2014; &#x2014;The fact is I have spoiled M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C&#x2014;I have accustomed him to have all wants supplied &#x201C;without visible means&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. the legal phrase applied to vagrants: &#x201C;without visible means of support.&#x201D;</note>&#x2014;until he has forgotten how much head and hands it takes to supply the common resource of a good round outlay of money When one had not any money&#x2014;it was all well&#x2014;I never grudged my work&#x2014;but now that we have enough to live on it would be good sense in him to say &#x201C;get in a carpenter to nail your carpets&#x201D; and a few other such considerate suggestions&#x2014;no matter&#x2014;I shall get my hands kept clean and put into mitts for a time so soon as I have patched together a carpet for the new bedroom&#x2014;and will be on the sofa by heaven for two weeks and read french novels!</p>

<salute>Dear Jamie,</salute>
<p>Notwithstanding my unspeakable haste at this moment, I must not neglect to announce the good news that our two Barrels of good things from Scotsbrig arrived safe this morning about 11 o&#x2019;clock. The charge of carriage was some pence under twelve shillings; which, for a carriage of 200 and odd miles transacted with such despatch, must be admitted to be cheap enough. We are right glad to see the meal especially; and shall try it tonight if we prosper! The Ferguses of Kirkcaldy <pb id="pg-17-161" n="17:161"/>had already some weeks ago volunteered to send us a Box of meal, but unluckily they had introduced a few bottles of whisky into it; so the whole, we conclude, has been seized at the Customhouse, and we dare not make the smallest inquiry about it!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Whisky imported into England was taxed; see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18360118-TC-MAC-01"><sic>8:283</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1836-01-18">18 Jan. 1836</date></corr></ref>.</note> We had never heard of the business; till Miss Fergus wrote to us, making a timid inquiry about it.</p>
<p>I broke up these Barrels; saw all manner of things looking quite snug; but had to run upstairs to my work again, and have yet heard no farther accounts. Jane was very proud of her pease scon. The skins, at least the one I saw of them, was a most effectual-looking article, and the colour very tolerable,&#x2014;what may be called <hi rend="italic">good</hi>, tho&#x2019; buff would have been preferred. Jane seemed to be at a kind of loss for the moment as to the <hi rend="italic">three</hi> pots of butter: but I think it is specified in your former Note; which is in John&#x2019;s hand at present, and will be got from him tomorrow night, when he is to be here, if not sooner. There was a small scattering of <hi rend="italic">chaff</hi>, or chips of straw, that had got thro&#x2019; upon the top of the meal; a newspaper without holes should be spread over the head of all, by way of finish, in such cases; if that were packed well in, and then delicately lifted off, there would not even a flawn of chaff get in. Mind that another time! It may be interesting also to know that the meal &#x26;c by the shaking of the journey had sunk nearly six inches from the lip of the barrel.&#x2014; &#x2014; In short, dear Brother, all is right and well; and we are very glad of it, and very greatly obliged to you. Jane proposes keeping the meal in the very barrel where it is: if that be not right, you can let us know, and we will shift it; but I think it <hi rend="italic">is</hi> right. Jenny&#x2019;s warm flannels will likewise be welcome, now at the mouth of Winter. We, like you, have had hard frosts, then again clear mild weather, and today we have rain and <foreign><hi rend="italic">glar</hi></foreign> [mud].</p>
<p>Jack was here last night; brisk and well: he is about writing to Dumfries today, about having a Letter from Jean got ready for Alick on or before the <hi rend="italic">third</hi> of Next Month: it will not do later; the <hi rend="italic">third</hi> is Thursday if any of you take a thought of writing. Clow&#x2019;s address is &#x201C;Alton, Wayne county, State of New York&#x201D;; you pay a shilling along with the Letter. But I doubt none of you will write!</p>
<p>Next week, or perhaps this, I will send a Letter to my Mother; I will try if I can find a little more time than I have today! It is very right that she is going to have Jessie Austin with her,&#x2014;if Jessie be not too light in the bone?<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >She was nine.</note> Somebody to light the fire, and run little errands in a quiet way, is indispensably necessary in winter.&#x2014;I am not doing any great feats in the way of work yet; but stirring nevertheless, or trying to stir! Jane sends her love to Isabella and our Mother; my <pb id="pg-17-162" n="17:162"/>blessings are with all of you always. <closer><salute>And so <foreign>adieu</foreign> dear Brother / Your affectionate</salute></closer> <name>T.

<p>I ran away from London into Bristol and South Wales, when the heats grew violent, at the end of <date when="1843-06-00">June</date>. South Wales, North Wales, Lancashire, Scotland: I roved about everywhere seeking some Jacob&#x2019;s-pillow<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Gen. 28:11.</note> on which to lay my head and dream of things heavenly;&#x2014;yes that at bottom was my modest prayer, tho&#x2019; I disguised it from myself: and the result was, I could find no pillow at all; but sank into ever meaner restlessness, blacker and blacker biliary gloom, and returned in the beginning of <date when="1843-09-00">September</date> thoroughly eclipsed and worn out, probably the weariest of all men living under the sky. Sure enough I have a fatal talent of converting all Nature into Preternaturalism for myself: a truly horrible Phantasm-Reality it is to me; what of heavenly radiances it has, blended in close neighbourhood, in intimate union, with the hideousness of Death and Chaos;&#x2014;a very ghastly business indeed! On the whole, it is better to hold one&#x2019;s peace about it.&#x2014; I flung myself down on sofas here,&#x2014;for my little Wife had trimmed up our little dwellingplace into quite glorious order in my absence, and I had only to lie down: there, in reading books, and other make-believe employments, I could at least keep silence, which was an infinite relief. Nay gradually, as indeed I anticipated, the black vortexes and deluges have subsided; and now that it is past I begin to feel myself better for my travels after all. For one thing, articulate speech having returned to me,&#x2014;you see what use I make of it.</p>
<p>On the table of the London Library, voted in by some unknown <pb id="pg-17-163" n="17:163"/>benefactor whom I found afterwards to be Richard Milnes, there lay one thing highly gratifying to me: the last two Numbers of the <hi rend="italic">Dial</hi>. It is to be one of our Periodicals henceforth; the current Number lies on the table till the next arrives; then the former goes to the Binder; we have already, in a bound volume, all of it that Emerson has had the editing of. This is right. Nay in Edinburgh, and indeed wherever ingenuous inquisitive minds were met with, I have to report that the said Emerson could number a select and most loving public; select, and I should say fast growing: for good and indifferent reasons it may behove the man to assure himself of this. Farther, to the horror of poor Nickisson (Bookseller Fraser&#x2019;s Successor), a certain Scoundrel interloper here has reprinted <hi rend="italic">Emerson&#x2019;s Essays</hi> on greyish paper to be sold at two shillings,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Either <hi rend="italic">Twelve Essays</hi> (<date when="1843-00-00">1843</date>) pbd. by W. Tweedie, or <hi rend="italic">Essays</hi> (<date when="1844-00-00">1844</date>) pbd. by William Smith, 113 Fleet St. and advtd. in the <hi rend="italic">Athenaeum</hi>, <date when="1843-10-07">7 Oct.</date>, as &#x201C;just added&#x201D; to the &#x201C;Fifty Popular Works&#x201D; of Smith&#x2019;s Standard Library.</note>&#x2014;distracting Nickisson with the fear of change! I was glad at this, if also angry: it indicates several things. Nickisson has taken his measures, will reduce the price of his remaining copies; indeed he informs me the best part of his edition was already sold, and he has even some colour of money due from England to Emerson thro&#x2019; me! With pride enough will I transmit this mournful noble peculium; and after that, as I perceive, such chivalrous international doings must cease between us.
<hi rend="italic">Past and Present,</hi> some one told me, was in spite of all your precautions straightway sent forth in modest grey, and your benevolent speculation ruined.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson had written to publishers in New York and Philadelphia, and had printed an &#x201C;American Editor&#x2019;s Notice&#x201D;: &#x201C;This book is printed from a private copy in manuscript, sent by the author to his friends &#x2026; and is published for his benefit. I hope this notice &#x2026; will persuade every well disposed publisher to respect his property in his own book.&#x201D; On <date when="1843-10-30">30 Oct.</date> he wrote to TC: &#x201C;I believed &#x2026; I had &#x2026; succeeded in repelling the pirates. But in the fourth or fifth week appeared a mean edition in N. York published by one Collyer &#x2026; sold for 12&#xBD; cents and of this wretched copy several thousand were sold, whilst our 75 cent edition went off slower.&#x201D; William H. Colyer, a N.Y. printer, pbd. pirated edns. in <date when="1843-00-00">1843</date> and <date when="1845-00-00">1845</date>. Little &#x26; Brown were the authorized publishers.</note> Here too, you see, it is the same. Such chivalries therefore are now impossible; for myself I say, &#x201C;Well let them cease; thank God they once were, the memory of that can never cease with us!&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>
<p>In this last Number of the <hi rend="italic">Dial</hi>, which by the bye your Bookseller never forwarded to me, I found one little Essay, a criticism on myself,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson&#x2019;s review of <hi rend="italic">Past and Present, The Dial</hi> <date when="1843-07-04">4 (July 1843)</date>:96&#x2013;102.</note>&#x2014;which, if it should do me mischief, may the gods forgive you for! It is considerably the most dangerous thing I have read for some years. A decided likeness of myself recognisable in it, as in the celestial mirror of a friend&#x2019;s heart; but so enlarged, exaggerated, all <hi rend="italic">transfigured,</hi>&#x2014;the <pb id="pg-17-164" n="17:164"/>most delicious, the most dangerous thing! Well, I suppose I must try to assimilate it also, to turn it also to good if I be able. Eulogies, dyslogies, in which one finds no features of one&#x2019;s own natural face, are easily dealt with; easily left unread, as stuff for lighting fires, such is the insipidity, the wearisome <hi rend="italic">non</hi>entity of <foreign>pabulum</foreign> like that: but here is another sort of matter! &#x201C;The beautifullest piece of criticism I have read for many a day,&#x201D; says every one that speaks of it. May the gods forgive you.&#x2014; I have purchased a copy for three shillings, and sent it to my Mother: one of the <hi rend="italic">indubitable</hi> benefits I could think of in regard to it.</p>
<p>There have been two friends of yours here in these very days: Dr Russell just returning from Paris; Mr Parker, just bound thither.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Le Baron Russell (d. <date when="1889-00-00">1889</date>), a Harvard graduate, largely responsible for the American publication of <hi rend="italic">Sartor Resartus;</hi> see Slater, <hi rend="italic">CEC</hi> 16&#x2013;17. An engineer then, he was now a physician. Theodore Parker (<date when="1810-00-00">1810</date>&#x2013;<date when="1860-00-00">60</date>), unitarian clergyman and abolitionist of Boston, Mass., the liberality of whose sermons and writings had caused criticism by fellow ministers and the resignation of members of his congregation. He was traveling in Europe, <date when="1843-09-00">Sept.</date> to <date when="1844-09-00">Sept. 1844</date>, and returned to resign his pastorate and become minister of the Twenty-Eighth Congregational Society of Boston, <date when="1845-01-00">Jan. 1845</date>.</note> We have seen them rather oftener than common, Sterling being in Town withal. They are the best figures of strangers we have had for a long time; possessions, both of them, to fall in with in this pilgrimage of Life. Russell carries friendliness in his eyes, a most courteous modest intelligent man; an English intelligence too, as I read, the best of it lying unspoken, not as a logic but as an instinct. Parker is a most hardy, compact, clever little fellow, full of decisive utterance, with humour and good-humour; whom I like much. They shine like suns, these two, amid multitudes of watery comets and tenebrific constellations, too sorrowful without such admixture on occasion!</p>
<p>As for myself, dear Emerson, you must ask me no questions till&#x2014;alas, till I know not when! After four weary years of the most unreadable reading, the painfullest poking and delving, I have come at last to the conclusion that I <hi rend="italic">must</hi> write a Book on Cromwell; that there is no rest for me till I do it. This point fixed, another is not less fixed hitherto, That a Book on Cromwell, is <hi rend="italic">impossible</hi>. Literally so: you would weep for me if you saw how, between these two adamantine certainties, I am whirled and tumbled. God only knows what will become of me in the business. Patience, Patience!</p>
<p>By the bye, do you know a &#x201C;Massachusetts Historical Society,&#x201D; and a James Bowdoin, seemingly of Boston?<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly James Temple Bowdoin (d. <date when="1844-00-00">1844</date>), nephew and heir of James Bowdoin (<date when="1752-00-00">1752</date>&#x2013;<date when="1811-00-00">1811</date>), Boston merchant and American minister to Spain, <date when="1804-00-00">1804</date>&#x2013;<date when="1808-00-00">8</date>. The Mass. Historical Society Collections pbd. the latter&#x2019;s correspondence from abroad and the Bowdoin family papers.</note> In &#x201C;vol II. third series&#x201D; of <pb id="pg-17-165" n="17:165"/>their &#x201C;Collections&#x201D; lately I met with a disappointment almost ludicrous. Bowdoin, in a kind of dancing embarrassed style, gives long-winded painfully minute account of certain precious volumes containing &#x201C;Notes of the Long Parliament&#x201D; which was in the New York Library; poises them in his assaying balance, speculates, prophesies, inquires concerning them: to me it was like news of the lost Decades of Livy:<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Titus Livius (<date>59 <hi rend="small-caps">b.c.</hi></date>&#x2013;<date when="0017-00-00">17 <hi rend="small-caps">a.d.</hi></date>), whose history of Rome was in 142 books (or fourteen &#x201C;decades&#x201D;), only some of which survived.</note> Good Heavens, it soon became manifest that these precious volumes are nothing whatever but a wretched broken old dead <hi rend="italic">Ms.</hi> copy of part of our printed <hi rend="italic">Commons Journals</hi>, printed since <date when="1745-00-00">1745</date>, and known to all barbers! If the Historical Society desired it, every Member of Parliament could procure them the whole stock, <hi rend="italic">Lords</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Commons</hi>, a wheelbarrowful or more, with no cost but the carriage. Every member has the right to demand a copy, and few do it, few will let such a mess cross their doorthreshold! This of Bowdoin&#x2019;s is a platitude of some magnitude.<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See TC&#x2019;s scornful note on this error, <hi rend="italic">Cromwell, Works</hi> 9:287.</note> &#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; &#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Emerson.

(<date when="1747-00-00">1747</date>&#x2013;<date when="1766-00-00">66</date>). TC cites the five-vol. second edn.

<p>In these weeks it has become manifest to me, after four years of the dreariest reading ever read, that I must actually write something on Cromwell and Puritanism, and get myself delivered from it. No more impossible task ever fell to my lot. I have already tried it successively on ten or twenty different tacks, and been everywhere repelled; and up to this hour I but write and burn, and then write again, very miserably.

<salute>My dear good Mother,</salute>
<p>You will put up with a very small unsatisfactory Letter, instead of a long and pleasant one which I did mean to write you; I can do no more today, and alas that is little enough! But a word should verily, and shall verily go, to apprise you merely that we are all well, and ask if you are all well.</p>
<p>My little upper room far out of the noise of pianos was finished near a fortnight ago; and this is the second week I have wrote in it. Alas, no &#x201C;room&#x201D; will serve my turn entirely at present! I cannot get <hi rend="italic">into</hi> the subject at all; and do but keep puddle-puddling, writing things and then burning them,&#x2014;and am in short very uncomfortable indeed! This is the reason I write so short to you: I do not like to speak or write to any one at all in this vile state of fret, and pitiful frustration and inability to get on at all, that I am now in.&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; But indeed it <supplied>[is]</supplied><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> but the old story. I am always like a <foreign><hi rend="italic">spavined</hi></foreign> horse, a poor old hack that does nothing but hobble and <foreign><hi rend="italic">tevel</hi></foreign> [act confusedly], never stirring from the spot, till its old joints have got <hi rend="italic">heated</hi>. I must just <foreign><hi rend="italic">tevel</hi></foreign> away here, and you must all have patience with me; by and by I <hi rend="italic">shall</hi> get under way, and then my dear Mother shall hear better news of me.</p>
<p>My little room here is such a curiosity as you have seldom seen; a place projecting off from my bedroom, about 7 or 8 feet square, papered on the walls, with a window in it which looks out upon trim gardens, trees and houses at a distance,&#x2014;and now with a fireplace, a shelf of books, my writing-table and a chair: here I sit, lifted above the noise of the world, <hi rend="italic">peremptory</hi> to let no mortal enter upon my privacy here; and really I begin to like it. You never saw such a fireplace in your life; a little register grate let into the wall, as neat as a snuff-box, and really not much bigger than a porridge bowl; but it takes up its smoke like a little hero, and keeps the place as warm as a pie,&#x2014;so warm that I oftenest sit with the door of it open, and communicate with the bedroom too. Could I but get my work to go forward! But at present it is like founding houses on bottomless quagmires; every stone when I have lugged it to the place is swallowed in unknown depths of <foreign><hi rend="italic">gludder</hi></foreign> [mire].&#x2014; Patience! Courage!</p>
<p>Jack was here last night for a little while; well and hearty. The reason why Alick does not write I take to be that he has got no fixed place or scheme yet; that he is somewhat as I now am, and feels quite reluctant <pb id="pg-17-168" n="17:168"/>to write. Jean sent a Letter for him, which I addressed, with a word or two of my own, and forwarded by the last Steamer.</p>
<p>You are to tell Jamie that better meal was never made; nor better ham,&#x2014;we wish we had a constant allowance of the latter! Isabella&#x2019;s butter too cannot be beaten:&#x2014;in short all is right and successful there; but I will write myself by and by.&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; Jane had a <hi rend="italic">stiff neck</hi> last week; but has shaken it off again, and is out at present: a clear sharp day (after muddy rains), it looks like the beginning of frost.</p>
<p>Dear Mother, will you let us know how you really are. I never dare believe that you are well. I also want to know so many other particulars! Tell me for one thing if you have got your rents paid, if you have <foreign><hi rend="small-caps">mall in shaft</hi> <hi rend="italic">stievely</hi></foreign> [everything firmly in working order]! Jane will send you &#x201C;a word,&#x201D; many a word! <foreign>Adieu</foreign> dear good Mother. May God&#x2019;s blessing be ever on you all. <closer><salute>Your affectionate</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Here is a Letter just come from Alick, which I lose not a moment in forwarding to you.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On the cover John Carlyle wrote: &#x201C;I have read the enclosed very hastily having been out till within a quarter of an hour of post time &#x26; now I must walk with it to a more central post two miles off. Jean will forward it when she has read it &#x26; sent it to the Gill, and told them there about it. J A Carlyle.&#x201D;</note> Poor Alick is well, and writes like one endeavouring to do well; tho&#x2019; still in much dubiety as to his future course. Jenny and one of the little children seem to have had an ugly fit of sickness, fever-and-ague, of which the people in that quarter, Alick says, make very light: I hope it may be a <hi rend="italic">seasoning to the new climate</hi>, and the prognostic of better health for time coming. But of all news there is non<supplied>[e so]</supplied> welcome to me as that of the <supplied>[end of whisk]</supplied>y! That well ended, I shall predict that all good things may begin.&#x2014;</p>
<p>At one time I thought of sending this direct to Jean, as you are hardly like <supplied>[to]</supplied> get it on the Sabbath <hi rend="italic">night;</hi> and perhaps she might have it read, and lying waiting for you as soon as the Monday Newspaper can be called for. But I will not cut off your chance, knowing how anxious you are.&#x2014; I will write to Jean that she may look for it instantly after Wednesday,&#x2014;for she too is anxious.</p>
<p>We are all well dear Mother; glad to hear from Jean yesterday that <pb id="pg-17-169" n="17:169"/>the little Austin<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mary Austin&#x2019;s da. Jessie.</note> is with you. Our love to Jamie, Isabella, and all of them. <closer><salute>Your affectionate</salute></closer></p>

He is a fine companion from his intelligence valour &#x26; worth, and is &#x26; has been a very beneficent person&#x201D; (Slater, <hi rend="italic">CEC</hi> 347).

Thought heaped up to top-heaviness and inevitable lopsidedness, but more interesting thought to me than comes from any other quarter of Europe. Interesting for the man&#x2019;s sake whom it shews. According to my notion Carlyle is the very best interpreter of spiritual philosophy which could be devised <hi rend="italic">for this age</hi>. &#x2026; Just to think of a <hi rend="italic">Scotchman</hi> with a heart widened to German spiritualities! &#x2026; You don&#x2019;t look upon Calvinism as a fact at all, wherein you are to my mind philosophically infirm, and impaired as to your universality. I can see in Carlyle&#x2019;s writing the advantage his familiarity with this fact gives him over you with a general audience. What is highest in Carlyle is built upon that lowest. At least so I read&#x201D; (quoted in F. O. Mathiessen, <hi rend="italic">The James Family</hi> [New York, <date when="1947-00-00">1947</date>] 42&#x2013;43).

<salute>Dear Jean,</salute>
<p>I surely owe you a word; I will send you a word even now, tho&#x2019; a short one!</p>
<p>Your Letter to Alick was duly addressed and forwarded: the complete address is: &#x201C;Alton, Wayne County, State of New York,&#x201D; and you have to <hi rend="italic">hand</hi> it in to the Postmaster, and pay him some trifle for it. I <pb id="pg-17-170" n="17:170"/>also delivered Jack his Letter; his Address is: &#x201C;6. Brompton Row, Brompton, London.&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC was mistaken; 6 Brompton Row was a grocer&#x2019;s address; John&#x2019;s landlady, Elizabeth Bone, was listed at 6 Brompton Grove.</note> But if you forget anything at any time, and think I remember it,&#x2014;of course, why not apply to me! It is a &#x201C;small request.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Since the despatch of Alick&#x2019;s Letter, indeed yesterday morning, no farther gone, there has come to me a Letter from Alick himself, dated <date when="1843-10-13">13<hi rend="italic">th</hi> Oct<hi rend="italic">r</hi></date>, and I think not posted till about the <date when="1843-10-17">17<hi rend="italic">th</hi></date>. It is a long full Letter; I at first had thoughts of sending it straight off to <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, but considered that Scotsbrig and our Mother had the real right to the first chance of it; so after an inspection from Jack it was sent off thither, with injunction to be straightway forwarded to you; accordingly you are like to have it in the course of the week,&#x2014;then they at Gill will like to see it: after which it can come to Chelsea again, that we may more deliberately inspect it. My thought of our Mother&#x2019;s anxiety made me perhaps too impatient: the Letter is at Ecclefechan this (Sunday) evening; but probably they have small chance to get it for a day or two.</p>
<p>Alick&#x2019;s best piece of news is that he has entirely renounced whisky; may the Heavens grant it altogether literally true! In other respects he does not seem to be making much definite progress as yet, but is only inquiring in what <hi rend="italic">direction</hi> he shall try it. Of course in every direction there are difficulties, and each too has its special conveniences: a most confused account to settle! He has had a disagreeable lameness in his foot; but is now better. Jenny and one of the lassies (Jessie, I think) were lying ill of fever-and-ague at his return from Canada,&#x2014;poor creatures! They are now, he seems to say, in a distinct state of recovery. &#x201C;The people there think nothing of the disease.&#x201D; He sees Clow almost every night. He&#x2014; But you will see the Letter yourself; I need not occupy more of this poor paper with it.</p>
<p>My health here is not bad; is better than when you saw me: all other things too are well enough&#x2014;but my work, my work! I am floundering on the <hi rend="italic">oustide</hi> of my poor work, and cannot yet for my life get <hi rend="italic">into</hi> it! I shall just have to keep floundering and boring till I do get at it; there is no other course. But in the meanwhile I am very unhappy; I cannot write Letters, or do any thing, but go gloomily about, and &#x201C;work aye maistly in a place by mysel&#x2019;!&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350128-TC-JCA-01"><sic>8:21</sic><corr>TC to JCA, <date when="1835-01-28">28 Jan. 1835</date></corr></ref>. TC must nevertheless have recently written to the Rev. Henry Sutton of the parish of High Laver (Moreton, Chipping Ongar) about the Masham family&#x2019;s mansion of Otes, since he quotes Sutton&#x2019;s reply in <hi rend="italic">Cromwell, Works</hi> 6:100, the original of which, dated <date when="1843-11-13">13 Nov. 1843</date>, is in FC ff. 177r. and v.; see also TC&#x2019;s note f. 41v.</note>&#x2014; You must just excuse me, dear friends, till the better days come.&#x2014;</p>
<p><pb id="pg-17-171" n="17:171"/>Jack was here the other night, and since that I met him at the Library<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The London Library.</note> and he is to be here again this evening. He looks very lively; seems busy reading &#x26;c, and flies extensively about: he is well lodged,&#x2014;and will come to some result by and by, we hope.&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; Jane has not got her Dumfries present yet; the young woman Grierson was to <hi rend="italic">bring</hi> it down some day, and is still expected. Jane pronounced her to be &#x201C;immensely improved&#x201D; since she first appeared in London, and really a sensible useful looking young person.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Miss Grierson who had come to London in <date when="1842-00-00">1842</date>; possibly a da. of James&#x2019;s sister Mary and his cousin Robert Grierson, rather than TC&#x2019;s relative as suggested at <ref target="volume-14/lt-18420630-TC-JCA-01"><sic>14:211</sic><corr>TC to JCA, <date when="1842-06-30">30 June 1842</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014; <foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Jean; good be with James &#x26; you and all that is yours. I will scribble you a word now and then in spite of my confusions. <closer><salute>I am ever Your affectionate</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name></p>
<ps><p>The adjacent Piano has been got regulated, put under conditions. Nay I have a nice little closet now, 7 feet square, with a fireplace in it, about the size of a saucepan, where I can write on occasion, silent from all pianos, and street noises. I am now in it.</p></ps>

And oh if you know what a grand object one&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">ease</hi> becomes for one; when there is absolutely <hi rend="italic">no ease</hi> to be had for love or money. It <hi rend="italic">may</hi> be an egoistical exaggeration but I cannot help thinking that I have been of late months one of the most <hi rend="italic">worried</hi> of modern wives. I do not mean the most <hi rend="italic">ill-used</hi> by men or things&#x2014;thank Heaven no!&#x2014; I have always the &#x201C;consolation&#x201D; which <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;No</hi> 3&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cheyne Row.</note> found so efficacious under the the death of her lover, that &#x201C;she <pb id="pg-17-172" n="17:172"/>knew several women who had been still more afflicted by Providence than herself!&#x201D; &#x2014;but I say the most <hi rend="italic">worried</hi>&#x2014;the most teased with petty annoyances&#x2014;not one of which <hi rend="italic">singly</hi> would seem worth the consideration of the <hi rend="italic">philosophic</hi> mind, but such an accumulation of them, like the packthreads of the Lilliputians<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <hi rend="italic">Gulliver&#x2019;s Travels</hi> 1.1.</note> induces &#x201C;a certain&#x201D; desperation! Nor do I foresee when the worry will get itself fairly ended&#x2014;any more than when <hi rend="italic">the Life of Cromwell</hi> will get itself&#x2014;fairly begun! All that has been done&#x2014;and <hi rend="italic">that</hi> is not little&#x2014;has not yet cleared away the <hi rend="italic">material</hi> impediments to writing. The little study at the top of the house with its <foreign>wee</foreign> curiosity of a grate&#x2014;with the writing table transferred to it&#x2014;with a cast of Oliver Cromwell&#x2019;s face&#x2014;taken after death&#x2014;fixed up on the wall&#x2014;is <hi rend="italic">admitted</hi> to be <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;warm&#x2014;light</hi>&#x2014;and as <hi rend="italic">silent</hi> as the heart of man can desire,&#x201D; but &#x201C;it is an abominable confined hole of a place&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;one cannot have one&#x2019;s books about one there&#x2014;one spends half one&#x2019;s time in running between it and the Library&#x201D;&#x2014;and then <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;the paper</hi> is a perfect solecism! it would need to be new <hi rend="italic">papered</hi> in some reasonable way before one could feel it anything but the <hi rend="italic">last refuge of a poor reduced</hi> beggar!!&#x201D;
&#x201C;Well then let it be new papered!&#x201D; &#x201C;Oh no&#x2014;that will have to lie over till <hi rend="small-caps">you</hi> can get it done when <hi rend="italic">I</hi> am away somewhere&#x201D;&#x2014; In fact the cruelty of having no place in which a man can write is the burden of his morning and evening song&#x2014;and the nice Library is only an eternal source of lamentation&#x2014; &#x201C;Such a large comfortable room rendered perfectly uninhabitable by an accursed pianoforte&#x201D;!&#x2014;and so we move up and down thro the house&#x2014;trying ourselves there and then trying it here&#x2014;and no where can any adjustment be affected&#x2014;a sort of domestic, <hi rend="italic">wandering Jew</hi> he is become!&#x2014; A gleam of hope has arisen for us since last night that it may finally be rendered possible for him to fix himself in the Library&#x2014; The piano&#x2014;to say the truth has been nothing like so deadly as it was in the beginning&#x2014; Ever since the protest was sent in, the Misses Lambert have testified a certain respect for our feelings, <hi rend="small-caps">trying</hi>&#x2014;with more or less success&#x2014;to abstain from playing till two o&#x2019;clock&#x2014;which was the compromise he proposed to make with them&#x2014; But they seem tempted as often as they pass the seductive &#x201C;instrument&#x201D; to tinkle out of it a few <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;town</hi>-notes wild&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Milton, &#x201C;L&#x2019;Allegro&#x201D; 134.</note> or run over a scale or two, just as if in saying to themselves &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">le bon tempts viendra</hi></foreign> [the good time will come]&#x201D;!&#x2014; If he had the confidence which results to most of us from repeated experience&#x2014;he would rely on it by this time that their passion would lead them into no further excesses, and could hardly feel disturbed by such transient aberrations&#x2014; But he has an inveterate tendency that poor man always to <hi rend="italic">hope the worst</hi>&#x2014;and so if <pb id="pg-17-173" n="17:173"/>&#x201C;the accursed <hi rend="italic">thing</hi>&#x201D; sounds at all, he expects that it will go on sounding for hours, and when it terminates, he expects that it will presently recommence&#x2014;thus it is <hi rend="italic">fear</hi> of the piano more than <hi rend="italic">the piano</hi> that drives him into the &#x201C;beggars refuge&#x201D; up stairs. During a week however&#x2014;they have scarcely except on Wednesday (lesson day) <hi rend="italic">committed any nuisance</hi> before the appointed hour&#x2014;not I believe that they have been more self-sacrificing than usual, but that they have been making more morning visits&#x2014; However it might be; a bright thought struck Carlyle that he would take this plausible moment for sending Miss Lambert a copy of his last book with a pretty letter of thanks for the attention she was showing to his wishes and of eloquent entreaty that she would go on with the same observance of the two oclock system during his present labours. To be such a single hearted man, he <hi rend="italic">can</hi> word such things with a delicacy, an insinuating poetry of expression sure to reach the heart of a plump young damsel like Miss Lambert!&#x2014;and so the same evening brought a note from her as ecstatic as his own&#x2014;promising implicit observance&#x2014;I will enclose it here that you may see the foundation of the hope of a <hi rend="italic">settlement</hi> which I said had dawned on our minds since last night&#x2014; The &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">love</hi> to M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle&#x201D; indicates a young lady still in the first enthusiasm of her faith in human nature!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >She wrote, <date when="1843-11-11">11 Nov.</date>, signing herself Mary Emily Lambert.</note>
She has spoken with M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle just <hi rend="italic">twice</hi> on this planet&#x2014;one day the two sisters found me in a shoe shop, rushed up to me, as if minded to embrace me decidedly&#x2014;but it went no further than a shaking of hands&#x2014;owing to my backwardness who in the darkness of the shop and the dazzle produced by their painted velvet scarfs&#x2014;could not at first tell the least in the world whom it was I was transacting even the lesser ceremony of shaking hands with&#x2014;&#x201C;It was such a long time&#x201D; they said &#x201C;since they had been dying to speak to me!&#x2014; <hi rend="italic">Would</hi> I call for them?&#x2014;they should be so delighted&#x201D;!&#x2014; I promised any thing to get my boots fitted on in peace&#x2014;but when it came to performance as Homer says &#x201C;terrible was the thought to me&#x201D;!<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A recurring formulaic utterance.</note>&#x2014; Determined to carry their point however about a week after finding I did not call on them they &#x201C;took the <hi rend="italic">Initiative</hi>&#x201D; and called on <hi rend="italic">me</hi>&#x2014;fine <hi rend="italic">healthy chatty</hi> girls!&#x2014; I left a card for them one day in passing&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">having seen them go out a little while before</hi>&#x2014;this is all the passages of friendship that have taken place betwixt us&#x2014;a sturdy groundwork for <hi rend="italic">love!</hi> However I will accept their love and even <hi rend="italic">do the impossible</hi> to reciprocate it if they will only be quiet in the mornings&#x2014; Considering the clatter I make about my troubles it is odd&#x2014;is it not?&#x2014;that I should not be more liberal of <hi rend="italic">thanksgiving</hi> when any of them is removed. I have reflected several <pb id="pg-17-174" n="17:174"/>times with wonder at my own forgetfulness that I had always in writing to you forgotten to say a word to you of the blessed deliverance from John. He established himself in a Lodging near Gambardella&#x2019;s on the morning of the day when Carlyle was to return from Scotland&#x2014; Plainly Carlyle and he had been getting on very badly together at Scotsbrig, and he made it a point of honour to be in <hi rend="italic">a place of his own</hi> when they should meet again&#x2014;for he never seemed to <hi rend="italic">think</hi> of any change till Carlyle had fixed his day&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">me</hi> he seemed to consider as there entirely for his convenience so long as he pleased&#x2014;which I was glad of on the whole&#x2014;for ill as I liked to have him I should have liked worse had he taken such a grand step during <hi rend="italic">my</hi> incumbencey. As it was, Carlyle saw in his sudden removal a &#x201C;natural shame of facing <hi rend="italic">him</hi> again on that absurd principle after all his magnanimous assertions on being able to manage his own life without help or advice from any one&#x201D;&#x2014;and was moreover heartly glad to find the coast clear&#x2014;for he did not know any more than I had done how another spell of him in his actual <hi rend="italic">distracted</hi> state was to have been endured&#x2014;
He comes here very seldom&#x2014;and never stays long&#x2014;<foreign>flaffs</foreign> [flaps] about in the old fashion among indifferent people&#x2014;seems to me a very absurd figure in Gods working world&#x2014;but so long as he keeps his absurdity so well out of our road we have no business to interfere with him&#x2014; If he does not choose to practice his profession or do any but study his own bachelor comforts and <hi rend="italic">eat the dinners which Carlyle declines</hi>&#x2014;for that seems to be the principle on which he is invited out&#x2014;&#x201C;since we cannot get Carlyle we may always have his <hi rend="italic">brother</hi>,&#x201D; one may <hi rend="italic">regret</hi> that a man of some talent&#x2014;and certainly without any <hi rend="italic">vice</hi> should so waste himself&#x2014;but he is not a child that he should be lectured for it&#x2014;so enough of him&#x2014;</p>
<p>I had a nice letter from Maggie the other day for which I was duly thankful&#x2014; Pray do write to me oftener when you are at home again&#x2014; This winter is going to be for me what I predicted the last would be and was not a time of dreadful tribulation with that book&#x2014; Already he is beginning to get up and smoke during the nights and his irritability and unsettledness in that state of nerves is something that cannot be figured but by those who have witnessed it However I hope I am more <hi rend="italic">seasone</hi><supplied>[<hi rend="italic">d</hi>]</supplied><note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> now than I was during the writing of <hi rend="italic">the French Revolution</hi>&#x2014;thank God, tho we have now our <date when="0000-11-00">November</date> fogs and the air is intensely cold I keep free of coughs hitherto and can come down to breakfast <hi rend="italic">at any hour</hi>&#x2014;neither have I any pain in my side&#x2014;but <hi rend="italic">well?</hi> <foreign>Ach gott</foreign>&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">that</hi> were too much to ask!&#x2014;bad nights and a continual malaise thro the day keep my spirits in a state of depression which the less that I say or think about the better&#x2014;</p>

<salute>Dearest Susan</salute>
<p>Do you not find me wonderful?&#x2014; I declare to you I am a living mystery even to myself! when I stop to consider about myself and my ways (which I make a point of doing as seldom as possible) I am struck with a sort of stupor &#x201C;as in presence of the Infinite&#x201D;!&#x2014;the Infinite&#x2014;Absurd!&#x2014; Just to think that your letter should have been all this time unacknowledged and I so glad to get it! and loving you <pb id="pg-17-176" n="17:176"/><hi rend="italic">always</hi> so truly!&#x2014; Let us hope, for the credit of human-nature that such instances of inconsistency are rare! nay, that <hi rend="italic">I</hi> am the <hi rend="italic">only</hi> modern woman who &#x201C;paves such vast extent of <hi rend="italic">the bad place</hi> with good intentions&#x201D;!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Proverbial.</note>&#x2014; There is but one salvation for me, and that is to do always the thing which I ought to do <hi rend="italic">in the first possible moment</hi>&#x2014;if ever I wait for a <hi rend="italic">probable</hi> moment, no mortal, and least of all myself, can predict <hi rend="italic">when</hi> it will be got done&#x2014;if ever!&#x2014;the letter which I do not write by <hi rend="italic">return of post,</hi> seems to pass out of the sphere of my own volition into the sphere of Fate or Chance (however one calls that power lying outside one&#x2019;s own skin which urges one this way and that) and so it is the will of that supreme and highly capricious Power that I should write to you just to-day of all days; when, with a slight headach, cross&#x2014;(as our <date when="0000-11-00">november</date> fog alwa<supplied>[y]</supplied>s<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> makes me) and with an uneasy consciousness of&#x2014; &#x2014;a sewing-girl at work in the house(!) there would have been no lack of pretexts for putting off one day longer what I had already put off so long!</p>
<p>Your letter found me just in the thick of unpacking and putting by my husband&#x2014;the un<hi rend="italic">pack</hi>ing was got accomplished within a reasonable time but the <hi rend="italic">putting by</hi>&#x2014; Oh <hi rend="italic"><foreign>Dio!</foreign>&#x2014;that</hi> has proved a work of some difficulty&#x2014;and has kept my hands full-up to the present hour!! The whole period of his absence I was as busy as a <hi rend="italic">Slave of the Lamp</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In the <hi rend="italic">Arabian Nights</hi>.</note> in making this old house bloom up into new consciousness and comelinesses to charm his soul and senses at his return&#x2014;the quantity of needlework alone which I accomplished in the shape of chaircovers sofa-covers all sorts of covers&#x2014;was enough to put Penelope<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Wife of Ulysses.</note> for ever out of peoples heads as the model of industry and to set up M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Thomas Carlyle in her place.&#x2014; And to be sure for three days the man was in &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">a certain</hi>&#x201D; admiration over the improved state of things especially over his new-papered newcarpeted&#x2014;new-everythinged Library&#x2014;but on the fourth day the young Lady of next house took one of her fits of <hi rend="italic">practising</hi>&#x2014;whereupon he started up and declared in a peremptory manner to the Universe that &#x201C;he neither would nor could write, or think, or <hi rend="italic">live</hi> anylonger, alongside of <hi rend="italic">that accursed thing&#x201D;!</hi>&#x2014; In pursuance of which resolution the Carpenter (the last man on earth I was wishing to see in a hurry again) was summoned to hold deep consultation on all the possibilities and impossibilities of the case&#x2014;and the practical result thereof was a new household earthquake, little inferior in awfulness to that which I had just got so thankfully to the end of! up went all the <pb id="pg-17-177" n="17:177"/>carpets which my own hands had nailed down for twelve months at least&#x2014;in rushed the troop of incarnate demons&#x2014;bricklayers, joiners, whitewashers &#x26;c whose noise and dirt and dawdling had so lately driven me to despair&#x2014;down went a partition in one room up went a new chimney in another&#x2014; Helen instead of exerting herself to stem the torrent of confusion seemed to be struck (no wonder) with a temporary idiocy&#x2014;and my husband himself at sight of the uproar he had raised was all but wringing his hands and tearing his hair&#x2014;like the German Wizards servant who had learnt magic enough to make the broomstick carry water for him but had not the counter-spell to stop it!&#x2014; Myself would have sat <hi rend="italic">down</hi> and cried&#x2014;so little strength or spirit I had left to front the pressure of my circumstances&#x2014; &#x2014;but crying makes no way,&#x2014;so I went about <hi rend="italic">sweeping</hi> and <hi rend="italic">dusting</hi> as an example to Helen&#x2014;and <hi rend="italic">held my peace</hi> as an example to my husband&#x2014;who verily as Mazzini says of him &#x201C;loves silence somewhat <hi rend="italic">platonically</hi>&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410706-JWC-TC-01"><sic>13:171&#x2013;72</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1841-07-06">6 July 1841</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014; It was got thro in the end&#x2014;this new hubbub&#x2014;but when my husband proceeded to occupy his new study he found that Devil a bit he could write in <hi rend="italic">it</hi> any more than beside the piano&#x2014; &#x201C;it was all so strange to him&#x201D;!
The fact is the thing he has got to write&#x2014;his long projected life of Cromwell&#x2014;is no joke&#x2014;and no sort of <hi rend="italic">room</hi> can make it easy&#x2014; And so he has been ever since shifting about in the saddest way from one room to another like a sort of domestic wandering Jew!&#x2014; He has now a fair chance however at getting a settlement effected <hi rend="italic">in the original Library</hi>&#x2014;the young Lady next door having promised to abstain religiously from playing till two &#x2019;oclock, when the worst of his day&#x2019;s work is over&#x2014;generous young Lady! but it must be confessed, the seductive letter he wrote to her the other day was enough to have gained the heart of a stone&#x2014; Alas! one can make fun of all this on paper but in practice it is anything but fun I can assure you&#x2014;there is no help for it however&#x2014; A man cannot hold his genius as a sinecure&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>
<p>He was much <hi rend="italic">touched</hi> with your observation of him thro&#x2019; the telescope!<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See TC&#x2019;s notes to <ref target="volume-17/">JWC to TC, [<date when="1843-09-06">6 Sept.</date></ref>].</note>&#x2014;and it was not his fault that he did not manage better about seeing you&#x2014; He had not made up his mind about going to Dundee in time for me to warn you and he thought to have had <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the Tuesday to see you in but it so happened that M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Erskines horses were sent away that day to fetch home some carriage and he could not <hi rend="italic">walk</hi> the distance short tho&#x2019; it was, having hurt his ancle by a fall from a horse at Kircaldy&#x2014; It was a pity that he did not see you in your own house&#x2014;as much in this world is!</p>
<p>Where was I at with my <hi rend="italic">Mudies</hi> when you left London?&#x2014; Had I <pb id="pg-17-178" n="17:178"/>got the <hi rend="italic">two</hi> disposable girls places at Manchester?&#x2014; First the one and then the other I took to the Railway myself and sent off with a nice outfitting and my blessing&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; Well! the last sent is back already&#x2014;having <hi rend="italic">prefered</hi> to return and starve here&#x2014;or do worse&#x2014;to conducting herself in a reasonable way where she was&#x2014; She was lazy, heedless and <hi rend="italic">dirty</hi> to a degree&#x2014;and when her mistress tried to remonstrate with her she <hi rend="italic">lay down on the floor and kicked and screamed!</hi>&#x2014; So she was dismissed and when my kind Geraldine Jewsbury had found a home for her till she should get her one more trial in a place&#x2014;but the young lady informed her that her Mother wished her to return &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">if we pleased</hi>&#x201D;&#x2014;and that she expected to be companion to a Captains widow&#x201D;!&#x2014;we fear it was rather to a Captains self&#x2014;for Juliet had told me of some officer that was in love with her Sister&#x2014; The Mother I fear is quite lost to all right feelings if ever she had any&#x2014;</p>
<p>Juliet the one you saw is behaving herself excellently well&#x2014; I had a letter from her mistress to tell me so the other day&#x2014; I wash my hands of all the rest&#x2014;they are <hi rend="italic">unhelpable</hi>&#x2014;the last curse that can befall humanity&#x2014;</p>
<p>Old Sterling has come in to take me a drive&#x2014;so I must stop sooner than I was meaning&#x2014; God bless you Dear Susan&#x2014; I love you always&#x2014; Remember me to your husband kindly</p>

<p>I had sent out &#x2018;Past and Present&#x2019; I think in the early part of this summer,<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Pbd. <date when="1843-04-24">24 April</date>.</note> and then gone on a lengthened tour of expected &#x2018;recreation&#x2019; into Wales (to my poor friend Redwood at Llandough, Cowbridge, there), thence to Carmarthen (three days) to the Bishop of St. David&#x2019;s there, days mostly wet; thence by Malvern to Liverpool; met my brother, and with him to North Wales (top of Snowdon cloaked in thick mist on our arrival there)&#x2014;at Bethgellert and Tremadoc deluges of rain, &#x26;c, &#x26;c.&#x2014;back to Liverpool, and thence to Annandale for three weeks; after all which home to Chelsea, as noticed in this letter; all the subsequent details of which rise gradually into clearness, generally of a painful nature to me. The fittings and refittings for me full of <pb id="pg-17-179" n="17:179"/>loving ingenuity, the musical young lady other side the wall; the general dreary and chaotic state of inward man while struggling to get &#x2018;Cromwell&#x2019; started, all this and the bright ever-cheering presence in it, literally the only cheering element there was, comes back into my heart with a mournful gratitude at this moment.</p>
<p>&#x2018;The Mudies&#x2019; were two grown daughters of a Mr. Mudie whom I recollect hearing of about <date when="1818-00-00">1818</date> as a restless, somewhat reckless, and supreme schoolmaster at Dundee. He had thrown up his function there in about <date when="1820-00-00">1820</date>, and marched off to London as a literary adventurer. Here for above twenty years he did manage to subsist and float about in the &#x2018;mother of dead dogs,&#x2019;<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Grub St. journalism; see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18320110-TC-JAC-01"><sic>6:87</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1832-01-10">10 Jan. 1832</date></corr></ref>.</note> had even considerable success of a kind; wrote a great many miscellaneous volumes mostly about natural history, I think, which were said to display diligence and merit, and to have brought him considerable sums. But by this time the poor fellow had broken down, had died and left a family, mostly daughters, with a foolish widow, and next to no provision whatever for them. The case was abundantly piteous, but it was not by encouragement from me, to whom it seemed from the first hopeless, that my dear one entered into it with such zeal and determination.
Her plans were, I believe, the wisest that could be formed, and the trouble she took was very great. I remember these Mudies&#x2014;flary, staring, and conceited, stolid-looking girls, thinking themselves handsome, being brought to live with us here, to get out of the maternal element, while &#x2018;places&#x2019; were being prepared for them; but no amount of trouble was, or could be, of the least avail. The wretched stalking blockheads stalked fatefully, in spite of all that could be done or said, steadily downwards toward perdition, and sank altogether out of view. There was no want of pity in this house. I never knew a heart more open to the sufferings of others, and to the last she persisted in attempts at little operations for behoof of such; but had to admit that except in one or two small instances she had done no good to the unfortunate objects she attempted to aid.&#x2014; <name>T.

<salute>Dear Emerson,</salute>
<p>About this time probably you will be reading a Letter I hurried off for you by Dr Russell in the last Steamer; and your friendly anxieties <pb id="pg-17-180" n="17:180"/>will partly be set at rest.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson had asked, <date when="1843-10-30">30 Oct.</date>, why TC had not written.</note> Had I kept silence so very long? I knew it was a long while; but my vague remorse had kept no date! It behoves me now to write again without delay; to certify with all distinctness that I have safely received your Letter of the <date when="1843-10-30">30 Oct<hi rend="italic">r</hi></date>, safely the Bill for Twenty-five pounds contained it;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >From his American booksellers.</note>&#x2014;that you are a brave friendly man, of most serene beneficent way of life; and that I&#x2014;God help me!&#x2014;</p>
<p>By all means appoint this Mr Clark to the honorary office of account-keeper,&#x2014;if he will accept it!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >E. P. Clark, a cashier at the New England Bank, Boston. Emerson wrote, <date when="1843-10-30">30 Oct.</date>: &#x201C;I have never yet done what I have tho&#x2019;t this &#x26; the last week seriously to do, namely, to charge the good &#x26; faithful E. P. Clark a man of accounts as he is a cashier in a Bank, with the total auditing, and analysing of these accounts of yours. My hesitation has grown from the imperfect materials which I have to offer him to make up so long a story. But he is a good man, &#x26; do you know it? a Carlylese of that intensity that I have often heard he has collected a sort of album of several volumes, containing illustrations of every kind, historical, critical, &#x26;c. to the Sartor. I must go to Boston &#x26; challenge him. Once when I asked him, he seemed willing to assume it.&#x201D; The album is at the Harvard College Library (Slater, <hi rend="italic">CEC</hi> 347).</note> By Parker&#x2019;s<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Theodore Parker.</note> list of questions from him, and by earlier reminiscences recalled on that occasion, I can discern that he is a man of lynx eyesight, of an all-investigating curiosity: if he will accept this sublime appointment, it will be the clearest case of elective affinity.
Accounts to you must be horrible; as they are to me: indeed I seldom read beyond the <hi rend="italic">last</hi> line of them, if I can find the last; and one of the insupportabilities of Bookseller Accounts is that nobody but a wizard, or regular adept in such matters, can tell where the last line, and final net result of the whole accursed babblement, is to be found! By all means solicit Clark;&#x2014;at all events, do you give it up, I pray you, and let the Booksellers do their own wise way. It really is not material; let the poor fellows have length of halter. Every new Bill from America comes to me like a kind of heavenly miracle; a reaping where I never sowed, and did not expect to reap: the quantity of it is a thing I can never bring in question.&#x2014; For your English account with Nickisson I can yet say nothing more;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Than in <ref target="volume-17/lt-18431031-TC-RWE-01">TC to RWE, <date when="1843-10-31">31 Oct.</date></ref></note> perhaps about Newyearsday the poor man will enable me to say something. I hear however that the Pirate has sold off, or nearly so, his Two-shillings Edition of the <hi rend="italic">Essays</hi>, and is preparing to print another; this, directly in the teeth of Cash and double-entry book-keeping, I take to be good news.</p>
<p>James is a very good fellow, better and better as we see him more&#x2014; Something shy and skittish in the man; but a brave heart intrinsically, with sound earnest sense, with plenty of insight and even humour. He <pb id="pg-17-181" n="17:181"/>confirms an observation of mine, which indeed I find is hundreds of years old, that a stammering man is never a worthless one. Physiology can tell you why. It is an excess of delicacy, excess of sensibility to the presence of his fellow creature, that makes him stammer. Hammond L&#x2019;Estrange says, &#x201C;Who ever heard of a stammering man that was a fool?&#x201D; Really there is something in that.&#x2014; James is now off to the Isle of Wight; will see Sterling at Ventnor there; see whether such an Isle or France will suit better for a winter residence.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James&#x2019;s nervousness led to a breakdown the following spring. His recovery was helped by studying Swedenborg. Hamon L&#x2019;Estrange (<date when="1605-00-00">1605</date>&#x2013;<date when="1660-00-00">60</date>), historian and theologian, said of Charles, &#x201C;There was never, or very rarely, a fool that stammered&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">The Reign of King Charles</hi> [<date when="1655-00-00">1655</date>] 1, which TC had borrowed from the London Library, <date when="1843-10-10">10 Oct.</date>, and which he returned <date when="1846-07-18">18 July 1846</date>). Emerson wrote to John Sterling, <date when="1843-10-15">15 Oct.</date>, that James, &#x201C;a man of ingenious and liberal spirit, and a chief consolation to me when I visit his city, proposes to spend a winter in England with his family, for his health and other benefit, and desires to see you&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">A Correspondence between John Sterling and Ralph Waldo Emerson,</hi> ed.

<p>W. E.

That Poem <hi rend="italic">on Death</hi> is the utterance of a valiant noble heart, which in rhyme or prose I shall expect more news of by and by. But at bottom &#x201C;Poetry&#x201D; is a most suspicious affair for me at present! You cannot fancy the oceans of Twaddle that human creatures emit upon me, in these times; as if when the lines had a jingle in them, a Nothing could be something, and the point were gained! It is becoming a horror to me,&#x2014;as all speech without meaning more and more is. I said to Richard Milnes, &#x201C;Now in honesty what is the use of putting your accusative <hi rend="italic">before</hi> the verb, and otherwise entangling the syntax; if there really <hi rend="italic">is</hi> an image of any object, thought, or thing within you, for God&#x2019;s sake let me have it the <hi rend="italic">shortest</hi> way, and I will so cheerfully excuse the <hi rend="italic">omission</hi> of the jingle at the ends: cannot I do without that!&#x201D;&#x2014; Milnes answered, &#x201C;Ah, my dear fellow, it is because we have no thought, or almost none; a little thought goes a great way when you put it into rhyme!&#x201D; Let a man try to the very uttermost to <hi rend="italic">speak</hi> what he means before <hi rend="italic">singing</hi> is had recourse to. Singing, in our curt English speech, contrived expressly and almost exclusively for &#x201C;despatch of business,&#x201D; is terribly difficult. Alfred Tennison, alone of our time, has proved it to be possible in some measure. If Channing will persist in melting such obdurate speech into musi<supplied>[c]</supplied> he shall have my true wishes,&#x2014;my augury that it will take an enormo<supplied>[us]</supplied> <hi rend="italic">heat</hi> from him!&#x2014; Another Channing, <pb id="pg-17-182" n="17:182"/>whom I once saw here, sends me a Progress-of-the-Species Periodical from New York.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Henry Channing (<date when="1810-00-00">1810</date>&#x2013;<date when="1884-00-00">84</date>), American unitarian clergyman, nephew of William Ellery Channing the elder (<date when="1780-00-00">1780</date>&#x2013;<date when="1842-00-00">1842</date>), and ed. of <hi rend="italic">The Present</hi>, a socialist magazine, <date when="1843-00-00">1843</date>&#x2013;<date when="1844-00-00">44</date>, whom TC had met in <date when="1836-00-00">1836</date> (see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18361105-TC-RWE-01"><sic>9:81</sic><corr>TC to RWE, <date when="1836-11-05">5 Nov. 1836</date></corr></ref>).

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Your Letter came exactly a week ago, much to our joy; Steamer is going off tomorrow, and I, tho&#x2019; in great haste tonight, must write you a few words. We had got into considerable impatience to hear from you; do not be remiss in writing! Remember that for the next four months there is only one packet per month; ascertain what is the day of despatch, and be punctual in hitting it. Our good Mother especially is overjoyed with a Letter from you: if no word come, you know what her anxieties are like to be.</p>
<p>That very day your Letter came, having shewn it to Jack, I despatched it for Scotsbrig; I have a short Note since acknowledging with delight that they had got it directly: &#x201C;one of the Gill lassies was coming over thro Ecclefechan (on the Sunday evening it was), she called at the Post-Office, and got it.&#x201D; Our good Mother is &#x201C;spinning yarn for stockings,&#x201D; very busy, and as well as we could hope her to be. There is a small line in her own hand, a written blessing from her: the body of the Note had been written by Isabella. This Gill lassie is come over to stay thro&#x2019; the winter months, or some part of them, till some other succeed her, with our Mother. The rest are all in &#x201C;their usual way&#x201D;; Jenny is at Gill; has shirts &#x26;c to make. This is my latest news.&#x2014; In the beginning of this Month a long Letter from Jean went off to you, with a small word in the corner from me: a more minute account of all Scotch matters was in that.</p>
<p>You seem to have had your share of disaster, dear Brother; yet happily nothing irremediable as yet, since you went into that new country. &#x201C;Every town,&#x201D; it is a true saying, &#x201C;has a <foreign><hi rend="italic">dub</hi></foreign> [puddle] at the end of it.&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Scottish proverb; see <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340408-TC-MCA-01"><sic>7:129</sic><corr>TC to MCA, <date when="1834-04-08">8 April 1834</date></corr></ref>.</note> It was a provoking business that of the sore leg, when you had so much need of all your faculties;&#x2014;and to find poor Jenny and the poor <foreign>bairn</foreign> lying ill at your return! Jack thinks it may have been <hi rend="italic">damp</hi> in the house you are inhabiting; he earnestly counsels you to look after this,&#x2014;and not to sleep on the ground-floor, but in an upper story if there is one. We hope the poor patients are got out of the business now; that you are all getting seasoned to the new way of life, and may have that command of health which you so particularly need at present. Canada and Canandaigua appear alike to have their drawbacks, every place will be found to have drawbacks and advantages: you will <pb id="pg-17-184" n="17:184"/>have studying enough before you can decide! Of course we cannot give you the smallest counsel; except again to urge that you should look out for a healthy place, above all. Good neighbours you are not to look for all at once; probably in the worst places they will turn up better than you expect at first. We hope at least that Mr Clow&#x2019;s fate for <hi rend="italic">this winter</hi> will have already settled itself; that you know by this time whether your house is your own or not.&#x2014; The joyfullest news to all of us, which of itself would outweigh a whole burden of mischances, is what you say <supplied>[about]</supplied><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> the Teetotal habit! Nothing that I have heard for many months has given me half the pleasure. Once fairly parted from that insidious diabolic enemy I have no fear for my brave brother. Mistake itself will teach him new wisdom; he will front his difficulties with calm clear manhood; ascertain <hi rend="italic">what</hi> and <hi rend="italic">how</hi> they are, on what side they are to be taken up; and conquer them whatever they are! I predict so with true confidence and satisfaction. Somewhere or other you will find an eligible piece of Mother Earth; you do know how to plough and till the Earth, and Earth honestly tilled will not fail to give you due increase. By God&#x2019;s blessing, and man&#x2019;s faithful endeavour, it shall all be tolerably well before long. You have the whole winter to familiarize yourself with the scene of operations; a hard clear frost we understand the weather to <supplied>[be]</supplied>:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> by the time of casting in the seed, you will probably have decided, and be ready to start. One feels as if a &#x201C;place of one&#x2019;s own&#x201D; would be the more cheerful way of it: but you can judge better; you alone can judge. And so Heaven guide you to a good choice, dear Brother; and then with health and heart there is no fear. Courage, Courage!&#x2014;</p>
<p>As for us here in London we are steering along, without notable rubs, in the old fashion; and have much to be thankful for, nothing that it were fair to complain of. I have begun a new Book,&#x2014;or rather, alas, I am still but struggling to begin one, and it will not prosper yet; which is of all operations the ugliest known to me. But I must stand to it; with or without hope, stand to it! By and by the mud settles; one finds hard footing somewhere, after infinite plunging; and then it goes along. My Book is to be on Oliver Cromwell and the old Puritans of England, analogous to our Scotch Covenanters. It will be horribly difficult; but in due time I do hope to send you a Copy: I send always one Copy to America (Friend Emerson lives at Boston in New England), but now this to my Brother will be two! There is plenty of reviewing and confused uproar about me; but that literally is <hi rend="italic">nothing;</hi> I find my only safe course is to go on as if it were not there.&#x2014; Had you once a settled <pb id="pg-17-185" n="17:185"/>place, we will send you out a Box some time, and all manner of sundries in it!</p>
<p>Jack lives not far from us here, in handsome convenient lodgings; seems always very busy, with books &#x26;c &#x26;c: we see him duly every Sunday evening. He looks healthy and brisk; by and by, we consider, he will settle to something definite: at all events he is now in no man&#x2019;s way.&#x2014;</p>
<p>Jane sits reading by the lamp at the fireplace behind me here in this upstairs room; she sends her blessing to you one and all. She is in good health hitherto, and fronts the winter under fair auspices. It is a great comfort to think that you are near Clow. Pray give him my very kind regards; may good ever follow him. I desire also to be remembered to Mr Wightman,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified, but a hedger named Wightman had been a neighbor at Hoddam Hill in <date when="1826-00-00">1826</date>; see <ref target="volume-04/lt-18260513-TC-JBW-01"><sic>4:88&#x2013;89</sic><corr>TC to JBW, <date when="1826-05-13">13 May 1826</date></corr></ref>.</note> whose one visit to me I can very well recollect. Dear Brother, my sheet is done; and it seems as if I had still so much to say! Trade is better with us than it was; Corn, by their sliding-scale, <note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Import duties on grain were based on a sliding scale as of <date when="1828-00-00">1828</date>, making them higher when domestic grain was plentiful.

O&#x2019;Connell has Ireland in a great ferment; yet no public disturbance is at all apprehended there for the time.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >O&#x2019;Connell had begun another series of monster demonstrations in Ireland, <date when="1843-10-01">1 Oct.</date> He and others were then charged and their trial set for <date when="1844-01-15">15 Jan. 1844</date>.</note>&#x2014;
Jamie has sent us up his winter Barrel of meal; Isabella was reported to be a little better, but does not seem to acknowledge much of it,&#x2014;we suppose it is very trifling (Turn to the beginning) You must remember me as an affectionate uncle to Jane and Tom, and the other younger branches. Tell Tom that I expect to find him a rugged piece of stuff (not to discredit the name) when I come over. Of Jane as a nice wise Lassie everybody reports. Be kind to Jenny and them; stand all truly by one another! <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign> dear Brother, and may God ever bless you!</salute></closer></p>
<name>T. Carlyle</name>
<ps><p>When you see Mr Greig, offer him my kind regards, and thanks for the Letter I got from him. It came in good season; at a time when we had otherwise no news from you. If he can do you good, there is no doubt he will be ready to try.</p>
<p>Jack complains that he has written thrice to you, and got no answer; <hi rend="italic">he</hi> would have written half of this Letter, could I have undertaken to carry the sheet up to him tomorrow in time. You will write to him next, or soon.</p></ps>

<p><salute>Uncle dear!</salute> How are you? I kiss you from ear to ear&#x2014;and I love you very considerably; &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">hopping to find you in the same</hi>.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The spirit moves me to write to you just at this <hi rend="italic">unlikeliest</hi> moment (for <hi rend="italic">my</hi> spirit is a contradictory spirit) when the Influenza has left me with scarce faculty enough to spell words of more than one syllable I caught the horrid thing a week ago&#x2014;by Destiny&#x2014;thro no indiscretion of my own&#x2014;which is a consolation of a certain sort&#x2014;for it does form a most &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">aggravating</hi>&#x201D; ingredient in ones suffering to be held <hi rend="italic">responsible</hi> for it, to be told, &#x201C;this comes of your going to such a place, or doing such a thing&#x2014;if you had taken <hi rend="italic">my</hi> advice &#x26;c &#x26;c&#x201D;! But this time I had been going nowhere&#x2014;doing nothing in the least degree questionable&#x2014;the utmost <hi rend="italic">lark</hi> I had engaged in for months being to descend at <hi rend="italic">Granges</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sarah Grange, confectioner, 176 Piccadilly.</note> (Babbie knows the place) in the course of my last drive with old Sterling and there refresh exhausted nature with a hot jelly and <hi rend="italic">one</hi> modest sponge-cake! It would have been no harm I think had the Influenza taken, instead of temperate me, a <hi rend="italic">personage</hi> who <hi rend="italic">sat</hi> on the next chair to us at the said Grange&#x2019;s and before whose bottomless appetite all the surrounding platefuls of cakes disappeared like <foreign><hi rend="italic">reek</hi></foreign> [smoke]! His companion who was <hi rend="italic">treating</hi> him finally snatched up a large pound-cake cut it into <foreign><hi rend="italic">junks</hi></foreign> [thick pieces] and handed him one after another on the point of a knife till <hi rend="italic">that</hi> also had gone <foreign><hi rend="italic">ad plura</hi></foreign> [in addition]&#x2014;the <hi rend="italic">Dog</hi>(!) for it was with a dog that I had the honour of lunching that day; appeared to consume poundcake as my Penfillan Grandfather<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Welsh; see <ref target="volume-16/lt-18430722-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1843-07-22">22 July</date>]</ref>.</note> professed to eat cheese &#x201C;purely for <hi rend="italic">diversion</hi>&#x201D;!&#x2014; By the way it must have been a curious sight for the starved beggars who <pb id="pg-17-188" n="17:188"/>hang about the doors of such places to see a <hi rend="italic">dog</hi> make away with as much <hi rend="italic">cake</hi> in five minutes as would have kept <hi rend="italic">them</hi> in <hi rend="italic">bread</hi> for a week or weeks! bad enough for them to see human beings neither bonnier, perhaps, nor wiser, nor, except for the clothes on their backs, in any way better than themselves eating hot jelly and such like delicacies while they must go without the necessaries of life&#x2014;but <hi rend="italic">a dog!</hi>&#x2014;really <hi rend="italic">that</hi> was stretching the injustice to something very like <hi rend="italic">impiety</hi> it strikes me. I should like to know the name of &#x201C;the Gentleman as belonged to that <hi rend="italic">dog</hi>&#x201D;&#x2014;he seemed by his equipments and bearing a person holding some rank in the world besides the generical rank of <hi rend="italic">fool</hi>; and should one find him some other day maintaining in Parliament that &#x2018;all goes well&#x2019;&#x2014;it would throw some light on the worth of his opinion to know that <hi rend="small-caps">his</hi> <hi rend="italic">dog</hi> may have as much pound-cake at Grange&#x2019;s as it likes to eat!</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">That</hi> however was the last social fact which I witnessed having been since laid up at home; and part of the time in bed.&#x2014; I do not know why the solitude of a bedroom should be so much more solitary than the solitude of other places&#x2014;but so I find it&#x2014; When my husband is at work I hardly ever see his face from breakfast till dinner, and if it rains or often ever when it does not rain; no living soul comes near me to speak one cheerful word&#x2014;yet so long as I am in what the french call my &#x201C;room of reception&#x201D; it never occurs to me to feel lonely&#x2014;but send me to my bedroom for a day to that great red bed in which I have transacted so many headachs so many <hi rend="italic">influenzas!</hi> and I feel as if I were already half buried!&#x2014; Oh so lonely! as in some intermediate stage betwixt the living world and the dead! I sometimes think that were I to remain there <hi rend="italic">long</hi>, I should arrive in the end at <hi rend="italic">prophecying</hi> like my great great Ancestors!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Welsh (<date when="1568-00-00">1568</date>&#x2013;<date when="1622-00-00">1622</date>), known for his prophecies, but not JWC&#x2019;s ancestor; see <ref target="volume-16/lt-18430202-JWC-JW-01">JWC to JW, [<date when="1843-02-02">2 Feb.</date>]</ref>.</note>&#x2014; <hi rend="italic">That</hi> solitude has such a power of blending Past, Present, and Future, Far and Near all into one confused jumblement&#x2014;in which I wander about like a disembodied spirit that has put off the beggarly conditions of Time and Space&#x2014;and <hi rend="italic">that</hi> I take to be a first development of the Spirit of Prophecy in one!</p>
<p>The letters of Babbie used to be no small comfort to me when I was ailing&#x2014;but Babbie since she went to Scotland has had other things to do it would seem than writing to <hi rend="italic">me</hi>&#x2014; Babbies beautiful constancy in writing has like many other beautiful things of this earth succumbed to the force of circumstances! Ah yes! what <hi rend="italic">young Lady</hi> can withstand the force of circumstances? <hi rend="italic">Circumstances</hi> are the young Lady&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Destiny!</hi>&#x2014;it is only when she has lived long enough to have tried conclusions <pb id="pg-17-189" n="17:189"/>with the <hi rend="italic">real</hi> Destiny that she learns to know the difference and learns to submit herself peaceably to the one and to say to the other&#x2014;that humbug <hi rend="italic">force of circumstances</hi>&#x2014;&#x201C;but I <hi rend="small-caps">will</hi>! <foreign><hi rend="italic">Je le veux, moi</hi></foreign> [I myself desire it]!&#x201D;&#x2014; Oh it is the grand happiness of existence when one can break thro one&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">circumstances</hi> by a strong <hi rend="italic">will</hi>, as Samson burst the cords of the Philistines!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Judges 15:12&#x2013;14.</note> Is n&#x2019;t it Uncle?&#x2014; <hi rend="italic">You</hi> should know if any man does!&#x2014;you who are&#x2014;permit me&#x2014;I mean it entirely in a complimentary sense&#x2014;so very <hi rend="italic">very</hi> wilful! But as for my sweet Babbie her volition is not yet adequate to breaking <hi rend="italic">the pack threads of the Lilliputians</hi>&#x2014;never to speak of <hi rend="italic">Cords of the Philistines!</hi> And meanwhile what can one do for her, but just what poor Edward Irving counseled certain Elders to do&#x2014;who once waited upon him at Annan to complain of the backslidings of their minister and ask his (Edwards) advice under the same. Edward having listened to their catalogue of enormities, knit his brows, meditated some moments and then answered succinctly: &#x201C;my good friends you had best <hi rend="italic">pray for him to the Lord!</hi>&#x201D;</p>
<p>My American was immensely pleased with your reception of him&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">that</hi> is the only American whom I have found it possible to be civil to this great long while&#x2014; Oh such a precious specimen of the regular Yankee I have seen since!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The first American is Le Baron Russell, who apparently visited John Welsh on his way to his ship from Liverpool; the second is unidentified.</note> Coming in from a drive one forenoon, I was informed by Helen, with a certain agitation, that there was a <hi rend="italic">strange gentleman</hi> in the Library, &#x201C;he said he had come a long way and would wait for the Master&#x2019;s coming home to dinner and I have been,&#x201D; said she &#x201C;in a perfect fidget all this while for I remembered after he was in, <hi rend="italic">that you had left your watch on the table!</hi>&#x201D; I proceeded to the Library to inspect this unauthorized Settler with my own eyes&#x2014;a tall, lean, red-herring-looking man <hi rend="italic">rose from Carlyles writing table which he was sitting writing at</hi>, with Carlyles manuscripts and private letters all lying about&#x2014;and running his eyes over me from head to foot&#x2014;said; &#x201C;Oh&#x2014; <hi rend="italic">you</hi> are M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle are you?&#x201D;&#x2014; An inclination of the head&#x2014;intended to be <foreign>hauteur</foreign> itself&#x2014;was all the answer he got&#x2014; &#x201C;Do you keep your health pretty well M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle&#x201D;? said the wretch, nothing daunted&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">that</hi> being always your regular Yankees second words&#x2014;another inclination of the head even slighter than the first&#x2014; &#x201C;I have come a great way out of my road&#x201D; said he &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">to congratulate Mr Carlyle on his increasing reputation</hi>, and as I did not wish to have my walk for nothing I am waiting till he come in&#x2014;but in case he should not come in time for me, I am just writing him a letter here at his own table as you see <pb id="pg-17-190" n="17:190"/>M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle&#x201D;! Having reseated himself without invitation of mine I turned on my heel and quitted the room determined not to sit down in it while the Yankee staid&#x2014; But about half an hour after came Darwin and M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Wedgwood<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hensleigh.</note> and as there was no fire in the room below they had to be shown up to the Library where on my return I found the Yankee, still seated in Carlyles chair, very actively <hi rend="italic">doing</hi>, as it were, the honours of the house to them!! And there he sat, upwards of another hour&#x2014;not one of us addressing a word to him&#x2014;but he not the less thrusting in <hi rend="italic">his</hi> word into all that was said&#x2014; Finding that I would absolutely make no answer to his <hi rend="italic">remarks</hi> he poured in upon me a broadside of positive <hi rend="italic">questions</hi>&#x2014; &#x201C;Does M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle enjoy good health <hi rend="italic">M</hi>rs <hi rend="italic">Carlyle?&#x201D;&#x2014; &#x201C;No!</hi>&#x201D;&#x2014; Oh he doesn&#x2019;t!&#x2014; What does he complain of <hi rend="italic">M</hi>rs <hi rend="italic">Carlyle?&#x201D;&#x2014; &#x201C;Of everything.&#x201D;!</hi> &#x201C;Perhaps he studies too hard&#x2014;does he study too hard <hi rend="italic">M</hi>rs <hi rend="italic">Carlyle?&#x201D; &#x201C;Who knows&#x201D;?</hi> &#x2014; &#x201C;How many hours a day <hi rend="italic">does</hi> he study <hi rend="italic">M</hi>rs <hi rend="italic">Carlyle?</hi>&#x2014; &#x201C;My husband does not work by the clock&#x201D;&#x2014; And so on&#x2014;his impertinent questions receiving the most churlish answers&#x2014;but which seemed to patter off the rhinoceros hide of him as tho they had been sugar-plums! At length he declared that M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle was really very long of coming, to which I replied that it would be still longer before he came&#x2014; Whereupon having informed himself as to all the possible and probable Omnibuses he took himself away leaving my two gentlemen ready to expire of laughter and me to fall upon Helen at the first convenient moment for not defending better &#x201C;the wooden guardian of our privacy&#x201D;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The door; cf. Pope, &#x201C;Lines from the Art of Sinking.&#x201D;</note></p>
<p>But really these Yankees form a considerable item in the <foreign>ennuis</foreign> of our mortal life. I counted lately <hi rend="italic">fourteen</hi> of them in one fortnight!&#x2014;of whom D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Russel was the only one that you did not feel tempted to take the poker to&#x2014; If M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle&#x2019;s &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">increasing reputation</hi>&#x201D; bore no other fruits but <hi rend="italic">congratulatory</hi> Yankees and the like I should vote for its proceeding to <hi rend="italic">diminish</hi> with all possible despatch!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Give my love to the children&#x2014;a hearty kiss to Maggie for her long letter&#x2014;for which I was also charged by M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Wedgwood to make <hi rend="italic">her</hi> grateful acknowledgments&#x2014; The governess was plainly not at all <hi rend="italic">advanced</hi> enough for M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Wedgwoods children&#x2014;but Maggies letter was a gratification to us on <hi rend="italic">its own basis</hi></p>
<p>And now dear Uncle if I have not wearied <hi rend="italic">you</hi> I have wearied <hi rend="italic">myself</hi>&#x2014;which is not at present hard to do&#x2014;for altho&#x2019; the worst of my cold is over, I suppose; I am as weak as a sparrow&#x2014;</p>
<p>I wish I knew how <hi rend="italic">you</hi> exactly are&#x2014;and what that little demoralized Babbie is doing&#x2014;for altho&#x2019; she has left my last letter unanswered <pb id="pg-17-191" n="17:191"/>for nearly three weeks I cannot help still retaining a certain tenderness for her&#x2014;</p>

The present respectable Mayor of Bury may be said, like a Fakeer (little as he thinks of it), to have his dwelling in the extensive, many-sculptured Tombstone of St. Edmund; in one of the brick niches thereof dwells the present respectable Mayor of Bury&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 10:56&#x2013;57).

<salute>Dear Jean,</salute>
<p>The day before yesterday there went away towards Edinburgh a Parcel of Books directed to your James; which are intended for his and the Scotsbrig people&#x2019;s benefit: the<supplied>[y]</supplied><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> consist of certain criticisms on me, of Dickens&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Chuzzlewit</hi>,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Martin Chuzzlewit</hi>, of which ten monthly nos. had been pbd. so far.</note> and other rubbish; particular Books or Pamphlets, one or two, are specially addressed, and will point out their several owners: the rest are a common property, to be divided amicably.

There was another Criticism, which I reckoned of some moment, by a zealous and gifted Clergyman here;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >F. D.

Maurice&#x2019;s defense was &#x201C;mainly on the ground&#x201D; that TC was &#x201C;perfectly indispensable to clergymen as showing them their ignorance, and sin, and the deep wants of the age&#x201D;; indeed Maurice read him &#x201C;because he abuses the clergy, which is the very best thing, and the friendliest thing for us&#x201D; (F.

<p>Our health here is tolerably good, except that Jane&#x2019;s skin proves too thin for the winter, and she has caught lately a little whiff of cold, which however is mostly off again.

I am well enough in health; but, alas, my work is in as beggarly a state as man&#x2019;s ever was: no road yet opening thro&#x2019; the business; nothing but desperate digging and moiling, the <hi rend="italic">banks tumbling in on me again</hi> as fast as I dig!

<p>By last post I wrote to Alick, in answer to his Letter which you saw. There are for this and the following three months no posts but one <pb id="pg-17-193" n="17:193"/>monthly, on the 4<hi rend="italic">th</hi> of each month (2<hi rend="italic">nd</hi> I suppose from Dumfries): if you wrote again it would be very welcome to Alick.</p>
<p>Jack goes about at a great rate buying Books, reading, speculating &#x26;c &#x26;c; and is always in &#x201C;immense haste&#x201D; when you see him; hearty and happy-looking withal. I think he seems to be looking towards some kind of Literature rather than Medicine. It is a mighty blessing for him that he has funds to live upon without turning to anything:&#x2014;a blessing, and yet perhaps the reverse of a blessing!</p>
<p>My neighbouring young lady has in the handsomest manner undertaken to keep her Piano silent daily till 2 o&#x2019;clock; and does so, poor little creature; so that I have got down to my old quarters again, which is far handier for me. Could I but get the ground fairly broken: ah me!&#x2014; Good night, dear Sister; my blessing with you and yours.

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Yesternight I had written the inclosed Letter for Jamie, which contains all our news (if any), and which he will read to you. But today some two hours ago Jack entered with a Letter from yourself, which I was right glad of;&#x2014;and with this Letter from Alick; which of course I send off with all despatch! You will be right glad of it, I know. Alick is well; still near Clow, and determined now to stay there over the winter.&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; Jack is to write to him <hi rend="italic">tomorrow</hi>, which will be still in time. The true day for an American Letter is the <hi rend="italic">third</hi> of every month, not the <hi rend="italic">fourth</hi> as I told Jamie; a Letter from Ecclefechan should go off on the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> of the month, to make sure; or at all events on the <hi rend="italic">morning</hi> of the 2<hi rend="italic">nd</hi>.&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; &#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; I have a small scrap to write to Jean, to whom you may send Alick&#x2019;s Letter when you have completely done with it.

<salute>Dearest Helen</salute>
<p>I will try <hi rend="italic">you</hi> with a letter this time and see whether you will not have the grace to answer, a thought sooner than that little villanous Babbie has answered my last!&#x2014; She is sure that &#x201C;my kind heart will find excuses for her&#x201D;&#x2014;the pretty phrase!&#x2014;the insinuating faithless Babbie!&#x2014; My <hi rend="italic">kind heart</hi> you may say feels flattered by her good opinion, but has too much rational work laid out for it, that it should dream of expanding itself in quixotisms like that! Far from finding excuses for <hi rend="italic">her</hi>, I find in her shortcomings excuses for all <hi rend="italic">my own</hi> shortcomings of a similar sort; past present and to come! I say to myself with the mild injured self-dignity of a <hi rend="italic">Pecksniff,</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In Dickens&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Martin Chuzzlewit</hi>.</note> &#x201C;when I fail in writing it is because I am sick, or because I am over-worked or because (as Edward Irving once wrote to me) &#x201C;the Lord has other views with his servant, than that he should write so many letters of human love<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Or &#x201C;tone&#x201D;; MS unclear.</note> as in the bygone time&#x201D;! it is never because&#x2014;I am amusing myself!&#x2014;the fact being that <hi rend="italic">I</hi> never amuse myself by any chance!&#x2014;<foreign>moi!</foreign></p>
<p>I daresay however I should not be so implacable, were it not that I have been feeling so horribly in need of letters just at the particular time thro which Babbies have failed me&#x2014; For I have been quite ill for a week or two&#x2014;with that anomalous thing which to save trouble we call Influenza&#x2014;and you who have always lived in a family can have no notion what a dreary thing it is to be all day in bed with no company but one&#x2019;s own which is little better than a death&#x2019;s head under such circumstances&#x2014; About <hi rend="italic">thrice</hi> a day&#x2014;on the average&#x2014;Carlyle pops in his head between the curtains and asks firstly &#x201C;how are you now Jane&#x201D;? secondly; &#x201C;have you had any thing to eat&#x201D;? thirdly; &#x201C;you are not thinking of getting up yet&#x201D;?&#x2014;then off to his Cromwell in which he lives, moves, and has his being<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Acts 17:28.</note> at present&#x2014;as is always the way with him when he is writing a book&#x2014; Oh dear me if all book-writers took up the business as he does, fidgeting and flurrying about all the while like a hen in the distraction of laying its first egg, and writing down every word as with his hearts blood;&#x2014;what a world of printed nonsense would be spared to a long suffering public! What a host of &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">distinguished</hi> M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> and M<hi rend="italic">rss</hi> and Misses would to the great relief of society <pb id="pg-17-195" n="17:195"/>be eating their victuals in resigned obscurity!&#x2014; Harriet Martineau used to talk of <hi rend="italic">writing</hi> being <hi rend="italic">such a pleasure</hi> to her&#x2014; In this house we should as soon dream of calling the bearing of children &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">such</hi> a pleasure&#x201D;!&#x2014; but betwixt <hi rend="italic">writing</hi> and <hi rend="italic">writing</hi> there is a difference, as betwixt the case with which a butterfly is born into the world and the pangs that attend a man-child! Well! the Cromwell will be got fairly under way by and by! and in fulness of time will by Gods blessing be got on the shelf!&#x2014; And meanwhile I am recovered from my Influenza as well perhaps without any <hi rend="italic">making of</hi> as with it&#x2014;</p>
<p>I had a precious batch of caricatures from M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Paulet lately professing to be &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">illustrations of Miss Jewsbury&#x2019;s late matrimonial speculation</hi>&#x201D;&#x2014;in my life I have seen none cleverer&#x2014;they would have made old Pestrucci himself &#x201C;in the character of <hi rend="italic">Heraclitus</hi>&#x201D; (<foreign><hi rend="italic">vide</hi></foreign> [ask] Babbie) burst into laughter!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Filippo Pistrucci.</note>&#x2014; They were sent at Geraldine&#x2019;s own request&#x2014;which was infinitely creditable to her goodnature&#x2014;for a more abused little <hi rend="italic">tick</hi> of a creature than she is represented thro&#x2019;out never figured in truth or fiction&#x2014; I will ask M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Paulet to let me show them to you&#x2014;but she charged me &#x201C;to keep them from all stranger eyes&#x201D;&#x2014;she lives always in a dreadful <hi rend="italic">apprehension of consequences</hi> that dear woman which is odd in a person who nevertheless seems not to conform to <foreign><hi rend="italic">les regles</hi></foreign> [the rules] in any one particular Geradline had been staying there and is now gone back to Manchester&#x2014;she writes to me with an assiduity and disinterestedness that verge on the superhuman<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In a letter postmarked <date when="1843-10-17">17 Oct.</date> Geraldine Jewsbury wrote to JWC: &#x201C;I have been horribly uneasy about you, for though you laugh and make witty speeches, I know the state you are in. &#x2026; You have no one who has any sort of consideration for you, and then, forsooth, you and your comfort are to be sacrificed to getting things made as comfortable as Heaven, and at small outlay of anything besides.

<salute>My Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Will you accept from me this new packet of mostly worthless <hi rend="italic">Autographs</hi>, if perchance it may amuse you for an hour. The collecting of it, as opportunity spontaneously turned up, has been a real pleasure to me, not a trouble or employment in any sense. We will keep the lion&#x2019;s-mouth still open; and when I find any contribution accumulated there, I will continue to send it you.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-17-197" n="17:197"/>Several of these Autographs, I think, are duplicates: but you can burn the second or the first, whichever you find the more worthless, and retain the other. The best part of them, as you will perceive, came to me from Mr Lockhart, Sir Walter Scott&#x2019;s son-in-law, Editor of our chief Review,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Quarterly Review</hi>.</note> a man of sound faculty and rather important position here,&#x2014;who has lately made acquaintance with your writings,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-17/lt-18430813-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1843-08-13">13 Aug.</date>]</ref>.</note> and is glad to do any civility to such a man.</p>
<p>It is now about three weeks since a new Gift of Books from you arrived safe, thro&#x2019; the assiduous Bookseller Nutt.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >David Nutt (<date when="1810-00-00">1810</date>&#x2013;<date when="1863-00-00">63</date>), 158 Fleet St., specialist in foreign books and trans.</note> Many thanks for your kindness, which never wearies! They are beautiful volumes, the outside worthy of the interior, these of your own: they stand on my shelves, in a place of honour; and, as I look at them or re-examine them, shall remind me of many things.&#x2014; <hi rend="italic">Nyerup</hi> too seems an excellent work of its kind; and shall be well read and useful to me one day.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably Rasmus Nyerup, <hi rend="italic">W&#xF6;rterbuch der Skandinavischen Mythologie</hi> penhagen, <date when="1816-00-00">1816</date>).</note> I wanted precisely such a lexicon, for those Norse Mythics. The business has had to postpone itself for the present; but is by no means finally dismissed; may it is likely to return, on occasion, for a long course of time. I often feel it to have been a great mistake this that we Moderns have made, in studying with such diligence for thousands of years mere Greek and Roman <foreign><hi rend="italic">Primordia</hi></foreign>, and living in such profound dark inattention to our own. Odin seems to me as good a divinity as Zeus, the Iomsburg is not a whit less heroic than any Siege of Troy;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Iomsburg (or Jomsburg), fortress on a hill on the island of Wolin, NW Poland; built ca. <date when="0970-00-00">970</date> by Norsemen, destroyed <date when="1098-00-00">1098</date>.</note>&#x2014; the Norse conception of this universe, the Norse operations in this universe, were as well worth singing of, and elaborating, as some others! But Greeks and Romans, I suppose, did not found Colleges for studying the <hi rend="italic">Phoenician</hi> languages and antiquities? In how many ways are we ridden as with nightmares, we poor Modern men!&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>After long sorrows and confused hesitations, I have at last sat down to write some kind of Book on Oliver Cromwell and the English Civil Wars and Commonwealth. It is the ungainliest enterprise I ever tried; grows more and more bewildering, the closer I look into it: many times I have wished it had never come athwart me; stolen already various years of ugly labour from me. But in many enterprises years of sore labour are to be sunk as under the foundations. I say and repeat to myself: St Petersburg is a noble city; and there had to perish 170,000 men in draining the Neva bogs, before the building of it could begin; <pb id="pg-17-198" n="17:198"/>under the first visible stone of Petersburg there lie 170,000 lives of men!<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Czar Peter I (<date when="1672-00-00">1672</date>&#x2013;<date when="1725-00-00">1725</date>) began the building of St. Petersburg, <date when="1703-00-00">1703</date>, in the marshes of the Neva at great cost of human life.</note> Courage!&#x2014; I must not forget to thank you for the good <hi rend="italic">Stuhr:</hi><note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-16/lt-18430205-TC-KAVE-01">TC to KAVE, <date when="1843-02-05">5 Feb.</date></ref></note> some gleams of military illumination I did get from him, which is more than I can say of several more pretentious personages.</p>

<salute>My dear Sterling,</salute>
<p>I received your kind Note, written in the hour of your departure; I received your Irish Newspaper from Ventnor, and understood it as a monition that I had permission to write to you,&#x2014;which I wished to do, but alas could not! In truth, I am very miserable at present; or call it, heavy-laden with fruitless toil; which will have much the same meaning. My abode is and has been, figuratively speaking, in the centre of Chaos; onwards there is no moving, in any yet discovered line, and where I am is no abiding:&#x2014;miserable enough! The fact is, without any figure, I am doomed to write some Book about that unblessed Commonwealth; and as yet there will no Book shew itself possible.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A. Carlyle says that Sterling wrote to JWC, <date when="1842-00-00">1842</date>, that if TC &#x201C;writes a Book about the Civil War in the spirit of his Letter to me and his printed Lectures, he will set people on cultivating warts and pimples on the face, and Milnes on calling himself a Crypto-Cromwell, and will go nigh to making the Bible fashionable&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">CMSB</hi> 271).</note> The whole stagnancy of the English genius, two hundred years thick, lies heavy on me; dead Heroes, buried under two centuries of Atheism, seem to whimper pitifully, &#x201C;Deliver us, canst thou not deliver us!&#x201D;&#x2014; <pb id="pg-17-199" n="17:199"/>and alas what am I, or what is my father&#x2019;s house? Confound it, I have lost four years of good labour in the business; and still the more I expend on it, it is like throwing good labour after bad! On the whole, you ought to pity me. Is thy servant a dead dog,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. 2 Sam. 9:8.</note> that these things have fallen on him?&#x2014; &#x2014; My only consolation is that I am struggling to be the most conservative man in England, or one of the most conservative. If the Past Time, only two centuries back, lie wholly as a torpedo Darkness and Dulness, freezing as with Medusa-glance all souls of men that look on it,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In Greek mythology Medusa&#x2019;s face turned to stone anyone who looked at it.</note> where are our foundations gone? If the Past Time cannot become <hi rend="italic">melodious,</hi> it must be forgotten, as good as annihilated; and we rove like aimless exiles that <hi rend="italic">have</hi> no ancestors,&#x2014;whose world began only yesterday! That must be my consolation, such as it is.</p>
<p>I see almost nobody, I avoid sight rather, and study at least to consume my own smoke. I wish among your buildings, you would build me some small Prophet&#x2019;s Chamber, fifteen feet square, with a separate garret and flue for smoking; within a furlong of your big house; sacred from all noises, of dogs, cocks, pianofortes and insipid men;&#x2014;engaging some dumb old woman to light a fire for me daily and boil some kind of kettle: a man might write there all day to some purpose, and cheer himself by talk all evening! But it cannot be. There is no such city of refuge, I am told, till once we get beyond the Zodiac; so in the mean time we must study to go on without it.</p>
<p>Of men or new books or things, I cannot say a word; dwelling myself so deep, with mere Chaos and old Nox. I have only seen Mill transiently once, Lockhart transiently once, and hardly any other person whose existence is of any moment to you. A man from Chancery Lane, anonymous hitherto,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> sent me a Pamphlet about the necessity of an &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Authors</hi> Publishing Society,&#x201D; in which project I hear he still persists, tho&#x2019; not entirely a fool; I also purchased for sixpence lately the first N<hi rend="italic">o</hi> of an &#x201C;Authors Institution Circular,&#x201D; or some such thing, worth less than any known coin:&#x2014;indeed there is everywhere a bodeful premonition heard that Bookselling in our sense of the business draws to its close; that <hi rend="italic">it</hi> is due some time since to Chaos again,&#x2014;and that something else must follow it.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>Did you see an American of the name of James, who went towards you? An estimable man, full of sense and honest manfulness, when you get acquainted with him. My regards to him if he is near you.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sterling replied, <date when="1843-12-07">7 Dec.</date>: &#x201C;Mr. James, your New-England friend, was here only for a few days; I saw him several times, and like him. They went, on the <date when="1843-11-24">24th</date> of last month, back to London,&#x2014;or so purposed,&#x2014;because there is no pavement here for him to walk on. I want to know where he is, and thought I should be able to learn from you.&#x201D; One of James&#x2019;s legs had been amputated because of a school-boy accident. Of Mill and Sterling, James said: &#x201C;Mr Mill was the best of the lot [of persons whom he met at the Carlyles&#x2019;], except Sterling, who was the truest man I ever met. There was a great deal of the woman in him&#x2014;a lovely person &#x2026; . Sterling was a perfectly delightful man, just the antipodes of Carlyle and the only man Carlyle had any sincere attachment to. Sterling was the only man in England who seemed like an American in spirit and manners. &#x2026; He talked freely, was jocund, very full of life, and was dying in perfect confidence, with no knowledge of the future and no beliefs. Mr. Mill was the most sincere man I ever met&#x201D; (quoted A. Warren, <hi rend="italic">The Elder Henry James</hi> [Boston, <date when="1934-00-00">1934</date>] 51).</note></p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>We have a Letter from Jean this week, who reports a visit to you, and gives us a description of what you were about. We were very glad to look in upon you in that way. Jean describes you as very well when they came; but since then (tho&#x2019; she tells us of your prohibition to mention it at all) there has been some ill turn of health; which we long greatly to hear of the removal of! I study, dear Mother, not to afflict myself with useless anxieties: but on the whole, it is much better that one know exactly how matters do stand; the very fact, no better and no worse than it is. Today there is a little Note from James Aitken, apprising us that the Books are come, that Jenny is with him: he has evidently heard nothing farther from Scotsbrig; so we will hope things may have got into their usual course again there. But Jamie or somebody may write us a scrap of intelligence surely?</p>
<p>As we heard that your old pills did not answer so well now, I got a new recipe from Jack, and took it to our Apothecary here, who is a punctual satisfactory person, and uses none but good medicines. He was directed to send you off a Box of two dozen this morning; they will arrive the night before this Note arrives; and this will serve to explain where they come from, which might otherwise be a little surprising! If they prove good, we will make the man take a Copy of the <hi rend="italic">Recipe;</hi> and always when you want more, they can be sent without the slightest trouble, and reach you in four-and-twenty hours. If they do not answer, send word directly, and Jack will try another kind.</p>
<p>This is said to be a very unhealthy season here; for the last two months about two hundred more deaths in the week have occurred than is usual at this season: but I rather conjecture it is the result of the long continued hardship the Poor have been suffering; which now, after wearing out the constitution by hunger and distress of mind, begins to tell more visibly! Our weather is very mild, soft without any great quantity of rain; and not at all disagreeable. Jane&#x2019;s cold is gone again, and we are in our common way.</p>
<p>My Book goes on badly; yet I do think it goes on. In fact, it must go: bore away at it with continual industrious boring, day and night, and it will be obliged to go! I study however not to &#x201C;split my gall&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unexplained.</note> <pb id="pg-17-204" n="17:204"/>with it; but to &#x201C;hasten slowly&#x201D; as the old Romans said.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><foreign><hi rend="italic">Festina lente</hi></foreign>, from Suetonius; see <ref target="volume-03/lt-18240125-TC-JBW-01"><sic>3:23</sic><corr>TC to JBW, <date when="1824-01-25">25 Jan. 1824</date></corr></ref>.</note> When writing will not prosper with me at all, I fling it entirely by, and go and walk many a mile in the country. I have big thick shoes, my jacket is waterproof against slight rain; I take a stick in my hand, and walk with long strides! The farther I walk the abler I grow. In fact I am rather in better health, I think, than usual, if all things are considered.</p>
<p>Jack and I had a long walk, after Tailors<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably meaning &#x201C;Henry Taylor&#x2019;s.&#x201D;</note> &#x26;c for some three hours, in the moonlight streets, last night. Today it is damp; but I am for a sally again;&#x2014;alas it is but a very poor morning-task I have done; but we cannot help it!&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; <foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear good Mother; for our sakes take care of yourself. My love to all. <closer><salute>Your affection<hi rend="italic">e</hi></salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>It is a pleasure to me to acknowledge in whatever way I can the friendliness of new friends to you in that new country far over the sea. My stock of autographs at present is rather low; a German friend<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Varnhagen von Ense.</note> got the better part of them bundled up last week;&#x2014;and they suffer much here by the inroads of &#x2018;young ladies from the country&#x2019;; not to speak of domestic perlustrations, and the element of fire!</p>
<p>It is a great good fortune for me that your Letter,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Forwarded to William Graham; see <ref target="volume-17/lt-18431220-TC-WG-01"><sic>next letter</sic><corr>TC to WG, <date when="1843-12-20">20 Dec. 1843</date></corr></ref>.</note> addressed in a foreign hand was not rejected at the door! In this tumultuous chaotic place, which will tear a man&#x2019;s time and existence to pieces, if he do not strenuously fence himself against it, one has to adopt very strong measures;&#x2014;and one of mine, grounded on doleful experience, is this, that American Letters and Parcels, except from one or two known and much valued individuals in that country, are not to be paid for, but sent travelling on their way,&#x2014;which alas is towards Chaos at any rate, in so many cases! Life is short and Art is long.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hippocrates, <hi rend="italic">Aphorisms</hi> 1.1; cf. <ref target="volume-03/lt-18240902-TC-JBW-01"><sic>3:146</sic><corr>TC to JBW, <date when="1824-09-02">2 Sept. 1824</date></corr></ref>.</note> But perhaps, after all, this is too savage a decision; surely, in the present case, but for a lucky accident, I should have been severly punished for it. On another occasion pray put your Initials on the back of the Letter.</p>

<p>My Wife returns you many thanks and good wishes.</p>
<p>In great haste I prefer to answer this on the spur of the moment; I hope to find, thro&#x2019; some Bookseller or otherwise, some conveyance that will not be too dilatory.</p>

<salute>Dear Mr. Graham,</salute>
<p>Two nights ago I received your letter; with much satisfaction to hear that your health stood moderately good for this winter, that you were still holding on with heart and hope, and like a friend thinking of your old friends. My Brother shall know one of these evenings the pleasant news that his prescriptions have been beneficial to you; I miss him sometimes when I call; but he comes regularly here on Sunday Evening. His address is &#x201C;6. Brompton Grove, Brompton, London&#x201D;; about a mile from this, by one of our roads up to town. He is in good health; always brisk and alert, studious of other things, I think, than medicine, at present. A letter from you will be a treat to him.</p>
<p>Yesterday that sheet here inclosed was delivered me from Mr. Johnstone of New York; I straightway forwarded the required Autographs to Dr. Sprague,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Buell Sprague (<date when="1795-00-00">1795</date>&#x2013;<date when="1876-00-00">1876</date>), congregational clergyman, Albany, N.Y. and collector of pamphlets, MSS, and autographs.</note> a watery popular divine, as I have learned, in <pb id="pg-17-206" n="17:206"/>those parts;&#x2014;and now having done with that affair, I will send the Document to you, as perhaps worth your perusal: you need not return it.

<salute>Dear Craik,</salute>
<p>Can you out of your <hi rend="italic">Beatson</hi> or any other source ascertain for me indisputably who was &#x201C;Lord Privy Seal&#x201D; in the year <date when="1536-00-00">1536</date>?<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Beatson, <hi rend="italic">A Political Index to the Histories of Great Britain and Ireland,</hi> 3 vols. (Edinburgh, <date when="1786-00-00">1786</date>). Thomas Cromwell (<date when="1485-00-00">1485</date>?&#x2013;<date when="1540-00-00">1540</date>) was lord privy seal in <date when="1536-00-00">1536</date>; see below.</note> Also if there is any light anywhere to be had about one &#x201C;Thrumblebye,&#x201D; seemingly a Lincolnshire rebel in those days, perhaps a member of the &#x201C;Pilgrimage of Grace&#x201D; on the Yorkshire borders? This latter question, of Thrumblebye, is not momentous: do not give above a few instants to <hi rend="italic">it</hi>.</p>
<p>I am at a kind of fix as to Cromwell&#x2019;s genealogy! A certain &#x201C;Richard Crumwell&#x201D; does evidently write (I saw the original Letter yesterday) to the &#x201C;Lord Privy Seale,&#x201D; and sign himself &#x201C;your humble <hi rend="italic">nepheu</hi>,&#x201D; in dating &#x201C;Stamford Saturday,&#x201D; no year or month; but treating about rebellion and this Thrumblebye. Here, if our Lord Privy Seal be Cromwell Earl of Essex, is one fact.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Richard or Sir Richard Cromwell, great-grandfather of Oliver Protector, was &#x2026; very active in the work of suppressing monasteries; &#x2026; and indeed it was on Monastic Property &#x2026; that he had made for himself a sumptuous estate in those Fen regions. Now, of this Richard Cromwell there are two Letters to Thomas Cromwell, &#x2018;Vicar-General,&#x2019; Earl of Essex, which remain yet visible among the Manuscripts of the British Museum; in both of which he signs himself with his own hand, &#x2018;your most bounden Nephew&#x2019; &#x2026; One of them &#x2026; is dated &#x2018;Stamford,&#x2019; without day or year; but the context farther dates it as contemporary with the Lincolnshire Rebellion, or Anti-Reformation riot, which was directly followed by the more formidable &#x2018;Pilgrimage of Grace&#x2019; in Yorkshire to the like effect, in the autumn of <date when="1536-00-00">1536</date>. Richard, in company with other higher official persons, represents himself as straining every nerve to beat down and extinguish this traitorous fanatic flame, kindled against the King&#x2019;s Majesty and his Reform of the Church; has an eye in particular to a certain Sir John Thymbleby in Lincolnshire, whom he would fain capture as a ringleader &#x2026;&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Cromwell, Works</hi> 6:28&#x2013;29).</note></p>
<p>On the other hand, Fuller &#x201C;knowingly affirms&#x201D; that on a certain <pb id="pg-17-208" n="17:208"/>occasion Oliver said audibly &#x201C;with some passion&#x201D; that he was not in the least related to the Putney concern: There is another fact!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;There is no doubt at all but Oliver the Protector&#x2019;s family <hi rend="italic">was</hi> related to that of Thomas Cromwell, Earl of Essex, the Putney &#x2018;Blacksmith&#x2019;s or Iron-master&#x2019;s son, &#x2026; the <hi rend="italic">Malleus Monarchorum,</hi> or, as old Fuller renders it, &#x2018;Mauler of Monasteries,&#x2019; in Henry Eighth&#x2019;s time. The same old Fuller, a perfectly veracious and most intelligent person, does indeed report as of &#x2018;his own knowledge,&#x2019; that Oliver Protector, once upon a time when Bishop Goodman came dedicating to him some unreadable semi-popish jargon about the &#x2018;mystery of the Holy Trinity,&#x2019; and some adulation about &#x2018;his Lordship&#x2019;s relationship to the former great Purifier of the Church,&#x2019; and Mauler of Monasteries,&#x2014;answered impatiently, &#x2018;My family has no relationship to his!&#x2019; &#x2026; I have consulted the unreadable semi-popish jargon, for the sake of that Dedication; I find that Oliver&#x2019;s relationship to Thomas Cromwell is in any case stated <hi rend="italic">wrong</hi> there, not right &#x2026; I infer therefore that Oliver said to him impatiently, without untruth, &#x2018;You are quite wrong as to all that: good morning!&#x2019;&#x2014;and that old Fuller, likewise without untruth, reports it as above&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Cromwell, Works</hi> 6:27&#x2013;28). Thomas Fuller (<date when="1608-00-00">1608</date>&#x2013;<date when="1661-00-00">61</date>), divine and author of <hi rend="italic">The History of the Worthies of England</hi> (<date when="1662-00-00">1662</date>). Godfrey Goodman (<date when="1583-00-00">1583</date>&#x2013;<date when="1656-00-00">1656</date>), bishop of Gloucester, author of <hi rend="italic">The Two Great Mysteries of Christian Religion, The Ineffable Trinity, The Wonderful Incarnation</hi> (<date when="1653-00-00">1653</date>), dedicated to Cromwell,</note>&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>
<p>Chaos umpire sits,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi> 2:907.</note> in that frightful province of things,&#x2014;which I often have thoughts to quit forever, flying for my life.</p>

He came into this room the other morning when I was sitting peaceably darning his stockings, and laid a great bundle of papers on my fire, enough to have kindled the chimney if it had not been, providentially, swept quite lately&#x2014;the kindling of a chimney (as you in your German ignorance may perhaps not be aware) subjecting one here in London to the awful visitation of <hi rend="italic">three</hi> fire engines! besides a fine of <hi rend="italic">five pounds!</hi> I fancied it the contents of his waste-paper-basket that he was ridding himself of by this summary process&#x2014;but happening to look up at his face, I saw in its grim concentrated self-complacency the astounding truth, that it was all his labour since he returned from Scotland that had been there sent up the vent, in smoke!&#x2014; &#x201C;He had discovered over night&#x201D; he said &#x201C;that he must take up <hi rend="italic">the damnable thing</hi> on quite a new tact&#x201D;!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >This is a turning point in TC&#x2019;s writing about Cromwell when we see him able to tell JWC that he is on &#x201C;a new tack,&#x201D; i.e., not writing a biography (as she supposed) or a history, but first collecting Cromwell&#x2019;s letters and speeches; see also <ref target="volume-17/lt-18431227-TC-CR-01">TC to CR, <date when="1843-12-27">27 Dec.</date></ref>, where &#x201C;ten days ago,&#x201D; <date when="1843-12-18">18 Dec.</date>, he had made &#x201C;a fresh burnt offering&#x201D; and was &#x201C;again at the thing on another side,&#x201D; and <ref target="volume-17/lt-18440109-TC-EF-01">TC to EF, <date when="1844-01-09">9 Jan. 1844</date></ref>. Earlier in <date when="1843-00-00">1843</date> he had been writing, rewriting, and fair copying a series of sketches, either for the biography or history, which was preserved. But it was presumably his latest attempts, made since his summer holiday, to turn them into a continuous work that were burnt. This can be seen from the MS (Strouse), ed. by A. Carlyle as <hi rend="italic">Historical Sketches</hi> (<date when="1898-00-00">1898</date>), and earlier drafts (FC 48.E.36). Alexander Carlyle&#x2019;s explanations are misleading, and he supports them by changing the date of one of TC&#x2019;s notes that clearly says that a certain sketch was written in &#x201C;<date when="1842-00-00">1842</date>&#x201D; to &#x201C;<date when="1843-00-00">1843</date>&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Hist.

Though the burning of the MS marks the breakthrough to the birth of <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi>, throughout <date when="1844-00-00">1844</date> TC evidently thought of the collected letters and speeches as supplementary to another work&#x2014;either a history or biography, &#x201C;whatever the name of it prove to be&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-17/lt-18440131-TC-RWE-01">TC to RWE, <sic><date when="1844-02-02">2 Feb. 1844</date></sic><corr><date when="1844-01-31">31 Jan. 1844</date></corr></ref>), &#x201C;a Book, let what <hi rend="italic">will</hi> follow&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-18/lt-18441012-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1844-10-12">12 Oct. 1844</date></ref>), or &#x201C;whatever other Book I find myself equal to about the man&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-18/lt-18441122-TC-JCA-01">TC to JCA, <date when="1844-11-22">22 Nov. 1844</date></ref>).</note> Oh a very <hi rend="italic">damnable <pb id="pg-17-210" n="17:210"/>thing</hi> indeed!

<p>My German friend has returned from Germany safe and sound, and brought me thence a highly curious <foreign><hi rend="italic">gage d&#x2019;amour</hi></foreign> [pledge of love]&#x2014;which is causing a sort of general panic among my admirers&#x2014; Old Sterling in particular is furious at it and likens it to the Devil&#x2019;s tail (where he <hi rend="italic">saw</hi> the Devils tail whether at the Times newspaper-office or in what other unholy place I did not like to ask) The thing is the most splendid, most fantastical altogether inconceivable&#x2014;bell-rope! made for me by the hands of Plattnauers Countess-Sister.<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hedwig von Reichenbach.</note> A countless number of little <hi rend="italic">chinese pagodas</hi>, of scarlet net-work festooned with white bugles, are threaded on a scarlet rope, ending in a &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">voluptuous</hi>&#x201D; scarlet tassel, which again splits itself away into <hi rend="italic">six</hi> little bugle-tassels!

<salute>My dearest Uncle</salute>
<p>It is not every one that can <hi rend="italic">keep the Christmas</hi> after the most approved fashion;&#x2014;in gormandizing over roast-beef and plum pudding, and defying Father Mathew in bumpers. For some of us the D<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> prescribe to &#x201C;eat <hi rend="italic">abstemiously</hi>&#x201D; and to &#x201C;drink <hi rend="italic">not at all</hi>&#x201D; while for others, &#x201C;poverty penury, needcessity and want&#x201D; (as the Scotch preacher had it) enforce the same or a still severer discipline. I fancy you and little <hi rend="italic">me</hi> will dine on Christmas-day with the usual simplicity; at least I am sure we ought <hi rend="italic">to!</hi> And should Mirth even dance on the crown of its head round about us, I do not see that <hi rend="italic">we</hi> need be unusually <hi rend="italic">merry</hi>, nor indeed how we could manage to be so if there <hi rend="italic">were</hi> need&#x2014;either you or I, dear Uncle! It is all very well for those who are still young and hopeful to &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">put up</hi> the Christmas,&#x201D; and keep it <hi rend="italic">merry</hi>, and go jigging out of the old year into the new one, as if they they<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> were playing at blind-man-buff! But when one is arrived at <hi rend="italic">this</hi> with one&#x2019;s life; to be pretty certain before hand that newyears will &#x201C;come with the rake and <pb id="pg-17-213" n="17:213"/>not with <hi rend="italic">the <foreign>shule</foreign></hi> [shovel],&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Scottish proverb about someone who comes to get rather than give.</note> and to be morally certain that whatever they come with, not all their best possible bringings can compensate for what the old years have taken away from one&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">then;</hi> it is not with <hi rend="italic">mirth</hi> that one can welcome the newyear any more! One may still <hi rend="italic">welcome</hi> it as of God&#x2019;s sending,&#x2014;as another year of <hi rend="italic">life</hi> at all events, and &#x201C;while there is life there is hope&#x201D;&#x2014;of one sort or other&#x2014; But there is no use in pretending to be <hi rend="italic">merry</hi> over it or indeed other than very sad! Is it not so dear Uncle?</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">You</hi> will not call me &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">unsocial,&#x201D; &#x201C;misanthropic,&#x201D;</hi> and the like, because <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;I</hi>, as <hi rend="italic">one</hi> solitary individual&#x201D; (my husbands favourite expression) prefer to remain quietly by my own fireside on the Christmas-day, and all such days; keeping them, not <hi rend="italic">merry</hi>, but <hi rend="italic">holy</hi>&#x2014;in the silence of my own thoughts&#x2014;with <hi rend="italic">all</hi> whom I have loved on this earth for company, instead of <hi rend="italic">one</hi> little noisy party! Whether far or near, living or dead infinite Thought can bring them all round me to give my newyear their blessing!: but for this I should break my heart in looking round me on the actual, and missing so much that has been!&#x2014;</p>
<p>My husband sends you the last literary novelty&#x2014;A Christmas <hi rend="italic">Carol</hi> no less!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dickens, <hi rend="italic">A Christmas Carol, in prose: being a Ghost Story of Christmas</hi> (<date when="1843-00-00">1843</date>).

The force of improvement one would say could no further go! but we shall see!

<p>But oh my dear Uncle I am hard up for time, and I want to write to you a great deal longer!&#x2014; Take twenty or even a hundred kisses to make up the difference between my wishes and my inability&#x2014; And God send you a <hi rend="italic">good</hi> new year&#x2014;</p>

<salute>Dear Jean,</salute>
<p>Your Letter has just come to hand: you do well to let me know exactly how it stands with poor Jenny in regard to her Economics. I left &#xa3;5 with her when I quitted Annandale; but Jack probably is behind-hand with his payment. I have written to him that we ought to introduce a fixed <hi rend="italic">regularity</hi> into the business, as a mighty improvement which will cost <hi rend="italic">nothing more at all;</hi>&#x2014;that whichever of us is the one in arrear (for I know not who it is) at present should straightway send off&#xa3;5 as due at midwinter (<date when="1843-12-22">22 dec<hi rend="italic">r</hi></date>), and then the other to be ready with his &#xa3;5 at midsummer (<date when="1843-06-22">22 june</date>). I am to see Jack tomorrow night probably; but in the mean time I bethink me that it will be as well to pay the money thro&#x2019; the Bank, and settle with him about it at leisure. I will take what order is possible that regularity be observed in future: Jenny will know better what she is about in that case. You can send her this money as soon as there is opportunity. Her work, if she make shirts &#x26;c, she may give in the case of Jack and me by way of payment; but the stuff she buys out of shops and pays money for is to be repaid her; five pounds meanwhile come at the two extremities of the year; and so with her other industry she may be able to make a <foreign><hi rend="italic">fend</hi></foreign> [living]. She is a thrifty orderly little body; and will make the best use of whatever is given her;&#x2014;and shall not be left destitute while she behaves herself and I have any means to stand by her.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-17-216" n="17:216"/>This present Bank-draft here inclosed, James will observe, is for Seven Pounds. The two supernumerary sovereigns you are to take directly to the poor Griers, the sick ones, John and the other,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jean replied, <date when="1844-01-14">14 Jan.</date>, that her husband, James, had taken out &#x201C;Johnies&#x201D; money &#x201C;the night your first letter came &#x26; found the poor creature very ill.&#x201D; He and his wife were &#x201C;thunderstruck&#x201D; when he gave them the sovereign. Robert, probably their son, was less reliable, his child was &#x201C;dead and buried,&#x201D; and so Jean had bought clothing for his wife, Mary, and the family. An Aitken family tree records that James&#x2019;s aunt Jean m. John Grierson of Tinwald Downs, and that their son Robert m. James&#x2019;s sister Mary (MS: NLS Acc. 8022). James also had a brother Samuel (not on the family tree) who m. Jean Grier (see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18330316-TC-MAC-01"><sic>6:343</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1833-03-16">16 March 1833</date></corr></ref>). Whether TC&#x2019;s &#x201C;poor Griers&#x201D; was a mistake for &#x201C;Griersons,&#x201D; or he meant another family, is not clear.</note> and smuggle them into their hands with the smallest possible quantity of noise, and leave them there. The poor creatures! One&#x2019;s heart is sore for them; but what help can be given? The mite shews a willing mind, and that is nearly all.

Maurice (see <ref target="volume-17/lt-18431130-TC-JCA-01">TC to JCA, <date when="1843-11-30">30 Nov.</date></ref>), although he no longer had Puseyite sympathies.</note> it may perhaps be worth twopence to you and our Mother. I meant to send it on to my Mother at Gill; but now I think it may be as well to let you have a sight of it first. Will you send it down to my Mother by the Cummertrees Post on friday.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Gill was located in Cummertrees parish.</note>&#x2014; Jamie sent me a Letter from Scotsbrig yesterday; our Mother is gone to the Gill, with intent to &#x201C;stay there till the days grow a little longer.&#x201D; I design to write to her one of these days, and will say that the review is come or coming. Jamie complains of cheap prices; mentions the great dropping of certain farm-rents, and how impossible it is to go on at present prices.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Prices were low because of two good seasons.</note> He keeps a good heart, poor Jamie, in spite of Isabella&#x2019;s illness and all the rest of it; and is a brave little fellow, as I have always found him.</p>
<p>My unfortunate Book prospers as ill as ever Book did; in fact, the Book I have on view, on that subject, is beyond all others that ever were attempted by me, difficult to do;&#x2014;perhaps impossible? No; I will not allow myself to say that; that shall not be said! However, about ten days ago, I gathered accurately together the fruit of six weeks&#x2019; hard writing; and fairly burnt it all in the fire: there is an end of <hi rend="italic">it</hi>. I am now trying the thing on another tack. If one had not the obstinacy of a mule (among other gifts), there would be no getting on in Literature,&#x2014;or elsewhere. I will do this thing yet, either well or ill; or get a terrible <pb id="pg-17-217" n="17:217"/>fall with it, if I live.&#x2014; For a week or two I rather fell off my sleep; but have taken that in flank also, and nearly got the better of it. &#x201C;Steady! Steady!&#x201D; as the drill-serjeants say. Jane is pretty well,&#x2014;and will write, I suppose, before long. She is gone out at present; and cannot in words send her love. All the world here is devouring geese turkies and other Christmas provender. It is really striking to see with what <hi rend="italic">admiration</hi> the common people stand before the huge stacks of beef and mutton at Butchers&#x2019; shops, and seem properly not to <hi rend="italic">admire</hi> or ever have admired anything else!

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Your Welsh good things, which arrived safe on Saturday last, remind us very pleasantly of the kind friend that thinks of us over in those Silurian regions.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >S Wales.</note> Many thanks for your unwearied ever-watchful goodwill.</p>
<p>The little quiet hollow among the Hills, with the trim house and kind good people there; the <hi rend="italic">Llans</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Egglises,</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Villages and churches, from Welsh &#x201C;<foreign>Ilan</foreign>&#x201D; and &#x201C;<foreign>eglwys</foreign>.&#x201D;</note> the old ivy castles and innocent grey straggling hamlets, the narrow &#x201C;perilous&#x201D; Lanes, the roaring seabeaches, high light-towers, and other strange Welsh scenes where I wandered, like a homeless inconsoleable Ghost on its travels, in the bright autumn weather: all this rises now upon my memory as one of the kindliest pictures,&#x2014;a section of some extramundane Country situated in the Land of Dreams. Blessings on it, and on those that dwell there! If there were any rest for the wicked, I might rest in some such place:&#x2014;but there is no rest; there is no place or possibility of such: &#x201C;the wicked (and indeed also the righteous many times) are tossed to and fro.&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Prov. 21:6&#x2013;7.</note>&#x2014; I will send my compliments to Madge Wildfire at any rate; and wish I had her here, lodged in a bandbox, to take out when I pleased and gallop upon.</p>
<p>My adventures since you heard last of me have not been very illustrious; have been far enough from prosperous, or unduly victorious. My health is changed from what it used to be,&#x2014;I sometimes think, for the better, sometimes for the worse. An addition of inaptitude to sleep is <pb id="pg-17-218" n="17:218"/>very clearly of the latter character; but all the symptoms do not point to that bad side of the account. An increased tendency to laziness is perhaps not altogether the effect of health,&#x2014;nor, alas, perhaps of vice in any kind, but of misfortune! No work I ever undertook prospers so ill with me as this of the Puritans History For indeed none other was ever so difficult. It lies buried under two hundred years of stupidity and atheistic brutality, this noble object that I wish to raise up into life again, such life as still does belong to it; and my endeavours therefore are very slow to tell. Ten days ago I made a fresh burnt-offering; cast, namely, into the fire, once for all, the fruit of many a long week of diligent writing: and again I am at the thing on another side. There is no use in heaping <hi rend="italic">new</hi> torpedo<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Benumbing.&#x201D; TC uses it of Dryasdust&#x2019;s writings in <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi>, e.g., <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 6:3.</note> stuff on the back of those poor Heroes and their memory: if one cannot write something that is <hi rend="italic">alive</hi> about them, one can at least and lowest hold his tongue. It will be a long dreary enterprise; like to be rewarded as Puritanism itself was: nevertheless I do not abandon it; I repeat often to myself: &#x201C;Peter of Russia built Petersburg, the imperial hightowered City, on a bottomless Bog of the Neva; 170,000 men had to die first in draining the Neva Bog, before the first stone of Petersburg could be laid. Courage!&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>
<p>When you come to London, do not neglect to apprise us; to come and apprise us in person.</p>
<p>I live in the utmost attainable solitude here at present; the babble of this thoughtless population does but distract me in what I am after;&#x2014;the babble of men generally is but a filling of the one man with sound and hearsay, to the exclusion of sincerity, fact and substance.</p>
<p>Good be with you, a faithful spirit and a healthy body, in the work you yonder have got to do. My kindest remembrances to your good Mother.</p>
<p>Once more, with thanks and friendly regards,</p>
<closer><salute>Yours ever truly,</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name>

<salute>Dear Madam</salute>
<p>My husband&#x2019;s excessive occupation at present affords a pretext which I gladly avail myself of to write my own thanks for your book sent me thro him. Remembering the <hi rend="italic">real</hi> interest with which I read your <hi rend="italic">Gladiator</hi> I shall fall to this new book with good hope; so soon as I have finished Harriet Martineau&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Life in the sick Room</hi> which came to me exactly in the same moment and which, for old friendship&#x2019;s sake, I could not but read first.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-17-223" n="17:223"/>Thanks also for having said a word in season to my husband on the heterodox state of his opinions respecting us women. That he thinks us an inferior order of beings&#x2014;that is, an order of beings born <hi rend="italic">to obey;</hi> I am afraid there is not the shadow of a doubt!&#x2014;not that he is in the habit of promulgating such opinion with any offensive clearness. He never almost speaks about <hi rend="italic">women in the abstract</hi>, and for this and the other <hi rend="italic">concrete woman</hi> I have heard him express a very passable admiration: but this reticence&#x2014;I should say from his practice&#x2014;proceeds not from any misgivings on the question of our inferiority, nor yet from any delicacy towards <hi rend="italic">our</hi> feelings; but simply and solely from that self-complacency of full conviction which finds its natural expression <hi rend="italic">in silence</hi>. Just as nobody thinks it worth while to call peoples attention at midday to the fact of its being daylight!&#x2014; Never mind!&#x2014; As Napoleon said at St Helena when they <hi rend="italic">would</hi> make him into <hi rend="italic">General Buonapart</hi> &#x201C;They may <hi rend="italic">call</hi> me what they like they cannot hinder me <hi rend="italic">being</hi> what I <hi rend="italic">am!</hi>&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Napoleon told his surgeon: &#x201C;I abdicated the throne of France, but not the title of emperor. I do not call myself Napoleon, emperor of France, but the emperor Napoleon. &#x2026; If I were in England, I would not call myself emperor. But they want to make it appear that the French nation had not a right to make me its sovereign.
If they had not a right to make me emperor, they were equally incapable of making me general&#x201D; (Barry O&#x2019;Meara, <hi rend="italic">Napoleon in Exile</hi> [<date when="1827-00-00">1827</date>] 1:161).</note>&#x2014; So these arrogant <hi rend="italic">men</hi> may please themselves in their ideas of our <hi rend="italic">inferiority</hi> to their hearts content; they cannot hinder us in <hi rend="italic">being</hi> what we <hi rend="italic">will</hi> and <hi rend="italic">can</hi> be. Oh we can afford very well to laugh at their <hi rend="italic">ideas</hi>, so long as we feel in ourselves the power to make slaves, and even fools of the wisest of them!&#x2014;</p>
<p>If you are ever in London be sure to come and see us; for I have a presentiment that I should like you considerably. in which case tho &#x201C;I am not the rose&#x2014;have only lived beside the rose&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Attrib. to Benjamin Constant; see <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410724-JWC-JF-01"><sic>13:196</sic><corr>JWC to JF, <date when="1841-07-24">24 July 1841</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014;you will certainly like <hi rend="italic">me</hi>&#x2014;for all my experience has gone to prove that human sympathy is invariably two-sided.</p>
<p>I have relations in Liverpool and go there at rare intervals; should you be still in Liverpool at my next visit I shall make a point of finding you&#x2014;</p>
<p>Meanwhile till further acquaintance believe me yours</p>
<closer><salute>with sincere esteem /</salute></closer> <name>Jane Carlyle</name>

<salute>Dearest M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Russel</salute>
<p>Here comes another new-year&#x2014; &#x2014;already! How one&#x2019;s years <hi rend="italic">do</hi> gallop when one is no longer young! The <hi rend="italic">first</hi> message I charge it with is one of kind remembrance and cordial good wishes to you&#x2014;and if I add a little trouble to be taken for my sake; I know your good heart well enough by this time, to feel quite sure that you will receive the one as gladly as the other&#x2014;</p>
<p>By the same post which takes you this letter I send a <hi rend="italic">hood</hi> which you will see at the first glance can be intended for no other head than old Mary&#x2019;s!&#x2014;and also a cap for Margaret,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mills and Hiddlestone.</note> which I hope will fit her&#x2014;if it do not; you must help her to make it fit&#x2014; And I enclose a money order for a sovereign to be distributed as last Year&#x2014;for Margaret and Mary their pounds of tea and the remainder to be given to the two old people you told me of&#x2014; There is also a waist-buckle which I hope you will like and wear for my sake. And tho last not least I send a couple of&#x2014;extinguishers (!) <hi rend="italic">a nun</hi> and <hi rend="italic">a Jesuit</hi> hollowed out into extinguishers; which you are to present to your Father with my affectionate regards as a <hi rend="italic">supplement to the Tablet!</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">The Tablet</hi>, Roman Catholic weekly, ed. Frederick Lucas, who sent it free to TC, who then forwarded it to Mr. Dobbie, Mary Russell&#x2019;s father.</note> (which I hope by the way he continues to get regularly&#x2014;my brother-in-law has taken it into his head to carry it home with him on the Sunday nights, undertaking to forward it punctually: but I liked better when it went direct from here with my husband&#x2019;s handwriting on it) Whether these extinguishers, which have had <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;an immense success&#x201D;</hi> (as I was told at the shop where I bought them) indicate a growing tendency towards catholicism, or are meant as a <hi rend="italic">satire</hi> against it I cannot pretend to decide! Who shall read in the deep brain of a Cockney-Inventor When he gets into the sphere of the <hi rend="italic">symbolical?</hi> He wanders thro the universe of things &#x201C;at his own sweet will,&#x201D; collecting here a little and there a little, combining and confounding, with such a glorious superiority to all laws of affinity and right reason, and such an absolute <hi rend="italic">disregard of consequences;</hi> that one stands amazed before him &#x201C;as in presence of the Infinite&#x201D;!&#x2014;the Infinite&#x2014;absurd!&#x2014; I saw the other day the &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">realized <pb id="pg-17-225" n="17:225"/>Ideal</hi>&#x201D; of <hi rend="italic">a butcher</hi>, which I shall not soon forget. A number of persons were standing before his shop contemplating the little <hi rend="italic">work of Art</hi> with a grave admiration beyond anything I ever saw testified towards any picture in the National Gallery! The butcher himself was standing beside it, receiving their silent enthusiasm with a look of Artist-pride struggling to keep within the bounds of Christian humility&#x2014; A look which seemed to say; &#x201C;yes! you may well admire&#x2014; but remember good people that I am but <hi rend="italic">a man!</hi>&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370718-TC-JSM-01"><sic>9:256</sic><corr>TC to JSM, <date when="1837-07-18">18 July 1837</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014;and his <hi rend="italic">work of art</hi>; what was it?&#x2014; <hi rend="italic">A hare</hi>, to begin with&#x2014;hanging in a long row of dead sheep and quarters of beef&#x2014;of course a <hi rend="italic">dead</hi> hare&#x2014;it had still its fur on, and was fixed up by the hind legs,&#x2014;pretty wide apart,&#x2014;its belly towards the public,&#x2014;about its neck and about every one of its four legs was tied a <hi rend="italic">blue</hi> satin, ribband, and one of <hi rend="italic">scarlet</hi> satin, in very coquettish bows! between the hind legs was placed a large and particularly smart&#x2014;blue and scarlet cockade!! and into a large gash made in the belly was stuck a sprig of holly laden with red berries!!! Just fancy the butcher lying awake in his bed meditating how his <hi rend="small-caps">hare</hi> should be&#x2014;and deciding that it should be <hi rend="italic">thus</hi> and no otherwise&#x2014;and then sending out his wife or daughter, the first thing in the morning, to buy ribbands of the requisite colours&#x2014;and then anxiously superintending the sewing of the Cockade&#x2014;and then and then&#x2014;till finally his <hi rend="italic">Ideal</hi> hung there, by the hind legs, a world&#x2019;s wonder! it would be so at least anywhere else but in London&#x2014;where <hi rend="italic">such</hi> wonders are no novelty&#x2014; Last Christmas another of our Chelsea butchers (the people who have to do with <hi rend="italic">the eatable</hi> here are always the greatest geniuses) regaled the public with the spectacle of a <hi rend="italic">living</hi> prize-calf, on the breast of which (poor wretch) was branded&#x2014; &#x2014;like writing on turf&#x2014; <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;6</hi>d <hi rend="italic">a pound&#x201D;!</hi>&#x2014;and the public gathered about this Unfortunate with the greedy looks of a parcel of Cannibals!</p>
<p>It was a great pleasure to me to hear such particular accounts of you all from my husband&#x2014; He was so minute in his details that it was almost as if I had been at Thornhill myself without the painfulness of going&#x2014; But he says &#x201C;I must never ask him to do that again; it was too sad&#x201D;&#x2014;If it was too sad for <hi rend="italic">him</hi>, what would it not be for <hi rend="italic">me?</hi>&#x2014; But often, often I dream of being at Thornhill in my sleep&#x2014;and who knows how much or how little of reality there may be in what happens to one in sleep?</p>
<p>My husband has been very busy since his return from Scotland but with no result as yet. he brought all that he had written into the room where I was peaceably darning his stockings the other day and laid it on the fire&#x2014;and it was up the chimney in a fine blaze before I knew <pb id="pg-17-226" n="17:226"/>what it was that he was burning! This <hi rend="italic">life of Oliver Cromwell</hi> looks to me sometimes as if it were <hi rend="italic">never</hi> going to get itself written, work at it as he may. It reminds me of the child of a french marchioness I once read of that could never <hi rend="italic">get itself born,</hi> but was carried about in her <hi rend="italic">twenty years</hi> till she died. A wit was said to have asked her in course of time if &#x201C;Madame was not thinking of <hi rend="italic">swallowing a tutor for her son&#x201D;!</hi> It is about time now to ask Carlyle if he be not thinking of <hi rend="italic">swallowing a publisher for his book!</hi> But tho&#x2019; I can joke on the subject in writing it is no joking matter to be practically concerned with I can assure you!&#x2014; He gets so utterly wretched and so out of health when he is not getting on with his work; that one does not know what to do with him or with oneself.</p>
<p>My kindest regards to D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Russel and your Father.&#x2014; a kiss to yourself which I wish I could give you without &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">blowing</hi>&#x2019; it as the children say&#x2014; <closer><salute>Do not forget me as I certainly shall never forget you, but shall love you and be deeply deeply grateful to you as long as I live</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I know not how often of late days I have been disappointed in the good purpose of writing a little word to you; but today I am determined it shall not be so; accordingly I begin with this the first thing I do. It is a poor service that of writing you a bit &#x201C;scrape of a pen,&#x201D; and all that we can do for you here: a great shame to us if that be not regularly done!</p>
<p>Jack has sent off a cargo of Books for you, which will probably be at Dumfries in the first week of the year: there are some things you will like to read,&#x2014;for indeed I have observed, dear Mother, that you are very catholic in your literary tastes, and can read almost any Book that has any good meaning <supplied>[in]</supplied><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> it. That is one of the many things I like you for!&#x2014; Jack said also he was going to write; which I daresay he will do, or has done.</p>
<p>Jamie, just about the time of your leaving Scotsbrig told me you were off to Gill; we have also, since that heard from Dumfries, and from Jenny. Jenny&#x2019;s Letter brought a pair of Jack&#x2019;s night-shirts to light; they were lying quite safe in my drawer, never yet opened out: Jane <pb id="pg-17-227" n="17:227"/>had accepted them as <hi rend="italic">mine</hi>, tho&#x2019; I had no need of them; and there they were when Jack claimed them. I have sent &#xa3;5 to Jenny to Dumfries thro&#x2019; James Aitken, who, I suppose, will put <supplied>[it]</supplied><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> into the Savings Bank for her, or give it into her own hand as she may like best: Jack will send another &#xa3;5 at midsummer; and so at the two ends of the year, regularly henceforth, she will know what to count upon. Regularity is best, and costs nothing whatever more than irregularity. Jack and I settled about that last week; and it was also agreed upon that whatever work she did for us two in time coming, she was to charge at least all the <hi rend="italic">shop</hi> part of it against us, namely not to lay out any <hi rend="italic">money</hi> upon it (as buying muslin, flannell or the like); her own labour we would either take gratis, or settle for otherwise if found necessary. Let her go upon this, therefore, as a certainty; it may be the beginning of farther certainties and advantages for her, poor little Jenny, if she stand up faithfully against her difficulties, and be true to <hi rend="italic">herself</hi>, as she has hitherto striven to be. One cannot command <hi rend="italic">others</hi> to be true to one; but if <hi rend="italic">true to oneself</hi>, which is always in everybody&#x2019;s power, that is the less matter.</p>
<p>The worst part of Jenny&#x2019;s news was that you seemed to feel yourself really weakly, and out of order, at the time she wrote. James Austin had taken you out in the Gig and done some good that day; for which I pray you thank him in my name. I can only recommend that you keep yourself warm, with clothing and with good fires; that you get out in the Gig or otherwise whenever there is a blink of opportunity; that you, and that all the rest of them as I am sure they will, take every care and use every diligence! You might make great improvements in your diet, I am certain, for one thing Jenny and the good kind Mary, now while you are near them, will be better to you than you are yourself. If the Pills answer, just send a word of notice, and more of them will arrive by return of Post. Our apothecary here is an industrious honest Quaker, a very faithful <foreign><hi rend="italic">gleg</hi></foreign> [clever] little body, and keeps no drugs that are not of right quality.</p>
<p>As for us, we are struggling along much in the old way. Our winter hitherto has been very mild; almost warmer than the Summer was: this agrees with Jane; neither do I object to it, tho&#x2019; sharp brisk weather is better for my walking. Neither of us have had any colds yet, or the like, worth speaking of.&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; The saddest story is that of my Book; which occasions great difficulty. I not long ago fairly cast a great mass of it into the fire; not in any sudden rage at it, but after quiet deliberation, and deciding on this as the best I could do! I am now trying the business on another side; with hopes of better prosperity there. Prosper or <pb id="pg-17-228" n="17:228"/>not, I must hold on at it; one one<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> side or on the other I <hi rend="italic">must</hi> get in upon it; and drive it before me. But the truth is, it will be a long heavy piece of labour; and I must not grumble that my progress seems so small. I do make progress; as much progress <hi rend="italic">as I can;</hi>&#x2014;and, on the whole, why should I plague myself or others about the <hi rend="italic">quantity</hi> of my progress? I am a poor discontented creature, and ought at least to <hi rend="italic">hold my peace,</hi> and &#x201C;be thankful I am not in Purgatory!&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-04/lt-18270203-TC-AC-01"><sic>4:185</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1827-02-03">3 Feb. 1827</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014;</p>
<p>We have not seen many people here of late; I keep as much out of the way of seeing as I can. Old Mr Sterling has given up his house, and now lives in lodgings, almost right opposite Jack in the same street;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Brompton Grove.</note>&#x2014;one is sorry for him poor old fellow, left solitary now as if he were but beginning the world. His good old Wife, dropping suddenly from his side, has been a great loss to him.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >She had d. <date when="1843-04-16">16 April</date>.</note> He drives about in a little close carriage, sometimes very low, at other times keeping up a good heart; he seems to come oftener here than to any other place; indeed I fancy he has but few <hi rend="italic">friends</hi> anywhere in this big London, long as he has lived and much as he has struggled in it.</p>
<p>Charles Buller has been travelling about in Italy and Switzerland, and is now come home again. He is a man much in vogue among the grand people here; and might have a great influence for doing good, in many ways, if he stood diligently forward in any good cause: but this I hardly think he will now ever do; he is a most <hi rend="italic">amusing</hi> man, and will probably take into that line, and never excel in any other. Mrs Buller and the rest of them live far away down to the Southwest in Devonshire,&#x2014;almost as far as you are to the Northwest: she is always very weakly and unwell, she talks of shifting to Italy for health next summer.&#x2014; &#x2014; I have Yankees coming, plenty of them and to spare! We had Allan Cunningham&#x2019;s Widow and Daughter here with us to dinner last week; they have now got a house and settlement not far from us, and seem to be adjusted pretty well. A Son of Poet Burns&#x2019;s &#x201C;Major Burns,&#x201D; from India lately, was also of the party; a pleasant little man.</p>
<p><title>&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;</title></p>
<p>Dear Mother, just at the time when I was writing that &#x201C;I should do this Note the first thing,&#x201D; there came a rap to the door; and foolish Helen, knowing it to be a man we rather liked, let him in, and set me altogether to the right about! The consequence is, I have had to do it after dinner; in a very stupid mood;&#x2014;and there is Jack&#x2019;s rap, I hear, down stairs; so now I must finish.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-17-229" n="17:229"/>When you go to Dumfries there is a kind of New years gift waiting you, dear Mother. How do I wish you at New years day and all days and nights of the year all manner of good! You deserve from us all what <hi rend="italic">we</hi> never can pay. But I think you are sure of payment nevertheless!</p>
<p>Remember us with all affection, to Jenny to James &#x26; Mary and all the household. Good be ever with you all. And so <foreign>adieu</foreign>, <closer><salute>dear Mother. Ever yours /</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name></p>

<p><salute><hi rend="small-caps">My dear Mrs</hi>. <hi rend="small-caps">Welsh</hi>,&#x2014;</salute>When my husband on returning from Scotland told me the new misfortune which had befallen you,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-17/lt-18430912-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1843-09-12">12 Sept. 1843</date></ref>.</note> my first movement was to write to you immediately; but when I considered what it was that I had to write&#x2014;merely regrets and condolences&#x2014;affording no sort of comfort beyond that which I trusted you had already, the assurance namely of my interest in you; I felt that I could write to you better when besides the expression of my sympathy, I might add some suggestion or hope about your future which had any practical help in it.</p>
<p>Mr. Gordon had mentioned some situation which he thought it likely might be procured for you, and in which you might gain, without too much difficulty, a respectable livelihood, so long as the hard necessity of earning your own livelihood was imposed on you (which we trust will not be for long&#x2014;till John has found his footing in the world).<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Gordon had mentioned to TC the possibility of a position for Margaret Welsh in a school; see <ref target="volume-17/lt-18430912-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1843-09-12">12 Sept. 1843</date></ref>. Though her son John (<date when="1824-00-00">1824</date>&#x2013;<date when="1859-00-00">59</date>; <ref target="volume-17/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/29027"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref> see <ref target="volume-15/lt-18420820-JWC-MW-01"><sic>15:37</sic><corr>JWC to MW, <date when="1842-08-20">20 Aug. 1842</date></corr></ref>) had found employment at Makerstoun observatory, he earned only &#xa3;60 per year.</note> I would wait to see what came of this&#x2014;whether Mr. Gordon <pb id="pg-17-230" n="17:230"/>could make his suggestion into a distinct proposal&#x2014;would meanwhile urge him to all zeal on your behalf&#x2014;and if the result proved favourable there would then be some use in saying: &#x2018;My dear Mrs. Welsh I am horribly grieved for you,&#x2019; when I could follow it up with: &#x2018;but here is at least one resource open to you against the present pressure of difficulty.&#x2019;</p>
<p>Now however comes a letter from Mr. Gordon in which he tells me that he hears from my aunts that &#x2018;in your present state of health you fear to venture on the labours of a school,&#x2019; and I hasten to beg that you will tell me yourself how it is with you&#x2014;whether you be suffering from any positive ailment or only from that general feeling of <hi rend="italic">unwellness</hi> which is with most of us the inevitable consequence of anxiety or distress of mind&#x2014;and whether you have any outlook which you find to be <hi rend="italic">as possible</hi> and <hi rend="italic">more promising</hi> than this which we thought of for you. Alas alas, for a woman unused <hi rend="italic">from the beginning</hi> to <hi rend="italic">work</hi> for her subsistence there is no <hi rend="italic">easy</hi> work to be found: it may not be always <hi rend="italic">physically</hi> hard but physically or morally she is sure to find it hard enough&#x2014;too hard&#x2014;in whatever shape it comes to her&#x2014;look at what <hi rend="italic">seems</hi> to be the <hi rend="italic">easiest</hi> of all employments&#x2014;companion to a rich Lady&#x2014;where all one&#x2019;s material wants are provided for&#x2014;and no actual labour required&#x2014; a little observation may soon convince one that even <hi rend="italic">that</hi> is no <hi rend="italic">easy work</hi>&#x2014;that the <hi rend="italic">soul</hi> is quite sufficiently taxed to overbalance the exemptions of the body&#x2014;
I see women here, who had been born to independence, fulfilling that vocation under one would say the most favourable circumstances, and I declare to heaven that I would rather keep a school&#x2014;follow any sort of laborious employment in honesty&#x2014;and call my soul my own, than live the most do-nothing luxurious existence, but with my soul thus put at the disposition of other people&#x2014; Tell me however what you think&#x2014;what you purpose&#x2014;if indeed the stunned condition in which such an unexpected blow must have left you has yet allowed you to mature any passing idea into a purpose. I have much desire to be of use to you&#x2014;little power&#x2014;but that little will be exerted to the uttermost, if I once knew in what direction to exert it with any possibility of success. God give you comfort&#x2014;for you need it, poor soul&#x2014;your life has been a hard one. You have always however the consolation of knowing that it is not thro&#x2019; fault of <hi rend="italic">yours</hi> that it has been so hard&#x2014;it is a cruel aggravation of suffering to feel that one has brought it on oneself.</p>

<p><salute>I am glad to see dearest Babbie that there is <hi rend="italic">a revival</hi> in your moral <hi rend="italic">department</hi> since you got back into the atmosphere of home&#x2014;</salute>that you write to me oftener and longer&#x2014;and more like a Babbie whose wits had not all gone &#x201C;a-woolgathering&#x201D;&#x2014;in a windy day! But you must continue in this praiseworthy course for a while to come, before I can recover that implicit belief in your virtue (for virtue is writing to <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, is it not?) which made you so long the comfort of my life&#x2014;my <hi rend="italic">Consuelo!</hi> <note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Consolation, like the heroine of George Sand&#x2019;s novel, <hi rend="italic">Consuelo</hi> (Paris, <date when="1842-00-00">1842</date>&#x2013;<date when="1843-00-00">43</date>).</note></p>
<p>This is washing-day: and further, the ground is covered with snow and further I have a headach. Better to have waited till tomorrow so far as you are concerned&#x2014; But Carlyle told me last night &#x201C;to be sure <hi rend="italic">when I wrote to Liverpool tomorrow</hi> (he supposes I write every day it would seem) to send a message for Walter Macgregor&#x2014;it went much against his conscience to plague Walter, <hi rend="italic">in the midst of the complexities which seemed to be thickening and darkening around him, with speech about tobacco</hi>&#x2014;but really it was essential to the comfort of his (Carlyle&#x2019;s) existence that Walter should be made aware that his good tobacco was <hi rend="italic">entirely done</hi> and none to be got here for money which was fit for a human being to smoke&#x2014;ergo, if Walter would send him some of the right sort as soon as convenient (anglice: <hi rend="italic">possible</hi>) it would be esteemed the highest favour&#x2014;he was not to wait for opportunities but send it by railway at once&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;dam the expence&#x201D; of carriage where anything so <hi rend="italic">vital</hi> as tobacco is concerned. Now will you give this message to Walter not in the phraseology in which I have given it but as courteously and modestly as your sweet lips will know how We had a most quiet newyears day&#x2014;I saw nobody but Mazzini who came thro the snow to be my <hi rend="italic">first foot</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;&#x2018;First foot&#x2019; &#x2026; is a Scottish supersitition about good or ill luck for a whole year being omened by your liking or otherwise of the first person that accosts you on New Year&#x2019;s morning&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note in Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi> 3:91). JWC gave him a pen and ink stand as a New Year&#x2019;s gift (<hi rend="italic">Scritti</hi> 26:19).</note>&#x2014;and my first words of thanks were&#x2014;&#x201C;What on earth could tempt you to come out in a day like this.&#x201D;&#x2014; He looked most pitiable with big drops of sleet hanging from the ends of his mustache <hi rend="italic">Helen</hi> went to a party in the evening! At Chalmers&#x2019;s<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC carefully wrote &#x201C;Chalmers&#x2019;s&#x201D; over something else, perhaps &#x201C;Chambers&#x2019;s&#x201D; referring to their present neighbors.

I asked Helen what they did&#x2014;Oh says she &#x201C;it was just a sort of <foreign><hi rend="italic">guddle</hi></foreign> [muddle] of a thing&#x2014;all eating and drinking and no fun at all&#x201D;&#x2014;a pretty good discription of most dinners&#x2014;&#x201C;three of the servants visitors were kept all the time &#x201C;washing and <hi rend="italic">polishing</hi> glasses for upstairs&#x201D;! I ought in gratitude to say however that even I who am superstitious about the beginnings of newyears&#x2014;who watch all their outs and ins as the Roman Augurs did the flight of birds had reason to be satisfied with yesterday&#x2014;it brought me <hi rend="italic">nobody</hi> but Mazzini&#x2014;it brought me a good long letter from my Babbie with another as long from Miss Donaldson bearing a great postmark Haddington&#x2014;so plain and large that one would have said it had been stamped in that particular way for <hi rend="italic">my</hi> express behoof&#x2014;and in the morning when I spring out of bed half asleep&#x2014;the room all dark&#x2014;on hearing Carlyle go down I was received into the arms of&#x2014;Helen!&#x2014;saluted with two hearty smacks on my two cheeks!&#x2014;while an immense gingerbread cake&#x2014;which she had had baked more gingery than usual to suit my taste was thrust into the breast of my night shift&#x2014;and my whole room was filled with a most savoury smell of ginger bread&#x2014;from this <hi rend="italic">delicate attention</hi> you will perceive she is very good just now&#x2014;indeed since the fright she got last spring<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1843-02-00">Feb.</date>&#x2013;<date when="1843-03-00">March 1843</date>, when JWC wanted to dismiss her.</note> she has done her uttermost to keep a guard on her temper&#x2014;and has <hi rend="italic">on the whole</hi> behaved very well&#x2014; Then on my toilet I found a hair-brush and <hi rend="italic">redd</hi> (as they call it in Annandale <foreign><hi rend="italic">anglice</hi></foreign> Comb&#x2014;) placed there the night before by Carlyle&#x2014;but such a brush and comb as never were in my possession before&#x2014;they are best described in Helen&#x2019;s words who declared them to be &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">most noble</hi>&#x201D; the comb is tortoise shell&#x2014;the brush&#x2014;Oh Heavens!&#x2014;it is the size and shape of an ordinary pancake!&#x2014;might have been made on purpose for Goliath of Gath!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >1 Sam. 17:4.</note>&#x2014;the bristles are at least an inch and half deep&#x2014;and you would say at first sight that it was some instrument of torture!

<p>I am glad of the hope you hold out of our seeing Walter&#x2014;tell him to be sure and come straight here&#x2014;and to warn me that I may have his bed well warmed. Love to them all&#x2014;my head is very bad&#x2014;and I <hi rend="italic">must</hi> stop.</p>

<salute>Dear Fitzgerald,</salute>
<p>Your Letter comes to me in a &#x201C;good hour,&#x201D;&#x2014;makes for me what the French call a <foreign><hi rend="italic">bonheur!</hi></foreign><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A pun on the French <foreign><hi rend="italic">bonne heure</hi></foreign> (literally &#x201C;good hour&#x201D;) and <foreign><hi rend="italic">bonheur</hi></foreign> (&#x201C;happiness&#x201D; or &#x201C;good luck&#x201D;). FitzGerald&#x2019;s letter is dated <date when="1844-01-03">3 Jan.</date></note> I am sunk in inexpressible confusions; and any kind voice of encouragement is right welcome. Surely if ever I do get this <hi rend="italic">Book on Cromwell</hi> finished, we will smoke a pipe of triumph over it, and rejoice to remember difficulties undergone! Alas, for the present, I cannot so much as get it begun. In my whole life, I have found myself in no such hideous situation: a ghastly labyrinth, created for me by the stupidities of England accumulating for two two<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in text.</note> hundred years;&#x2014;vacant Dulness glaring on one everywhere, with <foreign>torpedo</foreign> [numbing] look, in this universal &#x201C;dusk of the gods,&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A translation of <hi rend="italic">G&#xF6;tterd&#xE4;mmerung</hi>.</note> saying with a sneer: &#x201C;Thou? Wilt thou save a Hero from the Abysses, where dark Death has quietly hidden him so long?&#x201D;&#x2014; It is frightful. But on the whole we must hold on; we must not spend our strength execrating, in complaining! It is really something like the <hi rend="italic">sixth</hi> time, that I have <hi rend="italic">burnt</hi> considerable masses of written attempts at commencing the unwriteable; and to this hour it remains properly uncommenced. And it must be commenced, and (if God please) finished;&#x2014;I shall have but a poor time of it otherwise! Let me be silent; let my next Note to you say: I <hi rend="italic">am</hi> launched; by the blessing of Heaven, I hope to sail, to arrive! Surely there was no such business as the writing a Life of Oliver Cromwell for the present race of Englishmen, in the present distracted darkness of the whole subject, ever before laid upon a human sinner?&#x2014;</p>
<p>One of the things I have at length got to discern as doable is the gathering of all Oliver&#x2019;s Letters and Speeches, and stringing them together according to the order of time: a series of fixed <hi rend="italic">rock</hi>-summits, in the infinite ocean of froth, confusion, lies and stupidity, which hitherto constitutes the &#x201C;History&#x201D; of Cromwell, as Dryasdust<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A fictitious, prosy antiquarian to whom Sir Walter Scott addressed the prefs. and conclusions of some of his novels. TC used the name in his drafts for <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> (pbd. in <hi rend="italic">Historical Sketches</hi> 13, 23, 304), in <hi rend="italic">Past and Present</hi>, and in his letters to FitzGerald to refer to dull and boring antiquarians and historians.</note> has printed it and read it. This I am at present doing;&#x2014;tho&#x2019; this is not what I have the real difficulty in doing. I have made considerable progess; <pb id="pg-17-234" n="17:234"/>Time has eaten up most of Oliver&#x2019;s utterances; but a fraction still remains: these I can and will see printed, set in some kind of order.</p>
<p>Directly on receiving your Note I shot off a missive to &#x201C;A. Cromwell Russell&#x201D; &#x26;c:<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In his letter, <date when="1844-01-03">3 Jan.</date>, FitzGerald had written: &#x201C;I have been told that a man thus named to me, / <hi rend="italic">Artro Medorus</hi> Cromwell Russell / Cheshunt / Waltham Crop [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>. Cross] / has some valuable autograph letters of the Protector. I think some of the family lived at Cheshunt in their great days. The last of the name (who wrote some memoirs of the family) did live there. You see by one of this man&#x2019;s names that he comes of the blood&#x2014;as to his first Christian name it puzzles me completely&#x201D; (D. Trela, &#x201C;FitzGerald to Carlyle,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Notes and Queries</hi> n.s. 31 [<date when="1984-00-00">1984</date>]: 480). The &#x201C;last of the name&#x201D; was Oliver Cromwell (<date when="1742-00-00">1742</date>?&#x2013;<date when="1821-00-00">1821</date>); FitzGerald&#x2019;s informant had apparently confused this Oliver&#x2019;s grandson Artemidorus Cromwell Russell (<date when="1803-00-00">1803</date>&#x2013;<date when="1830-00-00">30</date>) with his son-in-law Thomas Artemidorus Russell (<date when="1775-00-00">1775</date>&#x2013;<date when="1858-00-00">1858</date>) of Cheshunt Park, Herts.; see <ref target="volume-17/lt-18440210-TC-EF-01">TC to EF, <date when="1844-02-10">10 Feb.</date></ref></note> no answer yet; you shall hear of it, if I ever get an answer: but I hardly expect one, or at any rate one that will be better than none. Various are the applications of a like sort that I have made; always with the one answer, Nothing available here; something once <hi rend="italic">was</hi>, or was said to be, but &#x26;c &#x26;c.&#x2014; In the British Museum I find the <hi rend="italic">original</hi> of the Letter about Naseby; written from Harborough that very night of the battle:<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <hi rend="italic">Cromwell, Works</hi> 6:214&#x2013;15.</note> I tried hard to find some shiver in the hair-strokes, some symptom that the man had been bearding Death all day; but there is nothing of that sort there; a quite composed letter, the handwriting massive, steadfast, you would say almost firmer than usual.</p>
<p>I like that account of Lawrence&#x2019;s about the Portrait,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A miniature, supposedly by Samuel Cooper (<date when="1609-00-00">1609</date>&#x2013;<date when="1672-00-00">72</date>); see <ref target="volume-14/lt-18420103-TC-JOST-01"><sic>14:6</sic><corr>TC to JOST, <date when="1842-01-03">3 Jan. 1842</date></corr></ref>. FitzGerald wrote: &#x201C;Lawrence much admires the portrait the Berners people have&#x2014;he says it is more pensive than the others he has seen&#x2014;an abstracted look, &#x2018;as if there were music playing in the room.&#x2019;&#x201D;</note> and must see farther into it. Do you ever go to Lincolnshire? I wish you had some errand thitherward, to get me a right account of three places, Oliver&#x2019;s first scenes of real fight,&#x2014;of setting life against life in that Cause of his. Grantham, somewhere near that; then Gainsborough, where George Cavendish was killed in the bog; thirdly Winsby Field some miles from Horncastle: there are the three.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On the battlefield at Grantham, Lincolnshire, 23 mi.

<p><salute>Oh Babbie Babbie!</salute> &#x201C;I am a-weary a-weary,&#x201D; as ever was <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;Marianna of the moated Grange&#x201D;!</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Tennyson, &#x201C;Mariana.&#x201D;</note>&#x2014; Every day I pray to Heaven for just two things <hi rend="italic">quiet</hi> and <hi rend="italic">the free use of my faculties,</hi> and Heaven turns a deaf ear!

<p>Last Sunday<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1844-01-07">7 Jan.</date></note> I had thought to write you <hi rend="italic">such</hi> a letter&#x2014;as long as my arm&#x2014;and as interesting &#x201C;as&#x2014;as&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">anything&#x201D;!</hi> But &#x201C;the Countess&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Elizabeth Pepoli.</note> came and made me go out with her &#x201C;against my sensations,&#x201D; and I came in so chilled that I had to warm myself with <hi rend="italic">brandy</hi> and nestle on the sofa under that big shawl; that I might be resucitated for a party of <hi rend="italic">Americans</hi> that was to take effect the same evening&#x2014; And the wrteches<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> all came&#x2014;and there was such a drawling and <hi rend="italic">Si</hi>r-ing!&#x2014; I <pb id="pg-17-236" n="17:236"/>would have given a crown that you had been there for &#x201C;it was <hi rend="italic">strange</hi> upon <hi rend="italic">my</hi> honour&#x201D;! There was a M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> James with a wife and wifes-sister.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The elder Henry James, his wife Mary, and her sister Catherine Walsh. For James&#x2019;s account of the evening, see <hi rend="italic">The Literary Remains of the Late Henry James,</hi> ed. William James (Boston, <date when="1885-00-00">1885</date>), 441&#x2013;45.</note> &#x201C;Not a <hi rend="italic">bad</hi> man&#x201D; (as C would say) &#x201C;nor altogether a fool,&#x201D;&#x2014;but he has only one leg&#x2014;that is to say only one real available leg&#x2014;the other, tho the fellow of it to appearance consisting entirely of cork&#x2014; Now a man may be as agreeable with one leg or three legs as with <hi rend="italic">two</hi> but he needs to take certain precautions&#x2014; The onelegged man, is bound in mercy to all people with merely ordinary nerves to use some sort of <hi rend="italic">stick</hi> instead of trusting to Providence as this M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> James does. So that every time he moves in the room it is as if &#x2018;a blind destiny&#x2019; had been set a-going, and one awaits in horror to see him rush down amongst the tea-cups, or walk out thro the window-glass, or pitch himself head-foremost into the grate! from which and the like imminent dangers he is only preserved by a continual miracle!
For <hi rend="italic">me</hi> with <hi rend="italic">my</hi> nerves you may fancy the <hi rend="italic">awfulness</hi> of such a visitor!&#x2014; Of his two women what could anybody say?&#x2014;unless that they giggled incessantly, and wore <hi rend="italic">black</hi> stockings with lightcolour<supplied>[e]</supplied>d<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> dresses. Then there was an American <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;General&#x201D;!&#x2014;General Baird</hi><note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James said that &#x201C;a New Yorker was present, to whom his friends give the title of General, for no other reason that I can discover but to signify that he is nothing in particular,&#x2014;an agreeable-mannered man, however, with something of the new-born innocence of belief and expectation in his demeanor and countenance which Englishmen find it so hard to do justice to in Americans; and he was apparently defending, when I went in, our general repute for honesty from the newspaper odium which is beginning to menace it&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Literary Remains</hi> 441). Baird is otherwise unidentified.</note>&#x2014;the very image of M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Pecksniff, without the slyness. His ample breast was covered with a white waistcoat&#x2014;open very far down to shew the <hi rend="italic">broach</hi> in his shirt&#x2014;hair set round with pearls&#x2014;the whole thing about the size of a five-shilling piece! He seemed there as a living confirmation of Dickens&#x2019;s satires on the American <hi rend="italic">great men</hi><note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Writing to JWC, <date when="1844-01-27">27 Jan.</date>, Dickens said about the &#x201C;General&#x201D; and Americans: &#x201C;I am quite serious when I say that it is <hi rend="italic">impossible</hi>, following them in their own direction, to caricature that people.

Such unrequited devotion I have not found in all Israel!<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Matt. 8:10.</note> &#x201C;That minds me&#x201D; of a most absurd little incident which befell a week or two ago which I must tell you if my pen will hold out&#x2014;for the general amusement of your breakfast table&#x2014;</p>
<p>I received one day <hi rend="italic">by post</hi> a letter the handwriting of which was not new to me&#x2014;but I could not recollect in the first minutes whose it was&#x2014; I read the first line&#x2014;&#x201C;Oh those bright sweet eyes&#x201D;!&#x2014; I stood amazed &#x201C;as in presence of the Infinite&#x201D;!&#x2014; What man had gone out of his wits? What year of grace was I in? What <hi rend="italic">was</hi> it at all? I looked for a signature&#x2014;there was none! I read on&#x2014; &#x201C;There is no escaping their bewitching influence&#x201D;!&#x2014; &#x201C;Idiot&#x201D;! said I &#x201C;whoever you be&#x201D;! (having now <hi rend="italic">got up</hi> a due matronly rage) &#x201C;To write such stale nonsense to <hi rend="italic">me! and to send it by post&#x201D;!</hi> But I read on&#x2014; &#x201C;It is impossible but that <hi rend="italic">such</hi> eyes must be accompanied by a feeling heart&#x2014; Could you not use your influence with their possessor on my behalf? The time of <hi rend="italic">young Ladies</hi> is in general so uselessly employed that I really think you would be doing&#x2014; &#x2014;Miss Swanwick a kindness in persuading her to&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;translate for me those <hi rend="italic">French laws of pawnbroking&#x201D;!!!</hi> now it was all clear&#x2014;and I had the ridicule of finding that my virtuous married-woman-blushes had been entirely thrown away! the &#x201C;bright sweet eyes&#x201D; were not <hi rend="italic">mine</hi> but Miss Swanwick&#x2019;s and the writer of the letter was Robertson, who had repeatedly <hi rend="italic">raved</hi> to me about those Swanwick-eyes to a weariness!&#x2014; But have you often in your life heard of any thing more absurd&#x2014;more stupid (even for an Author) than this beginning of a letter to one woman with an apostrophe to the eyes of another! And when I told him afterwards the misconception thereby occasioned instead of feeling ashamed of himself he only laughed till the tears ran down!</p>
<p>Oh what an awful adventure&#x2014;a dinner party of eighteen and a cook <pb id="pg-17-238" n="17:238"/>with a cut vein! I can never understand how people outlive such things&#x2014;had I been the <hi rend="italic">Mistress</hi> in such a case I would have immediately <hi rend="italic">sailed for America,</hi> or gone up to the housetop and suspended myself from a rafter! Remember me to Gambardella since he has emerged again into the sphere of visibility, you may tell him I met his M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Reid at that Birthday party<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Nina Macready&#x2019;s party. For Mrs. Reid&#x2019;s difference with Gambardella, see <ref target="volume-15/lt-18421116-JWC-JW-01"><sic>15:189</sic><corr>JWC to JW, <date when="1842-11-16">16 Nov. 1842</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014;and had the honour of being regarded by her with a marked terror and dislike&#x2014;happily she went away soon&#x2014; You would have laughed to have heard her as I did trying to <hi rend="italic">indoctrinate</hi> one of Dickens&#x2019;s small children with <hi rend="italic">Socinian benevolence</hi>&#x2014;the child about the size of a quartern loaf was sitting on a low chair gazing in awestruck delight at the reeking plum-pudding which its Father had just produced out of &#x201C;a gentleman&#x2019;s hat&#x201D;&#x2014;M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Reid leaning <hi rend="italic">tenderly</hi> over her (as benevolent gentlewomen understand how to lean over youth) said in a soft voice&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">professedly</hi> for <hi rend="italic">its</hi> ear but loud enough for mine and everybody elses within three yards distance&#x2014; <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;Would</hi> not you like that there was such a nice pudding as that in every house in London tonight? I am sure <hi rend="italic">I</hi> would&#x201D;!&#x2014; The shrinking uncomprehending look which the little blowzy face cast up to her was inimitable&#x2014;a whole page of protest against <hi rend="italic">twaddle!</hi> if she could but have read it!</p>
<p>Mazzini was here yesterday so <hi rend="italic">bright</hi> as I hardly ever remember to have seen him. I saw one sunny flash in his eyes which might have been the first waking to life of Pygmalions Statue!<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Brought to life by Aphrodite in Greek legend.</note> his face is all but well now&#x2014; But besides <hi rend="italic">that,</hi> some &#x201C;change has come over the spirit of his dream&#x201D;&#x2014; I know not what it is&#x2014; I know only that he looked almost dazzlingly beautiful yesterday and that this beauty was plainly the expression of some inward newfound joy! Elizabeth came in&#x2014;&#x201C;the white face with which I had left her on Sunday had haunted her all the afternoon and she could not be easy till she knew how I was&#x201D;&#x2014; &#x201C;but I see&#x201D; said she &#x201C;with a peculiar look and tone that you are <hi rend="italic">QUITE well</hi> now&#x201D;&#x2014; The fact was, Mazzini and I had just been regaling ourselves with wine <hi rend="italic">figs</hi> and gingerbread, and when the rap came to the door I bade him put away the glasses and he put them into&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">my writing desk!</hi> so that when she opened the room door we both presented an unusual appearance of discomposure&#x2014;which Elizabeth whose head is always running on &#x201C;what shall I say&#x2014;strange things upon my honour&#x201D;&#x2014;interpreted doub<supplied>[t]</supplied>less<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> into &#x201C;a delicate embarrassment&#x201D; &#x2014;Elizabeth to have been always <hi rend="italic">virtuous,</hi> as I am sure she has been has really <pb id="pg-17-239" n="17:239"/>a curious incapacity of comprehending the simplest <hi rend="italic">liason</hi> between man an woman. She would not <hi rend="italic">sit down</hi>&#x2014;but having quite <hi rend="italic">looked us thro and thro</hi> (as she thought) went home &#x201C;to write letter&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>
<p>I have got back Geraldine&#x2019;s MS. very much altered and amplified<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Geraldine had sent the MS of <hi rend="italic">Zoe</hi>, with a separate note, &#x201C;on Wednesday last,&#x201D; <date when="1844-01-03">3 Jan.</date>, but it had been delayed. Apparently JWC first wrote to say that it had not arrived, expressing sympathy for its possible loss, and then (probably on Mon., <date when="1844-01-08">8 Jan.</date>) to say that it had come. Geraldine replied, <date when="1844-01-09">9 Jan.</date>: &#x201C;I am very vexed that you have been kept in any sort of discomfort. &#x2026; Even of the sympathy there has been none lost &#x2026; for it has made me love you even better than before, though I wish it could have been given without any sort of worry to you. But then it would not have been sympathy, and I am much too obliged and needy of it altogether to have the grace to wish it undone! Only don&#x2019;t let there come a reaction! I always feel inclined to revenge myself when I have felt too much&#x2014;by rushing an equal distance in the opposite extreme.&#x201D;</note> I cannot give an opinion of it as yet having read only two Chapters&#x2014;</p>

<p>I do feel so <hi rend="italic">tempted</hi> almost every day of my life at present for to be here in the present state of Cromwell is almost more than flesh and blood can bear&#x2014; However there is no use in Jeremiahds over what cannot be helped&#x2014; Cromwell <hi rend="italic">must</hi> come to an end or <hi rend="italic">he</hi> and I will come to an end&#x2014;and in either case there will be&#x2014;an end!&#x2014;</p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I should like extremely well to hear a little word from you, whether you are still at Gill, above all how you are in health:&#x2014;I will at any rate <hi rend="italic">write</hi> you a little word myself, which is next best. I find that if I write tonight and carry it up to the Town Post-Office, the Cummertrees Postman will catch it on Saturday, and you may get it without delay. A little word is all I can get done, for my hurry is great, and indeed the <hi rend="italic">fire</hi> is out in this upstairs room, so that at any rate I must be swift!&#x2014;</p>
<p>We are quite in our usual way of health, dear Mother; do not fret yourself with apprehensions about us, even if we did not write: make yourself always certain of hearing at once if there be any <hi rend="italic">ill</hi> news. I <pb id="pg-17-240" n="17:240"/>wish we could be as certain on your side! Jenny&#x2019;s last Note was not very satisfactory: but we will try to believe that there is nothing materially wrong still.&#x2014; Jack was here the night before last, and I had a Note too from him yesterday. He is very busy at the British Museum in these days; searching into old Books and writings; partly in help to me, I believe: many such researches are necessary for me in my present enterprise; and it is good work for a loose-bound man, as he is in these times.</p>
<p>As for my own poor Book I dare not say much about it; and indeed had better altogether keep silence, and plague nobody with it farther, for nobody can <hi rend="italic">help</hi> me in it, do what he will! It is a most difficult Book; but by the blessing of Heaven I hope to get it done yet, and to have accomplished something useful thereby;&#x2014;nay indeed I am sometimes taught more distinctly than usual that without the blessing of Heaven I <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> get it done,&#x2014;which surely is a wholesome lesson, and one we should be thankful for, even tho&#x2019; it come to us in pain. I have heard of an Italian popular preacher, who one day, before a grand audience, fairly <hi rend="italic">broke down</hi> and had not a word to say! His shame was great; he blushed, he almost wept; but gathering himself at last, he said, &#x201C;My friends, it is the punishment of my <hi rend="italic">pride;</hi> let me lay it to heart and take a lesson by it!&#x201D; So be it with us all.</p>
<p>&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;Since I began writing, Jack has come in; he waits till I have done with this, and then we will walk up the streets together.</p>
<p>The people in next house whose <hi rend="italic">Piano</hi> was so loud when I sat down to write, have behaved with the noblest civility; they keep their Piano silent every day rigorously till two o&#x2019;clock: at other hours I am not writing, and it does me no ill,&#x2014;rather does me <hi rend="italic">good</hi> when I reflect how civil the people are. There is great honour shewn here to the literary man!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Jane keeps very well. We have had just one day of frost, and that very trifling: I suppose more must be coming yet. Jane sends you all her kindest regards. I think I will remind her to write to my Mother, a scrap of a Letter by and by.</p>
<p>We consider that Alick will probably send us another Letter by the mail of next month. The American winter, it seems, is somewhat of a hard one; perhaps his Letter might be detained in the interior by snows Poor fellow, he will be very busy scheming out at present what he is to do, and whitherward to go for an abode to himself. My notion is, he will perhaps stick fast by Clow, which will be a great comfort to both of them.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >They stayed with Clow at Alton till <date when="1844-03-00">March</date>.</note> It is my greatest comfort to think that whiskey is out of the way: <hi rend="italic">its</hi> absence is right good</p>

<p>I have been very <hi rend="italic">sick</hi> all the week&#x2014;am very sick at this moment&#x2014;,and whenever it is so with me, the Devil puts it into the heads of ever so many people to write me letters of <hi rend="italic">a business sort</hi> requiring <hi rend="italic">immediate</hi> answer&#x2014; Now these are two afflictions together which <hi rend="italic">do</hi> <hi rend="small-caps">not</hi> make a consolation and between them my always intended letter to you has got itself crushed to death before it was born&#x2014; Today I did not come down to breakfast and have nevertheless had a mortal long letter to write about a most uninteresting and for me out of the way matter <foreign>viz.</foreign> the actual state of the book trade&#x2014;and now I have really not physical force remaining for my Babbie&#x2014;let this be merely then for a sign that she is in my thoughts&#x2014;which she need hardly I think ever doubt anyhow&#x2014; I hope to write at full length in a day or two&#x2014; Meanwhile I must not leave out C&#x2019;s message to Walter M. &#x201C;the box of tobacco arrived all <hi rend="italic">exquisitely correct</hi>&#x2014;except for one little omission&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">the bill</hi>&#x2014;which he (C) had expressly requested might be sent&#x2014;but he hopes to have soon an opportunity of settling with himself here at Chelsea&#x2014; Is our Walter not coming this way then?

<salute><hi rend="small-caps">Dear Miss Caroline</hi>,&#x2014;</salute>
<p>Your message is far from an intrusion; such a musical little voice coming out of the remote West, in these dull days, is not unwelcome to me, is rather apt to be too welcome! For undue praise is the poison of human souls: he that would live healthily, let him learn to go along entirely without praise. Sincere praises, coming in a musical voice in dull times, how is one to guard against them!</p>
<p>I like Verran&#x2019;s picture of himself somewhat better this time. It is good that he has got a wife; his manner of announcing that great fact, too, is very original! &#x2018;Four cows, with plenty of grass, three slip pigs.&#x2019;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Caroline Fox noted in her journal, <date when="1844-01-09">9 Jan.</date>: &#x201C;Fanny Allen sends a glorious letter from Verran. He says: &#x2018;I have three cows, three slip pigs; I&#x2019;ve plenty of grass, and a good sale for butter and cream. I&#x2019;ve the pleasure to tell you that I&#x2019;ve also got a wife, and my wedding-day was yesterday&#x2019;&#x201D; (187). Verran m., <date when="1843-10-30">30 Oct. 1843</date>, Ann Skinner, also of Callington; see I. Foot, <hi rend="italic">Michael Verran &#x2026; and Thomas Carlyle</hi> (London, <date when="1946-00-00">1946</date>) 53.</note> What are slip pigs? Pigs that have slipt or left their dam, and now feed on spoon-meat? All these things are good. On the whole, it was a benefit to lift this poor man out of the dark subterranean regions into the upper daylight, to the sight of the sky and green world. But it was not I mainly; no, it was another than I. The poor man, if well let alone, I think will now do well. Well let alone: it is an invaluable rule in many things,&#x2014;apt to be miserably forgotten in the case of Grace Darlings and such like!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For the heroic lighthouse keeper&#x2019;s da.

<p>By the by, ought not you, with your swift, neat pen, to draw up, on half a sheet of paper, an exact narrative of this man&#x2019;s act of heroism,&#x2014;authentic, exact in every detail of it,&#x2014;and reposit it in some safe place for a memorial of the same? There is no more genuine use that the art of writing can be turned to than the like of this. Think of it.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Apparently not done.</note></p>
<p>I am about writing upon Oliver Cromwell,&#x2014;still <hi rend="italic">about</hi> it; for the thing will not stir from the spot, let me shove it never so desperately! <pb id="pg-17-243" n="17:243"/>It approaches the impossible, this task of mine, more nearly than any task I ever had. How awaken an oblivious world, incognizant of Cromwells, all incredulous of such; how resuscitate a Hero sunk under the disastrous wrecks of two such centuries as lie dead on him?</p>
<p>If I had a Fortunatus&#x2019; hat, I would fly into deepest silence,&#x2014;perhaps into green Cornwall towards the Land&#x2019;s End,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cape on SW coast of Cornwall; westernmost point of England.</note>&#x2014;to meditate this sad problem of mine, far from Babylon and its jarrings and its discords and ugly fog and mud, in sight of the mere earth and sea, and the sky with its stars. But I have not such a hat, there is none such going, one must learn to do without such.</p>

<salute>Dear Sister,</salute>
<p>I have had your two Letters;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >One dated <date when="1844-01-14">14 Jan.</date></note> the second of them, with Alick&#x2019;s in it, this moment. For your news of our Mother, for this and all your punctualities, many true thanks.</p>
<p>The Books are not lost;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-17/lt-18431231-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1843-12-31">31 Dec. 1843</date></ref>.</note> after lying about a fortnight at the Book-seller&#x2019;s where Jack had left them duly, the wretched Bookseller returned them, &#x201C;not having room in his parcel,&#x201D; and they are now <hi rend="italic">here,</hi> safe under our Side-table, expecting a <hi rend="italic">better</hi> opportunity! I should have written last week to say so; but I am dreadfully hurried about; blockheads, twice over, came in upon me, and knocked the eye out of the evening in which I meant to do it.&#x2014; The Books themselves, moreover, ought to have been sent away to <hi rend="italic">my</hi> Bookseller,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Chapman &#x26; Hall; the other bookseller, perhaps Fraser&#x2019;s.</note> who will not refuse to carry them: but this too is still <hi rend="italic">un</hi>done;&#x2014;it shall be done before I sleep again. Now, while my hand is in!&#x2014; I cannot tell what to make of the &#x201C;Picture Books&#x201D; for James the Younger:<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >She wrote: &#x201C;The two picture books you spoke of being in the parcel for Jimm had not been put in which Jimm was a little hard to believe.&#x201D; TC had intended to send them; see <ref target="volume-17/lt-18431130-TC-JCA-01">TC to JCA, <date when="1843-11-30">30 Nov. 1843</date></ref>.</note> did I not send a <hi rend="italic">Tam O&#x2019;Shanter</hi> and some other tatter of a thing, purchased about <hi rend="italic">three</hi> years ago, and always turning up with its due label on it, having always been forgotten when there was a chance? And have I forgotten it again? I cannot find the article now at all; my esteemed young Philosopher must exercise the virtue of Patience! It shall be made good to him, now or henceforth.</p>
<p>I tremble for the fate of the Fowls you speak of,&#x2014;in this fermenting weather! You shall hear what has befallen when they come to hand. Luggage Trains between this and Liverpool are often very dilatory; or rather, I suppose, it is between Chelsea and the Railway Station here (some five miles off)<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Euston Station.</note> that the delay occurs. The union<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cloth made from different fibers; Jean describes them as &#x201C;wool&#x201D; and Janet as &#x201C;flannel&#x201D; (<date when="1844-01-15">15 Jan.</date>).</note> dresses will not spoil at any rate; not irremediably.</p>
<p>Alick&#x2019;s Letter is a great comfort to us; as doubtless it would be to our Mother most of all. Jenny has curtailed it sadly,&#x2014;poor Jenny doubtless had news other than cheerful for her in her part of the sheet:<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >About Robert Hanning. Janet&#x2019;s letter <date when="1844-01-15">15 Jan.</date>, did not mention him.</note> however, <pb id="pg-17-245" n="17:245"/>the tone of this latter part is comfortable and good. No Letter has yet reached the Doctor; we are therefore much in the dark as to Alick&#x2019;s actual plans and proceedings. I somehow should like better that he went to Canada, than back among those American woods. But it is a rough flitting any way. Do you understand that he is really keeping a School during the winter months;&#x2014;or is it only a quiz on his part? I rather think it is fact; and a very queer fact it is. When a certain old Lady Baird heard that her son, afterwards a famed General and &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Sir</hi> David Baird,&#x201D; was taken prisoner by Tippoo Saib in India, and confined with many others in a subterranean dungeon, all chained two and two,&#x2014;the good old Lady, after a pause, made this reflexion: &#x201C;The Lord pity the ane &#x2019;at&#x2019;s cheened to our Davie!&#x201D; Such a fiery <foreign>ettercap</foreign> [bad tempered person] was Davie;<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >David Baird (<date when="1757-00-00">1757</date>&#x2013;<date when="1829-00-00">1829</date>), gen., when serving as a capt. in India was captured by the Indian chief Hyder Ali and his son Tippoo Sahib and held captive for more than three years, <date when="1780-00-00">1780</date>&#x2013;<date when="1784-00-00">84</date>, under the most horrible conditions. His mother, Alicia, da. of Robert Johnstone of Hilltown, co. Berwick, was apparently not Lady Baird as his father, William Baird (d. <date when="1765-00-00">1765</date>), inherited the estate of Newbyth but not the baronetcy. For &#x201C;fiery <foreign>ettercap</foreign>,&#x201D; see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18321119-TC-JSM-01"><sic>6:259</sic><corr>TC to JSM, <date when="1832-11-19">19 Nov. 1832</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014;so of poor Alick&#x2019;s pupils. However, he seems to be getting really cheerier and better; and we can hope better and better of him.</p>
<p>My dear good Mother, how are <hi rend="italic">you</hi> (for she sits listening, I think while this is read)! Today there comes nothing for her but a newspaper: a letter had gone on to Gill last week; Jenny I suppose forwarded it.

I have long owed Scotsbrig Jamie a Letter too; I am getting in debt to all the world.</p>

<salute>Dear Jamie,</salute>
<p>It is a long time indeed since I got your Letter, and many a time have I been minded to answer you, had not some paltry thing or other always come in the way. I have been terribly beset, of late; my work getting on as ill as need be, among endless intricacies,&#x2014;sometimes not getting on at all. It will be useless to trouble you with all those things: it is better that I write now, now that I have actually shoved away my business, reason or none, and got paper before me.</p>
<p>Here you perceive is a Letter from Alick,&#x2014;or rather half of one; for the Letter was addressed to Jenny, and she has cut off the half that specially belonged to her (probably had news about her Luckless<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Hanning.</note>), and sent Jean nothing but the leaf that was rigorously hers. Jean sends it me yesterday; Jack saw it last night, and today I forward it to you.&#x2014; Alick seems to be very quiet thro&#x2019; the winter, and writes in fully a wholesomer way, I think, than we have seen heretofore. He has improved greatly too in spelling and penmanship. I find some trace of his giving lessons to little Boys and Girls thro&#x2019; the dead of the year; but whether they are only his own children or those of others too is not entirely clear by his expression. In either case I think it an altogether wise plan. The winter there is totally dead; steady ice and snow heaped up around all dwellings for many weeks and months: a man ought really to see in such circumstances what he can occupy himself in. You should write to Alick; the time is directly after you receive this Letter! If put into the Post-Office at Ecclefechan on or before the 2<hi rend="italic">nd</hi> of next month, he will get it, and find a great comfort in it. You at Ecclefechan pay a shilling with it; he for a few pence more has it handed in to him,&#x2014;safe over so many thousand miles of sea and land. It is a shame for people that have pens and paper, and are parted from one another, that they do not write.</p>
<p>And our good Mother, as we learn, is at Dumfries, and tolerably well; how long she is to continue there remains, of course, unsettled; so long as she can find it supportable for health, it will of course be cheerier for her. You too, it appears, have a mild winter; it has been quite unpleasantly warm and <hi rend="italic">clammy</hi> here, occassionally<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> dry and bright, however, as well as warm; and now in the figure of the sky and fields, when I go into the country, there is a distinct prophecy of spring.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-17-247" n="17:247"/>Jean speaks of a Package coming to us, with flannel dresses; still more questionable, with &#x201C;plucked fowls&#x201D;: we have not seen it yet, but may expect to do so in a few days!&#x2014; We ought to have thanked Isabella more expressly for our Butter: it is and continues to be of as good quality as I ever tasted that I remember; great praise! Nightly too the meal gets praises,&#x2014;often with some censure of the injudicious <hi rend="italic">cook;</hi> and every morning the Bacon Ham, which has stood an immensity of cutting, and still holds on, really with altogether superior excellence. Many thanks to you again for all those good things.</p>
<p>Your account of farming business is sufficiently distressing; it is a general story over the Empire at present. But manufactures are now brisker, for a time; there will be better prices for a time,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; only for a time. People here predict that the Corn-Laws, which are evidently fast going, will have gone altogether &#x201C;in two years.&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >They were repealed in <date when="1846-00-00">1846</date>.</note> It depends on circumstances; but &#x201C;two years&#x201D; is the time the weather-prophets set.&#x2014; Of course you are now and then making anxious question of yourself, What is to be done when your lease is out? Dear Brother, I can very well sympathize with you; but I can give you almost no advice. I think, however, in your own calm honest thought, you will be likely to settle somewhere near the real truth of the case,&#x2014;to ascertain, namely, what it is that you, there as you stand, <hi rend="italic">ought</hi> to do or try to do; and that well ascertained, is the whole mystery. I need not say that whatever help lies in me is always sure to you; upon this you can always depend. Indeed I have great comfort in looking at the steady way you bear your burdens: all of us are <hi rend="italic">loaded:</hi> as much as we can carry, in this world; and it behooves us to go steady, to go <hi rend="italic">canny,</hi> or we shall stumble in the quagmires and never get along! There are many bad and sad things in poor Annandale at present; but the <hi rend="italic">worst</hi> and <hi rend="italic">saddest</hi> of all I do deliberately define to be <hi rend="italic">whisky;</hi> other things are mixed, of God and the Devil; but this, as matters go, is well-nigh wholly of the Devil! By far the best news Alick sends of himself is that of his abandonment of drink. You, I think, were never in any danger from it; for God&#x2019;s sake have no trade whatever with it, keep a suspicious eye on every drop of it!&#x2014;</p>
<p>In autumn we were talking together about a House for our Mother, which, if it please God, she may need when your Lease is out.

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Today I must announce to you that the Box arrived last night; safe with all its contents; the cost of the whole carriage, porterage &#x26;c, from Assembly Street<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dumfries, the Aitkens&#x2019; home.</note> to Cheyne Row, was simply <hi rend="italic">five shillings;</hi> cheap enough! The package was so excellent, the screw-nails so tight, having no available screw-driver, I was forced to act on the lid with wrenches, and tear it to pieces.&#x2014; The fowls, two capital <hi rend="italic">chuckas,</hi> were in perfect order: Jack&#x2019;s is gone to him this morning;&#x2014;today I know he is to dine out; but it will keep bravely till tomorrow; as ours too will and must, for we too have a stranger coming tomorrow!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> Thanks for such good things. The union-dresses give the highest satisfaction; the socks are as pretty a set as I have seen for many a year.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-17-249" n="17:249"/>And now, dear Mother, what is the extent of Hugh&#x2019;s Bill?<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jean wrote, <date when="1844-01-14">14 Jan.</date>, that their mother &#x201C;had been back at Scotsbrig for some days on account of our Uncle Heugh McKinnon coming there on a visit or rather partly bringing the wool dresses which will be sent on from here on friday per steamer. &#x2026; My Mother directs me to say the union dresses are a very satisfactory article &#x26; moreover that they are paid &#x26; need no more <foreign>fash</foreign> [trouble] with them.&#x201D;</note> You must forthwith let me know. Four <hi rend="italic">unions</hi> (for you also I trust have got your two) and six pairs of socks: quick tell me! It is I that must and will pay it; so no words: it is quite impossible otherwise. Nay I employ Jean to ascertain for me; and know you will not be so unpolite as to deny.</p>
<p>It gives me great joy to hear of your being tolerably well,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jean reported, <date when="1844-01-14">14 Jan.</date>, that after being &#x201C;very feckless for some weeks,&#x201D; Mrs. Carlyle was now &#x201C;looking very well.&#x201D;</note> dear Mother: when you are tired of Dumfries, Scotsbrig will be the welcomer to you; it seems as if the Spring were going to come this year without any winter. Today our weather is quite bright.</p>
<p>Alick&#x2019;s Letter is very agreeable to us; a more cheery kind of Letter, and betokening more peace of heart than is usual for a long while past. His &#x201C;class,&#x201D; we think, must consist of his own <foreign><hi rend="italic">bairns</hi></foreign> only?&#x2014; I sent the Letter on to Jamie yesterday.</p>
<p>This morning I receive by Post a very agreeable gift from a Manchester Poetess and her Husband; a book inscribed to me in really an elegant and intelligent manner.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ann Jackson Hawkshaw (<date when="1813-00-00">1813</date>&#x2013;<date when="1885-00-00">85</date>), <hi rend="italic">Dionysius the Areopagite</hi> (<date when="1842-00-00">1842</date>).

H.&#x201D; On the back of the letter TC wrote, &#x201C;You may send this back directly in a blank cover&#x2014;with &#x2018;all well&#x2019; if you can,&#x201D; and enclosed it to his mother.</note> My own poor Book is not forgotten; but will take a terrible deal of <hi rend="italic">unseen</hi> work yet!</p>

<p><salute>Thanks for your long letter dearest Babbie</salute> which was the more meritorious in you; seeing that it was written <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;decidedly&#x201D;</hi> in the <hi rend="italic">reactionary</hi> State of over-excitement; a state in which one is much less disposed for writing than for lying on a Sofa and doing nothing&#x2014;or the nearest approximation to nothing, that I know of viz: reading french novels</p>
<p>I sympathize with you in your sympathy with Walter&#x2014;our own immediate Walter I mean<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Welsh, not Macgregor.</note>&#x2014;at the same time I who have no selfish interest in his being in Liverpool more than in Fife,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Where he was asst. minister in Auchtertool.

Better to grow up the solitary tree of the Desart for the weary Traveller to rest under and for the Birds of the air to make their habitations in, than to be a mere withered prop for parasitical plants in the garden of Paradise itself! <hi rend="italic">Decidedly</hi> I am giving too much rein to my imagination this morning, going to excess in &#x201C;tropes and figures&#x201D;&#x2014;so before I become altogether unintelligible to the merely human mind I will betake myself to matters on which it is impossible to be other than prosaical&#x2014; <foreign><hi rend="italic">Eh bien!</hi></foreign> I have swallowed a pretty number of <hi rend="italic">blue pills</hi> again, <pb id="pg-17-251" n="17:251"/>and suppose I shall be less bilious next week&#x2014;at least I am sure that I ought to be&#x2014;and if I am not.

<p><salute>Dear Emerson,&#x2014;</salute>Some ten days ago came your Letter with a new Draft of &#xa3;32 and odd money in it:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For &#xa3;32.8.2 from James Munroe &#x26; Co., for sales of TC&#x2019;s works. Emerson&#x2019;s letter was of <date when="1843-12-31">31 Dec. 1843</date>.</note> all safe; the Draft now gone into the City to ripen into gold and silver, the Letter to be acknowledged by some hasty response now and here. America, I say to myself looking at these money drafts, is a strange place; the highest comes out of it and the lowest! Sydney Smith is singing dolefully about doleful American repudiation &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">diso</hi>wning of the soft impeachment&#x2019;;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf.

<p>But now for the Draft at the top of this leaf. One Coleman, a kind of Agricultural Missionary, much in vogue here at present, has given it me; it is Emerson&#x2019;s, the net produce hitherto (all but 2 cents) of <hi rend="italic">Emerson&#x2019;s Essays</hi>.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henry Colman had given TC a draft on a Boston bank to pay Emerson for his English sales. John Carlyle told TC in a letter, possibly of <date when="1844-01-24">24</date> or <date when="1844-01-31">31 Jan.</date>: &#x201C;Mr. Hamilton desired me to tell you that he thinks 4 dollars 88 Cents a very good rate of exchange, &#x26; that you will do well to send the money to Emerson in the way Colman offers.&#x201D;</note> I inclose *<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;* I will send them by a private hand rather; this by post.

P. Clarke, the Boston banker. James Fraser had been the publisher. The papers were supplied by G. W. Nickisson, who had bought Fraser&#x2019;s firm.</note> I gather only that there are some 500 and odd of the dear-priced edition sold, some 200 and odd still to sell, which the Bookseller says are (in spite of pirates) slowly selling;&#x2014;and that the half profit upon the whole adventure up to this date has been &#xa3;24.15.11 sterling,&#x2014;equal, as I am taught, at 4.88 <hi rend="italic">dollars</hi> per pound <hi rend="italic">sterling,</hi> to 121.02 dollars; for which, all but the cents, here is a draft on Boston, payable at sight. Pray have yourself straightway <hi rend="italic">paid;</hi> that if there be any mistake or delay I may satisfy it while time yet is.&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; I add, for the intelligence of the Bookseller Papers, that Fraser with whom the bargain originally stood was succeeded by Nickisson; these are the names of the parties. And so dear Friend accept this munificent sum of money; and expect a blessing with it if good wishes from the heart of man can give one. So much for that.</p>
<p>Did you receive a Dumfries Newspaper with a criticism in it? The Author is one Gilfillan a young dissenting Minister in Dundee; a person of great talent, ingenuousness, enthusiasm and other virtue; whose position as a Preacher of bare old Calvinism under penalty of death, sometimes makes me tremble for him. He has written in that same Newspaper about all the notablest men of his time; Godwin, Corn-Law Elliot and I know not all whom: if he publish the Book, I will take care to send it you.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Gilfillan, <hi rend="italic">A Gallery of Literary Portraits</hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1845-00-00">1845</date>), included William Godwin and Ebenezer Elliott (<date when="1781-00-00">1781</date>&#x2013;<date when="1849-00-00">1849</date>; <ref target="volume-17/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/8673"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), the Corn Law poet (see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18320206-TC-MN-01"><sic>6:116</sic><corr>TC to MN, <date when="1832-02-06">6 Feb. 1832</date></corr></ref>). TC had possibly sent Emerson a copy of the <hi rend="italic">Dumfries Herald,</hi> <date when="1840-10-15">15 Oct. 1840</date>, with Gilfillan&#x2019;s review of <hi rend="italic">The French Revolution</hi> (see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18401017-TC-TA-01"><sic>12:290</sic><corr>TC to TA, <date when="1840-10-17">17 Oct. 1840</date></corr></ref>); or, more probably, the piece on himself later pbd. in <hi rend="italic">A Gallery</hi> 124&#x2013;54.</note> I saw the man for the first time last autumn at Dumfries; as I said, his being a Calvinist Dissenting Minister, economically fixed, and spiritually with such germinations in him, forces me to be very reserved to him.</p>
<p>John Sterling&#x2019;s Dial shall be forwarded to Ventnor in the Isle of Wight, whenever it arrives.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson wrote, <date when="1843-12-31">31 Dec.</date>, that as well as sending TC the <hi rend="italic">Dial</hi> for <date when="1844-01-00">Jan.</date> he was sending one for Sterling, as it had a review of his <hi rend="italic">Strafford</hi> and poems.</note> He was here, as probably I told you, about two months ago, the old unresting brilliantly radiating man. He is now much richer in money than he was, and poorer by the loss of a good Mother and good wife: I understand he is building himself a brave house, and also busy writing a poem.<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Coeur de Lion.</hi></note> He flings <hi rend="italic">too</hi> much &#x201C;sheet-lightening&#x201D; and unrest into me when we meet in these low moods of mine; and yet one always longs for him back again: &#x201C;no doing with him or without him,&#x201D; the dog!</p>

<salute>My very pretty Babbie</salute>
<p>Walter M. would tell you most likely that he all but persuaded me to go with him to Liverpool! And you in your sobriety of judgement would take the statement with &#x201C;a grain of allowance&#x201D;&#x2014; This much however I at first hand authorize you to believe, that Walter &#x201C;urged his suit&#x201D; with&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;</p><lb/>
<dateline>Wednesday [<date when="1844-02-07">7 February</date>]</dateline>
<p>So far I had written yesterday&#x2014;only so far when a <hi rend="italic">shower</hi> of little strokes with the knocker stopt proceedings. It was Robertson who &#x201C;on awaking that morning felt himself&#x201D; he said falling into <hi rend="italic">a state of collapse,</hi> so that he had resolved on flinging all work to the dogs, and taking instead a long walk with an agreeable object at the end of it&#x201D;&#x2014;it was then not twelve of the clock&#x2014;at one came Mazzini&#x2014;and we all <pb id="pg-17-257" n="17:257"/>three found ourselves called upon to discuss &#x201C;the prospects of Democracy&#x201D; till three (!) when Carlyle issued from his den and softly conveyed one of the men (<hi rend="italic">Robertson</hi> of course) away with <hi rend="italic">him</hi>&#x2014;leaving me to spend the rest of Mazzinis visit in walking to and fro in the sunshine on Cheyne Walk&#x2014;the first attempt at exercise in the open air which I had been up to since the day on which Walter saw me and would have persuaded me to go with him to <hi rend="italic">Liverpool!</hi> Oh if <supplied>[he]</supplied><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> had seen me the day after, instead of that evening when I was feeling nervously <hi rend="italic">unsettled</hi> and with a sort of tendency to develope the wings of a dove and fly away often the precursory state of <hi rend="italic">illness</hi> with me how wonderful would then have appeared to him his own project! It was such a day of headach of retching and fainting as I had not passed the like of for twelve months&#x2014;and ever since till yesterday I have been as <hi rend="italic">smashed</hi> as <hi rend="italic">kneaded together</hi> in consequence as a lump of glaziers putty! Oh no Dear! my heart <hi rend="italic">is</hi> set on a visit to Liverpool, and God willing I shall make it out before very long&#x2014;but at this season&#x2014;and until I have got up my strength again&#x2014;home with &#x201C;liberty to be as ugly and stupid and disagreeable as I please&#x201D; is the only rational place for me.</p>
<p>Walter spoke of being married in the course of a month&#x2014;but I do not think he had any care about my <hi rend="italic">assisting</hi> at the sacrifice at least he expressed none&#x2014;his chief motive in getting me to Liverpool seemed to be a generous anxiety about&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;you!!&#x2014;who he seems to have a <hi rend="italic">fixed idea</hi> are always in need of my <hi rend="italic">Shu-ping-sing</hi> faculty of seeing thro stone walls and setting all sorts of entanglements to rights&#x2014; <hi rend="italic">Now,</hi> it seems that you are <hi rend="italic">spoken of</hi> with Andrew Crystal&#x2014;and he (Walter) &#x201C;does not know what to think of it,&#x201D; and whatever he (Walter) does not know what to think of there is a need that <hi rend="italic">I</hi> should think of, and descend as a <foreign><hi rend="italic">Deus ex machina</hi></foreign> (a god out of a machine, since you have no <hi rend="italic">Latin</hi> you poor child!) into the thick of! Now really dear Babbie granted that you are becoming as great a bore with the number of your &#x201C;suitors&#x201D; as Penelope<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Beseiged by suitors in Ulysses&#x2019; absence.</note> was; I do not feel sure, that even if I were there transported by a <hi rend="italic">wishing cap</hi> or other miraculous means applicable to my circumstances, with all my eyes and ears opened as wide as wide could be and my &#x201C;Shu-ping-sing-faculty&#x201D; to back them out, I do not feel at all sure that I could penetrate the <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;<foreign>grande mistero</foreign></hi> [great mystery]&#x201D;&#x2014;in as much as I am still in a state of modest doubt whether there <hi rend="italic">be</hi> one to penetrate&#x2014;and suppose I could, did ever young Lady since the world began take counsel with the flesh and blood of her Cousin on the private affairs of her heart. She will regulate <hi rend="italic">these</hi> by <pb id="pg-17-258" n="17:258"/>her own discretion or <hi rend="italic">in</hi>discretion let the Sapient Cousin say or sing what she likes. And really as <hi rend="italic">she</hi> is the person chiefly implicated therein one cannot take it ill of her!&#x2014; <hi rend="italic">This</hi> however my good little girl I beg of you to lay to heart that if I find at any time that you have been getting up a little matrimonial transaction without (not asking my <hi rend="italic">advice</hi> which of course you would not follow) but without letting <hi rend="italic">me</hi> into a secret which I am so much interested in, from the very first moment in which it assumed an <hi rend="italic">utterable</hi> shape, I shall think you a very graceless Babbie and shall tell you no more <hi rend="italic">secrets</hi> of mine!&#x2014; By which arrangement you are likely to be a prodigious loser.</p>
<p>&#x2014;In sober sadness Babbie of my heart <hi rend="italic">are</hi> you thinking to marry this Mr Crystal&#x2014;or even thinking of thinking to marry him? &#x201C;Why not?&#x201D;&#x2014; I am sure for my part I see no good reason unless it be that neither of you ever happened to conceive the wish. In <hi rend="italic">that</hi> case it were certainly unadivisable but otherwise? Mr Crystal could keep your bit soul and body together could he not? he is as Carlyle would express it &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">not</hi> a <hi rend="italic">fool</hi> nor a <hi rend="italic">bad man</hi>&#x201D;&#x2014;is he not? and if these conditions be fulfilled&#x2014;why should not Babbie marry Mr Crystal and Mr Crystal marry Babbie if they be both of that mind? You observe that I do not know him the least in the world all the while&#x2014; I once I think met him on your upper stair&#x2014;but I have not even the faintest recollection how he looked&#x2014; Now do like a good child write me a letter <hi rend="italic">to the point</hi>&#x2014;if to that point and <hi rend="italic">some other points</hi> included you would be doing me a sensible kindness for I cannot help giving a certain attention to these <foreign><hi rend="italic">on dits</hi></foreign> when anything so precious to me as <hi rend="italic">your</hi> future is in question&#x2014; Tho I do not make much complaint on the subject I may just as well take this occasion to tell you frankly, that these letters which contain all sorts of things, except just the things in your own heart and the very things I want to be told about, if they do not anger me do always <hi rend="italic">afflict</hi> me more or less&#x2014;
The wearing of ones heart on ones sleeve is a thing which I neither admire nor practise, but the utterly shrowding it up and hanging it over with all sorts of frivolous disguises, with the person who perhaps is in the whole wide world the likeliest to understand it and sympathize with it, does seem to me a piece of unwisdom&#x2014;a willful rejecting of &#x201C;the good the gods have provided&#x201D; <note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Dryden, &#x201C;Alexander&#x2019;s Feast&#x201D; 107.</note> one! Do <hi rend="italic">I</hi> tell you all that makes <hi rend="small-caps">me</hi> ill just now and the time look &#x201C;out of joint&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi> 1.5.</note>&#x2014;no&#x2014;but only because a word to the wise&#x2014;that is, to the <hi rend="italic">sympathizing</hi>, is enough&#x2014;and I have spoken enough of these <hi rend="italic">words</hi> to <hi rend="italic">you</hi>&#x2014;for enabling you always to <hi rend="italic">divine</hi> all that I keep to myself&#x2014; But <pb id="pg-17-259" n="17:259"/><hi rend="italic">you</hi> have yet given <hi rend="italic">me</hi> no such talismanic <hi rend="italic">word</hi>&#x2014;or else I have not been <hi rend="italic">wise</hi> enough to <hi rend="italic">make it do</hi>.</p>
<p>Now you see dear this is a sort of <hi rend="italic">preaching</hi>&#x2014;or rather <hi rend="italic">praying</hi> letter&#x2014;and I will even let it stand for such without attempting to make the <foreign><hi rend="italic">amende honorable</hi></foreign> [apology] by tacking any extraneous matter in the shape of news to the end of it&#x2014; I am still very <hi rend="italic">sick</hi> in spite of my <hi rend="italic">airing</hi> yesterday and I write with <hi rend="italic">effort</hi> tho with infinite facility of good will&#x2014;</p>
<p>Mazzini was very glad of your letter tho he did complain that you had evidently <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;mended your pen at one place&#x201D;</hi> a proceeding which I felt to be inconsistent with a due trustfulness of friendship</p>
<p>My kindest love to them all&#x2014;and say yes I will come and cover them all with kisses but <hi rend="italic">not yet</hi>&#x2014; Bless thee my dear little good Babbie with many suitors&#x2014;<closer><salute>Your / own</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear FitzGerald,</salute>
<p>Your Irish Lord&#x2019;s Cromwellian Letter does seem, by your title of it, to be an unpublished one:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> it will be in excellently good time for me still, when he arrives here in the Spring; and I shall be right glad to see the face of it. The <hi rend="italic">first</hi> result I have yet made out by many applications of that kind!</p>
<p>Artemidorus, I learn, is a person that does not pay debts, or perhaps in still worse ways declines to reverence <foreign><hi rend="italic">meum</hi></foreign> [mine] and <foreign><hi rend="italic">tuum</hi></foreign> [thine]; and has accordingly in his old days got into a questionable repute in his neighbourhood,&#x2014;poor old man! Happily <hi rend="italic">he</hi> is no descendant of Oliver&#x2019;s; only married to a descendant, by the Richard-Cromwell branch, who it appears was, or still is, a very estimable old lady. The handwriting, I suppose, is by one of the young ones.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Richard Cromwell (<date when="1626-00-00">1626</date>&#x2013;<date when="1712-00-00">1712</date>), Oliver&#x2019;s third son. In fact, Elizabeth Oliviera Cromwell (<date when="1777-00-00">1777</date>&#x2013;<date when="1849-00-00">1849</date>), who m., <date when="1801-00-00">1801</date>, Thomas Artemidorus Russell, was the great-great-grand-da. of Henry (<date when="1628-00-00">1628</date>&#x2013;<date when="1674-00-00">74</date>), Oliver&#x2019;s fourth son. The Russells had seven surviving children.</note> Nothing will come of that.</p>
<p>Since my last writing, I have employed myself, on favourable occasions, <pb id="pg-17-260" n="17:260"/>in looking more minutely into the Lincolnshire affairs.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC wrote in his Journal, <date when="1844-02-02">2 Feb.</date>: &#x201C;Yesterday at the Museum&#x2014;dreary Vicars on the Lincolnshire fights of Cromwell.&#x201D; For John Vicars, see <hi rend="italic">Cromwell, Works</hi> 6:174&#x2013;77.</note> If you will actually go to that quarter, and explore it with eye and mind, you will do a most acceptable feat,&#x2014;and I am now prepared with all documents for you. But alas there has such a veil of stupid oblivious darkness settled over the whole business, that unless you are to go at any rate, no just man could advise such an enterprise! The best Topographical Books know nothing, and indeed less than nothing of it; so likewise the best <hi rend="italic">Lives of Cromwell:</hi> I used to think Kimber&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Life of Cromwell</hi><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Isaac Kimber, <hi rend="italic">Life of Oliver Cromwell</hi> (<date when="1724-00-00">1724</date>).</note> a kind of respectable Book, not entirely stuffed with falsehoods as all the others are: but on examining it here, I can convict it of almost as many errors as lines. <closer><salute><foreign>Eheu</foreign> [Alas]!&#x2014;</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Your Letter has come; and the Book, which, next time I passed Rodd&#x2019;s quarters,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably Thomas Rodd, bookseller and publisher, 2 Gt. Newport St., Long Acre; parcels co. unidentified.</note> was found waiting there,&#x2014;waiting, I suppose, because the &#x201C;Cheyne Row&#x201D; was unprovided with a &#x201C;N<hi rend="italic">o</hi> 5,&#x201D; which would have enabled the Parcels Company to do its duty without misgivings. This valuable Company carries all manner of Parcels for us from side to side of London, in swift jingling vehicles, the light Parcels at the rate of 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi> each; they are punctual too, but not quite so handy as the Postman at divining addresses when there is room for doubt in them.&#x2014; I have written to thank Mr Macknight, whose Father I remember very well, whose Gift I like very well:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Macknight (<date when="1810-00-00">1810</date>&#x2013;<date when="1878-00-00">78</date>), Writer to the Signet, treasurer of the Abbotsford Club, <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>; son of Thomas Macknight (<date when="1762-00-00">1762</date>&#x2013;<date when="1836-00-00">1836</date>), minister of Old Kirk parish, Edinburgh, <date when="1810-00-00">1810</date>&#x2013;<date when="1836-00-00">36</date>; ed. <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of Sir Ewen Cameron of Lochiell</hi> [<hi rend="italic">by John Drummond</hi>] (Edinburgh, <date when="1842-00-00">1842</date>).</note> and now, with thanks to yourself, this lets you loose from the transaction.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Lochiel&#x2019;s Memoirs,</hi> I expect, will give me some instruction about Glencairn&#x2019;s and Monk&#x2019;s Highland campaignings<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sir Ewen Cameron (<date when="1629-00-00">1629</date>&#x2013;<date when="1719-00-00">1719</date>), highland chief, led his clan against Commonwealth forces, <date when="1652-00-00">1652</date>; submitted on honorable terms to Monck, <date when="1658-00-00">1658</date>; supporter of Stuarts but finally submitted to William and Mary, <date when="1692-00-00">1692</date>.

Printing Societies multiply very strangely on all hands of us; and will grow by and by, I think, into something new and useful in our times,&#x2014;when the old Bookselling Guild (in the sense of a Publishing one) seems nodding towards Chaos, and can &#x2018;publish&#x2019; nothing but Pickwickeries and Tomfooleries and Harry Lorrequers<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charles Lever, <hi rend="italic">The Confessions of Harry Lorrequer</hi> (Dublin, <date when="1839-00-00">1839</date>). &#x201C;Tomfooleries&#x201D; may refer to Pierce Egan, <hi rend="italic">Life in London: or, the Day and Night Scenes of Jerry Hawthorn, Esq, and &#x2026; Corinthian Tom</hi> (<date when="1820-00-00">1820</date>&#x2013;<date when="1821-00-00">21</date>).</note> and such like: but they really ought, these Printing Societies, to consider their ways a little, and <hi rend="italic">edit</hi> their Books as well as print them; otherwise they too may become a nuisance! To judge by their outcome, I think your Scotch Societies seem to perform better than our London ones here: I read a very respectable <hi rend="italic">Maitland</hi> Book, <hi rend="italic">Clotness Collections</hi>, not long since; here seems a respectable <hi rend="italic">Abbotsford</hi> one;&#x2014;and I know one <hi rend="italic">Ballantyne</hi> Book that is more than respectable!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For the Maitland and the Bannatyne (called Ballantyne by TC) Clubs, see <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410106-TC-JGL-01"><sic>13:7</sic><corr>TC to JGL, <date when="1841-01-06">6 Jan. 1841</date></corr></ref>.

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I got a Note from Jean yesterday, in which she tells me that you got safely down to Gill on Thursday afternoon. I fancy you to be most probably still there; at least I will try you with a Letter thro&#x2019; Annan for Tuesday: if you be gone to Scotsbrig they will take care to send it after you without delay.</p>
<p>It is a great pleasure to me to learn that you are in your usual health, in spite of this hard weather; that is the best news that Scotland doing its utmost could afford me. Pray be careful of warmth and wrappage, dear Mother; also of your diet,&#x2014;in which I still think there might be many improvements, if you would take due thought of it. But you never do take &#x201C;due thought&#x201D; of anything that you think concerns yourself alone!</p>
<p>We are pretty well here, all of us: Jane is whimpering a little about the cold weather; but she has never been laid up with it yet; and now that our <hi rend="italic">snow</hi> is all gone and dried, and only a hard dry kind of easterly weather to struggle with, I expect she will get more robust as the season advances. We never had any winter, till three weeks ago, when frost, snow and all the rest of it came down upon us, at the wrong time: I hope it is done now.&#x2014; Jack seems to be very brisk; running to Museums, to Houses of Commons &#x26;c: I do not think he is contemplating any real <hi rend="italic">business</hi>, or feeling the want of any. It is very lucky for him in one sense that he can live on what he has already done and gained, without the need of working farther except as he likes. At the beginning of this month he wrote to Alick; I also meant to write, but found that the day was past before I bethought me. Alick&#x2019;s last Letter, which Jean sent while you were there, as you know, yielded me more satisfaction than any of the others. His mind, and whole fortune along with it, will clear up; by reflection, by solitude, and abstinence from all confusions <supplied>[of whisky?]</supplied>, a much manfuller and every way happier future, we may hope, is opening for him. This Letter gives me indications that <pb id="pg-17-263" n="17:263"/>I like well. What a blessing, were there no other, to have fairly <hi rend="italic">done</hi> with that accursed poison to body and soul,&#x2014;which keep a man all the days of the year in a grey Devil&#x2019;s-dusk, without his ever being able to see the real God&#x2019;s&#x2014;truth about his own self or anything he is engaged with! All good fruit becomes possible when a man bids <foreign>adieu</foreign> forever to this.</p>
<p>As to my Book, it is not absolutely stopping; but it is <hi rend="italic">going its own <foreign>gate</foreign></hi> [way];&#x2014;a much longer one than I expected it might be! I study to keep holding on; &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">slow</hi> fire does make sweet malt&#x201D;;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf.

<p>Now, dear Mother, you must let me know when you do get to Scotsbrig, and I will write to you again, and I hope, at greater length than now, when my &#x201C;hurry&#x201D; (too often the case) is really very great. Give our affectionate regards to Jenny (whose Letter I received<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably of <date when="1844-01-15">15 Jan.</date></note>), to James and Mary, and all the household.

The &#x2018;seven reviews&#x2019; above noted of were upon this. I believe it must have gone into the heart of one and the others in these times; it has been to me a considerable relief to see it fairly out of me, and I look at the disastrous condition of England with much more patience for the present, my conscience no longer reproaching me with any duty <hi rend="italic">I</hi> could do and was neglecting to do.

Jack lives all this winter in lodgings in Brompton Grove: not medically or otherwise occupied; a loose-flowing, far-roaming, much speculating man. He will never be a practising Dr I believe; he has gained money enough to live upon, and lost all habits that look towards serious exertion.&#x2014; My poor Brother Alick is in N.

<p>You were kind enough, the other night,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In his Journal, <date when="1844-02-02">2 Feb.</date>, TC noted: &#x201C;(Bound to dine tonight with the Monteagles,&#x2014;my first &#x2018;dinner out&#x2019; for many months).&#x201D;</note> to say something about speaking on my behalf to that Guardian of the State Paper Office, or even taking me in person to him, to consult about the possibilities of Oliver&#x2019;s Letters. I need not repeat that either or both of those favours would be of true service to me. If, any day, you do find yourself at leisure for such a charitable function as that of escorting me to the Paper Chaos, I shall have great pleasure in waiting on you, when and where you may be pleased to appoint,&#x2014;let the expedition yeild us a result or yeild<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> us none.

<salute>Sir,</salute>
<p>May I venture to trouble you, in your public capacity, with a matter which as yet concerns myself only, but which perhaps you will not judge to be altogether foreign from public considerations.</p>
<p>I have been engaged, for a long while past, in inquiries into the History of England during the Commonwealth Period, a section of our annals which is not wanting in interest to any class of Englishman, tho&#x2019; it lies involved hitherto in endless obscurities, misconceptions and confusions; and I have often had occasion to reflect, with regret and with surprise, that one important set of original documents connected with this Period, the Records namely of the City of London, do not appear to have ever been consulted, much less investigated and examined, with an eye to the historical elucidation of it.</p>
<p>The Records, I understand, are complete and copious; and much light for the History of that time, it is presumable, does lie in them. The Citizens of London and their Common Council, in that great struggle, were as the right hand of the Parliament itself; in constant communication and cooperation with it; their effort was, in many senses, the mainspring of the effort of the English People: in fact, it gradually becomes manifest, contrary to the commonly received opinion, that London was little less preponderant and incessantly momentous in our English revolution than Paris was in that of the French, of which it used to be said, &#x2018;France was Paris.&#x2019; The Records of such a City in such a Period ought to be made available to History. It seems unlikely that there should not be discoverable in them many indications, dates, details, illustrative of various things. The very names of the successive Lord-Mayors and City Authorities, during those years, might clear up many an uncertainty in our printed Books.</p>
<p>My own projects with regard to this piece of History, which would require, to do it justice, the work of more than one man, and far other furtherance and arrangements than seem likely at present, are as yet extremely hypothetical. What can be done, and what under the existing conditions must be left unattempted, can only become clear by degrees. <pb id="pg-17-266" n="17:266"/>But in the meanwhile I could wish, thro&#x2019; your means, respectfully to solicit of the Common Council an answer to this request and inquiry: Whether I, or some person<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >G. L. Craik.</note> better fitted for the work and equally approved by you, might be permitted to look into the City Records for those years; and ascertain, in the first place, what historical matter existed in them; in order that, if it seemed important, farther measures might be taken to have it rendered available, in some fit way, to the uses of English History? The years I refer to are those from <date when="1640-00-00">1640</date> to <date when="1660-00-00">1660</date>; or, to secure the full limits, we might say, <date when="1637-00-00">1637</date> to <date when="1663-00-00">1663</date>; twenty-six years in all. It ought to be very emphatically specified, what is in all completeness the fact, that the object is historical and such only; that the notes or extracts taken, if any, could be submitted to your approval and <hi rend="italic">imprimatur;</hi> that all conditions which did not render the enterprise itself impossible would be cheerfully complied with.</p>
<p>If you can, in some proper way, submit this request to the Gentlemen of the Common Council, I shall feel much obliged; if their answer happily prove favourable, I shall hope to proceed upon it without detriment to anyone, and with some advantage or likelihood of advantage to myself and many.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;<date when="1844-02-15">15 February 1844</date> / Of Mr. Thomas Carlyle, of Cheyne Row, Chelsea, for permission to search the City&#x2019;s Records, from about <date when="1637-00-00">1637</date> to <date when="1663-00-00">1663</date>, for the purpose of taking extracts for historical purposes. / Read, and referred to the Library Committee to examine and report&#x201D; (Letter-Records, Minutes of the Proceedings of the Court of Common Council, p. 61).

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Mr Craik, whom you very kindly received the other day, gives me to understand that a formal request drawn up on my part, and duly <pb id="pg-17-267" n="17:267"/>presented to the Common Council by your good furtherance, would probably open the way to some inspection of the City Records for the object described. I have drawn up such a request,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-17/lt-18440213-TC-HAM-01">TC to HAM, <date when="1844-02-13">16 [13] Feb.</date></ref></note> and will now commend it to your charitable help. When there is any answer from the Authorities perhaps you will have the goodness to let me know.</p>
<p>In one part of the Letter, it now strikes me, there is some allusion made to <hi rend="italic">a deputy:</hi> &#x201C;I, or some person better fitted.&#x201D; The &#x201C;person&#x201D; meant here is the Mr Craik whom you saw; and it would be a new obligation if the way were opened for him also; but if that occasion difficulty, I will beg you to suppress that.</p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I have received your volume of Poems, and read most part of them; which latter is of itself a fact that, in such a case, means somewhat with me! I find in you great fervour of temper; a genius hopeful, tho&#x2019; as yet in all senses <hi rend="italic">young;</hi> your brilliancy, your fire, playing greatly too much in the vague, like aurora borealis or sheet lightning, instead of being knit up into definite forms and thunderbolts. I will say very candidly, there seems to me the elements of a fine gift bestowed on you; if you have patience, strenuous diligence, humility; if you have all kinds of <hi rend="italic">strength</hi>, for all kinds will be needed, there may something really worthy come of it. The labour is terrible; but the reward is great.</p>
<p>Young men who ask my advice, in these times, I generally counsel <pb id="pg-17-268" n="17:268"/><hi rend="italic">not</hi> to write in rhyme or metre; but to try rather whether they can be &#x201C;poetic&#x201D; on a basis of fact and sincere reality, this great universe being full of such;&#x2014;for indeed all poetic forms are at present quite fallen into discredit, as they well deserved to do; and veracity not fiction was and is the true business for all human souls the highest as well as the lowest.&#x2014; But, on the whole, forms go for little; it is substance only that goes for much. Sound sense, human energy and intelligence shall be welcome to us, in rhyme or not in rhyme.</p>
<p>Your Critic in the Newspaper is abundantly ill-natured, ill-bred, and very unjust;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Literary Gazette</hi>, <date when="1843-12-23">23 Dec. 1843</date>, said: &#x201C;Here is a cat of another colour, and a strange wild cat it is. It is long since we encountered a minion of the moon so original in subject, thought, and expression. It was said of Oliver Goldsmith that he touched no subject which he did not adorn; and it may be said of Ebenezer Jones that he handles no subject which he does not make ridiculous. &#x2026; We might multiply examples of almost every sort of folly.&#x201D; The <hi rend="italic">Athenaeum</hi>, <date when="1844-04-13">13 April</date>, was less hostile, thinking his &#x201C;extravagance&#x201D; came from &#x201C;inexperience.&#x201D;</note> nevertheless it is my clear persuasion, his abuse will be of more profit to you than any praise he could have given. Never mind <hi rend="italic">him</hi>, nor a thousand like him; hold on your way, with your eye on quite other loadstars; and after years of manful silent industry,&#x2014;refining the gold in what hottest furnace you have, and &#x2018;consuming your own smoke&#x2019;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi> 148.</note> the while,&#x2014;let the world hear from you again.</p>

<salute>Dearest Babbie</salute>
<p>If I had not given some sign of life at Maryland Street before receiving your last, I would have written on the instant to explain the phenomenon of the unknown address, which had caused your sympathizing little soul a quite needless disturbance.

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Leaving aside the matter of <hi rend="italic">subsidies</hi>, I am again in a little antiquarian dubiety, from which it perhaps lies a little more in your department to deliver me. At all events I will acquaint you with it.</p>
<p>Noble in his very stupid <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of the Cromwell Family</hi> acquaints us (vol I. p. 100) with the interesting fact, if it be one, that <hi rend="italic">Oliver the Protector was Member of Charles&#x2019;s first Parliament</hi> (<date when="1625-06-00">june 1625</date>) for the <hi rend="italic">Borough of Huntingdon</hi>. Noble I have found too often to be an ass to trust him in this matter; I have therefore tried Willis&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Notititia Parliamentaria;</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Browne Willis, <hi rend="italic">Notitia Parliamentaria: or, an History of the Counties, Cities, and Boroughs in England and Wales</hi>, 3 vols. (<date when="1715-00-00">1715</date>&#x2013;<date when="1750-00-00">50</date>).</note> and find Noble indeed to be wrong, but perhaps Willis himself to be wrong also, and the whole matter involved in suitable <hi rend="italic">chiaroscuro!</hi> These are the features of it:</p>
<p>1. It appears from Willis (an exact man, conversant with the Petty-Bag Office<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >An office of the Court of Chancery, so called because the record of each case was kept in a small bag.</note> and the parchments), that in James&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">last</hi> Parliament, &#x201C;4<hi rend="italic">th</hi> Parliament, <hi rend="italic"><foreign>anno</foreign> <date when="1623-00-00">1623</date>, &#x201D; the two members for the</hi> <hi rend="small-caps">County</hi> <hi rend="italic">of Huntingdon</hi> were Edward <hi rend="italic">Montague Esq and Oliver Cromwell alias Williams K</hi>t,&#x2014;which I doubt not is the very fact; this Montague being of the Sandwich or Manchester breed,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edward Montagu (<date when="1602-00-00">1602</date>&#x2013;<date when="1671-00-00">71</date>), 2d earl of Manchester from <date when="1642-00-00">1642</date>; M.P. for Huntingdonshire, <date when="1623-00-00">1623</date>&#x2013;<date when="1626-00-00">26</date>; Baron Montagu of Kimbolton, <date when="1626-00-00">1626</date>; lord-lieut. of Huntingdonshire and Northamptonshire, <date when="1642-00-00">1642</date>; fought for parliamentary forces and held high command, <date when="1642-00-00">1642</date>&#x2013;<date when="1644-00-00">44</date>; charged by Cromwell with incompentency in prosecuting the war, <date when="1644-00-00">1644</date>, and resigned his commission, <date when="1645-00-00">1645</date>; chancellor of Cambridge Univ., <date when="1649-00-00">1649</date>&#x2013;<date when="1651-00-00">51</date>; after Restoration returned to high civil and military offices.</note> and this <hi rend="italic">Sir</hi> Oliver Cromwell alias <pb id="pg-17-272" n="17:272"/>Williams being the well-known Uncle of Oliver Protector, the Knight of Henchinbrook, &#x201C;Golden-Knight,&#x201D; so-called; who ruined himself, poor fellow, by his <hi rend="italic">golden</hi> habitudes, and had to sell Henchinbrook to the Montagues (Sandwiches, who still hold it).<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sir Oliver Cromwell was the eldest son of Sir Henry Cromwell, called &#x201C;the Golden Knight,&#x201D; because of his lavish display. Sir Oliver, even more &#x201C;golden&#x201D; than his father, offered lavish hospitality and gifts to James VI and I. Hinchingbrooke, a sumptuous mansion which had once been a nunnery, had been granted in <date when="1538-00-00">1538</date> to his grandfather Sir Richard Cromwell, who had changed his name from Williams in honor of his uncle and patron Thomas Cromwell, earl of Essex. Sir Oliver had to sell it, <date when="1627-00-00">1627</date>, to Sir Sydney Montagu (d. <date when="1644-00-00">1644</date>), M.P. for Hunts., <date when="1640-00-00">1640</date>&#x2013;<date when="1642-00-00">42</date>, father of Edward, 1st earl of Sandwich (from <date when="1660-00-00">1660</date>) and uncle of Edward, 2d earl of Manchester. TC called it a &#x201C;stately pleasant House, among its shady lawns and expanses, on the left bank of the Ouse river, a short half mile west of Huntingdon,&#x201D; standing still &#x201C;pretty much as Oliver Cromwell&#x2019;s Grandfather left it&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 6:22).</note> So far therefore all is right. But now</p>
<p>2. In the first Parl<hi rend="italic">t</hi> of Charles, the Parliament immediately subsequent, Willis tells us, the members for this same <hi rend="italic">County</hi> were &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">Edward Montague Esq</hi>&#x2019; (the same gentleman as before), &#x2018;and <hi rend="italic">Oliver Cromwell Esq</hi>,&#x2019;&#x2014;whom also I strongly suspect to be the same gentleman as before but <hi rend="italic">miswritten</hi>.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sir Oliver Cromwell was M.P. for Huntingdon in Charles I&#x2019;s first parliament, <date when="1625-00-00">1625</date>. Oliver the nephew was not an M.P. till <date when="1628-00-00">1628</date>.</note> This is the doubt I would fain clear up and reduce into a certainty one way or the other.</p>
<p>Noble, we see, is wrong; for the members for the <hi rend="italic">Borough</hi> of Huntingdon are, in <hi rend="italic">both</hi> those Parliaments, two quite other persons, &#x2018;Mainwaring &#x26; St John&#x2019;:<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sir Arthur Maynwaringe and Sir Henry St. John.</note> but is Browne Willis right?&#x2014; I have another fact or two that bears on it:</p>
<p>3. In the second Parliament of Charles, <date when="1625-02-00">feb<hi rend="italic">y</hi> 1625</date>&#x2013;<date when="1626-02-00">6</date>, the County members for Hunts are Edward Montague (as above), and <hi rend="italic">Sir Robert Payne</hi> (an altogether new figure). Our Golden Knight, I gather elsewhere, is about selling his Huntingdon estate in these days: the sale, of Henchinbrook &#x26;c to Sidney Montague (Edward the member&#x2019;s kinsman), took place in <date when="1627-06-00">june 1627</date>;&#x2014;the Golden Knight may well have declined sitting for the Shire in these circumstances! The members for the Borough are Mainwaring (as before) and J. Goldsborough.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Goldsborough.</note> There is no Cromwell on any side in this Parliament. But</p>
<p>4. It is indisputable, from Willis and many other public and private evidences, that in the <hi rend="italic">next</hi>, namely in the <hi rend="italic">third</hi> Parl<hi rend="italic">t</hi> of Charles, <foreign><hi rend="italic">anno</hi></foreign> <date when="1628-00-00">1628</date>, Oliver Cromwell the Protector, he his very self, did sit; and make a short pithy speech,<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1629-02-11">11 Feb. 1629</date>; see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 6:64&#x2013;66.</note> which all people have remembered. But note <pb id="pg-17-273" n="17:273"/>here, he sat for the <hi rend="italic">Borough</hi> of Huntingdon, not for the County; the County members are the &#x2018;Payne&#x2019; first seen in the 2<hi rend="italic">nd</hi> Parliament, and another new figure, &#x2018;Capel Bedal Esq.&#x2019;<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sir Capel Bedell (or Beadle), bart.</note></p>
<p>Is it at all likely that Oliver Protector, in whose circumstances about Huntingdon where he lived, there had no change taken place except perhaps an improvement, should have sunk from a Knight of the Shire in the first Parliament to a Burgess in this,&#x2014;even if he had ever been likely for a Knight of the Shire at all; which I think he never was, being a young man (five-and-twenty at the time), of small fortune and no business, whose Mother had set up a Brewery in Huntingdon?<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Royalist propagandists associated Cromwell&#x2019;s family with the brewing business. One story held that Cromwell and his mother carried on such a business after his father&#x2019;s death in <date when="1617-00-00">1617</date>; see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 6:24, and Antonia Fraser, <hi rend="italic">Cromwell, Our Chief of Men</hi> (<date when="1973-00-00">1973</date>) 14.</note> It must have been the Uncle, and not he, that was at any time Knight of the Shire. For those distinctions were far more marked then than they are now. I have a fourth Note to add:</p>
<p>4 <supplied>[5]</supplied>. That in the next Parliament, in the next <hi rend="italic">two</hi> Parliaments, the <hi rend="italic">Short</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Long</hi>, both of <date when="1640-00-00">1640</date>, our Oliver sat for Cambridge Town, having now removed into that County, and become distinguished by a public service there. For Huntingdon County, on these two occasions, sit Capel, Bedal (see above) and Sir T. Cotton (the celebrated Sir Robert&#x2019;s son and himself the &#x2018;celebrated&#x2019;); for the Town sit, <hi rend="italic">Will</hi>m Montague (a new Montague) and &#x2018;R. Bernard&#x2019; Recorder of the place.<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Short Parliament sat for three weeks, <date when="1640-04-00">April</date>&#x2013;<date when="1640-05-00">May</date>; the Long Parliament for over twelve years, <date when="1640-00-00">1640</date>&#x2013;<date when="1653-00-00">53</date>. The members for Hunts. were in fact Sir Thomas Cotton (<date when="1594-00-00">1594</date>&#x2013;<date when="1662-00-00">1662</date>), bart., son of Sir Robert Bruce Cotton (<date when="1571-00-00">1571</date>&#x2013;<date when="1631-00-00">1631</date>), founder of the Cottonian Library of early English MSS, and Sir Capel Bedell in the Short Parliament, and Sir Sydney Montagu (expelled <date when="1642-00-00">1642</date> and apparently succeeded by his son Edward, ca. <date when="1645-00-00">1645</date>) and Valentine Walton (ca. <date when="1594-00-00">1594</date>&#x2013;<date when="1661-00-00">1661</date>?), Cromwell&#x2019;s brother-in-law, in the Long Parliament. M.P.s for Huntingdon borough in the Short Parliament were Robert Bernard, recorder of Huntingdon, and William Montagu, of the Middle Temple (and a judge after the Restoration), and in the Long Parliament were George Montagu of Horton (ca. <date when="1624-00-00">1624</date>&#x2013;<date when="1681-00-00">81</date>), half-brother of Edward, 2d earl of Manchester, and their cousin Edward Montagu (<date when="1616-00-00">1616</date>&#x2013;<date when="1684-00-00">84</date>), brother of William and 2d Baron Montagu of Boughton, who succeeded in <date when="1644-00-00">1644</date> and was replaced by Abraham Burrell (d. <date when="1657-00-00">1657</date>), returned <date when="1645-00-00">1645</date>.</note> These are all my facts. Plenty, I daresay, you will exclaim!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Now, do you know any man learned in Parliamentary matters and records who could throw any light for me on this question? If so, it were charitable that he did it. A truth is good, a non-truth is bad everywhere in this Universe; and there are few men that ever lived here who deserve better to have the whole truth distinguished from the non-truth in their History than Oliver the Protector.</p>

If the difficulty be not too great, I should like at least to have the Willis reading, in my N<hi rend="italic">o</hi> 2., <hi rend="italic">verified;</hi> to know of a truth that there does on that place stand &#x2018;Oliver Cromwell <hi rend="italic">Esq,</hi>&#x2019;&#x2014;and also to understand from some competent person what chance there was of a mistake having been committed in the designation of him. I once thought of writing to Sir F. direct; but decide on giving you that blessing, that you may consult him <hi rend="italic">and</hi> any likelier man there is, if you see good.</p>
<p>On the whole, there is no haste about this thing; neither indeed is there vital importance in it for me. I must give myself a fair chance for evidence about it; but must also be ready to rest satisfied with bottomless dubiety respecting it, as respecting so much else in those unfortunate departments,&#x2014;forsaken by human wisdom and given up to human Stupidity as they have too long been!&#x2014; Some day or other I shall most likely burst in again for a clutch at your <hi rend="italic">Statutes,</hi><note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably MSS of statutes kept at the Public Records Office, though some were available in <hi rend="italic">The Statutes of the Realm &#x2026; From Original Records, etc. (<date when="1101-00-00">1101</date>&#x2013;<date when="1713-00-00">1713</date></hi>), ed.

<p>There is unfortunately, if also fortunately, not the smallest haste in this Lincolnshire business;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-17/lt-18440109-TC-EF-01">TC to EF, <date when="1844-01-09">9 Jan.</date></ref></note> the Fates, I believe, have too clearly said that the child <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> cannot be born this year.&#x2014; Also, they still say they know not in what year or whether at all! As you remark, he is a devil of a foetus to carry about with one!&#x2014;</p>
<p><pb id="pg-17-275" n="17:275"/>The rule of the matter, therefore, is: If you be at any rate going to Lincolnshire, go at your own time, and do this thing for me so as to amuse and instruct yourself with it; at least not so as to bore and burden yourself with it: any result you get out of it will be better than the round cipher I at present have; the smallest contribution shall be welcome. My notion is, that all tradition of the thing is utterly gone,&#x2014;far farther than you found it about Naseby: but I think perhaps the <hi rend="italic">where-abouts</hi> of these transactions might still be discovered by an ingenious eye, and the picture such a one could give me of the ground would be decidedly worth something.</p>
<p>I have never yet been in Ireland with Oliver; and will not go, except cursorily, if I can help it. The Irish department of our Civil War requires to be done <hi rend="italic">in little</hi> throughout; and Oliver&#x2019;s cutting off of the great fungous gangrenous horror that had grown together there, tho&#x2019; one of his best pieces of surgery, will not invite us to expatiate, I hope!&#x2014; Besides I never <hi rend="italic">saw</hi> a square inch of Ireland <supplied>[except]</supplied><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> with my mind&#x2019;s eye, and do not know it at all. Oliver&#x2019;s own Letters, I hope, which are very copious in that season, will suffice.&#x2014; Did you ever see Temple&#x2019;s Hist<hi rend="italic">y</hi> of the Irish Rebellion in &#x2019;41,&#x2014;Sir John Temple, Lord Palmerston&#x2019;s ancestor?<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sir John Temple (<date when="1600-00-00">1600</date>&#x2013;<date when="1677-00-00">77</date>), master of the rolls in Ireland, author of <hi rend="italic">The Irish Rebellion &#x2026; <date when="1641-00-00">1641</date></hi> (<date when="1646-00-00">1646</date>). Henry John Temple (<date when="1784-00-00">1784</date>&#x2013;<date when="1865-00-00">1865</date>; <ref target="volume-17/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/27112"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), 3d Viscount Palmerston, whig statesman, currently in opposition, and prime minister, <date when="1855-00-00">1855</date>&#x2013;<date when="1858-00-00">58</date>, <date when="1859-00-00">1859</date>&#x2013;<date when="1865-00-00">65</date>.</note> It is a small contemporary quarto of which certain pages are well worth preserving.</p>
<p>If your Brother can speak to the Duke of Manchester,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John FitzGerald (<date when="1803-00-00">1803</date>&#x2013;<date when="1879-00-00">79</date>) lived in Huntingdonshire, not far from Kimbolton Castle, the seat of George Montagu (<date when="1799-00-00">1799</date>&#x2013;<date when="1855-00-00">1855</date>), 6th duke and 9th earl of Manchester.</note> certainly it will be worth doing. Prior to <date when="1644-00-00">1644</date>, it is almost indubitable there must have been many letters gone between the Duke&#x2019;s ancestor and Oliver; they had even a controversy in a House of Commons Committee (of which Clarendon has left a story, that I have got some glimmering of light upon); but in the Spring of <date when="1644-00-00">&#x2019;44</date>, in the time of the Selfdenying Ordinance, they had an open public quarrel, and I suppose never corresponded more.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edward Montagu, 2d earl of Manchester.

The self-denying ordinance, stipulating that no M.P. should hold any civil or military office, was passed in the Commons, <date when="1644-12-00">Dec. 1644</date>, but rejected by the Lords.

<salute>Dear Jean,</salute>
<p>I have had your two Letters, the last of them yesternight. Thanks to James for doing what I wanted in regard to my Mother&#x2019;s money: here is the Sum, four pounds, which will be payable on Monday, and again make all straight between us.&#x2014; I had a Letter last night from Jenny, which indicates that our Mother has got back to Scotsbrig, and seemed to be rather improved by our<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> journey. I hope she will keep snug and warm, at home now, in these rough spring blasts and frosts. Winter seems to be here again for the third or fourth time in these late weeks. Yesterday we had sharp frost with clear sky and sun; today it is snow fast degenerating into sleet and rain.</p>
<p>Two nights ago Jack had a Letter from Alick: if it have not yet got round to you from Scotsbrig, you may expect it soon. It is a very distinct good letter; gives one a clear view of his present locality; but, of course, what he was to do when the Spring came remained still a problem to him. You did well to write;&#x2014;poor Alick, he seems to be recovering his serenity in some measure, and I think will do well in that new land.&#x2014; Jamie Brand&#x2019;s Letter is the <hi rend="italic">darkest</hi> I ever saw in the world! I <pb id="pg-17-277" n="17:277"/>have not yet got an attempt made to read it, but will, and take some order about conveying news of it to Alick.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-17/lt-18440303-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1844-03-03">3 March</date></ref>. James Brand TC&#x2019;s paternal cousin; see <ref target="volume-04/lt-18270101-TC-AC-01"><sic>4:177</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1827-01-01">1 Jan. 1827</date></corr></ref>.</note></p>
<p>When your Muirhead<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Muirhead, a bookseller and stationer&#x2019;s shopman in Dumfries.</note> comes, I will recognise him for what you describe; and if any chance of helping him arise, not omit it. He is coming to a very disastrous shop, I doubt, poor fellow. The quantities of unoccupied workers, and poor squalid people begging about the streets, are considerably greater than usual in other years: I believe the distress is now deeper in London than it ever was in those years; we do not feel it at first, till it tell upon <hi rend="italic">the rents</hi>, but <hi rend="italic">then</hi> we do feel it, and are near two millions in number!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I shall have to struggle and bore and dig amid endless rubbish, in a most deplorable way, for a long while, I find, before this <hi rend="italic">Book</hi> of mine can shew face in the world! There is no help for it. I feel when I am in good humour that I <hi rend="italic">can</hi> do it; which is a great comfort: then again, much oftener, it seems to me a thing undoable, barren, fruitless:&#x2014;in <hi rend="italic">both</hi> cases one must just hold on. The strength of man is his <hi rend="italic">obstinacy</hi>&#x2014;in a good cause!</p>
<p>One of the Cousin M&#x2019;Kinnows<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alexander McKinnon; see next letter.</note> has sent me a Note, which you see here, and a considerable sheet of doggrel verses, &#x201C;on the death of Wallace&#x201D; &#x26;c. Poor fellow,&#x2014;he seems a fine openhearted creature; but is seeking deliverance by a most <hi rend="italic">impossible</hi> path. Burn his Note when you have read it, and speak nothing of it. I will answer him today when I am clearing off score. Do not <hi rend="italic">omit</hi> to write! And be good and busy and brave;&#x2014;and fare right well, dear Sister! <closer><salute>Your affectionate /</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name></p>
<ps><p>&#x2014;Pity I had not taken a bigger bit of Paper:&#x2014;but indeed my haste is great!&#x2014;</p></ps>

<p><salute><hi rend="small-caps">Dear Cousin Alexander</hi>,</salute></p>
<p>I have looked over your verses,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On the death of the Scottish patriot Sir William Wallace (<date when="1272-00-00">1272</date>?&#x2013;<date when="1305-00-00">1305</date>).</note> and am well pleased to observe that you possess an intelligent mind, an open, affectionate heart, and are heartily disposed to do what you can for instructing and unfolding yourself. My very sincere wish is that these good qualities may be well turned to account, and help to make you a useful man, and effectual &#x201C;doer of your work&#x201D; in this world.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-17-278" n="17:278"/>There can be no harm in amusing your leisure with verses, if you find it an amusement; but certainly I would by no means recommend you to prosecute it in any way as an employment, for in that sense I think it can turn to nothing but an obstruction and a disappointment. Verse-writing, notwithstanding all the talk you hear about it, is in almost all cases a totally idle affair: a man was <hi rend="italic">not</hi> sent into this world to write verses&#x2014;no! If he finds himself called to speak, let him <hi rend="italic">speak</hi> manfully, some &#x201C;words of truth and soberness;&#x201D; and, in general, leave the <hi rend="italic">singing</hi> and verse-making part of it, till the very last extremity of some inward or outward call drive him irresistibly thither. Nay, in these times, I observe there is less and less attention paid to things in verse; and serious persons everywhere find themselvs disposed to hear what a man has to say <hi rend="italic">the shortest way and the directest</hi>&#x2014;that is to say, disencumbered of rhyme. I for my share am well content with <hi rend="italic">this</hi> tendency of the world.</p>
<p>If you will prosecute the cultivation of your speculative faculties, which surely is highly laudable in all men, then I should think it would be a much likelier method that you addicted yourself to acquiring real information about the things that exist around you in this world, and that have existed here: this, surely, must be the basis of all good results in the way of thought, speech, or speculation for a man. In a word, I would have you employ your leisure in reading instructive books, conversing with intelligent men, anxiously seeking out such, anxiously endeavouring to render yourself worthy of such. In Hawick there must be some public library, perhaps there are several. I would have you struggle to get admittance to one of these; perhaps that is not impossible for you? To read even a few good books, above all to read them <hi rend="italic">well;</hi> this is the clear way towards spiritual advancement; a way that will become always the clearer, too, the further one steadily persevers in it.</p>
<p>But on the whole it should always be kept in mind that a man&#x2019;s faculty is not given him in the long run for <hi rend="italic">speculation;</hi> that no man&#x2019;s faculty is so given him. The <hi rend="italic">harmony of soul</hi> which would fain utter itself from you in rhymed verses, how much nobler to make it utter itself in rhymed conduct! in excellent, manful endeavour to subdue the ruggedness of your life under your feet, and everywhere make <hi rend="italic">order</hi> reign around you of what is disorder! This is a task all men are born to, and all other tasks are either nothing or else branches of this.</p>
<p>Whether these hurried words will have any light for you at present I know not; but if my wishes could avail, you should not want for guidance.</p>
<p>Tell your good little sister to be very careful of the spring winds: <pb id="pg-17-279" n="17:279"/>summer will help her.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Marion was to die of consumption later in the year.</note> Give my kind regards to your father;&#x2014;and, persisting with the best insight you have, prosper well</p>

<salute>Dear Jamie,</salute>
<p>Your Letter came safe to hand; many thanks for it. I hope you did all your business successfully at the fair; my imagination often visited you there on the Wednesday after your Letter.</p>
<p>Last night there came a Note from Jenny; intimating that our Mother had got home again to Scotsbrig, and was in as fair health as usual. Really it is to be accounted at<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> great thing this, considering what weather she has had: I pray you see that see that she be kept warm now, and snug within doors, the good Mother, till these wild Spring blasts be over! Tell her also that I will send her some scrape of a pen before many days.</p>
<p>Did you get Alick&#x2019;s Letter? You were to send it on straightway I suppose to Dumfries: Jack had some notion of sending it to Dumfries <hi rend="italic">first,</hi> but I suggested to him that our Mother would be most impatient of all to see it, and that <hi rend="italic">her</hi> impatience had the best right of all to be attended to! We liked the Letter very well; a clear quiet account: some of us will write at the beginning of <date when="1844-03-00">March</date>: they cannot set out, I believe, Clow and he, for any travel, till about the beginning of <date when="1844-04-00">April</date>.&#x2014; Yesternight too there came a Letter from Jean, and enclosed in it, the blackest piece of written paper I ever saw,&#x2014;a Letter seemingly from James Brand to Alick: I have in vain tried to read it; human nature never before, to my knowledge, brought forth such an attempt! I do not consider that it can be worth sending to Alick; if anybody knows this James Brand&#x2019;s address (for I cannot in the least read it there), we will send that on, with notice that such a Letter has arrived; and remains to all persons dark as Egyptian Hieroglyphics.&#x2014;</p>
<p>What you undertake with regard to Farries&#x2019;s property is all right:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Apparently the same as Farish; see <ref target="volume-17/lt-18440123-TC-JC-01">TC to JC, <date when="1844-01-23">23 Jan.</date></ref></note> our Mother should be consulted herself&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">her</hi> view of the matter, if you can by assiduous cautious inquiry ascertain it, will be our chief direction. <pb id="pg-17-280" n="17:280"/>Consider it, examine it and her; Time will gradually bring us some light upon it.</p>
<p>But the chief meaning of my Note today is about those Tanned Sheepskins! Not that I want more of them at present; but that I want to account with you for those we have. The biggest of them all lies round my feet at this moment, and is daily throughout the winter a real accommodation to me;&#x2014;and a certain <hi rend="italic">remorse</hi> often strikes me that to this hour I have never properly settled with you about them. Well, we will finish that business in the way of <hi rend="italic">lumping</hi>,&#x2014;what is called &#x201C;<foreign>slumping</foreign> [considering together].&#x201D; Here is a sovereign enclosed, which you must give to Isabella with my regards, to buy the youngest <foreign><hi rend="italic">bairn</hi></foreign> a frock with, or herself a cap with;&#x2014;and now I shall enjoy the warmth of my sheepskin with unmixed thankfulness.&#x2014; You can add by way of news that the Butter still continues to do an excellent duty, really excellent; and that the ham&#x2014;has left an honourable remembrance of itself.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>My struggles with my poor Book are manifold; but I study to take them coolly: it will be a long, long story, I find, and I must just plod forward as quietly as I may. My health is not to be complained of at all,&#x2014;if I were to grow worse, I could get myself a horse again: but indeed I rather consider that I am slowly changing rather for the better in that respect. Jane too keeps tolerably well, tho&#x2019; frightened always for cold. Jack is attending as a Witness on a certain trial between one Fraser (whom you may remember as my Editor in old days) and his poor Wife&#x2014;whom, poor scoundrel, he had used, and is using in the unworthiest way.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Fraser (ca. <date when="1805-00-00">1805</date>&#x2013;<date when="1852-00-00">52</date>), former ed. of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Review and Critical Miscellany</hi> (see <ref target="volume-04/lt-18271020-TC-MAC-01"><sic>4:263</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1827-10-20">20 Oct. 1827</date></corr></ref>, vol. 5, and <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390526-TC-JAC-01"><sic>11:112</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1839-05-26">26 May 1839</date></corr></ref>), had married a well-to-do widow (formerly Blair, b. Vivian; see <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310815-TC-JWC-01"><sic>5:329</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1831-08-15">15 Aug. 1831</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-09/lt-18360824-TC-JWC-01"><sic>9:44</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1836-08-24">24 Aug. 1836</date></corr></ref>), used up her money in wild speculation, become bankrupt in <date when="1837-04-00">April 1837</date> (<ref target="volume-09/lt-18370707-TC-JAC-01"><sic>9:244</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1837-07-07">7 July 1837</date></corr></ref>), and later left his wife to the care of his friend and fellow barrister William Bagley, who did what he could to help her. Fraser brought a suit against Bagley, <date when="1844-02-19">19 Feb.</date>, basing it mainly on the evidence of dishonest servants. The defense brought evidence of his own misconduct. John Carlyle was a medical witness.
The verdict for the defendant, <date when="1844-02-22">22 Feb.</date>, was received in court with loud applause. Details are given in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, <date when="1844-02-20">20</date>&#x2013;<date when="1844-02-23">23 Feb.</date>, and <hi rend="italic">Examiner,</hi> <date when="1844-02-24">24 Feb.</date></note> She was a young widow with &#xa3;500 a-year; he a broken young man, having wasted his &#xa3;15,000 of fortune to the last penny,&#x2014;chiefly by getting into the hands of needy scamps, Irishmen &#x26;c, for he was never an unkind creature, and could not say No to anybody. They married some 10 or 12 years ago: he started again in hand, and seemed at first to prosper exceedingly; but &#x2018;Attorneys,&#x2019; scoundrels of one or the other hungry sort, again got him in lending; he fell into embarrassments,&#x2014;at last, he walked off to some obscure quarter of London, and left his poor fidgetting anxious wife to shift with her 4 <pb id="pg-17-281" n="17:281"/>children as she liked. She supposed him to be living with other women &#x26;c; spent much of her time in crying. Last year he wrote to her in the depths of abasement to advance him &#xa3;200, and he would go out to India, and then retrieve himself with it. He got the &#xa3;200; staid <hi rend="italic">where he was;</hi> and now, it being all eaten, he has started a public suit against his Wife for improper conduct with one of his friends who had assisted her sometimes in her distresses! There is no shadow of likelihood in the charge,&#x2014;and tomorrow, Jack hopes, <hi rend="italic">he</hi> will be condemned&#x2014;to <hi rend="italic">perpetual</hi> public disgrace at least.</p>

<salute>Dearest Babbie</salute>
<p>Before I forget will you tell my Uncle with a kiss that I consider him the most <hi rend="italic">virtuous</hi> father of a family I have ever known, and that having thus a whole &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Society for the Suppression of Vice</hi>&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A society, founded <date when="1802-00-00">1802</date>, by evangelicals of the Church of England.</note> within his own breast, there is every ground to believe that his Daughters will pass thro&#x2019; life like <hi rend="italic">living snow-drops!!</hi> And do not you embezzle <hi rend="italic">this</hi> message because you cannot understand it&#x2014;to my uncle it will be quite as intelligible as <hi rend="italic">his</hi> message was to me&#x2014;</p>
<p>For the rest Babbie you must be content with a small return this day for your two long letters&#x2014; All the last week I was kept in a very violent state of nervous excitement about a thing which you will think lay a good way out of <hi rend="italic">my</hi> road&#x2014;</p>
<p>But when one is disposed to be excited it makes little difference whether the immediate cause be personal or no&#x2014; And so my blood has been kept at the boiling point all last week by a &#x2014; &#x2014;<hi rend="italic">crim. con. process</hi> before the Guild Hall<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Criminal conversation process, a trial for unlawful intercourse with a married woman. The Guildhall is the Hall of the Corporation of the City of London, just N of Cheapside.</note>&#x2014;in which I was neither a principal nor even a witness&#x2014;but John was a witness, and <hi rend="italic">I</hi> made it my own affair&#x2014;from <foreign><hi rend="italic">esprit de corps</hi></foreign> Carlyle says.</p>
<p>There never was I believe a more infernal prosecution raised against <pb id="pg-17-282" n="17:282"/>any woman than this which occupied the Guild Hall Court for four whole days of last week and has been filling many columns of the daily Papers. Did you ever hear us speak of a William Fraser&#x2014;it was he of whom John said so many times over that &#x201C;with the best intentions he was always unfortunate&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310418-TC-JAC-01"><sic>5:263</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1831-04-18">18 April 1831</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014;till the phrase became a by-word in our house. Now and for a long while back he has been worse than unfortunate with good intentions&#x2014;having performed one atrocity after another till he has consumated all by a crim con process against the best friend he ever had in the world and his own ill-used long since deserted wife&#x2014; I cannot enter into the details of the transaction&#x2014;if you were to read the papers the impression left on your mind would probably be that M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Fraser was <hi rend="italic">guilty</hi> but with <hi rend="italic">such</hi> extenuating circumstances that no really just and humane person could lay his hand on his heart and say that she was really very blameable for having been guilty&#x2014;but Carlyle John all the men and women who have known personally the sort of woman she is, and the sort of life she has led, firmly believe her innocent in spite of all the perjured circumstantial evidence brought against her which after all was only inferential&#x2014; Think of its being made <hi rend="italic">criminal</hi> to say to a man who for years had been dining four or five times a-week in the house by her husbands invitation &#x201C;my dear will you ring the bell&#x201D;!!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A witness for the prosecution, formerly Mrs. Fraser&#x2019;s nurse, testified that when Bagley called, &#x201C;I never went suddenly into the dining-room but once while Mr. Bagley was there.

At length on Thursday night she had a verdict in her favour&#x2014;and tho from what passed in court it seemed to have been due to the evidence of her husbands monstrous usage of her rather than to that of her own innocence it was received with &#x201C;tremendous cheers&#x201D; in the Court house and all along the street&#x2014; John had been in court all the four days and sent me a d<supplied>[a]</supplied>ily<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> bulletin of the proceedings&#x2014;always like a Jobs comforter as he is winding up with &#x201C;that&#x201D; in spite of internal heartfelt convictions, there was every chance of its going against her&#x201D;&#x2014; And then Sterling sent me daily the Times&#x2014;and there I sat fuming&#x2014;wishing to be in the court to show up mistatements which nobody seemed to notice to draw palpable inferences which nobody seemed to draw. or at all rates to be with the poor woman comforting her&#x2014;but as I had never seen her but once in my life just after my first coming to London I feared she would not receive me while she was enduring the horrible uncertainty&#x2014; &#x201C;So soon as <pb id="pg-17-283" n="17:283"/>it <hi rend="italic">is</hi> decided&#x201D; I said to Darwin &#x201C;I will go and nobody shall prevent me&#x201D;&#x2014; &#x201C;whichever way it goes&#x201D;? said Darwin&#x2014; &#x201C;Yes&#x201D; said I &#x201C;and all the faster if it goes against her&#x201D;&#x2014; &#x201C;Bravo!&#x201D; said he&#x2014;with a benignant smile&#x2014; &#x201C;Oh said Carlyle the woman is not that sort of woman at all&#x2014;if you knew her you could not for a moment believe her to have done anything beyond <hi rend="italic">imprudences</hi>&#x2014;such as calling people <hi rend="italic">my Dear</hi> and all that&#x201D; (looking significantly at poor me)&#x2014; &#x201C;Ah!&#x2014;for my share&#x201D; says Darwin &#x201C;I cannot even see the <hi rend="italic">imprudences&#x201D;!</hi> &#x201C;Thank you for that&#x201D; exclaimed I with <hi rend="italic">effusion!</hi>&#x2014; The day after the verdict I had meant to go&#x2014;having sent her word before by John that I <hi rend="italic">must</hi> see her&#x2014;but that day I had my hands full at home from six in the morning till six at night I carried on one incessant alternation of fainting, retching, screaming, even Cromwell had to give place to me!&#x2014;and Carlyle was out and in fifty times during the day&#x2014;not with the usual &#x201C;how are you now Jane&#x201D;?&#x2014;but&#x2014;&#x201C;merciful heaven what <hi rend="italic">is</hi> this?&#x2014;what <hi rend="italic">can</hi> I do for you?&#x201D;

<p>Mr Carlyle, with compliments &#x26; thanks to Mr Nutt, begs to acknowledge the receipt of the Berlin Book-parcel<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably from Varnhagen von Ense, who had written to TC, <date when="1844-02-04">4 Feb.</date>, that he was sending a book giving an account of the &#x201C;ancient German Warrior&#x201D; found in a peat bog nr.

<salute>Dear Miss Rigby,</salute>
<p>I am shocked to discover that, in a moment of enthusiasm, I have voluntarily promised what it is not in my power to perform! On my poor shelves there appears nowhere any <hi rend="italic">Swedish Grammar;</hi> nothing but a wretched tatter of a <hi rend="italic">Danish Grammar,</hi> too ugly for being touched by you;&#x2014;and this latter, I begin to see, was what figured in my prophetic fancy last night:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A resident of Edinburgh, she was visiting at the home of John Murray (<date when="1808-00-00">1808</date>&#x2013;<date when="1892-00-00">92</date>; <ref target="volume-17/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/64907/19637"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), publisher, at Albemarle St. TC had met her in Edinburgh, and soon after her arrival in London she noted in her diary, <date when="1844-02-27">27 Feb.</date>: &#x201C;Mr. Carlyle called, bringing with him his wife&#x2014;certainly a more refined half; but he is an honest, true man, a character such as he himself can alone describe. &#x2026; He talked of Popery, Luther &#x26;c., quite in the &#x2018;Hero Worship&#x2019; style; only we quarrelled about Luther, whom he defined as a &#x2018;nice man,&#x2019; and I said he had nothing nice about him&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Journals and Correspondence</hi> 1:115&#x2013;16).</note> the fond Illusion of an excuse for seeing you a <pb id="pg-17-285" n="17:285"/>second time! Such phantasms attend us on our earthly pilgrimage. You must pity me and pardon me.</p>
<p>With many kind wishes, and at least one kind remembrance,</p>

<salute>My dear Cousin</salute>
<p>Your idea has not common sense in it! is in fact a manifestation of that tremendous state of bewilderment into which even the bravest spirits are apt to fall in the first week of their marriage! Bless your life! it is the &#x201C;new-marrieds&#x201D; (as Mazzini would say) who have to do all the <hi rend="italic">dining out</hi> in the first instance; we old-marrieds sit comfortably by our fire-sides and receive them&#x2014;poor victims that they are!</p>
<p>Come you <hi rend="italic">here</hi> then according to the custom of all civilized nations&#x2014;either Saturday or Monday. Tomorrow I have to offer up a sacrifice to the Evil genius of The <hi rend="italic">Piano</hi> next door&#x2014;</p>
<p>The old Thunderer is standing over me swearing that if I do not make haste he will be off without me&#x2014; I was so sorry at having missed you and little <hi rend="italic">Her</hi> (I take it for granted that she is less than myself)&#x2014; Oh that devil of an old impatient Man.</p>
<p>If I miss you today send me word which day you will come&#x2014;best to <hi rend="italic">turn over</hi> the Lady to me for the whole day and <hi rend="italic">you</hi> come to dinner at five</p>

<salute>Dearest Geraldine</salute>
<p>If my sympathy could do you the least good; you have it &#x201C;hot and hot&#x201D;&#x2014; nobody can appreciate the utter wretchedness of all <hi rend="italic">that</hi> better <pb id="pg-17-286" n="17:286"/>than I! Sick selves; sick <hi rend="italic">helps</hi>&#x2014; <foreign>Ach gott</foreign> [O Lord]!&#x2014; But the sick going out in a cab to seek their dinner! <hi rend="italic">there</hi> is a cut beyond even <hi rend="italic">me!</hi> We have sometimes gone <hi rend="italic">without</hi> dinner in this house for want of somebody to cook it&#x2014;and once when Helen had lain all day on the floor dead-drunk, and I could not go on doing her work without victual; I went in all simplicity to a neighbouring cookshop and brought away a <hi rend="italic">quarter of a pound</hi> of cold beef in a piece of grey paper! But mounting with Carlyle into a cab, and driving off madly to repair exhausted nature at the house of a friend is <hi rend="italic">a new idea</hi> for me, which I shall bear in mind for future emergencies! The very day I last wrote to you, finding <hi rend="italic">after I was in it</hi> that I might take Sterlings carriage to the Strand, I drove to Chapman &#x26; Halls and presented myself to these Dignitaries, without either M.S.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of Z<hi rend="italic">oe</hi>.</note> or <hi rend="italic">Credentials</hi> but on what M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Mudie would call &#x201C;the broad basis&#x201D; of my own feminine merits! You may think that it was taking my hens to market in a rainy day, going with my <hi rend="italic">feminine merits</hi> to an old dingy bookshop in the Strand<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Chapman &#x26; Hall, 186 Strand.</note>&#x2014;
But trust me for always knowing where and when I can turn my <hi rend="italic">womanhood</hi> to account&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">that</hi> I believe is an instinct which every woman beyond the rank of an idiot brings into the world with her&#x2014; M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Chapman had been several times to this house on business with my husband&#x2014;and on my husbands invisible hours had been shown in to <hi rend="italic">me</hi> as a substitute&#x2014;and on these occasions he had&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">blushed</hi> as if he were going to break a bloodvessel! and I having a great feeling for blushing men (when they are not sheepish withal) treated him with &#x201C;a certain&#x201D; marked politeness&#x2014; So I said to myself thou hast thrown thy bread on the waters and shallt find it after many days.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Eccles. 11:1.</note> Accordingly I asked not for Messrs Chapman and Hall&#x2014;but for M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Chapman and was told&#x2014;that his Sister was just dead and he could not be seen&#x2014;but that M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Hall was forthcoming&#x2014; I had chosen precisely the wrong moment&#x2014; However to come away with nothing whatever accomplished was contrary to my nature so I requested to see this Hall&#x2014;and a poor little insignificant spectacle it was! Sterling having followed me into the shop, not choosing that he should hear me talking <hi rend="italic">business-like;</hi> I requested to be taken into a private room and the small Hall with a look of considerable perplexity bowed me into his dark <hi rend="italic">Sanctum</hi> where stood to my consternation poor Chapman leaning on the mantlepiece and all bewept! the large face of him absolutely swollen with weeping&#x2014;however such is the ennobling power <pb id="pg-17-287" n="17:287"/>of a deep grief that he received me this time without any embarrassment but with the air of the most perfect Gentleman, and it was to him that I addressed myself after all&#x2014; I told him my own impression of your book, the impression which it had made on two men of cultivated minds,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Craik and Edward Sterling.</note> and my husbands idea of your general tallents &#x201C;tho he had not had time to spare from Cromwell to inspect this particular manifestation of them. And moreover I told him you were a sister of Miss Jewsbury<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Maria Jane Jewsbury (<date when="1800-00-00">1800</date>&#x2013;<date when="1833-00-00">33</date>), author; see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18401021-TC-GEJ-01"><sic>12:297</sic><corr>TC to GEJ, <date when="1840-10-21">21 Oct. 1840</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014;but very unlike her&#x2014;and to my thinking a person much more likely to suit our <hi rend="italic">existing</hi> public taste&#x2014;on which Chapman surprised me by saying &#x201C;Oh he remembered you perfectly he had seen you one day in my house&#x201D;&#x2014;<foreign>tant mieux</foreign> [so much the better]&#x2014; The result of this first visit was a promise from both Partners to &#x201C;give the <hi rend="italic">M S</hi> their <hi rend="italic">most serious consideration&#x201D;</hi>&#x2014; I did not however send it to them immediately&#x2014;judging that it would be better to wait a little till Chapman should have got thro&#x2019; the sad cares of his Sister&#x2019;s funeral and be a little more in a condition for giving &#x201C;serious consideration&#x201D; to any earthly thing&#x2014;
Meanwhile I got a note of <hi rend="italic">general recommendation</hi> from Carlyle&#x2014;which I am sorry I did not keep a copy of for your <hi rend="italic">amusement</hi>&#x2014; He had not read this M.S. himself, he said but &#x201C;a friend of <hi rend="italic">mature years</hi> (that&#x2019;s me!) quick insight and <hi rend="italic">sufficiently impatient temper</hi> had read it all thro even in its <hi rend="italic">Manuscript</hi> state and without a single expression of weariness&#x2014;but with apparent interest and pleasures, a fact which of itself said much he considered to its credit.&#x201D; To this note I added a repetition of my own favourite opinion, backed with that of the Thunder of the Times and the Author of the Pictorial history of England<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Craik was co-author with Charles MacFarlane, of <hi rend="italic">The Pictorial History of England,</hi> 4 vols.

When this Process came to light Carlyle and John were both <hi rend="italic">certain</hi> of its atrocity and that the poor woman had <hi rend="italic">done nothing</hi>&#x2014;for me after such treatment I should have stood up for her whether I believed that she had <hi rend="italic">done anything</hi> or no&#x2014;in fact I have quite made the case <hi rend="italic">my own&#x2014; &#x201C;<foreign>Esprit de Corps</foreign></hi> my Dear&#x201D;? says Carlyle&#x2014; <hi rend="italic">Before</hi> her acquittal I sent her a message by John that I begged permission to come and be of some comfort to her&#x2014;and on Saturday I went to see her&#x2014;perfectly indifferent in the warmth of my indignation how many people might <hi rend="italic">cut</hi> my acquaintance in consequence. Had you found her as I did&#x2014;streching out her arms to me from her bed, with a burst of hysterical weeping&#x2014;so pale and wasted and nearly out of her wits you could hardly have resisted the temptation to go off and assassinate the wretch of a husband on the spot&#x2014; I fear she will never be herself again in this world&#x2014;tho the verdict was in her favour it appeared to be due to the Jurys detestation of her husbands conduct rather than to their conviction of <hi rend="italic">her</hi> innocence and this is the public feeling about it&#x2014;for <hi rend="italic">me</hi> I solemnly believe her innocent&#x2014;but <hi rend="italic">that</hi> as I have said would hardly have increased my sympathy with her.<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jewsbury replied: &#x201C;I read the whole, and the possibility of her being guilty never occurred to me; and I was ready to scratch the stupid old judge for his qualifying assertions about her&#x201D; (Ireland 109).</note></p>
<p>I was to have gone again on Tuesday to have staid the whole day and Carlyle had generously promised to come and fetch me back&#x2014;but she was quite light in the head on Monday&#x2014;and continues in a dreadful way&#x2014; She has a young lady staying with her&#x2014;and her Sisters and intimate friends adhere to her and believe in her thank God&#x2014; I will do <pb id="pg-17-289" n="17:289"/>all I can to console her&#x2014;but it is so little! for I fear after all his diabolical usage and this infernal climax to it, she is still <hi rend="italic">in love</hi> with her own husband! several things she said to me the other day left that impression on my mind&#x2014;and that sort of feeling makes a woman eternally irrevocably <hi rend="italic">a victim</hi>&#x2014;</p>
<p>I have been very ill again myself&#x2014;but I have no more time for writing&#x2014;</p>

Talked of Oliver Cromwell, &#x2026; of Fanny Burney, &#x2026; of Bettina [von Arnim], of Marie Antoinette &#x2026; Never felt myself in more thoroughly intellectual society&#x2014;such great knowledge, and such equal originality.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>You get a Letter this time from Jamie at Scotsbrig, which we have read here on its way; wherein is given, with a minuteness that will be interesting to you, all manner of An<supplied>[n]</supplied>andale<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> public and family news: nevertheless I think I will add a word of my own, tho&#x2019; it can contain little of importance; I feel as if I could not let you go in quest of a habitation without at least sending you my spoken good-wishes.</p>
<p>Your Letters, coming so regularly, have been a great comfort to us all since you went away; my Mother in especial is greatly obliged to you. We gather from your writing a tolerably accurate notion of the new scene you are in, and of your winter&#x2019;s way of life there. You have had a solitary season of it; and inumerable thoughts, some of them sad enough, have no doubt passed thro&#x2019; your mind in that wide wilderness you have arrived upon the edge of, to push your fortune there. Such <pb id="pg-17-291" n="17:291"/>seasons often seem to ourselves painfuly idle, and as good as altogether useless and lost; by and by, however, we find that they were not so, that their fruits are the richest of all. As for me I like your late Letters from America better than any that I have seen; and prophesy for you with more confidence than ever a good future there.</p>
<p>We can give you no advice, dear Brother, as to what should be your course when the weather comes for travelling; we can only all of us heartily send you our prayer that you may be guided wisely, in the <hi rend="italic">best</hi> direction. You seem likeliest at present for an expedition along with Clow towards the Western Country. I have a feeling like Jamie&#x2019;s that there are rather more <hi rend="italic">agues</hi> there; more broken people too, and a wilder kind of existence in store for the emigrant: but of course our notion amounts to nothing practical, and cannot go for an advice at all. Could not you get some <hi rend="italic">handy</hi> bit of ground, tho&#x2019; less in quantity, for your money, where there are roads, mills, neighbours and arrangements,&#x2014;such a piece as you could hope to manage by yourself and your family chiefly (for Tom himself will be a strong fellow soon), and see yearly growing handsomer by your energy and order infused into it? That is the main happiness, I should imagine; to <hi rend="italic">see</hi> the fruit of one&#x2019;s labour, whether on a big or a small surface: indeed, it is the one blessing of human effort anywhere. I know not whether Canada and Scotch people might not be eligibler than the wide vacant west with greedy Yankees and their physiognomy of &#x201C;living red-herrings&#x201D;?
Alas, my dear Brother, I do not know anything about your great enterprise; it must be left to your own choice and wisdom. Only these things are very dear to me, three things which I will mark here for your good head: <hi rend="italic">first,</hi> that no earthly consideration should tempt one to settle in an unhealthy place,&#x2014;all things ought to yield, and you should <hi rend="italic">go</hi> to the healthier place, and reject the unhealthier, if these qualities be in them, <hi rend="italic">whatsoever</hi> their other qualities be: <hi rend="italic">second</hi>, that a large <hi rend="italic">extent</hi> of ground, and even fertile ground, may be a very dear bargain, in comparison with a small one; this seems to me an important truth, which a stranger from our old crowded countries might be very apt to forget: <hi rend="italic">third</hi>, that there is no necessity (whatever the human &#x201C;red-herrings&#x201D; and others around you may think), actually no necessity for &#x201C;making money&#x201D; in haste, or for making money at all! The blessedness of man, as I often say and feel, is to labour diligently, conquering his difficulties round him, and to see <hi rend="italic">that</hi> in some measure going on; on the great or the small scale, it matters little:&#x2014;he is doing the will of his Great Maker, I think, and may understand that it is well with him while he persists in this. It is only when one can see <hi rend="italic">no</hi> fruit of one&#x2019;s labour, and is utterly disheartened from carrying it on, that one gets entirely astray, and wanders <pb id="pg-17-292" n="17:292"/>without any sure guidance left.&#x2014; My dear Brother, these are but useless words, and can throw little light on the matter f<supplied>[or]</supplied> you; I will occupy no more of your poor sheet with them. May the great Guide put wisdom, patience, faithfulness, ever more into your own heart; that you may discern ever better what <hi rend="italic">is</hi> but to be done:&#x2014;in readiness to <hi rend="italic">do</hi> it, when once that is the case, I think you will not fail! We shall of course look with great interest for your next Letters: you will settle some way of corresponding; and not fail at any rate to keep your good resolution of writing with deliberate exactness once a month. Our good Mother thinks some of the <foreign>Bairns</foreign> should write to her;&#x2014;ask Jane if she is not up to such a thing? Dear little Jane, tell her she must grow a clever woman in that country; she will have plenty of honourable work there, if she shew herself what I expect!&#x2014; Alas, the sheet is just ending; and I, as it were, am hardly beginning.</p>
<p>All winter we have gone on here in the old way,&#x2014;Jane&#x2019;s health never good and also never totally bad. As Jamie tells you, we had no winter till the last month; I hear of Americans driving sledges 50 miles along the Hudson,&#x2014;a man was talking of that the other night, and it looked strange enough in our muddy region.&#x2014; I have had really terrible work with my attempted Book on <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi>, and must admit that with great labour I have got on as badly as possible, that indeed the enterprise still lies before me as huge and difficult, nay in sad moments, as impossible. But I must struggle on; <foreign><hi rend="italic">gar</hi></foreign> [make] <hi rend="italic">myself</hi> do it, as our brave old Father used to say! There is no other way for us.&#x2014; The misery of this country continues, and alas must long continue, tho&#x2019; there is some decided improvement of trade &#x26;c: the aspect of things, Ireland, England, Scotland, makes one sad and sick of heart.&#x2014; Jack rushes about here at a great rate, but does not fasten very heartily on any occupation, least of all does he seem minded for any medical one: of late he has lighted on some <hi rend="italic">historical</hi> departments, neighbouring to mine (old Manuscripts at the British Museum &#x26;c) and is making himself rather busy with those.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Carlyle wrote to his brother James: &#x201C;Tom &#x2026; is fighting a very tough battle with his new work, &#x26; has little time for writing, but I hear he is getting on somewhat better. He stands to his task every day constantly &#x26; energetically &#x26; must make progress &#x2026; I go on very quietly in my solitude, &#x26; spend most of my time reading. I also have taken to studying the times of Cromwell in original documents, &#x26; find much that is interesting in them&#x201D; (MS: NLS Acc. 9086).</note> He has no compulsion to work, poor fellow, but he also wants many of the fruits of working.&#x2014; My dear Brother, the paper is done here: I must send my blessings to you and Jenny and all your house, and abruptly close. <closer><salute>May <supplied>[G]</supplied>od bless you and guide you!&#x2014;</salute></closer><name>T. Carlyle</name></p>
<ps><p>Jane unites with me in every wish for you: your Letters when they <pb id="pg-17-293" n="17:293"/>arrive are always interesting to her. She has had great sufferings and sorrows since she lived near you, and is grown graver than ever, but also wiser, one may hope, and struggles faithfully along.&#x2014; When you communicate with Canada John give him my brotherly regards: I continue to send the <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi> to him weekly. Remember me also very kindly to Robert Clow your good neighbour, and say how heartily I wish his voyage good speed.&#x2014; Some two weeks ago there came hither (after lingering in Dumfriesshire a fortnight or more) the miserablest bit of Paper I ever saw called by the name of <hi rend="italic">Letter</hi>,&#x2014;addressed to you from James Brand (once of Craighouse) dated, something like &#x201C;Addys Swamp, <date when="1843-08-15">15 aug<hi rend="italic">t</hi>, 1843</date>.&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably either Addis (which was swampy), 8 mi. SW of Baton Rouge, La., or Addystoun, SW Ohio.</note> After reflexion, I decide on not sending it to you. It is black as a soot-besom (literally black), written <hi rend="italic">across</hi> as well as along; I could not for my life read it, nor do I think any body can. It seems to indicate that he was well at that date, that his sister was married to somebody; there is mention too of John Carlyle, who does not seem very prosperous; and then of great distress of times, prices of produce &#x26;c. I do not burn the thing, and will send it if you like to bid me.&#x2014;</p>

<salute><hi rend="small-caps">Dear FitzGerald</hi>,</salute>
<p>With real reluctance I have written that Note to the Lincoln Doctor;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >W. Cookson, M.D. FitzGerald had turned to his friend Elizabeth Charlesworth of Bramford, nr. Ipswich, who had relatives in Lincolnshire, for aid in obtaining information for TC about Cromwell&#x2019;s campaign in that county. She had probably suggested TC&#x2019;s writing to Dr. Cookson; see Terhune, <hi rend="italic">LEF</hi> 1:426, 432, 433. In order to communicate with Miss Charlesworth, FitzGerald said that, as an unmarried man, he had to write to her through her mother, Mrs. John Charlesworth, who in turn had to reply (see Terhune, <hi rend="italic">LEF</hi> 1:426, 429). In his first letter on the subject FitzGerald had written, ca. <date when="1844-03-01">1 March</date>: &#x201C;But as Carlyle is like to make good use of what we can find him, and make a good English Hero of Oliver&#x2014;something of a Johnsonian figure&#x2014;I hope you will try and pester these Lincoln ladies and gentlemen&#x201D; (Terhune, <hi rend="italic">LEF</hi> 1:426).</note> which, I think, you will perhaps be as wise to burn as to forward: <pb id="pg-17-294" n="17:294"/>&#x2014;beforehand I know almost for certain that there will nothing come of it but bad corresponding and botheration. Nobody does &#x201C;know&#x201D; anything,&#x2014;especially as to that unfortunate subject! However, that you may not call me cross and wilful, there is for you; do as you like.</p>

<salute>Dearest Babbie</salute>
<p>The little <hi rend="italic">ottomans</hi> (<hi rend="italic">stools</hi>&#x201D; is quite too mean a word for them) arrived a few hours after your letter and&#x2014;curiously enough&#x2014;were unpacked by&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">Walter!</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Macgregor.</note> while his, &#x201C;what shall I say&#x201D;?, <hi rend="italic">wife</hi>, was <hi rend="italic">taking off her boots</hi> in my room. Such beautiful little ottomans human eyes never rested on! I am glad to know who did which&#x2014;when I am to be sitting on <hi rend="italic">Babbie</hi> and when on <hi rend="italic">The Morning Star</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC&#x2019;s nickname for Jeannie&#x2019;s sister Mary. Huxley 262 wrongly thought it Margaret.</note>&#x2014;but it is, impossible to give a preference to one over the other&#x2014;both having reached the highest perfectionability point! To find <hi rend="italic">myself</hi> the possessor of such decorative pieces is quite a new sort of feeling for me,&#x2014;all my hitherto furnishings having stopt short within the sphere of the purely utilitarian&#x2014;when I look on these realized ideals of female taste inspired by <hi rend="italic">affection</hi>. I fancy myself &#x201C;one and somewhat,&#x201D; and that nobody can <pb id="pg-17-295" n="17:295"/>any longer deny that we too have <hi rend="italic">a drawingroom</hi> as well as other christian people&#x2014; A great many thanks and kisses to each of you&#x2014;and you may both assure yourselves that worsted-work was never in this world better bestowed than just on me who had none of it&#x2014;and who, judging by myself, am apt to rate peoples attachment by the number of their stiches. Certainly nothing but the most intense, selfsacrificing <hi rend="italic">passion</hi> could have carried <hi rend="italic">me</hi> thro one such stool! For the <hi rend="italic">tea</hi> it was a great idea! worthy of the Conceiver<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably JWC&#x2019;s uncle John Welsh.</note>&#x2014; One would say he had guessed in the spirit of divination the enormous run that had been on my tea-caddy all the last week! And wished to inspire me with a due trust in Providence. I shall not fail to report the result when I have tried it&#x2014;we pay at Chelsea 5/6 per pound&#x2014;in Pall Mall I can get it as good for 5/&#x2013; but it is not I think safe in London to venture lower than that&#x2014;</p>
<p>And so I have seen M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> W. Macgregor&#x2014;that I have with a vengeance! and my impression of her? Oh <foreign>mon Dieu!</foreign> my impression of her is one of immense unmitigated Aversion! Every body here is ready to scream at the very idea of her. They called last Tuesday or Wednesday&#x2014;I forget which&#x2014;and found me gone to Elizabeths whither they wandered in quest of me&#x2014;but missed the road. I asked Helen what sort of looking woman she was?&#x2014; &#x201C;A most <hi rend="italic">uncommon ordinar</hi> woman indeed&#x2014;nothing the least <hi rend="italic">insinuating</hi><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Helen&#x2019;s compliment for Jeannie; see <ref target="volume-15/lt-18421106-JWC-JW-01"><sic>15:167</sic><corr>JWC to JW, <date when="1842-11-06">6 Nov 1842</date></corr></ref>.</note> in her face that <hi rend="italic">I</hi> could see! she may be <hi rend="italic">intelligent</hi>&#x2014;may be!&#x2014;for <hi rend="italic">that</hi> I can&#x2019;t say&#x2014;but she looks so <hi rend="italic">displeased</hi>&#x2014;just <hi rend="italic">rale</hi> gloomy and <hi rend="italic">disconsolate!</hi>&#x2014;&#x201D; An odd description of a Bride&#x2014;but I am not in the way of attaching much importance to Helens descriptions What chiefly interested me was the thought of what I should do with them&#x2014; <hi rend="italic">Ask them to dinner of course</hi>&#x2014; As John Sterling says &#x201C;when you want to be civil to anybody <hi rend="italic">nature prompts you</hi> to ask them to dinner&#x201D;&#x2014; Easy to say&#x2014;but in the present afflicted state of this house hold&#x2014;a dinner even <foreign><hi rend="italic">dans sa plus simple expression</hi></foreign> [in its simplest form] is the fearfulest of bores&#x2014; I have not strength or fortitude enough to take even the slight handful of it which I am in the way of taking&#x2014; Helen left all to herself goes to nonsense and Carlyle, &#x201C;gloomy and disconsolate&#x201D; as <hi rend="italic">he</hi> is at present for ever and ever, looks like a chained tiger, when doomed to sit stuck up with company especially when it is <hi rend="italic">my</hi> company not of his own asking&#x2014;and there I sit in momentary expectation of Helen coming to a <hi rend="italic">dead stand</hi>, and of Carlyle brandishing the carving knife and ordering his guests to &#x201C;vanish in God or the Devil&#x2019;s name least a worse&#x2014;thing befal them&#x201D;! In virtue of being like the Pigs &#x201C;used to it&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech.</note> I preserve an outward <pb id="pg-17-296" n="17:296"/>calm thro&#x2019; these scenes of trial which might lead people to fancy me either the most <hi rend="italic">obtuse</hi> or most <hi rend="italic">philosophical</hi> woman that ever sat at the head of a table&#x2014;no matter which, so long as my pretended impassivity has much the same effect as Caleb Balderstons<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >An ingenious servant in Scott&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">The Bride of Lammermoor</hi>.</note> impudence&#x2014; <foreign>viz</foreign> that of making people doubt the evidence of their senses&#x2014;and keeping them from rushing wildly into the street to dine on a passing muffin or on nothing at all, rather than under the singular conditions that attend the dinners of a Man of Genius&#x2014;when the Devil has taken him and his under his own particular patronage.</p>
<p>At all <hi rend="italic">risks</hi> however the New-marrieds must be invited&#x2014;and this conclusion was hastened rather than otherwise by a note from Walter, which came a few hours after his call, inviting <hi rend="italic">us</hi> to dine with <hi rend="italic">them</hi>&#x2014;preposterous! <hi rend="italic">that</hi> would have been still worse, if it had not been <hi rend="italic">impossible</hi>&#x2014; So I asked them for one of three days and they accepted for Saturday&#x2014; I called in Sterlings carriage but missed them again, so left the note which I had provided myself with in case of such contingency&#x2014; To provided them with <hi rend="italic">some</hi> entertainment such as lay within my peculiar sphere I asked a <hi rend="italic">Lioness</hi> to come in the evening the <hi rend="italic">last new Lioness</hi>&#x2014;a rare creature indeed&#x2014; The Miss Rigby who wrote <hi rend="italic">Letters from the Ba<supplied>[l]</supplied>tic</hi><note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> &#x26;c, and who is now setting fire to the Thames as a Quarterly Reviewer&#x2014; Besides being a Woman of Genius she is a worlds wonder for <hi rend="italic">personal</hi> attractions&#x2014;six feet high! but so beautifully proportioned that you could not wish her a cubit less&#x2014;with the most magnificent St<supplied>[at]</supplied>uesque<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letters omitted.</note> head&#x2014;the expression of a Corrine,<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The heroine of Madame de Sta&#xEB;l&#x2019;s novel <hi rend="italic">Corinne</hi> (Paris, <date when="1807-00-00">1807</date>), a poet of genius and beauty.</note> and the gracefulest manners&#x2014; When I told Carlyle that I had done this thing he was like to go out of his senses&#x2014; &#x201C;What <hi rend="italic">could</hi> Miss Rigby make of the Macgregors or they of her&#x201D;?&#x2014;&#x201C;he had never seen me guilty of such a piece of pure distraction, many as were the distracted things I had done in the way of bring<supplied>[ing]</supplied><note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letters omitted.</note> incompatible people together&#x201D;!&#x2014; There was no end to his desparations&#x2014;for Miss Rigby appeared to have taken an immense place in his (Carlyles) imagination&#x2014; It was <hi rend="italic">done</hi> however&#x2014;&#x201C;with the best intentions always unfortunate&#x201D;! And so now &#x201C;I must ask any body every body to <hi rend="italic">dilute</hi> the horrible combination&#x201D;&#x2014; So I asked just everybody I saw and the produce was John Carlyle at dinner&#x2014;Old Sterling, and Arthur Helps and his Wife in the evening besides the awful Miss Rigby&#x2014; You may figure what sort of <hi rend="italic">anxious</hi> affair it was for <hi rend="italic">me</hi>&#x2014;and I was never thankfuler than when the door <pb id="pg-17-297" n="17:297"/>closed on the last of them and I could reflect that after all there were no lives lost&#x2014;</p>
<p>The Macs came at four&#x2014;to dine at five&#x2014;if they had been ten minutes later they must have arrived drenched to the skin for they had got into a wrong <hi rend="italic">Omnibus</hi> (!) and had to walk from Sloan Square&#x2014;and it came such a torrent of rain just after, that Carlyle had to come home in a cab The first look of the Bride did not shock me much&#x2014; I was prepared for something unprepossessing and she looked rather better than I had expected&#x2014;but when she had laid off her things, and sat down on a chair as if she were nailed to it&#x2014;with her lean little figure without so much as a handkerchief to break its angularity&#x2014;and when she spoke&#x2014;in that acrid brusque tone of hers&#x2014;my dislike grew every moment stronger till I was absolutely afraid of looking Walter in the face I was so sure that he must read there &#x201C;merciful heaven how <hi rend="italic">could</hi> you sell yourself for that woman&#x2019;s thousands&#x201D;?&#x2014; It is impossible Walter can <hi rend="italic">love</hi> that woman&#x2014; &#x2014;&#x201C;<hi rend="italic">amiable</hi>&#x201D;? she is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> amiable&#x2014;she is a limited, splenetic dirty little thing&#x2014;&#x201C;an ignoble rat-trap&#x201D; an &#x201C;insufferable little wild cat.&#x201D; as Carlyle among many other eloquent denunciations said of her. Carlyle has never ceased since lamenting over &#x201C;poor Macgregor&#x2019;s fate&#x201D;&#x2014;Walter himself was not so agreable as he used to be <hi rend="italic">here</hi>&#x2014;he was too noisy&#x2014;too excited&#x2014; Very affectionate poor fellow&#x2014;and trying to look content with <hi rend="italic">her</hi>&#x2014;but if he were really happy just now he would not take such pains to persuade people of it&#x2014;</p>
<p>As the Devil would have it Miss Rigby sat alongside of M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Macgregor on the same sofa and if I had taken pains how to contrive a mortification for Walter I could not I am sure have fallen upon a greater than showing him the two women in such near contrast&#x2014; And then M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Arthur Helps is like Titania Queen of the fairies!<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In <hi rend="italic">A Midsummer Night&#x2019;s Dream</hi>.</note> as lovely in her diminitive proportions as Miss Rigby is beautiful in her Gigantic ones! But when a man marries such a woman as that he must have abjured forever his faculty of drawing comparisons. Or have privately predetermined to <hi rend="italic">take a mistress!</hi>&#x2014; Now Do not think I am attaching absurd importance to looks&#x2014; I care less for <hi rend="italic">beauty</hi> so called than most people&#x2014;indeed I am certain that the women most truly and passionately loved are very rarely if ever regular beauties&#x2014;but it is the expression of a mean meagre <hi rend="italic">soul</hi> that is stamped on M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Macgregors face and manners and whole bearing which I cannot abide. And I am the more vexed at Walter having chosen such a wife because I am persuaded he was at a turning point in his own inward life&#x2014;and that this new influence which he has subjected himself to will prevent all the good aspirations <pb id="pg-17-298" n="17:298"/>that lay in him from ever working themselves into a practical shape&#x2014; Henceforth he is doomed to <hi rend="italic">ambitious mediocrity</hi>&#x2014;the pitiablest state in nature&#x2014; I ought to say however that John Carlyle thinks &#x201C;Walter has got a <hi rend="italic">pretty</hi> little woman for a wife&#x201D;&#x2014;!!</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">And</hi> now my dear I have written myself into such a passion on a subject which I have really after all no special concern with&#x2014;that I must leave the better things I had to say till another opportunity&#x2014;</p>
<p>I saw M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Fraser on Saturday forenoon&#x2014;she was out of bed on a sofa&#x2014;but still very feeble and dreadfully excited&#x2014; She had heard that her husband was ill&#x2014;had also been dilirious for some days after the trial&#x2014;and absolutely you would have said that she was dying to go to him and comfort him! She loves the man passionately&#x2014;there is not a doubt of it&#x2014;after all the woe he has brought her!! And in this moral slavery lies the fearfulest prospect for her. It would make anybody weep to hear how she defends him&#x2014;finds out excuses for him&#x2014;always ending with &#x201C;Oh poor William!&#x2014; God pity him! Where <hi rend="italic">can</hi> he wander?&#x201D; They are selling prints of him about the Streets under the name of <hi rend="italic">the handsome Husband.</hi></p>
<p>Again thanks and kisses to the morning Star and your sweet self and love to them all. And do not think me ill natured on your new kinswoman&#x2014;you will find when she returns that the aversion is quite mutual or I am greatly mistaken</p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Thanks for the news you send of yourself; interesting as all news of you are. I had already read your Public Letter, in Aird&#x2019;s Newspaper; <note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Dumfries Herald,</hi> <date when="1844-02-29">29 Feb.</date>, letter dated <date when="1844-02-27">27 Feb.</date> about withdrawing his candidacy for the Edinburgh chair of chemistry. Brown&#x2019;s work to produce silicon from carbon had been partly anticipated by an Irish chemist, Mr. Knox, whose work he did not hear about till <date when="1843-08-00">Aug. 1843</date>. Knox obtained similar results but drew different conclusions. Brown was unsuccessful in finding a new process to authenticate his results. He continued his efforts but felt that only withdrawal could &#x201C;preserve &#x2026; that serenity of mind and heart &#x2026; essential to the prosecution of researches so beset with difficulties.&#x201D; In justice to himself and his friends he reasserted his &#x201C;unshaken confidence&#x201D; in his experiments. No doubt Aird and TC were among those who had supported him; see <ref target="volume-17/lt-18430827-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1843-08-27">27 Aug. 1843</date></ref>. Aird appended a note to Brown&#x2019;s letter saying that it was precisely what might have been expected from this &#x201C;fine-minded young man.&#x201D; Brown continued to devote himself to research in chemistry, and William Gregory (<date when="1803-00-00">1803</date>&#x2013;<date when="1858-00-00">58</date>; <ref target="volume-17/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/11475"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>) was apptd. to the chair.</note> <pb id="pg-17-299" n="17:299"/>and found the step you had taken praiseworthy, and the manner of it right and dignified. You are now, at any rate, free of a huge embarrassment; master of yourself again,&#x2014;of whatever more. Nobody knows whether the loss, as it is called, is not a real gain to you;&#x2014;nay we do know very well that it is a gain, that all things to the wise man are a gain. Hold on your way, and leave their &#x2018;Chair&#x2019; standing there: it appears you you<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> were not made for it, but for another thing, on this occasion.</p>
<p>The magnitude of your Chemical Enterprises is manifest enough to me; is but too manifest. I fear you run a risk of being torn to pieces with that business, joined to the babbling and buzzing of so many idle persons hovering round you while in death-wrestle with it. Gently, gently; do not wrestle so! At all events, study to shut your ears wholly to the babble and bustle above-said,&#x2014;to be altogether deaf to <hi rend="italic">it</hi> as to a thing idle, not to say mad and mad-making. What can man do for a man? Almost nothing so handsome, in these hollow days, as leave him altogether alone; shut their idle jaws, and go about their own affairs, leaving him to his. Truly of many a man at the end of his course, you will say, Kind was the world that would yield <hi rend="italic">thee</hi> no promotion; that went on its way, and left thee to the rigorous and most blessed promotions and monitions of the Eternal Heavens in place of the Edinburgh Public!&#x2014; Dante, could his prayers, and his tears, and bloody sweat of the soul have availed anything,&#x2014;had been Mayor of Florence, with some kind of red or blue silk cloak on him; and no <hi rend="italic">Divina Commedia</hi> had come to light.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Heroes, Works</hi> 5:87&#x2013;88.</note> It is so with one and all of us who <hi rend="italic">are</hi> any real thing whatever, and not a mere semblance got together for transitory commercial purposes.</p>
<p>All this does not alarm me for you; but the fire in your own heart almost does. Let it not master you, quench it down to the verge of extinction rather; at whatever cost be you master of it. Speak not of making good your discovery or of dying: Oh no! You will <hi rend="italic">seek</hi> honestly for it, and that shall suffice.

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>It is a shame for me if I do not write a bit of a Letter to you; there is nothing else that I can do for you at present! I will scribble you a few words of news on this paper, let other employments fare as they can for the present.</p>
<p>I saw your good little Note to the Doctor; Jamie&#x2019;s Letter for Alick came duly to hand, and was duly forwarded; I also wrote a Letter to Alick myself. Poor fellow, I suppose he has had a very solitary meditative winter of it over in America, and has no doubt had a great many reflexions in his head,&#x2014;looking back and looking forward with perhaps sadness enough. But it will do him good, I really believe; perhaps this winter, seemingly one of the idlest he has had, may turn out to be one of the most profitably occupied. My own hope and persuasion is that he will now do well; that he is probably about to begin a new course of activity on <hi rend="italic">better</hi> terms than before, better terms both inward and outward; and that in fine, poor fellow, he may begin to see the fruit of his labour round him, and go on with much more peace and prosperity than heretofore. That total abandonment of whisky seems to me of excellent omen; I also like the tone of <supplied>[his?]</supplied> Letters, which is much quieter than it used to be. He does not know, I suppose, in what direction he is to go when <date when="1844-04-00">April</date> arrives: I urged, as Jamie did, that a <hi rend="italic">healthy</hi> quality of situation should outweigh all other considerations whatever; that, for the rest, all places seemed to me much alike; if the land was <hi rend="italic">cheap,</hi> it would be unfavourably situated &#x26;c. I also hinted my notion that a small piece of <hi rend="italic">good</hi> handy soil might be preferable to <pb id="pg-17-301" n="17:301"/>a large lot of untowardly outlying ground. We can only hope and pray he may <hi rend="italic">be</hi> guided <hi rend="italic">well;</hi> we cannot assist him with any real guidance. Difficulties beset a man everywhere under this sun; these, if he have patience, insight, energy and justness of mind he will daily conquer farther,&#x2014;not otherwise, either in America or here. But, as I said, I have never lost hope of Alick; and I have now better hope than ever. We will commit him to the All-wise Governor, with many a prayer from the bottom of all our hearts, that it may be well with him! To hear and know that he does see good under the Sun, fighting his way like a true man in that new country,&#x2014;what a comfort to you and to every one of us! My dear Mother, I know your heart is many a time sad about Alick; he is far away; and there are others of us gone still farther, beyond the shores of this Earth, whither our poor thoughts vainly strive to follow them, our heart&#x2019;s love following them still:&#x2014;but we know this one thing, That God is <hi rend="italic">there</hi> also, in America, in the dark Grave itself and the unseen Eternity,&#x2014;even He is there too: and will not He do all things well? We have no other anchor of the soul in any of the tempests, great or little, of this world. By this let us hold fast; and piously hope in all scenes and seasons whatsoever. Amen&#x2014;</p>
<p>You bid me &#x201C;call on Patience&#x201D; in this Book of mine; dear Mother, it is the best&#x2014;only good advice that can be given. I do endeavour to call on Patience, and sometimes she comes; and if I keep my shoulder stiffly at the wheel withal, we shall certainly get under way by and by. The thing goes indeed, or now promises to go, a little better with me; I stand to it as I can. But it will be a terribly difficult job, and take a long time; I think, however, that it is a useful one, worthy to be done by me; and so I will do it, if permitted,&#x2014;the return and earthly reward of it may be either great or small, or even nothing and abuse into the bargain, just as it likes. Thank Heaven, I can do either or any way as to that, for this time; and indeed, often when I look at it, the prizes people get in this world, and the kind of people that get them, seem but a <hi rend="italic">ridiculous</hi> business: if there were not something more serious behind all that, I think it would hardly be worth while to live in such a place as this world at all!&#x2014; In short, I <supplied>[hold]</supplied> on, the best I can;&#x2014;and my good Mother&#x2019;s Picture, looking down on me here, seems to bid me &#x201C;call on Patience,&#x201D; and persevere like a man.</p>
<p>Jane has not been very well in these cold stormy weeks; but I think is now getting better again. It is the Spring weather, which, this year, has been the real winter: all manner of people are unwell here at present. You in the North have it still worse, far worse, than we; many a time have I asked myself, What is becoming of my good old Mother <pb id="pg-17-302" n="17:302"/>in these wild blasts? Surely you keep good fires at Scotsbrig? Surely you wear the new Hawick <hi rend="italic">sloughs?</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Warm clothing brought by Hugh McKinnon from Hawick; see <ref target="volume-17/lt-18440124-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1844-01-24">24 Jan.</date></ref></note> Jane finds hers very warm and nice. But the thing you might improve greatly and never do, is your <hi rend="italic">diet.</hi> I think you should live chiefly on <hi rend="italic">fowls</hi>. A hen is always <supplied>[fair food. D]</supplied><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >From Copeland.</note>ivide her into four pieces, she makes you an <supplied>[ex]</supplied>cellent dinner of soup and meat for four days! This you know very well for others; <supplied>[but?]</supplied> never learn it for yourself. I am very serious: you <hi rend="italic">should</hi> actually set about this reform; do now,&#x2014;you will find it more important on your health than any medicine or other appliance you can think of.&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; Jenny, I suppose, is still at the Gill; when you feel tired of solitude again, she will come back to you. The <foreign>bairns</foreign> as they grow will be quieter and give less trouble. Poor Jenny, no doubt of it she has many cares of her own: we should all be gentle with her; pity her, and help her what we can.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>But now I suppose you are very impatient to know what is in that pasteboard roll tied with string. Open the string with your scissors, and you will see&#x2014;one of the ugliest pictures ever drawn of man! A certain person here has been publishing some Book called &#x201C;Spirit of the Age,&#x201D; pretending to give people account of all the remarkable men of the age; he has put me into it,&#x2014;better luck to him: he wrote to me several months ago requesting that I would furnish him with some Life of myself,&#x2014;forsooth! This I altogether begged leave respectfully to decline: but he got hold of a Picture that a certain Painter had of me; and of this he has made an Engraving, like <hi rend="italic">me</hi> in nothing, or in very little, I should flatter myself.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >R.

<salute>Dear Jean,</salute>
<p>These two weeks, I know not well why, I have been incessantly impressed with the idea that I should write to you; and now having the pen in my hand, and Jack having left your Note with me which I have just been reading,&#x2014;I will send you a word or two, with or without cause.</p>
<p>The machine you speak of for our Mother shall be attended to; I had not read your Note till Jack went away, otherwise I should have spoken about it this night. Poor body, she is but ill off in these rough spring days, and her strength is not now what it has been,&#x2014;our good old Mother! I believe a great deal of benefit might result from a better <hi rend="italic">diet</hi> for her, were there any means of enforcing that. But she will take no pains about it; and struggles always on till hard come to hard.</p>
<p>I sent her yesterday an absurd engraving of myself, which somebody has published in an absurd work here, called <hi rend="italic">Spirit of the Age</hi> or some such thing. It is not in the least like; uglier even than nature; and worth indeed nothing. The Picture it is done from is very ugly too, but very impressive, sad, really rather like. A certain young Quakeress at Falmouth sent up a pencil- or crayon-sketch of that, a good while ago; which was always meant for you; but being only half successful, and dreadfully ugly, and of considerable size (being pasted on wood), it has never yet gone.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Anna Maria Fox&#x2019;s copy of Samuel Laurence&#x2019;s portrait, sent to Jeannie Welsh, who had apparently sent it back. Jean Aitken replied, <date when="1844-03-17">17 March</date>: &#x201C;I am delighted to hear of Miss Fry&#x2019;s (is it) scetch of you we have a nice fram that I hope will fit.&#x201D;</note> We think of actually ridding our hands of it, by the Bookseller,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably Chapman &#x26; Hall.</note> about the end of the month. I have also got a <hi rend="italic">Don Quixote</hi> for the goodman, which will go at the same time; a poor old copy, but one readable,&#x2014;extremely well worth reading; for, as I say often, there are few more genial Books in this world. A laughter in it deeper than many a one&#x2019;s tears&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">Chuzzlewit</hi> also shall not be forgotten: what you say of him is the just judgement, poor Chuzzlewit; a really merry-hearted, musical, small chirping brother-man,&#x2014;equal to <pb id="pg-17-304" n="17:304"/>the ninth-part of a hero, and precious in a time when even real fractional-parts are rare!</p>
<p>For the rest, I want you to procure for me, from some glover, brace-maker, belt-maker or other worker in light leather, <hi rend="italic">four</hi> leather articles like the one inclosed here! Altogether at your leisure, for there is no immediate necessity:&#x2014;but I have a pair of braces which button themselves by means of a certain kind of elastic substance sewed into four leathers of that kind, and running thro&#x2019; an iron staple in the apparatus,&#x2014;in a way greatly to my mind: the &#x2018;elastic substance&#x2019; I have, with great difficulty discovered in the shops here; and had three or four new sets of <hi rend="italic">it</hi> sewed into the buttoning leathers,&#x2014;and now these latter, you see are a wreck! Four of them; with due <hi rend="italic">holes</hi> made for the sewer:&#x2014;that will keep me going for some years again!</p>
<p>My Book is still a frightful concern; but I begin to feel that it must at last get under way. Jane has been poorly, and is better again; it was the cold weather mainly&#x2014; She salutes you all&#x2014; &#x2014;Poor old Clyde, what an <hi rend="italic">ir</hi>reverent, very low-minded proceeding that is!

The parish could not afford both, and early <date when="1844-00-00">1844</date>, after Scott&#x2019;s resignation, Clyde seems to have offered to take a smaller stipend. It was agreed that he should keep the manse and &#xa3;20 p.a. and preside at alternate communions, leaving the main work to Scott.
Jean Aitken wrote to TC, <date when="1844-03-25">25 March</date>, that Scott withdrew his resignation &#x201C;in five minutes after Mr Clyde was disposed of. &#x2026; It was truly merciless to see the way in which the good old Man was browbeaten by this despicable presbytry for no reason that one could see except it were that he was the best man among them.&#x201D; Scott remained minister till his death. Jean also wrote about other Dumfries ministers, all unsatisfactory, though &#x201C;old Mr Reid the Catholick Priest as a man comes nearest ones notions of what a minister should be an humble &#x26; I believe good man.&#x201D;</note>&#x2014; <closer><salute>Good night, dear Jean; blessings be with you and yours.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jean wrote, <date when="1844-03-17">17 March</date>: &#x201C;Tom is peching &#x26; staring at every letter I write still thinking it will turn out a face or picture of some sort poor slut he does not hear any better yet but is in better trim otherwise.&#x2014; If he should even be altogether dumb he is not without <hi rend="italic">gumption</hi> &#x26; will make a portrait painter. &#x2026; I was much shocked the other day to see poor Maxwell [the portrait painter] &#x2026; like a purboded spectre.&#x201D; James said he was &#x201C;a total wreck with drink&#x201D;; see <ref target="volume-15/lt-18421017-TC-JCA-01"><sic>15:130</sic><corr>TC to JCA, <date when="1832-10-17">17 Oct. 1832</date></corr></ref>.</note> /</salute></closer> <name>T.

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I have to thank you for the kind gift of your new Book; and should, and but for accidents would, have have<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> done so a good many weeks ago.</p>
<p>I have read the <hi rend="italic">Miller of Deanhaugh</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >(Edinburgh, <date when="1844-00-00">1844</date>).</note> with due appreciation of its various genial qualities; with due interest in itself and its Author. In your Scotch rhymes I find a certain savage picturesqueness, sometimes a deep pathos; these please me best, on the whole. Some of your Edinburgh figures, such as you have yourself known, are very genuine delineations; &#x201C;Coal Jock&#x201D; and others I recognise with great welcome! Your Artist<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alexander A. Ritchie, artist, 1 St. John&#x2019;s Hill, Edinburgh. He also illustrated some later edns. of Ballantine&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">The Gaberlunzie&#x2019;s Wallet.</hi></note> too has his merits; and supports your pen with a true pencil in many cases.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-17-306" n="17:306"/>I suppose your plan of publication by monthly parts, which necessitates a too rapid mode of operation on your part, is somewhat unfavourable to you. But then, on the other hand, it is probably the best or the only convenient plan that offers itself to you for publishing. What can we say? That a true man will do his best, and manfully struggle to do ever better, under the given conditions. His faithful struggle will improve the conditions themselves, and alter them; will gradually improve all things. You are to keep your eyes and your heart open, your hand ready and diligent; to learn more and more what <hi rend="italic">is</hi> true, and adhere more and more to that.</p>
<p>You plead with real earnestness for mercy to the poor, for general mercy and generosity from all men towards all men. Which is surely right, and not unwanted at present. By and by, however, I think we shall hear from you withal a more distinct recognition how the poor and all men are first, if I may so speak, to show mercy on themselves. Without this preliminary, mercy from others is not possible in general. I desiderate an internal rigour in the heart of your beautiful pity; like the bony inflexible framework in the beautifullest human body;&#x2014;such an internal rigour exists everywhere in Nature, physical, spiritual, moral, and without it no Virtue can stand on its feet in this world.</p>
<p>These are all the observations I will make; I might have stood by mere thanks and unmixed compliments had I regarded you less. My thanks are very cordial, and my good wishes for you always.</p>
<closer><salute>Yours very sincerely,</salute></closer>

<salute>Dearest Geraldine</salute>
<p>I have all this while been like yourself <hi rend="italic">singularly</hi> unwell&#x2014;but alas totally unlike you in my manner of managing the unwellings&#x2014; For I have been as cross as the old one, and quite insensible to the &#x201C;welfare of others&#x201D;&#x2014;except in as far as silent good will could promote it. <hi rend="italic">You</hi> would nevertheless by your generous example have shamed me out of this selfish indulgence of my <hi rend="italic">biliousness</hi> (or whatever one is to call it) had not a greater shame witheld me from writing, the shame of being still unable to give you the smallest tidings of your M.S.&#x2014; Carlyle told me whenever I expressed my impatience about it, that &#x201C;I must give the people time&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;they took a long while to make up their minds <hi rend="italic">in those <pb id="pg-17-307" n="17:307"/>cases&#x201D;</hi>&#x2014;nay &#x201C;they often kept a Manuscript for months merely by way of softening their refusal to have anything to do with it&#x201D; One of the oddest <hi rend="italic">softening</hi> measures that I have happened to hear of! disappointment <hi rend="italic">softened</hi> by suspense!</p>
<p>Yesterday however I found myself at the last farthing of my patience, and having the Sterling carriage by good luck &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">without encumbrance&#x201D;</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A legal phrase meaning a property without a claim on it; here meaning Edward Sterling.</note> I rendered my self at Chapman &#x26; Halls and had a solemn interview with the Chapman-half of the concern&#x2014; The result of which was my Dear&#x2014;that&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;the MS is accepted on the principle of half-profits! The very most Heaven-high success that could befall a young Ladies <hi rend="italic">first</hi> book in &#x201C;the existing state of the book trade&#x201D;! When I think of the difficulty which John Mill&#x2019;s Logic,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">A System of Logic, Ratiocinative and Inductive,</hi> 2 vols. (<date when="1843-00-00">1843</date>). Mill began it, <date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>&#x2013;<date when="1832-00-00">32</date>, and returned to it <date when="1837-00-00">1837</date>. The first draft was finished <date when="1840-00-00">1840</date> (see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18401029-TC-JAC-01"><sic>12:306</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1840-10-29">29 Oct. 1840</date></corr></ref>), rewritten <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>. It was rejected by John Murray, accepted by J. W. Parker, and pbd. <date when="1843-03-00">March 1843</date> with further changes.</note> Carlyle&#x2019;s Sartor, and so many other distinguished books of Distinguished authors had to surmount in merely getting themselves printed without cost&#x2014; I assure you I am mighty pleased with this result of my negociation and hope that you will be the same&#x2014;actually I was so glad in leaving the shop that I rushed into a silk mercers&#x2014;and bought myself a new gown!! a thing which I have been <hi rend="italic">needing</hi> to do for months back, but until this happiness &#x201C;transpired&#x201D; was never <hi rend="italic">up to</hi> doing&#x2014;</p>
<p>&#x201C;They had submitted the MS to a gentleman whom they were in the habit of consulting&#x2014;and <hi rend="italic">the excellence of whose judgement was indubitable</hi>&#x201D; (who is he I wonder?) and &#x201C;he had given a verdict precisely similar to <hi rend="italic">mine</hi>&#x201D; (a good argument in favour of the excellence of <hi rend="italic">my</hi> judgement!) He &#x201C;had no hesitation in saying that it was one of the most remarkable novels that had been produced for some time <hi rend="italic">back&#x2014;after</hi> the 7th Chapter in fact <hi rend="italic">it had taken hold of him with a grasp of iron&#x201D;</hi>&#x2014;up to the 7th Chapter he thought it defective in interest&#x2014;and that the Lady would be wise to <hi rend="italic">recast</hi> that position&#x2014;introducing more of action in place of description&#x2014;the characters should be made <hi rend="italic">to introduce themselves</hi>&#x2014;instead of being elaborately introduced by the Author&#x2014; This I tell you because it is my duty to deliver the message, and also because I agree with it. He (the great nameless) also recommended seeing that you had a very decided contempt for the ordinary rules of spelling&#x2014;and but little reverence for those of grammar<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jewsbury wrote, [<date when="1844-04-19">19 April</date>], that she thought that she would take lessons in writing from &#x201C;a fierce evangelical&#x201D; with &#x201C;a great deal of sense. &#x2026; [S]he can teach me &#x2026; the common rules of writing&#x2014;for, however I may make a joke of the matter, I really know nothing at all about the commonest rules of English syntax, and always thought they came by nature.&#x201D;</note>&#x2014;that <pb id="pg-17-308" n="17:308"/>the MS before going to Press should be revised and corrected by some one in the habit of writing for the Press&#x2014;and&#x2014;it would really be well to have it transcribed on &#x201C;sheets of similar size&#x201D;&#x2014;with <hi rend="italic">margin</hi> and the usual <hi rend="italic">neatnesses</hi>&#x2014;and for Godsake <hi rend="italic">not</hi> strung on red tape but laid side by side in an artist like manner&#x2014;all these things really require to be attended to because whatever increases the difficulty of printing and the quantity of <hi rend="italic">correction</hi> of course increases the expenses and diminishes the fondly anticipated <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;profits&#x201D;!</hi> So I shall send you back the M.S. next week&#x2014;and without mercy impose all that bother on you <hi rend="italic">now</hi>&#x2014;there being a <hi rend="italic">certainty</hi> to comfort you under it&#x2014; You need not be in any hurry with it&#x2014;as they have their hands full at the present moment and shall not be free to begin upon it for two or three months&#x2014;besides the end of the year is judged to be the most favourable time for <hi rend="italic">bringing out</hi> new works<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jewsbury replied, <date when="1844-03-20">20 March</date>: &#x201C;You have been better than good about that MS. Only to think of your streaming off to &#x2018;Chapman &#x26; Hall,&#x2019; ill as you were! &#x2026; I will try what I can do with those horrid seven chapters, but I have not an idea at present to bless either myself or my book. &#x2026; As to the spelling and grammar, I will have it all copied in a clerkly hand.&#x201D; On <date when="1844-06-20">20 June</date> she wrote: &#x201C;I am just at my wits&#x2019; end about that horrid MS.; the seven chapters are far heavier to me than they can be to a reader with the privilege of skipping. I cannot materially alter, but I am cutting short, which will do just as well.&#x201D;</note>&#x2014;</p>
<p>Moreover I ought to mention that Mr Chapman promised if the first book <hi rend="italic">succeeded</hi> as he hoped it would; you should certainly be enabled to accomplish a journey to Norway&#x2014;perhaps to the Moon who knows?&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;on <hi rend="italic">immediate</hi> payment for the next&#x2014; To be sure if you could have had &#x201C;immediate payment&#x201D; for this it would have been more satisfactory than a shadowy prospect of &#x201C;half profits&#x201D;&#x2014;which are a very dawdling sort of <hi rend="italic">profits</hi> now when they do not prove visionary but take the shape of palpable coin&#x2014; An immediate payment however to an <hi rend="italic">untried</hi> author is a thing entirely out of the question&#x2014;every one assures me as well as the Booksellers. Mrs Jameson said &#x201C;nobody could have the immodesty to ask it&#x201D;&#x2014;and so I really do not see that you <hi rend="italic">can</hi> make a better of it&#x2014;than just to conclude the bargain they offer you&#x2014; Chapman &#x26; Hall are the most generous Publishers I have heard of&#x2014;witness their voluntarily presenting Dickens with <hi rend="italic">fifteen hundred pounds</hi> in addition to the two thousand they had bargained to pay him for Nicholas Nickelby!&#x2014; No doubt they <hi rend="italic">found their account</hi> in paying him even at that enormous rate&#x2014;but to <hi rend="italic">give away</hi> so much money even <hi rend="italic">on speculation</hi> argued large and generous ideas&#x2014;for Booksellers! And now Dear I think I have said all that absolutely requires to be said this <pb id="pg-17-309" n="17:309"/>day&#x2014;and whatever heart&#x2014;good will may I have I am without physical force to do more in the writing line&#x2014;just when I was getting to sleep last night after weary tossing and turning about&#x2014;at three in the morning&#x2014;my incautious Husband shoved the stone bottle of warm water off the bed&#x2014;and the thump was in the death watches of the night something to make one almost swoon with terror&#x2014; My sleep was quite murdered thereby&#x2014;and I am today more dead than alive&#x2014; I wish to heaven we were better both of us&#x2014;it is weary weary work this same! I have not even been able to go to Mrs Fraser for a fortnight&#x2014; How true is that which you say&#x2014;that these newspaper exposures have taken all the shine out of criminal passions!</p>
<p>Thanks for the queer wee book! it is a treasure&#x2014; Thanks for your long letters&#x2014; Thanks for your constant love <closer><salute>Yours ever</salute></closer> <name>J.C.</name></p>

<p>Darling I write just a line today to prevent you fancying that I have lost either my life or my senses&#x2014; <hi rend="italic">You</hi> are not one of those unimaginative characters who cannot believe in <hi rend="italic">inability to write</hi> unless it be attended with the outward visible sign of <hi rend="italic">confinement to bed</hi>&#x2014; And so I need not fear your turning away your sweet face from me with an incredulous and unsympathizing smile, when I declare that my silence has really been the result of inability, tho I have been all the last week on my legs&#x2014;yesterday however I sat down to write to you at last a long letter&#x2014;when behold the Sterling carriage drove to the door&#x2014;&#x201C;<hi rend="italic">without</hi> encumbrance&#x201D; putting itself at my orders for the forenoon&#x2014;and as I very much needed to go to the Strand to enquire the result of Chapman &#x26; Halls cogitations as to Geraldines Manuscript which has been laid on <hi rend="italic">my</hi> arms and left there (!) very much as the baby which the Gentleman in the Omnibus incautiously undertook the holding of, while the Mother stept out&#x2014;I judged this an opportunity of getting that business transacted <hi rend="italic">without fatigue</hi> which in my present feeble condition I ought not to neglect&#x2014; You know that with all my laziness when there is <hi rend="italic">real business</hi> to be done, I make it a point of honour never to let it linger or miscarry for want of exertion&#x2014; Geraldine was extremely helpful to me about my <hi rend="italic">Mudies</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jewsbury wrote, [<date when="1844-04-19">19 April</date>], that she was &#x201C;suffering from Mudieism, but it is the result of successful labours.&#x201D; She had found a place for one of them, probably Elizabeth (dismissed <date when="1843-12-00">Dec. 1843</date>), with a mother and da. who would &#x201C;bear with her shortcomings at first. &#x2026; [S]he will have to dress these two ladies, and do the plain sewing. &#x2026; [M]y own milliner has promised to give her a few lessons in quilling and trimming, and cap-making.

<p>Well this morning as in duty bound I have had to write her the good news and now I am too wearied after all the &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">explaining and expounding</hi>&#x201D; of my letter to <hi rend="italic">her</hi> to write another letter of any magnitude even to my Babbie&#x2014; Last night my incautious husband shoved <hi rend="italic">his</hi> stone bottle of warm water over the bed&#x2014;and the thump which it made on the floor just over my head in the dead watches of the night just when after weary hours of tossing about I was falling into sleep of course put all ideas of sleeping far from me&#x2014;and I have risen after a horrid night in a condition more dead than alive&#x2014;curious coincidence of <hi rend="italic">bottles!</hi>&#x2014;there has also been a curious coincidence of <hi rend="italic">rings</hi>.

<salute>Dear Milnes,</salute>
<p>There came last night, presumably from Moxon, a second copy of the <hi rend="italic">Palm Leaves;</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >(<date when="1844-00-00">1844</date>); poems written during and about a tour of the Middle and Near East, <date when="1842-00-00">1842</date>&#x2013;<date when="1843-00-00">43</date>, pbd. by Edward Moxon.</note> which also, by a kind of <foreign><hi rend="italic">droit d&#x2019;aubaine</hi></foreign>,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The right to confiscate the property of a deceased alien.</note> may I not crave your leave to keep, having already in view a good use for it. I hope moreover you have sent a Copy to Emerson; whom, intrinsically and extrinsically, it will much gratify. The way to him is by one Green (or the Successor of Green) a Bookseller in Newgate Street.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Chapman, previously John Green, 121 Newgate St.</note></p>
<p>One of my copies I read thro&#x2019;, after tea; which feat, of itself, either after or before tea, is a very surprising one for any kind of Poetry with me, in these days! Truly I feel called upon to say that I like this volume better than any of your others, and indeed <hi rend="italic">well;</hi> that I find a real voice of Song in it; breathings of genuine &#x201C;mild wisdom&#x201D; uttered musically, under the Palm Trees of the East, by a Western man. You recognise my friend Mahomet;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <hi rend="italic">Heroes</hi>, lecture 2. In the prefatory note to <hi rend="italic">Palm Leaves</hi>, Milnes set forth his unconventional admiration for the Moslem world, which is reflected in almost every poem.</note> and say and sing things credible and heart-affecting concerning him. Thanks for such a Book; in my own name and that of all.</p>
<p>And now recognising Mahomet, good Heavens why do we not set about emulating him! Life with us is not a Dilettantism any more than <pb id="pg-17-312" n="17:312"/>it was with him; we are born servants, bound to be ready with blood and life, to what he called &#x201C;Allah&#x201D;; we too, every soul of us!&#x2014; One of the things I like in this Book is the visible increase of earnestness: may it go on increasing,&#x2014;<foreign><hi rend="italic">der heitre Ernst</hi></foreign> [the serene earnestness].</p>
<p>On the whole, <hi rend="italic">if</hi> Young England<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A short-lived English political party started by Disraeli and Lord John Manners to unite the crown, the aristocracy, and the masses against middle-class capitalism.</note> would altogether fling its shovel-hat into the lumber-room, much more cast its purple stockings<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Shovel hats and purple stockings being symbols of the clergy and aristocracy, outworn vestures.</note> to the nettles; and honestly recognising what was dead, and leaving the dead to bury that, address itself frankly to the magnificent but as yet chaotic and appalling Future, in the <hi rend="italic">spirit</hi> of the Past and Present; telling men at every turn that it knew and saw forever clearly the <hi rend="italic">body</hi> of the Past to be dead (and even to be damnable if it pretended still to be alive, and go about in a galvanic State),&#x2014;what achievements might not Young England perhaps manage for us! Whatsoever was noble and manful among us, in terrible want of a rallying-point at present, might rally there, and march.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Milnes was critical of Young England and Disraeli in his &#x201C;A Few Remarks on Coningsby by Real England,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Hood&#x2019;s Magazine</hi> <date when="1844-06-01">1 (June 1844)</date>:600&#x2013;6: &#x201C;D&#x2019;Israeli &#x2026; would have a Hero-King &#x2026; a Heroic Nobility &#x2026; and a People Heroic. &#x2026; We must prefer the dull Guidance of middle-age mediocrity &#x2026; to &#x2018;Young England,&#x2019; with all its genius and energy &#x2026; . One Heroism and one only, we still recognize &#x2026; and we must get on as well as we can with this, even at the risk of having no other cry than that proposed by Carlyle, as a motto to De Tocqueville&#x2019;s book&#x2014;&#x2018;<foreign>Vive la platitude!</foreign>&#x2019;&#x201D;</note> But alas, alas!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Well; I wish you every felicity; and pray that the end of idol-worship (wood idols and logic idols) may be swift;&#x2014;and with thanks for such graceful melodiously whispering <hi rend="italic">Palm Leaves</hi>, and many other things,</p>

<p>The Lady Authoress of the <hi rend="italic">Life of Jean Paul</hi> wrote to me a good many months ago that, in case her Work were to be reprinted here, she had various corrections and improvements which she was anxious to introduce. This it seems to me is one reason why a Publisher of your character should first consult with her on the subject. But a second still more fundamental and preliminary reason is this, that the <hi rend="italic">Life of Jean Paul</hi> now on sale here is her property, actually hers, and to be respected <pb id="pg-17-314" n="17:314"/>as such by all respectable men, even tho&#x2019; there be no court able with penalties and acts of parliament to protect it.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In his pref., <date when="1845-03-21">21 March 1845</date>, Chapman said that republication was by arrangement with Mrs. Lee, &#x201C;who had a pecuniary interest in his success.&#x201D; The corrections were made by William Howitt to save time. Like TC, Chapman referred to the possibility of unauthorized edns. and the importance of American authors&#x2019; &#x201C;rightful claim &#x2026; regardless of the accident of law&#x201D; to financial recompense.</note></p>

<p>I have to thank you very kindly for your little volume on <hi rend="italic">Human Nature;</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Human Nature: a Philosophical Exposition of the Divine Institution of Reward and Publishment</hi> (<date when="1844-00-00">1844</date>); see headnote to <ref target="volume-17/lt-18440320-TC-JCHOJG-01"><sic>preceding letter</sic><corr>TC to JCHOJG, <date when="1844-03-20">20 March 1844</date></corr></ref>.</note> in which I trace with satisfaction the features of an earnest and piously meditative mind. My acknowledgements should have been earlier returned, but that many engagements have, as is too often the case, occupied all my hours.</p>
<p>What can be done for the <hi rend="italic">Dial</hi> I do not well see. If it do perish, we may take this as a consolation, that Emerson has not thereby perished, nay perhaps is freer than ever thereby,&#x2014;and that except him there was not often much in the <hi rend="italic">Dial</hi> that seemed fated to a long life.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The last issue of <hi rend="italic">The Dial</hi> was pbd. in <date when="1844-04-00">April</date>, when Chapman&#x2019;s name replaced Green&#x2019;s on the cover as British agent.</note></p>
<p><pb id="pg-17-315" n="17:315"/>German Literature too has been much a stranger to me for the last dozen years; and indeed, until it shew quite new phases, I think must continue so. With the ancient school, all gone now except Tieck, German Literature seems to have ended,&#x2014;to have sunk down as low as other Literatures, and to mean henceforth almost nothing. Considerable good might probably be done by forwarding right (instead of wrong) Translations, or at least Extracts, Biographies &#x26;c of the chief men that did make for Germany a Literature properly so called: but of this also, I suppose, in the actual state of Authorship and Bookselling there is as good as no chance; this also, like so many other equally and more important things, must for the present go its blind course, whither it can.</p>
<p>Wishing you good insight and faithful purpose in such a confused element (which two are indeed but one wish, in all manner of &#x2018;elements&#x2019; and circumstances), and promising you real success in some proportion thereto,</p>

<salute>Gentlemen,</salute>
<p>I beg to answer by apprising you that the Copyright of the <hi rend="italic">Life of Schiller</hi> is already and has always been mine; that Messrs Taylor and Hessey never had, or to my knowledge claimed, any right over the Work, except that of publishing this one revised and enlarged edition, after it had done its service in their Magazine.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Schiller&#x2019;s Life and Writings,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">London Magazine</hi> 8 (<date when="1823-00-00">1823</date>):381&#x2013;400; 9 (<date when="1824-00-00">1824</date>):37&#x2013;59; 10 (<date when="1824-00-00">1824</date>):16&#x2013;25, 149&#x2013;63, 259&#x2013;69.</note></p>
<p>At such a distance of time, the documents connected with the bargain are not perhaps on your side, any more than on mine, accessible in a moment: but such has all along been my distinct understanding and complete conviction on the subject; and it is on this principle, of selling one edition, and rigorously retaining the copyright, that I have disposed of all my subsequent writings as well.</p>
<p>I shall accordingly altogether object to the scheme of republishing the <hi rend="italic">Life of Schiller</hi> as indeed I should to any scheme of reprinting the <pb id="pg-17-316" n="17:316"/>work without fit corrections, or with my name upon it perhaps even then.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The next British edn. was pbd. by Chapman &#x26; Hall, <date when="1845-00-00">1845</date>.</note></p>

<salute>Dear Fitzgerald,</salute>
<p>Thanks for the Plan of Winceby; which is really something, and will suffice me for that, if I even get no more!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On <date when="1844-03-20">20 March</date> FitzGerald sent a map of Winceby, a hamlet 5 mi. W of Horncastle, site of a battle, <date when="1643-10-11">11 Oct. 1643</date>; see <hi rend="italic">Cromwell, Works</hi> 6:174&#x2013;77. He said that the map &#x201C;comes from the hand of one of the Allenbys [to whom Elizabeth Charlesworth had written], who once farmed all Winsby Field: and have relics, etcc. These you shall hear of in time. You will see perhaps the uncertainties, etc., which always attend these descriptions: could the <hi rend="italic">field of battle</hi> have been on rising ground? Or was this the hill you wrote about which Cromwell <hi rend="italic">did</hi> take? Dr. Cookson has got all my memory [i.e., notes]. Slash Lane promises well. Another note from another of the family describes the hill as &#x2018;high. &#x2026; Slash Lane and <hi rend="italic">a few adjoining fields quite level</hi>.&#x2019; If Slash Lane lies as in the map, it must be level in one part, and run up the hill in another. Both accounts agree that in Slash Lane bones, etc., have been found: was it not in such a place the two armies dogged each other all night?&#x201D; (Terhune, <hi rend="italic">LEF</hi> 1:429).</note>
I have no doubt whatever that &#x2018;Slash Field&#x2019; is the actual place: the silence of our Pamphlets as to the &#x2018;rising ground&#x2019; is nothing, so careless are they; and the fact itself is all right, for Dalgetty (Sir John Henderson,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dugald Dalgetty of Scott&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">The Legend of Montrose</hi> (<date when="1819-00-00">1819</date>), more probably based on Sir James Turner (<date when="1615-00-00">1615</date>&#x2013;<date when="1686-00-00">86</date>?), royalist soldier and author. Sir John Henderson was royalist gov. of Newark.</note> who was a very cunning fellow) would naturally take the best ground he could possibly get, the night before. This &#x2018;rotten ground&#x2019; therefore is a <hi rend="italic">second</hi> hill that Oliver had to force (not without knocks); his first hill, as your memory now gone to Dr. Cookson mentions, was at Gainsborough. &#x2018;Slash Lane&#x2019; is clearly the line of Dalgetty&#x2019;s flight, where a great many were killed (above 100 I think), and multitudes taken sticking in the quagmires.</p>
<p>The &#x2018;bones, skeletons, and spurs&#x2019; imbedded in the marle will do <pb id="pg-17-317" n="17:317"/>extremely well; only I know not what to make of the &#x2018;earthen jars,&#x2019;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC seems to be quoting from a letter by one of the Allenbys to Elizabeth Charlesworth. FitzGerald wrote to her mother, ca. <date when="1844-03-10">10 March</date>, that one of the Allenbys &#x201C;says that bones, spurs, and <hi rend="italic">urns</hi> have been found there: the latter look rather as if the hill were of<hi rend="italic">Roman note</hi>. I should like it to be clearly told, <hi rend="italic">exactly where</hi> the relics were dug up: whether on the hill or on the level said to extend from the hill to the west. Mrs. Allenby&#x2019;s first letter says <hi rend="italic">that</hi> was probably the field of battle: her son says the hill itself was. Also, <hi rend="italic">exactly what the relics were</hi>. These two points are the chief I can see to need thorough sifting. I sent Carlyle the letter&#x201D; (Terhune, <hi rend="italic">LEF</hi> 1:428).</note>&#x2014;these Cromwell of a surety did not bring to that locality! Neither does the place seem to be Roman. But it may be Norse-Pagan; <hi rend="italic">Wonsby</hi>, Wodan&#x2019;s Town,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Etymology questionable.</note> and an old place of sacrifice. What kind of thing are or were the jars?</p>
<p>You will therefore congratulate Miss Charleston; who really is a famous girl,&#x2014;and ought to be courted, I should say, by any man at liberty for such enterprises.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >FitzGerald said, <date when="1844-03-20">20 March</date>: &#x201C;She who has processed all this for you is a very famous girl (now 30) with whom I used to be slightly in love as I supposed. &#x2026; I really think you will have to begin to write to Miss C. herself: for, I being unmarried, all her information has to come through <hi rend="italic">her Mother</hi>. Or would you have us marry at once, to explore Winsby Field conveniently?&#x201D; (Terhune, <hi rend="italic">LEF</hi> 1:429).</note> If any of her slaves could by and by go to the Top of Bolingbroke Hill (where the Soldier Saints started),<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Cromwell, Works</hi> 6:175.</note> and tell us what kind of outlook there is there, what church-steeples, woods, black or drab-coloured streamlets one sees, and whether by probability the Country was fenced in those days towards Winceby, and if so what roads there were,&#x2014;we should have the whole matter before us, and make a handsome end of Winceby.&#x2014;If Gainsborough and Grantham turn out as well, it will be worth while to have written.</p>
<p>You will give us your answer to this by word of mouth?<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >FitzGerald wrote, <date when="1844-03-20">20 March</date>: &#x201C;I have not sent you all these letters for fear of too much: I shall be in town next week, and then you shall see&#x201D; (Terhune, <hi rend="italic">LEF</hi> 1:429).</note>&#x2014;I am still in Cimmerian darkness<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410516-TC-KAVE-01"><sic>13:135</sic><corr>TC to KAVE, <date when="1841-05-16">16 May 1841</date></corr></ref>.</note> as to my ulterior Cromwellean operations; but I hold on, and occasionally there is a glimmer as if night would by and by grow twilight or dawn,&#x2014;in which at least cat&#x2019;s eyes, sharpened by desire, might see something.</p>
<p>We have not seen Thackeray yet, but hear he is in Town.<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thackeray had returned from Paris to his rooms at 27 Jermyn St., ca. <date when="1844-03-07">7 March</date>; see <hi rend="italic">Letters of Thackeray</hi>, ed. G. N. Ray 2:164.</note></p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Thanks for your Newspapers and news. I was afraid you had abandoned your project of the History of Wages,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Apparently never completed by Ballantyne.</note> in which I suppose some labour is already invested. It is always good for a man to have some <hi rend="italic">main current</hi> running thro&#x2019; his field of speculation; it wholesomely drains off so many things; and yields some good issue, far better than one expected, at last.</p>
<p>I am so far from having <hi rend="italic">done</hi> with Oliver Cromwell, it is yet odds with me whether I have got him fairly begun! No business ever fell to my hand a hundredth-part so difficult. It is like the summing up of the general stupidity of England for two centuries past, this state in which I find the Hero Oliver. All books ever written upon him are torpedo monsters, and belong to the realm of Nox and Erebus: how to write one <hi rend="italic">now</hi> that shall belong to the other realm is not easy!</p>
<p>This Book of the Chatham Society<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Chetham Society, founded Manchester, <date when="1843-00-00">1843</date>, for the publication of documents about the history and lit. of Lancashire and Cheshire. TC refers to its second publication, <hi rend="italic">Tracts relating to Military Proceedings in Lancashire during the Great Civil War,</hi> ed. Goerge Ormerod (Manchester, <date when="1844-00-00">1844</date>).</note> is what causes me to write today. If it be such a volume as I hope, it may save me many a headache in the British Museum. Lancashire, Ashton, Stanley, Brereton &#x26;c &#x26;c especially Latham House and Chester, the Siege of Manchester &#x26; massacre of Bolton:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Col. Edward Ashton fought bravely at the Battle of Preston, <date when="1648-08-17">17 Aug. 1648</date>. James Stanley (<date when="1607-00-00">1607</date>&#x2013;<date when="1651-00-00">51</date>), 7th earl of Derby, mustered 60,000 Lancashire and Cheshire royalists and tried to recover Manchester, <date when="1642-00-00">1642</date>; was twice defeated nr. Warrington; took Preston, <date when="1643-00-00">1643</date>; was defeated at Whalley, <date when="1643-00-00">1643</date>; led assault at Bolton, <date when="1644-00-00">1644</date>; withdrew to Isle of Man for six years; landed in Lancashire, <date when="1651-00-00">1651</date>; routed at Wigan; captured by parliamentary forces and executed. Sir William Brereton (<date when="1604-00-00">1604</date>&#x2013;<date when="1661-00-00">61</date>), commander-in-chief of parliamentary forces in Cheshire and neighboring southern counties.
Lathom House, seat of the earls of Derby in Lancashire, was defended by Charlotte, countess of Derby (<date when="1599-00-00">1599</date>&#x2013;<date when="1664-00-00">1664</date>), against parliamentarians, <date when="1844-02-00">Feb.</date> to <date when="1644-05-00">May, 1644</date>. Chester was a royalist stronghold besieged by Brereton, <date when="1644-00-00">1644</date>. Manchester was besieged, <date when="1642-00-00">1642</date>, by royalists under James Stanley, Lord Strange (who succeeded to the earldom of Derby later in <date when="1642-00-00">1642</date>), but was successfully defended. Bolton, or Bolton Le Moors, a borough in Lancashire, held by the parliamentarians, was taken by storm, <date when="1644-00-00">1644</date>, by royalists under Prince Rupert and Lord Derby.</note> these are things I do not wish to omit;&#x2014;and they lie among the Museum &#x2018;Pamphlets on the Civil Wars,&#x2019; some forty thousand or so in number!</p>
<p><pb id="pg-17-319" n="17:319"/>Can you send me a correct <hi rend="italic">table of contents</hi> of this Chatham Volume; then the price of it if it is to be sold,&#x2014;or the way to borrow it, beg it, or do all but steal it, if it prove suitable and <hi rend="italic">not</hi> saleable!&#x2014;</p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>It was not till this morning that I received my Book, after all. I called yesterday at Blackwood&#x2019;s shop;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >22 Pall Mall. <hi rend="italic">The Poems and Ballads of Schiller,</hi> trans. Sir Edward Bulwer Lytton, 2 vols. (<date when="1844-00-00">1844</date>), pbd. <date when="1844-03-23">23 March</date>. The &#x201C;Advertisement&#x201D; refers to the life by the &#x201C;eminent&#x201D; TC (iv).</note> the shopman was arraigned, the sub-shopman, and finally the porter, with the <foreign><hi rend="italic">corpus delicti</hi></foreign> before him, the parcel namely all wrapped and rightly addressed above a week ago: he, scratching his rough head, could only allege &#x201C;that&#x2014;that&#x2014;he was not <hi rend="italic">sure</hi> of finding my house there.&#x201D; He should have tried! The Footguards at Waterloo, getting order to fire, were not sure that the triggers would act, but they made the experiment.</p>
<p>In fine, I return you many thanks for my good Book; and mean to enjoy myself upon it this very evening.</p>
<p>The thing I said about humour and Schiller needs many modifications, explanations, and lies open to canvassing on every side.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC may allude to an oral or written remark. In his <hi rend="italic">Life of Schiller, Works</hi> 25:193, he comments only briefly on Schiller&#x2019;s humor.</note> I believe it first of all came to me from Jean Paul;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Richter.</note> who, for his own benefit, has said many things about Humour,&#x2014;with depth enough, but often not with precision enough. Laughter and tears (if they are <hi rend="italic">true</hi>, but often enough they are both <hi rend="italic">false</hi>) seem to me to lie very near together in all men; and for avoiding Fanaticism, Rousseauship &#x26;c &#x26;c I would have them go on <foreign><hi rend="italic">pari passu</hi></foreign> [on equal terms], if they could.</p>
<p>You will do me a real pleasure and kindness if you call here any day, and talk with me a while. I am at home generally till three; accessible to anybody between two and three, and to you at all hours. A mouthful of rational human speech is certainly the very elixir of life to a human soul;&#x2014;and, alas, it seems to be a very rare possibility for mankind in these epochs!</p>

<salute>Dear Mr. Graham,</salute>
<p>Here is Clow&#x2019;s letter back again; thanks to you for it, and for your own kind and truthful utterance to me. I am kept in the extremity of haste in this horrid treadmill of a place, and must reply by half a line. Clow&#x2019;s conduct to your good Brother<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Peter Graham in New York (d. <date when="1849-00-00">1849</date>), said by TC in <date when="1849-00-00">1849</date> to have been &#x201C;long in a suffering state&#x201D; (Marrs 674), see <ref target="volume-01/lt-18200915-TC-WG-01"><sic>1:274</sic><corr>TC to WG, <date when="1820-09-15">15 Sept. 1820</date></corr></ref>.</note> his benefactor, was not good, at least not at all good-<hi rend="italic">looking:</hi> nevertheless I would not have you resent it; the habits of Annandale farmers as to <hi rend="italic">writing</hi> are at all times inconceivably sluggish; they have a horror of the pen, which is often a very untrue index of their feelings: on the whole I suppose Clow&#x2019;s own account of the business is the correct one; a matter to be sorry for, not to be angry at. Write to him when you are in the vein, in spite of all!</p>
<p>Your accounts of yourself and of interests very dear to you in America and elsewhere are far from satisfactory to me! Your poor Brother, after his toilsome pilgrimage, seems sinking amid painful obstructions,&#x2014;like a spent steed, life arrives <hi rend="italic">painfully</hi> at the goal. What can we say? You have this one comfort if his sickness be to death, that he <hi rend="italic">has lived,</hi>&#x2014;that he has been a real man, not an empty dishonest phantasm; and that he goes to his Maker, who has done and will do all things <hi rend="italic">well</hi>. Never lament for the embarrassed young people; to young strong persons embarrassment is but school-exercise; poverty is often the greatest <hi rend="italic">blessing</hi>, actually such, tho&#x2019; we poor slaves generally feel sure that it is the one curse&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">slaves</hi> as we are!</p>
<p>As for yourself, my dear friend, I really must enter my protest against this melancholy looking back and bodeful looking forward; I decidedly bid you give it over! Whatsoever thy hand to <hi rend="italic">do</hi>, Do that with all thy might.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Eccles. 9:10.</note>&#x2014;and leave the issues calmly to God. It is man&#x2019;s sole wisdom, and was, and will be. Do not dig into the depths of the grave; they are wisely hidden from us, we know them not. You call yourself very healthy; but I call all this the extremity of ill health, unhealthiness of the mind;&#x2014;drag yourself away from it!&#x2014; <closer><salute>God bless you always!</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Sir,</salute>
<p>I am truly shocked to receive, this moment, a Letter of yours dated three weeks ago: on the <date when="1844-03-06">6<hi rend="italic">th</hi> of March</date> you, in the most courteous manner invite me to a duty highly honourable to me; and now, the day <hi rend="italic">after</hi> it should have taken effect, I for the first time hear of the message! The Parcel was sent to my Booksellers; many Parcels come to them, rarely Parcels of much moment, and hardly ever of any pressing haste; the rule is therefore, as I live four miles off, that only Letters are forwarded direct, and the Parcels come in a lump, at the end of the month, with new Magazines.</p>
<p>It is too late now to say that I should have felt myself honoured by your invitation, that I should have regretted much not to accept it;&#x2014;or to say anything except that I am heartily sorry; that nobody can wish better to your praiseworthy Institution<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> than I do; and that I hope the Committee never imputed my silence to any other cause than some such accident as it now turns out to have in fact proceeded from.</p>
<p>Allow me to congratulate my estimable friend Mr Cameron<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> on the success of his and your labours; and to bid you all, with many go<supplied>[od]</supplied> wishes, go on unweariedly in your honourable and humane exertions.</p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Before going out today I will write you a little word, in answer to your most welcome good Letter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >She wrote, <date when="1844-03-15">15 March</date>: &#x201C;I received &#x2026; your pictuer quite safe I embressed it but it could say nothing.&#x201D;</note> which I received at the due time. You are very good to take such trouble writing to us; we like right well to see your hand on a bit of paper, conveying your heart&#x2019;s wishes to us!&#x2014; Do not give up the use of the pen!</p>
<p>Two days ago there went away a bundle of Books for you by Edinburgh and Dumfries. They will be in Dumfries perhaps in about ten days hence. Most part of them were for you; Jean was to pick out what belonged to herself, and send the others on to Scotsbrig without delay. They are books, two or three of them, that will please and entertain you; sent by John these: the rest are a heap of old Magazines &#x26;c, of little value; but I remembered what you once said, &#x201C;Many a one wants to read, and has <hi rend="italic">no</hi> Book at all!&#x201D; You can give these away to parties of that kind; they are only lumbering the shelves here.</p>
<p>I hope your sad rough weather is done in the north; it must have been very trying for you, for Isabella and other weakly ones. We have got sunshine now in our latitudes here, and the lilacs and garden-trees are even beginning to send out leaves. The Spring is an unhealthy season for us all,&#x2014;but there lies always a summer behind it! Jane, I think, is better than when you heard last; she does not <hi rend="italic">profess</hi> to be sick at all, but she sleeps badly, eats badly, and is weaker than her usual, which is not very strong. I impute it all to the Spring season: there has been a great unhealthiness here for many months past.</p>
<p>All the people are in controversy about Lord Ashley&#x2019;s proposal to restrict the hours of Factory labour to Twelve with <hi rend="italic">two</hi> allowed for meals, that is Ten hours in all. Numbers of people are loud and bitter against it; as for me I rejoice greatly that the Government has in <hi rend="italic">any</hi> way begun to deal with that horrible business, the state of the work-people; immeasurable tasks lie there for all manner of wise Governors <pb id="pg-17-325" n="17:325"/>and Parliamenteers and Prime Ministers! Lord Ashley&#x2019;s Bill was carried once; but Peel and Graham have turned again upon him, saying they will go out if he carry it, so that probably it will be lost this time.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lord Ashley had carried the factory act (<date when="1833-00-00">1833</date>) that had improved working conditions in mines and factories, and was trying to obtain other improvements. As a result of a report of a commission apptd. largely at his instigation, the govt. introduced a new factory bill, <date when="1844-02-06">6 Feb. 1844</date>. Ashley proposed an amendment, <date when="1844-03-15">15 March</date>, to limit the working hours of women and young people to 6 <hi rend="small-caps">a.m.</hi> to 6 <hi rend="small-caps">p.m.</hi> with two hours allowed for meals. The govt. insisted on a limitation of twelve hours. Ashley&#x2019;s amendment passed with a small majority, <date when="1844-03-18">18 March</date>, but on <date when="1844-03-22">22 March</date> both the ten-hour and twelve-hour limit were rejected; the bill was discharged, <date when="1844-03-29">29 March</date>, and reintroduced in <date when="1844-04-00">April</date> including the sections already passed, such as the reduction of child labor from eight to six and a half hours. Ashley&#x2019;s ten-hour amendment was defeated, <date when="1844-05-13">13 May</date>, and the new bill passed. A ten-hour bill was not passed till <date when="1847-00-00">1847</date>.</note> But the business is <hi rend="italic">begun;</hi> that is the great fact. The other day I saw one of the Official people, Lord Elliot,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edward Granville Eliot (<date when="1798-00-00">1798</date>&#x2013;<date when="1877-00-00">1877</date>; <ref target="volume-17/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/8628"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref> see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400526-TC-RMM-01"><sic>12:154</sic><corr>TC to RMM, <date when="1840-05-26">26 May 1840</date></corr></ref>), sec. for Ireland, <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>&#x2013;<date when="1845-00-00">45</date>.</note> in a company who were all talking about this; I told him the Government were absolutely bound either to try whether they could do some good to the people, or to draw them out in line and openly shoot them with grape&#x2014;that would be a mercy in comparison! He seemed much astonished: but I had a fair share of the company on my side.</p>
<p>My Book is very, very <hi rend="italic">slow;</hi>&#x2014;but I think it will go on at last: I must be patient, and toil away at it. The job I fear is a bad one; but it must be done, that is the short and the long.</p>
<p>We had a <foreign><hi rend="italic">gliff</hi></foreign> [glimpse] of Jack last night, and hope to see him again tomorrow night, perhaps today.</p>
<p>Dear Mother you must just be content with this <hi rend="italic">dud</hi> of a letter today I hope to send more before long <closer><salute>My blessings with you always, dear Mother!</salute></closer></p>

<ps><p>In the Book-parcel too is a <hi rend="italic">Machine</hi> of the best sort, if you can find it useful in any way.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not explained; presumably belonging to JWC&#x2019;s mother; mentioned in <ref target="volume-17/lt-18440311-TC-JCA-01">TC to JCA, <date when="1844-03-11">11 March</date></ref>.</note> Jane sends it with many welcomes,&#x2014;but, as it belonged to those she will not see again, no doubt you will not &#x201C;fling it away,&#x201D; she says!</p></ps>
