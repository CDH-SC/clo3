<p>The editors again express their particular gratitude to the British Academy, which has made the Carlyle Letters a British Academy Research Project, and to the members of its Committee on Academy Research Projects and its assistant secretary, Kenneth Emond. We are also grateful to the National Endowment for the Humanities, which generously awarded the project a three-year collaborative research grant. This grant has funded the planning and construction of a Web edition of the Carlyle Letters which will be launched in <date when="2003-00-00">2003</date>. We are extremely grateful for the ongoing advice of Paolo Mangiafico of Information Technology Services at Perkins Library, Duke University; and, we extend our thanks for early critiques to David Chesnutt of the Model Editions Partnership at the University of South Carolina and to Natalia Smith of the DocSouth project at the University of North Carolina. Brent E. Kinser, who joined the Duke Carlyle Office in <date when="2001-04-00">April 2001</date>, now serves as coordinator of the eCarlyle project in addition to his editorial service to the print edition. His eCarlyle team includes style-sheet designer Rod Franco and copyeditors Phil Kowalski, Robert Martinez, and Ian Oakes. DNC Data Systems of New Bombay, India, has electronically encoded the existing volumes of the Carlyle Letters.</p>

<p>In this volume there are fewer letters than usual because of the addition of important new documents. It includes 121 letters, only 9 of which are by Jane Welsh Carlyle. Of Thomas&#x2019;s letters, 80 have not been published before (or about 65 percent), and of Jane&#x2019;s, just 2. Yet the apparent decline in Jane&#x2019;s importance, so far as letters go, is more than compensated for by the discovery of other documents by and about her given at the end of this volume. These include her Notebook, <date when="1845-00-00">1845</date>&#x2013;<date when="1852-00-00">52</date>, now given in full and not seen since J. A. Froude included passages from it in the <hi rend="italic">Letters and Memorials.</hi> There is the full version of &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">The simple Story</hi> of my own first Love&#x201D; (referred to below as <hi rend="italic">Simple Story</hi>) written in <date when="1852-00-00">1852</date> and first published in a complete form in connection with the conference at Edinburgh (<date when="2001-00-00">2001</date>) celebrating the bicentenary of her birth. Most important, we include the Journal that she wrote between <date when="1855-10-00">October 1855</date> and <date when="1856-07-00">July 1856</date>, which is followed by Geraldine Jewsbury&#x2019;s letter to Froude about it, of <date when="1876-11-22">22 November 1876</date>. The versions of the Journal previously given by Froude and Alexander Carlyle were far from complete, and the passages they left out were often the most tantalizing and revealing. They are accompanied by a long account Jane entrusted or dictated to her great friend Ellen Twisleton, the manuscript of which was discovered by Professor Kenneth Fielding at the Houghton Library of Harvard University. Taken together, they bring us closer to Jane Welsh Carlyle: her own account of her uncertainties about herself, the details of her life, and the distress she felt in her marriage, especially at this time. The Journal has always figured in previous editions of her letters and is essentially interwoven with the long and unhappy drama of her marriage. The Journal and the letters cannot be fully understood without reference to each other, and they are now brought together in full for the first time.</p>
<p>It has been thought better to give all these papers together, even though the necessary shape and size of the volume mean that only with the next volume can we parallel all the letters with the Journal, which was continued till <date when="1856-07-00">July 1856</date>. It is notable, even so, that in this period (<date when="1855-07-00">July</date>&#x2013;<date when="1855-12-00">Dec. 1855</date>), and especially from the moment she began the Journal, she wrote fewer and fewer letters. As she remarked in the Journal, &#x201C;I write no <hi rend="italic">notes,</hi> neither <hi rend="italic">little</hi> nor long&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-30/ed-30-jane-welsh-carlyle-journal">JWC&#x2019;s Journal, <date when="1855-11-17">17 Nov. 1855</date></ref>).</p>
<p>The purpose of this edition is mainly to be faithful rather than interpretative; yet the text often needs a reliable explanation, which includes asking why the various documents were written and what we make of them. Thomas <pb id="pg-30-xii" n="30:xii"/>jotted on the front cover of the Notebook, <date when="1845-00-00">1845</date>&#x2013;<date when="1852-00-00">52</date>: &#x201C;Anecdotes (<hi rend="italic">Autobiogr</hi> l for most part).&#x201D; Thomas is right that the Notebook is purely anecdotal: it is a set of stories, mainly in the form of stray tales about others, which also tell us about herself. An explanation for the writing of <hi rend="italic">Simple Story</hi> is given later (<ref target="volume-30/ed-30-simple-story-of-my-own-first-love"><sic>p. 175</sic><corr>JWC&#x2019;s "A Simple Story of My Own First Love"</corr></ref>). The main Journal, <date when="1855-00-00">1855</date>&#x2013;<date when="1856-00-00">56</date>, has always compelled us to consider their two lives in the light of her extreme despair. Then we have to consider how the Journal has been used, and probably misused. Ellen Twisleton&#x2019;s account of their early life at Craigenputtoch, which seems to have been practically dictated by Jane, raises the question of how far her memories were colored by her later life. All these accounts are given only from Jane&#x2019;s viewpoint, and some allowance has to be made for the extent to which they agree with Jane and Thomas&#x2019;s letters, and with his point of view about controversial incidents in their marriage, which he rarely mentions except in his <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences.</hi></p>
<p>Looking at the Notebook, <date when="1845-00-00">1845</date>&#x2013;<date when="1852-00-00">52</date>, it seems that it may have been an earlier response to advice to get outside the &#x201C;mistification of <hi rend="italic">oneself</hi>&#x201D; and &#x201C;writing of it in a paper-book&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-30/ed-30-jane-welsh-carlyle-journal">JWC&#x2019;s Journal, <date when="1855-00-00">1855</date>&#x2013;<date when="1856-00-00">56</date>, <date when="1855-10-21">21 Oct. 1855</date></ref>). The first two tales, written with spirit, are among those that Froude rightly selected for use in the <hi rend="italic">Letters and Memorials.</hi> He chose a third, about a lost child, taken home by Jane, to be confronted by &#x201C;a young lady&#x201D; who has been seduced, forgetful &#x201C;that the world contained anything else but love.&#x201D; Her choice of subjects ranges from the despairingly alcoholic Dr. Wood immured in the Seven Dials, who has &#x201C;tried what beating his Wife could do for him,&#x201D; to the &#x201C;sick Thief&#x201D; who needs the consolation of prayer, tenderly nursed by a prostitute and with fellow thieves caring for him. Others include the sick and solitary Polish exile Count Krasinski; Carlyle&#x2019;s assistant Dr. Christie, who wants the respectable consolation of two mutes on the day of his wife&#x2019;s funeral; the washerwoman eerily dependent on mesmerism; and the Irish Catholic who simply promises to return after her death. Froude&#x2019;s fourth choice was the sketch of a visit by Gavan Duffy and his Young Irishmen, all ripe for revolution, and with one of them ready to play the part of a Robespierre. This is not to enter far into interpretation but to raise questions about any autobiographic intention in the Notebook. We might notice the way that it was taken up when Jane was ill and depressed, about <date when="1845-04-00">April 1845</date>, soon after she told her cousin Jeannie Welsh, &#x201C;I have been in a sad way for a long while, and was not saying anything about it to any one,&#x201D; thinking that she was losing her mind, and, on telling Thomas, breaking down in &#x201C;a dreadful fit of crying&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-19/lt-18450709-JWC-JW-01"><sic>19:92</sic><corr>JWC to JW, <date when="1845-07-09">9 July 1845</date></corr></ref>). It is as if she were like the lost two-year-old child whom she wanted to save from &#x201C;the act of dissolving all away into tears.&#x201D; It is autobiography only insofar as it is about her breakdown, in which she reveals herself by writing about others.</p>
<p>A slant always obvious in notebooks and letters is the characterization of <pb id="pg-30-xiii" n="30:xiii"/>Thomas, who again may have had his own point of view. The role he is given is one in which he may have sometimes cast himself: he is the practical, masculine cynic, who thinks it is somewhat crazy to go about collecting stray children from the King&#x2019;s Road, whose mothers may even want to get rid of them: might not she as well &#x201C;put an Advertisement in the Window <hi rend="italic">&#x2018;House of Refuge for stray Dogs and Cats&#x2019;&#x201C;</hi> (<ref target="volume-30/ed-30-jane-carlyle-notebook"><sic>p. 166</sic><corr>JWC&#x2019;s Notebook, <date when="1845-04-13">13 April 1845</date></corr></ref>), so everyone can bring her their woes? If thieves and prostitutes complain that they have no chance of honest work, the answer put in his mouth is, &#x201C;What could they do? &#x2026; They could do <hi rend="italic">this</hi> at least&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">die</hi>&#x2014;rather than go on in such a coil of infamy&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-30/ed-30-jane-carlyle-notebook"><sic>p. 162</sic><corr>JWC&#x2019;s Notebook, <date when="1845-04-13">13 April 1845</date></corr></ref>). In fact he was at least as helpful to his assistant William Christie as she, if less generous than Anthony Sterling.</p>
<p>Yet what the Notebook does show over seven years is a sharp decline in the quality of its entries, as if Jane had lost interest or even the ability to express herself. The handwriting of the last two entries is sharply worse, the expression jerky, the tale of the Irishwoman unfinished and pointless. Before this, the anecdotes of the &#x201C;wild goose chase&#x201D; to Ailsa Craig and the destitute Krasinski do not compare with the sketches she began with, nor does the odd tale of the minor adulteries of the deformed Mr. Bunbury. She may have ended the Notebook with the realization that her writing about other people and things brought no escape from herself.</p>
<p>There is no attempt to escape in <hi rend="italic">Simple Story,</hi> which carries on in <date when="1852-11-00">November 1852</date>. It is suggested in the introduction to <hi rend="italic">Simple Story</hi> (<ref target="volume-30/ed-30-simple-story-of-my-own-first-love"><sic>p. 179</sic><corr>JWC&#x2019;s "Simple Story of My Own First Love"</corr></ref>) that Jane may have written it partly with younger friends such as Kate Sterling in mind, and partly as an attempt to understand herself. But it is a tale that again begins under the shadow of her husband, giving him remarks he may or may not have made. Thomas is said to be contemptuous of Love: it is something for boys, which makes up only a short part of one&#x2019;s existence. She says that the remark comes from his dislike of Thackeray&#x2019;s treatment of women in <hi rend="italic">Esmond,</hi> for what it shows about them and their view of life. This is a part of the story, explained in the first six paragraphs of <hi rend="italic">Simple Story</hi> that have only now been restored since Alexander Carlyle cut paragraphs two to six when publishing his version. In fact it may be a faithful enough account of Thomas&#x2019;s attitude. Nevertheless, if we are to use it in understanding Jane, we need to see its importance in her fictional and personal account of what she thought, and as one which she chose as a striking opening. She does not just make it in passing; and though Thomas never read the tale during her lifetime, we find that, when he does, he is compelled to recognize an allusion to the remarkable passion of his six-year-old sister. The story uses the &#x201C;Coterie-sprache&#x201D; they had created between them; it relies on experiences that they had shared; but Jane, constantly aware that her husband no longer thinks of her in terms of love, seems forced to define herself by criticizing him.</p>
<p>Yet if we think of Lady Harriet Ashburton and of Thomas&#x2019;s devoted attachment <pb id="pg-30-xiv" n="30:xiv"/>to her, we may find an indefiniteness in the story. The great philosopher, who seems to scorn love, was actually the cause of Jane&#x2019;s unhappy jealousy. His real affection (if we can call it that) for Lady Harriet, is fictionally offstage; the actual love, which Jane warns is a pleasant and painful illusion, is denied by her as much as, apparently, by him. The interest and charm of the story, no doubt, lies in its being full of unresolved ambiguities; but she, too, hardly knows whether to see the situation from a child&#x2019;s point of view, with a rueful backward glance, or with unsuppressed resentment at &#x201C;Mr. C.&#x201D; Though she could sometimes stand apart from herself, as she does in explaining how Mrs. Wood&#x2019;s red nose quenches her feelings of benevolence (<ref target="volume-30/ed-30-jane-carlyle-notebook">JWC&#x2019;s Notebook, <date when="1845-04-13">13 April 1845</date><sic>, p. 160</sic></ref>), she is too involved with herself. Much of the story&#x2019;s interest now lies in our teasing out fact from fiction, but she seems unsure about which is which, or who she is.</p>
<p>The Journal takes us closer to what Jane really thought, which is a good reason why we have not been allowed to read it before except in a doctored version. Froude and Alexander Carlyle were fairly frank about how much they had cut. The possibly crucial omission of the entry for <date when="1856-06-26">26 June 1856</date> about the &#x201C;blue marks&#x201D; on Jane&#x2019;s wrists was soon detected (<ref target="volume-30/ed-30-jane-welsh-carlyle-journal"><sic>p. 259</sic>JWC&#x2019;s Journal, <date when="1856-06-19">June 19 1856</date></ref>). The missing entries in the Journal and excised pages have often been passed over. But even before we restore the manuscript as best we can, it has always been clear that the main Journal, <date when="1855-00-00">1855</date>&#x2013;<date when="1856-00-00">56</date>, goes to the heart of what Jane felt day by day.</p>
<p>Jane herself clearly questions the point of a diary: &#x201C;It aggravates whatever is factitious and morbid in you&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-30/ed-30-jane-welsh-carlyle-journal">JWC&#x2019;s Journal, <date when="1855-10-21">21 Oct. 1855</date></ref>). Then, after a break and resumption, it is recognized as &#x201C;Something to hold on to in the darkness and loneliness&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-30/ed-30-jane-welsh-carlyle-journal">JWC&#x2019;s Journal, <date when="1855-10-23">23 Oct.</date></ref>). In her letters she can transform circumstances through her gift for self-dramatization and storytelling, but faced with herself she finds that life has come to look &#x201C;like a sort of Kaleidiscope; a few things of different colours (black predominating) &#x2026; but always the <hi rend="italic">same</hi> things over again!&#x201D; She tries to write about &#x201C;the fact of things,&#x201D; but cannot shake off her mood. Her usual topics of friends, reading, relatives, and domestic life give little pleasure, and the Journal becomes increasingly morbid, not helped by Jane taking morphine because she cannot sleep. The Journal is dominated by images and incidents of suffering and death: the navvy suffocated in a sewer (<ref target="volume-30/ed-30-jane-welsh-carlyle-journal">JWC&#x2019;s Journal, <date when="1855-10-22">22 Oct.</date></ref>); an encounter with men &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">all having lost an arm,</hi> and all singing a doleful ditty&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-30/ed-30-jane-welsh-carlyle-journal">JWC&#x2019;s Journal, <date when="1855-10-27">27 Oct.</date></ref>); blood-red blankets for sale, &#x201C;expressly to be murdered in&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-30/ed-30-jane-welsh-carlyle-journal">JWC&#x2019;s Journal, <date when="1855-11-07">7 Nov.</date></ref>); the mother who has tried to drown her three children in the Thames (<ref target="volume-30/ed-30-jane-welsh-carlyle-journal">JWC&#x2019;s Journal, <date when="1855-11-16">16 Nov.</date></ref>, <ref target="volume-30/ed-30-jane-welsh-carlyle-journal"><date when="1855-12-04">4 Dec.</date></ref>); a boy killed by a wagon &#x201C;crashing over his head&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-30/ed-30-jane-welsh-carlyle-journal">JWC&#x2019;s Journal, <date when="1855-11-27">27 Nov.</date></ref>); the &#x201C;horribly interesting&#x201D; trial of Palmer, the Rugely poisoner. She cannot understand her sickness, only that &#x201C;the positive suffering is complicated with dark apprehensions. Alas, alas and there is nobody I care to <pb id="pg-30-xv" n="30:xv"/>tell about it! <hi rend="italic">not one!</hi> poor <hi rend="italic">ex-spoilt Child</hi> that I am!&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-30/ed-30-jane-welsh-carlyle-journal">JWC&#x2019;s Journal, <date when="1856-04-15">15 April 1856</date></ref>). As well as noting her daily life, she is clearly recording a breakdown.</p>
<p>Neither Froude nor Alexander Carlyle does her justice by leaving out passages that unsettle their views of her character. Faced with misery, Jane repeatedly shows her capacity for humor, sarcasm, and biting commentary. She often rises above her gloom: she relishes the response of Henry James Sr.&#x2019;s spirit, &#x201C;Go to Hell you infernal idiot!&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-30/ed-30-jane-welsh-carlyle-journal">JWC&#x2019;s Journal, <date when="1855-10-24">24 Oct.</date></ref>), enjoys the company of Thomas Ballantyne because he is &#x201C;so very <hi rend="italic">ugly,</hi> and &#x2026; inveterately <hi rend="italic">plebeian</hi>&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-30/ed-30-jane-welsh-carlyle-journal">JWC&#x2019;s Journal, <date when="1855-11-26">26 Oct.</date></ref>), guesses that Ruskin&#x2019;s divorce accounts for his &#x201C;peace and good will&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-30/ed-30-jane-welsh-carlyle-journal">JWC&#x2019;s Journal, <date when="1855-10-30">30 Oct.</date></ref>), gives the lively account of her confrontation at the Tax Office (<ref target="volume-30/ed-30-jane-welsh-carlyle-journal">JWC&#x2019;s Journal, <date when="1855-11-21">21 Nov.</date></ref>), leaves Geraldine in a huff, exclaiming &#x201C;Boppery Bopp!&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-30/ed-30-jane-welsh-carlyle-journal">JWC&#x2019;s Journal, <date when="1855-11-26">26 Nov.</date></ref>), and receives a volume of devotional poetry, <hi rend="italic">Waters of Comfort,</hi> doubting the comfort &#x201C;tho&#x2019; nobody can deny the &#x2018;Water&#x2019;&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-30/ed-30-jane-welsh-carlyle-journal">JWC&#x2019;s Journal, <date when="1856-05-20">20 May 1856</date></ref>).</p>
<p>Underlying these bursts of wit lies an anguished realization that Thomas enjoys his relationship with Lady Harriet. It is galling to Jane that her rival should surpass her not just in wealth and ostentation but in conversation, attention to literature, being entertaining, and gathering eminent men around her. She bitterly recalls the days when Thomas praised her remarkable intuition, &#x201C;when there was no Lady A to take the shine of me, in <hi rend="italic">his</hi> eyes&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-30/ed-30-jane-welsh-carlyle-journal">JWC&#x2019;s Journal, <date when="1855-10-29">29 Oct.</date></ref>). She tries to be friendly to Lady Harriet, yet with no wish to share Thomas. It is the &#x201C;eternal Bath House&#x201D; that separates them, &#x201C;every stone&#x2019;s weight of it,&#x201D; borne on her &#x201C;heart&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-30/ed-30-jane-welsh-carlyle-journal">JWC&#x2019;s Journal, <date when="1855-10-22">22 Oct.</date></ref>).</p>
<p>Her craving for reassurance and affection reaches an extreme in her emotional reunions with old &#x201C;lovers,&#x201D; George Rennie and John Stodart. Love, in fact, is a constant topic; and this later period, sadly enough, is one in which she can hardly go anywhere without meeting a former &#x201C;lover.&#x201D; It had been part of the pain and pleasure of going back to Haddington that she had been adored there, not just by her parents but by the servants and young men around her, down to the cooper who saw her as &#x201C;the tastiest young Lady in the whole Place&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-24/lt-18490802-JWC-MAAN-01"><sic>24:164</sic><corr>JWC&#x2019;s MAAN, <date when="1849-08-02">2 Aug. 1849</date></corr></ref>; <ref target="volume-27/lt-18520910-JWC-JRS-01"><sic>27:278</sic><corr>JWC to JRS, <date when="1852-09-10">10 Sept. 1852</date></corr></ref>). Edward Irving has often been the chief figure that biographers have liked to dwell on, but the person who most dramatically starts up from the past in the Journal is George Rennie. To Thomas he is respected but &#x201C;unmelodious,&#x201D; yet he even shapes her account of her misery. As they are reunited she springs into his arms with kisses, &#x201C;a different woman &#x2026; strengthened body and soul&#x201D; (<sic><date when="1856-05-24">24 May 1856</date></sic><corr><ref target="volume-30/ed-30-jane-welsh-carlyle-journal">JWC&#x2019;s Journal, <date when="1856-04-25">25</date> and <date when="1856-04-26">26 April 1856</date></ref></corr>). In spite of some lapses, &#x201C;last week I was all for dying, this week all for ball dresses!&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-30/ed-30-jane-welsh-carlyle-journal">JWC&#x2019;s Journal, <date when="1856-05-01">1 May</date></ref>). Then, at the Rennies&#x2019; dinner, &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">like everything looked forward to with pleasure,</hi>&#x201D; it is &#x201C;an entire failure! The Past stood aloof.&#x201D; She never escapes herself.</p>
<p>The Journal shows the bitter disillusion that Geraldine Jewsbury writes of to Froude, <date when="1876-11-22">22 Nov. 1876</date> (<ref target="volume-30/ed-30-geraldine-jewsbury-to-froude"><sic>p. 263</sic><corr>GEJ to JAF, <date when="1876-11-22">22 Nov. 1876</date></corr></ref>). There are the sour phrases about Neuberg&#x2019;s <pb id="pg-30-xvi" n="30:xvi"/>sycophancy (<ref target="volume-30/ed-30-jane-welsh-carlyle-journal">JWC&#x2019;s Journal, <date when="1856-04-20">20 April 1856</date></ref>), belied by Jane&#x2019;s letters to Neuberg and what we know of her husband&#x2019;s response. When dining is &#x201C;made easy&#x201D; on an invitation from Mrs. Rennie, Thomas&#x2019;s agreement, that &#x201C;there was no refusing her,&#x201D; is said to be given &#x201C;with inward curses.&#x201D; In fact, in spite of the excisions made, probably by Thomas and, certainly in the case of the &#x201C;blue marks,&#x201D; by his niece Mary, the remaining full text of the Journal is packed with her distress and resentment.</p>
<p>We have to note that Jane wrote her Journal when her depression was at its worst, greater even than she was to suffer after her street accident in <date when="1863-10-00">October 1863</date>, which left the constant &#x201C;grinding wretchedness&#x201D; of her &#x201C;&#x2018;Neuralgic Rheumatism&#x2019;&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Reminiscences,</hi> 164). Already, with Lady Harriet&#x2019;s own illness, the feeling of oppression was lessening, to be lifted with Lady Harriet&#x2019;s death in <date when="1857-05-00">May 1857</date> and succeeded by the ecstatic friendship with Louisa Lady Ashburton. The Journal was written in Jane&#x2019;s darkest time.</p>
<p>How dark is confirmed in Geraldine&#x2019;s letter of <date when="1876-00-00">1876</date>, which for all the questions it raises gives a definite impression of Jane soon after Geraldine came to London, especially in the passages that haven&#x2019;t been published before. Jane&#x2019;s mood is confirmed by Ellen Twisleton&#x2019;s account of the period at Craigenputtoch, written soon after <date when="1855-11-00">November 1855</date>, when the Journal is a blank from <date when="1856-12-14">14 December</date> to <date when="1856-03-24">24 March 1856</date>. There can be no reason to doubt that it represents what Jane told Ellen, but it is still a question why the two women should have collaborated on a report like this, only to put it aside like an unexploded grenade, to be set off more than 140 years later. For it is a curious document, and far from a straightforward account of what happened in <date when="1828-00-00">1828</date>&#x2013;<date when="1834-00-00">34</date>. A letter can be seen as a communication from writer to recipient, whereas this is to be understood as written by Ellen not just for her friend but with other readers in mind. Ellen is telling Jane, and Jane is telling Ellen, what she has just told her already. Both want to be overheard. One may imagine that the younger woman, once told, has suggested that Jane should write it down; but her answer, with understandable pride, is that her friend should do so. Ellen deals with it, therefore, shows a draft to Jane, and they produce a revised version. So, for all its apparent spontaneity, it is essentially a personal impression, disclaiming the status of direct autobiography, expressing with some passion, her memory of a past in which precise dates are largely irrelevant. Yet how far it is precisely true, or consistent with other records of the same time, is in question, there obviously being other records in letters and recollections. We can easily understand why Jane&#x2019;s later account does not agree with her letters written in <date when="1828-00-00">1828</date>&#x2013;<date when="1834-00-00">34</date>, nor with Thomas&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences;</hi> but we should be clear that there <hi rend="italic">is</hi> a sharp discrepancy. When he read the Journal, Thomas could not escape the recognition that he had failed to see her deep distress in the eighteen-fifties, but he never gave <pb id="pg-30-xvii" n="30:xvii"/>up his conviction that &#x201C;We were not unhappy at Craigenputtoch; perhaps these were our happiest days&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> 78).</p>
<p>Again, the account is not exactly an indictment of her husband, whom we can imagine somewhere nearby as she addresses Ellen, perhaps with Edward Twisleton in the attic den contentedly discussing Dante, or current affairs: both Thomas and Edward were at times dreary spouses for spirited, lively younger women. If Jane and Ellen gave any thought to what would happen to their record, it may have been in the reasonable belief that the story would somehow come out years hence in posthumous justification of Jane&#x2019;s sense of martyrdom. Yet, as with most accounts of the Carlyles&#x2019; marriage by Jane&#x2019;s friends, it still shows a respect for Thomas&#x2019;s good intentions though aware that he often had little concern for anyone&#x2019;s circumstances but his own. He and Jane resort to Craigenputtoch because he chooses to go there. We are reminded that it is Jane&#x2019;s mother&#x2019;s generosity that makes it possible, yet it is seen as his good nature more than anything else that delays payment of Mrs. Welsh&#x2019;s rent; and as the &#x201C;Laird&#x201D; he is actually too gentle to the servants, if sometimes inconsiderate.</p>
<p>Thomas often felt at this time that <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> was not worth his labor and that the Prussian epic distracted him and weakened his influence. He works &#x201C;in a whirlwind of dancing sand&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-30/lt-18550905-TC-JN-01">TC to <sic>Neuberg</sic><corr>JN</corr>, <date when="1855-09-05">5 Sept.</date></ref>), on &#x201C;a History of Fritz that no man can write&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-30/lt-18550923-TC-LA-01">TC to <sic>Lady Harriet</sic><corr>LA</corr>, <date when="1855-09-23">23 Sept.</date></ref>) of &#x201C;so essentially a desperate and <hi rend="italic">undoable</hi> a character: why I should persist is strange to me; for I have oftenest no motive, or little, except the reluctance to be <hi rend="italic">beaten</hi>&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-30/lt-18551229-TC-EMA-01">TC to <sic>Eduard Magnus</sic><corr>EMA</corr>, <date when="1855-12-29">29 Dec.</date></ref>). The biography gave him an escape from his unhappy marriage and ordinary socializing, and his constant complaint about the pressure of work disguises a deeper dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>Yet his interest was genuine. He admired Prussianism, responded imaginatively to the battles, and revisited the Enlightenment with the same skeptical spirit he had shown in <hi rend="italic">The French Revolution.</hi> The biography was less a paean to despotism and &#x201C;drill&#x201D; than the description of an iconoclast who challenged the corrupt monarchies of Europe and prepared the way for the movement that would violently challenge the rule of monarchy, aristocracy, and &#x201C;Respectability.&#x201D; Like the embattled King of Prussia, he persists because he has faith in his own judgment. The greatness of the biography lies in his ability to sympathize with Frederick and his harsh yet loving father, Friedrich Wilhelm, and to see the world from their vantage point. Though candid about Fritz&#x2019;s failures, Thomas identified with a man who held tenaciously to his principles yet was surprisingly open to criticism. In his &#x201C;Obliterated Rembrandt&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 18:482) portrait of Frederick, he sees a reflection of himself battling the false orthodoxies of his age; for the Prussian king &#x201C;does wonderfully without sympathy from almost anybody; and the indifference with <pb id="pg-30-xviii" n="30:xviii"/>which he walks along, under such a cloud of sulky stupidities, of mendacities and misconceptions from the herd of mankind, is decidedly admirable to me&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 18:215).</p>
<p>Contrary to Thomas Carlyle&#x2019;s professed belief, he was still influential. Many felt that his condemnation of parliamentary government had been vindicated by events in the Crimea. Chapman &#x26; Hall had followed up its publication of <hi rend="italic">Prophecy for <date when="1855-00-00">1855</date>: Selected from Carlyle&#x2019;s &#x201C;Latter-Day Pamphlets&#x201C;</hi> in June with <hi rend="italic">Passages Selected from the Writings of Thomas Carlyle</hi> in October. Both were edited by the journalist, Thomas Ballantyne (see <ref target="volume-29/lt-18541223-TC-JAC-01"><sic>29:223&#x2013;24</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1854-12-23">23 Dec. 1854</date></corr></ref>). Introducing the first selection he recalls the controversy Carlyle raised in <date when="1850-00-00">1850</date>: &#x201C;The newspapers, echoing the popular voice, hailed the new Rhadamanthus with &#x2026; contemptuous laughter. Many of those even who had formerly admired Mr. Carlyle&#x2019;s writings, joined the common outcry. &#x2026; How long it might have taken, under ordinary circumstances, to convert the English people to perfect accordance with Mr. Carlyle&#x2019;s views regarding &#x2018;Downing Street,&#x2019; &#x2018;Stump Oratory,&#x2019; and the failure of Parliament to govern this nation, it would be difficult to say. The war and the imperative business arising out of that unexpected event, have upset all ordinary calculations&#x201D; (3&#x2013;4).</p>
<p>Carlyle had recognized the defects of the political system more clearly, and incisively than most &#x201C;experts&#x201C;: &#x201C;A sham government having allowed us, by its own confession, to &#x2018;drift into war&#x2019; everybody now begins to see that a real Premier is necessary, to manage the work caused by the new state of things. Routine having broken down under the hard gallop into which it has been forced by the pressure of events and the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> newspaper, there is a general outcry for &#x2018;Administrative Reform,&#x2019; and no small amount of &#x2018;Stump Oratory&#x2019; is likely to be expended in proving that Mr. Carlyle was a true prophet in <date when="1850-00-00">1850</date>, when he denounced the whole system of procedure by which Governments are appointed and broken up in this country&#x201D; (4). He had not only questioned Anglo-French achievements in the Crimea but had also challenged the whole basis of moral and political correctness, raising awkward questions about nationalism, race, democracy, and the British constitution. Justifying the decision to publish a second volume of Carlyle&#x2019;s writings in October, Ballantyne declared: &#x201C;The main object of the selector has been to give &#x2018;the general reader&#x2019; some notion of what has been said by the most original thinker of the present age, on various questions&#x201D; (26).</p>
<p>Reviewing the second collection in the <hi rend="italic">Leader</hi> (<date when="1855-10-27">27 Oct. 1855</date>), George Eliot wrote that &#x201C;there is hardly a superior or active mind of this generation that has not been modified by Carlyle&#x2019;s writings; there has hardly been an English book written for the last ten or twelve years that would not have been different if Carlyle had not lived. &#x2026; The extent of his influence may be best seen in the fact that the ideas which were startling novelties when he first <pb id="pg-30-xix" n="30:xix"/>wrote them are now become common-places.&#x201D; Those who objected to Carlyle&#x2019;s stylistic &#x201C;exaggerations&#x201D; and &#x201C;dangerous paradoxes&#x201D; in the <hi rend="italic">Latter-Day Pamphlets</hi> overlook the value of his rhetorical method: &#x201C;When he is saying the very opposite of what we think, he says it so finely, with so hearty a conviction&#x2014;he makes the object about which we differ stand out in such grand relief under the clear light of his strong and honest intellect &#x2026; that we are obliged to say &#x2018;Hear! Hear!&#x2019; to the writer before we can give the decorous &#x2018;Oh! Oh!&#x2019; to his opinion.&#x201D; Notwithstanding frequent complaints, there was still life in Carlyle. As Eliot points out, &#x201C;He does not, perhaps, convince you, but he strikes you, undeceives you, animates you.&#x201D;</p>
<p>In this volume we have also been able to use some of the letters of Ellen Twisleton&#x2019;s sister, Elisabeth Dwight, to their sister Mary Parkman (Houghton Library, Harvard, MS 45m-98). Elisabeth had returned with the Twisletons from Boston, was being introduced to Ellen&#x2019;s friends in society, and gives us an independent report on the Carlyles and the Ashburton circle (<date when="1855-12-14">14 Dec. 1855</date>). After meeting Lady Harriet during her stay at the Grange, she declares that she &#x201C;deserves admiration &#x26; respect for more than her wit, &#x26; that she is free from petty ways of thinking. &#x2026; You will see that I am considerably in love with her, though I feel the wonderful difficulty of understanding these English people, without the observation of <hi rend="italic">years,</hi> for the code of universal good breeding which is so religiously observed, has somewhat the effect of a universal mask, through which the different individualities are very dimly seen on first consideration.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Her description of arriving at the Grange gives a scene highly familiar to the Carlyles and an idea of Elisabeth as an observer: &#x201C;A heavenly servant met us at the door, who carried us through the Door to the Drawing-room, which is about the size of the Common.&#x201D; They are taken to their rooms: a large one for the Twisletons, with a dressing room for Edward, and a smaller one for herself, and &#x201C;everything that a human mind could desire; fires in each, of course, but also tea-kettles in each, which is refinement of malice, calculated to make one feel more at home than in their own house, and enabling you to scald yourself or friend, at the shortest notice.&#x2014;We have only a Vandyke in one room, &#x26; a Paul Veronese in the other, in the way of pictures, which isn&#x2019;t what we are accustomed to, but we managed to get on, &#x26; overlook the omissions of the other great masters.&#x201D; They meet Lady Harriet before dinner, finding her &#x201C;stately but kindly, but there was no fuss made.&#x201D;</p>
<p>After breakfast, when Lady Harriet appears, &#x201C;arrayed in black velvet spencer, &#x26; brown flounced silk shirt, &#x26; cap with blue ribbons,&#x201D; she gives a more-or-less impromptu reading from one of the essays of James Russell Lowell, when &#x201C;Lowell himself could not have done more justice to his own jokes than did Lady A&#x2014;with all the elegance of her stately manner modified to suit the occasion. I must say, at this [word illegible], she was perfectly <pb id="pg-30-xx" n="30:xx"/>enchanting.&#x201D; Later, Elisabeth thinks her unable to &#x201C;open her mouth without being agreeable, everyone who is within ear-shot of her enjoys themselves by necessity. I can think of nothing but the princesses in the fairy-tales who spoke pearls &#x26; diamonds, when I listen to her, &#x26; the indescribable charm of her voice, language &#x26; manner increases every day.&#x201D; At other times it is clear that Lady Harriet often preferred the serious conversation of guests such as Professor Benjamin Jowett.</p>
<p>Ellen was delighted at the arrival of the Carlyles, with whom she soon &#x201C;coalesced.&#x201D; At dinner, Elisabeth enjoyed Jowett&#x2019;s company, and they agreed that they would set more store by Lord Lansdowne&#x2019;s &#x201C;prophecies, for the next twenty years, than for Carlyles.&#x201D; Lord Lansdowne&#x2019;s &#x201C;gentle, cheerful words seem to have so much more of the spirit of truth, in them, than those protracted howls &#x26; lamentations.&#x201D; But, as the stay continued, she reports that Thomas &#x201C;is never seen to such advantage as here.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Other fellow guests are noticed shrewedly, such as Jane Brookfield, &#x201C;Thackeray&#x2019;s model woman, &#x26; supposed to be the original of his Amelia&#x201D; in <hi rend="italic">Vanity Fair,</hi> &#x201C;an exceedingly pretty person, who does not speak above her breath, comes &#x2018;the startled fawn&#x2019; perpetually, &#x26; dresses in true English style, with a net on her head, &#x26; a mantle on her shoulders. The gentlemen admire her &#x26; the ladies want to &#x2018;set a dog on her.&#x2019;&#x201D; The Dwight sisters, Ellen and Elisabeth, are acute observers, and leave us in little doubt of their reliability.</p>
<p>These descriptions suggest that the Carlyles&#x2019; letters are not always a final source for understanding them. It is welcome to find a fresh perspective of the Carlyles&#x2019; circle, their correspondents, and their times, and to recognize that every text has a broader context.</p>

JWC celebrates her birthday alone (<date when="1855-07-14">14</date>). TC writes Sir G. Sinclair declining his invitation to visit (<date when="1855-07-24">24</date>). TC tells his brother John he privately thinks his work can never &#x201C;have much value &#x2026; to the beautiful British public of these times&#x201D; (<date when="1855-07-28">28</date>). He continues work on <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> with Neuberg&#x2019;s help.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic"><date when="1855-08-00">August</date></hi>. Edward FitzGerald invites TC to Woodbridge in Suffolk (<date when="1855-08-01">1</date>), and, after some hesitation, TC goes there for a holiday (<date when="1855-08-08">8</date>). They bathe, ride, and drive around, including visiting the Crabbe family and Aldeburgh. Arthur Helps and TC see Lewes&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Life and Work of Goethe</hi> through the press. TC is reading Voltaire. JWC in Cheyne Row organizes a major cleaning and calls the painters in, escaping briefly to Willesden (<date when="1855-08-10">10</date>&#x2013;<date when="1855-08-11">11</date>), taking a day trip to Brighton and Rottingdean for bathing and to look for a seaside cottage (<date when="1855-08-13">13</date>). She visits Jane Brookfield (<date when="1855-08-17">17</date>), and TC returns from Suffolk (<date when="1855-08-18">18</date>). They set out for Brighton but turn back at London Bridge (<date when="1855-08-20">20</date>). While TC rides Neuberg&#x2019;s horse to Addiscombe (<date when="1855-08-26">26</date>), JWC returns to Brighton by train and cancels her plans to rent a cottage (<date when="1855-08-27">27</date>). They both go to Addiscombe (<date when="1855-08-30">30</date>). John Carlyle leaves Scotland for Germany.</p>

<salute>Dear Forster,</salute>
<p>I have remembered that I am to go tomorrow (Monday) to the &#x201C;Crystal Palace&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >At Sydenham, S of the Thames; see <ref target="volume-29/lt-18540428-TC-JAC-01"><sic>29:71</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1854-04-28">28 April 1854</date></corr></ref>.</note> (sorrow on it!), and that I cannot be with you at the Athenaeum, as I proposed. We must say, Tuesday 4&#xBD; p.m., therefore; and if you answer <hi rend="italic">nothing,</hi> that shall remain fixed.</p>
<p>I have seen Lowe; he believes in the likelihood of the Adventure, in the &#x26;c &#x26;c;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Lowe, leader writer, and the appeal for Anne and Frances Lowe to be made through the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>. For the campaign to raise an official literary pension for the Lowe sisters, see <ref target="volume-29/lt-18550400-TC-DMLP-01"><sic>29:299&#x2013;302</sic><corr>TC to DMLP, <date when="1855-04-30">30 April 1855</date></corr></ref> and other letters of <date when="1855-05-00">May</date>&#x2013;<date when="1855-06-00">June 1855</date>. It had been first suggested to TC by Thomas Erskine sometime in early <date when="1855-04-00">April</date>. Erskine wrote to the Rev. Thomas Wright Mathews (not further identified, apparently not a clergyman in Deptford), <date when="1855-04-12">12 April</date>: &#x201C;I wish you would get from that goddaughter of the old lexicographer some documents authenticating her relationship as goddaughter to him. Do you think that, in the parish register of her baptism, any record of the fact could be found? For, if the history could be fairly made out, there can be little doubt but that something could be done for her. I mentioned the matter to Carlyle, who immediately said that the Prime Minister would feel that the bestowment of a small pension, at least to the extent of keeping her from want, would be recognised by the whole country as a right use of power&#x201D; (Hanna 92&#x2013;93). The meeting with Erskine is not referred to at the time, although he had gone for a drive with JWC on <date when="1855-03-21">21 March</date> (<ref target="volume-29/lt-18550321-JWC-JN-01"><sic>29:274</sic><corr>JWC to JN, <date when="1855-03-21">21 March</date></corr></ref>), but TC mentioned in <date when="1855-11-00">Nov.</date>, shortly after the campaign was revived, that &#x201C;Erskine saddled me with that&#x201D; (see <ref target="volume-30/lt-18551119-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1855-11-19">19 Nov.</date></ref>).

That is not a very overflowing &#x201C;manner,&#x201D; I could assure her Ladyship and you; but that does secure (on the lowest terms, as I computed) the vessel from leaking dry again;&#x2014;and we should all be very grateful to see it <hi rend="italic">so</hi> left if possible.</p>
<p>Meanwhile I have written to stop, at once, the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> operation; willing enough to steer wide of that, if it can at all be avoided. I have also enclosed your beneficent little missive to the poor old women, taking care not to <pb id="pg-30-3" n="30:3"/>awaken any farther hopes in the interim. <closer><salute>And I am and remain (at least till Sunday)</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Forster,</salute>
<p>The Ministerial Fortress (in that Lowe matter), hearing of the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> Newspaper, beats the <foreign><hi rend="italic">chamade</hi></foreign> [drum signal for a parley],&#x2014;or rather <hi rend="italic">half</hi>-beats it, for everything is done by halves if <hi rend="italic">possible,</hi> and we are to have a half-pension, it appears!</p>
<p>Lady Stanley had been here yesterday; but the maid was not discoverable, the Wife away; and the man here in his garret heard only a bumping and thumping, which he imputed to external Carpenters. Not till this morning at Post-time was her Ladyship&#x2019;s Card, marked with a message in pencil, discovered in the box; I thereupon wrote by Express; and here is the answer, for your reading: a Pension of &#xa3;10 for the younger Lowe,&#x2014;a half-pension!</p>
<p>What is to be done with it? Upon the whole I perceive that we must <hi rend="italic">accept,</hi> and let the matter lie there for the present. It gives the Lowes &#xa3;71 annually, with a sum to start from; and no noise made about it.&#x2014; I think therefore you had better wrap up all that stuff of Papers for the Times, with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> more trouble spent upon them; seal, date and label the Packet (as I have no doubt you do all documentary matter), and let it lie there, <hi rend="italic">till</hi> some new pressure of difficulty arise,&#x2014;forever and a day, let us hope!</p>
<p>We are much better out of the thing than we might have feared. Thanks to the noble energy of Forster which has failed at no point of the crush,&#x2014;and saved me from likelihood of suffocation, me for one! Some time you can do a little paragraph about the thing in <hi rend="italic">The Examiner;</hi> and so it will handsomely finish.</p>

<p>I find they contain most part of Voltaire&#x2019;s Works,&#x2014;the chief exception is the <hi rend="italic">Letters,</hi> which I have otherwise;&#x2014;and I shall get considerable benefit by having them near me. If you at any time want the Books <hi rend="italic">before</hi> this weary <pb id="pg-30-8" n="30:8"/>Task of mine is over, have the goodness to give me notice, and they shall be instantly returned. The Task once done, they come home by nature;&#x2014;but alas that is rather an uncertain date, which I must not wish to tie you to! Meanwhile accept many thanks for this act of polite kindness; and believe me</p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Surely you are abundantly kind to think of me in such a combination; and I cannot but regret to answer that there is no feasibility in the affair. I am much too poor for an M. P.; and, what is still more irremediable, am at least 20 years too old: nor indeed could I ever have hope to distinguish myself in such a Cockpit,&#x2014;nor even have much wished to do so, had it always been what it now is, and looks too like continuing to be. The British Empire seems to me <pb id="pg-30-9" n="30:9"/>as if melting down into universal <hi rend="italic">diabetes</hi> of insane palaver,&#x2014;all men speaking, and intent to speak, and no man addressing himself, with earnestness or likelihood, to <hi rend="italic">do,</hi> in any department whatsoever. This is very sad and hopeless;&#x2014;and has produced a <hi rend="italic">Balaklava,</hi> not in the Crimea alone, but in every province of our affairs;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Crimean War between Russia and Britain and France had begun in late <date when="1854-03-00">March 1854</date>; see <ref target="volume-29/lt-18540214-TC-JCA-01"><sic>29:31</sic><corr>TC to JCA, <date when="1854-02-14">14 Feb. 1854</date></corr></ref>, and later refs. The battle of Balaclava had included the Charge of the Light Brigade, <date when="1854-10-25">25 Oct. 1854</date> (see <ref target="volume-29/lt-18550312-TC-JF-01"><sic>29:270</sic><corr>TC to JF, <date when="1855-03-12">12 March</date></corr></ref>). TC came very quickly to use Balaclava as a metaphor for useless enterprise (see <ref target="volume-29/lt-18550323-TC-GM-01"><sic>29:276</sic><corr>TC to GM, <date when="1855-03-23">23 March</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-29/lt-18550501-TC-JF-01"><sic><sic>303</sic><corr>302</corr></sic><corr>TC to JF, <date when="1855-05-01">1 May</date></corr></ref>).</note> for our whole British world (I should say) has been &#x201C;a Balaklava,&#x201D; ever since I have known it, or made practical scrutiny of it in high things or in low. And now it seems as if the account were fast getting <hi rend="italic">completed,</hi> and the Eternal Powers were saying to us, &#x201C;Enough, ye Hypocrites!&#x201D; For I have perceived, too, this long while, that we are sunk in <hi rend="italic">Hypocrisy</hi> deeper than any Nation ever was before; so deep that we are quite unconscious of it: no Nation, ancient or modern, ever sat down so contentedly by the side of Untruths without number, saying to them, &#x201C;True, you are Lies, not God&#x2019;s facts at all, but the Devil&#x2019;s lies; nevertheless, you seem to have money in your pocket, power in your hand, and one can live handily by speaking you fair!&#x201D; Till it has come to the pass we see: Parliamentary and other &#x201C;eloquence&#x201D; in very great abundance; all <hi rend="italic">work,</hi> or power of work (to which God will grant success, or the title of <hi rend="italic">true</hi> work) gone out in consequence: a bad time indeed, except perhaps (temporarily) for very bad men. Alas, when &#x201C;Administrative Reformers&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-29/lt-18550530-TC-JF-01"><sic>29:320</sic><corr>TC to JF, <date when="1855-05-30">30 May</date></corr></ref>. TC told Duffy, <date when="1855-07-28">28 July</date>, that talk about administrative reform was &#x201C;very idle and worthless. The people of England lived by steadfast industry,&#x201D; paying no attention to &#x201C;questions of patronage and promotion,&#x201D; and that the public service was notoriously the &#x201C;honestest in Europe, the least liable to be diverted from its duty by any temptation, and that was nearly all one wanted to know about it.&#x201D; Duffy thought that it seemed &#x201C;a serious and dangerous injustice in the English system that all the great prizes of public life were reserved for the aristocracy, and all the petty prizes for their nominees&#x201D;; TC denied this: &#x201C;the higher classes, having more leisure and easier access to Parliament, naturally came in for more of the guerdons &#x2026; but probably no one was denied the share he was fairly entitled to, especially in the highest offices&#x201D; (Duffy 196&#x2013;97).</note> &#x26;c apply to me, I have nothing to say. I think sorrowfully, &#x201C;How is work possible if all able men are invited everywhere, and as it were compelled, to spend their faculty in speaking? He that cannot first hold his tongue will never do any work! Before &#x201C;Administrative Reform&#x201D; arrive to much purpose, you will have done a thing or two you are but little prepared for, and your big <hi rend="italic">Parliamentary</hi> or Talking Apparatus (the envy of surrounding Nations) still less prepared for!&#x201D;&#x2014; &#x2014; But enough, enough of all that; upon which I know not how I have got into utterance; for in general I strive to keep it far away from my thoughts, as too painful and useless there.</p>
<p>It is really matter of regret to me that I cannot get to Clifton,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly Clifton, near Bristol, or one of the several Cliftons in Scotland.</note> according to your kind invitation, just now. Perhaps I may find you in Thurso yet some day <pb id="pg-30-10" n="30:10"/>before all is done! Certainly if I ever go into those parts, or otherwise have opportunity, I shall be right glad to make such an acquaintance; not having by any means too many of that kind on my list at present,&#x2014;so far as can be judged at this distance. <closer><salute>Meanwhile with many thanks and regards,&#x2014;to which let me add respectful hopes for the good invalid Lady,&#x2014;I remain</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I am very glad to hear from you again, and nothing but good news, nothing that one can call <hi rend="italic">bad</hi>. I did not know I was in your debt; thought it was the other way: but indeed that would not have signified, had there been anything to say. I have been unusually quiet ever since you went away; dreadfully held down too with the &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">eff</hi>ects of heat,&#x201D; for some time,&#x2014;till the new temperature became <hi rend="italic">habitual:</hi> of late, especially ever since the Brighton <hi rend="italic">rattle</hi> of 200 miles,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably to see if it would be a good place for a holiday; &#x201C;200 miles&#x201D; unexplained; Brighton is 50 mi. SSE of London.</note> I have been fully as well as before, rather <hi rend="italic">better</hi> than otherwise. And now the fury of the heat, I suppose, is quite out: at least we are <hi rend="italic">drenched</hi> to the centre; two such days of pouring wet (yesterday and the day before) as I hardly ever saw: we are very quiet, too, in the night;&#x2014;and on the whole I am doing better than some time ago.</p>
<p>We have made no arrangement for going out of Town. There was to be a visit, in these very days, to a certain Marquis of Downshire (or <hi rend="italic">Marchioness</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Plattnauer,</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Arthur Wills Blundell S.

Hill (<date when="1812-00-00">1812</date>&#x2013;<date when="1868-00-00">68</date>), M.P. for County Down (<date when="1836-00-00">1836</date>&#x2013;<date when="1845-00-00">45</date>), 4th marquess of Downshire from <date when="1845-00-00">1845</date>; m., <date when="1837-00-00">1837</date>, Caroline Frances (d. <date when="1893-00-00">1893</date>), eldest da. of 1st viscount Combermere. The visit was probably to have been to the family seat at East Hampstead Park, Wokingham, Berks., not Hillsborough Castle, Downshire, Ireland. Plattnauer was presumably tutoring their two sons, b. <date when="1844-00-00">1844</date> and <date when="1846-00-00">1846</date>.</note> on the score of &#x201C;examining some Historical Papers&#x201D; of the house; which do not concern <hi rend="italic">me</hi> at all);&#x2014;which broke down (on my side) when it came to the point. Fitzgerald offers me a week of Cottage (excellent milk, d<hi rend="italic">o</hi> pony &#x26; gig, d<hi rend="italic">o</hi> &#x26;c &#x26;c) on the Suffolk shore:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >FitzGerald was in London, staying with Spedding and about to go to Bredfield Rectory, Woodbridge, near the coast. He wrote to Emily Tennyson, <date when="1855-07-30">30 July</date>, that TC was &#x201C;talking of you both a week ago; he says he&#x2019;ll come back to me in Suffolk&#x201D; (Terhune, <hi rend="italic">LEF</hi> 2:170).</note> I keep that as a refuge against any intolerable blaze of heat;&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">may</hi> perhaps run out thither, if there is a Steamer to Ipswich. Not to speak of other possibilities. In short, I should not wonder if we staid here, or nearly staid, the same as last year. All people <pb id="pg-30-11" n="30:11"/>are getting away; Town three-parts empty already: once they are <hi rend="italic">gone,</hi> one is amazingly quiet, and not ill off for temperature, if the wind will blow. Scotsbrig&#x2014;alas, alas, there are such thoughts connected with Scotsbrig,&#x2014;I dare not think of it at present; nor of the kind souls that are there left to me! I guess in fact there ought to be no attempt that way, just now.</p>
<p>I am getting but ill forward with my work; yet I never altogether throw it up any day; therefore shall perhaps make progress, tho&#x2019; at the sixth part of average speed. &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Ich hab&#x2019; mein Sach&#x2019; auf Nichts gestellt</hi>&#x201D;;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;I have placed my trust in nothing&#x201D; (Goethe, &#x201C;Vanitas Vanitatum Vanitas,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Gesellige Lieder</hi>).</note> I admit quietly that my work never can have much value, and that what little it may have will seem <hi rend="italic">naught</hi> or a minus quantity to the beautiful British Public of these times: a candid recognition of these facts contributes somewhat to composure of mind in my present circumstances.</p>
<p>Alan Ker sends me another Letter from the Tropical Regions; which is inclosed here,&#x2014;to be burnt by you when read.

He and some other independents were pledged to oppose every govt. that refused the demands of the Irish Tenant League, which were fixed tenure, fair rents, and free sale.

Duffy persevered: &#x201C;I can recall no period in a long lifetime so entirely destitute of recreation as the years I spent in the House of Commons. The business in which I was determined, if possible, to succeed swallowed up my whole life. &#x2026; One pleasure only I allowed nothing to interfere with. I spent a couple of hours every Sunday with Thomas Carlyle in Hyde Park, or Battersea Park, with an occasional <hi rend="italic">d&#xE9;tour</hi> to John Forster&#x2019;s&#x201D; (Duffy, <hi rend="italic">My Life in Two Hemispheres</hi> [<date when="1898-00-00">1898</date>] 2:95).

Upon returning to Dublin, he learned that the Irish Roman Catholic bishops had forbidden their priests to support the Tenant League. Seeing it was hopeless, Duffy resigned as M.P. and emigrated: &#x201C;In July I said farewell to the Carlyles, sailed three months later, and landed at Melbourne in the beginning of <date when="1856-00-00">1856</date>&#x201D; (Duffy 201&#x2013;2).</note> Poor fellow;<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On <date when="1855-07-28">28 July</date>, TC and Duffy had talked sceptically about the water cure at Malvern; TC &#x201C;marvelled to note during the summer months what a steady stream of simpletons set from London to Worcestershire. / Yes, I said, simpletons tempered by sages. My bathman told me, and everyone who would listen, of his attendance on Mr. Carlyle and of that great man&#x2019;s behaviour under the douche, or wrapped in wet sheets like an Egyptian mummy swathed in cerements. The bathman was a living witness that a man may still occasionally be a hero to his <hi rend="italic">valet de chambre</hi>. / Carlyle laughed, and said it was very proper he should be found out&#x201D; (Duffy 199).

<salute>Dear Fitzgerald,</salute>
<p>In spite of these heavy showers, I persist in believing the weather will clear, and means really to be dry: at any rate I am not made of sugar or of salt; so intend to be off tomorrow;&#x2014;and am, even now, in all the horrors of a half rotted ship, which has lain two years, dead, among the ooze, and is now trying to get up its anchor again: ropes breaking, sails holed, blocks giving way, you may fancy what a pother there is!</p>
<p>My train is to be 11 a.m. from Shoreditch; which gets to Ipswich about two? If you have a gig and pony, of course it will be pleasant to see your face at the end of my shrieking, mad, (and to me quite horrible) rail operations: but if I see nothing, I will courageously go for the Coach, and shall do quite well there, if I can get on the outside especially. So don&#x2019;t mind which way it is; a <hi rend="italic">small</hi> weight ought to turn it either way. I hope to get to Farlinghay not long after 4 o&#x2019;clock,&#x2014;and have a quiet mutton chop in due time, and have a d<hi rend="italic">o</hi> pipe or pipes: nay I could even have a bathe if there was any sea water left in the evening. If you did come to Ipswich, an hour (hardly more) to glance at the old Town might not be amiss.</p>
<p>I will bring Books enough with me: I am used to several hours of solitude every day; and cannot be said ever to <hi rend="italic">weary</hi> of being left well alone. But we will &#x201C;drive&#x201D; to any places you recommend; do bidding of the omens, to a fair degree withal: in short I calculate on getting some real benefit by this plunge into the maritime rusticities under your friendly guidance, and the quiet of it will be of all things welcome to me.</p>
<p>My wife firmly intended writing to you today, and perhaps has done so; but if not, you are to take it as a thing done, for indeed there was nothing whatever of importance to be said farther.</p>
<p>Tomorrow then (<date when="1855-00-08">Wednesday 8<hi rend="italic">th</hi></date>) 11 a.m.&#x2014;wish me a happy passage.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC later noted: &#x201C;I was persuaded out to a Suffolk week, under Edward Fitzgerald&#x2019;s keeping, who had been a familiar of mine ever since the old battle of Naseby inquiries. Father, a blundering Irishman, once proprietor of vast estates there and in Suffolk, &#x26;c. Foolish Naseby monument, his [see <ref target="volume-15/lt-18420918-TC-EF-01"><sic>15:89</sic><corr>TC to EF, <date when="1842-09-18">18 Sept. 1842</date></corr></ref>]. Edward still lives in Woodbridge, or oftenest in his coasting boat, a solitary, shy, kindhearted man. Farlingay was a rough, roomy farm and house, which had once been papa&#x2019;s, and where Edward still had a rough and kind home when he chose. I did not fare intolerably there at all; kind people, rather interesting to me. Snatch of country welcome on the terms. The good Fitz gave me a long day&#x2019;s driving, and, indeed, several others shorter, which are partly in my recollection, too. I had seen Aldborough, had bathed there, and thought as a <hi rend="italic">quasi</hi>-deserted, but not the least dilapidated, place it might suit us for a lodging. / Ugly home voyage in Ipswich steamer, &#x26;c., stuffy railway having grown so horrible to me&#x201D; (Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi> 2:249&#x2013;50).</note></p>

<salute>Dear Neuberg,</salute>
<p>Thanks for your gleanings about <hi rend="italic">Dettingen</hi> &#x26;c (that last &#x201C;Letter&#x201D; you excerpt from is in the Gentleman&#x2019;s Magazine): I must go myself and look into <hi rend="italic">Stille</hi> and a good many of those old corners. What a pity for <hi rend="italic">me</hi> the &#x201C;British Museum&#x201D; had not still slept in chaos with Panizzi in the belly of it; I might then have got at the King&#x2019;s Library <hi rend="italic">without</hi> headache.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Neuberg wrote from the British Museum, <date when="1855-08-28">28 Aug.</date>, after failing to find Stille (see <ref target="volume-30/lt-18550728-TC-JN-01">TC to JN, <date when="1855-07-28">28 July</date></ref>): &#x201C;There are 9 big folio-vol<hi rend="italic">s</hi> of Catalogues of &#x2018;Continued Kings-Pamphlets&#x2019; &#x2026; arranged <hi rend="italic">alphabetically</hi> by their <hi rend="italic">titles</hi> (not chronologically, as the old ones are), and there is no finding any thing unless one knows the title.&#x201D; Panizzi had been involved in cataloguing the pamphlets, early <date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>s, and had devised rules for alphabetical cataloguing of the many anonymous pamphlets.</note> But we must take things as they are.</p>
<p>We expected you last Sunday Ev<hi rend="italic">g;</hi> and concluded at last you were still at Brighton.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Neuberg had gone to Brighton, <date when="1855-07-29">29 July</date>, for a week.</note> I myself go off tomorrow for the Suffolk Coast, to Fitzgerald&#x2019;s whom you have seen; who asserts the singular solitude, airiness &#x26;c of his quarters;&#x2014;who at least commands some sort of sea-bathing with immunity from nocturnal noises; and is one of the most courteous delicate and friendly souls now breathing. I am to stay with him for a week. &#x201C;Farlinghey Hall, n<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Woodbridge, Suffolk&#x201C;: that is the address, if you have anything to ask, or the impulse to tell me anything, by way of breaking the solitude. I take down some books: but design to be as idle and as silent as is well possible.</p>
<p>My wife is here still: if I found good sea-water in Suffolk, and lodgings to suit (as is possible), we may bring her thither without my leaving; otherwise she knows (thro Tait) of some place in Sussex,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Rottingdean.</note> and will set off (shortly, but not this week, I guess) thither on her own score. That is all the news.</p>
<p>There are two Pieces here, on Dettingen and on Fontenoy, susceptible of being copied (with <hi rend="italic">omissions,</hi> that is an essential point): but there is not the least hurry in respect of them. <closer><salute>And so <foreign>adieu</foreign> for a little while.</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Sir,</salute>
<p>I am very much obliged to Mr Erskine and to you; and the Book shall be well taken care of. But I perceive there must be some mistake in Mr Erskine&#x2019;s order: he and I had heard of a certain alledged &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Mitchell&#x2019;s</hi> Life of Sir Andrew Mitchell&#x201D; (which I now guess to be a mere blunder, and to have no existence): it was <hi rend="italic">this</hi> that I wished to look at, and that Mr Erskine doubtless aimed to get for me. The &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Bisset&#x2019;s</hi> Life and Papers of Sir A<hi rend="italic">w</hi> Mitchell&#x201D; (London, <date when="1850-00-00">1850</date>, 2 voll.)<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-27/lt-18520606-TC-KAVE-01"><sic>27:138</sic><corr>TC to KAVE, <date when="1852-06-06">6 June 1852</date></corr></ref>.</note> I have got here, and know as well as is needful.</p>
<p>At lowest there is no <hi rend="italic">ill</hi> done. If your Book prove (as I think it will) to be <hi rend="italic">this</hi> Bisset, I have directed Mr Chapman to return it by the first fit opportunity, and to give you notice by post of its arrival in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>.&#x2014; I myself am leaving Town tomorrow for a week or two; and would not have any delay in the settlement of this matter.</p>
<p>My conclusion is that the other Book is a mere <hi rend="italic">phantasm,</hi> or fallacious shadow of an object that does not anywhere exist,&#x2014;and which at least need not give us any <hi rend="italic">more</hi> trouble than we have now had with it. I will write to Mr Erskine by and by, explaining. I remain (with thanks for your kind punctuality, and with pleasant remembrance of a gentleman of your name in old years),<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC was first given access to the Advocates&#x2019; Lib. in <date when="1820-00-00">1820</date> (see <ref target="volume-01/lt-18201206-TC-MAC-01"><sic>1:293</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1820-12-06">6 Dec. 1820</date></corr></ref>); he continued to use it, courtesy of advocate acquaintances, until he moved to London in <date when="1834-00-00">1834</date>.</note></p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I came out duly yesterday,&#x2014;in spite of very bad symptoms of weather, night of perfect torrents preceding my departure;&#x2014;and, after the usual <pb id="pg-30-20" n="30:20"/>clangour and suffocation for about 3 hours, got safe to Ipswich; where the beneficent Fitzgerald was duly waiting for me with gig &#x26;c, tho&#x2019; himself lame of a sprained ancle, and by no means sure of my coming that day. He is one of the best landlords anywhere to be fallen in with.</p>
<p>This is a pleasant fertile country, up and down, with woody fringings and wheat and turnips in abundance,&#x2014;not quite unlike Annandale in general character, except that there is no rising of mountains in the distance nor any waste land, nor audibly running stream, near at hand. The physiognomy of the Country people really is good; very patient, very stout and honest and reasonable: no <hi rend="italic">look</hi> of poverty but all the houses neat with hollyhock gardens and the common <hi rend="italic">etcetera</hi> duly about them.</p>
<p>Fitzgeral<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> here is with an old pair of farm-people,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Job Smith and his wife.</note> once dependants of his Father&#x2019;s, who occupy this old Farm-villa (rather in a dilapidated state) by way of farm house, and even a little farm at some distance; and are full of loyal attentions to &#x201C;Mr Edward&#x201D; or any one that belongs to him. I have got an excellent bedroom, best of the many rooms that are in the queer old rambling house: a glass-house on the lower story leans up against my gable; I am <hi rend="italic">window,</hi> above that, from wall to wall (12 feet or more of more window); look out upon green pasture fields after the garden is; and see the Church Tower and chimney tops of Woodbridge well intermixed with trees about half a mile off towards the noon sun (if there <hi rend="italic">were</hi> yet any sun!) Nothing can be quieter, more rustic simple; there is even a kind of sea bathing (tho&#x2019; only towards highwater) which I tried this morning, and found to be very fair.&#x2014; I have not yet done much in the way of <hi rend="italic">sleeping,</hi> or otherwise &#x201C;improving,&#x201D; but I have engaged for a week at any rate. The only acquaintance I mean to make is that of a rev<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Mr Crabbe son of the Poet,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Rev. George Crabbe of Bredfield, son of the poet George Crabbe.</note> an old man, and much an intimate of F&#x2019;s in this neighbourhood.&#x2014; Tell Jamie there never was such rain! Corn evidently much hurt here (especially oats and barley) all the way from London; turnips (it seems) all eaten by &#x201C;the jack&#x201D;; a kind of <hi rend="italic">fly</hi> so named. Write to me what is going on at sc<hi rend="italic">rg</hi>.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Scotsbrig.</note></p>

<salute>My dear little <foreign>Bairn</foreign>,</salute>
<p>I do hope you got some sleep last night, when all was quiet about you; and that your poor little head and wearied nerves are somewhat pacified. It is too bad, when sleep is denied one,&#x2014;&#x201C;the last refuse of the wretched,&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC wrote &#x201C;refuse&#x201D; for &#x201C;refuge,&#x201D; either joking or in error; perhaps a combination of Burns&#x2019;s &#x201C;wretched refuge&#x201D; (&#x201C;A Birth-day Ode. December <date when="1787-00-31">31st. 1787</date>,&#x201D; st. 1), and Johnson&#x2019;s &#x201C;last refuge of the scoundrel&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Boswell&#x2019;s Life of Johnson</hi> 2:348).</note> tho&#x2019;, as some one remarks, it is only the happy that have called it so. I sent many thoughts after you yesterday; and it was a strange reflexion to me when I was about half way that you were just about getting into our little shop at Chelsea again.</p>
<p>I had the due malodorous suffocation, which is the lot of British travellers, in my railway pen: go always in the <hi rend="italic">third class,</hi> were it only for the honour of the thing, I said: can any predicament be more disgraceful to a man of respectability than that of stewing for hours in foul air, at once fetid and poisonous to him, soul and body! However, it did not last quite 3 hours: Chelmsford, Colchester<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Chelmsford, 30 mi. NE, and Colchester, 52 mi. NE of London, both in Essex.</note> shewed successively their steeples in the distance; &#x26; there at length, with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> worse accident than rain, was Ipswich, and, in another minute of looking, Fitzgerald, halting poor fellow with a sprained ancle, dabbled with recent rain, but faithful with his gig, tho&#x2019;, as you w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> see, he must have had misgivings as to my coming. He shewed me Ipswich; drove me home, successfully, tho&#x2019; under some heavy showers. This is a curious old place, a kind of decayed villa, or mongrel between farmhouse and villa, with innumerable closets, and some tolerable rooms, all dry and clean, tho&#x2019; rather crazy in the woodwork; a <hi rend="italic">jamb</hi> of kitchen &#x26;c fixes itself on the rear: by day the <hi rend="italic">main</hi> house is Fitz&#x2019;s and mine, or rather mine only for the good F. studies to <hi rend="italic">efface</hi> himself in every way, even to a painful degree. He has surrendered (I find) his own bedroom to me; a fine airy place, 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi> story, from side to side of the house, with an eminent old four-poster in it (and curtains lined with green chintz,&#x2014;ah me!)&#x2014;here I now am, here I mean to sit, when within doors, nearly all day; an excellent place. I have a window on the right <hi rend="italic">flank,</hi> smallish and low, opening in leaves; in front (my front is the southern gable of the house) I am almost all window together, and look out upon a little breadth of garden, then over pasture fields with plenty of trees all about; and amid the <pb id="pg-30-22" n="30:22"/>leaves I can see Woodbridge red Church tower, and the red housetops shutting up the scene on that side.</p>
<p>The &#x201C;Smiths&#x201D; (proprietors of the mansion) are excell<hi rend="italic">t</hi> old farm-people; speak with a dialect almost equal to that of Nithsdale, and have all the indigenous English farm-qualities (making of puddings, bread, cream &#x26;c included) in a truly comfortable degree. F. not being quite a lodger,&#x2014;nor indeed can I clearly define what he is,&#x2014;had a kind of embarrassment (I could perceive) last evening; but I helped what I could, tho&#x2019; at the expense of <hi rend="italic">talking</hi> much more than I wished: I hope all that is now settled, and that I <hi rend="italic">shall</hi> in truth be beautifully let alone. There is nothing else to be desiderated: it is as wholesome a smooth pleasant grassy and leafy rural retreat as I could have found anywhere; and surely even a week of it will be of some benefit to me.</p>
<p>I made no great figure in the way of sleep last night; I had <hi rend="italic">talked</hi> too much, dined injudiciously: in fact I found on getting up hither I had clearly caught a little cold: however, I was as <hi rend="italic">silent</hi> as Sahara; and I did manage to pick up a fair modicum of sleep. Soon after six I got out and had a long stretch of a walk; including a <hi rend="italic">sea-bathe;</hi> for we have to take that at the top of the tide; and tomorrow, I perceive, it is likely to hit the eye of my breakfast, and to be <hi rend="italic">omitted</hi> for that one day. It was tolerable bathing really, but rather difficult to come at,&#x2014;and with a good dash of <hi rend="italic">fresh</hi> in the water, at that time of the tide.</p>
<p>On the whole I begin to fear there will be no great likelihood for my poor Goody in these parts: we have not yet <hi rend="italic">seen</hi> any place, of course; but I perceive there <hi rend="italic">can</hi> be no coach (Railway ending at Ipswich 8 miles off too), for Woodbridge lies against, if not the sea, yet the ooze of the tide; and there is no crossing except by a ferry yawl. I will see farther, however; but I doubt, I doubt.</p>
<p>Today we have (thank Heaven) gray dryish weather; at night (I am now close on dusk or 8 o&#x2019;clock the hour of <hi rend="italic">post</hi>) we had a beautiful sunset, <hi rend="italic">silent</hi> bright yellow radiance, nicely spotted with long shadows of trees, while I smoked my pipe. Tomorrow perhaps it will continue and improve.</p>
<p><closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, Dearest; there <hi rend="italic">is</hi> the Post passing. Nay he is <hi rend="italic">passed;</hi> and I am to go down with the Letters myself, by way of evening walk.</salute></closer></p>
<p><closer><salute>May I hear good news tomorrow morning, &#x26; may you sleep well tonight.</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>My Dear,</salute> am I to understand you literally: &#x201C;out of it all <hi rend="italic">tomorrow</hi>&#x201D;? And are you actually off somewhither this day, and going to lodge somewhere in infinite space in general, tonight! I cannot blame you for wishing to be far away from Chalmers&#x2019;s paint and the chimney sweeps; but I did not anticipate you would be so sudden: I shall in truth be anxious tomorrow for a scrap of writing from you again; for there will be none till Monday, if I miss then. Any way I hope it will turn out well with you! You have a great heart for so small a body, to venture forth into the unknown with nothing but a bundle under your arm.</p>
<p>As to me things go prosperously altogether. I made an excellent sleep out last night; at least two sleeps added together that amounted to excellent: and today my cold is as good as quite gone. You see I <hi rend="italic">have</hi> skill in the weather too: here are the sunny Autumn days begun; and this, the first of them, has been one of the beautifullest that could be desired: as nice a morning as I remember to have seen; and your Letter waiting for me, and good Fitz sitting patient on a big block (huge stump of a tree-root, in which they have sown mignonette &#x26;c) at the head of the garden till I pleased to come down.</p>
<p>&#x2014;I got no sea-bathing (only a cold-water bath within doors in the domestic style); but I have sauntered about, reading, in the fields; we drove in the gig (poor F. still lame, &#x26; like to be for some days); afterwards I walked lustily (tho&#x2019; as yet too little of it) thro&#x2019; pleasant lanes, and quiet country roads all of hard smooth sand, and hardly any vehicle or creature in them: in short a day <hi rend="italic">suitable</hi> to my purpose in coming here. I already seem to feel twice as strong for walking; and, in my light clothes, step along at a great rate in spite of the windless fervent heat. Yesterday was absolutely cold; I had on my <hi rend="italic">sleeve-waist coat,</hi> and F. had lent me a dressing gown (which I did not use): but today there is heat with a vengeance. I design to have a try again at the sea tomorrow, <pb id="pg-30-25" n="30:25"/>at all events a good walk before breakfast: it is a pleasure to walk hereabouts in such a morning as today&#x2019;s was.&#x2014; I had forgotten: it is not <hi rend="italic">tomorrow,</hi> it is Sunday (<hi rend="italic">here</hi>) that is my last post from London for the week. Crabbe called today; we had called at his place yesterday and found his daughter, a hard-favoured but very honest rational and amiable woman:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Caroline, who lived with him.</note> C. is very frothy of tongue but good stuff too, I see</p>

I fancied I should fall into such sound calm sleep in these circumstances. I told Darwin on Thursday, and he bought me a cake of chocolate to eat on the journey: neither Geraldine nor Ann knew what was in my head, nor did Darwin know I meditated going by Third class, and at night&#x2014; After parting from Darwin on Thursday while I was taking my tea at half after five &#x201C;a sudden thought struck me&#x201D;; <hi rend="italic">would</hi> the third class carriages to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> really be <hi rend="italic">open</hi> ones, like those to Brighton. and if not, <hi rend="italic">what</hi> would they be like? better inform myself on that point before hand; I put on my bonnet instantly and walked to Sloan Square where I took an Islington Omnibus and reached Euston Square Station in time to see the train start at eight&#x2014; Oh Heaven! the third class was a black hole of Calcutta on wheels!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A dark, airless cell in which, it was said, up to 146 British prisoners of Siraj-ud-Daula died overnight, <date when="1756-06-20">20 June 1756</date>.</note> closely roofed in, windows like pigeon holes, and no partitions to separate the twelve breaths of one carriage from all the breaths of all the third class carriages! The second class was little better and the expense of first class, tho&#x2019; I could have perfectly well <hi rend="italic">stood it,</hi> would have been far greater than the advantages to be attained warranted me to &#x201C;indulge in.&#x201D; So <hi rend="italic">that</hi> project was felled on the spot&#x2014; I was thankful I had ascertained in time&#x2014;and that I had <hi rend="italic">not</hi> written a word to Auchtertool. And now what next? When Friday came I had not yet decided on any feasable course beyond waiting for the Sunday or Monday train to Brighton and going there, and then on to Bexhill. Meanwhile Chalmers&#x2019;s paint was killing strong, and the (our) house carpetless and comfortless, and Ann in not the best of tempers, at having to bestir herself, instead of taking her ease, with us both out of the way.</p>
<p>So when M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Neuberg came to ask me to Willesden for a day or two; I was glad to start there and then, and sleep one night at least in a new position&#x2014; It is as charmingly fresh here, the &#x2018;air,&#x2019; as anywhere, I should guess. And there are goosberries&#x2014;and when the young gentlemen had made an end of &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">hollaring</hi>&#x2019; <pb id="pg-30-27" n="30:27"/>and banging and bumping over head, reminding me severely of the Addiscombe footmen, the house was sufficiently quiet, and my bed was fourposted, and free of bugs. <hi rend="italic">But</hi>&#x2014;as there is always a something&#x2014;I did not get slept a quarter of an hour together&#x2014;thro the infatuation of Nero!

<p>Where is my poor little Dame careering this day; towards what point of the compass, or in what mood of mind or circumstances, is she wandering about the world? This is the question I have constantly before me today; and my thoughts fly wandering after you, and can get no response, nor form themselves into any reasonable guess at all. I wish I had written yesterday, as I did intend in spite of the difficulties there were. But if you had been intending for Brighton, my Letter could not have reached you in time; so it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have been to no purpose, for easing <hi rend="italic">my</hi> doubts at least. On the whole I am very glad you got no farther than Willesden; glad above all that you did not venture on any <pb id="pg-30-28" n="30:28"/>of those wild Edinburgh expeditions. The villain Nero, to keep you awake with <hi rend="italic">his</hi> miserable freaks! I wonder you did not fling him out of window; I felt as if the clear course of nature would have been (what I have often recommended to no purpose) to fling <hi rend="italic">him</hi> into the river, and so end that part of one&#x2019;s botherations&#x2014; What I shall like best is that you <hi rend="italic">have</hi> gone to Brighton today, and that you return tonight, well blown upon by all these heavenly winds; and that you be at Chelsea tomorrow morning quietly over your coffee to read this Note,&#x2014;I reading one from you at the same hour. Which latter clause, unless you write <hi rend="italic">from Brighton</hi> in good time, will be difficult.</p>
<p>There have been some adventures here,&#x2014;or rather one adventure;&#x2014;but all goes right after it, and much as before. It was an adventure of <hi rend="italic">cows;</hi> cows go in a field (or rather <hi rend="italic">went</hi> but, do not now go) opposite this big window, separated merely by the garden and an invisible fence. The night after I wrote last, these animals, about 2 a. m., took to lowing (&#x201C;blaring&#x201D; the Suffolkers call it) with an energy to have awakened the Seven Sleepers;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Legendary Ephesians who slept for centuries before waking; &#x201C;invisible fence&#x201C;: prob. a haha.</note> no soul could guess why, but there they raged and lowed thro&#x2019; the night watches, awoke the whole house here, and especially awoke me, and held me very vigilant, till six when I quietly arose for an immense <hi rend="italic">walk</hi> thro&#x2019; the fields and lanes! No evil came of it, only endless sorrow to poor Fitz and the household, endless apologies &#x26;c &#x26;c: the cows were removed to another field, where they graze entirely mute, according to their former wont; and I have slept, well or not to complain of ever since; and am really growing better and better in my silent rustication here. Would it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> last a while longer! But I must not ask for more than I can handsomely take, but be thankful. (I have been to bathe, and have walked between 6 and 7 miles, since the end of last sheet 2 hours ago,&#x2014;amazingly short of time now!)</p>
<p>Fitz took me down yesterday to Aldborough:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Now Aldeburgh, on E Suffolk coast, 12 mi. NE of Woodbridge.</note> a very pleasant drive thro&#x2019; the gray damp air, and the hamlets and heaths, 17 miles; off at 8 a. m., home about the same hour, evening. F. had represented (as his wont is) the Town of Aldborough as quite a ruinous place, ugly &#x26;c: I found it a really beautiful little sea-town, <hi rend="italic">old</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Ald&#x201D; means &#x201C;old.&#x201D;</note> as the Hills, but trim, tidy, quiet, in excellent repair; and truly I think one of the best Bathing-places I have seen. Nothing can excel the sea; a mile of fine shingly beach, with patches of smooth sand every hear<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> and there; clean sea water shelving rapidly deep at all hours; beach <hi rend="italic">solitary</hi> beyond wont: whole town rather solitary; seemingly some 30 or 40 souls of the smaller-gentry sort (Clergy &#x26;c) here a-bathing, mostly quartered about the excellent big Inn; native population (I suppose) fishers and thrifty industrious <pb id="pg-30-29" n="30:29"/>people, prosperous enough (I hope) tho&#x2019; without excess of cash.&#x2014; Lodgings (F. assures me) <hi rend="italic">are</hi> to be had, and of the kind required: I send two announcements, in reasonable looking houses; but, during sunday and divine service, could not get to look farther into them. You <hi rend="italic">can</hi> be boarded at the Inn for a guinea a-week, F. tells me; an excell<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Inn, as I said; Fitz supposed &#x201C;you get a little room, ring the bell and after &#xBE; of an hour, somebody comes&#x201C;: which is clearly <hi rend="italic">worse</hi> than the truth. He himself had lived there; but always in Lodgings. A beautiful smooth sand walk, &#xBE; of a mile, lies between the sea and the Town; fine d<hi rend="italic">o</hi> walk in the rear of town, looking over the chimneys of it: open heath, open beach, plenty of walking. Certain of the female smaller gentry yesterday had lapdogs.</p>
<p>Well, my notion is, if you have yet gone nowhither, you sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> think of Aldbro&#x2019;. I myself imagine, <hi rend="italic">if</hi> a lodging c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be had there (which is probable), I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> like very well to take a fortnight or so of it; never saw any place <hi rend="italic">more</hi> promising at least. Distance from Ipswich 25 miles; coach 3 times a week: you go by the train I took (only by the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> class, that I insist on); a coach (with 3 horses) waits you there,&#x2014;pleasant road, and in three hours one is in Aldbro&#x2019;. <hi rend="italic">If</hi> you bit at this, F. and I w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> go down again, and try for a Lodging. <hi rend="italic">Thursday,</hi> I imagine w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be the eligible day: one has to avoid <hi rend="italic">Saturday,</hi> F. says, as the Coach is then the most crowded. Tell me what you think of all this.</p>
<p>If you do not take to the project, do not. I will stay out my time hereabouts (till the latter end of this week, I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> guess), then come quietly home to Chelsea, and take to my work again; leaving <hi rend="italic">you</hi> what &#x201C;sea-room&#x201D; you judged fit: unless your invitations towards Bexley<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For &#x201C;Bexhill.&#x201D;</note> &#x26;c were more pressing than I think they w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be, I should be apt to stay still for my own part, &#x26; avoid any farther journeying &#x201C;thro clangour and suffocation&#x201D; for the current year. At all events let the prophetic spirit of Goody <hi rend="italic">speak:</hi> we will at once proceed to action, at least I will; and some definite result shall be arrived at straightway.</p>
<p>The good Mrs Smith (Mother of neat-handed kind Phyllises)<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Rustic maidens, as in Vergil&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Eclogues</hi> and Milton&#x2019;s &#x201C;L&#x2019;Allegro&#x201D; 86.</note> has bro<hi rend="italic">t</hi> me up a tumbler of <hi rend="italic">rum-and-milk,</hi> all spiced &#x26;c: and I could be much at <hi rend="italic">my</hi> ease staying here; but we <hi rend="italic">are</hi> to go and dine with Parson Crabbe, nay to sleep there at least this night,&#x2014;poor F. I perceive secretly wishes and needs it, so I cannot help myself: sorrow on it! But the Crabbe house (I do believe, for I have seen it) is even quieter than this; and tho&#x2019; a <hi rend="italic">gentleman&#x2019;s</hi> house, nothing but freedom and honest rusticity prevails in it: so I <hi rend="italic">must</hi> make up a little package and go. Y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Letters direct <hi rend="italic">hither</hi> as before: it is but 2 miles off (farther away from you, Crabbe&#x2019;s is); and I trust to get back hither altogether tomorrow.</p>
<p>I have read two volumes (actually!) since I came out hither: Voltaire Books. <pb id="pg-30-30" n="30:30"/>Why cannot I get staid where I am? Time presses; Fitz and his gig are drawing out, and it is time to be off.&#x2014; <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, Dearest; <hi rend="italic">drown</hi> Nero, and be reasonable!

<p>No Dear; I dont take to <hi rend="italic">your</hi> seabathing place, because I have a place of my own in view! Positively I fancy I have found <hi rend="italic">the Coming cottage!</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;A poor old vacant hut at Rottingdean, which was to be furnished, to be sure! Dear soul, what trouble she took, what hopes she had, about that! <foreign><hi rend="italic">Sunt lachrymae rerum</hi></foreign> [There are things for tears]&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note in <hi rend="italic">LM</hi>). Jane Brookfield wrote her husband, <date when="1855-08-18">18 Aug.</date>, that JWC had visited her and been &#x201C;very pleasant and entertaining.&#x201D; JWC had described her visit to Brighton and Rottingdean, &#x201C;where she discovered a charming cottage to be let unfurnished at twelve pounds a year, and no taxes.&#x201D; She thought TC would approve but &#x201C;he was resolved against it often as he had wished for a little place &#x2026; in the country&#x201D; near London, and &#x201C;this was very pretty as well as very cheap&#x201D; (Brookfield, <hi rend="italic">Circle</hi> 2:418).</note> I am just going off to consult Tait about it. And at all events you must go and look at it with me next Monday, before we incur any lodging-expenses&#x2014;which would be best laid out on a place &#x201C;all to oneself.&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-13/lt-18411022-JWC-TCH-01"><sic>13:284</sic><corr>JWC to TCH, <date when="1841-10-22">22 Oct. 1841</date></corr></ref>.</note></p>
<p>I took such an amount of air and exercise yesterday as would have <hi rend="small-caps">done for</hi> most nine-teenth century <hi rend="italic">females!</hi> Started at eight, by the boat,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Chelsea steamboat, for London Bridge&#x201D; (note in <hi rend="italic">LM</hi>).</note> with a good tide and was at the station a quarter before nine. Was quite well situated in my open carriage and reached Brighton without the least fatigue. <hi rend="italic">Bathed</hi> the first thing; and then walked along the shore to a little Inn I had been told of by Neuberg and Ballantyne; as a charming quiet place &#x201C;for <hi rend="italic">even</hi> M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle&#x201D; to stop at; found it, of course, noisy dirty not to be even <hi rend="italic">dined</hi> at by <hi rend="italic">Mrs</hi> Carlyle&#x2014;and walked on, still further along the cliffs, to a village I had <hi rend="small-caps">seen on the map</hi>, and was sure must be very retired. The name of it is Rottingdean. It is 4 miles <hi rend="italic">at least</hi> from the Brighton Station. I <hi rend="italic">walked</hi> there and back again!! and in the last two miles along the cliffs I met just <hi rend="small-caps">one</hi> man! in a white smock! Thus you perceive the traveller expences to one of the quietest sea villages in England is just per boat &#x26; third class train 3/10<hi rend="italic">d!</hi>. a convenient locality for one&#x2019;s cottage at all rates. The place itself is an <hi rend="italic">old sleepy</hi> looking little village close on the sea, with simple poor inhabitants. not a trace of a Lady or gentleman bathe[r] to be seen!&#x2014; In fact except at the Inn there were no lodgings visible. I asked the maid at the Inn, &#x201C;was it always as <pb id="pg-30-31" n="30:31"/>quiet as this?&#x201C;&#x2014; &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">always,</hi>&#x201D; she said, in a half whisper, with a half sigh,&#x2014;&#x201C;a-most <hi rend="italic">too</hi> quiet!&#x201D;&#x2014; Near the Inn, and so near the sea you could throw a stone into it, are three houses in a row&#x2014;the center one old&#x2014;quaint, and empty&#x2014;small rooms but enough of them&#x2014;and capable of being made very livable in at small cost&#x2014;and there are <hi rend="italic">two</hi> &#x201C;decent women&#x201D; I <hi rend="italic">saw,</hi> who might either of them be trusted to keep it&#x2014; But I should fill sheets with details without giving you a right impression&#x2014;you must just go and <hi rend="italic">look</hi>. I returned to Brighton again&#x2014;after having dined at the Rottingdean Inn on two fresh eggs a plateful of homebaked bread and butter, and a pint bottle of <hi rend="italic">Guiness</hi> (ch<hi rend="italic">aa</hi>rge 1/6d)&#x2014;I walked miles up and down Brighton to find the Agent, for that cottage&#x2014;did finally get him by miracle&#x2014;name and street being both different from what I set out to seek&#x2014;and almost committed myself to take the cottage for a year at 12&#xa3; (no taxes or rates whatever) or to take it for 3 months at six pounds&#x2014; However I took fright about <hi rend="italic">your</hi> not liking it,&#x2014;and the expences of furnishing &#x26;c &#x26;c&#x2014;on the road up&#x2014;and wrote him a note from Alsops shop<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Alsop, chemist, Sloane Sq.</note> that he might not refuse any other offer and hold me engaged till you had seen and approved of it. If Tait shared <hi rend="italic">this</hi> cottage and went halves in the furnishings it would cost very little indeed&#x2014;My only objection to it this morning, is that one might not be able to get it <hi rend="italic">another year</hi> and then that would be done with the furniture? But oh what a beautiful sea! blue as the Firth of Forth it was last night!&#x2014;I lay on the cliffs in the stillness, and looked at the &#x201C;beautiful Nature&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; cf. <ref target="volume-26/lt-18510827-JWC-HW-01"><sic>26:142</sic><corr>JWC to HW, <date when="1851-08-27">27 Aug. 1851</date></corr></ref>.</note> for an hour and more, which was such a <hi rend="italic">doing</hi> of the picturesque as I have not been up to for years. The most curious thing is the sudden solitude beggining <hi rend="italic">without gradation</hi> just where Kemptown<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Area at E end of Brighton.</note> ends&#x2014; It is as if the Brighton people were all <hi rend="italic">enchanted</hi> not to pass beyond their peir&#x2014;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note></p>
<p>One can get any sort of Lodgings <hi rend="italic">in Brighton</hi>&#x2014;I brought away the card of one&#x2014;very beautiful, and clean as a pin where the <hi rend="italic">Lady</hi> &#x201C;received no <hi rend="italic">dogs</hi> nor <hi rend="italic">children</hi>&#x201C;&#x2014;&#x201C;dogs she did <hi rend="italic">not</hi> dislike, but she dreaded their fleas.&#x201D; An excellent sitting room and bed room 30/ &#x2014;sitting room and two bedrooms 2&#xa3;&#x2014;but then they are such rooms as one has at home not like Eastbourne! But Brighton is Brighton&#x2014;Rottingdean is like a place in a novel. I <hi rend="italic">am</hi> stiff today.&#x2014; I had to walk to St Pauls last night&#x2014;after all my walking&#x2014;before I got an omnibus and then from Alsop&#x2019;s home&#x2014;and last night the results of Cremorne<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cremorne Gdns., Chelsea, popular place of public entertainment.</note> in the Kingsroad were what shall I say?&#x2014; <hi rend="italic">strange</hi> upon my honour! First I heard a measured tread and then out of the darkness advanced on me eight soldiers carrying high over their heads a bier! on which lay a figure <pb id="pg-30-32" n="30:32"/>covered with a black cloth all but the white white face! and before I had recovered from the shock of that&#x2014;some twenty yards further on behold precisely the same thing over again!</p>
<p>I asked a working man what had happened&#x2014; &#x201C;It was a great night at Cremorne&#x2014;storming of Sebastopol&#x2014;30 or forty soldiers were <hi rend="italic">storming,</hi> when the scafolding broke, and they all fell in <hi rend="italic">on their own</hi> bayonets! The two who had passed were killed they said and all the others hurt&#x201C;&#x2014; But a sergeant, whom I accosted after, told me there were none killed and only three hurt badly.<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Populace, soldiers, officers: was there ever seen such a transaction among men before?&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note in <hi rend="italic">LM</hi>). The <hi rend="italic">Examiner,</hi> <date when="1855-08-18">18 Aug.</date>, reported the accident on <date when="1855-08-13">13 Aug</date>. at the reconstruction of the allied storming of Sebastopol in Cremorne Gardens, which were full for the attraction. Men from the Household troops, Royal Artillery, and the Grenadier Guards took part &#x201C;to give the whole display a character of reality.&#x201D; Toward the end, &#x201C;when the defenders &#x2026; had been driven to the highest part of the staging. &#x2026; , the gallery on which they stood gave way.&#x201D; About sixty men with fixed bayonets fell &#x201C;at least twenty feet&#x201D;; some twenty were injured, suffering bayonet wounds and broken bones. &#x201C;The case which gives most anxiety is that of a man suffering from internal injuries.&#x201D;</note></p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Fitz and I have come over to this place (which is the Parsonage of one <pb id="pg-30-33" n="30:33"/>Crabbe, Poet Crabbe&#x2019;s son, a very honest wholesome man); have been here since Monday; but are going back to Farlingay tomorrow;&#x2014;and on Saturday I go <hi rend="italic">home</hi> by the Ipswich Steamer: 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. at Blackwall,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Part of the Port of London, N bank of the Thames.</note>&#x2014;and say the usual dinner time at Chelsea, if all go well.</p>
<p>Your Letter came to me the day after my arrival: very welcome indeed. I have bathed daily, have been much driven about in the Farmer&#x2019;s gig, and have passed my time not unpleasantly; I suppose even this 8 days of a totally new mode of living will prove of some benefit. But I need not talk of all that; being in &#x201C;dreadful hurry&#x201D; just now, dinner waiting, and post not to be saved except at gallop! That Letter of Alick&#x2019;s came to me this morning; and except it go now, you will not get it till next week.</p>
<p>Tell Jamie all is busy here with wheat harvest; excellent crop, they report, and weather now looking <hi rend="italic">steady grey;</hi> wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is a great comfort. The <hi rend="italic">Potatoe blight,</hi> however, has appeared since the rain ended; and I have seen it unmistakeable.</p>
<p>I have bathed daily; I have been at Aldborough, which is a very pretty and very quiet and sequestered bathing-place,&#x2014;whither I invited Jane, if she were so minded, to come and join me for another fortnight: but she has other speculations, on the <hi rend="italic">Brighton</hi> side of the world, and it is not impossible but we may go thither for a little while, were I home again.</p>
<p><closer><salute>My affectionate regards to Jamie, Isabella &#x26; their household. I am <hi rend="italic">full</hi> of haste,&#x2014;and Yours ever</salute></closer></p>

<p>Well, you won&#x2019;t go to Aldborough; so my responsibility is done. I confess, in my indolence, I was rather glad, this morning, that you had so decided. For F. and I were standing on the slip; and had your word been yes, we should have been off and in a great hurry indeed.</p>
<p>He knows Rottingdean, he says; a village correctly defined by you as clean and &#x201C;sleepy&#x201C;: I know not what to think of the Cottage; but mean, with due obedience, to go at least and look at it; you and the judicious Tait having all the arrangements estimated and prefigured ready for a Yes or No.&#x2014; F. says it is a very <hi rend="italic">dear</hi> country; otherwise without fault: he knows the Clergyman and <pb id="pg-30-34" n="30:34"/>Clergywoman; I also have got a notion where the place is,&#x2014;to the east side of Brighton: one of the airiest and healthiest regions. But it strikes me always, a <hi rend="italic">Lodging</hi> one could go to with comfort w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be less troublesome than a cottage.</p>
<p>I intend to come home by the <hi rend="italic">Steamer</hi> (there being no open 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi> class that I can hear of): Steamer starts from Ipswich on Saturday morning precisely at 8; gets to Blackwall (precisely?) at 4;&#x2014;home therefore, if all have gone well, about the usual time of dinner (towards 6, I should think); glad enough to be at rest again; such rest as home only can yield, home even in the clangour of London. Ah me, ah me! Mutton broth, I should think, w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not be unwelcome for dinner, if we come by the Steamer? But my poor little Dame will contrive it all right for me, broth or no broth.&#x2014; One reason that recommends the Steamer is that F. will hardly let me away <hi rend="italic">till Sunday</hi> if I think of rail; and surely Saturday will be better.</p>
<p>On Monday, as I think, you heard we were carried over hither; dim necessities acting upon Fitz, who had to shew all the talent of a consummate Pig-driver in getting things brought to the point he wished. The Parsonage is perfection&#x2019;s self in respect of quiet, cleanliness, rustic worth as a residence for the like of me: excellent people too, old Crabbe a character in his way, full of humanity, sociality, <hi rend="italic">opacity</hi> and <hi rend="italic">veracity</hi> strangely combined; his daughter quite a model of filial piety, and exact regard to all forms of truth from the multiplication table upwards:&#x2014;truly a desirable place. Nevertheless I lost a night&#x2019;s sleep by the job; miserable night that first Monday and miserable day following; however it is now all smooth, and I am as well or better both in health and in lodging, than at Farlingay, whither we return tomorrow, not to stir farther till Ipswich turn up. F. whirls me about long drives in his farmer&#x2019;s gig: today we went to see some notable mansion 8 or 9 miles off; notable Portrait of Oliver in it,&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">which</hi> proved worth nothing: but another Portrait, of the <hi rend="italic">Duke of Lauderdale</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Perhaps John Maitland (<date when="1616-00-00">1616</date>&#x2013;<sic><date when="1681-00-00">81</date></sic><corr><date when="1682-00-00">82</date>; <ref target="volume-30/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/17827"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref></corr>), 2d earl and 1st duke of Lauderdale, sec. for Scottish affairs, <date when="1660-00-00">1660</date>&#x2013;<date when="1680-00-00">80</date>, privy councillor.

<p>No news from you today,&#x2014;which I will take to mean that there is no bad news; all things remaining, with Goody, as they do with <hi rend="italic">Illy,</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >As opposed to &#x201C;Goody&#x201C;, i.e., TC himself.</note> in <hi rend="italic">statu quo</hi>.

Fitz has been the best of Landlords, and has discharged the sacred rites really with a kind of Irish zeal and piety. A man not to be forgotten. Today I saw his Brother, the Squire of Boulge:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John FitzGerald. Boulge is nr.

About 5&#xBD; p.m. if all go well tomorrow.</p>
<p>I wrote to Lord Ashburton about his Indian Speech:<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lord Monteagle had put the motion, <date when="1855-03-05">5 March</date>, to the Lords that all papers relating to correspondence for the <hi rend="italic">Report</hi> (of which Ashburton had been one of the authors) on the examination of candidates for the East India Company civil service (<date when="1854-11-00">Nov. 1854</date>; see <ref target="volume-29/lt-18550214-TC-LOA-01"><sic>29:259</sic><corr>TC to LOA, <date when="1855-02-14">14 Feb. 1855</date></corr></ref>) be laid before the House. Ashburton had replied: &#x201C;the speech of the noble Lord was a direct censure on the Committee &#x2026; ; for it would be a most severe imputation if it could be made out either that they intended to exclude natives from the covenanted service, or that they had so blundered as accidentally to bring about that result. There most assuredly was no intention to exclude the natives of India from the covenanted service of the Company&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Hansard</hi> 137:90).

<salute>Dear Sister,</salute>
<p>I have been in the country for a ten days, as perhaps you know; I was just about setting off when your Note arrived, which had been due, at least to my imagination, for a long while. I calculated confidently on answering you out of Suffolk; but that was what may be called &#x201C;reckoning <hi rend="italic">without</hi> one&#x2019;s landlord,&#x201C;&#x2014;I found my conveniences for writing, and my allowance of my own time and faculties, so inconsiderable as I had never once anticipated: I decided therefore on waiting till my return; and this, accordly,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> is the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> Letter I write after that event.</p>
<p>My place of rustication was Suffolk; some 8 or 9 miles nearer you than Ipswich, which County town is 70 or 80 miles off this; on a tide-river called the Orwell, perhaps ten miles from the real sea or German Ocean;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The North Sea.</note>&#x2014;much about my own distance from said Sea, for I lay northward of Ipswich, and <pb id="pg-30-37" n="30:37"/>within reach of another &#x201C;tidal river,&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Deben was estuarial and navigable for the last 8&#xBD; mi. from Woodbridge to the sea.</note> in which, at high-water, there was a tolerable salt water bathe to be had. I went to one Fitzgerald, an excellent modest and affectionate character, one of my oldest acquaintances in this part of the Earth: he is younger son of a gentleman of very great wealth who came to <hi rend="italic">bankruptcy</hi> nevertheless;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John FitzGerald was bankrupted when his Pendleton Colliery Co. failed, <date when="1848-00-00">1848</date>.</note> with such results as you may fancy: this Fitzg<hi rend="italic">d</hi> of mine, who is only just now, after 7 or 8 years after his father&#x2019;s death,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In fact, three years.</note> getting his affairs winded out into clearness and effectuality (he will still have plenty of money for a man of his simple ways), has been living, for some time past, with an old farmer of his Father&#x2019;s, in a kind of old <hi rend="italic">Villa,</hi> now used as farm house; the people greatly attached to him, and of honest rational character, they and their house likely to suit <hi rend="italic">me,</hi> as F. asserted, inviting me thither. Which indeed proved to be true; for I liked the goodwife and goodman extremely well after their fashion, &#x26; found the country and the farmhouse much to my taste,&#x2014;could I have but been &#x201C;well let alone&#x201D;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; William Graham&#x2019;s phrase; see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18351019-TC-JWC-01"><sic>8:231</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1835-10-19">19 Oct. 1835</date></corr></ref>.</note> (according to the bargain); but in that we did rather fail! Alas, that is a thing nowhere to be fallen in with,&#x2014;I think, never more, for me especially; such is often the sad sigh of my soul in late times! That country is now all golden with excellent wheat, plenty of green lanes too, endless country roads and paths, with trees everywhere <hi rend="italic">framing</hi> the gold picture in luxuriant green: a Country not unlike Scotland in its fruitfullest places, except that there are never <hi rend="italic">mountains</hi> in the distance, and that the streams are few, and all sedgy, silent, and we must say rather <hi rend="italic">ugly</hi>. I walked greatly, bathed every day, was driven to the sea-shore, to Aldborough, to Orford;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >12 mi. ENE of Woodbridge.</note> staid 3 days with the Poet Crabbe&#x2019;s son (a very excellent old Parson of those parts, who took much to me): in short I had no rest to the sole of my foot,&#x2014;none or too little;&#x2014;and was willing enough to get away from it yesterday, exactly on the 11<hi rend="italic">th</hi> day, for the chance of such quiet as home might afford. I preferred <hi rend="italic">Steamer</hi> to rail, and had really a pretty sail, tho&#x2019; too hot; but alas that meant 9 hours of sea instead of 3 by rail, and two hours more (by either method) of turmoil thro&#x2019; the entire length of London: so that I was really heartily tired,&#x2014;a fasting man from 6 a.m. till six p.m;&#x2014;and felt greatly relieved to get myself entirely washed, and treated to a plate of quiet <hi rend="italic">Scotch</hi> victual again. I calculate it will actually do me good, this jaunt; but on the other hand the quantity of tumble it has given me, and the dusty uproar of the entrance and the exit,&#x2014;all this is horrible to think of, and has <hi rend="italic">not</hi> belied my anticipations of it.&#x2014; &#x2014; I ought in fact to try to get on with my work again, if I by any means can or may; for really there is nothing else in this <pb id="pg-30-38" n="30:38"/>world that will turn out to be much of a prize for me, so far as my outlooks now go.</p>
<p>Among the rubbish of papers accumulated here in my absence, was the Falkirk Newspaper<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably the <hi rend="italic">Falkirk Herald,</hi> begun <date when="1845-00-00">1845</date>.</note> which I send by this post; containing a paper by some poor <hi rend="italic">wersh</hi> well-disposed creature; which has almost made me cry and laugh both at once to read it. Alas, alas!&#x2014; You will find it amuse you rather; therefore I send it, along with the <hi rend="italic">Leader</hi>. Parson Crabbe (very unwittingly) detained the last <hi rend="italic">Leader;</hi> but indeed there was little lost by that defect. The <hi rend="italic">Nation</hi> was intended to signify that nothing had gone wrong with me.</p>
<p>Jack speaks of going to Germany: if that can amuse him, it may be worth while, being easy for the like of him. He wrote to me once; but did not send much other news. I suppose he has been at Dumfries since. I sent him a Letter which came to me from Alick,&#x2014;which, I suppose, he has forwarded to you? It was short; and reported only that they were well and doing well, and that Tom, who had been to Hamilton under Hanning&#x2019;s patronage,<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >He worked in a flour mill (Marrs 719); see also <ref target="volume-29/lt-18550408-TC-AC-01"><sic>29:286</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1855-04-08">8 April</date></corr></ref>.</note> had decided to return, and was actually home again, after some trial of that. I do not well see thro&#x2019; this affair; hope only it will have created no grudge between Father and Son. It is perhaps very proper that Tom should wish to get away: but I do not know the particulars, and can only guess in the vague.</p>
<p>Your news from Glasgow, I hope, continues to be good: that exit of poor Tom from you was very affecting in his circumstances, poor fellow;&#x2014;however, we will hope it may be the beginning of many good things for him.<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Tom attended a school for the deaf in Glasgow; see <ref target="volume-29/lt-18541104-TC-JAC-01"><sic>29:186</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1854-11-04">4 Nov. 1854</date></corr></ref>.</note> He is possessed of excellent faculty, I judge; if it were once well cultivated, or opened to cultivation, there is no doubt he may find something useful to do in the world. God&#x2019;s blessing be on all of them, on all of us! That truly is the one prayer needful, now as in older times.</p>
<p>But I must cease, dear Jean; for there is no end to this kind of talk: and many things lie here, demanding quite another kind of industry from me. I hope I shall be perfectly rested; and be a little reconciled to my harness again when you write next. Give my autumnal compliments by Mr Aird, if you see him roving about at a slow or swift pace. My affectionate regards to James and all the little ones. Take care of yourself, that is what I have to remind <hi rend="italic">you</hi> of.</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Here is a Letter from your K&#xF6;then friend,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Julius Brunn. John Carlyle wrote from Scotsbrig, <date when="1855-08-27">27 Aug.</date>, that he would leave for Edinburgh, <date when="1855-08-29">29 Aug.</date>, &#x201C;to get several small things done,&#x201D; then travel to Hamburg to spend two or three weeks in Germany. His &#x201C;headquarters&#x201D; would be with &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Dr. Julius Brunn, Coethen,</hi> whose letter you forwarded last week.&#x201D; K&#xF6;then, N Germany, 12 mi. SW of Dessau and 50 mi. NNW of Leipzig.</note> which has just come to hand. If it relate to your German voyage, I ought to warn you, by my own sad experience, that in going from Leith<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Port for Edinburgh.</note> it is always necessary to inquire first, whether the Steamer is at all adapted for Passengers; whether it is not a trading vessel, loaded to the water&#x2019;s edge, and tumbling about in a way to sicken anything but a seahorse; with the adjuncts of grease, delay, and every species of discomfort to the human inhabitant? How it may be to Hamburg I do not know; but such it was to Rotterdam in my time: I found, for all reasons, <hi rend="italic">speed</hi> included, it would have been my clear course to go round by Hull, or even by London (which probably is the best route of all?) rather than depend upon Leith and its resources. From Hull, I understand, they have good Passenger ships: at Harwich<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Seaport in Suffolk, 20 mi. S of Ipswich.</note> I saw one good Steamer, which it seems gives you passage to and from, with an interval extending to three weeks; all for one guinea, as I was told:&#x2014;this however was a ship to <hi rend="italic">Antwerp,</hi> I think; how it may be with the Hamburg capabilities from this or other English harbours, I know not; but Tait or any of your stirring correspondents can learn: at all events you must not go <hi rend="italic">from Leith</hi> without investigating these preliminaries. I got home from Suffolk on Saturday night;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1855-08-18">18 Aug.</date></note> very much tired, having preferred to come by sea from Ipswich, which made a very nice sail, in a bright airy day, but occupied me 8 hours,&#x2014;or from quitting my breakfast at Farlingay to sitting down to my dinner at Chelsea, 6 a.m to 6 p.m., a space of 12 hours. I believe I shall be better for my rustication; but have not yet got <hi rend="italic">moored</hi> into smooth water altogether, to say distinctly how I am or may hope to be. This morning we were for Brighton; that is, Jane was, with Tait, whom I had undertaken to accompany (tho&#x2019; loth): but the morning proving showery, with a menace of steady wet (which is now going off about Noon), we <hi rend="italic">turned</hi> at London Bridge, and are here in our old quiet shop again. London is quite empty to <hi rend="italic">us;</hi> Suffolk was in the middle of its harvest,&#x2014;&#x201C;wheat fully and average.&#x201D; <closer><salute>My affection to all! /</salute></closer> <name>T.

<salute>Dear Fitzgerald,</salute>
<p>Here, after a good deal of bothering to improve it, above all to abridge it, is the proposed Inscription for the Pillar at Naseby.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >FitzGerald&#x2019;s father had erected an obelisk on the highest ground of the battlefield at Naseby, with an inscription regretting the royalist defeat, <date when="1645-06-14">14 June 1645</date>; see <ref target="volume-15/lt-18420918-TC-EF-01"><sic>15:89</sic><corr>TC to EF, <date when="1842-09-18">18 Sept. 1842</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-15/lt-18420929-TC-EF-01"><sic>110</sic><corr>TC to EF, <date when="1842-09-29">29 Sept. 1842</date></corr></ref>. TC had previously suggested an inscription for the grave that FitzGerald opened; see <ref target="volume-20/lt-18460408-TC-EF-01"><sic>20:162</sic><corr>TC to EF, <date when="1846-04-08">8 April 1846</date></corr></ref>.</note> You need not scruple a moment to make any change that strikes you; I am well aware it is good for nothing except its practical object, and that I have no skill in lapidary literature.</p>
<p>The worst thing will be, discovering the <hi rend="italic">date</hi> of your Naseby diggings.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1842-00-00">1842</date>; see <ref target="volume-15/lt-18420924-TC-EF-01"><sic>15:102</sic><corr>TC to EF, <date when="1842-09-24">24 Sept. 1842</date></corr></ref>.</note> I ought to have it here; and probably I have,&#x2014;in some remote dusty trunk, whither it is a terror to go looking for it! Try you what you can, and the Naseby Farmer too (if he is still extant); then I will try. At worst we can say &#x201C;Ten years ago&#x201D;; but the exact date would be better.</p>
<p>The figure of the stone ought to be of Egyptian simplicity: a broadish parallelopipedon (or rather <hi rend="italic">octaedron;</hi> the <hi rend="italic">corners</hi> well chamfered off, to avoid breakages, will make it 8-faced, I think); in the substance of the stone there is one quality to be looked for, durability; and the letters ought to be cut deep,&#x2014;and by no means in lapidary <hi rend="italic">lines</hi> (attend to that!); but simply like two <hi rend="italic">verses of the Bible,</hi> so that he who runs may read. I rather like the <hi rend="italic">Siste Viator,</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Stop traveller,&#x201D; a common Latin inscription.</note>&#x2014;yet will let you blot it out,&#x2014;it is as applicable as to any Roman Tomb, and more so than to ours, which are in enclosed places, where any &#x201C;Traveller,&#x201D; if he either &#x201C;stop&#x201D; or go, will presently have the constable upon him. This is all I have to say about the stone; and I recommend that it be now done straightway, before you quit hold of that troublesome locality.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The sale of the estate, Naseby Wooleys, Northamptonshire, was completed the following year. FitzGerald wrote to James Spedding, <date when="1855-08-23">23 Aug.</date>, that he was delaying his visit to London: &#x201C;I have my brother John here whom I want to keep steady about this Naseby Sale; and he talks of being off to Ireland next week&#x201D; (Terhune, <hi rend="italic">LEF</hi> 2:176).</note></p>
<p>I find I must not promise to myself to go thither with you; alas, nor at all. I cannot get to sleep again since I came out of Suffolk: the stilness<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> of Farlingay is unattainable in Chelsea for a <hi rend="italic">second</hi> sleep, so I have to be content with the first, which is oftenest about 5 hours, and a very poor allowance for the afflicted son of Adam. I feel privately confident I <hi rend="italic">have</hi> got good by my Suffolk visit, and by all the kindness of my beneficent brother mortals to me there: <pb id="pg-30-41" n="30:41"/>but in the meanwhile it has &#x201C;stirred up a good deal of bile,&#x201D; I suppose; and we must wait.</p>
<p>London is utterly vacant to me, of all but noises from Cremorne and such sources: there is not in Britain a better place for work than this Garret, if one had strength or heart for fronting work to any purpose. I try a little, but mostly with very small result.</p>
<p>If you know <hi rend="italic">Glyde</hi> of Ipswich, and can understand him to be really worth subscribing for, pray put down your name and mine, as a bit of duty;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >FitzGerald wrote TC, <date when="1855-08-26">26 Aug.</date>: &#x201C;I have sent &#x2026; to inquire about &#x2018;Glyde&#x2019; and will report to you in time.&#x201D; John Glyde, the younger, author of <hi rend="italic">The Moral, Social and Religious Condition of Ipswich in the Middle of the Nineteenth Century</hi> (Ipswich, <date when="1850-00-00">1850</date>), published with a list of subscribers; he was probably trying to find subscribers for his <hi rend="italic">Suffolk in the Nineteenth Century: Physical, Social, Moral, Religious and Industrial</hi> (Ipswich, <date when="1856-00-00">1856</date>). It was published without a list; he wrote about himself in it: &#x201C;Transferred at nine years of age from the school-room to the work-shop&#x2014;self-helped and self-guided in my progress to manhood&#x2014;launched into business before I arrived at maturity, I have had no opportunity to strive for the graces of composition&#x201D; (vii). The <hi rend="italic">Post Office Directory for Cambridge, Norfolk and Suffolk</hi> in <date when="1853-00-00">1853</date> listed him as &#x201C;hairdresser &#x26; perfumer &#x26; post office receiving house, St Matthew&#x2019;s street.&#x201D; By <date when="1858-00-00">1858</date>, he was listed as &#x201C;bookseller, stationer, circulating library, agent to Liverpool &#x26; London fire &#x26; life office, servants&#x2019; registry office &#x26; post office receiving house.&#x201D; His <date when="1850-00-00">1850</date> book also advertised his Nurses and Servants&#x2019; Institution (his registry office), his circulating library of &#x201C;Christian Literature,&#x201D; and his biblical and theological library for Suffolk.</note> if not, not,&#x2014;and burn his Letter.</p>
<p>I send the heartiest thanks, and remembrances to kind Mrs Smith, and all the industrious Harvesters; also to Papa and the young lady at Bredfield:&#x2014;as I well may!&#x2014; &#x2014; <closer><salute>I recommend myself to your prayers; and hope to come again, if I live, when you have set your own house in order.

<salute>Dear Neuberg,</salute>
<p>Your Letter has come this morning. I have never yet been to Addiscombe, nor anywhere but in this Garret and the environs; I am very sleepless, all this week, since my return from Suffolk; able <hi rend="italic">rightly</hi> to do nothing, tho&#x2019; weltering in these horrid masses of French and Teutonic <hi rend="italic">Dryasdustism</hi> (<foreign>wae&#x2019;s</foreign> me!)&#x2014;and incapable of any victorious resolution, even that of having a ride when it is offered me!</p>
<p>However, I have now written to Todhunter, to send his man down with the Horse to me (if he can spare the man) tomorrow morning; and failing that, to keep the Horse till Tuesday, before which time I will either bring him away myself, or say definitely that I do not want him.</p>
<p>We did <hi rend="italic">set off</hi> last Monday for Brighton; but the morning was wet; we turned again at London Bridge. What next Monday will so I do not know; but shall like as well if it take <hi rend="italic">me</hi> into silence, at Addiscombe, under the shadow of green trees.&#x2014; The Stationer people have never <hi rend="italic">sent</hi> their Paper; but it does not matter much hitherto.</p>
<p>I have been roving far and wide in <hi rend="italic">Voltairiana:</hi> French Editors, tho&#x2019; they <pb id="pg-30-43" n="30:43"/><hi rend="italic">have</hi> Indexes always of some sort, are still more intolerable than Prussian, for they have not the least conscience about being accurate,&#x2014;sorrow on them! There is no darker mass anywhere, with a varnish of regularity on the surface of it, than these Lives, Letters &#x26;c &#x26;c of Voltaire. What will become of me with this <hi rend="italic">double</hi> chaos, of Fritz and him? They are prettyish men both, if I <hi rend="italic">could</hi> get them extricated: but alas, alas!&#x2014;</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Your Letter has just come: I find you will be in Edinburgh tomorrow evening, and only for 24 hours; so I write immediately that I may still hit you there.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John wrote, <date when="14855-08-27">27 Aug.</date>, that he was to stay, <date when="1855-08-29">29 Aug.</date>, at &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Dr Hunter&#x2019;s, Middlefield-House, Portobello, Edin</hi>r.&#x201D;</note></p>
<p>There is nothing new with me, as good as nothing at all. The Brighton Cottage has gone to smoke,&#x2014;by my own movement, that, for Tait and Jane were both very lively about it. But I durst not, for my own part, have any concern practically with such a thing; my experience of the like has been too sad, or my heart is worn now <hi rend="italic">too weak</hi>. The <hi rend="italic">green timber</hi> of this apartment, and the other phenomena I then struggled with from <foreign><hi rend="italic">diese verdammte race</hi></foreign> [this damned race],<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Quoting Frederick; see <ref target="volume-29/lt-18550413-TC-AHE-01"><sic>29:288</sic><corr>TC to AHE, <date when="1855-04-13">13 April</date></corr></ref>.</note> have sunk heavy into me: <hi rend="italic">stava bene, per star meglio</hi> &#x26;c!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;It was well; but trying to be better, I find myself here!&#x201D;: an old epitaph; cf. <ref target="volume-18/lt-18440706-TC-JWC-01"><sic>18:109</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1844-07-06">6 July 1844</date></corr></ref>.</note> So the Cottage, and all cottages were renounced; and indeed had been before this Brighton was talked of. Monday morning gone a week, we did all set out, Jane, Tait and I, for London Bridge and Brighton; but the morning proving wet, we went no farther than the railway station; turned back there,&#x2014;one of us nothing loth, being quite unfit for more tumbling. Yesterday Jane executed the thing <hi rend="italic">herself,</hi> successfully; got a bathe, a stroll thro&#x2019; Brighton, was home again at 10&#xBD; p.m., not so much <hi rend="italic">improved,</hi> as by a former expedition of the kind,&#x2014;it turns out today.</p>
<p>As to me I have been quite sleepless, disconsolate &#x26; good for little [or]<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Omitted by TC.</note> nothing, ever since Suffolk; only lately have I begun to get round again. I suppose the travel, change and agitation, jumbles all the <hi rend="italic">sediment</hi> up; and one is worse for the moment, tho&#x2019; actually tending to a little melioration in time. Neuberg, down to Hastings, offered me his horse above a week ago; I could not be bothered actually taking it till it was half-forced on me last Sunday: I then rode to Addiscombe, and back after 3 hours silence and reading there; a beautiful quiet ride, which together with yesterday&#x2019;s d<hi rend="italic">o</hi> has done me a marked benefit. Last night, a sleep of 8 hours all in a piece: nothing like it for many months past. I will certainly keep this good little Animal till N<hi rend="italic">g</hi> need him again: he is well worth his victuals to me at that rate. Addiscombe too itself, nearly the prettiest place I ever saw, is open to us, horse and all, and we might have a gig &#x26;c &#x26;c: but owing to botherations, partly of a most insignificant kind, I fear there will no good whatever be got of <pb id="pg-30-45" n="30:45"/>that;&#x2014;and in fact I wish it were all <hi rend="italic">settled,</hi> one way or the <hi rend="italic">other;</hi> as I anticipate, it will be, in the course of this week. House-maid cannot &#x201C;cook,&#x201D; this thing &#x201C;cannot&#x201D; and that thing &#x201C;cannot&#x201C;: it is really rather curious to see to what a pass things have reached in this universally &#x201C;emancipated&#x201D; world!&#x2014; However, I can do with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> more country, if more is not to be had; this excell<hi rend="italic">t</hi> little Horse will itself do me good, in the solitary rotten-rows and rides I can have here;&#x2014;and with a little increase of strength, perhaps I shall be able to push my unspeakable Fritz Operation forward,&#x2014;and <hi rend="italic">so</hi> assert myself against all men and devils once more in some small measure; which will be a great comfort indeed!&#x2014;</p>
<p>If you find the Leith Steamer actually right, of course it is of no use undertaking new travel on this side of the water: if not, you will probably be driven on London; in which case a vacant room waits you here. We are sure not to be <hi rend="italic">both</hi> in Addiscombe; most likely <hi rend="italic">neither;</hi> and at any time I and my Horse could be back in an hour and half.</p>
<p>You will get to C&#xF6;then by Steamer up the Elbe so far,&#x2014;or perhaps by rail all the way? German river steamers are far the best of the kind I ever tried; your <hi rend="italic">view</hi> too is worth getting, and to be had there <hi rend="italic">alone</hi> by the modern methods of travelling. The country in that part of Germany has nothing of the picturesque, I believe; yet it is historical and worth seeing. If your Steamer bring you by the <hi rend="italic">Southern</hi> channels of the Elbe, you will in the first hour from Hamburg, see <hi rend="italic">Harburg,</hi> for instance (beginning of L&#xfc;neburg Heath, which I have often heard of in reference to George I and his Mother-in-law<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Eleanora, duchess of Brunswick-L&#xfc;neberg-Celle, b. d&#x2019;Olbreuze, Huguenot; mother of Sophie Dorothea, m. to George Lewis (<date when="1660-00-00">1660</date>&#x2013;<date when="1727-00-00">1727</date>), later George I of Britain; see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 12:411&#x2013;12. L&#xfc;neburg is S of Hamburg.</note>); L&#xfc;neburg Heath is worth looking at on one hand, Mecklenburg-Schwerin<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 18:360.</note> on the other. But indeed the river does not offer much therabouts; and except Tangerm&#xfc;nde (<hi rend="italic">old</hi> residence of the Hohenzollern and prior Chiefs of Brandenburg) I remember nothing I should care much to see, all the way to Magdeburg,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 12:114. Magdeburg is a city on the Elbe in Saxony-Anhalt, SW of Berlin.</note>&#x2014;whither you come by rail, much sooner doubtless; and thence home to C&#xF6;then in a couple of hours. Your travellings out from that, when once you are rested, will depend on circumstances. I conclude you will not neglect Dessau (Old Dessauer&#x2019;s place, Wallenstein at the Bridge of Dessau &#x26;c,<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Leopold I, prince of Anhalt-Dessau (<date when="1676-00-00">1676</date>&#x2013;<date when="1747-00-00">1747</date>), called the Old Dessauer.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Your Letter came to us a week or two ago; very welcome, as all tidings from you always are. I read it; sent it on to Jack (who was then at Scotsbrig), by whom it was communicated to the rest of the kindred. You must not neglect to write to us, to me in particular; so long as I live in this world, you may be always sure of one fellow-creature to whom nothing that befals you can be indifferent. We are all getting old now, I oldest; and must try to keep one another company, to cheer, and participate with, one another, the best we can. I must say, looking back, my Brothers and you as the nearest to me have been a great comfort to my pilgrimage, one way and another. Nothing that has been given me in life deserves better to be reckoned as a blessing and possession. For which let us piously thank the All-bountiful! Many Households, of <hi rend="italic">less</hi> apparent capability, have gained far more promotion in this rather scurvy epoch of the world than our Father&#x2019;s Household has: of which we will make no complaint at all; nay probably we should take that also as a <hi rend="italic">blessing,</hi> and silently thank God for it (really and truly so):&#x2014;but in all our ups and downs we have loved one another; yes; and surely all the yellow metal of California and all the foul puffs of Newspapers now going, are but poor &#x201C;wealth&#x201D; in comparison to that!&#x2014; I often think of these things: but perhaps it is good to <hi rend="italic">know</hi> them, without speaking much about them.</p>
<p>We had heard of Tom&#x2019;s shifting into Hamilton;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-30/lt-18550819-TC-JCA-01">TC to JCA, <date when="1855-08-19">19 Aug.</date></ref></note> we of course did not know the details; but reckoned in general that it might be a natural and even proper endeavour and wish, on the part of the young fellow, to cut out some road for himself in the world; and hoped it might answer;&#x2014;which it appears not to have done. Poor Tom; I remember him well, stepping gallantly thro&#x2019; the Burn at Scotsbrig with Letters for us; invincible by wet or difficulty of way, tho&#x2019; then hardly three feet high! I calculate always he has grown to be a sturdy fellow,&#x2014;perhaps with a good deal of <hi rend="italic">temper</hi> in him, which he should keep a severe and steady bridle over,&#x2014;but I hope, with many capabilities, with various developed ingenuities; and, now and henceforth (I hope most of all), with a steady <hi rend="italic">veracity</hi> and integrity of mind, like those that have gone before him under the same name! Be good to him, poor fellow; for he will naturally feel chagrined at this disappointment; and find his old place not quite the <hi rend="italic">same</hi> after coming back to it on those terms. You must sympathise with him, even if you had your irritations at first; you must really consider what is <hi rend="italic">fair</hi> in the unrest he has manifested; and let him have the benefit of his Father&#x2019;s <pb id="pg-30-49" n="30:49"/>longer experience to guide him <hi rend="italic">cannily</hi> towards some good issue if you can. He is of course totally unacquainted with the ground, which lies all as a pathless jungle round him; and yet his wish to get into some wider field of activity may be quite the reverse of <hi rend="italic">wrong</hi> on his part. The total <hi rend="italic">want</hi> of such a feeling, in a young man so situated: this, for anything I know, would have been a far worse fault, and perhaps a disgraceful and unpardonable one.</p>
<p>I know you will pardon me for speaking about this; which mere affection and anxiety prompt me to do, tho&#x2019; I am very ignorant about it, and speaking mainly into the air. I will only add therefore, that if you and the other Boys<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >He had five other sons, the youngest b. <date when="1851-00-00">1851</date>.</note> are really adequate to the labour of Bield, it were perhaps well to think seriously (seriously, tho&#x2019; perhaps in secret) of establishing Tom in some other way. And if an opening of any kind, which you think reasonable and which he likes, do occur,&#x2014;then I think I may answer for Jack and myself (for <hi rend="italic">one</hi> of the two I can completely answer), we should not be backward in assisting such a work, according to means and opportunity. That is a certain fact;&#x2014;and that is perhaps the only thing I had a clear right to say. And I will and do request you to bear it in mind, when the occasion rises. And that really is <hi rend="italic">all</hi> I had to say, and the <hi rend="italic">end</hi> of that head of my discourse.</p>
<p>London is utterly empty (that is, this west quarter of it, or those we know in it) at this August season: the air is often very clear and good; and certainly for &#x201C;retirement&#x201D; there are few places equal to it. The straggling individuals that do continue, even these seem to make a tacit rule of <hi rend="italic">ignoring</hi> one another; and one is called upon by nobody, calls upon nobody. Sometimes, when the wind falls dead for a few days and the hot sky is cloudless (which has not been much the case this year), the streets get villainously <hi rend="italic">baked,</hi> an unwholesome stew of bad breath coming out of every cellar and grocer&#x2019;s shop; so that Town-life, all imbedded in impalpable <hi rend="italic">dust</hi> from so many wheeled vehicles withal, reaches its disagreeablest figure; and one is glad of rain and thunder again, which is pretty sure not to be far off. I had some thoughts of poor old Scotland this year; but they are gone again; the old scenes at any rate, as you may guess, are not the joyfullest to me just now. Jack, with his two Boys<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Arthur and William, the two youngest.</note> in vacation from school, went to Scotsbrig in july or june; he has been there ever since, his Boys till the beginning of this month,&#x2014;he, I believe, is leaving it this very day, as happens. Poor fellow, he makes a <hi rend="italic">business</hi> out of guardian-ing these poor Boys (to which post he has been appointed by Chancery, with plenty of money); he writes, travels &#x26;c &#x26;c, and fills his time, to some satisfaction, with it. Which is pathetic to look upon, poor fellow, and yet a kindly aspect of this world&#x2019;s destinies. There is not one of us so capable of finding interest for himself, out of next to nothing, as he. &#x201C;From the youngest to the <pb id="pg-30-50" n="30:50"/><hi rend="italic">ouldest</hi> there&#x2019;s none of them so much resembles&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Quoting Alick.</note>&#x2014;No, you were wrong in that part of the account at any rate! He is far the <hi rend="italic">happiest</hi> of the family I do believe; and it would be so easy for a grumbling discontented unhealthy nature to pick holes without and in the life he has had. I often look at him poor fellow, and his head (six years younger than mine) now old and utterly grey, with a tender and wondering feeling. He has a great deal of superior intellect running waste, and yielding no adequate crop at all; that is the worst of it: but that is nothing like the worst of <hi rend="italic">bads</hi> in this world, among the outcomes of human lives! He and I never have any cross word now; for I have long since recognised that rebuking of him is of no use; that Nature is stronger than any argument against Nature; and that my poor Jack is even <hi rend="italic">made</hi> so, and might have been infinitely worse made. &#x201C;Ungrateful, how could he have been better made!&#x201D; I often say to myself. He is a truly loving Brother; and from me has forgiven innumerable provocations, and superficial irritations from an old date!</p>
<p>Today, as I said, he is leaving Scotsbrig; bound by rail towards Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> and Leith, where he takes Steamer for Hamburg in Germany. The eldest of his Boys<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Tom. Henry was the second boy.</note> (there are four of them in all) is in some kind of rigorous disciplinary School in Hamburg, having been a <hi rend="italic">baddish</hi> boy at one time, and in violent quarrel with his Mother, owing perhaps to misguidance mainly: he is now doing much better; getting to be 17 or 18, I think, withal: and Jack is going across to have a personal survey of his affairs and him. Which will do good, I have little doubt; or will at least be satisfactory to poor Jack&#x2019;s feelings in the matter. He has there an acquaintance, an old Roman <hi rend="italic">Medical</hi> comrade, established in a little Town some 200 miles inland:<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. Julius Brunn in K&#xF6;then.</note> him he proposes next to visit, and to look at various things in the adjacency or in the distance (Weimar, probably among others); in this way he means to make a three-weeks tour of it: which may be pleasant enough in this fine season. You will see by my strokes on the Newspaper (if I continue the two strokes) that nothing is gone wrong with him that I hear of; till he himself write again. I suppose he is likely to come home this way, and to anchor here again for winter, but he does not say hitherto. He sails tomorrow ev<hi rend="italic">g,</hi> Thursday 30 August.&#x2014; Jamie appears to have a fair harvest, tho&#x2019; <hi rend="italic">late,</hi> as all harvests this year. Farmers are prospering beyond wont: I privately suppose it is from the California gold in some measure:<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Found in <date when="1848-00-00">1848</date>.</note>&#x2014;Jamie keeps very busy, and steadily improves his footing, and at a slow rate seems to do better and better. Jean at Dumfries, poor thing, is looking forward not without anxiety to an Event which ought now to be near <pb id="pg-30-51" n="30:51"/>hand: the Doctors say there is no cause for apprehension; but her last two births have been of dead children, and all precautions surely are prescribed in such a case. Of the Austins I hear good accounts too. And that is the general <hi rend="italic">bulletin</hi> from Annandale. Poor old Graham<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Graham.</note> has no illness, but sinks duller &#x26; duller.</p>
<p>As to myself I have had and still have a fearful tussle with that sad Book of mine,&#x2014;which is yet far, far from being off my hands:&#x2014;never in my life had I an uglier job; a sore year of hard labour, last, and almost <hi rend="italic">without</hi> result, as I often think. But it is not so either: by and by, if I live, I shall get thro&#x2019; that adventure too; and I think it ought to be my last of the kind.&#x2014; My health <hi rend="italic">feels</hi> often miserably bad; and yet <hi rend="italic">is</hi> not so: nothing ails me still <hi rend="italic">except</hi> perpetual indigestion, and that could be greatly relieved if I had a healthier <hi rend="italic">trade;</hi> my trade chiefly causes that. We have run down to the shore once or twice (by cheap trains and otherwise) and got a bathe or two; I have a horse at present lent me: tomorrow we are going to Addiscombe, a <hi rend="italic">lent</hi> country house some ten miles off, for a little while. All this it is calculated will sensibly help.&#x2014; <closer><salute>Paper done, my dear Brother; I must say <foreign>Adieu</foreign>!&#x2014;</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>Dear Jean,&#x2014;</salute>I had a Letter yesterday from John, inclosing one of yours; very welcome to me, there being rather a dearth of news lately. He says your Doctor assures him, and his own judgement corroborates, there is no special cause for apprehension at all in your case;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John did not say this; he mentioned only that Dr. Adam had gone &#x201C;last week to Hexham for a few days.&#x201D; It was Jean who said in her letter to John, <date when="1855-08-25">25 Aug.</date> (enclosed by John, <date when="1855-08-27">27 Aug.</date>): &#x201C;I am as well as I was when you saw me Dr Adam has not yet returned &#x2026; but I should not mind <hi rend="italic">very</hi> much if I had even to apply to Dr Blacklock in his absence w<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is not likely&#x201D; (MS: NLS 1775B.166). For both doctors and the birth, see <ref target="volume-30/lt-18550926-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1855-09-26">26 Sept.</date></ref></note> but naturally you are anxious, naturally we are all so, and wish you had your task well over. Keep up your heart; take every care of yourself: and let us hope, and not fear!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I am rather getting round again from my Suffolk tumble; which has kept me, till two days ago, steadily <hi rend="italic">below</hi> par, rather than above it, as the calculation was. I can settle to no work, however; but am clearing off old scores, of Letters &#x26;c; I cannot find the <hi rend="italic">handle</hi> of my ugly mass of confusions again, or know yet where best to begin. Neuberg, most obliging of German (or Jewish) men, who <hi rend="italic">copies</hi> and does everything for me this long while, has lent me his <pb id="pg-30-52" n="30:52"/>Horse (being himself absent): an excellent swift little animal, which has done me more good than all the College of Physicians could; I have had 3 or 4 long rides upon it, and hope to have about a dozen more. Further we are going out to Addiscombe tomorrow; where Jane, I think after <hi rend="italic">starting</hi> matters fairly, will <hi rend="italic">leave</hi> me, with my Horse and some Paper and Books for company: I calculate on getting some good there,&#x2014;for it is one of the quietest, as well as nearly the beautifullest, of all Country places: nothing but a Housemaid and a Gardener in it just now. There I can stay, or even come and go, for a couple of weeks; and <hi rend="italic">consider</hi> myself withal, which may be one real advantage. I wrote to Jack for this evening, when he is to arrive in Edin<hi rend="italic">r;</hi> sails (if all be right tomorrow (Thursday) Evening. His tour is rather inviting,&#x2014;at least to a man that can <hi rend="italic">sleep,</hi>&#x2014;for a 3 weeks of this weather.&#x2014;Do not bother yourself writing to me, unless it is convenient in your weak state; I will let you know from time to time all the same. <closer><salute>And God bless you, dear Sister, you and all your Household.&#x2014;</salute></closer> <name>T.

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Thanks for your Letter;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1855-08-26">26 Aug.</date></note> thanks for all your kindness to me. I shall never forget Bredfield Rectory, but always remember it among the peculiar habitations of mortals in this Earth. A very beautiful and memorable little restingplace in one&#x2019;s pilgrimage thro&#x2019; the desert here below!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Today I send you a Book, which I hope you will be able to read by and by; at all events the sight of it is to bring you in mind of me now and then. The Book is of no value here; nor likely to be of much <hi rend="italic">there,</hi>&#x2014;tho&#x2019; written by your late Bishop&#x2019;s son,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Arthur Penrhyn Stanley (<date when="1815-00-00">1815</date>&#x2013;<date when="1881-00-00">81</date>; <ref target="volume-30/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/26259"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), liberal theologian; fellow of University Coll., Oxford, <date when="1838-00-00">1838</date>&#x2013;<date when="1850-00-00">50</date>, canon of Canterbury, <date when="1851-00-00">1851</date>; he was the son of Edward Stanley (<date when="1779-00-00">1779</date>&#x2013;<date when="1849-00-00">1849</date>), bishop of Norwich; apparently TC sent <hi rend="italic">The Life of Thomas Arnold,</hi> 2 vols.

This Life of Arnold made an extraordinary change in popular opinions or rather their treatment. It changed the tone if not the mind of Bigotry.&#x201D;</note> if that is any merit;&#x2014;but I send it nevertheless, or rather let it <hi rend="italic">fall</hi> to you, whither it tends as if by the very law of gravitation. Attached, chiefly by way of wrappage, is a N<hi rend="italic">o</hi> of some German Magazine, which may serve Miss Crabbe for a Lesson, when she wants a bit of plain prose; otherwise it is worth nothing.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Crabbes were also sent the photograph requested in <ref target="volume-30/lt-18550817-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1855-08-17">17 Aug.</date>, as Crabbe wrote, <date when="1855-08-31">31 Aug.</date></ref>: &#x201C;I will only say one, two, three words.

<p><closer><salute>You are to give my very kind regards and grateful respects to Miss Crabbe; whom, for her own and her Father&#x2019;s and her Grandfather&#x2019;s sake, I am not like to forget either;&#x2014;and so I will remain, wishing and auguring all good to Bredfield,</salute></closer></p>

<p>My poor little Jeannie is away! You may fancy (or rather perhaps in your spleen you will not fancy) what a dreary <foreign><hi rend="italic">wae</hi></foreign> sight it was to me this morning when I sallied out, stupid and sad, and found your door <hi rend="italic">open;</hi> the <hi rend="italic">one</hi> cup down stairs, teapot washed out: &#x201C;Mrs Carlyle gone at 8, Sir; don&#x2019;t know whither; had not slept at all&#x201D;; alas, alas!&#x2014;I know not even whether you had got any breakfast: it did not strike me then to question my <hi rend="italic">Hyaena</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly Mrs. Wenham; see <ref target="volume-30/lt-18550912-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1855-09-12">12 Sept.</date></ref></note> farther on that subject; and it now rather strikes me you probably had <hi rend="italic">none</hi>.

Well I hope you <hi rend="italic">are</hi> now asleep in your own safe big-curtained old bed; in all ways you <hi rend="italic">can</hi> now stretch yourself out!</p>
<p>I have had the loneliest day I can recollect in all my life, or almost the very loneliest. I declined riding (my horse had need of rest at any rate; the wind was howling and the dust flying; and on all my nerves lay dull embargo, only to be lifted by <hi rend="italic">hard</hi> labour): I set out soon after 1; walked over heaths, thro&#x2019; thick woods, in solitary places, with the huge <hi rend="italic">sough</hi> of the wind, and a grey troublous sky, for company, about 3&#xBD; hours;&#x2014;did not weary, did not much improve; sat smoking once with a bush at my back on a hill side (name indiscoverable) by the edge of a wood; got home 5 minutes before five; and the punctual Dragon<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Perhaps Mrs. Atchison, the housekeeper; see <ref target="volume-23/lt-18480407-JWC-TC-01"><sic>23:8</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1848-04-07">7 April 1848</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-23/lt-18480614-JWC-LA-01"><sic>49</sic><corr>JWC to LA, <date when="1848-06-14">14 June 1848</date></corr></ref>.</note> was there with the dinner you had ordered.

<salute>Dear Hannay,</salute>
<p>Some short time ago I received a Circular, with Mr Whitty&#x2019;s signature, on the same subject as your Note; and was well pleased to learn that such a project was in agitation on behalf of Duffy,&#x2014;to which I wished all success very sincerely, tho&#x2019; myself unable to take part in it.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The proposal to hold a public dinner for Gavan Duffy before he left. Duffy says that when he decided to emigrate to Australia some of his friends remonstrated, but Edward Whitty &#x201C;declared I was right, and that he would go with me. &#x2026; I entreated Whitty &#x2026; to go &#x2026; only after I had made some footing there&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">My Life in Two Hemispheres</hi> 2:107). Edward Michael Whitty (<date when="1827-00-00">1827</date>&#x2014;<date when="1860-00-00">60</date>; <ref target="volume-30/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/29334"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), journalist; he wrote the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>&#x2019;s parliamentary summary, <date when="1846-00-00">1846</date>&#x2013;<date when="1849-00-00">49</date>, and wrote for the <hi rend="italic">Leader</hi> for several years. The <hi rend="italic">Examiner,</hi> <date when="1855-09-08">8 Sept.</date>, also reprinted an article praising Duffy from the <hi rend="italic">Liverpool Journal</hi> (owned by Whitty&#x2019;s father, M. J. Whitty [<date when="1795-00-00">1795</date>&#x2013;<date when="1873-00-00">1873</date>; <ref target="volume-30/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/29335"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>]): &#x201C;With him goes out of this empire the last of Young Ireland. It completes the exodus which leaves Ireland as much of an English province as is Lancashire.&#x201D; The dinner was planned for <date when="1855-10-16">16 Oct.</date>, but in a letter to the dinner committee (<hi rend="italic">Times,</hi> <date when="1855-10-13">13 Oct.</date>) Duffy said that as &#x201C;the first man among us, Frederick Lucas&#x201D; was on his deathbed (he died <date when="1855-10-22">22 Oct.</date>) it was not &#x201C;fit or permissible to hold a public festival&#x201D; and that he wished the farewell dinner to &#x201C;be abandoned as a token of respect and sympathy toward him.&#x201D;</note> I have a real regard and <pb id="pg-30-55" n="30:55"/>even affection for Duffy, whose fine truthful intellect and ardent humane character were always recognisable to me, in the worst tumult of Irish confusions. His course there, which I never could applaud for wisdom, nor rebuke without pity and respect, has all along seemed to me one of the most tragical;&#x2014;and truly it has been troublous enough, tumbling in the wake of that monster of Blarney, Big O and his &#x201C;justice for Ireland&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Daniel O&#x2019;Connell (<date when="1775-00-00">1775</date>&#x2013;<date when="1847-00-00">1847</date>; see <ref target="volume-17/lt-18430816-TC-EF-01"><sic>17:51</sic><corr>TC to EF, <date when="1843-08-16">16 Aug. 1843</date></corr></ref>), Irish political leader; detested by TC for encouraging dissension and promising repeal of the Act of Union knowing it was impossible.</note> (the ugliest Imposter generated in my time),&#x2014;and, alas, it <hi rend="italic">ends</hi> in a sufficiently mournful manner, tho&#x2019; in a manful and pathetic one on my poor friend Duffy&#x2019;s part!&#x2014; I would gladly go and testify these feelings on his behalf, whenever it might be useful or suitable: but, on the other hand, I can perceive this Dinner will not be the place for me to do it; but for others differently related to it than I, and who probably have somewhat other feelings to express. In short, there are multifarious reasons admonishing absence on my part,&#x2014;two reasons were there no others: Permanent wish to steer clear to windward of O&#x2019;Connellism, and of Anti-d<hi rend="italic">o,</hi> in all their branches; and 2<hi rend="italic">dly,</hi> the horror and misery I undergo in all &#x201C;Public Dinners&#x201D; whatsoever! I pray you therefore let me be excused, and be believed at the same time to wish the Enterprise heartily well, as I do.</p>
<p>About a week ago, after some little movements elsewhither, I came out to this place, in the hope of shaking some of the accumulated <hi rend="italic">dust</hi> out of me, by silence and industrious riding and walking in the solitary lanes and woods;&#x2014;which I am diligently endeavouring, for perhaps yet another ten days. After which I am at home in permanence; and shall hope to see you again, the first time you can get so far.</p>

<salute>Dear Neuberg,</salute>
<p>I ought to tell you what has become of your faithful steed and me. I rode about in the environs of London twice or thrice with the nimble little animal, greatly to my pleasure and advantage, for a day or two; then, on Thursday last, things being all brought to bear, I trotted out hither in the breezy twilight (Mrs C. coming by rail); and have been here ever since, in the most complete <pb id="pg-30-56" n="30:56"/>retirement, generally in a state of solitude to which only La Trappe,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Where Cistercian Trappist monks were first established; see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18330907-TC-JWC-01"><sic>6:432</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1833-09-07">7 Sept. 1833</date></corr></ref>.</note> if even that, could offer any parallel. For my wife, having initiated the <hi rend="italic">m&#xE9;nage</hi> here, went away again; only returns once in the few days to keep the <hi rend="italic">commissariat</hi> department straight, and prefers for her own behoof the resources of Chelsea: so that I have free scope for <hi rend="italic">silence,</hi> as ever man had; and literally converse with nobody except the little Horse, and my own thoughts if I have any, and my own sensations which I am sure to have. The lanes and old country roads, old as Hengst<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hengist (d. <date when="488-00-00">?488</date>), legendary leader of the first Anglo-Saxon settlers in Britain.</note> many of them, are very pretty, the Heaths still green as an emerald; a county of corn and grass and wood,&#x2014;Croydon was once a place for Charcoal, the &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Colliers</hi> of Croydon&#x201D; a phrase in old Books, and venerable stumps of oaks are still frequent, and in general there is still a profusion of wood. Being quite <hi rend="italic">new</hi> to country and to riding, I enjoy the phenomena not a little; and will continue my riding for a while longer if I do not hear the Horse is wanted. Poor little quadruped, he carries me beautifully (the Farmer very good to him here in return); he trots along when the ways are sandy; walks or paces when the small pebbles abound, and joyfully canters when we get upon the sward of Heaths with the wind in our faces. An excellent sagacious useful little creature;&#x2014;willing to contribute all <hi rend="italic">he</hi> can (even as his Owner is) to getting forward with that dreadful enterprise of Frederick the Great; if by any means, taking it in front or in flank or in rear, we could contrive to do some good upon it! I keep the thing in abeyance altogether just now; which may be considered a taking it in flank or in rear,&#x2014;if not an abandoning of it altogether; which I am still sometimes tempted to resolve upon. In all my days I have been in no such sordid whirlpool of dancing <hi rend="italic">sand,</hi> where I had no business to be: on the whole there is but one question, How to get out again?</p>
<p>All my leisure time, when not walking or riding, is taken up with <hi rend="italic">Voltaire,</hi> of whose works there is an excell<hi rend="italic">t</hi> edition here; far the best I have ever seen (<hi rend="italic">Renouard&#x2019;s,</hi> in above 60 volumes, Paris <date when="1819-00-00">1819</date>,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Oeuvres compl&#xE8;tes de Voltaire,</hi> ed.

<salute>My dear Jean,</salute>
<p>You will take a little word from me, in defect of more; and not grudge to learn how I am going on here. Your <hi rend="italic">Scotsman</hi> Newspaper arrived yesterday morning, and brought you direct into my sight again. This morning comes the <hi rend="italic">Courier;</hi> which has got itself readdressed for Canada without being much looked into.</p>
<p>I think I told you it was on Thursday Ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi> last week that we came out hither; Jane by rail, I riding privately on a nice little Ho<supplied>[r]</supplied>se<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> Neuberg had lent me. We arrived within few minutes of each other; got fire raised, lights kindled, excellent tea made; and the business fairly started. Jane had several arrangements and negociations, next day,&#x2014;idle truck of Housemaids &#x26;c, &#x201C;unable altogether to <hi rend="italic">cook,</hi>&#x201C;&#x2014;but she settled it all with her customary <hi rend="italic">glegness;</hi> and seeing the thing now fairly in motion, went off home again on the Sunday morning preferring Chelsea with its resources of company and the like to these vacant solitudes: indeed she had slept very ill poor soul; and could hardly get any right sleep here at all in spite of the dead silence. She has been out again to see how my affairs were going on; staid only a night; will return when my <hi rend="italic">provisions</hi> threaten to run low, and procure me more,&#x2014;probably about monday next. Poor little soul! She has a heavyish burden too in this world, but struggles along with wonderful toughness, and does not in general make complaint about it.</p>
<p>There is store of Books here; some Books belonging to my <hi rend="italic">work,</hi> which I use this opportunity of consulting or reconsulting: no limits to my <hi rend="italic">reading</hi> if I incline to go on that tack. But riding and exercise I esteem to be the real problem; I ride between two and three hours every day, thro&#x2019; beautiful silent country roads and lanes, well shaded with trees, yellow stubble on this hand of me and on that, intermixed with green meadows (getting <hi rend="italic">mown</hi> a second time, summer hay having been so scant), and leading out into queer old straggling brick hamlets, and beautiful expanses of wild green, where my horse is willing to stretch himself into a bit of gallop. My solitude is total; my <pb id="pg-30-58" n="30:58"/>thoughts are manifold,&#x2014;not by any means all of a joyful nature! Ah no: last time I was here, there was one subject of anxiety which has now fallen quite to rest; I think of that, and of all manner of cognate objects, with a strange tenacity, a strange <hi rend="italic">exclusiveness,</hi>&#x2014;as if Death and Eternity were the one great fact of this Universe; which, in a sense, they are. I do not weep any more these many long years: but there are thoughts that far exceed tears in sadness. Let us stand to our work, and see that our work is honest: there is no other remedy; and that, under Heaven&#x2019;s goodness, is remedy enough.</p>
<p>Jack was to sail, as you know, on Saturday ev<hi rend="italic">g;</hi> to be in Hamburg on Tuesday morning, if all went right. I fear he must have got windy weather, but I think too there could be nothing worse than a good fit of sea-sickness for him in it, and this might be no mischief in the end. I hope we shall hear of him still perhaps within the week.&#x2014; &#x2014; Keep yourself quiet, dear Jean; and be of good heart. My affectionate regards to James and all the rest. <closer><salute>Ever your Brother</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I suppose you very busy with your harvest, in this fine September weather; and try to flatter myself in general, tho&#x2019; without any express news since John went away, that you are all going on in something like the old way. My special reason for writing today (in considerable haste), is to tell you that John has accomplished his Sea-voyage, and is now safe <hi rend="italic">in</hi> Germany,&#x2014;gone indeed <hi rend="italic">beyond</hi> the mark he was aiming at, having found the railways suit better for going to Berlin <hi rend="italic">first</hi>. He writes to me, dating these on Sunday last; &#x201C;very muddy,&#x201D; he says, from the boisterous voyaging; but intending to &#x201C;walk about&#x201D; in that big City for a day or two, and compose himself before going farther. He has Scotch people there, old acquaintances who came over in the Steamer with him; plenty of old <hi rend="italic">Roman</hi> acquaintances living in Berlin, if he like to go in quest of them: Coethen, whither he is bound, is an easy day&#x2019;s railwaying (100 miles or so) to the rear of him, a little <hi rend="italic">south</hi> of the road he has come: he will go thither, in the first place, having &#x201C;warned&#x201D; his friend &#x26;c &#x26;c; and then look about him afterwards as he likes. He says he accomplished his business in Hamburg<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Where Thomas Watt was at school.</note> to his satisfaction; adding no other particular about that. This is all his history since he left you. His Letter did not reach me till <pb id="pg-30-60" n="30:60"/>last night. I was very glad to see it; for tho&#x2019; I could not think there was any danger, yet the weather having been so very windy (in these parts too) while he was at sea, and the Letter delaying a little beyond what had been expected, I was very glad when Jane brought it me last night, and put all to composure in that quarter. I have written to Jean at Dumfries, and by the same post I send you this. If Mary know about the thing at all, you can let her know about this result by some easy method.</p>
<p>I came out to this place, of which I dare say you have heard before, some ten days ago or more, for the sake of a little country and solitude; and have been here here<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> without interval ever since, enjoying both these blessings,&#x2014;with the addition of a horse too, on which, in this fine bright weather, I accomplish a great deal of pleasant solitary riding, over the &#x201C;Heaths&#x201D; (as they call them, tho&#x2019; they are green open spaces, hundreds of acres, with only low <hi rend="italic">whins, brackens,</hi> brambles juniper bushes where the ground is not perfectly smooth and bitten bare, oftenest not a twig of <hi rend="italic">heather</hi> to be seen on them): there is such a &#x201C;Heath&#x201D; or Common, at every parish Church, and innumerable intricate lanes, all green and leafy, diving thro&#x2019; woods, winding by solitary farms, lead variously from one Heath to another; not a soul to be seen in them either, about this time: so that there is no end to pleasant rides. I go out daily about 2; and take sometimes near 3 hours of it; which, with the other articles of regimen, seems perceptibly to be doing me good. The house is quite <hi rend="italic">solitary,</hi> all but a servant or two, the family 500 miles away in the remote Highlands,&#x2014;and extremely anxious, I must own, to make me comfortable here.

<salute>Dear Neuberg,</salute>
<p>Your Letter reaches me here this morning. I am very sorry to hear of your being afflicted in that way. You must be quiet I believe, and attentive to your <pb id="pg-30-61" n="30:61"/>regimen. The root of the complaint is always in the <hi rend="italic">liver</hi>. I suppose a blue-pill or two might have beneficial effects. Nay the thing itself is often regarded as beneficial:&#x2014;Frederick had annually some business of that kind; and regarded it as a crisis turning him into the right path for the months coming.</p>
<p>I have remained steadily here, my Wife going and coming, as the practical arrangements demand her. In general I am lonely as La Trappe, or even more so, for there is but <hi rend="italic">one</hi> La Trappist here, and the very eyes are kept incommunicative; on the other hand I have plenty of Voltaire Literature, fit to yield en<supplied>[d]</supplied>less<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> reflexions, were there no other source of such; and every day, or nearly so, I have one of the finest rides, thro&#x2019; these green lanes, over these green commons, still as beautiful as in summer. My little horse I praise greatly; an excellent, intelligent, swift and diligent little quadruped;&#x2014;does me most useful service here. What with exercise, what with being &#x201C;well let alone,&#x201D; I sometimes feel as if I were really <hi rend="italic">better:</hi>&#x2014;of course I am, whether perceptibly or not.</p>
<p>I have not yet set any day for coming back to my desk and garret; fancy it may be about the end of next week;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC writes on Wed.</note>&#x2014;you shall have the Horse, however, when you like to speak: always remember that.</p>
<p>On Saturday ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi> and Sunday ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi> next I partly purpose to be at Chelsea: if you are well enough for a Sunday ev<hi rend="italic">g&#x2019;s</hi> expedition, perhaps you will try? <closer><salute>Yours always truly</salute></closer></p>

<p>Well, you went away, in spite of all I could persuade; and left a <foreign><hi rend="italic">wae</hi></foreign> enough man, if you found a happy Nero! You might have had such a bright sunny day here today; we might have had a great many things, truly: but you would not listen; you had <hi rend="italic">said,</hi> and so it is.</p>
<p>My ride yesterday, and my much walking, might have done me more good, than it has yet visibly done. I did not sleep very well, tho&#x2019; better than the former night. My ride was lonely, thro&#x2019; the heart of woods, a great part of it; thro&#x2019; stubble fields, and along remote hillsides most part of the rest, avoiding dust and the highways: this little horse does me a great deal of good. My <hi rend="italic">pigeons</hi> were <hi rend="italic">boiled</hi> (and the broth poured away, all but half-a-gill) instead of stewed: a baddish dinner, had there not been a pudding, thanks to the ever-assiduous <pb id="pg-30-62" n="30:62"/>Mrs Wenham. I got my bread too this morning; toasted a nook of it brown, and partly &#x201C;enj<hi rend="italic">oay</hi>ed it&#x201D; (as poor Grahame said) after a good round of walking thro&#x2019; the dust. Dust is better than dew in these heavy still mornings. Neuberg&#x2019;s Letter (with a Dumfries Paper) were my only social condiments,&#x2014;think what a &#x201C;condiment&#x201D; Neuberg&#x2019;s! However, he lets me keep the horse; he is really very helpful and kind. Lady A&#x2019;s Letter came by the 11 o&#x2019;clock delivery.&#x2014; I have a Letter to write to Jack; I found on the mantel-piece this morning a stray snip of paper, with that request and &#x201C;poste restante&#x201D; suggested on it: so I must be sharp and have done here.</p>
<p>I still think of being up on Saturday ev<hi rend="italic">g:</hi> indeed I have <hi rend="italic">forbidden</hi> the Wenham fowl, and shall have no food unless I come back to you.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>The wind had risen here to a quite exorbitant pitch for two or three days about the time you sailed: so that I was in unusual appetite for a Note from you; and as none came on Saturday I felt a little disappointed; but had there none arrived on Monday I found I should have been seriously uneasy in my solitude. But Jane brought it out with her; thanks to you and to her I got that portion of my confusions all rightly settled. Next day (yesterday) I wrote to Jean, and also to Jamie, communicating the intelligence. I had fancied you did not expect to hear from me till you wrote again from C&#xF6;then: but today I find on the mantel-piece a flying snip of paper, which teaches me otherwise. So I write before going out to ride.</p>
<p>I have been here since before you sailed. Finding myself so jumbled by the <pb id="pg-30-63" n="30:63"/>Suffolk week;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >His stay with FitzGerald at Woodbridge, Aug.</note> and having both been invited out hither with new pressure, and got (willingly, as Neuberg was at Hastings) a loan of Neuberg&#x2019;s little excell<hi rend="italic">t</hi> horse, I determined on tearing myself out hither, for a real spell of solitude. It was on Thursday, the night after you got to Edin<hi rend="italic">r,</hi> that we came out, Jane by rail, I riding; Jane came, by express intention, &#x201C;to set things agoing&#x201D; for me here; then went home on Sunday following: she has been twice out since, but only stops for a night each time: so that I am as perfectly a <hi rend="italic">Hermit</hi> as it is well possible to conceive in modern life. I ride between 2 and 3 hours daily; walk also generally twice; read a great deal, muse and mope d<hi rend="italic">o,</hi> smoke and saunter on the smooth lawns under those big leafy trees (with <hi rend="italic">cushats</hi> audible in one of them: and thus nearly a fortnight has glided away, not quite without advantage to me, I will hope. The weather is utterly <hi rend="italic">rain</hi>less, often of late nearly windless too (which my horse does not like so well), and bright with the pale splendour of autumn; roads, paths, green Heaths, lanes and even open or permeable fields offer everywhere the nicest solitary riding: I ought to be well content with my <hi rend="italic">Hermitage</hi> at any rate. I think of holding on till about the end of next week, but have not yet <hi rend="italic">set</hi> any day. Direct, you, always to Chelsea; that is the safest, and cannot cause beyond a few hours delay.</p>
<p>I shall be well pleased to hear of your being fairly moored at Coethen for a while. I hope you did <hi rend="italic">not</hi> persist in keeping yourself apart from all old acquaintances at Berlin You surely sought out Abeken and others? If I had known you were at once bound thither, I might have sent a few messages. Innumerable things seem to lie <hi rend="italic">hidden</hi> for me at Berlin! I do not see how I shall ever get my Book done to advantage with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> going back:&#x2014;and I cannot sleep in German beds, when I am there. Alas, I am very <hi rend="italic">weak;</hi> that is the real truth of it.</p>
<p>You will go and see Rosbach, I think, at any rate: it is something to be upon the authenticated ground where a great action was done. This was one of the <hi rend="italic">cunningest</hi> battles F<hi rend="italic">k</hi> ever fought: the French were never better beaten than by this <hi rend="italic">petit Marquis de Brandebourg</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 17:264.</note> whom they came to do the honour of &#x26;c &#x26;c. But you must get a <hi rend="italic">Tempelhof,</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-30/lt-18550828-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1855-08-28">28 Aug.</date></ref></note> or some <hi rend="italic">good</hi> account with map and plan (if there is any other so good), and read it well before you go. If indeed y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> mind carry you to go at all!&#x2014; No doubt you will be for Weimar, if almost for any place. You have <hi rend="italic">seen</hi> the &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Hofrath</hi> Marshall,&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Marshall.</note> have you not? A word written to him to say who you are will at once open everything: he is a <hi rend="italic">very</hi> obliging and kind little man. Or if you want an express Note from me, say <pb id="pg-30-64" n="30:64"/>so.&#x2014; Tom Wilson lives, I think, some miles out of Town; but of course is there daily.

<p>Thanks for your nice little Letter; it was a marked comfort to me when I came down this morning. Nothing farther, but a Note from Jean,&#x2014;in great anxiety for want of news from John: my Letter, enclosing his, w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> arrive at Dumfries in an hour or two.</p>
<p>I have not recovered my sleep; six or seven the time still of awakening. But I know what ails me, and mean to attack that tonight. After breakfast today, amid the pattering of the welcome rain, I fairly fell asleep over my Book, and must have dozed and half-slumbered almost two hours! It is now within <hi rend="italic">ten minutes</hi> of the Horse; so I must be brief!&#x2014; &#x2014; The only thing I had, in fact, to say is that Saturday stands <hi rend="italic">fixed:</hi> evening for <hi rend="italic">tea;</hi> I will either dine on eggs
<pb id="pg-30-66" n="30:66"/>here, or miss altogether, which may perhaps do as well. I have settled it, however, and announced it here; the woman is not to come back after Friday till Tuesday, or &#x201C;till warned again,&#x201D; it perhaps was. There <hi rend="italic">is</hi> the Horse!</p>

<salute>Dear Maccall,</salute>
<p>If I could do anything for a meritorious man, such as I believe Mr Gowanlock<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified, but possibly Walter Gowenlock, tinman, Green Bank, Wapping.</note> to be, it would be a real comfort to me: but alas I do not in the least see any way towards bringing any help in his sore distress. Every year I shrink closer into my own poor corner, over my own distracted imbroglio of what I call &#x201C;work&#x201D; (which cannot be done); and have less and less concern with the Siege of Sebastopol and the Crystal Palace Millennium. I will keep his case in mind; and if any chance or possibility do occur, you may be certain I will not neglect it. Ballantyne,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Ballantyne.</note> I think, if you reminded him, might be of more practical use: he is one of the helpfullest of human creatures to brethren in distress; and he is always in the thick of business, cognisant of the feasibilities.</p>
<p>It is a very long while since I have seen you now; but I suppose always you will look in upon me some day again. You are slashing away, I can well believe, and at no loss for <hi rend="italic">stuff</hi> to your sickle or sword! The harvest, as always, is great, and the labourers are few.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Matt. 9:37.</note></p>
<p><closer><salute>Wishing you better and better speed in a good course, I remain always</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Fitzgerald,</salute>
<p>I have been here ever since the day you last heard of me; leading the strangest life of absolute <hi rend="italic">Latrappism;</hi> and often enough remembering Farlingay and you. I live perfectly alone, and without speech at all,&#x2014;there being in fact nobody to speak to, except one austerely punctual housemaid, who does her function, like an eightday clock, generally without bidding. My Wife comes out now and then to give the requisite directions; but commonly withdraws again on the morrow, leaving the monster to himself and his own ways. I have Books; a complete Edition of <hi rend="italic">Voltaire,</hi> for one Book, in which I read for <hi rend="italic">use,</hi> or for idleness oftenest,&#x2014;getting into endless reflexions over it, mostly of a sad and not very utterable nature. I find V.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Voltaire.</note> a &#x201C;gentleman&#x201D;; living in a world partly furnished with such; and that there are now almost no &#x201C;gentlemen&#x201D; (not quite <hi rend="italic">none</hi>): this is one great head of my reflexions, to which there is no visible <hi rend="italic">tail</hi> or finish. I have also a Horse (borrowed from my fat German friend,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Neuberg.</note> who is at seabathing in Sussex); and I go riding, at great lengths daily, over hill and dale: this I believe is really the main good I am doing,&#x2014;if in this either there be much good. But it is a strange way of life to me, for the time; perhaps not unprofitable: To let <hi rend="italic">Chaos</hi> say out its say, then, and one&#x2019;s Evil Genius give one the very worst language he has, for a while. It is still to last for a week or more. Today, for the first time, I ride back to Chelsea; but mean to return hither on monday. There is a great circle of yellow light all the way from Shooter&#x2019;s Hill to Primrose Hill,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >From SE to NW London.</note> spread round my horizon every night, I see it while smoking my pipe before bed (so bright, last night, it cast a visible shadow of me against the white window-shutters); and this is all I have to do with London and its <hi rend="italic">gases</hi> for a fortnight or more. My Wife writes to me, there was an awful jangle of bells last day she went home from this; a Quaker asked in the railway, of some porter, &#x201C;Can thou tell me what those bells mean?&#x201C;&#x2014; Well, I suppose something is up. They say Sebastopol is took, and the Rushans run away.&#x201C;&#x2014; <foreign><hi rend="italic">&#xc0; la bonne heure</hi></foreign> [well and good]: but won&#x2019;t they come back again, think you?</p>
<p>On the whole I say, when you get your little Suffolk cottage, you must have in it a &#x201C;chamber in the wall&#x201D; for me, <hi rend="italic">plus</hi> a pony that can trot, and a cow that gives good milk: with these outfits we shall make a pretty rustication now and <pb id="pg-30-68" n="30:68"/>then, not wholly <hi rend="italic">Latrappish,</hi> but only <hi rend="italic">half,</hi> on much easier terms than here; and I shall be right willing to come and try it, I for one party.&#x2014; &#x2014; Meanwhile, I hope the Naseby matter is steadily going ahead; sale <hi rend="italic">completed;</hi> and even the <hi rend="italic">monument</hi> concern making way.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-30/lt-18550823-TC-EF-01">TC to EF, <date when="1855-08-23">23 Aug.</date></ref></note> Tell me a little how that and other matters are. If you are at home, a line is rapidly conveyed hither, steam all the way: after the beginning of next week, I am at Chelsea, and (I dare say) there is a fire in the evenings now to welcome you there. Shew face in some way or other.</p>
<p><closer><salute>And so <foreign>adieu</foreign>; for my hour of riding is at hand.</salute></closer><note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC had apparently not yet received FitzGerald&#x2019;s note from Farlingay, <date when="1855-09-14">14 Sept.</date>, saying that he was just back from London and probably soon going to Norfolk.</note></p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Here, lying ready for Nash<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >From the London Lib.; otherwise unidentified.</note> when he passes this way, are one or two of the numerous volumes which I (unwillingly sinful) hold from your establish<hi rend="italic">t</hi>.</p>
<p>1. Gleim&#x2019;s Gedichte 1 vol.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly Johann Wilhelm Ludwig Gleim, <hi rend="italic">Gedichte,</hi> 5 vols. in one (Berlin, <date when="1753-00-00">1753</date>&#x2013;<date when="1758-00-00">58</date>); or a vol. of Gleim, <hi rend="italic">S&#xE4;mmtliche Werke,</hi> 7 vols. (Halberstadt, <date when="1811-00-00">1811</date>&#x2013;<date when="1813-00-00">13</date>).</note></p>
<p>2. Coxe&#x2019;s Austria 1 vol (vol 2):<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Coxe, <hi rend="italic">History of the House of Austria &#x2026; <date when="1218-00-00">1218</date> to <date when="1792-00-00">1792</date>,</hi> 2 vols. (<date when="1807-00-00">1807</date>). <hi rend="italic">Carlyle&#x2019;s House</hi> 87 lists TC&#x2019;s copy with his MS notes as 3 vols. (<date when="1852-00-00">1852</date>&#x2013;<date when="1854-00-00">54</date>); he cites this edn., <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 13:370.</note>&#x2014;I shall not need that again, having now bought the Book.</p>
<p>3. Coxe&#x2019;s Pelham 2 voll.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Coxe, <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of the Administration of the Right Honourable Henry Pelham,</hi> 2 vols. (<date when="1829-00-00">1829</date>).</note> (very much in want of binding;&#x2014;that, <hi rend="italic">if</hi> nobody else is reading it, would be useful beside me here till I procure a copy of my own)</p>
<p>4. Menckenii Scriptures<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Johann Burchard Mencke, <hi rend="italic">Scriptores Rerum Germanicarum praecipue Saxonicarum</hi> (Leipzig, <date when="1720-00-00">1720</date>&#x2013;<date when="1730-00-00">30</date>); cited <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 12:99.</note> &#x26;c vol. 2<hi rend="italic">d:</hi>&#x2014;which completes the List at present.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Urstisius</hi><note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Christianus Urstisius (Latinized name of Christian Wurstisen [<date when="1544-00-00">1544</date>&#x2013;<date when="1588-00-00">88</date>]), <hi rend="italic">Germaniae Historicorum Illustrium</hi> (Frankfurt, <date when="1585-00-00">1585</date>).</note> I have not; nor can I clearly remember ever to have had it <hi rend="italic">here,</hi> tho&#x2019; such too may have been the case; I can remember very well having looked a little at it in your Reading-room. Either way, I hope it will turn up to <pb id="pg-30-69" n="30:69"/>the quick eye of Mr Jones. A <hi rend="italic">Canisius</hi><note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Either Henricus Canisius, <hi rend="italic">Thesaurus monumentorum ecclesiasticorum et historicorum</hi> (Amsterdam, <date when="1725-00-00">1725</date>), or Petrus Canisius (Latinized name of Pieter D. Hondt [<date when="1521-00-00">1521</date>&#x2013;<date when="1597-00-00">97</date>]), <hi rend="italic">Ane Catechisme or Schort Instruction of Christian Religion</hi> (<date when="1588-00-00">1588</date>).</note> I once had, for some time; but that also is not here, and I conclude has been returned.</p>
<p>I <hi rend="italic">blush</hi> to have still above 80 volumes, according to your account! How are Laws to be observed when Lawmakers (at least theoretic Lawmakers)<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC was on the executive committee of the London Lib. According to the <date when="1855-00-00">1855</date> &#x201C;Laws and Regulations of The London Library,&#x201D; as a member living within 10 mi. of the General Post Office, TC was supposed to take no more than 10 vols. at a time.</note> break the Law to such extent? But it is a fact I <hi rend="italic">need</hi> all those Books at present (and could be much accommodated by having a couple of hundreds more, could I conjure them out of their remote hidingplaces, as I cannot, hither ready to my hand); and another fact I understand, or struggle always to believe is that nobody else is very specially needing them (otherwise they are of course at once given up): so that I have sometimes thought, as it is absolutely not want of punctuality, nor want even of some virtual claim to indulgence in the circumstances, that there ought to be some special regulation made for cases like mine,&#x2014;for example that it might be competent to present a Petition to the Committee stating &#x26;c &#x26;c upon which the Committee to <hi rend="italic">absolve</hi> here and there a member from the rigour of the Law, who may be dealing in Books little or not at all read, and for whom one reading of a Book will by no means suffice. This I have often thought of; and if you would concoct such a regulation, I should be happy to introduce and support it with all my strength. For it is by no means pleasant to be in any matter beyond the verge of the written law, if one could contrive to be by any means within it!&#x2014; Think of this regulation, whether it could not be feasible. I consider it the very life of the Library that you are struggling, gently but constantly, to bring it wholly <hi rend="italic">under strict rule,</hi>&#x2014;with that, and with a <hi rend="italic">serious</hi> Committee (or even one or two serious and knowing members in it) to direct in choice of Books, I can predict a long flourishing and <hi rend="italic">useful</hi> existence to the London Library and otherwise not a long or very useful existence;&#x2014;and I am really sorry not to be <hi rend="italic">literally</hi> legal myself. But perhaps we shall get out of this pass one day!&#x2014; Meanwhile please send me, as often as you like, a correct List of the Books you claim, and I will investigate, acknowledge and at least have the items entered afresh. And so, Forward, and much speed to you! No need of any answer to this; I expect to be permanently home in about a week, and shall then see you often and one day get answer by word of mouth. <closer><salute>Yours always truly</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Neuberg,</salute>
<p>We were sorry you did not come on Sunday Ev<hi rend="italic">g;</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1855-09-16">16 Sept.</date></note> the rather as your absence gave room to surmise that you were still on the sick list. Finding nothing from you here, on my return, nor since, I begin to wish considerably for a line,&#x2014;to set my extravagant imagination at rest, were there nothing else. I shall be here till Saturday evening, perhaps longer; so that if you write at once, there is no danger of missing me. A single word as to how you are, that is all I want.</p>
<p>My sunday and monday in Chelsea were by no means so quiet as the days are here: Clough &#x26; his Wife<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Arthur and Blanche Clough; Clough wrote to Emerson, <date when="1855-09-14">14 Sept.</date>: &#x201C;Of Carlyle I have seen nothing lately, but am meditating a visit next Sunday&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Correspondence of Clough</hi> 2:506).</note> had come down to us; Browning also was there, whom I hope you may have some other opportunity of meeting. I came riding out again in the damp dusk of Monday; and have been as solitary as St Antony<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >St. Anthony of Egypt (?<date when="0251-00-00">251</date>&#x2013;<date when="0356-00-00">356</date>), religious hermit, believed to be the founder of Christian monasticism.</note> ever since. A great relief to get rid of the babble of the world altogether, for a few hours; and let the <hi rend="italic">sombrest</hi> voices of Fact speak to us a little, which at least do mean what they say!&#x2014; The <hi rend="italic">Life of Fred</hi>k I must own, takes a very formidable aspect in some of these abstruse &#x201C;Dialogues with the Silences&#x201D;; a work as good as &#x201C;impossible&#x201D; &#x26;c &#x26;c,&#x2014;that is still my private opinion about it;&#x2014;nevertheless I do not mean to give in; nor do I doubt but some good (whether in that form or another) will come to me from whatever <hi rend="italic">honest</hi> labour I have put into that affair. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Vorw&#xE4;rts</hi></foreign> [Forward], therefore. My little four-footed friend continues very helpful, willingly and wisely doing his part,&#x2014;giving me sight of many fine green scenes and solitudes, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> without him were inaccessible.&#x2014; &#x201C;Sebastopol&#x201D; does not concern me much: if it were completely &#x201C;taken&#x201D; (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> it is far from being) what good c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be in it, except that people w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> give up speaking of it?</p>

<p><salute>Dear Lady,&#x2014;</salute>The Sun has got across the Line, under happy enough auspices; and now the time has come when I too take my road into other latitudes of a dimmer description. The last act I do in your mansion here is to take farewell of you: it seems as if I were parting far away and for a long time,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; the historical fact I believe is, I am coming 10 miles nearer you, and we may hope, within another three weeks, to see the Lady of this little Surrey <foreign><hi rend="italic">Monbijou</hi></foreign> [My jewel] in person, and even to be there beside her royal self perhaps, which will rather help the impression of the place, I should expect! So it is in fact; but a certain cloud of sadness hangs over this bright region, in spite of the lively sunshine, as I take leave of it; and the <hi rend="italic">end,</hi> like the end of all things, makes the heart <hi rend="italic"><foreign>wae</foreign>:</hi>&#x2014; Do you know that Scotch word? There is none in English that so expresses the thing. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Ay de mi, Ay de mi!</hi></foreign></p>
<p>I have had 24 of the strangest beneficent Days, here in your domain, shut out from all the world; eight-and-forty times (only think of that) I must have made tea for myself in your little fairy teapot (the red tile-china saucy little teapot),&#x2014;and I often thought to myself there was perhaps nobody in Surrey who got as <hi rend="italic">good;</hi> being done by an artist in tea, and all under his own hand! With the window-screens half down, warm sun and fresh air streaming in, and the Day all ahead of one and belonging to oneself, those were singular mornings, and a curious <hi rend="italic">manna</hi> all that, falling out of the sky upon a poor pilgrim in this modern world.&#x2014; I have had such rides too, most memorable and beneficial; yesterday, my last, was one of my longest and finest; over the heights behind Addington; far round to North-eastward, by I know not what solitary footpaths, hills, lanes and dells; ending on Hayes Common,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >11 mi. W of London, N of the Thames. Addington Park is about 2 mi. SE of Croydon.</note> as has often been the case.&#x2014; My thoughts have often been very sombre,&#x2014;as what solitary creature&#x2019;s are not, with so many years behind him, especially if he have <hi rend="italic">liver</hi> too, and a History of Fritz which no man <hi rend="italic">can</hi> write, even if Vulture Panizzi were to offer pens from his own ugly person? Alas, alas&#x2014; But I do believe in the absolute necessity of encountering such moods, were they even much painfuller than they are: and, on the whole, it is evident to me I am in fact rather <hi rend="italic">better,</hi> both in body and mind, for my Quasi-Moslem <hi rend="italic">ramadhan</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The ninth month of the Muslim year, spent in fasting from sunrise to sunset.</note> out here; and shall hope to do a little better amid my insoluble imbroglios than has lately been the doom of me, when I get back. Take thanks therefore, O royal Lady; and reckon, if you like, that this is one of the good things you <pb id="pg-30-72" n="30:72"/>have done with your bounties in the year now running downwards:&#x2014;truly it is but a poor item, you will say; yes, but I answer it is really one. That is to say, Provided I am not entirely a Son of Chaos and Satanas; for in that sad case, it will be a <hi rend="italic">maleficence,</hi> and reckoned against you as such, you unfortunate mistaken woman! &#x201C;But we hope better things, though we thus speak,&#x201C;&#x2014;as the Scotch preachers say;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; cf. <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390505-JWC-MAC-01"><sic>11:94</sic><corr>JWC to MAC, <date when="1839-05-05">5 May 1839</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014;and in fine however that may be, it is very certain you are good to <hi rend="italic">me;</hi> and I do not now for the first time reflect on it as one of the strangest and greatest facts in my poor history: fact little short of miraculous (if we consider everything) and fact never to be forgotten.&#x2014; But I must end all this.</p>
<p>Jane came out to me on Thursday ev<hi rend="italic">g;</hi> staid two days this time, settling my affairs for me: Friday we went to the Crystal Palace<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >At Sydenham, about 4 mi. from Addiscombe.</note> in compliment to her, <hi rend="italic">walking</hi> to and from;&#x2014;saw no Wagner there,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Richard Wagner (<date when="1813-00-00">1813</date>&#x2013;<date when="1883-00-00">83</date>), composer; active in the Dresden uprising, <date when="1849-00-00">1849</date>; now in exile, living in Z&#xfc;rich.

But who&#x2014;or what&#x2014;is to entice back the audience that has been frightened away by the indulgence?&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Athenaeum,</hi> <date when="1855-06-16">16 June</date>).</note> tho&#x2019; curious-looking beings, bearded Germans &#x26;c, were in great plenty.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>The best news I have got for you is that Jean seems to be fairly thro&#x2019; her sore business; has brought a son into the world (Saturday morning last,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1855-09-22">22 Sept.</date> John (d. autumn <date when="1856-00-00">1856</date>); wrongly identified at <ref target="volume-28/lt-18531020-TC-JCA-01"><sic>28:294</sic><corr>TC to JCA, <date when="1853-10-20">20 Oct. 1853</date></corr></ref>; that John (b. <date when="1836-00-00">1836</date>) was James and Isabella Carlyle&#x2019;s son.</note> about 1 o&#x2019;clock), after an illness of some 30 hours: I had a hasty scrape of a pen to that effect on Monday from James; then again more deliberate account next morning: assurance both times that Mother and Son were both doing well.&#x2014; It was my full intention to write to you at least <hi rend="italic">yesterday;</hi> and I had taken my arrangements accordingly, and had even actually <hi rend="italic">begun</hi> (with my watch lying on the table, there being still <hi rend="italic">time</hi> if I stood to it),&#x2014;when Chorley came in, a stranger and man not to be trifled with; so that the Post hour expired to no purpose! There was nothing of hurry; except this Dumfries news, which might have relieved an anxiety in you a little sooner.&#x2014; &#x2014; Jean seems to have had a tedious and painful, but perhaps at no time dangerous time of it, poor creature: she took ill &#x201C;early on Friday morning&#x201D; James says; was ill all day and night till one or two o&#x2019;clock on Saturday morn<hi rend="italic">g:</hi> &#x201C;Dr Adam&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. Andrew Mercer Adam, 22 Buccleugh St., Dumfries; one of the physicians of Dumfries and Galloway Royal Infirmary; M.D<corr>.</corr>, Edinburgh, <date when="1853-00-00">1853</date>.</note> was extremely attentive, <hi rend="italic">constantly</hi> there after Friday noon: about 9 that night, they, being anxious, called in Dr Blacklock,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. Archibald Blacklock, Castle St., Dumfries; he had qualified at the English and Naval Medical Board, <date when="1811-00-00">1811</date>; promoted, <date when="1814-00-00">1814</date>, to surgeon, Royal Navy. He had been asst. surgeon, Royal Naval Hospital, Deal, and the hospital for prisoners of war, Portsmouth, and surgeon of H.M.S. <hi rend="italic">Thames</hi>.</note> who after waiting an hour said that there was nothing wrong, that they must just wait, and all w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be well. A Mrs Renwick<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> (whom James praises greatly) seems to be still there.&#x2014; And in short, I trust we may now consider this anxiety as lifted off from us, and the affair (so far) mercifully over. Poor Jean; she made no complaint, but I dare say was not without her serious apprehensions: I am heartily glad and relieved that it is now over <hi rend="italic">so</hi>.</p>
<p>Your Letter found me duly at Addiscombe; thither also came, enclosed, the <hi rend="italic">stamped</hi> Letter of these three; that I put into my writing-case, and (being a day behind me at Addiscombe) it was the reason I could not write on Monday. On Monday Mrs Fraser called me down,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >To John Carlyle&#x2019;s lodgings, 14 Montpelier Sq.</note> and solemnly delivered the other two Notes; did not however detain me farther; poor little body. She is extremely anxious to find some business for her son,&#x2014;&#x201C;business that will at <pb id="pg-30-74" n="30:74"/>once bring him something in.&#x201D; I enclose the 3 Notes;&#x2014;I write today <hi rend="italic">before</hi> doing anything else, so as to be sure ag<hi rend="italic">t</hi> post-time.</p>
<p>I continued steady at Addiscombe, where the weather was of extreme brightness, quietly till Sunday; on Sunday afternoon, packed myself finally together, and came riding home to dinner. The sun, so it happened, <hi rend="italic">veiled</hi> himself when I was about Tooting,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Nr. Clapham, just S of the Thames.</note> blackish vapours, and a beginning of wind from the East; which phenomena have continued, and strengthened, ever since: very sharp cold weather, with the sun generally hidden till today. I fancy myself perceptibly improved by my rustication and my solitude. It was curious work; left so <hi rend="italic">mute</hi> there, and utterly to one&#x2019;s own reflexions and devices. Jane had come out on the Thursday Evening, chiefly to settle my various scores; I persuaded her to stay over next day, and then we walked to the Crystal Palace (walk of 3&#xBD;miles, half of it thro&#x2019; fields), no great things of an adventure. I looked again greatly at the sculptures; found that there was in fact otherwise nothing which I in the least cared to look at, after the first survey of 5 minutes. A place for <hi rend="italic">children,</hi> I should mainly define it to be, and calculated to please children much: in all other respects. Jane went off on the Saturday morning again; and I next afternoon as you have heard.</p>
<p>Things lie very perverse, and much tumbled, all round me here; and I must now try to what length I can force some order upon them. If that horrid <hi rend="italic">stagnancy</hi> of bodily and mental function will but keep away for a while, I hope to do some good, more or less. God knows, there is need enough of it; for I am deep sunk as I have seldom been.</p>
<p>Neuberg yields me his horse till the end of this week;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC writes on Wed.</note> nothing loath, for a while, being himself absent; and still he is not much able to ride, having had a fit of <hi rend="italic">biliaries</hi> (not beautiful to speak about!) from wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> he is just recovering. He was here last Sunday night; perceptibly uglier than ever, as Jane asserted. Browning had come down too, to whom Neuberg could hardly be bridled into handsome behaviour: Browning staid an hour after him; was really entertaining in his way. He <hi rend="italic">has</hi> a singularly lively conception of every object that has come before him; and will give you the like, if you patiently endure, and let him haggle and wriggle thro&#x2019; the strange jungle of loud speech (loud <hi rend="italic">soliloquy,</hi> you would say, rather than dialogue) which is his way of communicating it. He has decidedly a good talent;&#x2014;but is unluckily, and now bids fair to continue, in the valley of the shadow of mere George-Sandism, Mazzini-ism, Leigh Huntism:<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Liberalism. TC had never met George Sand, but had arranged an introduction for the Brownings to meet her through Mazzini, who knew her well; see <ref target="volume-22/lt-18471002-JWC-TC-01"><sic>22:106</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1847-10-02">2 Oct. 1847</date></corr></ref>.</note> one cannot help it; tho&#x2019; it is a pity! Tennyson&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Maud</hi> I have never yet read; I tried while at Farlingay, Fitz having it; but <pb id="pg-30-75" n="30:75"/>wanted heart to persist.

Many early reviews criticized the poem for its obscurity, its view of war, particularly the idea of war as regeneration, and the hero&#x2019;s morbidness; see E. F. Shannon, &#x201C;The Critical Reception of Tennyson&#x2019;s &#x2018;Maud,&#x2019;&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">PMLA</hi> 68 (<date when="1953-06-00">June 1953</date>): 397&#x2013;417. W. E. Aytoun, in an unsigned review, called the poem &#x201C;unhappy, unwholesome and disagreeable &#x2026; ill-considered, crude, tawdry and objectionable&#x201D; (&#x201C;Maud,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Blackwood&#x2019;s Edinburgh Magazine</hi> 78 [<date when="1855-00-00">1855</date>]: 311&#x2013;21). E. S. Dallas praised the poem for supporting the Crimean War but accused Tennyson of &#x201C;all the worst faults&#x201D; of contemporary poets who hid themselves &#x201C;in holes and corners, weaving interminable cobwebs out of their own bowels&#x201D; and said that &#x201C;Maud&#x201D; was &#x201C;crude,&#x201D; &#x201C;shapeless,&#x201D; and &#x201C;commonplace&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Times,</hi> <date when="1855-08-25">25 Aug.</date>).</note>&#x2014;such as I have seen <hi rend="italic">you</hi> excite by kicking on the door, at Scotsbrig, in old times!&#x2014; &#x2014; Darwin is here, with a kind of cold; but goes to Shrewsbury next week: I have not yet got sight of him. In fact I have seen nobody, beyond what you hear; nor do I desire it for the present.</p>

<salute>My dear Sister,</salute>
<p>You may be well sure it was a glad sight to us, that little Note of James&#x2019;s on Monday morning; one of the shortest and most important we have got, this long while! I am right thankful you have got thro&#x2019; your sore task; I have written to Jack about the glad event; and now, I trust, a great anxiety is removed from both of us. James&#x2019;s second Note, of Tuesday, reports what a tedious sore business you had; but that now all goes on well, and trouble is turned into gladness. Let us be thankful, let us be quietly glad!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I would have written yesterday, and had shaped out my time to that effect; but, at the wrong time, poor Chorley came in,&#x2014;rather a stranger of late,&#x2014;so I <pb id="pg-30-76" n="30:76"/>was obliged to delay; and then the post was gone. Perhaps it was just as well that I did not disturb you at all till after another day. Thank James very much, on my behalf, for writing so punctually. I will hope to hear from yourself in a little while; perhaps tomorrow, if you keep your purpose; but do not hurry or flurry yourself about such a thing,&#x2014;only I shall now want soon to hear from one or other of you again (to keep down imaginations): one word will do.</p>
<p>I finished off my Addiscombe Affairs at the finish of the Week; and came home to my dinner on Sunday,&#x2014;a quiet ride, my last in those parts for some time. All the roads are now <hi rend="italic">vacant,</hi> especially on Sundays, in that and other regions, everybody and everything having taken to rail instead. I did not know that <hi rend="italic">you</hi> had got happily thro&#x2019;, at that time of day, nor how ill you had been; among my many thoughts, vague and definite, that comfortable one could not yet belong to me.</p>
<p>I fancy I have got some real improvement by those three weeks of country solitude and riding: at all events, it was a fair trial I made; and there was nothing else so reasonably within my reach. I find my labours here lying, as I left them, in a most intricate, wrecked and <hi rend="italic">impossible</hi> condition: I must take them heartily up, and see if I cannot <hi rend="italic">make</hi> them &#x201C;possible&#x201D; a little! A small addition of health (if I have got that, as I hope) will be of first-rate consequence in that attempt. I keep my Horse still till the end of this week; riding diligently every afternoon 2 hours: at the end of the week, I surrender and take to my feet again. The Town is quite empty (never saw it emptier), weather now getting very sharp and <hi rend="italic">east-windy</hi>. <closer><salute>Take care of yourself dear Sister; and let me hear soon.</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Neuberg,</salute>
<p>When we meet and begin talking, the <hi rend="italic">Paper Account</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Neuberg wrote to TC from Hastings, <date when="1855-08-29">29 Aug.</date>, that he had written to Parkins &#x26; Gotto, manufacturing stationers, 24 and 25 Oxford St., &#x201C;about your note-paper. Some of the old which I had bought at the same time, was punctually sent.&#x201D;</note> is sure to go out of my head: I see no chance of your ever being paid,&#x2014;unless in stamps by post. So here is 3/6 in that form; and my conscience will be clearer.</p>
<p>I had some thoughts of riding up<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >To Willesden.</note> with the Horse,&#x2014;riding up and walking down;&#x2014;but what day it may be I cannot say; for indeed all is yet uncertain. Wherefore, except perhaps a word to the groom (if even that), do not you <pb id="pg-30-77" n="30:77"/>concern yourself with the adventure in its present form.&#x2014; If <hi rend="italic">it</hi> all go to water (as may be dreaded), you will find the little quadruped ready to carry you <hi rend="italic">home</hi> on Sunday night: that will be one lazy way for me, tho&#x2019; the &#x201C;voice of duty&#x201D; seems to demand a nobler!</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Tomorrow, according to program, you will probably leave C&#xF6;then; I hope there is still time to hit you in Hamburg: I did mean to write yesterday, and <hi rend="italic">meant</hi> also the day before; but have been sadly hunted; and this now is my last chance. Happily I have <hi rend="italic">not</hi> &#x201C;anything important to say&#x201C;: if we miss therefore, there will be no bones broken.</p>
<p>I punctually put your enclosure for Arthur<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Watt.</note> in the Post-office, last time; of that, since I said nothing of it, you might have made certain. Jean has written to me, twice, a short note, from Dumfries: all appears to be going on well with her; and the affair happily over: a big Boy whom they are thinking (but not sure) to call Sandy,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >He was called John.</note> she says. I myself have been, and am, up to the throat in sorry paper-clippings and scriptorial rubbish, ever since my return to this garret. Rubbish that will never come to anything, I do clearly think; but which requires to be worked out to a kind of issue, for conscience sake, and then flung away. This does not relate to <hi rend="italic">Fritz</hi> hitherto; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> makes me the more impatient to have done with it.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC finished, <date when="1855-10-06">6 Oct.</date>, his essay &#x201C;The Guises,&#x201D; on the ducal family of the house of Lorraine, <date when="1528-00-00">1528</date>&#x2013;<date when="1675-00-00">1675</date> (which fought in the religious wars of the <date>16th</date> and <date>17th cents.</date>, the same period as in <hi rend="italic">Frederick,</hi> bk. 3; see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 12:162&#x2013;318). It included a section on the marriage of Mary of Guise (<date when="1515-00-00">1515</date>&#x2013;<date when="1560-00-00">60</date>) and James V of Scotland (<date when="1512-00-00">1512</date>&#x2013;<date when="1542-00-00">42</date>) and a digression on modern Scotland: &#x201C;the gallant bright young gentleman, resolutely scanning, in the remotest nooks, and Hebridean sands and bays, these capabilities of his poor country. &#x2026; Who now encourages Fisheries Linen trades, of any good thing whatsoever in Scotland? &#x2026; No man. &#x2026; A new commandment God has given men: Buy in the cheapest market, sell in the dearest. &#x2026; Hudson&#x2019;s statue, railway scrip transactions, cloth of devil&#x2019;s dust, meal of plaster lime literature Fine Arts so called of I will not say what quality: all these things, and as I said the Gospel of Cheap and Nasty, are by no means lovely to me. &#x2026; To think of the hearts of heroic navigating Kings, and still more heroic prudent pains all-ending, all defying Teachers and Preachers of the past ages,&#x2014;hearts say only of King James the Fifth and John Knox the first and last, coined into drachmas for the benefit of gambling dealers in pig-iron and the like,&#x2014;is that a pleasant phasis of prosperity&#x201D; (17&#x2013;18) (MS: Biblioth&#xE8;que Nationale, Paris; pbd: Rodger L.

TC ended it: &#x201C;Allah is Great; men are not great. (<hi rend="italic">finis,</hi> <date when="1855-10-06">6 October 1855</date>)&#x201D; (66).</note>&#x2014; I kept N.&#x2019;s horse for a week after returning <pb id="pg-30-78" n="30:78"/>hither; and rode diligently with it in spite of the mud: N. took it away last Monday, Sunday ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi> having proved too wet for his visit. We have a great deal of splashy weather for some days past: thunder-showers, sudden gusty deluges, of late; there fell yesterday afternoon such a <hi rend="italic">waterspout</hi> of that kind as I have rarely witnessed for half an hour. I stood sheltered under a grocer&#x2019;s awning in the King&#x2019;s road; two successive Ommibus, shining as if cased in glass, were the only objects that passed.&#x2014; I felt, and feel still, perceptibly improved by my three weeks of solitude and regimen; but there is the sad persuasion that matters will run down again to the old pass. I cannot afford to <hi rend="italic">continue</hi> chasing health; and it will not stay with me on other terms.</p>
<p>I liked well your accounts from Weimar &#x26;c;&#x2014;let me say here, I <hi rend="italic">sent</hi> the Letter, like its predecessor, on to Jean, with request to despatch for Scotsbrig when finished: Mary at the Gill hears of you, too, lately&#x2014;I remember that Sch&#xF6;ll as a rather smart not unpleasant man (pretty like the Book he did on Goethe);<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Gustav Adolf Sch&#xF6;ll, whom TC met at Weimar in <date when="1852-00-00">1852</date> (see <ref target="volume-27/lt-18520920-TC-JWC-01"><sic>27:299</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1852-09-20">20 Sept. 1852</date></corr></ref>, where it is implied he was the current &#x201C;Librarian&#x201D;) He became chief librarian in <date when="1862-00-00">1862.</date></note> the Librarian&#x2019;s laughing face is also present to me: none of the others (unless Goethe&#x2019;s amanuensis is one of them) can I recollect.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The librarian was Ludwig Preller (<date when="1804-00-00">1804</date>&#x2013;<date when="1861-00-00">61</date>), philologist and theologian, he was prof. at universities of Dorpat and Jena before he was appointed librarian, <date when="1847-00-00">1847</date>&#x2013;<date when="1861-00-00">61</date>; he revised the lib.&#x2019;s manuscript catalogue, and was very interested in regional and Goethe studies.

<p>I was charmed to hear of your borrowing the <hi rend="italic">Klein</hi> Volume! That was the most essential Book,&#x2014;properly the one essential, or indispensable, just now. For in these very days I have at last got a <hi rend="italic">Margravine of Bayreuth,</hi>&#x2014;found it on sale for 2/6, and eagerly picked it up. It is the English Translation: so if you have found me a French one, I shall still be glad of it; but otherwise need not in the least mind. <hi rend="italic">Bielefeld</hi> I have read and again read (but a <hi rend="italic">half</hi>-true and rather flimsy piece, after all); when I want to see more of it, the Museum has a copy. <hi rend="italic">Formey</hi> I never saw; but have not learned to consider as very estimable. <hi rend="italic">Klein</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Bayreuth</hi> were the jewels for me; and these I now have.</p>
<p>We are still very quiet here; but the streets are beginning to repeople themselves, and one occasionally meets a known face again. Very wet, as I said. Glen&#x2019;s son, <hi rend="italic">John</hi> (my pension correspondent),<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Glen, for whose mother TC had obtained a civil list pension; see <ref target="volume-28/lt-18530906-TC-MAC-01"><sic>28:261</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1853-09-06">6 Sept. 1853</date></corr></ref>.</note> came hither to me one day, and to tea the same night: a discreet well-mannered young man, not <pb id="pg-30-79" n="30:79"/>with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> intelligence; Darwin<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Erasmus.</note> was here that ev<hi rend="italic">g,</hi> too, and we tried to contrive getting Glen into a sight of &#x201C;the Hospitals&#x201D; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> he was desirous of.

I need not continue it farther, under those conditions. I can only hope you will soon soon be safe home again; up in London probably before long. I think it pity you had not a House, now that you are wealthy and have four boys. Surely it should come to that by and by?&#x2014; I have got no Pipes yet from Edin<hi rend="italic">r,</hi> nor the least answer to a <hi rend="italic">fresh</hi> Note.

<salute>Dear Neuberg,</salute>
<p>There is to be a Library-Committee meeting<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of the London Lib.</note> on Saturday Ev<hi rend="italic">g;</hi> and I mean to get a response concerning those Books of Chelius&#x2019;s:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-29/lt-18541128-TC-JN-01"><sic>29:208</sic><corr>TC to JN, <date when="1854-11-28">28 Nov. 1854</date></corr></ref>.</note> but I have, so far as can yet be made out, entirely lost your Note of them! Search, again and again repeated, will disclose nothing of it: there never was such a &#x201C;Chaos of paper-clippings&#x201D; as this unfortunate garret of mine is growing: yesterday I sought madly for another, more valuable Paper of yours, Copy of Fred<hi rend="italic">k&#x2019;s Journey to Strasburg</hi> (from Voltaire and the <hi rend="italic">Museum,</hi> as I well remember);<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-29/lt-18550622-TC-JN-01"><sic>29:337</sic><corr>TC to JN, <date when="1855-06-22">22 June</date></corr></ref>.</note> and could not find that either. All these are <hi rend="italic">monitions:</hi> &#x201C;Deliver thyself from that unutterable whirlpool, or die mad!&#x201D;&#x2014; &#x2014; You must send me what best <hi rend="italic">reminiscence</hi> you have of Chelius: the price (reduced to English) of the one main article (<hi rend="italic">d&#x2019;Orleans),</hi><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Wolfgang Menzel, <hi rend="italic">Briefe der Prinzessin Elisabeth Charlotte von Orleans an die Raugr&#xE4;fin Louise, <date when="1676-00-00">1676</date>&#x2013;<date when="1722-00-00">1722</date>,</hi> (Stuttgart, <date when="1843-00-00">1843</date>).</note> then the price of all the 4, with <hi rend="italic">titles</hi> of the other 3 the best you have. I will get what answer there can well be on Saturday to such a question.</p>
<p>I know not whether you have yet made any way into that last mass of F<hi rend="italic">k</hi> <pb id="pg-30-80" n="30:80"/>Papers. I wish you would now cut a passage thro&#x2019; them, so soon as you handily can,&#x2014;above all things, <hi rend="italic">annihilate</hi> about &#xBE; of them, and let me have the remaining &#xBC;. I long infinitely to settle some resolution as to those winged masses; and the first step is to <hi rend="italic">see</hi> what I have. Often it comes into my head that <hi rend="italic">fire</hi> (to the whole) w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be the readiest way. Which probably <hi rend="italic">is</hi> their just fate; and may overtake them yet. In that last Batch you have got, I can remember little except descriptions about Gundling,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-28/lt-18530213-TC-SW-01"><sic>28:41</sic><corr>TC to SW, <date when="1853-02-13">13 Feb. 1853</date></corr></ref>.</note> the Tobacco Parliament (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> perhaps are worth something),<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 13:72&#x2013;93.</note> and endless descriptions and <hi rend="italic">repetitions</hi> about Kaiser Karl VI<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charles VI (<date when="1685-00-00">1685</date>&#x2013;<date when="1740-00-00">1740</date>), Holy Roman Emperor from <date when="1711-00-00">1711</date>.</note> and his labours in the <hi rend="italic">Pragmatic-Sanction</hi> Diplomacies.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 13:24&#x2013;27, 144&#x2013;45, 306&#x2013;7.</note> I think there was a thought in me as to that latter business; but it is nowhere expressed well, and is 4 or 5 times expressed <hi rend="italic">ill:</hi> to annihilate all of these except the one <hi rend="italic">best,</hi> and extricate that into legibility, would be a great service done.</p>
<p>I have two glaziers <hi rend="italic">cleaning the window</hi> over my head; they were engaged to come at 3&#xBD; p.m.; but have preferred 9 a.m.: in these circumstances words that can be <hi rend="italic">spared</hi> are not recommendable.</p>

<p>No use calling at Bath House; you are not there on Tuesday, not there on Wednesday; not coming till next week;&#x2014;nay I learn from Lady Sandwich that you are not coming next week either, till Saturday perhaps, or one knows not when. Well, I find it good you should take shelter in the woods till your cold, till your railway confusions go their ways, and you be yourself again: I know one that will rejoice with some reason to get an actual glimpse of you once more, whenever that shall actually be. Lord A<hi rend="italic">n,</hi> it seems, is gone to Paris this day, and you are not going; that is one good thing. I beg you to take care of yourself, and shake away that cold, so soon as may be. The weather is very changeful, and sometimes has a real taste of winter in it already.&#x2014; I sent you a tiny Book, size of a hand at whist, to keep you company in the railway from Loch Luichart;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Ashburtons&#x2019; hunting lodge, Ross and Cromarty, Scotland.</note> but you were gone, as I compute, before it came; and the poor Booklet went wandering over the Highland wildernesses, and never found you nor will: the loss, except to me perhaps, was inconceivably small.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-30-81" n="30:81"/>I did see you, one night lately, in a Dream: strange Nightmare figures, gathered out of various countries and various centuries (Fred<hi rend="italic">k</hi> the Great, Denzill Holles<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Denzil Holles (<date when="1599-00-00">1599</date>&#x2013;<date when="1680-00-00">1680</date>), politician, opponent of Charles I (<date when="1600-00-00">1600</date>&#x2013;<date when="1649-00-00">49</date>).</note> of Charles I&#x2019;s time, God knows why, with many others); most vivid all of them, yet with something of grotesque, of the Nightmare, in all of them, male and female,&#x2014;except your own self, who were brightly beautiful, good and spirit-like, as you have always seemed to me. This Dream was worth something to me;&#x2014;really it is almost the best thing I have done since you last heard: so worthless have all my exertions been, most strenuous activities to no purpose, since I returned to this Penal Weaving-shop, close under the stars here. If I live, I will subdue this raging Chaos a little, and bind the Brandenburg Cerberus<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi>. Cerberus: the three-headed dog that guards the entrance to Hades.</note> in rope of some kind. I must, for I cannot &#x201C;live&#x201D; otherwise!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I find myself to have got a real benefit out of my three weeks at Addiscombe: a kind of awakening at least; the painful consciousness that I <hi rend="italic">am</hi> as good as dead, this at least comes back upon me. Alas, that one is obliged to <hi rend="italic">eat,</hi> and live scurvily in a House of Clay! I think if there were lodging possible otherwise, that would be Heaven enough.&#x2014; I rode about for another week after my return; then gave Neuberg his Horse back; and was a free man,&#x2014;free to glide gradually into the depths again, I doubt, or may well doubt. My unutterable <hi rend="italic">Fred</hi>k is more hopeless, distressing and unmanageable to me than it ever was. Better than Sebastopol and the Russian &#x201C;War of Principle,&#x201D; I often think withal! Truly one had better sit here, and be and do nothing, futiley<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> struggling, in an account-current between God Almighty and oneself,&#x2014;than have an account with Delaine of <hi rend="italic">The Times,</hi> and his and the whole world&#x2019;s loud-voiced Chimerical Blockheadisms,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >After the fall of the Sebastopol, the leading articles in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> were triumphant: victory gave the allies the power to defend &#x201C;the eternal interests of civilisation and of freedom throughout the world&#x201D;; the newspaper supported the continuation of the war saying that it could be ended &#x201C;by principles only&#x201D; (<date when="1855-09-13">13 Sept.</date>). British failure to take the Great Redan, part of Sebastopol&#x2019;s fortifications, of which the Malakhov Tower (successfully taken by the French) was the center, had been reported, <date when="1855-09-10">10 Sept.</date> The extent of the failure and number of casualties were not known until late in Sept., when the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> resumed its long-standing criticism and its call for the resignation of the high command.</note> and be <hi rend="italic">sure</hi> of going to Davy Jones with it all at the last! None of <hi rend="italic">us</hi> has a right to complain:&#x2014;be silent, then. Well, <hi rend="italic">yes</hi>.</p>
<p>But are you not coming to Addiscombe then, before the year quite go? I have always some image of <hi rend="italic">another</hi> week there wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> might be very pretty. But one knows not. I know only there need not be <hi rend="italic">total</hi> want of company there, if her Ladyship pleased to desire it, and found it suitable. I will look patiently into her eyes, and do what her will is so far as I can.</p>
<p>Yesterday I saw Brookfield in the street: he was here some ten days ago; <pb id="pg-30-82" n="30:82"/>gave glowing accounts of Loch Luichart and its ways to my Wife on the ground floor; that also was his topick yesterday during the few minutes we spoke.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Brookfield had been in Scotland, where he had visited the Ashburtons (among others), for a fortnight. He returned to London in late Sept. to &#x201C;his Carlyles, &#x2026; his Alfred Tennyson, and his Thackeray&#x201D; (Brookfield, <hi rend="italic">Circle</hi> 2:420).</note> Thackeray, I suppose, is <hi rend="italic">gone</hi> to America?<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >He sailed from Liverpool, <date when="1855-10-13">13 Oct.</date>, and arrived in Boston, <date when="1855-10-24">24 Oct.</date>, for a lecture tour.</note> A fortnight ago I saw him once for a moment; poor Thackeray:<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thackeray had been ill. This second American tour was to earn money for his daughters&#x2019; financial security. During his <date when="1853-00-00">1853</date> tour, he wrote that &#x201C;the bore and humiliation of delivering these stale old lectures is growing intolerable&#x201D; (Ray 3:245) and it was only to provide for his daughters that he continued &#x201C;this ambulatory quack practice&#x201D; (Ray 3:254).</note> what a life poor mortals have in this world at present,&#x2014;with all loadstars gone out, locker emptyish, and the sea running high!&#x2014;</p>
<p>The Lady Mama<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lady Sandwich.</note> was complaining yesterday, and also the former time, yet looked (especially yesterday) as well as usual, and grew very lively before we had done our dialogue.&#x2014; &#x2014; Well, you must go to Bowood,<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Bowood Park, Wilts., seat of Lord Lansdowne.</note> or whither you are bound; and above all get well, and come back to those that love you, soon.</p>

<p><salute>Dear Neuberg,&#x2014;</salute>I am again upon my <hi rend="italic">Days of the Week,</hi> in which your helping hand w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be useful. The <hi rend="italic">Table</hi> you made me is stuck up against the wall, with inferential Appendages (perfectly correct I find); but it always needs a new <hi rend="italic">calculation</hi> when I wish to shift to another year,&#x2014;and that is painfully <hi rend="italic">dangerous!</hi></p>
<p>In that inclosed Paper is a list of <hi rend="italic">Newyearsdays:</hi> if you could write it fair, <hi rend="italic">confirm</hi> it out of old Magazines at the Museum (and give withal me the <hi rend="italic">29 februaries,</hi> what day of the week <hi rend="italic">they</hi> are, for the leap-years), it would be very useful. If, while our <hi rend="italic">English</hi> &#x201C;Old Style&#x201D; continues (namely till <date when="1752-00-00">1752</date>, I forget in what month) you could translate (and <hi rend="italic">confirm</hi>) into New Style as well (putting N.S. <hi rend="italic">first</hi>), it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be better for Prussian purposes.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Most European countries adopted the New Style calendar earlier than Britain, which changed in <date when="1752-09-00">Sept. 1752</date> when Wed., <date when="1855-09-02">2 Sept.</date>, was followed by Thurs., 14.</note>&#x2014; &#x2014; Paper may be as <hi rend="italic">broad</hi> as you like, but not very much <hi rend="italic">longer</hi> than this,&#x2014;for convenience of <hi rend="italic">posting,</hi> in its right place, on the wall here.</p>
<p>I wish also you w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> look out <hi rend="italic">Bielefeld</hi> for me (while you are at the Museum), and examine in Vol. II p. 44 &#x26;c, where lively account is given of a bombardment of <hi rend="italic">Neisse,</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In Silesia, by the Prussians, <date when="1741-01-19">19</date>&#x2013;<date when="1741-01-22">22 Jan. 1741</date>; see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 15:53&#x2013;59.</note> Which bombard<hi rend="italic">t</hi> it is?&#x2014;namely&#x2014;get me the <hi rend="italic">date</hi> accurately out of Bielfeld (or as accurately as <hi rend="italic">he</hi> gives it): we shall thus work the truth out of him.

<salute>Dear Fitzgerald,</salute>
<p>I will accordingly,&#x2014;as you seem to anticipate, with confidence,&#x2014;leave the Cromwell relic (if it be one, as surely it must after all) wholly to Darkness and to Milnes for the time coming.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Gray, &#x201C;Elegy in a Country Churchyard,&#x201D; st. 1. There had been communication between TC and FitzGerald about a Cromwell autograph, evidently in a book; see <ref target="volume-30/lt-18551029-TC-RMM-01">TC to RMM, <date when="1855-10-29">29 Oct</date></ref>. FitzGerald wrote TC, [<date when="1855-10-21">21 Oct.</date>]: &#x201C;If the Cromwell Autograph be genuine it must be almost as valuable as such things can be, I suppose. If you think &#x2026; that some reverent person should buy this relic, would you mind bidding the owner come to you, ascertaining (which you can do by Eye) the Genuineness of the Writing: and offering for me such a price as you think a reasonable Man should offer for such a thing&#x2014;such as you would offer for yourself &#x2026; you will at least like to see the Writing, if genuine. &#x2026; It would be no use for <hi rend="italic">me</hi> to see the writing, as I could not judge of its Genuineness&#x201D; (Terhune, <hi rend="italic">LEF</hi> 2:186, dated ca. <date when="1855-10-11">11 Oct.</date>).</note> I would not unless excessively rich give above &#xa3;10 for it; I should guess that to be the value, were everything authenticated; which it is not.</p>
<p>Schiller&#x2019;s best Play I fancy is perhaps <hi rend="italic">Tell; Tell,</hi> for ripeness of poetic faculty; <hi rend="italic">Wallenstein</hi> for steady depth of effort: but I cannot altogether deny what you say.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >FitzGerald wrote TC, <date when="1855-10-07">7 Oct.</date>, about &#x201C;reading Schiller&#x2019;s Plays with great Interest&#x2014;for, with whatever faults, one is always in Company of a Noble Soul&#x201D; (Terhune, <hi rend="italic">LEF</hi> 2:185). <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Tell</hi> (<date when="1804-00-00">1804</date>); <hi rend="italic">Wallenstein,</hi> a trilogy (<date when="1798-00-00">1798</date>&#x2013;<date when="1799-00-00">99</date>).</note> In fact the Public, in all countries, is a vulgar Blockhead; and will be found to utter great deal of nonsense, sometimes with a small alloy of truth, at other times with hardly any. Schiller had the enthusiasm, the piety of character, and very much the kind of faculty, which make a Popular Preacher, in our and I doubt not in other countries. That much explains the phenomenon he is in literature, as contrasted with Goethe and others.</p>
<p>Our Beccles Pipe-Artist, I find, must be requested to attend to another <hi rend="italic">vital</hi> point: namely his gigantic pipes, slightly too big in the bowl (not in the <hi rend="italic">stem</hi>),&#x2014;have not <hi rend="italic">breath</hi> enough! That is the result of my experience upon them: too little &#x201C;breath&#x201C;: the <hi rend="italic">bore</hi> of them ought to be made with a thicker bore, as is the case with my Suffolk friends. In fact that is a very bad fault; and sends me back to the Suffolk sort (tho&#x2019; of inferior clay) with great thankfulness to Alfred and Providence.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >FitzGerald told TC, <date when="1855-10-07">7 Oct.</date>, that he had asked Alfred Smith &#x201C;to do for you what I would have done myself had I been still at Farlingay. Only this&#x2014;that, instead of &#x2018;two or three Gross&#x2019; of Churchwardens [clay pipes with long stems] I have desired him to get you sent but <hi rend="italic">one</hi> Gross at first&#x2014;for fear of some mistake about the kind, and for greater security in the Packing&#x201D; and that he would enquire for some the next day in Beccles, E Suffolk. &#x201C;But let me know if&#x2014;and when&#x2014;and how safely&#x2014;the Churchwardings come&#x201D; (Terhune 2:185). In his next letter, [<date when="1855-10-21">21 Oct.</date>], in reply to this letter, he wrote, &#x201C;the Pipe Master I have conferred with, and for whose guidance in future Grosses your letter of Today provides. &#x2026; You must let me know &#x2026; whether I am to employ my Beccles man, the maker of the second Batch, or wait till I go to Woodbridge to see about the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> batch; or, lastly, send to Alfred to give your Directions to the Woodbridge man&#x201D; (Terhune 2:186).</note>&#x2014; Glazed (lead not wax) at the end; slightly <pb id="pg-30-86" n="30:86"/>bigger bore, perceptibly smaller bowl, these Beccles Pipes w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be about the best I have seen: but probably the <foreign><hi rend="italic">Kunstler</hi></foreign> [artist] won&#x2019;t bother himself altering fixed plans; and <hi rend="italic">without</hi> these changes the Woodbridge sort (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> at any rate deserve the name of <hi rend="italic">good,</hi> and more than passable) will be safer for us.</p>
<p>Did you ever read Madame du Deffand&#x2019;s Letters to Horace Walpole?<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Lettres de la Marquise du Deffand &#xE0; Horace Walpole,</hi> 4 vols. (Paris, <date when="1812-00-00">1812</date>). Marie, marquise du Deffand (<date when="1697-00-00">1697</date>&#x2013;<date when="1780-00-00">1780</date>).</note> The character of that old Lady comes out in a very interesting and wholesomely natural way in what she writes there,&#x2014;or rather dictates, for she was blind, and from 70 to 83. I have the Book if you care for it at any time. Few French Memoir-Books of that epoch are as good; nor indeed is the complete meaning of them made clear to us hitherto.</p>
<p>Tell me whenever Naseby <hi rend="italic">is</hi> completed. &#x201C;Pig-driving,&#x201D; I often sorrowfully remark to myself, is one of the needfullest elements in the education of a man!&#x2014;</p>

<p><salute>My dear Brother,&#x2014;</salute>I am very glad of your Note this morning: I had kept thinking about you all that night, about the cold darkness, the missing of that coat, and other sad misses we had made! However, it is all well; as well as it usually is in this poverty-stricken world; and we ought to be thankful.&#x2014; You will have time to meditate a little, at Scotsbrig; and ascertain what you are going to do towards dropping anchor, and closing these pilgrimages into a settlement.</p>
<p>Mrs Fraser came down yesterday to Jane, but I did not see her; nor had she <pb id="pg-30-87" n="30:87"/>any news at all that I heard: only her interest about you, going out and coming in, is always very great.&#x2014; The inclosed Letter also arrived yesterday morning; it will be ready for you on Monday; and that is the swiftest course I can give it.</p>
<p>Farie<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Farie.</note> came down yesterday; very uninteresting, as usual: his merit is, that he knows it, and keeps reasonably out of the way.</p>
<p>We continue the fine weather you left us in; I suppose we have not got into our little &#x201C;St Martin&#x2019;s Summer,&#x201D; the finale of the year; and shall perhaps have a week or two of that mild pensive brightness, with the trees all getting red.&#x2014; I have not been so far as Hyde Park Corner since you went.</p>
<p>The things wanted of Garthwaite<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Tom Garthwaite.</note> are: 3 pairs of warm flannel drawers (<hi rend="italic">good</hi> flannel, above all); certain pairs of trowsers and of winter waist-coats, all of <hi rend="italic">dim</hi>-coloured woollen corduroy (the kind already known), colours steel grey, drab d<hi rend="italic">o,</hi> or brown; cloth extremely <hi rend="italic">supple;</hi> and specimens to be sent. Waistcoats are to have flannel-sleeves and flannel linings; button to the <hi rend="italic">top;</hi>&#x2014;all as formerly. If he find any very <hi rend="italic">thin</hi> supple cord<hi rend="italic">y</hi> (grey or otherwise), they will be welcome in hopes of another summer. Let <hi rend="italic">specimens</hi> be sent in the first place.</p>
<p>I suppose one of your first journeys will be to Dumfries: I hope to hear good news again soon. <closer><salute>My affectionate regards to all.</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Forster,</salute>
<p>That unblessed Affair of the old Lowes, it appears, is going to turn up on us again!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Frances Lowe wrote, <date when="1855-10-20">20 Oct.</date>, that Lady Palmerston had not sent the promised annual sum to her (see <ref target="volume-30/lt-18550704-TC-LST-01">TC to <sic>Lady S</sic><corr>LST</corr>, <date when="1855-07-04">4 July</date></ref>); she reported that she and her sister were well but that they could do no work.</note> Poor old creatures,&#x2014;and yet it certainly was not a job <hi rend="italic">we</hi> had need of just in these years.</p>
<p>I believed firmly Lady Palmerston had <hi rend="italic">done</hi> what was engaged for: I now begin to surmise that this is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> certain at all, and to learn on the whole that <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> will result from flagitating further in that quarter.&#x2014; In fact I believe there will be no <hi rend="italic">finale,</hi> but going into the <hi rend="italic">Times,</hi> as I unluckily hindered you from doing in summer last. I am advised by good judges that this is really the way. <hi rend="italic">Ended,</hi> at all events, this sad thing must be, by one means or other!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Will you return me this poor old Lowe Epistle; and also the Copy of the <pb id="pg-30-91" n="30:91"/>Paper that <hi rend="italic">was</hi> to go into the Newspapers:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For the memorial, see <ref target="volume-29/lt-18550400-TC-DMLP-01"><sic>29:299</sic><corr>TC to DMLP, <date when="1855-04-30">30 April</date></corr></ref>; for the original draft of the letter to the editor of the <hi rend="italic">Times,</hi> see <ref target="volume-29/lt-18550630-TC-EOT-01"><sic>29:346</sic><corr>TC to EOT, <date when="1855-06-30">30 June</date></corr></ref>. TC added to the end of the original draft, presumably at this date: &#x201C;date &#x2014; 1 (?) Nov<hi rend="italic">r</hi> <date when="1855-00-00">1855</date>&#x2014;London / or Athaen<hi rend="italic">m</hi>? (better perhaps; as <hi rend="italic">you</hi> like)&#x201D; (FC).</note> I will try to learn whether I can do no good with them, or indeed what is to be done.&#x2014; I have written to the old Dame for an exact Statement of what resources she now has got,&#x2014;specifying the Palmerston annuities so far as actually <hi rend="italic">performed</hi> (promised we will leave out),&#x2014;up to this date.</p>
<p>God help us, dear Forster! There is a great deal of sorrowful stuff in this world, much ugly scavengerage to do; and we must not grumble to take our share of it on occasion.</p>
<p>Send me the old &#x201C;Memorial&#x201D; or whatever it was, one of these days, then;&#x2014;and pardon and pity me</p>

<salute>Dear Madam,</salute>
<p>This is a fine old German Picture; very probably historically interesting, too; and well deserves to have its secret inquired into.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-30-92" n="30:92"/>My own vague guess, very vague indeed, according to all the indications I can gather, would be:</p>
<p>1<hi rend="italic"><hi rend="superscript">o</hi></hi>. That (perhaps) the Picture is by Lucas Cranach; and that it represents the Three Protestant Heroes of the Schmalkaldic League,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A defensive alliance of the Holy Roman Empire&#x2019;s Protestant states, formed in <date when="1531-00-00">1531</date> to defend the Lutheran churches from Charles V (<date when="1500-00-00">1500</date>&#x2013;<date when="1558-00-00">58</date>), Holy Roman Emperor, <date when="1519-00-00">1519</date>&#x2013;<date when="1556-00-00">56</date>; see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 12:230, 241. The picture is unidentified, but NLS has a watercolor sketch of three bearded men, the central one without a hat; in pencil: &#x201C;Copy of Lucas Cranach / (Uland&#x2019;s) / about <date when="1908-00-00">1908</date>&#x201D;; in ink: &#x201C;copy by Flora Russell of a picture once in the possession of Lady William Russell&#x201D; (MS: NLS 8992.177).</note>&#x2014;all in trouble, like Lucas himself, in the year &#x201C;<date when="1549-00-00">1549</date>,&#x201D; which is legible upon the Picture.</p>
<p>2<hi rend="italic"><hi rend="superscript">o</hi></hi>. That, accordingly, the grey bearded gentleman on the left, with an Electoral bonnet on his head, and one of his gloves off, is (or may be) Johann Friedrich Elector of Saxony,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Johann Friedrich (<date when="1503-00-00">1503</date>&#x2013;<date when="1554-00-00">54</date>), elector of Saxony, Cranach&#x2019;s chief patron.</note> whom Charles V had defeated at Muhlburg (<date when="1547-04-24">24 April 1547</date>); and keeps captive (Lucas mainly with him in volunteer confinement) for five years afterwards. This Elector, Johann Friedrich, was now (since <date when="1548-00-00">1548</date>) an <hi rend="italic">Ex</hi>-Elector;&#x2014;Moritz, of the Younger or Albertine Branch, having got his Electorate from him, which the descendants of Moritz (present King of Saxony) still hold;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Moritz (<date when="1521-00-00">1521</date>&#x2013;<date when="1553-00-00">53</date>), elector of Saxony in the Albertine line (<date when="1547-00-00">1547</date>&#x2013;<date when="1553-00-00">53</date>), supported the Reformation, but on the promise of the Saxon electorship, helped Charles V in his war against Johann Friedrich. Johann (<date when="1801-00-00">1801</date>&#x2013;<date when="1873-00-00">73</date>), king of Saxony, <date when="1854-00-00">1854</date>&#x2013;<date when="1873-00-00">73</date>.</note> poor Johann Friedrich and <hi rend="italic">his</hi> descendants being restricted to Weimar, Gotha, Coburg &#x26;c ever since,&#x2014;one of said descendants, however, having a prospect to be <hi rend="italic">King of England</hi> just now!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Albert Edward (<date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>&#x2013;<date when="1910-00-00">1910</date>; <ref target="volume-30/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/32975"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), prince of Wales, future Edward VII of Britain.</note> I do not at all <hi rend="italic">know</hi> that the figure is Johann Friedrich; nor does anybody here, Portraits of him being scarce (I have an excellent Albert D&#xfc;rer of his <hi rend="italic">Uncle,</hi><note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably Friedrich III (<date when="1463-00-00">1463</date>&#x2013;<date when="1525-00-00">1525</date>), elector of Saxony; called &#x201C;the wise&#x201D;; see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 12:230. For the D&#xfc;rer, see 28:xiii and 372.</note> but never saw <hi rend="italic">him</hi>): all I can say is, his age corresponds to such <hi rend="italic">a beard;</hi> and he clearly at that date was the chief of Protestant men (confined, in danger of his life), and Lucas <hi rend="italic">there</hi> beside him, very <hi rend="italic">ready</hi> for painting him!</p>
<p>3<hi rend="italic"><hi rend="superscript">o</hi></hi>. The middle one I would surmise, on the same principle, might be Philip the Magnanimous, Landgraf of Hessen,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Philip (<date when="1504-00-00">1504</date>&#x2013;<date when="1567-00-00">67</date>), landgrave of Hesse.</note> a most thoroughgoing decisive Defender of Protestantism, against all comers; and now lying in durance for the same Cause as his friend Johann Friedrich.</p>
<p>4<hi rend="italic"><hi rend="superscript">o</hi></hi>. Who the third figure, to the right, with cap on head, and about the age of Philip von Hessen, may be, I cannot even with the same faint degree of plausibility make out to myself: Ernst Duke of Brunswick (the same to whom J<hi rend="italic">n</hi> F<hi rend="italic">h</hi> said, &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Pergamus</hi></foreign> [let us continue]!&#x201D; playing at chess with him, when <pb id="pg-30-93" n="30:93"/>sentence of death was read);<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ernst der Bekenner [Confessor] (<date when="1497-00-00">1497</date>&#x2013;<date when="1546-00-00">1546</date>), duke of Brunswick-L&#xfc;neberg-Celle. TC could not find which duke was playing chess with him, so just refers to &#x201C;a comrade&#x201D;; see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 12:231.</note> Ernst of Brunswick, or else Ulrich Duke of W&#xfc;rtemburg<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ulrich (<date when="1487-00-00">1487</date>&#x2013;<date when="1550-00-00">1550</date>), duke of W&#xfc;rttemberg.</note> (or with much less probability, <hi rend="italic">Moritz</hi> of Saxony) one or other of these;&#x2014;but I never saw a Portrait of either; and so of course am groping greatly in the dark.</p>
<p>It seems to me, besides the date <date when="1549-00-00">1549</date>, there is a faint <hi rend="italic">double-eagle</hi> with a twisted cord in its claws: now I find Charles V struck a medal, 2 years before, with a similar figure on it, <hi rend="italic">triumphing</hi> over the Schmalkaldic League (the &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">laqueus</hi></foreign> [noose]&#x201D; of that is &#x201C;broken&#x201D; &#x26;c, the medal says, double-eagle tearing it): if this of the Picture (just <hi rend="italic">above</hi> the &#x201C;<date when="1549-00-00">1549</date>&#x201D;) be actually a double eagle, and not a mere Painter&#x2019;s flourish, it may point ironically towards the Kaiser&#x2019;s Medal.&#x2014; The words &#x201C;V D M I AE&#x201D; I interpret <hi rend="italic">Viri Digni Memori&#xE4; In AEternum</hi><note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Great men are remembered forever; see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 12:230.</note> (your Ladyship knows Latin);&#x2014;and this is really all I have to say, even in the way of faintest guess, upon this old <foreign><hi rend="italic">Kunstwerk</hi></foreign> [work of art].</p>
<p>But it ought to be made out with certainty! If you will let me keep the Picture for another fortnight, I can have a <hi rend="italic">correct</hi> Photograph taken of it; and by sending a Copy or two of that to the right places in Germany, it seems possible we might get a decisive account of the matter.&#x2014; <closer><salute>I remain always,</salute></closer></p>

<p>Thanks to you again; certainly you are the helpfullest of men! A pleasure to meet with, in such promptitude and generous alacrity, in the muddy thoroughfares of this world!&#x2014; I really am much obliged to you.</p>
<p>I return <hi rend="italic">you</hi> the Paper, to mend and scrape clean where you see proper, and then to send immediately to its ultimate destination,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Lowe appeal for the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>.</note> that so we may have done with it. I cannot doubt but the money will be got: at any rate if we fail at Coutts&#x2019;s Bank and thro&#x2019; the Times, we can <hi rend="italic">then</hi> set to dunning private people; and a single rich person, or a couple, could at once do the business. But I do not expect we shall be driven to that.</p>
<p>I have another Missive yesterday from the poor old Miss Lowe: not the slightest object<hi rend="italic">n</hi> to a &#x201C;Public Subscription&#x201D;;&#x2014;for the rest, does <hi rend="italic">not</hi> tell me whether Lady Palmerston performed her promise or not: in fact it jumps wildly about, like a kangaroo, this Epistle, and does not definitely lead one anywhither.&#x2014; I have got my Wife to engage to go out tomorrow; and overhaul the Lowe business to the foundation, take it off my hands at least; and see what can or should be done with it.</p>
<p>I have said in that Paper &#x201C;Annuity of &#xa3;30&#x201D; (not &#xa3;40 as the old Dame says) &#xa3;30 will make their income about &#xa3;100 a year;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The appeal raised enough for an annuity of &#xa3;38; see vol. 31 and James Boswell, <hi rend="italic">The Life of Samuel Johnson,</hi> ed.

<salute>Dear Lady Stanley,</salute>
<p>My poor old women out at New Cross (Johnson&#x2019;s God-daughters whom you too well remember) have suddenly begun to shriek upon me again. Much to my amazement,&#x2014;not much to my comfort, or furtherance in the work I have. But I begin to perceive that, to all appearance, Lady Palmerston has been oblivious,&#x2014;has not only done nothing of her <hi rend="italic">half</hi>-promise (to &#x201C;see what <hi rend="italic">could</hi> be done&#x201D; &#x26;c), but nothing even of her whole promise (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> she yielded to your charitable dunning last summer, and which you expressly announced to the poor old woman);&#x2014;and in fine that her Ladyship is hopeless on this matter, and ought to be left alone of it henceforth.</p>
<p>Do not write to her, therefore, nor speak to her, again at all upon the matter,&#x2014;permit <hi rend="italic">me</hi> at least expressly to forbid any farther activity in that direction. I am truly sorry for the trouble you already had; tho&#x2019; that, as a work of kindness (recorded in Heaven&#x2019;s chancery, and in some earthly memories too) cannot be considered as lost labour. But I write merely lest you be surprised to see the Lowe Business all committed to <hi rend="italic">The Times,</hi> and figuring there, one of these mornings; whither it is now again bound, and whereby (surely to Heaven!) it will now at last end, and make us all rid of it!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I have not been out of these Southern parts since you went away; hardly above a month in the Country altogether: I have now got into my Garret again, and lighted my fire, with the intention of trying another spell of <hi rend="italic">navvy</hi> work, and whether I am to break <hi rend="italic">its</hi> back or it my heart;&#x2014;that is the alternative. <closer><salute>I beg your Ladyship&#x2019;s prayers, and forgivenness, I do indeed; and am</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Milnes,</salute>
<p>The inscription on that &#x201C;Cromwell&#x201D; Book is evidently of the 17<hi rend="italic">th</hi> century;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-30/lt-18551020-TC-EF-01">TC to EF, <date when="1855-10-20">20 Oct.</date></ref></note> nor is it easy to see why anybody should <hi rend="italic">forge</hi> a sentiment or signature of Oliver at that time. Nevertheless I could by no means undertake to certify that the writing is Oliver&#x2019;s (or consequently that the Book ever was his); the <hi rend="italic">reverse</hi> rather, till evidence arrive, seems probable or possible. The signature or writing does <hi rend="italic">not</hi> resemble my remembrance of Oliver&#x2019;s; it seems likewise <pb id="pg-30-96" n="30:96"/>questionable whether Oliver would put down such a sentiment on the fly-leaf of a Book. I could not pretend to <hi rend="italic">deny</hi> either, for my remembrance of the Oliver <hi rend="italic">Mss</hi>. is growing fainter and fainter; but till proof (by <hi rend="italic">Experts</hi> in the Museum or otherwise) I should be in doubt, tending towards denial. Perhaps some <hi rend="italic">man</hi> of Oliver&#x2019;s (Chaplain Sterry, Clerk Maidstone,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably Peter Sterry (d. <date when="1672-00-00">1672</date>), Cromwell&#x2019;s chaplain, and John Maidston, see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 6:17.</note> or the like) who had <hi rend="italic">heard</hi> Oliver express himself to that effect, and in admiration of the sentiment wrote it down there?&#x2014; This on the whole is my likeliest surmise.</p>
<p>For the rest, it seemed to me a very pious, deep and genial kind of <hi rend="italic">Book;</hi> very rare too, they say;&#x2014;and has almost certainly belonged to Oliver&#x2019;s environment, if not to Oliver.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The book is unidentified.</note> The two Book binders, who have it, I take to be perfectly honest persons. Whether, on these terms, it is not still worth &#xa3;8 to an opulent man of your tastes,&#x2014;<foreign><hi rend="italic">soll schweben</hi></foreign> [it hangs in the balance]. Fitzgerald was for buying it at &#xa3;10 (the people at first asked &#xa3;40!)&#x2014;but that was on the hypothesis of its being indisputably Oliverian; which, as matters stand, it certainly is not. This is all I can say on the affair.</p>
<p>It will much beseem you to come and see whether I am dead or alive here, after so many adventures; and the sight of your face will be illuminative to everybody in these premises. I cannot say I envy you your chaotic conferences at Crewe;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Crewe Hall, Chester, home of Milnes&#x2019;s brother-in-law, Hungerford, Lord Crewe (<date when="1812-00-00">1812</date>&#x2013;<date when="1893-00-00">93</date>), 3d baron; the Milneses were visiting; see Reid, <hi rend="italic">RMM</hi> 1:524.</note> but I should like well to go whither my Letter is going, could I travel as easily, and were the season younger. I must &#x201C;invade Silesia&#x201D; instead: woe is me!&#x2014; &#x2014; A huge &#x201C;republic of the Mediocrities,&#x201D; this modern world; which tho&#x2019; a very quiet, is a dreadful and even damnable fact, if you will think of it well.</p>
<p>The Johnson&#x2019;s Goddaughter case is to come into <hi rend="italic">The Times</hi> after all; Palmerstonian bounty proving ineffectual, there is no other course for behoof of the poor old creatures. In the pettiest Germany Duchy, in Sachsen-Meiningen or Lippe-B&#xfc;ckeburg, had any of these territories been honoured to produce a Johnson, the Gov<hi rend="italic">t</hi> could have been so much a gentleman as to do this thing: in enormous potbellied England it is otherwise; and there is no remedy to be dreamt of at present.</p>
<p><closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Milnes. I must not waste my own small fragment of time, nor any more of yours today. Come and see me next week, according to y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> charitable purpose.

<p><salute>Sir,&#x2014;</salute>The following document, and the proposal or appeal now grounded on it, require to be made known to the British public, for which object we, as the course is, apply to the Editor of <hi rend="italic">The Times</hi>.</p>
<p>In the month of May last there was presented to Lord Palmerston, as head of Her Majesty&#x2019;s Government, a memorial on behalf of a certain aged Miss Lowe and her sister,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-29/lt-18550513-TC-JF-01"><sic>29:310&#x2013;11</sic><corr>TC to JF, <date when="1855-05-13">13 May</date></corr></ref>.</note> which memorial will sufficiently explain itself, and indicate who the Misses Lowe are, to those who read it here:&#x2014;</p>
<p>&#x201C;The undersigned beg respectfully to submit to Lord Palmerston a statement of reasons which appear to them to constitute, on behalf of the two aged surviving daughters of Mauritius Lowe, therein described, a claim to such small yearly pension as in his Lordship&#x2019;s judgment may consist with other claims and demands for the ensuing year, upon the fund appropriate to literature.</p>
<p>In Dr. Samuel Johnson&#x2019;s last Will is this passage,&#x2014;&#x2018;I also give and bequeath to my godchildren, the son and daughter of Mauritius Lowe, painter, each of them 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of my stock in the Three per Cent. Consolidated Annuities, to be disposed of by and at the discretion of my executors in the education or settlement in the world of them my said legatees.&#x2019;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For the full text of the will, see <hi rend="italic">Boswell&#x2019;s Life of Johnson</hi> 4:402&#x2013;4.</note></p>
<p>The Mauritius Lowe mentioned here, who was once a man of great promise in his art, favourably known in the Royal Academy and in the world as a man of refined manners and real talent and worth (though probably with something of morbid or over-sensitive in his character), died 10 years after Johnson without fulfilling the high hopes entertained of him. The godson, or younger Lowe, mentioned in the will, who at one time (<date when="1810-00-00">1810</date>&#x2013;<date when="1813-00-00">13</date>) appears to have held some small appointment in Barbadoes, creditably to himself, but with loss of health&#x2014;the crown and consummation of various other losses he had met with&#x2014;is also long since dead. Of these Lowes and their hopes and struggles there is now nothing to be said. They are sunk under the horizon. Nor can they pretend to have any hold of the world&#x2019;s memory except what is derived from the father&#x2019;s intimacy with Johnson, of which and of Johnson&#x2019;s helpfulness and real esteem and affection for the man there are still abundant proofs, printed and not printed, besides this of the Will.</p>
<p>But the goddaughter mentioned in the will has not yet sunk under the horizon. She still survives among us, a highly respectable old person, now in <pb id="pg-30-98" n="30:98"/>her 78th year, with all her faculties about her, living with her younger sister, aged 72, the only other remnant of the family, in a house they have long occupied&#x2014;No. 5, Minerva-place, New-cross, Deptford&#x2014;with numerous memorials of Johnson in their possession,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Other than the desk (see <ref target="volume-29/lt-18550615-TC-JF-01"><sic>29:332</sic><corr>TC to JF, <date when="1855-06-15">15 June</date></corr></ref>), untraced.</note> which vividly bring home to us and present as a still living fact, their connexion with that great man. They have lived there for many years in rigorous though not undignified poverty, which now, by some unforeseen occurrences, threatens to become absolute indigence in these their final years.</p>
<p>They are gentlewomen in manners; by all evidence, persons of uniformly unexceptionable conduct; veracity, sense, ingenious propriety, noticeable in them both, to a superior degree. The elder, especially, must have been a graceful lively little woman, something of a beauty in her younger days, and by no means wanting for talent. She still recollects in a dim but ineffaceable manner the big, awful figure of Samuel Johnson, to whom she was carried shortly before his death, that he might lay his hand on her head and give her his blessing; her awe and terror very great on the occasion.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Apparently told TC by Ann Lowe, as written evidence of the incident is untraced.</note> Both sisters are in perfect possession of their faculties&#x2014;the younger only is slightly hard of hearing; the elder (on whose head lay Johnson&#x2019;s hand) has still a light step, perfectly erect carriage, and vivacious memory and intellect. The younger, who is of very honest and somewhat sterner features, appears to be the practical intellect of the house, and probably the practical hand. They are very poor, but have taken their poverty in a quiet, unaffectedly handsome manner, and have still hope that, in some way or other, intolerable want will not be permitted to overtake them. They have an altogether respectable, or, we might say (bringing the past and the present into contact), a touching and venerable air. There, in their little parlour at Deptford, is the fir desk (capable of being rigorously authenticated as such) upon which Samuel Johnson wrote the <hi rend="italic">English Dictionary;</hi> the best dictionary ever written, say some.</p>
<p>It is in behalf of these two women, of Johnson&#x2019;s goddaughter fallen old and indigent, that we venture to solicit from the Government some small public subvention, to screen their last years from the worst misery. It may be urged that there is no public fund appropriated for such precise objects, and that their case cannot, except in a reflex way, be brought under the head of &#x2018;literary pensions&#x2019;: but, in a reflex way, it surely can; and we humbly submit withal, that this case of theirs is, in some measure, a peculiar and unique one.</p>
<p>Samuel Johnson is such a literary man as probably will not appear again in England for a very great length of time. His works and his life, looked at well, have something in them of heroic, which is of value beyond most literature, and much beyond all money and money&#x2019;s worth to the nation which produced <pb id="pg-30-99" n="30:99"/>him. That same <hi rend="italic">English Dictionary,</hi> written on the poor fir desk above spoken of, under sternly memorable circumstances, is itself a proud possession to the English nation, and not in the philological point of view alone. Such a dictionary has an <hi rend="italic">architectonic</hi> quality in it; and for massive solidity of plan, manful correctness and fidelity of execution, luminous intelligence, rugged honesty and greatness of mind pervading every part of it, is like no other.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In TC&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Heroes,</hi> Johnson is the &#x201C;Hero as Man of Letters.&#x201D; For a similar description of the dictionary, see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 5:183.</note> This, too, is a <hi rend="italic">Cathedral of St. Paul&#x2019;s,</hi> after its sort;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. the memorial to Sir Christopher Wren (<date when="1632-00-00">1632</date>&#x2013;<date when="1723-00-00">1723</date>) in St. Paul&#x2019;s Cathedral: &#x201C;Si monumentum requiris, circumspice [If you would see a monument, look around].&#x201D;</note> and stands there for long periods, silently reminding every English soul of much that is very necessary to remember.</p>
<p>Samuel Johnson himself is far beyond the reach of our gratitude. He left no child or representative of any kind to claim pensions or distinctions from us; and here, by accident, thrown upon the waste seabeach, is something venerably human with Johnson&#x2019;s mark still legible upon it; Johnson, as it were, mutely bequeathing it to us, and to what humanity and loyalty we have, for the few years that may still be left. Our humble request, in the name of literature withal is, that the English nation will, in some small adequate way, respond to this demand of Johnson&#x2019;s.</p>

<p>It was still hoped that the last resource of an appeal to the public might be avoided; that there might be other Government helps, minute charitable funds, adequate to this small emergency. And new endeavours were accordingly made in that direction, and new expectations entertained; but these likewise have all proved ineffectual: and the resulting fact now is, that there is still needed something like an annuity of 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the joint lives of these two aged persons; that, strictly computing what pittances certain and precarious they already have, and what they still want, their case cannot be satisfactorily left on lower terms&#x2014;that is to say, about 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., to purchase such an annuity, is still needed for them.</p>
<p>If the thing is half as English as we suppose it to be, a small pecuniary result of that kind is not doubtful, now when the application is once made. At all events, as the English Government is not able to do this thing, we are now bound to apprise the English nation of it, and to ask the English nation in its miscellaneous capacity&#x2014;Are you willing to do it?<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The total received was &#xa3;305 19s. 6d. (see <hi rend="italic">Times,</hi> <date when="1856-05-12">12 May 1856</date>).</note></p>
<p>Messrs. Coutts, bankers, will receive subscriptions from such as feel that this is a valid call upon English beneficence; and we have too much reverence for Samuel Johnson, and for the present generation of his countrymen, to use any soliciting or ignoble pressure on the occasion. So soon as the requisite amount has come in, the subscriptions will cease; of which due notice will be given.</p>

<p>I am sorry to hear you still complain of health; bad health is a very miserable adjunct to one&#x2019;s burden, tho&#x2019; not an uncommon one to poor wretches of <pb id="pg-30-102" n="30:102"/>this craft! <foreign><hi rend="italic">Festina lent&#xE8;</hi></foreign> [make haste, slowly],<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Suetonius; see <ref target="volume-03/lt-18240125-TC-JBW-01"><sic>3:23</sic><corr>TC to JBW, <date when="1824-01-25">25 Jan. 1824</date></corr></ref>.</note> don&#x2019;t work <hi rend="italic">too much</hi> (which proves always <hi rend="italic">too little</hi> by and by): that is the one way of procuring some abatement, if abolition of the misery is not possible.</p>

<p>Furthermore I got the <hi rend="italic">Goethe</hi> the other night,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">The Life and Works of Goethe,</hi> 2 vols., pbd. <date when="1855-11-01">1 Nov.</date> Lewes emphasized Goethe&#x2019;s genius as both artist and scientist. Goethe worshiped &#x201C;Art,&#x201D; which he believed was &#x201C;a sister of Religion, by whose aid the great world-scheme was wrought into reality,&#x201D; but he was also a man of &#x201C;fact&#x201D; who &#x201C;thought reality in itself holier than any fiction could make it&#x201D; (1:188, 2:394). John Tyndall (<date when="1820-00-00">1820</date>&#x2013;<date when="1893-00-00">93</date>; <ref target="volume-30/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/27948"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>) discussed the biography with TC at the Grange in <date when="1855-12-00">Dec.</date> and reported that he &#x201C;was disposed to commend the <hi rend="italic">Life</hi> as the best we had, but he was far from regarding it as adequate&#x201D; (Wilson, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi> 5:207).</note> almost at the same time with your Note. Every night since, in my reading hours, I am dashing athwart it in every direction; <hi rend="italic">truanting;</hi> for I yet wait a time to read the work with such deliberation as I well see it deserves. My conviction is, we have here got an excellent Biography,&#x2014;altogether transcendently so, as Biographies are done in this country. Candid, well-informed, clear, free-flowing, it will certainly throw a large flood of light over Goethe&#x2019;s Life, and over many German things which multitudes in England have been curious about, to little purpose, for a long while. It ought to have a large circulation, if one can predict or anticipate in regard to such matters. On the whole, I say <foreign><hi rend="italic">Euge</hi></foreign> [well done], and that heartily,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; dissenting here and there.

<p><salute>Dear Forster,&#x2014;</salute>I received both your Notes; recognising well your prompt assiduity; and have seen <hi rend="italic">The Times</hi> of Thursday,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1855-11-01">1 Nov.</date>, with the appeal for the Lowe sisters.</note>&#x2014;at least my Wife has, I <hi rend="italic">finding the place</hi> for her in it.</p>
<p>That of Defoe was very unlucky; unlucky too that there was no conspicuous <hi rend="italic">Heading</hi> to the thing: it struck me many must have missed it altogether, for I had some difficulty to find it when warned. Our illustrious &#x201C;Contemporary&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably Robert Lowe, who had placed Walter Savage Landor&#x2019;s appeal letter, headed &#x201C;A DESCENDANT OF DEFOE,&#x201D; three columns to the left of the Lowe appeal, which did not have a heading (<hi rend="italic">Times,</hi> <date when="1855-11-01">1 Nov.</date>). Landor cited Forster&#x2019;s &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Life of Defoe,</hi>&#x201D; presumably <hi rend="italic">Charles Churchill and Daniel De Foe</hi> (<date when="1855-00-00">1855</date>), reprinted with additions from his &#x201C;Charles Churchill&#x201D; and &#x201C;Daniel Defoe,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review</hi> (Jan. and <date when="1845-10-00">Oct. 1845</date>): &#x201C;&#x2018;there is now living at Kennington, in deep, though uncomplaining poverty, James Defoe, the great-grandson,&#x2019; &#x26;c. &#x2026; Let our novelists, now the glory of our literature, remember their elder brother Daniel, and calculate &#x2026; what they owe him. &#x2026; Let all contribute one penny for a year; poor James has lived 77, and his dim eyes cannot look far into another.&#x201D; Daniel Defoe (<date when="1661-00-00">1661</date>?&#x2013;<date when="1731-00-00">1731</date>), journalist and novelist.</note> might have done much better, had he liked.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-30-104" n="30:104"/>However there came to me &#xa3;5 next day (which is still here, but shall be in Coutts&#x2019;s tomorrow): by way of help to some of these defects I have tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> of announcing that small fact;&#x2014;here is the small Note to <hi rend="italic">The Times;</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-30/lt-18551104-TC-EOT-01">TC to <sic>Editor of the <hi rend="italic">Times,</hi></sic><corr>EOT,</corr> <date when="1855-11-04">5 [4] Nov.</date></ref></note> seal and despatch, if you approve.</p>
<p>For the rest, I will not investigate at Cotts&#x2019;s<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For &#x201C;Coutts&#x2019;s.&#x201D;</note> tomorrow; but do you pray, next day.

<p>But before <hi rend="italic">printing</hi> these, let us meet, as you propose: Wednesday 4&#xBD; p.m.,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1855-11-07">7 Nov.</date></note> at the Athenaeum (reading room),&#x2014;if you answer <hi rend="italic">nothing,</hi> will hold that for fixed.</p>

<salute>Dear Dickens,</salute>
<p>Coming home from you,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >From the Athenaeum.</note> the suggestion of our civic Friend,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Forster, as he was at the meeting.</note> to have a Subscription Book at Prescott&#x2019;s in the City,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Prescott, Grote, &#x26; Co., bankers, 62 Threadneadle St.; see <ref target="volume-30/lt-18551115-TC-JF-01">TC to JF, <date when="1855-11-15">15 Nov.</date></ref></note> rose on me again; and it took a rather different aspect. I said to myself:</p>
<p>Of course a man with money <hi rend="italic">can</hi> pay it at Cotts&#x2019;s,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS, for &#x201C;Coutts&#x2019;s.&#x201D;</note> if he is perceptibly in the faintest degree resolute upon the subject: but if he is only <hi rend="italic">im</hi>perceptibly &#x201C;resolute&#x201D;; hanging in the wind, like a brown leaf at this season,&#x2014;capable of being turned either way; his poor conscience perhaps glad of an excuse which will save both trouble and money? And is not this perhaps the case with a great many lukewarm people, who would fain &#x201C;subscribe,&#x201D; and also would fain <hi rend="italic">not,</hi> as is the way with poor human nature?&#x2014; A man with the smallest call of <hi rend="italic">business</hi> to pay money at Coutts&#x2019;s, he is like a wheel on an inclined plane, <pb id="pg-30-108" n="30:108"/>and will gravitate victoriously against all obstacles; a man thinking to subscribe, he is like a wheel, slightly, most slightly propelled upon a perfectly horizontal smooth plane, and a grain of sand is capable of stopping him!&#x2014; &#x2014; This was my soliloquy; which I send you. If there be any difficulty at all in opening a City Book, if it hurt the <hi rend="italic">symmetry</hi> of our procedure, if it will do or threaten us any mischief; that is another affair. But if that is not in any measure so (which I do not by any means affirm, or in the least know),&#x2014;then why not indulge poor weak brethren with their City Bank? In wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> case I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> vote for Prescott&#x2019;s, were it only in the hope of getting five pounds from the &#x201C;Historian of Greece,&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Grote, <hi rend="italic">History of Greece,</hi> 12 vols. (<date when="1846-00-00">1846</date>&#x2013;<date when="1856-00-00">56</date>); 11 already pbd. His father was a founder of the firm.</note>&#x2014;more power to his elbow.</p>
<p>Do not answer this; speak of it to Forster and decide Yes or No with him. In fact it is you two alone who can be supposed to have judgement on it: and except the above notions put as queries, my very thoughts fall dumb upon the subject. You will write tomorrow; but not on this.</p>
<p>Here is a new Letter since I got home: &#xa3;5 in it, which money likewise I enclose, since you are to be at the Bank tomorrow and I not. Please pay it in, under the Title written in the other Note, &#x201C;Anonymous, West<hi rend="italic">r</hi>&#x201D; &#x26;c that we may be able to discriminate it. If I get one or two more such Letters, and there is need of a new fillip in <hi rend="italic">The Times,</hi> they can be announced there, to spite Common Sense and Father of a Family, all at once.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In a letter to the <hi rend="italic">Times,</hi> <date when="1855-11-03">3 Nov.</date>, &#x201C;A Constant Reader&#x201D; asked why the nineteen signatories of &#x201C;the somewhat pompous memorial to Lord Palmerston &#x2026; did not at once contribute the required sum, without troubling the public for such a trifle,&#x201D; a shilling a week from each would be enough. &#x201C;Father of a Family&#x201D; is untraced. &#x201C;Common Sense&#x201D; wrote: &#x201C;Two guineas a year from each of them will render Johnson&#x2019;s god-daughter and her sister comfortable during the poor remnant which remains to them.&#x201D; They should &#x201C;pay that sum and say no more. &#x2026; There is a risk of making charity ridiculous&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Times,</hi> <date when="1855-11-06">6 Nov.</date>). The <hi rend="italic">Athenaeum,</hi> <date when="1855-11-03">3 Nov.</date>, had pbd. a critical response to the Lowe appeal, contrasting it with the Defoe appeal (see <ref target="volume-30/lt-18551104-TC-JF-01">TC to JF, <date when="1855-11-04">4 Nov.</date></ref>): &#x201C;Mr. Landor rests the claim of James Defoe to the sympathies and assistance of the public on the literary services of his ancestor:&#x2014;a solid ground of sympathy, no doubt; and as soon as we shall see a way by which the schoolboy&#x2019;s pennies can be collected from the multitudinous readers of &#x2018;Robinson Crusoe,&#x2019; we will lend our aid, such as it is, to the realization of Mr. Landor&#x2019;s benevolent desire. The case of the Misses Lowe is different. As &#x2018;altogether respectable&#x2019; aged Ladies &#x2026; , living in &#x2018;rigorous but not undignified poverty,&#x2019; their claims on the charitable may be strong, for anything we know, but the literary ground of appeal fails in this case absolutely. &#x2026; In this course, the Minister, in our opinion, acted with good sense. If any Lady Bountiful should please to extend to the Misses Lowe on other grounds a part of her superfluous wealth, everybody will rejoice. But we object to the circulation of the hat in the name of Literature.&#x201D;</note></p>
<p>Well, this is &#xa3;20 I have <hi rend="italic">heard of</hi> today, besides our own Fifteen, and the pocketful of melting stamps. My own guess is, London is not nearly yet <pb id="pg-30-109" n="30:109"/>exhausted;&#x2014;and there is the California of Lichfield<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Meaning money to come from there; see <ref target="volume-30/lt-18551104-TC-JF-01">TC to JF, <date when="1855-11-04">4 Nov.</date></ref></note> in the rear. What are we afraid of!</p>
<p><closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Dickens; come soon back to us,<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >He was returning to Paris, where he and his family were passing the winter.</note> and let me see you then.

<salute>Dear Blackie,</salute>
<p>I read your Pamphlet last night, with lively entertainment and satisfaction; with perfect assent to all that you advance on the lost and abject state of what is called &#x201C;University&#x201D; Education in Scotland.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">On the Advancement of Learning in Scotland: A Letter to the &#x2026; Lord Provost and the Town Council of Edinburgh, Patrons of the University</hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1855-00-00">1855</date>). In it, Blackie, prof. of Greek at Edinburgh Univ., attacked the parochialism of Scottish education and called &#x201C;for learning in the widest &#x2026; sense&#x201C;: Greek and Latin, but also Sanscrit and Icelandic; language, but also the history of art and of social revolution. He wanted scholarship with &#x201C;a large human soul&#x201D; that finds &#x201C;contact with all the great intellectual and moral movements of the age&#x201D; (10). He mentions TC as one of the notable literary names (12) and says that the English &#x201C;classical scholar&#x201D; may be &#x201C;one of those grand shams with which Thomas Carlyle declares that the present age, above all recent ages, and the English country, above all European countries, is so outrageously befooled&#x201D; (9).</note> You have told the poor Public there a good few home truths, such as they are not nearly often enough in the habit of hearing,&#x2014;nay have not heard at all for a couple of generations back; the more is their misfortune, poor potbellied blockheads, drinking &#x201C;the Cause of Education&#x201D; at public dinners, and asking all men, &#x201C;Did you ever know such a Country for Education?&#x201D; In a way disgusting to behold. For what I got in Scotland from my Father and Mother I am grateful, beyond all other gratitude, while the breath of life, or the power of reflexion remains in me: but as to my Scotch Schools and Schoolmasters, from Edinburgh downwards, I deliberately say, If one will avoid denunciation and execration, there is nothing to be said! A more inconceivable &#x201C;University&#x201D; than Edinburgh then was to me I have never heard tell of. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Altum silentium</hi></foreign> [deep silence]! Expressive in silence alone can meditate its praise, as I then knew it: enough, enough!</p>
<p>So far I go with you; and thank you with all my heart for the useful, unpleasant, and (I warn you!) even dangerous service you have done. Of which I <hi rend="italic">will,</hi> by and by, hope some results. The thickest coat of whale-blubber does yield at last to harpooning long continued in that style, and the point at last brings blood;&#x2014;I leave you to think, with what humour on the whale&#x2019;s part! Take care of the whale withal; that is needful for you withal.</p>
<p>For the rest, I own to you, Germany, with its abstruse Hermeneutics, mountains of classical marine stores, and high-towered Edifices built of metaphysical bladders, is by no means the result I want to rival in matter of education.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Blackie wrote: &#x201C;No person in Germany ever thinks of looking to a Scottish University for any work of profound learning or original research&#x201D; (13). He wrote that he advised his best students &#x201C;to go to some German University for at least one session &#x2026; that they may know what scholarship is&#x201D; (16&#x2013;17).</note> Oh Heaven, no, <foreign><hi rend="italic">nimmermehr</hi></foreign> [never more]. A more entirely <pb id="pg-30-111" n="30:111"/>worthless flaccid specimen of the genus &#x201C;Solemnly Ineffective Blockhead&#x201D; is not to be met with than in common German Universities. Oh, their Books, their Histories, that I have had to read by the cartload in past years: <hi rend="italic">Chaos</hi> and <foreign><hi rend="italic">Limbus Patrum</hi></foreign> [limbo of the fathers], that is the home of such Books, and such Intellects, and ways of looking at God&#x2019;s Universe!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Nay, deeper still, and almost fearful to contemplate, I have often asked myself, Whether the <hi rend="italic">next</hi> set of really good Schoolmasters the world got w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not perhaps be altogether <hi rend="italic">silent</hi> ones,&#x2014;of the rhadamanthine drill-serjeant nature?&#x2014; But I will not speak of this. I will with all my heart wish you <hi rend="italic">speed</hi> in this charge upon the enemy (who is mine and all men&#x2019;s), and thank you very much for what you have done.</p>
<closer><salute>Yours sincerely from of old</salute></closer>
<name>T. Carlyle</name>
<ps><p>P.S. I wish you would not say &#x201C;ripe&#x201D; &#x201C;unripe&#x201D; &#x26;c, or at least not <hi rend="italic">often,</hi> in reference to boys and men.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Blackie wrote, &#x201C;Unripe boys &#x2026; are hastily drafted into the highest seminaries meant for the education of fully developed young men on the verge of a ripe and vigorous manhood&#x201D; (22), and referred to the &#x201C;just claims of the riper young men&#x201D; (51).</note> &#x201C;A scholar and a ripe one&#x201C;: I could hardly quite pardon that when I first heard it; and now it has been so handed about among the street populace, and flung in one&#x2019;s face, it smells of rotten apples &#x26; worse. That is really my unfortunate feeling. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Verbum Sapienti<supplied>[ae]</supplied></hi></foreign> [a word to the wise].</p></ps>

<salute>Dear Lady,</salute>
<p>Your Letter to Jane lay on the table when I came down this morning, late for breakfast: thank you heartily for that same. I know not whether she has answered it, or what she has said; she is now out to &#x201C;hear a Lecture,&#x201C;&#x2014;Lecture from Lord John who is to perform this day at Exeter Hall, to certain &#x201C;Young men,&#x201D; and try if he can &#x201C;improve&#x201D; them a little.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lord John Russell. See <ref target="volume-30/lt-18551114-JWC-LA-01">JWC to <sic>Lady A</sic><corr>LA</corr>, [<date when="1855-11-14">14 Nov.</date>]</ref>.</note> All the world assisting, and great press for Tickets,&#x2014;Wedgwoods (of whose party Jane is) hardly hoping they will all get in to hear the little dear. Poor little dear, I am told they hissed him at the Mansion House,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The lord mayor&#x2019;s residence. The <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> reported that at the banquet for the new lord mayor, David Salomons (<date when="1797-00-00">1797</date>&#x2013;<date when="1873-00-00">1873</date>; <ref target="volume-30/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/24562"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), &#x201C;mingled cheers and hisses&#x201D; almost drowned out Russell&#x2019;s few sentences of congratulation (<date when="1855-11-10">10 Nov.</date>).</note> the other day; hissed extensively, twice over, both at beginning and ending,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; why <hi rend="italic">now</hi> they should hiss more than at any time for the last 30 years, is not evident to me. In short Jane is <pb id="pg-30-113" n="30:113"/>gone towards that sad enterprise (will fail to get in, one may hope!),&#x2014;and I, in great haste, and with a terrible headache and much else against me, will write one word myself.</p>
<p>You do not <hi rend="italic">doubt</hi> but we are willing, and some of us thrice willing, to come to The Grange? No that is beyond &#x201C;doubt,&#x201D; now and at all times. But the question, How? There is a really intricate problem; almost insoluble, I often think, except to the best head in the world,&#x2014;which now, thank Heaven, seems to be occupied with it. What can I say? I hate loud large meetings, especially of the kind called Literary: Oh Heaven, Tom Taylor &#x26; C<hi rend="italic">o</hi> (a most extensive firm<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Taylor&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">A Nice Firm</hi> was performed at the Lyceum, <date when="1853-11-16">16 Nov. 1853</date>.</note> at this epoch) furnished richly with the talent of utterance, and with nothing in them but the <hi rend="italic">absence</hi> of knowledge &#x26; of wisdom to utter,&#x2014;careering with outspread wings (in <hi rend="italic">Punch</hi> and elsewhere) on the top of popular delirium, discharging <hi rend="italic">that</hi> sad function of giving dumb stupidity a voice:&#x2014;these are not lovely to me in the humour I am in! Well, some other sort than these might be lovelier; none at all w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be loveliest (I remember one evening with Milnes and You Two, L<hi rend="italic">d</hi> A. and you, as among the pleasantest for 20 years);&#x2014;but perhaps nothing of that kind is possible; the case being indeed very intricate! In all cases there is One always at The Grange, the sight of whom is of the nature of happiness to me; pleasant in all moods and situations hitherto: for the sake of that one, <hi rend="italic">I</hi> will encounter anything, even Tom Taylor &#x26; Co., backed by fond mothers and loud children, or still more formidable objects; and in fact will be as clay in the hands of the potter<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jer. 18:6.</note> (or the nearest I can to that) for the sake of seeing you a week or two again, in the way <hi rend="italic">you</hi> find possible, if you find any way possible and expedient. Oh dear, Oh dear! And this is all I can say;&#x2014;and inexorable Time (I perceive) cuts me short for the present; the &#x201C;Miss Lowe Subscription&#x201D; (blessings on it!) calling me to the Athenaeum as fast as I can now run!</p>

<p>Indeed, indeed, dear Lady, it never entered into &#x201C;the imaginating of the thoughts of my heart,&#x201D; that at such time of year and on so short a stay, <hi rend="italic">you</hi> might, could, would, or should, have driven down to Chelsea! Far from that, I <pb id="pg-30-114" n="30:114"/>did not even find it permissible to seek to see you at Bath House on that &#x2018;one day&#x2019;; tho&#x2019; I had already walked to the end of Bolton Street<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >By Bath House.</note> in the course of making up my mind, whether I might ask to see you or had best <hi rend="italic">not</hi>.</p>
<p>&#x201C;There is no chance of our coming to the Grange?&#x201C;&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">Isn&#x2019;t</hi> there?&#x201D;! I was fearing something quite different; that there was no chance of our being invited. I don&#x2019;t think M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C&#x2019;s staying sulking at home last winter, turned out so well for him, body or soul, that he should ever again &#x201C;take that line&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">your</hi> phrase) as long as he lives. Even if there weren&#x2019;t a <hi rend="italic">book</hi> in the House, he would go this year, I am sure, if <hi rend="italic">only</hi> you were so goodnatured as to invite him&#x2014; As for me, it was no illusion on the <hi rend="italic">advantages</hi> of giving up the only bit of cheerful life that the year brought round for us, and &#x2018;sticking to one&#x2019;s work&#x2019; in grim silence at home&#x2014; I did not need to <hi rend="italic">miss</hi> our visit for the next twelve months, to make me know what I had gone and done!&#x2014; I knew it perfectly well at the time&#x2014; But it was all but <hi rend="italic">impossible</hi> for me to go last year, <hi rend="italic">under the circumstances</hi>.</p>
<p>I saw M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Brookfield three days ago&#x2014;looking lovely in a new bonnet with large blue flowers, she had just been to get the character of a cook&#x2014;the one who was having hysterics in their house last May, on account of her Husbands death in the Crimea, being now to marry another soldier! I will call today and tell M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Brookfield your words about a shawl&#x2014;</p>
<p>Poor little M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Twislton has been suffering agonies from acute rheumatism&#x2014;caught at sea on their return from America<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >She had returned in <date when="1855-10-00">Oct.</date> with her sister Elisabeth Dwight (<date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>&#x2013;<date when="1901-00-00">1901</date>), who was to stay for a year. Elisabeth wrote to her sister Mary Parkman (b. Dwight), <date when="1855-11-08">8 Nov.</date>; &#x201C;Mrs Carlisle has been since I wrote and made Ellen a delightful visit, &#x26; staid to lunch, so that I heard her talk both to Ellen &#x26; Edward &#x26; she seemed to me the most entertaining person I ever heard talk, in her style, which is story-telling. She could write a modern Arabian nights.&#x2014;Her talk was almost entirely about people, mostly those that I didn&#x2019;t know, &#x26; if she had sketched them on the wall they could not have been more graphically represented than in her broad Scotch accent.&#x2014;She was very kind to me, kissed me when she went away, &#x26; said I must come with Ellen to see her when Ellen was well.&#x201D; In another letter, <date when="1855-11-16">16 Nov.</date>, she wrote that JWC had visited and she &#x201C;was as entertaining as one of Thackeray&#x2019;s novels &#x26; much in the same style&#x201D; (MS: Houghton Lib., Harvard Univ., 45M-98).</note>&#x2014; She is now out of bed on a couch in her bedroom, <hi rend="italic">He</hi> was so upset by the sight of her sufferings that he actually <hi rend="italic">blasphemed</hi> a little, in my own hearing!</p>
<p>M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Wedgwood took me last night to hear Lord John lecture in Exeter Hall&#x2014;and a horrid headach is what I have gained by it&#x2014; Certainly if Lord John aint particular about the <hi rend="italic">quality</hi> of praise he must have had quantity last night to his heart&#x2019;s content&#x2014; Thousands of young shopmen and shop-women frantically beating with their hands and feet&#x2014;till their faces were wet with the exertion&#x2014; I missed much of the lecture, being far off, and Lord John&#x2019;s voice of the feeblest; but what I did hear was only remarkable for its insipidity&#x2014;good <pb id="pg-30-115" n="30:115"/>gracious!&#x2014;if M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C had been there, I am confident, he would have shied something at the little man, when <hi rend="small-caps">he</hi> was putting down D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Johnson, for saying &#x201C;The Magistrate had a right to persecute and the holder of truth a right to suffer&#x201C;&#x2014; It was more of a sermon than a lecture&#x2014;but what I found most curious; every time his Lordship named &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">christ,</hi>&#x201D; which was very often, the House thundered applause so loud and long and obstreperous that I expected it always to end in &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">hip hip hurrah</hi>&#x201D;!&#x2014; Was it surprise and admiration that a <hi rend="italic">Lord</hi> should have heard of christ? Or what was it that set their hands a clapping and feet thumping at that name? One time Lord John had said something very complimentary to Christ, and the applause began&#x2014;but I heard one man cry &#x2018;order&#x2019;&#x2014;&#x2018;order&#x2019;&#x2014;and another &#x2018;no! no&#x2019;&#x2014;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> reported Russell&#x2019;s lecture, <date when="1855-11-14">14 Nov.</date>, organized by the YMCA, on the &#x201C;Obstacles which have retarded moral and political progress.&#x201D; According to the <hi rend="italic">Times,</hi> Russell argued that the main obstacle was govts.&#x2019; suppression of enquiry, that Johnson was wrong when he said that magistrates, even when they were morally and theologically wrong, were politically right and had a duty to suppress opinions they thought dangerous (<hi rend="italic">Boswell&#x2019;s Life of Johnson</hi> 2:249&#x2013;50); history has taught us that suppression creates social instability and impedes progress. He said that not just govts., but people themselves have obstructed progress by their own vices, but the rules of Christian morality, which &#x201C;give each man liberty but place on each man restraint,&#x201D; were enough to guide humanity. By them &#x201C;conformity in a spirit of kindness&#x201D; is attainable even if conformity of belief is not. See also Journal, <date when="1855-11-13">13 Nov.</date></note></p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I got your second Note; thanks for writing to me again: I answered the first one obliquely by some ultimate instructions to Garthwaite, who I suppose has now got done with his furnishings of me ag<hi rend="italic">t</hi> the winter cold. If so, bid him send his acc<hi rend="italic">t</hi> (or give it you to <hi rend="italic">bring,</hi> along with the <foreign><hi rend="italic">corpora facti</hi></foreign> [work completed] when you return hither), and I will pay him by a line upon the Bank.</p>
<p>We have nothing new here, nothing much wrong,&#x2014;only ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> 10 days ago, at a dinner with Milnes (which I was <hi rend="italic">forced</hi> to, in damp cab, with various bother and confusion <hi rend="italic">before,</hi> during and after) I caught a dirty cold, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> has somewhat hind<supplied>[e]</supplied>red<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> my affairs ever since, and still does, tho&#x2019; now apparently <hi rend="italic">vanquished,</hi> and fast upon the <hi rend="italic">retreat</hi>. I have also had a very great deal of trouble again with those <hi rend="italic">Johnson</hi> Old women at Deptford,&#x2014;getting a Subscription in <hi rend="italic">The Times</hi> for them, along with Dickens and Forster; we found there w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be nothing for it but coming to that; so we set upon it, 1st of this <pb id="pg-30-119" n="30:119"/>month. Subscription goes on wonderfully, above Half of it <hi rend="italic">got</hi> (freely as the dew falls), and the other steadily coming day by day. But the bother, the corresponding, the&#x2014;Of all which I had as little need as most of my neighbours! But there was no help for it; I must only <hi rend="italic">take care again,</hi> and will. Thomas Erskine saddled me with that, the good man, but the inconsiderate;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-30/lt-18550701-TC-JF-01">TC to JF, <date when="1855-07-01">1 July</date></ref>. Erskine gave &#xa3;5 to the subscription. The Lowes apparently knew of Erskine&#x2019;s part; Frances Lowe wrote, <date when="1855-10-20">20 Oct.</date>: &#x201C;My Sister begs most Respectively to be remembered to you and Mr Erskine.&#x201D;</note> I think he sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> rather have taken it upon himself,&#x2014;as a man with <hi rend="italic">less</hi> not with more already on his back than I. However, it is going on; and shall be done; and shall probably be among the <hi rend="italic">last</hi> speculations of that kind I engage in. My &#x201C;work&#x201D; (thrice unfortunate &#x201C;work&#x201D;!) suffers sensibly from these interruptions; and tho&#x2019; I stick to it day after day, <hi rend="italic">like glue,</hi> the progress is imperfect in the extreme.

<p>I would at once send you <hi rend="italic">Lewes&#x2019;s Goethe,</hi> tho&#x2019; I know not whether so much weight (probably 4lb or so) were worth carrying so far: but Tait has it on loan (bespoken long since, not got from Miss Wynne &#x26;c till the other day); so that we must wait till his turn is past.</p>
<p>The Book is decidedly good as such Books go, but by no means very interesting, if you have a strict taste in Books.</p>
<p>Sir Colin Campbell was, or still is, here; home from the Crimea in deep discontent with the course of things there;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Campbell had expected the first division, made up of the Highland Brigades and the Guards (of which he had been an exemplary commander), to play a major part in the final assault at Sebastopol. Instead, the Highland Brigades were separated from the Guards, and formed into another division with other Scottish regiments, which Campbell was ordered to take to act as a reserve in the final assault, <date when="1855-09-08">8 Sept</date>. The day before the assault he heard that Lord Panmure, sec. of war, had proposed that he take over the command in Malta (Lawrence Shadwell, <hi rend="italic">The Life of Colin Campbell, Lord Clyde</hi> [<date when="1881-00-00">1881</date>] 1: 378). He said that this was an indication that Panmure wanted him out of the army and decided to resign; it was asking him &#x201C;to go from my duty with a division in the field to become a schoolmaster to the recruits in Malta&#x201D; (1:386, 393). Campbell left the Crimea on leave, <date when="1855-11-03">3 Nov.</date>, deeply resentful. On arriving in London, he heard that Sir William John Codrington (<date when="1804-00-00">1804</date>&#x2013;<date when="1884-00-00">84</date>; <ref target="volume-30/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/5800"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), had been appointed commander in chief at Sebastopol and that Lord Panmure had wanted him to stay in the Crimea and serve under Codrington (1:391).</note> A. Sterling was to make an auction of their Camp furnitures, and follow &#x201C;in ten days.&#x201D; Meanwhile the Queen&#x2019;s Majesty and others have persuaded Campbell to go back:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Interviews with Queen Victoria lessened his resentment, and on promotion to lt. gen. he returned to the Crimea. Anthony Sterling wrote, <date when="1855-12-02">2 Dec.</date>: &#x201C;The mail &#x2026; brings a short letter from C. The Queen proposed that he should return, in such a manner that he could not refuse. I am truly sorry; it puts him altogether in a false position. It also deprives me of the power of retiring; for it may be fairly remarked, &#x2018;If C. serves after having Codrington put over his head, you can have no pretence to refuse doing the same.&#x2019; I am much vexed on account of C. They first put the Court favourites at the top, and then employ the Queen to make the good officers serve under them; it is a shame of the first water. &#x2026; I can scarcely believe so unnatural an arrangement will work&#x201D; (Sterling, <hi rend="italic">Letters from the Crimea</hi> 466). See also Journal, <date when="1855-11-23">23 Nov.</date></note> Sterling, just when the auction is over, will find that he must buy again, and stay where he is. I wish they had both come home: I should then have been pretty nearly free from care about that brutish Turk-War business, and willing to let it go as it liked.</p>
<p>I begin to feel the cold again very sensibly up here,&#x2014;have <hi rend="italic">two</hi> coats on today, by way of defying it;&#x2014;and am consulting and considering whether to <pb id="pg-30-122" n="30:122"/>fairly set up a <hi rend="italic">stove</hi> here, or fairly remove down to the drawing room till the Sun turn.

<salute>Dear Forster,</salute>
<p>I own I had never much hope of that Lichfield business:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Richard Greene wrote Forster, <date when="1855-11-26">26 Nov.</date>, that he had been disappointed by the response of Lichfield citizens to the appeal for the Lowes, but &#x201C;Johnson <hi rend="italic">never</hi> was treated by Lichfield people as he ought to have been. &#x2026; Mr. Carlyle has forwarded me some copies of Your appeal which I will distribute where I consider they will receive attention.&#x201D; He enclosed his own contribution of &#xa3;5 (MS: FC).</note> we must go ahead without it.</p>
<p>I would say <hi rend="italic">Tomorrow</hi> at 5 without hesitation; only I fear there will not be time to gather the correct report of progress from Coutts and Prescott&#x2019;s. Let us therefore say <hi rend="italic">Saturday</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1855-12-01">1 Dec.</date></note> <hi rend="italic">at 5;</hi> and pray contrive to get the correct bulletin from both places; and let us know exactly what we <hi rend="italic">have</hi> in the bag. We can then judge whether to <hi rend="italic">attack</hi> with these Circulars, or to leave things to their natural operation for a while longer. While Dickens is here, after the 8<hi rend="italic">th</hi> next, we must have another meeting; and decide about getting some Actuary of an <pb id="pg-30-123" n="30:123"/>Insurance Office (I know a tolerable man, if there occur to you no better) to take accurate knowledge of these old women&#x2019;s ages, long annuities &#x26;c; and tell us what exact sum (my &#xa3;400 was but a rough guess) will be rigorously needed for them and us. Soon after which I hope to wash my hands of it, and drink your health somewhere,&#x2014;your hands being well washed too.</p>
<p>No answer needed to this: <hi rend="italic">Saturday</hi> stands and the hour of 5 p.m., at the Athenaeum.</p>
<p>I have got no more money. Ruskin, whom I saw the other night, has given the old women &#xa3;10 (for Turner&#x2019;s sake),<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-30/lt-18551106-TC-RMM-01">TC to RMM, <date when="1855-11-06">6 Nov.</date></ref> Ruskin was an authority on Turner, and his executor.</note>&#x2014;I wish he had paid it into our Fund rather. He says farther, he has undertaken to himself to pay an annuity of &#xa3;5 on the same score: if he w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> add the <hi rend="italic">purchase-money</hi> of that to what we have, it would lighten our load down to &#xa3;25 annually. For beyond &#xa3;30, there is not the least use in going. The poor old creatures would only waste, if they had more.</p>
<p>Do not forget my copy of the Cromwell Article.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Forster had found that Cromwell&#x2019;s eldest son, Robert (<date when="1621-00-00">1621</date>&#x2013;<date when="1639-00-00">39</date>), presumed by TC to have died in infancy in Felstead, lived till age 19 and was buried at Felstead. TC wanted a prepublication copy of his article &#x201C;The Civil Wars and Cromwell,&#x201D; in which Forster noted: &#x201C;In the register of the burials at &#x2026; Felsted &#x2026; is the following entry: &#x2018;Robertus Cromwell filius honorandi viri M<hi rend="italic">tis</hi> Oliveris Cromwell et Elizabethae uxoris ejus sepultus fuit 31<hi rend="italic">mo</hi> die Maii&#x2019;&#x201D;; he added in a note that the &#x201C;word denoted by &#x2026; M<hi rend="italic">tis</hi> is &#x2018;Militis,&#x2019; in the sense of esquire, or arm-bearing gentleman, and there are some rare examples of its use with this meaning before a proper name&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review,</hi> 103 [<date when="1856-01-00">Jan. 1856</date>]:54). TC added the information in a note in <date when="1857-00-00">1857</date> to <hi rend="italic">Cromwell;</hi> see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 6:48. In her <date when="1904-00-00">1904</date> edn. of TC&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Oliver Cromwell,</hi> Sophie Lomas wrote that it had been misread and that &#x201C;the true reading is as follows, &#x2018;Robertus Cromwell, filius honorandi viri m<hi rend="italic">ri</hi> (magistri) Oliveris Cromwell et Elizabethe uxoris ejus sepultus fuit 31<hi rend="italic">mo</hi> die Maii&#x2019;&#x201D; (1:42).</note> Very probably you are right about that <hi rend="italic">Militis</hi>. Who found out the Felsted Tombstone,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Forster noted in the article only that it was a &#x201C;friend who examined the original for us&#x201D; (103:54).</note> and when?

This Garret will become quite a Gallery, were all these Portraits hung in their places here; my wife, skilful in such things, has undertaken that part of the business;&#x2014;and indeed is now actually engaged in the preliminary parts of it.</p>
<p>But there is one thing you must do straightway: solve me this couple of Enigmas, the two Prints, Lady and Old Gent<hi rend="italic">n</hi> who have no name!

<salute>Dear Lord Ashburton,</salute>
<p>Were I never so much your &#x201C;enemy,&#x201D; I could say nothing against that speech.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >At the formal lunch, after Prince Albert had laid the Birmingham Literary Institution&#x2019;s foundation stone, <date when="1855-11-22">22 Nov.</date>, Lord Ashburton gave a short speech, reported in the <hi rend="italic">Hampshire Chronicle,</hi> <date when="1855-11-24">24 Nov.</date>, in which he said that the country faced great danger. Having adopted free trade, England had to fight to keep its markets, but it had fallen behind other nations, &#x201C;inferior as we are in all that scientific knowledge which cheapens and facilitates the application of labour; unless, indeed, knowledge be weakness and science a farce.&#x201D; He said the govt. was too absorbed by party politics to help but that fortunately &#x201C;we have &#x2026; a Prince who, raised above the sphere of party conflicts, has &#x2026; larger views &#x2026; than those of our public men.&#x201D; The prince had promoted science and brought to the country &#x201C;a due sense of our danger.&#x201D; He warned that &#x201C;if we go on feeding the people only with desultory information&#x2014;diverting their minds from the serious work of preparation for the real business of life &#x2026; our manufactures must sink. &#x2026; [T]hus this England &#x2026; &#x2014;the storehouse of nations, the refuge of the oppressed, the pattern land of order&#x2014;oh it will be a wilderness again, peopled with worse than wolves, peopled with starving desperate outlaws.&#x201D;</note> It is excellent, in the way of <hi rend="italic">speaking,</hi>&#x2014;if you will go ahead in that direction. It has the old sharp brilliancy, and pointed dexterity, force and delicacy; and comes home upon the two heads of method, in a way not to be surpassed. How kindly you interpret the thick smoke of that Bromwicham<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A variant of &#x201C;Brummagen&#x201D; [Birmingham].</note> dining and botheration to mean (what it intrinsically does, if you deduct the 999 parts <hi rend="italic">without</hi> meaning) a desire to kindle up the soul of the working man into some <hi rend="italic">heroic</hi> knowledge of his work;&#x2014;a most true and important problem; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> Bromwicham, I doubt, will never solve. Then with what a delicate yet decisive finger you point to the bottomless sea of fire that lies under all this dining, and instituting and palavering,&#x2014;as penalty for <hi rend="italic">not</hi> solving the essential problems of the matter, and merely talking about solving them, with drink before us and tavern victual in the inside of us! Nothing can be better in the way of speech, if you will speak to such a pack. My chief dissent, I find always, lies in this, That you <hi rend="italic">hope</hi> some advance will be made by these methods of institutioning, dinnering &#x26;c &#x26;c; and that I, unfortunate, see no shadow of salvation on that side. I grant withal that the British Nation (luckless eating blockhead) &#x201C;has no other method&#x201D;; that I am atrabiliar in humour, &#x26;c &#x26;c: and so the discrepancy is not so great perhaps even on that side: but as to <hi rend="italic">speaking,</hi> my verdict is truly as above; and you have a right to all the benefit or satisfaction you can find therein. I hope moreover it does not differ from My Lady&#x2019;s opinion, but coincides with it: for it is not strange to me you should find an oracle there, in one of the best heads in the world so related to you as <pb id="pg-30-127" n="30:127"/>that one.&#x2014; &#x2014; If I could persuade you and her to commence actual &#x201C;teaching&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">voiceless,</hi> I mean, concrete, and solidly practical) of &#x201C;common things&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Referring to Ashburton&#x2019;s pamphlet, <hi rend="italic">Ashburton Prizes for the Teaching of &#x201C;Common Things&#x201C;</hi> (<date when="1854-00-00">1854</date>); see <ref target="volume-29/lt-18540209-TC-LOA-01"><sic>29:27</sic><corr>TC to LOA, <date when="1854-02-09">9 Feb. 1854</date></corr></ref>.</note> to the poor young populations that depend on you,&#x2014;there were a result: fruitful, beneficient, to one knows not what extent! But I know it is supremely difficult, ugly in the doing as any real labour is, only thrice beautiful when <hi rend="italic">done;</hi> and I cannot recommend thin skins to engage with such a thing!&#x2014;</p>
<p>The poor Duc d&#x2019;Aumale has lost his good old mother, we hear;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henri d&#x2019;Orleans, duc d&#x2019;Aumale (<date when="1822-00-00">1822</date>&#x2013;<date when="1897-00-00">97</date>). In fact, the duke&#x2019;s mother, Marie Am&#xE9;lie de Bourbon (<date when="1782-00-00">1782</date>&#x2013;<date when="1866-00-00">1866</date>), Louis Philippe&#x2019;s widow (<date when="1778-00-00">1778</date>&#x2013;<date when="1850-00-00">1850</date>), m. <date when="1809-00-00">1809</date>, was still living at Claremont.</note> which is a sad piece of human fortune, doubly so to exiles.&#x2014; I suppose it may practically occasion much trouble at The Grange, many rearrangements postponements and so forth.</p>
<p>It <hi rend="italic">was</hi> settled (and I hope, is) we were to come before long: I shall see The Grange again therefore;&#x2014;may there be a quiet horse, with some length of leg, to take me on many fine rides and dialogues with your L<hi rend="italic">p</hi> as heretofore!&#x2014;</p>

<p>Please to not think it presuming, that one who is only a Dog, and a very little one, should write to you, out of his own head. I am not wanting in modesty, I do assure you; from earliest puppyhood, it has been inculcated on me that presumption is as insufferable in dogs as in men.

<p>The fact is, Madam, I am in &#x201C;a state of mind&#x201C;&#x2014;in one of those moments which French Dogs call <hi rend="small-caps">Supr&#xE8;me,</hi> and in which one does and may do&#x2014;anything! Oh Madam; unless I <hi rend="italic">open my heart</hi> to someone; I shall go mad&#x2014;and <hi rend="italic">bite!</hi> Yes! I feel myself trembling on the brink of <hi rend="small-caps">hydrophobia</hi>!</p>
<p>&#x201C;But what have <hi rend="italic">you</hi> to do with me&#x201D;? you ask&#x2014;&#x201C;you hardly know me, to speak to.&#x201D; Oh Madam! Madam! you have more to do with me than you think!

<salute>Dear Ruskin,</salute>
<p>Among other things you gave me to think about, since you were here I have been twice or thrice reflecting upon your munificence to those old dames at Deptford. Your Gift of &#xa3;10, no doubt it was gratifying to your own pious feeling,&#x2014;but would it not have been safer, in the given case, to have added it to our Subscription? The old women have, to my own knowledge, had an amount of &#xa3;130 140 <hi rend="italic">with</hi> yours<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC has added &#x201C;140 with yours&#x201D; above &#x201C;&#xa3;130,&#x201D; with a line from &#x201C;130&#x201D; to &#x201C;140.&#x201D;</note> added, this year, to their usual income; and the question, What good it may have done them? appears to be a little uncertain!</p>
<p>Well, the &#xa3;10 is gone; but the intended annuity of &#xa3;5, it is upon this that I will now obtrude upon you my surmise. If your purpose is quite <hi rend="italic">fixed</hi> in regard to this new eminent piece of bounty, would it not suit as well if you join with us in regard to it,&#x2014;namely threw in a sum at once which would purchase such an annuity, or enabled us in some authentic way to mark you as a Donor to that annual extent? I am very clear that, for the sake of the two old women themselves, the two adventures ought to be th<supplied>[o]</supplied>roughly<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> <hi rend="italic">conscious</hi> of one another, and to be virtually if not formally <hi rend="italic">one</hi>. In fact, I think, unless you renounce your project altogether, it would be worth <hi rend="italic">your</hi> while to consider this suggestion, which it is well worth <hi rend="italic">our</hi> while to impress upon you!</p>
<p>The truth <supplied>[is]</supplied><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> I have just returned from an interview with Forster (who in the temporary absence of Dickens is my sole coadjutor in that matter of the &#x201C;Miss Lowe Subscription&#x201D;): Forster reports rather a beggarly account of the last 18 days,&#x2014;an increase of precisely &#xa3;30 (&#xa3;202.2 this evg);&#x2014;and in short a clear demonstration that the voluntary Principle has just about exhausted <pb id="pg-30-130" n="30:130"/>itself; and that in the way of &#x201C;falling like dew,&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Cymbeline</hi> 5.5; &#x201C;The benediction of the covering heavens / Fall on their heads like dew.&#x201D;</note> &#xa3;202.2 is nearly what the British Nation can do in this matter.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The final sum raised was &#xa3;305 19s. 6d.</note> More could be raised, no doubt, by &#x201C;aggressive methods&#x201D; common in such cases, and probably a touch of that (applied at least to the 20 or 25 gent<hi rend="italic">n</hi> that signed the memorial) will be resorted to, as coming within the rule: but farther it will not be pleasant to go,&#x2014;at least if one can help it at all.</p>
<p>It was in these circumstances that I mentioned your bounteous doings; and Forster, headlong mortal, urged me to apply to you as above,&#x2014;which I thoughtlessly promised; which in fact I did not till now see the very great impudence of doing!

<p>1. In the <hi rend="italic">Fastes</hi> just cited (vol. ii.&#x2014;or indeed by <hi rend="italic">pages</hi> they are all one volume&#x2014;Fastes, &#x26;c. p. 395<hi rend="italic">bis</hi>) an Official Marquis de Breteuil dies, <date when="1743-01-01">January 1, 1743</date>:&#x2014; How is this gentleman related to Madame du Ch&#xe2;telet?

<p>2. In <hi rend="italic">d&#x2019;Espagnac</hi> just cited (Livre 8, very near the beginning of it, ii. 26 of my German), a <hi rend="italic">Marquis du Talleyrand</hi> and some others are blown up in the Trenches of Tournay, <date when="1745-05-08">May 8</date>&#x2013;<date when="1745-05-09">9</date> (night-time) <date when="1745-00-00">1745</date>,&#x2014;just before the Battle of Fontenoy. How related to the Talleyrand of our day;&#x2014;his Uncle, or how?&#x2014;(if the French had on their old Book-stalls any Book like our old &#x201C;Collins&#x2019;s Peerage,&#x201D; to be had for half a sovereign, and out of which you can fish all manner of things in the above kind&#x2014; But, alas, they are almost sure not to have it!).<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Browning replied, identifying him as Daniel-Marie-Anne de Talleyrand-P&#xE9;rigord, marquis de Talleyrand (<date when="1706-00-00">1706</date>&#x2013;<date when="1745-00-00">45</date>), and saying that he was &#x201C;blown up by an accident in the trenches at the siege of Tournay, May 9, <date when="1745-00-00">1745</date> [see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 16:93]. &#x2026; He was father, by his second marriage, of Charles-Daniel, born <date when="1734-00-00">1734</date>&#x2014;whose second son was Charles-Maurice, born <date when="1754-00-00">1754</date>, <hi rend="italic">our</hi> Talleyrand.

<p><pb id="pg-30-133" n="30:133"/>Well, at any rate, this is all, dear Browning; and I will leave it with you,&#x2014;calculating on forgiveness, if I give you labour in vain. <closer><salute>I send many kind regards to the Lady and you: it is verily one of my sorrows and lasting regrets that you cannot be seen from night to night by me, but live on the other side of seas.&#x2014;</salute></closer> I got a glimpse of your &#x201C;Men and Women&#x201D;;<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Men and Women,</hi> 2 vols.

<salute>Dear Jean,</salute>
<p>Your Letter has filled me with <hi rend="italic">remorse</hi> as well as with astonishment. I had been thinking, all this while, it was certainly you that had to write; and I accounted for your silence by the young <foreign>Bairn</foreign>; fancied you were making reasonable shift with what the Doctor w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> communicate &#x26;c;&#x2014;always, too, I was determining to write, and bid you not mind answering, as I could loyally send you a word now and then <hi rend="italic">without</hi> answer while you were busy: all this has been going on, and once or twice a resolution <hi rend="italic">made</hi> to write was broken again (which is so easily done, in this turbid never-resting, ever-hurried element of mine);&#x2014;and it now at once appears I was in a complete mistake as to the debtor-and-creditor account! Well, you must pardon me. The facts are as I say;&#x2014;I remember now you asked me for a name <hi rend="italic">other</hi> than Alick to the child, and I could think of none: you must tell me what the name was, at any rate!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John.</note> For the rest, I write by return of post making what amends I can; and determining to remember better another time.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-30-134" n="30:134"/>My cold is quite gone; I am in my usual dreary steadfast condition; working as heretofore, with mulish obstinacy, but on the worst terms; which is a state you are familiar with. There has been in fact, no <hi rend="italic">news</hi> with us, none at all;&#x2014;nor is yet, except that it is settled we are to go to The Grange for a month (<date when="1855-12-17">17 dec<hi rend="italic">r</hi></date>&#x2013;<date when="1855-01-17">17 jan<hi rend="italic">y</hi></date>), the beginning of which term comes on Monday come a week: I hope the thing may answer! My four weeks at Croydon did me a visible good; but there it was absolute solitude with horse exercise, and private reflexion in the clear air; at The Grange it will be a very different set of conditions. But there will be horses there too, there will be free air: in short I am willing to have this frozen stagnancy broken by any <hi rend="italic">change,</hi> and calculate we may both find benefit. At any rate there was no refusing.&#x2014; As to my <hi rend="italic">Frederick,</hi> I do believe, in some bright moments, that I shall get it <hi rend="italic">done</hi> after all. Never was my heart so near being broken with anything; to get <hi rend="italic">free</hi> of that unutterable welter, and leave it behind me to all eternity,&#x2014;there will be a joy; and the one joy I make confident hope of, if I live two years longer. This day I am sixty; which is a thing to create very serious reflexions,&#x2014;which indeed have not been wanting of late; especially since that unforgettable Event we witnessed together!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >His mother&#x2019;s death, <date when="1853-12-25">25 Dec. 1853</date>.</note> But I am not troubled with slavish terror of any kind; I calculate on working (honestly if I can, and with or without wages) till I be summoned <hi rend="italic">home,</hi> whenever that occur; and I cannot think there will be other than deep <hi rend="italic">rest</hi> provided for one there,&#x2014;a welcome blessing to the back that has been well toiled and galled as it went along. Oh my Mother, my Mother! Her face is here on the wall (very like); and I look at it almost daily with reflexions that are far beyond words. The saddest and the greatest that is in one&#x2019;s existence connects itself with that good face which <hi rend="italic">these</hi> eyes can never again behold. Silence, Silence!&#x2014; &#x2014; Let us live worthy of her, and of her honest simple nobleness; that is the one good elegy we can make about our loss and her gain.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>The Dr does not write to me often, and not at great length when he does. I suppose him to be rather idle; but living lazily along (with a <hi rend="italic">hope</hi> of setting up some establish<hi rend="italic">t</hi> of his own) at Scotsbrig as well as he could elsewhere. He has plenty of money to keep any kind of house: but other essential things may not be so plentiful (poor fellow, after all!)&#x2014;and the difficulties of such an enterprise are indeed great. It must be owned that he takes his perverse situation with a praiseworthy quietness (little imitable by some of us!) and is one of the best-natured of mortals.&#x2014; &#x2014; Your Jim appears to be improving his mind and hand at any rate; which is right well for him. Any labour he can <hi rend="italic">do,</hi> this, at his age, is not to be complained of: if he keep his eyes open, he will <hi rend="italic">learn</hi> much, and be fit for much. His German hand and his English&#x2014;give them my <pb id="pg-30-135" n="30:135"/>praises. Poor Tom&#x2019;s Letter is very curious: rugged <hi rend="italic">naked</hi> truth! <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign> dear Jean; write to me soon.&#x2014;</salute></closer></p>

This is abundantly all that could be wished,&#x2014;for certain, all that I ever did wish;&#x2014;and I think it must satisfy Forster himself; to whom I now send your announcement, with charge to make it known in the way most advantageous and least obtrusive. And may the Heavens reward you (as I have no doubt they will, in their own fashion) for your piety to the <foreign><hi rend="italic">Manes</hi></foreign> [ancestral spirits] of Turner,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-30/lt-18551106-TC-RMM-01">TC to RMM, <date when="1855-11-06">6 Nov.</date></ref></note> and compassion for the straits of these old women.</p>
<p>For the rest you must undertake the bestowal of your Annual Bounty yourself: the sole reward I claim in reference to these poor Misses Lowe is that, after this unblessed bother is once all done, I may never in this world or the next hear more of them;&#x2014;that is a reward I cannot dispense with, nor must you grudge it me! God knows I had no need of new weight thrown upon my poor back just at present; and I have often asked myself, why in the devil&#x2019;s name I, of all mortals, got connected with such a thing? I will take better heed another time!&#x2014;</p>
<p>With regard to Miss Erdman,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-30/lt-18551203-TC-JRU-01">TC to <sic>JR</sic><corr>JRU</corr>, <date when="1855-12-03">3 Dec.</date></ref></note> and the &#xa3;10 towards washing purposes (for now I see it must have referred to that), there came to me a distracted scratch of writing from the elder Lowe some time since; very high and defiant of the said Erdman, but otherwise quite Sybilline and unintelligible,&#x2014;for the rest, of no worth whatever:&#x2014;I have looked for it this morning to send; but I suppose it is gone into the fire. Whither may all nonsense soon go. Amen, Amen!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I am longing for your Book;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Modern Painters,</hi> vols. 3 and 4 (<date when="1856-00-00">1856</date>).</note> the feeling you have about matters is altogether my own; and you have not yet hacked your sword blunt in striking at the stony head of Human Stupidity, but rush in upon it as if it were <hi rend="italic">cleaveable</hi> or conquerable,&#x2014;more power to your elbow. It is and will be incumbent [several words cut away] our whole soul, till we die; [several words cut away] <pb id="pg-30-136" n="30:136"/>that it cannot be cleft, but is unconquerable by the very gods (according to Schiller),<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Schiller, <hi rend="italic">Die Jungfrau von Orleans</hi> 3.6 (cf. <ref target="volume-26/lt-18511123-TC-TSS-01"><sic>26:238</sic><corr>TC to TSS, <date when="1851-11-23">23 Nov. 1851</date></corr></ref>).</note> and lasts till the Day of Judgement at soonest.</p>
<p>We go into Hampshire for a month (<date when="1855-12-17">17<hi rend="italic">th</hi> dec<hi rend="italic">r,</hi></date> that is, monday week), and return on the <date when="1855-01-17">17<hi rend="italic">th</hi> jan<hi rend="italic">y;</hi></date> observe these dates, and remember that you are due here,&#x2014;payable the sooner the better.</p>
<p>I find a Misses-Lowe annuity of &#xa3;25 will come rather cheaper than was expected; in spite of the weather symptons, we can still hope to achieve some approximation to that. That, with your five pounds, solves the problem, therefore,&#x2014;or at least <hi rend="italic">absolves</hi> me from it.</p>

<salute>Dear Forster,</salute>
<p>Here is Ruskin&#x2019;s Answer:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1855-12-04">4 Dec.</date>; see <ref target="volume-30/lt-18551203-TC-JRU-01">TC to <sic>JR</sic><corr>JRU</corr>, <date when="1855-12-03">3 Dec.</date></ref></note> he does not give us the money all at once, but makes the Annual &#xa3;5 sure (during his life at least), and even permits us to announce it in good time: really that is about the same thing, and we ought to be content with it. I have told him <hi rend="italic">you</hi> were to have charge of making it known to the Public &#x201C;in the way most advantageous and least obtrusive.&#x201D; Perhaps you had better for the present say nothing, or nothing <hi rend="italic">arithmetical,</hi> about it; but merely fire off your Subscription Lists in the way he talked of?<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ruskin was not on the list of subscribers pbd. in the <hi rend="italic">Times,</hi> <date when="1856-05-12">12 May 1856</date>.</note>&#x2014;</p>
<p>Here also is an Answer from Brydges<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Bridges, sec. to the Mitre General Life Assurance Assoc., 23 Pall Mall.</note> the Actuary (Mitre Office Pall Mall), who not only promises me a <hi rend="italic">visit</hi> this evening, but will treat his poor wife to a sight of the monster, too! However, he is a very obliging honest creature, and ready to calculate &#x26;c to all lengths. The Price of a &#xa3;20 Annuity is very decidedly cheaper than I had expected; but I fear the ages are not quite 78 and 73, in our case, but perhaps 76 and 72.&#x2014; I suppose I may now invite Brydges to go over to Deptford, and obtain the necessary evidence of the exact ages, with a view to offering us an <hi rend="italic">Estimate</hi> on the matter. The Bargain (with him or another) will follow as the last finish of the business. My belief is, we shall still, by one method or other, manage about &#xa3;25 annuity;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The annuity came to &#xa3;38 from the subscriptions and a grant of &#xa3;5 a year from Ruskin (see James Boswell, <hi rend="italic">The Life of Samuel Johnson,</hi> ed. Alexander Napier [<date when="1884-00-00">1884</date>] 4:393).</note> which, with Ruskin&#x2019;s five pounds, will be the problem we set. And then, and then&#x2014;Oh my gallant Friend!</p>
<p><pb id="pg-30-137" n="30:137"/>I also send the Note for Browning; about which (in spite of the date written on it) there is no manner of hurry.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably <ref target="volume-30/lt-18551204-TC-RB-01">TC to RB, <date when="1855-12-04">4 Dec.</date></ref></note></p>

<p>I yesterday found your new Gift of Prussian Pamphlets waiting for me when I came down. Really I am almost ashamed of your kindness, tho&#x2019; very heartily obliged. &#x2026;</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Letter on Patriotism</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Letters on Patriotism. Translated from the French Original printed at Berlin</hi> (<date when="1780-00-00">1780</date>). TC&#x2019;s copy, signed &#x201C;T. Carlyle (A.

I suspect the Frederick in sky blue coat (dark blue is the real colour) may really be a copy by Hogarth from the Chodowiecky Portrait,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-30/lt-18551229-TC-EMA-01">TC to EM, <date when="1855-12-29">29 Dec.</date></ref> Daniel Nikolaus Chodowiecki (<date when="1726-00-00">1726</date>&#x2013;<date when="1801-00-00">1801</date>; see <ref target="volume-27/lt-18520606-TC-KAVE-01"><sic>27:139</sic><corr>TC to KAVE, <date when="1852-06-06">6 June 1852</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-27/lt-18521007-TC-LOA-01"><sic>326</sic><corr>TC to LOA, <date when="1852-10-07">7 Oct. 1852</date></corr></ref>); William Hogarth (<date when="1697-00-00">1697</date>&#x2013;<date when="1764-00-00">1764</date>; see <ref target="volume-27/lt-18521007-TC-LOA-01"><sic>27:326</sic><corr>TC to LOA, <date when="1852-10-07">7 Oct. 1852</date></corr></ref>).</note>&#x2014;not a quite unsuccessful Copy. The other reproduction from Chodowiecky teaches us at least (so bad is it) how happy we are to possess the excellent original.</p>
<p>Smith is quite right: &#x201C;It is an <hi rend="italic">error</hi>&#x201D; (very considerable indeed!) &#x201C;that the science of war needs not to be taught,&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably paraphrasing Adam Smith, <hi rend="italic">The Wealth of Nations,</hi> R.

<salute>Dear Neuberg,</salute>
<p>These Extracts from the Newspapers are unexpectedly good. If it were not too much trouble, I could wish you to run over the series of them till after the Peace of Dresden (Xmas <date when="1745-00-00">1745</date>) or even to Aix-la-Chapelle (<date when="1748-00-00">1748</date>),<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 16:183&#x2013;93 and 227&#x2013;33.</note> at which point our 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi> volume must end,&#x2014;don&#x2019;t we <hi rend="italic">wish</hi> it were ended! Doubtless you will find some <hi rend="italic">Th&#xE9;atre</hi> of Actions (like <hi rend="italic">Chandler&#x2019;s Debates</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Richard Chandler, <hi rend="italic">The History and Proceedings of the House of Commons from the Restoration to the Present Time,</hi> 14 vols. (<date when="1742-00-00">1742</date>&#x2014;<date when="1744-00-00">44</date>).</note> for Talk) compiled for the year, instead of for the Day or Week; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> may be otherwise useful.</p>
<p>There has a good stock of <hi rend="italic">Ms</hi>. accumulated,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; I fear in a very confused state,&#x2014;to keep your hand in use during my absence, when you happen to prefer domestic employment. But really I question if you can do much good to that,&#x2014;beyond perhaps copying little bits of it (where much blotted and scrawled), and illuminating it by <hi rend="italic">Indexes</hi> &#x26;c &#x26;c.&#x2014; We really must begin, were the Spring here and a Horse &#x26;c, to make a dead-lift effort, and clear our hands, by actual printing, of this horrible first half of the Book! Courage.</p>
<p>I also want some farther passages from Bielefeld;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >J. F. Bielfeld; see <ref target="volume-30/lt-18550828-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1855-08-28">28 Aug.</date></ref></note>&#x2014;these I think you had better do in the way of <hi rend="italic">abstract</hi> (<hi rend="italic">abridging</hi> rapidly in your own way, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> does very well): I mark the passages here, so far as I can recollect them at present:</p>

<p>Well, we are coming on monday, by the one o&#x2019;clock Train;&#x2014;a precious cargo, I should say: surely it requires a good deal of &#x201C;natural magic&#x201D; in that kind Imagination of yours to find such a cargo beautiful or desirable!&#x2014; However, I promise to be, all that is in me, a good Boy; it is only by weakness of the flesh, not want of a willing spirit,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf.

<p>I mean to try for a little work;&#x2014;yet I own, with small hope, judging by past <pb id="pg-30-140" n="30:140"/>experience of my fidgetty imbecillities.

Had I &#x201C;Pluck&#x201D; here, some sally thro&#x2019; the mud elements, towards happier localities, were inevitable for &#x201C;Pluck.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Yesterday Anthony Sterling called on me; just home from the Crimea as lieutenant to Sir Colin; and,&#x2014;somewhat to his provocation,&#x2014;just about returning again with the said Sir C. His account of the Crimean affairs is surly and miserable: Russian Officers alone know anything about War; British Infantry (such the Berserker fury lodged in the heart of them) could probably beat still in open fight; but Russians able to scheme and manoeuvre, British or French not, it will hardly be allowed to come to that.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>We go off on Monday, according to program; shall be starting (if all go right) from Waterloo Station, an hour or two after you receive this: I have nothing further to say at present, except to send you the Address more specifically in case you have forgot it, and to confirm what was already said.</p>
<p>I have been down here, in the Drawing room, all week; the Bramah<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Bramah and Co., engineers and smiths, manufacturers of Bramah&#x2019;s patent locks, stoves, etc., 124 Piccadilly and 25 Down St.</note> infidels, who are about making me a Grate for the upper Greenland, did not come on Thursday as promised; are to come &#x201C;on Monday&#x201D; (just about the time of my departure);&#x2014;when they will actually come I know not; I know only they are too likely to make a botch of their business, as the others have generally done. I am quite sick of employing people to &#x201C;do&#x201D; anything for me, in these parts; the one thing certain is they will charge as no creatures of the seed of Adam ever did before, and another probable thing is, their work will not be &#x201C;done,&#x201D; will only seem to be done. Surely a Nemesis, huge and terrible, is striding on as with seven-league boots, to demand an account of the <hi rend="italic">works</hi> of this British Nation in our day: either the Laws of Nature are nought, or these things are running up a frightful sum of damnation for all concerned!&#x2014; But we will not go into the &#x201C;general question&#x201D; just now. Let every one look well to his own share of the account: that is what <hi rend="italic">he</hi> can do.</p>
<p>Piper the Postman&#x2019;s Wife is just dead: a frightful scene of ruin and misery, for the poor man and her, it has been this some time past. She killed herself sitting up at nights for Mazzini&#x2019;s home-coming in past years: that I believe is true. Pecuniary disappointments, chagrins of all kinds,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For their disappointment at Piper&#x2019;s failure to gain promotion, see <ref target="volume-29/lt-18550420-TC-JAC-01"><sic>29:292</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1855-04-20">20 April</date></corr></ref>.

There is something that has made me quite sad in what Jane reports about this business. Piper maintains, and has all along, a face impassive as marble,&#x2014;up six nights in the week, &#x26;c &#x26;c: <hi rend="italic">eheu,</hi> once more! I sent a <pb id="pg-30-142" n="30:142"/>Bundle of old Clothes to Mary<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Austin.</note> yesterday; had a great reluctance to begin packing them; thought (and think) they were without worth, and, except as a testimony of good will, might as well have gone a more expeditious road,&#x2014;out of window, or otherwise.</p>
<p>Anthony Sterling is home from the Crimea, to <hi rend="italic">return</hi> in 10 days. Colin Campbell, sensible to the neglects &#x26;c, decided on giving up; came home accordingly, leaving Anthony to sell off all their goods by auction, and then follow. Campbell, solicited and <hi rend="italic">fleeched</hi> by all official persons, by the very Queen and royal family, consents to go back; his Letter meets Anthony at Malta, &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Kit</hi>&#x201D; all sold off, &#x26;c: Anthony decides on coming on to get a new <hi rend="italic">Kit,</hi> very angry at the change.

<salute>Dear Forster,</salute>
<p>I received your Note this morning; and have to regret, among other things, the impossibility of Thursday. We came out hither on Monday;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1855-12-17">17 Dec.</date></note> rather in bad case, some of us, which does not improve hitherto;&#x2014;the program is, we are to stay about four weeks: it is possible one may amend slightly during that time in the brisk frosty air, and quiet of the Country? I do not know: there are certain people who go about on their legs like others, and yet belong intrinsically to the Hospital of Incurables!&#x2014;</p>
<p>As to that affair of the Lowes, I perceive it must just stand over for a while, and take the benefit of your excellent industries in behalf of it: about the time of my projected return, there may be some farther fruit of your missives over England;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Circular printed of the Lowe appeal; see <ref target="volume-30/lt-18551215-TC-LA-01">TC to <sic>Lady A</sic><corr>LA</corr>, <date when="1855-12-15">15 Dec.</date></ref></note> and at any rate the thing will be about mature by that time. I directed Brydges the Actuary to go out to Deptford, and make the due business inquiries as to age &#x26;c; so that he may be able to tell us definitely what <hi rend="italic">can</hi> be done with the money gathered, and what Office will be the best for us to transact with in regard to all that. So that if we had Dickens&#x2019;s sanction (which I hope he will soon return to give us) we may at once knit up that ravelled sleeve;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Macbeth</hi> 2.2.</note>&#x2014;in no haste to open another like it!&#x2014; &#x2014; I received your Six Circular Reports; rapidly distributed them to different intended victims.

<p>Dear Forster you see what a pen I have: good pens, tolerable writing apparatus, have left the world! <closer><salute>I will only send my Christmas greetings to Dickens thro&#x2019; you; put my veto upon Christmas dinners to poor inadequate ailing wretches like us two; and remain, in hope of a meeting soon,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Sister,</salute>
<p>It is probable I may have more time for writing at present than you: I will send you a brief word at any rate, merely to testify where and how we are.</p>
<p>On Monday evening, according to plan, we arrived here: a pleasant enough journey, for a railway one; but the preparations, and preliminary arrangements, infinitely disagreeable in my present humour! Indeed it could not be considered as for the sake of &#x201C;pleasure,&#x201D; or with any eye to <hi rend="italic">profit</hi> except in the medical sense perhaps, that I undertook this visit. I am in all ways grown perceptibly <hi rend="italic">older,</hi> and am in sad sour humour, not calculated <hi rend="italic">enjoying</hi> the kind of things and persons that are chiefly here at this season.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Elisabeth Dwight wrote to Mary Parkman, <date when="1855-12-17">17 Dec.</date>, that TC was &#x201C;much younger &#x26; smoother looking&#x201D; than she expected; at dinner he was &#x201C;well dressed and combed&#x201D; and &#x201C;looked so much like other people&#x201D; that she could not believe it was he. She wrote: &#x201C;He came out &#x2026; with one of his tremendous Jeremiads, against the age, sent us all to perdition without the slightest deference to our feelings, &#x26; talked so loud that the whole company inevitably stopped to listen, several times.&#x2014; I cannot say he attracted me, in spite of his evident genius.&#x201D; She and the Twisletons left the Grange, <date when="1855-12-23">23 Dec.</date>, and she wrote, again to Mary Parkman, <date when="1855-12-26">26 Dec.</date>: &#x201C;We left Carlyle scolding, Lady Ashburton entertaining, Mrs Brookfield smiling &#x26; toadying, Mrs Carlyle neither smiling nor toadying.&#x201D; Of Lady Ashburton she said: &#x201C;To see her with Carlyle is better than any play I ever saw; for she turns his howls into the merriest of laughs, &#x26; evidently refreshes <hi rend="italic">him,</hi> as much as she does the rest of the company&#x201D; (MS: Houghton 45M-98. [18]&#x2013;[88]).</note>&#x2014; The worst thing hitherto is, we can neither of us <hi rend="italic">sleep:</hi> poor Jane suffers especially that way; but we hope the <hi rend="italic">strangeness</hi> will wear off; and the effects of continual exposure to the fine country air &#x26;c &#x26;c will produce its results. I have walked every day to very considerable extent, and also <hi rend="italic">ridden</hi> in spite of the intense frost; I do not try <hi rend="italic">working</hi> at all (vain attempt, I know by past experiences); my only scheme of benefit is to lay in a stock of <hi rend="italic">Exercise,</hi> and be a little <hi rend="italic">rested</hi> and <hi rend="italic">clarified</hi> by the time we get back.</p>
<p>There is a mixed rapidly changing population of guests:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henry Taylor wrote to a friend; &#x201C;At the Grange &#x2026; there was a cloud of savans, physiologists, chemists, mechanists, historians, poets, artists, Doctor this and Professor that; but Carlyle flashed through the cloud and the Brookfields glistened and gleamed through it&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Autobiography &#x2026; <date when="1800-00-00">1800</date>&#x2013;<date when="1875-00-00">1875</date></hi> [<date when="1885-00-00">1885</date>] 2:140).</note> few of them of almost any interest to me; but all friendly enough,&#x2014;whom, if one do not like them, one can easily get quite rid of for most part, without violating the rules.

<salute>Dear Neuberg,</salute>
<p>The inclosed slip of paper was sent by the Postman this morning. I suppose it to have reference to a Photograph of Graff&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Friedrich,</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Anton Graff&#x2019;s portrait; TC saw it in Berlin, <date when="1852-00-00">1852</date>; see <ref target="volume-27/lt-18521007-TC-LOA-01"><sic>27:325</sic><corr>TC to LOA, <date when="1852-10-07">7 Oct. 1852</date></corr></ref>. Neuberg replied, <date when="1855-12-25">25 Dec.</date>: &#x201C;I went to your house yesterday afternoon &#x26; opened the parcel. It contained, as you expected, Frederic-photographs, with a letter from Magnus, which I send. There are two photogr<hi rend="italic">s</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">Pseudo-Graff,</hi> which turns out to be a <hi rend="italic">Frank:</hi> and very imperfect &#x2026; the other &#x2018;restored,&#x2019; that is, <hi rend="italic">touched</hi> with Indian Ink, and looks like a very clever, beautiful drawing.&#x201D; &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Frank</hi>&#x201D; is presumably Heinrich Frank(e) (<date when="1738-00-00">1738</date>&#x2013;<date when="1792-00-00">92</date>), portrait painter.</note> come to me in this way from Berlin.

I should be afraid of a tendency to <hi rend="italic">smoking,</hi> owing to the great open distance between the fire and the opening at the top; an iron <hi rend="italic">door</hi> which I saw standing in the room is perhaps meant to prevent that, at the first lighting at least.&#x201D;</note></p>

<salute>Dear Tait,</salute>
<p>This morning there has come, in some large Packet of prose and verse from Weimar addressed to my Wife not to me, a Letter for you from Wilson;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Wilson.</note> which I, not knowing that it had a stamp upon it, agreed to furnish with one, there being incidentally a small message of my own with which I have been threatening you for some time. Wilson&#x2019;s Letter goes on its own footing, and my message also shall go.</p>
<p>It relates to that Kranach Picture,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cranach; thus in MS; see <ref target="volume-30/lt-18551026-TC-LWR-01">TC to <sic>Lady William Russell</sic><corr>LWR</corr>, <date when="1855-10-26">26 Oct.</date></ref></note> with which you have already had so much trouble. If, as I understand, you have got the best Photograph you could expect from it, then there is still one other thing you can do for me in regard to it,&#x2014;that is, return it to the owner, which I am not there to do at present. Lady W<hi rend="italic">m</hi> Russell, 2 (or perhaps it may be 3?) Audley Square (foot of Audley <hi rend="italic">Street,</hi> and the N<hi rend="italic">o</hi> in question is close upon the wing of Chesterfield <pb id="pg-30-147" n="30:147"/>house):<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On Gt. Stanhope St.; built, <date when="1748-00-00">1748</date>&#x2013;<date when="1849-00-00">49</date>, by Isaac Ware (d. <date when="1766-00-00">1766</date>), for Philip Dormer Stanhope (<date when="1694-00-00">1694</date>&#x2013;<date when="1773-00-00">1773</date>), 4th earl of Chesterfield. Lady William Russell lived at 2 Audley St.</note> I have written the Address upon a Card inclosed; if Picture and Card could, in any safe way, be left there, it would end one branch of this business, and be a new favour done me. It will otherwise have to lumber your studio for three weeks longer, till I myself am on the ground again,&#x2014;not one of the alertest of men either in regard to such things! However, if there is no handy messenger, never mind, but let the thing lie: I believe in fact there is no hurry about it, only my imagination is getting uneasy.</p>
<p>Nay I recollect there is still another <hi rend="italic">pre</hi>liminary, and your troubles are by no means yet ended. I have to depend on you for copying into the final Photograph (with your customary exactitude) the Painter&#x2019;s mark, the Letters &#x201C;V. D.&#x201D; &#x26;c;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >VDMI&#xc6;; see <ref target="volume-30/lt-18551026-TC-LWR-01">TC to <sic>Lady William Russell</sic><corr>LWR</corr>, <date when="1855-10-26">26 Oct.</date></ref></note> and all this will require to be done <hi rend="italic">before</hi> the Picture goes! So probably there will still some time elapse; and if all be ready at my home-coming, and the task of carrying back the Picture be left to myself (whom of all mortals it belongs to), certainly I shall have no <hi rend="italic">complaint</hi> to make, whatever else I have!&#x2014; In short, do as you like, dear Tait; only let us get thro&#x2019; it, for I want to have the thing sent off to Germany and my hands rid of it.</p>
<p>I hope I am gathering a little health here; if not that, I am certainly gathering nothing; for except riding and walking, my idleness is nearly perfect, as indeed that of others round me is. I keep as much alone as I can, and ride a great deal; that is all my virtue. <closer><salute>Yours ever truly</salute></closer></p>

    <salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
    <p>Your Letter has been forwarded to me hither;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">By Neuberg, <date when="1855-12-25">25 Dec.</date>
</note> and the Packet of Photographs, all in excellent preservation as I learn, awaits my return to Chelsea, where I hope to see them in a couple of weeks hence. They are described to me, especially the <hi rend="italic">restored</hi> Photograph is described, as making out an excellent <pb id="pg-30-148" n="30:148" />representation of the Great Frederick: I shall be delighted to possess at last an authentic shadow of that Portrait, which, ever since you took me to see it at the Messrs Schickler&#x02019;s,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss">Berlin banking firm; see <ref target="volume-27/lt-18521007-TC-LOA-01">

The use of this thing will be considerable to me;&#x02014;and surely the pleasure of possessing it is much enhanced by your great and ready kindness in the matter. That, at any rate, is a thing I shall get real <hi rend="italic">use</hi> of, and shall take good care not to forget, or to part with! Many thanks once more.

May it be repaid you one day: for truly it was very good on your part, and is still gratefully recognised as such.</p>
    <p>My troubles with Vater Fritz have been innumerable, incessant and immeasurable, since we parted! No work ever fell to my lot of so essentially desperate and <hi rend="italic">undoable</hi> a character: why I should persist is strange to me; for I have oftenest no motive, or little, except the reluctance to be <hi rend="italic">beaten</hi> by what one has tried. To write a <hi rend="italic">good</hi> Book on the subject, especially here in England at this time, appears to me <hi rend="italic">impossible:</hi> I could long since have written a bad Book, comparable to many that already exist; but that was not my bargain with myself;&#x02014;and therein probably lay my mistake; for no man can <hi rend="italic">do</hi> the &#x0201C;impossible,&#x0201D; tho&#x02019; the French say they can! Bad Book or not so bad, I hope one day to get it off my hands, and be fairly rid of it; which will be an unspeakable deliverance, and really a &#x0201C;reward&#x0201D; greatly worth coveting by a poor wretch in my case: if I live, with any remnant of health, I shall be sure of that reward; and it is pretty much all I expect, nor indeed is more very necessary at this stage of my course. God send me that reward, however; for truly I am much in want of that!&#x02014; <foreign>

</note> picked me up these two from the London Printshops lately; excellent Copies both; and both, especially the Chodowiecky full of worth to me, and <hi rend="italic">credible</hi> after their kind. In the Chodowiecky, besides Vater Fritz on horseback, <pb id="pg-30-149" n="30:149" />there are four Generals a little to rearward of him: 3 Profiles, 1 full face; the midmost of the Profiles I recognise well to be Ziethen,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss">Hans Joachim von Ziethen (<date when="1699-00-00">1699</date>&#x02013;<date when="1786-00-00">1786</date>), Prussian cavalry gen.</note> but do not know the others with any certainty, and should like well to know.&#x02014; Besides all this we have got the <hi rend="italic">Little Drummer</hi> from Charlottenburg,<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss">By Antoine Pesne (<date when="1683-00-00">1683</date>&#x02013;<date when="1757-00-00">1757</date>); see <ref target="volume-28/lt-18530203-TC-CKJB-01">

Please keep this question in mind; and give me your verdict on it by and by.&#x02014; And on the whole pray that I were well out of these Prussian Historical inquiries; for they are of a sort to <hi rend="italic">extinguish</hi> a poor human soul that persists too long in them. Duller records of great Events and Personages,&#x02014;noble human Heroism set forth with every form, or almost every form, of human Stupidity,&#x02014;I have not met with among mankind! The Prussians, I see, are <hi rend="italic">dumb</hi> men (properly), even as the English are.</p>
    <p>I am sorry to hear of what hindered your enjoying Spain and its Collections of Art. It is rare that one&#x02019;s long-cherished hopes are quite realised in such cases: but without steady health, a Spanish journey must be, much of it, mere misery. We heard of you sometimes; once as painting, at Paris, a certain conspicuous Personage there. Eastlake,<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss">Sir Charles Lock Eastlake.</note> I suppose, will have you sent for to do our <hi rend="italic">real</hi> little <hi rend="italic">Queen,</hi> some day; he defines you, I am told, as &#x0201C;the best Portrait Painter we have in this time&#x0201D;;&#x02014;which ought to mean a Painter of Queens, or of something better.</p>
    <p>Lady Ashburton has not given up her Enterprise of collecting Prints; but makes only inconsiderable progress, except perhaps in the French line. A collection of Vandykes (Pappenheim, Mansfeldt<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss">Sir Anthony Van Dyck (<date when="1599-00-00">1599</date>&#x02013;<date when="1641-00-00">1641</date>), Flemish painter; Gottfried Heinrich zu Pappenheim (<date when="1594-00-00">1594</date>&#x02013;<date when="1632-00-00">1632</date>), German imperial army cavalry gen. in the Thirty Years&#x02019; War; Count Peter Ernst Mansfeld II (<date when="1580-00-00">1580</date>&#x02013;<date when="1626-00-00">1626</date>), German Protestant gen.; no Van Dyck portraits of them have been traced.</note> and the rest of that epoch) is almost all she yet has of German; in Spanish I think there has been absolutely nothing attained. Her Ladyship puts on record the two Names you give, the Madrid and the Berlin; and bids me thank you for such indication, which will be useful in time and place.</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I am very glad to get your Letter this morning; I had been daily noting your delay, tho&#x2019; not imparting it to anything but the causes you now assign. Our weather here too, for four or five days, was intensely cold; especially that <hi rend="italic">Saturday</hi> when your <hi rend="italic">ear</hi> got the venom of it in your drive to Annan: but that very night there rose a loud wind here; and on the morrow, instead of a thick universal coat of snow which I expected, there was a complete <hi rend="italic">thaw,</hi>&#x2014;which has continued ever since; dry for most part, tho&#x2019; with one complete day of wet;&#x2014;and on the whole making out singularly fine weather for this season.</p>
<p>That is the history of our weather;&#x2014;and truly we have hardly any other history, for I never in my life was more utterly idle, having given up the very attempt towards anything that can in the least be called <hi rend="italic">work,</hi> as a thing totally unsuitable to this scene. I go and ride daily; every day except sundays, a long solitary ride, ending about sunset; sometimes a considerable walk in the forenoon to boot: in that I am faithful from very obvious considerations; and I restrict my efforts to that. Our company is not much to speak of; Lord Lansdowne for one night (just went, the morning after we arrived, still the old polite hard shallow Gentlemen); Bear Ellice (still here, the <hi rend="italic">oiliest</hi> and best-natured of old men); one Villiers<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charles Pelham Villiers.</note> (Hawk of Politics, and rather clever and consummately well-bred); Lowe of the Times <hi rend="italic">and</hi> Board of Trade;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Lowe.</note> Twisleton with Wife, one Portal with d<hi rend="italic">o</hi> (extremely pretty she, and a credit to the House of Minto);<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Melville Portal (<date when="1819-00-00">1819</date>&#x2013;<date when="1904-00-00">1904</date>; <ref target="volume-30/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/35577"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>) of Laverstoke House, Hampshire; Conservative M.P. for North Hampshire; m., <date when="1855-10-09">9 Oct.</date>, Lady Charlotte Mary, b.

<p>For the rest, in spite of the unwholesome hours &#x26;c I seem to myself to be decidedly improving in health. At starting I had two quite sleepless nights (as poor Jane too had); but all is tolerable now in that and other essential particulars:<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Except that Lady Ashburton, on Jane Brookfield&#x2019;s advice, gave JWC a silk dress from the Christmas tree: &#x201C;this present seems to have a little angered that lady. She would not take it; she vowed she was being insulted, and Lady Ashburton at last was forced to seek her in her room, and assure her with tears in her eyes she had not meant to offend. But that slight breeze was the only storm that arose in those days, which says a great deal for Lady Ashburton&#x2019;s cleverness and tact&#x201D; (Brookfield, <hi rend="italic">Circle</hi> 2:426).

<p>Magnus the Painter has sent me from Berlin an excellent Photograph (indeed a <hi rend="italic">lot,</hi> as I understand) of a Picture of Fred<hi rend="italic">k</hi> the Great; which I am very thankful for, and shall be glad to see.

<p><pb id="pg-30-155" n="30:155"/>JWC&#x2019;s Notebook, <date when="1845-00-00">1845</date>&#x2013;<date when="1852-00-00">52</date>. MS: privately owned. Pbd: Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi> 1:299&#x2013;310 inc. The passages excerpted in Froude are the first 3 paras. of the <date when="1845-04-13">13 April</date> entry; the story of the strayed child, from &#x201C;After I had been in London a short time&#x201D; to &#x201C;and went off <hi rend="italic">avec explosion</hi>&#x201D;; and the <date when="1845-04-27">27 April</date> entry, about the visit to Cheyne Row by the young Irishmen. The rest previously unpbd. The two secs. from <date when="1845-04-00">April 1845</date> are clearly written, with some words or phrases crossed out firmly and alternatives written in, indicating a second reading. The <date when="1847 -00-00">1847</date> entry seems more hurried, with larger handwriting and no deletions; the shortest section, <date when="1852-00-00">1852</date>, seems the most hurried with more crossings out. The notebook is 6&#xBD; by 7&#xBE; ins. (16.5 cm by 19.5 cm), with a hard mottled cover and marbled paper edges. A torn scrap of paper has been attached to the cover by TC: &#x201C;<date when="1845-00-00">1845</date>&#x2013;<date when="1852 -00-00">1852</date> / Anecdotes, (<hi rend="italic">Autobiogr</hi>l/ 4o [circled] / for most part).&#x201D; Only 35 pages of it have been written on, with 35 left blank; about 10 leaves have been cut out at the end. TC has written in pencil on the back of the last leaf, with a balloon around his words and a line pointing to the remaining ends of the cut pages: &#x201C;Piece of the destroyed <hi rend="italic">Autobiogr</hi> hy (most likely). &#x2018;Imaginary Letter&#x2019; 1 was found loosely lying <hi rend="italic">here</hi>. See Book &#x2018;<date when="1849-00-00">1849</date>,&#x2019;&#x201D; after which he has added in ink: &#x201C;(now <hi rend="italic">enclosed</hi> here).&#x201D; The &#x201C;Imaginary Letter&#x201D; is presumably &#x201C;Much Ado About Nothing,&#x201D; <date when="1849-08-02">2 Aug. 1849</date> (see <ref target="volume-24/lt-18490802-JWC-MAAN-01"><sic>24:159&#x2013;71</sic><corr>JWC&#x2019;s MAAN, <date when="1849-08-02">2 Aug. 1849</date></corr></ref>). TC refers to the &#x201C;destroyed <hi rend="italic">Autobiogr</hi>hy&#x201D; in <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences:</hi> &#x201C;She had written at one time something of her own early life; but she gave up, and burnt it&#x201D; (72; see also 157). TC&#x2019;s notes on the MS are given below, but not those of Alexander Carlyle, to whom the notebook once belonged; he mainly noted which passages Froude had omitted. Froude gave no indication of these omissions. He heads it &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">From Mrs. Carlyle&#x2019;s Note Book,</hi>&#x201D; with the footnote, presumably by Froude, &#x201C;Only fragments of these note books survive. Most of them were destroyed by Mrs. Carlyle herself.&#x201D; TC refers in the <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> to JWC writing &#x201C;at various times in Notebooks; refusing all sight of them even to me: but she has destroyed nearly every vestige of them&#x201D; (73, 95, 157&#x2013;58). The other notebook which also survived, TC describes as &#x201C;one little Book, consisting of curious excerpts and jottings <hi rend="italic">not</hi> biographic (in which she would often look practically for <hi rend="italic">Addresses</hi> (Street and number) as one item), is all that remains&#x201D; (Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> 73; see also 95). Alexander Carlyle partly pbd. it, describing it as a &#x201C;little Note-book&#x201D; that JWC kept &#x201C;during her residence in London, for jotting down addresses, phrases, witty sayings, excerpts from books she was reading, and <hi rend="italic">memorabilia</hi> of all kinds&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">NLM</hi> 2:109&#x2013;15).</p>

Being in a house one night in this tabooed quarter with many persons about to crown his wishes by <hi rend="italic">signing;</hi> he asked; &#x201C;but <hi rend="italic">can</hi> you? you are rather a <hi rend="italic">rum-looking</hi> set for being able to write&#x201D;! &#x201C;Oh yes&#x201D; said they &#x201C;we can all read and write&#x2014;and more than that, there is one up stairs who knows Greek and Hebrew&#x201D;!

When Balfour had spoken with him a little, the other, seeing he had to do with a Temperance-Man, enquired whether he knew Mr Dunlop? Balfour was only too happy to answer in the affirmative, and then it came out that this Unfortunate with his Shoes in several pieces, starving in a garret of the Seven Dials, had been some ten years ago an acquaintance of Mr Dunlop&#x2019;s and a prosperous Physician in Glasgow. He had in the most sudden incomprehensible manner, fallen into drink,&#x2014;lost his practice, been cut by his friends, tried what beating his Wife could do for him; until she also took to drinking in sheer despair: and <hi rend="italic">these</hi> were the Couple cast on the wide world, with no prospect when little Balfour found them but that of Death by Starvation and <hi rend="italic">delirium Tremens</hi> in a garret of <hi rend="italic">Seven Dials</hi>.</p>

<p>The second adventure of the little Temperance Lieutenant was of a still more romantic character.</p>
<p>In leaving a house in Seven Dials one day he saw two men at the end of the street who seemed to be watching and waiting for him, and these men he knew by heaven knows what mysterious signs to be pick-pockets or &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Crack-Men</hi>.&#x201D; Being a brave little Balfour however, he would not turn out of his natural direction, but walked on keeping all his eyes about him until he had come up to the men who accosted him with the question; whether he was not in the habit of <hi rend="italic">praying</hi> with the people thereabouts? He told them that he did not meddle with anything so sacred as <hi rend="italic">that</hi> and that they might easily find themselves a seemlier joke. But the men insisted that he <hi rend="italic">could pray,</hi> and they were not joking at all; but really wanted his prayers for a sick friend of theirs who had sent them there to look for him. Since that was the case said Balfour he would attend them to their sick friend and do his best&#x2014;and they led him away into Drury Lane thro most questionable looking stairs and closes and up into a little room&#x2014;very poor but very clean and comfortable&#x2014;where he found a young woman whose face he had seen often enough&#x2014;on &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">the streets</hi>&#x201C;&#x2014;a street-walker in fact who led him to a bed on which was lying a young man of twenty two or so in the last stage of consumption. The sick man thanked him for coming and begged him to read to him the 5th Chap<hi rend="italic">t</hi>. of James.<note n="18" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Including &#x201C;the prayer of faith shall heal the sick,&#x201D; James 5:15.</note> While Balfour was reading he heard a noise of persons running up the stair, and then the two men who had fetched him and who had stationed themselves like sentinels at the open door, exclaimed <hi rend="italic">hush</hi> hush! and gently closed the door, themselves remaining outside. After a little more fuss on the stair a voice called thro&#x2019; the keyhole &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Joe&#x2019;s acquitted</hi>&#x201D;! the sick man made a gesture of satisfaction, and a gleam of satisfaction lighted up his face&#x2014;for a moment&#x2014;but he took no further notice. He told Balfour that his only comfort was in thinking of <hi rend="italic">the Thief on the Cross</hi>.<note n="19" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Told by Jesus that this day he would &#x201C;be with me in paradise&#x201D; (Luke 23:43).</note> Balfour visited him twice afterwards, but when he went again the poor young man was dead&#x2014; From a Scotch Baker close by, and other persons in the neighbourhood, he learned <pb id="pg-30-162" n="30:162"/>that this sick Thief had been thro the whole of his long illness&#x2014;that is to say for eight or nine months supported in <supplied>[e]</supplied>very possible comfort by the two <hi rend="italic">thieves</hi> who fetched Balfour to pray with him, and tenderly nursed and cared for by the young woman whom Balfour saw there&#x2014;a <hi rend="italic">Common Prostitu<supplied>[t]</supplied>e!</hi><note n="20" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letters omitted in &#x201C;very&#x201D; and &#x201C;Prostitue.&#x201D;</note> When Balfour spoke to these about the wickedness of their lives; they told him &#x201C;they knew all that as well as he did, but <hi rend="italic">what could they do?</hi> their characters were gone&#x2014;nobody would give them honest work&#x201C;&#x2014;&#x201C;What could they do?&#x201D; repeated Carlyle at this point in the story&#x2014; &#x201C;They could do <hi rend="italic">this</hi> at least&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">die</hi>&#x2014;rather than go on in such a coil of infamy&#x201C;&#x2014; But dear Carlyle, is not life sweet even to &#x201C;the scum of Creation&#x201D;?

<p>When M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Dunlop was in Scotland last autumn he went to the house of an old friend of his a Clergyman<note n="23" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> where he had engaged to stop a night. Being shown into the sittingroom he found the Rev<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Gentleman at tea with his Wife and a Lady visitor. After the first salutations had subsided Dunlop observed one of these Ladies slip aside and draw to a door communicating with another apartment but not before he had perceived &#x201C;with the tail of his eye&#x201D;<note n="24" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Proverbial.</note> something that made him &#x201C;feel rather queer&#x201C;&#x2014;viz: a female figure in white, to all appearance stiff-dead, stuck bolt upright in an arm-chair! Nothing was said and the tea went on&#x2014; Poor Dunlop eating with what appetite he could muster. In the course of the evening the same Lady who had shut the door, asked the Host &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">M</hi>r <hi rend="italic">&#x2014;will it be time to take her out</hi>.&#x201D; The C<supplied>[l]</supplied>ergyman looked his watch and declared it time&#x2014; Whereupon he proceeded to the mysterious Chamber and made&#x2014;Mesmeric back-passes over the supposed <hi rend="italic">Dead</hi>. who stretched herself&#x2014;rubbed her eyes&#x2014;and finally <pb id="pg-30-163" n="30:163"/>walked away.

After one of these sleeps she could go on washing bravely she said for two or three months, and then she returned to our Clergyman for a new doze of mesmeric Influence.</p>

<p><pb id="pg-30-174" n="30:174"/><bold>INTRODUCTION</bold></p>
<p><pb id="pg-30-175" n="30:175"/>[This is a slightly altered version of K. J. Fielding&#x2019;s introduction to &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">The simple Story</hi> of my own first Love&#x201D; (Edinburgh, <date when="2001-00-00">2001</date>) 3&#x2013;13.]</p>
  <p>The manuscript belongs to private owners, who wish to remain private. It is something like an exercise book, 8 by 6&#xBD; inches (20 by 16.5 cm.), with a lightly marbled thin card cover. At the top of the front cover is a tiny label, on which TC has written &#x201C;3<hi rend="italic">&#x000B0;</hi>,&#x201D; and below it, in irregular brackets, he has written in ink: &#x201C;end of <date when="1852-00-00">1852</date>:&#x2014; <hi rend="italic">child</hi> love. Not heard of before (Burn? No! <date when="1866-08-03">3 Aug<hi rend="italic">t</hi> 1866</date>)&#x2014;.&#x201D; This was about a week before he had finished his memoir of &#x201C;Jane Welsh Carlyle&#x201D; (Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> 40&#x2013;199). Inside its front cover Alexander Carlyle penciled, &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Life</hi> 1. 121 / <hi rend="italic">Life</hi> 1. 285,&#x201D; referring to Froude, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi>. There are a few notes by TC on the manuscript, all recorded in the footnotes. Alexander confined himself to clarifying the readings of various words by writing them above the line: this occurs particularly where the manuscript is marked by a stain (perhaps hot candle grease) going through several pages. The booklet has forty lined pages, or twenty leaves, of which the top half of the first leaf has been torn away. This missing half leaf left a stub showing quotation marks, possibly suggesting that the booklet was begun as a commonplace book, though the quotations left from <hi rend="italic">Twelfth Night</hi> and La Rochefoucauld appear to belong with the story.</p>
<p>The manuscript is accompanied by Alexander&#x2019;s typed copy, used when he was preparing his version of the story for <hi rend="italic">NLM</hi> 2:47&#x2013;57. The copy has a few of his jotted notes, but they have nothing positive to tell; they were evidently made in the course of trying to rebut Froude, and only tell us a little more about Alexander.</p>
<p>The text is taken from the manuscript. Within a few conventions, transcription is as close as reasonably possible. Superscript letters are brought down and italicized; anything in square brackets is editorial, and any brackets within the text are given as rounded, however written. Most of JWC&#x2019;s decidedly eccentric spelling and punctuation has been followed; occasionally, letters or words have been introduced in square brackets for clarity. Some consistency has been introduced for her quotation marks within other quotation marks. The manuscript is presumably a second draft, copied out with care. This is shown, for example, by the way that the long footnote about JWC&#x2019;s Latin studies flows over five pages, separated from the few lines of text by a double line. There are some minor deletions and changes, not footnoted.</p>
<p>Both Froude and Alexander Carlyle tried to make use of &#x201C;Child Love&#x201D; (as they called it, using TC&#x2019;s note on the cover as a title) to support their different <pb id="pg-30-176" n="30:176"/>interpretations of JWC; and, in order to do so, they strangely accepted the tale as not just unquestionably autobiographical but as giving a precise report of what TC actually said. Froude says that he took his quotations from &#x201C;a note-book written long after,&#x201D; which contains the &#x201C;curious entry&#x201D; from &#x201C;What the greatest philosopher&#x201D; to &#x201C;open his mouth upon it.&#x201D; He also tidies up the spelling (see Froude, <hi rend="italic">Life</hi> 1:285&#x2013;86). And he uses it to argue that, even in <date when="1825-00-00">1825</date> when the couple were approaching marriage, TC was &#x201C;not in love&#x201D; but merely admired and &#x201C;loved&#x201D; JWC &#x201C;in a certain sense,&#x201D; because anyone who had really known &#x201C;the <hi rend="italic">thing called love,</hi>&#x201D; could not possibly have made the quoted remarks to &#x201C;the object of his affection.&#x201D; It is too absurdly curious a reading of the story to need unraveling!</p>
<p>Yet Froude&#x2019;s comment was taken up by Alexander Carlyle, in his corrective <hi rend="italic">New Letters and Memorials</hi>. He wondered whether Froude had left &#x201C;Child Love&#x201D; out of the <hi rend="italic">Life</hi> because it would remind readers of the absurdity (in Alexander Carlyle&#x2019;s opinion) of Froude&#x2019;s account of JWC&#x2019;s childhood &#x201C;Irving Episode&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">NLM</hi> 2:47&#x2013;48), where Froude had said that even when Irving was facing his marriage, his &#x201C;real love&#x201D; was for his old pupil, JWC, and that &#x201C;the feeling on her part was&#x2014;the word is her own&#x2014;&#x2018;passionately&#x2019; returned&#x201D; (Froude, <hi rend="italic">Life,</hi> 1:127). Alexander Carlyle attacked Froude&#x2019;s line once morein his note quoting Dr. Welsh&#x2019;s account book record of payments to Irvingfor tutoring the child. He pointed out that JWC would have been 11 at the time Froude claimed she was &#x201C;passionately in love with Irving!&#x201D; To which Alexander sarcastically adds, &#x201C;This would probably be her second case of &#x2018;Child-love&#x2019;&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">NLM</hi> 2:207). Both editors were either confused or controversially dishonest. It should, of course, be remembered that she and Irving had met from time to time after he left Haddington and before he introduced her to TC.</p>
<p>Froude had also already quoted the long footnote from the tale about JWC&#x2019;s learning Latin, first saying (what must be true) that &#x201C;her tutor introduced her to &#x2018;Virgil,&#x2019; and the effect of &#x2018;Virgil&#x2019; and her other Latin studies was to change her religion and to make her a sort of &#x2018;Pagan.&#x2019; In one of her old note-books I find an allusion to this.&#x201D; He then gave the entire footnote in his own style (Froude, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi> 1:121&#x2013;22); but it did not enter his head to convey that it had been embedded in a distinct story.</p>
<p>It remains debatable how far it really was a simple story and how far fiction or the &#x201C;fact of things.&#x201D; JWC has to speak largely for herself, with only some brief comments here on when she wrote and to what she refers.</p>
<p>The introductory quotations from Shakespeare and La Rochefoucauld seem to have been left after some leaves were torn out because they belong with a story about love. They are also witness to how far TC was mistaken in his apparently snappish remarks about love and Thackeray, which need some <pb id="pg-30-177" n="30:177"/>explanation. What Thackeray has to say about Love cannot be explained without referring to his novel <hi rend="italic">Esmond;</hi> and understanding <hi rend="italic">Esmond</hi> depends on seeing how it expresses what Thackeray felt about Jane Brookfield and his relations with her husband, the Reverend William Brookfield (see 19:xiii). The three of them were linked (as the Carlyles were) with Lady Harriet and Lord Ashburton, <hi rend="italic">Esmond</hi> being explicitly dedicated to the latter. And the whole affair leads into what the novel has to say about marriage and love, which TC so disliked and JWC admired (see below). None of this comes out in Charles and Frances Brookfield&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Mrs Brookfield and Her Circle,</hi> notoriously incomplete for what it tells of Thackeray&#x2019;s devotion to their mother.</p>
<p>However much it is simplified, the account remains slightly complicated. Thackeray had been at Cambridge with William Brookfield. From about <date when="1845-00-00">1845</date> he came to know the couple well; there was a close friendship between the three of them; and, in the absence of Thackeray&#x2019;s insane wife, Isabella, from whom he lived apart, the susceptible Thackeray and his friend&#x2019;s wife grew more strongly and sentimentally attached. The novelist wrote whimsically devoted letters to her; Jane Brookfield enjoyed his admiration; and Brookfield happily let it pass, since however warmly the adoring Thackeray felt and expressed himself, the intimacy was strictly verbal rather than physical. So all proceeded without exception and hardly a raised eyebrow among William Brookfield and their friends until, in <date when="1849-00-00">1849</date>, one of Jane Brookfield&#x2019;s cousins, Harry Hallam, pointedly drew Brookfield&#x2019;s attention to the relationship. It was apparently then that they became uncomfortably sensitive to the situation, though it was not until <date when="1851-00-00">1851</date> that a tremendous row broke out.</p>
<p>The exact circumstances are not clear. Thackeray saw the Brookfields&#x2019; unhappiness. With some reason he believed that Jane&#x2019;s husband treated her badly, and he faced him on the matter. But the rupture was complete, and he was hurt and furious that Jane Brookfield seemed to take it so coolly. At the end of October there was a meeting at the Grange at which the Ashburtons tried to reconcile them. Yet, though they all kept up outward appearances, it was still more or less final: Brookfield went to Madeira for his health, taking his wife with him, and Thackeray had to find an outlet for his hurt frustration in the novel he was writing.</p>
<p>Yet it is surprising that so little seems to have been recorded about the affair by friends or acquaintances, who were either remarkably unperceptive or discreet out of friendly decency and in view of the two families&#x2019; children. For the Brookfield affair was much of what the novel was transparently about. It is generally agreed that Thackeray created and developed three of the chief characters with the Brookfields and himself in mind. It is a first-person novel with Henry Esmond close to Thackeray; Lady Castlewood, whom Esmond eventually marries, stands for Jane Brookfield; while her <pb id="pg-30-178" n="30:178"/>boorish husband has his counterpart in the Reverend William. It has been convincingly apparent to Thackeray&#x2019;s chief biographers, such as Gordon N. Ray in his biography of Thackeray and in <hi rend="italic">The Buried Life,</hi> and editions of the <hi rend="italic">Letters;</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For the Brookfields and Thackeray, see the following, Charles Hallam Brookfield and Frances Brookfield, <hi rend="italic">Mrs Brookfield and Her Circle,</hi> 2 vols.

<p>The Carlyles were not present at the Grange during the attempt at reconciliation, but they were there just after the publication of the novel at the end of <date when="1852-10-00">October 1852</date>. They heard about it, and, once they read it, saw that <hi rend="italic">Esmond</hi> was not only about Love but Lost Love. From the time (in book 1, chap. 11) that Harry Esmond first comes home from Cambridge to find the &#x201C;skeleton&#x201D; of an unhappy marriage &#x201C;in the house,&#x201D; we hear of &#x201C;the sadness in Lady Castlewood&#x2019;s eyes and the plaintive vibrations of her voice. Who does not know of eyes, lit by love once, where the flame shines no more?&#x2014;of lamps once properly trimmed and tended. &#x2026; The gentlest and kindest of woman was suffering ill-usage and shedding tears in secret: the man &#x2026; made her wretched by neglect, if not by violence.&#x201D; &#x201C;The love-lamp&#x201D; was put out, and so, &#x201C;Love!&#x2014;who is to love what is base and unlovely.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Nor was this true only of the Brookfields&#x2019; marriage. We can see from JWC&#x2019;s letters and Journal how she could often have applied much of this to her own marriage, for as Harry Esmond says, it is &#x201C;a hard task for women in life, that mask which the world bids them wear. But there is no greater crime than for a woman who is ill-used and unhappy to show that she is so. The world is quite relentless about bidding her to keep a cheerful face.&#x201D; Like Thackeray, JWC would have found it echoing some of her deepest feelings of sentiment and hurt resentment, as well as going on to give the consolation of wish fulfillment. The novel is primarily a love story, and, as the author later remarked about it, &#x201C;I have said somewhere it is the unwritten part of books that would be most interesting&#x201D; (Ray, <hi rend="italic">Letters,</hi> 3:391).</p>
<p>Quite clearly the book had been talked about when the Carlyles, Thackeray, and his children were staying at the Grange at the end of <date when="1852-10-00">October 1852</date>. It had just appeared, and Thackeray would have sent the Ashburtons an early copy because of the dedication to Lord Ashburton &#x201C;for the sake&#x201D; of his &#x201C;great kindness and friendship,&#x201D; shown (though it is not mentioned) in the Brookfield affair. At the time they were all on good terms. Before going there, TC had written of Thackeray to his mother as &#x201C;a clever and friendly man&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-27/lt-18521023-TC-MAC-01"><sic>27:341</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1852-10-23">23 Oct. 1852</date></corr></ref>), while the novelist had recently praised TC enthusiastically in an <pb id="pg-30-179" n="30:179"/>anonymous review of his <hi rend="italic">Life of John Sterling,</hi> and especially for the &#x201C;tenderness&#x201D; as well as for direct emphasis of his &#x201C;language.&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >K. J. Fielding, &#x201C;Thackeray and &#x2018;The Great Master of Craigenputtoch&#x2019;: A New Review of <hi rend="italic">The Life of John Sterling</hi>&#x2014;and a New Understanding,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Victorian Literature and Culture</hi> 27 (Dec. <date when="1999-00-00">1999</date>):307&#x2013;14.</note> But, by the time that they had left, TC wrote with a touch of jealousy to a friend that Thackeray was a sad &#x201C;spectacle,&#x201D; and that his new novel &#x201C;threatens to prove very tiresome and therefore justly &#x2018;unsuccessful.&#x2019; &#x2026; <foreign><hi rend="italic">Aus dem wird</hi>&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">was</hi></foreign> [What will become of him]?&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-27/lt-18521105-TC-JN-01"><sic>27:349</sic><corr>TC to JN, <date when="1852-11-05">5 Nov. 1852</date></corr></ref>). Then, after reaching home, TC wrote to Lady Ashburton that JWC had read the new book, &#x201C;with great admiration &#x2018;for the fine delineations of women&#x2019;; I next, with aversion and contempt mainly for his feline phantasms of &#x2018;women,&#x2019; with many reflections on his singular fineness of sense and singular want of d<hi rend="italic">o</hi> [ditto],&#x2014;and on the whole with fairly more esteem for this Book than seemed likely at the Grange. I find the &#x2018;style,&#x2019; both of painting and writing, worthy of peculiar recognition, in general quite excell<hi rend="italic">t</hi> &#x2026; &#x2014;and here and there with a fine <hi rend="italic">adagio</hi> of affectionate sentimentality, which is almost beautiful. Poor Thackeray. God help him and us after all!&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-27/lt-18521110-TC-LA-01"><sic>27:356</sic><corr>TC to LA, <date when="1852-11-10">10 Nov. 1852</date></corr></ref>).</p>
<p>It is obvious that, once they had read the novel, JWC and TC exchanged opinions. The remarks she attributes to him on love may be in the spirit of some of TC&#x2019;s writings, but they are not quoted from them, and so are apparently from conversation, just as <hi rend="italic">Simple Story</hi> starts as if spoken to him. It is at that point that JWC began her childhood tale with its references to Thackeray and with more than half an eye on him. It was not the only stimulus. She would certainly have discussed it with Geraldine Jewsbury and, conceivably in writing it, had some idea of advising at least one of her young friends about marriage. For she was to mention the tale to the eighteen-year-old Kate Sterling (John Sterling&#x2019;s daughter), who, with her sisters, often looked to her for advice, which JWC took pleasure in giving (<ref target="volume-27/lt-18521229-JWC-KS-01"><sic>27:383</sic><corr>JWC to KS, <date when="1852-12-29">29 Dec. 1852</date></corr></ref>). In fact, earlier in <date when="1852-00-00">1852</date>, she and TC would have liked to encourage the courtship of a visiting young Prussian cavalry officer, Count Dalwig; &#x201C;as fine, handsome, intelligent, brilliant, and modest a young fellow of his kind as I ever saw,&#x201D; wrote TC. Kate had welcomed it; it &#x201C;seemed precisely the offer that might suit beyond all,&#x201D; and, though the Carlyles kept quiet, they wished it &#x201C;cordially well&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-27/lt-18520727-JWC-TC-01"><sic>27:187</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1852-07-27">27 July 1952</date></corr></ref>; Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi> 2:163). But when Dalwig formally asked Kate&#x2019;s uncle and guardian, Captain Anthony Sterling (&#x201C;abrupt and perverse&#x201D;), for permission to get to know her better, he was given an &#x201C;emphatic No!&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-27/lt-18520727-JWC-TC-01"><sic>27:187</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1852-07-27">27 July 1852</date></corr></ref>). It was probably one reason for the increasingly strained relations between JWC and Anthony, who had once been fascinated by her, who used to seek her out, and obviously still had much the same feelings for her that had inflamed the jealousy of his <pb id="pg-30-180" n="30:180"/>insane wife, Charlotte.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >K. J. Fielding, &#x201C;Captain Anthony Sterling&#x2019;s Photograph Album and His Relations with Jane Carlyle,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Carlyle Newsletter</hi> 6 (<date when="1985-00-00">1985</date>): 42&#x2013;52.</note> It is quite possible that he is her &#x201C;last love&#x201D; in the tale, which, like Thackeray&#x2019;s, consciously sprang from love and hate.</p>
<p>The whole question of JWC&#x2019;s attitudes to &#x201C;love&#x201D; is so large that it can only be glanced at here. It was a word used more openly, if vaguely, in the mid-nineteenth century than now. Though, as she says, she did not have in mind the idea of writing an actual pamphlet on &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">the Marriage-Question,</hi>&#x201D; she would have had plenty to say if she had, some of which can be found in her letters to young women such as her Liverpool nieces, Kate Sterling, and, later, other young friends who were getting married, such as Isabella Barnes, one of her doctor&#x2019;s daughters. She had obviously discussed marriage with many of her friends and even more closely with Geraldine Jewsbury, and, like her, she took up a position demanding much greater freedom for women than they found in their scorned Mrs. Sarah Stickney Ellis (mentioned in the tale), author of a highly conventional series on <hi rend="italic">The Women of England, The Daughters of England,</hi> and so on (see <ref target="volume-21/lt-18460819-JWC-HW-01"><sic>21:18</sic><corr>JWC to JW, <date when="1846-08-19">19 Aug. 1846</date></corr></ref>). It was, in fact, the central theme of most of Jewsbury&#x2019;s novels, such as <hi rend="italic">Zoe</hi> (<date when="1845-00-00">1845</date>), which she had started with JWC and their friend Elizabeth Paulet, or <hi rend="italic">The Half-Sisters</hi> (<date when="1848-00-00">1848</date>), which (to TC&#x2019;s annoyance) Jewsbury dedicated to her two former collaborators. JWC read with approval the novels of writers such as the influential and almost notorious George Sand and more widely in French literature. In one light, her company at the Grange and in London reflected conventionally respectable, intelligent, mid-Victorian society, while in another, it also represented a sophisticated cosmopolitan world including such figures as Lady Harriet&#x2019;s mother, Lady Sandwich, with her aristocratic French connections, or Lady Harriet herself, whose great-grandfather was the notorious fourth Earl of Sandwich. British society itself (as JWC remarks) was less restricted than we are often led to believe, with its own frequent &#x201C;grand passions&#x201D; to enliven it &#x201C;at the present day.&#x201D; The Welsh and Carlyle families, if we think only of JWC&#x2019;s second cousin, the dandy Captain James Baillie, were lively enough at times.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Journal, <date when="1856-03-29">29 March 1856</date>, and K. J. Fielding, &#x201C;Captain James Belial Baillie&#x2014;Jane Carlyle&#x2019;s Wicked Cousin: Unpublished Pages from the <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences,</hi>&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Carlyle Newsletter</hi> 4 (<date when="1983-00-00">1983</date>): 2&#x2013;11.</note></p>
<p>Or, to take another turn in looking at the spirit in which she wrote, she herself acknowledges that she had a very feminine (or human) delight in admiration. Whenever she returns to the scenes of her youth and childhood, in Haddington or elsewhere, it is never without noting encounters with her former &#x201C;lovers&#x201D; and admirers; she is struck by the way in which the three generations of the Sterling family had been obsessed or fascinated by her; and, whether writing for herself or others, she is always pleased to note that <pb id="pg-30-181" n="30:181"/>men were delighted by her company. Only a month or two before starting the story, she had answered a letter from John Stodart, who had written to inform her of his unabated love for her since she was fifteen, so that she had told even TC that &#x201C;the Laws of nature in the matter of Love seem to be decidedly getting themselves newmade&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-27/lt-18520907-JWC-TC-01"><sic>27:272</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1852-09-07">7 Sept. 1852</date></corr></ref>). Almost all of this has been known before, though not the recognizable reference in <hi rend="italic">Simple Story</hi> to TC&#x2019;s six-year-old sister Jean, who was transfixed by her passionate jealousy of a friend of her elder brother, the same sister who had come to live with them at Craigenputtoch, who drove her distracted by coming to breakfast in curl-papers, and whom JWC thought had as passionately strong a will as TC&#x2014;and who was to be Alexander Carlyle&#x2019;s mother-in-law.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Ellen Twistleton&#x2019;s account of life at Craigenputtoch (267).</note></p>
<p>This brings us to what is new in the manuscript account, and what pointed if fairly minor changes Alexander Carlyle made. For details down to the last comma, readers must make their own comparisons with the versions he gives and Froude&#x2019;s paragraphs in his <hi rend="italic">Life</hi>. Those that are important are given in the notes. Now that the text is given from the manuscript, it is the story that matters most, rather than what imperfect editors make of it. In fact, their slight misrepresentations are a warning to attend to JWC rather than to them&#x2014;or the present editors. We have noted how the booklet in which the tale is written may have been started as a commonplace book. Alexander Carlyle did his best to make it blander, tidying away Shakespeare and the Duke of Rochefoucauld at the beginning, and leaving out such references as those to the scandalous Ninon de Lenclos, the Duke of Wellington&#x2019;s amours, to &#x201C;Christ Almighty!,&#x201D; and to the young Jean Carlyle, and omitting the story about Dido and the doll.</p>
<p>It is partly in the same spirit that Alexander refused to permit the licence of JWC&#x2019;s peculiar spelling and punctuation or Scotticisms and muddled the nature of the tale by his own confusion about the ending. For JWC&#x2019;s story of the young preacher who signed himself off to God as his &#x201C;obedient servant&#x201D; when taking family prayers, is an example of a familiar family story: it does <hi rend="italic">not</hi> mean that the tale itself was written as if it were an &#x201C;Imaginary Letter,&#x201D; as Alexander Carlyle says (<hi rend="italic">NLM</hi> 2:47), familiar as it seems in its directly addressing its readers. Yet this raises the question of what kind of work it is.</p>
<p>It is a strange mixture of autobiography, cautionary tale, and self-scrutiny, probably naive in certain ways, though some may possibly want to see it as sophisticated. As she says, &#x201C;Christ Almighty!&#x201D;&#x2014;it is inconceivable that, in its present form, it was meant for publication! It is a point that need not be labored. Perhaps it was written for a self-expression daunted by an inability to express her full feeling about love in open discussion at the Grange. She is clearly exasperated with TC, though not all her comments are ill-natured. It <pb id="pg-30-182" n="30:182"/>is, after all, presumably only a second draft at best, meant to be shown to no one but her closest friends. Yet it wobbles or oscillates between almost naked autobiography and fictional subterfuge. The pretty child at the dancing school, with a bold way of dealing with menacing geese or turkeys, is familiar from the stories recorded by Geraldine Jewsbury (Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> 41ff.). So, to some extent, are her remarkable footnotes, particularly the one on learning Latin. Her remarks about having &#x201C;no religion&#x201D; are echoed in her letters: that is to say, no Christian religion. Without the need for prolonged investigation it is clear that the setting belongs to Haddington, with its close-knit community into which the troops were more or less absorbed. It is written to reply to &#x201C;the greatest Philosopher of our day&#x201D; (one of JWC&#x2019;s usual terms for TC), an actual &#x201C;Mr C,&#x201D; though it was kept from him while she was alive. The young woman who has &#x201C;lost her honour&#x201D; wildly calls her &#x201C;M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi>&#x2014;,&#x201D; but at the end, the narrator signs herself off as &#x201C;J&#x2014; &#x2014;,&#x201D; after the story of the young preacher, as likely to indicate JBW (her initials before marriage) as JWC. She makes use of the coterie speech she shared with her husband and employed in letters and speech, usually regardless of whether it was exactly understood. Yet, in fact, she is hardly sure who she is: the once &#x201C;spoilt-child&#x201D; of Haddington, as she calls herself, or a fading woman who has &#x201C;left her youth behind,&#x201D; a remark, her husband was to note elsewhere, she often repeated with light-hearted pathos.</p>
<p>True, there is no St. Mark&#x2019;s in Haddington or Chelsea, nor does she say there is. She probably never had a governess. Yet it is hard or impossible not to believe in the blue-eyed artillery boy, or the smug fat rival who ends in the madhouse, or in the feelings of the nine-year-old child who is to turn into Mrs. C., married to Mr. C., &#x201C;the greatest philosopher.&#x201D; That is the point.</p>
<p>If we ask what we are to make of it all, it is an extremely personal paper, written with great liveliness, without a pedantic attention to actuality, perhaps inspired, like most of her writings, by a wish to address someone particular who is needed as an audience. It is a scrap of her autobiography as she liked to think of it: neither as fantastic as <hi rend="italic">Sartor Resartus</hi> nor as pedantic, after all, as editors usually are. JWC was a performer as much as a writer. She did not believe that there was room in one house for two writers. But her expressive skill, her balance, and <foreign><hi rend="italic">bravura</hi></foreign> gave her the chance to be more than captivating.</p>
<p>The message is a simple one: not to give one&#x2019;s heart away impulsively, as she herself had been warned, and not to be &#x201C;an excitable character like me&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-24/lt-18490726-JWC-TC-01"><sic>24:148</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1849-07-26">26 July 1849</date></corr></ref>). Yet where would love be without impulse? She was to fear that Kate Sterling might marry from desperation, loneliness, or the wish to get away from her uncle. Elsewhere, she was to note the tragic story of a young girl forced into a loveless marriage. There is no doubt that she decidedly regretted her own marriage at times, though determined to make the best of it. <pb id="pg-30-183" n="30:183"/>The story, therefore, cannot stand by itself. There are too many strands and allusions that relate to her life. She would rightly never have claimed to rival the greatest female writers or &#x201C;writing women&#x201D; of her time, whom Dickens, thinking of her spell-binding ability to tell him a story face to face, said she so easily excelled. But she had the spirit to create a lively image of herself. John Forster knew her well, and says, quoting Dickens, that there was a &#x201C;radiance&#x201D; in her &#x201C;subtle serious humour&#x201D; and power to find the truth &#x201C;in trifling bits of character&#x201D; that, at times, could be combined with &#x201C;some of the highest gifts of intellect.&#x201D;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Forster, <hi rend="italic">The Life of Charles Dickens,</hi> ed.

<p>Now; that Life is made up of innumerable things, besides Love, is an assertion which &#x201C;truth compels us to admit&#x201D; (as the old Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Review used to say of such statements as two and two make four, and thrice seven is twenty one); and as to all that of a Heroic Age clapping an extinguisher on its &#x201C;thing people call Love&#x201D;; tho believing no syllable of it myself, naturally; I should be loth to <hi rend="italic">unsettle</hi> anyone who does. But when M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C would coolly lay the whole human race under a natural impossibility of loving except during &#x201C;a very few years,&#x2014;a quite insignificant fraction of Man&#x2019;s Life&#x201D;; my whole inner woman revolts against such position, which I find to be neither true nor well imagined. and regard, moreover, as a personal affront.</p>

<p>Would M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C be so good as count. The Iron Duke,&#x2014;our <hi rend="italic">Hero,</hi> tho not to be sure, in &#x201C;a Heroic age of the World,&#x201D; was upwards of eighty when he fell in Love with M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Jones of Pantglass; having never, within the memory of Man, been <hi rend="italic">out of</hi> love with somebody or other,&#x2014;fell in Love with <hi rend="italic">her</hi> to what pitch of&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">assiduity,</hi> at least, may be seen from the extravagant abuse with which a mere M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Jones of Pantglass is distinguished by the grandest Ladies of the Land. And, on the other hand, I could name a married woman,<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;This is my Sister Jean (Mrs Aitken): I remember that Sixth-year Passage very well&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note in ink on MS above &#x201C;married woman&#x201D;).

Now; since human nature may commence falling in Love at <hi rend="italic">six,</hi> and may be still falling in love at <hi rend="italic">eighty two;</hi> there are <hi rend="italic">seventy six</hi> &#x201C;years of Man&#x2019;s life,&#x201D; dear M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C, over which &#x201C;the thing people call love&#x201D; does actually &#x201C;spread itself&#x201C;&#x2014;seventy six years which there is no gainsaying, and perhaps there may be more, tho&#x2019; of that I have no evidence as yet.

<p>Well then; I was somewhat more advanced in Life than the Child in the foresaid breach-of-promise case, when I fell in love for the first time. In fact I had completed my ninth year, or, as I phrased it, was &#x201C;going ten.&#x201D; One night, at a Dancing-school-Ball, a Stranger-Boy put a slight on me which I resented to my very finger-ends, and out of that tumult of hurt vanity sprang my first love to life, like Venus out of the froth of the sea!!&#x2014; So my first love resembled my last in this at least, that it began in <hi rend="italic">quasi</hi> hatred.<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly meaning Anthony Sterling.

<p>Nor were <hi rend="italic">his</hi> the only details which impressed me at that Ball: If you would like to know my own Ball-dress, I can tell you every item of it; a white Indian muslin frock open behind, &#x26; trimmed with <hi rend="italic">twelve</hi> rows of satin ribbon, a broad white satin sash reaching to my heels, little white kid shoes. and embroidered silk stockings,&#x2014;which last are in a box up stairs, &#x2018;along with the cap I was christened in,&#x2019; my poor Mother having preserved both in lavender up to the day of her death.</p>

Our dancing-Master was always shaking his head at her and saying; &#x201C;heavy! heavy!&#x2014;&#x201D; But her wax-doll face took the fancy of Boys at that period, as afterwards, it was <hi rend="italic">the rage</hi> with men; till her <hi rend="italic">head,</hi> unsteady from the first discovery of her, got fairly turned with <pb id="pg-30-188" n="30:188"/>admiration, and she ended in a Madhouse, that Girl! Ah! had I seen, by <hi rend="italic">second sight,</hi> at the Ball there, the ghastly doom ahead of her,&#x2014;only some dozen years ahead!&#x2014;could I have had the heart to grudge her one triumph over me, or any Partner she could get? But no foreshadow of the future Madhouse rested on her and me that glancing evening; tho&#x2019; one of us&#x2014;and I dont mean <hi rend="italic">her</hi> was feeling rather <hi rend="italic">mad</hi>. No! never had I been so outraged in my short life! never so enraged at a Boy!

<p>For six or eight months, I was constantly meeting him at childrens balls and teaparties; we danced in the same dances, played in the same games, and &#x201C;knew each other to speak to&#x201D;; but the fat girl was always present, and always preferred.

<p>Next to seeing the Boy&#x2019;s self, I liked making little calls on his Mother; but how the first call, which was the difficulty, got made, I have only a half remembrance; or rather I <hi rend="italic">remember it</hi> <hi rend="small-caps">two</hi> <hi rend="italic">different ways</hi>(!!);&#x2014;a form of <hi rend="italic">forgetfulness</hi> not uncommon with me.

Then; as often as she spoke to me of her son, and she spoke I think of little else; it was in a way to leave no doubt in my mind, that the first wish of her (M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Scholey&#x2019;s) heart was to see him and <hi rend="italic">me</hi> ultimately united; and there is no expressing how it soothed me under the confirmed indifference of the son to feel myself so <hi rend="italic">appreciated</hi> by his Mother. Nor was M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Scholey herself my sole attraction to that Barrack; the Boy, be it clearly understood, I <hi rend="italic">never</hi> saw there, or assuredly I should have made myself scarce; God forbid that at even nine years of age I should have had so little sense,&#x2014;not to say spirit,&#x2014;as to be <hi rend="italic">throwing myself</hi> in the way of a Boy who wanted nothing with me! Oh no!&#x2014; The Boy was all day at a school in the Town, within a gunshot of my own door,&#x2014;a quarter of a mile at least nearer <hi rend="italic">me</hi> than his Mother. For the other attraction the Barrack-room possessed for me; it was <hi rend="italic">a Portrait</hi>&#x2014;nothing more or less!&#x2014;a dear little oval miniature of the Boy, in <hi rend="italic">petticoats;</hi> done for him in his second or third year; and <hi rend="italic">so</hi> like, I thought; making allowance for the greater chubbiness of Babyhood, and the little pink frock, of <hi rend="italic">no sex</hi>. At each visit I drank in this &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Portrait charmant</hi>&#x201D; [charming portrait] with my eyes, and wished myself artist enough to copy it. Indeed had one of the Fairies, I delighted to read of, stept <hi rend="italic">out of the Book,</hi> in a moment of enthusiasm, to grant any <hi rend="italic">one</hi> thing I asked; I would have said&#x2014;I am sure I would&#x2014;&#x201C;the <hi rend="italic">Portrait charmant,</hi> then, since you <hi rend="italic">are</hi> so good, all to myself, for altogether&#x201D;!</p>
<p>Still I hadn&#x2019;t as yet, to the best of my remembrance admitted to myself (to <hi rend="italic">others</hi> would have been impossible) that I was head and ears in love. Indeed an admission so entirely discreditable to to<note n="26" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> me couldn&#x2019;t be too long suppressed. Oh little Miss W&#x2014;h! at your time of life and with your advantages, to go and fall in love with an Artillery boy, and he not caring a pin for you! It <pb id="pg-30-190" n="30:190"/>was really very shocking&#x2014;very! And let us hope, I should have felt all that was proper on the discovery of my infatuation, if the circumstances under which it was made had been less poignant! The Boy&#x2019;s regiment had received orders to march!</p>
<p>To Ireland I think it was; but the <hi rend="italic">where</hi> was nothing. For me, in my then geographical blankness, the marching beyond my own sphere of vision was a marching into Infinite Space! So; two more days and the Boy, his Mother, his regiment, and all that was his, would be in Infinite Space for me! Here was a prospect, to enlighten one on the state of one&#x2019;s heart, if anything could! <hi rend="italic">Now</hi> I knew all I had felt for him and all I felt; and I forgave him all about the fat girl; and&#x2014;*<note n="27" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC wrote a note on the next page, under a short line, indicated by her asterisks; JWC&#x2019;s three notes indented in sq. br.

<p>Had I stopt there well and good but a sudden thought struck me,&#x2014;a project of consolation so subversive of &#x201C;female delicacy,&#x201D; that I almost blush to write it.

No! my project was less <hi rend="italic">flagrantly</hi> compromising, and something <hi rend="italic">might</hi> be gained by it. It was this simply; to persuade M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Scholey to leave the little oval miniature with me, in loan; on the understanding that when I <hi rend="italic">was grown up</hi> and <hi rend="italic">should have</hi> money, I would return it to her <hi rend="italic">set with diamonds;</hi> and as immediate tribute of gratitude, or pure esteem,&#x2014;whichever she liked,&#x2014;I would present her with my gold filigree needlecase,&#x2014;the only really valuable thing I possessed and sent me from India all the way, but it might go,&#x2014;without a sigh,&#x2014;in part payment of <hi rend="italic">such</hi> a favour!

<p>It was not without misgivings enough that I entered on this questionable enterprise; I felt its questionability, in every fibre of my small frame. But what then? The day after tomorrow, the Boy&#x2019;s self would be in Infinite Space for me, and if I had not his picture to com[f]ort me, how on earth should I be comforted?

<p>Minerva, I remember;&#x2014;I had got converted to Paganism in the course of learning Latin, and Minerva was my chosen godess&#x2014;and, in the first interval of lessons, ran off to the Artillery Barracks, taking the gold needlecase in my hand; and never had <hi rend="italic">it</hi> looked so pretty! M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Scholey was at home, packing up (Ah me!), and the miniature was in its old place. I had been so afraid of <hi rend="italic">it</hi> <pb id="pg-30-193" n="30:193"/>being packed up, that the mere seeing it seemed a step in getting it. <hi rend="italic">There</hi> it hung, by its black ribbon from a nail over the fireplace, and &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">didnt I wish I might get it</hi>&#x201D;?

Still&#x2014;how to unfold my business even in that order? My position became every moment more false; I sat with burning cheeks and palpitating heart; my tounge refusing &#x201C;its office&#x201D; save on indifferent topics, till I felt that in common decency I could sit no longer. And then only,&#x2014;in the supreme moment of bidding M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Scholey farewell,&#x2014;did I find courage to present my needlecase, with what words I know not; but certainly without one word about the picture; for her rapid acceptance of my really handsome gift, as a &#x201C;good the gods had provided her,&#x201D;<note n="42" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Dryden, &#x201C;Alexander&#x2019;s Feast,&#x201D; 106.</note> and no more about it, quite took away my remaining breath; and next minute I found myself in the open air, &#x201C;a sadder and a wiser <hi rend="italic">child</hi>&#x201D;!<note n="43" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Coleridge, &#x201C;The Ancient Mariner,&#x201D; last stanza.</note></p>

<p>For the rest, young Scholey, (I wish I could have recollected his first name!) had slipt thro&#x2019; my fingers like a knotless thread: he never came back to learn our fates (the fat girl&#x2019;s and mine), nor did news of him dead or alive ever reach me; and so, in no great length of time,&#x2014; before I had given him a successor even,&#x2014;he passed for me into a sort of Myth; nor for a quarter of a century had I thought as much of him, put it all together, as I have done in writing these few sheets.</p>
<p>It would have made a more &#x201C;thrilling narrative&#x201D; to read, if this love of mine had been returned; for with the <hi rend="italic">reciprocity</hi> all on one side,&#x201D;<note n="45" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech.</note> as the Irish say,&#x2014;the interest flags, don&#x2019;t you find?&#x2014; On the whole my first love wasn&#x2019;t the smart piece of work to have been predicted of such a smart little girl,&#x2014;a girl so renowned for her eyelashes, her Latin, and her wit.

<p>MS A is a black, hard-backed notebook, 4&#xBD; &#xd7; 7 ins. (11 &#xd7; 18 cm.) with 138 faintly lined, unnumbered pages. A small piece of paper is attached to the front of the book on which TC has written &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Diary</hi> of <hi rend="italic">Hers,</hi> / <date when="1855-10-21">21 Oct<hi rend="italic">r</hi> 1855</date>&#x2013;<date when="1856-04-02">2 April 1856</date>.&#x201D; The first lined page is the reverse of the front endpaper and is blank. The next page has been cut out. All the rest of the pages have been written on, including the endpaper (recto). A letter from Jewsbury to Froude, <date when="1876-11-22">22 Nov. 1876</date> (see 263) has been attached to the inside front cover. Several other letters have been glued into the notebook, probably by JWC, including two from James Baillie, the first of which JWC says she is putting in the Journal (see <ref target="volume-30/ed-30-jane-welsh-carlyle-journal"><sic>236</sic><corr>JWC&#x2019;s Journal, <date when="1856-03-28">28 March</date></corr></ref>). These letters are given below in footnotes at the point where they are attached to the MS. At the back of the notebook there are two notes; on the left endpaper: &#x201C;Part of this journal was taken out by Carlyle and placed in his own Memoir of Her the <hi rend="italic">transcript</hi> is here so that nothing is wanting&#x201D;; on the right endpaper: &#x201C;Note in pencil on the opposite p. is by J. A. Froude. / A. C.&#x201D; Froude is mistaken; no pages have been taken from the end of MS A.</p>
<p>A soft leather-bound notebook, 4 &#xd7; 6 ins. (10 &#xd7; 16 cm.), covered with brown paper (NLS: MS 532), is contained in a box with MS B. On its front cover A. Carlyle has written &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">The Jewsbury Notebook</hi> / &#x2018;Mythic Jottings&#x2019; / &#x26; / T.C&#x2019;s Commentary.&#x201D; The first 126 pages contain Jewsbury&#x2019;s stories from JWC; she heads them &#x201C;In Memoriam / J.W.C. / ob: <date when="1866-04-21">Apr<hi rend="italic">l</hi> 21&#x2013;1866</date>&#x201D; (pbd: Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> 41&#x2013;66). Immediately after Jewsbury&#x2019;s narratives (ending &#x201C;Chelsea <date when="1856-05-20">May 20</date>&#x2013;<date when="1866-00-00">1866</date> / G.E.J.&#x201D;), TC writes a letter to Jewsbury, <date when="1866-05-22">22 May 1866</date> (see Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> 66), then, on 128, he begins his reminiscences of JWC with &#x201C;<hi rend="italic"><date when="1866-05-25">25 May 1866</date></hi>. Geraldine returns me this little Book of Myths.&#x201D; He fills the rest of the notebook (to page 142).</p>
<p>MS B is now bound into a flexible white notebook, 5 &#xd7; 7&#xBD; &#xd7; &#xBE; ins. (12 &#xd7; 19 &#xd7; 2 cm.) with leather ties. The first page (recto) has a piece of card taped on with a note: &#x201C;Mrs. Carlyle&#x2019;s Notebook (and the first half of her Journal)&#x201D; (in an unidentified hand); &#x201C;<hi rend="small-caps">vol</hi> II. (Notes &#x26;c on the mythic jottings, <hi rend="italic">contin</hi>d ((ended, and tied up (<date when="1866-07-28">28 july 1866</date>)&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note on a separate, attached fragment). Overleaf (verso) JWC has written &#x201C;Vol 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>&#x201D;; this is crossed out and, in TC&#x2019;s hand, is added: &#x201C;(<hi rend="italic">Her</hi> poor Notebook at one time; contained nothing but some leaves from <date when="1856-00-00">1856</date>; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I have <hi rend="italic">shifted</hi> to a place farther on (approximately their place in <hi rend="italic">time;</hi>&#x2014;and do now, as sequel to Geraldine&#x2019;s mythic jottings and my crit<hi rend="italic">ms</hi> on them, again mark in such altered circ<hi rend="italic">s,</hi> as, what it was originally called, / &#x2018;Vol. 2&#x2019;.&#x201D; Below is a pencil note: &#x201C;Imperfect. The first part of the original was not sent to me / JAF&#x201D; (meaning unclear). TC&#x2019;s reminiscences continue from 1&#x2013;146. MS B is then sewn in at the end of TC&#x2019;s entry for <date when="1866-07-03">3 July 1866</date>. A. Carlyle notes: &#x201C;Carlyle removed the covers from this Note-book, &#x2018;No. 2,&#x2019; and introduced the leaves bodily, at their proper date, into the larger Note-book in which he was writing the &#x2018;Jane Welsh Carlyle,&#x2019; his intention evidently being that this part of his Wife&#x2019;s Journal should be read along with his own narrative&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">NLM</hi> 2:87). At the top of the first page of MS B, TC writes: &#x201C;&#x2014; &#x2014; &#x2014; mournful to me while I live&#x2014;(<hi rend="italic">end</hi> of page, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> this is to follow / <date when="1866-07-06">July 6 1866</date>[)]&#x201D;; this is a repetition of the last line of TC&#x2019;s reminiscences, dated <date when="1866-07-03">3 July</date> (Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> 158), making clear where he wants the Journal inserted. It was <pb id="pg-30-198" n="30:198"/>presumably sewn in later; the pages of TC&#x2019;s reminiscences of JWC in this notebook were numbered continuously from 1 to 198 by Mary Aitken Carlyle, while the inserted pages of JWC&#x2019;s Journal (MS B) were numbered in pencil 147* to 206*, presumably by A. Carlyle. Any pages missing (see below) were cut out before MS B was numbered.</p>
<p>Two further, unnumbered leaves in TC&#x2019;s hand (<date when="1866-07-24">24 July 1866</date>, <date when="1866-07-28">28 July 1866</date>) and one leaf in Jewsbury&#x2019;s hand [late <date when="1866-05-00">May 1866</date>] are attached to the white notebook (Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> 196&#x2013;99). The last page is blank except for a small note by TC, &#x201C;Insertion II. (put in, july 25).&#x201D;</p>
<p>There are other items stored in the box with the notebooks, including a small piece of blue paper with what look like some of TC&#x2019;s jottings on Frederick; on the back is written, in an unknown hand, &#x201C;attached to p. 72 Mrs Carlyle&#x2019;s notebook,&#x201D; and two loose leaves, numbered 1 and 5, on the back of which TC has written notes; on 1: &#x201C;rudim<hi rend="italic">ts</hi> of <hi rend="small-caps">preface</hi>&#x201D;; on 5: (<hi rend="italic">rudiments of</hi> <hi rend="small-caps">Preface</hi>) / (<date when="1868-11-00">Nov<hi rend="italic">r</hi> 1868</date>)&#x201D; and, in another hand: &#x201C;Found loose in this notebook / HWM.&#x201D; For the rudimentary preface; see Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> 40&#x2013;41.</p>

James fondly recalled the Carlyles&#x2019; hospitality and &#x201C;the many hours of unalloyed entertainment his ungrudging fireside afforded me.&#x201D; He admired Carlyle&#x2019;s genius, but criticized his lack of sympathy and understanding: &#x201C;[He] had very much of the narrowness, intellectual and moral, which one might expect to find in a descendant of the old Covenanting stock, bred to believe in God as essentially inhuman, and in man, accordingly, as exposed to a great deal of divine treachery and vindictiveness, which were liable to come rattling about his devoted ears the moment his back was turned.&#x201D; According to James, Carlyle especially resented Americans because they assumed he was a radical: &#x201C;Nothing maddened him so much as to be mistaken for a reformer, really intent upon the interests of God&#x2019;s righteousness upon the earth, which are the interests of universal justice. This is what made him hate Americans, and call us a nation of bores,&#x2014;that we took him at his word, and reckoned upon him as a sincere well-wisher to his species&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">The Literary Remains of the Late Henry James,</hi> ed.

American tho he be. He was very amusing about the Spirits. On <hi rend="italic">their</hi> side of the water, he said the &#x201C;spirits&#x201D; had outbreaks of devilishness, which made them less tiresome than our Spirits &#x201C;on this side.&#x201D; An acquaintance of his, having been answered gravely by a Spirit for some time, was going on with &#x201C;but there is one other thing I wish to&#x201C;&#x2014; &#x201C;Go to Hell you infernal idiot&#x201D;! said the Spirit&#x2014;and the words came with the more startling effect that they were <hi rend="italic">spoken;</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Medium</hi> being a little sickly innocent child!&#x2014; A gentleman who married D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Parkman&#x2019;s sister had a conversation one time with the spirit of Parkman, who told him he was getting on capitally in the other world, and that Webster (the man who murdered him because he owed him money) had paid up his debt.<note n="21" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John White Webster (<date when="1793-00-00">1793</date>&#x2013;<date when="1850-00-00">1850</date>), prof. of chemistry and mineralogy at Harvard, was pursued for debts by Dr. George Parkman (<date when="1790-00-00">1790</date>&#x2013;<date when="1849-00-00">1849</date>). He was accused of murdering Parkman on <date when="1849-11-23">23 Nov. 1849</date> in his laboratory, where he unsuccessfully tried to dispose of the body. Webster&#x2019;s confession to the Rev. George Putnam was widely believed to be a hoax, and his death sentence was condemned by lawyers and public opinion. He was hanged, <date when="1850-08-30">30 Aug. 1850</date>. Parkman had two sisters; Elizabeth, m. Robert Gould Shaw, Parkman&#x2019;s business partner, who testified at his trial, and Deliverance, m.

<p><date when="1855-10-25">25<hi rend="italic">th</hi></date> &#x201C;Oh good gracious <hi rend="italic">alive</hi>&#x201D;! what a whirlwind&#x2014;or rather whirl-pool of a day!&#x2014;Breakfast had &#x201C;passed off&#x201D; better or worse, and I was at work on a picture-frame,&#x2014;my own invention and pretending to be a little &#x201C;work of art&#x201C;&#x2014;; when M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C&#x2019;s bell rang like mad, and was followed by cries of, &#x201C;come! come! <hi rend="italic">are</hi> you coming?&#x201C;&#x2014; Arrived at the second landing, three steps at a time, I saw M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C and Ann in the spare bed room, hazily, <hi rend="italic">thro&#x2019; a waterfall!</hi> The great cistern had overflowed; and it was &#x201C;raining and pouring down&#x201D; thro&#x2019; the <hi rend="italic">new</hi> ceiling, and plashing up on the <hi rend="italic">new</hi> carpet! All the baths and basins in the house and even &#x201C;vessels of dishonour&#x201D; were quickly assembled on the floor, and I on my knees mopping up with towels and sponges. When the water ceased to pour thro the ceiling, it began to pour thro the roof of the bed! If the water had only been clean! but it was black as soot, and the ground of the carpet white! At last it faired in the Spare Room, and I retired to change my shoes and stockings, which were soaked, as if I had been <hi rend="italic">fishing</hi> while doing this, I became aware of a patter-pattering in the drawing room; and looking in, perceived a quite romantic little lake on the green Brussels carpet! There too the water had flooded half the ceiling. More mopping with towels and sponges, and another pair of shoes and stockings soaked. Finally, after three hours of this sort of thing, I came down to the parlour fire; and the first thing I saw was great black splashes of wet on the parlour ceiling!&#x2014; What <hi rend="italic">am</hi> I to do with all these spoiled ceilings and carpets? And how is &#x2018;the water&#x2019; to be prevented coming again when it likes?</p>
<p>On the later question I held an hour-long discussion with Chalmers and M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Tait&#x2014;relieved by practical experiments all resulting in advice to &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">find out the cause of the overflow and then to take steps to remove it</hi>.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Ruskin has sent an answer to my answer; and in this instance the <hi rend="italic">man&#x2019;s</hi> Letter is ten times as long as the <hi rend="italic">woman&#x2019;s</hi> was.&#x2014;<note n="35" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ruskin&#x2019;s letter is attached beside this entry: &#x201C;Sunday Evening [<date when="1855-10-28">28 Oct. 1855</date>] / Dear M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle / I don&#x2019;t wonder you were <hi rend="italic">inclined</hi> to find fault with me&#x2014;(only you must not be so any more)&#x2014;for I think women are quite right in refusing to believe, or understand, that men may be so absorbed in their work as to forget or <hi rend="italic">neglect</hi> their friends. Men may <hi rend="italic">not</hi> be so absorbed&#x2014; Never are so absorbed. They neither have friends&#x2014;nor deserve to have them, if their work induces any such neglect. But there is a wide difference between neglecting, and not going to see&#x2014;nor troubling one&#x2019;s friends&#x2014;during times when neither can help the other. I believe whatever M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle and you tell me; and therefore, that it gives you pleasure when I come to see you.&#x2014; But you yourself declare that M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle has prospered under the Autumnal regimen of neither writing nor talking. Suppose I had known where you were, (which I did not) and had broken in upon you at Addiscombe&#x2014;set M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle off upon some favourite indignation&#x2014;given him a sleepless night&#x2014;and spoiled his ride the next morning&#x2014; Would that have been what you call <hi rend="italic">Attending</hi> to one&#x2019;s friends? I knew you were going out of town somewhere. I did not even ask to know where&#x2014;for when people leave home&#x2014;I think they ought to leave home-thoughts&#x2014;home letters&#x2014;home friends&#x2014;&#x26; everything&#x2014;and have as complete Refreshment&#x2014;novelty&#x2014;and Astonishment, with Tranquillity as the world can afford them. Then&#x2014;I guessed you had come back, but I always think that after one&#x2019;s autumnal rest,&#x2014;the little prolongation of it into a Home Peace&#x2014;nobody knocking at the door&#x2014;and everybody fancying you at the Antipodes&#x2014;while you are settling yourself towards the winter, at the fireside&#x2014;&#x26; getting in Coals&#x2014;has a certain comfort about it also&#x2014;and Sly Pleasantness&#x2014;not to be interfered with except on occasion. But the moment I heard you, that is, Mr C. had been ill I wrote&#x2014;you see&#x2014; And after all&#x2014;I don&#x2019;t see, why you should not have written to <hi rend="italic">me</hi>&#x2014;to tell me when you came home&#x2014;instead of expecting me to go hunting for you among the fine woods of Addiscombe&#x2014;or to drive over Battersea bridge everyday to ask whether you had come home or not! <hi rend="italic">There</hi>. Now don&#x2019;t be inclined to find fault with me ever any more. Not that I have not been busy&#x2014;&#x26; very busy too&#x2014; I have written, since May&#x2014;good sixhundred pages&#x2014;had them rewritten&#x2014;cut up&#x2014;corrected&#x2014;&#x26; got fairly ready for press&#x2014;and am going to press with the first of them on Gunpowder plot day [commemorating Guy Fawkes&#x2019; plot to blow up the Houses of Parliament, <date when="1605-11-05">5 Nov. 1605</date>], with great hope of disturbing the Public Peace in various directions. Also&#x2014;I have prepared above thirty drawings for engravers, this year&#x2014;retouched the engravings&#x2014;(generally the worst part of the business&#x2014;) and etched some on steel myself&#x2014; In the course of the six hundred pages, I have had to make various remarks on German Metaphysics&#x2014; On Poetry; Political Economy; Cookery; Music; Geology; Dress, Agriculture; Horticulture &#x26; Navigation; All which subjects I have had to &#x201C;read up&#x201D; accordingly; and this takes time. Moreover, I have had my class of workmen out sketching every week in the fields, during the summer, and have been studying Spanish Proverbs with my fathers partner, who came over from Spain to see the great Exhibition. I have also designed &#x26; drawn a window for the Museum at Oxford: and have every now and then had to look over a parcel of five or six new designs for fronts or backs to the said museum&#x2014;During my above mentioned studies of Horticulture I became dissatisfied with the Linnaean-Jussieuan [Karl von Linn&#xE9; (<date when="1707-00-00">1707</date>&#x2013;<date when="1778-00-00">78</date>), whose botanical classification system was superseded by the Jusseian system (<date when="1789-00-00">1789</date>), named after B. de Jussieu (<date when="1699-00-00">1699</date>&#x2013;<date when="1777-00-00">1777</date>) and A.

I consider this arrangement one of my great achievements of the year. My studies of political economy have induced me to think also that nobody knows anything about <hi rend="italic">that,</hi> and I am at present engaged in an investigation&#x2014;on independent principles, of the Natures of Money, Rent: and Taxes; in an Abstract form, which sometimes keeps me awake at night. My studies of German Metaphysics have also induced me to think that the Germans don&#x2019;t know anything about <hi rend="italic">them,</hi> and to engage in a serious enquiry into the meaning of Bunsens great sentence in the beginning of the Second volume of Hippolytus, about the Finite realization of Infinity; which has given me some trouble [Christian Bunsen, <hi rend="italic">Hippolytus and His Age,</hi> 4 vols. (<date when="1852-00-00">1852</date>)].

<p>That woman who threw her three children in the water <hi rend="italic">is</hi> mad; poor creature!

On her last Examination (the 4<hi rend="italic">th!</hi>) her husband went up to her and asked how she was? &#x201C;Oh quite well; and you?

When he told her the Baby was dead (it died a few days ago <pb id="pg-30-229" n="30:229"/>from the effects of its half-drowning) &#x201C;she said. &#x201C;Poor little thing! it is a great mercy for it!&#x2014; What good could have come to it in this world&#x2014;all eaten up with scurvy as it was&#x201D;!&#x2014;What a dense mass of lies one must hustle thro&#x2019; to get at the truth of any smallest transaction here!

M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle&#x2019;s statement that one of her reasons for not visiting this Lady before (see <hi rend="italic">ante</hi> p. 11 [see above, <date when="1855-10-31">31 Oct. 1855</date>]) was Carlyle&#x2019;s disapproval of her making new acquaintances on her &#x2018;own basis,&#x2019; is scarcely credible. For she now makes the Lady&#x2019;s acquaintance as much on her &#x2018;own basis&#x2019; as she would have done before,&#x2014;the only difference being that she is introduced by Darwin instead of Miss Jewsbury.

<p>Ellen Twisleton&#x2019;s account of life at Craigenputtoch, <date when="1828-00-00">1828</date>&#x2013;<date when="1834-00-00">34</date> [<date when="1855-11-00">Nov.? 1855</date>]. MS: Houghton bMS Am <date when="1408-00-00">1408</date>: 376. Pbd: K. J. Fielding, &#x201C;The Cry from Craigenputtoch,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Times Literary Supplement</hi> (<date when="1999-08-13">13 Aug. 1999</date>) 13&#x2013;14. Quot: Ashton 102&#x2013;4. The MS appears to be a fair copy with some alterations, written on 27 unnumbered pages of a 28 page booklet, made out of 7 sheets of Ellen Twisleton&#x2019;s monogrammed writing paper folded and stitched together (3&#xBE; &#xd7; 6&#xBD; ins. [10 &#xd7; 16 cm.]) plus a single sheet neatly stitched over the last 6 lines of the 12th page. The account continues on both sides of this sheet which extends below the page and is folded to fit into the notebook. The account is undated but was probably written down soon after Twisleton&#x2019;s letter to her sister, Mary Parkman, <date when="1855-11-23">23 Nov. 1855</date>: &#x201C;I had such a long, interesting talk with Mrs Carlyle the other day, all about their life just after they were married&#x2014;I couldn&#x2019;t help wishing you were in the wall,&#x2014;a more miserable story I never heard,&#x2014;but <hi rend="italic">never say so</hi>&#x201D; (MS: Houghton bMS Am 1408.61). JWC spent an hour with Ellen Twisleton, <date when="1855-11-17">17 Nov.</date> (see Journal, <date when="1855-11-17">17 Nov. 1855</date>); this may have been when the &#x201C;interesting talk&#x201D; took place. The opening of the account suggests that JWC had read a draft; there is no mention of this in either Journal entries up to <date when="1855-12-14">14 Dec.</date> (there was then a gap until <date when="1856-03-24">24 March</date>), or in the only letter she wrote during that time, JWC (writing as Nero) to Ellen Twisleton, <date when="1855-12-03">3 Dec. 1855</date>.</p>
<p>Ellen Twisleton&#x2019;s account of life at Craigenputtoch is placed as an appendix because, though closely related to the main body of the <hi rend="italic">Collected Letters</hi> of this volume, it is not written by either of the Carlyles.</p>
