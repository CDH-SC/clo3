<salute>My dear Father,</salute>
<p>I was sitting <hi rend="italic">over</hi> the fire in a very sluggish humour, reading a little&#x2014;chiefly to keep me out of a worse humour, when the little box was handed in to me quite unexpectedly. I looked for it about the beginning of the week; but all hope of it had left me today. Your letter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dated <date when="1822-01-05">5 Jan.</date> Carlyle&#x2019;s father thanks him for the spectacles and says that he has never owned a pair before.</note> was the first of my acceptable packet, that caught the eye; and for this reason&#x2014;if there were no other&#x2014;I am sufficiently directed to make it the first subject of my present consideration. I am sorry that the task of writing to Mainhill&#x2014;always among the most agre<supplied>[e]</supplied>able of my life&#x2014;finds me so ill prepared for executing it effectively, in the actual state of things. I am not only hurried vastly, but sickish. A beef-steak&#x2014;resembling very much in taste and consistency, a fragment of the Bonshaw Flow<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A marshy tract extending southwest of Bonshaw Tower, an old mansion in the extreme northeast of Annan parish, Dumfriesshire, on the right bank of Kirtle Water, 3 3/4 miles from Ecclefechan. The tower was the seat of Nasmyth Irving.</note>&#x2014;was offered me yesterday as the best my neat little Landlady could come at in all the neighbourhood: hunger stood in place of sauce; and I consumed as food what Nature evidently intended should be consumed as fuel. The consequence was, I slept badly and little overnight. I had also to go this morning and read some old black-letter poems in the Advocates&#x2019; Library: and the stomach, like a true British subject, is rebelling not a little against all these infringements of its rights and privileges. Let it croak as it pleases: I will do my duty: only you must pardon all short comings.</p>
<p>I am very sorry to learn that you have been afflicted with colds of late. Health, as I know too well, must enter into all our enjoyments, as the basis on which every other item of them is to be founded. Let me trust that your disorders are destined to prove of short continuance, and to be succeeded by your wonted firmness of body, in which I believe few men living are better provided than you. Still it should occupy your remembrance now and then that every constitution has its limits in point of strength; and at your years it surely cannot be too much your duty to <hi rend="italic">take care</hi>. I know partly by myself, <hi rend="italic">what</hi> a thing it is with your mind to sit vacant, and how much <hi rend="italic">easier</hi> the full push of vigorous exertion is to you than cowering indolence: but our first <pb id="pg-02-4" n="02:4"/>wishes ought not to be listened to on all occasions; and I take the liberty of a son to beg that you will labour less, and expose yourself less. From youth upward your days have been days of toil: and life would be a wor<supplied>[s]</supplied>e thing than by the blessing of Providence you have found it, if the afternoon of it even to the dusk were to be as full of effort as the morning. I entreat you to think of this, for there is reason in it.</p>
<p>As to the times, it is an evil, which being universal must be promptly and effectually met: and many will fail for want of a remedy, perhaps ninety-nine hundredths of the British farmers, before you need even fear greatly. And if the issue <hi rend="italic">were</hi> to prove unfortunate&#x2014;What then? You can stand it better than many many, whom it would leave without resourse. The worst is over; we are all past childhood: and with so many brave sons to stand between you and danger, why should you be afraid?</p>
<p>For myself the eldest and least profitable of them, I do sometimes think that Fate is about to lift its heavy hand off me; and that I shall yet have it in my power to be useful to you all. My health is considerably better than it was last winter; it will return completely I trust: and my hopes are infinitely more extensive and better founded than they were at the same period. I have abundance of employment, and the expectation of more, and more lucrative, in process of time. There is a place, in particular, about which Irving wrote to me the other day, that promises exceedingly well. It is a Tutorship in a London family who have two sons intended to reside with their parents at Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, till their education is completed. The mother, Irving says, is an excellent person; the sons likely to be more troublesome: but the salary is two hundred a year, a round solid sum, for which a man would submit to much. Accordingly, I have engaged to attend the youths (about fifteen &#x26; 13 years of age) when they arrive, which they are to do shortly&#x2014;in quality of <hi rend="italic">teacher</hi> in the interim, for three months, till their parents arrive, with the understanding that if I like them and they me, I am to undertake the office permanently. If it suit I shall do excellently well: if not&#x2014;happily I can give it to the winds, and fight my own battle again as I have done before.&#x2014; You will find more of this and many other things in the remaining letter&#x2014;here I am at a close.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On <date when="1821-12-24">24 Dec. 1821</date> Irving had accepted an invitation to preach on trial before the directors of the Caledonian Chapel, Hatton Garden, London. Present among many distinguished persons who had come to hear &#x201C;the new man of genius&#x201D; had been the wives of two retired Anglo-Indian judges, Edward Strachey (<date when="1774-00-00">1774</date>&#x2013;<date when="1832-00-00">1832</date>) and Charles Buller (<date when="1774-00-00">1774</date>&#x2013;<date when="1848-00-00">1848</date>). Mrs. Strachey and Mrs. Buller were sisters, daughters of Col. William Kirkpatrick (<date when="1750-00-00">1750</date>&#x2013;<date when="1812-00-00">1812</date>). Mrs. Buller, who had some-what indifferently accompanied her sister to hear Irving preach, had been greatly impressed. Concerned at this time about the education of her two older sons&#x2014; Charles (<date when="1806-00-00">1806</date>&#x2013;<date when="1848-00-00">48</date>), who would gain distinction in Parliament, and Arthur William (<date when="1808-00-00">1808</date>&#x2013;<date when="1869-00-00">69</date>), who would become Sir Arthur and like his father a judge in India&#x2014;she had the next day sought Irving&#x2019;s advice. On <date when="1822-01-03">3 Jan.</date> he wrote to Carlyle: &#x201C;A lady, Mrs. Buller whose husband now recovering held one of the highest situations in India, whose sister&#x2019;s husband at this time is judge of all appeals in India [Edward Strachey]&#x2014;and whose sister [wife of Sir John Louis] is connected with the peerage, took so much fancy to my last Sunday&#x2019;s preaching, that she thought me proper to give advice about the education of her two boys 13 and 15 years old now at Harrow and about to proceed to a Scottish university<supplied>[.]</supplied> After a long conversation, and many plans talked of&#x2014;this was finally agreed on, that to you of whom I spoke to her, this offer should be made&#x2014;that if you would be their Tutor, and live in their house free of all expense, they would give you handsome terms.&#x201D; Sight unseen, Carlyle must have been the subject of Irving&#x2019;s most generous praise to have thus impressed the Bullers. The salary eventually agreed upon was &#xa3;200 a year. For further information about the Bullers and Stracheys, see Carlyle&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences, passim</hi>, and C. R.

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I have not only finished my Father&#x2019;s letter, but also discussed my dinner&#x2014;of more wholesome materials I trust than the las<supplied>[t]</supplied> was; and I now gladly address myself to you. Few things in the world give me greater pleasure than to hear from you or write to you: the thought of a kind Mother is dearer to every human heart than aught beside; &#x26; when at a distance, the echo of her feelings comes home to one with a livelier sensibility than their direct expression when present. I trust many many years of this precious intercourse are yet reserved for us; and happier ones than some of the past have been.</p>
<p>But to business!&#x2014; I must thank you for all the rarities you have sent, in the shape of eatables and wearables: all are highly acceptable; all came safely to hand. The eggs, packed so honestly as they were, arrived quite unharmed. I shall eat them regularly to breakfast; they agree with my silly maw; and one needs some nourishment in these hard times. You will see that I have sent home all my foul clothes. I <pb id="pg-02-6" n="02:6"/>cannot get them well washed here: the landlady&#x2019;s pump gives only water as hard as vinegar, so her washing powers are under a cloud; and yet she is the best hand I have tried here. You get infinitely too much <foreign><hi rend="italic">fash</hi></foreign> [bother] with me: but I cannot help it.</p>
<p>It is needless to say that I participate in the enjoyment you derive from the continuance of health; a blessing, which, in this singularly unwholesome winter, I am more than usually happy to be assured, continues with you, in some moderate degree. Be thankful; and to shew your thankfulness, <hi rend="italic">be careful</hi>! For my own share, I ought not to complain much either. This room of mine is very excellent in almost all respects. The air is next to perfectly pure, the place is quiet very quiet; and the landlady is among the best I have ever had. If she be a particle less careful than old Mrs Robertson, she is equally clean, and far blither, because far healthier and happier.</p>
<p>With all these advantages of an external kind, and many more of an internal kind, it were a shame to be quite unwell. Accordingly I do not ail much. Every night I usually get a moderate sleep; and tho&#x2019; my stomach is never absolutely in good humour, yet by the aid of a little medicine, I contrive to make it get thro&#x2019; its work in some shape, and that unutterable nervousness which I laboured under while at home and far worse before, is now in a great measure gone. I can think and feel like other people; my heart is again become a heart of flesh; and the <hi rend="italic">grime</hi> is gradually vanishing from the mirror of the mind. By and by, it will be bright as a new-scoured tankard, or as Will Boggs&#x2019;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Boggs lived at Ecclefechan. See <ref target="volume-03/lt-18240625-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1824-06-25">25 June 1824</date></ref>.</note> boots; and I shall see all things clearly as I was wont. My dear Mother, never be uneasy on my account! I tell you I am going to become a very &#x2019;sponsible character yet, and a credit to the whole parish. Seriously, I have better hopes than ever I had,&#x2014;considerably better.</p>
<p>I know not whether you have heard of Irving&#x2019;s journey to London. He went thither, about three weeks ago, by special request, to close a bargain with the directors of a Scotch Chapel<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hatton Garden Chapel, connected with the Caledonian Asylum (a children&#x2019;s orphanage). Irving went to London to undertake his work there in <date when="1822-07-00">July</date>. See <ref target="volume-02/lt-18221220-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1822-12-20">20 Dec.</date></ref></note> there, as to becoming their minister. I believe he has produced a great impression; and is likely (if certain legal formalities can be got rid of) to become their pastor under very favourable auspices, and to earn a vast renown for himself and do much good among the religious inhabitants of the Metropolis. There are not ten men living that deserve it better. His <pb id="pg-02-7" n="02:7"/>journey is also likely to prove of some consequence to me. A Lady of a great Indian Judge, obliged at present to come home for his health&#x2019;s sake,&#x2014;one Mrs Buller heard Irving preach, and without farther introduction called upon him next day to talk about the education of her two sons; now at a noted school near London, Harrow on the Hill. It was settled that they were to go to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>; and I was proposed as their Tutor with a yearly fee of &#xa3;200, and good accommodations in the house. The woman he says is a gallant accomplished person and will respect me well. He warned her that I had seen little of life, and was disposed to be rather high in the humour, if not well used. She agreed to send the boys into some family in Town for three months, till her husband and she could themselves come; and wished me to take charge of them in the mean time, any way;&#x2014;for altogether if we should suit each other. I accepted the offer: and shall get fifty pounds for my quarter&#x2019;s work, however it prove. The place if I like it and be fit for it, will be advantageous for me in many aspects. I shall have time for study, and convenience for it, and plenty of cash. At the same time, as it is uncertain, I do not make it my bower-anchor, by any means. If it go to pot altogether, as it well enough may, I shall snap my finger and thumb in the face of all the Indian judges of the Earth, and return to my poor desk and quill, with as hard a heart as ever.&#x2014; But you see I am over with it for a time; and must withdraw abruptly. Write whenever you can. <closer><salute>I am ever,</salute></closer></p>

<dateline><place>3. Moray-street</place>, Saturday-evening [<date when="1822-01-12">12 January 1822</date>].</dateline>
<salute>My dear Alick,</salute>
<p>I received your letter&#x2014;one of the longest and best you ever sent me&#x2014;with the same feelings of thankfulness and pleasure which I always experience on hearing from you; and tho&#x2019; getting very misty by this long <foreign>sederunt</foreign> [sitting], I design to fill this sheet for you before I give up. You do well to persevere in Cobbett: perseverance is a cardinal virtue&#x2014;the support of every other, and the habit of it cannot be acquired except by making a point of exercising the quality as yet new to us, upon <hi rend="italic">every</hi> honest undertaking we engage with. A man without perseverance&#x2014;tho&#x2019; bright as the sun&#x2014;is useless as a Jack o&#x2019; <pb id="pg-02-8" n="02:8"/>Lanthorn. The small worm on the coasts of the Mediterranean perforates a rock of flint by continued application; your fiery tiger would crunch his teeth to pieces on it instantly, and go off howling, without even breaking the surface. For the sake of perseverance, therefore, persevere; and still more for the sake of what your perseverance is directed to. Grammar in writing is like fingers and arms in a manual trade; many who have them work indifferently, none who has them not can work at all. It makes me very glad to see what proficiency you are making daily. If once this grammar were mastered, you would write with a fluency and ease before unknown. I predict that this will surely happen; and that your letters will be among the most manly and spirited I read. Frank and independant like a true man&#x2019;s, sarcastic and humorous and rational&#x2014;all this is before you if you like. As to the exercises,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In his letter of <date when="1822-01-03">3 Jan.</date>, Alick had expressed disappointment with the exercises in Cobbett&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Grammar</hi> and had asked Carlyle to supply him with some of his own.</note> you must wait till next opportunity: in the mean time you cannot do better than for the sake of practice, to take up any book&#x2014;the Spectator say&#x2014;and strike into some sentence of it, and apply your rules for parsing it. Take even this scrawl of mine: try if you can say what part of speech <hi rend="italic">this</hi> word is, what part that; why they are so not otherwise; what they <hi rend="italic">agree</hi> with, <hi rend="italic">govern</hi> or are governed by. Consult Jack or me whenever you are in doubt. Your spelling approaches fast to perfection: I notice the word <hi rend="italic">ackward</hi>; it should be <hi rend="italic">awk</hi>ward: but there are scarcely any more such instances.</p>
<p>I have told my Father and Mother almost all that is worth telling and unknown to you in my situation here. I was at Kirkcaldy the week before last; and spent two days <foreign><hi rend="italic">jannering</hi></foreign> [talking idly] and eating dinners with the good people. Mr Martin <note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Rev. Dr. John Martin, minister of Kirkcaldy, &#x201C;a precise, innocent, didactic kind of man &#x2026; clear-minded, brotherly, well-intentioned &#x2026;&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi>, II, 39&#x2013;40). Carlyle had met the Martin family through Edward Irving while teaching in Kirkcaldy, and Irving afterward (in <date when="1823-00-00">1823</date>) married Martin&#x2019;s eldest daughter, Isabella. See also Mrs. Oliphant&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Life of Edward Irving</hi> (London, <date when="1862-00-00">1862</date>), pp. 34&#x2013;35.</note> the minister offered me the Editorship of a Dundee Newspaper&#x2014;&#xa3;100 a-year, and <hi rend="italic">a</hi> percentage on the profits;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In <date when="1822-00-00">1822</date> there were two newspapers being published in Dundee, the Liberal <hi rend="italic">Advertiser</hi>, and the Tory <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi>. The former, founded in <date when="1801-00-00">1801</date>, was printed, edited, and in part owned from <date when="1809-00-00">1809</date> to <date when="1825-00-00">1825</date> by Robert Stephen Rintoul (<date when="1787-00-00">1787</date>&#x2013;<date when="1858-00-00">1858</date>), who in <date when="1828-00-00">1828</date> would found the <hi rend="italic">Spectator</hi>. A most competent journalist, it would seem unlikely that his position as editor of the <hi rend="italic">Advertiser</hi> would have been offered to anyone else. The <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi>, on the other hand, founded by Thomas Colvill and believed to have been edited by him until his death in <date when="1819-00-00">1819</date>, went bankrupt in <date when="1823-00-00">1823</date>. That the paper may have been without an able editor in the interim suggests that it was the one to which Carlyle refers.</note> but my ambition to become a Knight of the Paragraph <pb id="pg-02-9" n="02:9"/>was very small, and I <foreign><hi rend="italic">had nae wull o&#x2019; t</hi> [no inclination toward it]</foreign>. The minister is a kind man, and true stuff to the core. After returning I set to a criticism on Faust,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18211229-JBW-TC-01">JBW to TC, <date when="1821-12-29">29 Dec. 1821</date></ref>.</note> which the Review people were wanting. They have now agreed to pass it till next number, and I go on more leisurely. I shall send it whenever it is printed; tho&#x2019; it will be very poor, being written on a subject which I have never expressed myself about before, and hence with no small difficulty. It will be far too good however, for the place it is going to. The dogs have paid me nothing yet&#x2014;nothing but smiles, and fair words, which being hollow are worse than none.</p>
<p>While I was busy with this, Irving&#x2019;s letter came; about their Tutorship&#x2014;for which see my Father and mother&#x2019;s letters. I accepted of it the same night; I mean the trial of it. He would get my answer to-day. I have some hopes from the thing: but we can do either way. Irving is to be in Annan, I understand, very shortly. He seems to have raised the waters yonder; they like him as well as you and Ben Nelson do.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18210109-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1821-01-09">9 Jan. 1821</date></ref>.</note></p>
<p>My Father asked about Johnstone; but I have no tidings of him. I wrote &#x201C;as soon as I was settled&#x201D;&#x2014;under cover to D. Hope&#x2014;for I knew James&#x2019; address imperfectly, requesting an immed<supplied>[iate]</supplied> answer. None came: and whether Johnstone is out of the body or in the body I cannot at present tell. I suspect the latter, tho&#x2019; laziness makes it inconvenient for him to say so.</p>
<p>As to Waugh,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Waugh, his cousin.</note> <hi rend="italic">he</hi> is certainly <hi rend="italic">to the fore</hi>. Daily in the college-yard (which I visit about once a quarter) he is to be seen trailing his carcase along, heavy any way&#x2014;and now heavier by the addition of a tartan dreadnought, which at all hours, in every weather, sunshine as well as storm, he bears about with him. When I saw him last with it, he stooped very much and was so broad above, he looked like a walking pair of bellows, or a shoulder of mutton set out to travel on its shank-end. Poor Waugh! I pity him from the bottom of my heart. His money I fear is almost vanished again; and his medical diploma is not likely to be forthcoming. He has few vices, many virtues: but not a jot of prudence. I spent three hours in advising him to take one of the pupils from me&#x2014;the one between 11 and 12, whom I cannot get attended any longer for the pressure of writing &#x26;c: and even yet tho&#x2019; Waugh has no prospect but that of being pennyless, and no objection <pb id="pg-02-10" n="02:10"/>to the offer, he palters and will not move. He has much to suffer, poor fellow; before he can learn wisdom. But I must leave him and all things, for my paper is clean gone. <foreign>Adieu</foreign> My dear Brother!

<salute>My dear Jack,</salute>
<p>I have been writing very copious letters to Mainhill all this afternoon; and as I had no time to get one ready for you, my heart partly smites me now that I have come back from the Carrier&#x2019;s; and as at any rate I feel somewhat indisposed for dipping into the character and projects of <hi rend="italic">Faust</hi> to-night, I purpose to solace myself by holding a little chat with you before I go to bed. It is uncertain when you may see this: for I have nothing to communicate but what you will soon know fully by another channel; and therefore I am not going to take your ninepence half-penny out of its dry lodging in Wellington-street to put it into his Majesty&#x2019;s treasury, on this occasion; but to give this letter to the Jurist <note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Dalgliesh.</note> or some other trust-worthy person, and let it come cost-free tho&#x2019; more slowly.</p>
<p>I thank you very kindly for your letter. It is of the right open-hearted kind, written without reserve from the fulness of your own thoughts; and that is just the thing I want. Write to me often in the same style not waiting for carriers or the like, but using the convenience of the Post-Office without reserve. I always rejoice to see one of your letters, because I am sure of its coming from an honest soul that loves me. I am glad also to find by the epistle in question that you are so much in the way of improvement, and making such large advances in the acquisition of knowledge,&#x2014;of facts as well as of reflective habits, which are most valuable of all. Go on, my brave Jack! and fear no weather! We have both a sore fight to wage; but we shall conquer at the last. There are many men now lolling upon the pillow of inglorious <pb id="pg-02-11" n="02:11"/>sloth, and pitying such adventurers as we: but their <hi rend="italic">pity</hi> shall not always endure&#x2014;the lazy <foreign><hi rend="italic">haggises</hi></foreign>;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Haggis</hi>, a dish made of the lungs, heart, and liver of a sheep, minced with suet, onions, salt, and pepper and mixed with high-toasted oatmeal, all boiled in a sheep&#x2019;s stomach, is a famous national dish celebrated by Burns, Smollett, and others. <hi rend="italic">Haggis-headed</hi> denotes stupidity.</note> they must sink when we shall soar.</p>
<p>Now that you have finished Rollin,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charles Rollin (<date when="1661-00-00">1661</date>&#x2013;<date when="1741-00-00">1741</date>), <hi rend="italic">Histoire ancienne des &#xc9;gyptiens, des Carthaginois, des Assyriens, des Babyloniens, des M&#xE8;des, des Perses, des Mac&#xE9;doniens, et des Grecs</hi>, 6 vols. (Paris, <date when="1740-00-00">1740</date>).</note> I think you ought to begin some other book on general literature, directed if possible like it, in some degree to the progress of your classical studies. There is a Roman History by Hook,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Nathaniel Hooke. See <ref target="volume-02/lt-18230112-TC-JBW-01">TC to JBW, <date when="1823-01-12">12 Jan. 1823</date></ref>.</note> if I mistake not, in your catalogue. Concerning its merits I am not entitled to speak&#x2014;never having seen it: I suspect they will be small; but it will undoubtedly contain many details of advantage for you to be familiar with; therefore I partly advise you to get hold of it. Failing this, you might commence Smollett&#x2019;s Continuation of Hume,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Tobias George Smollett (<date when="1721-00-00">1721</date>&#x2013;<date when="1771-00-00">71</date>), <hi rend="italic">The History of England from the Revolution to &#x2026; <date when="1783-00-00">1783</date>. Designed as a continuation of Mr. Hume&#x2019;s history,</hi> by T. S. and others, 5 vols. (<date when="1760-00-00">1760</date>&#x2013;<date when="1765-00-00">65</date>).</note> or any continuation of him&#x2014;for a worse one can scarcely be imagined than Smollett&#x2019;s; and endeavour to make yourself acquainted with the outlines of recent English history. There are some &#x201C;histories of Scotland&#x201D; which relate to periods with which perhaps you would like to become acquainted. Laing <note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Malcolm Laing&#x2019;s work. See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18190714-TC-RM-01">TC to RM, <date when="1819-07-14">14 July 1819</date></ref>.</note> is a sensible, hard-hearted man: Pinkerton<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Pinkerton&#x2019;s work. See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18210424-TC-WG-01">TC to WG, <date when="1821-04-24">24 April 1821</date></ref>.</note> has the most hateful mind of any living author&#x2014;but his &#x201C;house of Stewart&#x201D; is worth looking into. The &#x201C;early history&#x201D; cannot be read, by any thinking creature; it is fit only for antiquarians. At all events, read something. A continual exercise of the memory and judgement alone wears out one&#x2019;s energies, and is unprofitable to the faculties in the long run. You will be abundantly able to hold up your head here in the Classes next winter, without overstraining yourself. So take it leisurely upon you. And count upon it, Jack, as a settled thing that you are to appear here. I expect to be able to set you above all fear, whether you get teaching or not,&#x2014;which however is very probable. They will tell you at home, about a projected Tutorship, which is yet uncertain, but which if I like it&#x2014;for the most lies there, will yield me a nett revenue of &#xa3;200 a-year. Where is the risk then my boy Jack? And if this all evaporate, I can still translate and compile and write and do rarely. I think my health <hi rend="italic">is</hi> improving; and I have often <pb id="pg-02-12" n="02:12"/>said, that I want nothing more. So be of good cheer, benighted Teanglegg! day will dawn upon thee, and a fine country lie disclosed at thy feet, before the year&#x2019;s end.</p>
<p>Parson Sloane<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >One of John&#x2019;s colleagues at Annan Academy.</note> must have very peculiar views on the nature of adverbs. &#x201C;Fence <hi rend="italic">in</hi> the tender shrubs&#x201D; is no mysterious phrase; and <hi rend="italic">in</hi>, if there be any logic upon Earth, is a preposition to all intents and purposes; in composition with &#x201C;fence&#x201D; to be sure, and not governing &#x201C;shrubs,&#x201D; but still a preposition if there ever was one. Does the hysterical pedagogue not know or understand the property of all Saxon languages, and of English among them, which permits the separation of a verb from the preposition in composition with it, and the inversion of their usual arrangement if necessary? Did he never read &#x201C;I have set-to my seal&#x201D;<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John 3:33.</note> in his Bible? Did he never say &#x201C;Put to the door&#x201D;? And is <hi rend="italic">to</hi> an adverb likewise? After all it is simply a question about terms; and makes no jot of difference, however it be decided. But one does not like to be bravadoed and cowed out of any thing.</p>
<p>You did well to mention James Irving&#x2019;s case to me. Call upon him the first opportunity, and say that I am ready to aver if needful that I never in the whole course of my natural life saw him reading Pittiscottie&#x2019;s History<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Lindsay of Pitscottie (<date when="1532-00-00">1532</date>?&#x2013;<date when="1578-00-00">78</date>?), <hi rend="italic">History of Scotland</hi> (<date when="1604-00-00">1604</date>).</note> or any other thing whatever, on his knees or off them, before the fire or behind it, above it or below it; and that I never said I so saw him to Peter Forrest<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Son of one of his landlords in Edinburgh.</note> or any son or daughter of Adam. This I can assert whenever James Irving&#x2019;s interest requires me to assert it.</p>
<p>Your little Typographus has acted very foolishly and impudently in using my name in the matter: it were acting with strict justice but too great severity towards him, to leave the business here, and let him pass for a liar, when he merits only to be counted a babbler. The truth is he was pestering me about books to print and so forth one day: Pittiscottie was mentioned among others; and the question, where it could be had, being started, I said it must be in the neighbourhood for I had <hi rend="italic">heard</hi> that James Irving had read it. &#x201C;Does <hi rend="italic">he</hi> read?&#x201D; said my man of types. I replied that he did certainly, and I <hi rend="italic">believed</hi> (for I had <hi rend="italic">heard</hi> this too, and know from whom I heard both statements) when other conveniences failed he would sit by the fire and read even on his knees, when the embers began to glimmer feebly. So diligent was he.&#x2014; Tell this to Irving whenever you see him: and say <pb id="pg-02-13" n="02:13"/>I am sorry that I should have been instrumental however remotely and innocently, in bringing him into the smallest uneasiness.&#x2014; As to Forrest I have no spleen against him,&#x2014;except that he has acted very thoughtlessly and very absurdly, tho&#x2019; I do believe not malevolently. He has also taken up too much of my poor Jack&#x2019;s letter with his pranks and their consequences. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Laissons-le</hi></foreign> [Let us leave him alone].</p>
<p>Now thou must write again boy in a few days and tell me all that is in thy liver, both <hi rend="italic">pro</hi> and <hi rend="italic">contra</hi>. How does Ben do? Make my best respects to him. I intend writing: but alas! How busy am <hi rend="italic">not</hi> I? As Potty<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >An Annandale word for a peddler of pottery.</note> said&#x2014;that is Potty of Lauder, who is a good man notwithstanding</p>
<p>I have written in a strange humour to-night Jack: melancholikish, illnaturedish, affectionatish&#x2014;all in <hi rend="italic">ish</hi>&#x2014;for I am very weak and weary, having slept little last night, and sat too much. I am for bed now. Good night, My Jack! I love thee as well as I can, which is pretty well considering all things.</p>
<p>If I can rise in time to-morrow morning (which is far from likely) I intend giving this to Dr Johnston,<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably Dr. David Johnston, an Annandale neighbor.</note> who has been here witnessing about Armstrong of Glingan&#x2019;s trial.<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Armstrong, a farmer, shot William Farries, an intruder, on the night of <date when="1821-11-21">21 Nov. 1821</date>. He received only one month&#x2019;s imprisonment though found guilty of culpable homicide.</note> Armstrong is to be quit for a month&#x2019;s imprisonment, as you will hear. Johnstone did not give his evidence in full; for they saw, he said to me last night in Waugh&#x2019;s room, they saw he was going to &#x2019;<foreign><hi rend="italic">waken</hi></foreign> on them [burst out in anger]&#x2014;and so prudently let him travel.</p>
<p>I like my room well&#x2014;the air is good, the landlady is good, and there is <hi rend="italic">peace</hi>. Alas! for my poor <hi rend="italic">Book</hi>. But it <hi rend="italic">shall</hi> appear yet. When shall I begin? Good night again!</p>
<p><closer><salute>Thy affectionate brother, /</salute></closer> <name>Tho<hi rend="italic">s</hi> Carlyle&#x2014;.</name></p>

<salute>My dear Friend,</salute>
<p>I finished Faust<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18211229-JBW-TC-01">JBW to TC, <date when="1821-12-29">29 Dec. 1821</date></ref>.</note> on Saturday; and have not yet had courage to read it over. Nothing but the pleasure, which I am now anticipating, and for which it furnishes a kind of pretext, could have induced me to submit so very insufficient a performance to your perusual. I declare I cannot without indignation behold the paltry rag, and think that it has consumed two whole weeks of incessant labour. It is so ambitious, so bombastic, so <foreign>jejune</foreign>. Do not look at it, till you feel in very good humour with me, and then banish it from your memory altogether.</p>
<p>I suppose you think I have been very idle since you left me. But no, I promise you! I was not born to be any thing but miserable in idleness; and by the blessing of Heaven; I shall never be idle more. If I fail to effect any thing in my day and generation, any thing to justify Providence for having called me into his Universe,&#x2014;the weakness of my ability not of my will shall be to blame. I have much to strive with, much to do: the few conceptions that actually exist within me are scattered in a thousand directions&#x2014;diffracted, dismembered, without form and void: and I have yet gained no right mastery of my pen, no right familiarity with the public to express them&#x2014;even if worth expressing&#x2014;to advantage. Nevertheless I must persevere. What motive have I <hi rend="italic">not</hi>, which man can have? The brightest hopes and the darkest fears&#x2014;on the one side are obscurity and isolation, the want of all that can render life endurable, and &#x201C;Death sad refuge from the storms of Fate&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Gray, &#x201C;Progress of Poesy,&#x201D; II, 1.</note>&#x2014;without even an approving conscience to disarm it of its sting; on the other is&#x2014;!&#x2014; I tell you, my friend, to be in no pain for me. Either I shall escape from this &#x201C;obscure sojourn&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi>, III, 15.</note>&#x2014;or perish, as I ought, in trying it. The game is deep; but I must play it out: I can no other; so away with fear! <foreign><hi rend="italic">Nil desperandum, te duce et auspice te!</hi></foreign><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;There is nothing to despair of under my leadership and auspices!&#x201D; Adapted from Horace, <hi rend="italic">Odes</hi>, I, vii, 27.</note></p>
<p><pb id="pg-02-15" n="02:15"/>Meanwhile I am not unhappy. It is true I have none to love me here, none that I can love, no companion even whose head or heart can make me do aught but regret every hour I spend in such society; and accordingly I spend very few in it. But I have long been studying the painful lesson to live <hi rend="italic">alone</hi>: and the task is easier as I am than it ever was. I enjoy quiet, and free air, and returning health; I have business in abundance for the present; and the future lies before me vaguely&#x2014;but with some glimpses of a solemn beauty irradiating all its gloom. When I compare the aspect of the world to me now with what it was twelve months ago, I am far from desponding or complaining. I seem to have a motive and a rallying-word in the fight of life: when the battle is waxing fierce without, and the heart is waxing faint within, I shall remember it and do bravely, <foreign><hi rend="italic">Alles f&#xfc;r Ruhm und Ihr!</hi></foreign><note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;All for glory and her!&#x201D; (Schiller, <hi rend="italic">Die Geschichte des dreissigj&#xE4;hrigen Krieges</hi>, ed. Benno von Wiese [Leipsig, n.d.], II, 130). See <ref target="volume-02/lt-18220130-TC-JBW-01">TC to JBW, <date when="1822-01-30">30 Jan. 1822</date></ref>. Carlyle underscores <hi rend="italic">Ihr</hi> twice.</note></p>
<p>You see how I talk about my own most precious self! It is a copious subject and a <hi rend="italic">safe</hi> one: I have not done with it yet. Present my affectionate and grateful rememberances to your excellent Mother; and say I have not in any wise forgotten her most kind invitation. I mean to profit by it sooner than she anticipates. If I had only finished some miserable compilations for their Encyclopedia, I am master of my own time, and then&#x2014;!&#x2014; In two weeks, I am with you; <hi rend="italic">unless</hi> you declare I absolutely must not. I beg you will not speak of that unfortunate Book. Alas, my dear friend! if <hi rend="italic">one</hi> page of it were written, nine tenths of the difficulty would be over. It shall be forthcoming: have I not said it?</p>
<p>If you refuse me, it will be very hard. Irving is speaking about a kind of Tutorship in some great family:<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-02/lt-18220112-TC-JCE-01">TC to <sic>JC</sic><corr>JCE</corr>, <date when="1822-01-12">12 Jan.</date></ref></note> and if I accept it, my excursions must be greatly circumscribed. The people offer &#xa3;250 a-year, the chance of travelling, a number of hours per day to myself, and many other advantages, which ought perhaps to induce me. Let me see you before I decide: it may not be so easy afterwards: I have a million of things to say and to ask. I will come some Wednesday evening, and go back on Sunday. You <hi rend="italic">will</hi> not say me nay.</p>

<p>I have read the Tragedies&#x2014;I thank you for them&#x2014; They are Byron&#x2019;s. Need <hi rend="italic">I</hi> praise them. I have also read your eloquent history of Faust&#x2014; For it too I thank you. It has fewer faults and greater merits than its Author led me to expect&#x2014; I have moreover read your letter&#x2014; For <hi rend="italic">it</hi> I do <hi rend="italic">not</hi> thank you&#x2014; It afforded me neither pleasure nor amusement&#x2014; Indeed, my Friend this letter of yours has, to my mind, more than one fault&#x2014; I do not allude to its being egotistical&#x2014; To speak of one&#x2019;s self is, they say, a privilege of Friendship, and I have seen too much of M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle to expect that Friendship should have <hi rend="italic">any</hi> privileges of which he would <hi rend="italic">not</hi> avail himself. But there is about it an air of levity which I dislike. Which seems to me to form an unnatural union with the other qualities of your head and heart, and to be illtimed in treating of a subject, to you the most important of all subjects&#x2014;your own <hi rend="italic">destiny</hi>. In a Statesman venturing the hopes of his ambition on one decisive stroke&#x2014; In a Soldier rushing to the Battle to conquer or to die, I might admire the spirit of gay daring with which you seem to have been animated; But in a man sitting quietly in his chamber contemplating years of labour, unattended with any danger (For I do not see that it is incumbent on you to &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">perish</hi>&#x201D; because you fail in writing a good Novel, good Tragedy, or good any thing else) years of labour the result of which may be neither certain good, nor certain evil, it seems to me, such a <hi rend="italic">spirit</hi> is unnatural and ridiculous&#x2014; Besides this there is about your letter a <hi rend="italic">mystery</hi> which I detest&#x2014; It is <pb id="pg-02-20" n="02:20"/>so full of <hi rend="italic">meaning</hi> words underlined&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">meaning</hi> sentences half finished, <hi rend="italic">meaning blanks</hi> [<hi rend="italic">blanks</hi> underscored twice] with notes of admiration&#x2014;and <hi rend="italic">meaning</hi> quotations from foreign languages that really in this abundance of <hi rend="italic">meaning</hi> it seems to indicate I am somewhat at a loss to discover what you would be at. I know how you will excuse yourself on this score&#x2014;you will say that you knew my Mother would see your letter, and that, of course you cared not to what difficulties I, as Interpreter, might be subjected, so that you got your <hi rend="italic">feelings towards me</hi> expressed. Now Sir, once for all, I beg you to understand that I <hi rend="italic">dislike</hi> as much as my Mother <hi rend="italic">disapproves</hi> your somewhat too ardent expressions of Friendship towards me; and that if you cannot write to me as to a Man who feels a deep interest in your welfare&#x2014;who admires your talents&#x2014;respects your virtues, and for the sake of these has often&#x2014;perhaps too often&#x2014;overlooked your faults&#x2014; If you cannot write to me as if&#x2014;as if you were married you need never waste ink or paper on me more.</p>
<p>&#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Alles f&#xfc;r Ruhm und Ihr</hi></foreign>&#x201D; [&#x201C;All for glory and her&#x201D; ]!!&#x2014; On my word, most gay and gallantly said&#x2014; One would almost believe the man fancies I have fallen in love with him, and entertain the splendid project of rewarding his literary labours with myself. Really Sir I do not design for you a recompense so worthless. If you render yourself an honoured member of societ<supplied>[y]</supplied> (and it seems to me that the pursuit of literary fame is, from the talents you possess, an easy&#x2014;and, from the manner of life you have adopted, an <hi rend="italic">only</hi> way of raising yourself from obscurity into the estimation of the wise and good) I will be to you a true, a constant, a devoted <hi rend="italic">friend</hi>&#x2014;but not a Mistress&#x2014;a Sister&#x2014;but not a Wife&#x2014; <hi rend="italic">Falling in love</hi> and marrying like other Misses is quite out of the question&#x2014; I have too <hi rend="italic">little</hi> romance in my disposition ever to be in love with you or any other man; and too <hi rend="italic">much</hi> ever to marry without love&#x2014; Were I a man I would not wait till <hi rend="italic">others</hi> find your <hi rend="italic">worth</hi> to say, in the face of the whole world, I admire this man and choose him for my friend&#x2014; But I am a woman M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle&#x2014;and what is worse a young woman&#x2014; Weakness, timidity and bondage are in the word&#x2014; But enough of this&#x2014;why do you force me into such horrid explanations?</p>
<p>You pass very hurriedly from the most important topic in your letter, judging from the little you say of this Tutorship, I think your friends if they had set about making a situation for you, could not have contrived one more desirable&#x2014; &#x201C;If you accept it?&#x201D;&#x2014; I have no right to interfere in your private arrangements&#x2014;but surely this &#x2018;If&#x2019; is a very ungrateful word!&#x2014;</p>
<p><pb id="pg-02-21" n="02:21"/>You propose coming here&#x2014; As I do not presume to forbid this house to any one whom my &#x2018;excellent Mother&#x2019; invites, the matter, I grieve to say, rests with yourself. As you neither study <hi rend="italic">my</hi> inclinations, nor consider <hi rend="italic">my</hi> comfort, it is in vain to say how much I am averse to your intended visit, and to how many impertinent conjectures it will, at present, subject me, in this tattling, illnatured place&#x2014; I leave it then to yourself to accomplish it, or not, as you please&#x2014;with this warning that if you come, you will repent it. I expected that the tasks I assigned you in my last would have stood me instead of Penelope&#x2019;s Web<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-02/lt-18220427-JBW-TC-01">JBW to TC, <date when="1822-04-27">27 April</date></ref>.</note> for a while&#x2014; But I was a fool to expect peace&#x2014; Patient sufferance I begin to find, is the first lesson to be learned by <hi rend="italic">one</hi> of the parties in a Romantic Friendship. My Mother knows nothing of your projected visit. She did not see your letter. We were in bad humour with each other when it came, and as, in spite of your <hi rend="italic">precautions,</hi> and the handsome adjective with which you ushered in your intention of visiting her it seemed to me nowise calculated to improve her temper, I seized the opportunity which a fit of Pet afforded me of laying it aside without showing it&#x2014; If she <hi rend="italic">had seen</hi> it I am pretty sure her friendship for <hi rend="italic">you</hi> would have formed but a brief episode in the history of her affections. If you are so unlucky as to determine on coming, it will be necessary for you to write ag<supplied>[a]</supplied>in and mention your intention as for the first time&#x2014; (To what pitiful evasions do you reduce me!) As I do not take the Pet every night no future letter of yours may escape like your last<supplied>[;]</supplied> I beg therefore that you will make no <hi rend="italic">particular</hi> allusion to any part of this letter; for tho&#x2019; my Mother knows that I am writing to you she must not see it&#x2014; I trust however that your <hi rend="italic">Good Genius</hi> will lead you to make <hi rend="italic">one</hi> effort of self denial. In that case I shall be glad to hear from you some weeks hence. Earth Air and Sea surely afford subjects enough for a letter to spare you the necessity of confining your ideas to yourself and me. If you think me more <hi rend="italic">prudent</hi> or rather more <hi rend="italic">rational</hi> than formerly resolve the difficulty thus. <hi rend="italic">Now</hi> I am <hi rend="italic">using</hi> the language of my <hi rend="italic">own</hi> heart <hi rend="italic">Then</hi> I was <hi rend="italic">learning</hi> that of <hi rend="italic">yours</hi> Here I am Jane Welsh&#x2014; In Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> I was M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Pupil</hi> [underscored twice]&#x2014;<closer><salute>Your sincere Friend&#x2014;</salute></closer> <name>J.

<p><salute>Dear little Jane&#x2014;</salute>Thou never wrotest me any kind of letter, yet I would be glad to see one from thy hand. There is in that little body of thine as much wisdom as ever inhabited so small a space; besides thou art a true character, steel to the back, never told a lie, never flinched from telling truth; and for all these things I love thee, my little Jane, and wish thee many blithe new years from the bottom of my heart.</p>
<p>Does the little creature ever make any rhymes now? Can she write any? Is she at any school? Has she read the book we sent her? Tell me all this&#x2014;if thou hast power even to form strokes, that is, to go through the first elements of writing. I am living here in a great monster of a place, with towers and steeples, and grand houses all in rows, and coaches and cars and men and women by thousands, all very grand; but I never forget the good people at Mainhill&#x2014;nor thee, among the least in stature though not the least in worth. Write then if thou canst. <closer><salute>I am very tired, but always thy affectionate Brother,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I surely meant to write you; but the hour is come, and I absolutely have not one moment of time. I entreat you to excuse me&#x2014;</p>
<p>I will certainly reply to your letter: I am gratified by itself, and by the news which it brings. I am thankful that you enjoy some measure of health&#x2014; O! be careful of it. I am getting better gradually I think. The air is very good here; I have a good room, and an excellent landlady.</p>

<salute>My dear Jack,</salute>
<p>The Carrier came in today, and found me in such a bustle, that tho&#x2019; I scrawled off a letter for Home, and delivered it to him, I fear they will be able to make neither &#x201C;top tail nor root out of it&#x201D;:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A current Annandale phrase.</note> and I sit down, now more at ease, to give you some regular picture of affairs, in the faith that you will carry it up to Mainhill on Saturday, and so contrive to eke out some tolerable conception of my &#x201C;Whereabout and How&#x201D; among you. I am going to charge you with postage; but we cannot help it; you must just submit.</p>
<p>In the first place of all, then, you will thank my Mother again and again for her kindness in sending materials out to me in the box, and good wishes in the letter. I will answer, as I may, in due season. Take up some tea and other such traffic with you&#x2014;for my sake as well as your own.&#x2014; In the second place, I would have you tell Polewarth<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Their brother Alexander. See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18210219-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1821-02-19">19 Feb. 1821</date></ref>.</note> that his epistle (which I have just read over a second time) is very smart, and contains <hi rend="italic">just</hi> two small errors: &#x201C;thankfu<hi rend="italic">l</hi>&#x2019; and &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">whither</hi>&#x201D; in place of &#x201C;wh<hi rend="italic">e</hi>ther.&#x201D; I can see that he has studied Cobbett to some purpose: I hope he will reap the full fruit of his diligence in time. The &#x201C;old watch&#x201D; I got duly, and find very serviceable: it goes well, tho&#x2019; somewhat nimbly. If there is any thing to pay Robie or others connected with it; some of you will stand good: the article is worth fifty of the old one, which indeed was worth very little&#x2014;if any thing.</p>
<p>In the third place (for I love to be methodical) say that I am continuing to enjoy moderate health, and I think to improve in that <pb id="pg-02-24" n="02:24"/>respect. It was worth many pounds to me&#x2014;if pain were valued by pounds&#x2014;that I left that devoted city, and planted myself here <foreign><hi rend="italic">sub Dio</hi></foreign> [in the open air], if I may speak so. The infernal vapours, the neverceasing crash of men and horses,&#x2014;and other machinery, even noisier tho&#x2019; inanimate&#x2014;would have demolished me at last, I am almost certain. In Moray-street, I am about as well off for air and quiet as you are, if not better. I get some good sleep almost every night&#x2014;after tossing and sprawling for a while. But lying awake is <hi rend="italic">mere nothing</hi> now to what it was, when I used to recline so <hi rend="italic">placidly</hi> beside you in <hi rend="italic">Bitty&#x2019;s</hi>.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Bitty Geel&#x201D; was John&#x2019;s landlady in Annan.</note> Those were brave nights, Jack! I shall never forget some such nights, if I were to live for a century or two. But the nerves are greatly recovered now; and the stomach itself, I care far less for. It will follow so good an example any way, I hope, in time.</p>
<p>You of course know all the outs and ins, up to a certain date, of this tutoring business. I shall try to explain the bearing of it, as it actually stands. I said something of it to Sandy, if memory does not mislead: but I had just eaten my dinner then, and was in a condition approximate to that of the seven sleepers: I was also hurried to an extreme degree; and so talked stupidity I suppose. &#x201C;I will now speak clear&#x201D;&#x2014;as Majocchi<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A Gaetano Majocchi edited Tasso, but Carlyle is probably referring here to Theodore Majocchi, who gave evidence against Queen Caroline at her trial (<date when="1820-00-00">1820</date>).</note> said. Here beginneth the second head of Method&#x2014;on Thursday&#x2014;The boys arrived about a week ago, and are to continue some six months at board in the house of one Dr Fleming,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. Thomas Fleming, D.D., minister of Lady Yester&#x2019;s Church in Edinburgh from <date when="1806-00-00">1806</date>&#x2013;<date when="1824-00-00">24</date>. He lived at 26 George Square.</note> a clergyman, till their parents arrive. I have entered upon duty, but in a desultory way, and expecting farther advice from London. I have offered to take the matter upon trial for a month or two at any rate; and then, if it answer, to commence business regularly, and with the regular salary&#x2014;&#xa3;200, and an allowance in the interim instead of board. Mr Buller, the father, wished some abatement in this period of uncertainty. I proffered leaving the payment at his own discretion, <hi rend="italic">for the two months</hi>; and having <hi rend="italic">no</hi> farther uncertainty at all. The &#x201C;Memorandum&#x201D; in which I stated this together with some other considerations necessary to be impressed upon the man, is now in his possession. It was written with as much emphasis as I could contrive to unite with respectfulness; Irving also has spoken magnificently of me:<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In EI to TC, <date when="1822-01-22">22 Jan.</date></note> so that if I enter the family at all, I need expect no supercilious or uncomfortable <pb id="pg-02-25" n="02:25"/>treatment there: and I still consider the office as lying at my own option, that is, depending on the character of the young men themselves and my suitableness to it. This latter point I have naturally been doing my utmost to determine during the last week: and tho&#x2019;, of course, I have not quite succeeded in <hi rend="italic">badomming</hi><note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably a play on the word <hi rend="italic">bottoming</hi>, probing to the bottom.</note> the fellows yet, I am rather inclined to hope they will <hi rend="italic">do</hi>. Both are of superior talents, and much classical instruction: they have few positively bad qualities that I can see, and considerable good nature. <hi rend="italic">Levity</hi> and inattention are the prevailing faults; and in the elder boy they will be rather difficult to surmount: however I have no fear that he or any one connected with him will ever get the length of <hi rend="italic">despising</hi> me, and I imagine that patient management on my part will bring about the desired result. A short time will try; and I will tell you regularly how it goes on. They take up all my day&#x2014;at least the better part of it&#x2014;at present; from ten o&#x2019;clock till about one, and from six to nearly eight. If I undertake finally, I shall need to make a fierce push at Greek. But a man will do much for such advantages.</p>
<p>Now, Jack, I have told you all that can be told about this thing. If it prosper, we may all be the better for it. You, certainly, need be under no apprehensions about your education&#x2014;there will be cash enough to fit you out royally. Indeed you need not fear tho&#x2019; it were again the nothing it was four weeks ago. You will almost for certain get teaching next winter: and if not&#x2014;I have a pen still, and a stout heart belonging to myself. So be of good cheer, my jolly boy; let not thy <hi rend="italic">winnow-cloth</hi> picture aught sinister in the future.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >One bit of folklore connected with winnowing is that by winnowing corn in secret on Halloween one can see an apparition of one&#x2019;s future husband entering the barn from windward and leaving it to leeward. Possibly there are other superstitions dealing with the winnow-cloth as an instrument of prophecy. Cf.

There is Pope and Dryden and all the moderns&#x2014;which people read independently of (see next page) their merits&#x2014;to talk about them.

There is much good to be got of (see next p.) reading such things&#x2014;they improve the style, and fill the imagination with fine objects and the heart sometimes with bold feelings. Read to amuse yourself as well as to learn; and be not diligent over much&#x2014; (This is all).</p></ps>

<dateline>[<date when="1822-01-30">30 January 1822</date>]</dateline>
<salute>My dear Friend,</salute>
<p>I have read your letter over and over; and admired the talent displayed in it not a little. It is very spirited and very satirical and altogether very clever. I have a small, exceeding small vein of satire myself: but there is no need to conjecture whether it would serve to defend me in the present instance: you know well enough I dare not try. It was once reckoned generous, I believe, to &#x201C;crush the haughty, but spare those who cannot resist&#x201D;:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not identified.</note> however I do not complain. This conflict of sarcasms can hardly gratify or punish any very noble feeling either in you or me; and I am content to have my vanity humbled, since you wish it so.</p>
<p>The tragical humour, into which men fall sometimes, is certainly a very unnatural and ridiculous thing; at least, if one is not born to be a statesman or a soldier,&#x2014;the only class of persons liable to die or suffer pain in this country: so we shall waive it for the present. I merely wish to say that when you read Schiller&#x2019;s History of the Thirty Years&#x2019; war, you will like Bernhard von Weimar<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Bernhard, Duke of Saxe-Weimar (<date when="1604-00-00">1604</date>&#x2013;<date when="1639-00-00">39</date>). Actually, in Schiller&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Thirty Years&#x2019; War,</hi> it was not Bernhard of Weimar, but Duke Christian of Braunschweig who was full of passion for the Countess of the Palatinate. Wearing her glove on his hat, he also displayed on his colors the motto &#x201C;<foreign>Alles f&#xfc;r Gott und Sie.</foreign>&#x201D;</note> as much as I do. On going forth to fight beside Gustavus the Lion of the North, <pb id="pg-02-27" n="02:27"/>Bernhard wrote this epigraph on his standard: <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;<foreign>Alles f&#xfc;r Ruhm und Ihr</foreign>.&#x201D;</hi> And who was <hi rend="italic">She</hi>? A great King&#x2019;s daughter, a brave King&#x2019;s wife: and all the poor <foreign><hi rend="italic">Ritter</hi></foreign> [knight] hoped for, was a smile from her fair countenance to greet his triumph, or a tear from her bright eyes to hallow his last and bloody bed. Perhaps it was all he wished.</p>
<p>Upon the whole, my friend, this mode of writing to you pleases me very ill.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Note that he ignores her request to refrain from references to her letter.</note> It also forms a most awkward prologue to the main purport of my present letter. In spite of the ridicule which you cast on me, or rather in part because of it, I am coming out to see you shortly. If you were to ask what I am wanting?&#x2014;I should scarce know what to say. One has few real friends on this Earth; and yet the feelings excited by those few are almost all that make it worth living on. I daresay I am very selfish; but still, if I thought this project of mine would incommode you much, I am not <hi rend="italic">so</hi> selfish as to persist in accomplishing it. The truth is, my visit must be brief at any rate, and may not soon be repeated; I know not the times and the seasons, but I do not often mean badly: therefore I have persuaded myself that you will not be angry at this proceeding, even tho&#x2019; it should prove ill-judged and unsuitable for many reasons. If you intend to meet me with frowns and cold ceremony; to-morrow is yet before us;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >He is writing on Wednesday.</note> tell me so&#x2014;and I will stay at home patiently. I have but from Friday-night till Monday morning at my own disposal. If you do not write I shall see you on Friday-night, or Saturday-Morning; if you do, I know not when I may have it in my power to see you again. Those boys are come from London,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charles and Arthur Buller.</note> and have kept me busy all this week; some permanent arrangement is to be made with them about the beginning of next&#x2014; I am not ungrateful I hope or insensible to my own interest; but there are many drawbacks which I will tell you of.&#x2014;</p>
<p>This is poor suing; I need not continue it. Excuse all my thousand faults: I know their number, and regret their magnitude as well as their number&#x2014; <foreign><hi rend="italic">Mais c&#x2019;est assez</hi></foreign> [But this is enough]!</p>
<p>Present my kindest respects to your Mother&#x2014;if you think it worth while; and believe me to be, with no feelings towards you but those of an honest man and a true-hearted friend, now and always,</p>
<p><closer><salute>Sincerely your&#x2019;s /</salute></closer> <name>Thomas Carlyle&#x2014;</name></p>

<salute>My dear Johnston,</salute>
<p>Your letter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1822-01-14">14 Jan.</date></note> is dated about three weeks ago, has been expected about two months, and came into my hands only this morning. As I do fully intend to answer it soon, and as there is odds that I shall not find myself soon in a better mood for answering it than at present, I have adopted the wise resolution of consecrating the passing hour to that duty&#x2014;obedient to the prudent saw, which assures us that Opportunity hairy in front is bald behind; <foreign><hi rend="italic">fronte capillata, post est occasio calva</hi></foreign>.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cato, <hi rend="italic">Disticha de Moribus</hi>, II, 26. See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18200301-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1820-03-01">1 March 1820</date></ref>.</note> I say duty; but I might have used a kindlier word. In fact there are few events in my history that yield a more placid enjoyment to my mind, than reading a letter from you or writing one for your perusal. In such cases the sober certainty of your many affectionate and faithful feelings towards me&#x2014;not altogether unrequited, I hope&#x2014;mingles itself with the happy recollection of many virtuous and cheerful hours that we have spent together long ago&#x2014;before either of us had tasted <hi rend="italic">how</hi> bitter a thing is worldly life; and how wofully our young purposes were to be marred by the low impediments of this confused, inane and noisy vortex into which both of us have been cast, and where we are still toiling and striving and jostling and being jostled, according to the sentence passed on Adam, and fulfilled on all his poor descendants. The moonshine nights during which we have strolled along the <foreign><hi rend="italic">loanings</hi></foreign> [lanes] of our native Annandale, the sunny days we have spent in basking on our own <foreign><hi rend="italic">braes</hi></foreign> [hillsides],&#x2014;talking so copiously and heartily of all things that we knew or did not know; those nights and days are &#x201C;with the days beyond the Flood,&#x201D; we shall not see them more; but the memory of them is still bright in the soul, and will make us recollect each other with pleasure even to the end. It is a rare fortune that gives to the man the friends of the boy, unsullied by unworthy actions, and still maintaining some similarity of tastes: it is a happiness, however, which has been ours, and I trust, will continue so always. Nor do I in the smallest abandon the hope that future days will be calmer than those that have passed and are passing over us.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Samuel Johnson, <hi rend="italic">English Dictionary</hi>, Preface, third paragraph from the end.</note> Depend upon it, my good friend, there is a time coming, <pb id="pg-02-29" n="02:29"/>when tho&#x2019; we may not be great men, we shall be placid ones; when, having mended by much toil what is capable of mending in our condition, and resigned ourselves to endure with much patience what in it is incapable of mending, we shall meet together like toilworn way-farers descending the mountain cheerily and smoothly which they climbed with danger and distress. &#x201C;We will laugh and sing and tell old tales&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">King Lear</hi>, V, iii.</note> and forget that our lot has been hard, when we think that our hearts have been firm, and our conduct true and honest to the last. This should console us whatever weather it is with us: the task is brief; and great is the reward of doing it well.</p>
<p>But this is not a homily: so I take leave of preaching&#x2014;for which indeed I have no talent. You sadden me by the scanty outline which you draw of your actual situation. A state of health &#x201C;but indifferent&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Johnston wrote, <date when="1822-01-14">14 Jan.</date>: &#x201C;My health has been but indifferent owing I suppose to bad weather and confinement.&#x201D;</note> is signified in one short sentence; yet comprises within it a catalogue of vexatious discomforts which might furnish matter for many volumes. I entreat you in the name of common sense to suspend <hi rend="italic">every</hi> pursuit, that interferes with your attention to this first of all concerns. Out! I say, from your confined dwelling-place! Away to the banks of Clyde, to the Green, to the Country, to free air! What is all the Greek in the Universe to this? There is more happiness, nay more philosophy, in a sound nervous system, than in all the systems described by Brucker or Buhle,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Johann Jakob Brucker (<date when="1696-00-00">1696</date>&#x2013;<date when="1770-00-00">1770</date>) and Johann Gottlieb Buhle (<date when="1763-00-00">1763</date>&#x2013;<date when="1821-00-00">1821</date>), German philosophers.</note> or conceived by any mortal from Thales down to Mr Owen of Lanark. <note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Owen (<date when="1771-00-00">1771</date>&#x2013;<date when="1858-00-00">1858</date>), founder of the model town of New Lanark.

I would give all the world sometimes, to have no nerves.</p>
<p>These Irish schemes are not likely to be of service, I fear.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Johnston&#x2019;s letter mentions various offers of teaching positions which he had received, including one in Ireland, and various schemes which he was entertaining for the future, including going to &#x201C;New Holland&#x201D; (Australia).</note> You did right to reject at once and totally the &#x201C; potatoe-plot and cabin&#x201D; as well <supplied>[as]</supplied> the &#x201C;thirty-pounds&#x201D; tutorship: and if I were in your place, I would be well assured that the Newton Barry School<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In Newtownbarry, County Wexford.</note> was certain of yielding some thing considerably beyond sixty or seventy pounds <pb id="pg-02-30" n="02:30"/>annually, before I thought of encountering the <hi rend="italic">tristia</hi> of <hi rend="italic">the Sod</hi><note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Very probably a reference to Ovid&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Tristia</hi> written in exile.</note> or the vulgar annoyances of those who tread upon it. Still the place seems worth enquiring after; and I hope you <hi rend="italic">will</hi> yet hear more of it. But you must absolutely never say another word about New Holland whatever befalls. This I insist upon. Take my word for it, Sir, you are no<supplied>[t ma]</supplied>de for emigration. The colonists may say that Botany Bay is this and that and the other: <foreign><hi rend="italic">n&#x2019;en croyez rien</hi></foreign> [don&#x2019;t believe a word of it]. The society will please you infinitely less in the land of convicts and kangaroos than it did in Canada or Nova Scotia; and the emoluments of any thing in which you could be serviceable, must be, what they are in all new countries, of a kind quite inadequate to procure you satisfaction of even a tolerable degree<supplied>[.]</supplied> Can you be content with a life in which the stomach shall be filled never so royally, while the head and the heart are both left wa<supplied>[ste]</supplied> and empty? Can you submit to be judged by an ermined sheep-stealer? Can you associate with the half-reformed sweepings of creation, with emeritusfelons, with broken agriculturists, ruined projectors and persons having the bones and sinews of men but nothing more? This is an over-charged picture, I know; but much of it <hi rend="italic">must</hi> be true: and other pictures look more flattering, chiefly because they embrace the exception, instead of the rule. Consider this, and lay asid<supplied>[e]</supplied> your project <hi rend="italic">forever</hi>. Stay at home where your merits&#x2014;slow in making themselves known anywhere&#x2014;are at last appreciated by many who respect you and are anxious to patronise you for the sake of them. You can teach well and honestly; your present employments will render you fitter for the task than ever you were; and situations are often casting up which may be gained by honest methods, and made the means of a respectable and permanent establishment <hi rend="italic">at home</hi>. I had rather go and set up teaching anywhere in Britain, with no introduction but my staff and scrip, than go to <hi rend="italic">Australasia</hi> with all the recommendations that could be given me. Be patient and diligent, and you you [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] <hi rend="italic">must</hi> ultimately succeed. In the mean time, if nothing better occur, I think you should return to Bogside in Spring for the sake of your health, if it do not completely recover.

<salute>My dear Father,</salute>
<p>I have just received your letter from the hands of Garthwaite, and delivered the box to him. He is going away about five o&#x2019;clock and it is already near four; so I have very little time to write in, and you will therefore excuse the confusion and meagreness of which it is probable my letter will exhibit too many proofs. At any rate, I wrote Jack by the Post last week, and on that occasion gave him a full detail; and I suppose you have perused it before now.</p>
<p>I am very glad to learn that you are going on still &#x201C;in the old way&#x201D;&#x2014;which if not the best possible way, certainly deserves to be reckoned a very fair one, in such times as the present. Even the trifling reduction of 12 per cent will be of some service;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Carlyle in his letter to Thomas of <date when="1823-01-05">5 Jan.</date> had said that there was a rumor that his landlord, Matthew Sharpe, might reduce the rent by 20 per cent.</note> and I entertain no doubt that something permanently beneficial to the farming interest must be effected soon by the Legislature<supplied>[;]</supplied> the state of the Country imperiously requires it. You have not surely any reason to fear for your own part: so long as you and my Mother and the rest are blessed with moderate health, there is every reason to be thankful, for the actual state of things, and to hope that the future state of them will have improved.</p>
<p>I feel very sorry to learn that Bogside,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Home of the family of James and George Johnston. JC had written: &#x201C;The only thing that is talked about &#x2026; is final reduction of the Duke of Queensburrey Tacks &#x2026; and Bogside &#x2026; who for a long time hath fed on Green pastures and besid<supplied>[e]</supplied> the Still waters must now look about themselves like other men.&#x201D; He adds, &#x201C;They will get there farmes again, If they will give as much rent as any other men will give.&#x201D;</note> so long used to health and quiet, has been visited at length with such severe sickness. I trust it will only be for a short time: he is a worthy person in his way; and I have often experienced his kindness. Johnston wrote to me for the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> time, the day before yesterday!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Johnston&#x2019;s letter is actually dated <date when="1822-01-14">14 Jan.</date> but had not been delivered to Carlyle until <date when="1822-02-04">4 Feb.</date></note> He has been rather sickly, and exceedingly busied. His Irish affair is too likely to evaporate; and he naturally looks into the coming years with no small anxiety. I feel <pb id="pg-02-32" n="02:32"/>much for James: he is an honest kind soul, as lives by bread; and his fluctuating fortunes are to be imputed less to imprudence or faults on his part, than to the original circumstances in which he grew up, and to the undue neglect he has experienced from those who hold the patronages of this world in their hands. He is irresolute, because he is at once sharp-tempered and affectionate; impatient and indolent; vexed with present evil and not careful of future good. His mind is not great or strong, but it is true as gold.&#x2014; I wrote him encouragingly yesterday.</p>
<p>Another still more unfortunate and far less amiable character than Johnston, I mean the celebrated Waugh<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Waugh, the unfortunate medical student.</note> comes in contact with me, here, now and then. Waugh navigates the stream of life, as an immense Dutch Lugger would drift along a rocky shoaly sea&#x2014;at the rate of one mile per hour&#x2014;the sails and rigging being gone, the compass and chart overboard, the captain however still standing by the helm, and by his ignorance and blindness making matters only worse, than if he were asleep continually. I know not what is to become of him. One day I pity his case very deeply; and the next some gross imprudence converts my pity into irritation. He has no money I doubt, and little rational prospect of getting any. I offered him some teaching, which he was very glad of when I spoke about it first, which he declined when I saw him a second time, wished to consider farther of when I saw him a third time, and finally rejected when I saw him a fourth time. He will most likely find some shark ready to seize upon his property for about the fifth part of its value in ready cash&#x2014;which he at present longs to do; then spend this hundred pounds in half a year; and afterwards become&#x2014;I wot not what.</p>
<p>But I have dwelt too long on those points: I must turn to myself. Those boys from London I am still attending daily&#x2014;from ten o&#x2019;clock to one, and then from six to eight. They improve upon me. The eldest I have talked a good deal with, and brought at last&#x2014;I hope permanently, but cannot affirm&#x2014;to a more rational style of feeling. He is no bad-hearted fellow: and I am inclined to think will do pretty well in the end. But we have yet heard no word from the Father, tho&#x2019; we expected some two days ago; and no durable arrangement can yet be thought of. I like the business for many reasons, and dislike it chiefly because it will cut up my time so enormously for a while. I designed to set about writing some Book shortly; and this (at which I must ultimately arrive, if I ever arrive at any thing) will of necessity require <pb id="pg-02-33" n="02:33"/>to be postponed greatly. On the whole, however, I am in no bad spirits about myself at present. My health is incomparably better than it was a year ago: by the aid of some simple drugs I keep things in a kind of passable state, which tho&#x2019; far from a right one, is a state calculated to yield me no small consolation, when I compare it with that which preceded. The air I live in too being very good, I expect to go on improving. I am still much pleased with my lodgings. So that every thing, if not exactly as it should be, is at least far better than it might be.</p>
<p>I firmly purposed to write my dear and kind Mother a long letter this opportunity: but five o&#x2019;clock is already struck; and I must again defer it. Assure her of my continued love&#x2014;of which indeed she requires no assurance; remember me in brotherly affection to Alick and Jack (from whom I had a letter which went round by Glasgow, and came with Johnston&#x2019;s) to Mag and Jamie, Mary Jane &#x26; Jenny; not doubting that <closer><salute>I remain,</salute></closer></p>
<closer><salute>My dear Father, / Your dutiful son, /</salute></closer>
<name>Thomas Carlyle&#x2014;</name>
<ps><p>I read Rob<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Carlyle&#x2019;s letter; but unless you are much better informed about the name of Carlyle than I, the London Gentleman is likely to receive very little insight from us into that ancient patronymic. A large bell was dug up at Dumfries not long ago, of which I suppose he has heard. There is also some notice of Carlyle in Murray&#x2019;s genealogy of Bruce:<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly Alexander Murray (<date when="1775-00-00">1775</date>&#x2013;<date when="1813-00-00">1813</date>), <hi rend="italic">Account of the Life and Writings of James Bruce</hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1808-00-00">1808</date>). Robert Carlyle has not been identified. See Carlyle&#x2019;s somewhat scornful treatment of genealogy in <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi>.</note> but I am afraid it is a bad concern this &#x201C;history.&#x201D;</p>
<p>That great-coat will not suit Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> any longer. Jack may have it if he like&#x2014;if not, any one.&#x2014; I am done&#x2014;for it is quite night.</p></ps>

<salute>My dear Fergusson,</salute>
<p>Your letter reached me some time ago; and the intelligence it brought afforded no small satisfaction. I rejoiced to learn that after all your inquietudes and wanderings, you had at last found some kind of resting-place&#x2014;a substantial occupation capable of employing your faculties and yielding you those accommodations and comforts, which steady exertion and honest principles should always secure for a man <pb id="pg-02-34" n="02:34"/>in the world, but which one has often such struggling and toiling before one can arrive at. Your new establishment looks well in many respects: I hope to hear that you are prospering in it more and more daily, getting scholar upon scholar, friend upon friend, till finally you obtain a permanent habitation, a good wife to rule it, and so become in all points a settled denizen of this Earth.</p>
<p>I would have written sooner, but I wished to have some intelligence to send you, worthy of crossing the two Friths; and I found none. Apparently I might have waited till the end of time, had I persisted in this resolution: by good fortune (for myself at least) I have changed it; and tho&#x2019; devoid of interesting matter, and dull as a bat in <date when="1822-12-00">December</date>, I am scribbling without any hinderance from those obstacles. There is nothing new under the Sun, Solomon said:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Eccles. 1:9.</note> and in fact one gets partly to believe Solomon at last. The outward forms of occurences are infinite in variety, there substantial qualities are few and uniform. Event succeeds event, as heir to heir; but no living man except the editors of Newspapers can command sufficient gaiety of heart to record their changes. I see scarcely any one here, but some few stragglers of the <foreign><hi rend="italic">servum pecus</hi></foreign> [slavish herd],<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Horace, <hi rend="italic">Epistles</hi>, I, xix, 19.</note> briefly and far between; so I know not how the world is wagging<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">As You Like It</hi>, II, v.</note> more than if I dwelt in the ring of Saturn. Only I hear at times some persons jangling about the &#x201C;Agricultural distresses&#x201D; and Joseph Hume,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><corr>Joseph Hume</corr> (<date when="1777-00-00">1777</date>&#x2013;<date when="1855-00-00">1855</date><corr>; <ref target="volume-02/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/14148"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref></corr>), Scottish surgeon and politician, who served the East India Company in early life and after <date when="1811-00-00">1811</date> was extremely active in the House of Commons. In <date when="1822-00-00">1822</date> he opposed Vansittart&#x2019;s scheme for the reduction of the pension charge.</note> much as they are jangling everywhere on those topics, and here and there a man of <hi rend="italic">sure</hi> information giving notice that M&#x2019;Culloch<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Ramsay McCulloch. See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18210110-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1821-01-10">10 Jan. 1821</date></ref>, and <ref target="volume-02/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/17413"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>.</note> has resigned his connection with the Scotsman, and is getting well or ill forward with his lectures on Political Economy&#x2014;delivered to a select audience of ten; that the last Scotch Novel is worse than the first; that Lord Byrons tragedies are very comical; that the late Edinburgh Review is getting even duller than the former; and that in fact mankind seem hastening to a final consummation of stupidity&#x2014;from which great quiet and contentedness of mind may fairly be expected to arise, both to individuals and the public at large.</p>
<p>From the contemplation of things in general, to that of things in <pb id="pg-02-35" n="02:35"/>particular, the transition is easy: and the change (can any change?) will not displease you. His Reverence of the Royal Jug<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Angus Barton (<date when="1787-00-00">1787</date>&#x2013;<date when="1861-00-00">1861</date>), ordained <date when="1822-00-00">1822</date> to Castleton, presented by the Duke of Queensberry and Buccleuch.

He was upon &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">the</hi> Dukes List, &#x201D; a thing which I find is little less celebrated upon earth, than the zodiac or the galaxy is in the heavens. Joy to him of the many tumblers! I expect to hear that he will kill one whole ox, and give it to the Preaching world of this city&#x2014;with at least a tun of Glen Livet [whisky] punch.

Peace be to all <hi rend="italic">these</hi> clergy!</p>
<p>Have you heard of Edward Irving, a member of a worthier class. He was down at London lately; is come back for a season; and has the offer of going to the Hatton-Garden Chapel in the metropolis, under the most flattering auspices. He was popular among the <hi rend="italic">Englishes</hi> to an extreme. Nay more&#x2014;he has just received another call. They want him in New York, to take charge of the late Dr Mason&#x2019;s congregation, the first Presbyterian establishment in <supplied>[Am]</supplied>erica, with a salary of &#xa3;1000.<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Mitchell Mason (<date when="1770-00-00">1770</date>&#x2013;<date when="1829-00-00">1829</date>), clergyman and educator, succeeded his father, John Mason, as pastor of the Scotch Presbyterian Church on Cedar St., New York, in <date when="1792-00-00">1792</date>, and helped to found the forerunner of Union Theological Seminary. He became trustee of Columbia College, resigned his pastorate in <date when="1821-00-00">1821</date>, and accepted the presidency of Dickinson College, Carlisle, Pa.</note> There is for you! On the whole Irving deserves it all and more. I believe him to be about the best man in the Scottish Church, both for head and heart. I have not heard whether he means to go across the ocean: I hope &#x26; partly expect, not.</p>
<p>For myself, I am still &#x201C;grinding in the mill.&#x201D; I enjoy better health than I did last year, that is (thanks to the fresh air of this place!) I am no longer kept in a state of nervousness, which would drive any man of common obstinacy to insanity or something worse<supplied>[.]</supplied> I wonder at the blindness of theologians: they have never assigned the Devil a bilious stomach, or sent him to Carnegie-street to hear men announcing the sale of water by tin-horns. I am a good deal recovered now, however. By degrees too I am becoming reconciled to my fate&#x2014;contented either to effect something notable, or sink ere long into the placid bed of rest&#x2014;where &#x201C;neither cauld nor care&#x201D; shall more afflict me. I have good hopes still; and am at least fifty times happier than I was. There is a tutorship which I have as it were in my offer. I owe it to Irving&#x2019;s journey to London. The terms are &#xa3;200 a-year. I have undertaken <pb id="pg-02-36" n="02:36"/>it till <date when="1822-07-00">July</date> in the interim, when the parents are to arrive. The boys are with Dr Fleming at present: and I am busy providing Planche and Mathiae &#x26; Sophocles<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Joseph Planche (<date when="1762-00-00">1762</date>&#x2013;<date when="1853-00-00">1853</date>), <hi rend="italic">Dictionnaire Grec et Fran&#x26;ccedil;ais</hi> (<date when="1809-00-00">1809</date>); August Heinrich Matthiae (<date when="1769-00-00">1769</date>&#x2013;<date when="1835-00-00">1835</date>), <hi rend="italic">Ausf&#xfc;hrliche Griechische Grammatik</hi> (Leipzig, <date when="1807-00-00">1807</date>), trans.

Carlyle later spoke of knowing Sophocles mainly in translation.</note> and so forth&#x2014;to begin the strenuous revisal of my Greek. I do not dislike the boys or the employment greatly: so it may succeed perhaps.</p>
<p>Now, my dear Fergusson, can you excuse this frantic epistle which I have written in a state of headache approaching to coma? If so, reply to it immediately, and you shall have a better. What is the nature of your <hi rend="italic">status</hi>? Of your burghers? Your companions? Your duties? Your every thing? <closer><salute>It is midnight, and I am sleepy.

<salute>My dear Eliza</salute>
<p>I thank you for your letter which gave me much pleasure, and would have given me still more had it wanted the professions of humility at the beginning. Once for all Miss Eliza Stodart I give you to understand that sincerity is my favorite virtue&#x2014; You know whether it could be consistant with sincerity to ask&#x2014;nay, urge a person to write to me whose letters afford me neither pleasure nor amusement.&#x2014;&#x2014; I have finished Julia&#x2014;Divine Julia!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Julie d&#x2019;&#xc9;tange in <hi rend="italic">La nouvelle H&#xE9;lo&#xEF;se</hi>.</note>&#x2014; What a finished picture of the most sublime virtue!&#x2014; If ever I have a child (which God forbid! my resolutions against matrimony holding out) she shall &#x201C;read it by day, and meditate by night.&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Pope, <hi rend="italic">An Essay on Criticism</hi>, l. 125.</note> If ever I am rich enough to furnish a library, it shall be the first book I buy, and shall occupy the same shelf with Chalmers and my Bible&#x2014; This is no joking&#x2014; Julia is decidedly the most moral book I ever read&#x2014; We quite mistook its nature formerly&#x2014; In the 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi> &#x26; 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi> volumes there is not one word that the most squeamish woman could be ashamed of&#x2014; Julia never <hi rend="italic">relapses</hi>!&#x2014;to the last hour&#x2014; last minute of her life, she is pure and bright as the silver Moon when the dark cloud that obscured it for a moment has passed away&#x2014; Oh she is a glorious creature!&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">is</hi>?&#x2014;would to God she really <hi rend="italic">was</hi>! I would <pb id="pg-02-37" n="02:37"/>travel far to see her! I would never leave her till she vowed to be my friend&#x2014; But Alas! She is a vision! like every thing <hi rend="italic">perfectly</hi> glorious and beautiful she is a vision!&#x2014; But back to beings of this world! George Rennie&#x2014;read&#x2014;wonder&#x2014;but be silent&#x2014;George Rennie is on the sea! and will soon be in Italy!&#x2014; What does he seek there? you will ask&#x2014; His friends answer &#x2018;improvement in the art of Sculpture&#x2019;&#x2014; I answer&#x2014;&#x2018;ruin&#x2019;&#x2014; Yes! the die is cast&#x2014;his fate is decided!&#x2014; This liberty&#x2014;this fatal liberty that his too indulgent Father allows him can lead only to ruin. False&#x2014;heartless as he is I tremble to think on all the dangers&#x2014;the allurements to which he is about to be exposed&#x2014; And in such a frame of mind! How little fit to offer any resistance!&#x2014; It is some weeks ago since Nancy Wilkie told my Mother that he meditated going abroad for the purpose of improving his taste in this stucco buisness, which, it seems, he means to prosecute <hi rend="italic">as a profession</hi>&#x2014; Chantry and Joseph<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sir Francis Chantrey (<date when="1781-00-00">1781</date>&#x2013;<date when="1841-00-00">1841</date><corr>; <ref target="volume-02/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/5113"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref></corr>), sculptor; and Samuel Joseph (<date when="1791-00-00">1791</date>&#x2013;<date when="1850-00-00">1850</date><corr>; <ref target="volume-02/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/15133"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref></corr>), sculptor<sic>.

This report was afterwards confirmed by D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Thomson who had been at Phantassie<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Farmhouse home of the Rennie family.</note> and told us he thought of writing Benjamin by a D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Quin or George Rennie who was to leave Phantassie on the Saturday following&#x2014; Can you believe it? this intelligence afflicted me&#x2014; We had not seen each other for months, and yet it seemed that we were now for the first time to be quite parted&#x2014; I had not heard his voice for many a day&#x2014;but then I had hea<supplied>[r]</supplied>d those who had conversed with him&#x2014;I had seen objects he had looked on&#x2014;I had breathed the air that he had breathed&#x2014; But now seas &#x26; countrys were to lie betwixt us&#x2014; The sun and the moon were to be the only objects we could behold in common&#x2014; <hi rend="italic">This</hi> looked like <hi rend="italic">separation</hi>! Yet do not blame me or think me weak it was the recollection of the past that made me weep at his departure and not the pain of the present&#x2014; I supped at the Davidsons that night James Wilkie told me he had called with George at our house some days before! but found us out&#x2014; I had not heard of this&#x2014; My Mother had concealed it from me&#x2014; What did she fear?&#x2014;absurd!&#x2014; Next day was the day preceeding his departure&#x2014; I resolved to return him his letters lest I might <hi rend="italic">never</hi> have another opportunity and I scorned to keep them like a sword over his head&#x2014; I sealed them and scarcely had I finished when I heard a rap&#x2014; I knew it at once&#x2014;long long I had not heard it and yet I recognised it in an instant to be his&#x2014; I ran out of the room&#x2014;on the stairs I met Janet Ewart who was staying here&#x2014; She is very <pb id="pg-02-38" n="02:38"/>nervous and thought proper to utter a loud scream&#x2014; &#x2018;I looked so pale&#x2019; she said &#x2018;she took me for a ghost&#x2019;&#x2014;idiot&#x2014;you may suppose such a folly, which must have had a most strange appearance to him (for he could not but hear the scream) was not calculated to restore my composure&#x2014; I told her that the hurry in which I had run out of the room to change my shoes had made me sick&#x2014;but I added as resolutely as a Roman &#x2018;as I hear it is <hi rend="italic">only</hi> George Rennie we may go down&#x2019;&#x2014; Down we accordingly went&#x2014; He half advanced to shake hands with me&#x2014; I made him a cold bow&#x2014; He placed a chair for me&#x2014;and went on conversing with my Mother&#x2014; He looked well&#x2014;handsome&#x2014;quite in high health and seemingly in high spirits&#x2014; I s<supplied>[c]</supplied>arcely heard a word he said my own heart beat so loud&#x2014;at length he rose&#x2014; He took leave of my Mother then looked at me as if uncertain what to do&#x2014; I held out my hand he took it and said &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">Good bye</hi>&#x2019;!&#x2014;I answered him <hi rend="italic">&#x2018;Farewell&#x2019;</hi> He left the house!&#x2014;such was the concluding scene of our <hi rend="italic">Romance</hi>!&#x2014; Great God He left the house&#x2014;the <hi rend="italic">very room</hi> where&#x2014;no matter&#x2014;as if he had never been in it in his life before&#x2014;unfeeling wretch!&#x2014; It was a dreadful trial to me to be obliged to save appearances even for some minutes <hi rend="italic">after</hi> he was gone but I went through it bravely!&#x2014; I returned his letters that night with a note (on account of which you would have blushed for me) so that he might recieve them just immediately before his setting out which would effectually prevent any reply&#x2014;and now am I done with him <hi rend="italic">for ever</hi>&#x2014;</p>

<dateline><place>3. Moray-street</place>, Wednesday-Afternoon [<date when="1822-02-13">13 February 1822</date>].</dateline>
<salute>My dear Friend,</salute>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Trait&#xE9; des Passions</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly Mme de Sta&#xEB;l&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">De l&#x2019;Influence des passions sur le bonheur des individus et des nations</hi> (<date when="1796-00-00">1796</date>).</note> appears to be in great requisition among the reading population of Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> at present: I cannot find it unoccupied in any of the Libraries to which I have access. It is vain for me to harrass the Librarians with repeated inquiries: I must wait till it <hi rend="italic">come in</hi> before I can send it you.&#x2014; Your dismissal of Irving has produced the effect anticipated from it: he inclosed me the letter which accompanies this<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Irving&#x2019;s letter to Jane was enclosed in his letter to Carlyle of <date when="1822-02-09">9 Feb.</date> It is printed in Mrs. Oliphant&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Life of Edward Irving</hi>, 2nd ed., I, 134&#x2013;36.</note>&#x2014;because &#x201C;he knew not where to find you.&#x201D; I wrap it up within a volume of the <hi rend="italic">French Sallust</hi>, the Abb&#xE9; St Real; hoping that you may derive some amusement from perusing <hi rend="italic">Doni Carlos</hi>, or the ground-work of <hi rend="italic">Venice Preserved</hi>;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >C&#xE9;sar Vichard, Abb&#xE9; de Saint-R&#xE9;al (d. <date when="1692-00-00">1692</date>), <hi rend="italic">La Conjuration des Espagnoles contre Venise</hi> (<date when="1674-00-00">1674</date>); Schiller, <hi rend="italic">Don Carlos</hi> (<date when="1787-00-00">1787</date>); Thomas Otway (<date when="1652-00-00">1652</date>&#x2013;<date when="1685-00-00">85</date>), <hi rend="italic">Don Carlos</hi> (<date when="1676-00-00">1676</date>), <hi rend="italic">Venice Preserved</hi> (<date when="1682-00-00">1682</date>).</note> or if not, that you will write me a few words on returning the book, and inclose me <hi rend="italic">something</hi> which I dare not ask for, but trust you have not forgotten. I have not detained Irving&#x2019;s letter: it arrived only yesternight.</p>
<p>The better part of a sheet still remains to me, and I have a volume of things to express to you: yet I scarce can find one word to say. It is shameful to own that I have already written two long letters to you, <pb id="pg-02-40" n="02:40"/>and burnt them both, so soon as they were respectively finished. I value your correspondence so highly that I should grasp eagerly at the privilege of continuing it, under <hi rend="italic">any</hi> terms: but my present state of mind is at once painful and contemptible. After that unfortunate visit, it seems as if our connection depended on a single hair; and I tremble lest some unguarded word may dissolve it forever. Surely if you knew into what a state of helpless agitation your anger reduces me, you would reserve the infliction of that severe chastisement for graver crimes&#x2014;for offences against you, not of form but of deed. I appeal to the tribunal of my own conscience, and plead <hi rend="italic">not guilty</hi> of any intention ever to displease you. Why then am I so unfortunate?<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A. Carlyle writes (<hi rend="italic">LL</hi>, I, 26&#x2013;27): &#x201C;The visit to Haddington, proposed in his last Letter, was duly paid by Carlyle, notwithstanding Miss Welsh&#x2019;s strongly expressed warning that it would be unwelcome to her and her Mother; and the result, as might have been foreseen by any person less blinded by Love, was well-nigh disastrous. His reception by Mrs. Welsh was formal and frigid; and, worst of all, Miss Welsh (probably on the advice of her Mother) was cold, unfriendly, and quite unlike her former self. &#x2026; &#x201C;If Carlyle carried out the plan proposed in his last Letter, he would reach Haddington, after a walk of sixteen miles, late on Friday-night (<date when="1822-02-01">1st Feb., 1822</date>), stay over night at the George Inn, and make his call on Saturday-morning. That his reception would lack cordiality, and the interview be of short duration was only what one would expect in these circumstances. &#x2026; Carlyle did not go again to Haddington for more than a year, and then only on the pressing invitation of both Mrs. Welsh and her Daughter; and but for the accidental intervention of Edward Irving, who sent a Letter to Carlyle&#x2019;s care, with the request that he would forward it to Miss Welsh, this Correspondence would in all probability have come to an untimely end.&#x201D;</note></p>
<p>You bid me write to you as a <hi rend="italic">friend</hi>. Vain injunction! I must exhibit the true state of my feelings when I write, or else write like a shallow fool: and I never felt <hi rend="italic">friendship</hi> of this sort towards any one. After the view I have obtained of your character, and the honours to which you have admitted me, I should be the dullest of the sons of men, if I could degenerate into what they call a friend. Be not displeased however. I am as far from pretending to be a lover as a friend. That pastime is not for me, at this period of my history, any more than you. I have had too much experience of the emptiness of all sublunary things; have felt too often and too bitterly, how the clay insinuates its low impediments and corrupting deformities into all the lordliest conceptions of the soul,&#x2014;ever to find much enjoyment in the languishings and happy tho&#x2019; weak delusions of boys and girls. Besides, do I not know how we stand related to each other? I understand what is your rank and what your prospects: I understand too what are my own; and perhaps there are feelings of integrity and honest pride <pb id="pg-02-41" n="02:41"/>within me, which I am as chary of, as some who make more noise about them. Do not <hi rend="italic">you</hi> look upon me as a slave, however others look upon me.</p>
<p>In fine I beg earnestly for one sentence from you, somewhat in the shape of encouragement. I am a perfect wreck at present, and know not what to do or think. There are wild retreats, indeed, in which all minds may seek refuge. I know it but too well&#x2014;the feeling of recklessness and stormy self-help, when friends grow cold, and the world seems to cast us off, and the heart gathers force from its own wretchedness, converting its &#x201C;tortures into horrid arms.&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi>, II, 63.</note> There is strength here and dignity&#x2014;tho&#x2019; full of pain:<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>., II, 147.</note> but alas! do I need to say that you are the last of all earthly beings against whom I could wish to entertain such sentiments. Once more, then, I entreat for one word of kindness. Forget the roughness of my exterior, if you think me sound within. Let me write to you with frankness and from the heart&#x2014;if you would not have me altogether despicable. The Graces cannot live under a sky so gloomy and tempestuous as mine: I lament their absence, since you lament it; but there is no remedy. If Nature had meant me for a courtly person, she would have made me richer and more impudent. In this latter point, you think she has been liberal enough: how widely, how cruelly do you mistake me!</p>
<p>I have left no room for details about myself or inquiries about you. Write as you <hi rend="italic">once</hi> would have written to me, and I shall know how to tell and how to ask.&#x2014; There is a kind of engagement for six months at least, entered into with regard to those boys: their greek and their vanities take up my time too much.&#x2014; I pass Mr Bradfute&#x2019;s door every day; and seldom without thinking of the <hi rend="italic">last</hi> time I saw you there. Would I had never seen you since! I should then still think what perhaps I must never think any more.&#x2014; Excuse all this incoherence: I am hurried and confused in a thousand ways. Farewell! May the Great Father of the fatherless, ever have you in his keeping! Farewell!</p>

<dateline><place>3. Moray-street</place>, Wednesday-night [<date when="1822-02-20">20 February 1822</date>].</dateline>
<salute>My dear Jack,</salute>
<p>I know not which of us is in debt to the other;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle had not yet received two letters which John had written to him recently, dated <date when="1822-02-16">16</date> and <date when="1822-02-20">20 Feb.</date> The earlier letter was held up and sent with the second.</note> nor does it matter: I have been meditating for some nights to allow myself an hour&#x2019;s chat with you; and I now set about the operation. Some week or two ago I got a letter from you which appeared to have lingered long upon the road: it bore marks of Glasgow on it, and came along with one from Johnstone. So far as I can recollect, it contains the latest direct intelligence from you; and tho&#x2019; I know your life is uniform enough, I naturally begin to long for some more recent account of your proceedings, being sufficiently aware that even in the most uniform life there is continual danger of sinister occurrences, which danger, it is always pleasant to be assured, has not <hi rend="italic">yet</hi> taken effect. I do not speak of the pleasure I derive from perusing your lucubrations, or contemplating the picture they afford of your enthusiastic diligence, and humble tho&#x2019; interesting duties and hopes. By some means or other I have taken up the suspicion that all is not right with you about Annan, that you are got sick, or some such affair, and my need of hearing from you is more pressing than the mere want of enjoyment. I know this persuasion or suspicion to be very absurd: but it will be more easily removed by testimony than by reasoning; and I therefore request you to set about writing to me without any unnecessary delay. You will get this sheet on Friday: I shall look for your reply in the beginning of next week. See you disappoint me not.</p>
<p>I learn with great satisfaction that you have begun the study of Greek. There can hardly be a more useful employment in your present circumstances; and the only thing that prevented me from recommending it before, was the idea that it required more energy than any one could be expected to manifest labouring under such disadvantages as press upon you at present. Happily I have been mistaken: and if I did not fear certain consequences which are too likely to result from exertions of this kind, I should certainly feel proud of the zeal you display. It strikes you at once what disadvantages I allude to; and you expect another sermon on the insipid topic of <hi rend="italic">health</hi>. I shall be <pb id="pg-02-43" n="02:43"/>as brief as possible: but I cannot avoid impressing upon you yet again the imperious necessity of moderating your efforts, if you mean to preserve this blessing. Excessive labour will ruin any one; and it is precisely persons of the finest parts whom those &#x201C;cursed nervous disorders&#x201D; select in preference as their victims. Would you experience all that is blackest and bitterest in the cup of human woe; would you even fail of attaining the object for which every thing else has thus been sacrificed? Then rush forward without stay or reflection; be up early and down late, ever on the stretch, the head full of subtle quirks<supplied>[,]</supplied> the heart of stern purposes and unspeakable longings: this <hi rend="italic">will</hi> do the business, Jack, ere long, be sure. I assert that (not to speak of the torments which beggar all speech) even in the matter of learning, I could have studied more in one day when I was perfectly healthy, than I can now do in a week. Let me not have suffered quite in vain, Jack; profit by my errors; husband your strength, and it will last you to the end. If you do not, I absolutely tremble for you. Heart cannot figure, tongue cannot tell the miseries of chronic distempers&#x2014;to the wretch that has no home, no fixed status among men, too light a purse and too keen a soul. Listen to me, while it is yet time! Oh! that some Guardian Angel had but spoken to <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, when I was in your state&#x2014;as forlorn, as firm of purpose, as anxious for preferment, as careless about health!&#x2014;how different would my after life have been, how many years of a wretched and worse than useless existence might have been spared to me!</p>
<p>Besides where is the ne<supplied>[c]</supplied>essity of making such a struggle? You are already well qualified for attending the College next winter: and there cannot rationally be a doubt of your profiting amply by it. Be moderate, then, my poor Doil; and let no care take root in thy heart. Against next <date when="1822-11-00">November</date> thou shalt be here, if Providence spare us all; and for the rest, I myself tho&#x2019; every thing should fail in other quarters, can now see thee thro&#x2019; the affair, independently of all academies and private teaching. Rely upon me: we are yet to prove a blessing to each other; and I seek no higher repayment of my cares, I deserve none higher than the pleasure they afford me in the mean time.</p>
<p>You may perhaps infer from the strain of this letter so full of anxieties about your health, that I am complaining in that respect myself. But I assure you, no. I am dragging about a load of infirmities with me still, the fruit of former imprudencies, and must continue perhaps for years (perhaps, alas! for aye) in this condition: but I have reason to rejoice rather than complain. The fine air, the quiet, which <pb id="pg-02-44" n="02:44"/>I enjoy here, and the <hi rend="italic">exercise</hi> (I have about 8 miles to walk daily) which my duties require, keep me in a state infinitely better than I was last year. I am as happy as I can expect ever to be&#x2014;which is happy enough. There is abundance of business for me, at all events; and that is the main ingredient of what we call happiness. Those boys and I have about as good as engaged, for six months, at any rate: I am to get &#xa3;100 for attending them 4 or 5 hours daily during that period; and in all probability, I think, we shall engage finally, if the parents were come. I am going to have a tough bout at Greek: but this I reckon an advantage. The Encyclopedia articles are all finished, and I do not intend taking any more at present; so also is <hi rend="italic">Faust</hi>: and I shall find means for going on with <hi rend="italic">Legendre</hi> (which I received notice this day that they are wanting to begin with): so I shall grow rich before all is done.

<p>Now write me fully. Give my love to all Mainhill, on Saturday: &#x26; tell Sandy to send me <hi rend="italic">very</hi> particular details about every thing. I am in debt to almost all the younger branches of the family. I will write them all, of a surety&#x2014;only I have very little time, and tho&#x2019; exceedingly anxious to keep all things straight I am &#x201C;a wee unconstant i&#x2019; the health part o&#x2019;t&#x201D;&#x2014;which sometimes impedes me. I am but &#x201C;a wee&#x201D; however; and shall get thro&#x2019; grandly yet. Tell me pointedly how our Mother is. <closer><salute>I am always,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My Dear Eliza</salute>
<p>You have payed the price of my story so you shall have it, though I fear that like other good things it will lose sadly in the telling.</p>
<p>Somedays before I last wrote to you, I received a letter addressed to me in a copper-plate hand, folded with mathematical exactness, and sealed with the most scrupulous nicety&#x2014; As the hand was new to me I turned the letter round, and round, and thought on every possible quarter whence it could have come; till at length it <hi rend="italic">struck me all of a heap</hi> that by breaking the seal I might penetrate into the interior and satisfy my curiosity&#x2014; Within an <hi rend="italic">envelope</hi> I found the following card&#x2014;</p>
<q><l>&#x201C;Mr George &#x2014;&#x2014; Cunningham presents his most respectful</l>
<l>&#x201C;compliments to Miss Welsh, and will do himself the honour</l>
<l>&#x201C;of waiting upon her, at any time she may appoint; for the</l>
<l>&#x201C;purpose of holding some conversation respecting a projected</l>
<l>&#x201C;literary work, in which the young Lady&#x2019;s assistance would be</l>
<l>&#x201C;peculiarly useful.<supplied>[&#x201D;]</supplied></l></q>
<p>This Billet puzzeled me exceedingly, its writer being a person with whom I was not even on bowing terms.&#x2014;M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> George Cunningham is an orphan, who has been brought up in Haddington with his Uncle M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Ainsley<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Little is known about either George Cunningham or William Ainsley. But see Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi>, II, 73&#x2013;74, where both are mentioned again after Jane&#x2019;s visit to Haddington in late <date when="1849-07-00">July 1849</date>.</note>&#x2014;a good looking man without an arm who sits in the Chapel, has a bald head that shines like glass, lives very retiredly, and once poisoned all M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Cunningham the thread-woman&#x2019;s hens, for which misdemeanour he was fined twenty pounds to the School&#x2014;of Industry.&#x2014;The said George was when a very young boy in the mathematical class with me; but during the latter part of his existence which has (I understand) been spent in M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Davidson&#x2019;s<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly the father of Colonel David Davidson of Haddington, with whom Jane corresponded later.</note> office he had quite worn out of my acquaintance, and almost out of my recollection. After various musings I came to this decision that the Creature (who was really clever at school, and won a prize from me) had written some mathematical work for which he wanted Subscribers; and <pb id="pg-02-46" n="02:46"/>thought to engage my interest by submitting his labours to my criticism or else said the Imp of Vanity within (not to be silenced, it would seem, by the most humiliating rebuffs) or else he has, like James Baird,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-02/lt-18220100-JBW-EA-01">JBW to <sic>ES</sic><corr>EA</corr>, <sic><date when="1821-12-00">Dec. 1821</date></sic><corr>[January 1822]</corr></ref>.</note> fallen in love with me from <hi rend="italic">hear-say</hi> and takes this extraordinary method of getting himself introduced into my presence. The card however required an answer; so I forthwith wrote&#x2014;</p>
<q><l>&#x201C;Miss Welsh will be <hi rend="italic">at home</hi> all this evening, and glad to</l>
<l>&#x201C;hear from M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Cunningham of any project which may, in its</l>
<l>&#x201C;results, prove advantageous to an old school-fellow, though</l>
<l>&#x201C;she is greatly at a loss to conjecture what assistance towards</l>
<l>&#x201C;any &#x2018;Literary work&#x2019; can lie with her, an individual utterly</l>
<l>&#x201C;unknown in the literary world and little qualified to attain</l>
<l>&#x201C;any distinction there&#x201D;&#x2014;</l></q>
<p>This last clause was put in merely for modesty&#x2019;s sake, for even then I was planning the <hi rend="italic">immortalizing of old maids</hi>.</p>
<p>After sitting in expectation for some hours (my Mother ever and anon repeating that I was really a <hi rend="italic">very great character</hi>) it came into my head, that the card was probably a quiz written by some of his companions&#x2014; My Mother and I fell into fits of laughter, at the idea of the effect my answer would produce upon the poor lad if he was unconscious of having said or written any thing to call it forth; and just when our mirth was at the loudest the door opened and the said George, <foreign>in propria persona</foreign>, stood before us&#x2014; The terrible agitation visible in his deportment at his entrance strengthened my suspicions of his heart&#x2014; I held out my hand to him with a <hi rend="italic">most winning smile</hi> of condescension&#x2014;but <hi rend="italic">even my</hi> [<hi rend="italic">my</hi> underscored twice] smile did not restore him to composure. He seated himself with his eyes most religiously fixed upon the carpet; and there was silence&#x2014; My Mother vouchsafed a remark upon the weather&#x2014;the unfortunate Creature replied in a quavering voice and again there was silence&#x2014; At length my Mother compassionating the deplorable stagnation of his intellect withdrew&#x2014; The door closed on us&#x2014; The literary man looked into the fire; and I looked at the literary man, and a q<supplied>[u]</supplied>eer, little, odd shaped man it was!&#x2014; He coughed sundry times and at length began. &#x201C;You, no doubt, expect <hi rend="italic">Madam</hi> [underscored twice], that I am going to produce a novel, or Tragedy of my own composition, for your perusal but,&#x2014;but really I have no such thing&#x2014;&#x201D; So! (thought I) It is as I suspected! This odd Thing is really in love with me! &#x201C;The subject&#x201D; he continued &#x201C;which <pb id="pg-02-47" n="02:47"/>I wish to mention to you is&#x2014;it is&#x2014;a Magazine&#x201D; &#x2014; The last word came out of his throat, bolt, as if a bullet had been at its back and the Creature seemed much relieved&#x2014; &#x201C;A Magazine?&#x201D; I repeated with surprise the intelligence conveyed by this important word not being so luminous as he seemed to have anticipated, &#x201C;A Magazine here?&#x2014;in Haddington?&#x2014; Do you mean to write a Magazine?&#x201D;&#x2014; &#x201C;I mean to assist,&#x201D; He replied somewhat peevishly, &#x201C;and I am of opinion, that this County affords local interest sufficient to render a work of that sort published by M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Tait extremely acceptable&#x2014; All that is wanting <hi rend="italic">is people to write it</hi>.&#x201D; (What a desideratum!!) &#x201C;I do not doubt,&#x201D; I replied, &#x201C;if you can find people to write it and people to <hi rend="italic">read</hi> it, &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Taits&#x2019; Magazine</hi>&#x201D; will do just as well as &#x201C;Blackwoods&#x201D; or &#x201C;Waugh&#x2019;s&#x201D; or &#x201C;any body else&#x2019;s<supplied>[.]</supplied>&#x201D; &#x201C;If <hi rend="italic">you</hi> and those who are <hi rend="italic">qualified</hi> would only <hi rend="italic">step forward</hi>!&#x201D; said <hi rend="italic">the George</hi>. &#x201C;But really Sir I do <hi rend="italic">not</hi> feel myself qualified to engage in such a<supplied>[n]</supplied> undertaking.&#x2014;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Ah! Miss Welsh&#x201D; exclaimed the Creature growing very bold, &#x201C;you must not tell that <hi rend="italic">here</hi>; we all know well (with a sigh) for what You are <hi rend="italic">qualified</hi>&#x201D;</p>
<p>I had nothing to reply to such a compliment&#x2014; The solemn Thing twinkeled its eyes, rolled its head about like a China Mandarin and when it seemed firmly balanced on its shoulders continued with a smile of ineffable self-complacency &#x201C;You are thinking who are the Editors?&#x2014;&#x201D; Really I was thinking no such thing but he looked so well pleased I had not the heart to contradict him&#x2014;</p>
<p>&#x201C;And pray Sir who are they?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;We do not wish ourselves to be known,&#x201D; said he, &#x201C;but I may mention to <hi rend="italic">you</hi> that Peter Dodds and I are to be the principal Editors&#x2014;&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;And who is Peter Dodds?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Provost Dodd&#x2019;s son.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Indeed! I thought I had been at school with all <hi rend="italic">his</hi> family&#x2014; I did not know he had a son of that name!<supplied>[&#x201D;]</supplied></p>
<p>&#x201C;Oh&#x2014;Peter went to school <hi rend="italic">long after you left it</hi>&#x2014;&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;What! You do not mean that the <hi rend="italic">Boy</hi> who is in M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Davidsons office is going to be Editor of a Magazine?<supplied>[&#x201D;]</supplied></p>
<p><supplied>[&#x201C;]</supplied>The same! He is a very clever <hi rend="italic">Young man</hi><supplied>[.&#x201D;]</supplied></p>
<p>&#x2018;M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Cunningham&#x2019;&#x2014;said I with all the gravity I could muster&#x2014; &#x201C;M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Tait is a decent, industrious Lad and I am of opinion that the first step to be taken in this business is to secure him against being ruined.&#x201D;</p>
<p><pb id="pg-02-48" n="02:48"/>&#x201C;Oh&#x2014;Peter Dodds and I mean to do that&#x2014; There is no fear of M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Tait&#x2014;&#x201D;</p>
<p>I next proceeded to exercise all my powers of argument in trying to convince this candidate for literary fame, that it would be more adviseable for the hitherto <hi rend="italic">latent</hi> Genius of Haddington to distribute itself among the various Periodical works in the Metropolis, when, if not admired, the <hi rend="italic">strength</hi> of others would sustain their <hi rend="italic">weakness</hi> and they might <hi rend="italic">hope to pass unobserved</hi>, instead of by uniting in a Body rendering <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;darkness visible&#x201D;</hi><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi>, I, 63.</note>&#x2014;</p>
<p>And the Creature, on his side, used every argument he was Master of to induce Me to take an active part in this most unpromising Magazine&#x2014;which however I positively declined, at least till I was assured by the success of the first number that it would not go to the Devil&#x2014;</p>
<p>We parted <hi rend="italic">mutually</hi> amused (I believe) after an interview of more than an hours length. And here ends my story&#x2014; It may not seem <hi rend="italic">to you</hi> so laughable as I led you to expect for words <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> do it justice&#x2014;but to me who saw the Creature&#x2019;s pompous absurdity in all the vividness of reality; and who am moreover gifted with a somewhat <hi rend="italic">too</hi> lively perception of the Ridiculous, it was more than laughable&#x2014;it was really <hi rend="italic">overpow</hi><supplied>[<hi rend="italic">e</hi>]</supplied><hi rend="italic">ring</hi>.&#x2014;One night when it was very stormy, I lay awake till four o&#x2019;clock in the Morning thinking on the Perils of such a night at sea, and then the George &#x26; his Magazine came into my head, and the multitude of odd conceits my imagination suggested, operating on the nervousness occasioned by want of sleep, threw me into the most ungovernable fit of Mirth I ever, in my life, experienced. The noise I made awoke my Mother, who finding me lying at her side in a state of utter helplessness, sending forth loud and repeated &#x2018;shouts of joy,&#x2019; fancied first I was dreaming and then that I had gone mad&#x2014;and she was really in a state of serious alarm before I could compose myself sufficiently to explain the occasion of my illtimed transports. A tolerably well expressed, printed plan of the work has been distributed among the inhabitants&#x2014; I am sorry I have lost my copy&#x2014; M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C promised me a sight of the manuscript papers from which I anticipate <hi rend="italic">great delight</hi>&#x2014; If the first Number (which I dare swear will be the last) ever <hi rend="italic">gets out</hi> I will send it you.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Despite Jane&#x2019;s derision, George Tait (<date when="1795-00-00">1795</date>&#x2013;<date when="1844-00-00">1844</date>), bookseller, published five numbers of <hi rend="italic">The East Lothian Magazine; or, Literary and Statistical Journal</hi>, containing articles on history, literature, and agriculture, from <date when="1822-04-00">April</date> to <date when="1822-12-00">December 1822</date>, and revived it as <hi rend="italic">The East Lothian and Statistical Journal</hi> from <date when="1830-07-00">July 1830</date> to <date when="1831-06-00">June 1831</date>.</note>&#x2014; What dreadful <pb id="pg-02-49" n="02:49"/>weather this is!&#x2014; The very elements seem to have leagued with<hi rend="italic">that Wretch</hi><note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Rennie at sea.</note> against me&#x2014;for it is impossible to hear such winds and not to <hi rend="italic">think</hi> of him&#x2014; God grant he may not be drowned! and that he may return to Scotland alive! Were he dead, you know I should forget his <hi rend="italic">faults</hi>&#x2014; And that&#x2014;that would be dreadful! Could I ever forget <hi rend="italic">his faults</hi> <supplied>[!]</supplied> He might then indeed have the <hi rend="italic">glory</hi> of having made the proudest heart in Britain <hi rend="italic">break</hi>.&#x2014; But do not&#x2014;for mercy&#x2019;s sake do not &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">pity</hi>&#x201D; me. I would almost as soon that people <hi rend="italic">should hate</hi> as <hi rend="italic">pity</hi> [underscored twice] me. And I shall not be <hi rend="italic">revenged</hi>?&#x2014; My revenge shall be great as his fault is great&#x2014;and noble as his fault is base.</p>
<p>I forgot to mention <hi rend="italic">one</hi> instance of his effrontery at our last Meeting. Thinking that Janet Ewart might <hi rend="italic">remark</hi> my <hi rend="italic">silence</hi> I summoned forth my fortitude, and enquired for Margaret.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Rennie&#x2019;s sister, later Mrs. Manderson.</note> &#x2018;She is very unwell,&#x2019; said he, <supplied>[&#x201C;]</supplied>and wearying exceedingly to see you. W<hi rend="italic">e</hi> have been expecting you at Phantassie for a long time&#x2014; <hi rend="italic">I</hi> wish you would go to day&#x2014; The carriage is up&#x2014; I brought it for a Miss Wilson who has come from Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>&#x2014;so you had best just go with <hi rend="italic">us</hi>&#x201D;&#x2014; Oh the Devil incarnate!&#x2014; I have been once at Phantassie since he left it&#x2014; It was <hi rend="italic">trying</hi>&#x2014;but I went through it <hi rend="italic">bravely</hi>. Poor Margaret is now confined to bed&#x2014;to all appearances dying.&#x2014; How could he leave her at such a time? his favorite she was too! And yet perhaps it was to save his feelings from the melancholy&#x2014;but he has no feeling&#x2014;none&#x2014;</p>
    <p>I have sacrificed a German lesson to you to day so I may perhaps be excused if I require a little of your time in return. Now my dear dear Angel Bessy (God help thee) will you take the trouble to go to Browns<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Merchant in Edinburgh.</note> and purchase for me a pair of very handsome crystal Jelly glasses!!! as the Comb is rather beyond the demensions of my purse, or rather of my Mother&#x2019;s (for you know I never carry one) I mean to ornament my <hi rend="italic">head</hi> with <hi rend="italic">these</hi> [underscored twice]&#x2014; (How could you suppose I could be so extravagant as to buy a Coronet for <hi rend="italic">myself</hi>?) My Mother got beautiful jelly glasses from him for M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> W (who by the way has not written me <hi rend="italic">one word</hi> since she <hi rend="italic">got married</hi>) perhaps M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Brown may remember them&#x2014; &#x2014;And will you also my ever <hi rend="italic">adored</hi> Bessy (<hi rend="italic">This</hi> is further off) go to Gall &#x26; Spurzheim&#x2014;no&#x2014;Gall and Leckky<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jane is playing with names, but she really means Galli and Zuppi, artificial flower-makers, 47 Thistle St. She crossed out Spurzheim.</note> or some such thing and prevail on them to give you two modest <hi rend="italic">little flowers</hi> or a little wreath of white in exchange for this <hi rend="italic">Monster</hi>&#x2014; Janet Ewart heard me complaining of having nothing to <pb id="pg-02-50" n="02:50"/>put on my head at a party here one night and when she returned to town very attentively sent me this but it is far too <hi rend="italic">fashionable</hi> for me&#x2014;my head is quite lost in it&#x2014; If you take one a little higher they may perhaps be more willing to exchange it.&#x2014; And when all this is done my <hi rend="italic">good</hi> Bessy send me the amount of my debt and Aggy&#x2019;s. I would enclose money if I had it but my Mother&#x2019;s notes &#x201C;be all done&#x201D;!&#x2014; I send you some lines I got lately, give them to Mr. Aitken&#x2014; they are more in <hi rend="italic">his way</hi> than the <hi rend="italic">Cheese</hi>, return him also my thanks for the <hi rend="italic">fun</hi> he procured me&#x2014;Ask David Ritchy,<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ritchie&#x2019;s note: &#x201C;This, I suppose, is David Ritchie, afterwards minister of Tarbolton, Ayrshire.

<p><salute>Well Sir&#x2014;</salute>I have to thank you for your last, which certainly is the most <hi rend="italic">tasteful</hi> Epistle I ever, in my life, received. I verily believe there is not a word of it, that could offend the the nicest taste, or most musical ear&#x2014; All is harmony, from beginning to end&#x2014;and the Metaphor and Antithesis in which it abounds render the style <hi rend="italic">surprisingly</hi> rich &#x26; striking&#x2014; Surely with such a <hi rend="italic">model of composition</hi> I should be satisfied! and yet (to the everlasting dishonour of my <hi rend="italic">taste</hi> be it confessed) when I considered your letter attentively, instead of being in raptures with <hi rend="italic">it</hi>, I was in a downright passion at <hi rend="italic">myself</hi> for having been cheated, by the pleasure of the <hi rend="italic">Ear</hi> into listening with <hi rend="italic">momentary</hi> complacency to sentiments I had already heard over and over and over again.</p>

<salute>My dear Alick,</salute>
<p>I have this moment looked over your very friendly and amusing letter. It bears no resemblance at all to what the wicked jester Shandy calls &#x201C;a plain&#x201D;;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <hi rend="italic">Tristram Shandy</hi>, VII, chap. xlii, for the dilemma a plain presents to travel writers, chap. xliii for &#x201C;Plain Stories.&#x201D; Alexander had said that he was following the example of Sterne&#x2019;s Tristram in describing a &#x201C;plain.&#x201D;</note> but resembles rather a fine variegated champaign country, in which are both hills and vallies with a due proportion of wood and water and every thing else requisite to diversify and embellish the scene. Do not expect me to repay you in kind, at present: I am hurried to an extreme degree, the porter is to be back in an hour, and there is a little round fat man (Galloway the Philomath)<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Galloway (<date when="1796-00-00">1796</date>&#x2013;<date when="1851-00-00">1851</date>). From the parish of Symington, Lanarkshire, he had graduated M.A. from Edinburgh University, and now, through the influence of Professor Wallace (whose daughter Galloway married in <date when="1831-00-00">1831</date>), was able to obtain a living in the city by private teaching. At the end of this year he obtained appointment as mathematics teacher at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, and at about the same time invited Carlyle to become a candidate for another such opening, for &#x201C;about &#xa3;200 a year with house and garden&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">EL</hi>, p. 238). Carlyle wrote to inquire further, but the matter ended there. Galloway left Sandhurst in <date when="1827-00-00">1827</date>, and in <date when="1833-00-00">1833</date> was offered a professorship in astronomy at Edinburgh, but chose instead to become actuary with the Amicable Life Assurance Co., London. He was a contributor to the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Encyclopaedia</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</hi> (7th ed.), and to the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review</hi>.</note> beside me, <pb id="pg-02-53" n="02:53"/>whom I am too happy to have got fixed for a while to a mathematical problem, which has quenched his chattering somewhat. He means well to me, and has become very civil at length; so I cannot rightly <hi rend="italic">put him out</hi>. Situated thus I can only scribble hurriedly and without connection. You will be content if possible.</p>
<p>I return thanks again, within my heart, to the great Giver of all good, for the continued welfare of all those who are so justly dear to me. We never think how wretched we might be, if only a few particulars in our destiny were altered. If any of us were sick, were dead&#x2014;! What are all the light evils of this Earth, so long as we are all <hi rend="italic">together</hi> to comfort &#x26; stand by each other! With health and true friends and an honest mind, let no man complain.</p>
<p>I participate in your anxieties about your future destiny, &#x26; cordially sympathize with a sentiment so natural. You speak too little to me on this subject; afraid, I suppose, of encroaching on my thoughts, occupied enough, as you think, with my own fortunes. It is not the case, however; I often think of you as connected with the past, and often strive to figure out what will be our mutual relation in the time to come. You should write me very copiously on this point: I may be able to give you advice, perhaps assistance, and at least fellow-feeling. Tell me about it <hi rend="italic">particularly</hi> next time. It is surely galling to a young active mind to look forward to such a fate as sometimes overtakes the improvident or unfortunate cultivator of the soil in our days. To become a Dick of the Grange,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Identified in Alick&#x2019;s letter of <date when="1822-04-21">21 April</date> only as &#x201C;that luckless soul &#x2026; forced to turn <hi rend="italic">Cotter</hi> at the farm of Eastgilts.&#x201D;</note> for example!&#x2014; But beyond all doubt you have no such thing to fear; you are at present discharging a sacred duty; and you have every reason to look forward to a comfortable termination of it. A hundred or two hundred pounds would stock you a neat snug little farm if times were better, and none who knows your habits and talents would have the smallest doubt about repayment. Who is to advance me 200 pence? you ask. Whoever of us has it, I answer; and till then, we are all alike. Circumstances seem to render it conceivable that I, your obliged and not ungrateful brother, may <pb id="pg-02-54" n="02:54"/>have such a sum in my own possession, ere a year or two elapse; and I here make the promise&#x2014;not rashly, for I have thought of it fifty times&#x2014;to let you have the use of it, whenever you think fit. This is, to be sure, selling the chickens while the hen is hatching; and in this light, it looks rather foolish: but you know it is honestly meant; and the hope it points to is not quite chimerical. And granting that it should utterly evaporate&#x2014;are you not still a hardy free-minded Scotsman, with habits of diligence and frugality known even to few Scotsmen, ready to front the world whatever way it offers itself&#x2014;and to gather an honest livelihood, from any point of the compass, where a livelihood is to be found? I say therefore, fear nothing! You, nor <supplied>[any]</supplied> of us, will never be a <foreign><hi rend="italic">snool</hi></foreign> [mean-spirited person]; we have not the blood of snools in our bodies. Nor shall you ever seriously meditate crossing the great Salt Pool to plant yourself in the Yankeeland. That is a miserable fate for any one, at best; never dream of it. Could you banish yourself from all that is interesting to your mind, forget the history, the glorious institutions, the noble principles of old Scotland, that you might eat a better dinner perhaps (which you care little for), or drink more rum (which you care nought for) as a great <foreign><hi rend="italic">pursy</hi></foreign> [purse-proud] Yankee? Never! my boy&#x2014;you will never think of it. Scotland has borne us all hitherto; we are all Scots to the very heart; and the same bleak but free and independent soil will I hope receive us all into its bosom at last.</p>
<p>But I must drop this subject&#x2014;for my sheet is next to done. Write about it, next opportunity&#x2014; Why should you keep your anxieties from me? Which of mine do I keep from you?&#x2014; I have little room or little materials for filling <supplied>[the]</supplied> room <supplied>[that is left]</supplied> with news. I am in pretty good health; and going on with the Bullers who continue to do well. I am engaged to be with them for 6 months any way&#x2014;the wage &#xa3;100. They (Brewster &#x26; others) are wanting the book, I spoke of translating; and the two boys are reading high in Greek&#x2014;wherein I am greatly rusted. Thus I am very busy, and shall be busier&#x2014;but business is life to me&#x2014;if not excessive, and even excess in it is better than indolence. Waugh is alive here, but without means; and still in high spirits. He wants to borrow, and cannot find a lender: I am sorry for him heartily. As to the <foreign><hi rend="italic">hash</hi></foreign> Will of Breckonhill,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified. Breckonhill is a height and farm two and one-half miles northwest of Ecclefechan.</note> and the other <foreign><hi rend="italic">sma&#x2019; trash</hi></foreign> of Annandale, I never see them or hear a word about them.&#x2014; Write me fully and tell me all the news.

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>If any proof were wanting to shew how miserable a thing is procrastination, my present case would exemplify it well. I have intended writing to you at length, for the last three nights; but never could make good my purpose: and behold me now&#x2014;writing like &#x201C;fire,&#x201D; and prepared to think myself too happy, if the Porter will but stay half-an-hour beyond his time, till I can finish even this most small and pitiful scrap, which I am now inditing confusedly and scribbling over still more confusedly. Excuse my unfortunate miscarriages: I should have thanked you long ago, for your new kindnesses to me; and told you many things, which I know you want to be informed about: but you will forgive me, as you have often done, and expect better of me another time.</p>
<p>As to the shirts and neck<supplied>[c]</supplied>loths, I shall need a large additional supply if I go to Buller&#x2019;s family: but it will be time enough to think of this when the arrangement is finally made. I can go on excellently in the mean time. I am sorry to trouble you with clothes &#x26; so forth; but Garthwaite came in last time, in a furious haste, and I threw in every thing that came in my way into the box. This body here washes things not ill. What lots of eggs you send me! I am quite ashamed when I think what use you are wont to put them to. Let me beg you to accept of this small picture, which I inclose; and use it to get yourself tea and all other conveniences that you need. Why do you not tell me pointedly what you are in want of? No use of money in the world is so agreeable to me / But the Porter is here</p>

<p><pb id="pg-02-57" n="02:57"/><!--Picture of pointing hand-->Upon the whole, I like this task better than any I have had for a long while: I have enjoyed a thousand little pleasures in going on with it. I hope you will send me more work immediately: and&#x2014;observe&#x2014;mark along with the passages selected, the <hi rend="italic">page</hi> where you find them&#x2014;or my translation must run a risk of being wide of the mark. The phrases marked with a star (*), I could not discover in a cursory glance, which I had, to-day, of an edition of Carlos (the same as yours): and therefore they are not to be relied on as correct. If I have erred&#x2014;send them back&#x2014;again and again, till all be clear as noon. You will speedily, it is probable, be far beyond the reach of my assistance: let me help you as long as I can.</p>
<p>Those books have been waiting for you, some day or two; and recollect you only said I <hi rend="italic">need</hi> not send them. As to writing, I know I <hi rend="italic">must</hi> not, and so refrain. Indeed I have no great temptation to act otherwise; for I will confess your letter pleased me less at first sight than it might have done. This morning, when they gave it me, I was moping and musing (as my custom is) over ten thousand thoughts which I have no living heart to entrust with; and that strain of elegant mockery, tho&#x2019; richly merited, I doubt not, appeared somewhat unsuitable to the earnestness (whatever be the extravagance) of the feelings against which it was directed. Alas! I know too well&#x2014;without any telling&#x2014;that <hi rend="italic">the style</hi> is absurd enough: but surely it is not for the sake of rhetoric and grammar that we write to each other. It seems to me that the chief end of letters is to exhibit to each a picture of the others soul&#x2014;of all the hopes and fears that agitate us, the joys and sorrows and varied anxieties in which a heart&#x2019;s friend may be expected to sympathize: and if I may trust my own judgement, this employment is even more useful (I say not a word of the delight attending it) than any other to which our imperfect means of communication can be devoted. The three grains of knowledge mixed up in three bushels of error, which people make such a din about, are taught in colleges and schools, and set forth in ten thousand times ten thousand heavy tomes: why should our poor scanty pages be employed in adding to the heap?

Is it fit then that what is less dignified and altogether selfish in our nature should be cultivated exclusively? O! for a friend a bosom-friend&#x2014;the treasure which many seek and few successfully&#x2014;to be our own and ours alone, to have but one soul and spirit with us, to reflect <pb id="pg-02-58" n="02:58"/>back our every feeling, to love us and be loved without measure!

<p>Send me a letter, I pray you, when you return those tomes. If you can avoid it, do not laugh <hi rend="italic">much</hi> at me: but any way, write.

<salute>My dear Jack,</salute>
<p>I understand the Carrier is to be here to-morrow; and as I have a spare hour at present before bed-time, and little inclination to attempt any kind of study, it seems advisable to catch old Time by the forelock, and make ready a small epistle for your perusal, while I have leisure to do it. The coherence of my ideas cannot easily be great; since, besides the inaptitude for thinking just alluded to, my attention is at this moment more strongly than pleasantly solicited by the jollity of certain male and female mantua-makers,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A mantua was a loose-fitting gown worn especially in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, but in TC&#x2019;s time &#x201C;mantua-makers&#x201D; were simply dressmakers.</note> established in the floor above me, whose stock of muscular movement seems to be very considerable. But we two are not sticklish with each other: and in truth the <hi rend="italic">devilry</hi> of these unhappy se<supplied>[a]</supplied>mstresses appears at last to have dwindled from leaping in the hop-and-step way into various quavers and social catches, of which I am lucky enough to hear only a very few echoes. I wish no harm to any of the poor animals; they have never disturbed me till this night; and I trust Providence will continue to them a bountiful supply of tape and bees&#x2019; wax and thin tea and whatever else they require&#x2014;for many a year.</p>
<p>Your two letters by the Jurist,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Dalgliesh.</note> came to hand about a fortnight ago. I read them with the pleasure that all your letters give me: they exhibit the same picture of young ardour, honest affection, and inflexible perseverance in worthy tho&#x2019; difficult pursuits, for which I have always loved you. The last quality, perseverance, I particularly respect: it is the very hinge of all virtues.&#x2014; On looking over the world, the cause of nine parts in ten of the lamentable failures which occur in men&#x2019;s undertakings &#x26; darken and degrade so much of their history, lies not in the want of talents or the will to use them, but in the vacillating <pb id="pg-02-60" n="02:60"/>and desultory mode of using them&#x2014;in flying from object to object, in starting away at each little disgust, and thus applying the force which might conquer any <hi rend="italic">one</hi> difficulty to a series of difficulties so large that no human force can conquer them. The smallest brook on earth, by continual running, has hollowed out for itself a considerable valley to flow in: the wildest tempest, by its occasional raging, over-turns a few cottages, uproots a few trees, and leaves after a short space no mark behind it. Commend me therefore to the Dutch virtue of perseverance! Without it all the rest are little better than fairy gold, which glitters in your purse, but when taken to the market proves to be&#x2014;slate or cinders.</p>
<p>This preaching, my beloved Jack, is directed against myself who have need of it, not against you who have none. &#x201C;Improve the passing hour, for it will never never return&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Apparently an echo of Isaac Watts&#x2019;s poem on the busy bee, with additions.</note> is a precept which you not only assent to but practice&#x2014;your last year&#x2019;s history shews with what success. I admire your gallant <hi rend="italic">onslaught</hi> upon the Greek language, and augur great advantages to you from it. By all means persist. The acquirement of this noble tongue, in which Plato wrote and Homer sung, will have a marked and beneficial influence on your subsequent literary life. In this Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> College, few acquire it without previous preparation at school. See a mournful example in myself!&#x2014; Shallow dominies of Annandale!&#x2014;but for you, I need not now be wrestling with lexicons and grammars.</p>
<p>It will be right for you now, I think, to take up some book&#x2014;the New Testament for example&#x2014;or better&#x2014;Dalziel&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Collectanea Minora</hi>,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably Andrew Dalzel (<date when="1742-00-00">1742</date>&#x2013;<date when="1806-00-00">1806</date>), <hi rend="italic">Collectanea Graeca Minora</hi>, published in three parts in <date when="1787-00-00">1787</date>.</note> and read it as you can; learning the other verbs and remaining matters as you proceed. When we next meet, I make sure of finding you a competent <foreign><hi rend="italic">Graeculus</hi></foreign>, if not a complete <foreign><hi rend="italic">Graecus</hi></foreign>.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >One with a little Greek if not a finished Greek scholar.</note></p>
<p>For myself, study has in a measure ceased to be a thing of which I am capable. At no period of my life did I spend my time more unprofitably than at present. Sciences and arts and book-learning no longer inspire me with any suitable interest; and my ignorance, my indecision, my weakness of all kinds, prevents me from fixing my heart on any one object of my own inventing. Well did old Crispus say: &#x201C;Truly <hi rend="italic">that</hi> man, I think, lives and enjoys existence, who intent on <hi rend="italic">some undertaking</hi>, aims at the glory of some excellent attainment or <pb id="pg-02-61" n="02:61"/>illustrious exploit!&#x201D;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sallust (Gaius Sallustius
Crispus) (<date>86&#x2013;34 <hi rend="small-caps">b.c.</hi></date>), Roman historian and politician. Cf. <hi rend="italic">Cataline Conspiracy</hi>, 2, 9.</note> It is in fact certain that I <hi rend="italic">must</hi> write <hi rend="italic">a book</hi> [underscored twice]. Would to Heaven! I had a subject, which I <hi rend="italic">could</hi> discuss and at the same time loved to discuss! I cannot say for certain whether I have the smallest genius: but I know I have unrest enough to serve a parish<supplied>[.]</supplied> Pity me, Jack; but hope that I shall not always be so pitiful a thing.</p>
<p>One main cause of all this self-reproach, which I have merited long but never got so keenly as now, is a partial return of health. When a sick man begins to blame <hi rend="italic">himself</hi>, and to fret &#x26; worry and fume, about loss of time and so forth, you may suspect him to be past the worst point of his disorder. In fact, I am gathering strength&#x2014;slowly, but still gathering it. In a year or two I may be quite sound. At present, I have what in Annandale is called &#x201C;sufferable ease&#x201D; at all times; and hours occur when I get immersed in thoughts that can make me forget that there is such a thing as digestion in the world. As for my employment, it goes on pretty fairly; the Bullers are boys of many good qualities and many faults; I am too little beside them at present, to grapple on fair terms with their inattentions and frequent peccadilloes. However in the main, they are very superior boys both in head and heart: and I think the undertaking will succeed ultimately in spite of all. I expect to have the hours changed soon: for it cuts up my time horribly as arranged at present.&#x2014; But see! the end is at hand, and it behoves me to use despatch. Thou must write me by the Post <hi rend="italic">forthwith</hi>. Next time I will send down a copy of my critique on Faust: Perhaps I shall get it to-morrow in in [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] time: but any way I will write again soon. Call at Bogside &#x26; see Johnston: he will tell you about Graham of Burnswark &#x26; Edward Irving, who were my guests lately. Poor James!<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Johnston.</note> I am very sorry that so worthy a man should be so luckless. What is he doing? Remind him that he is to write. Make my best compliments to your worthy fellow-burgher Ben Nelson.</p>

<salute>My Dear Carlyle</salute>
<p>You have indeed set me a task which I am neither willing nor able to perform, not willing because you are one whom I have been accustomed to defend, and how to judge or condemn you I find not, not able because your mind is dissimilar to my own, and rises, I think, into an altitude where it is not congenial for mine to live. But yet at your earnest request, and from regard to your future prosperity in that sphere, more congenial to me, of actual life out of which you must drink your happiness or misery I undertake and shall faithfully perform.</p>
<p>And for the sake of breadth as well as distinctness, I shall take the following order&#x2014;the habits of your understanding, of your feelings and of your conduct. Your intellect has always appeared to me too accute, whether it be its nature or the impulse of your feelings I know not, but it has an impatience, and quick decision that seems to me against the accuracy of its results, and much against the pleasant communication of them. In writing it is not so, there is much wisdom then, and much truth. It must be the presence of another that excites it to such promptitude&#x2014;and the perception of his weakness or his prejudice. Now this ought to have the opposite effect, for we have then not only the truth but the <hi rend="italic">raiment</hi> of the truth to consult for. not only the pleasing of ourselves but the not offending of our neighbour&#x2014; You bear most impetuously to a point, and have got to an issue, before our minds have addressed themselves to the question, and hence we are obliged to be silent, contented to listen, or we have to arm ourselves with seeming indifference that we may not appear to be outrun, or we have to lose temper and flatly contradict your conclusion, and shew dislike of the discussion. Guard yourself here well<supplied>[.]</supplied> If I might be bold to hazard a stricture upon the <hi rend="italic">make</hi> of your understanding it does not proceed methodically enough. You are so full of matter, that you would require double skill and endeavour after distribution. Your argument is too full of particulars, all telling, but the individual or aggregate weight not seemingly told even to yourself. Hence you drop towards your conclusion into a falling key&#x2014;maintain a running doubt with yourself, and at length come perhaps to the conclusion that it is the other way&#x2014; But this perhaps may be my own defect of particulars justifying itself&#x2014; It is unfortunate you have not yet joined <pb id="pg-02-63" n="02:63"/>yourself to any cause in which men are deeply concerned, for then the interests of that cause you prized would to your hand have distributed your knowledge, and given weight and decision to your judgements. You understand rather like a thinking than an acting man. This however is perhaps the necessary consequence of your circumstances. These three things combined, your penetration to perceive the remote bearings of the question, and your impatience to balance and judge the whole, with no call of occupation or authority of any kind to drive you to settled issues, have produced that habit to which none is more alive than yourself of doubting of things certain rather than ascertaining things doubtful. This makes your knowledge yield you so little happiness, and it has not yet yielded you any power, but ministered strength to your ideal existence which was originally strong enough of itself. Now, though I see truth in what I have said I know not how it is to be mended. There are things which you reverence, religion, liberty, domestic ties trusty friendship, female love, and above all the independence of the soul. Could you not cherish these loves, and make them fruitful. Bringing your wonderful knowledge and invention to decorate &#x26; strengthen them both within yourself, and for the worlds sake. Find out what you love &#x26; understand for that, and act for it, and unite friendships upon finding men with similar sympathies&#x2014; Now, really, this is important, your mind might minister a pillar of strength, and a wealth of beauty to whatsoever is worthy&#x2014;and at the present moment it is corroding itself. Cast it forth speedily, and oh! let it be upon something worthy of a man, something which you truly love. Your wit, your sarcasm your contempt your hatred, at this moment threaten to devour your benevolence, your admiration and your tender affection. Permit it not for the Love you bear Heaven Earth and yourself. Not that you should extinguish these sensibilities not less noble nor less bountifully given, because in general harmfully used&#x2014;but that you should draw them in as helps-meet for the other kindlier &#x26; better sensibilities, for the purpose of withering up whatever opposes them. In that review of Faust, which for all you say against it, is worthy the first critical name in the age, it would have been worthy your great mind to have philosophized the character which Goethe has poetized, and not only so, but to have instructed mankind how to guard against the evil of the tree of knowledge. Carlyle, this is in you, and it will be your salvation, the salvation of many future sons of genius to arise, it is in you to meditate, and map out these obliquities in the path of knowledge, and to trace how it may be made the sure path of wisdom and <pb id="pg-02-64" n="02:64"/>happiness. For surely I cannot be mistaken that to know well this our sphere, is to possess it well, or rather is before possessing it well. And though it will not carry back its limitations, it will teach us full liberty within them. In doing this, which you are so qualified for by having sounded so many of its bitter waters, which others dare not approach, you serve your species, and our common Father, and in the next sphere of our being, are more worthy of honour for having endeavoured to purify and brighten this. In all that I have said, I do not except revealed religion of which you know the necessity, and feel some of the strongest applications.</p>
<p>Now of your feelings I shall speak first as they bear upon yourself, then as they bear upon others. Your opinion of yourself wants decision, or seems to want it. My opinion of you is made up &#x26; need not here be repeated&#x2014;but for yourself, to hear you speak, one would take you for the most aimless indifferent mortal upon earth, whereas you are one of the clearest-sighted, and acutely-suffering. Now what is the use of this? First you are lost to many who seek for a sufficient love in a sufficient mind. Then you lay others off their guard who come on to crush a moth, and find it sting their foot &#x26; escape their tread. Learn to esteem yourself up to your proper dimensions and to act accordingly. In the discourse take tone, take place. They listen to you often as a curiosity of knowledge, not as a man of knowledge. They dread you as Cap-a-pee-armed champion, rather than shelter beside you as a guardian of what is good &#x26; peaceful. Give men the right view of you and they will both wonder &#x26; respect, for I know no vice in practice or opinion with which you are chargeable. Again I crave your attention to this&#x2014; Give men time to know you, and take time to know them&#x2014; It is this incongruity between what you are, and what you seem to be, which marrs their judgment. Not that I ask you to court men&#x2019;s favour, but that I would save you from uphappy rencounters; from misapprehension and misrepresentation, and smooth the way to honour and to life. Now with regard to your opinion of men you go far too much upon intellect, I mean in the literary world&#x2014; I do not mean <supplied>[bare?]</supplied> intellect, but you look for something which may be the fruit of much intellect wedded to the other parts of their nature. Now in this Scotland there is a subtlety but no largeness of intellect&#x2014;there is a caution which is timorous, and an economy which is rigorous. There is a stint and parchedness in things, which I could long to see removed. But not being able I learn to respect though I love not and practice not their prudences and I wish you were the same&#x2014; Again I say look for the little good there is in them, though <pb id="pg-02-65" n="02:65"/>only the grain of corn in the bushel of chaff, look it out, talk of it and respect it, and respect him who has it<supplied>[.]</supplied> [The rest of the letter is missing.]</p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I have seldom perused so small a piece of paper with so much pleasure, as I received from your affectionate and <foreign><hi rend="italic">canty</hi></foreign> [cheerful] epistle which I found enclosed within Sandy&#x2019;s to-day.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >This seems to be a reference to Alexander Carlyle&#x2019;s letter dated <date when="1822-03-17">17 March (Sunday)</date>; the date of Carlyle&#x2019;s letter, written the following Wednesday, must therefore be <date when="1822-03-20">20 March</date>.</note> I have taken a sheet of considerable dimensions, with the purpose of filling it to the very brim, by way of answer to your kind and anxious interrogatories. The dinner is done; and I have still an hour and a half before me.</p>
<p>To begin with the most important topic, that of health, I am happy to be able to quiet your cares on this head. My outward frame is very much improved in strength since I saw you; and tho&#x2019; still at a goodly distance from the point of perfection, yet as it is pretty constantly in the way of progress thither, I ought to be and am contented with it on the whole. The value of health is a thing often talked of, but without any definite meaning, except in the minds of such as know the want of it. I could not have believed till last year that it was in the power of mere physical pain to render a man so thoroughly miserable and weak-minded. Thank heaven! the case is mended now: I can look back on that sorrowful period with feelings of gratitude for the favourable change in my circumstances; and perhaps the occur<supplied>[r]</supplied>ence of such a doleful scene in one&#x2019;s history is not without important uses. It ought at least to make one satisfied with almost <hi rend="italic">any</hi> lot, into which soundness of body and peace of conscience enter as ingredients.&#x2014; This wicked stomach of mine is not yet reconciled to its destiny: it keeps up an almost constant supply of uneasiness less or more; and will not work at all without drugs: but that horrible nervousness is about entirely gone; I can listen to little noises, and even want a night&#x2019;s sleep without much inconvenience. In proccess of time&#x2014;for youth is still on my side&#x2014;I expect to be altogether whole. I have already made no small progress: last year the scratching of a mouse in <pb id="pg-02-66" n="02:66"/>my chamber would in sober truth have given me more torture than smashing me with a cudgel would give me now.</p>
<p>My employments go on smoothly. The Bullers are on the whole very superior boys: if I were constantly beside them, I apprehend they might be made a good concern. I do not go near them on Sabbath-days, sometimes not even on Saturdays.

Andrew and I had some conversation; but we admired each other not immensely. He invited me cordially to go back, however; perhaps I may venture again, for I reckon him a good tho&#x2019; somewhat nearsighted man. Gordon I am invited to see also if I like.</p>
<p>Edw<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Irving and Will<hi rend="italic">m</hi> Graham left me about the time Johnstone came home. The excellent Graham having taken my stomach-disorders into his most serious consideration, slipped out one night, and bespoke a magnificent coffee-pot with a solid supply of best St Domingo, and to my no small surprise produced the whole apparatus next morning at breakfast. Tea he said was enough to murder a Turk; good brown was the stuff for a man. Whereupon he proceeded to instruct me in the mystery of coffee-making; how I was to lay a good <foreign><hi rend="italic">hummock-full</hi></foreign> of the ground material upon a drainer which extends across the top of the pot; then to clap a sort of additional tin-cann above this; and forthwith to fill it with boiling water, which oozes thro&#x2019; the drainer, and in about ten minutes makes you the most royal coffee in the world. Poor Mrs Wilkie gets me a pennyworth of cream every morning, and I breakfast on this rare beverage. I often wish you were beside me to get a draught of it, &#x26; give me your cheerful, frolick, motherly conversation along with it.&#x2014; In the evening, I usually take tea with the Boys at Dr Flemings, our lessons being hardly done, at that time. The old Doctor and I have very pretty little chit-chats about many things. He is a fine old man, very kindly in his sentiments, and <pb id="pg-02-67" n="02:67"/>with manners as smooth as silk. It is <supplied>[with]</supplied> the aid of these manners rather than of his respectable talen<supplied>[ts]</supplied> that he has slowly risen from being the son of an innkeeper in the edge <supplied>[of]</supplied> Perthshire, gradually to be a minister in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>. His wife is as good an old matron as you would wish to see; scarcely ever speaks, but with the intent of promoting some one&#x2019;s comfort.&#x2014; Before nine o&#x2019;clock, I have generally returned home, to read or write or do what I will. The walking to and from&#x2014;up at 10&#xBD; down about 1 o&#x2019;clock, and again up about half past six&#x2014;gives me exercise enough: and I have still considerable time at my own disposal. Soon we are thinking to change the first hour of meeting into 8 in the morning, and have the whole matter over at an earlier part of the day. I am anxious about this: for I begin to feel more and more the necessity of setting seriously about <hi rend="italic">writing a book</hi>. In general I am quite unhappy on this score: but I hope I shall at last fix on something, and then set to it like fire to tow.</p>
<p>Thus, my dear Mother, have I sketched out to you a picture of my customary life, with a minuteness, which I know will not be tedious to you, and which as addressed to a mother has given no little pleasure to myself. It is pity that you cannot write me as fully in return; but I live in hope of seeing you face to face sometime ere winter, and talking over every thing as formerly. In the mean time, if there is any thing that I can do for you, it will be a real kindness to let me know it. Tell me truly, do you get tea and other things as you wish? I am not afraid of poverty for a long time now: and I do not think there is a more <hi rend="italic">luxurious</hi> way of spending money, than in making those we love comfortable with it. I do not want any shirts or such things at present: but if I go into this Family, I will let you know in time. I have now filled my sheet up to the brim as I promised: <closer><salute>I therefore take my leave with every good wish for one whose happiness is so valuable to me; being always, My dear Mother, Your affectionate son,</salute></closer> <name>Thomas Carlyle</name></p>

</bibl><sourceNote>TC-WG, [<date when="1822-03-23">23 March</date>]. Addr: Glasgow. MS: David L. Graham. Pbd: Graham, <hi rend="italic">CG</hi>, pp. 32&#x2013;36. Text: Graham, <hi rend="italic">CG</hi>, and a transcript of the MS. A reply to Graham&#x2019;s letter of <date when="1822-03-20">20 March</date>. Graham had written: &#x201C;I enclose you a receipt for your complaint of pain in your stomach. &#x2026; And now for the history of this elixir. James Buchanan of this City, son-in-law of Lord Caithness, had been for years troubled with this same complaint, and went to London to consult Dr. Baillie, who gave him this said prescription, which in a very short time cured him completely. Also Mr. Mather, a friend of mine here, was cured of the same complaint lately. I had a long conversation with him today; he felt precisely as you do, and says that three bottles cured him. Also John Dempster, another of my acquaintances, was lately cured by drinking two bottles; and lastly, Josiah Macgregor, whom I am also intimate with, is now in the progress <supplied>[process?]</supplied> of cure. He tells me he has only taken one bottle, and says he is almost well, and will take another or more if necessary.&#x2014; Now, my dear Sir, I beg you will give it a fair trial, and thereby give me a fair chance for a diploma. Do you recollect what I said about that matter when with you? My prescription then was, beafsteak and port wine, and I still recommend them as well as this elixir. &#x2026; &#x201C;I have been in very bad spirits since yesterday, having had accounts of our affairs in America. They turn out greatly worse than I had ever dreamt of. I am really in the horrors; it is terrible.&#x201D;

<salute>My dear Friend,</salute>
<p>I have just swallowed two cups of indifferent tea, &#x26; seated myself here &#x201C;in the visitation of the winds&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">II Henry IV</hi>, III, i.</note> which are howling without very potently but cannot reach me, with full purpose of scribbling this whole sheet before I give you any quarter. That &#x201C;account of the unfortunate young man Faust&#x201D; (as the hawkers have it) did not reach me until this morning; so I could not send it sooner: and the delay which has occurred enables me, along with this, to dispatch another piece of duty no less binding&#x2014;the duty of thanking your Leech-ship for the truly paternal care you exercise over all, even my most personal interests, and which you have manifested again only two days ago by sending me Dr. Baillie&#x2019;s<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. Matthew Baillie. See <ref target="volume-02/lt-18220725-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1822-07-25">25 July</date></ref>. See also Graham, <hi rend="italic">CG</hi>, p. 31.</note> celebrated elixir for the use of my most afflicted inner man. I do indeed thank you: it is kind in you to take any thought of so ungrateful a matter as my health, from which no earthly enjoyment can result to your feelings except the &#x201C;luxury of doing good&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Goldsmith, &#x201C;The Traveller,&#x201D; l. 22. Irving had used the expression in his letter to Carlyle of <date when="1821-07-24">24 July 1821</date>.</note>&#x2014;a luxury which requires no sumptuary law to act against it, I believe, being little practised even in this luxurious age. If your potion cure me, I will give you the credit of having removed more human wretchedness by a single act than you ever did in your <pb id="pg-02-69" n="02:69"/>life before. The Apothecary has done his part to give us all a fair chance: and I shall certainly drink three bottles before I despair. The liquor is pleasant to the taste and it brings kind warm thoughts into my heart every time I taste it: so that it will not be altogether thrown away, whatever be the issue. I confess my faith is small: however, I shall persevere, without faltering, to the end of three bottles.</p>
<p>The afternoon when you left me I returned home in a very melancholic humour, reflecting on all the shattered wrecks of fooling which compose so much of our history, and disposed enough to break forth into a <foreign><hi rend="italic">coronach</hi></foreign> over the shortlivedness of earthly enjoyments. I threw myself down on that old loom of a sofa, and closing my eyes endeavoured to picture forth the actual state of those friends with whom a little while ago I had been so happy, and who had now all darted off into their several spheres, leaving me as before to gyrate in my own cold orbit&#x2014;alone, or with stars only of malignant influence. There was no profit in this: so I arose, and took bread; and began to read Thucydides, and to prepare for teaching, and the several other prosaic services allotted to me. In two days I had fallen into my usual train; and have lived since in that way, enjoying as fair a mixture of cloud and sunshine as could be expected&#x2014;or is perhaps desirable in my present circumstances.</p>
<p>Would it were so too with you! But I fear the news from America has damped you too much. Surely there is something exceedingly disheartening in the reiterated disappointment you experience of your most rational hopes. I know not how the matter stands; nor is there need: I could but sympathize with your sufferings, which you already know I do from the heart; or propound to you some cold topic of consolation, which you can practise even better than I can prescribe. My only watchword, therefore, is: Be of Courage! There are souls that feel for you a respect only deepened by each successive difficulty you surmount, and who rest assured that days are coming when all your distresses will exist but in memory, and serve but to add a more touching relish to the calm which must ultimately succeed. What honest man of a firm heart ever sank to rise no more? Not one,&#x2014;if he stood by his integrity: therefore I again say <hi rend="italic">Be of courage</hi>! Both you and I are fighting with obstructions, which go nigh to overwhelm us sometimes: but they shall not; tho&#x2019; fainting we will fight: and <hi rend="italic"><foreign>Te Deum</foreign> must</hi> be the end of it, and will.</p>
<p>What a blessed thing is Hope! How it shines like a clear star when all the universe but itself seems wrapped in Cimmerian darkness,&#x2014;shedding a pure bright ray over the wild black waters which it is <pb id="pg-02-70" n="02:70"/>man&#x2019;s fortune so often to navigate! Never leave it out of sight, my friend! It points to fairer weather: and remember your own brave saying, <hi rend="italic">the darkest hour of night is nearest to the dawn</hi>.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Proverbial.</note> We shall find it so I never doubt.</p>
<p>There is a portion of sorrow tempered by a portion of joy peculiar to the fate of every man; and no one can say with safety, my own share of either is greater than another&#x2019;s. I often <hi rend="italic">imagine</hi> that it must be very hard measure with which things are meted to myself; but I <hi rend="italic">know</hi> that I am wrong in thinking so. True I should be happier and more useful if I were healthy; but so should I be if I had the genius of Milton or could fly like an angel; and man was not born to be <foreign><hi rend="italic">boss</hi></foreign>,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hollow and stupid.</note> any more than to have wings. I reflect too that it does no good at all to sit speculating on our fortunes; it is better far to use and gird up our loins and see what can be done to mend it. Therefore I am vexing myself as little as may be about many things that press on me, but harassing myself only the more about some undertakings which appear to be of vital importance, tho&#x2019; of very dubious issue. &#x201C;In spite of nature and my stars,&#x201D;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Hudibras</hi>, I, i, 647.</note> I am going to <hi rend="italic">write a book</hi>; and I can find no subject to write upon; and thus I fret and worry from morning to night, starting fifty projects and rejecting them all as soon as started, and finding no rest for the sole of my foot till I have come to some determination, where alas! I have no fit data for determining. Unless your elixir and the fresh air and constant exercise fail to keep out the foul fiend Indigestion&#x2014;which would certainly indeed concentrate all my attention elsewhere than to literature&#x2014;I give you some hope to calculate on receiving from me, before this time, twelve-month, a reasonable volume by the hand of an Annandale man, which may eclipse the less happy of Andrew <hi rend="italic">Muckle</hi> May&#x2019;s effusions<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Perhaps a fanciful reference to Andrew Meikle (<date when="1719-00-00">1719</date>&#x2013;<date when="1811-00-00">1811</date>), of Dunbar, Haddingtonshire, millwright and inventor of the threshing machine. There was much controversy in print concerning the inventor&#x2019;s indebtedness to other trial models.</note> or even rival &#x201C;Henderson on Swine&#x201D;<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Henderson, <hi rend="italic">Treatise on the Breeding of Swine</hi> (Leith, <date when="1811-00-00">1811</date>). Carlyle implies that Henderson is from the same part of Scotland.</note>&#x2014;the works by which that refined vale is at present chiefly distinguished in the world of letters. I do actually meditate this; so you may look to it&#x2014;</p>
<p>But alas! my sheet is done; and how have I wasted it! Not one thing put down as it should have been, and many down which had no right to be there at all. There is no remedy but Patience (<hi rend="italic">Geduld</hi> <pb id="pg-02-71" n="02:71"/>as our friend Faust says): I must write to you again very soon, and try to get thro&#x2019; somewhat better. You will send me news of yourself the very earliest hour you can spare. Never be discouraged, come what will. I venture to bet any reasonable thing that before my book is out, you will be not only under way, but sailing with swol&#x2019;n canvass thro&#x2019; the rich sounds of merchandise as bravely as ever you have done. Will you take me? <closer><salute>I am sure to win: And winning or losing to remain always,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My Dear Sir:</salute>
<p>I received your kind letter in due time; and should have acknowledged that mark of your attention long ago, had I not been excused in my own eyes by the expectation you held out to me of an opportunity to acknowledge it more agreeably by word of mouth, in your visit to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, which I then thought was near at hand. &#x201C;<date when="1822-02-00">February</date>&#x201D; is come and gone, and you have not shown face. I continue, however, to expect you: and by way of fortifying your purpose to beat up my quarters when you arrive, I am going to foist this sheet into a packet of Mr. Irving&#x2019;s, which I have already loaded with letters to him and Mr. Grahame, thus making it a messenger to nearly all of the very few friends I reckon as mine within the bounds of your extensive city.</p>
<p>Some account of your projected marriage had reached me while in Annandale: but I received your authentic detail of the business<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >David Hope had written Carlyle the details about his broken engagement to be married in his letter of <date when="1821-12-24">24 Dec. 1821</date>. The lady in question could not bear the thought of separation from her mother and sister.</note> with fresh interest&#x2014;not only as it explained a rather curious transaction, but as it afforded me a proof of your confidence, which I am very proud of thinking I possess in such a matter. Various thoughts strike me on considering that business; and certainly the most agreeable of them is the clear persuasion that you have acted with perfect integrity and honour&#x2014;nay, with even scrupulous attention to the interest of others, and an almost culpable neglect of your own, throughout the whole negotiation. As for the loss itself I am not sure that you have much cause for regret, when all is reckoned up. The young lady&#x2019;s <pb id="pg-02-72" n="02:72"/>conduct I can find an explanation if not an excuse for, and the evidence of testimony forces me to believe that her general demeanour displayed many graceful qualities. But she was a person of genius, if I mistake not: and much as I admire, not to say idolize, that characteristic in a mistress (or <hi rend="italic">sweetheart</hi>, as we call it), I confess I should pause before recommending it to any honest man in a wife. These women of genius, sir, are the very d&#x2014;&#x2014;l, when you take them on a wrong tack. I know very well, that I myself&#x2014;if ever I marry, which seems possible at best&#x2014;am to have one of them for my helpmate; and I expect nothing but that our life will be the most turbulent, incongruous thing on earth&#x2014;a mixture of honey and wormwood, the sweetest and the bitterest&#x2014;or, as it were, at one time the clearest sunshiny weather in nature, then whirlwinds and sleet and frost; the thunder and lightning and furious storms&#x2014;all mingled together into the same season&#x2014;and the sunshine always in the <hi rend="italic">smallest</hi> quantity! Judge how you would have relished this: and sing with a cheerful heart, <foreign><hi rend="italic">E&#x2019;en let the bonny lass gang</hi>!</foreign><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Burns, &#x201C;She&#x2019;s fair and <foreign>fause</foreign> that causes my smart,&#x201D; st. 1. Does Carlyle have Jane Welsh in mind as he writes prophetically about the woman of genius he is to marry?</note></p>
<p>Before long I trust to see you more happily mated than you could have been in this instance. There is no happiness, properly speaking, I am told, without a good wife: so I counsel you to bestir yourself while it is in season. I prophesy that you will make an excellent husband to any lady worthy of you; and I doubt not in due time to have the happiness of seeing your hospitable fireside enlivened and adorned as I and all your friends could wish. You know the old story of the scissors: a <hi rend="italic">single</hi> blade of them is good for nothing but scraping a trencher or so; together they clip everything before them, from cambric up to white iron. What a lesson to bachelors and spinsters!</p>
<p>I designed to give you a full picture of all my doings here; but not having room or time now, I must refer you to our friends Irving and Grahame, either of whom will give you ample satisfaction on every point.</p>
<p>They will tell you how I am partly in the prospect of entering as tutor into an English family against August; how I am writing sometimes, often meditating to write, and not unfrequently on the verge of being sent to pot entirely, by the <hi rend="italic">worst of stomachs</hi>.</p>
<p>I had likewise some news in store for you, but not of importance enough that you should regret the want of them. In our native Annandale there is nothing but embarrassment. The farmers all are poverty-struck <pb id="pg-02-73" n="02:73"/>to a man; so are all that depend on them, of course. A striking proof of their necessity in Hoddam parish is the fact that even Sharpe<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Gen. Matthew Sharpe, the landlord of Carlyle&#x2019;s father.</note> has at last consented to a reduction. Irving, as you know, was here preaching lately. Nothing since the days of Knox or the Erskines <note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ebenezer Erskine (<date when="1680-00-00">1680</date>&#x2013;<date when="1754-00-00">1754</date>) and Ralph Erskine (<date when="1685-00-00">1685</date>&#x2013;<date when="1752-00-00">1752</date>), Scottish clergymen who were leaders of the Burgher faction within the Secessionist group.</note> has excited so much speculation in the theological world as his appearance here. They think him the cleverest and strangest person they have ever fallen in with. The talk has been interrupted a little by a ridiculous prediction, imputed to Professor Leslie, that horrible convulsions were to occur in the atmosphere last Friday&#x2014;none of which occurred&#x2014;but it is not exhausted yet. He was touching on the Catechisms: I could fancy the <hi rend="italic">Closehead</hi> folks,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The old Ecclefechan meeting-place was at the head of the Blue Bell Close. The new one which by now had replaced it was also in a close. Clearly Carlyle seems to refer to the Burgher community of Ecclefechan.</note> if he had read that sermon to them, all rising as one man to cast him forth of the Tabernacle, or at least withdrawing <foreign><hi rend="italic">en masse</hi></foreign>, with the most wintry air imaginable, and leaving him to utter his &#x201C;heresies&#x201D; to empty benches and bare walls. At Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> they proceeded more moderately: some admired, several did not, most knew not what to think. I have not listened to a sermon displaying equal mind in my whole life.</p>
<p>But you see, my dear sir, that I must now &#x201C;cease to darken counsel by words without wisdom.&#x201D;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Job 38:2: &#x201C;Who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge?&#x201D;</note> I have spent an hour very merrily in chatting with you, and shall go to sleep no worse for it. I expect to spend several hours with you still more agreeably, when you come Eastward: and failing this, I have a kind of half intention of visiting Glasgow about the beginning of <date when="1822-05-00">May</date>; when&#x2014;woe to your oranges! Woe to the quiet of your house!&#x2014;unless I relent and stay at home.&#x2014; <closer><salute>Excuse all this <foreign><hi rend="italic">palabra</hi></foreign>, and believe me to be (my dear sir)</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Jack,</salute>
<p>If you were at Mainhill last Saturday, you would find a letter for you in the box which arrived from Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, and various additional letters <pb id="pg-02-74" n="02:74"/>addressed to others would be communicated to you; so that you cannot fail to be almost satiated for a time with descriptions of my walk and conversation here. Accordingly I have not taken up the pen tonight for the purpose of enlarging much farther on that topic: but on a small affair of business which I request you to consider and send me your deliverance upon as soon as possible. It concerns myself; and involves a petition, which I am sure you will be happy to grant me if you can.</p>
<p>Owing to various calls of expenditure and various stoppages of income, it has so fallen out that I am at present rather imperfectly provided with that first of necessaries, ready money: and as I have a considerable reluctance to dun any of my creditors or to be indebted to this my landlady, I have bethought me that if Biggar has paid your salary, as he was bound, you may be able to furnish me with a <foreign><hi rend="italic">fi&#x2019;pun</hi></foreign> [underscored twice] or ten-pound note for a month or two. If so, I will desire you to cut a fit space out of the corner of a sheet of paper, to insert the said note therein, filling the other vacant space with intelligence from yourself, and transmit the whole to me without delay. This request will come to you on Thursday Morning: if you can be ready before the Post hour on Friday, I shall get the whole on Saturday-night, and be very much obliged by it.</p>
<p>But observe, My good Jack, if you have not the cash about you, take no thought of this matter; conceive that I have supplied myself else-where, and write to me without minding any thing about it. The truth is it is only very culpable negligence, and a kind of false pride that puts me on asking it from you at all. I neglected, even partly refused to take payment of four guineas from a Mrs M&#x2019;Kenzie in whose family, I had been teaching during the early part of winter: and last Saturday when I called to present my account, I found the Lady had gone to London, and was not to be home, for an unknown period. This somewhat deranged my calculations; and might teach me that a bird in the hand is better than <hi rend="italic">one</hi> in the bush. It served very little, however, to give me any relish for asking cash; and therefore I did not yet trouble the Bibliopolist Waugh for between twenty &#x26; thirty pounds that he owes me,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For articles published in the <hi rend="italic">New Edinburgh Review</hi>.</note> or Brewster for a considerable sum which he will owe me very soon.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The article on Pascal was written during this spring for Brewster&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Encyclopaedia</hi>.</note> But if you have not the money lying ready in your drawer; fear not that I will make the Baillie table his <foreign><hi rend="italic">clinquant</hi></foreign> [shiny coins]&#x2014;and &#x201C;touch&#x201D; it for my own behoof without delay. In <pb id="pg-02-75" n="02:75"/>truth he has used me but scurvily in the matter, and I design to make him deliver any way very soon. And now I think of it&#x2014;you had better write on Thursday&#x2014;if possible&#x2014;that I may have time to ask him, before Saturday-night (which is my Account-night) in case of failure. You can write on Thursday&#x2014;if you are not very busy&#x2014;and merely say (if that be it) that your purse is not so full as necessary.</p>
<p>I confess, My dear Jack, I have some pleasure in making this request, because I know thou wilt have pleasure in complying with it, if thy means permit. I like to think of brothers obliging and being obliged to each other&#x2014;in both of which circumstances, I hope thou &#x26; I shall often be mutually in future.</p>
<p>Surely this pen has a peculiar faculty of filling up room! It is only a few minutes since I began this sheet; and it is already all but done. The subject is the most prosaic of subjects: but we must just submit. &#x201C;Another time,&#x201D; as the Great Frederick said, when he was beaten at Prague&#x2014;&#x201C;another time, we will do better.&#x201D; Meanwhile let me ask how go your studies and labours on with you? Your Greek? (be steady in this)&#x2014; Your Horace? Your West?<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See JAC to TC, <date when="1822-01-18">18 Jan.</date>: &#x201C;I am getting into the spirit of Wests Conic sections.&#x201D; The book may be John West, <hi rend="italic">Elements of Mathematics</hi> (<date when="1784-00-00">1784</date>). See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18160419-TC-RM-01">TC to RM, <date when="1816-04-19">19 April 1816</date></ref>.</note> And how does your heart support the toil and isolation of a life in Annan? Be of good Courage my brave Tongleg: the day of deliverance is drawing nigh. You will get employment here, and large admission to the wells of knowledge: if your health keep firm (of which I conjure you with all the solemnity in my power to be careful), there is not a shadow of danger, that with your habits of patient perseverance, and the talents which Providence has given you, abundant success will attend all your modest and praiseworthy enterprises. Never faulter, tho&#x2019; your path lie thro&#x2019; regions of dust and nakedness and solitude: have your eyes fixed on the golden summit of literary eminence to which you are yet destined to rise; and what may you not endure? I myself have crossed those desarts in which you are now sojourning&#x2014;and been sorely maimed in crossing them: draw largely upon what experience I have amassed, and without stint upon the sympathy which your qualities and your kindness to me so well merit at my hands. Write me all&#x2014;all. Never mind the Carriers; take the Post, whenever you have a vacant hour: there is not a letter that I receive, which gives me more pleasure than one of yours. You have written well this winter&#x2014;better than my expectations&#x2014;tho&#x2019; worse than my wishes. Fall not off from this beginning. Write me <pb id="pg-02-76" n="02:76"/>often and largely&#x2014;never minding what you say or how you say it: every such letter does good to both of us.</p>
<p>I am pretty well myself &#x201C;<foreign>i&#x2019; the health part o&#x2019;t</foreign>&#x201D;; Grahame has sent me an elixir from Glasgow, which I am drinking daily, and find rather beneficial.

<salute>My dear Mitchell,</salute>
<p>I recollect quite distinctly, and have often recollected, that when we parted last in Annandale, I partly promised to write to you about <pb id="pg-02-77" n="02:77"/>New-Year&#x2019;s-day; and certainly it is clear that without adhering to the O.S.&#x2014;a calendar exploded half a century ago<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Old Style Julian calendar had been abandoned and the New Style Gregorian calendar adopted in Great Britain in <date when="1752-00-00">1752</date>. Pope Gregory had ordered the reform in <date when="1582-00-00">1582</date>.</note>&#x2014;I cannot avoid the mortifying admission that my partial promise, has not been even partially fulfilled. This is an old evil, as you will know; I fear it is almost becoming irremediable now: therefore we shall not dwell upon it; but rather trust to our mutual good nature, a very convenient fund for securing a pardon of all such little peccadilloes; which should not interrupt the course of good fellowship, being in fact quite inseparably attached to all the operations of mortal men, in this their degenerate condition of existence. It is a great truth, which Gibbon sets forth somewhere, that letters are like alms, in one respect; symbols of friendship as alms are of charity; tho&#x2019; it is well known that the thing signified may exist in great activity, without the symbol, in both cases. At all events, I hope you need no persuasion, that I feel great pleasure always in writing to you; not only as to a man whose talents and principles I respect, but also as to one, with whom some of the most picturesque years of my life are inseparably connected in memory, whose name recalls to me a thousand images of the past a thousand passages and half-forgotten moods of mind, which were not without a degree of pleasure while present, and which distance is every day rendering dearer, and covering with a softer and purer colour. How many sheets have I scrawled to you, how many consultations and merry-makings and loungings have we had together? How many sage purposes and speculations have we formed by each other&#x2019;s counsel,&#x2014;how contentedly, tho&#x2019; neither of us knew the right hand from the left! I declare I shall always think of those things with a certain melancholy pleasure; and keep anticipating the nights when we (old grey-heads covered with honour as with years) shall yet sit by each other&#x2019;s hearth, and recount these achievements, and forget, in recollecting them, all the weakness and the weariness and cares and coldness of age.&#x2014; <foreign><hi rend="italic">&#x201C;Chateauxen Espagne!&#x201D;</hi></foreign> [&#x201C;Castles in Spain&#x201D;] you say: no matter, they look very hospitable; and one loves to gaze upon them.</p>
<p>But to remove from Spain to Galloway&#x2014;from the futilious and splendid to the useful and the real&#x2014; How does the world shew in your new position at Kirkcudbright? I hope and have some reason to believe that every thing is within reasonable limits of your wish: but I naturally long for more specific assurance on the subject. At present I can picture out on the <hi rend="italic">retina</hi> of the mind the whole paraphernalia of <pb id="pg-02-78" n="02:78"/>your establishment; the solid red sandstone <foreign><hi rend="italic">pedagogium</hi></foreign> with its unpretending margin of play-ground now becoming green and cheerful; the noisy population, the constant labour, all the pleasures all the disquietudes within; the snug evening party of worthy burghers and sons &#x26; daughters of burghers, at which you are occasionally to be seen, relaxing your overwrought and active mind; the habitual studies which more frequently serve to occupy or tire you; all this I can body forth in the imagination, but I desire not the less to have a true delineation of it, and how it affects you. Nay if you will not describe it pointedly, there is some danger lest I make an invasion on your premises in process of time; being naturally of a wandering disposition, and by no means disinclined to repeat my visit to <hi rend="italic">the</hi> Shire. One thing I am sure of and congratulate you upon: it is the advantage you possess over me, in having a fixed object in life, a kind of chart of the course you are to follow, and the opportunity not only of enjoying all the pleasures which this affords in the mean time, but likewise of increasing your experience and thus at once by the power of habit &#x26; of new skill in discharging your duties&#x2014;increasing and accumulating more and more your means of happiness and usefulness. Here is an immense blessing in your lot; I advise you (for too good reasons) to beware of letting it go. None but a wandering restless pilgrim, who has travelled long and advanced little, anxious to proceed on his destined journey, but perpetually missing or changing his path&#x2014;can tell you how fine a thing it is to have a beaten turnpike for your accom<supplied>[m]</supplied>odation. Better to keep it, almost however miry or rugged, than to spring the hedge, and so loose yourself among footpaths&#x2014;<foreign><hi rend="italic">thaas koind o&#x2019; foot-pads</hi></foreign> [<hi rend="italic">pads</hi> underscored twice]!</p>
<p>You perceive I am here sketching a feeble emblem of my own walk and conversation. I am not in the whining mood, however. Still there is hope of my getting thro&#x2019; the wilderness, and reaching the promised la<supplied>[nd]</supplied>, tho&#x2019; doubtless if <hi rend="italic">this</hi> be Pisgah, the weather must be dim, and clouds are over the country. To speak without metaphor&#x2014;I am now in much better heart than I was when we saw each other last. My health is far superior; and tho&#x2019; I am yet far enough from having to complain of that <hi rend="italic">excess</hi> in wellbeing which used so much to incommode the great Cardan<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jerome Cardan, or Girolamo Cardano (<date when="1501-00-00">1501</date>&#x2013;<date when="1576-00-00">76</date>), Italian physician, mathematician, astrologer, who was summoned to Scotland where he cured the Archbishop of St. Andrews in <date when="1552-00-00">1552</date> and who wrote <hi rend="italic">De Propria Vita</hi> (<date when="1576-00-00">1576</date>).</note> in his studies; my nerves are in the way of improvement, and I entertain a kind of expectation of being at length delivered from that first and greatest that sum total of all worldly <pb id="pg-02-79" n="02:79"/>tortures, the torture of <hi rend="italic">dyspepsia</hi>. I admire no man for enduring the rack or the wheel for smiling at oppression and the threats of pain and ruin: let him try a course of that genial liquid, <hi rend="italic">bile</hi>; and see if he can keep his temper. My own private idea is, that, not even Satan, the prince of Stoics, could bear it without wincing. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Sed hactenus haec</hi></foreign> [But enough of this].<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Horace, <hi rend="italic">Satires</hi>, I, iv, 63.</note> I am thinking to give up the &#x201C;fugitive&#x201D; mode of Authorship, and become a writer in earnest&#x2014;if I can manage it. There is a kind of Family-tutorship, which I have in prospect, and am engaged with till August at all events, that promises to afford me the means of thinking and composing with less distraction than I have long had within my reach. The people are not come from London yet (where Edw<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Irving introduced my name to them); and the whole matter is uncertain till then; but the boys (at present boarded in Dr Flemings and taught by me) are very fine creatures; and the terms they propose are liberal&#x2014;&#xa3;200 a-year, with superior accom<supplied>[m]</supplied>odation. I have small relish for tutorships: and so have not staked any considerable portion of my prospects upon this chance; but I think it may be ultimately advantageous&#x2014;if suitable; and in the mean-time I study to be prepared for <hi rend="italic">either</hi> issue. I have literary projects; but they are still in embryo.</p>
<p>Thus, my dear Mitchell, have I filled you a sheet with various stuff, relating to myself and you; heedless of the lapse of hours tho&#x2019; the clock has warned me twice since I began&#x2014;the last being the briefest of warnings&#x2014;that of the &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">wee short hour ayont the twal</hi>&#x2019;</foreign>.&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Burns, &#x201C;Death and Doctor Hornbook,&#x201D; st. 31. <hi rend="italic">Ayont</hi> means <hi rend="italic">after</hi>; Carlyle means 1 <hi rend="small-caps">a.m.</hi></note> I beg you to answer me when you can snatch a minute. <closer><salute>For the present I bid you <foreign>adieu</foreign>&#x2014;being always,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Jack,</salute>
<p>I this day fell in with your provost&#x2014;R. Dickson;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Dickson, who had married Edward Irving&#x2019;s sister, was provost of the town of Annan. Carlyle was often a welcome guest in his home. See J. M. Sloan, <hi rend="italic">The Carlyle Country</hi> (<date when="1904-00-00">1904</date>), pp. 191&#x2013;92.</note> and having learned that he designs returning to Annan on Tuesday morning, I <pb id="pg-02-80" n="02:80"/>gladly profit by the opportunity of scribbling a line or two for you, without causing any cost to either of us. I have the worst pen in Nature, as you see; but never mind. I am very stupid too&#x2014;but also, never mind.</p>
<p>Your letter<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JAC to TC, <date when="1822-03-27">27 March</date>.</note> with the inclosed five pounds came to me in due time: I was much pleased with your punctuality&#x2014;tho&#x2019; just what I expected. When you want the money again, let me know. I calculate that I have now as much as will serve me till the Bullers come, when I shall get more; and I beg you will not be in any strait without applying to me&#x2014;not only for your own (if I should be so negligent as to need being applied to)&#x2014;but for any sum within the extent of my resources.&#x2014; Waugh the bookseller I caused pay me; and he has done it like a scurvy person&#x2014;with fifteen pounds, where there should have been fiveand twenty. &#x201C;The Review has so limited a sale; the&#x201D; &#x26;c &#x26;c&#x2014; I design writing no more for him, unless driven to it by a necessity harder than I like to anticipate. Yet I give him no rude words&#x2014;both because rude words generally degrade the person who employs them as much as the person who endures them, and because not knowing what may turn out in the future, I consider that &#x201C;better a wee bush than nae bield&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Better a small bush than no shelter at all.&#x201D;</note> and even Waugh&#x2019;s Review may be of use to me. At any rate I doubt not the &#x201C;limited sale&#x201D; is a very sufficient excuse for his parsimony. My own wonder is that there exists any &#x201C;sale&#x201D; at all. If it were not that Providence is a rich provider&#x2014;furnishing nourishment for all the animated tribes of the universe, one could not <foreign><hi rend="italic">a priori</hi></foreign> expect a single purchaser far less a reader for this literary mooncalf. Peace be with it! and with all the <foreign><hi rend="italic">hashes</hi></foreign> [blockheads] that contribute to create it! They have each a right to a certain portion of the beef slaughtered within this city, and to a certain portion of the oxygen gas that floats around it: far be it from me to wish their privileges curtailed.</p>
<p>The translation of Legendre puzzles me a little. I had finished about four or five sheets of it long ago; but the people are getting clamorous for it now, and I not only find no kind of pleasure in the task, but cannot even perform it at all without sacrificing considerable prospects of a far more alluring kind. I have thoughts of giving it up in favour of John Waugh. Could you do it, Jack? Have you time &#x26; spirit for it, I mean? If you think so&#x2014;I wish you would try a portion and let me see; the beginning of the fifth book, for example: write it <pb id="pg-02-81" n="02:81"/>out in a legible hand (no matter how ugly) and send it up by the first opportunity. This idea struck me about a minute ago: consider of it seriousl<supplied>[.]</supplied> If the work did not too much destroy your time, it would pay very well, and such things do not always occur when one wants them. I am confident, I could make you do it well if I had you here. Say what you think of it&#x2014;if you think any thing.</p>
<p>I am anxious to get all these mechanical things off my hand; so that I may be able to embark fairly in some more honourable enterprise. I have had a faint purpose for some weeks of writing some &#x201C;Essay on the genius &#x26; character of Milton&#x201D;&#x2014;if I could. It is not quite the subject I should like, but better than none; so I am still thinking of it, and determined at least to read the works that relate to it. I am already through &#x201C;Clarendon&#x2019;s history of the Rebellion&#x201D;;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18210424-TC-WG-01">TC to WG, <date when="1821-04-24">24 April 1821</date></ref>.</note> tomorrow I shall try to get hold of &#x201C;Ludlow&#x2019;s Memoirs&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edmund Ludlow (<date when="1617-00-00">1617</date>?&#x2013;<date when="1692-00-00">92</date>), <hi rend="italic">Memoirs</hi>, 3 vols. (Vivay, <date when="1698-00-00">1698</date>&#x2013;<date when="1699-00-00">99</date>).</note> or some other of them. My condition is rather strange at present: I feel as if I were impelled to write&#x2014;as if I had also a very little power to do it; but at the same time as if I had altogether lost the faculty of exerting that power! It is &#x201C;<foreign>thaas coorsed nervous disaarders</foreign>.&#x201D;&#x2014;thrice and four times <foreign><hi rend="italic">coorsed</hi></foreign>. <hi rend="italic">If</hi> [underscored twice] I had strong health&#x2014;!!&#x2014; But what is the use of talking? <hi rend="italic">If</hi> [underscored twice] I had a supereminent genius, the end would be still better attained; and the wish is perhaps just about as reasonable. Should I never be healthy again&#x2014;which seems possible enough&#x2014;it will not aid me to complain, to sit and long vehemently&#x2014;and &#x201C;whine, put finger i&#x2019; the eye and sob,&#x201D;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18210324-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1821-03-24">24 March 1821</date></ref>.</note> because my longings are not gratified.

Alas! My poor Jack, I am <foreign><hi rend="italic">wae</hi></foreign> when I think of all this. But it cannot be helped.</p>
<p>It is time for me however to quit those airy speculations. I want a long letter from you, as soon as possible&#x2014;including all your experiences, <supplied>[all]</supplied> your hopes. Send me large batches of news; let every thing be fish that <supplied>[comes]</supplied> within your net.

Tell Johnston that I desire greatly to hear from him. Can you tell me any tidings of Geo: Johnston the Doctor?

He means to graduate, <hi rend="italic">if</hi> he can find funds. There is no man in the world so unfortunate &#x26; fatuous as Waugh, with so little criminality. He seems as if he were becoming crazed at times, he speculates so absurdly on the ways of this Earth. Tell no one of him: it only sets silly tongues o&#x2019;wagging; and Waugh is too worthy for such.</p>
<p>I am going to inclose the critique on Faust. You may shew it to Ben, if he cares for it; and then let them have it at home. I hope you go often up to Mainhill&#x2014;and take little nic-nacs with you sometimes to our invaluable mother. Carry my love to her and our worthy father, and all the rest of them.

<salute>My dear Johnstone,</salute>
<p>I have an hour before my hand at present, and a free conveyance to Annan; which advantages tempt me to break in upon your quietude, tho&#x2019; I have not yet had the pleasure of getting any positive precept, much less an example, from yourself for doing so. I heard of your safe arrival in Annandale, and also of the melancholy state in which you would find the family at Bogside. It is natural for you to feel sorrow at the loss of one worthy friend,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On <date when="1822-03-20">20 March</date> William Graham wrote to Carlyle: &#x201C;Mr. Irving of Bogside is dead; he has left &#xa3;1200 to his widow,&#x2014;the remainder of his fortune, equally among his Nephews and Nieces.&#x201D; See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18190223-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1819-02-23">23 Feb. 1819</date></ref>.</note> and at the desolation into which that loss must have plunged another. I hope, however, that you do not find Bogside less a home than formerly, but that on the contrary your presence there is doubly acceptable in this time of trial. I desire you to present my affectionate condolences to Mrs Irving, and to express my hope that her loss is not unattended with some of those inward consolations, which in the end will make it &#x201C;great gain.&#x201D; George Irving was a true man; his modest part has been played honourably, and I trust he now inherits his reward.</p>
<p>Edward from Glasgow is here at this time. I was vexed to learn from him that no prospects open for you at Leeds<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Irving had urged Johnston to seek a teaching position in an English town and had offered to write to friends in Leeds on his behalf.</note>&#x2014;or elsewhere as we could have wished. He is very diligent, however, and anxious to serve you, and I have no doubt will ultimately succeed in serving you. The school in the neighbourhood of Dundee is not yet finally settled: Edward had a note on the subject to-day, and will hear farther when he returns to the West&#x2014;letting you know, of course, in due season. The director of it, Erskine, is a very worthy person, I understand&#x2014;author of a book on <hi rend="italic">the</hi> &#x201C;Evidences,&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Erskine, of Linlathen (<date when="1788-00-00">1788</date>&#x2013;<date when="1870-00-00">1870</date>), <hi rend="italic">Remarks on the Internal Evidence for the Truth of Revealed Religion</hi> (<date when="1820-00-00">1820</date>). Erskine and Carlyle later became friends.</note> which you may have seen. If nothing better turn up, I think you should embrace the offer; and should it even fail of becoming a definite proposal, I apprehend you have not the smallest cause to fear that some as eligible situation will not present itself very shortly. I entreat you not to despond of your prospects in Scotland: you have indeed laboured hard and to little <pb id="pg-02-84" n="02:84"/>purpose&#x2014;if weight of purse were the only thing to be looked at; but if you compare yourself with many who cut a better figure in the world, and set your knowledge against their finery&#x2014;you will find little reason to repine. There cannot be a doubt of your acquiring all you aim at, in due time. And let me again beg of you never to think of America any more: it would greive me to the very heart to think that a person of your worth and attainments should as it were banish himself from his &#x201C;fatherland,&#x201D; when so small a modicum of accommodation would make him content. You really must drop the idea entirely. You have some true friends here, and you have sympathies and recollections and tastes which cannot be gratified elsewhere. All that makes life desirable for you lies here: all that you hope for in America will undoubtedly be added if you lose not patience &#x26; perseverance.</p>
<p>My own history since you left Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> has undergone no change. I am still fighting with &#x0394;&#x03C5;&#x03C3;&#x03C0;&#x03B5;&#x03C8;&#x03B5;&#x03B9;&#x03B1;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle at first wrote &#x201C;&#x0394;&#x03C5;&#x03C3;&#x03C8;,&#x201D; and then crossed it out. For &#x201C;&#x0394;&#x03C5;&#x03C3;&#x03C0;&#x03B5;&#x03C8;&#x03B5;&#x03B9;&#x03B1;,&#x201D; more correctly read &#x0394;&#x03C5;&#x03C3;&#x03C0;&#x03B5;&#x03C8;&#x03AF;&#x03B1;</note> [dyspepsia]&#x2014;the most horrible of all beings real or allegorical&#x2014;compared with whom the three Furies are the meekest creatures in the world. If I were a Manichean, not an orthodox Presbyterian, I would personify the Evil principle under this shape, and erect temples to the goddess, ornamented with gall-bladders, pill-boxes, clyster-bags and all the paraphernalia of indigestion. There is nothing like it in Nature. I am also endeavouring to ferment some literary projects; but whether they are ever destined to be completely brewed seems rather doubtful. I have gone no farther than reading as yet. Something touching the period of the Commonwealth in England is my object: but the whole is still <foreign><hi rend="italic">rudis indigestaque moles</hi></foreign>.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A crude and undigested mass. Ovid, <hi rend="italic">Metamorphoses</hi>, I, 7.</note></p>
<p>I wrote to Mitchell the other day, tho&#x2019; when I shall get any answer, the Fates only know. Make my respects to him if you go to Galloway. Remember me also with much respect &#x26; gratitude to the kind family of Hitchill: it is possible I may been up their q<supplied>[uarter]</supplied>s on the banks of the &#x201C;black water o&#x2019;Dee&#x201D;&#x2014;in process of time. I <supplied>[know]</supplied> I ought in duty to have written a letter to Mr Duncan of Ruthwell ere this: you will tell him how it fares with me, and that I wish to hold a place in his remembrance.</p>
<p>Nothing is talked of here at present, but <hi rend="italic">the</hi> Duel, that in which Sir A. Boswell lost his life.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-02/lt-18220629-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1822-06-29">29 June</date></ref>.</note> People generally seem to think he merited his fate, tho&#x2019; it was severe. I hope with many others that it may prove <pb id="pg-02-85" n="02:85"/>a &#x201C;Beacon&#x201D;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Beacon</hi> was a Tory paper which had been replaced by the Glasgow <hi rend="italic">Sentinel,</hi> in which Boswell&#x2019;s attack on James Stewart of Dunearn had appeared.

He was the son of Johnson&#x2019;s Bozzie, and a man of very pleasing conversation, so that people regret him more than they wou<supplied>[l]</supplied>d do a worthier man.</p>
<p>You must write to me at great length by the very first opportunity. Have you begun the Nova Scotian sketches? I do advise you to try it fairly and forthwith. It will keep your mind from fretting in the interim; which is one great point, if it did nothing more. Describe to me all your manner of life and conversation. I must conclude this outline of my own&#x2014;for the time is done. <foreign>Adieu</foreign>, My dear Johnston!</p>

<salute>My dear Father,</salute>
<p>It is a long time since I heard from you personally and almost as long since I wrote to you; and as I am at liberty on this occassion to choose my own correspondent&#x2014;having no letters to <hi rend="italic">answer</hi>&#x2014;I have fixed upon you<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >After finishing this letter, Carlyle seems to realize that he should write one to his mother also&#x2014;both to be carried by Garthwaite.</note> to be the medium thro&#x2019; which intelligence of my fortunes may be conveyed to all my worthy and beloved friends about Mainhill. The matter will not detain me long; I wrote about every thing with extreme minuteness on several sheets only two weeks ago, and there has nothing occurred since then to create any considerable variety in my history. I still keep plodding away at my regular duties, which upon the whole I find to be very pleasant, and to form no small increase to my comfort in many respects. It is the most important of all things to have the mind kept from preying upon itself, and nothing is so important for this purpose as a constant series of employments, which we are bound in spite of all encumbrances to perform daily. I get rid of all tedium by this means; and secure at the same time a comfortable emolument to support me, as well as a reasonable portion of time to devote to my private studies. The Bullers I find to be very good-conditioned fellows on the whole: and the management of them requires no extraordinary portion of talent or resolution. The matter, <pb id="pg-02-86" n="02:86"/>as you know, is still in a state of comparative uncertainty: and I endeavour to provide for the worst, like a prudent youth, tho&#x2019; I am not without a pretty certain expectation that all things will terminate agreeably against August. Still, however, I reckon this tutorship only a temporary affair, and that I must work out my own deliverance by the independent exertion of such powers as it has pleased Providence to bestow on me. For this reason I am endeavouring to be as diligent as circumstances will permit to get forward some Literary undertaking, by which I may convince myself, and that small portion of the world which is likely to take any interest in me, that I am a person not unworthy of a little patronage, and capable of doing something better than I have yet had an opportunity of doing: This is a serious enterprise; and I have no great means of bringing it to a fortunate conclusion: nevertheless such is my condition that I must <hi rend="italic">attempt</hi> with all my strength and all my soul; and if I <hi rend="italic">am</hi> a poor &#x201C;empty ass&#x201D;&#x2014;why then&#x2014;as Singleton said&#x2014;there is no help for it; we must just do the best we can for a livelihood on some humbler footing.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably an Annandale neighbor. Cf. A. Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">CMSB</hi>, p. 18.</note> The title of this weary <hi rend="italic">Book</hi> [underscored twice] I have not yet fixed upon; but I am reading things to set it forth as diligently as I can.</p>
<p>It gives me great pleasure to learn that you at Mainhill are all in your usual state of business and content&#x2014;all in at least moderate health, and all striving against the difficulties of life with unabated perseverance. I have heard some farther speech of a <hi rend="italic">fresh</hi> reduction granted you by Sharpe; but whether it will be of an adequate extent, or whether indeed it have any real existence, I am not certainly informed. Certainly it is a time of unexampled difficulty to Farmers over all the Empire; and I have no doubt their case will at length awaken the Legislature to more effectual measures for their support. In the mean time <hi rend="italic">we</hi> have no means of helping ourselves, but the old ones, diligence and carefulness&#x2014;which, I know, you are ever applying with as much zeal as any one.</p>
<p>You would not forgive me if I neglected to say a word about the state of my own outward man&#x2014;which has troubled me and others so much and long. I am happy to let you know that my health <supplied>[is on]</supplied> the whole continuing to improve. The air in this place is scarcely inferior even to that of Annandale; I have the advantage of regular exercise; a little comfort in the present, a little hope in the future; and tho&#x2019; I am not strong or free of pain yet, I feel myself much stronger and more free of pain than I was some months ago&#x2014;and think I am <pb id="pg-02-87" n="02:87"/>continuing to advance in the same blessed direction. There is nothing in all the world that terrifies me to the heart, but the final ruin of my health; if that go I am sensible all is gone: so I take every precaution, and as I have said with very reasonable success. Complete recovery, however, must be a work of time: I should rejoice most heartily, if a true prophet would predict a <hi rend="italic">total removal</hi> of my disorders against this time twelvemonth&#x2014;which in fact I have some hopes of. At present, weakness is more my complaint than any disease; and as the latter is gone, I trust the former will go likewise. Let me be thankful for what I <hi rend="italic">have</hi> received! I can now think &#x26; speak with composure and self-possession; and tho&#x2019; weakish in body I am sound in mind; a blessing which I know not how to prize sufficiently. But I must now break off: my sheet &#x26; my time and I daresay your patience are near an end. I beg you will excuse this most meagre of all letters, and write me yourself by the first opportunity. Alick and the whole toll of them must write to me likewise. <closer><salute>With the kindest sentiments towards all of them I remain,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>The box came to me last night with notice that Garthwaite would leave town to-day; so that I have not been without time enough to send you many and ample letters by this conveyance: but having been engaged or tired this morning &#x26; the preceding evening, and also having listened too much to the foul thief Procrastination,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Edward Young (<date when="1683-00-00">1683</date>&#x2013;<date when="1765-00-00">1765</date>), <hi rend="italic">Night Thoughts</hi>, I, 393.</note> I have as usual narrowed myself greatly in point of space, and I have now only a few words that I can say to you; being engaged to appear at Dr Flemings (two miles off) within forty minutes.</p>
<p>I can still, however, find room to express my thankfulness to the Giver of all good for continuing a measure of health &#x26; happiness to you, and I am enabled to add a little to the latter by again assuring <pb id="pg-02-88" n="02:88"/>you that the same blessings are still vouchsafed to me. I beg my good Mother not to be anxious or uneasy about me. I have been long habituated to indifferent fortune, and have proved it so well, that even if it should return, it would affect me little in comparison with many. There is nothing on Earth indispensable but a good conscience&#x2014;and if possible, steady health. The first I do trust never altogether to forfeit; and the last I make no doubt will be granted me <hi rend="italic">completely</hi> ere long. So be at ease about me.</p>
<p>The stockings and other things you have sent me are of additional value in my eyes, as proofs of the unwearied care with which, tho so much embarrassed on your own account, you continue to watch over me. I still hope to see the day when I may acknowledge all this more effectually. I think you wanted a bonnet when I was at home: Do not buy any till after the box returns. I have always forgotten to ask at the shops about it; and I write this by way of pledge to force me to ask.</p>
<p>Edward Irving is come into this country again. He has been over in Fife, and the day before yesterday, he went away to Haddington to see his friends in that quarter: I expect his return ere long. The arrangements about his London journey are not yet completed; indeed it seems a little doubtful when he may go, or whether he may go at all. He is a good man, go where he will.</p>
<p>But my time is done, even before I have got fairly commenced. <closer><salute>Excuse my brevity; write to me whenever you can; present my love to all the brethren &#x26; sisters&#x2014;forge<supplied>[t]</supplied> no-one&#x2014;not even little Jane &#x26; Jenny; and believe me to be,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Madam,</salute>
<p>I happened to fall in with these books lately; and thinking they might perhaps amuse you for a little, I have made bold to send them. You will pardon me for doing so, if it be offensive to you.</p>
<p>I have got no German queries from you, for a long while. It would grieve me very much if I imagined that any cause, but your not wanting <pb id="pg-02-89" n="02:89"/>farther help in those studies, had prevented you from applying to me. I have often said, that, few gratifications could be dearer to me, than that of being able to forward your interest in any point: I again beg you to believe that in such cases (if there be any such), I alone am the obliged party.</p>
<p>One or two things have occurred to me, in the course of reading or reflection, which I thought might perhaps be useful to you as subjects of literary composition: if you care aught about them, they are altogether at your service.</p>
<p>I would gladly stand in your Mother&#x2019;s remembrance as she does in mine. <closer><salute>I desire you to present my kind respects to her, if you think fit: and to consider me as being at all times,</salute></closer></p>

<p>By good fortune, I this day learnt the place of your actual residence; and am thereby enabled without loss of time to submit to your consideration a piece of intelligence, and a proposal connected with it, which I have just been discussing with the worthy Dr Fleming, and which I agree with him in thinking may eventually be of service to you.</p>
<p>The General Assembly of the Church, and the Presbytery of Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> acting for it, have agreed upon the propriety of devoting some portion of the &#x201C;Royal Donative (&#xa3;2000 per an.) for the Highlands&#x201D; to the establishment of sundry effective Schools in that region; and have, in the first instance, fixed upon the village of Oban in Argyleshire as a convenient place for beginning with,&#x2014;being encouraged by the advantages of the spot itself, and by the eagerly proffered concurrence of several influential persons in the neighbourhood. With this view, they have already found means to lay the plan of an institution, the chief characteristics of which are as follows. The teacher to have a free house; and &#xa3;35 a-year of salary from the Church-fund, other &#xa3;35 being furnished by the favourers of the project who reside in the vicinity; together with all the fees which can be collected from the scholars in the usual way. The permanent income, you see, is &#xa3;70 <pb id="pg-02-90" n="02:90"/>yearly, with a house; and as the village (which was lately <hi rend="italic">very</hi> thriving) contains about 1200 inhabitants and has no regular establishment for education within several miles of it; the whole emolument including school-wages and every other item will certainly exceed &#xa3;100 per annum, even upon the most moderate computation. Other advantages are the cheapness of living in that quarter; the sociable kindly character of the natives; and their great inclination (so unequivocally evinced by drawing their purses) to pratronize [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] the undertaking. They seem to intend that it shall be a kind of superior seminary; and expect, if it prosper, that the Master will get boarders in considerable numbers from the adjoining <foreign>Lairds</foreign>, and thus augment his stipend to a much larger sum. They expect many other things: but this is the substance of what they <hi rend="italic">offer</hi>.</p>
<p>In return for it, they require that the Teacher (a member of <hi rend="italic">the</hi> Church of course) shall be enabled to teach Latin, the elements of Greek, Arithmetic, and the other branches usual in parish schools. They also mean that he shall be <hi rend="italic">said</hi> (this by way of salvo for the Donative&#x2019;s sake&#x2014;which is purely of a religious nature; that he shall be <hi rend="italic">said</hi>) to catechize the children &#x26; people now &#x26; then upon the outlines of theology. This however as I have mentioned appears to be likely to prove as nearly as possible a sinecure: Let no man therefore of a tender conscience go about to make a bug [bugaboo] of it!</p>
<p>Now altho&#x2019; those terms seem plausible enough, and tho&#x2019; they have been advertised in the Newspapers for many weeks; yet so it happened that when the trial of candidates came on (to-day if I mistake not), they turned out all to be of the most inferior qualifications; and the Examinators, the Members of the Presbytery, determined in great disappointment&#x2014;not to advertise again, for that had been already tried&#x2014;but to let the matter rest, till next Meeting (a fortnight hence), and in the mean time privately to make what enquiries they could; and see if possible to effect a better muster before finally deciding. This made Fleming speak to me, and now makes me apply to you.</p>
<p>From what I can gather, there seems every probability that you may carry this situation, in the most honourable manner, if you like to try; they spoke of reading Horace <foreign><hi rend="italic">ad aperturam</hi></foreign> [on sight] as a terrible thing: and in the event of your accepting it, I certainly think it would fit you as well as any thing likely to cast up soon. It is quite permanent; has a fixed income of no inconsiderable amount, independent of all contingencies: it is respectable; holds out a kind of society which you are likely to relish; and will afford a stance for you <pb id="pg-02-91" n="02:91"/>in the world &#x201C;a local habitation &#x26; a name,&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18201205-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1820-12-05">5 Dec. 1820</date></ref>.</note> which your own industry may increase the value of to any reasonable amount you chuse. So I certainly advise you to make application forthwith<supplied>[.]</supplied> The mode of applying is to address a letter to Fleming (George-square Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>) stating your wish to be regarded as a candidate, and enclosing all the recommendations you can lay hold of (from Mr Duncan, Mr Poole,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Perhaps the Dr. Poole mentioned in <ref target="volume-01/lt-18210411-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1821-04-11">11 April 1821</date></ref>.</note> Edward Irving Mr Church, Mr Ritchie<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >This could be one of several Ritchies, possibly Prof. William Ritchie. See <ref target="volume-02/lt-18170331-TC-RM-01">TC to RM, <date when="1817-03-31">31 March 1817</date></ref>.</note> &#x26;c &#x26;c), and requesting withal to be apprised of any thing farther that may be concluded in the business. You may send the whole packet to me if you like&#x2014;by any person going (within the fortnight) from Kir<supplied>[k]</supplied>cudbright; or by the Coach, or Carrier, or any other way. I beg of you to think of it strenuously &#x26; bestir yourself in it<supplied>[.]</supplied> Now, my dear Johnstone, I have set this matter before you: and I pray earnestly it may be for good. Write to me if you want farther information before entering upon it: I have told you all I know as yet; but I can ask any thing. Why have you not written long ago?&#x2014; And our good Mitchell? <hi rend="italic">how</hi> is he? I was struck to learn the cause of your going into Galloway: I do trust it bodes no serious evil to our friend.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mitchell was suffering from tuberculosis. See <ref target="volume-02/lt-18220407-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1822-04-07">7 April</date></ref>.</note> Present my affectionate condolences to him; and bid him be of courage. I will not believe that there is <hi rend="italic">any</hi> serious danger. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Valete</hi></foreign> [Farewell] <supplied>[to both]</supplied> of you! <closer><salute>I am always</salute></closer></p>

<p>From a sheet of paper pretending to be a letter, that came to me some days ago, I learned to my great surprise, and satisfaction, that the wrecked M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle has been restored sound in mind and body to his lamenting friends.</p>
<p>Truly Sir to my mind you have made a far more wonderful escape than Jonah did&#x2014; Jonah during his three days visit to the deep, was snug in the capacious belly of a whale&#x2014;whereas you have been actually swallowed up by the waves, for many weeks, without (as far as I know) getting into the inside of any fish whatever&#x2014; You must have seen strange sights since our last meeting.

I will thank you also to transmit to me the papers which you mention before you set out on your next voyage.</p>
<p>For some weeks past the clever people here have been without half their wits and the silly ones (that is to say every body except my Mother<supplied>[,]</supplied> Shandy, and myself<supplied>[)]</supplied> have been stark mad&#x2014; Barnyards have blazed till the conflagration has spread over the brains of our whole community.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Scotsman</hi> of <date when="1822-04-13">13 April</date> reports rick-burning episodes in Haddingtonshire. Such protests against agricultural depression were also current in England at the time.</note> It will be well if it does them no further mischief; for of all their possessions their wits will be the least missed.</p>
<p>I thank you for Cowper. He is a charming creature, and makes me laugh. but yet he is not a man according to my heart&#x2014;oh no&#x2014;I can not exactly tell my fault to him&#x2014;I think he draws so larg<supplied>[e]</supplied>ly on my pity that I cannot spare him much of my admiration&#x2014; I am in a <hi rend="italic">terrible</hi> hurry My Mother has called on me half a dozen times since I began to write&#x2014; I am going to the country but will be at home on Wednesday to rece<supplied>[i]</supplied>ve your expected communication <supplied>[if]</supplied> it is is convenient for you to write on that day&#x2014;</p>

Conscious of procrastinating too long in writing, Miss Welsh here sportively enlarges Pen not into Penfillan but into Penelope, the name of Ulysses&#x2019; faithful wife, who put off for so long the hateful task of choosing a husband from the wasteful and riotous horde of suitors assembled in her house during Ulysses&#x2019; protracted absence&#x201D; (A.

<salute>My dear Alick,</salute>
<p>I have just read over your very lively, kind &#x26; acceptable letter; which, tho&#x2019; the Carrier as usual has left me completely in the dark as to the period of his out-going or even his personal identity, I proceed to answer as minutely as the various calls upon my time will permit. <pb id="pg-02-93" n="02:93"/>As you are always too ambitious of my suffrage, I am happy to congratulate you on the still increasing merits in a literary point of view (which to me are the smallest merits) of your successive epistles. You only need to write oftener in order to become a very superior inditer as well as penman. I am proud to think that my advices &#x26; animadversions may have had some influence in encouraging this intellectual developement, and cherishing the expression of those honest &#x26; manly sentiments, that genuine humour &#x26; sprightly vivacity, which distinguish your natural character. I again enjoin you, by the authority that age &#x26; affection give me over you, to go on improving, to neglect no opportunity of increasing your fund of ideas or your powers of exhibiting them; and I predict without dread of failure, that by so doing, you will in due time reach the object of your honourable efforts, the consciousness of possessing a mind furnished with solid knowledge and all those departments of cultivation which dignify the humblest situation, and without which the highest can have <hi rend="italic">no</hi> dignity. I have a book here for you &#x201C;the Letters of Junius,&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Designed to discredit the ministry of August Henry Fitzroy (<date when="1735-00-00">1735</date>&#x2013;<date when="1811-00-00">1811</date>), third Duke of Grafton, and evidently written by one who had access to confidential information pertaining to that ministry, the letters first appeared in the London <hi rend="italic">Public Advertiser</hi> from <date when="1769-01-21">21 Jan. 1769</date> to <date when="1772-01-21">21 Jan. 1772</date>. Junius himself, who has never been positively identified (the likeliest candidate seems to be Sir Philip Francis [<date when="1740-00-00">1740</date>&#x2013;<date when="1818-00-00">1818</date>]), selected sixty-nine of the letters for a collected edition in <date when="1772-00-00">1772</date>. This and other completer (and complete) editions have been frequently published and republished since. See also the note on Robert Heron, <ref target="volume-01/lt-18200804-TC-TM-01">TC to TM, <date when="1820-08-04">4 Aug. 1820</date></ref>.</note> which I know not whether I shall get it sent to-day&#x2014;so awkwardly have things been ordered. Knox<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In his <hi rend="italic">Two Note Books</hi> (p. 5), Carlyle mentions Thomas M&#x2019;Crie&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">The Life of John Knox</hi>. A fourth edition was published in Edinburgh in <date when="1818-00-00">1818</date>. See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18210300-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1821-03-01">1 March 1821</date></ref>.</note> I have also enquired concerning: I found a copy of it bound at&#x2014;a reduced price of I cannot just recollect how many shillgs, but cheap as I judge. Perhaps I may get the whole sent off to-day notwithstanding every obstacle; along with our Mother&#x2019;s bonnet, which is also here, standing fiercely in a large band-box challenging me, as it were, to dispatch it quickly whithersoever I please<supplied>[.]</supplied></p>
<p>You are very good to shew so much anxiety about my health: I again positively assure you that it continues to improve. I have not been so well for many months as I am even now. The stomach &#x26;c are still weak &#x26; troublesome; but (thank God for it!) that unspeakable imprisonment of all my faculties, that darkness of the head &#x26; darkness of the heart, which nothing so completely as disordered nerves can give one, is now almost quite gone. I feel very contented in my <pb id="pg-02-94" n="02:94"/>usual state&#x2014;full of business even to overflowing, with projects of all sorts before me, and some few rational hopes of executing a definite portion of them. With regard to the Book, it is true, as you guess, that I have been &#x201C;riddling Creation&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Their father&#x2019;s expression (as Alick remarked in his letter of <date when="1822-04-21">21 April</date>).</note> for a subject to dilate upon; and have felt no small disquietude till I could find something suitable. Within the last month, however, I have well nigh fixed upon a topic, and I feel considerable alacrity, and much more contentment than formerly, in laying in materials for setting it forth. My purpose (but this only among yourselves!) is to come out with a kind of Essay on the Civil Wars, the Commonwealth of England&#x2014;not to write a history of them&#x2014;but to exhibit if I can some features of the national character as it was then displayed, supporting my remarks by mental portraits, drawn with my best ability, of Cromwell, Laud, Geo: Fox, Milton, Hyde &#x26;c the most distinguished of the actors in this great scene. I may of course intersperse the work of delineation with all the ideas, which I can gather from any point of the Universe. If I live with even moderate health, I purpose to do this; and if I can but finish it according to my own conception of what it should be, I shall feel much happier than if I had inherited much gold &#x26; silver. The Critics too may say of it either nothing or any thing, according to their own good pleasure; if it once please my own mighty <hi rend="italic">self</hi>, I do not value them or their opinion a single rush. Long habit has inured me to live with a very limited &#x26; therefore a dearer circle of approvers: all I aim at is to convince my own conscience that I have not taken their approbation without some just claims to it.</p>
<p>These are the fairy regions of Hope, from which I am incessantly recalled by multitudes of less glorious but more urgent actual duties. The printing of LeGendre is fairly begun&#x2014;and intended to proceed at the rate of two sheets per week. I thought to steer clear of it, &#x26; fix it on Waugh, but it would not do: so I am in for it myself, and expect to be kept as busy with it &#x201C;as a cock on the <supplied>[sp]</supplied>it&#x201D; till after August. I purpose making Jack help me a little: I have indeed need of help; and my studies even with it, in so far as <hi rend="italic">the</hi> Book is concerned, must in the mean time go on rather leisurely. The hours I spend in teaching are not by any means uncomfortable&#x2014;except as they consume my leisure, which I would gladly devote to other objects: the boys are very brave-hearted fellows&#x2014;particularly the elder&#x2014;and respect me sufficiently. I still look upon our final agreement, however, as a thing not to be counted on: but fortunately like <hi rend="italic">Cowthat&#x2019;s</hi><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cowthat is a farm a mile north of Ecclefechan, but Carlyle seems to be quoting a person&#x2014;probably the farmer. It is a normal Scottish usage to refer to a farmer by the name of his farm.</note> weather &#x201C;it may <pb id="pg-02-95" n="02:95"/>be <foreign><hi rend="italic">owther</hi></foreign> [either] way,&#x201D; without affecting me immensely; I have plenty of offers from Booksellers &#x26;c (whose anxiety to employ me, naturally increases in the inverse ratio of my want of employment) to undertake editions of works, and so forth, under terms sufficiently liberal: and at the beginning of August, I shall have &#x201C;money in my purse&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#xa3; 100 to become due him from the Bullers. The quotation, from <hi rend="italic">Othello</hi>, I, iii, he employed again in the essay on Scott (&#x201C;Life of Scott,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XXIX, 54) and elsewhere.</note> to set me above the necessity of drudgery for a long while. So I do not feel much apprehension; none at all, if it were not for the matter of health, which also, as I have said, has a favourable aspect at present.</p>
<p>Thus, my dear fellow, have I prated to you for &#x201C;a strucken hour&#x201D; of myself and my doings&#x2014;sure of an attentive &#x26; interested listener, and careless of concealing whatever solicited utterance. I must now draw bridle. There were a thousand questions that I meant to ask you; but you must endeavour to forestall them next opportunity, and to send me all the details you can collect. Bad luck to the low hound of Supplebank! he was always &#x201C;a Turk in grain.&#x201D; Why do they not send <hi rend="italic">him</hi> to the Poyais Country, for which his brother here is crimping so valiantly? He is the very man to split logwood &#x26; be eaten by Mosquitoes. Out upon him!<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Supplebank is a farm in Annandale, near Scotsbrig. The allusion is to one Robert Irving (&#x201C;Bob o&#x2019; the Bank&#x201D;), who, according to Alick&#x2019;s letter of <date when="1822-04-21">21 April</date>, and James Johnston&#x2019;s letter of <date when="1822-04-27">27 April</date>, was trying to &#x201C;whiddle&#x201D; his aunt&#x2019;s farm from her soon after her husband&#x2019;s death. The aunt was the widow of George Irving, and the farm was Bogside. In a letter to his father (<ref target="volume-03/lt-18240625-TC-JCE-01"><date when="1824-06-25">25 June 1824</date></ref>), Carlyle speaks of the man&#x2019;s brother Edward, the &#x201C;Poyais Emigrator,&#x201D; who by that time had been to and returned from an expedition to the Poyais country (a mosquito-ridden territory on the east coast of New Honduras named for the Poyais Indians) with Sir Gregor Macgregor (<hi rend="italic">fl</hi>. <date when="1817-00-00">1817</date>), an adventurer who was attempting to establish a Scottish settlement there and who called himself the &#x201C;Cacique of Poyais.&#x201D; A third brother, Thomas, is also mentioned. The Supplebank Irvings seem to have been related to Edward Irving.</note></p>
<p>I wish I could get a box home this time; for I want some cakes and eggs. I think if you sent about a <hi rend="italic">quarter</hi> of meal, the landlady here could make me cakes herself. She bakes tolerable ones out even of the saw-dust, which they false<supplied>[ly]</supplied> call oatmeal in these parts. But I must off to the Carrier&#x2019;s lodgings &#x26; see what can be done. <foreign>Adieu</foreign> my dear Alick! <closer><salute>I am always,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I had just finished Sandy&#x2019;s epistle, and was in the act of going out to look after the Carrier, when the sound of three o&#x2019;clock recalled me to the recollection of dinner, and I determined to postpone my departure till I had finished that important meal. Beef has not the character of being any great quickener of the intellectual powers; yet the time spent in discussing my cold joint has produced an alteration, &#x26; as I think an improvement, of great moment in my plans with regard to the Carrier Garthwaite, for such I now conjecture him to be. I have hired the smallest of imps, a little weazened child, to carry up this handbox for me, determining in the mean time to forego all thoughts of sending any <hi rend="italic">box</hi> to-day but not to forego the pleasure of writing you a long letter. Part of my enterprise, you see, I am already executing.</p>
<p>You will find here a bonnet of Imperial chip or Simple chip, or Real chip<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Chip</hi> is wood, Cuban palm leaf, straw, or the like, split into thin slips for the manufacture of hats or bonnets.</note> or whatever it is, which I hope will arrive safely &#x26; be found to suit you. I think it looks like your head. I wish it were fifty times better, for your sake: it would still be the most feeble testimony of what I owe to your kind affection, which has followed me unweariedly thro&#x2019; good &#x26; evil fortune, soothing &#x26; sweetening all the days of my existence, &#x26; which I trust Providence will yet long long continue for a blessing to us both.</p>
<p>I know you will fret about those things &#x26; talk about expense &#x26; so forth. This is quite erroneous doctrine: the few shillings, that serve to procure a little enjoyment to your frugal life, are as mere <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> in the outlay of this luxurious city. If you want any other thing, I do beg you would let me know: there is not any way in which I can spend a portion of my earnings so advantageously. Tell me honestly, Do you get tea and other things comfortably? I should be very sorry if you restricted yourself for any reason but from choice. It would be a fine thing surely, if you that have toiled for almost half a century in nourishing stalwart sons, should not now by their means have a little ease &#x26; comfort, when it lies in their power to gain it for you! I again entreat <pb id="pg-02-97" n="02:97"/>you, if you wish for any thing within the reach of my ability, to let me hear of it.</p>
<p>I have already, to Alick, described my way of life so fully, that I need not insist upon it farther at present. I am teaching, writing, reading, walking to &#x26; fro along the streets, smoking, eating&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">carr</hi>ying on with all my heart. In due time, too, a Book will, I firmly trust, shew its face in the world: but on this topic I must not enlarge, &#x201C;to gut fishere one gets them&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Traditional proverb.</note> being a very sorry practice. I intend doing my utmost; and unless those hideous fits of bile return, I have no fear that all will not prosper.</p>
<p>Fleming&#x2019;s people are very pleasant characters; I feel quite at home among them. The old man is a bit <foreign>canty</foreign> [cheerful] little fellow as you would desire to see, and talks very cheerfully &#x26; copiously. He proposed a situation of Schoolmaster in the Highlands (of &#xa3;100 a year) the other night; for which I took the liberty of recommending James Johnstone, &#x26; I have accordingly written to Kirkcudbright about it. I am in hopes poor James will get it; and certainly it looks as if it would fit him exactly. Poor Mitchell is rather dangerously ill, they say: I pity him very cordially; for he is a good youth, and very soft in the heart; he will be in very low spirits.</p>
<p>I see Waugh here occasionally, but what to predict concerning him I do not know. He has absolutely no money&#x2014;beyond a few shillings, which I paid him in advance for translating a few pages by way of specimen from the French book I am engaged with. He cannot borrow [tear in paper] cannot beg or dig, and what he is to do I really <supplied>[dislike]</supplied> to contemplate. For himself, he bears up amazingly; not so much out of firmness as insensibility, which I do think is the most sovereign thing on Earth for carrying one safely &#x26; calmly thro&#x2019; this world.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">I Henry IV</hi>, I, iii: &#x201C;And telling me the sovereignest thing on earth / Was parmaceti for an inward bruise.&#x201D;</note> Waugh is determined to have a Physicians Degree; and keeps trusting blindly to the future, for every thing that he needs or even wishes. I never saw so much imprudence, or so hardly punished.</p>
<p>But I must leave Waugh &#x26; the whole <foreign><hi rend="italic">Clanjeffray</hi></foreign> [low worthless lot] of them; for my paper is getting narrow, and the appointed hour is just upon the stroke. I entrust you with my affectionate remembrances to My Father, and all the family every one.

At the present, I do not want any thing&#x2014;I shall give you proper notice when I do.</p>
<p>Farewell my dear Mother! May all Good be with you always!</p>

<dateline><place>Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi></place>, Monday-Evening [<date when="1822-04-29">29 April 1822</date>]&#x2014;</dateline>
<salute>My dear Jack,</salute>
<p>I received your letter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1822-04-24">24 April</date>.</note> duly, and read it over with the pleasure which your letters always give me. I have since committed the most awkward mistake with regard to it. Being engaged to write Johnstone (about a School, which they have in view to establish in Argyleshire), I accordingly prepared an epistle for him with great speed; and passing by the Post-Office next morning, I threw into the box&#x2014;not that official communication&#x2014;but poor Jack&#x2019;s open letter, which I was wearing in my pocket for the convenience of being able to peruse it a third time when I saw cause! The subsequent evening, I discovered my mistake, and despatched Johnstone&#x2019;s intelligence forthwith, but have not yet succeeded in withdrawing from the &#x201C;Dead-letter-office&#x201D; the unfortunate sheet which had so little cause to appear there, and which besides I am in hourly want of for the sake of Geo: Johnstone&#x2019;s address. If I fail entirely, your letter will in time return to Annan; and I caution you that no postage is due for it, and therefore that you pay none, but let the post-men turn their hand with it, if they refuse to give it up charge-free.</p>
<p>My reason for troubling you so soon is partly that I may talk with you about Legendre. They have begun printing it in good earnest, &#x26; I am fairly engaged to furnish the press with two sheets of it weekly. In your last letter I mentioned my willingness to have shoved the whole matter off my hands, if it had been convenient, and my purpose in consequence to charge Waugh with the management of it. Waugh was ready to snatch at the offer; but I found the other parties were not likely to be so easily satisfied; and on surveying John&#x2019;s specimen (for he translated a sheet by way of specimen), it did not seem that their scruples were likely to be removed by a perusal of it: so I paid Waugh for what he had done and more (a very acceptable arrangement <pb id="pg-02-99" n="02:99"/>for poor Waugh!), and determined to go on with the business myself, at whatever sacrifice of time or inclination. Nor am I likely to repent this resolution, or to feel the sacrifice so great as I anticipated. By devoting the two hours and a half, between dinner &#x26; six o&#x2019;clock, to the task, I can very nearly keep straight with Oliver &#x26; Boyd&#x2019;s greasy pressmen; and the time so spent would be well nigh quite useless to me in any other point of view; seeing the oppression, which a meal constantly lays upon this <hi rend="italic">inward man</hi> of mine, is such as almost entirely to unfit me for serious thought, for a good space always after eating&#x2014;particularly eating beef. I am at present about four sheets a-head of the knaves&#x2014;being engaged in the Appendix to Book IV.&#x2014;and I do not care to have them come much nearer me; a result which, as just stated, I hope to succeed in avoiding.</p>
<p>This even without any help: but as you request me to give you something to copy, and as I am nothing <hi rend="italic">too</hi> well secured against being overtaken by the &#x201C;Devil&#x201D; (not Satan&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">Sat</hi>teen&#x2014;but the Printer&#x2019;s Devil&#x2014;a little snotty boy&#x2014;that carries proof-sheets to and fro, and comes asking for &#x201C;Copy&#x201D;), it seems as if it would serve at least five or six different purposes altogether, if you were to set about rendering a portion of Legendre yourself. I have already mentioned two of those purposes: a third would be the familiarizing yourself with the French &#x26; English tongues; a fourth would be <hi rend="italic">ditto</hi> with the geometry of planes; a fifth would be doing me a service; a sixth would be putting a little cash into your own pocket; a seventh would be&#x2014; But I need not multiply reasons: Jack is already convinced, and burns for action.</p>
<p>Begin, therefore, my bonny boy, at the beginning of Book V. if you please (I shall skip over the whole, into Book sixth); translate a little of it as you find convenience; write it out in a legible hand (<hi rend="italic">legible</hi> will do); and send it up to me, so that it be here within three weeks or thereby&#x2014;I mean the portion of it you shall have finished, no matter how small. I know you will do it quite sufficiently: my only advice to you is not to waver and dangle too long over it, consuming time unprofitably: I have to correct it all any way as it comes from the press; and it will be scarce any addition to my trouble to rectify any improprieties you may fall into. The beginning of the fifth Book then&#x2014;definitions included&#x2014;!&#x2014;and observe that the figures are <supplied>[worked?]</supplied> into the text in this edition, so you must mark the directing number opposite the place where the figure it refers to will be wanted&#x2014;thus in prop. I, you will mark {fig. 181.} thus, between the enunciation and the proof in a line by itself; {fig. 182.} between the two corollaries&#x2014; <pb id="pg-02-100" n="02:100"/>or closer to the second; et <foreign><hi rend="italic">sic de caeteris</hi></foreign> [and so the rest]. The references are put within parentheses as in Leslies book; thus (prop. 4. V.) in the first definition. Where you see words in italics&#x2014;as <hi rend="italic">perpendicular to a plane</hi> in the first definition&#x2014;mak [mark] them with a stroke beneath as I have done here; except the enunciations, which you need not be at any such trouble with&#x2014;they being printed so any way. These directions will do I am certain; so I leave the matter&#x2014;with an understanding that you begin as soon as may be. I shall expect <hi rend="italic">some</hi> &#x201C;Copy&#x201D; by the Jurist&#x2019;s box<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Dalgliesh&#x2019;s box from his parents&#x2019; home in Annandale.</note>&#x2014;or Farries next time&#x2014;or else a letter accounting for the deficit&#x2014;which (mark this Jack&#x2014;and do not get into a <foreign>pucker</foreign> [confusion, agitation]&#x2014;if any thing come in the way to obstruct your progress) it will be no hard matter for me to make good if you give me any thing like timely notice.&#x2014; And do not, my kind Tongleggus, allow this at all to abstract you from your Greek in any degree, or your other useful speculations. I am very glad to hear of your perseverance in that pursuit&#x2014;be steady in it&#x2014;for in due time you will reap the fruit of your exertions. Let no fear chill you Jack: I have looked abroad a little into your walk of life; and I say without hesitation or reserve that you are destined for things far better than you have yet contemplated. Your very diligence would convince me of this&#x2014;if your natural talents were even of a common stamp. Be of heart then, my brave Jack!&#x2014; Think of next winter when a far wider &#x26; brighter field is to be opened up for you; when you are to have an elder brother beside you, and be admitted to the wells of learning to drink your fill. And never think of the pelf part of it: you &#x26; I are both frugal characters; and we shall have abundance betwixt us. Never mind it.&#x2014; I have ceased for a long while to lecture you about visiting the people in your burgh: it is not that I think the practice needless or unimportant, but that I hope my injunctions are needless. Depend upon it&#x2014;you are clean wrong as to Ben&#x2014;he <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> entertain any such feeling towards you: go often to him.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John had written that Ben Nelson, though always civil when he visited him, did not always really welcome his visits.

<salute>My dear Madam,</salute>
<p>I address myself with the greatest pleasure to the task you have so kindly imposed on me. I very much approve your resolution to exercise your powers in some sort of literary effort; and I shall think myself happy, if by any means I can aid you in putting it in practice. There is nothing more injurious to the faculties than to keep poring over books continually without attempting to exhibit any of our own conceptions. We amass ideas, it is true; but at the same time we proportionally weaken our power of expressing them; a power equally valuable with that of conceiving them, and which, tho&#x2019; in some degree like it the gift of Nature, is in a far higher degree the fruit of art, and so languishes more irretrievably by want of culture. Besides, our very conceptions when not taken up with the view of being delineated in writing are almost sure to become vague and disorganised; a glimpse of the truth will often satisfy mere curiosity equally with a full view of it; so hallucinations are apt to be substituted for perceptions: and even if our materials were all individually accurate, yet being gathered together from every quarter, and heaped into one undistinguished mass, they form at last an unmanageable chaos, serving little purpose except to perplex and cumber the mind that lives among them&#x2014;to make it vacillating, irregular, and very unhappy&#x2014;at least if it have not the fortune to be a pedant&#x2019;s mind&#x2014;who I believe is generally a very cheerful character.</p>
<p>So that you see it is every way incumbent upon you to commence writing without loss of time; and to continue it steadily as you proceed in the acquisition of knowledge, thus causing the developement of your taste and of your ability to realize its dictates to go forward hand in hand. I do not imagine that you stand in need of all this confused logic to animate you in this undertaking:&#x2014;inclination, I know well enough, impels you sufficiently at present; but inclination is oft<supplied>[t]</supplied>imes rather an unsteady guide, and at no time the worse for having conviction along with it.</p>
<p>There is not room here for dilating upon the peculiarities of your genius; to which at any rate I have no right to make myself inspector, even if my knowledge of the subject rendered my opinion worth the giving. I cannot help saying, however, that according to my imperfect <pb id="pg-02-102" n="02:102"/>observations, you seem with great keenness of intellectual vision generally, to unite a decided tendency to the study of human character both as an object of curiosity and of love or contempt, and to manifest a very striking faculty of expressing its peculiarities, not only by description but imitation. This is the very essence of dramatic genius; and if I mistake not, the blame will lie elsewhere than with Nature if you fail of producing something worth producing in this department. It depends on other circumstances than your intellectual powers, whether you should adopt the tragic or the comic species of composition: you know whether you feel more disposition to sympathize with the wretched or to laugh at the happy; to admire excellence or to search out defects; to cherish long vehement, heart felt, perhaps extravagant enthusiasm, or to exert the force of your heart in brief, violent sallies, the violence of which a sense of propriety is ever subduing and rendering of short continuance&#x2014;converting indignation into derision, sympathy into pity and admiration into respect. The truth is those two kinds of talent are never so accurately divided in nature, as the two objects of them are in art; most people who could write a tragedy of merit could write a sort of comedy also, and <hi rend="italic">vice versa</hi>. It is not indeed necessary to confine your efforts either to the one or the other: the kind of genius named dramatic may be employed in a thousand ways unconnected with the theatre; it gives life &#x26; splendour to the picturesque Novels of Sir Walter Scott; and forms, in a different shape, the basis of much sublime philosophy in the treatises of Madame de Sta&#xEB;l. It is misemployed only when it is unoccupied; when the understanding, the invention, the fancy which might have given it a local habitation and a name,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18201205-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1820-12-05">5 Dec. 1820</date></ref>.</note> a shape and vehicle, are devoted to purposes in which it does not enter&#x2014;to studying abstract sciences or manufacturing smart paragraphs&#x2014;writing epigrams or reading metaphysics &#x26; mathematics&#x2014;or any thing of a similar stamp. I would not have you, therefore, confine yourself too rigidly to mere Plays; it will be enough if you are engaged in the delineation or inspection of Character&#x2014;without which I imagine you cannot do justice to your powers; but in the investigation of which you are not bound to any particular form of composition, being at liberty to cast your ideas into the shape of a historical description, of a Panegyric, of a novel, quite as much as of a regular drama. For this reason&#x2014; But the Subjects? you say&#x2014;the subjects&#x2014;and have done with this prosing!&#x2014; Well! here are two.</p>
<p>The first is a Tragedy to be constructed from the Story of Boadicea <pb id="pg-02-103" n="02:103"/>queen of the Iceni, a British tribe during her time under the dominion of the Romans. I know not if you are acquainted with the story of this lady: it is related in the 14<hi rend="italic">th</hi> book of Tacitus Annals&#x2014;in Henry&#x2019;s history<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Henry (<date when="1718-00-00">1718</date>&#x2013;<date when="1790-00-00">90</date>), <hi rend="italic">The History of Great Britain</hi>, 6 vols. (<date when="1771-00-00">1771</date>&#x2013;<date when="1793-00-00">93</date>).</note> (I suppose), both of which works I can send you if you like. She was the widow of Prasutagus who to secure the peace of his household had left the Emperor (Nero) coheir with his two daughters &#x26; their Mother: his kindness was unworthily requited; the Roman soldiers not only harried &#x26; laid waste his territories, but carried their brutal violence into the palace itself; Boadicea was beaten like a slave, and her two daughters used inhumanly. Treatment which the &#x201C;crafty Lioness&#x201D; was not slow or powerless to resent. She assembled the people, all driven already to madness by oppression, persuaded them to take arms, and turn against their tyrants. They did so after many omens &#x26; superstitious observances. Their vengeance was signal; they rioted a while in victory &#x26; blood; then met the Romans collected into a formidable body; and set their whole hopes of peace or even of life upon the cast at once. Boadicea harangued the men in person, many of their wives &#x26; children sitting on waggons behind the ranks to animate them in the fight. &#x201C;She was of stature big and tall, of visage grim and stern, harsh of voice; her hair of bright colour flowed down to her limbs; she wore a plaited garment of divers colours, with a large gold chain; buttoned over all a thick robe.&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >From Dio Cassius, Roman politician and historian, who died after <date when="0230-00-00"><hi rend="small-caps">a.d.</hi> 230</date>, and whose chief work was a history of Rome written in Greek in eighty books. A Greek summary of this was made by Xiphilinus, a monk of the eleventh century. Carlyle quotes from this, Bk. LXII, 2.</note> The battle was lost to her; the British slaughtered miserably; she despatched herself by poison.</p>
<p>The advantages of these materials are considerable in my opinion. They are yet untouched, so far as I know; they carry you back into an age the manners of which are so unknown that they may be fashioned according to your pleasure; &#x26; they present you a variety of characters fitted for tragedy, and one eminently tragical character to group them all around. Boadicea (she need not be &#x201C;big&#x201D; or &#x201C;grim&#x201D; unless you like) is a character too which you could manage well. You have the widowed matron, the high-spirited woman, the patriot&#x2014;the mother the queen irritated exasperated beyond the possibility of remedy;&#x2014;you could shew her proud endurance of first injuries&#x2014;her fiery purpose to endure them no longer,&#x2014;her sympathy with the patriotic agony of her subjects, once free, now enslaved&#x2014;and to Nero; her sway over every mind&#x2014;men serving her with the devotedness due at once <pb id="pg-02-104" n="02:104"/>to a sovereign of a lofty spirit &#x26; to an injured female: then you might interweave with it as much of the gloomiest superstition as you chose&#x2014; Druids with their wicker idols &#x26; human victims, their portents &#x26; prodigies &#x26; cursings of their foes&#x2014;&#x201C;many women like furies running to &#x26; fro in dismal habits, with their hair loose about their shoulders holding torches in their hands&#x201D;:<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Intercursantibus feminis; in modum Furiarum veste ferali, crinibus deiectis faces praeferebant</hi></foreign>&#x201D; (&#x201C;women flitting between the ranks; in the style of Furies in robes of deathly black and with dishevelled hair, they brandished their torches&#x201D;), Tacitus (d. after <date when="0117-00-00"><hi rend="small-caps">a.d.</hi> 117</date>), Roman historian, <hi rend="italic">Annals</hi>, XIV, 30.</note> and lastly you have a fit catastrophe provided for you, and many happy contrasts&#x2014;between the simple unpolished Britons and luxurious adventures of the Roman armies, the injured Boadicea, and the wicked tyrants for whom she was injured&#x2014;the collision of native fervour and desperate resolution against military discipline, and warlike glory.&#x2014; I do wish you would set about the consideration of it. I have set it forth very wretchedly here; I am quite confident you would think far better of it, if you saw the histories which describe it fully. Do undertake it; and send to me for all books whatsoever connected with it. If I saw you&#x2014;I should have great hope to persuade you. I am sure you could make something fine of it. And what tho&#x2019; it should not be perfect&#x2014;as indeed your first attempt has little chance to be? It is better to <hi rend="italic">erect</hi> a hut than to <hi rend="italic">dream</hi> of erecting a palace.</p>
<p>Perhaps, however, I mistake the matter, and overrate the capabilities of the subject, because I could wish to know you engaged in <hi rend="italic">some</hi> subject, and if possible (I may as well confess it) in one of my suggesting. Give no heed then to my pleadings, beyond what the reason of the case directs: consider Boadicea with your own judgement and decide accordingly. I have another Tragedy in store for you:&#x2014;but not to-night; that unmelodious Watchman is saying or singing something about &#x201C;one o&#x2019;clock&#x201D;; you shall have &#x201C;Perkin Warbeck&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Perkin Warbeck (<hi rend="italic">ca</hi>. <date when="1474-00-00">1474</date>&#x2013;<date when="1499-00-00">99</date>), pretender to the English crown, claimed to be Richard, Duke of York, son of Edward IV. He was executed in <date when="1499-00-00">1499</date> after two attempts to gain the throne. He was the subject of several plays and other works. Carlyle could refer here to Thomas Gainsford&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">The True and Wonderful History of Perkin Warbeck</hi> (<date when="1618-00-00">1618</date>), or John Ford&#x2019;s tragedy, <hi rend="italic">The Chronicle History of Perkin Warbeck</hi> (<date when="1634-00-00">1634</date>).</note> to-morrow. I pray for soft sleep to you, and a glad awakening&#x2014;wherever you may be. <foreign>A Dieu</foreign>.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle was not mistaken in believing that Jane had dramatic talent, but it was chiefly a talent for comedy, and it found expression not in plays but in passages of letters and in her conversation.</note></p>

<salute>My dear Johnstone,</salute>
<p>I have this moment received your letter; and being able to relieve your anxieties about the period of the Trial, as well as desirous to lose no time in doing so, I am down answering you without any delay.</p>
<p>Be satisfied, then, that there is no <hi rend="italic">examination</hi> to take place, within so limited a space of time as a fortnight hence. The Presbytery-members only mean to <hi rend="italic">meet</hi> within a fortnight; to overhaul the matter then; and to appoint a day for deciding it, which will possibly be in June, probably in the end of May, and almost certainly not till after the General Assembly has risen. So proceed with your letters of recommendation&#x2014;and gird up your loins for scattering these <foreign><hi rend="italic">Hypodidascululi</hi></foreign> [little subordinate teachers] to the right and left, as if they were mere chaff, as indeed they are very nearly.</p>
<p>It is quite an erroneous view which you have formed of the terrors of this Trial: the probability to me seems rather that you will be the best Latinist in the Company; the Examinees having already shewn themselves abundantly, and the Examinators being nothing but the clergymen of the City, none of whom are very formidable in that line. Nor will your Recommendations fail of producing their proper effect: it is likely, I think, they may of themselves almost decide the business. Muster them, therefore, and marshal them in the best order, as soon as possible; and send them in to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> whenever they are ready. Murray says there is a good chance by some Bank-parcel or other, which travels weekly between you &#x26; us. This can easily be investigated.</p>
<p>And in the mean time, to make assurance doubly sure, I certainly do advise you to profit by your neighbourhood to so qualified a person as our worthy friend the Rector (for the news of whose recovery I thank you &#x26; rejoice with you)<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In his letter of <date when="1822-04-27">27 April</date>, Johnston had written: &#x201C;Mr Mitchell is getting stronger every day.&#x201D;</note> to furbish up your classical acquisitions, <pb id="pg-02-106" n="02:106"/>&#x26; scour away that &#x201C;rust,&#x201D; which there is no wonder certainly to find obscuring your powers, after so many moving accidents by flood &#x26; field as you have undergone for the last two years.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Johnston had written: &#x201C;I am not sure whether I shall have nerve enough to stand a comparative trial<supplied>[.]</supplied> I could have wished that recommendations had been sufficient but I shall come to a determination when I hear from you again which I hope will be in a few days<supplied>[.]</supplied> I have not been in the habit of teaching steadily for some years and my mind has been distracted so much by other objects that I am sensible of a rust upon my mind contaracted in consequence<supplied>[.]</supplied> This would tell against me in any immediate trial.&#x201D; Cf. also <hi rend="italic">Othello,</hi> I, iii.</note> The works put into your hand will be the common school-books most probably&#x2014; Horace, Virgil &#x26;c; and your Greek (if any) will I imagine be from the New Testament. I speak by guess however &#x26; not by command. Mitchell is a far better hand to give you hints than I.</p>
<p>In conclusion, my dear Johnstone, I bid you fear nothing. The people you have to deal with are honourable persons, and will use you tenderly; and for your competitors&#x2014;I would not have you once compared with those already examined, and the fresh ones are not at all likely to be numerous: indeed I should not be surprised to find you the <hi rend="italic">only</hi> fresh one: such is the indolence of the Directors&#x2014;with the single exception of Fleming. If you want any additional intelligence&#x2014;or any kind of service that I can manage for you here by hook or by crook,&#x2014;of course, I need not bid you command me. If you want nothing, I shall expect to see your packet of credentials (Do not neglect Duncan, Irving, Poole) arrive in a very short space. There is every rational prospect at present of your getting Oban School, and being very happy in it. Fleming has been very minute in asking about you <foreign><hi rend="italic">&#xE0; plusieurs reprises</hi></foreign> [several times]&#x2014;of course, I signified to him that you were a very shocking fellow.</p>
<p>But I must be done. I have just finished dinner (at least had when I began to write); and you know what a quick<supplied>[e]</supplied>ner of the intellectual faculties roast-beef is&#x2014;particularly to dyspeptic gentlemen. This will account for much of the peculiar judiciousness and brilliant sprightliness, for which this epistle is so striking. You will write to me at all events, by the packet. I bade you send it directed to my care; but if it be not ready before Thursday the 9<hi rend="italic">th</hi> ensuing, it will be more safe if directed at once to D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Fleming, as I have some intention of going to Glasgow during the Sacrament&#x2014;the <hi rend="italic">Occasion</hi>&#x2014;here. If it come by the Bank-parc<supplied>[el the]</supplied> difference will be less. At all chances, lose no time.</p>
<p>Irving, whom I have just stated my purpose to visit, shortly, is going to London for certain. You are likely to see him in Annandale during his passage. He is to get license there, and spend the month <pb id="pg-02-107" n="02:107"/>of June among his friends. There is a revenue of &#xa3;500 per annum waiting him at London, and great applause, which I have no doubt he will richly merit.</p>
<p>I myself am fighting with the blue Devils &#x26; the black, as valiantly as ever, and with no contemptible success. Health is returning to me by slow but steady degrees; and I am full of business. The translation of <hi rend="italic">Legendre</hi> is going thro&#x2019; the press in a leisurely manner: and I am fermenting some villainous cookery about the &#x201C;Commonwealth-times&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18211121-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1821-11-21">21 Nov. 1821</date></ref>; <ref target="volume-02/lt-18221028-TC-JBW-01">TC to JBW, <sic>early <date when="1822-11-00">Nov.</date></sic><corr>[<date when="1822-10-28">28 Oct.</date>]</corr></ref></note> which in due season I hope to make the nation drink of.

<salute>My dear Jack,</salute>
<p>I was hindered from writing to you last night, by the most ignoble of all causes, the presence of that small pragmatical Jurist,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Dalgliesh.</note> whose visits to me&#x2014;happily of rare occurrence&#x2014;seldom yield <hi rend="italic">the same</hi> degree of satisfaction to both parties concerned. I cannot altogether dislike the poor wight, for he is not without many goodish qualities, and aims after better things than the mere practitionery of Law: I only regret that he should select me for his Mentor, especially when actually enduring the operation of so much speculation upon ephemeralities&#x2014;so feeble and so fearfully compensating its shallowness by its breadth. He does not afflict me, however, above once a week or so; being chained to his desk in general, or doing the errands of his petty-fogging Principal in the mighty deep of Attorneyship here; a task of which himself even seems to feel very heartily sick. I wish the boy no harm at all.</p>
<p>Your paper came duly to hand. I thank you for the anxious punctuality you have shewn; and I am happy, on looking over the article,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John&#x2019;s translation of a part of Legendre.</note> to find that you have acquitted yourself so manfully; happy both for your sake, to see you possessed and going on to acquire so steady a knowledge of the English tounge and the art of composition,&#x2014;and for my own sake, to find the manuscript so well fitted for going directly to the Press. You need not be in such a quandary about the remainder: it will be here in time enough I daresay by the way of <hi rend="italic">Guyon&#x2019;s</hi> conveyance, that is, if it be here against the middle of this week; or it might come by the packet of the Commercial Bank, which leaves Annan every Wednesday: at any rate do not send it by the Mail unless I write for it expressly; the <hi rend="italic">hash</hi> Piper<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Almanack</hi> of <date when="1822-00-00">1822</date> gives John Piper &#x26; Co., contractors for the Royal Mail Coach, running thrice weekly between Edinburgh and Dumfries.</note> &#x26; his fellow &#x201C;proprietors&#x201D; Benson &#x26; other sinners of the Earth, should not have the power, more frequently than needs must be, of charging such good fellows as we, at the rate of 3/ for carrying two sheets of paper. At present, I am a pretty way ahead of the &#x201C;Devil,&#x201D; and shall keep so if Heaven will. I am already half thro&#x2019; the sixth Book.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-02-111" n="02:111"/>As for the Trigonometry, begin it when you like; I shall take your assistance joyfully,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; I again insist that you do not let it vex you over much, or consume your time too greatly. I am so kept with the thing, that no help will give me the faculty of serious study or any kind of permanent composition, till it be done: therefore it is not fit that you should throw good diligence after bad&#x2014;in labour which can at best be little more than intermission to me, not rest&#x2014;if it indeed do any thing but encourage my indolence, already more than sufficiently abundant.</p>
<p>You have not written me any long or full account of your walk &#x26; conversation, for a long while. See you try this soon. I care not what you write to me, so there be enough of it: but I want to have all your small passages, your goings out &#x26; comings in&#x2014;a sort of miniature picture of your whole mind &#x26; of the scenery in which it dwells &#x26; acts &#x26; suffers. Sit down to this work sometime, when you feel it will be more a relaxation than a task; &#x26; jot down every thing worthy or unworthy of recording, that you feel any care about.</p>
<p>My own condition is mending very greatly, on the whole: I have not had such a measure of health &#x26; spirits for three years as I enjoy at present. It was the very making or rather saving of me that I came down here to live; no mortal but a nervous dyspeptic wretch can tell what heaven it is to escape from the tumult &#x26; stench &#x26; smoke &#x26; squalor of a City out into the pure ether and the blue sky, with green fields under your very window &#x26; bushy trees in the distance, and little noise but the gambols of happy children, the peaceful labours of spadesmen &#x26; the voice of singing birds. I sit down to my desk or my book, with the windows pulled down &#x26; up&#x2014;the fresh young air of May around, all Nature seeming to awake like Beauty from her couch; and my very heart is glad sometimes that I am delivered so as even partially to enjoy this pure &#x26; simple pleasure. I go down &#x26; bathe every morning before breakfast, when I can effect it; which has been once daily for the last three days, the distance not being above a mile, and the water clear as glass. This I find to be a most excellent practice. Yesterday I fell in with Waugh on the beach, his broad fat face appearing among the Newhaven fishing-craft, just as I emerged. (I should have said I did not get down yesterday till noon). Waugh had been calling for me, &#x26; missing his purpose, had advanced to the farend. I proposed going home directly: but Waugh fixed his eye on a monstrous <foreign><hi rend="italic">Meerswine</hi></foreign> (porpoise, or <hi rend="italic">purpose</hi> as they call it) which some fishers had just flayed; and being smit with the lust of knowledge, <pb id="pg-02-112" n="02:112"/>he insisted on dissecting the carcase to discover its anatomical structure. It would have made the weeping Philosopher<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Heraclitus.</note> himself smile to see Waugh gutting this monster of the Deep&#x2014;up to the elbows almost in gore &#x26; filth, descrying with a rapturous shout the various mid-riffs &#x26; puddings and cats-collops of its bestial belly&#x2014;stretching its guts along the gravel &#x26; measuring their length with a measuring-reed (made of sea-tangle&#x2014;one of the small-guts of the beast was like a short days journey in length&#x2014;some where about sixty feet if I recollect)&#x2014;the whole of this amid a crowd of brown fishermen, idle serving maids &#x26; scrubby boys, who eyed Waugh with astonishment &#x26; awe, and stood waiting <hi rend="italic">till</hi> he would extract the oil or ambergris or balm or precious stone, for which they thought sure he must be digging so painfully. I tired of it, or he would have struck upon a young shark also, which attracted his attention, by similar allurement. Waugh is the placidest man on Earth for certain: at the instant when he was gutting this shapeless husk of stinking flesh, I believe he could not have commanded <hi rend="italic">sixpence</hi> any where in Nature. Yet he minds not, living on Hope.</p>
<p>The Bullers &#x26; I go on very well together: they are really good creatures and pleasant to be near, tho&#x2019; they do not stick to their learning as I could wish. I have never yet calculated on the absolute certainty of my engaging in their family. I can do it or not do it, as occasion serves; which is the fine way to be in. If this stomach-disorder (&#x201C;the <hi rend="italic">baddest</hi> disorder that follows the <foreign><hi rend="italic">Kyercage</hi></foreign> [carcass]&#x201D; as an old blind Irishman called it yesterday) will but be kind enough to take its leave; then <foreign><hi rend="italic">basta</hi></foreign> [enough]!&#x2014;I care not for any man or thing!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Send my love to Mainhill, when you have a chance; I long for the Carrier that I may get eggs and cakes. Tell them to send my <foreign>jane</foreign><note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Also <hi rend="italic">jean</hi> or <hi rend="italic">jain</hi>. A twilled cotton cloth used for overalls, undergarments, etc.</note> trowsers &#x26; as many cotton socks as they can raise&#x2014;if any. Will you or Alick also write to Shaw of Dumfries for another pair of shoes exactly like the last pair, or just one hairsbreadth longer? He may send them out to Ecclefechan at his leisure; from whence they may find their way hither. I have detained you long Jack &#x26; <hi rend="italic">must</hi> now withdraw. I am glad our Mother&#x2019;s bonnet fits, I need not bid you be kind to her by every way you can.</p>

<salute>My dear Sir</salute>
<p>Your last letter passed me on my way to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> on Saturday, and only reached me on my return on Wednesday evening. You are ready to get into a mighty passion are you not? but stay a moment till you hear my defence.</p>
<p>I did not know I was going to town till a few hours before I set out; so that I had no time to instruct you of my intentions<supplied>[.]</supplied> While there my forenoons were entirely occupied in shopping, making calls, running after D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Chalmers, walking to Slateford, <note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Then a village near Edinburgh on the water of Leith and the Union Canal, now a suburb of Edinburgh.</note> and seeing the Panorama of Naples,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Barker, an Edinburgh artist, had exhibited the first panorama, with artificial lighting and props, in <date when="1788-00-00">1788</date>. People paid admission to the spectacles. Some showed views of London; others sea fights, the battles of Napoleon, etc. His son, Henry A. Barker (<date when="1774-00-00">1774</date>&#x2013;<date when="1856-00-00">1856</date>), continued the exhibitions. His panorama of Naples was first shown in <date when="1820-00-00">1820</date>.</note> (which, by the way, if you have not seen you ought to see). My afternoons in dining out, or with a party at home&#x2014; Had I been alone I could have arranged my time otherwise, and more to my own satisfaction; but my motions being dependent on my Mother it was utterly impossible for me to afford you one half hour, although <hi rend="italic">I really wished it</hi>. I hope I need not say more. I have found you a reasonable being of late&#x2014;as such then I shall treat you&#x2014;</p>
<p>You were not better pleased with my last letter than I am with yours. Write always thus, speak always thus, and you will not find me the weak, inconsistent Being you take me for&#x2014; The affectionate interest you take in my welfare can be disagreeable to me only when it seems likely to prove hurtful to yourself&#x2014; But no more of this hateful subject. I trust we understand each other at last. and I may now enjoy your friendship without the dread of finding it one day converted into enmity&#x2014;</p>
<p>My mind is still in an evil way&#x2014; I came home full of wise resolutions&#x2014; The dust, and bustle, and follies of Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> made my heart turn again to study and retirement. I thought to rise at five on Thursday <pb id="pg-02-114" n="02:114"/>morning. but fatigue made my head bad. I slept till nine&#x2014; I opened &#x2018;Mary Stewart&#x2019;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably Schiller&#x2019;s (<date when="1800-00-00">1800</date>), but Alfieri also wrote a <hi rend="italic">Mary Stewart</hi> which Carlyle knew about at this time.</note> after breakfast but Dr Fiffe<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-02/lt-18230308-JBW-EA-01">JBW to <sic>ES</sic><corr>EA</corr>, <date when="1823-03-08">8 March 1823</date></ref>.</note> interrupted me, and teazed me to play at shuttlecock till I consented&#x2014; When we had finished: I observed the Piano open and Lord Byron&#x2019;s &#x2018;fare thee well&#x2019; (my favorite song)<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Written by Byron early in <date when="1816-00-00">1816</date> after the separation from his wife and lamenting the loss of his wife and child.</note> staring me in the face: I sat down and played and sung badly till dinner time. The evening I spent as I spend too many, at an odious tea party. and by the time that I had heard little Charles Terrot<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The son of Charles Hughes Terrot (<date when="1790-00-00">1790</date>&#x2013;<date when="1872-00-00">1872</date>), later bishop of Edinburgh.</note> say his prayers and got him put to bed my day was gone! And so have gone the following ones. Since my return I have read Atala,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Chateaubriand&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Atala, ou les amours de deux sauvages dans le d&#xE9;sert</hi> (Paris, <date when="1801-00-00">1801</date>).</note> <hi rend="italic">twelve lines</hi> of Mary Stewart; written two pages of <hi rend="italic">two Novels</hi>, and four lines of an ode to Whilhelmina and moreover I have darned two rents in my gown behold the fruit of my resolution&#x2014;the sum total of my labours. But I am resolved to make a vigorous effort tomorrow for it fills me with shame to lead a life like this (my horse is lame which is greatly in my favour)&#x2014;</p>
<p>I like your project exceedingly&#x2014; Do let us set about it forthwith&#x2014; I admire your lines upon Napoleon very much and feel grateful to you for the kindness you there show him; for I am sure it is for my sake you have dealt with him so mercifully&#x2014; Were I selfish I would almost regret you sent me these<supplied>[&#x2014;]</supplied>they have made me so dissatisfied with my own. I do not like Atala&#x2014; What tempted you to send me such nonsense?</p>
<p>M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Irving told me you thought of entering the lists with Plutarch.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In writing biographies.</note> Have you <hi rend="italic">that</hi> project still in view. I liked it much. It is a pity you should allow year after year to glide away without making any vigorous effort to become known&#x2014; You may suppose my wish to see my friends famous is one of the effects of my ruling foible&#x2014;but surely there is nothing weak in longing to see those I love happy and filling the station in life Nature designed them for&#x2014; I send you a little silly translation: of the verses you gave me long ago<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-02/lt-18220527-TC-JBW-01">TC to JBW, <date when="1822-05-27">27 May</date></ref>.</note>&#x2014; Don&#x2019;t laugh excessively at it. But write me a better that I may profit by discovering its defects<supplied>[&#x2014;]</supplied> Give me a <hi rend="italic">subject</hi> the next time you write.&#x2014;</p>
<p>Forgive this very stupid letter. I am labouring under a severe <pb id="pg-02-115" n="02:115"/>

<salute>My dear Friend,</salute>
<p>I kept looking out for you or your Mother, almost every day last week; not once suspecting that you could visit Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> and leave it, without communicating that event to so important a person as myself. It were unprofitable, not to say absurd, to make any kind of outcry about this occurrence now; and very absurd to charge you with any blame in the matter: another time, however, I hope for better fortune.</p>
<p>I have little leisure for writing to-day; only I could not defer sending you Sismondi&#x2019;s book, which I hope you will peruse with some profit as well as enjoyment. It is equally remote from the <hi rend="italic">nonsense</hi> of Atala, and from the rude, melancholy vastness of that famous work&#x2014;otherwise in truth so full of gross deformities. Sismondi is a lively, dapper, elegant, little fellow full of good sense and learning and correct sentiment: he resembles our Jeffrey somewhat&#x2014;a <hi rend="italic">clever</hi> man, with rather less of natural talent than Jeffrey has, and about ten times as much knowledge and culture. You must read his Treatise, if possible; were it but for the sake of the Italians, in whose literature he is extremely versant.</p>
<p>It gives me great pleasure to find you so hearty in our poetical project: I trust good will come of it to us both. Hardly any creature is born without some thrills of poetry in his nature, which practice &#x26; instruction might enable him to express: and surely it were delightful, if when the mind feels so inflamed or overpowered in the various turns of this its confused and fluctuating existence,&#x2014;astonished at the stupendous aspect of the universe&#x2014;charmed, saddened, tortured in the course or in the prospect of its own great and gloomy and mysterious destiny,&#x2014;it could embody those emotions, which now serve only to encumber and depress it, in music and imagery, in &#x201C;thoughts that breathe &#x26; words that burn&#x201D;;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Gray, &#x201C;Progress of Poesy,&#x201D; III, iii, 4.</note> so gratifying, by employing, its own <pb id="pg-02-116" n="02:116"/>best faculties; and brightening its own sensations, by causing all around to share in them. Nature, it is true, makes one right Poet seldom&#x2014;scarcely in the hundred years; but she makes a thousand rhymers in the day, with less or more of poetry in each. Our attempt then is not too arduous: I predict, that if we persevere, we shall both succeed in making very tolerable verses, <hi rend="italic">perhaps</hi> something more than tolerable; and this itself I reckon a very pleasing &#x26; harmless &#x26; very ornamental acquirement. Many a time I have wished that, when ruining my health with their poor lean triangles &#x26; sines &#x26; tangents &#x26; fluxions and calculi, I had but been writing any kind of doggerel however weak: it would have imp<supplied>[r]</supplied>oved the understanding, at least <hi rend="italic">mine</hi> I am sure, quite as much or more&#x2014;that is<supplied>[,]</supplied> left it where it was; and <hi rend="italic">now</hi>, I might have been inditing odes and dithyrambics by the gross! The past is gone for aye: but&#x2014;&#x201C;better late than never!&#x201D;&#x2014;as the adage runs. Do not think me altogether crazy: I am no poet, &#x201C;have no genius,&#x201D; I know it well; but I <hi rend="italic">can</hi> learn to make words jingle when ever I think fit; and by the blessing of Heaven, we two will try it now in concert as long as we like.</p>
<p>I wish therefore you would meditate some plan, some terms &#x26; conditions for carrying it on. Shall we prescribe the subject alternately? And should it be a <hi rend="italic">specific</hi> subject that is prescribed&#x2014;or merely the <hi rend="italic">class</hi> of subjects to which it must belong&#x2014;&#x201C;a descriptive piece,&#x201D; for instance,&#x2014;&#x201C;an incident&#x2014;pathetic&#x2014;tragical&#x2014;ludicrous&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;a character&#x2014;great&#x2014;bad&#x2014;&#x26;c&#x201D;&#x2014;or <hi rend="italic">some</hi> descriptive piece&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">some</hi> incident&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">some</hi> character? Or shall it merely be that each is to give in a certain quantity of verse within a stated time? Settle all this to your own satisfaction&#x2014;or leave it all unsettled if you like better. I have yet had no time to consider the business properly, or even to select a proper topic for our <foreign><hi rend="italic">coup d&#x2019;essai</hi></foreign> [first effort]. The most plausible task I can hit upon is a little article to be entitled <hi rend="italic">The Wish</hi>,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Jane&#x2019;s and Carlyle&#x2019;s poems by this title in <hi rend="italic">LL</hi>, II, 342&#x2013;44, 346&#x2013;48.</note> wherein we are to set forth respectively the kind of fate and condition we most long for&#x2014;and have some feeble expectation of attaining. Yours will be very different from mine, I know: It will be curious to compare notes, if we both deal honestly&#x2014;which is not necessary, however. Try this; and send it along when ready&#x2014;with another theme, so it be an easy one.</p>
<p>These little <foreign><hi rend="italic">parergies</hi></foreign> [work done on the side] and recreations will do you no harm, I am persuaded; yet I cannot help still wishing too see you employed in some more serious composition, while your stock of knowledge from books and other sources must be augmenting so <pb id="pg-02-117" n="02:117"/>rapidly. Did you think any thing about the essay on Mad. de Sta&#xEB;l? I am still of opinion that it would be a very fine exercise for you; and one you are well prepared for, having studied all her writings and feeling so deep an interest in all that concerns her. What is to hinder you from delineating your conception of her mind; saying all you feel about her chara<supplied>[cter]</supplied> as a thinker, as a poet, and still more as a woman; comparing her in all these respects both with the ordinary throng of mortals, and with all the distinguished females you have heard or formed any idea of? I really wish you would begin in sober prose, and do this for me as honestly and correctly as you possibly can. I inquired after her life for you to-day; but it could not be had: however, if you engage to execute this undertaking, or otherwise desire to see the book, I will certainly find it. Consider this, at any rate; for I am eager about it, being convinced it would prove useful to you.</p>
<p>The interest you take in my unfortunate projects I feel with the gratitude due to your kind treatment of me on all occasions. That historico-biographical one<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably the history of the Commonwealth and Cromwell.</note> is still in embryo, but not yet abandoned. It seems quite indispensible that I should make an effort soon; I shall have no settled peace of mind till then. Often it grieves me to be besieged with Printers&#x2019;-Devils wanting <hi rend="italic">Copy</hi> (of Legendre) a &#x201C;most scientific&#x201D; treatise on Geometry which I unhappily engaged to translate long ago)&#x2014;with small boys studying Greek, and the many cares of life; when I <hi rend="italic">might</hi> be &#x26;c. Till <date when="1822-08-00">August</date>, I cannot even get this <hi rend="italic">Book</hi> fashioned into any shape, much less actually commenced. Meantime I read by snatches partly with a view to it. If ever, which is just possible, I get the mastery over these difficulties, which it is hard to strive with but glorious to conquer, I shall experience many an enviable feeling at the thought of having vindicated Jane for the encouragements she gave me.&#x2014; Excuse this silly idea&#x2014;for it is pleasant to me; and this dull letter, which I have already spun out too long.&#x2014; <closer><salute>I am ever your&#x2019;s,</salute></closer></p>
<name>Thomas Carlyle.</name>
<p>I am already too late for the Coach; so I shall take time enough with your translation of &#x201C;The Fisher.&#x201D; Be sure to send me abundance of such &#x201C;trash&#x201D; as your verses on the sunset, and those from Atala; it is of the kind I like.</p>
<p>If Shandy understood articulate speech, I would gladly return his compliments; for he is a dog of worth undoubtedly. He would give <pb id="pg-02-118" n="02:118"/>me welcome wherever he met me, which is all he can do, poor fellow,&#x2014;and more than every one of our human friends can do.</p>
<p>You should take a long ride, <hi rend="italic">every</hi> day&#x2014;your mother should insist on it.</p>

<p>The Fisher [underscored twice] is a very happy and ingenious translation, in many places; tolerable in all, considering the shackles you had to move in. I need not point out the weak parts of it; you see them clearly enough yourself, as I observe. It is more difficult to point out a remedy; scarce possible perhaps, without a farther departure from the letter of the original. Some alterations I have attempted with poor success. The chief ones are founded on a slight misconception, you seem to have fallen into, with regard to the <hi rend="italic">scene</hi> of the poem, which I apprehend to be not a river but the Sea; our hero not being an <hi rend="italic">Amateur</hi> Angler but a vulgar hard-working Fisherman, plying his craft in a dingy <hi rend="italic">Coble</hi>, afloat upon some fair bay (that of Naples, for example), where the beauty of the deep &#x26; the influence of the climate conspire to produce in the mind a certain indiscribable longing for the ocean, a kind of affection for it, which (Mad. de Sta&#xEB;l thinks&#x2014;see her Corrinne&#x2014;&#x26; Germany) Goethe has very ably represented &#x26; shadowed forth in this small tragedy.</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>After exhausting my stock of hypotheses to account for the Carrier&#x2019;s long delay&#x2014;supposing that he was sick or dead or drunk or in <pb id="pg-02-123" n="02:123"/>jail&#x2014;that <hi rend="italic">Bobby</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The carrier&#x2019;s pony.</note> had grown spavined &#x26;c &#x26;c; I was agreeably surprised this morning by the arrival of a tall able-bodied Porter bringing evidence that Farries was still <foreign><hi rend="italic">manting</hi></foreign> [stammering], and my friends at Mainhill as well &#x26; kind as ever. I have since been teaching, bathing &#x26;c; and two hours, which are now at my own disposal, I gladly devote to sending you my news. The box, at least one as good, I have already sent back long ago, by the <hi rend="italic">Moluimbo</hi> Porter in the morning.</p>
<p>You make a great work about the little Junius, my brave &#x26; proud young man: it cost me nothing, being given me by the fat bookseller Boyd;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Boyd of Oliver and Boyd.</note> it was worth to me nothing; and I thought it might not be quite useless to you&#x2014;that is all. The list of books<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For the Ecclefechan Library.</note> you send me I shall be most prompt to purchase on the easiest terms possible, and I mean to set about the needful inquiries directly. Knox you will find in the Box, I b<supplied>[r]</supplied>ought in many weeks ago. There is one of the works mentioned in your list, which I cannot make out; &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Raleys</hi>&#x201D; Shipwreck it seems to be, and <hi rend="italic">Raley</hi><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Norton suggests (p. 218 n.) that Alick probably wanted Captain James Riley&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Narrative of the Loss of the American Brig &#x201C;Commerce&#x201D; on the West Coast of Africa</hi>, 2nd ed. (London, <date when="1817-00-00">1817</date>).</note> is a man I never heard of. Write it more distinctly next-time, or give Jack in charge to transmit the name from Annan if he send me a letter sooner.</p>
<p>I would not have you be in anxiety about the state of your intellectual culture: I assure you it seems to me to proceed at a most respectable rate; and as to the reading of books, I may remind you how little that of itself will perfect any man; how much is to be learned by daily observation, and solitary reflection, which no book can give us; how much more valuable is the strong good sense of a true man, the minute &#x26; ever-present knowledge of his duties in every emergency, and the firm purpose to act accordingly&#x2014;than all the mere <hi rend="italic">learning</hi> which School or College ever taught. I have no doubt you will find abundant time to read, if you improve it all; you have within a year or two already mastered the elements of correct composition and general knowledge&#x2014;can now write a letter <hi rend="italic">well</hi>, and understand the outlines of history &#x26; literature; you have men around you to study&#x2014;a heart within you &#x26; a world without to survey; and your natural talents for doing all this are good. Be of good cheer then, boy; go on discharging your duties in the same diligent manful manner you have done hitherto&#x2014;improve your faculties as you have opportunity; and be sure of acting at a future day that honourable part in life, which <pb id="pg-02-124" n="02:124"/>your rational ambition makes you wish to act.&#x2014; But I am preaching, when I should be <hi rend="italic">telling</hi>: let me cease for once!</p>
<p>I have gone on enjoying very considerable improvement of health, since I wrote last. The weather may be called delightful at present; Sun shining, small breeze blowing, ground green <hi rend="italic">as leeks</hi>. My windows &#x201C;look to the Forth,&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Burns&#x2019;s &#x201C;I Look to the North,&#x201D; l. 1.</note>&#x2014;which I do not see however, tho&#x2019; I used to hear its hoarse and everlasting voice in winter winds&#x2014;and I get a view nightly of the Sunset. It is very grand to witness the great red fiery disk, sinking like a giant to sleep, among his crimson curtains of cloud&#x2014; with the Fife &#x26; Ochil hills for his bedstead! I often look at him till I could almost break forth into tears, if it would serve&#x2014;or into some kind of poetical singing, if I could <supplied>[sin]</supplied>g any. To return to prose, the good weather <supplied>[and the]</supplied> sea-bathing, and the eight miles I have to walk daily are doing my poor shattered carcase no small service: in a year at this rate, I might be as well as you.</p>
<p>I am also very busy, which is another great thing. That lubber Translation is proceeding at an easy tho&#x2019; irregular rate; then I read some for the &#x201C;Civil Wars&#x201D;&#x2014;which alas! are still like birds in the shell&#x2014;and may be I dread for many months. The Bullers consume a good portion of every day not by any means unpleasantly. They are very clever good-hearted <foreign><hi rend="italic">Callants</hi></foreign> [youngsters]; and like me very well. I never count firmly on engaging with the family, and&#x2014;which is the fine way&#x2014;I can go on <hi rend="italic">whether or not</hi>. I have few or no companions that I value much here; one or two decent fellows Murray, Galloway the Philomath (who has now become indeed long been exceedingly civil), and one or two of the like sort, beat up my quarters on a Saturday perhaps. They are inoffensive characters, &#x26; I feel their goodwill; but have no time to bestow on them. The unhappy Waugh is still in the city: he expects his Doctors Degree very soon,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Medical Graduates, <date when="1705-00-00">1705</date>&#x2013;<date when="1845-00-00">1845</date></hi>, lists John Waugh as having taken his degree this year.</note> and to be free <hi rend="italic">at last</hi>: Heaven grant he were so! tho&#x2019; I see not how it can <foreign>come to pass</foreign>. He is as nearly cracked as any young person I ever saw. One might upbraid his obdurate stupidity &#x26; indiscretion&#x2014;but his present state of inquietude would shut the mouth of a savage.</p>
<p>I have now only to desire a long letter as soon as you possibly can; to send my Compliments &#x26; <closer><salute>Love to all Mainhill; &#x26; to assure my good Alick, that I remain,</salute></closer></p>
<p><closer><salute>His affectionate Brother, /</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle&#x2014;</name></p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I feel I am going to be very hurried, yet I cannot let slip this opportunity of scribbling you a few lines however brief &#x26; insufficient to let you know the state of my affairs for some time; and to thank you for these new proofs of your constant attention to me.&#x2014; I <foreign><hi rend="italic">hushed</hi></foreign> a great many things into the Box, which however you need be in no haste to send back, as I am sufficiently provided by the supplies of to-day. Perhaps it were better to send merely letters by Farries next time; &#x26; to bid him call for the little Box to carry home with him, seeing it is of a more reasonable size than the one I sent. I need no more socks &#x26;c at present, having purchased three pair the other night, which together with yours make up a very reasonable stock. I gave 1/4 a pair for them&#x2014;dear I suppose&#x2014;for they are thin as nets, but cool &#x26; agreeable in this warm weather. I hope Shaw will not neglect the shoes I wr<supplied>[o]</supplied>te to Jack about: I shall soon want them.</p>
<p>These matters of business being adjusted, I proceed to give you some sketch of my way of doing at present, in which I know you ever feel a tender &#x26; truly motherly interest. It will give you pleasure to know that I continue progressively improving in that most important of qualities, good health. The bathing does me great good; and you need be under no apprehensions of my drowning; for the bottom is smooth shelving sand or pebbles, I stay but a moment in the water, and never go near the end of my depth: besides I swim if need were, which is not. Unfortunately my mode of sleeping is too irregular to admit of my bathing constantly before breakfast; tho&#x2019; I manage this often, and almost always go some time in the day. Small noises disturb me, and keep me awake tho&#x2019; I always get to sleep at last; and happily such disturbances occur but rarely. Some two weeks ago, I had a little adventure with an ugly <hi rend="italic">messin</hi>, which a crazy half-pay Captain had thought proper to chain in his garden or rather grass-plot, about twenty yards from my window. The pug felt unhappy in its new situation; began repining very pitifully in its own way&#x2014;at one time snarling grinning yelping as if it cared not whether it were hanged then or to-morrow&#x2014;at another <foreign>whinging</foreign> [whimpering] howling squealing as if it meant to excite the compassion of the Earth at large&#x2014; This at intervals for the whole night. By five o&#x2019;clock in the morning, <pb id="pg-02-126" n="02:126"/>I would have given a guinea of gold for its hind legs, firm in my right hand, by the side of a stone-wall. Next day the crazy Captain removed it, being threatened by the street at large with prosecution if he did not: but on the evening of the second day, growing tired of keeping the cur in his own kitchen, he again let it out; and just as I was falling asleep about one o&#x2019;clock, the same musical&#x2014;&#x201C;most musical most melancholy&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Il Penseroso,&#x201D; l. 62.</note>&#x2014;serenade aroused me from my vague dreamings. I listened about half a<supplied>[n]</supplied> hour; then rose indignantly, put on my clothes, went out &#x26; charged the watchman to put an instant stop to that accursed thing; the watchman <hi rend="italic">could</hi> not for the world interfere with a gentleman&#x2019;s rest at that hour, but next morning, he would certainly &#x26;c; I asked to be shown the door, and pulling the crazy Captains bell most powerfully about six times, his servant at length awoke, and inquired with a tremulous voice, <hi rend="italic">What</hi> was it? I alluded to the Dog, and demanded the instant, the total, the everlasting removal of it, or to-morrow I would see whether justice were in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> or the shadow of British law in force. &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Do</hi> you hear that?&#x201D; said the Irish knight of the <foreign>ratch</foreign> [iron rasp] &#x26; lanthorn; She heard it &#x26; obeyed; and no wretched <hi rend="italic">messin</hi> has since disturbed my slumbers. This it is to be ill-natured!&#x2014;</p>
<p>You ask about my home-coming; but this must be a very uncertain story for a while. I cannot count on any such thing till Legendre be done, and the Buller people arrived; and in the event of my engaging with the latter, my period of absence must of course b<supplied>[e brief.]</supplied> However there is good &#x26; cheap conveyance to Dumfries daily, and it shall go hard if I do not steal a week or so to spend at Home.</p>
<p>I was in Glasgow some time ago, seeing Irving and all the rest of them. It was during this period that Mr Lawson called on me, &#x26; found me not: present my best thanks &#x26; services to him for so doing. They have been holding their General Assembly here the other week, had Dr Chalmers among them &#x26;c: I did not see any thing of it, except a few Beef-eaters, pages with cocked hats &#x26;c dangling after the Commissioner&#x2019;s chair. The Commissioner himself I understand to be one of the meanest knaves north of the Tweed.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Commissioner was the Earl of Morton. Chalmers (see also <ref target="volume-02/lt-18220517-TC-JBW-01">TC to JBW, <date when="1822-05-17">17 May</date></ref>) spoke on the erection of a Chapel of Ease in the parish of St. John; and in his important second speech propounded his basic proposition on pauperism that support for relief should be confined to certain church collections and not be dependent on rate assessment.</note>&#x2014; But <hi rend="italic">there</hi> is Six o&#x2019;clock, my hour of marching. Farewell, my dear Mother! It is the dearest blessing of my lot that I have you to write to, &#x26; to care for me. <pb id="pg-02-127" n="02:127"/>Send me a long account of all you do &#x26; feel. My Father has not written to me for a long time: give my love to him and to all the rest, Mag, Jamie, Mary, Jane &#x26; Jenny. I suppose they are busy planting potatoes or hoeing turnips, or they would write to me. <closer><salute>I am ever, My dear Mother,</salute></closer></p>

<dateline><place>3. Moray-street</place>, Wednesday-Evening [<date when="1822-06-05">5 June 1822]</date>&#x2014;</dateline>
<salute>My dear Alick,</salute>
<p>Some portion of monday I spent in writing two long letters, one to my Mother, a second to you; at eventide I diverged with them from my straight path into the Harlot&#x2019;s lodgings&#x2014;and found that the Knave had been gone since Saturday-night! I partly suspected the <hi rend="italic">hash</hi> of a Porter, when he brought me the box in the morning: &#x201C;Farries&#x201D; he said &#x201C;might <hi rend="italic">able</hi> <supplied>[perhaps]</supplied> gang awa&#x2019; whanever his cairt was ready.&#x201D; He had already <foreign><hi rend="italic">ganged</hi></foreign> eight-&#x26;-forty hours; and this Rawbones wished to cloak his laziness from me, having already enough hood-winked the poor Waffler. I inspected the Inn-Warehouse, to see if a box were there which I had sent up in the forenoon by the lying Porter; found it safe; and growling audibly at the poor confused moonstruck Cadger<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The carrier.</note> for his stupidity, I determined to write to you by the Post, that very night, that so you might be under no uneasiness about me when Geordie returned empty-handed. That night, I think, the Bullers kept me later than usual; next night (last) John Waugh detained me with his thousand woes; and I am only executing my purpose even now. I trust this will reach you duly, and find you all&#x2014;as the last left you&#x2014;well and moving about in the old way.</p>
<p>I have very little of importance to tell you, now that I <hi rend="italic">have</hi> begun writing; except, what I know will be welcome &#x26; not unmeaning news to you, that I am still continuing to improve in health &#x26; spirits, going my stated rounds of duty, reading a very little, writing still less, and cherishing long projects which fill the future for me as completely as the present is filled. I do not recollect of ever being a very light-hearted character; but I reckon myself about as cheerful at present as I have been for many years. I laugh no great deal, could not sing or dance, but I feel a constant movement in my mind, a sleepless activity <pb id="pg-02-128" n="02:128"/>half-pleasant half-painful, which I reckon to be the right state for a young man,&#x2014;at least it is generally my state when I enjoy any thing like health. I know you are thankful along with me for this precious deliverance; and pray along with me that it may be complete: how grateful ought I to be for the sympathy you have shewn in my adversity, and the joy wherewith you hail any dawn of returning fortune. I kept predicting better days when the weather was black enough in my sky: I have something like a beginning of more solid reason now; and I still predict in the same strain, and think a few years will do much for us all. In fact, when I compare the qualifications which all of us without exception in our several departments possess, with the qualifications which serve to get happiness &#x26; respectability to others in theirs,&#x2014;I cannot for a moment doubt the ussue <supplied>[issue]</supplied>. We are all to be good men &#x26; true, having wherewith to make good our own liberties in this world, fearing or hating or envying no man: what can a son of Adam wish for more? A person of that stamp might &#x201C;stand before Princes&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Prov. 22:29.</note>&#x2014;and Princes would get little credit by comparing with him.</p>
<p>But my sheet is filling apace: I must leave moralities. Your last letter was short, and far separated in date from its forerunner. I trust next time you will give me many ample details about the state of affairs at Mainhill; how you are employed, what occupies your minds &#x26; hands; what little adventures befal you; what is the general aspect of things in your neighbourhood. No one of these points is without an interest in my eyes, which you would have difficulty in conceiving. I am told the &#x201C;sacred Bard&#x201D; Charlie Rae is in the way of passing thro&#x2019; the Press with a volume of jingle!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Horace, <hi rend="italic">Odes</hi>, IV, ix, 28. Alick, in his letter of <date when="1822-01-03">3 Jan.</date>, had spoken of Charlie Ray, that he was &#x201C;on the very eve of publishing his works as he calls them.&#x201D;</note> The Genius of our Native Dale has long mourned in sack<supplied>[c]</supplied>loth &#x26; ashes,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf.

In seriousness&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">is</hi> the creature getting his metre printed? I can scarce give credit to such an unaccountable business.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-02-129" n="02:129"/>But leaving the <hi rend="italic">Literary World</hi>, or rather taking it up another side&#x2014;let me hasten to assure you that I will <supplied>[shew]</supplied> myself most prompt in providing those books for the Ecclefechan Library, whereof you give me a list. Knox might already have been in your hands (price 7/&#x2014;bound&#x2014;a good old copy), if the Carrier had done his duty: it is now lying in the Box at his quarters, and will surely reach you next time he returns. The book entitled &#x201C;Shipwreck&#x201D; I cannot rightly make out. Is it &#x201C;Raley&#x2019;s&#x201D;? or whose? You must mention it next time. I do not expect to find them second hand&#x2014;but I can promise to get them new at as cheap a rate as any one.&#x2014; When Geordie comes back, you will get me a large packet of letters furbished up, and I shall try to have the books in a state of readiness to send by return. Explain to my Mother how I had written to her at great length, &#x26; could not get the letter sent. I will yet send it &#x26; yours, if any opportunity occu<supplied>[r]</supplied>s. Say to her also, that I find the bathing, which is on a smooth bottom &#x26; safe as the Bank of England, to be exceedingly beneficial; and the Stomach, poor fellow, is behaving as well as could be expected from a gentleman of his <foreign><hi rend="italic">teachous</hi></foreign> (litigious) temper.

<salute>My dear Friend,</salute>
<p>After a very admirable display of patience, I was rewarded one evening, while I thought of no such thing, by the sight of your much valued packet. &#x201C;That Ass&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On Carlyle&#x2019;s very first visit to Haddington, when he met Jane, he saw Augusta Sibbald, and he and Irving joked about the possibility of Carlyle&#x2019;s marrying her. See <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi>, II, 87.</note> I never liked; but then I absolutely hated her, and wished fervently that she had either delivered you from her inane presence altogether, or at least timed her visit better. As it is, I give you thanks from the heart for your letter. It is quite delightful, in its way, for me to enjoy those little peeps you afford me here and there into your domestic doings. I see the &#x201C;feathers&#x201D; overshadowing your hat; I tremble at the &#x201C;four angry notes&#x201D; inflicted on your dressmaker; imagine the &#x201C;nose &#x26; ear&#x201D; of the Conqueror of the Goths; and think what I would give to hear you practicing never so &#x201C;badly&#x201D; the Themas of Mozart &#x26; Beethoven. It is when letters are thrown off in that gay cheerful social way, that one has some pleasure in them.</p>
<p>I viewed your poetical despatches with a feeling made up of pleasure &#x26; surprize. This is greatly the best collection you have ever shewn me: if you go on at any thing like the same rate, I indeed may wish you &#x201C;a good journey&#x201D;&#x2014;but I shall not the less rejoice at your reaching the promised land&#x2014;tho&#x2019; myself still lingering in the wilderness. In fact I am quite ashamed, on considering your verses, to compare them, either in quantity or quality, with my own performance in the same period. I am certainly an idle knave, and shall never rhyme, or do any thing else, to right purpose. Your &#x201C;Wish&#x201D; is quite an emblem of your usual treacherous disposition. There you go on persuading us that you are growing a delightful romantic character&#x2014;alive to all the simple enjoyments of existence&#x2014;and prizing them above all others as they ought to be; and when you have fairly <hi rend="italic">led us in</hi>, and we are beginning to admire you in good earnest,&#x2014;we hear a suppressed titter, <pb id="pg-02-132" n="02:132"/>which dissipates the whole illusion, and tells us that we are&#x2014;poor fools! I like the accompanying pieces better; the lines beginning with &#x201C;I love&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;I love the mountain torrent dashing / Downwards in thunder loud and hoarse.&#x201D; See <hi rend="italic">LL</hi>, II, 344&#x2013;45.</note> the best of all. In these the ideas are brilliant, the language emphatic &#x26; sonorous, the rhythm very musical &#x26; appropriate. The little epigram from the Proven&#x26;ccedil;al Satyrist is also a favourite with me: it seems to be rendered with great spirit &#x26; liveliness.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi>, p. 345.</note> Ferdusi &#x26; the hesitating Lover are subjects which interest me less; but you have succeeded in translating both extremely well.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi>, p. 346.</note></p>
<p>It is truly gratifying to me to contemplate you advancing so rapidly in the path of mental culture. Proceed as you have begun; and I shall yet see the day, when I may ask with pride: Did not I predict this? There are a thousand peculiar obstacles&#x2014;a thousand peculiar miseries that attend upon a life devoted to the task of observing &#x26; feelings, and recording its observations &#x26; feelings&#x2014;but any ray of genius however feeble is the &#x201C;inspired gift of God&#x201D;; and woe to him or her that hides the talent in a napkin! that allows indolence or sordid aims to prevent the exercise of it, in the way designed by our allbountiful Parent&#x2014;the elevation of our own nature, &#x26; the delight or instruction of our fellow-mortals&#x2014;on a scale proportioned to our power! And look to the reward, even in the life that now is! Kings &#x26; Potentates are a gaudy folk that flaunt about with plumes &#x26; ribbons to decorate them, and catch the coarse admiration of the many-headed monster, for a brief season&#x2014;then sink into forgetfulness or often to a remembrance even worse: but the Miltons, the de Sta&#xEB;ls&#x2014;these <hi rend="italic">are</hi> the very salt of the Earth;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Matt. 5:13.</note> they derive their &#x201C;patents of Nobility direct from Almighty God,&#x201D; and live in the bosoms of all true men to all ages.</p>
<p>Alas! that it is so much easier to talk thus than to act in conformity to such rational maxims! I verily believe you are quite right in your estimate of me: I seem indeed to be a mere talker&#x2014;a <foreign><hi rend="italic">vox et pr<supplied>[a]</supplied>eteria nihil</hi></foreign> [a voice and nothing more]. Look at these most unspeakable jingles that I have sent you; and see the whole fruit of my labours since I wrote last. I declare it is shameful in myself; and barbarous in those stupid louts that waste my time away in their drivelling. Here was the best-natured &#x26; opaquest of Glasgow Merchants with me for a whole week!<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >David Hope. See <ref target="volume-02/lt-18220629-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1822-06-29">29 June</date></ref>.</note> He talked and&#x2014; But why should I trouble you with it? <pb id="pg-02-133" n="02:133"/>Simply I say this must not last. In a few weeks I shall be done with that blessed treatise on Geometry; and then, if I do not <hi rend="italic">attempt</hi> at least, I deserve to die as a fool dieth.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >2 Sam. 3:33.</note></p>
<p>These are shadows: let us turn to the sunshine. The siege of Carcassonne will hardly do, I fear; tho&#x2019; you shew a right spirit in aiming at it. The persecution of the Albigenses has little to distinguish it from other persecutions more connected with our sympathies, except a darker tinge of bloody-mindedness, and a degree of callous ferocity which would tend rather to disgust the mind, than to inflame or exalt it. Simon de Montfort &#x26; Fouquet are horrible rather more than tragical. To be sure the Count is a fine subject: but there are no peculiar incidents to work upon, and to paint the manners &#x26; feelings of those people, even if they were worth painting, would involve you in long laborious researches which would yield no fruit proportionate to the toil of gathering it.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Albigensian sect was persecuted constantly during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, beginning with a crusade against them (<date when="1209-00-00">1209</date>&#x2013;<date when="1229-00-00">29</date>), of which the siege of Carcassonne was part. Simon de Montfort (<hi rend="italic">ca.</hi> <date when="1160-00-00">1160</date>&#x2013;<date when="1218-00-00">1218</date>), the Count referred to, was a leader against the Albigenses. Fouquet is Folquet (or Foulque) de Marseille (?&#x2013;<date when="1231-00-00">1231</date>): a poet during his early years, in <date when="1205-00-00">1205</date> he became bishop of Toulouse and subsequently took a fanatical part in the persecution of the Albigenses.</note> I rather advise you therefore, to dismiss the subject altogether. Yet if you feel any deep emotions, see any magnificence of accompaniment which you could combine with it,&#x2014;tell me, and I will search you out all the information possible. So much depends on the natural bent of your own inclination&#x2014;it is so important to have this along with you in whatever you undertake, that a suggestion of your own should be preferred under many disadvantages to one from any other. A subject from our own history would answer best&#x2014;if we must have a historical subject. But why not one of pure invention? Or Why not try a Comedy, originating wholly incidents &#x26; characters from yourself?</p>
<p>You do not mention what Play of Schiller&#x2019;s you are reading, or whether I can help you in it at all. You also forgot to select any <hi rend="italic">theme</hi> for our next poetical effort; a speculation, in which, tho&#x2019; as I have said you are going to leave me entirely behind, I feel determined to go on. What if we trust to Fortune next time, and engage only to write <hi rend="italic">something</hi>&#x2014;name not given?&#x2014; I hope you will not keep me long: it was very kind in you to think of my wishes, &#x26; send the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> volume the moment it was finished. I would not harrass you or burden you <pb id="pg-02-134" n="02:134"/>however with my impatience; write to me when you <hi rend="italic">can</hi>; only think, if I were an absolute Monarch, <hi rend="italic">how</hi> often I would have you write.</p>
<p>Are you never coming back to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>? Some moments I am seized with the most vehement desire to see you once more; at other times I am very quiet.&#x2014; But surely I must conclude this most ugly &#x26; absurd of letters. I beg you to believe that I have not been so stupid for six months&#x2014;sore throats &#x26;c &#x26;c have quite undone me for some days.&#x2014; You will write when you have done with &#x201C;Bracebridgehall,&#x201D;<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Bracebridge Hall, or the Humourists</hi>, 2 vols. (London and New York, <date when="1822-00-00">1822</date>), by Washington Irving.</note> and send me your verses. The rest of Sismondi, I shall transmit forthwith.&#x2014; If you cannot conveniently read Washington [Irving] without farther cutting the leaves&#x2014;do it without scruple. Farewell! I am half asleep&#x2014;so excuse my blunders &#x26; miserable penmanship.</p>

<salute>My dear Jack,</salute>
<p>I must either borrow a few minutes from the Sunday, in order to send you my news, or I am like to find no other time for doing it. And after all I am not sure that this employment is much worse than the one I was last engaged in. Physically speaking, at least, it is much better; and morally, if we only view the life that now is. Three quarters of an hour ago, I was mewed up in Lady Yester&#x2019;s Church, frying with heat, and subject to the genial influence of fifteen hundred pairs of Lungs all exhaling their invigorating products against me; while for compensation I had the intellectual refreshment of hearing a black lean scarecrow of a Probationer illustrate &#x26; prove like Euclid himself &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">that</hi> all conditions of life have their own peculiar sorrows,&#x201D; a truth which most likely none of his audience ever dreamt of before. And here&#x2014;I am sitting under the shadow of my own roof, with the windows all up, a calm shower pattering around me; my dinner swallowed, and the pen in my hand to scribble whatsoever comes uppermost, for the behoof of one who cares for all that concerns me. &#x201C;Judge ye!&#x201D;</p>
<p>The parcel arrived by the Carrier last Wednesday; but I had no moment of time to answer it. I hope you have not paid Guyon any thing; for catching <foreign>time by the forelock</foreign>, his Porter had made Mrs <pb id="pg-02-135" n="02:135"/>Wilkie pay the whole charge from Annan inclusive before I had come home. And here, I cannot but remind you to lay it down as a principle, never to pay any Carrier except for what he delivers you: this saves all mistakes of that sort; which I trust have been avoided in this instance independently of it.</p>
<p>Your letter was exceedingly gratifying to me; I only regretted that you should allow me the pleasure of reading such a letter from you so very seldom. It were surely no impossible matter to sit down, once a fortnight or so, and write whatever you think or are engaged about&#x2014;whatever is filling up your existence, be it great or little. I am sure you would attempt more frequently, if you knew how welcome your letters are to me; particularly those which like the last appear dictated so unassumingly from the heart, and which give one so graphical and <hi rend="italic">naive</hi> a description of your little Burgh, and all the small characters <hi rend="italic">which</hi> move about it, and whose paths intersect your own. Upon the whole, however, I do admit, you have written very manfully last year; and I would not for the world that your letters to me should become a burden to you: let them be, as they have been hitherto, a solace &#x26; resting-spot for the tired &#x26; too solitary mind: only remember that they never fail to yield another party as much enjoyment as they yield yourself, and that so you are managing a joint concern in preparing or not preparing them.</p>
<p>But alas even this largest of sheets will not stand such work as I am now getting into! I must draw bridle in time. And to come to business at once&#x2014;I wish to say something definite to you about that Translation [of the Legendre book], and yet I hardly know what to say. At all events it will be impossible for me to get the copy and correct it &#x26; have you transcribe it again, before it goes to press. The people are beginning the Notes at this very period; and the first part of the Trigonometry will be wanted in two weeks at farthest&#x2014;particularly as I was stirring them up a few days ago, and forcing them to change their trot into a kind of canter. I believe they have now six men working close at it. So that, you observe, this sending the <hi rend="italic">ms.</hi> and resending it is out of the question; yet if you can insure yourself by any means of having the part already finished here before this day fortnight, it would of course be a considerable ease to me; and I should wait for it very gladly. Later than this, however, I dare not fix; lest your labour be in vain&#x2014;as the last leaf or two of Book V. was, having come just twelve hours behind its time. As to the correctness, and so forth&#x2014;I again repeat it was all well. In your Definitions and other places where you had done your best, I made scarcely any alteration <pb id="pg-02-136" n="02:136"/>whatever; and even the most crabbed passages I could easily have put to rights, if I had revised the <hi rend="italic">ms.</hi> before it went to Press. As it was, the whole additional labour of correction did not detain me two hours; and now Book V looks as well as any part of the volume. I regret that I could not send you the Proof-sheet &#x26; the Press-sheet that you might see the difference: if ever our Ecclef<hi rend="italic">n</hi> Carriers come to life again, I will certainly send them. But in this <hi rend="italic">ms.</hi>, if you send any, I shall request you to write the lines pretty widely apart (never minding how ill they are written); and by this means, I shall find it very easy to look over the whole before it is printed, and so to make it quite immaculate. These leaves you have sent me, look like the <hi rend="italic">very thing</hi> I assure you; just copy them over again introducing what corrections you think fit; and the formulas, except when they are long&#x2014;(as at page 347, which will come within your jurisdiction)&#x2014;in which case I have a notable expedient: I tear out the leaf itself, and stick it to my paper with sealing-wax, whereby I am enabled often to get on like clockwork thro&#x2019; the most cramp passages.&#x2014; Your &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">piriger</hi>&#x201D; is certainly very hard to understand&#x2014;turn the <hi rend="italic">p</hi> upside down &#x26; try it [&#x201C;<hi rend="italic">diriger</hi>&#x201D; written in margin]. I usually say &#x201C;we have&#x201D; or &#x201C;put&#x201D; or &#x201C;suppose&#x201D; or &#x201C;make&#x201D; before the sign =, tho&#x2019; not quite invariably&#x2014;&#x26; Legendre&#x2019;s &#x201C;1&#xB0;, 2&#xB0;&#x201D; I translate by &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">First., Secondly</hi>.&#x201D;&#x2014;write the lines widish however; and I shall manage it all.</p>
<p>Now my good brother Jack, it were very barbarous to keep thee toiling so, if it were interfering with any duty however slight. I entreat &#x26; command thee therefore if thou have any thing to do else, not to mind this; for really I can manage it excellently myself (yesterday I got thro&#x2019; above 20 pages of Notes&#x2014;and was tired to the bone); just write to me, and I shall go thro&#x2019; it like drift. You must write any way, to let me know <hi rend="italic">what</hi> is doing&#x2014; Observe also that even if you do go on to copy proceed not a line farther than the bottom of page 352&#x2014; &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">grandeur</hi></foreign> (magnitude in all cases) <foreign><hi rend="italic">des arcs</hi></foreign> a <foreign><hi rend="italic">et</hi></foreign> b.&#x201D; I shall begin with the next line myself, about the end of this week.</p>
<p>Bad luck to this Legendre! He has consumed all my paper, &#x26; I had a thousand things to say. When you write (some day this week), say simply &#x201C;I will do it&#x201D; or &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">thou</hi> [underscored twice] shall do it!&#x201D;&#x2014;and then go into other matters. I long to hear about all your studyings &#x26; transactions. Do you ever see Ben now? His French journal I have never seen or heard of: but most likely it will be a rag&#x2014;got up by two or three French Schoolmasters about London&#x2014;once <hi rend="italic">valets</hi> or travelling-tutors, now &#x201C;literary gentlemen of the first respectability.&#x201D;&#x2014; You <pb id="pg-02-137" n="02:137"/>do well to read Gillies;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably John Gillies (<date when="1747-00-00">1747</date>&#x2013;<date when="1836-00-00">1836</date>), Scottish historian and classical scholar.</note> but as for Hallam,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henry Hallam (<date when="1777-00-00">1777</date>&#x2013;<date when="1859-00-00">1859</date>), <hi rend="italic">A View of the State of Europe during the Middle Ages</hi>, 2 vols. (<date when="1818-00-00">1818</date>). Henry Hallam was the father of Tennyson&#x2019;s friend Arthur Hallam.</note> you may safely let him rest&#x2014;he is heavy as clay&#x2014;and you would relish him little or profit by him little till after reading Gibbon and various others. Washington Irving has a new Book &#x201C;Bracebridge-hall&#x201D; which is very good. You ought to read <hi rend="italic">all</hi> Scott&#x2019;s Novels at odd hours&#x2014;and Byron&#x2019;s poetry&#x2014;and Shakespear&#x2014;and Pope&#x2014;and the like. These things are of the very highest value.</p>
<p>You ask about my coming home in <date when="1822-08-00">August</date>: but this must depend on other wills than mine. The Bullers are not arrived yet, tho soon expected; and if we engage with each other, I fear I shall hardly get down. They do speak of going to Moffat-wells<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >There are three wells in the neighborhood of Moffat, in northern Dumfriesshire. One of these, Moffat Well, is in the center of the town.</note> for a time; in which case, I could easily mount the Beast &#x26; be at home some Saturday-afternoon: but all this is very uncertain. I think we shall make a bargain; the boys like me very well, and seem to be indeed very pleasant creatures&#x2014;the eldest <hi rend="italic">very</hi> clever. I have no doubt I shall be very contented (if I go there) in their house: my present duties are a pleasure rather than any thing else. As to health&#x2014;I am getting better steadily; the bathing does me good; I am busied over the head; and I have not been happier for many a year. The <hi rend="italic">Book</hi> of course is on the shelf for a time&#x2014;but it <hi rend="italic">will</hi> come down!&#x2014;of course you will make all arrangements in due time for leaving Annan: I anticipate great pleasure from having you beside me, next winter. Even living with the Bullers, I may see you daily.&#x2014; Write soon; and tell me every thing about the Mainhill friends&#x2014;to whom my warmest love. <closer><salute>I am always Your affect<hi rend="italic">e</hi> brother.</salute></closer></p>
<name>Th: Carlyle&#x2014;</name>
<ps><p>Tell me pointedly whether you have got a pair of jain trowsers. These which some kind friend has sent me, are too late, for I was already provided; besides they fit me very ill, so I shall make you a present of them&#x2014;if you have none, with many thanks (and full payment) to the Benefactor that attended so carefully to my wishes in providing them. Tell me clearly next time, and I will send them.</p>
<p>It is thundering a little, &#x26; raining much; but I hope it will be fair weather by the time my tea is over, and I hear Little Wilkie jingling with it even now. The small Jurist (poor <hi rend="italic">messin</hi>!) comes little near <pb id="pg-02-138" n="02:138"/>me now; and wants little when he does come, except that I would not throw him out at the window.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I have just this moment had a flying call from the Waffler (who I imagined had long since left travelling the road); and by dint of much gasping he has contrived to make me understand that in half an hour he will be coming back from Leith, and will consequently be ready to take home one of these boxes which have stood so long here waiting for him. He also informs me that he has found means <hi rend="italic">to forget</hi> a parcel directed to me lying at his lodgings; so that I am obliged to <hi rend="italic">answer</hi> your letters without having seen them. In short the poor soul is as confused and bewildered as ever. If you had this box safe in your possession I would advise you to keep it: for really there is no sense to be got out of such trade as this. One had better pay three postages for a letter than have it huddled over in this fashion.</p>
<p>As for the books, I made enquires about them, and could have had them ready long ago, had I entertained the slightest expectation of seeing any Carrier to take them down. If I have a moment&#x2019;s time, I shall run up to Oliver &#x26; Boyd&#x2019;s and get such of them as are in their possession transmitted by this present opportunity; in which if I should fail, I will take care to transmit the whole by the Annan Carrier as speedily as possible.</p>
<p>I am in the greatest anxiety to hear from you about all your concerns; and if you have not written with extreme minuteness, I shall desire it as a very special favour that you sit down &#x26; give me a full account of all that is transacting about Mainhill within doors and without. You can manage this some evening when you feel &#x201C;i&#x2019; the vein,&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Richard III</hi>, IV, ii: &#x201C;I am not in the vein.&#x201D;</note> or some wet day when you have nothing better to do.</p>
<p>For myself, I am going on exactly in the old style. The Translation of Legendre I am endeavouring to get brought to a close with all convenient speed; and I hope to be done with it in a few weeks at farthest. I jog up to Dr Fleming&#x2019;s in George-Square twice every day (Saturdays, generally, and this among them excepted) to superintend the studies of the Bullers: I go down to bathe pretty regularly: I read <pb id="pg-02-139" n="02:139"/>&#x26; write, in short, and teach and sleep &#x26; eat as quietly as I can. My stomach is still troublesome a little&#x2014;generally very enervating for several hours every day; but there are times when I altogether lose feeling of it, and busy myself with quite another class of objects; and I entertain the rational expectation of once more enjoying in some moderate degree that first &#x26; greatest of earthly blessings, which I have so long &#x26; so much whined about the want of.</p>
<p>There are few people or things in my neighbourhood, about which I take any deep interest; and the commodity of news is one which I get little of &#x26; care still less for. They have had long trials about James Stewart&#x2019;s duel &#x26; Beacon Newspapers<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >There had appeared in the first number (<date when="1821-01-06">6 Jan. 1821</date>) of the Edinburgh <hi rend="italic">Beacon</hi>, a fervently Tory newspaper, an unwarranted and particularly scurrilous attack against James Stuart (<date when="1775-00-00">1775</date>&#x2013;<date when="1849-00-00">1849</date>), a Writer to the Signet and a keenly loyal Whig. Because of this and other political excesses, the <hi rend="italic">Beacon</hi> was ordered into extinction in <date when="1821-08-00">Aug. 1821</date>, but it was in effect replaced on <date when="1821-10-10">10 Oct.</date> by the Glasgow <hi rend="italic">Sentinel</hi>. The first number of the <hi rend="italic">Sentinel</hi> also carried a personal attack against Stuart, and similar articles followed. Whereas Stuart previously had but demanded an apology from the printer of the <hi rend="italic">Beacon</hi>, he this time brought action for libel against Messrs. Borthwick and Alexander, publishers of the <hi rend="italic">Sentinel</hi>. The proceedings were stayed because of an argument between the two publishers, whose views on the issue were divergent, and the upshot was that Borthwick turned over to Stuart the MSS of the obnoxious articles. Discovering that the author of some of the most violent of them was Sir Alexander Boswell (<date when="1775-00-00">1775</date>&#x2013;<date when="1822-00-00">1822</date>), one of the cleverest wits of the day and the eldest son of Dr. Johnson&#x2019;s biographer, Stuart, on <date when="1822-03-25">25 March</date>, challenged him to a duel. They met the following morning near Auchtertool, Fifeshire; Boswell was hit, and the next day died. On the advice of friends Stuart departed for Paris and there surrendered to the British ambassador. On <date when="1822-06-10">10 June</date> he was indicted and tried for murder before the high court of justiciary, Edinburgh, and the next morning was found not guilty. In <date when="1828-00-00">1828</date> he sailed for the United States, and returned three years later to write his <hi rend="italic">Three Years in North America</hi> (<date when="1833-00-00">1833</date>). He edited the London <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi> until <date when="1836-00-00">1836</date>, and thereafter served as inspector of factories.</note> &#x26;c, all which, except it, furnishing materials for some small discussions over the worthy and most pleasant old Doctor&#x2019;s tea, has passed by me quite unheeded. I visit no one, and besides some few idlers attracted by the pleasure of conversation, and whose visits I do not at all encourage, I see no body except the people in George-square whom duties call me to see. One of the most intolerable visitors I have is John Waugh our friend, whose woes are at once the most poignant &#x26; the most contemptible of any man&#x2019;s I know about, and whose presence is to the minds production of thought, what a wet blanket wrapped around the fire would be to its production of heat. He has just one idea, the cruelty of his Landlady who gives him no <supplied>[rest becau]</supplied>se he owes her many a pound, and whose image haunts him like that of the Prince of Darkness or even more hideously. I am often altogether out of patience with the <pb id="pg-02-140" n="02:140"/>stupid lubber: I declare I would rather have enlisted for a soldier than loitered and lain like a <hi rend="italic">stinker</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In Scots, &#x201C;a dirty disagreeable fellow.&#x201D;</note> as he has done, an object of compassion &#x26; contempt to all that know him. He has no money at all at all&#x2014;often scarcely any meat; yet he just sits and grunts, without making any effort, beyond lamenting over the hardheartedness of men because they will not allow him to sail thro&#x2019; the voyage of life without putting a hand to the oar. I sometimes think he is absolutely mad&#x2014; But leave him!</p>
<p>The Bullers are exceedingly good fellows on the whole; they &#x26; I do exceedingly well together: it seems quite possible that the people &#x26; I may engage permanently; tho&#x2019; as before I continue to look at the matter as a thing which may be &#x201C;owther way&#x201D;&#x2014;without greatly affecting my happiness. If these wretched intestines will give me any <hi rend="italic">sufferable ease</hi>, I fear no weather: I am already past the worst.</p>
<p>Thus, my good boy, have I chit-chatted till my whole sheet is done. Forgive its meagreness&#x2014;for I have had no chance to improve the structure of it, being hurried as I told you. I hope yet to see you all for a longer or shorter time at Mainhill; I have many a thing to tell you and to ask about; and I promise to be better company than I have been for a long while. The chief deformities in my life have arisen from that thrice-cursed stomach of mine!</p>
<p><closer><salute>I long for a most particular letter from you, being always</salute></closer></p>
<p><closer><salute>Your true Brother, /</salute></closer> <name>Th: Carlyle</name></p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Contrary to expectation I have still a few minutes before me, in which I can scribble a line or two for your perusal; and as I know you are always pleased at hearing from me, I gladly devote them to that purpose. There are two letters here which have lain for you &#x26; Alick many weeks; they are now out of date to all intents &#x26; purposes, <pb id="pg-02-141" n="02:141"/>but I send them as proofs that if I disappointed you last time there was a box here, the blame was not mine.</p>
<p>I have got none but the most scanty notices from Mainhill, for a long while; and I am very anxious, as is natural, to have more particular information. I can only trust in the mean time that Providence still favours you with a moderate degree of health &#x26; comfort; and I entertain the hope that in spite of all obstacles I shall see you ere long&#x2014;to have a cup of tea &#x26; a whiff together, and talk over all our mutual concerns. In reckoning over my blessings, and balancing them against my woes, one of the largest articles in the former side of the account is the happiness of having you to share so deeply as I know you do in all that affects my interests. I should be worse than a dog, if I could ever forget the kind treatment I experienced at Mainhill, when it was so difficult tho&#x2019; at the same time so needful to treat me kindly.</p>
<p>The Porter has this moment brought in the little bundle; &#x26; I have found in it a small note from Mag, which tho&#x2019; brief is worth much to me. I rejoice to find that you are all in your usual way; I trust you will long be spared so. I must again more pressingly renew my request to Alick that he would write to me at great length by Post: the Porter has gone away without the box, and I suspect you will not see it on this occasion; so that except by his means I have little chance to hear of you for a great while.</p>
<p>I do not think you need send any box by Farries next time. I know it hurries you immensely, and the stupid driveller makes such confusion in the delivery of it that one is quite vexed. I have as much butter (of excellent quality) beside me as I shall need; the landlady makes <hi rend="italic">a</hi> kind of cakes which is the thriftiest kind I ever ate, and what is better, she gets me good brown bread from a Baker which I like very much. She also washes very well, and gets me eggs of a small but wholesome structure to my breakfast. So you need not vex yourself about the box any more till some new arrangement is fallen upon.</p>
<p>I am in very fair health considering every thing; about a hundred times as well as I was last year this time, and as happy as you ever saw me. In fact I want nothing but steady health of body (which I shall get in time) to be one of the comfortablest persons of my acquaintance. I have also books to write, and things to say &#x26; do in this world, which few wot of. This has the air of vanity, but it is not altogether so: I consider that my Almighty Author has given me some glimmerings of superior understanding &#x26; mental gifts; and I should reckon it the worst treason against him to neglect improving &#x26; using to the very utmost of my power these his bountiful mercies. At some <pb id="pg-02-142" n="02:142"/>future day, it shall go hard but I will stand <hi rend="italic">above</hi> these mean men, whom I have never yet stood <hi rend="italic">with</hi>. But we need <supplied>[no]</supplied>t prate of this.</p>
<p>I am very much satisfied with my teaching: in fact it is <supplied>[a]</supplied> pleasure rather than a task. The Bullers are quite another sort of boys than I have been used to, and treat me in another sort of manner than tutors are used to. When I think of General Dirom&#x2019;s<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18140824-TC-TM-01">TC to TM, <date when="1814-08-24">24 Aug. 1814</date></ref>.</note> brats &#x26; how they used to vex me, I often wonder that I had not broken their backs at once, &#x26; left them. This would not have done, to be sure; but the temptation was considerable. The eldest Buller is one of the cleverest boys I have ever seen: he delights to enquire&#x2014;&#x26; argue &#x26;&#x2014;be demolished; he follows me nigh home almost every night. Very likely I may bargain finally with the people: but I have had no certain intimation on the subject; and in fact I do not care immensely whether or not. There is bread for the diligent to be gained in a thousand ways.</p>
<p>I am very sorry to learn that my aunt Mary Stewart<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Wife of John Aitken, a brother of Carlyle&#x2019;s mother.</note> has been so long poorly. I will certainly write to my uncle John, some time very soon. My Father has not written to me for a long series of weeks. I would have sent him a letter to-day, if I had not been hurried beyond expression. Write to me yourself or by proxy if you can manage it the first opportunity. <closer><salute>I am ever (My dear Mother)</salute></closer></p>
<closer><salute>Your affect<hi rend="italic">e</hi> son, /</salute></closer> <name>Th: Carlyle</name><p>
</p><ps><p>I had almost forgot to mention that I heard of old Mrs Hope the other week. She is again living in lodgings at Musselburgh, is grown very deaf, but quite reformed from her old aberrations, and otherwise happy: she sent her kind remembrances to you, thro&#x2019; the medium of her nephew David Hope, who staid with me for several days, and went out to see her in one of them. I have some thoughts of calling upon her sometime myself. She would be very glad I am sure to get a letter from you.</p></ps>

He is far better without <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, seeing that no creature could digest such puddings as I should make, or wear apparel of my stiching&#x2014;</p>
<p>I am quite delighted with your lines on the Bass<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not preserved, according to A. Carlyle.

<salute>My dear Jack,</salute>
<p>I learned from the Jurist<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Dalgliesh.</note> this morning, that some Benson or other, being in the mind of setting out for Annan to-morrow morning, would easily consent to take down any letter directed to that quarter; and I in consequence determined to scrawl a few lines for your perusal, and deliver them in the evening to the care of that small man of Law; a purpose which I am now happily executing.</p>
<p>Your parcel arrived by the Penny-post on Monday-night: and gratified I was to see the pains you had been at in serving me. The manuscript was all made right, with great ease, before bed-time; and is at this instant in the act of being <hi rend="italic">set up</hi>, as they call it; so that you may look for a printed copy, by almost the first opportunity. It was all very good &#x26; serviceable: it does you credit in my eyes, as a proof of your diligent &#x26; successful attention to the art of composition; and gains you favour in another even more gratifying respect, as a proof of your readiness to engage in any task likely to ease or benefit your much-obliged Brother. I am now within 40 pages of the end, and expect soon to relinquish and have concluded the long labour, which has occupied me much, tho not unprofitably or disagreeably.</p>
<p>Edward Irving &#x26; W. Graham came in upon me last night, while sipping my tea with Dr Fleming &#x26; the rest. Edward is gone out to Haddington to-day, and proposes setting off towards London on Wednesday next. He told me of some conversation he had had with you, touching your embracing some profession; and also of his having recommended Medicine as the most promising line of life on which you could enter. I have frequently meditated on this subject myself; and certainly it is of vital importance for you to consider it deeply, now that you are about to quite your pedagogic situation at Annan, and to enter upon the acquisition of those accomplishments which are to gain a livelihood &#x26; respectability for you during the rest of your days. I can tell you from experience that it is a sad thing for a man to have his bread to gain in the miscellaneous fashion which circumstances have in some degree forced me into; and I cannot help seeing that with half the expence, and one tenth of the labour which I have incurred, I might at this time have been enjoying the comforts of some solid and fixed establishment in one of the regular departments of exertion, <pb id="pg-02-146" n="02:146"/>had I been lucky enough to have entered upon any one of them. It is true, no doubt, that by diligence and good talents a man may pick out a kind of peculiar path by his own ingenuity in this world; but still this is so precarious an enterprise that I would counsel no one to embark in it without a strict necessity compelling him. If you think you could relish the study &#x26; practice of Medicine, I make no doubts of your ability to excel in it; and for the necessary qualification&#x2014;I bid you be in no pain whatever. It shall go harder with me than it looks to do, if you be not made fully able to attend all their classes here, without interruption on any pecuniary score; and for the diligence &#x26; intellect required in the business&#x2014;you have already shewn all these qualities in sufficient abundance to put me to peace on that head. Upon the whole, I wish you would turn this matter calmly over in your mind with all due attention, and write to me about it as soon as you can come&#x2014;not to any conclusion&#x2014;but simply to any tangible deliverance on it. If your mind leads you to relish the project, you can partly be putting it in execution, the first winter you come hither; you might attend to Anatomy &#x26; Chemistry at the same time that you were perfecting your greek and natural philosophy: for observe, if you shall undertake the project, it is not a common Tom Bogs or Parli<supplied>[a]</supplied>ment<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably a reference to Thomas Irving of Bogside and Dr. George Little, nicknamed &#x201C;Parliament Geordie,&#x201D; professional men who had done little to distinguish themselves.</note> that I will have you become; but a medical <hi rend="italic">savant</hi> at length, bringing to bear upon his own science the mind of a man improved by literature and science in general, and looking forward to respectability in life not merely because of a mechanical skill in his own particular trade, but also because of a general refinement of character, and a superiority both of intellectual and moral deportment. I beg you will think of this, with all solidity, as soon as possible.</p>
<p>If you go to Mainhill to-morrow, you will get large news of me, arrived two days before, by way of Farries: you will also find your Book V of Legendre which I took care to enclose among the letters for home. There is no change in my situation since that period. I am going along in the old style, my life marked by no incident worth remembering, but happy on the whole, and peaceful &#x26; diligent in one way or another.</p>
<p>I saw Frank Dickson of Bermuda this morning: he is come home in the most frightful state of biliousness; lean &#x26; yellow, and almost utterly desperate. I am truly sorry for the poor fellow, tho&#x2019; he felt small sorrow for me of old when I was in that way. I advised him to go <pb id="pg-02-147" n="02:147"/>southward, fast as coaches could carry him.&#x2014; Waugh is here too, tho&#x2019; I endeavour to see him as seldom as possible. He is one of the most unfortunate not to say contemptible <foreign><hi rend="italic">slives</hi></foreign><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Slaves.</note> that lives on the face of our Planet. He has got some money now, however; and for two months or so he will be happy, come of it what may. He is to be M.D. in time; but there is little luck in store for him I fear: his talents are only mediocre, and his inactivity is nearly a <hi rend="italic">maximum</hi>&#x2014;the Jurist wishes to hear from you, talks about &#x201C;unaccountable&#x201D; and so forth; but you do well not to consume any portion of your useful time with such small deer<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">King Lear</hi>, III, iv.</note> as he. Give my kindest affection to our Father &#x26; Mother and all them of Mainhill. <closer><salute>I am always your&#x2019;s</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Friend,</salute>
<p>I am sorry to own that I have not written a single line of poetry or even of metre, since the time you last heard from me. Indolence, and excessive occupation, and stupidity both of my own and from others, have held me in complete bondage. In obedience to your injunctions, I did my besst endeavour to conceive the feelings of poor little Ada, and throw some ornament over them; I had even proceeded so far as to <hi rend="italic">intend</hi> saying something of the Stork with her bosom torn up to feed her young, of the Greenland bear whose cubs the English sailors interfered with&#x2014;greatly to their cost; and I <hi rend="italic">intended</hi> to draw <pb id="pg-02-148" n="02:148"/>a very notable moral from the whole: but alas!&#x2014;just as I was beginning, the &#x201C;Devil&#x201D; came for <hi rend="italic">copy</hi>, the Bullers came and wanted some arrangement (which is not made yet) about their boys, and lastly Irving came, and leaving his worthy tho&#x2019; at times somewhat tiresome companion<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably William Graham.</note> to my charge&#x2014;went eastwards as you know for better entertainment.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, I should hardly have presumed to trouble you at present, but that I feared you might want the other volume of Sismondi, which I would have you to finish before taking up any thing else; and that I am your debtor for a charming letter which ought to have been acknowledged long ere now. I was very sulky when this favour reached me: but the perusal of it dashed every cloud from the mind, and left me cheerful as summer; it has amused and enlivened me every time I have thought of it since. Your tragicomedy of the W.S. is quite a perfect thing; and related with the same easy gracefulness, with which it was originally transacted on your part. What a touching scheme of life the man of Law had laid out for himself! A little money and a house already&#x2014;wanted only an &#x201C;agreeable&#x201D; young woman to look after the cooking of his victuals and the darning of his stockings:&#x2014;and all this, you (cruel beauty!) have levelled with the earth by one fatal <hi rend="italic">no</hi>! Seriously, I could pity the Notarius; but his presumption exceeds all measure. A thousand masters of Conveyancing and even of the mystery of Tounge-fence [debate] may wed, and grow rich, and eat meat, and die and be annihilated; and the world no jot the better or the worse: but one trueminded woman of genius&#x2014;accomplished in character and understanding, as you may yet be if you will,&#x2014;is a more important object in the universe, worth more in the estimate of genuine taste, than all the Lawyers that have flourished from Ulpian &#x26; Trebonian<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Domitius Ulpianus (<date when="0170-00-00"><hi rend="small-caps">a.d.</hi> 170?</date>&#x2013;<date when="0228-00-00">228</date>), Roman jurist, member of the Council under Lucius Septimus Severus; and probably Gaius Trebonius (d. <date>43 <hi rend="small-caps">b.c.</hi></date>), Roman consul and governor in Asia.</note> inclusive down to this very writer to his majesty&#x2019;s signet! I do not <hi rend="italic">praise</hi> you therefore because you have <hi rend="italic">denied</hi>: but it does delight me to see such things.</p>
<p>At the first glance of your <hi rend="italic">fall</hi>, I formed a hasty wish that Dr Fyf<supplied>[f]</supplied>e had been in much hotter quarters than so civil a gentleman deserves. I am happy to learn from Irving that you feel no worse. Let me beg of you, however, to undertake no such experiments in future. Next to the misery of wedding a prosaic Lawyer would be that of dying in the very bud as it were; while the beautiful creations <pb id="pg-02-149" n="02:149"/>of intellect and fancy, which all your friends are looking for, continue still <foreign><hi rend="italic">in prospectu</hi></foreign>. It is hard to die at any time: but at such an age, and for such a cause&#x2014;!&#x2014; I do entreat you to make no hazards of that nature any more.</p>
<p>I spoke of your powers being <foreign><hi rend="italic">in prospectu</hi></foreign>: I am happy to be again reminded, and convinced if I had needed conviction, that the period of fulfilment is drawing near and nearer. Those verses you have sent me are proofs at once of your genius and diligence. You can already versify with great ease and correctness; and where you commit yourself to the expression of your own feelings, the result might please a far harsher critic than I am. The lines &#x201C;written at midnight&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See A. Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">LL</hi>, II, 349&#x2013;50. The verses were probably sent, with Jane&#x2019;s brief note of <date when="1822-07-11">11 July</date>, by Irving.</note> have something in them which is to me exceedingly beautiful and pathetic: I have read them over often; and found much to admire and not one expression to blame. You seem at present to be following the proper course; acquiring the ready command of your pen&#x2014;which is fully one half of a good education, and gathering fresh knowledge and new feelings from every source that can afford you any. This is the other half of education; and, without the former, comparatively of little value: with it, you make the individual all that Nature meant him to be; and the meanest individual if so trained would cease to be mean. I know not of any definite <hi rend="italic">plan</hi> of reading that would suit your case better than any other; you are well employed if you are conversing with great minds or contemplating exalted thoughts, at all: yet it strikes me that your present materials of study are in danger of leading you too much away from actual things; and of preventing your acquirement of those solid foundations of real knowledge, on which the right conduct of life equally with the right employment of the mental powers must all be built. I recollect of recommending History to you more than once: I still look upon it as the most instructive and interesting of all studies; equally improving to the understanding the imagination and the heart. What if you should recommence Hume, when Sismondi is finished; and so make a complete and memorable summer of the present? You might write a Sonnet upon every exalted character you fell in with, an essay upon every striking national change; you would have a <hi rend="italic">real</hi> scene before you, in which to insert the productions of your fancy, from which to draw your opinions of men and things; and I am certain, from my confidence in the strength of your judgement and the reasonableness as well as force of your emotions, that you might thus open up to yourself an almost boundless store of mental <pb id="pg-02-150" n="02:150"/>nourishment&#x2014;of new objects to study, new characters to admire, and to admire more strongly because more definitely and rationally than any one can admire those poetical and fictitious heroes and scenes with which at present your interior world is chiefly replenished. I express myself badly, but I mean something which I feel convinced is very reasonable; so I beg you to consider it maturely. I see a niche in the temple of Fame&#x2014;still vacant or but poorly filled-which I imagine your powers will yet enable you if so cultivated to occupy with glory to yourself and profit to others&#x2014;and that as a proper <hi rend="italic">Woman</hi>; which is more than our favourite De Sta&#xEB;l ever did. &#x201C;<foreign>Nous sommes tous deux <hi rend="italic">deguis&#xE9;s</hi> en femme</foreign>&#x201D;&#x2014;was one of Talleyrand&#x2019;s jokes, and not without some justice, against Delphine (thought to represent Wilhelmina herself, Mad. Vernon representing Tally).<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Talleyrand is purported to have said, &#x201C;I am told that Madame de Sta&#xEB;l has put us both in her novel [<hi rend="italic">Delphine</hi>]. We are both disguised as women.&#x201D;</note>&#x2014; But, like poor Nichol, I am <hi rend="italic">burbling</hi> my discourse: Besides my paper is done, and I had a thousand other things to say. Send me all the verses you have written&#x2014;with <hi rend="italic">any</hi> letter, the first day you have time to write one. I give out no subject of versification: I have no right, being a <hi rend="italic">craven</hi> at present; and besides, except on great occasions, it is best to leave that part of it, I find, to the direction of <hi rend="italic">whim</hi>. Above all, tell me <hi rend="italic">when</hi> I shall see you: consider, I have been a &#x201C;reasonable person&#x201D; for a very long period now&#x2014;about half-a-year as I reckon; and a few more such periods will put us both&#x2014;God only knows where! I am not going to dun you and vex you with this matter, however: I felt just now as if I could promise never to see you more&#x2014;if you required it of me. God bless you my dearest friend, whether I see you or not! <closer><salute>I am ever your&#x2019;s,</salute></closer></p>

<ps><p>You will rejoice to learn that I am positively to be done with this most wearisome Legendre next week. Till the Bullers take up house at least, I shall then have a short period of comparative freedom to write verses or do what I please.&#x2014; Tell me what you think of Sismondi.

<salute>My dear Jack,</salute>
<p>I yesterday found your parcel of speculation lying on the table along with a parcel of more solid materials from Mainhill; and I lose no time in acknowledging your favour, for two reasons. First, because I am solicitous to throw what light I can upon this perplexed business which I have set you a thinking of; and secondly, because having next to no time for answering, on so brief a notice, the letters addressed to me from home, I referred my valued correspondents to you for satisfaction on various points,&#x2014;to discuss which I hereby warn you to proceed straightway towards Mainhill, where by my notification you will be expected on Saturday.</p>
<p>Since I wrote to you last, and even since I wrote to my Father not many hours ago, there is a kind of change in my situation, which may be worth communicating. I am now engaged with the Bullers, whom I conversed with for a long time yesternight; and I expect, in two weeks at farthest, to have commenced my regular line of proceeding in their family, and so to continue it for one twelvemonth at least. I like the people much; Mrs B. in particular seems one of the most fascinating refined women I have ever seen; nor is the Goodman far behind her in his own particular walk&#x2014;that of an honest worthy straight-forward English Gentleman&#x2014;which however is a character that one naturally feels more disposed to value than admire. The terms are the same as were first talked of&#x2014;or rather nothing at all was said on that subject; with this single difference, that as they have found it quite impossible to get a house large enough for their establishment, it was agreed upon between us, that I should have a lodging of my own to sleep in in the neighbourhood, to which I might retire at nights after passing the day with them. By this arrangement, you see,&#x2014;in which I found quite as much to attract as repel&#x2014;you and I shall have the pleasure of living together next winter&#x2014;which I know will be far from a slight pleasure to either of us. We shall thus enjoy all the benefits of mutual intercourse and fraternal sympathy; we may advise together, learn together, rejoice together, condole together, or do whatever we chuse, in honesty.</p>
<p>Things being so ordered, I can take up the subject of your Medical enterprize with a freer hand and clearer vision. Considering your alacrity in the prospective study of this science, there is hardly any thing <pb id="pg-02-152" n="02:152"/>but the pressing danger of your being stopped by the <foreign><hi rend="italic">res angusta domi</hi></foreign>,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Multis res angusta domi, sed nulla pudorum pauperitatis habet</hi>&#x201D;: &#x201C;Although in narrow circumstances at home, none of these women allows her poverty to bother her&#x201D; (Juvenal, <hi rend="italic">Satires</hi>, VI, 357&#x2013;58).</note> which could have made me hesitate in advising you to set your mind towards it forthwith. That danger is now in a great degree withdrawn: knowing your qualities natural and acquired, I can have no doubt about your ability to conquer all the intellectual difficulties of the business, when you have no other to strive with; and therefore I give it as my frank opinion that this profession is the best channel of exertion I can see for you. The question, Where you shall turn this knowledge when acquired to account&#x2014;is no doubt a natural subject of anxiety; but it ought not by any means to operate as a bar to your attempt. Every department of human live is crowded with aspirants at present&#x2014;and has always been so I suppose; the medical department is not less crowded than others; but no other that I know of presents so fair a field for adventure. The Physician&#x2019;s scene of action is not confined (like the Lawyer&#x2019;s or the Clergyman&#x2019;s) to this country or to that: it extends over all the inhabited globe; wherever men exist, they are liable to diseases, and ready to reward the person who is able to alleviate them. In Britain at present, there are many modes of turning such knowledge to account besides practising it in a country town: there is the Navy, the Army, India, and a thousand other channels. Nor is it correct to take the riotous apothecaries of Annandale as a specimen of the medical profession in our country towns. I cordially agree with you in utterly rejecting and despising such a life as their&#x2019;s generally is: I had rather be at once and honestly a genuine unpretending Cob<supplied>[b]</supplied>ler or street-porter, than combine the character and intellect of a Cob<supplied>[b]</supplied>ler with the dress and title of a man of science; to which they generally add the morals and manners of a Bawdyhouse-bully. This will never do; nor need it. There has been a Sydenham, a Mead, a Darwin, a Gregory in Medicine; there still is a Baillie, a Moore,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Sydenham (<date when="1624-00-00">1624</date>&#x2013;<date when="1689-00-00">89</date>), often called &#x201C;the British Hippocrates&#x201D;; Richard Mead (<date when="1673-00-00">1673</date>&#x2013;<date when="1754-00-00">1754</date>); Erasmus Darwin (<date when="1731-00-00">1731</date>&#x2013;<date when="1802-00-00">1802</date>); John Gregory (<date when="1724-00-00">1724</date>&#x2013;<date when="1773-00-00">73</date>) or his son James (<date when="1753-00-00">1753</date>&#x2013;<date when="1821-00-00">1821</date>), both professors of medicine at Edinburgh; Matthew Baillie (<date when="1761-00-00">1761</date>&#x2013;<date when="1823-00-00">1823</date>); James Moore, later Carrick-Moore (<date when="1762-00-00">1762</date>&#x2013;<date when="1860-00-00">1860</date>).</note> and many other persons whose names would do honour to any class of intellectual and moral men: several of these have spent their lives in provincial towns; and depend upon it, there is still enough of good feeling and taste left in the land to secure even in country towns a proper degree of reverence for depth of understanding <pb id="pg-02-153" n="02:153"/>and nobleness of conduct whenever they are visibly and habitually displayed. In medicine too the fair objects of intellectual competition&#x2014;which I love to see you aiming it&#x2014;are more thickly scattered than in almost any other branch of science. The number of living Physicians who display any thing like cultivated or powerful understandings is the most limited imaginable; and the number of objects in their science which call for investigation about the most numerous. So that if a man is ambitious of scientific distinction&#x2014;here, if he has any claim to seize it, it hangs in larger clusters than almost anywhere else.</p>
<p>All which reasons, my beloved Jack, I would have thee to study and con over and over; and if they weigh in thy immense Tron-beam<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A tron was a beam-balance on which heavy goods were publicly weighed. The tron of Edinburgh was a beam which stood on the High Street and gave its name to the famous Tron Church.</note> of an understanding,&#x2014;to determine on combining, this very winter, the study of Anatomy &#x26; Chemistry, at all events the latter, with the pursuit of Greek Latin and Natural Philosophy. Write to me forthwith what is thy opinion. For the present, I leave it.</p>
<p>I am just in the act of getting done with that thrice wearisome Legendre. Brewster talks of settling with me for it; otherwise I should very gladly have asked for money, and the more so as I have actually been distitute of that needful commodity for many weeks. The Landlady thinks I am so idle I will not settle with her: she is in easy circumstances, and cares not. I hoped to get home almost directly, yesterday: but I find it cannot be for several weeks at any rate, and then only during a short space. Tell our good Mother that I am going to send her all the linens home for bleaching. The new shirts I would have made with very fine <hi rend="italic">linen</hi> necks, if convenient&#x2014;if not, not. I also want a few neck<supplied>[c]</supplied>loths (like the last double ones); for which I desire you to give our Mother whatever money she wants, in my name. Mention to Alick that I meant positively to write him last time&#x2014;and even to send him a small poem! His post-letter came most acceptably. Give my kind respects to our Cousin Nancy,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Nancy Grierson.</note> and all the brothers and sisters at Mainhill: I will see them all yet&#x2014;ere harvest be done.</p>
<p>They need not send me any more boxes at present: but if you can find Schiller&#x2019;s Tragedy of <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Tell</hi>, I wish you would send it up, in the next bundle of clothes. Perhaps it will surprise you to learn that Oliver &#x26; Boyd have agreed to go half with me in printing a poetical Translation of this work!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Nothing came of this proposal.</note> I have sometimes tried a little jingle last <pb id="pg-02-154" n="02:154"/>winter, and found it do me no hurt at all.

<salute>My dear Friend,</salute>
<p>Unless some one has anticipated me in regard to this &#x201C;Voice from St Helena,&#x201D; I calculate on furnishing you with some amusement, by introducing you to the sound of it. O&#x2019;Meara&#x2019;s work presents your favourite under somewhat of a new aspect: it has increased my respect for Napoleon, and my indignation against his <hi rend="italic">Boje</hi>.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle refers to Barry Edward O&#x2019;Meara (<hi rend="italic">ca.</hi> <date when="1786-00-00">1786</date>&#x2013;<date when="1836-00-00">1836</date>), <hi rend="italic">Napoleon in Exile; or, A Voice from Saint-Helena</hi>, 2 vols. (<date when="1822-00-00">1822</date>). O&#x2019;Meara, who was Napoleon&#x2019;s physician at St. Helena, quotes Napoleon (I, 78) as saying of Sir Hudson Lowe, British governor of the island, that he had the heart of an executioner, &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">ha il cuore di boja</hi></foreign>, for nobody but a <foreign><hi rend="italic">boja</hi></foreign> executioner would unnecessarily increase the miseries of people, situated like us, already too unhappy,&#x201D; adding that he &#x201C;ought to have been made keeper&#x201D; of convicts, as &#x201C;it would be exactly the office suited to him.&#x201D; For another expression of Napoleon&#x2019;s contempt for Sir Hudson Lowe (<date when="1769-00-00">1769</date>&#x2013;<date when="1844-00-00">1844</date>), see I, 52 ff.</note> Since the days of <hi rend="italic">Prometheus vinctus</hi>, I recollect of no spectacle more moving and sublime, than that of this great man in his dreary prison-house; given over to the very scum of the species to be tormented by every sort of indignity, which the heart most revolts against;&#x2014;captive, sick, despised, forsaken;&#x2014;yet rising above it all, by the stern force of his own unconquerable spirit, and hurling back on his mean oppressors the ignominy they strove to load him with. I declare I could almost love the man. His native sense of honesty, the rude genuine strength of his intellect, his lively fancy, his sardonic humour must have rendered him a most original and interesting companion; he might have been among the first writers of his age, if he had not chosen to be the very first conqueror of any age. Nor is this gigantic character without his touches of human affection&#x2014;his simple attachments, his little tastes and kindly predilections&#x2014;which enhance the respect of meaner mortals by uniting it with their love. I do not even believe him to have been a very wicked man; I rather&#x2014; But it is needless to keep you from the book itself with this <foreign><hi rend="italic">palabra</hi></foreign>. Send me word if you would like to see the second <pb id="pg-02-155" n="02:155"/>volume; which in the affirmative case you shall have, so soon as Mrs Buller has done with it. This lady likes Napoleon even better than you do; made a pilgrimage to his grave, stole sprigs of willow from it, &#x26;c; and called him the greatest of men in the presence of Mr Croker himself.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Wilson Croker (<date when="1780-00-00">1780</date>&#x2013;<date when="1857-00-00">1857</date>), best known as a Tory critic of the <hi rend="italic">Quarterly</hi>, who edited Boswell&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Johnson</hi> and attacked Keats and Tennyson, was Secretary of the Admiralty from <date when="1810-00-00">1810</date> to <date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>.</note> I am sorry however that I cannot bring her to a right sense of Byron&#x2019;s merit; she affirms that none admire that nobleman, so much as boarding-school girls and young men under twenty&#x2014;which she reckons a sure sign of his being partly a <hi rend="italic">charlatan</hi>.</p>
<p>I have some doggrel translations &#x26;c which I meant to send; but they are not fit to be seen by you&#x2014;perhaps never will. When shall I get your productions? I have no right to be impatient but these three weeks have seemed very long.</p>
<p>I am not happy at present; and for the best of all reasons, I stand very low in my own esteem. Something must be done, if I would not sink into a mere driveller. For the last three years I have lived as under an accursed spell&#x2014;how wretched, how vainly so, I need not say. If nothing even now is to come of it, then I had better have been any thing than what I am. But talking is superfluous: I only beg for a little respite, before you mark me down forever, as an unhappy dunce, distinguished from other dunces only by the height of my aims and the clamour of my pretensions.</p>
<p>&#x2014;Will you not write to me soon? It were a kind act. <closer><salute>I am always,</salute></closer></p>

<dateline>Friday-morning [<date when="1822-08-09">9 August 1822</date>].</dateline>
<salute>My dear Friend,</salute>
<p>Supposing that you are quite tired with such a long course of hard reading as Sismondi must have proved, I send out these books of Milman<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henry Hart Milman (<date when="1791-00-00">1791</date>&#x2013;<date when="1868-00-00">1868</date>), English poet and historian. By <date when="1822-00-00">1822</date> he had published several epics, including <hi rend="italic">Samor, the Lord of the Bright City</hi> (<date when="1818-00-00">1818</date>).</note> to you, hoping they may serve to entertain you for an hour or two.</p>
<p>There is also a miserable pen&#x2014;which upon examination I find <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to be one of Bramahs,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Joseph Bramah (<date when="1748-00-00">1748</date>&#x2013;<date when="1814-00-00">1814</date>) patented some eighteen inventions, one of which was an &#x201C;ever-pointed pencil.&#x201D;</note> or worth a single doit; accompanied with some <pb id="pg-02-156" n="02:156"/>doggrel which is worth even less. I send both, notwithstanding; because the will is often impressed with a value which the deed has not conferred upon it. These silly articles will reach you without farther cost, and may be consumed with fire or cast into outer darkness in Haddington as well as here.</p>
<p>I am waiting with exemplary patience for your letter and verses: I beg, however, that you will send them by the <hi rend="italic">first Book</hi>&#x2014;without minding the others&#x2014;if you can steal as much time from more serious duties. I fear I must speak no more about seeing you at present. It seems as if on meeting you I should have a thousand things to say, and ten thousand which I could not say. Nevertheless I shall leave it all at your own disposal; and only beg that you will not altogether allow the clamorous demands of worldly proprieties and conveniences to drown the &#x201C;small still voice,&#x201D; which would once have pleaded for me in your heart, and some echo of which may perhaps still linger there. This looks all very childish but it is not quite so.</p>
<p>I purpose afflicting you with a long series of enormous letters, if you will not let me see your face very soon. Perhaps therefore your better resolution would be to submit at once.</p>
<p>Excuse this blotted scrawl: I am hurried excessively. <hi rend="italic">When</hi> shall I get your letter?</p>

<salute>My dear Friend,</salute>
<p>I grieve to trouble you again so soon, and about so very unimportant a matter as the present; but there is no alternative. I am going down to Annandale this week; and I find I cannot go quietly without at least attempting to see you (particularly as I have little chance of such another opportunity for a considerable time); or attempt to see you without permission. Tell me, therefore, whether I may come out some morning by the nine o&#x2019;clock Coach&#x2014;speak with you for two hours&#x2014;and return hither in the evening,&#x2014;without creating any inconvenience to you. If not, I shall submit implicitly to your wishes, and proceed homewards without discontentment on that head. But if <hi rend="italic">yes</hi>, then I have got Tragedies and poems and prospects and resolves and <pb id="pg-02-157" n="02:157"/>a hundred things to talk of and listen to beside you. To-morrow I shall get your letter&#x2014;at least if you write by the Coach: next day I shall either come, or know that I am not to come.</p>

<salute>My dear Jack,</salute>
<p>In a most hurried and confused scrawl which I dashed off with the speed of light to our Father last Saturday, and which you must have read if not understood ere now, some mention was made of a frank, which I designed procuring shortly, in order by means of it to write home more leisurely and more at large. I now find I have been reckoning without my host, in that matter: Mr James is gone without my privity; and a frank is to me one of the &#x201C;great impossibles.&#x201D; Let us rejoice however that the national institution of Posts still survives in its pristine vigour, and that by paying a given number of pence, Jack can still have the privilege of listening to his brother, and I of addressing my right trusty and well-beloved Jack. It is with the certainty of this feeling&#x2019;s being mutual that I have taken up the pen at present; and having what they call a half-holiday at my command (of which more anon), I design giving you a most luculent and longwinded history.</p>
<p>It would serve little purpose to occupy any portion of your sheet with details of my meagre and most uneventful journey. Like most of the country we travelled thro&#x2019; my life during that day was a flat unfertile moor. The company changed frequently, but the change brought no accession and could bring little diminution to my sources of amusement. From the burring Berwickshire guard that slumbered on the boot forward to the Reverend David Dickson<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >David Dickson, the younger (<date when="1780-00-00">1780</date>&#x2013;<date when="1842-00-00">1842</date>), Presbyterian divine, published <hi rend="italic">The Influence of Learning on Religion</hi> (<date when="1814-00-00">1814</date>) and other works. See <ref target="volume-02/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/7616"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>.</note> who sat snuffing and hawking on the box, we were an inane class of mortals, given up to the digesting of victuals and careless of aught beside. So I even ducked my head beneath the collars of my dread-nought and betook myself to digesting victuals likewise; that is to say: I fell into a state of comparative torpor, from which I was only aroused at the end of each successive stage, by Coachee in want of his sixpence, or somewhat more <pb id="pg-02-158" n="02:158"/>agreeably, by the curses which one of our party (a lean bilious Dumfries-looking man who might be a hatter or shoemaker) bestowed on inns generally and particularly on the one beside us&#x2014;for rating a raw egg and a glass of rum at the sum of six pence current money of the realm. The eggs he said were five pence a-dozen, the rum as much a gill, and each individual publican was a prince of knaves and already given over to the Principle of Evil for making such an overcharge. Towards evening the man&#x2019;s stomach began to abate, his demands and therefore his maledictions became less frequent; and even this very slender rill of coarsest amusement began to fail me, when at last the [<foreign><hi rend="italic">trindlin-kist</hi></foreign><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Literally &#x201C;trundling-box,&#x201D; i.e., the coach, a box on wheels.</note> set us down upon the Pavement of Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, towards six o&#x2019;clock. Such was our &#x201C;travel&#x2019;s history.&#x201D; I believe I should not have mentioned it at all; but for a caution which I meant to give you against Jodging at the Kings Arms (the worst and dearest of Inns), and a hint to carry some <hi rend="italic">Sandwich</hi> (slice of beef between two of bread) or two in your pocket, when you go the way yourself. Take the Commercial Inn to sleep in, and eat your sandwiches about Biggar&#x2014; <foreign><hi rend="italic">Satis jam</hi></foreign> [Enough now]!</p>
<p>A topic on which my good Jack will feel much more interest, and which I myself am much more inclined to speak about, is the state of my accommodation and my degree of <hi rend="italic">heart&#x2019;s ease</hi> since reaching my destination. In reply to the anxieties of all my ever-dear friends at Home, I am happy to say that every thing is better than I could expect. We have had some trouble in arranging matters and may yet have more; but in a week or two I have good hopes that all our machinery will have got itself rightly adjusted, and be moving sweetly as any one could desire. As yet I feel somewhat a stranger in the house of the Bullers&#x2014;confused by their costly and often superfluous apparatus of servants and apartments and formalities, which I can neither well employ nor dispense with; and at evenings I am happier and freer when quit of it all, I reach my quiet retreat in Moray-street, and sit with a long pipe in my cheek to muse on my own thoughts and be lord of the little all that my eye can wander over. These feelings you know I anticipated, and I feel more confident than ever that they will be temporary only. It is but the natural disquiet which one constantly feels on changing, whether for better or for worse,&#x2014;which even a shifting of my abode (<hi rend="italic">except</hi> to the home at Mainhill) is enough at all times to excite in so irritable a subject as I am. Before a week or two elapse this feeling will be over, and then I <pb id="pg-02-159" n="02:159"/>anticipate nothing but contentment. The people treat me with a degree of respect which I do not deserve; they have submitted implicitly to all my ideas about a lodging-place, they have delivered me without even a hint on my part from the drudgery of teaching their youngest boy,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Reginald Buller. See <ref target="volume-02/lt-18221114-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1822-11-14">14 Nov.</date></ref></note> and our arrangements for the other two have been formed with a view to my convenience as much as to that of any other. The boys too behave well; and tho&#x2019; I clearly perceive that the management of my duties will require the whole of my slender stock of prudence and discretion, yet this stock I expect without wavering will at the same time suffice to carry me thro&#x2019; without discredit. And&#x2014;let ill come to worst&#x2014;there is always this stern solace behind: If the place <hi rend="italic">will</hi> not answer&#x2014;let it go to Jerusalem if it will; I can do without it!</p>
<p>One item I know will give universal satisfaction at Mainhill, and to none more deeply than to Jack himself. Thou and I are to inhabit Moray-street together thro the winter; to have two beds and my old apartments beside&#x2014;both for the rent of 8/ per week&#x2014;and 9/ when fire is added. The way we manage is this. I rise at eight, out of my own old dormitory; and having fortified myself with cloak, galoches<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Galoshes at this date were still a sort of clog of wood and leather. See <hi rend="italic">OED</hi>.</note> &#x26;c, set forth to the west end of the city where breakfast awaits me at nine: I teach till one&#x2014;then get exclusive possession of the school-room till near dinner time (about five o&#x2019;clock&#x2014;when no company is there)&#x2014;afterwards I teach another hour, then have tea, then return to the east about nine at night. Moreover we are to have two half-holidays weekly&#x2014;that is, we are to have no teaching at all after one on Wednesdays and Saturdays; on which days also I may command (as I have done to-day) a dinner by myself, and so get delivered completely by three o&#x2019;clock. Nothing in the world could be fairer.&#x2014; Now during the whole day this fine room of mine is vacant&#x2014;except when I visit it about mid-day for a <hi rend="italic">smoke</hi>: but during winter Jack shall study here with all his implements, and the good Wilkie surrenders an excellent bed to him in an adjoining room. Even Duncan Church may be accommodated under the same roof for 5/ a-week: it is but dispossessing an ancient and crack-brained musician, whom all the house dislikes, of his quarters in the other two <hi rend="italic">roomies</hi>; and Duncan and you may mess together and study separately according to your heart&#x2019;s desire.&#x2014; I have scarcely a hair&#x2019;s breadth of space to notice the <hi rend="italic">hour</hi> of teaching which awaits you. It is in the house of a Mrs Mackenzie where I taught last year&#x2014;the pay is two guineas a month&#x2014;and you can take it up when you choose between this and <date when="1822-10-00">October</date>. Your future pupils are two <pb id="pg-02-160" n="02:160"/>handsome good-natured young ladies and they learn Arithmetic. So when you tire of rustication&#x2014;come away. I must break off abruptly for an obvious reason. <closer><salute>Write large<supplied>[ly and]</supplied> immediately, to Yours always</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Friend,</salute>
<p>I returned to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> four days ago,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >From Mainhill.</note> in order to take my appointed place in the family of the Bullers; and tho&#x2019; confused and stupified by the many changes which this arrangement has introduced into my condition, I cannot allow my present inept and tenebrific state of mind any longer to prevent me from informing you that I am still in the land of the living, still full of zeal to serve you, and more anxious than ever to hear some tidings of you. If during these six weeks, so trifling a matter as I or my letters ever formed the object of your contemplation, you may sometimes perhaps have imputed this long silence to anger at the sharp note<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found, but clearly Carlyle was not permitted to visit Haddington in <date when="1822-08-00">early August</date>.</note> you sent hither the day before I left Town. My first <pb id="pg-02-161" n="02:161"/>care is to assure you that it was not so. The only anger I felt on that occasion was directed against myself, for having even inadvertently given you a moment&#x2019;s vexation; and I still profess my entire and cheerful submission to your dictates in this as in every other circumstance connected with our correspondence. Be sole and absolute mistress of its laws; only <hi rend="italic">do not renounce it</hi>! When I commit some great crime I shall deserve that punishment; and then I give you leave to inflict it&#x2014;if not till then. As it is, every new day but shews more forcibly what a treasure I possess in your friendship, every new character I study but reveals some new superiority in yours; and the more calmly I reflect on the nature of our relation to each other, the more clearly do I perceive how fraught with enjoyment and profit our intercourse might prove to me, without harm or blame to either of us. I would fain avoid heroics, I know your wicked laugh when I transgress in that particular: it is enough therefore to say that I long for the continuance of our correspondence with more earnestness than I have been accustomed to feel of late for any blessing that my life held out to me, and still entertain the fixed hope that in after days we shall never repent having trusted each other so far.</p>
<p>I purposed while in Annandale to have a long series of poems ready for your perusal against my return&#x2014;to have shaped for myself some plan of regular exertion during winter&#x2014;perhaps even to have traced out the outline of some Book which I might commence the writing of without delay. Alas! that it should be so much easier to purpose than to execute! So far as regards any intellectual object, the period of my rustication has in truth proved a total blank; and the best I am able to say of it is, that, it passed away pleasantly if not profitably; and innocently&#x2014;in the exercise of simple and genuine affections&#x2014;tho&#x2019; undignified either by the contemplation or the execution of any great enterprise whatever. I chatted whole days with my kind and true-hearted Mother, listened with no small interest to the rude sterling genius of my Father, made the youngsters sing to me or tell me their &#x201C;travel&#x2019;s history&#x201D; since we had parted, and strove by every method in my power to give old Care the slip for at least one month of my life. Not that I succeeded absolutely either. By times the Enemy would fasten on me fiercely and tell me that I was but a drivelling sluggard, that all I longed for most on Earth was fleeting fast away from my hold and I not even making an effort to grasp it. Sad truths! but what did they avail me? I tried rhyming repeatedly, but it would not answer. Once I had reached the third stanza of a hymn on the Battle of Morgarten;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A battle in <date when="1315-00-00">1315</date> in which a small Swiss army defeated a greater Austrian one and laid the foundation of Swiss liberty.</note> <pb id="pg-02-162" n="02:162"/>another time I commenced an address to the Kirk of Durisdeer&#x2014;the aspect of which as I saw it planted so calmly in the sunshine on the hill-side, with its simple belfry, its churchyard, and the lowly cottages around it, might have caused my passing eye to linger on it, even if I had not recollected a certain <hi rend="italic">sermon</hi> written there; but nothing of the sort would prosper in my hands. Not even the Glen Kens of Galloway which Burns asserted might make a poet of a blockhead could inspire me. I still recollect the view which burst on Brother Jack and me as we rode steadily over the brow of Kinnick&#x2014;the vast and solemn ampitheatre of stern heathy granite mountains rising in successive ridges behind each other, with a black pall of storms over-shadowing the peaks of the highest and hindmost&#x2014;the blue melancholy lakes, the solitary streams that glanced and winded among the rocks below us&#x2014;all this is still fresh in the tablets of the mind: but what does it produce there? I could almost break forth in tears when I think of the wild and lonely grandeur of my Mother Earth&#x2014;but that were mawkish; or in songs of wonder&#x2014;but words fail me, and so I live with a &#x201C;most voiceless thought.&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Childe Harold</hi>, III, xcvii, 9.</note> Since returning in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, I have toiled in one continued scene of bustling and disquietude, perplexed and confused by the change of my condition to a degree that renders all exertion of the understanding or the fancy quite a hopeless undertaking. By degrees, I trust, some regularity may be introduced into my proceedings; in hours of leisure I even yet hope to effect something permanent before winter expires: but for my late operations, as the case stands at present, I must submit to your rebukes, and for my future projects implore your good wishes and your pity.</p>
<p>With yourself, My dear Friend, I feel assured that things are widely different. Long ere now you must have finished Tasso, Maria,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Maria Stuart</hi> of Schiller, presumably.</note> Wallenstein, and many others of the sort; and I already anticipate the pleasure of perusing the ample collection of poems and essays which you must have composed since our parting. Tell me all that you have done, and all that you intend doing. I consider my own credit as partly implicated in your progress; I have pledged myself as to the extent of your natural endowments, and if I do not live to see you by far the most distinguished female<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Later Carlyle used &#x201C;distinguished female&#x201D; in coterie speech as a somewhat contemptuous term for women who had cultivated their intellectual propensities at the expense of what he considered a feminine attitude.</note> of all I ever knew, I shall die disappointed. <pb id="pg-02-163" n="02:163"/>Go on then, and prosper! The career you have chosen is beset with griefs and dangers; but it is the career of the great and noble-minded: the very wish to be numbered among those Elect of the world is honourable; how glorious to have it gratified! At some future day, you will recollect these predictions&#x2014;with a feeling towards me that I would not sell for the favour of Kings. May it soon arrive, and long continue!</p>
<p>I know not whether you regard this late seeming negligence of mine in the light of a merit or a fault. If in the latter, I pray that mercy may be mingled with justice;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">The Merchant of Venice</hi>, IV, i; <hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi>, X, 77.</note> for I am dying to hear from you. How easy were it to make a packet of your compositions, and send me a long frank charming letter with it any day you liked. I wait your time&#x2014;patiently as I am bound: only do not keep me longer than is needful, and remember me when you estimate the need.</p>
<p>It is many a month since I saw or heard of your mother: yet I well recollect the time I passed near her; it seems to grow brighter as it removes. Present my affectionate respects to her, and my hope to shew some time that I have not forgot her kindness.&#x2014; Excuse this most inane and bombastic epistle; think how it was written, and believe that the sentiments it is meant to convey are true, tho&#x2019; the dress of them is awkward. I shall write more rationally next time, but cannot be more sincerely.</p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>A few minutes ago, I had a call from George Currie, who has just been attending to the shore his relation Frank Little, embarked for London (to which place also old Cressfield attends him),<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The personal names seem to be those of acquaintances who formerly lived in Annandale.</note> and thence as you know to New Holland. George purposes setting out for Annandale to-morrow morning; and as he volunteered carrying any message or the like for me down to Ecclefechan, it struck me that I might easily spend this half-hour still left to me, in a worse way than in scrawling a few hasty sentences for your perusal, on a subject which, <pb id="pg-02-164" n="02:164"/>tho&#x2019; I have short while ago treated it largely, you will not now think it superfluous to have yet more largely treated. You expect no regularity or precision in such letters as this; and here you will find none.</p>
<p>In my large epistle to Jack, I gave you assurance that matters were bidding fair to go on well with me in this new situation; that I was moderately healthy; well treated, and happy in every respect but the novelty and partial untowardness of my condition&#x2014;which untowardness, I then confidently anticipated would be only for a time. I have since had a farther trial of matters; and I know it will give you pleasure to be informed that my anticipations are daily getting more confirmed. The people treat me with every species of consideration; the labour is very moderate, and by no means disagreeable; and I command almost six hours daily which are altogether at my own disposal. Also my health is getting into the old track of improvement. Indeed I have hopes of getting as sound as any ploughman ultimately; and even before winter is done of being in a very passable case. At this date, I am as well as I have been for a twelvemonth&#x2014;far better than usually during that period. One of these days, I am going to lay in my assortment of reading, and commence my course of studies for the winter: I hope even to have <hi rend="italic">the</hi> Book in a state of forwardness against spring!</p>
<p>So that you see, my dear Mother, all the anxieties you feel on my account are perfectly superfluous: I am as well as I could hope in every point; and quite near enough being as well as I could wish, if I would leave sufficient stimulus for action behind. Let us all be thankful for the mercies that our kind Father is ever mixing with the cup of life&#x2014;bitter and depressing as it may sometimes be.</p>
<p>As I am the great fountain of news, I bear patiently with the want of intelligence from Home as yet, reckoning it my part for the present rather to give than to receive. Nevertheless I often turn my contemplations southward; and think what is becoming of you all, how your labours are prospering, and what measure of contentment you enjoy. The continued fine weather here leaves me room to hope that the Harvest with you is now past the busiest. We have had some days of a wind sufficient to &#x201C;dry all the stuff in the creation&#x201D;; and then fine mild sunshiny weather succeeded which would render it a pleasure to gather in the sheaves to their winter lair. I trust every thing is going as you would desire it.</p>
<p>For yourself, my dear Mother, I have only to hope that you are now safe thro&#x2019; this bustle; and to repeat my earnest prayer that you would be cautious of exposing yourself to any inclemency, and careful to take the good of every convenience within your reach. I once more <pb id="pg-02-165" n="02:165"/>bid you make a point of having tea <hi rend="italic">every night</hi>: it is the best thing in the world, if used in moderation: and none deserves it better or has earned it more faithfully than you. That evening potation which I used to be so fond of, I now consume in the drawing-room of the Bullers with urns and china and splendid apparatus all around me: yet I often turn from a<supplied>[ll]</supplied> that granduer with a soft and pensive recollection to the little <hi rend="italic">down-the-house</hi> at Mainhill, where kind affections made amends for all deficiencies, and would have made a rich amends for a thousand more. Often, often, my dear Mother, in coming years we shall yet drink tea there; enjoy our pipe and friendly chat together there; and pity all the empty gorgeousnesses of this Earth.</p>
<p>But five o&#x2019;clock is just upon the stroke, and half-an-hour hence will be the very rational time we dine at in India-street: so I must cut and run. I purposed telling you many things more; and perhaps even writing to our shifty husbandman, the short-tempered but true-hearted Alick. Tell him so, and that I long for his letter. When the box comes out, tell Jack to put my Homer in: our Arthur<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Arthur Buller.</note> is reading it, and I require to prepare beforehand&#x2014; When is the <foreign><hi rend="italic">Cluist</hi></foreign> or [<hi rend="italic">Christ</hi>?] Jack coming in person. He cannot get to the &#x201C;second Greek&#x201D; this year&#x2014;I fear: but he shall not want for work. Give my love to my Father, whose letter I expect by the first opportunity. My warm and brotherly affection to all the rest&#x2014;Mag, Jamie, Mary, Jane and the songstress Jenny. Remember me also as Nancy&#x2019;s kind cousin. The clock has struck! I must off without delay. <closer><salute>Believe me to be, My dear Mother,</salute></closer></p>
<p><closer><salute>Ever your affectionate son, /</salute></closer> <name>Th: Carlyle&#x2014;</name></p>
<ps><p>Tell Jack to write by Post, and give my compliments to James Johnston&#x2014;</p></ps>

<salute>My dear Sir</salute>
<p>I was looking to the south and wondering if any living creature thought on me when your letter was put into my hand. Never did <pb id="pg-02-166" n="02:166"/>letter meet a warmer welcome. It was so unexpected and so different from any thing I have read or heard these many weeks!&#x2014;not a word of hogs, cheviots, Falkirk-fair or the Caledonian-canal! You cannot think how well I liked it&#x2014; My Mother and I have been here a month, and intend remaining another week. I anticipated much enjoyment from our journey hither but, Alas! the wind blew, and the rain fell, and I was cold wet and wo<supplied>[e]</supplied>fully sick&#x2014; From Glasgow to Fort-William I lay on the deck of the Steamboat praying to be again on terra firma and heedless of the magnificent scenery through which we passed&#x2014; Every thing is ordered for the best&#x2014;had I been at all comfortable I should assuredly have fallen in love&#x2014;deeply hopelessly in love with a handsome fascinating Colonel of the Guards who held an umbrella over me for four and twenty hours&#x2014; You will wonder I escaped when I tell you this charming stranger is intimately acquainted with Lord Byron and enjoyed the friendship of our own de Stael&#x2014; I never saw his like. He is all heart and soul&#x2014;with the look of a Prince and the manners of a courtier&#x2014; I could have wept at parting with him<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Col. Alexander Mair, Deputy Governor of Fort George.</note>&#x2014;but I could not get at my handkerchief without unbuttoning my boat-cloke and that was inconvenient&#x2014;</p>
<p>I am delighted with this country. My cousin&#x2019;s house stands near the top of Loch Ness, in the midst of a bright green lawn as smooth as velvet. The Tarffe<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A stream flowing north to Loch Ness at Fort Augustus. See map.</note> flows down from Corryarrick through a deep wooded glen behind the house&#x2014;and forms the boundary of this verdant spot. Steep wooded <foreign>braes</foreign> rise on the opposite side of the river. and behind these the vast range of heathy mountains that form the northern boundary of the Great Valley&#x2014;a few yards from the house there is a bridge across Glen Tarffe the most romantic thing I ever saw. I sit there whole hours admiring Loch Ness with its gigantic ramparts of bold mountains&#x2014; and the beautiful little Fort Augustus<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A village at the head of Loch Ness and on the right bank of the Caledonian Canal 33 1/2 miles southeast of Inverness.</note> and the green braes where Cumberland encamped with his ten thousand men after the battle of Culloden&#x2014; I have seen the ancient Castles of Dunolly and Dumstaffnish<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dunolly is an estate with an ancient castle in Kilmore and Kilbride parish, Argyllshire, on the cliffs between Oban Bay and the mouth of Loch Etive. Dunstaffnage is a famous castle in the same parish on the south side of Loch Etive, 3 1/2 miles north-northeast of Oban.</note> situated on bold rocks that overhang the sea&#x2014; I have passed over the dreary moor of Inverlochy where Montrose and his gallant followers fought and conquered, and have <pb id="pg-02-167" n="02:167"/>admired the stern grandeur of its Castle, older than memory, where King Achaius<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The legend that the Auld Alliance between Scotland and France originated in a league made by Achaius, 65th King of Scotland, with Charlemagne, first appears in <hi rend="italic">Chronica Gentis Scotorum</hi>, III, xlviii, the author of which, John of Fordun, died <hi rend="italic">ca.</hi> <date when="1385-00-00">1385</date>.

<salute>My dear Jack,</salute>
<p>I fear I have been a little too remiss in writing to you touching your journey hither. I designed to have accomplished that duty about Wednesday, in order to leave you room for setting out at the end of this week, and meeting me here about Saturday; but some call or other was made on my attention at the time, and a slender call is enough at present to disconcert my measures, the time I have to spare being limited, and the duties I have to fulfil so near occupying it entirely that even a walk to the Post-office may prove incompatible with some of my engagements. As matters stand, I hardly expect you to-morrow; but if you get this duly, and have all things in readiness, you <pb id="pg-02-169" n="02:169"/>may still be able to take your departure sometime next week&#x2014;if on Wednesday morning&#x2014;so much the better, as you would in that case find me disengaged and waiting to receive you in the evening. This however I hardly expect, at so brief a warning: nor does it matter much; you will be no worse for a few days more of rustication, and there will be time enough after all for labour of every sort tho&#x2019; you should come a little later.</p>
<p>As to your plan of riding to Elwanfoot,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Also spelled Elvanfoot. A stage-inn twelve miles northwest of Moffat.</note> I cannot approve of it at all; the distance is far too great and the hour too early. It were better, if you disrelish sleeping in Dumfries, to ride thither in the morning, starting from home about half-past two, or to try if you could fall in with the coach about Closeburn<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A village and parish of Nithsdale, Dumfriesshire, 11 3/4 miles north-north-west of Dumfries. Thornhill is nearby. Closeburn is the traditional seat of the Kirkpatrick family to which Mrs. Buller, Mrs. Strachey, and Kitty Kirkpatrick all belonged.</note> or Thornhill, at which latter place it makes a halt of twenty minutes, with a view to breakfasting, about eight in the morning. I think there is a road to Closeburn by Lochmaben and the Gawin Moor, which makes the distance some twenty miles. But Dumfries the night before is certainly the most convenient arrangement; and notwithstanding the additional expense, I imagine it ought to be preferred. Another method perhaps better than any is to ride up to Moffat some evening; to meet the Mail there about eleven at night, to get an inside seat, and be landed here at five next morning. You can sleep here till noon if you like. Only you must discover <hi rend="italic">which</hi> day the Mail goes thro&#x2019; Moffat, for it does so only on alternate days. If you failed in getting a seat you might walk on to Elwanfoot next morning with great ease. Obse<supplied>[r]</supplied>ve however that you must certainly take an inside seat if the weather is in the least damp, or almost whether or not: you have no idea what a task it is to sit all day motionless on the coach-roof in the month of <date when="0000-10-00">October</date>; under cloud of night it were madness to attempt it. Recollect also that truest of adages that <hi rend="italic">stuffing keeps out storm</hi>. In short Jack you see there are almost as many ways of getting to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, as miles between you and it. Take any of them you judge fittest; and let me see your honest sonsy <supplied>[comely]</supplied> face in Moray-street as soon as possible. Send me a line beforehand, if you can conveniently, marking the day of your departure, and all things will be ready for you when you come.</p>
<p>I have not spoken any more to Mrs Mackenzie about your teaching: but I know you have only to shew face, and begin when you see proper. <pb id="pg-02-170" n="02:170"/>It seems possible enough you may get more employment of a similar sort; but if not&#x2014;never care one fig about the matter: I have been arranging medical and other studies in abundance for you; begin them with an ardent heart&#x2014;and let no fear of poverty abate your zeal&#x2014;at least till I cease to have a shilling to divide with you. I shall &#x201C;call upon you legally&#x201D; for reimbursement, when you mount your bag-wig and gold-headed cane, to kill the higher orders of society <foreign><hi rend="italic">secundum artem</hi></foreign> [according to profession]&#x2014;and not till then.</p>
<p>Methinks I see the expectant group of faces which the arrival of this poor sheet has assembled round you, in hopes to hear some tidings of the northern <hi rend="italic">Hypochondriac</hi>; and something like a wrinkle of disappointment beginning to appear on them&#x2014;as they observe how fast the paper is vanishing, and no tidings at all of the said Hypochondriac in it&#x2014;but stories of Mail-coaches and post-roads and hours of teaching, things far from the point in hand. Tell that friendly and well-beloved circle, that I am well and comfortable as I could wish. Buller&#x2019;s house is becoming more and more a kind of home to me; the elders treat me almost like a son in many respects, the younger members almost like a brother. In fact our studies are going on moderately well&#x2014;there is nothing but good agreement as yet, and I think the thing will do.</p>
<p>Apparently Farries is interred. I have looked for his arrival with ample news from home, for many days&#x2014;and still he comes not. Did my Mother get the letter I sent by George Currie? The next I write shall be to Alick. Has he begun his trading speculations yet? Our Father will now be busy securing the remainder of the harvest: but I expect to hear from him by the earliest opportunity. Give my kindest love to all the brethren and sisters great and small; I hope to send them letters &#x26;c individually by the return of the box. <foreign>Adueu</foreign>, Jack&#x2014;<foreign><hi rend="italic">jusqu&#x2019;au revoir</hi></foreign> [until we meet again]! <closer><salute>I am ever thine affectionate Brother,</salute></closer></p>
<name>Thomas Carlyle</name>
<ps><p>I had a letter from Edw<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Irving lately, in which he asks kindly after you; and also talks of an obligation, which he <hi rend="italic">had</hi> to communicate with James Johnston (to whom remember me kindly), but which Collins&#x2019; letter has now in a great measure superseded.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Irving wrote, <date when="1822-09-23">23 Sept.</date>: &#x201C;Also let me know of Mr Johnstone, whom I should have written to, but finding that Collins of Glasgow had done it already I did not feel called on so much. How is your Brother. If I can be of any service to him now or afterwards, freely use me.&#x201D;</note>&#x2014; I design <pb id="pg-02-171" n="02:171"/>writing to Kirkchrist<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >An ancient parish in the south of Kirkcudbrightshire and new home of the Church family formerly of Hitchill.</note> about Duncan one of these days.&#x2014; Tell my dear Mother to be at ease about me, and to take care of my comfort by taking care of her own.

<salute>My dear Alick,</salute>
<p>I began a small note last night, wherein I designed to set forth at the greatest convenient length, whatever struck me as most notable in my situation here; but before I had got thro&#x2019; the first three lines, the unhappy Crone of Scaills came in with his great wooden visage to interrupt my enterprize,&#x2014;from which accordingly I was obliged very shortly and abruptly to desist&#x2014;lest I should altogether afflict beyond remedy the melancholy pedagogue who had come to me for consolation under the first <hi rend="italic">ennui</hi> of his return to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>. Jack, I suppose, has explained to you how we have been so fortunate as to obtain a respite<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >From the Legendre translation.</note> after all, and opportunity to write letters by the Waffler at our leisure. There is perhaps some little stretch made in the interpretation of the fourth commandment&#x2014;in order to sanction our proceeding at present; but if not under the head of &#x201C;necessity&#x201D; it may surely come under that of &#x201C;mercy&#x201D;&#x2014;considering the virtuous pleasure I expect to give and to receive by writing to you; and there I leave it, with casuists more able to decide the merits of the question than I am.</p>
<p>With regard to my private history since I left Mainhill, you must already have got ample information in the many and large epistles which I have indited and sent home. I have only at present to continue your satisfaction by again saying that I feel quite pleasantly situated, my circumstances fit me pretty accurately, and I am happier than I have been for many years. There is not I believe any real satisfaction in this Earth: nor is it fitting there should be; we were not sent into it to enjoy but to act, and so stupid a sot is Man that unless for the spur of some real or fancied necessity he would too probably become first quiet, then lazy, then inert, and at last be little better <pb id="pg-02-172" n="02:172"/>than one of the <hi rend="italic">Seven Sleepers</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The seven noble youths of Ephesus, who in the time of the Decian persecution <date when="0250-00-00"><hi rend="small-caps">a.d.</hi> 250</date> fled into a cavern and fell into a sleep from which they were not awakened for two hundred years.</note> themselves. So the roughest lot that any of us gets here below is not half so rough as it looks at first. For my own share I am sometimes quite pleased at being discontented; because it seems, if I were not so, that nothing would remain but to degenerate into a fat contented Son of Sloth&#x2014;having no remembrance of yesterday no hope of tomorrow except what depended on the enjoyments that arose in the course of them and perished when they were done.</p>
<p>So far as concerns the externals of my present situation, however, I were a renegade to complain. The Bullers young and old behave to me with perfect kindness, treating me with a degree of consideration adequate to the height of my own conceptions. I see no airs arising from their superior station&#x2014;nor if I did should I value them much: some men are rich and others poor; but every man has a circle, narrower or wider, of <hi rend="italic">his own</hi>, and so long as he keeps within the circuit of that, he may walk at his ease without either distrust or defiance, conscious that he can defend his own rights effectually whoever may attack them, and therefore not jealous of their being attacked,&#x2014;allowing to wealth the respect that wholesome custom demands for it, and reserving his private veneration for qualities with which wealth or poverty has nothing whatever to do. Upon these principles I keep myself in very good humour with every thing, and go along quite smoothly. The older people are &#x201C;canny talkers&#x201D; too, &#x26; we pass our daily two hours together very pleasantly. The boys also are doing <supplied>[mo]</supplied>derately well. In short I think it will answer&#x2014;at least as a temporary <hi rend="italic">upputting</hi> [accommodation]; and in that light alone I have always viewed it.</p>
<p>Now, my dear Alick, after this very lengthy and gratuitous detail of my feelings and condition, allow me to ask a similar detail of yours. I am not ignorant of the many incumbrances that press upon one circumstanced as you are, nor of the manly patience with which you encounter them; but I call upon you to be unreserved in your communications with me, and above all to consider that if within the narrow circle of my ability there lies any efforth that can serve you in the smallest, you cannot gratify me so much as by demanding it. We have always been brothers in the best sense of the word; and it would mortify me exceedingly to think that false pride or any similar feeling had prevented you from using any of my slender but most freely-offered <pb id="pg-02-173" n="02:173"/>resources. One thing I am determined on&#x2014;with regard to that mercantile speculation<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >An unsuccessful venture in horse-buying.</note> of which I am the sleeping partner, you shall embark in it freely as if the funds were <hi rend="italic">wholly yours</hi>&#x2014;or I shall call you a stingy, jealous, faint-hearted&#x2014;very bad character&#x2014;for a long time. Think of this, and plague me with no more speaking on the matter&#x2014;for you know my real mind completely.</p>
<p>As you will have double duty in the way of letters to fulfil this winter, I design taking your case into consideration&#x2014;and writing you oftener than you can write to me&#x2014; Nevertheless if this render you negligent of me in that particular, depend upon it you shall be punished in some shape &#x201C;by the laws in that case made and provided.&#x201D; So be <hi rend="italic">cash-shus</hi>, as the Waffler says, be <hi rend="italic">cash-shus</hi>!&#x2014; Jack is going to <foreign><hi rend="italic">hafft</hi></foreign> with [establish himself in] Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>&#x2014;that is, take with the <hi rend="italic">gang</hi>&#x2014;in a day or two.&#x2014; Give my love to all our sisters and to Jamie that most spirited of husbandmen. But for the Waffler&#x2019;s delays, I had books &#x26;c in view: but there is a time coming! <closer><salute>Write largely to</salute></closer></p>
<p><closer><salute>Your affectionate Brother,</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name></p>

<salute>My dear Father,</salute>
<p>On coming out of my temporary abode in India-street, I was met to-day about noon, by the good Jack, holding in his hands a letter, on which I was happy to recognize your well-known handwriting. By the aid of my &#x201C;learning&#x201D; and other faculties, I succeeded without difficulty not only in &#x201C;making out&#x201D; the epistle, but also in deriving great pleasure from the task of doing so. We next proceeded to a Book-shop, and procured the work you asked for,&#x2014;along with some Bibles for the other branches of the family, and two small memorials, the one for Jane the other for Jenny. I am now down writing with all the speed I can, hoping to make out a letter for you, before the hour of my departure <pb id="pg-02-174" n="02:174"/>arrive; and careful rather of the quantity than the quality of what I say&#x2014;which I know is your principle also.</p>
<p>I am very sorry to hear of Alick&#x2019;s bad success in the matter of horse-buying&#x2014;the more so, as I conceived that a long experience in the dishonesties of Jockies had fortified him against imposition from that knavish set of people. I trust however that before this time, he is returned with a satisfactory adjustment of all difficulties; and enriched in caution far beyond what he is impoverished in money. After all, to mistake at times is the common lot of mankind; and Alick has committed fewer errors than most people so circumstanced would have done.</p>
<p>It is melancholy to reflect on the prospect which these times hold out to many industrious people, particularly to the farmer situated as you describe him to be. It seems clear that ere long an effectual change must be made generally in the terms which bind that useful class of the community to their landlords, or a universal ruin of our agriculture will be the inevitable result. For an individual, there is plainly no remedy as things stand, but a patient endurance of what so many must endure along with him, and a rigid determination like yours to make the best of what is at best but a bad concern. We have all reason to be thankful, that if you cannot stand the pressure of these ill times, there are few or none that can hope to stand it.</p>
<p>But I am fast filling up my allotted space, with reflexions which you yourself have made a hundred times; instead of giving you some details about myself, which I know you greatly prefer. Happily my duty on this head may be soon discharged. I am still in the same state of comfort which I described myself to be enjoying last time I wrote. The people are very agreeable and kind to me; the pupils go on at a reasonable rate in their studies: in short all is very nearly as it should be. I have sometimes a day of languor and bilious disquietude; but in that respect also I am improving; and a strict attention to the results of former experience is generally sufficient to guard against any considerable inconvenience. I have not lost half a nights sleep since I returned to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>.</p>
<p>All this is very pleasant in the mean time; and may continue to be so, for a good while to come: yet I should be a very stupid person if I set my ultimate hopes upon it, and did not look beyond the period of its termination to a fresh scene of exertions and wants, which it behoves me at present to be making every effort to provide against. Accordingly, my chief desire now is that I were fairly engaged in the execution of some enterprize which might present a likelihood of being <pb id="pg-02-175" n="02:175"/>permanently and substantially useful to me. I am trying all that in me lies to fix upon some literary undertaking of the sort referred to; and I expect to find no complete rest&#x2014;indeed I wish to find none&#x2014; until I am fairly overhead in the composition of some <hi rend="italic">valuable</hi> Book; a project which I have talked about till I am ashamed, and shall therefore say no more concerning at this time.</p>
<p>Jack&#x2019;s presence here I find to be very agreeable to me. He is a<supplied>[s]</supplied> quiet diligent friendly <supplied>[a]</supplied> soul as ever broke bread: it is pleasa<supplied>[nt to]</supplied> me to <supplied>[find]</supplied> his broad placid face looking forth good will to me, when I return from the days exertions. I think he has a good chance to fall into teaching in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>; and get himself qualified for earning his bread in some independent and respectable station; a purpose which he himself is anxious even more than enough to accomplish. Of his final success I have no doubt.</p>
<p>There is nothing in the shape of news that I can send you from our City at present: the place seems very quiet, and what little stir there does exist in it very rarely comes the length of my abode. In Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> properly so called I do not appear, once in the fortnight. My path from India-street and to it supplies me with bodily exercise sufficient; and it leads me away by a succession of clean well-paved streets up the very back of the New Town, where I feel too happy to escape the noise and smoke of the old black Harlot, ever to give myself much trouble about what is passing within her precincts.</p>
<p>While I was writing&#x2014;about five minutes ago, the Carrier Geordie<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Farries.</note> came to say or rather to try to say that he could not take up the box to-day. I sent my Mother&#x2019;s spectacles along with him, and a pair of shoes which must be returned to Shaw at Dumfries, being uselessly little. If he can make a bigger pair and stronger he may send them.

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I have literally only ten minutes to write you in; but knowing your mind in that respect, I think it better to send you the smallest note in the world rather than none at all; and accordingly I am at work, writing with as much spirit as if I had an hour before me.</p>
<p>One reason that impels me is the wish I feel to have more precise and certain information about the state of your health and spirits than I have obtained for some weeks: and next time the Carrier comes out, I expect to hear a minute account of the condition in which you find yourself, now that the hurly-burly of harvest is over, and you have leisure to collect yourself so far as to consider and say how it actually fares with you. I will hope that you study by all means to make yourself comfortable, and keep the measure of health that is allowed you; and which you cannot doubt is a greater blessing to all of us, than we have in the world besides. I give you the most strict injunction to be no moment in want of any thing which I can procure for you. I should think it the worst usage you could give me, if you yielded to the voice of any foolish scruple in such a case, and held your peace when any effort of mine might help you. What is there in this world that is half so valuable to us as to love one another, and to live in the hope of loving one another forever? I do intreat of you to let me know whenever I can serve you in the smallest matter. The spectacles we have sent down: they seem not a jot the worse; and having two pairs, you will now be enabled to sew &#x26;c with the inferior pair, keeping the <hi rend="italic">bettermost</hi> for Church and other such occasions.</p>
<p>Tell me truly do you get tea every day? If you do not, I <hi rend="italic">command</hi> you (being a man skilful in such matters) and therefore entitled to command) to get into the practice of habitually taking it, without delay. I know it is useful to you; and it would spoil the taste of my own to think that you were unserved.</p>
<p>But my time is elapsed, and I must run. It is half-past five, and I have not dined yet! I design to send you a long discussion about these <hi rend="italic">greet</hi> <supplied>[fol]</supplied>k some day soon. They do not seem a whit happier than you&#x2014;not a single whit<supplied>[.]</supplied></p>
<p><pb id="pg-02-177" n="02:177"/>Give my respects and love to all the people about <hi rend="italic">Mainhill</hi>. We have a hope to see you here in winter! <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign> My dear Mother! I am ever yours</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Friend,</salute>
<p>I should not have disobeyed your command about not writing again till I heard from you, had it not been that the Bullers are greatly in want of O&#x2019;Meara,&#x2014;which accordingly I have promised to give them to-morrow. If you want to examine the Book farther, tell me, and I will send you another copy&#x2014;</p>
<p>I thank you a thousand times for your highland letter. It is the most elegant, lively, kind, mischieveous little thing I ever read. I do not believe there are three men in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> that have such a correspondent as I have. Heaven grant I may long be so happy!</p>
<p>You are not to write to-morrow unless perfectly at leisure. That were to defraud me of a pleasure which I have been calculating on for the last three weeks; and which I am as loth as ever to forego. What <hi rend="italic">are</hi> the merits of your new friend?<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Benjamin Bell. See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18200000-JBW-EA-01">JBW to <sic>ES</sic><corr>EA</corr>, [early <date when="1820-00-00">1820</date>?]</ref>.</note>&#x2014;that the old may try to rival him&#x2014;or if that be hopeless at least to love him. Tell me also what your plans are for the winter&#x2014;what you wish to study or to write: above all, tell me how in some shape or other I may be of service to you. Do not neglect to send me your verses: but for your concurrence I am almost ready to abandon that enterprise forever. Witness those truly Della-cruscan lines from the &#x201C;German of Goethe.&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably &#x201C;Faust&#x2019;s Curse,&#x201D; published in part in the <hi rend="italic">Athenaeum</hi>, <date when="1832-01-06">6 Jan. 1832</date>, and in A.

But the lines could be &#x201C;The Fisher,&#x201D; A. Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">LL</hi>, II, 342&#x2013;43. Carlyle&#x2019;s comment on the style fits &#x201C;Faust&#x2019;s Curse&#x201D; better.</note></p>
<p>There is a new Periodical Work coming out;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">The Liberal</hi>, edited by Leigh Hunt.</note> in which it is said Byron is to take a large share. It will be the cleverest performance extant in that case. I will send it to you whenever it arrives.</p>
<p>Excuse this feeblest and stupidest and most hurried of Notes. I <pb id="pg-02-178" n="02:178"/>am going to submit to you all my views and projects, the very first day I may. <closer><salute>Believe me to be at all times</salute></closer></p>

<ps><p>In speaking of O&#x2019;Meara, I calculated on your being returned to Haddington; which perhaps I had no right to-do. If the Book do not come tomorrow, I shall infer that I have been wrong; and next day I may possibly extend my ride a few miles eastward, and bring the &#x201C;voice&#x201D; home in my hand.</p>
<p>If <supplied>[I]</supplied> fear you will not care about Milman&#x2019;s poems. I send them only by way of <hi rend="italic">vehicle</hi>: and it is no matter when they be returned.</p></ps>

<salute>My dear Sir</salute>
<p>I should not think you unreasonable though your <supplied>[you]</supplied> were in very bad humour with me at present&#x2014; This unfortunate O&#x2019;Meara, It was the merest chance he was not sent to extend his localities in the Highlands. I would have returned the book immediately, finding how long it had been here, had the subject been any other than Napoleon&#x2014;however I made what haste I could with it; but though I read whenever a temporary cessation of civilities on the part of the inhabitants left a minute at my own disposal, I only finished it at twelve o&#x2019;cloke the night you wrote for it&#x2014; I meant to send a note with it in the morning, but I never awoke till the coach was ready to start&#x2014; M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Buller like Napoleon better than I do!&#x2014;how do you know that? I do not think any human being can love and admire him more than I do&#x2014; when a mere child I could have sacrificed my life to free him from captivity, and win for my name one line in the history of his life&#x2014;do not in future make such gratuitous assertions&#x2014;</p>
<p>I liked Milman&#x2019;s books better than your scanty recommendation led me to expect&#x2014; The gentleman is certainly a poet&#x2014;he excells in description&#x2014;the outlines of his pictures want charecter but his colouring is rich and brilliant, and on the whole his manner is very graceful&#x2014;he fails sadly when he makes his personages speak and feel&#x2014;however &#x201C;the Bright City&#x201D; is not without heart&#x2014;the episode of Lilian and Vortimer<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Characters in the epic <hi rend="italic">Samor, the Lord of the Bright City</hi> (<date when="1818-00-00">1818</date>) by Henry Hart Milman (<date when="1791-00-00">1791</date>&#x2013;<date when="1868-00-00">1868</date>). The episode to which Jane refers is in Book IV.</note> <pb id="pg-02-179" n="02:179"/>is very natural and pathetic, and Rowena&#x2019;s love is quite Byronical&#x2014; I think if you have not read it, it is worth your time&#x2014; How very presumptuous it is in me to attempt criticising such an Author as Milman!&#x2014;</p>
<p>We only came home a week ago<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >From Fort Augustus.</note>&#x2014;my heart has never been glad since&#x2014;the atmosphere here is as heavy as lead&#x2014;several deaths had happened during our absence&#x2014;all the faces we met looked sorrowful&#x2014;all but my little Shandy&#x2019;s he received us with the most ecstatic joy&#x2014;capering, whining, worrying my gloves, and performing such rapid evolutions on the floor, that I really feared for his <hi rend="italic">intellect</hi>&#x2014;were it not for the magic in that word <hi rend="italic">home</hi> which rivets the heart to the spot where it first beat, I verily believe I should emigrate to the North&#x2014; Oh the &#x2018;Land of hills, glens and warriors,! it&#x2019;s wild, romantic grandeur forms such a contrast with our flat, wearisome cornfield&#x2019; and the people there are so frank, natural, and true-hearted! so different from the cold selfish well-bred beings one lives among!</p>
<p>I was very fond of the military people in the Fort&#x2014;one Lady in particular&#x2014;she vowed everlasting friendship for me, and we have commenced a correspondence since my return&#x2014;she is about twice my age, and twice my size&#x2014;fat, frank, lively, and kind-hearted&#x2014;with a considerable share of highland pride&#x2014;and not one spark of <hi rend="italic">genius</hi> or romance in her composition. I can give no other reason for liking her than that she likes me.</p>
<p>Nothing worth recording occur<supplied>[r]</supplied>ed on our way home except that one of our horses, named Lady Ann&#x2014;(after Lady Ann Fraser<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lady Ann Fraser, wife of Alexander Fraser, master of Saltoun, was the daughter of William Kerr, third Earl of Lothian.</note> I presume) committed a cruel outrage on a duck on the streets of Elgin&#x2014; We spent a day at Fort George<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A fortress projecting into the Moray Firth 9&#xBD; miles northeast of Inverness.</note>&#x2014;and three days in Inverness during the northern meeting <note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;The gathering of the Highland clans&#x201D; (A. Carlyle&#x2019;s note).</note>&#x2014; I was introduced to the <hi rend="italic">King of the Isles</hi>,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-02/lt-18221028-TC-JBW-01">TC to JBW, [<date when="1822-10-28">28 Oct.</date>]</ref>.</note> who is worth knowing as a curiosity of folly&#x2014;he told a friend of mine who was blaming him for not uncovering his head in the presence of his Sovereign &#x2018;that the people made Kings but only God Almighty made <hi rend="italic">a Chief</hi>!!&#x2019; We were two days in Aberdeen. Our <hi rend="italic">one</hi> acquaintance there, to whom my Mother had written our intention of returning that way, was disabled from attending us&#x2014;on the preceeding day, elate<supplied>[d]</supplied> with <pb id="pg-02-180" n="02:180"/>the hope of seeing us so soon he performed a somerset over a horse seventeen hands high and cracked a stone with the back of his head&#x2014;</p>
<p>The most unpleasant part of our journey was a night we spent in the Star Inn at Perth. they brought us, for supper, a feathered hen that might have laid eggs in the reign of George the second; and gave us a bed in which we were nearly drowned by the rain that poured in through the ceiling&#x2014; I dare say you are sick to death of my travels&#x2014;but I assure you to me the subject is very interesting&#x2014;</p>
<p>Now for my new friend<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Benjamin Bell.</note> who had almost escaped my memory&#x2014; What shall I begin with? his height? I think it was what I first remarked&#x2014; well! he is about six feet two&#x2014;rather slender and very graceful&#x2014;his features are not regularly handsome; but his countenance is extremely pleasing and intelligent&#x2014;he dresses somewhat fantastically&#x2014;wears an amethyst ring on one of his fingers&#x2014;a steel chain with a very ingenious, portable perspective (to denote he is an artist)&#x2014;and a shining black leather belt with silver lion&#x2019;s heads in front&#x2014;in spite of all this his exterior is gentleman-like without puppyism&#x2014;and his manner elegant and highly polished without affectation&#x2014; His judgement is accurate&#x2014;his taste exquisite&#x2014;and he is gifted with a very quick perception of the ridiculous&#x2014;he has read twice as much as most young men of his age; but his studies do not seem to have been properly directed&#x2014;nor has his mind sufficiently digested the knowledge it has acquired<supplied>[&#x2014;]</supplied>he is clever, enterprising, and ambitious&#x2014;that expression of yours &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">all in good time</hi>&#x201D; is never heard from <hi rend="italic">his</hi> lips&#x2014; I recommended to him to study german, one Saturday, he commenced it under a Master on Monday, and by the Monday following he had read half of one of Schiller&#x2019;s plays&#x2014; I think he is affectionate for he loves to talk about his Mother, who is one of the lov<supplied>[e]</supplied>liest women in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, and famed for her superior understanding&#x2014; In short he is no every-day person&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">but</hi>&#x2014;he has no <hi rend="italic">genius</hi>&#x2014; I have just seen him twice!!&#x2014;our acquaintance commenced three months ago&#x2014; We rode to Presmenen Lake<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >An artificial lake near Stenton in Haddingtonshire.</note>&#x2014;a beautiful rider he is!&#x2014;and his practice of looking in the heavens for cumuli and strata and nonsense, affords him many opportunities of displaying his horsemanship at the risk of his neck&#x2014; On his return to town he sent me &#x201C;Hooker&#x2019;s ec<supplied>[c]</supplied>lesiastical polity,&#x2019; &#x2018;Reynold&#x2019;s Works&#x2019;<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Richard Hooker (<date when="1554-00-00">1554</date>?&#x2013;<date when="1600-00-00">1600</date>), <hi rend="italic">Of the Lawes of Ecclesiastical Polity</hi> (<date when="1593-00-00">1593</date>&#x2013;<date when="1597-00-00">97</date>); and Edward Reynolds (<date when="1599-00-00">1599</date>&#x2013;<date when="1676-00-00">1676</date>), <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> (<date when="1658-00-00">1658</date>).

He set out for London the day before the King&#x2019;s landing&#x2014;set out tho&#x2019; he might have supposed I would be in town that very day!&#x2014; He is gone to Germany and Italy&#x2014; It will be eighteen months before he returns&#x2014;no matter&#x2014;</p>
<p>You ask me my plans for winter, and what I wish to study or to write&#x2014; At present my life is without a plan I may almost say without an aim&#x2014; I wish to study every thing&#x2014;and to write poems, novels, tragedies, essays, &#x26;c &#x26;c &#x26;c</p>
<p>These last two months of idleness have done me a deal of mischief&#x2014; I cannot study seriously for an hour&#x2014;I have even forgot the way to rhyme&#x2014; I shall die in a few years without having written anything&#x2014;die&#x2014;and be forgotten&#x2014; Do take my case into consideration&#x2014;and tell me what to do&#x2014; Write me a long letter as soon as you like and let me know all your design. It is with a feeling of regret, you would scarcely give me credit for, that I see your days fleeting away unmarked by one struggle for im<supplied>[m]</supplied>ortality&#x2014; Oh if I had your talents what a different use I would make of them! But I will not blame you; for you seem sufficiently sensible of the sinfulness of your own inactivity&#x2014;</p>
<p>I was horrified the other day to find Lord Byron&#x2019;s letter<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jane appears to be referring to a printed rather than manuscript letter by Byron.

<salute>My dear Friend,</salute>
<p>I know not whether it be that I am grown more <hi rend="italic">reasonable</hi> of late than formerly, but certain it is that I never in my life felt less inclined to be in &#x201C;bad humour&#x201D; with you than at present. For a long while, our intercourse, unlike what it once was, has been a source of unmixed pleasure to me; and the present complexion of it, I rejoice to say, seems to afford the hope of its being as permanent as any thing so delightful can be expected to be. When you write in the <hi rend="italic">proper</hi> style, your letters have a power at once to gratify and to excite me which almost nothing else has: there is always some sharp fillip for my vanities, and some voice to awaken and direct my exertions&#x2014;something shewn me to be done, and something to be avoided; and the whole is accomplished in a manner which might give inanity itself some value. I daresay you wonder at these salutary effects of your compositions; yet I do not overrate the matter, but the contrary. Last Friday, for instance, what a fine bright region of dreams arose over my stagnant imagination, when your letter was spread out before me! There was the Celt Glengarry, misplaced in these manufacturing times as much as some Mammoth or Mastodonton would be at the Tryst of Falkirk;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle is referring to the &#x201C;King of the Isles,&#x201D; whom Jane had met at the &#x201C;northern meeting&#x201D; mentioned in her last letter. This is Alastair Ranaldson Macdonell of Glengarry (d. <date when="1828-00-00">1828</date>), called the last of the real Highland chiefs, said to have been Scott&#x2019;s model for Fergus MacIvor in <hi rend="italic">Waverley</hi>. He claimed, on his visit to Edinburgh for George IV&#x2019;s visit in <date when="1822-00-00">1822</date>, the right to be, with his body of retainers in full Highland dress, in the King&#x2019;s bodyguard and to swear them in on his own responsibility. In her letter of <ref target="volume-02/lt-18220924-JBW-TC-01"><date when="1822-09-24">24 Sept.</date></ref> Jane speaks of the &#x201C;Falkirk fair,&#x201D; also called the Falkirk tryst. The <hi rend="italic">Scotsman</hi> says that it began Monday, <date when="1822-10-07">7 Oct.</date>, that year.</note> then the somerset, and the new mode of splitting rocks invented at Aberdeen; then the tragedy of the Elgin duck, and the venerable pullet of St Johnstown<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The old name for Perth.</note>&#x2014;on both of which ill-fated fowls I design to write some elegaic stanzas the first time I feel melancholy enough to do them justice. Nay even with regard to your <hi rend="italic">new friend</hi>, <pb id="pg-02-184" n="02:184"/>tho&#x2019; viewing him with the &#x201C;jealous leer malign&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi>, IV, 503.</note> so natural in such a case, I could not help admitting him to be a very dashing gallant fellow, and well worth all the attention you have given him, and more. I must envy him his equestrian powers, if they often lead him on such journeys as the one to Lammerlaw. Did he write these verses? If so, he seems young at the art like us, but not without powers of doing better: dactyls are always difficult to manage, and his accordingly are but a kind of flash in the pan&#x2014;no damage is done; but the other piece has a sort of swaggering <foreign><hi rend="italic">pococurante</hi></foreign> [little-caring] air about it which looks more like genius and truth, and answers greatly better. Except the last stanza, they are <hi rend="italic">good</hi>. If he is only about twenty years of age or so, he may cultivate poetry with considerable hope: if nearer thirty I advise him never to write another line.</p>
<p>But I am wasting my paper with these gossipings, forgetful of my chief object in taking up the pen at present. It is very unfortunate for any one to live without a settled plan, still more so for one like you; and happy indeed should I be if any effort of mine could deliver you from such a situation. Nor am I without hopes of effecting this purpose: for unless I am greatly mistaken in my estimate of your resources, there is not any thing desperate or even very difficult in the case. I know the common error of underrating the difficulties of our neighbour as much as we overrate our own: but certainly it seems to me that the proportion between your wishes and your power of accomplishing them is more favourable than with the great majority of the world. Your object is simple&#x2014;the attainment of intellectual eminence, which you look upon and justly as the first of mortal distinctions: your means of attaining it are abundant&#x2014;a genius which I have often characterised, ardour as yet unabated, and domestic comfort in every sense, including a total freedom as well from that heart-breaking isolation, as those thousand vulgar cares about &#x201C;what you shall eat or what you shall drink or wherewithal you shall be clothed,&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Matt. 6:25.</note> under which most people labour, and in which the great mass of mankind find a sufficient some times an excessive occupation all their days. Where then is the difficulty? In your circumstances, I imagine I could produce a very glorious result. I would rigidly set apart some hours of every day for the purposes of study; I would read and think and imagine; I would familiarize myself with whatever great or noble thing men have done or conceived since the commencement of civilization&#x2014;that is I would study their history, their philosophy, their <pb id="pg-02-185" n="02:185"/>literature&#x2014;endeavouring all the while not merely to recollect but to apply, not merely to have in my possession but to nourish myself with all these accumulated stores of the Past, and to strengthen my hands with them for adding to the stores of the Future. In about two or at most three years from this date, I would thus have before my mind a distinct and vivid conception of the <foreign><hi rend="italic">mani&#xE8;re d&#x2019;&#xEA;tre</hi></foreign> [way of life] of all the great characters that have ever lived&#x2014;in order to borrow from them whatever beauty could be imitated in my own character&#x2014;which is the first great benefit of education; I would would [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] have a no less vivid conception of all that is most picturesque or spirit-stirring in the fortunes of our race&#x2014;all that they have done and endured and discovered&#x2014;which forms at once the wealth of the imagination and the understanding&#x2014;the materials on which they operate, and is the other great benefit of education. And in collecting all this mental riches, I would be attentive also to improve my powers of distributing it: I would cultivate the art of composition in its widest meaning; I would write verse and prose, grave things and gay, matters of reasoning and of fancy according as my humour might direct. After all which long training, I would look forth on the wide empire which I had thus conquered, and acquired the skill to govern; I would select the fairest and finest province in it, which I would cultivate and adorn with all my heart and soul; if I could increase the general inheritance of mankind&#x2014;how glorious my destiny!&#x2014;if not, I should at least have longed to do it, I should have travelled thro&#x2019; the wilderness of life surrounded with solemn and elevating and noble objects, and I should die with the spirit of a man that had endeavoured well&#x2014;and only failed because Nature never meant he should succeed.</p>
<p>In all this I am sensible there is far too much vagueness and generality: it is the impossibility of writing all that might be said on the subject, which forces me to sketch only the outline, and leave the filling of it up to a fairer opportunity. If I saw you for two hours&#x2014;to question and suggest&#x2014;to consult and discuss by word of mouth, it might be different. In the mean time I cannot avoid again recommending one branch of study which ought to lie at the root of all others, and in which if I mistake not you are still deficient. It is the study of history, the easiest the most entertaining and the most instructive of all; the foundation of which may be laid in a few months, tho&#x2019; many diligent readers neglect all their lives to lay it. Have you finished Hume yet? Have you ever read Robertson and Gibbon? There are Greece and Rome which well merit your attention, if they have not yet gained it; and a multitude of authors good and bad are at hand to direct in <pb id="pg-02-186" n="02:186"/>this undertaking. Did you ever read Plutarch or Vertot or Rollin?<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charles Rollin (<date when="1661-00-00">1661</date>&#x2013;<date when="1741-00-00">1741</date>), <hi rend="italic">Histoire ancienne</hi> (<date when="1730-00-00">1730</date>&#x2013;<date when="1738-00-00">38</date>), <hi rend="italic">Histoire Romaine</hi> (<date when="1738-00-00">1738</date>&#x2013;<date when="1748-00-00">48</date>); Ren&#xE9;-Aubert de Vertot (<date when="1655-00-00">1655</date>&#x2013;<date when="1735-00-00">1735</date>), probably <hi rend="italic">Histoire des revolutions arriv&#xE9;es dans le gouvernment de la republique romaine</hi> (<date when="1719-00-00">1719</date>).</note> You see I know not how to come to particulars: but here is room enough for a great quantity of useful labour, tho&#x2019; I cannot specify it distinctly. Then for modern times, we have Gibbon (worth reading on other accounts, tho&#x2019; he is an infidel and a rather heartless person) and M&#xfc;ller<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Johannes von M&#xfc;ller (<date when="1752-00-00">1752</date>&#x2013;<date when="1809-00-00">1809</date>), <hi rend="italic">Die Geschichte Schweizerischen Eidgenossenschaft</hi>, 5 vols. (Leipzig, <date when="1796-00-00">1796</date>&#x2013;<date when="1808-00-00">1808</date>).</note> and Watson and Sismondi and Lacratelle<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jean Charles Dominique de Lacretelle (<date when="1736-00-00">1736</date>&#x2013;<date when="1811-00-00">1811</date>), <hi rend="italic">Histoire de France pendant les guerres de religion,</hi> 4 vols.

With regard to philosophy I need not say any thing at present&#x2014;or criticism&#x2014;or those parts of the sciences which might suit you: there is work enough for a time without them.</p>
<p>Now, my dear Pupil, if you are at all giving ear to this confused sermon of mine, I can easily fancy the state of despondency and helplessness into which it has already cast you. You contemplate a task without limits, in which you know not how to begin, and see not where you shall end. Such feelings are natural but groundless. Give but four hours a day to serious study&#x2014;give them constantly faithfully inflexibly&#x2014;reserving the other twelve to your Mother and your friends and those accomplishments and amusements which befit your sex and rank: the celerity and success with which you may get thro&#x2019; the work will far surpass your hopes. What may you not have learned even before winter is done! It will make you far happier too: for no thinking creature can sit easy under the idea that time &#x201C;the stuff that life is made of&#x201D;<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Benjamin Franklin, maxims prefixed to <hi rend="italic">Poor Richard&#x2019;s Almanac</hi> for <date when="1758-00-00">1758</date>.</note> continues wasting drop by drop and leaving no trace behind it. I would absolutely set about this undertaking, were I in your place, and that without delay. I would make the silly people in my neighbourhood respect my purposes and cease to interfere with their fulfilment. What an arrangement that thoughts and aims directed as it were to Eternity itself should be thwarted and obstructed by the shallow movements of people whose only object is to live! Tell them that these four hours are sacred to the hopes of Immortality&#x2014;that you <hi rend="italic">will</hi> be uninterrupted in the use of them; and they will cease to interrupt you. If any murmur, if any sneer; let them have their humour out: a little while will shew who <hi rend="italic">were</hi> the gainers, and it is only theirs to laugh.</p>
<p>If I conceived less highly of my beloved pupil, I would prescribe <pb id="pg-02-187" n="02:187"/>more moderate duties for her: but as matters stand, this sketch contains the rude draught (rude enough certainly) of what in my real opinion were best be done. You see I have formed a lofty idea of what you are destined to become&#x2014;a person rich in solid knowledge, and habituated to the use of strong and brilliant faculties. Without this, there may be smartness and shew, but no true greatness: you may write elegant trifles, but never shew yourself a woman of a sublime and commanding mind. You see also that I exclude the idea of any thing like publication for the present. In truth I do not see what should hurry you in this respect. I am far from insensible to the pleasures of fame: at the same time, it is to <hi rend="italic">be</hi> not to <hi rend="italic">seem</hi> that one should labour; and if the former is attained, the latter will inevitably follow&#x2014;or may stay if it likes, for then its value is but secondary. What matters it indeed whether another pays you reverence, provided you are sure that at any given moment you <hi rend="italic">have</hi> force of mind enough to lay him prostrate whenever you think proper? There is even a kind of pleasure in being despised by some blockheads. The certainty you have of their gross blindness, the sense of your own magnanimity in sustaining their injustice, does more than console you for the loss of what in itself is of so very little value. This is a doctrine, you will say, peculiar to myself: in fact I would not have you act upon it too largely; but it is fit we be persuaded that worth not currency is the rational object&#x2014;that if we have the gold, the coining of it is a far inferior matter. I cannot call that mind a really great one which does not feel so. Percival Stockdale<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-02/lt-18230120-TC-JBW-01">TC to JBW, <date when="1823-01-20">20 Jan. 1823</date></ref>.</note> went nearly altogether mad out of eagerness for the glory which he never could deserve: Lord Bacon calmly entrusted the care of his works &#x201C;to posterity when two centuries should have elapsed.&#x201D; I conceive that even at present you might write a very amusing novel or light work of that sort; but I should regret to see you do so: it would appear frivolous to yourself at some future day&#x2014;or what were worse&#x2014;it might lead your mind into a class of trivial pursuits, and bring about the bad exchange of precocity for strength. Aim rather at something far higher: become a truly accomplished and richly-furnished person first; and then what thing is impossible to you?</p>
<p>But I must bring this tedious lecture to a close at last. I have managed it so badly that I fear you will find it difficult to make out my project after all I have said about it. The leading idea lies vaguely and indefinitely within my own mind, and of course I explain it obscurely; but I am persuaded of its correctness. I beg you to give the matter your attention seriously, and to let me have your views respecting <pb id="pg-02-188" n="02:188"/>it as soon as possible. If you purpose to let me see your face within any measurable space of time, I promise to make every thing clear and precise; if otherwise, I will write till you understand plainly, or grow altogether tired of my stupidity. I would not weary you to death all at once; so I leave it for the present.</p>
<p>It is kind in you to ask after my designs; but your kindness must meet a very unworthy requital. I shall only again vex you with the stupid picture of broken resolutions and empty regrets, of incessant restlessness and no advancement, of the most glorious projects and the meanest execution. What an ass! I sit and spin out long plans which it would require a lifetime to complete; I feel astonished at my own temerity when I approach the commencement of them; I faulter, I hesitate, and at length give them up in despair. Meanwhile the few sands of existence are hastening away, the noon of life is already fleeting over me, and &#x201C;the night cometh wherein no man can work.&#x201D;<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. John 9:4.</note> I know I deserve your contempt; I am fast securing my own. It is vain for me to urge in excuse that I must first be liberated from these grinding cares, these ignoble toils, this anxiety about the humblest circumstances of the future, this separation from all kindred minds, this weak and wayward state of health: I was born to endure these things, and must endure them to the end of time, unless my own hand deliver me; and how shall it deliver me except by previously effecting what I like a child would willingly postpone? Sometimes I candidly believe myself to be the weakest most imprudent driveller now extant.</p>
<p>Four months ago I had a splendid plan of treating the history of England during the Commonwealth in a new style&#x2014;not by way of regular narrative&#x2014;for which I felt too well my inequality, but by grouping together the most singular manifestations of mind that occurred then under distinct heads&#x2014;selecting some remarkable person as the representative of each class, and trying to explain and illustrate their excellencies and defects, all that was curious in their fortune as individuals, or in their formation as members of the human family, by the most striking methods I could devise. Already my characters were fixed upon&#x2014;Laud, Fox, Clarendon, Cromwell, Milton, Hambden [Hampden]; already I was busied in the study of their works; when that wretched Philomath with his sines and tangents<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. Brewster with Legendre and mathematics.</note> came to put me in mind of a prior engagement,&#x2014;to obstruct my efforts in this undertaking, and at length to drive them totally away. Next I thought of some work of imagination: I would paint, in a brief but <pb id="pg-02-189" n="02:189"/>vivid manner, the old story of a noble mind struggling against an ignoble fate; some fiery yet benignant spirit reaching forth to catch the bright creations of his own fancy and breaking his head against the vulgar obstacles of this lower world: But then what knew I of this lower world? The man must be a hero, and I could only draw the materials of him from myself. rich source of such materials! Besides it were well that he died of love; and your novel&#x2014;love is become a perfect drug; and of the genuine sort I could not undertake to say a word. I once thought of calling in your assistance, that we might work in concert, and make a new hero and heroine such as the world never saw. Could I have obtained your concurrence? Would to Heaven we could make such a thing! Finally I abandoned the project.&#x2014; I have since tried to resume the Commonwealth; but the charm of it is gone: I contemplate with terror the long train of preparation, and the poorness of the result. Now Boyd the fat bookseller would give me something like &#xa3;150 for a solitary life of Milton with notes on his poems, criticisms &#x26;c &#x26;c: last week I was within an ace of accepting his offer. One thing is certain, I cannot live thus. Tell me if you can to what hand I ought to turn me. I am very unhappy often, and deserve to be still more so.</p>
<p>But see!&#x2014;the bottom of my second sheet! I must check this torrent of egotism, and deliver you from my insipidities at last. When will you write to me again? You are a generous creature, or you would not be troubled with me at all. I must also have some poetry if possible; tho&#x2019; I have none to give you&#x2014;for charity itself cannot call by such a name the swashing bombast which I am going to enclose. What put it into your imagination that our unhappy Night-moth<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle&#x2019;s poem &#x201C;Tragedy of the Night-moth&#x201D; is in <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XXVI, 469&#x2013;70. In <hi rend="italic">LL</hi>, I, 94&#x2013;95 n., A. Carlyle says that the poem was published by Ottilie von Goethe in <hi rend="italic">Chaos</hi> about <date when="1830-00-00">1830</date> and that a copy of it in Jane&#x2019;s handwriting is preserved at Weimar in the Goethe archives. (We have no record that it is there today.)</note> was translated? Alas! the poor animal actually perished before my eyes one summer midnight in the Burgh of Kirkcaldy; and like Jerry of the Carlisle newspaper, I <foreign><hi rend="italic">pat eet aw into langish meesel&#x2019;</hi></foreign>. This lest Posterity should mistake the thing.</p>
<p>I have read the &#x201C;bright city,&#x201D; and rejoiced to find your criticism of it so agreeable to my own. Milman is certainly a poet, but he takes a flight higher than he can sustain. He paints too gorgeously and indistinctly, he also whines too much, he is sometimes even liable to cant. I am astonished at your diffidence in judging him: it were well if he always found even critics by profession so well qualified.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-02-190" n="02:190"/>To-morrow I must try to get you O&#x2019;Meara:<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably the second volume.</note> if not, this must go without it, and you shall have the book another time. Byron&#x2019;s Magazine or rather Hunt&#x2019;s &#x201C;the Liberal&#x201D; is arrived in town; but they will not sell it&#x2014;it is so full of Atheism and Radicalism and other noxious <hi rend="italic">isms</hi>. I had a glance of it one evening; I read it thro&#x2019; and found two papers apparently by Byron, and full of talent as well as mischief.<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See C. R.

The work will hardly do. If possible you shall see this number.</p>
<p>Once more then I have done. Be patient with this long scribble for I have sat till mid-night writing it, and of course intended it for good. Write me again when you want to make me happy. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, my most valued friend!</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Friend,</salute>
<p>If I have been somewhat dilatory in fulfilling the engagement which I volunteered to contract at our parting in Annandale, you must be careful not to impute this conduct to anything like forgetfulness of my duties to you or carelessness of what concerns you. The privilege of communicating with you is one which I am ever ready to improve, and the more direct the means of doing so the greater is my readiness. In fact I would have written long ago, but for two or three reasons which I am sure even you will admit to have been conclusive. In the first place, I have been excessively occupied since we parted,&#x2014;teased with regulating the formalities of my new situation&#x2014;with arranging hours and studies and devising plans to quicken indolence and repress levity: in the second place I have lived almost a total stranger to the whole world since that period, and so have had no shadow of what is called <hi rend="italic">news</hi> to tell anyone: while in the third place the state of my own feelings has been so exceedingly pitiful and wishy-washy, that <pb id="pg-02-191" n="02:191"/>I could not in conscience determine to afflict any Christian person with the smallest description of them. All which circumstances taken together form, I think, a very cogent exculpatory proof; and being peculiar to my own case, no one of them I trust will be of any service in yours, or at all extenuate your guilt should you (feloniously and traitorously) determine to treat me according to the <foreign><hi rend="italic">lex talionis</hi></foreign>.</p>
<p>I am getting acquainted with the Bullers; and I like them and the place they have given me quite as much as I anticipated. They are very good people, I conceive; particularly good, considering all things. The more I see of their mode of life, however, the more thankful I am that Providence did not create me a &#x201C;person of quality&#x201D;: I verily believe if it had been so, I should have gone entirely distracted long ago. The back, they say, is made for the burden; but really I do not think mine could ever have sustained the labour of existing in such a ceaseless round of insipid formalities, of concealed disquietudes, of strenuous inanities as that unhappy portion of our species is born to. It is really astonishing to think how much is done&#x2014;and to how little purpose; how great a sacrifice there is of effort, how very small a return of real enjoyment. I am perfectly positive at present that with three hundred pounds a year, I could be far happier&#x2014;all other things being equal&#x2014;than three-fourths of the people that have a hundred times the sum.</p>
<p>From the benignant sympathy which I am here expressing for the sufferings of my fellow creatures, you may possibly infer that my own sufferings are on the decrease: I rather incline to think that it is my Christian charity which is growing. One thing at least is certain, I am very unhappy at present. I feel called upon by a voice of terror to <hi rend="italic">bestir myself</hi>, to be up and doing while it is called to-day; and a thousand miserable causes&#x2014;indecision, ignorance, dyspepsia, &#x26;c., &#x26;c., &#x26;c., keep me rivetted to the spot: I cannot advance, I cannot stay; I am certainly the weakest of the weak. I believe I shall sit down at last, and eat beef like other people&#x2014;contented with the idea that I was born a dolt; and acquiescing cordially in the celebrated <foreign><hi rend="italic">fiat</hi></foreign> of the Middlebie <foreign>Laird</foreign>. He was listening to a parson, who having but a moderate power of delivery, found it difficult to advance beyond the very words of his text, &#x26; accordingly kept singing and bawling in a variety of notes these remarkable expressions, and nothing more, &#x201C;he that is unholy, let him be unholy still&#x201D;; whereas the indignant clodhopper clapping on his broad-brimmed hat stalked forth of the Kirk repeating with a corresponding intonation and more bitter emphasis, <pb id="pg-02-192" n="02:192"/>&#x201C;<hi rend="italic">he</hi> that is a stupid Jackass, let him be a jack-ass still!&#x201D; A word is enough to the wise!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf.

<p>Some time ago I had a line from Irving,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dated <date when="1822-09-23">23 Sept.</date></note> wherein due mention is made of &#x201C;William Graham that best-hearted of men, and most intelligent of merchants.&#x201D; I rejoice to think that the generous soul is prospering as he should, and likely to realize all our hopes in London. His sermon, Gordon tells us, has been reviewed <hi rend="italic">somewhere</hi>, and favourably: he could not mention <hi rend="italic">where</hi>. I have heard a great deal about this &#x201C;farewell address&#x201D;&#x2014;a proof at least that it is no common performance. All people seem agreed in applauding the delineation he gives of his intercourse with the poor of St. John&#x2019;s; almost (but not altogether) all in condemning large masses of the rest. Irving will redeem what is faulty and make good what is defective, all in due season, beyond a doubt.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The review could have been the one in the <hi rend="italic">Eclectic Review</hi> mentioned later by Graham (<ref target="volume-02/lt-18221221-TC-WG-01">TC to WG, <date when="1822-12-21">21 Dec.</date></ref>) or it could have been a review of the sermon as it was actually delivered, Glasgow <hi rend="italic">Herald</hi>, <date when="1822-06-08">8 June 1822</date>. This comments: &#x201C;The apparent uncouthness of his [Irving&#x2019;s] mind and strangeness of his manner, no less than the independence of his mind, and the freeness and boldness with which he canvasses opinions and doctrines the most prominent and unquestioned in systems of theology, and the most generally received and familiar to the popular faith, will ever prevent him becoming a favourite <hi rend="italic">Preacher</hi> with the <hi rend="italic">many</hi>; &#x2026; but still, go where he may, the amiableness and condescension of his private manners in his intercourse with the poor and illiterate will amply compensate for any defect . &#x2026; We must say in general, however, that it contains some passages of eminent beauty and feeling, and others which proved their author to be possessed of the boldness and independence of mind which usually accompanies genius.&#x201D; For the sermon (on 2 Cor. 13:11), see &#x201C;Farewell Discourse to the Congregation and Parish of St John&#x2019;s Glasgow&#x201D; (<date when="1822-00-00">1822</date>) in <hi rend="italic">Collected Works</hi> (<date when="1864-00-00">1864</date>), III, 343&#x2013;62.</note></p>
<p>This letter of mine, you must already have discovered, is the most barren and languid and desultory of letters: it has been written in the midst of hurry and distraction; and was meant only to accomplish one object&#x2014;in which I do hope it will still be successful&#x2014;the drawing forth of an early letter from you in return. I need not say how much I long to hear your news; to learn how it fares with you, and to obtain a passing glimpse of the many kind people and interesting events which your city has in store for me. What <hi rend="italic">is</hi> to be the result of your chemical inventions? I trust they are already beginning to be rewarded: but if not, you know too well how many obstacles there must be to retard the fulfillment of such a scheme&#x2014;to lose heart about the success of this, however it may stand at present. I long to have before me everything you are engaged in&#x2014;what you do,&#x2014;feel, hope for. I <pb id="pg-02-193" n="02:193"/>fear I shall not see Glasgow for a long while; when are you to be in Edinburgh? There is the same accommodation for you here as ever; the same <hi rend="italic">readiness</hi> on the part of honest Wilkie, the same sincere tho&#x2019; inefficient anxiety on my part. Brother Jack is with me, and desires me to send his most respectful compliments. If you do not write to me soon, I shall&#x2014;write to you (and if possible far more stupidly) again, one of these days: so look to yourself. Remember me kindly with explanations &#x26;c., to Mr. Hope: Have Mr. &#x26; Mrs. Johnstone come? If so deliver my best respects. <closer><salute>Excuse this blundering letter, and believe me to be at all times; my dear Friend,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I called yesterday at Dr Brewster&#x2019;s, but did not find him; and as it is uncertain when I may again have leisure to make such a circuit, I am fain to sit down and give you my decision about the Article Perspective<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18211225-TC-AGA-01">TC to <sic>AG</sic><corr>AGA</corr>, <date when="1821-12-25">25 Dec. 1821</date></ref>.</note> with the limited information which I already possess on the <pb id="pg-02-194" n="02:194"/>subject. With regard to correcting the press, I presume you cannot have any doubt concerning my readiness to undertake so trifling a service; and if the Doctor have in his possession the List of Books you mention, the whole matter may be accomplished quite easily. If he have not, perhaps the best method will be to take no farther thought about it. I ought also to premise that if your demonstrations are in any degree complicated or abstruse, it will be the safer plan to make arrangements for seeing the proof-sheets after I have done my part to them; because both on account of my ignorance of the subject, and my too habitual inattention, I might otherwise be liable to commit oversights of a nature to mar and disfigure your doubtless very able and learned performance. This expedient however will I hope be superfluous: I suggest it merely to quiet your fears in case of need.</p>
<p>You are very kind in directing my attention to the approaching vacancy at Sandhurst.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle was a candidate for the professorship of mathematics at the Royal Military College at Sandhurst. See <ref target="volume-02/lt-18221118-TC-JBW-01">TC to JBW, <date when="1822-11-18">18 Nov.</date></ref>, and <ref target="volume-02/lt-18221204-TC-JCE-01">TC to <sic>JC</sic><corr>JCE</corr>, <date when="1822-12-04">4 Dec. 1822</date></ref>.</note> I have turned the affair over in my mind; but my ideas respecting it are too vague and obscure for admitting any final determination. At present I know only that the college buildings stand in a fair champaign not far from the village of Bagshot, that the pupils are from 14 to 18 years of age, that the professors enjoy a salary of &#xa3;180 a year with various perquisites, and that the whole establishment is commanded by one Colonel Butler<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Col. James Butler, Lieutenant-Governor of Sandhurst, <date when="1811-00-00">1811</date>&#x2013;<date when="1829-00-00">29</date>. See Hugh Thomas, <hi rend="italic">The Story of Sandhurst</hi> (London, <date when="1961-00-00">1961</date>).</note>: but what kind of labour&#x2014; what degree of contradiction from superiors or inferiors&#x2014;I should have to undergo, what society the place affords, what conveniencies for study or improvement of any kind, are points on which I can form no judgement whatever. Can you find leisure for describing them? If you would hand me a sketch of your own mode of existence, it would answer two very beneficial purposes; would satisfy my selfish curiosity and my social, both at once. After which investigation, granting the issue to be favourable, there would only remain this query: By what steps, by what solicitations, by whose interest could the office be obtained? If this were all before me, I imagine it would easily be in my power to decide both whether I could and whether I ought to aim at acquiring the place. And the opening looks so fair at this distance, that I shall request you to spend the first vacant hour you have in conveying to me some more definite views respecting it. You are not ignorant that I dislike the business of teaching in all its forms: but the condition of life in most cases is but drudgery in one part to <pb id="pg-02-195" n="02:195"/>get enjoyment in the other. Sandhurst offers one a secure and permanent shelter from all that is worst in the inclemencies of common fortune: unless very barren indeed of higher enjoyments it is well worthy of attention in that point of view.</p>
<p>I figure you as being very anxious for something in the shape of news from this region; and it give<supplied>[s]</supplied> me pain to think that I have none to send you. The conclusion of <hi rend="italic">your</hi> controversy, the check sustained by Dr B. and the ultimate discomfiture of the learned Expositor of <hi rend="italic">Continued fractions</hi> or <hi rend="italic">vanishing fractions</hi>, must be known to you thro&#x2019; the medium of the newspapers, and my own information in the matter reaches no farther. Some relics of the Doctor&#x2019;s battle still hover on the edges of the field, but the centre like Bonaparte&#x2019;s at Waterloo appears to be <foreign><hi rend="italic">culbut&#xE9; et renvers&#xE9;</hi></foreign> [upset and overthrown], and a good retreat is the best that can be hoped. Have you seen Dr Ures notice of Leslie&#x2019;s Meteorology, in Brande&#x2019;s Journal?<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Andrew Ure (<date when="1778-00-00">1778</date>&#x2013;<date when="1857-00-00">1857</date>), Scottish chemist and author of books on chemistry; Sir John Leslie, <hi rend="italic">Description of Instruments, Designed for Extending and Improving Meteorological Observations</hi> (<date when="1820-00-00">1820</date>); William Thomas Brande (<date when="1788-00-00">1788</date>&#x2013;<date when="1866-00-00">1866</date>), chemist, with Faraday edited the <hi rend="italic">Quarterly Journal of Science and the Arts</hi>.

The first two articles, seemingly Byron&#x2019;s, are exceedingly potent&#x2014;very clever and very wicked: the rest is in Hunt&#x2019;s vein, and no better or worse than a common Examiner.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">The Examiner</hi> (<date when="1808-00-00">1808</date>&#x2013;<date when="1881-00-00">81</date>), founded by Leigh and John Hunt and edited by Leigh Hunt until <date when="1821-00-00">1821</date>, was probably edited at this time by Henry Leigh Hunt, John&#x2019;s son. Byron&#x2019;s contributions to the first number of <hi rend="italic">The Liberal</hi> were &#x201C;The Vision of Judgment,&#x201D; &#x201C;Letter to the Editor of &#x2018;My Grandmother&#x2019;s Review,&#x2019;&#x201D; and &#x201C;Epigrams on Lord Castlereagh.&#x201D;</note></p>
<p>For myself, I am still warping along this shelvy sea of existence as best I may&#x2014;the tide and wind as usual at times befriending me, at times opposing. When the College-classes are once fairly begun, and my pupils settled in them, I expect to have the whole forenoons unbroken to myself; and <hi rend="italic">then</hi>&#x2014;to read&#x2014;to write&#x2014;to&#x2014;in short to do wonders!

<p>I wish you would write to me soon, and tell me every thing about yourself and Sandhurst: I long to determine whether I shall be your colleague; and chop logic with you as of old: at present I meet with <pb id="pg-02-196" n="02:196"/>no dialectician tough enough to stand above a round or two; so I am forced to seek for other exercise than sparring. <closer><salute>Excuse this hurried letter; and believe me to be,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear friend</salute>
<p>If ever I succeed in distinguishing myself above the common herd of little Misses, thine will be the honour of my success. Repeatedly have your salutary counsels, and little well-timed flatteries roused me from inactivity when my own reason was of no avail. Our meeting forms a memorable epoch in my history; for my acquaintance with you has from its very commencement powerfully influenced my character &#x26; life. When you saw me for the first time, I was wretched beyond description&#x2014;grief at the loss of the only being I ever loved with my whole soul had weakened my body and mind&#x2014;distraction of various kinds had relaxed my habits of industry&#x2014;I had no counsellor that could direct me&#x2014;no friend that understood me&#x2014;the pole-star of my life was lost, and the world looked a dreary blank&#x2014; Without plan, hope, or aim I had lived two years when my good angel sent you hither&#x2014; I had never heard the language of talent and genius but from my Father&#x2019;s lips&#x2014; I had thought that I should never hear it more&#x2014;you spoke like him&#x2014;your eloquence awoke in my soul the slumbering admirations and ambitions that <hi rend="italic">His</hi> first kindled there&#x2014; I wept to think, the mind he had cultivated with such anxious, unremitting pains was running to desolation; and I returned with renewed strength and ardour to the life that he had destined me to lead&#x2014; But in my studies I have neither the same pleasures, or the same motives as formerly&#x2014; I am <hi rend="italic">alone</hi>, and no one loves me better for my industry&#x2014;this solitude together with distrust of my own talents, despair of ennobling my character, and the discouragement I meet with in devoting myself to a literary <pb id="pg-02-197" n="02:197"/>life would, I believe, have, oftener than once, thrown me into a state of helpless despondency; had not your friendship restored me to myself, by supplying (in as much as they can ever be supplied) the counsels and incit<supplied>[e]</supplied>ments I have lost&#x2014; You see I am not insensible to the value of your friendship, or likely to through [throw] it away; tho&#x2019; you have sometimes charged me with inconstancy and caprice&#x2014;</p>
<p>There is no plainer way of testifying my entire approval of the matter contained in your last letter than rigidly adhering to the plan you have sketched for me. This I am endeavouring to do&#x2014; I immediately commenced an active search through the libraries of my acquaintance for some of the books you named. Hume I have commenced and recommenced so many many times, that I cannot now look with patience on a volume of the same shape and colour. therefore I prefer<supplied>[r]</supplied>ed acqu<supplied>[a]</supplied>inting myself with the history of England through the medium of Clarendon. Clarendon however is &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">out of fashion</hi>.&#x2019; My next attempt was on Rollin and that proved more successful. I read his Ancient History in my infancy; but remembered no more of it than the number of volumes. I have already finished the first volume, (writing little foolish reflections as I proceed)&#x2014;during the last week I have also read the latter half of &#x2018;Maria Stuart&#x2019;&#x2014;some scenes of Alfieri&#x2014;and a portion of &#x2018;Tacitus&#x2019; (which by the way is the hardest Latin I ever saw)&#x2014;when you devoted four hours of my day to the study of history, what did you mean should become of my Italian and my dear dear German? I have no inclination to part with these, and accordingly I mean to devote four hours more, equally &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">constantly, faithfully and inflexibly</hi>&#x2019; to the study of languages. What is the reason I cannot read the first part of &#x2018;Wallenstein&#x2019;? I was just beginning to congratulate myself upon my progress in the German Tongue (&#x2018;Maria Stuart&#x2019; was so intelligible) and now I find I know nothing at all about it. Have you ever read &#x2018;Rosmunda&#x2019;?<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A tragedy by Alfieri (<date when="1804-00-00">1804</date>).</note> if you have not you never saw women in a proper rage. Oh! it is a furious, bloody business&#x2014; I think Alfieri must have written it with a live coal in his Stomach&#x2014; I had almost forgot the Curse.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">The Curse of Kehama</hi> (<date when="1810-00-00">1810</date>), by Robert Southey.</note> I cannot make up my mind about it&#x2014;my judgement is quite bewildered amid its striking beauties and gross deformities; But though I cannot decide upon the work, I <hi rend="italic">can</hi> upon its author. He must either be the craziest or the most conceited mortal that ever invented rhymes. Nothing but derangement or unbounded admiration of his own genius could have emboldened him to violate as he has done all laws of criticism and commonsense, I should like <pb id="pg-02-198" n="02:198"/>well to have <hi rend="italic">conceived</hi> &#x2018;The curse of Kehama&#x2019;&#x2014; But I would not have <hi rend="italic">written</hi> it for a thousand guineas.</p>
<p>I believe I told you I had got a sort of friend in the highlands&#x2014; You must understand I had not been at Ardachy a day till I for<supplied>[e]</supplied>saw I should find little favour there in propria persona; and so I thought it adviseable to play the part of a lively, dashing, goodhumoured, thoughtless blockhead of a girl&#x2014; you cannot think how this character <hi rend="italic">took</hi>&#x2014;it won the hearts of the women and turned the heads of all the men in the place. This M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Spalding<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The friend with whom Jane mentions corresponding, <ref target="volume-02/lt-18221024-JBW-TC-01">JBW to TC, [<date when="1822-10-24">24 Oct.</date>]</ref>.</note> was the <hi rend="italic">greatest</hi> of my admirers. She showed me so much confidence and kindness that I really felt exceedingly obliged to her, and inclined to like her as well as I possibly could like so fat a woman. All sorts of civilities were exchanged betwixt us, and, at parting, we agreed to continue our intercourse by letters. accordingly I wrote to her immediately on my return home; but mark the sequel!&#x2014;yesterday came her answer, cold, short, and formal. I could nowise account for the seeming change in her dispositions towards me, until I discovered she was activated by the same spirit as the young Lady that <hi rend="italic">could do something</hi>. She tells me that <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;she feels her own inferiority at the pen; but will always be glad to reply to my letters in her humble way</hi><supplied>[.]</supplied>&#x201D; She then proceeds to ask my advice about the education of her daughter, and begs me to look about for a governess for her. On the same sheet of paper is a letter from her husband (an english officer in the Fort)<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Capt. Spalding. See <ref target="volume-02/lt-18230118-JBW-TC-01">JBW to TC, <date when="1823-01-18">18 Jan. 1823</date></ref>.</note> which begins with &#x201C;If you choose to be a blue stocking do you think or expect we common people can answer you in the same style?&#x201D; the whole letter is filled with allusions to my &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">blue-stocking talents</hi>&#x201D; as he is pleased to style writing grammar. Here is all the kindliness of our intercourse frozen at once by this wretched jealousy. Something like this has been the <hi rend="italic">history</hi> of all the attachments I ever formed with <hi rend="italic">women</hi>&#x2014;&#x2014; However; the <hi rend="italic">episode</hi> of <hi rend="italic">the Governess</hi> is quite original&#x2014;</p>

<salute>My dear Alick,</salute>
<p>I have been guilty of writing you several very meagre and unsatisfactory letters since my arrival; for which I know you have already invented a sufficient excuse in the circumstances under which I usually sit down to correspond with you&#x2014;the irregularity of our Courier&#x2019;s (or rather <hi rend="italic">Creeper&#x2019;s</hi>) movements, and the haste and abstraction of mind which often falls to my lot at the period of his appearance. Such considerations may satisfy you; but to me they are not enough: I am vexed that I do not get more talk with you, and determined to embrace every opportunity of getting all I can. Accordingly I no sooner learned this day that a character whom the Bullers call &#x201C;uncle Clive&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably Henry Clive, who married Buller&#x2019;s sister, Charlotte Jane. He was the son of George Clive, M.P. for Bishop&#x2019;s Castle.</note> and who possesses the valuable faculty of franking letters, was arrived in India-street, than I determined to set apart some portion of the evening to the purpose of scribbling a few lines to you, of telling you more minutely how it fares with myself and asking more pointedly how it fares with you.</p>
<p>&#x201C;According to this plan, I am therefore in the first place&#x201D; to set forth in a few words how I stand with regard to the health <hi rend="italic">part of it</hi>; a topic which I have at least discussed five hundred times, and never I have reason to be thankful without finding in you a willing and anxious hearer. This time I have good news to give you on that head: For the last few days I have been better on the whole than during a <pb id="pg-02-200" n="02:200"/>For the last few days I have been better on the whole than during a like space any time these two years. No day passes without its share of pain; but of late the &#x201C;shares have been diminishing&#x201D; (Heaven grant the whole <hi rend="italic">firm</hi> were broken?); I have written and read and walked and taught with more comfort; the very drugs themselves are used but sparingly. I <hi rend="italic">almost</hi> foresee the time when I shall be as sound as you are: but if I lived for a thousand years I should never forget the gloomy purgatory I have passed thro, never cease to think that such a condition of body is the most black and dismal fate that can befal any son of Adam. Our good honest&#x2019; squire Buller asserts that he has not known any man except a blockhead who would take his life over again if it were offered him; to be born is a misfortune, he says, at all times, and before I live as long, he adds, I shall think so too: yet even he all sable as are his views on that matter admits <hi rend="italic">billus</hi>ness (so the deathless Pears<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Pears, who accompanied Irving and Carlyle on a walking tour through parts of Scotland in <date when="1817-00-00">1817</date>, is delineated in the <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> (II, 43&#x2013;53, 59) as &#x201C;Irving&#x2019;s house-mate or even landlord, Schoolmaster of Abbotshall, <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, of &#x2018;the Links, or <hi rend="italic">southern extra-burghal</hi> part of Kirkcaldy, a cheerful scatterbrained creature, who went ultimately as Preacher or Professor of something to the Cape of Good Hope.&#x201D; Pears went to South Africa in <date when="1829-00-00">1829</date> and joined the Dutch Reformed Church. He was a professor at South Africa College, Capetown, <date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>&#x2013;<date when="1834-00-00">34</date>. The town of Pearston is named after him. He died in <date when="1866-00-00">1866</date>. Cf. also <ref target="volume-01/lt-18200603-TC-EI-01">TC to EI, <date when="1820-06-03">3 June 1820</date></ref>.</note> called it) to be the worst of human ills. Long may you and all the rest I love be ignorant of it! I think I could even pity <foreign><hi rend="italic">Satteen</hi></foreign> [Satan] himself&#x2014;if his stomach were thoroughly disordered.</p>
<p>Jack and I are living in the most commodious manner here. He gets up first in the morning, worries and bustles about till he has got his accoutrements on, and some victual in him, then sallies forth to teach and to be taught, and I see no more of him till six in the evening. He is busied about many things, full of wonder and conten<hi rend="italic">tibility</hi>, anxious for anatomy and chemical mixtures and the laws of motion. He is also very good natured, and bears wonderfully with me when I grow cross at any time. In short he is a very praiseworthy <foreign><hi rend="italic">sloon</hi></foreign> [lazy person] in all respects as you could wish. There he sits, with his large moon-face right over against me, writing <hi rend="italic">notes</hi> and whispering the words before he writes them or chewing his lips the very image of contentment!&#x2014;there he sits &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">and a better han&#x2019; wi&#x2019; beasts never bowed him</hi></foreign>.&#x201D; Duncan Church <note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Son of the Churches of Hitchill, into whose home Carlyle had been introduced through James Johnston, then a tutor to their children, in <date when="1814-00-00">1814</date>, and at whose new home in Galloway he stopped after quitting Edinburgh in <date when="1822-09-00">September</date>. Mr. Church was a farmer and steward of the Queensberry estates while at Hitchill; Mrs. Church was a great aunt of Ruskin&#x2019;s. See <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi>, II, 19, 85; J. M. Sloan, <hi rend="italic">The Carlyle Country</hi> (London, <date when="1904-00-00">1904</date>), pp. 201&#x2013;2.</note> arrived the other day, and we got him placed <pb id="pg-02-201" n="02:201"/>under another landlady within a door of us; I have the whole forenoon to myself undisturbed; so that we are altogether very snug.</p>
<p>We had poor James Johnstone with us lately for a day or two, on his road to Broughty-ferry.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >To accept a teaching position there. The &#x201C;wildgoose schemes of emigration&#x201D; mentioned below were a plan to emigrate to Australia.</note> He is a way-worn, jaded, helpless man: at the same time, the most placid and peaceful-hearted honest creature in being. I am truly sorry to see him so <foreign><hi rend="italic">forfoughten</hi></foreign> [worn-out]. In his new place he hopes for better fortune; and as he seems determined to lay aside his wildgoose schemes of emigration, and to persevere in his present calling, I do not at all despair of his success. Few men deserve better to be happy; few men could be made happy at a cheaper rate.</p>
<p>As you have written me so sparingly as yet, you cannot doubt that considerable obscurity hangs over your proceedings since I left you. In fact I want to know a multitude of things connected with your situation; what you are doing, feeling, thinking; if you get any reading accomplished&#x2014;and what; if you have thought of any merchandize&#x2014;and how: in short I want to know all the outs and ins of your life since we parted; and I do not think you can do better than describe them to me. One thing I cannot cease to inculcate upon you: it is to improve every spare moment as you have been accustomed, by devoting it to the acquirement of useful knowledge; a plan of proceeding which not only yields the most valuable advantages ultimately, but forms the only method I know of for spending the present hours to ones rational satisfaction. I daresay you have some misgivings and despondent fits in these dark times; but I advise and enjoin you to give no place to such ideas. You are a steady hard intelligent able-bodied little fellow&#x2014;that can tread the top of the causeway and fear no man; you have people around you to back you out&#x2014;for are we not all bound together?&#x2014;what then have you to despond about. These times are ruinous for the farmer and the landlord: but the evil is of a kind that must cure itself in the long run&#x2014;or sweep the whole community into the gulf with it, and you are among the last likely to be threatened with it. You have nothing to fear: In a very few years I prophecy that we shall see you seated in <hi rend="italic">your own farm</hi>, a busy an honest, an unwearied, a successful man, with all the comforts that such a man has good right to look for. Write to me at great length&#x2014;if not by the Carrier, take the Post: the expense is trifling, and it gives you far <pb id="pg-02-202" n="02:202"/>next letter shall be addressed.

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I did not get you a single line written last opportunity; and nothing is more natural than that I should attempt to remedy the failure by writing to you now that another occurs. I scribbled a long sheet to Alick last night; and as I have an hour of my own, before going to wait on Dr Brewster (by appointment), I propose to employ it in giving you all my news. If the frank would have carried <hi rend="italic">treble</hi> I should have epistolized my Father also, and thus have discharged the sum total of my debts at once. He shall be served next time.</p>
<p>You have not sent me a line since I went away. I am not surprised at this, knowing how you are circumstanced; but it keeps me very much in the dark with regard to your situation &#x26; proceedings. I can only hope that you are in the usual state of health and spirits, fighting as formerly against the inconveniences of your present life, and brightening all its dreariness by the hopes of a better. There is nothing else that can keep the happiest of us in a state of peace&#x2014;worth calling by the name of peace; and with this &#x201C;anchor of the soul both sure and steadfast&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and stedfast&#x201D; (Heb. 6:19).</note> the unhappiest man alive is to be envied. You think I am a very thoughtless character, careless of Eternity and taken up with the vain concerns of Time alone. Depend upon it, my dear Mother, you misjudge me. These thoughts are rooted in every reflecting mind&#x2014;in mine perhaps more deeply than in many that make more noise about them: and of all the qualities that I love in you, there is none I so much love as that heroic feeling of devotion which elevates you so much above the meanness of ordinary persons in your situation, which gives to the humble circumstances of your lot a dignity unborrowed of earthly grandeur as well as far superior to the highest state of it, and which ornaments a mind untrained in worldly education and accomplishment with sentiments after which mere literature and philosophy with all their pretensions would forever strive in vain. The <pb id="pg-02-203" n="02:203"/>dress of our opinions, as I have often told you, may be different, because our modes of life have been different; but fundamentally our sentiments are completely the same. We should tolerate each other therefore in this world, where all is weak and obscure; trusting meanwhile that we shall comprehend all things more perfectly in that clearer land where faith is changed into vision&#x2014;where the dim tho&#x2019; fervid longings of our minds from this their dark prison-house are changed for a richness of actual grandeur beyond what the most ardent imagination has ventured to conceive. Long may these hopes be yours, my dear Mother! whoever entertains them is richer than kings.</p>
<p>I must turn, however, to humbler subjects. Alick will tell you that I am recovering my health, and going on well. This beneficial result is likely to be accelerated by a new arrangement, which adds to my comfort in various other respects. The young Bullers are gone to College a few days ago, and I do not go near them till two o&#x2019;clock in the afternoon. By this means I not only secure a competent space of time for my own studies, but find also that my stomach troubles me a good deal less after breakfast than it used to do, when I had a long hurried walk to take before it. I now go out and stroll along the Newhaven road for a quarter of an hour between eight and nine o&#x2019;clock at my leisure, then come and eat my egg and drink my dish of tea in peace and quietness, then read or write till one, then walk about slowly for an hour, and at two present myself in India-street in good heart, comparatively speaking, and ready to go thro&#x2019; my duties with alacrity.
They are of an easy and brief sort: I dine at half-past three with a small and very civil youth (little Reginald<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >(<date when="1813-00-00">1813</date>?&#x2013;80), youngest of the Bullers, later minister of Troston, where he was visited by the Carlyles in <date when="1842-00-00">1842</date> and where he is buried.</note>&#x2014;contracted into <hi rend="italic">Reggy</hi>), and have generally done with the whole against six. I find Jack sitting immersed in study when I return: he cooks the tea for us; and we afterwards devote ourselves to business till between eleven and twelve. Scarcely a soul interrupts us thro&#x2019; the week, for we live far from the habitations of the <hi rend="italic">Craft</hi>, and so command our time for our own purposes. I never was much more comfortable all my days. I would not have believed Peden<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alexander Peden (<date when="1626-00-00">1626</date>?&#x2013;<date when="1686-00-00">86</date>), covenanter and prophet. <hi rend="italic">The Life and Prophecies of Mr. Alexander Peden</hi> was published in Edinburgh in <date when="1776-00-00">1776</date>.</note> himself if he had predicted that it would be so twelve months ago.</p>
<p>The socks and shirts, which your kind care provided for me, I have tried and found to suit exactly. I am now rich in such articles. Did Sandy remit the shoes to Shaw? I wish he would ascertain whether <pb id="pg-02-204" n="02:204"/>the body means to make another pair; and if so, would give directions to have them made considerably stronger and almost half an inch longer. They may be sent to Ecclefechan or directly hither when ever they are ready. The first pair fitted me well, but the next I was obliged to give to Jack: the boot-feet are also just the thing&#x2014;if not rather too big; but a shoe which pinches is worse than none. Will you also tell Alick to look out for the Review in which <hi rend="italic">Faust</hi> is and send it; or <hi rend="italic">Faust</hi> by itself if the paper is any way clean. It is of little consequence any way. Jack also wants &#x201C;Playfairs Outlines of Natural Philosophy&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >By John Playfair, published <date when="1812-00-00">1812</date>&#x2013;<date when="1816-00-00">16</date>.</note> both the volumes of which Alick will find at home, and send by the first chance.&#x2014; I must now finish, My good Mother, for the hour is come and the paper is at an end. Give my brotherly love to all the <foreign>younkers</foreign> [youngsters] about home, to each by name. Why do they never write? Will you not write? <closer><salute>I am ever affectionately&#x2014;your son&#x2014; (thy <hi rend="italic">son</hi>!!!)

<salute>My dear Friend,</salute>
<p>If instead of deriving so much pure enjoyment from our intercourse, I had spent long years of toil and difficulty in your service, the sentiments expressed in your last letter would be an abundant recompense. I am more than flattered by what you say to me: if I could fairly merit the continuance of such feelings, there are few men I should have cause to envy. The irreparable loss you have sustained is but too well known to me; I had heard of the virtues and talents of your Father long before I dreamed that you and I should ever be acquainted; the sad and speechless affection with which you cherished his memory was the first feature of your character that struck me; no lovelier one shall I ever discover there. If it were possible that any exertions of mine could never so remotely contribute to perfect what he had so nobly commenced, I should regard our meeting as a blessed incident whatever might betide; I should feel as if this restless, fluctuating, and at times too painful life had not been given me all in vain. As it is,&#x2014;with me far more than you the day when we first saw each other must be forever memorable. I as little think of classing it among the ordinary dates of my history, as I do of classing you among the ordinary <pb id="pg-02-205" n="02:205"/>mortals who have happened to become known to me. Such beings I had thought of, perhaps hoped to find; but it was long&#x2014;very long ago. You speak of advantages and obligations: if I might tell you all, you would see a very different state of matters. If I might paint to you how wasted and woe-begone I was&#x2014;a prey to black inquietudes which had me sick of existence itself and reckless of aught good or evil that it had to offer me,&#x2014;when I saw you, like an inhabitant of some more blessed sphere as I almost believed you, descend upon my desolate and dreary path which was fast going down, to the gates of Death,&#x2014;and call me back to light, and life, and hopes more glorious than I had ever dared to form; if&#x2014; But I must not go on with this: you would laugh at me as a crack-brained enthusiast, or we should have some furious quarrel on the subject which might last for three months to come. It is enough that I am <hi rend="italic">very</hi> happy with you: God grant it may always be so!</p>
<p>Your last letter shews more plainly than ever that except in the pursuit of literature there is no peace for you in this world. Your tastes, your passions are all getting concentrated upon this object: it is the &#x201C;radiant orb&#x201D; as Nelson expressed it,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Carlyle&#x2019;s &#x201C;Nelson,&#x201D; in <hi rend="italic">Montaigne and Other Essays</hi>, ed., S. R. Crockett (London and Philadelphia, <date when="1897-00-00">1897</date>), p. 71.</note> which will urge you on through every difficulty, and reward you with its splendour at last. I rejoice at your feeling thus. None but a very young or a very stupid person can exist at all without some determinate purpose to fill up the mind; and of all the purposes which engage mortals in this busy Earth I know none so praiseworthy as this. How much more noble is it to obey the impulse of such a generous ambition, wherever it may lead, than to toil and jostle for wealth or worldly precedence, which even when they are gained are but the <hi rend="italic">symbols</hi> of dignity and are often worn by the basest of mankind! Here, on the other hand, is a free and independent scene of effort, where no low artifice no pitiful humiliation of the mind can be of any use, where all that is worthiest in our nature finds ample scope, where success is in our own hands, and each addition to our knowledge each improvement in our sentiments <hi rend="italic">is</hi> a genuine treasure which the world can neither give nor take away.</p>
<p>My advice to you therefore is not that you should relax in your exertions, or check your ardour&#x2014;this were to sin against both your permanent interests and your present comfort; &#x2014;but rather that you should regulate your efforts so that in the end the total result of them may be the greatest possible. Zeal you have in abundance, and talents which when I consider your past opportunities often strike me with <pb id="pg-02-206" n="02:206"/>wonder; the only thing you want, and it forms a fatal drawback, is the humble but indispensable quality of <hi rend="italic">regularity</hi>. If you will only engage to form some settled plan of distributing your time, and to adhere to it with unrelenting integrity for half a year, I prophecy that before the end of that period, the beauty of order will have acquired such charms in your eyes that you will never again deviate from its dictates; and this being given, I take all the rest upon myself: If <hi rend="italic">my</hi> own Scholar do not become one of the ornaments of her age and country, I am content to forfeit all my critical reputation forever.</p>
<p>Nothing accordingly could give me greater pleasure or better hopes than to find you already sensible of these preliminaries, and already firmly bent on conforming to them. I rejoice that you have commenced seriously to study history; and the best wish I can form for your real progress is that you may persist without flinching. Chance has directed you well: Rollin is as good a book as any other to begin with. Then you may have Gillies&#x2019; or Mitford&#x2019;s Greece<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Histories of Greece by John Gillies and by William Mitford. See <ref target="volume-02/lt-18230112-TC-JBW-01">TC to JBW, <date when="1823-01-12">12 Jan. 1823</date></ref>.</note> and Fergusson&#x2019;s Rome,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >By Adam Ferguson. See <hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>.</note> then Gibbon; and you are well equipt for attacking the moderns. You need not take any thought about procuring these works: I can send them all out to you without the slightest difficulty. Why did you not apply to me at once? Does it not furnish me with an excuse for scribbling these long sheets to you, and compel you to talk with me in return? You also do well to take notes&#x2014;tho&#x2019; not too largely from so shallow a personage as M. Rollin. Have you got any ancient maps? or a Lempriere&#x2019;s classical dictionary? Tell me pointedly. Geography and chronology have been justly named the <hi rend="italic">two windows</hi> of history; they are in fact the two first requisites in the study of it&#x2014;nothing of themselves, but, combined with other advantages, of essential value. I know not whether I have done well to interrupt the steady progress of your reading, by the perusal of this <hi rend="italic">Bossuet&#x2019;s Histoire Universelle</hi>:<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jacques B&#xE9;nigne Bossuet (<date when="1627-00-00">1627</date>&#x2013;<date when="1704-00-00">1704</date>), <hi rend="italic">Discours sur l&#x2019;Histoire Universelle</hi> (Paris, <date when="1681-00-00">1681</date>).</note> you can try a little of it, and if you do not relish it, throw it by. In about two days you may read all in it that <supplied>[is]</supplied> worth reading: for I advise you totally to pass over all that he says or sings about the Jews and the Church and the prophecies&#x2014;it is well for the bishop of Meaux,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Bossuet was made Bishop of Meaux in <date when="1681-00-00">1681</date>.</note> but too old by a century for us. When you have fully surveyed this sketch of the whole field of history, then return to fill it up gradually&#x2014;to study your Rollin with might and main.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-02-207" n="02:207"/>These other four hours for languages &#x26;c I am apprehensive will not answer: it is too much for you; more than you can give, more than you need give. I meant that four hours should serve for all; six hours I consider as the very maximum. You observe I did not include in this allotment the time you may spend in reading novels, poetry &#x26;c; these are amusements and may be followed or suspended as inclination prompts: I stipulated only for a certain portion of your day to be religiously devoted to laborious study, that you should work with all your heart during four hours, and consider a neglect of your appointment as a violation of duty. If you have two hours more which you can give to German Latin Italian, so much the better, they may occupy your evenings usefully; but depend upon it two hours are abundantly enough. You laugh at me when I talk of health: my dearest friend, it is a sad and serious truth: I verily believe I should run mad if I knew you to be in such a state as excess of confinement and mental exertion will reduce any one to. I once thought like you that I had a frame of iron: I was mistaken there. No! six hours are all that I can possibly grant you; four are all that I require; and I answer for the result.</p>
<p>Now you must take all this into your serious consideration; lay down some scheme of distributing your time, not more liberal than you can conveniently adhere to; and above all, <hi rend="italic">persist in it inflexibly</hi>. Tell me what arrangement you have entered into, that I may have before me a full picture of your usual life, that I may praise you if I find that you continue constant, or scold you for negligence as vehemently as you have often scolded me. I pity you with Tacitus; you should not toil too much over the cramp passages of it: mark them all and we will sit in judgement over them next time we meet. Do the same with Wallenstein; which by the way it is not in the least surprising that you cannot read, the first part of it being about as difficult as any German I ever saw. What remains however is much easier as well as more interesting. If you do not like the heroic Max Piccolomini and that angel Thekla, <note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Characters in Schiller&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Wallenstein</hi>.</note> I shall never forgive you. Wallenstein himself is one of the most gigantic, calm, imposing characters to be found in tragedy. Rosamunda I have not seen: but Buller is to begin Italian in spring, when I must go over all those things in earnest. Have you any dictionary but Graglia&#x2019;s?<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18190219-TC-TM-01">TC to TM, <date when="1819-02-19">19 Feb. 1819</date></ref>.</note></p>
<p>I am charmed to find you so zealous in the cause of the &#x201C;heroine.&#x201D; I have been revolving the subject myself; and I am almost determined <pb id="pg-02-208" n="02:208"/>to begin! I do think sometimes that we two could write a very moderate novel: and then to come forth <hi rend="italic">together</hi>&#x2014;to mingle our ideas&#x2014;to be as one in that matter!&#x2014;the very thought is delightful. But oh! the <foreign><hi rend="italic">vis inertiae</hi></foreign> [power of slothfulness] that is in me! I am miserable till I commence something; yet commence I cannot. Was there ever such a fool! But it is needless to talk. It must be now or <hi rend="italic">never</hi>. My business is arranged at present so that I do not see the Bullers till two o&#x2019;clock, and have done with them before tea; I am at liberty all the morning, in better health than I have been for two years; in short if I do not now at least try to effect something, I deserve to pine in cold obstruction all my days.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A rather odd echo of &#x201C;to lie in cold obstruction and to rot&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Measure for Measure</hi>, III, i).</note> Will you collect all your ideas on the matter&#x2014;think seriously of it&#x2014;not as a chimera but as a thing actually to be done; and then listen to what I shall propose next time I write. I shall either have abandoned the project altogether, or have some definite plan to communicate for your inspection and cooperation. Perhaps I shall have actually begun. &#x201C;Begin then!&#x201D; you say: well, who knows but it were best to dash at once into the subject without farther parley, and leave the rest to Providence? <foreign><hi rend="italic">Rusticus expectat dum defluat amnis</hi></foreign> &#x26;c [The rustic waits till the river flows past (i.e., runs dry)]<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Horace, <hi rend="italic">Epistles</hi>, I, 2, 42.</note>&#x2014;but it will never, never flow away.</p>
<p>Since I wrote last there was a man, whom I knew here,<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alexander Galloway.</note> sent me advice to become a candidate for a Professorship of Mathematics in the R. M. College at Sandhurst in Surr<supplied>[e]</supplied>y, which he seems to be of opinion I might easily secure. The emolument he says is &#xa3;200 per an., with a good house and garden; there are two vacations of seven weeks each in the year, and (<foreign>proh pudor</foreign> [for shame]!) &#x201C;liberal allowances for coals and candles<supplied>[.]</supplied>&#x201D; I do not think I have almost any chance to go. However I wrote again to make farther inquiries.&#x2014; The fat Bookseller is laid upon the shelf, I think&#x2014;at least for a time.</p>
<p>Thus, my dear friend, do I keep prating without stint about all my wiseacre devices, and most prosaic concerns. You are too kind, to listen to me so patiently. I have only farther to ask that you would write to me with as much minuteness and as little care. Next to the pleasure of seeing you daily is that of inspecting those delightful little pictures you can give so easily of your daily history. I am angry with that large woman, tho&#x2019; I might have predicted as much: she must just be left to her fate &#x201C;in her own humble way&#x201D; since she will have it so; she <pb id="pg-02-209" n="02:209"/>will not I fear even get a governess from you. I admire the dexterity with which you can adapt yourself to circumstances; it was exceedingly ingenious in you to become the &#x201C;dashing thoughtless good-natured blockhead of a girl&#x201D; you talk of: I can easily believe the character would take; no wonder it took. I also admire the Captain&#x2019;s notions of a &#x201C;blue-stocking.&#x201D; What a royal world this would be, if it were full of Spaldings! No sentiments more pathetic than those of hunger and thirst&#x2014;no wish but for bank-notes and &#x201C;accomplishments&#x201D;&#x2014;the <hi rend="italic">malady of thought</hi> forever gone! After all it is pity that the lady is not <supplied>[una]</supplied>mbitious as she is fat. Some of these fat people are excelle<supplied>[nt crea]</supplied>tur<supplied>[es;]</supplied> they are like cushions on which the restless souls of us lean <supplied>[carewor]</supplied>n wights delight to take repose. I know a person about five feet in diameter, his face &#x201C;round as the shield of my fathers&#x201D; and of the hue of copper, was never wrinkled with a frown; he loves not, hates not, thinks not, but like some great culinary sun he moves about diffusing images of snugness peace and warm substantial cheer on every side: he is now gone down into a Kirk, and I never think of his absence but with something like regret.</p>
<p>Is it not very wrong in you to disturb the repose of Faust? Was he not &#x201C;quietly inurn&#x2019;d&#x201D;<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi>, I, iv.</note> many months ago, beneath a load of rubbish huge as the ruins of Nineveh, and of the same material&#x2014;solid clay? Yet I have sent him; for it is written: Women will have their way. I read it over with much astonishment yesterday. Much good may it do you!</p>
<p>On observing what liberties you had taken with my Pindarics, I strove as much as possible to get into a violent indignation against you&#x2014;but could not succeed. I have nothing in the shape of verse to send you this time; but prose as you perceive in abundance. Here however I must end; even your patience has a limit. I will write more briefly in future. Good night my dear friend! <closer><salute>I long to hear from you about all that concerns you; being ever,</salute></closer></p>
<p><closer><salute>Most affectionately Yours, /</salute></closer> <name>Thomas Carlyle&#x2014;</name></p>
<ps><p>I have examined the paper on the &#x201C;Fine Arts&#x201D;; but as I know not any thing of painting, and only saw Mr W&#x2019;s pictures for about three minutes, all that I can say is that the letter appears to be smartly written: perhaps the author is a little too ambitious of making beautiful sentences; he seems to know more about <foreign><hi rend="italic">chiaro-scuro</hi></foreign>, tints, body-colours &#x26;c than the art of composition.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-02-210" n="02:210"/>I had a fragment of the &#x201C;True-Briton&#x201D; newspaper&#x2014;containing a criticism on Edw<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Irving,<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A report of Irving&#x2019;s discourse of <date when="1822-10-27">27 Oct.</date> in the <hi rend="italic">True Briton</hi>, <date when="1822-11-02">2 Nov.</date></note> who is making an immense figure in London&#x2014;which I meant to send you; but Brother Jack in his zeal against waste-paper burnt it yesterday. I was in a passion with the poor fellow&#x2014;or nearly so, and very undeservedly. He is one of the most honest souls in being. I envy him his zeal for Medicine &#x26; Science.</p></ps>

<salute>My dear Johnston,</salute>
<p>I find you are again at your old tricks, forgetting the promises which your friends extort from you at parting, and careless of satisfying the anxieties they feel on your account. With great justice I might give you a severe rating on that score; but being an old sinner myself, and well aware of the excuses you have to plead both outward and inward, I adopt the milder expedient of believing merely that you are too indolent or too much occupied, have too many things to say or too little time to bring them into form; and I have taken up the pen at present not to write a sentence of condemnation against you but to <hi rend="italic">deal</hi> with you (as the Kirk-sessions have it) in the way of Christian reproof and admonition, trusting that you may still be brought to a sense of your duty by conciliatory methods, and become a faithful correspondent after all. In sober truth, my dear friend, I have nothing whatever to say to you on this occassion except that we are longing to hear news of your situation; and nothing to do except to beg that you will lose no time in satisfying that anxiety. Write whenever you can bring your mind to it.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the absence of all official communications, allow me to hope that matters have turned out as prosperously as you had reason to expect; that you are beginning to overcome some of the difficulties of your commencement, and to taste some of the pleasures and benefits which this undertaking will yield in more and more abundance as you persist in it; that in short you are getting <hi rend="italic">under way</hi>&#x2014;clearing the bar at the pier-head as it were&#x2014;and likely to make a good voyage of it in time. It were of course worse than useless, in me ignorant as I am of all things connected with the subject to attempt speculating on the capabilities of the situation or advising you how <pb id="pg-02-211" n="02:211"/>to turn them to advantage: I wait for farther information, before I form much less deliver any opinion as to those points; but there is one particular on which I cannot avoid expressing a hope that you still abide by your original determination&#x2014;I mean the propriety of persevering whatever aspect matters have at first, of rather struggling with the most ungainly obstacles than again committing yourself to the guidance of fickle chance, and flying as you and I have both been to<supplied>[o]</supplied> much of late, a prey to every turn in the eddies of this world&#x2019;s fitful current, as powerless over your own destiny as a wreck without sails, oars or rudder. You are too learned in vicissitudes not to know that much of what is disagreeable in such a case as the present, is disagreeable merely because it is new; that habit the great smoothener of existence will not only soften down your pains but enable you find pleasure in many things that you at first regarded with indifference or even with repulsion. This is poor preaching; but it proceeds from a true concern in your welfare; as well as from a clear persuasion of what will most contribute to it. If Broughty-ferry is not worse than I anticipate and if you consent to do your best in it, I have no fear whatever of your complete success. Your happiness appears to me to be founded on the most rational and modest views of things; you have in you the power of earning a full gratification of more than you have yet seriously wished; do yourself but justice, and I warrant the result.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Johnston&#x2019;s reply of <date when="1822-11-31">31 Nov.</date> indicated that his new situation was much worse than Carlyle had expected it to be. Johnston gave a detailed account of his dealings with the Erskines of Linlathen (four miles from Dundee) and a Captain Paterson who had married Thomas Erskine&#x2019;s sister. They dominated the school and wished him to teach in an atmosphere heavy with the odor of the &#x201C;Tabernacle&#x201D; and religiosity. They questioned him closely on his own religious opinions and made it clear that they expected him to teach their kind of religion in the school. Johnston found old Mrs. Erskine, mother of Mrs. Paterson, particularly formidable. Cf. <ref target="volume-02/lt-18220408-TC-JJ-01">TC to JJ, <date when="1822-04-08">8 April</date></ref>.</note></p>
<p>This sheet is fading rapidly, and you no whit the wiser. Before it quite evanish, I shall have room however to tell you all our news; which in fact consist in nothing more than that we have none to tell. Living remote from the bustle of this busy Earth, walking daily along the skirt of our City and rejoicing that I have not to enter it farther, the noise of its operations reaches me but <supplied>[faintly]</supplied> or hardly reaches me at all; and what little I do hear is not <supplied>[of the]</supplied> kind to make me anxious for investigating them more minutely. The world is going on just as it has been since the subsiding of the deluge, just as it will do till the general conflagration; men cheating and being cheated, hoping and being disappointed, struggling in their thousand modes to conquer the unconquerable difficulties of their fate, and finding their <pb id="pg-02-212" n="02:212"/>slender but only sure reward in the very attempt to conquer them. In fact it is a very prosaic world; the forms of actions vary, but their substance is in all ages the same; and for a man of ordinary penetration after five and twenty there is nothing new under the sun. Happy the dunce who forms no general propositions, who institutes no comparisons, to whom in consequence all things to the end of time will wear the charms of novelty, and supply a fund of interesting contemplation! Happy too the man who seeks successfully to gild the inanity of this world&#x2019;s movements by interest for the friends whose comfort is involved in them! The eye is sated with seeing, the head with thinking; but not the heart with feeling those honest sentiments of mutual kindness which form at last the only balm of life. <foreign>Adieu</foreign> my dear Johnstone! <closer><salute>I am very <hi rend="italic">billus</hi> [underscored twice], but ever your&#x2019;s sincerely</salute></closer></p>
<name>Th: Carlyle&#x2014;</name>
<ps><p>Are you to be free at Christmas? If so let us see you. Write soon and tell us all&#x2014;all&#x2014; How many scholars you have got? how many friends, what sort of lodging&#x2014;what kind of scene it is&#x2014;what kind of life you lead&#x2014;what &#x26;c &#x26;c &#x26;c.

<salute>My dear Friend,</salute>
<p>I hope this Tragedy of Byron&#x2019;s<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Werner</hi> (<date when="1822-00-00">1822</date>).</note> will amuse you for an hour or two: I meant to send it on Saturday, but was too late by some minutes in finishing it myself. You must not entirely &#x201C;give up&#x201D; his Lordship yet; he is a person of many high and splendid qualities, tho&#x2019; as yet they have done little for him: I still hope he will improve. If I had his genius and health and liberty, I would make the next three centuries recollect me. Tell me what you think of this <hi rend="italic">Werner</hi> [underscored twice].</p>
<p>I have spent a stupid day in reading the Abb&#xE9; de Sade&#x2019;s Memoirs of Petrarch.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jacques Fran&#x26;ccedil;ois Paul Alphonse, Abb&#xE9; de Sade (<date when="1705-00-00">1705</date>&#x2013;<date when="1778-00-00">78</date>), <hi rend="italic">M&#xE9;moires pour la vie de Fran&#x26;ccedil;ois P&#xE9;trarque</hi>, 3 vols. (Amsterdam, <date when="1764-00-00">1764</date>&#x2013;<date when="1767-00-00">67</date>).</note> What a feeble whipster was this Petrarch with all his talents! To go dangling about, for the space of twenty years, puffing and sighing after a little coquette, whose charms lay chiefly in the fervour <pb id="pg-02-213" n="02:213"/>of his own imagination, and the art she had to keep him wavering between hope and despondency&#x2014;at once ridiculous and deplorable&#x2014;that he might write Sonnets in her praise! Did you ever read his <hi rend="italic">Rime</hi>?<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Petrarch&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Rime in Vita e Morte di Madonna Laura</hi>, his famous series of love-poems to Laura.</note> I find it quite impossible to admire them sufficiently: to me they seem a very worthless employment for a mind like Petrarch&#x2019;s&#x2014;he might have built a palace, and he has made some dozen snuff-boxes with invisible hinges,&#x2014;very pretty certainly&#x2014;but very small and altogether useless. But the Italians call them <hi rend="italic">divine</hi>, and that is every thing.</p>
<p>If you reckon this criticism impertinent and out of place, impute it to a complication of headaches &#x26;c &#x26;c enough to make a man turn Manichean or worshipper of Satan altogether,&#x2014;much more grow tired of Sonnets and little Abb&#xE9;s who write books in three volumes quarto.</p>
<p>I must ask for your Rollin however: for I am in great anxieties about it. Do you still persist? What volume are you in? I feel for you, and often ask myself if I am not a barbarian to set a soft <foreign><hi rend="italic">gentile spirto</hi></foreign><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><foreign><hi rend="italic">Spirito</hi></foreign> [kind soul].</note> like yours on such an undertaking. Yet what can I do? You are miserable without the hopes of literary honour before you; and there is no royal road to attain it. Labour, perseverance, moderate but constant industry, these are the means; and the end&#x2014;is it not enough to excite ambition which no toil, no disappointment can extinguish? Proceed, then, my dear and noble heroine! If you feel strength within you to make the sacrifices, to meet the risks, which this career demands from all&#x2014;proceed in it, and never waver! Avoid excess on both sides; it is this which ruins you: be stedfast, neither exhausting your ardour by over-<supplied>[l]</supplied>abour nor wasting it in idleness, and be sure the day <hi rend="italic">will</hi> come when you shall have your reward. I perceive that if you go on steadily with this plan, I shall be forced to esteem you more than I ever did; a superfluous result, you will say.</p>
<p>I have much to say about Writings and Tales and so forth; but not to-night. One thing is certain;&#x2014;like another friend of yours &#x201C;I have no genius,&#x201D; not a whit:<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A reference to Jane&#x2019;s comment on Benjamin Bell, <ref target="volume-02/lt-18221024-JBW-TC-01">JBW to TC, [<date when="1822-10-24">24? Oct.</date>]</ref>.</note> yet I have planted myself at my desk, and almost sworn that there I will sit during my three free hours, every morning, with no book before me, nor other instrument but pen and paper, that whether bright or stupid, sick or sicker, I may write <hi rend="italic">something</hi>, or undergo the pain of total idleness whichever I prefer! This is surely what you call the <supplied>[<hi rend="italic">mood</hi>?]</supplied> <hi rend="italic">sublime</hi>, or something better. Next time I will <supplied>[write?]</supplied> you all concerning it. When will you write <pb id="pg-02-214" n="02:214"/>to me? And when&#x2014;when am I to see you? never?

<salute>My dear Alick,</salute>
<p>Jack and I have just been regaling ourselves with your eloquent and amusing letters; after a weary period of suspense, we again have news from Mainhill, and again all is well! Heaven make us thankful for that mercy, and long continue it to us! We shall never fully know how rich and valuable a blessing it is till the time for improving it is gone by. The Earth has nothing half so good upon its face as the affection which friends bear to each other,&#x2014;those kind feelings those mutual sympathies and encouragements of heart to heart, which give a dignity and sweetness to the humblest lot, and without which the loftiest is but a shining desart. Again I pray that we may be thankful for all this happiness, and ever studious to make the best improvement of it&#x2014;to increase the comfort of those we love&#x2014;to requite their kindness by striving to forward their best interests for this world and the next.</p>
<p>You have no need to make apologies about writing: for this time at least you have done your part faithfully. I rejoice to see your mind expanding itself and gathering thoughts and principles so fast. Considering the opportunities you have your progress cannot but be reckoned rapid: it would be surprising were it not a well known fact that an observant mind can never be situated so unfavourably that it will not improve; can inhabit no scene so barren as to yield no profitable information. One&#x2019;s own soul he always carries with him; and this of itself is a world where all that is best worth knowing is to be learned. When I compare the letters you send us now with those you wrote three years ago, I cannot but applaud your diligence, and rejoice at the great accession of ideas, the great increase of power to express them which I notice in your correspondence. Still more do I rejoice to observe the honourable tone of manly independence, unpretending, quiet, inflexible, that pervades your style of thinking. Persevere in this my dear Brother; it is the true and only way to solid dignity of character: <pb id="pg-02-215" n="02:215"/>&#x201C;the rank is but the guinea-stamp, the man&#x2019;s the <foreign>gowd</foreign>, &#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Burns&#x2019;s &#x201C;Is there for Honest Poverty.&#x201D;</note>&#x2014;and be he rich or poor if sterling he will pass in every market. I need not say how glad I am that you continue reading. It is the best of all possible pastimes; continue in it whenever you have any idle time, it will repay you well&#x2014;if not in perishable silver and gold&#x2014;in something which is far better and more enduring.</p>
<p>My only advice farther in regard to your studies, is that when you read you take pains to reflect well also; and that when you write, you be not too careful of what you shall say, but especially in letters put down the thoughts warm and vivid as they present themselves before your fancy. They often gain in vigour what they want in elegance: besides it is good to be uninteresting even stupid sometimes when we address a friend; it is like the water which those smugglers of yours introduce into their ardent spirit, <foreign><hi rend="italic">wersh</hi></foreign> [insipid] in itself and of no avail, but serving excellently well to temper the fiery alcohol with which it is mingled. This is no reason, you say: none certainly&#x2014;but an illustration of a truth certain enough on other grounds.&#x2014; For grammar you are well nigh perfect: if in spelling you step aside a thought at times, I impute it more to inattention than want to information; a little while will cure you completely. Be steady only! Persevere! There is not any danger.</p>
<p>I am not surprized that you have not yet got afloat in the way of commerce; all things are icebound there on every hand at present. Keep looking out however, and wherever you can see any glimpses of an opening&#x2014;have at it! In the meanwhile, I wish you would take that Receipt down to Annan the first time you go, and draw ten pounds for us endorsing the paper in my name &#x201C;for which this shall be your warrant.&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A stock legal phrase.</note> There is like to be a deficiency of funds here; and Buller or Brewster who are both my debtors may not pay me for an unknown period. Inclose the ten-pound note in the corner of a letter&#x2014;cutting out a fit space of paper for it&#x2014;and send it by the post at your leisure.</p>
<p>We lead a very quiet life at present: no incident breaks the smooth curren<supplied>[ts]</supplied> of our history; none meddles with us, we meddle with none&#x2014; <supplied>[Jack]</supplied> is studying bones and the like, I write (nonsense) all the morning, then go and teach from two till six, then come home and read till past eleven, and so the day is done. I still flatter myself, I am improving in health: I do think I shall one day be as sound as steel, after all that&#x2019;s come and gone; and oh! what a merry soul shall I be <pb id="pg-02-216" n="02:216"/>then! Meanwhile I must study to improve the hour which passes and will never never pass again. I feel happy when I can keep myself busy&#x2014; which alas! is not by any means always. You shall hear of my scribblings by and by.</p>
<p>The other day I went with Murray to call upon Macculloch the <hi rend="italic">Scotsman</hi>. He was sitting like a great polar Bear, chewing and vainly trying to digest the doctrines of Aadam [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] Smith and Ricardo which he means to vomit forth again next spring in the shape of lectures to the &#x201C;thinking public&#x201D; of this city.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >These were probably the preparations for the course of lectures on &#x201C;Political Economy&#x201D; McCulloch gave in Edinburgh from <date when="1823-01-00">January</date> to <date when="1823-04-00">April 1823</date>.</note> He eyed me with suspicion and distrust; would not come forth into open parley at all. What ailed the great Macculloch I could not tell&#x2014;did he ever feel fear? or might I be come to spy the nakedness of the land?<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Gen. 42:9.</note> I did not give a rush to know.</p>
<p>Brewster I see frequently and Dr Fleming and Gordon &#x26;c. B. is in a law quarrel with Oliver &#x26; Boyd about the price of Legendre. How happy that I have neither part nor lot in the matter!</p>
<p>But I must end this flow of talk&#x2014; Will you write to me largely, along with the Note, or by Geordy if he come sooner? Tell me all the news, important and the contrary&#x2014;collect them for my sake and record them: I like to hear about the poor bodies around you, more than if they were Squires living elsewhere.&#x2014; Shaw&#x2019;s shoes are still rather little but I will make them do.

It is but a moderate time-keeper, but I suppose I have kept it too long for returning it. I wish you would sort with him about it the first time you can&#x2014; Now write fully about all your plans and projects and transactions.</p>

<salute>My dear Father,</salute>
<p>I know not whether strictly speaking I owe you a letter in the fair way of one for one as traders count; but certainly in every other way of reckoning I should have written to you long ago. You already understand <pb id="pg-02-217" n="02:217"/>what has prevented me. Last time the Carrier was here, I was whipt round in a whirl of business; and his next journey has been delayed beyond what I could reasonably anticipate when I scribbled off those two sheets under <hi rend="italic">Frank</hi>. Now however that I have got the quill in my hand, and some reasonable portion of time before me, I am determined not to faulter till I have filled the sheet for you.</p>
<p>We have heard so scantily from home that we can only form an imperfect guess at what is going on there. The most important thing however the fact of your continued health and general welfare we have learned; and that is every thing. In other respects I suppose you to be struggling away making what head you can against these meagre times the pressure of which all men are feeling. How it will end I cannot see or form any conjecture. I observe they are making movements in the South; but shewing thereby only that they feel the evil, not that they know how to remedy it. Meanwhile industry and thrift, the only shield and sword by which the tyrant Necessity can be met and vanquished, are not wanting on your part; you have only to await the issue patiently, happy that you are so little involved in it. There will be many a ruined man, before twelve months go round again.</p>
<p>You have not told me whether you liked the sermons.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >His father wrote, <date when="1823-01-01">1 Jan. 1823</date>: &#x201C;I forgot last time I wrot<supplied>[e]</supplied> you to tell you that I had got the Book of Sermons safe which you sent me and I like them very well &#x2026; I was reading Balmers Sermon on the Resur<supplied>[r]</supplied>ection. &#x2026;&#x201D; The book is <hi rend="italic">Sermons on interesting subjects by Ministers belonging to the Associated Synod</hi> (<date when="1819-00-00">1819</date>) and contains a sermon by Robert Balmer on the resurrection of the dead.</note> If there is any other book you stand in want of, or at all care about having, it will be a pleasure for me to get it for you. I think you do very well to read in the winter nights; they are tedious otherwise; &#x26; of all states for a mortal man, the unhappiest is where his mind, requiring constant employment and a continuous flow of ideas, can find nothing to employ it. There are some good books in the Ecclef<hi rend="italic">n</hi> Library, which I think you would like if you tried them</p>
<p>Having written so largely and frequently of late, little remains for me at present to communicate in the shape of news about my situation or proceedings. I find my health slowly but gradually improving; the duties I have to go thro&#x2019; are of an easy sort; the people are on the whole very agreeable: so that I am as happy and contented as I could expect to be. The old Squire Buller is a great favourite with me; a downright, true, unaffected, honest Englishman as I would wish to see. We meet not above once or twice a week; but we are always very <pb id="pg-02-218" n="02:218"/>blithe when we do meet, we talk and speculate about politics and learned men and morals and letters and things in general; we are very comfortable in spite of his deafness which disturbs the pleasure of conversation somewhat particularly at first. The lady is a far more shewy article than her husband; she makes an elegant appearance in drawing-rooms and stately ceremonies: in other respects I feel little love for her. She seems to have had too much of her own way, to have been too highly born and bred for my taste. Yet all this is mere speculation on my part: I have never experienced from her any thing but extreme civility and attention; nor do I fear the contrary; seeing the method to avoid deserving it, and feeling the power to repel it if offered undeservedly.</p>
<p>A while ago, one Galloway whom I knew here, invited me to become a candidate for a vacant Professorship in the Royal Military College at Sandhurst away beyond London, where he now is. It is to teach Mathematics; the salary is about &#xa3;200 a year with house and garden; the labour is not great; the whole establishment is under Government. I wrote to inquire farther about it; but have not yet received any answer. I do not think, I shall mind it much; tho&#x2019; it is good to have such a thing before one.</p>
<p>To-night I had a letter from James Johnstone at Broughty Ferry. The poor fellow seems to be in very bad case there: he has fallen among fools and shoemakers and methodists; they have pla<supplied>[gued?]</supplied> his whole patience out with sounding his religious views, calling upon him to pray and preach and expound the scripture&#x2014;tasks which he absolutely declines having any thing to do with. It is well, for one thing, that he has got plenty of scholars to attend him: I trust he will at length be able to go on without the canting rabble that beset him at present. I design to write to him forthwith, advising him to hold fast his integrity&#x2014;to appeal by his zeal and diligence as a teacher to the judgement of the public, and if the methodists will not let him alone to send them to the right about in a quiet way. He is a worthy honest soul as lives: I am grieved and angry to see him treated so.</p>
<p>But I must conclude this scrawl, with a petition for a letter from you the first time you can prevail upon yourself to write. If you knew how much pleasure we take in your letters you would send us more of them. Jack would have written to you by this opportunity, but he has no moment of time left now. He will mend the matter next chance. <closer><salute>I remain,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>It is already past twelve o&#x2019;clock, and I am tired and sleepy; but I cannot go to rest without answering the kind little note<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >MAC to TC, <date when="1822-11-30">30 Nov.</date></note> which you sent me, and acknowledging these new instances of your unwearied attention to my interests and comfort. I rejoice to be assured that you still retain a moderate share of health: watch over it, my dear Mother, as the first of earthly blessings. It will give you a genuine satisfaction to know in return, that I am daily improving in that point myself. In another twelvemonth, I expect to be completely whole. Disorders which have been accumulating long must be long in curing: but to be assured that one is recovering is almost as good as to be recovered.</p>
<p>I am almost vexed at these shirts<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >She wrote: &#x201C;You will find in the box three shirts: I have three more to make.&#x201D;</note> and stockings: I had already as many as I could set my face to. My dear Mother, why will you expend in these superfluities the pittance I intended for very different ends? I again assure you, and would swear it if needful, that you cannot get me such enjoyment with it in any way as by convincing me that it is adding to your own. Do not therefore frustrate my purposes: when I want any more shirts &#x26;c I will not be slack in letting you know.</p>
<p>I send you a small <foreign><hi rend="italic">screed</hi></foreign> of verses, which I made sometime ago: I fear you will not care a doit for them, tho&#x2019; the subject is good&#x2014;the deliverance of Switzerland from tyranny by the hardy mountaineers at the battle of Morgarten<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Printed in Froude, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi>, I, 172&#x2013;73.</note> some five hundred years ago.</p>
<p>This is my birth-day: I am now seven and twenty years of age! What an unprofitable lout I am! What have I done in this world to make good my place in it, or reward those that had the trouble of my upbringing? Great part of an ordinary life-time is gone by: and here am I, poor trifler, still sojourning in Meshach still dwelling among the tents of Kedar!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ezek. 38:2; Jer. 49:28.</note> May the great Father of all give me strength to do better in time remaining, to be of service in the good cause in my day and generation, and &#x201C;having finished the work which was given me to do&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do&#x201D; (John 17:4).</note> to lie do<supplied>[wn an]</supplied>d sleep in peace and purity in the hope of a happy rising!

<p><pb id="pg-02-220" n="02:220"/>But I have done. Good night my dear Mother! I wish you sweet sleep and all blessings. <closer><salute>Your affectionate Son,</salute></closer></p>

<p>Many thanks for &#x2018;Werner,&#x2019; of which I might never have heard in this barbarian borough. is it not a masterly performance? he is my own matchless Byron after all!&#x2014;</p>
<p>You wish to be acquainted with the arrangement of my time&#x2014;well then attend&#x2014; I rise at nine&#x2014;(a promising beginning!) till ten i dress, breakfast, and play with Shandy or my reticule&#x2014; from ten till two I read Rollin. i cannot not say with all my heart; but, with all my understanding&#x2014;referring, as often as occasion is, to my ancient maps and classical dictionary&#x2014;i have felt the want of this dictionary, or something of the sort, for a great while; but before you mentioned it i did not know of its existence&#x2014; from two till four (our dinner hour) I walk if the day is fine; if not I spend these two hours on drawing, music, talking, chess, or any other lady-like accomplishment&#x2014; After dinner i have two hours for light reading, or <hi rend="italic">light writing</hi>, and four (dont be angry) for Schiller, Tacitus, and Alfieri&#x2014;</p>
<p>This routine is liable to interruptions, and, while one lives in society, these interruptions cannot be avoided; but I content myself with repairing the evil I cannot prevent&#x2014; i have always a stock of spare time, consisting of four hours, and on this i draw when i am hard pressed with callers, teabibbers, and such like hereditary encumbrances&#x2014; Before my hours were thus disposed, i generally spent one half the day in dressing and visiting, and the other half in deploring my idleness&#x2014; By cutting my hair in a new fashion, <hi rend="italic">and sewing my <pb id="pg-02-221" n="02:221"/>waists to my skirts</hi> (you bid me be minute) i have so expedited the process of dressing, that it costs me on no occasion above ten minutes&#x2014;as to visiting, without declaring my intention of refusing <hi rend="italic">all</hi> invitation, i refuse <hi rend="italic">each</hi> on the plea of cold, the weather, letters to write (God knows <hi rend="italic">you</hi> are my only correspondent) or on any other plea that my wits at the moment suggest&#x2014;thus i avoid both the misery of sitting, for hours, stuck up among imbecelles, and the odium which a professed distaste for their amusements would procure me&#x2014; During this last month I have gone through a large portion of Tacitus, Rosmunda, the second part of Wal<supplied>[l]</supplied>enstein (the first i left in despair) and five volumes of the &#x2018;Ancient history&#x2019;&#x2014; What glorious beings these Greeks are! I think, instead of eternally harping on the blindness of the heathen, M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Rollin had more occasion to deplore the degeneracy of our race; since he and his christian bretheren with all the advantages of their boasted religion, come so far short of the heathens in talent, heroism, and every noble quality that likens men to gods, does he moralize through the whole thirteen volumes? I <hi rend="italic">will</hi> persist, come what may!&#x2014; Did you never think of writing a tragedy on the death of Socrates? While i was reading his life, i was seized with a sudden desire to become a philosopher&#x2014;the noble contempt of the pomp and luxury of wealth particularly struck me, and when i came to that exclamation of his, &#x201C;<foreign>quantis non egeo</foreign>&#x201D; [&#x201C;how much is there that I do not want&#x201D;] i began to think seriously of laying aside all my superfluities as a first grand step towards the accomplishment of my design&#x2014;with my head full of this sage resolution i went to walk, and while i was talking to a Lady i missed a bunch of amethysts, the most valuable jewel in my possession&#x2014;my first thought was &#x2018;<foreign><hi rend="italic">quanto</hi></foreign><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For <foreign><hi rend="italic">quantis</hi></foreign>.</note> <foreign><hi rend="italic">egeo</hi></foreign>&#x2019; [&#x2018;how much I want&#x2019;] my next &#x2018;let me begin to be a philosopher&#x2019;&#x2014; accordingly i finished my story (a long story it was!) without pausing, or changing countenance&#x2014; on my way home i reflected that all the gold and jewels in the world could not be converted to <hi rend="italic">one</hi> grain of wisdom, a<supplied>[n]</supplied>d wisdom being the only real good it followed my amethyst broach was utterly worthless&#x2014;therefore it was unworthy a rational being, and most unworthy a philosopher to regret its loss&#x2014; So far Socrates himself could not have thought or acted more philosophically&#x2014; Now, in what do you think these wise reflections ended? in sending the bellman through every quarter of the town to proclaim my loss, and promise a great reward to whoever should give intelligence thereof&#x2014; However i am not persecuted with good fortune like the the king <pb id="pg-02-222" n="02:222"/>(I forget his name) who found the ring he cast away in a fish&#x2019;s belly<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jane refers to an old folk tale which has many versions.

While the knight was sleeping, Roderick slipped the ring from his finger and threw it in the river. Then he demanded that the Queen produce the ring. When she failed to do so, she was imprisoned and threatened with execution. She then sought the aid of St. Kentigern (518?&#x2013;603).

<salute>My dear Johnstone,</salute>
<p>I received your letter with joy; and read it over alas! with a very different feeling. It inspired me at once with sorrow and indignation. <pb id="pg-02-223" n="02:223"/>The scene of dreary canting and petty tho&#x2019; galling vexation, which you so vividly describe to me, is one which it is painful to contemplate: I need not say how earnestly I long for your deliverance from its evils, or how gladly I would contribute to that most desirable result. My heartfelt sympathy you already have; my advice, so far as my imperfect acquaintance with the circumstances of the case permits me to form an opinion, I shall now endeavour to communicate to you.</p>
<p>In the first place, then, I cordially approve your purpose to &#x201C;do nothing rashly&#x201D;&#x2014;to meditate every step of the business&#x2014;to lay down a plan embracing all the important elements of the question, and then to adhere to it with modest but inflexible firmness.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle suggests that Johnston proceed slowly in dealing with the extreme religiosity of the Erskines of Linlathen which Johnston had complained of in his letter of <date when="1822-11-31">31 Nov.</date></note> This resolution, which is prudent and rational at all times, is more particularly so in the present instance&#x2014;situated as you are&#x2014;in the pressing want of employment; recommended to this office by the kindness of a friend, who at least meant to serve you, and proved his meaning by pledging his credit for you; and in the absence of your principal employer, and the presence of <hi rend="italic">such</hi> delegates as he has left behind him. Be cautious, therefore, above all; consider well how you act, that there be no flinching in your conduct: the only way of reaching your object is to avoid all wavering in your proceedings; the only way to avoid wavering is to consider well and maturely before you act at all.</p>
<p>I cannot at all understand on what footing you are with regard to Mr Erskine, whether he <hi rend="italic">is</hi> to pay you any fixed salary, what influence he can exert upon your success in getting scholars, what degree of patronage in short he means to give you in return for all the sacrifices which his representatives demand of you. If as I suspect he intends to give you nothing but a house and the sanction of his name, you can have little difficulty in discerning the proper line of conduct. Your great patron must in that case be the Public, and the pleasing of that Public your great object. Redouble your diligence and watchfulness as a Teacher; be peaceable, courteous, unwearied;&#x2014;you will also be successful; your natural qualities put forth in this mode will gain you a sure and permanent footing in the esteem of the people, which their self-interest will tend strongly to fortify and secure: you may then view with composure the contradiction of Tabernacle shoemakers<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >One Mr. Methuen whom Johnston describes as a &#x201C;red hot independent.&#x201D;</note> and Captains and dowagers, the general voice will overrule them, and protect you from all danger.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-02-224" n="02:224"/>However it may be&#x2014;even at the hazard of cutting all connexion with the Erskines&#x2014;I think you have done well positively to decline any interference with their <hi rend="italic">propagand&#xe2;</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >An early use of the word in this sense.</note> purposes. Your feelings of honesty and personal dignity alike call upon you to stand aloof from that rabble altogether in your public functions&#x2014;to tell them calmly but distinctly that you have no intention to teach theology at all under any conceivable shape; that your documents which you can produce will shew you to have been engaged only to teach more humble and palpable branches of learning and by these you mean to abide&#x2014;if upon the fruit of your labours they wish to superadd any accompaniment of a religious kind, they must find another person to take charge of it, he shall sustain no hinderance and find no help from you. You ought also to remove from Crispin&#x2019;s<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Johnston had found that he was expected to lodge with the argumentative shoemaker Methuen, to whom Carlyle gives the nickname Crispin. The two Saints Crispin, Christian martyrs of the third century, were both shoemakers by trade.</note> place of residence without delay.</p>
<p>Acting upon these principles at once mildly and stedfastly, I would counsel you likewise to avoid as much as possible all jarring and broils with your Methodist patrons. Do not vex yourself at their proceedings, or engage in hopeless attempts to bring them to a better way of thinking. Shew them plainly that you will not plough with their team, that you understand your own place and duties, and will maintain the one and discharge the other; but at the same time study to avoid afflicting them needlessly, endeavour to extend to them that toleration which they cannot extend to you. I know those unhappy people, and how hard it is for flesh and blood to endure their inquisitions, their sentences, their condemnation. To be judged and branded before such a tribunal excites a mingled feeling of contempt and agony which is next to insupportable; to feel that you are honest and yet be reckoned guilty, to see truth and reason and integrity of mind hunted down by imbecillity, cant and delusion&#x2014;the sentence passed against you without appeal, because ignorance gives the force of more than a mathema<supplied>[tical]</supplied> certainty to the most infatuated of their decision<supplied>[s]</supplied>; and the <supplied>[damage is in]</supplied>flicted without mercy, because conscience goes along wi<supplied>[th pi]</supplied>ty and every low selfish feeling to sanction the inflicting of it;&#x2014;all this is difficult to bear, it tempts one often to rise and vindicate the insulted majesty of Wisdom, by scourging those drivelling quacks out from the porches of her Temple which their presence contaminates and profanes. Yet this is not the <pb id="pg-02-225" n="02:225"/>right way: there is often a fundamental worth in these poor people which it becomes a liberal man to detect and to honour however it may be disguised; and independently of this, one&#x2019;s own quiet, not to be lightly foregone, is a blessing inconsistent with such a manner of proceeding. The gnats that sting us on a summer&#x2019;s evening are not to be beaten down with staves and weapons of war; we must conquer them by Patience. Just so, my dear Friend, is it necessary to proceed with your present most disquieting neighbours. You must walk with them for a time; so try to be on civil terms with them. Let them know that you decline the competency of their judgement in matters of religion, that you will neither pass nor receive sentence on that head: they will learn to respect your stern forbearance, and if they think you lost for the next world, they will at least discover that they cannot molest you with impunity in this. Finally, My dear Johnstone, study to improve the time which is passing over you so unpleasantly, that with all its unpleasantness it may not pass for nought. Having secured yourself in the most quiet and comfortable lodgings you can find, assemble round you all the apparatus of learning, wrestle with Lexicons, grammars and gymnasiums, become a perfect scholar, and if Broughty-Ferry prove intolerable to you, it may be given to the winds without reluctance. No year passes in which some highly eligible School is not offered to the competition of the public, and the principle of <foreign><hi rend="italic">detur dignissimo</hi></foreign> [let it be given to the worthiest] is daily becoming more common. There is Shaw of Kirkpatrick has established himself at Hamilton without any influence but that of talent: what advantages had he which you have not?

Should you happen, like many of the worlds best denizens, to want at any time the humble but needful assistance of ready-money, draw upon my small resources without backwardness. Fear nothing!

<salute>My dear Friend,</salute>
<p>I am doubly vexed at the large mass of soiled paper which you receive along with this; &#x2014;both because of its natural qualities, and because it has detained me a whole week from writing to you. I have need of motives for exertion; and I wished to keep this prospect before me throughout my stupid task. It is at last accomplished, and I am now to reap my reward.</p>
<p>My dear Friend, if you do not grow more cross with me soon, I shall become an entire fool. When I get one of those charming kind letters it puts me into such a humour as you cannot conceive: I read it over till I can almost say it by heart; then sit brooding in a delicious idleness, or go wandering about in solitary places, dreaming over things&#x2014;which never can be more than dreams. May Heaven reward you for the beautiful little jewel you have sent me! How demurely it was lying in its place, when I opened the letter,&#x2014;bright and pure and sparkling as its mistress! I design to keep it as long as I live; to look on it after many years, when we perhaps are far asunder,&#x2014;that I may enjoy the delights of memory when those of hope are passed away. You are indeed very kind to me: would it were in my power to repay you, as I ought!</p>
<p>I thank you for the clear outline you have traced to me of your daily life: it gratifies me by the persuasion of your diligence, and enables me to conceive your employment at any hour I like. Even now I can see you&#x2014;the time of &#x201C;playing with Shandy or your reticule&#x201D; being past&#x2014;bending over your Rollin with lexicons and maps and all your apparatus lying round&#x2014;toiling, striving, subduing the repugnancies within, resisting the allurements to dissipation from without&#x2014; vehemently stedfastly intent on scaling the rocky steep &#x201C;where Fame&#x2019;s proud temple shines afar.&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Beattie (<date when="1735-00-00">1735</date>&#x2013;<date when="1803-00-00">1803</date>), <hi rend="italic">The Minstrel</hi> (<date when="1771-00-00">1771</date>&#x2013;<date when="1774-00-00">74</date>), I, 2.</note> It is well done, my dear and honoured Jane! Go on in this noble undertaking; it is worthy of your efforts: persevere in it, and your success is certain.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-02-227" n="02:227"/>I always knew you to be a deceitful person, full of devices and inexplicable turns: but who could have thought you would shew so much contrivance in the plain process of getting on with your studies? To &#x201C;sew skirts and waists together,&#x201D; to discard and combine, so that you accomplish in ten minutes what to an ordinary <hi rend="italic">belle</hi> is the great business of her day! And then how convenient to have letters to write (bless you for being so good a correspondent to me, <hi rend="italic">in truth</hi>!)&#x2014;to take cold so exactly in the nick of time! I believe I ought to send you out Andrew Thomson&#x2019;s<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Andrew Mitchell Thomson was minister of St. George&#x2019;s at this time and also part proprietor of the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Encyclopaedia</hi>. See also <ref target="volume-01/lt-18210309-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1821-03-09">9 March 1821</date></ref>.</note> Sermon on the gross sinfulness of bidding your servant say <hi rend="italic">not at home</hi>, or give you a lecture on that solemn point myself; but so it is, you have such a way of setting things forth, that do what you will I cannot get angry at you&#x2014;I must just submit. Still, however, I must seriously protest against the over-labour which you describe: it is greatly more than you are fit for; and I heartily pray that some interruption may occur every second evening, to drive you away from books and papers, to make you talk and laugh and enjoy yourself, tho&#x2019; it were but with the &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">imbecilles</hi>&#x201D; who drink tea and play whist in such a place as Haddington. You ought to thank your stars that you are so circumstanced: if left to yourself with that fervent temper and that delicate frame, you would be ruined by excessive exertion in twelve months. This to an absolute certainty. For the rest, I rejoice that you are proceeding so rapidly with M. Rollin, and gathering so many ideas even from that slender source. I love you for admiring Socrates, and determining to be a philosopher like him; tho&#x2019; I do wish that your nascent purposes may sustain no more shocks so rude as the one you mention. Have you found the amethyst? I question if there are a dozen philosophers in this country that could bear such a trial much better than you bore it. After all, it is a fine thing to be a <hi rend="italic">lover of wisdom</hi>: yet there was also a good deal of justness in your version of the <foreign><hi rend="italic">quantis non egeo</hi></foreign>, which I once got from you as we walked along Princes&#x2019; street, and which has often brought a smile across me since. &#x201C;How many things are here which I do not want&#x201D; said I affecting to be a philosopher; &#x201C;how many things are here which I cannot get&#x201D; said Jane speaking the honest language of nature, and slyly unmasking my philosophy. The truth is, every thing has two faces: both these sentiments are correct in their proper season, both erroneous out of it.</p>
<p>It is certainly a pity that M. Rollin should be so very weak a man: <pb id="pg-02-228" n="02:228"/>he moralizes to the end of the chapter, and all his morality is not worth a doit. Yet you will <supplied>[get]</supplied> many useful thoughts from him, many splendid pictures of men and things,&#x2014;of a mode of life which was not only highly interesting in itself, but also which has formed the basis of many principles that still give a deep colour to the speculations and literature of all civilized nations, and which is therefore worthy of your study in a double point of view. You must continue in him to the conclusion; you will get better guides thro&#x2019; other portions of your pilgrimage. In the mean time, as I am anxious to reward the industry you have already shewn, I propose that by way of vacation you shall suspend the perusal of M. Rollin, whenever you are thro&#x2019; the seventh volume, which most likely you now are&#x2014;for the period of three days, till you examine this Novel which I have sent you. Three days will do the whole business, and you will go on with greater spirit afterwards. You see I am not absolutely without mercy in my nature; I would not kill you all at once. In this &#x201C;Anastasius&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >By Thomas Hope (<date when="1770-00-00">1770</date>?&#x2013;<date when="1831-00-00">1831</date>), published in <date when="1819-00-00">1819</date>.</note> I hope you will find something to amuse you, perhaps to instruct; it will at least give you the picture of a robust and vigorous mind, that has seen much, and that wants not some touches of poetry to describe it eloquently, or some powers of intellect to reflect well upon it. I enjoyed Anastasius, the &#x201C;oriental Gil Blas&#x201D; very much. Let no man despair that has read this book! In the year <date when="1810-00-00">1810</date> Mr Thomas Hope brought forth a large publication upon fire-screens and fenders and tapestry and tea-urns and other upholstery matters which seemed to be the very acme of dulness and affectation:<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Household Furniture and Internal Decoration</hi> (1st ed., <date when="1807-00-00">1807</date>).</note> ten years afterwards he names himself the author of a book which few living authors would be ashamed to own. Let us persist, my friend, without weariness or wavering! Perseverance will conquer <hi rend="italic">every</hi> obstacle.&#x2014; It is right in you to employ some portion of your time in light reading: this too you may turn to advantage as well as pleasure. Have you read all Pope&#x2019;s works? Swift&#x2019;s? Dryden&#x2019;s and the other classics of that age? Tell me, and I shall know better what to send you out. There is no way of acquiring a proper mastery of the resources contained in our English language, without studying these and the older writers in it. Many of them also are exceedingly amusing and instructive. What are you doing with Wallenstein? I will send you <hi rend="italic">Faust</hi> whenever you have finished: I fear you will not like it so well as you expect&#x2014;or will think I have misled you: but you shall try. I admire your inflexibility in the reading of <hi rend="italic">Tacitus</hi>; it is a hard effort, <pb id="pg-02-229" n="02:229"/>one which few in your circumstances would be capable of making. Do not toil too much over it.</p>
<p>But I must not trifle away your paper and time in this manner: I promised to send you some intelligence about our <foreign><hi rend="italic">opus magnum</hi></foreign>, an enterprize which, too like the <hi rend="italic">great work</hi> of the Alchemist,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The &#x201C;great work&#x201D; of Subtle in Ben Jonson&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">The Alchemist</hi> (<date when="1616-00-00">1616</date>).</note> appears to be attended with unspeakable preparation and discussion, and with no result at all. I must now tell you what I can say on the subject. You will be very angry at me; but nevertheless I must go thro&#x2019; with my detail. One virtue at least I may lay some claim to, the virtue of candour; since to you, whose good opinion it is about my very highest ambition to acquire, I am brave enough to disclose myself as the most feeble and vacillating mortal in existence. Perhaps you will impute this practice less to the absence of hypocricy than to the presence of a strong wish to talk; perhaps with reason. <foreign><hi rend="italic">On veut mieux dire du mal de soi-meme que de n&#x2019;en point parler</hi></foreign>. So says La Rochefoucault.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;One would rather speak ill of oneself than not to speak of oneself at all.&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Reflections, or Sentences and Moral Maxims</hi>, Maxim 165.</note> Be as merciful to me as you can; and you shall hear.</p>
<p>After writing the last long letter to you, I seriously inclined myself to the concoction of some project in the execution of which we two should go hand in hand. I formed a kind of plan, and actually commenced the filling of it up. We were to write a most eminent novel in concert: it was to proceed by way of letters; I to take the gentleman you the lady. The poor fellow was to be a very excellent character of course; a man in the middle-ranks of life gifted with good talents and a fervid enthusiastic turn of mind, learned in all sciences, practiced in many virtues,&#x2014;but tired out, at the time I took him up, with the impediments of a world by much too prosaic for him, entirely sick of struggling along the sordid bustle of existence, where he could glean so little enjoyment but found so much acute suffering. He had in fact met with no object worthy of all his admiration, the bloom of novelty was worn off, and no more substantial charm of solid usefulness had called on him to mingle in the business of life: he was very wretched and very ill-natured; had determined at last to bid <foreign>adieu</foreign> to the hollow and contemptible progeny of Adam as far as possible&#x2014;to immure himself in rustic solitude, with a family of simple unaffected but polished and religious people who (by some means) were bound in gratitude to cherish him affectionately, and who like him had bid farewell to the world. Here the <hi rend="italic">hypochondriac</hi>, was to wander about for a time over the hill-country, to muse and meditate upon the aspects of Nature and <pb id="pg-02-230" n="02:230"/>his own soul, to meet with persons and incidents which should call upon him to deliver his views upon many points of science literature and morals. At length he must grow tired of science, and nature and simplicity just as he had of towns; sickening by degrees till his heart is full of bitterness and ennui, he speaks forth his sufferings&#x2014;not in the puling Lake-style&#x2014;but with a tongue of fire&#x2014;sharp, sarcastic, apparently unfeeling, yet all the while betokening to the quick-sighted a mind of lofty thoughts and generous affections smarting under the torment of its own overnobleness, and ready to break in pieces by the force of its own energies. Already all seems over with him, he has hinted about suicide and rejected it scornfully&#x2014;but it is evident he cannot long exist in this to him most blasted, waste and lonely world,&#x2014; when <hi rend="italic">you</hi>&#x2014;that is the heroine come skipping in before him, with your <foreign><hi rend="italic">&#xE9;spiegleries</hi></foreign> [tricky ways] and fervency you<supplied>[r]</supplied> &#x201C;becks and wreathed smiles&#x201D;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;L&#x2019;Allegro,&#x201D; l. 28.</note> and all your native loveliness. Why should I talk? The man immediately turns crazy about you. The sole being he has ever truly loved, the sole being he can ever love; the epitome to him of all celestial things, the shining jewel in which he sees reflected all the pleasures of the universe, the sun that has risen to illuminate his world when it seemed to be overshadowed in darkness forever! The earth again grows green beneath his feet, his soul recovers all its fiery energies, he is prepared to affront death and danger, to wrestle with devils and men that he may gain your favour. For a while you laugh at him, and torment him, but at length take pity on the poor fellow, and grow as serious as he is. Then, oh then! what a more than elysian prospect! But alas! Fate &#x26;c obstacles &#x26;c &#x26;c&#x2014;You are both broken-hearted, and die; and the whole closes with a mortcloth, and Mr Trotter and a company of undertakers</p>
<p>I had fairly begun this thing, written two first letters; and got the man set down in a very delightful part of the country. But I could not get along: I found that we should require to see one another and consult together every day; I grew affrighted and chilled at the aspect of the Public; I wrote with no <hi rend="italic">verve</hi>: I threw it all into the fire. Yet I am almost persuaded that we might accomplish such a thing; nay I often vow that we <hi rend="italic">will</hi> accomplish it yet, before all is done: but first we must have better auspices, we must be more near each other, we must learn to write more flowingly. What then was to be tried. I thought of a series of short tales, essays, sketches, miscellanies. You are to record your thoughts and observations and experience in this way, <pb id="pg-02-231" n="02:231"/>I mine. Begin therefore; and let me have a little story with descriptions of manners and scenery and passion and character in the Highlands or Lowlands, or wherever you like best and feel yourself most at home. Do not say you cannot: write as you are used to write in those delightful cunning little lively epistles you send me, and the thing we want is found. I too will write in my own poor vein, neither fast nor well, but stedfastly and stubbornly: in time we shall both improve: and when we have enough accumulated for a volume, then we shall sift the wheat from the chaff, arrange it in concert sitting side by side, and give it to the world fearlessly, secure of <hi rend="italic">two</hi> suffrages at least, and prepared to let the others come or stay as they like best. Now will you do this? Think of it well, then give me your approval, you shall be my task-mistress, and I promise to obey you as a most faithful vassal. Consider it; and tell me next time that you have <hi rend="italic">begun</hi> to work.</p>
<p>The stupid farrago which you receive along with this, is <hi rend="italic">the first of the series</hi>!<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >According to A. Carlyle (<hi rend="italic">LL</hi>, I, 125&#x2013;26 n.), this is &#x201C;Cruthers and Jonson, or the Outskirts of Life, a True Story,&#x201D; published anonymously in <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine</hi>, <date when="1831-01-00">Jan. 1831</date>. Carlyle&#x2019;s description of his heroine is very much like Jane Welsh. The hero&#x2019;s predicament and romantic temperament anticipate <hi rend="italic">Wotton Reinfred</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Sartor Resartus</hi>.</note> Do not absolutely condemn me for that lumbering piebald composition. A man must write a cart-load of trash, before he can produce a handful of excellence. This story might have been mended in the names and many of the incidents but it was not worth the labour: I gave it as I heard it. It is a <hi rend="italic">sooterkin</hi><note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18170331-TC-RM-01">TC to RM, <date when="1817-03-31">31 March 1817</date></ref>.</note> and must remain so. I scarcely expect you will read it thro&#x2019;.</p>
<p>Now, my dear Friend, my time is done and I must leave you. I could sit and talk with you here forever; but the world has other humbler tasks in it. I had many things more to tell you, had not my irregular confused mode of writing exhausted all my room. There is not a word more of Sandhurst: I understand the man is to be here at Christmas, and tell me all <foreign>verbatim</foreign>. You would not have me go?&#x2014; Jack is delighted with your compliments&#x2014;delighted that you should know such a being as he exists in the world. He bids me return his kind and humble services, and hope to know more of you before the end. He is a good soul, and affords me some enjoyment here&#x2014;a well formed mind too, but <foreign><hi rend="italic">rudis indigesta</hi></foreign><note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Rudis indigestaque moles</hi>&#x201D;: &#x201C;a rough and unshaped mass&#x201D; (Ovid, <hi rend="italic">Metamorphoses</hi>, I, 7).</note>&#x2014;much <supplied>[more pla]</supplied>cid and contented and well-conditioned than the unfortunate person you have ma<supplied>[de a]</supplied> friend of.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-02-232" n="02:232"/>Now <hi rend="italic">do</hi> not be long in writing to me. If you knew how much your letters charm me, you would not grudge your labour. Write to me without reserve&#x2014;about <hi rend="italic">all</hi> that you care for&#x2014;not minding what you say or how you say it. Related as we are, dulness itself is often best of all, for it shews that we are friends and put confidence in one another. What an impudent knave I am to ask this of you, to affect to be on such terms with you! It is your own kind way of treating me that causes it. I have often upbraided fortune: but here I ought to call her the best of patronnesses. How many men, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to unbind,<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. John 1:27.</note> have travelled thro&#x2019; the world and found no noble soul to care for them! while I&#x2014;God bless you my dear Jane!&#x2014;if I could deserve to be so treated by you I should be happy. Now you <hi rend="italic">must</hi> not grow angry at me. Write, write!&#x2014; I am &#x201C;hungering and thirsting&#x201D; to hear of you and all connected with you.&#x2014; <closer><salute>I am ever your&#x2019;s</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Alick.</salute>
<p>We got your parcel a few hours ago; and all within it was safe&#x2014;money and all: I am obliged by your punctuality in that matter. Your letter also, tho&#x2019; it was brief, conveyed to us the most important intelligence, in assuring us that you were all in the &#x201C;usual way&#x201D; of health and spirits. I am now to scribble you a few hurried lines by way of reply.</p>
<p>And first I am happy to communicate the information that both Jack and I are likewise in the &#x201C;usual way&#x201D;&#x2014;Jack quite sound in health, I gradually improving in that particular, and both busied about our usual avocations. Jack should have written to you to-night, but he grumbles out some excuse about &#x201C;Natural-philosophy&#x201D; and &#x201C;business,&#x201D; and seems disinclined to take up the pen on this occasion. Nay not only is he idle himself in epistolary duties, but the cause of idleness in others: I had written you a small note on the beginning of a sheet this forenoon, and left it in such a hurry, being called away to the Bullers, that I had not time to fold it, and left the care of doing this to Jack, who at that time had not returned from his class. Now mark <pb id="pg-02-233" n="02:233"/>the issue! Jack takes your note, and writes some thoughts of his own upon the end of it; then, little satisfied with his performance&#x2014;chucks the whole into the fire! This was very ill-managed; but Jack deserves pardon, seeing he meant well. Nay I observe at this instant he has taken up the pen, in the view, as I conceive of writing to our Father; so that we must absolve him of all malice prepense, and reckon his silence a misfortune not a crime. He is a good honest diligent creature. He rises every morning, short while after the lark, and awakens me duly, tho&#x2019; sometimes not without difficulty, before he goes out. The other morning I was aroused rather strangely by him: I had been dreaming about many confused-things, as my wont is, when suddenly there was interwoven with my vision a sound as of some noisy cascade, which in my slumbering wisdom I converted into the rushing of a <foreign>miln</foreign> [mill] <hi rend="italic">race-trough</hi>. It went on irregularly, but louder and louder, till it awoke me&#x2014;when the <hi rend="italic">race-trough</hi> proved to be Jack&#x2019;s throat set in motion by a cog<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Bowl.</note> of porridge and milk he was eating in the other room! I burst into laughing, and laughed all day at it whenever it came into my head. Frequently since, I ask Jack when the time for tea draws nigh, if he means to open his <hi rend="italic">race-trough</hi> aye or no?&#x2014;all which he bears with exemplary good humour. In fact he is a very placid welltempered character: I like him well, and have no doubt he will prove an eminent Doctor yet.</p>
<p>We live in a very retired manner here, and so very little of what is called news reaches us at any time. Perhaps about once in the fortnight some student or preacher strays down to see us&#x2014;and then goes his way after chatting an hour: but we seldom repay such visits, privacy being the arrangement we prefer on all accounts. They lead a very melancholy life, these poor preachers and teachers; waiting for a quarter of a century in the city before any provision is made for them, struggling all the while to keep soul and body together, and perhaps destined in the long run to see all their expectations of preferment dashed away. There was one Craig, a little withered man, whom I saw once or twice, a teacher of Greek here, that waited long for some Kirk or other establishment, was frequently disappointed, and lately having been more greivously disappointed than ever&#x2014;took it to heart, and grew low-spirited about it, and is now gone home in a state little if at all short of derangement! I pity the poor body sincerely. Few conditions of life are more oppressive than such a one as this.</p>
<p>Now, my dear Alick, the new-year is coming on, and the &#x201C;storms <pb id="pg-02-234" n="02:234"/>of winter&#x201D;;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dryden&#x2019;s &#x201C;Palamon and Arcite,&#x201D; III, 135.</note> can you or Father or Mother, or any or all of you say any thing definite about the visit you half-promised us? We can get you accommodations here such as they are without inconvenience in any shape, the warmest welcome you count upon at all times, and we will not let you want a <foreign><hi rend="italic">hurl</hi></foreign> [ride] up and down in the coach, whenever you like to fix upon a time. I really think you should take the <hi rend="italic">good-wife</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">good-man</hi> to task on this matter, and try to persuade them. They <hi rend="italic">must</hi> see Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> some time; that is flat: why not now as well as afterwards? Write us about this.</p>
<p>Also you must send me word about your readings and studies and all your news and undertakings. Poor Gullen! to be so nearly eaten up of the Foul Thief, in so ugly a shape!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-02/lt-18221223-TC-DH-01">TC to DH, <date when="1822-12-23">23 Dec.</date></ref></note> Have they found none of the sacrilegious Kirk-robbers? Write me about all and sundry.</p>

<ps><p>Will you send this note to Shaw. The unfortunate creature has <hi rend="italic">a third time</hi> made the shoes too little! I have sold them to Jack, having got two <hi rend="italic">corns</hi> by wearing them half a day. Unluckiest of Sutors!&#x2014;</p></ps>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I have still a few minutes&#x2019; time, and I cannot let the Carrier go without writing you a line or two which however dull or barren may at least gratify you by the conviction that I <hi rend="italic">would</hi> amuse and interest you, if I <hi rend="italic">could</hi>. Having written so largely and lately, I can have little new to tell you about my situation or history; and I have already mentioned to Sandy that, if without good intelligence, we have at least none bad to communicate; being in fact circumstanced in that fortunate style of monotony and quietude, which yields often the more materials for enjoyment the less it yields for narration. I am improving in health slowly, but yet I think steadily; I keep generally busy, and therefore at all times moderately happy.</p>
<p>I wish you had learned to write<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mrs. Carlyle probably <hi rend="italic">could</hi> write, but with great difficulty. A letter of <date when="1823-04-13">13 April 1823</date> begins, &#x201C;I take the pen in my hand however roughly I may handle it.&#x201D; A few lines later another hand (probably the father&#x2019;s) takes over and then at the end is the phrase &#x201C;O cou<supplied>[l]</supplied>d I but write&#x201D; in a clumsy hand. TC must mean that her writing is so hard for her that she writes only briefly and cannot give news. She could of course read and did extensively.</note> as you proposed last harvest: we <pb id="pg-02-235" n="02:235"/>should in that case hear more precisely and fully of your situation, than we usually do; a circumstance which would greatly inhance the pleasure we always feel at the sight of a packet from home. As it is, I must content myself with general conjectures&#x2014;trusting that you go on as happily as could be expected, bustling and fighting away as usual, having many things to suffer and do, but also possessing many resources for suffering them and doing them with courage and equanimity. My dear Mother, I am vexed that you never tell me of any thing I can do for you: always doing for <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, busying yourself for my sake, never shewing me the means to add in any respect to <hi rend="italic">your</hi> happiness. This is not fair: I am sure you know me well enough to be assured that you could not promote my comfort, in the truest sense of the word, more effectually, than putting it within my power to serve you in some shape. Do think, and <hi rend="italic">tell</hi> me what you want. Are you in the habit of taking tea yet? I fear it: and I again charge you to <hi rend="italic">begin forthwith</hi>, and I will be answerable for the result. Now mind these are not words, but real injunctions, which you must not disregard. It would be <hi rend="italic">such</hi> a thing, if you, who have toiled among us so long and faithfully, were restricted from any comfort&#x2014;become a necessary to one in your situation&#x2014;which we could procure for you. My dear Mother, this thought would be gall and wormwood to me long afterwards: no sum of hundreds would make me amends for the presence of it. <hi rend="italic">Do not</hi> heap it upon my head! consider what I am telling you, and do as I bid you&#x2014;for it comes earnestly from the heart. Tell me next time that you have begun the tea-system&#x2014;if you do not wish me to send you <hi rend="italic">half-a-stone</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Seven pounds.</note> of the article down by the first opportunity.</p>
<p>But I am wasting away the paper in this lecture; my time too is all but run, Jack being nearly finished and just on the wing for Candlemaker-row.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A street in Edinburgh running past Greyfriars Church from Bristo St. down to the Grassmarket. Carriers lodged there.</note> I wish you would try to write me yourself&#x2014;however indifferently: you can never learn younger; and I rejoice to see your hand however rude and crabbed.</p>
<p>What ails all the young people that no soul of them thinks of writing? We might suppose they had all got Palsy or some such distemper. <pb id="pg-02-236" n="02:236"/>Have they a fear of touching goose-feathers, or are they careless about their Brothers? No! I feel that they are not but they want some motive to rouse them from their slumber. Tell Mag and Jamie and Mary that I expect to hear from them next time&#x2014;if it were but with the &#x201C;compliments of the season.&#x201D; Are Jane and Jenny at any school? Give my love to all the honest little creatures: I know that all of them like me tho&#x2019; they have not tongues to say it. When is my Father going to write? We half-expected to hear from him by this opportunity.&#x2014; But Jack is grunting! I must bid my dear Mother farewell!</p>

<salute>My dear Alick,</salute>
<p>By some mismanagement on the part of Farries we were prevented from writing to you on Wednesday,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The day a letter could be sent along with the box with Farries at no extra cost. Wednesday was <date when="1822-12-18">18 Dec.</date>, when the two letters immediately preceding were written.</note> and are therefore constrained to put you to the charge of postage, in order to relieve you from the many disagreeable conjectures you might otherwise form concerning us. George delivered your parcel in the afternoon (the money &#x26;c was quite safe); and mentioned when Jack went up to him in the evening that he did not purpose leaving town till <supplied>[the]</supplied> morning. We wrote, in consequence, very manfully; and trailed ourselves about eleven at night thro&#x2019; the vile clammy streets of this city, to his quarters, with our heap of letters; but found alas! that the bird was flown. Father and Mother must therefore wait for news till next time: you only are cut off from that resource, and must read two letters, and pay well for one of them, tho&#x2019; neither is worth paying for.</p>
<p>I have little farther to tell you than what may be gathered from the few lines already written&#x2014;namely that we are both in good heart, driving on exactly in the old style; which tho&#x2019; poor intelligence for a mere hunter of news, is yet well worth telling to the <supplied>[frie]</supplied>ndly hearts that care for us at Mainhill. I rejoice to learn that you too are all in the ordinary way; and I pray earnestly that it may long be so with all of us&#x2014;that if we have nothing strange to narrate to each other we may also have nothing bad.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-02-237" n="02:237"/>You ask me after Edw<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Irving; but I have nothing to say about him, or little, except what you know already. Like another Boanerges<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The surname given by Christ to James and John (see Mark 3:17). Irving this year had received ordination in the church of his youth in Annan. After having gone back briefly to Glasgow to assist Dr. Chalmers in the ceremony of a Scottish communion, he returned to London, and on <date when="1822-07-14">14 July</date> resumed on a permanent basis his duties at Hatton Garden.</note> he is cleaving the hearts of the Londoners in twain, attending Bible societies, Presbyterian dinners, Religious conventions of all kinds; preaching and speculating and acting so as to gain universal notoriety and very general approbation. Long may he enjoy it! there are few men living that deserve it better. He has written to me only once since he went away,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >EI to TC, <date when="1822-09-23">23 Sept.</date></note> and has been a letter in my debt for some time; I am expecting payment very soon.</p>
<p>That is a kind of life, which, tho&#x2019; prized by many, would not by any means suit my perverted tastes. Popularity is sweet in all cases: but if I were aiming for it in the Pulpit, the idea that a thousand drivellers had gained it more lavishly&#x2014;that even John Whitfield<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Whitefield (<date when="1714-00-00">1714</date>&#x2013;<date when="1770-00-00">70</date>), founder of the sect of Calvinistic Methodists. Noted for his eloquence and power, he had preached stirringly to enthusiastic throngs in London in <date when="1737-00-00">1737</date>.</note> used to rouse the Londoners from their warm beds, and make them stand in rows, with lanthorns in their hands, crowding the streets that led to his chapel, early in raw wet November mornings&#x2014;would come withering over my imagination like the mortifying wind of Africa, and as Thomas Bell<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Described by Alick in his letter of <date when="1824-11-21">21 Nov. 1824</date> as a &#x201C;slip-foot lawyer&#x201D; of Dumfries.</note> said in his bold metaphorical way would &#x201C;dash the <hi rend="italic">cup</hi> of fame from my <supplied>[brow]</supplied>.&#x201D; It is happier for me therefore that I live in still shades&#x2014;shunning <supplied>[the]</supplied> clamorous approval of the many-headed monster as well as avoiding its censure, and determined if ever I be marked out never so slightly from the common herd, to be so by another set of judges. After all it is a blessing little worth coveting; the best and richest part of the most famous man&#x2019;s renown is the esteem he is held in by those who see him daily in his goings out and comings in, by his friends and relatives and those that love himself more than his qualities; and this every one of us may gain, without straying into the thorny paths which guide to glory, either in the region of arts or of arms.</p>
<p>But see where my digressive temper is leading me! The sheet is done, and I have yet said nothing! I had much to ask about yourself and Home&#x2014;about your employments, studies, thoughts: but I have <pb id="pg-02-238" n="02:238"/><supplied>[no]</supplied> room <supplied>[to fo]</supplied>rm my longings into thoughts&#x2014;far less to <foreign><hi rend="italic">backspier</hi></foreign> [cross-question] y<supplied>[ou suf]</supplied>ficiently on these to me most interesting topics. I wish you would sit down some night when you feel &#x201C;i&#x2019; the vein,&#x201D; and give me a full disclosure; describe to me all that is going on in the shape of sentiment or action about Mainhill or the environs, never minding in what order or how, so it be but there. And when you have written, do not mind &#x201C;poor Geordy&#x201D;&#x2014;for really the body is little better than a <foreign><hi rend="italic">fash</hi></foreign> [vexation]; but commit your epistle to the Post, by whose agents it will be punctually delivered to a most grateful receiver.&#x2014; Jack is immersed in thought at this moment&#x2014;his great winnow-cloth striving to wrap itself around some mathematical and physical arcana: I dare not speak to him; but know he loves you. How do our good Fath<supplied>[er a]</supplied>nd Mother stand the brunt? I wish they would let us hear of them more at large. Be kind to both, my dear Brother, as you love them and us and yourself. Give my affectionate remembrances to all the true-hearted tho&#x2019; too silent population of Mainhill; and wish them in my name a brave new year better than all that are gone, worse than all that are to follow. They will surely write to me on that stirring occasion.</p>

<salute>My dear Friend,</salute>
<p>I was busied for the last week or two in stringing together some trashy prose, and I determined not to allow myself the pleasure of writing to my friends, or taking any recreation, till I had completed it. <pb id="pg-02-239" n="02:239"/>Thus Charlie Raw, the husbandman of Gedgills, when his hollowbacked <foreign><hi rend="italic">garron</hi></foreign> [small horse] refuses any longer to drag his plough thro&#x2019; the potatoe-field but lies down sullenly among the furrows,&#x2014;brings out a sheaf of musty oats which he orders the boy to hold within half a yard of the garron&#x2019;s nose; by which means the garron feels himself reanimated with fresh strength, starts up again, and ploughs for hours in the hope of munching this mess of proviant, which still flits before him untouched till midday. It is well when such expedients will serve the turn. Charlie has in some instances been obliged to set fire beneath the garron&#x2019;s belly, before he could induce him to proceed&#x2014;urging him forward by terror, when hope had passed away. I do pray that measures so hard may never be required with me or any that I love. As yet, at least, they have never been called into action: for the present, I am done with my purposed task, without the aid of fire, or any fierce stimulant of the kind; allured only by the expectation of the pleasure noticed above&#x2014;which, having earned it, I now proceed to enjoy.</p>
<p>Your long and most welcome letter reached me duly: I liked it well. There is in it such an honest flow of genial good-heartedness, so much shrewd observation and worldly wisdom mingled with an affectionate enthusiasm rarely compatible with worldly wisdom or the experience necessary for acquiring it, so much to amuse, to console, to instruct,&#x2014;it brought the picture of yourself very vividly to my thoughts, and made me long doubly for the payment of that <hi rend="italic">visit</hi> which you promise so cordially, and which I trust you are now meditating speedily to perform. &#x201C;Mother Wilkie&#x201D; you will find the same elastic-minded helpful creature you formerly saw her, free from all moroseness or intemperate passions, tripping about the house like some ancient <hi rend="italic">emeritus</hi> Robin Goodfellow, the worst word she gives you, &#x201C;Oh! yes Sir! ye&#x2019;ll get <hi rend="italic">that</hi>.&#x201D; I admire Mother Wilkie very sincerely.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Graham had written on <date when="1822-11-02">2 Nov</date>: &#x201C;So then, I see you are again in your old quarters at Mother Wilkie&#x2019;s (3 Moray Street). &#x2018;O yes, I see that.&#x2019; Well, I think you will be happier there than in domicile with the Bullers. And your Brother to keep you company. And this is some encouragement for me to pay you an early visit.&#x2014; Yet in one respect I would rather you had been under the roof of the Nabob, for you would have gleaned something from society at all times.&#x201D;</note></p>
<p>It gave me pain, but little surprise, to learn that your projected improvements were still as it were in embryo. You cannot expect, as you rightly remark, that your success should be immediate: Men must have time to consider and see proofs that will subdue their native caution, before untying the strings of that <foreign><hi rend="italic">sanctum sanctorum</hi></foreign> which holds their guineas. In the meantime, what have you to do? <pb id="pg-02-240" n="02:240"/>Nothing at all, my friend, but to watch the favourable opening; and till it occur, to keep yourself in patience, which tho&#x2019; but an ineffectual remedy is the only one our meagre pharmacy affords. You have had a sharp struggle; but you may call yourself a conqueror whatever be the issue: you have not lost one friend thro&#x2019; all the changes of your fortune; nor, what is more, have you &#x2019;bated one jot of that consciousness of right and that love for your fellow-men, which I am confident better days are yet coming to reward. Be strong, then, be steadfast yet a little while: &#x201C;In due time ye shall reap, if ye faint not.&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Gal. 6:9. Graham had written: &#x201C;You will infer from all this that I have but slender hopes this winter of getting afloat with the application of my Patent. It is even so. There are few or none of my friends that are willing to impose upon themselves the task or trouble of looking seriously into a thing that would require,&#x2014;that <hi rend="italic">certainly</hi> would require some little time and study. They are therefore afraid to risk their treasure, preferring the easier and beaten track of their Fathers, so that I am quite <foreign><hi rend="italic">au d&#xE9;sespoir</hi></foreign>; and then my partner in the matter is no less so, not having the wherewithal to live in the interim. I am therefore as perplexed as you have known me at any former period. In short my affairs look no better at home and still worse abroad. Truly I do not know what to think or say about things. You have often prophesied better fortune for me; but &#x2018;really&#x2019; I am sometimes compelled to fear that I shall ere long sink into abject poverty and be forgot, never again to lift up my head amongst the sons of men. Should Fortune (I ought to say Providence) smile upon my worldly estate, you shall be one of the first to congratulate me.&#x2014; Now, I think, I have said &#x2018;my say.&#x2019;&#x201D;</note></p>
<p>You do well in the interim to employ some portion of your leisure in the task of reading. After all, there <hi rend="italic">is</hi> no pleasure like those of the mind. Kings may surround themselves with a manufactured splendour, with scepters, sashes, trains and ribbons; may stand among ushers and knights and lords in waiting, in gorgeous halls, and under their canopies of costly state: but what is all their apparatus? A thing to please the eye, and often vainly meant to hide the squalid nakedness of the &#x201C;Man within.&#x201D; Our mental faculties, if we would cultivate them, can do better and at less expense. The peasant Burns &#x201C;that walked in glory on the mountain side, behind his plough&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Wordsworth, &#x201C;Resolution and Independence,&#x201D; ll. 45&#x2013;46.</note> could wrap himself in grandeur more than royal when he pleased, could raise around him a world as beautiful as Eden and be alive to all its beauty. If it be happiness to have the mind continually solaced by the presence of noble thoughts and lovely images and inspiring scenery, then make me a poor man that can think and study and imagine, and be a king yourself without these gifts.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Weak philosophy!&#x201D; I hear you say, &#x201C;vain declamation! the chief use of reading and imagining, of fine thoughts, and conceptions of heroical enterprises and beautiful things is but the&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">death of time</hi>!&#x2014;a <pb id="pg-02-241" n="02:241"/>book helps us to kill it better.&#x201D; Well, I will not argue with you; only I advise you to go on. There are stores for you in that kind which you never dreamed of: go rifle them, if you love yourself. Did you ever read Watson&#x2019;s Histories of Philip II and III?<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18210424-TC-WG-01">TC to <sic>RM</sic><corr>WG</corr>, <date when="1821-04-24">24 April 1821</date></ref>.</note> If not look at it for my sake.

I really wish you would fix upon these people: if you did heartily, the weeks of comparative inaction would prove to you among the most profitable of your life.</p>
<p>Now you must excuse me for this schoolmaster display, and also for wasting away your paper in this unprofitable manner. I had a vast deal of things to tell you; but my room is taken up. Is there any intelligence from Irving? He owes me a letter for some months: I have little heart to dun him. Was it you or David<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >David Hope.</note> that sent me that critique on his preaching in the Glasgow Courier? I suppose you laid your heads together; and I thank you both. Irving is going on prospering, it would seem. Long, long may he do so!<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Graham had written: &#x201C;I received a very good and very welcome letter from him [Irving] in <date when="1822-08-00">August</date>, and in return I have sent him two len<supplied>[g]</supplied>thy epistles; the last indeed was wrote partly in consequence of a report, given in a London Paper called the <hi rend="italic">Repres entative</hi>, of a grand dinner at the Free Masons Tavern, on account of Mr. Irving&#x2019;s Induction into the London Presbytery. Two hundred guests sat down,&#x2014;Mr. Irving in the chair (strange anomaly). The report occupies more than two pages. Altogether I am very ill pleased with the reporter and Editor; but read for yourself; you will find it under date of the <date when="1822-00-19">19th ult.</date>, I think. Mr. Irving, from every account, is the most popular preacher in London. Very happy it makes me to hear it. He has everything&#x2014;every requisite&#x2014;but prudence in which he is not fully equipped; but that may be acquired. After all, his Farewell discourse has done him no harm, generally. You will find it reviewed in the <hi rend="italic">Eclectic</hi> about a month ago. Certainly it is very favourable, and very friendly. Chalmers and Colin have disposed of 1000 copies of the &#x2018;Farewell&#x2019;; there has lately been large orders from Edinburgh for it.&#x201D;</note> Poor Byers has lost the succession of Annan. I am sorry for this: next to breaking on the wheel, the sufferings of a schoolmaster whom nature has not blest with absolute stupidity, are about the most excrutiating. Poor James Johns<supplied>[t]</supplied>on! He has fallen among thorns at Broughty-ferry; devout old women, psalm singing captains, tabernacle shoemakers&#x2014;a cold heartless <pb id="pg-02-242" n="02:242"/>hypocritical <foreign><hi rend="italic">canaille</hi></foreign>, that wish him to expound the scriptures and lecture on the <hi rend="italic">reflex</hi> act as well as teach reading and accounts&#x2014;that threaten in short to make him very miserable. I pity poor James: he is as true a soul as lives, and very unfortunate to be so well deserving.

<salute>My dear Mitchell,</salute>
<p>It is many a day since I wrote to you or heard from you; yet there are few of my early friends whom I have more cause <supplied>[to]</supplied> feel an interest in, few periods of my life that I look back to with more pleasure <pb id="pg-02-243" n="02:243"/>than the period when our pursuits were more similar, our places of abode more adjacent than they are at present. It is in the hope of recalling old times and thoughts to your memory that I have taken up the pen on this occasion: I am still ambitious for a place in your esteem, still anxious to hear of your welfare.</p>
<p>Since your return to Kirkcudbright, little intelligence respecting you has reached me; but that little fortunately of a pleasant kind. I am happy to learn that your health still keeps improving, that you feel yourself able to discharge the laborious duties of your office without assistance. I need not advise you to keep a strict watch over this matter, you have already suffered too severely to need any such caution. The whole Earth has no blessing within its circuit worthy to be named along with health; the loss of it I reckon the very darkest item in the lot of man. <supplied>[I]</supplied> often think I could snap my fingers in the face of every thing, if it were not this. Pandora&#x2019;s box was but a toy compared with biliousness or any other fundamental bodily disorder. Watch! watch! and think <foreign><hi rend="italic">mens sana in corpore sano</hi></foreign> [a healthy mind in a healthy body]<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Juvenal, <hi rend="italic">Satires</hi>, X, 356.</note> is the whole concern.</p>
<p>It is so long since you have been in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, that all except the general interests connected with the place must have become indifferent to you. I know few people here myself, you I suppose still fewer; and of these even only a very small portion seems to merit much attention. They are getting into Kirks gradually, or lingering on the muddy shore of <hi rend="italic">Private teaching</hi>, to see if any Charon will waft them across the Styx of Patronage into the Elysium of <foreign>tiends</foreign> [tithes] and <foreign>glebe</foreign>. Success attend them all, poor fellows! They are cruising in one small sound, as it were, of the great ocean of life; their trade is harmless, their vessels leaky; it will be hard if they altogether fail.</p>
<p>James Johnston is gone to Broughty-ferry (Dundee) some weeks ago. He seems to aim at being a Scottish Teacher for life: I think if he stick to it, he must ultimately prosper. In the mean time, however, things wear a very surly aspect with him. He has got planted among a very melancholy race of people&#x2014;Psalm-singing Captains, devout old women, Tabernacle shoemakers &#x26;c &#x26;c, who wish him to engage in exposition of the Scripture, and various other plans, for the <hi rend="italic">spread</hi> not of grammar and accounts, but of the doctrines of Theosophy and Thaumaturgy. It is galling and provoking! You must write to console and encourage poor James: he is a true man as breathes; has no natural friends, and feels at present I can easily conceive, very lonely and dejected.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-02-244" n="02:244"/>For myself, I lead a very quiet life here. The Bullers are exceedingly good people; and what is more comfortable, having still a home of my own, I depend less on their good qualities. I am with them only four hours a-day: and I find the task of superintending the studies of my two pupils more pleasing than I had reason to expect. I sit here and read all the morning&#x2014;or write, regularly burning every thing I write. It is a hard matter that one&#x2019;s thoughts should be so poor and <supplied>[scan]</supplied>ty, and at the same time the power of uttering them so difficult to ac<supplied>[quire.]</supplied> I should be happy, if I were in health&#x2014;which in about a twelvemonth or so I keep hoping I shall be. I am greatly better than I was, tho&#x2019; yet ill enough to break the heart of any but a very obstinate person.</p>

Byron has a &#x201C;vision of Judgement&#x201D; there, and a letter to the Editor of &#x201C;My Grandmother&#x2019;s Review,&#x201D; of the wickedest and cleverest turn you could imagine. The vice society, or Constitutional Assoc<hi rend="italic">n</hi> are going to prosecute. This is a wild fighting, loving, praying, blaspheming, weeping, laughing sort of world!&#x2014; The <foreign>literati</foreign> and <foreign>literatuli</foreign> with us are wrangling and scribbling; but effecting nothing, except&#x2014;to &#x201C;make the day and way alike long.&#x201D; At present, however, it is mine to make the sheet and story alike long; a duty which I seem in danger of forgetting. Write to me whenever you can spare an hour. I want to have all your news, your difficulties and successes, your hopes and fears, a picture of your whole <foreign><hi rend="italic">mani&#xE8;re d&#x2019;&#xEA;tre</hi></foreign> [way of life]. Salute Mr Low in my name. <closer><salute>I am always,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My Dear Sir:</salute>
<p>Mr. Warrund Carlile<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Warrand Carlile (<date when="1796-00-00">1796</date>&#x2013;<date when="1881-00-00">1881</date>), who married Edward Irving&#x2019;s youngest sister, Nancy, was a minister in Ireland (<date when="1837-00-00">1837</date>&#x2013;<date when="1842-00-00">42</date>) and thereafter missionary in Jamaica. See <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi>, II, 77, 87; <ref target="volume-01/lt-18200915-TC-WG-01">TC to WG, <date when="1820-09-15">15 Sept. 1820</date></ref>.</note> being here today, and having kindly undertaken to officiate as our Postman, I embrace the opportunity of his conveyance to scribble you a line or two, in the hope of bringing myself before your thoughts in a friendly attitude, and of perhaps inducing you to &#x201C;go and do likewise.&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Luke 10:37.</note> You wrote to me during the period of his sacred Majesty&#x2019;s visit to our city; but the letter did not reach me till after many days, and I could only reply to your agreeable request by empty wishes that you might feel no inconvenience from my inability to comply with it, and vain hopes that you would see the Defender of the Faith without obstruction on that score. I trust you did get lodgings and witness all the pageantry of the time quite comfortably, and at your ease.</p>
<p>Since the end of August I have been here in my old quarters, and following very nearly the old mode of life. Almost the only difference is the presence of my Brother, who has been here for nearly three months, busied in the study of Medicine and Natural Philosophy, sciences which the young man seems quite ambitious of mastering. He goes away early in the morning to mind them, and leaves me to my books and papers, to study or scribble, or doze and pick my nails, till two o&#x2019;clock calls me to another scene of duties with my old friends the Bullers, who used to consume so much of my time when you were here. I am happy so far as Satan and the &#x201C;worst of stomachs&#x201D; will let me.</p>
<p>In Glasgow, at this season, I can easily conceive that such a thing as whining or discomfort is nowhere to be found. Is not this the time of jubilee and jollification&#x2014;of haggis<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-02/lt-18220112-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1822-01-12">12 Jan.</date></ref></note> and geese&#x2014;of dance and song, and port and cold rum punch? The means of being sad when you are healthy and all the world around you is piping to the tune of plum-pudding and roast-beef? I rejoice to find, by Mr. Carlile, that you are now in a condition to relish these good things, having quite recovered your soundness of body, and never lost your elasticity of spirits. It is the very first of blessings, and one which I hope you will long enjoy.</p>
<p>In Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> all things are just about as they were. Two thousand dull <pb id="pg-02-246" n="02:246"/>heads set a-working in the university; twenty times as many hard hands in the various workshops of the place, manufacturing shawls and instruments and furnishings and all the apparatus of luxury; politicians wrangling; the &#x201C;mob of gentlemen&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Pope, <hi rend="italic">Imitations of Horace</hi>, Book II, Epistle I, l. 108: the literary profession, &#x201C;the Mob of Gentlemen who wrote with ease.&#x201D; See <ref target="volume-02/lt-18230718-TC-JBW-01">TC to JBW, <date when="1823-07-18">18 July 1823</date></ref>.</note> talking insipidities and giving dinners, or gone forth to slaughter hares and woodcocks; all minding the solid prose of life, and seeking to invest it with what little decoration they can find in literature, ale, champagne, devotion, whiskey, love, etc., etc., quite in the usual way. For me, I keep as much apart from all their operations as I can; it is not above once a fortnight that I enter their old black harlot of a city, and then my stay in it is as brief as an angel&#x2019;s visit.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Blair&#x2019;s &#x201C;The Grave,&#x201D; l. 588.</note> I never think without shuddering of the life that is led there; the very atmosphere&#x2014;compounded of coalsmoke and more gases and odours than ever chemist or perfumer dreamed of&#x2014;were itself enough to make me loathe the whole concern. My paradise must lie many miles from any paved street&#x2014;some green nook, it should be, in a far valley of the Highlands, by the clear and quiet waters, with smooth lawns around me, mountains in the distance, and the free sky overhead. Put a bright white cottage down in such a place, give me books and food and raiment and conveniences, with liberty to break the heads of all that come within a furlong of me (except some few select persons, to be hereafter specified) and then&#x2014;should I be pleased? I know not&#x2014;but if you hear of any such establishment, I beg you will give me notice.</p>
<p>Seriously, I am a very talkative individual, as you may see, fond to excess of nonsense, and apt to occupy the sheet of my correspondence with <foreign><hi rend="italic">bletherings</hi></foreign> which lead to no useful result. You must come hither to Moray Street, if you want to hear me talk sense. I desire you to prove whether I am not a philosopher, by actual inspection. When you arrive, I hope to be in better health and spirits to entertain you than I was last time. Come and try.</p>
<p>There is no intelligence from Annandale but of a distressing kind.

<salute>My dear friend</salute>
<p>You cannot fall on a more effectual <supplied>[way]</supplied> of making my kindness for you less, than talking so much about it&#x2014; I see you do not understand how to manage us women; no wonder!&#x2014; You ought above all things to beware of seeming grateful for any favour we may please to confer on you; for, you must know we value our favours just in proportion to the gratitude they are paid with. By thanking a Lady, however humbly, for any mark of her esteem you at once alarm her pride&#x2014;her prudence too&#x2014;if she happen to have any; whereas by receiving it with indifference you pique her vanity: and what miracles may not that work in your favour?&#x2014; Would you continue to enjoy the sunshine of my smiles you must also abstain from flattery (<hi rend="italic">at least of the common sort</hi>)&#x2014; I have been stuffed with adulation since ever I left the Boarding-school; (at that time I was as ugly a little bundle of a thing as ever you set your eyes on) and adulation like sweetmeats palls the appetite when presented at all hours of the day&#x2014; I value one compliment to my judgement above twenty to my person (for the latter, my glass declares to me every morning, is totally unmerited, whereas I may be tempted to believe the former has some foundation)&#x2014;now what more delicate compliment can you pay to any one&#x2019;s judgement than to show you esteem it inaccessible to flattery? Here is a lesson for you! see that you profit by it!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Oh this book! this book!&#x2014; I dream on it all day and wake on it all night&#x2014; you and it together will assuredly drive me mad&#x2014;(One of my great grandaunt&#x2019;s (she had been taught latin too) died in a straight-waistcoat)&#x2014; Write tales indeed, to be placed side by side with yours! as foils I suppose!&#x2014; You must either think me monstrous silly or generous beyond example for You cannot but know that were I to rack my heart and soul I should never be able to extort anything worthy of being mentioned in the same century with the story you have sent me.

<salute>My dear Friend,</salute>
<p>I got your parcel about two hours ago. I had been living for the last week in the dread of a <hi rend="italic">lecture</hi>; I now think it happy that I am quit so easily. It is very true I am a kind of <foreign><hi rend="italic">ineptus</hi></foreign> [stupid fellow]; and when I sit down to write letters to people that I care any thing for, I am too apt to get into a certain ebullient humour, and so to indite great quantities of nonsense, which even my own judgement condemns&#x2014;when too late for being mended. The longer I live, the more cl<supplied>[e]</supplied>arly do I see that Corporal Nym&#x2019;s maxim is the great elixir of Philosophy, the quintessence of all moral doctrine. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Pauca verba</hi></foreign> [few words], <foreign><hi rend="italic">pauca verba</hi></foreign><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">The Merry Wives of Windsor</hi>, I, i.</note> is the only remedy we can apply to all the excesses and irregularities of the head and heart. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Pauca verba</hi></foreign>, then!</p>
<p>You are too late by a day in asking for Faust. It is not to be got in the book-shops here, and the College-library is shut for the Christmas holidays. You shall have the volume on the <date when="1823-01-02">2<hi rend="italic">nd</hi></date> or <date when="1823-01-03">3<hi rend="italic">d</hi> of January</date>. In the mean time, I have sent you Tell and the Bride of Messina,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Published <date when="1803-00-00">1803</date>.</note> the former of which Schiller&#x2019;s critics have praised greatly; generally condemning the latter as written upon a false system, tho with immense care and labour. I was disappointed in Tell: it struck me as too disjointed and heterogeneous, tho there are excellent views of Swiss life in it, and Tell himself is a fine patriot-peasant. I want your criticism on it. You did well to cry so heartily over Wallenstein: I like it best of any in the series. Is it not strange that they cannot for their hearts get up a decent play in our own country? All try it, and all fail. Lord John Russel<supplied>[l]</supplied> has sent us down what he calls a &#x201C;tragedy&#x201D; the other day&#x2014;and upon a subject no less dangerous than the fate of Don Carlas.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lord John Russell (<date when="1792-00-00">1792</date>&#x2013;<date when="1878-00-00">1878</date>), <hi rend="italic">Don Carlos, or Persecution. A Tragedy in Five Acts</hi> (London, <date when="1822-00-00">1822</date>).</note> Schiller and Alfieri yet live. The Newspapers say Lord Byron is greatly obliged to his brother lord, the latter having even surpassed &#x201C;Werner&#x201D; in tameness and insipidity; so that Byron is no longer author of the dullest tragedy ever printed by a Lord. This is very foul to Byron; for tho&#x2019; I fear he will never write a good play, it is impossible he can ever write any thing so truly innocent as this &#x201C;Don Carlos.&#x201D; I would have sent it to you; but it seemed superfluous. There is great regularity in the speeches, the lines have all ten syllables exactly&#x2014;and <pb id="pg-02-250" n="02:250"/>precisely the same smooth ding-dong r<supplied>[h]</supplied>ythm from the first page to the last;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >An early instance of Carlyle&#x2019;s protest against artificiality in the music of poetry.

Carlyle&#x2019;s note).</note> Let us be of courage! we shall not be hindmost any way.</p>
<p>I am really sorry to see you in such a coil about your writing. What use is there in so perplexing and overtasking yourself with what should be the ornament and solace of your life, not its chief vexation? I take blame to myself in the business; and pray you to be moderate. One thing ought to afford you some consolation: &#x201C;Genius&#x201D; said Sir Joshua Reynolds, and he never spoke more truly, &#x201C;is nothing but the intense direction of a mind to some intellectual object&#x2014;that consecration of all our powers to it, which leads to disregard all toils and obstacles in the attainment of it, and if strong enough will ultimately bring success.&#x201D;<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Sir Joshua Reynolds&#x2019; &#x201C;Second Discourse.&#x201D;</note> Some such thought as this was Sir Joshua&#x2019;s; and truly it contains nine-tenths of the whole doctrine: it should lead every one that feels this inspiration and unrest within to be proud of feeling it, and also to adopt the only means of turning it to good account&#x2014;the sedulous cultivation of the faculties&#x2014;by patiently amassing knowledge and studying by every method to digest it well. This, my dear pupil, is the great deficiency with you at present; this I would have you to regard as your chief object for a considerable time to come. Be diligent with your historical and other studies; and consider that every new step you make in this direction <hi rend="italic">is</hi> infallibly however circuitously leading you nearer to the goal at which you are aiming. For composition, the art of expressing the thoughts and emotions you are thus daily acquiring, do not by any means neglect it; but at the same time feel no surprize at the disproportion of your wishes to your execution in regard to it. How long did it take you to learn playing on the Piano? <pb id="pg-02-251" n="02:251"/>and what execrable jingling did you make when you first tried it? But what are all the stringed instruments of the Earth in point of complicacy compared to one immortal mind? Is it strange that you should feel a difficulty in managing the rich melodies that &#x201C;slumber in the chords&#x201D; of your Imagination your Understanding and your Heart? Long years of patient industry, many trials, many failures must be gone thro&#x2019;, before you can even begin to satisfy yourself. And do not let this dishearten you&#x2014;for if rightly gone about, the task is pleasant as well as necessary. I have promised that if you will but take hold of my hand, I&#x2014;dim-sighted guide as I am&#x2014;will lead you along pleasant paths up even to the summit. I am still confident in my predictions, still zealous to perform: my only stipulation is that we go on constantly and regularly; you shall neither stop to trifle by the way, nor run till you are out of breath&#x2014;as you are now doing, and must soon cease to do in disgust and exhaustion&#x2014;or else break your heart in vain striving</p>
<p>I partly guess what hinders you from beginning your &#x201C;story&#x201D;: it is the excess of that noble quality in you, which I have preached against so vigorously, and still love for all my preaching&#x2014;the excess of your <hi rend="italic">Ambition</hi>, the too high ideas you have formed of excellence, and your vexation at not realizing them. It is safe to err on this side, so far as feeling is concerned; but wrong to let your action be so much cramped by these considerations. Cannot you do as others do? Sit down and write&#x2014;something short&#x2014;but write and write, tho&#x2019; you could swear it was the most stupid stuff in Nature, till you fairly get to the end. A week after it is finished it will look far better than you expected. The next you write will go on more smoothly and look better still. So likewise with the third and fourth,&#x2014;in regular progression,&#x2014;till you will wonder how such difficulties could ever stop you for a moment. Be not too careful for a subject; take the one you feel most interest in and understand best&#x2014;some description of manners or passions&#x2014;some picture of a kind of life you are familiar with, and which looks lovely in your eyes: and for a commencement, why should it give you pause? Take the precept of Horace&#x2014;<foreign><hi rend="italic">proripe in medias res</hi></foreign>;<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Dash into the middle of things.&#x201D; Cf. <hi rend="italic">Ars Poetica</hi>, l. 148.</note> rush forward and fear nothing. You really magnify the matter too much: never think of the press or public when you are writing: remember that it is only a <hi rend="italic">secondary matter</hi> at present, to be taken up as a light task, and laid down again whenever it interferes with your regular studies. If you cannot think of any proper theme, cannot get in motion for whatever cause; then let the business rest for a week; cease to vex yourself about <pb id="pg-02-252" n="02:252"/>it, in time materials will come unsought. Finally, my dear Friend, possess your mind in patience, follow your laborious but noble task with peaceful diligence; study, read, accumulate ideas, and try to give them utterance in all ways; and look upon it as a cardinal truth that there is <hi rend="italic">no</hi> obstacle before you which calm perseverance will not enable you to surmount.</p>
<p>Now, I am sure, you cannot say I have tried to flatter you on this occasion. My speech has been at once dull and honest: I have preached till we are both grown stupid, you observe; and I leave you undeceived at any rate if uninstructed. The sum of my doctrine is: Begin to write something, if you can, without delay, never minding <hi rend="italic">how</hi> shallow &#x26; poor it may seem; if you cannot, drive it altogether out of your thoughts, till we meet. I entertain no fear whatever of the result: I know well you <hi rend="italic">will</hi> write better than you yet dream of, and look back on these sage prescriptions of mine with an indulgent pity. Shall we not also write together when times are better? Yes we shall&#x2014;in spite of your good-natured sarcasms at my &#x201C;wit and genius&#x201D;&#x2014;and the lubberly productions I send you at present&#x2014;we <hi rend="italic">shall</hi> write in concert&#x2014;if Fortune does not mean to vex me more than she has ever done.&#x2014; This Hope is a fine creature after all! I owe her more than the whole posse of saints and angels put together.</p>

Perhaps you think to steal away again without seeing me: but try it&#x2014;!&#x2014; To be sure, it is only the brief space of a year, since we met, for about five minutes; and we have so many hundred centuries to live on Earth together&#x2014;I confess I am very unreasonable.</p>
<p>But why should I keep prating? The night is run, my pen is worn to the stump; and certain male and female Milliners in this street are regaling themselves with <hi rend="italic">Auld Langsyne</hi> a<supplied>[nd]</supplied> punch and other viler liquours, and calling back my thoughts too f<supplied>[ast]</supplied> from those elysian flights to the vulgar prose of this poor world. May Heaven be the comf<supplied>[ort]</supplied> of these poor Milliners! Their noise and jollity might call forth anathemas from a cynic: my prayer for them is that they may never want a sausage or two and a goose better or worse and a drop of &#x201C;blue ruin&#x201D;<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Gin of a very poor quality.</note> to keep their Christmas with; and whatever quantities of tape and bees&#x2019;-wax and diluted tea their several necessities require.

<p><pb id="pg-02-253" n="02:253"/>I will write again with Faust&#x2014;briefly, I promise&#x2014;and tell you all that I am doing and mean to-do. Good night! my dear Friend.</p>

<salute>My dear Johnston,</salute>
<p>I received your letter last night; and as New-years-day is just at hand, I lose no time in strengthening with all the weight of my counsel the purpose you have formed of adventuring for Cupar on that occasion.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Johnston had written on <date when="1822-12-27">27 Dec.</date>: &#x201C;About three weeks ago I saw an advertisement in the Dundee papers for a teacher in the grammar school of Cupar Fife, guaranteeing a 100 &#xa3; a year. I immediately wrote to the Provost, a Mr Christie, from whom I received an answer, informing me that a comparative trial was not intended; and that if I had thoughts of offering myself as a candidate, he would be happy to receive my certificates any time befo<supplied>[re]</supplied> the new year; and that I would have to undergo a p<supplied>[ri</supplied>]vate examination. I immediately wrote to Mr Duncan to send up my certificates, which are in his possession<supplied>[.]</supplied> If they come in time, I believe I shall be tempted to send them to Cupar. I want your advice upon this point<supplied>[.]</supplied> I have little hope of being successful, but I am determined to leave no means untried to get quit of this place if they do not comport themselves with more civility.&#x201D;</note> I trust that your Certificates are already come to hand, and that you are still determined to forward them without delay. Perhaps it might even be worth your while to walk down as far as that Burgh, and wait upon the Provost in person; to talk with him fluently, explain your views of teaching, inquire what qualifications are likely to be most in request, and let him know that you can farther command a large quantity of testimonials to several other points of your ability. You should get Mitchell to speak, and Poole of Borgue, and Irving, and me and every one that knows you, two voices however feeble being always better than one as feeble. In short you ought to exert yourself strenuously. Cupar is a rich and enterprizing town, as good a station for a School as you could wish.</p>
<p>All this I advise you to do, tho&#x2019; I confess myself not over sanguine as to your success. There are wheels within wheels in these places in many such instances; and even granting that no sinister motive may have influence, the situation itself is so promising that you will likely find considerable opposition. But I give you this advice, because I think it a post highly suitable for you, and because in applying for it <pb id="pg-02-254" n="02:254"/>you have at least a chance of gaining it, while you run no risk whatever let it turn out as it will. If unsuccessful you have still Broughty-ferry with all the advantages it ever had. In fact it is not necessary that you let a single soul in the village know of your intentions; and by this reserve you destroy the only shadow of a drawback which the case presents. If your certificates are not arrived in time therefore, write to Mr Duncan more pressingly, and walk down to Cupar and explain in person what detains them: if they are come, send them off or carry them (which would be better) without delay: and all success attend you! If you were once settled in such a place as Cupar, I should cease to repine for you; it would be fairly in your own power to command whatever is necessary for your comfort or respectability, and none that knows you can doubt of the issue. Doubt not this or as good a station is yet <foreign>wainting</foreign> [waiting] you: be patient only and diligent; and never mind a failure or two. We shall long very much to hear the result of this business.</p>
<p>It gives us some pleasure, in the mean time, to learn that you are partly delivered from the most intolerable of your grievances at the Ferry; have got quiet lodgings, some society, and liberty to worship according to your own ideas. I need not counsel you to cultivate the intimacy of those worthy people whom you have fallen in with: one had better have a dog for friend than no friend at all. &#x201C;Man loves company&#x201D; says Lichtenstein &#x201C;tho&#x2019; it were but that of a burning pennycandle.&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably Ulrich von Lichtenstein, an author of thirteenth-century Germany who wrote the <hi rend="italic">Frauendienst</hi>.</note> The most miserable hours of our existence are spent alone: one may have objects that make retirement desirable or even necessary; but absolute isolation is misery in whatever circumstances it be suffered&#x2014;misery of the worst kind.</p>
<p>Have you written to Irving? I mentioned your case to <supplied>[him]</supplied> briefly, and said you meant perhaps to write: any thing he can <supplied>[do for]</supplied> you, you may count upon. You ask for news from Annandale; but in truth we have none to give. The Mainhill people usually write in the most hurried manner and confine themselves like our Professor of Logic<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Prof. David Ritchie.</note> to &#x201C;the point and the bare point.&#x201D; They were all well about a week ago. The people of Annandale are in great distress; several have taken to robbing Kirks&#x2014; Hoddam, Ecclef<hi rend="italic">n</hi> &#x26;c, and Gullen the Schoolmaster was all but run away with lately by the Devil&#x2014;in the shape of a huge jingling Chimera, or rather stray Mastiff-dog.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-02/lt-18221223-TC-DH-01">TC to DH, <date when="1822-12-23">23 Dec.</date></ref></note> In Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> there is equally <pb id="pg-02-255" n="02:255"/>nothing novel or entertaining. Lord John Russel<supplied>[l]</supplied> has sent us a new tragedy by name Don Carlos, <hi rend="italic">mediocrity</hi> stamped on every page of it. The Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Review is worth your reading some day when you are idle. How do the jollities of the season pass with you? They have almost driven me distraught with noise: I am thinking to freight a decked boat, and spend the <hi rend="italic">Hogmanay</hi>-night<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-03/lt-18251224-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1825-12-24">24 Dec. 1825</date></ref>.</note> in the middle of the Frith; the <foreign>pellochs</foreign> [porpoises] and star-fish would be good company&#x2014;compared with men and women gone mad of whisky-punch, and of joy that they were a year nearer death.</p>
<p>Duncan Church is well, and gone to visit some persons in the West. John also is well and busy, and promises to write to you soon: his best wishes are with you. Now do not higgle and hesitate, but go forth to Cupar bravely, and let us hear the finale without loss of a moment. Accept our sincere wishes for a happy year to you and all you love. <closer><salute>I am always,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Alick,</salute>
<p>Your letter could never have come to me at a more convenient time. It is Saturday-night;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Saturday was actually <date when="1823-01-04">4 Jan.</date> Carlyle misdates the letter.</note> we have till Monday-morning for writing answers; and to-day having been disappointed in getting books, I enjoy abundant leisure. You are therefore to look for a very lengthy epistle.</p>
<p>I rejoice to learn that you are all well;&#x2014;beginning a new year with reasonable hopes of success for the future, and without remorse for those that are gone by. I agree with you in reckoning it grossly absurd to look upon the flight of time as in any case a matter for riotous rejoicing. The newyearsday is always to me one of the saddest of the twelvemonth. One thinks with pain that so many more days have passed away forever, and been marked by so very small a portion of improvement. Dean Swift used not to make merry but <hi rend="italic">lament</hi>, at the return of his birth-day: he always read on such occasions that chapter of Job where it is said &#x201C;cursed be the day on which it was proclaimed <pb id="pg-02-256" n="02:256"/>that a man-child was born.&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Swift&#x2019;s letter to Mrs. Whiteway, <date when="1738-11-27">27 Nov. 1738</date>. Carlyle&#x2019;s source would have been <hi rend="italic">Letters Written by the Late Jonathan Swift &#x2026; and Several of His Friends from the Year <date when="1703-00-00">1703</date> to <date when="1740-00-00">1740</date></hi>, ed. John Hawksworth and Dean Swift, 4 vols. (London, <date when="1766-00-00">1766</date>&#x2013;<date when="1768-00-00">68</date>). Cf. Job 3:3.</note> The good populace have different views; they shut their eyes upon the staleness the misery and worthlessness of what is gone, they repress all feelings of regret for time misspent and opportunities neglected, they think that &#x201C;age will supply the deficiencies of youth, and the emptiness of to-day will be made up by the fulness of tomorrow&#x201D;;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Rasselas</hi>, chap. i.</note>&#x2014;or rather the pitiful drivellers never think at all, but seize with eagerness any pretext for quaffing &#x201C;factory whisky&#x201D; and picking goose-bones, and fiddling and jigging, and snatching a kind of dog&#x2019;s enjoyment for an hour, when it is offered. Much good may it do them!&#x2014; Perhaps the wretches are in the right after all.</p>
<p>As to this, however, I am little careful to decide: one thing of more immediate importance and connected with the subject I unfortunately know too well; it is the woe which these revelries have wrought myself during the fortnight that is past. There are some Mantua-makers over us that have been keeping their new-year, in such a style as satisfies us very little. I have lost a good deal of sleep with them during the whole of last month, Wilkie has complained &#x26;c; but now the matter is come to a head, and this very night they are to be warned by the watchman that unless they go to their beds in future like decent Christians at midnight, the Police will deal with them in the way of censure and poinding of their gear. If this produces no effect, Jack and I are off next week into other lodgings. I hope you have no idea of what it is to hear too well: I do solemnly declare I know of no torment in the late Spanish Inquisition equal to it. As for these unhappy needle-women, I have sometimes thought of late nights how happy it was for myself that I had not unlimited power: if I had, I should have caused a strong north-wind to blow, and carry off the whole sisterhood, into the immeasurable depths of space, with all their shreds and patches, their cambric frills and &#x2019;Chapel needles<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-02/lt-18230330-JBW-EA-01">JBW to <sic>ES</sic><corr>EA</corr>, [<date when="1823-03-30">30 March</date>]</ref>.</note> and paper patterns, tag, rag and bobtail, once and forever. This would have been wrong: for tho&#x2019; these <hi rend="italic">midges</hi> have got power to vex me for a time, they have a kind of feeling in them I suppose as well as I, and ought not to be punished but in moderation. My sole petition therefore is that they may live out the full measure of their days unscathed by wind or weather,&#x2014;and that my own mind might never more be degraded by the despicable recollection that they are or have been in the system <pb id="pg-02-257" n="02:257"/>of the Universe. Peace be with them, till <foreign><hi rend="italic">Satteen</hi></foreign> in his proper time, get power to take them to himself!</p>
<p>Now I suppose my good Alick is getting very melancholy over this; thinks I have been disturbed, harassed, destroyed &#x26;c, and am now almost as bad as ever. No such matter, I assure you. I am not harmed a single jot by them&#x2014;except for the present pains; and to-night, tho&#x2019; I slept none till after six this morning, I feel nothing ail me at all&#x2014;or next to nothing. In fact I am gathering strength and health quite steadily; only I require careful treatment; and that (thank God!) it is fully in my power to command. I should not have mentioned this foolish business at all, had it not been that I wanted to prepare you for the possibility of our having changed our abode next time you write. I do not now think it probable that we shall do so: at all events continue to direct hither till you hear.</p>
<p>Now, the deuce is in it, if I have not taken up the whole of this large sheet in talking about matters worse than nothing! If Alick were not a very indulgent character, he would grind his teeth at me and call me a tedious fool. I must do so no more; but turn to say a word of your reading before I close. You do well in default of Charles V, to take up with Rollin.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Robertson (<date when="1721-00-00">1721</date>&#x2013;<date when="1793-00-00">93</date>), <hi rend="italic">The History of the Reign of the Emperor Charles V</hi>, 3 vols. (<date when="1769-00-00">1769</date>). Alick would be taking up either Charles Rollin (<date when="1661-00-00">1661</date>&#x2013;<date when="1741-00-00">1741</date>), <hi rend="italic">The History of the Arts and Sciences of the Antients</hi>, 3 vols.

I advise you to begin with him immediately. Neither should you negleet grammar; it were well to revise Cobbett again, the good <supplied>[he]</supplied> has already done you makes me recommend him more. If you had brushed away a few improprieties, <supplied>[you]</supplied> will write an excellent letter. I am glad to find that you are in the way of doing this; there is hardly above one misspelt word this time&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">asshure</hi> for assure; and your mode of setting forth things is quite peculiar. You should often write, it improves your hand your style and every thing. I shall be proud of having taught you by and by&#x2014; But here is &#x201C;Mother Wilkie&#x201D; as Graham calls her, with the little wooden tray, and all the tea-tackle! Jack has left me&#x2014;away to chop Logic in some Society he attends: I must turn to my solitary meal: excuse me &#x201C;sweet sir&#x201D; for about ten minutes of time.&#x2014; Well! here I am again; let us go on with our scribble. I have sent you a little book (or rather mean to send you, for it yet lies beside <pb id="pg-02-258" n="02:258"/>me, I see) on mensuration,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In his letter of <date when="1823-03-05">5 March</date>, Alick thanks Carlyle for &#x201C;Mr. Ingram&#x2019;s Arithmetic.&#x201D; The book, then, would probably have been either Alexander Ingram&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">A Concise System of Mensuration</hi> (<date when="1822-00-00">1822</date>) or his revised and enlarged edition of A.

Look thro&#x2019; it at your leisure: the preface will direct you how to study it. &#x201C;What extravagance!&#x201D; you exclaim. None at all, my dear Fellow; Boyd the fat Bookseller gave it me, and I give it you, and so where is the harm? Jo<supplied>[h]</supplied>ns<supplied>[t]</supplied>on&#x2019;s letter is already well enough directed &#x201C;Broughty-ferry, Dundee&#x201D;: I shall put it into the Post-office to-night. I hear from James that he is getting rather quieter; he has some aims on a school at Cupar in Fife, in which I pray that all success may attend him. He is a good man, tho&#x2019; luckless.

<salute>My dear Friend,</salute>
<p>The year commences with me inauspiciously; I am in ill luck at present. I could not get Faust for you yesterday, I have little hope of <pb id="pg-02-259" n="02:259"/>getting it to-day&#x2014;unless the Librarian lied; and now that I enjoy the privilege of writing to you, my time is so short and my head so confused that I must part without saying above three words. The sweet people hereabouts, with their junkettings and jiggings, their fiddling capering carousing<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >At Hogmanay, the traditional Scottish New Year&#x2019;s Eve festivities. See <ref target="volume-03/lt-18251224-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1825-12-24">24 Dec. 1825</date></ref>.</note>&#x2014;all for joy that they are got a step nearer the conclusion of their pitiful existence&#x2014;have put me into the most wonderful quandary. Is it not hard that so excellent a gentleman should be driven from his aims by the movements of that low <foreign><hi rend="italic">canaille</hi></foreign>? Quietness and fresh air&#x2014;quietness deep as of the grave, and breezes free as they blow over the summit of Cairngorm&#x2014;these with food and raiment, are the humble blessings for which I have fatigued the ear of Heaven so long and to so little purpose. Perhaps the answer is coming after all. Who knows but in some green sheltered nook of the Earth a peaceful home may yet arise for me! A fair yet modest mansion it shall be; with books, and things convenient, and those I love, within; with woods and waters and lofty mountains round it, and the blue canopy above; and no vulgar biped to approach within a furlong of it under pain of death. How you turn up your nose at all this!</p>
<p>Well! how fares it with Monsieur Rollin?<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-02/lt-18230104-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1823-01-04">3 [4] Jan.</date></ref></note> I am in great pain for him during the late revelries. Remember that you are under a vow to go on with him to the end, how dull soever he may grow. Against this time twelvemonth, if you continue studying, I promise that your stock of solid information will be increased beyond your hopes. Persist then, my dear Jane, and let nothing daunt you! If I once saw you the woman that Nature intended you to be, I should feel a pleasure which nothing else could give me. What pride that <hi rend="italic">I</hi> had contributed to make you! I pray with more earnestness than ever that you do not baulk me. It would be the worst of all the jade&#x2019;s-tricks Fortune has ever played me.</p>
<p>And have you fairly begun the story? &#x201C;No Sir! not a jot of it; and I beg you will hold your impertinent tongue on that subject.&#x201D; Well, never mind; do not fret yourself about it; things will mend in time. Read, think, gather knowledge and ideas from every source: you will find the task of composition grow easier every day. And is it not a noble art! Our natural horizon is a circle of some few miles, our earthly date a few brief years; and yet by <hi rend="italic">this</hi>, our thoughts go from us to the utmost bounds of space and time; hearts that beat in the remotest borders of the world are fired by the sentiments that our<supplied>[s]</supplied> have conceived, they love us tho&#x2019; unseen, and &#x201C;being dead we yet <pb id="pg-02-260" n="02:260"/>speak.&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf.

<p>Do you know I am longing vehemently for <date when="1823-02-00">February</date>: I want to talk with you for about half a century then. When will you write to me? Let <supplied>[your letters be]</supplied> as long and careless as you possibly can. I <supplied>[have been all]</supplied> but completely idle for the last ten days. God help me! and mend me! I deserve your contempt. Yet I am impudent enough: I had almost begun a&#x2014;what do you think?&#x2014;a tragedy last week! The subject was&#x2014; But it is going I feel, and we need not speak of it. Write me the first moment you have. <closer><salute>I am ever your&#x2019;s</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I see there is a long letter lying for you already, and seasoned by a fortnight&#x2019;s keeping; yet I have begun another sheet which I have spread out before me, and am determined to fill before quitting. I do not think ever people had so voluminous a correspondent: it matters not whether you write or keep silence, you are loaded with epistles every fortnight, enough to break the back of <hi rend="italic">Bobby</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The carrier&#x2019;s pony. See <ref target="volume-02/lt-18220602-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1822-06-02">2 June 1822</date></ref>.</note> himself, if he were not rather lightly freighted in this dull season. How you will get them all read I know not,&#x2014;or care not, for that is your concern, mine is only to write as long as the pen will move.</p>
<p>I hear no particular tidings of my Mother; only I am inclined to include her under the general head of &#x201C;all going on as usual,&#x201D; and to hope that her health and spirits do not altogether fail her, but continue to afford strength to discharge her many duties and make head against her many difficulties. I hope to live beside you yet a long time, tho&#x2019; we see one another too rarely of late. You must know I am to have a pleasant dwelling-place in the course of years; and there you and I shall reserve a place for colleaguing together, and what talking and smoking and gossipping and tea-<hi rend="italic">shines</hi> we shall have! All this is coming yet. In the mean time, I am going on quite well in all respects&#x2014;except for some noises which have disturbed me at nights a little, concerning <pb id="pg-02-261" n="02:261"/>which Alick will instruct you, and from which we are now sure one way or another soon to be completely delivered. It is a pitiful thing to be so touchy; but one good effect of it is that it may teach one the utility of Patience. There is no other remedy in fact but this universal one; if you would tear the very liver out of yourself, you cannot mend the matter, you must <hi rend="italic">just submit</hi>. However I am getting stronger and stronger every month: I now reckon myself in quite a tolerable state; and you may be sure I shall neglect no precaution for improving and confirming these favourable symptoms. Heaven be praised that I am so well! If you would offer me health in the one hand and the sceptre of Europe in the other&#x2014;I should hesitate few moments which to chuse.</p>
<p>Poor Jenny Crone<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably an Annandale neighbor of the family.</note> is gone at last! She was a good woman, seemed to keep &#x201C;the noiseless tenor of her way&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Gray&#x2019;s &#x201C;Elegy,&#x201D; st. 19.</note> thro&#x2019; the wilderness of life in peace and blamelessness; that now is more for her than if she had been Empress of all the Earth. Well was it said &#x201C;let me die the death of the Righteous and let my last end be like his!&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Num. 23:10.</note> It is a wish which all of us should be busied in seeking the means to get accomplished. Strange that the shallow pageant of this transitory being should have power so far to draw us from &#x201C;the vast concerns of an Eternal scene&#x201D;!</p>
<p>I know not what books you have to read, or which of them you are most in favour with at present. Cannot you tell me some which I can get you? Or if not, cannot you point out some other thing which I can do for you? &#x201C;Dear! <foreign>Bairn</foreign>, I want for nothing&#x201D; I hear you reply. Now I know you do want for many things, and I am often really vexed that you do not mention them. Will you never understand that you cannot gratify me so much, by any plan you can take, as by enabling me to promote your comfort in any way within my power? Speak, th<supplied>[en]</supplied>! Speak, I tell you!</p>
<p><supplied>[Do]</supplied> you ever hear any news of Waugh?<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Waugh, his cousin, who had studied medicine in Edinburgh but who had now begun a downhill course of life.</note> He seems vanished out of our circuit, and all the intelligence we have got of him since summer is that there is none to be had respecting him. We got some story about his assaulting Martin the Lawyer, throwing a bottle of lampblack on him, and then drawing a large Apothecaries spatula or plaster-knife to defend himself. It was foolishly done of poor Waugh; but he had enough to drive him into greater follies of late years: I am <pb id="pg-02-262" n="02:262"/>really sorry for the luckless slut, but see not well what is to become of him.</p>
<p>Jack is busy writing to my Father, or he would have sent you a line. He is doing well here; enjoys good health, and follows out his studies without flinching. His old propensity to logic or the &#x201C;use of reason&#x201D; he still retains in considerable preservation. Often in our arguments I am tempted to employ my Father&#x2019;s finisher <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;thou Natural</hi> <supplied>[<hi rend="italic">idiot</hi>]</supplied>, <hi rend="italic">thou&#x201D;</hi>&#x2014;but poor Jack looks out with his broad face so honestly and good naturedly that I have not the heart. He is a very good soul, and comforts me greatly when I am out of sorts.</p>
<p>Now surely, my good Mother, you must confess yourself to be a letter in my debt: you ought to pay it with the earliest time you have. I do wish you would learn to write, and send me letters by the quire. It only wants a beginning. My best love to all the <hi rend="italic">childer</hi>. <closer><salute>I am ever</salute></closer></p>

<p>I have not been in such illhumour for a great while&#x2014; I could cry all day long if crying would mend the matter; but i fear it would only spoil my beautiful eyes.

<p>I finished Rollin before these people came.

Kind, generous soul! I could have loved her myself if I had seen her. Think of a slender delicate creature&#x2014;formed in the very mould of beauty&#x2014;elegant and airy in her movements as a fawn; black hair and eyes&#x2014;jet black; her face meanwhile as pure and fair as lilies&#x2014;and then for its expression&#x2014;how shall I describe it? Nothing so changeful, nothing so lovely in all its changes: one moment it was sprightly gaiety, quick arch humour, sharp wrath, the most contemptuous indifference&#x2014;then all at once there would spread over it a celestial gleam of warm affection, deep enthusiasm;&#x2014;every feature beamed with tenderness and love, her eyes and looks would have melted a heart of stone; but ere you had time to fall down and worship them&#x2014;poh! she was off into some other hemisphere&#x2014;laughing at you&#x2014;teasing you&#x2014;again seeming to flit round the whole universe of human feeling, and to sport with every part of it.

<p>My Mother had a letter from M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Irving some time since the most grotesque performance (I dare swear) that was ever penned beyond the precincts of a lunatic asylum&#x2014; It begins with &#x2018;It is past midnight&#x2019;! after stating that he is suddenly and irresistibly impelled to write &#x201C;by one of those strong movements coming from whence he knows not but to him like the the [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] motions of a higher spirit&#x201D; he proceeds to an elaborate description of his <hi rend="italic">two</hi> candles, one of which he has extinguished that he may have light to finish his letter&#x2014;while he is wasting light in narrating this <hi rend="italic">new</hi> and ingenious contrivance for saving it he reminds me of a certain sagacious schoolfellow of mine, who having lost one of his two saturday half pennies, in a dark corner, bought a candle with the other to look for the one he had lost&#x2014; From the candles he flies of<supplied>[f]</supplied> to a pack of fiddlers under his window, &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">breathing</hi> the most melting and most melancholy music&#x2014;&#x201D; The said fiddlers parade Gloucester Street till (If I may judge by the fatigue I endured in following them) they must have been ready to fall down.

The original air may be that of &#x201C;King James&#x2019; March to Ireland&#x201D; or of &#x201C;Lord Randall.&#x201D; A pre-eighteenth-century air called &#x201C;Auld Lang Syne&#x201D; was superseded by the tune that is well-known today. Jane probably refers to the later tune. &#x201C;Caller Herrin&#x201D; was the name of a song written about <date when="1790-00-00">1790</date> by the Scottish ballad writer Lady Nairne for the benefit of Nathaniel Gow, son of a famous Perthshire fiddler, Neil Gow.

A similar expression is: &#x201C;I was black affronted.&#x201D; Jane&#x2019;s mockery suggests some ill-feeling. Irving&#x2019;s letter, written to Mrs. Grace Welsh, <date when="1822-12-06">6 Dec. 1822</date>, though pretentious hardly deserves such scorn. Irving writes of his success in London, says that he is giving evening lectures on St. Luke and that these are to be published, requests that the Welshes return four sermons of his which he wishes to use. He mentions &#x201C;the vision of judgement&#x201D; not in reference to Byron or Southey but to a poem sent to him by an engraver of no education as a reply to the &#x201C;irreligious and unworthy treatment given to that solemn subject&#x201D; which Irving compares to Spenser&#x2019;s poetry and from which he solemnly quotes two monotonous stanzas. His letter ends: &#x201C;My candle goes down&#x2014;to-morrow I will finish&#x201D; and then continues, &#x201C;Three days have passed. &#x2026;&#x201D; Jane does not always quote the letter correctly but exaggerates his already florid style.</note></p>

<salute>My dear Friend,</salute>
<p>I must congratulate you on your safe passage thro&#x2019; the Ancient History: you have really done very cleverly in this matter. If you continue the same sort of exertion for a little longer, I shall cease to <pb id="pg-02-266" n="02:266"/>have any doubts respecting your ultimate success. Are not the pleasures of successful diligence superior to all others? You will find this more emphatically true, the longer you make the experiment. In the mean time, do not let the alleged imperfection of your memory discourage you too much: it is a universal complaint, and the farther you advance you will feel it the less. No one of our faculties is so susceptible of improvement as this, or so completely dependent on ourselves in all its stages of improvement. Besides the more facts you accumulate, the more relations will you find among them, and hence the more hints to suggest the leading ones, which thus become more easily remembered at every new step of your progress. You should try to fix in your mind the few great events which influenced all the rest; to obtain an indelible impression of their dates and circumstances, and thoroughly to understand them in all their bearings. They stand like beacons in the great sea of history, each commanding a large space all around it: the lesser occurrences naturally group themselves about them, and are held in memory by the simplest of all connections, that of cause and effect. On the whole, I rather think that your memory is a very good one, that you at present retain a greater portion of Rollin&#x2019;s narrative than one out of a hundred ordinary readers would have done, at a first perusal, in a subject so new to them. Be content, therefore; you will get your recollections refreshed as you proceed. Did you go on taking notes, as you began? I imagine this to be a good practice if used in moderation. You should also keep looking at your maps and your Lempriere;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18210125-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1821-01-25">25 Jan. 1821</date></ref>.</note> remember the <hi rend="italic">two windows,</hi> chronology and geography: just in proportion to the vividness and distinctness of your original conception of any thing, will be the length of time you recollect it.</p>
<p>I meant to send you Fergusson&#x2019;s Roman Republic; but it is not to be had at present. If you cannot get it quite conveniently, take this Vertot instead: he deserves a perusal on his own account, and Fergusson can be procured afterwards. There are also Roman histories by Hook and Rollin; but they are both rather tedious and sometimes silly. Goldsmith is not worth reading. Unless you are tired of the Greeks, I would also recommend Gillies to you, or Mitford, dull and stiff but not without strength or good information; and the travels of Anacharsis by the Abb&#xE9; Barth&#xE9;lemi, which is a very lively work. When you are sufficiently grounded in the classical ages, I promise you a rich and various feast in Gibbon&#x2014;by far the most splendid and <pb id="pg-02-267" n="02:267"/>trenchant person you have yet become acquainted with.

You see I cut you out abundance of work: for in truth I begin to count largely on your diligence; and I know you will thank me for pointing out the plenteous harvest of profit and delight, which is here opened before you. To reap it, nothing is required but steadfast tho&#x2019; moderate exertion, and a self-denial to the poor dissipations of female life&#x2014;in which, with views and thoughts such as yours, you would find nothing to satisfy you at any rate. Your destination is different, and you must obey it. Never fear the labour; you are equal to ten times as much if you husband your strength: go on! go on! the victory is certain.</p>
<p>I know not whether you are yet delivered from your fardels: at all events you will soon be so. Before tuesday, your Uncle must sit down again to his Lawbooks, and the &#x201C;cold, prosaic beautiful artificial&#x201D; lady be engaged in her domestic operations far enough from you. The &#x201C;agony of patience&#x201D; will give place to the glow of active effort, and you will advance with more alacrity for this interruption. I do love you for wishing to become a Hermitess in some Highland glen. Yet you must not go without attendance and much preparation: and would you not let me be of the party? Oh what a paradise of a place we should make it!&#x2014;full of peace and kindness and all sweet and noble thoughts&#x2014;happy as the first Eden, tho in the grimmest region that the eye of Heaven visits! Seriously, these trammels and vulgar toils and eating cares<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Milton, &#x201C;L&#x2019;Allegro,&#x201D; 1. 135.</note> do often grieve one: but it is the common lot; and he is happy who can steal some moments from this Egyptian bondage, and consecrate them to worthy and memorable deeds. This both of us may <pb id="pg-02-268" n="02:268"/>hope for, both of us do hope for it, and I swear that neither shall be disappointed.</p>
<p>You say I must go on with these Tales. With all my heart, so you go with me. Begin therefore, and proceed at once with spirit and moderation; <foreign><hi rend="italic">festina lente</hi></foreign>,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-03/lt-18240125-TC-JBW-01">TC to JBW, <date when="1824-01-25">25 Jan. 1824</date></ref>.</note> and we shall do rarely. In a given number of months we shall have a volume of them; in time we shall come out together, and what a day when <hi rend="italic">our</hi> Book is given to the world! Recollect now, it depends upon yourself. In a week I shall have done with these foolish Encyclopedical farragos, and then I am for you. What are you to write about? Never mind how bad the first is: we shall amend them all in concert, make them very decent and quite fit to see company. You have only to obey the impulses of your own genius, to write fearlessly, as you do in your letters, and all will prosper.</p>
<p>What a wicked creature you are to make me laugh so at poor Irving! Do I not know him for one of the best men breathing, and that he loves us both as if he were our brother? Yet it must be owned there is something quite unique in his style of thought and language. Conceive the chords of sensibility awakened by the sound of <hi rend="italic">caller herring</hi>! It is little better than the pathos of a great fat greasy Butcher whimpering and blubbering over the calf he has just run his knife into. The truth is, our friend has a radically dull organ of taste; he does every thing in a floundering awkward ostentatious way.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A curiously unfair comment both on the song and Irving&#x2019;s sympathy.</note> I have advised him a thousand times to give up all attempts at superfineness and be a son of Anak<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The sons of Anak, a race of giants in the Old Testament, were all but annihilated by the Israelites. See Num. 13:33.</note> honestly at once, in mind as in body: but he will not see it thus. Occasionally, I confess, I have envied him this want of tact, or rather the contented dimness of perception from which it partly proceeds: it contributes largely to the affectionateness and placidity of his general character; he loves every thing, because he sees nothing in its severe reality; hence his enthusiastic devotion, his fervour on topics adapted to the general comprehension, his eloquence, and the favour he gives to all and so gets from all. I still hope he will improve considerably, but not that he will ever entirely get free of these absurdities. And what if he should not? He has merit to balance ten times as many, and make him still one of the worthiest persons we shall ever meet with. Let us like him the better, the more freely we laugh.</p>
<p>Little Nichol has not seen me, or given me any account of your <pb id="pg-02-269" n="02:269"/>looks good or bad. What right has Nichol to speak about your looks, to have any picture of them in his little mind at all? My hope is that he will have forgot the subject altogether before he meets me&#x2014;an event not likely to occur for many days. We speak for ten minutes twice in the six months and that is quite enough. I find no pleasure in these people; they are of the Earth, earthy;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >1 Cor. 15:47.</note> I would not have them hate me, but our paths lie differently, we have shaken hands and parted long ago. Above all I would not have them speak of <hi rend="italic">you</hi>.</p>
<p>But when am I to judge for myself? When shall I see you with my own eyes face to face?&#x2014; I daresay you are teased with these importunities of mine: but I do not seriously wish you to give any heed to them. I know if I am kept absent from you, it is for good reasons&#x2014;some of which are not unimaginable to me; I leave the matter in your own disposal. If you see me at all, I often think, it is more than I deserve. If I were an absolute monarch, indeed&#x2014; But then I am not. You will be here in <date when="1823-02-00">February</date>?</p>
<p>Tell your friend, that by far the most complete account of Charles I is to be found in Clarendon, his minister, and a deep participator in most of the events he describes. To correct his excessive loyalty the lady should also read Ludlow&#x2019;s memoirs. Ludlow was a republican, and his book is far more easily read than the other: tho&#x2019; I fear she will tire in either. For more minute information, there are Whitelock&#x2019;s Memoirs, Rushworth, Peck&#x2019;s life of Cromwell, May&#x2019;s history of the Parliament; she may also look at Cromwelliana, a volume <supplied>[publish]</supplied>ed some years ago, and consisting of extracts from the Newspapers of the time; it <supplied>[is]</supplied> amusing in some parts,&#x2014;as are likewise the Memoirs of Mrs Colonel Hutchison, a devout lady of the Parliament side, which were printed lately. Oliver Cromwell&#x2019;s life of his great namesake is the stupidest quarto in existence; Thomas Cromwell&#x2019;s I have not seen. On the whole the lady should place her chief dependance on Clarendon; and first read the corresponding part of Hume.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For Clarendon, see <ref target="volume-01/lt-18210424-TC-WG-01">TC to WG, <date when="1821-04-24">24 April 1821</date></ref>; Edmund Ludlow (<date when="1617-00-00">1617</date>?&#x2013;<date when="1694-00-00">94</date>), <hi rend="italic">Memoirs</hi> (<date when="1698-00-00">1698</date>&#x2013;<date when="1699-00-00">99</date>); Sir Bulstrode Whitelock (<date when="1605-00-00">1605</date>&#x2013;<date when="1675-00-00">75</date>), <hi rend="italic">Memorials of English Affairs from the Beginning of the Reign of King Charles I to the Restoration of King Charles II</hi> (<date when="1682-00-00">1682</date>); John Rushworth (<date when="1612-00-00">1612</date>?&#x2013;<date when="1690-00-00">90</date>), <hi rend="italic">Historical Collections</hi> &#x2026; <hi rend="italic"><date when="1618-00-00">1618</date>&#x2013;<date when="1648-00-00">1648</date></hi>, 8 vols.

I envy you being a native of Annandale! You could never guess why! You must know then I have been persuading myself, that this splendid imagination of yours, which is, to me, a never failing subject of admiration, owes a part of its lustre to the fostering it has found from infancy in the traditionary lore in which&#x2014;I have been told&#x2014;your fatherland abounds&#x2014;It is so consolatory to be able to attribute the fine qualities in others, we do not possess ourselves, to external circumstance! Who knows what my imagination might have been had it grown up in a land of tales instead of a land of turnips? had it been fed in its earliest years on border songs, and border legends instead of starving on &#x2018;Molly with the golden arm&#x2019; and &#x2018;The little wee wiffy that lived in a shoe&#x2019;?<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >One early Scottish version of &#x201C;The Old Woman Who Lived in a Shoe&#x201D; begins, &#x201C;There was a <foreign>wee</foreign> bit wifie.&#x201D; The date of the first published text of the poem is <date when="1784-00-00">1784</date>.</note> This is a preamble, you will perceive to the old story&#x2014; My incapacity for writing, a subject which I fear will soon excite as little interest as &#x2018;Warren&#x2019;s blacking.&#x2019;<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Warren&#x2019;s Shoe Blacking, well known throughout Great Britain at this time, was perhaps the first product to be nationally advertised and the first to use illustrations in advertising.

<p>If you have one spark of humanity within your breast send me an outline of some tale to work on; else I shall never get on; for no sooner has my brain got up something like a plot, than I perceive it to be the veriest imbecility, and cast it away for some other, that is, in its turn, discarded with no less contempt.

<salute>My dear Friend,</salute>
<p>I hope to get Vertot for you this afternoon, and I will not let slip the opportunity of scribbling a few lines along with it. You are very <pb id="pg-02-274" n="02:274"/>much mistaken in supposing that I can &#x201C;laugh&#x201D; at any thing which so evidently makes you unhappy as the present subject of your anxiety. If my power were equal to my willingness to aid you, the difficulty would be speedily removed: but alas! &#x201C;therein the patient must minister to herself,&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Macbeth</hi>, V, iii.</note> and the prescription which is so easily given is the hardest in the world to follow.</p>
<p>I wish I had not sent you this great blubbering numbscull D&#x2019;Israeli: his &#x201C;calamities&#x201D; have sunk upon your spirits, and tinged the whole world of intellect with the hue of mourning and despair. The paths of learning seem, in your present mood of mind, to lead but thro&#x2019; regions of woe and lamentation and darkness and dead men&#x2019;s bones. Hang the ass!&#x2014;it is all false, if you take it up in this light. Do you not see that his observations can apply only to men in whom genius was more the want of common qualities than the possession of uncommon ones; whose life was embittered not so much because they had imagination and sensibility, as because they had not prudence and true moral principles? If one chose to investigate the history of the first twenty tattered blackguards to be found lying on the benches of the watch-house, or stewing in drunkenness and squalor in the Jerusalem Tap-room, it would not be difficult to write a much more moving book on the &#x201C;calamities of shoemakers&#x201D; or street-porters, or any other class of handicraftsmen, than this of D&#x2019;Israeli&#x2019;s on Authors. It is the few illstarred wretches, and the multitude of ill-behaved, that are miserable, in all ranks,&#x2014;and among writers just as elsewhere. Literature, I do believe, has keener pains connected with it than almost any other pursuit; but then it has also far livelier and nobler pleasures, and if you shudder at engaging in it on those terms, you ought also to envy the stupidity of other people, their insensibility, the meanness of their circumstances, whatever narrows their sphere of action, and adds more stagnation to the current of their feelings. The dangers with which intellectual enterprises are encompassed should arouse us to vigilance, to unwearied circumspection, to gain the absolute dominion of ourselves: they should not dishearten but instruct. You say rightly that you would not quit this way of life although you could: no one that has once tasted the nectar of science or literature, that will not thirst for it thenceforth to the end. Nor shall my own Scholar repent this her noble determination. Dangers beset her, neither few nor small; but her steadfastness and prudence will conquer them; she will yet be happy and famous beyond her hopes.</p>
    <p><pb id="pg-02-275" n="02:275"/>&#x201C;Oh! if <hi rend="italic">this</hi> were true!&#x201D; you exclaim &#x201C;but&#x201D;&#x2014; Nay, I will have n<supplied>[o]</supplied> buts: it depends entirely upon yourself. I have no more hesitation in affirming that Nature has given you qualities enough to satisfy any reasonable ambition&#x2014;to secure you the much longed for elevation you pant after&#x2014;than I have to believe my own existence. It is no doubt in your own power to frustrate all these hopes, to ruin the fairest promises it has been my chance to witness in any one, and to make your life as wretched as it will be useless. But I trust in God you will be better guided; you will learn in time to moderate your ardour, to cultivate the virtues of patience and self-command, to believe that the sole tho&#x2019; certain road to excellence is thro&#x2019; long tracts of calm exertion and quiet study. Do thing [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] of this, my dear Jane, both for my sake and your own. Why will you vex and torment yourself so, for a precocious fruit, which Time itself would bring to a much happier and more glorious maturity? You must absolutely acquire far more knowledge before your faculties can have any thing like fair play: in your actual condition, I confess they often amaze me. When I was of your age, I had not half the skill. And what haste is there? Rousseau was above thirty, before he suspected himself to be any thing but a thievish apprentice, and a vagabond littleworth: Cowper became a poet at fifty, and found he was still in time enough. Will you also let me say that I continue to lament this inordinate <hi rend="italic">love of Fame</hi> which agitates you so; and which as I believe lies at the root of all this mischief. I think this feeling unworthy of you: it is far too shallow a principle for a mind like yours. Do not imagine that I make no account of a glorious name: I think it the best of <hi rend="italic">external</hi> rewards, but never to be set in competition with those that lie <hi rend="italic">within</hi>. To depend for our highest happiness on the popular breath, to lie at the mercy of every scribbler for our daily meed of enjoyment&#x2014;does seem to me a very helpless state. It is the means of fame not the end that chiefly delights me; if I beli<supplied>[e]</supplied>ved that I had done the very uttermost that I could for myself, had cultivated my soul to the very highest pitch that Nature meant it to reach, I think I could be happy tho&#x2019; no suffrages at all were given me; my conscience would be at rest, I should actually <hi rend="italic">be</hi> a worthy man, whatever I might <hi rend="italic">seem.</hi> You may also take it as an indubitable truth that there is nothing lasting or satisfying in these applauses of others: the only gratification, worth calling by that name, arises from the approval of the <hi rend="italic">man within.</hi> I may also state my firm conviction, that no man ever became <hi rend="italic">famous</hi>, entirely or even chiefly from the <hi rend="italic">love of fame.</hi> It is the interior fire, the solitary delight which our own hearts experience in these things, and the misery we feel in vacancy, <pb id="pg-02-276" n="02:276"/>that must urge us, or we shall never reach the goal.

Do you believe in this doctrine? Then study to keep down this strong desire of notoriety; give scope rather to your feeling of the Beautiful and the Great within yourself, conceive that every new idea you get does actually exalt you as a thinking being, every new branch of knowledge you master, does in very truth make you richer and more enviable tho&#x2019; there were no other being but yourself in the Universe to judge you. There is an independence, a grandeur of solitary power, and strong self-help in this, which attracts one greatly. It makes us the arbiters of our own destiny: it is the surest method of getting glory, and the best means of setting us above the want of it. I do beg of you with all my heart to consider these things well; my own opinion seems to me true as the truest sentence in the Gospel; and if you could adopt it, how much happier would it make you!</p>
<p>I am sorry for you with your Highland Cousin and the gallant Captain Spalding. But it is wrong in you to take these things so much to heart. A little interruption does no harm at all, and these visits as they bring you more in contact with the common world, are in your case absolutely beneficial. Therefore do not cloud your countenance when Spalding enters; do not <supplied>[fill]</supplied> those bright eyes of yours with indignation when he lingers. Study rather to make the man happy, and to be happy with him: throw by your books and papers, and be again a lively thoughtless racketting girl as you were before.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-02/lt-18221111-JBW-TC-01">JBW to TC, <date when="1822-11-11">11 Nov. 1822</date></ref>: &#x201C;I thought it adviseable to play the part of a lively dashing goodhumoured thoughtless blockhead of a girl.&#x201D; See also <ref target="volume-02/lt-18221118-TC-JBW-01">TC&#x2019;s reply of <date when="1822-11-18">18 Nov. 1822</date></ref>.</note> There is much improvement to be got in such things; they give an exercise to the mind as difficult and valuable as any literary study can. Be happy, I tell you; diligent in moderation when the time bids, and idle and gay as willingly. For your Mother, I do entreat you to continue to love her and honour her and prefer her company to that of any other. The exercise of these placid affections is the truest happiness to be got in this world, and the best nourishment for all that is worthiest in our nature. I dare not promise that you will ever find so true a friend as your Mother. Some love us for our qualities&#x2014;for what we are or what we do: but a Mother&#x2019;s bosom is ever the home of her <hi rend="italic">child</hi> independent of all concomitants; ever warm to welcome us in good and bad <pb id="pg-02-277" n="02:277"/>report, a kindly hiding-place which neither misfortune nor misconduct, woe, want or infamy or guilt itself can shut against us.</p>
<p>I am very impudent to preach to you in this style: but it makes me unhappy to see you evidently so uncomfortable; I would gladly open your eyes to the extreme enviableness of your situation. What is to hinder you to read your books and write your essays, and talk with your Mother, and visit the good people round you, and have me for your Tutor and absolute servant, and live in the enjoyment of all simple blessings and the sure hope of all sweet and glorious things, as happy as the day is long? In good truth, My dearest friend, you have too keen and high a soul: you must restrain yourself, or fail by the very excess of your noble qualities.</p>
<p>You cannot speak too much to me of your difficulties in any point. God knows there are few sacrifices I would not make to help you. For your writing, I do not wonder in the least that it agitates and embarrasses you. There never was a human being in your state that did not a thousand times look on himself just as you do, as the stupidest creature in the whole Universe. Nor was there ever a human being more mistaken than you are, this time; or more sure of seeing his mistake.&#x2014; But hark!&#x2014; Two o&#x2019;clock is striking and still here!&#x2014; I must away this instant, before I can even speak to you about a plan. What say you of a life and Criticism on Madame de Sta&#xEB;l? Of an Essay on the Character of Byron? Take the easiest subject first. No matter what. But for Heaven&#x2019;s sake, do not torment yourself about it. I will say more next time. Jack has just come in with Vertot, and Gillies which last I hope you will call for directly. Write to me as if I were your brother&#x2014;that loved you more than fifty brothers,&#x2014;about <hi rend="italic">all</hi> that lies upon your heart. The very talking of it will do you good. God bless you, My dear Jane!</p>

<salute>My dear friend</salute>
<p>How could you find in your heart to inflict on me five whole pages of admonition, for scarce as many words of complaint? Tell you all that lies upon my heart! truly you give me fine encouragement to be so very com<supplied>[m]</supplied>unicative! were I to tell you all, or half, I should expect your next lecture by the carrier&#x2019;s waggon.</p>
<p>I dare say there is reason in what you say on the subject of my grievances&#x2014;and were my eyes open to &#x201C;the <hi rend="italic">extreme enviablness&#x201D;</hi> of my condition, I have no doubt I should be one of the happiest creatures on the face of the earth. However until this blessed revealation takes place, you must bear with me if lumpish visitors, or my own inveterate stupidity or any other impertinence now and then sets me afretting&#x2014;and you may do so the more readily as I do not require pity of you, but only a patient hearing. God forbid that you, of all people, should <hi rend="italic">pity</hi> me! it is but one step from pity to contempt, and you know or you ought to know that of <hi rend="italic">your esteem</hi> I have absolute need.</p>
<p>As to my <hi rend="italic">love of fame</hi> which has been the subject of so much discussion betwixt us I maintain that it is no such shallow principle as you imagine&#x2014;but then your idea of fame is quite different from mine&#x2014; I conceive fame to be something more than the mere applause of a world of people whose individual suffrages I should in all likelihood esteem not worth the having&#x2014;something that is somehow to extend my being beyond the narrow limits of time and place fate has assigned to it&#x2014;to bring my heart into contact with hearts that Nature has cast in the same mould&#x2014;and enable me to hold communion with beings formed to love me and be loved by me in return even while I am divided from them by distance or death itself&#x2014; You will scarcely understand what I would be at&#x2014; I scarce do myself&#x2014;but I feel clearly that I wish to be loved as well as admired&#x2014;to be loved as I love Schiller and de Stael!!! and that unless I believed fame was to bring this about I should not much value it&#x2014; All women love admiration and <pb id="pg-02-282" n="02:282"/><hi rend="italic">I</hi> do not pretend to be an exception to this general rule&#x2014;but the hope of being admired could not of itself strengthen me against the obstacles and temptations that meet me in the course I am pursuing&#x2014; No&#x2014;it is to the hope of being loved, as it were, in spite of <hi rend="italic">fate</hi>, that I sacrifice without regret the follies pleasures and amusements of my age and sex&#x2014;and it is this hope that keeps my heart from breaking, when its affections recoil from the &#x201C;iron breasts&#x201D; around me back on itself&#x2014; You will say it is my own fault that I am not loved <hi rend="italic">alive</hi> and <hi rend="italic">seen</hi>&#x2014;it is not! indeed it is not! all the hearts mine is cast among all but one&#x2014;are inacessibly intrenched within their self love. I might indeed attach many to me by benefits&#x2014;or by <hi rend="italic">the pleasure they find in my society</hi> or simply by the need of some attachment but of these I make no account&#x2014; it is the <hi rend="italic">&#x2018;love of moral esteem&#x2019;</hi> not <hi rend="italic">&#x2018;the love of gratitude&#x2019;</hi> that I desire&#x2014;and these love me for their own sake not mine&#x2014; but I am writing the greatest quantity of nonsense I ever committed to paper&#x2014;hurry and headach<supplied>[e]</supplied> must plead for my intellect&#x2014; I have news for you that will I hope please you as much as it did me&#x2014;my Mother wonders you do not think of coming out!!!&#x2014; Now do you not see the fruit of my restrictions?&#x2014; Had you come sooner on your <hi rend="italic">own</hi> invitation or mine&#x2014;you would have found nothing but cold looks and I should have been kept on thorns until you left me and now I am formally desired to invite you here, <hi rend="italic">&#x2018;in case it may be that you are standing on ceremony&#x2019;</hi>&#x2014;and come when you like dear you are sure of a hearty welcome&#x2014; You cannot think how glad I am&#x2014;for I make myself sure of your coming immediately&#x2014;no not immediately&#x2014;for my cousin will not be gone for a week&#x2014;but do write soon and tell me what day you will come&#x2014; Oh my poor head&#x2014;and people are come to dinner and I am not dressed&#x2014; we have had company every day this week and my lessons!

<salute>My dear Friend,</salute>
<p>I daresay, if you have nothing better to occupy your thoughts, you have already marked me down for a very ungrateful or very lazy person, because I have not sooner answered your kind and most acceptable letter. This, like many of your conclusions and mine, is far too hasty and quite erroneous. By and by, you will find that I have written you no fewer than three epistles since that date; two of which by the cruel hand of fate have been sent to the flames instead of to Haddington, and the third is still lying among Corinna and a heap of other books waiting till the Coach begins running, to come and pay its respects to you. Certainly, since the retreat from Moscow, there has been no weather like this: it would do credit to the northernmost point of Nova Zembla.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Or Novaya Zemlya, an island in the Arctic Ocean between the Barents Sea and the Kara Sea.</note> It is really quite piteous to see the once hale and portly Burghers of this City, all shrunk together, and cowering about under cloaks and dreadnoughts and plaids of every description, their eyes streaming with tears, their lips cracked, their noses as blue as indigo;&#x2014;now encrusted with snow or soaked in rain, now wading ancle-deep in melting ice, now tottering on slippery pavements, and ever and anon rushing down to the bosom of their frosty Mother with a squelch which astonishes the whole neighbourhood. The very dandies have forgot their struts and simperings as they walk: you may see their heels make a sudden sweep from beneath them, and point for a moment to the zenith, in an attitude, which Vestris<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lucia Elizabeth Mathews (<hi rend="italic">n&#xE9;e</hi> Bartolozzi), known as Mme Vestris (<date when="1797-00-00">1797</date>&#x2013;<date when="1856-00-00">1856</date>), was a well-known singer and actress who first appeared on the London stage at Drury Lane Theatre in <date when="1820-00-00">1820</date>. She married Augustus Vestris in <date when="1813-00-00">1813</date> and Charles Mathews in <date when="1835-00-00">1835</date>. See <ref target="volume-02/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/18331"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>.</note> never practiced. All this is quite heart-breaking&#x2014;at least to a benevolent character: but it is one of those sorrows which complaining cannot mend; so I leave it to time and patience, &#x201C;the sovran&#x2019;st things on Earth&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">I Henry IV</hi>, I, iii.</note> for such ailments.</p>
<p>With regard to this much-valued &#x201C;invitation&#x201D;, I have already told you half a dozen times, and myself about five hundred, that I <hi rend="italic">will come</hi>, if the life be in me. The object of my scrawling at present is to ask you whether Friday week will do&#x2014;that is the second Friday from this date? If so, I propose to drink tea with you that evening, to spend <pb id="pg-02-284" n="02:284"/>Saturday and Sunday in talking about all manner of things with you, and then return on Monday-morning. You will write to me as soon as you have a moment&#x2019;s leisure to let me know whether this will answer; and if it do, you may expect me without farther notice<supplied>[.]</supplied> Present my kindest compliments to your mother, and say all that is necessary on such an occasion. I cannot tell you how glad I am that things have turned out this way: I am going in future to obey your behests in all these things with the most implicit submission; you alone are fit to guide the <hi rend="italic">commonwealth</hi>, my interference does nothing but drive it to confusion. Will you write to me this week&#x2014;for I am anxious to know your determination. It is a whole twelvemonth since I have seen your face; but in ten days I shall, in spite of fate.</p>
<p>Excuse my haste and ineptitude, and this &#x201C;diabolical pen.&#x201D; Write to me the first moment you have. I hope you will get the books one of these days. In the mean time be happy and contented in the interruption of your studies; we will set that and all other matters to rights when we meet: you have studied most heroically for the last three months; if we had our plans arranged, you will go on triumphantly. On Friday, then, I shall see you? God bless you, My dear Jane!</p>
<p><closer><salute>I am ever, / Your most affectionate Friend, /</salute></closer> <name>Thomas Carlyle&#x2014;</name></p>
<ps><p>Tell your Mother that Corinna is coming, and that she may keep it, if once in her hands, as long as she likes.</p></ps>

<salute>My dear Friend</salute>
<p>There is not a sheep-farmer in the whole country has more cause than I have to cry out about this storm&#x2014;it has untuned my instrument&#x2014;killed my passion-tree<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A variety of passion-flower, cultivated for fruit, not likely to do well in eastern Scotland.</note>&#x2014;detained that highland <foreign><hi rend="italic">Schaafskopf</hi></foreign> [muttonhead] here beyond all patience&#x2014;and, worst of all it has greatly impeded my communication with the only person whose sage advices might have enabled me to bear all these disasters with becoming fortitude&#x2014; When I saw the snow rising higher and higher I really began to fear Providence a second time weary of the wickedness of the Earth <pb id="pg-02-285" n="02:285"/>designed to try choking with us instead of drowning&#x2014;but to day I am greatly relieved&#x2014;the snow is beginning to tumble off the houses and the roads will surely be open before Friday&#x2014; I have told my Mother that you are coming and she seems in perfect good humour&#x2014; What generalship it has required to bring matters to this point! my Mother took it into her head when you was last here to dislike you with all her heart&#x2014;as my regard for you increased her&#x2019;s seemed to diminish in an inverse ratio&#x2014; I must either give up my friend, or disoblige my Mother there seemed no other alternative&#x2014;now my friends are not so plenty that they should be lightly parted with&#x2014;and my Mother is not so easily pleased that she should be lightly offended.

<salute>My dear Friend,</salute>
<p>I have written you so many letters of late and burnt them, that I am almost afraid to venture again. At any rate I have just ten minutes time at present; so you will not be troubled with me long. I want very much to know whether I am to come out on Friday. Will you tell me as soon as you can: or if my scheme is wrong, say <hi rend="italic">when</hi>? I need not say how much I long to see you&#x2014;to talk over all our plans and feelings together: there is scarcely any other person in the world to whom I desire so much to unbosom myself freely. Will you write soon?</p>

<salute>My dear Johnston,</salute>
<p>It was a curious coincidence that just at the moment when your letter was handed in to me, I was busily engaged in scribbling one to you. The state in which the Cupar affair stands at present was better than my hopes:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In his letter to Carlyle of <date when="1823-02-10">10 Feb.</date> Johnston wrote: &#x201C;A few days after I had got my certificates, there was handed in to me by the postman, a number of the Cupar Herald, in which I found a long prospectus of a new Academy to be established in that place. I immediately conjectured that this must have been sent me by the provost, or some person concerned in the affair. Upon this idea, I wrote again to Mr Christie, giving the reasons why my certificates had not been sent; and desiring to know whether I was still in time. In answer to this, I yesterday received a letter from him, by which I learn, that it <hi rend="italic">was</hi> he who sent me the paper, and that owing to the new arrangements, it will be five or six weeks before any thing be done about electing teachers; and that I will have full time to collect and forward my certificates. So stands the business at present.&#x2014; From Mr Christie&#x2019;s conduct and letters, I can easily see that he wishes me to come forward&#x2014; None who have views to the ministry need offer themselves as candidates. This limits the range of competition.&#x201D;</note> I forthwith laid aside my scrawl and wrote down <pb id="pg-02-288" n="02:288"/>a certificate, which I have now transferred to the other side of this sheet: if it can aid you in the smallest I shall feel exceedingly happy. In fact I do think the matter looks rather favourably at present. Do you exert yourself like an indefatigable man to bring it to a fortunate issue; get testimonials from all and sundry, go down to Cupar if you can conveniently, and stir the waters in every direction. Were you once fairly seated in the chair of that Academy, I should cease to fear for your success in life, for <supplied>[the]</supplied> obtaining of that modest and genuine happiness which your own <supplied>[heart]</supplied> longs after, and to which your merits so well entitle you to aspire. Indeed I do not fear, at any rate: you have only to persist in steadfast patience, and many situations quite as enviable as this will lie within your easy reach. Be of good cheer, then, whatever happens! Let no effort be wanting in the mean time, and if all efforts will not gain the object, say with Frederick the Great: <hi rend="italic">Another time we will do better.</hi> Have you written to Mitchell? If not, lose no moment. About ten minutes ago I received a letter from Irving: he is flourishing like to a tree near planted by a river:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Ps. 1:3.</note> I will make him send the paper you require&#x2014;if possible&#x2014;but he is lazy as ever man was, or busier by far than I should wish to be. Have you heard of his Sermon-book?<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edward Irving&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">For the Oracles of God, Four Orations. For Judgment to Come, an Argument, in Nine Parts</hi> (London, <date when="1823-00-00">1823</date>). A second edition appeared in <date when="1823-00-00">1823</date> and a third in <date when="1824-00-00">1824</date>. Irving was not lazy, but busy.</note> It is coming out presently. I doubt not it will cause the ear to tingle.&#x2014; We have no news here or have heard none from Annandale worth mentioning. Our poor Aunt Agnes has at length ceased her sufferings and complainings: she died rather suddenly about a month ago: I felt more on the occasion than I could have expected. She was a harmless tho&#x2019; most unhappy soul. Since newyearsday I have been very inconstant in regard to health: at present I am weak, weak. But the Bullers purpose going to Largs in Summer; and I entertain the grandest hopes from quietness and country <pb id="pg-02-289" n="02:289"/>air. It is a cursed thing this want of health; but one cannot help it. John is well and busy: he desires to be most kindly remembered by you: he would write if he had aught to say&#x2014;or time to say it. Duncan<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Duncan Church.</note> also is well. When will you write to us? Do not linger so long as you did last time, else&#x2014;! Be busy in this matter of Cupar, and let us know regularly how it proceeds. <closer><salute>I am always (My dear Friend) Most sincerely your&#x2019;s</salute></closer> <name>Th: Carlyle</name></p>

<salute>My dear Friend,</salute>
<p>I am certainly a very idle person; or I should not again so soon be troubling you with my lucubrations. It were far better to profit by the wholesome excitement which your words and still more your presence never fails to inspire me with, than to speculate about it; better to obey the favourable impulse of my impressions than to spend time in recording them. But tho&#x2019; &#x201C;the spirit is willing, the flesh is weak&#x201D;:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Matt. 26:41.</note> you must let me talk to-day; to-morrow I shall rise and be doing.</p>
<p>In spite of bad health and all its wretched <foreign><hi rend="italic">etceteras</hi></foreign>, I am greatly pleased with this visit of mine. The kind hospitality of your Mother, the affectionate friendship of my own Jane are delightful to look back upon, in spite of all obstructions. To <hi rend="italic">you</hi> I know not how I can be grateful enough for the pleasure which you have both the power and the will to diffuse over even the most desolate portions of my existence. If I did not trust that there was a long and brighter future before us, I should feel quite overburthened with my debt. Another genuine gratification which I have derived from this excursion is the conviction it has given me of your rapid and constant improvement. It seems to me as if your mind were almost doubled in power and real wealth since I talked with you last year. I am proud to think of your noble devotion, to compare the way in which you spend your hours with that in which most young women spend them. The spectacle of so many temptations vanquished, so much ardour expended in such a cause, would interest me for the meanest of my fellow mortals. I pray that you may long continue so gloriously employed: you have reason in the mean time to be thankful that you have at last fairly entered on so extensive and so praiseworthy a field of exertions; I feel more <pb id="pg-02-290" n="02:290"/>and more certain that no other could have offered any free and profitable expansion to your faculties; as a mere Lady you must have felt even in the most brilliant station completely unhappy, your utmost efforts might have been required to prevent your very gifts from degenerating into vices. But it is not merely in an intellectual point of view that I congratulate myself on the progress you are making. As a woman, it strikes me, that, your improvement is not less marked. Your affections I think are becoming more catholic, your tastes more simple; you seemed far more kindly and affectionate and every way amiable. Perhaps my individual experience corrupts my judgement; but I certainly hope more confidently than ever that you are yet to realize all my anticipations of you&#x2014;to be not only a shining ornament of literature, but what is even better, the happy and happy-making Wife of some gallant character that will know how to prize you;&#x2014;to gain both the laurel of intellectual reputation, and what our Schiller calls the <hi rend="italic">crown of womanhood, &#x201C;<foreign>liebend eines Mannes Herz begl&#xfc;ckend</foreign>&#x201D;</hi> [&#x201C;by loving making glad a man&#x2019;s heart&#x201D;].&#x2014; I have often thought of Sundaynight, and wondered what it was that pleased me so in it. We said nothing worth remembering, the scene was simple, our employments still simpler: what then made me happy? The French say truly: <foreign><hi rend="italic">Le plus grand des plaisirs, c&#x2019;est l&#x2019;abandon de soi-meme</hi></foreign> [To lose self-consciousness is the greatest of pleasures]. It is such hours as those that I look back upon as on something far finer than the common stuff that life is made of. If I thought we two could always spend our evenings so, I fear I should be tempted to forget my own principles and your interests both; and assail you with all my rhetoric to fly with me to some Highland or Lowland glen, no matter where or of what kind, so we had it to ourselves!!!&#x2014; But ah! But ah! What would my rhetoric avail? Nor am I such a ninny as to wish it should avail. I know well that there is no rest which is not purchased by toil; the first great want of our mind is vigorous action, the next is outward means: but vallies and glens are places of idleness and privation; and pleasure without its fit attendants is but a curse the more. So I must not think of glens: we are far better as we are.</p>
<p>But really I am prosing very unaccountably: I must proceed to business. Here are the first two volumes of Delphine<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >By Mme de Sta&#xEB;l (Paris, <date when="1803-00-00">1803</date>).</note> for your Mother; and I have sent John to see if he can get Boc<supplied>[c]</supplied>accio<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Giovanni Boccaccio (<date when="1313-00-00">1313</date>&#x2013;<date when="1374-00-00">74</date>), <hi rend="italic">Decamerone o ver Cento Novelle</hi> (<date when="1344-00-00">1344</date>&#x2013;<date when="1350-00-00">50</date>).</note> for you. Even yet I am in doubt about the sending of it: four years ago I should <pb id="pg-02-291" n="02:291"/>have at once decided in the negative. As it is, however, you must venture. The book after all has not <hi rend="italic">many</hi> impurities; and over your mind, these will pass like breath across a mirror, darkening it for a moment, and only for a moment.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi>, V, 117&#x2013;19.</note> I believe ladies do read the work whenever they can: Mrs Buller speaks without hesitation of having perused it in French. After all, perhaps you may not get it, or if you do may not like it; and more preliminaries are superfluous. Boc<supplied>[c]</supplied>accio is the least of all like Schiller or your other favourites.</p>
<p>Now have you finished Las Cases<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Comte Emmannuel Dieudonn&#xE9; de Las Cases (<date when="1766-00-00">1766</date>&#x2013;<date when="1842-00-00">1842</date>), <hi rend="italic">M&#xE9;morial de Sainte H&#xE9;l&#xE8;ne</hi> (<date when="1823-00-00">1823</date>).</note>? I long to hear of your having procured de Sta&#xEB;l, and being fairly set forth in your literary enterprize. I have even some fears that the book will not be forthcoming; for I tried yesterday, and found that except from Mr Aitken there was no chance for it. I pray you ascertain this as soon as may be; and if you succeed not, we shall strike out something else as good. The title of the work I think is: Mad. Necker&#x2019;s Life of Mad de Sta&#xEB;l.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Albertine Adrienne Necker de Saussure (<date when="1766-00-00">1766</date>&#x2013;<date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>), <hi rend="italic">Notice sur le caract&#xE8;re et les &#xE9;crits de Madame de Sta&#xEB;l</hi> (London, <date when="1820-00-00">1820</date>).</note> Mr Bradfute was the Publisher here, and so is likely to have a copy of it.</p>
<p>I have read over the <hi rend="italic">Rival Brothers</hi><note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A five-act tragedy written by Jane when she was 14. A. Carlyle says that Dr. Welsh seems to have sent it to Terrot, afterward Bishop of Edinburgh, for his criticism and correction and that he replied in an undated letter: &#x201C;My dear Sir,&#x2014; I return you the &#x2018;Rival Brothers&#x2019; which (though I had heard it much praised) is much beyond what I expected to find it. Considering her age it gives a fair promise of what she may hereafter be able to do. There is considerable invention and the language is almost uniformly correct. The metre is sometimes deficient. I have taken the liberty of marking with a pencil the objectionable parts. &#x2026; Blank verse is upon the whole much more difficult to write than any of our rhyming measures. The best example of its Tragic form is Massinger.&#x2014; I hope Miss Welsh will take my remarks in good part;&#x2014;excepting the measure there is little room for correction.&#x2014; Yours truly,&#x2014; C. H. Terrot.&#x201D;</note> [underscored twice]&#x2014;and with more real enjoyment than any regular tragedy has given me of late. I am not going to flatter you with talk about the promises of genius which it affords, tho&#x2019; I must say that for a girl of fourteen it seems a very curious affair: but my interest was arrested by other causes. To me it was as if I had been surveying on the mountain-tops the sources of some clear and smiling stream along whose banks I had often lingered with delight before unknown to me&#x2014;whose widening, more majestic course I hoped yet to follow till the great Ocean should receive us both. For some such reasons I suppose it is that I <hi rend="italic">like</hi> the little tragedy, and must ask you to let me keep it till you want it for <pb id="pg-02-292" n="02:292"/>some better purpose. I must also request you to be very careful of the small <hi rend="italic">arm-chair</hi>,<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A. Carlyle says that this is Jane&#x2019;s little chair mentioned in Carlyle&#x2019;s will and in his <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi>.</note> which stands in the room beside your parlour! I know not how I felt when I saw the poor little thing standing so quietly beside the hearth: it brought bygone days before my fancy; I could have rhymed like a Lake-poet over it. This is very childish? Very! but what can I do to help it? You must let me prate for once.</p>
<p>At length however my course is well nigh done. I must lay aside this dissipated humour, and begin to work. The day after to-morrow, I am vowing to begin another <hi rend="italic">Tale</hi>. It was you that bade me, so you must answer for the issue. I have long been very idle, and am growing more and more stupid every day. Scarce any thing can rouse me, and every thing goes to wreck when I cease exertion. I wish you were beside me constantly: under your auspices I feel as if it were a crime to let sickness or any other cause keep me one moment from my speed. You are growing far more merciful of late: but should I abuse your mercy?</p>
<p>I look forward to the beginning of <date when="1823-03-00">March</date> with hopes of spending many many an hour beside you. For God&#x2019;s sake do get the matter all arranged as you said; send them all away, and stay here a month by yourself. You need not fear that I will incommode you too much: I promise to make you absolute mistress of my movements in that respect; to go and to come exactly as you shall require. Only you must if possible contrive to get me some employment that will keep me beside you some hours every day. You must read German or do something: I leave the whole with yourself; for you have undertaken to manage the <hi rend="italic">commonwealth</hi>, and I put all faith in your administration. Exert your skill then: you have <hi rend="italic">two</hi> to care for, and one of them is very sticklish about his interests.</p>
<p>I had a long and very hearty letter the other day from Irving,<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dated <date when="1823-02-14">14 Feb.</date></note> who professes to be dying for news from Scotland. His mind I can see is in a very foamy state, which he is evidently struggling to repress or conceal. After all abatements, he is one of the very best fellows breathing. Do you mark this paragraph? &#x201C;I pray you to give my dearest affection to my beloved pupil Jane Welsh, if&#x201D; (what an <hi rend="italic">if</hi>!) &#x201C;you are in correspondence with her. I shall never cease to love her like a Brother. Now that I have shaken off the lethargy of winter, I shall write to her.&#x201D;</p>
<p>But when will she (this beloved pupil) write to me? I am waiting <pb id="pg-02-293" n="02:293"/>patiently and hoping well. We are now grown <hi rend="italic">old friends</hi>, there should be less reserve, we ought at last to know each other. You have written excellently of late: I only ask that you do not &#x201C;fall away from your first love.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Here is John with old Boccaccio! you will get the <hi rend="italic">Novelle</hi> to-morrow. Tell me all that you have done about De Sta&#xEB;l; how you like G&#xF6;tz,<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Goethe&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">G&#xF6;tz von Berlichingen</hi> (<date when="1773-00-00">1773</date>).</note> and Gillies, and what other thing you want. If you would gratify me, shew me I entreat you how I may be of service to you. Hitherto <supplied>[my will]</supplied> has not been faulty; but alas! for the performance!&#x2014; Write to <supplied>[me as]</supplied> soon as possible: let the letter be as long and careless and garrulous and truehearted as it can be made. You must walk out <hi rend="italic">every day</hi>, when the weather is dry: you <hi rend="italic">must</hi> if you love yourself or me. When otherwise, play at shuttlecock for two full hours.</p>
<p>The Bullers talk of going to Largs<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A seaport on the Firth of Clyde thirty miles west-southwest of Glasgow.</note> in Summer: I will send to Mainhill for the ambling Galloway, and ride over all the moors in the West. I expect it will make me quite whole and sound. Poor old Kemp!<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Kemp. Edward Irving writes to TC on <date when="1823-02-23">23 Feb.</date>: &#x201C;This same post shall carry a Letter to poor Robert Kemp for whom I am truly more distressed than I can utter, the more as I had never heard a word of his calamities, but I can now figure all. His health has failed under his labours, and his pittance of money has worn down, and he finds himself without means and without strength in a place almost of strangers.&#x201D;</note> I cannot get him out of my head. Sometimes I have almost been ready to ask <hi rend="italic">you</hi> to go and visit him some mid-day. It were an errand of mercy which would not disgrace you. He requires to be consoled and humoured, and fed with with [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] hopes; and the people that go near him seem to contradict the poor soul too much. I really pity him from the heart.</p>
<p>But I must conclude this piebald scrawl. I am not now <hi rend="italic">upon my good behavior before the Court</hi>, or I should dread the censure of my Judge for some things I have scribbled. Write soon: and believe me to be,</p>
<p><closer><salute>My dear Jane, / Ever most affectionately Your&#x2019;s /</salute></closer> <name>Thomas Carlyle&#x2014;</name></p>

<salute>My dear Friend</salute>
<p>I flatter myself you will, by this time be out of all patience&#x2014; I should and would have written to you sooner could I have got it done&#x2014; Since ever the fine weather commenced we have been paying for the respite we enjoyed during the storm&#x2014; The &#x201C;Callers by profession&#x201D; of whom our friend <hi rend="italic">Doctor Joralic</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not identified.

It is not clear whether Jane is speaking of a real author or a fictitious one whom she had encountered in her reading. Whoever Joralic was, Carlyle&#x2019;s letter of <ref target="volume-02/lt-18230304-TC-JBW-01"><date when="1823-03-04">4 March</date></ref> indicates that he pretty well agrees with Jane&#x2019;s opinion concerning him.</note> speaks so disrespectfully have been swarming in every quarter and so extremely lavish of their civilities to us that I have scarce had time to learn my lessons let alone scribbling&#x2014; You have positively smothered me with books&#x2014; I entreat you will send me no more till I have done with those I have got which will be&#x2014;I should think&#x2014;about this time next year&#x2014; I return Gillies&#x2014;when I have made some acquirements in philosophy I shall perhaps have fortitude to attempt it again&#x2014; At present&#x2014;I would as soon undertake to climb Ben Nevis<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The highest peak in Great Britain, located in western Scotland in the Grampians.</note> as read it to the end&#x2014; I am staggering through Goethe as fast as I can&#x2014;that is very slowly&#x2014; Schiller was nothing to this&#x2014; Goe<supplied>[t]</supplied>z puzzled me so excessively that I thought it adviseable to let it alone for a little and try something else&#x2014; I chose Stella as I had read it in french&#x2014;and with great difficulty I have got through it and part of Clavigo<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Works by Goethe: <hi rend="italic">G&#xF6;tz von Berlichingen</hi> (<date when="1773-00-00">1773</date>); <hi rend="italic">Stella</hi> (Berlin, <date when="1776-00-00">1776</date>); <hi rend="italic">Clavigo, a Tragedy</hi> (Leipzig, <date when="1774-00-00">1774</date>).</note>&#x2014; I do not think I shall like Goethe much unless he improves greatly&#x2014;he has fire enough but it is not the celestial fire of Schiller&#x2014; I have read no more of Boccac<supplied>[c]</supplied>io than his description of the plague which is extremely powerful from the hesitation you seemed to have in allowing me to read him I felt inclined to return it immediately&#x2014;but on reflection I thought it silly to deprive myself of the pleasure of reading a clever work because it contained some exceptionable passages which I might pass of<supplied>[f]</supplied> even if I found them disagreeable&#x2014;so I shall go on&#x2014;at least as long as I find it for my good&#x2014; I like D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Joralic very much&#x2014;and I would like him still better if he was not so immoderat<supplied>[e]</supplied>ly fond of tropes and figures&#x2014; One <pb id="pg-02-295" n="02:295"/>cannot serve God and Mammon and I should think Fancy and Metaphysics are not less distinct&#x2014;the ingenious D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> perplexes both himself and his readers in trying to combine them&#x2014;</p>
<p>I have found such a prize since you were here&#x2014;at the top of a dark lane in a back part of the town I have discovered&#x2014;you would never guess what! I have actually discovered a Genius!!! Was there every <supplied>[ever]</supplied> any thing so fortunate?&#x2014; I was so much in want of something to give an interest to my leisure hours&#x2014;and what could fill up the vacuum better than this? even a lover would not have answered my purpose half so well!&#x2014; The said Genius is a beggar-boy about sixteen years of age&#x2014; He lives with his Mother an old miserable woman in a kind of cell four feet square or thereabouts&#x2014; Never had Genius such a habitation&#x2014;one stool, a palsied table, a sort of wooden press and the womans bedstead compose the whole furniture of their little sorrowful dwelling&#x2014;and yet it has a look of cleanliness I may almost say of taste that keeps one from shuddering at its abject poverty&#x2014; the black clay walls are almost entirely covered with drawings&#x2014;heads&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">globes</hi> Landscapes, caricatures&#x2014;all sorts of things&#x2014;many of them displaying great invention and a considerable knowledge of the principles of the art&#x2014;a very perfect model of a Man of war stands in the window place and the table is loaded with a number of books&#x2014;so tattered&#x2014;so smoked they might have been the property of Noah&#x2014;the ship&#x2014;the drawings&#x2014;are the handiwork of my Genius&#x2014;and the books have been collected by him from&#x2014;God knows where!&#x2014; Nor are these all his treasures&#x2014;the wooden press contains many more&#x2014;you would be amazed to see this humble imitation of an artist&#x2019;s Cabinet it<supplied>[s]</supplied> motely contents are arranged with so much order and taste!&#x2014;from this repository he produced a small budget of manuscript poetry which he got from a woman he said that could not read it&#x2014; no wonder! such a manuscript! such poetry!&#x2014; however he seemed to set a high value on it&#x2014;most likely&#x2014;because it is the only <hi rend="italic">factual work</hi> in his library&#x2014; I asked him if he was fond of poetry&#x2014;the creature&#x2019;s eyes sparkled as he answered me &#x201C;Oh grand!

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I trusted fully that to-day I should be able to make you some amends for the pitiful scrawl which was all I could send you last time; but on waiting the issue I find myself again disappointed. The Bullers are going out to dine to-day, and I am to spend the evening in the house with their boys. I could easily have dispensed with the honour; but as it is I must make the best of a bad bargain, and scribble you a few lines before their dinner-time, tho&#x2019; my hands are so numb with cold got in walking that I can hardly form a legible word. We had a fall of snow yesterday, which the sun has scarcely licked up yet; and <pb id="pg-02-297" n="02:297"/>the air is chill by reason of it. On the whole however this weather is very precious to me: I have not been so well for a long while. I trust, My dear Mother, that you too are tasting the benefits of returning spring, and feeling more comfortable than you did in the horrid storms we had thro&#x2019; winter. It is hard for one to be so like a vegetable; but one cannot help it.</p>
<p>These cakes and eggs and butter have furnished us for a long time: we have nothing but thanks to give you in return,&#x2014;and our cordial approbation of the ware itself. I have already half-dined upon the cakes, and can give my verdict honestly in their favour. I wish we had any thing as savoury to send to the south. Here is some grain of tea, which I am going to persuade you to make use of. I am quite convinced a little of it would be of the greatest service to you <hi rend="italic">every night</hi>; and if so, <hi rend="italic">why</hi> do you not take it? Give me leave to say that it is not kind in you to deny me that gratification. If it were one&#x2019;s last shilling, it were a different affair; but as we are, what are a few bits of stamped paper to the pleasure of doing one another good? Our money and ourselves are alike hastening to decay, but the pure and kind feelings we excite in each other shall outlive the world itself. If there is <hi rend="italic">any</hi> thing therefore that I can do to help you, I entreat you to let me know. This has been so often repeated that it looks like mere profession, but I feel within me that it is something more</p>
<p>The Bullers were talking of going to the country in summer, and they once spoke of Largs as the particular place; but that last part of the project is all gone to the winds again, and they now know not whither they are going. They are still determined for the country they say, and what is more I am myself determined for it, for if they do not go thither, I intend accompanying Mrs Wilkie down to Portobello, a place on the seashore about two miles from hence, where she has a good house in the middle of a garden all to herself, and a stable in which I shall stall the worthy steed that Sandy has and ride up on it to town every day. This dark and smoky den of filth and wickedness (it is a good and beautiful city, whatever I may say when out of humour with it) shall not hold me here thro&#x2019; out the bright months of the year. I understand however that the Bullers <hi rend="italic">are</hi> determined to make some change in their abode shortly; they talk of going back to London, and leaving me with their sons; they talk of sending us to St Andrews; they talk of twenty things, and can fix on none. They have something else to do forsooth! They have to go to balls and make balls, and give dinners and take them, and entertain the mob of gentlemen that wear laced coats and perfumed handkerchiefs. I often think I had <pb id="pg-02-298" n="02:298"/>rather break stones with Candlewick Andrew on the King&#x2019;s Highway. Yet they are good people, and very kind and respectful to me in their way: I am obliged to them for this, and study to keep myself quiet and easy, which I can do the more readily, as I find that at bottom I do not care a doit for one of them. If we were to part forever to-morrow, I believe their loss would be no smaller than mine. So we jog on quite contentedly together. I would rather have you for a mother than twenty Mrs Bullers, tho&#x2019; she dances excellently and plays and jigs and dresses and talks <hi rend="italic">just like a lady</hi>, as I am told. It may be so, but <hi rend="italic">these</hi> Ladies are not for my money.&#x2014; <hi rend="italic">Herders</hi> Mother (Herder<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Johann Gottfried von Herder (<date when="1744-00-00">1744</date>&#x2013;<date when="1803-00-00">1803</date>), German philosopher and writer who lived in Weimar from <date when="1776-00-00">1776</date> to <date when="1803-00-00">1803</date>.

<salute>My dear Friend,</salute>
<p>I have scarcely a moment of time at present; yet it seems wrong to let these books lie waiting another day; so I must write to you under whatever disadvantages. The Milliners are settled with, the <hi rend="italic">Mustard</hi> [underscored twice] is ready; and the sooner you are done with my dulness, the better.</p>
<p>I am glad that you have found so innocent a pastime as the fostering of a genius. Your Knight of Industry appears in truth to be somewhat of a singular character; but I demur as to the conclusion you have arrived at respecting him. In my time I have fallen in with several such personnages, youths that hated labour, made models of ships, drew pictures, and loved to read ballads and penny-histories; but they all enlisted to be soldiers or marines, or eloped with mountebanks, or became pick-pockets or candle-snuffers in strolling companies of players, and were all shot or hanged or starved to death when their hour came; not one of them turned out a genius. This is hard measure, but so goes the world. I hope better things, however, of this poor boy; and I love you for taking any thought about his fortunes. If some <pb id="pg-02-299" n="02:299"/>house- or sign-painter would accept of him for an apprentice, the luckless might earn himself a subsistence in the mean time, might gradually acquire habits of regular industry, and by and by, if he have any talents, rise into some more respectable department of the pictorial art. I am really partly sorry for the poor boy.</p>
<p>This <foreign><hi rend="italic">contretems</hi></foreign> of Mr Aiken&#x2019;s is particularly provoking. I called at his shop on Saturday, and made a large snuffy lout of a person, who seemed to be his factotum, go and rummage all the premises for the book,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mme Necker de Saussure&#x2019;s biography of Mme de Sta&#xEB;l. See <ref target="volume-02/lt-18230218-TC-JBW-01">TC to JBW, <date when="1823-02-18">18 Feb.</date></ref></note> as if I had been going to buy it; but tho&#x2019; this gentleman &#x201C;perfectly recollected the publication,&#x201D; and engaged to find it for me in five minutes&#x2014;he did not keep his word. The Work he brought down from the upper story was not Mad. Necker&#x2019;s Memoirs of Mad. de Stael, but Mad. de Staels&#x2019; Memoirs of M. Necker.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Paris and London, <date when="1818-00-00">1818</date>.</note> He finished by declaring that the Book was not in Town.&#x2014; What is to be done now? I have been trying to invent something suitable for you; but nothing can I think of, that I could describe here, or that (I fear) you would not receive with a huff if I could. There are Essays and so forth that I might speak of, but all of them have more or fewer drawbacks; and I imagine it will be better for us to postpone the consideration of the business entirely till your arrival in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, when all the pros and cons of it may be discussed so much more conveniently. I am really vexed that you are not going forward with any composition: the art of giving out ideas is about as essential and certainly more laborious than that of gathering them in. We must really make an effort to remedy this deficiency, and that as early as possible. In the mean time do not disturb yourself about it; go on with your Gibbon and your other studies calmly and diligently, and assure yourself that if not in the best of all modes, your employment is in the next to the best. I do trust you will not grow idle or irregular again; there is nothing satisfactory to be accomplished by you if you do; every thing if you avoid doing it. You must make another effort upon G&#xF6;tz: it is hardest at the first<supplied>[.]</supplied> This Goethe has as much in him as any ten of them:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Kraftm&#xE4;nner</hi> of German and English literature. Cf. Carlyle&#x2019;s comments on Byron.</note> he is not a mere bacchanalian rhymester, cursing and foaming and laying about him as if he had breathed a gallon of nitrous oxide, or pouring forth his most inane philosophy and most maudlin sorrow in strains that &#x201C;split the ears of the groundlings&#x201D;;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi>, III, ii.</note> but a man of true culture and universal genius, not less distinguished for the extent of his knowledge and the profoundness <pb id="pg-02-300" n="02:300"/>of his ideas and the variety of his feelings, than for the vivid and graceful energy, the inventive and deeply meditative sagacity, the skill to temper enthusiasm with judgement, which he shews in exhibiting them. Wordsworth and Byron! They are as the Christian Ensign and Captain Bobadil<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A braggart captain in Jonson&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Every Man in His Humour</hi>.</note> before the Duke of Marlboro!. You must go on with G&#xF6;tz: it will serve you to read while <hi rend="italic">here</hi>, if it do not better. I wish it would.</p>
<p>There is no <hi rend="italic">Tale</hi> here then? Alas! no! Man is not master of his destiny: I was just commencing a <hi rend="italic">most elaborate performance</hi>, when a second Epistle of Irving gave quite a new direction to my thoughts. He had been speaking with Taylor of the London Magazine;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Taylor of Taylor and Hessey, the firm which published the <hi rend="italic">London Magazine</hi>. Irving had recently met Taylor at Allan Cunningham&#x2019;s and had been very favorably impressed by him. In his letter to Carlyle of <date when="1823-02-23">23 Feb.</date>, Irving had urged Carlyle that he &#x201C;forthwith, set about these portraitures of men of genius and character, and month after month present them to the public through that magazine.&#x201D;</note> and was then full of a project that I should begin publishing in detail by that channel, a work I was speaking about last summer, a kind of picture-gallery of literary great men, arranged under their proper classes, and bedizened with all the ornaments that my poor pallet could afford them. I have sent him to inquire more minutely; and it seems likely the thing will take effect: I am to commence with Schiller. Heaven grant I were commenced! Idle I am the most miserable wretch on the face of the Earth, and my present circumstances make it difficult to work as I should. I am going to be in a dreadful <hi rend="italic">toss</hi>, if the business proceed; yet I wish it may. Meantime I am reading Grubers Wieland:<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Johann Gottfried Gruber (<date when="1774-00-00">1774</date>&#x2013;<date when="1851-00-00">1851</date>), <hi rend="italic">Christoph Martin Wieland</hi> (Leipzig and Altenburg, <date when="1815-00-00">1815</date>).</note> he is about equal to <hi rend="italic">Doctor Joralic</hi><note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-02/lt-18230228-JBW-TC-01">JBW to TC, <date when="1823-02-28">28 Feb.</date></ref></note> our worthy friend; a more learned man, but at bottom another of the same.&#x2014;</p>
<p>Now do you not see the Ides of March are come and gone, and the weather is getting very tolerable. Why do <hi rend="italic">you</hi> not come then? I beg of you to set out without loss of time; and let me see your sweet face and hear your wicked tongue again. We really should see one another oftener: in a year or so, I shall be gone Heaven known whither; you will be wedded to some gallant &#x2019;Squire; and &#x201C;we shall go on our ways and see each other no more.&#x201D; <foreign><hi rend="italic">Deus avertat</hi></foreign> [God prevent it]!&#x2014;</p>

<salute>My dear Alick,</salute>
<p>I have just perused your most welcome letter; and having, by what is rather a rare chance with me, a moderate quantity of leisure at command, I am going to give you all my news in detail. They will amuse you some evening when you come in wearied from ploughing and sowing.</p>
<p>Jack&#x2019;s account of my health, I assure you, was rather over than undercharged; he gave you the <hi rend="italic">whole truth</hi>, and that in a somewhat darker colouring than I should have given it. Certainly I was driven aslant a little from my customary path, and felt uncomfortably at times; but I had the best excuse for doing so, and you will rejoice to learn that with the cause the effect also has ceased. There never was such weather in my time as these six weeks about newyeardsay [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>]; you could not go out of doors without getting your fingers frostbitten and your face cracked by the pinching blast; your feet too were kept in continual dampness by the snow, and you momently ran the risk of rushing down to the level of the pavement, and so breaking your bones or at least sustaining the laughter of all the by-standers. It was quite dispiriting to feel all this; and to look about you and see all the Earth as it were wrapt up in its winding-sheet and dead and gone did not mend the matter. Besides I scarcely got a night&#x2019;s good sleep in the week, often instead of rest my bed afforded the most copious supply of pitiful and tormenting disquietudes. If I had possessed unlimited power I would have brought on the spring two months sooner, and perhaps strung all the milliners<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A reference to the noisy mantua makers mentioned in <sic>the</sic> <ref target="volume-02/lt-18230104-TC-AC-01"><sic>previous letter</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1823-01-04">4 Jan. 1823</date></corr></ref> to Alexander.</note> of the Universe upon a spit and hung them up like as many herrings to dry in the chimney corner; but no such faculties were given me, and it was better not. If one had nothing to suffer and to vanquish, where would be the merit of existence? &#x201C;Time and hours wear out the roughest day.&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Macbeth</hi>, I, iii.</note> I struggled thro&#x2019; as I best could, and here I sit delivered from all these tortures. The atmosphere has cleared up, I see the bright Fife hills out of the window, and feel the kindly breath of the west, whenever I sally forth; the needlewomen (whom the <hi rend="italic">old one</hi> is sure to get yet for the plagues they cost me) the small needlewomen are also gone to rest&#x2014;I have <pb id="pg-02-302" n="02:302"/>not heard their footsteps for a fortnight. Under all these advantages, how can I help recovering? I am better than I have been for many years: I get off daily with a certain constant portion of sufferable pain, and keep up my heart with diligent exertions and the hope of being quite delivered in due season. I have even <hi rend="italic">al</hi>most given up the use of drugs entirely: I trust the ensuing summer will recover me quite, and then this bitterest season of my earthly pilgrimage will make me satisfied with any appointment which it may please Providence to unite with health of body and assign me. There is no fear whatever. You know how much of the Cat I have in me; how much I resemble that noble animal in quickness of movement and fierceness of temper: it ought to strike you likewise that we cats have all <hi rend="italic">nine lives</hi>: I have eight of mine beforehand yet, and so I fear nothing.</p>
<p>You are very nobly employed, my dear Alick, in studying to improve your character and store your mind with knowledge an<supplied>[d]</supplied> every useful accomplishment. It will be <supplied>[a]</supplied> pity if your faculties have not fair play: there is in you a sharpness of judgement a hard sarcastic sagacity, a general clearness of view, united with tastes for what is pure and worthy of a man, that I expect no little of. Do not regret too much that you want time for improving yourself by Books. Wisdom is not gathered by reading alone, but infinitely more by <hi rend="italic">reflection</hi>. Study to investigate every problem of life and manners that comes within your reach, to gather knowledge from books and observation &#x26; every other source, and to apply it all to the <hi rend="italic">practical business of life</hi>. You will yet be an honourable, well-informed, thoroughgoing, upright, clever, independent fellow, I have no grain of doubt; and on Earth there is nothing so desirable for a son of Adam, nothing that deserves to be named along with it. I often think of our hard and laborious but hearty upbringing under our parental roof, and I feel a pride in reflecting how mind can conquer matter, how the true spirit of virtue and manly worth can illuminate the humblest destiny, and bring forth from the smoky walls of a cottage men that are void of <hi rend="italic">fear</hi> and of <hi rend="italic">reproach</hi>, men that are more to be prized in the eye of reason than most that stand on the high places of the Earth. Often when I see the Bullers straining in strenuous idleness<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Strenua nos exercet inertia</hi></foreign>&#x201D; (Horace, <hi rend="italic">Epistles</hi>, I, xi, 28).</note> to compass their tinselly enjoyments, conversant alone with the most shallow feelings, aiming at little higher than dining or being dined,&#x2014;when I see their sons bred up in ignorance of all that is truly majestic in human nature, envying those that are richer, paying tribute to those that are <pb id="pg-02-303" n="02:303"/>more powerful, looking forward only to balls and f&#xEA;tes and outward shews, the mere chaff of existence, which tho&#x2019; served up in gilded covers is chaff not the less,&#x2014;I often think of my brother in his coarse substantial apparel, grasping the hilts of his plough with sinewy arms upon the hill side&#x2014;going forth upon a <hi rend="italic">real</hi> object, beneath the clear canopy of Heaven, with a true man&#x2019;s-heart in his bosom, alive to all the genuine feelings of nature, discharging his part with calm fidelity, hurting or hating no man, and never dreaming that he should blanch or truckle before any creature that treads upon God&#x2019;s Earth! I think of this, and I am proud of it: I feel that independently of all natural considerations, we should rejoice that we are our Father&#x2019;s sons, not those of some squirelet or Lording, that might have given us money, but could not give us that which money will not buy. I beg of you to be contented, my brave boy; for things will all turn out as we would have them yet. For your earthly fortunes take not too much thought, we shall in time be able to help one another at a pinch, and shame befall the head of us that hesitates to do it! I had much, much more to say, but it must not be just now. Write to me largely. <closer><salute>I am ever Your&#x2019;s</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>Well! my beloved Cousin,</salute> here I am once more at the bottom of the pit of dullness, hemmed in all round, straining my eyeballs, and stretching my neck to no purpose.</p>
<p>Was ever starling in a more desperate plight? But I <hi rend="italic">will &#x201C;get out&#x201D;</hi>&#x2014;by the wife of Job, I <hi rend="italic">will</hi>!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Laurence Sterne, <hi rend="italic">Sentimental Journey</hi> (London, <date when="1775-00-00">1775</date>), II, 24. Carlyle introduces the starling into <hi rend="italic">Frederick the Great</hi>, Book XI, chap. i, and in his letter to David Aitken of <date when="1840-09-08">8 Sept. 1840</date> he writes: &#x201C;I am sick, the weather is cold; like Sterne&#x2019;s Starling, one has to say mournfully, &#x2018;I can&#x2019;t get out!&#x2019;&#x201D;</note> Here is no sojourn for me! I must dwell in the open world, live aamid life; but <hi rend="italic">here</hi> is no life, no motion, no variety. It is the dim<supplied>[m]</supplied>est, deadest spot (I verily believe) in the Creator&#x2019;s universe: to look round in it, one might imagine that time had made a stand: the shopkeepers are to be seen standing at the doors of their shops, in the very same postures in which they have stood there ever since I was born; &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">The thing that hath been is that also which shall be</hi>&#x201D;;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Eccles. 1:9.</note> every thing is <hi rend="italic">the same</hi>, every thing is stupid; the very <pb id="pg-02-304" n="02:304"/>air one breathes is impregnated with stupidity. Alas my native place! the Goddess of dullness has strewed it with all her poppies!</p>
<p>But it is my native place still! and after all there is much in it that I love. I love the bleaching-green, where I used to caper, and roll, and tumble, and make gowan necklaces, and chains of dandelion stalks, in the days of my &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">wee existence</hi>&#x201D;; and the schoolhouse where I carried away prizes, and signalized myself not more for the quickness of my parts, than for the valour of my arm, above all the boys of the community; and the mill-dam too where I performed feats of agility which it was easier to extol than to imitate, and which gained me at the time the reputation of a <foreign>sticket callant (un gar&#x26;ccedil;on assassin&#xE9;</foreign>)<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi>, I, 56, 73. Carlyle writes: &#x201C;In all things she strove to &#x2018;be a Boy&#x2019; in education; and yet by natural guidance never ceased to be the prettiest and gracefullest of little girls.&#x201D; &#x201C;Stickit&#x201D; means &#x201C;bungled&#x201D; or &#x201C;failed&#x201D; or &#x201C;forced to give up&#x201D; (cf. the expression &#x201C;a stickit minister&#x201D;).

Some of the history of the farm is indicated in a letter of <date when="1833-06-18">18 June 1833</date> from the Welsh family lawyer, Alexander Donaldson of Haddington, to Jane: &#x201C;I find, on looking into my repositories, that I have the title deeds of your property, and an inventory, of which the prefixed is a copy.

I do not think that I had this tradition from you, but from Mr. Carlyle.&#x201D; Dr. Welsh had bought the farm from his father and had left it to Jane, who made it over in life-rent to her mother.

Jane spells the name with a <hi rend="italic">k</hi> here, but later she and Carlyle almost consistently prefer the <hi rend="italic">h</hi>.</note> could not stand it. Next morning he took himself away, leaving us more impressed with the idea of his imbecillity than ever. In a day or two after his return to town, there came a huge parcel from him, containing a letter for Mother, expressed with a still greater command of absurdity than any of the preceding ones, and a quantity of music for me (<foreign><hi rend="italic">pour parenth&#xE8;se</hi></foreign> [by the way], I shall send you a sheet of it, having another copy of &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Home sweet home</hi>&#x201D;<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not published until <date when="1823-00-00">1823</date> (from the operetta <hi rend="italic">Clari, or The Maid of Milan</hi>) by John Howard Payne (<date when="1791-00-00">1791</date>&#x2013;<date when="1852-00-00">1852</date>).

Ass! I change my mind indeed! and for him! Upon my word, to be an imb&#xE9;cille as he is, he has a monstrous stock of modest assurance!

He has since written to Mother begging of her to deprecate my displeasure&#x2014;there the transaction rests and peace be with it!</p>

<p>Talking of nerves, we got a horrible fright in church on Saturday. An old Lady dropt down in the adjoining seat, and was carried out as dead. Mother screamed out &#x2018;Oh&#x2019; so stoutly, that Mr. Gordon was obliged to stop in his prayer, and sit down: She seems destined to make a distinguished figure in all church hub-bubs.

<p>My Mother has quite got rid of her cold. It was as bad as need be after we came home.

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>It appears that Farries is here to-day, and as I am got down from India-street in time for writing you a few words, I cannot omit this opportunity of doing so. We have not got a syllable of intelligence from Mainhill; but this we impute solely to Geordie&#x2019;s<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Farries of Stonylee, the carrier.</note> having set out without giving you proper warning, and we force ourselves to believe that you are all in your usual health and circumstances,&#x2014;a blessing which it has pleased Providence long to continue with us, and which we shall never prize sufficiently till it is taken away. For you, My dear Mother, we are seldom without anxieties; your infirm state and many cares but too well justify them. I can only entreat you again more earnestly than ever to take every possible care of yourself&#x2014;to watch over your health as the greatest treasure to all your children, and to none more than me. I still hope to find you whole and well when we meet, and to have our tea and smoke and small talk together <hi rend="italic">down the house</hi>, many many happy times, as heretofore. There are no moments when I can forget all my cares, as in these: I seem to lose twenty of my years, when we are chatting together, and to be a happy thoughtless urchin of a boy once more. Amid all my sorrows (of which I often think I have had my share first and last), there is nothing which has yielded me so constant a gratification as your affection and welfare, <pb id="pg-02-308" n="02:308"/>nothing that I ought to <supplied>[be]</supplied> so thankful for enjoying,&#x2014;or that I should pray more earnestly for having still vouchsafed to me.</p>
<p>There is nothing in this sort of prating I am going on with; but is about as good as any thing I have got to tell you. When I have said that Jack and I are still in our common state of health and going forward with our customary occupations, I have as good as finished my tale. There is no change in our individual conditions, and the changes which pass in the world around us are things in which we have little part or lot, and so take little note of. Life to both of us is still very very much <hi rend="italic">in prospect</hi>: we are not yet what we hope to be. Jack is going to become a large gawsie broad-faced Practicer of Physic&#x2014;to ride his horse in time, and gives aloes by rule, and make money and be a large man; while I&#x2014;in spite of all my dyspepsias and nervousness, and hypochondrias&#x2014;am still bent on being a very meritorious sort of character&#x2014;rather noted in the world of letters, if it so please Providence&#x2014;and useful, I hope, whithersoever I go, in <hi rend="italic">the good old cause</hi>, for which I beg you to believe that I cordially agree with you in feeling my chief interest, however we may differ in our modes of expressing it. For attaining this mighty object, I have need of many things&#x2014;which I fear I shall never get; but if my health were once sound again, I should feel such an unextinguishable diligence within me that my own exertions might supply almost every want. This greatest of blessings is yet but partially restored to me: however I do verily believe that it is coming back by degrees&#x2014;so I live as patiently as I can and fear nothing.</p>
<p>The next summer I hope will do great things for me&#x2014;almost set me on my feet again. The Bullers <hi rend="italic">are</hi> going to the country, and if so I go with them. They have not yet fixed on the place: but they have <hi rend="italic">almost</hi> determined in favour of North Berwick a place about thirty miles east of this&#x2014;in the neighbourhood of which they talk about taking a lease of a house belonging to Sir Hugh Dalrymple.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sir Hew Whitefoord Dalrymple (<date when="1750-00-00">1750</date>&#x2013;<date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>). He had a military career and became a general.</note> I will get the poney from home, and ride about, and write and talk and carry on my duties, and grow as whole as a trout. The air and the sun have almost as much effect on me, as if I were a cabbage-plant, and not a living man. I hope one day to be independent of their influence.</p>
<p>But I am at the bottom of my sheet, and must conclude this palaver. There are many debts lying against me to my worthy correspondents at Mainhill&#x2014;which lie heavy on my conscience and must in due time be discharged. I beg you will try to keep the creatures quiet in the <pb id="pg-02-309" n="02:309"/>meanwhile, and advise them to send me another file of Epistle&#x2019;s. Is Jane going on to rhyme? I shewed her &#x201C;meanest of the letter kind&#x201D; to several judges, and they declared she must be a very singular <hi rend="italic">crow</hi>&#x2014; This is a real truth.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A reference to the letter in verse by Carlyle&#x2019;s little sister Jane in which the phrase &#x201C;Meanest of the letter kind&#x201D; occurs. The whole poem, still extant in MS, is in <hi rend="italic">LL</hi>, II, 352&#x2013;53, and is dated <date when="1823-02-15">15 Feb.</date> A. Carlyle says that Carlyle sent a copy of the poem to Jane Welsh, commenting, &#x201C;As you are curious in oddities, this may amuse you for a moment. The author is a little black-eyed creature about nine years of age, scarce bigger I think than a good quartern loaf. Her amanuensis [Mary Carlyle] is nearly two years older. This is &#x2018;lisping in numbers&#x2019; with a vengeance.&#x201D; Jane Carlyle had black hair as well as black eyes and was called &#x201C;Crow&#x201D; or &#x201C;Craw Jean&#x201D; by members of the family.</note> You must give my love to my Father and all the rest <hi rend="italic">conjunctly and severally</hi>. Tell Sandy and my Father to write next time, if they can snatch as many moments from the sowing. Write to me yourself the very first spare hour you have. Good night, My dear Mother&#x2014;it is dark, and I must cease. <closer><salute>I am ever your&#x2019;s</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Friend</salute>
<p>I have been longer in writing than usual and this time I cannot plead either excessive occupation or impertinent interruptions&#x2014; But I have not patience to do anything when my mind is not at rest, and for the last week it has been in a horrible hubbub&#x2014;</p>
<p>These nonsensical people with their <foreign><hi rend="italic">Heirathsgedanken</hi></foreign> [thoughts of marriage] and <foreign><hi rend="italic">Heirathsvorschlagen</hi></foreign> [proposals of marriage] will assuredly drive me mad.

Isa. 40:17]. Blessed is He who has not made me a woman, because a woman is not obligated to observe the ceremonial laws.

<dateline><place>3. Moray-street</place>, Wednesday-night [<date when="1823-03-26">26 March 1823</date>].</dateline>
<salute>My dear Friend,</salute>
<p>You have not done a more beneficial action for a long time than writing to me last monday. I had already spent too much of the preceding week in the delightful exercise of <hi rend="italic">that Christian virtue</hi>, for which both of us are so remarkable; I had wearied myself in the region of conjecture, and found little comfort within its ample domains. On the evening in question, I had just brought out my papers, and was sitting down to begin that weary life of Schiller&#x2014;in the most vinegar humour that a man could well be in&#x2014;with a head empty of ideas, and a heart oppressed by as many chagrins as might have served a dozen hearts&#x2014;when her Serene Lowness, the Dowager Wilkie,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >His landlady.</note> came gliding in, with&#x2014;&#x201C;a parcel Sir!&#x201D; I felt myself grow half a hundredweight lighter whenever I saw it. Your letter wrought upon me as if by art magic: <pb id="pg-02-313" n="02:313"/>I was another man when I had read it. To use a Slawkenburgian figure,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For Slawkenbergius, who wrote an authoritative Latin book on noses, see <hi rend="italic">Tristram Shandy</hi>, Book III, chap. xxxviii.</note> it was as if you had lit up a blazing fire in the dark damp haunted chamber of some old ruined Gothic pile, scattering the ghosts and spectres into the shades of Erebus, and tinging the grim walls once more with the colours of jovial life and warm substantial cheer. I declared within myself that you were the very best of all the daughters of Eve: I proceeded to my work as if I had grown young again.&#x2014; It is pity that this magical force will not always continue; pity that the <hi rend="italic">fire</hi> at last goes out, and leaves the poor mind&#x2019;s chamber cold and dark, and haunted by the Devil as before! Yet after all, we should be thankful for our mercies: there are parts of life too fine to be the general material of it; and virtue itself, they say, is nothing but the victory, often fiercely struggled for, of free-will over fate. Let it be so.</p>
<p>I know not how I felt when I read of these marryings and givings in marriage. It seems to me as if our destinies were yet long to be intermingled, as if we were yet to walk side by side thro&#x2019; many bright scenes, to assist each other in many a noble purpose; and oh! what a pitiful conclusion to all this would a vulgar wedding make! It is true they manage it otherwise in the common world: there the great object of a young woman&#x2019;s existence is to get a rich husband, and a fine house, and give dinners; just as it is the great object of ravens to find carrion, or of pawn brokers to amass a <hi rend="italic">plum</hi>;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Slang for &#xa3; 100,000 sterling.</note> and the sooner they attain their respective destinations it is surely the better. But if each creature ought to follow the good its nature aims at, then <hi rend="italic">you</hi> are right to take another path&#x2014;right to press forward towards the golden summit of mental eminence, and to shrink at no sacrifice which you believe that elevation will repay you for. The time <hi rend="italic">will</hi> come indeed, when you must &#x201C;fall in love&#x201D; and be wedded as others have been; it is the general law, and must be fulfilled: but I fear not that I shall ever have the pain of seeing your happiness entrusted to one unworthy however desirous of the charge, or the high ambitions of your youth given up for any thing less sacred than the feelings of the heart, if these unhappily should come to oppose them. I say <hi rend="italic">unhappily</hi>; for the love of Knowledge is a passion which, once in possession of the mind, can hardly ever be extinguished; it is noble in its nature too, and like other noble passions elevates itself into a kindred with all the virtues of the character: if stinted, &#x26; still more if checked, in its gratification, it leaves a painful hankering behind it which is inconsistent with true <pb id="pg-02-314" n="02:314"/>peace of mind, and often, I imagine, with the free exercise of the moral faculties. In the mean time, therefore, you must just continue on your way. If I had my will you should not be married till&#x2014;not till a considerable period after this. Literary women have many things to suffer, but they have likewise something to enjoy. I confess it appears to me more enviable to be a sister of Madame de Stael&#x2019;s for half a year, than &#x201C;to suckle fools and chronicle small beer&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Othello</hi>, II, i.</note> for half a century.</p>
<p>But I must cease to preach, for the text is plain without a commentary, and I have other things to do. You are right to keep by Gibbon, since you have begun it: there is no other tolerable history of those times and nations, within the reach of such readers as we are; it is a kind of bridge that connects the antique with the modern ages. And how gorgeously does it swing across the gloomy and tumultuous chasm of those barbarous centuries! Gibbon is a man whom one never forgets&#x2014;unless oneself deserving to be forgotten; the perusal of his work forms an epoch in the history of one&#x2019;s mind. I know you will admire Gibbon, yet I do not expect or wish that you should love him. He has but a coarse and vulgar heart, with all his keen logic and glowing imagination and lordly irony: he worships power and splendour; and suffering virtue, the most heroic devotedness if unsuccessful, unarrayed in the pomp and circumstance of outward glory, has little of his sympathy. To the Christians he is frequently very unfair: if he had lived now, he would have written differently on those points. I would not have you love him; I am sure you will not. Have you any notion what an <hi rend="italic">ugly</hi> thief he was? Jack brought down his <hi rend="italic">life</hi><note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Gibbon&#x2019;s autobiography in <hi rend="italic">Miscellaneous Works of Edward Gibbon, Esquire, With Memoirs of His Life and Writings, Composed by Himself</hi>, ed. Lord Sheffield, 2 vols. (<date when="1796-00-00">1796</date>).</note> to-day, and it has a profile of his whole person&#x2014; Alas for Mlle. Curchod! Alas for her daughter Wilhelmina Necker who wished to marry him, when she was thirteen&#x2014;not out of love to him but to her Mother!<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In the late spring of <date when="1757-00-00">1757</date> Gibbon met and fell in love with Mlle Suzanne Curchot, daughter of the pastor of Crassier, and the affair lasted until <date when="1763-00-00">1763</date>. Eventually Mlle Curchot married Jacques Necker, the famous French financier. Born of this marriage was Anne Louise Germaine, who became Mme de Sta&#xEB;l. Carlyle seems to have adopted Jane&#x2019;s whim of calling her, incorrectly, Wilhelmina. See Carlyle&#x2019;s note in <hi rend="italic">Montaigne and Other Essays</hi>, pp. 54&#x2013;55.</note> I would have sent you this <hi rend="italic">Life</hi>, but it is a large quarto and I knew not if you would receive it patiently. Should you wish it, write to me to-morrow and I will send it out. There is some amusement in it, but you will relish it more, when you know more fully and think more highly of the studied labours of the mind which it shews you in deshabille.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-02-315" n="02:315"/>I am also glad that you like my thrice illustrious Goethe, and can<hi rend="italic">not</hi> understand him. What expounding and reading and chit-chatting we shall have together when you come! I beg only that you do not disappoint me again. At first I was rather disconcerted at this postponement: I had calculated on your arrival as a perfect certainty; nay it was only on Monday, that I got into to [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] the most wonderful flurry at what I conceived to be the actual sight of you! The small divine who was with me on Prince-street might as well have spoken to the winds, I could answer his prosing statements but by monosyllables which I daresay had no connection oftener than once with the &#x201C;subject matter of his discourse&#x201D;: the lady before us seemed to have your very dress and form and gait, and I heard not what he said.&#x2014; Alas! we overtook this beatific vision, and she had a nose about the length of a moderate dibble! So abrupt is often the transition from the height of poetry to the depth of prose.</p>
<p>On second thoughts, however, I am satisfied. By the time you arrive, I shall have finished Schiller; I shall see more of you, and be more at leisure to see you. It will be absolutely cruel, if you do not come about the very beginning of the month. We could be so happy, I often think, wandering at large beneath these clear spring skies, talking over all our plans and hopes, arguing or discussing&#x2014;or doing nothing at all beside each other! You <hi rend="italic">must</hi> come in less than a fortnight. You will write to me just once before that time, and the next message will be that &#x201C;Miss Welsh condescends to allow the dyspeptical Philosopher to behold the light of her countenance to-morrow morning about ten.&#x201D; Said Philosopher will be punctual to the hour, and promises to conduct himself with great submissiveness and propriety. If you have any heart&#x2014;which I sometimes do believe is the case, in spite of all your sinful indifference and manifold railleries&#x2014;you will think of this and do it. I look forward to <date when="1823-04-00">April</date> as to a <hi rend="italic">white month</hi>.</p>
<p>You do not say a word about <hi rend="italic">composition</hi> this time&#x2014;because I suppose you have had other things to mind. We will settle all that when we meet. Bring G&#xF6;tz with you also, and we will decipher it, tho&#x2019; it were as dark as the <hi rend="italic">linen books</hi>. I like you better for dismissing that ancient sinner Giovan Boccaccio: he is a wicked knave with all his talents, and intellectual pleasure may be dearly purchased at such a risk. You are yourself throughout, my own noble Jane in every thing.&#x2014; I rejoice too that you have done with the <hi rend="italic">genius</hi>: those geniuses are the most arrant littleworths in nature. Your Irish tapeman I shall be bound is worth ten of him. Poor little hopper; and praiseworthy Shandy to spy him out!</p>
<p><pb id="pg-02-316" n="02:316"/>Now have I not tired you enough for once? There is poor Schiller lying too, at whom I must have a hit or two before I sleep. It will be an invaluable life this of Schillers, were it once completed: so splendid and profound and full of <hi rend="italic">unction</hi>&#x2014; Oh! I could beat my brains out, when I think what a miserable pithless ninny I am! Would it were in my power either to write like a man or honestly to give up the attempt for ever. Chained to the earth by native gravitation and a thousand wretched fetters, I am miserable unless I be soaring in the empyrean; and thus between the lofty will &#x26; the powerless deed, I have no peace, no peace. Sometimes I could almost run distracted; my wearied soul seems as if it were hunted round within its narrow enclosure by a whole legion of the dogs of Tartarus, which sleep not, night or day. In fact I am never happy except when <hi rend="italic">full</hi> of business, and <hi rend="italic">nothing more</hi>. The secret of all is &#x201C;I have no genius,&#x201D; and like Andrew Irving&#x2019;s horse, I <hi rend="italic">have</hi> &#x201C;a <foreign><hi rend="italic">dibbil</hi></foreign> of a temper.&#x201D; We must just submit!</p>
<p>Boyd<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Boyd of the publishing house Oliver and Boyd.</note> the <foreign>pursy</foreign> Bookseller wishes me to translate Goethe&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister</hi>, which I have told him is very clever. It will not be determined for some weeks&#x2014;not till I see where I am to be and how, during summer. Come, my dear Jane, and let us consider all these matters! Come! Come! I am vehemently longing to see you.&#x2014; Write at any rate when your Mother has finished Delphine&#x2014;sooner if you want Gibbon. My &#x201C;Amplification&#x201D; greets you most respectfully. My best compliments to your Mother, and say I am much of her mind in the affair.&#x2014;<closer><salute>Yours, <foreign><hi rend="italic">mia cara, per sempre</hi></foreign> [my dear one, forever.]</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dearest Cousin</salute>
<p>I have commenced two letters for you during the last two weeks, and each time I have been interrupted by that Ass of Asses John Wilkie&#x2014; To day I am safe till the church comes out&#x2014; Was there ever <pb id="pg-02-317" n="02:317"/>anything more provoking? we are to have no war after all;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Canning had made a speech warning France of the danger of war with Great Britain if France interfered in Spanish internal affairs; but when France invaded Spain, in <date when="1823-03-00">March 1823</date>, he did nothing.</note> our travellers on the Continent will be exposed to no inconveniences and so&#x2014;well! no matter! it is better to keep company with Schiller and de Sta&#xEB;l for one half year, than to &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">suckle fools and chronicle beer</hi>&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Othello</hi>, II, i. She is thinking of Benjamin Bell.</note> for half a century&#x2014;I am going to forget him immediately. I could have done so long ago, but for one little action, that has made a strange impression on my senses&#x2014; My spur required to be shifted from my left foot to my right; and you cannot think with what inimitable grace that small man&#x9c;uvre was accomplished&#x2014;whenever his idea occurs to me, I fancy him with one knee on the earth&#x2014;his horse&#x2019;s bridle flung across his arm&#x2014;his hands employed in fastening the spur&#x2014;and his eloquent eyes fixed&#x2014;assuredly <hi rend="italic">not</hi> on what he was doing&#x2014; Dear Bess is it not very extraordinary that a philosopher as I am, or pretend to be, should be so taken with an attitude? However I <hi rend="italic">will</hi> forget him&#x2014;hitherto I have been twice as constant as Penelope&#x2014; <hi rend="italic">She</hi> was encouraged by the assurance that as soon as Ulysses <hi rend="italic">came</hi>, her troubles were at an end&#x2014;but <hi rend="italic">I</hi> have no such comfortable certainty&#x2014;.</p>
<p>Really there is nothing at all amusing in one&#x2019;s mode of existence here. A tea-party, a quarrel, or a <hi rend="italic">report</hi> of a marriage now and then, are the only excitements this precious little Borough affords&#x2014; However I battle away with Time pretty successfully&#x2014;my lessons employ the greater part of the day, and a little trifling with the &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">professional Callers</hi>&#x201D; or a game at chess or battle-door with our <hi rend="italic">constant</hi> man of physic D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Fyffe, consumes the rest&#x2014; Often at the end of the week my spirits and my industry begin to flag&#x2014;but then comes one of M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle&#x2019;s brilliant letters that inspires me with new resolution, and brightens all my hopes and prospects with the golden hues of his own imagination&#x2014; He is a very Ph<supplied>[o]</supplied>enix of a Friend!&#x2014; Sometimes too Providence prepares me a little extra entertainment&#x2014;for instance: about a month ago&#x2014;in one of the dirtiest darkest lanes in a most untidy part of the town&#x2014;I found&#x2014;you could never guess what! I actually found <hi rend="italic">a Genius</hi>! the said Genius is a beggar-boy about fifteen years of age&#x2014;he lives with his Mother (an ugly old sinner) in a sort of cell about four feet square&#x2014; Never had Genius a more unpromising abode! a palsied table, a one legged stool, the wreck of a bed, and a sort of wooden-press are all the articles of furniture it contains&#x2014; But in spite <pb id="pg-02-318" n="02:318"/>of its abject poverty the place has a look of comfort, I may almost say, of <hi rend="italic">taste</hi>&#x2014; Its black mud walls are plastered over with heads, maps, landscapes and caricatures&#x2014;a neat little model of a man of war is mounted on brackets above the chimney, and the table is oppressed with books so smoked &#x26; so tattered! they might to all appearance date their antiquity from Noah&#x2019;s Ark&#x2014; All the drawings and the Man of war are the boy<supplied>[&#x2019;s]</supplied> own work, and the most of his time, in spite of the obstacles of poverty and ignorance, is devoted to the cultivation of taste far superior to his state &#x26; education&#x2014;</p>
<p>My ideas of talent are so associated with every thing great and noble, that while I admired the boy&#x2019;s ardour and ambition, it never once occur<supplied>[r]</supplied>ed to me, a Genius might possibly be a knave&#x2014;and so I spent my leisure time for one whole fortnight in laying plans for his improvement in the arts, and anticipating the splendid career of successful enterprise that lay before him&#x2014;but about the end of that time I began to suspect my subject might disappoint my lofty expectations&#x2014;he discovered a mortal aversion to all kinds of vulgar labour&#x2014;that is genius-like&#x2014;he had never undergone the operation of baptism&#x2014;that was quite romantic&#x2014;but there were other points of his character and history which I could not easily away with&#x2014;he is greedy, cunning, and ungrateful&#x2014;this disgusted me&#x2014;and when I found no power on earth could prevail with him to refrain from lying or to wash his face I lost all patience&#x2014; My plans had given him so much <foreign><hi rend="italic">eclat</hi></foreign> that <hi rend="italic">my</hi> patronage was no longer necessary and so I left the <hi rend="italic">patient</hi> in the hands of his new admirers&#x2014; The Genius was suc<supplied>[c]</supplied>eeded in my affection by an Irish pack-man with a broken back&#x2014;eight years old and a few inches high&#x2014;a calm, correct decided character&#x2014;the very reverse of the artist&#x2014; he hops about with a cru<supplied>[t]</supplied>ch under one arm and a basket on the other; and with his profits on tape and chapel needles<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ritchie gives a lengthy note on the needles, which are &#x201C;Whitechapel needles.&#x201D; He cites various instances of the use of the term, including that in Dickens&#x2019; <hi rend="italic">A Christmas Carol</hi>: &#x201C;For the sharpest needle, best Whitechapel, warranted not to cut in the eye, was not sharper than Scrooge.&#x201D;</note> helps to maintain three sisters younger than himself</p>

<salute>My dear Friend</salute>
<p>I am threatened with an inundation of visitors for the rest of the week, and supposing you will like a short letter better than none, I write today tho&#x2019; I have very little time to spare&#x2014;my whole morning has been worried with a pest of a dress-maker, ryhming [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] over her vocabularly of fashion, and pinning, fiddling and experimenting on my unfortunate person, till I felt a strong temptation to vent my patience in a box on her ear&#x2014; I shall not get my head cleared of the science of gown-making for a month to come, and what is worse I fear I shall not get the gowns much sooner&#x2014;and, it seems, I cannot <hi rend="italic">appear</hi> without them&#x2014; Our visit to town has not been talked of for the last week&#x2014; I <pb id="pg-02-320" n="02:320"/>am quite out of humour about it, and resolved I will not mention the subject to my Mother again, until she knows her own mind&#x2014; However be patient! we have been much longer without meeting than we are likely to be&#x2014;</p>
<p>I do think we will <hi rend="italic">never never quarrel more</hi>. I could not contrive to exist without the support our intercourse affords me&#x2014; In my most dispirited moods your letters revive my ardour, strengthen my resolution and colour all my prospects with the golden hues of hope&#x2014; I shall never find another who will be so much my friend, and whose friendship will so powerfully influence my character and destiny&#x2014; I was trying to write an essay on Friendship&#x2014;in honour of our relation&#x2014;when I had squeezed out <hi rend="italic">a page</hi> with great mental agony the Devil tempted me to look a<supplied>[t]</supplied> Cicero&#x2019;s de Amicitia just to see how the subject should be managed. I got interested in it, and read it through&#x2014;the consequence was obvious&#x2014;my mind was so filled with Cicero&#x2019;s sentiments it had no room for any of my own&#x2014; it is a pity the poor essay did not come through&#x2014;from the manner in which I was going to work it must have proved a most extraordinary performance&#x2014;</p>
<p>I have finished G&#xF6;<supplied>[t]</supplied>z<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Goethe&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">G&#xF6;tz von Berlichingen</hi>.</note> at last but there are still a great many passages I cannot make out&#x2014; I must read the whole volume to you when I have an opportunity&#x2014; Egmont <note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Goethe&#x2019;s verse drama (<date when="1788-00-00">1788</date>).</note> in particular I wish to understand thoroughly, as I should like a translation of it for my album&#x2014; G&#xF6;ethe does not make me cry like Schiller, but I like him abundantly nevertheless&#x2014; I am busy with the fourth volume of Gibbon and Machiavelli&#x2019;s discourses on Livy. He is the only Italian that has interested me&#x2014; They have sent me other two volumes of Las Cases.

<salute>My dear Father,</salute>
<p>I was just sitting down to my work this morning, when your letter a few minutes ago was handed in to me. I lay aside my author-craft, and willingly betake me to another sort of writing. The sight of a letter from you is always among the welcomest: it transports me back to friends and home, and scenes of humble peace and freedom&#x2014;scenes which, tho&#x2019; chequered with inquietude as all our life is, one still looks towards with a peculiar pleasure.</p>
<p>I feel thankful to learn that you are still in moderate health, having little to complain of except the weariness of increasing years, and being supported under the feeling of this by such comforts as it has been your care in life to lay up. To all men journeying thro&#x2019; the wilderness of the world,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. first line of <hi rend="italic">Pilgrim&#x2019;s Progress</hi>.</note> religion is an inexhaustible spring of nourishment and consolation; the thorns and flinty places of our path become soft <pb id="pg-02-322" n="02:322"/>when we view them as leading to an Everlasting City, where sorrow and sin shall be alike excluded. To a religious man and to a mere worldling the frailties of age speak in very different tones: to the last they are the judgement voice that warns him to an awful reckoning, a dark and dreary change; to the first they are as the kind assurances of a father, that a place of rest is made ready, where the weary shall find refreshment after all their toils. Judging from your years and past and present health, I expect that we shall yet be all spared together for a long long season, shall live and see good here below; but it gives me real pleasure to know that you have such approved resources against the worst that can befall. I often think of death, as all reasonable creatures must; but with such prospects there is little in it to be feared. I have many a time felt that without the expectation of it, life would be in its brightest station, a burden too heavy to be borne. But these are topics too serious for this light handling. We are in the hands of an Allmerciful Father: let us live with hope in Him, and try to fill rightly the parts He has assigned us! Here is &#x201C;an anchor of the soul both sure and steadfast&#x201D;;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Heb. 6:19.</note> by this let us abide&#x2014;and vex ourselves with no needless fears.</p>
<p>There is no change whatever in our outward state since Jack and I wrote last time. We are moving about in our several provinces just in the old way. The approach of summer is giving rise to projects for the manner of passing it; but nothing has hitherto been determined for either of us. Jack has frequently been canvassing the various advantages of Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> and Mainhill as places of residence, and seems to have made up his mind for continuing where he is, that he may have more undisturbed possession of his time and faculties, which he is violently inflamed with the desire of consecrating to study. I have tried occasionally to help him with considerations pro or con; but with little success: he is very touchy in the matter of independence of mind, and too apt to see in my counsels only my willingness or unwillingness to have him what he calls &#x201C;a burden on me.&#x201D; The Boy does me wrong in that matter; he should know that I have few things so comfortable to me as the thought that I am able to help him forward into life: but I can well pardon these scruples of his; remembering how I used to be devoured with them myself. On the whole, however, I agree with him that Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> will have many advantages. It is better for books and study&#x2014;better for every thing but health and friendly society. Jack shall decide for himself entirely. It is but a short period that he can devote <pb id="pg-02-323" n="02:323"/>to mental acquirements; and it would be poor thrift to gain a few pounds by cramping the usefulness of a man for life. Jack, poor Jack, I feel convinced is going to make a figure yet: he inherits a good head and an honest heart from his parents; and no bad habit of any kind has perverted these invaluable gifts. His only faults at present are his inexperience, and the very excess of his good qualities. Our only subject of disagreement is the relative importance of worldly comforts and mental wealth. Jack decides as a worthy fellow at <hi rend="italic">twenty</hi> will always decide, that mere external rank and conveniences are <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi>, the dignity of the mind is all in all: I argue as every reasonable man of <hi rend="italic">t</hi><supplied>[<hi rend="italic">w</hi>]</supplied><hi rend="italic">enty-seven</hi>, that this is poetry in part&#x2014;which a few years will mix pretty largely with prose. And there we differ, and chop logic&#x2014;an art for which Jack has been famous from his very cradle. Sometimes I make free to settle him with your finisher &#x201C;thou Natural!&#x201D; But on the whole he is getting more rational, and has picked up a good deal one way and another since he came to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>. His jolly presence has been of no small benefit to myself on many sad occasions. I have often absolutely wondered at the patience with which he has borne my black humours when bad health and disturbances vexed me too much. He is certainly a prime honest &#x201C;Lord Moon&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A nickname given to John because of his round, bland face.</note> with all his faults. I believe the Bullers would give half their kingdom to have such for their son.</p>
<p>Since I began writing, I have got a stupid clout of a letter from Waugh.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Waugh, his Annandale cousin who had studied medicine in Edinburgh. See <ref target="volume-02/lt-18230104-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1823-01-04">4 Jan.</date></ref></note> They are going to sell his Books here, and he wishes me to buy some of them up for him. He is absolutely a born Ass. In place of stirring Earth and sea to get some money raised, he has spent the last month in adjusting points of honour with his Bookseller now out of patience with such work, and appears by this present epistle to be at last <hi rend="italic">almost</hi> fully convinced <hi rend="italic">that</hi> David Brown<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >An Edinburgh bookseller at 6 S. St. Andrew&#x2019;s St.</note> has used him ill! It is certainly a splendid result&#x2014;but it will not <hi rend="italic">pay the piper</hi>, will not save his Library from the talons of the auctioneer! I am really disgusted with such stupidity. I know not well what to do in regard to the books: but one thing I know&#x2014;I have other things to do with my hard earnings than present them on such occasions to such people as he. If I make any purchases, I shall know well <hi rend="italic">how</hi>.&#x2014; But the time and the sheet are alike exhausted. <closer><salute>Give my love to all and sundry at Mainhill; and believe me to be, My dear Father, Your affe<hi rend="italic">cte</hi> Son,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Friend,</salute>
<p>You judged quite correctly in supposing that a short letter or any letter at all would satisfy me more than none. The one you sent me had more delightful things in it than some that I have got of thrice the bulk. You are a very excellent person&#x2014;when you please: it is altogether charming to be your servant in these moods. May heaven bless you for thinking that &#x201C;we shall never never quarrel more&#x201D;! I myself design that we shall quarrel many thousand times, before all is done; each quarrel to last for fifteen minutes at the utmost, then we to kiss and agree and be better friends than ever. Any longer feud I would not for the world. You and I are two originals for certain &#x201C;in our own humble way&#x201D;: it is very kind in Fortune to have brought us together; otherwise, we might have gone on single-handed to the end of time. The day when you finally cast me off I shall regard as the very blackest in my history.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Angry at you&#x201D;! My dear Jane, I was never angry at you in my life, and do believe I never shall be seriously so. I cannot understand what sort of clay the man is made of that could be angry at you: I would have him drummed out of the Earth as an interloper and a counterfeit. My worst feeling towards you is pain at seeing you uncomfortable, and anxiety lest you may spoil your future happiness. Even on this subject I have no serious fears; but there is no end to one&#x2019;s scruples and suspicions. Formerly, I used to feel afflicted at your contemptuousness and want of constancy in your emotions; now I am turned to the other extreme, and begin to dread that you are growing too serious. In fact I think I have noticed in you of late a tendency to contemplative melancholy, and what they call a romantic turn of mind&#x2014;not the romance which milliners experience when they think of becoming actresses or running off with young grocers; but that sickness of noble hearts, that deep and sad feeling of the nothingness of the world, which is apt to arise from too exclusive a pursuit of things high and spiritual, and too great an isolation from the every day interests and enjoyments of life. I fear there <hi rend="italic">is</hi> some truth in this. If so, My dear Jane let me entreat you with the earnest voice of affection to guard against the approaches of this black demon, which has poisoned the existence of so many men of genius, and converted the world which <pb id="pg-02-325" n="02:325"/>they might have enlightened and adorned into a prison-house which they have deformed and disgraced. It is an evil of the first magnitude&#x2014;the want of which almost compensates to the <foreign><hi rend="italic">servum pecus</hi></foreign><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Slavish herd&#x201D; (Horace, <hi rend="italic">Epistles</hi>, I, xix, 19).</note> for all their other wants. Fight against such thoughts, and fly where you cannot conquer. There is no efficient remedy but mingling ourselves as much as possible in the solid living concerns of our fellow creatures: these shadows disappear when we come forth from the cell of our own meditations into the cheerful light of day. You may feel that the people about you are frivolous and shallow and unworthy of your sympathies: no doubt they are so; but still they are our brethren, and it is the inflexible law of nature, that <hi rend="italic">whoever withdraws from them is miserable</hi>.</p>
<p>As to your literary hopes, entertain them confidently! There is to me no better symptom of what is in you than your despair of getting it expressed. Cannot write! My dear Pupil, you have no idea of what a task it is to every one, when it is taken up in that solemn way. Did you never hear of Rousseau lying in his bed and painfully wrenching every syllable of his <hi rend="italic">Nouvelle Heloise</hi> from the obscure complexities of his imagination. He composed every sentence of it, on an average, <hi rend="italic">five times over</hi>; and often when he took up the pen, the whole concern was vanished quite away! John James<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jean Jacques Rousseau.</note> is my only comfort when I sit down to write. I could frequently swear that I am the greatest dunce in creation: the cooking of a paragraph is little better than the labour of the Goldmaker; I sweat and toil and keep tedious vigil, and at last there runs out from the tortured melting-pot an ingot&#x2014;of solid pewter.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A favorite figure of Carlyle&#x2019;s to represent the writing process. Cf. Browning&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">The Ring and the Book</hi>, I, 1&#x2013;32.</note> There is no help but patient diligence, and <hi rend="italic">that will conquer every thing</hi>. Never waver, my own Jane! I shall yet &#x201C;stand a-tiptoe&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Will stand a-tiptoe when this day is named&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Henry</hi> V, IV, iii).</note> at your name. Not write! I declare if I had known nothing of you but your letters, I should have pronounced you to be already an excellent writer. Depend upon it, this is nothing but your taste outgrowing your practice. Had you been born a peer&#x2019;s daughter, and lived among literary men, and seen things to exercise your powers of observation, the world would ere this have been admiring the sagacious humour of your remarks and the graceful vigour of your descriptions. As it is, you have only to begin and to go on: time will make all possible, all easy. Why did you give up that Essay on Friendship? <hi rend="italic">For my sake</hi>, resume <pb id="pg-02-326" n="02:326"/>it and finish it! Never mind how bad, how execrable it may seem, go thro&#x2019; with it. The next will be better, and the next, and the next; you will approach at each trial nearer the Perfection which no one ever reached. If I knew you fairly on the way, I should feel quite easy: your reading is going on as it ought; there wants only that you should write also. Begin this Essay again, if you love me!</p>
<p>Goethe lies waiting for your arrival. You make a right distinction about Goethe: he is a great genius and <hi rend="italic">does not make you cry</hi>. His feelings are various as the hues of Earth and sky, but his intellect is the Sun which illuminates and overrules them all. He does not yield himself to his emotions, but uses them rather as things for his judgement to scrutinize and apply to purpose. I think Goethe the only living model of a great writer. The Germans say there have been <hi rend="italic">three</hi> geniuses in the world since it began&#x2014;Homer, Shakespear and Goethe! This of course is shooting on the wing: but after all abatements, their countryman is a glorious fellow. It is one of my finest day-dreams to see him ere I die.</p>
<p>As you are fond of tears, I have sent you a fresh supply of Schiller. His <hi rend="italic">Kabale und Liebe</hi><note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mannheim, <date when="1782-00-00">1782</date>.</note> will make you cry your fill. That Ferdinand with his <foreign><hi rend="italic">Du Louise und ich und die Liebe</hi></foreign> [Thou, Louise, and I and love]&#x2014;is a fine youth; I liked him well&#x2014;tho&#x2019; his age is some five years less than mine. You will also read Schiller&#x2019;s life: it is written by a sensible and well-informed but very dull man.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >C. G. K&#xF6;rner (<date when="1756-00-00">1756</date>&#x2013;<date when="1831-00-00">1831</date>), <hi rend="italic">Nachrichten von Schillers Leben</hi> (<date when="1812-00-00">1812</date>).</note> I forget his name&#x2014;but Schiller once lived in his house,&#x2014;near Leipzig, I think.</p>
<p>That miserable farrago of mine on the same subject goes on as ill as any thing can go. I have been thrice on the point of burning it, and giving up the task in despair. Interruption upon interruption, so that I have scarcely an hour in the day at my disposal; and dullness thickening round me till all is black as Egypt when the darkness might be felt!<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Exod. 10:21.</note> There is nothing for it but the old song Patience! Patience! I <hi rend="italic">will</hi> finish it.&#x2014; By the way, I wish you would think of the most striking passages you can recollect of in Karlos, Wallenstein, Tell &#x26;c: I design to give extracts and translations. Have them at your finger ends when you <hi rend="italic">come</hi>.</p>
<p>Alas! Alas! this <hi rend="italic">coming</hi> is a weary business: but I were a Goth to accuse <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, for I see you have my contentment honestly at heart. Well, I will wait; and the time will come when I shall be repaid for it. One thing only I am afraid of; that these Bullers may carry me away <pb id="pg-02-327" n="02:327"/>from Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> before your time! They speak of setting out for the country early in <date when="1823-05-00">May</date>&#x2014;sometimes, on the first day of it. I was quite enraged at them last week: they talked of living thro&#x2019; the summer at North Berwick, and I kept dreaming day and night about seeing you perpetually, and being happy by your side;&#x2014;till behold! it turned out that North Berwick would not do, and we must away to Dunkeld or some undiscovered spot among the Grampians! These are hard things for flesh and blood: but better days are coming. Blessed <hi rend="italic">future</hi>! one always turns to it. I have yet seen little of you&#x2014;but enough to make me pray that I may never lose sight of you, while I live in this world&#x2014;or any other. <closer><salute>I am always</salute></closer></p>
<p><closer><salute>Your friend and brother, /</salute></closer> <name>Th: Carlyle.</name></p>
<ps><p>You must write immediately. I am in an immense hurry, and as usual have concluded at mid-way. Byron has sent us a new poem the <hi rend="italic">Age of Bronze</hi>:<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">The Age of Bronze; or, Carmen seculare et annus haud mirabilis</hi> (<date when="1823-00-00">1823</date>).</note> it is short, and pithy&#x2014;but not at all poetical. Byron may still easily fail to be a great man. You shall see his <hi rend="italic">Bronze</hi> (a poetical squib) when you arrive; and another <hi rend="italic">Liberal</hi> which is on the way. Come speedily,&#x2014;lose no moment you can help losing. I know you will, being in the benignant aspect at present,&#x2014;which is your natural one, makes all the world love you, and if my prayers be heard will last forever. <foreign>Adieu</foreign> my dear friend! Be diligent and c<supplied>[ome!]</supplied></p>
<p>Alas! the <hi rend="italic">Kabale und Liebe</hi> is not here; you must content yourself with the Robbers<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Schiller&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Die R&#xE4;uber</hi> (Frankfurt and Leipzig, <date when="1781-00-00">1781</date>).</note> and the Life for this time, I will send the other instantly if you require it.</p></ps>

<salute>My dear Johnston,</salute>
<p>I received your letter yesterday; and judging that you might perhaps be in some hurry for an answer, I lose no time in sending one. With an ingenuity, for which if it were original I should take to myself no small credit, I have cut out a space in this sheet, fitted exactly for containing a five-pound Bill; and unless Fortune take some unexpected and very extraordinary caprice, the whole will be moving towards your quarters, in half an hour. You will write immediately to tell me whether it arrived safe. Immediately!</p>
<p><pb id="pg-02-328" n="02:328"/>Your last letter is satisfactory on the whole: it shews us that however the Cupar business may turn out, you have it in your power to make good your footing at Broughty-ferry, by simply applying those qualifications, of which we all know you to be master. Should you continue where you are, I advise you by no means to neglect the offers you may have to begin the boarding system. It is the only plan for making money, and getting yourself settled in among the people in a firm and respectable station. Nor is the difficulty of managing such a concern nearly so great as one is apt to anticipate. It requires little more than steadfast patience, methodical arrangements, and a certain zealous regularity, qualities without which it is impossible to prosper in any situation. If you were once fairly begun, you would go on rapidly and constantly towards respectability and plenty and all the solid comforts which a man can hope for in this world. Exert yourself for this once; and the worst part of the battle against Fortune will be over.</p>
<p>This past winter has been for me a very hard one: I have suffered more in it than it were useful to describe at present. My health is nothing improved; indeed when all is reckoned up I ought rather to wonder that I am still alive. No matter! Spite of dyspepsia and noises and stenches and smoke and disturbance, and the ten thousand times ten thousand unutterable curses to which poor tortured flesh is heir, here I am&#x2014;my prow still fronting the blast and the billows&#x2014;the old tarnished standard &#x201C;suffer and abstain&#x201D; still streaming in the storm, and to stream there by God&#x2019;s blessing to the end of the hurricane! I <hi rend="italic">will</hi> make the harbour yet, or go down wit<supplied>[h]</supplied> my hand upon the tiller: that is fixed.</p>
<p>Thank Heaven! we are to leave this infernal city in a month! We are going to Dunkeld or some place in the neighbourhood&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">where</hi> I seek not much; it will <supplied>[carry me]</supplied> to the open air, and that is every thing. I am going to read and study and write; perhaps to publish. Boyd the Bookseller will undertake the <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister</hi> of Goethe, if I like to give him a translation of it. I am writing at present; and burning as fast as I write.</p>
<p>There is not any new thing from Annandale: they are marrying and giving in marriage there, dying and being born, as usual. Have you heard of John Irving (Edward&#x2019;s brother in India)? He sunk under the climate some months ago: they are all mourning for his death. <foreign><hi rend="italic">O dira fames auri!</hi></foreign><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;O dire hunger for gold!&#x201D; (cf. Vergil, <hi rend="italic">Aeneid</hi>, III, 57).</note> not even <hi rend="italic">the Liver</hi> can drive men from the chase of it. <pb id="pg-02-329" n="02:329"/>If you would put me on the throne of Aurungzebe,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The last great Mogul emperor of Hindustan (<date when="1618-00-00">1618</date>&#x2013;<date when="1707-00-00">1707</date>).</note> I would spurn at India&#x2014;for the stomach&#x2019;s sake; and rather be a &#x201C;<foreign>swinkt</foreign> hedger&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A toiler among the hedgerows, a hard-working farmer (<hi rend="italic">Comus</hi>, l. 293).</note> <hi rend="italic">without</hi> nerves, eating porridge in my fatherland.</p>
<p>John is busy here and desirous to be in your thoughts: he began German the other day, and makes good progress. I was advising him this morning to go and pay you a visit before going down to Dumfriesshire, where he intends residing for the summer: he made little reply. You will write him without delay. Give us some more minute delineation of your <foreign><hi rend="italic">maniere d&#x2019;&#xEA;tre</hi></foreign> [way of life], the people you associate with, the way you spend your time, the studies you follow &#x26;c &#x26;c.

<salute>My dear Jane,</salute>
<p>Thinking you might have finished all that was new or interesting to you in the first volume of Schiller, I have ventured to send you the second. I also wanted to speak with you: and &#x201C;man is a selfish being&#x201D;&#x2014;as my Shoemaker at Ecclefechan positively assured me last summer.</p>
<p>My speech at present however must be very brief; for though longing greatly to talk with you, I have nothing worth a pin to say. I am quite sick at heart about this journey of yours. We are to depart for Dunkeld or Killiecrankie or I know not whither, in the first week of <date when="1823-05-00">May</date>; and already after to-morrow, I shall be confined constantly, except between one and four o&#x2019;clock. It is ever thus!&#x2014; I believe I shall have to travel without seeing you at all. I could &#x201C;roar&#x201D; like Bottom, when I think of this, &#x201C;so that it should do any one&#x2019;s heart good to hear me.&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">A Midsummer Night&#x2019;s Dream</hi>, I, ii.</note> I am seriously vexed. But do you never mind me. Come&#x2014;if woman&#x2019;s wit and good-nature can shew you the means; if not, be diligent <pb id="pg-02-330" n="02:330"/>and happy&#x2014;<foreign><hi rend="italic">und lass mich fahren</hi></foreign> [and let me go away]. You would be always dear to me, tho&#x2019; I should never see you more.&#x2014; But this is poor tragedy, and so I leave it.</p>
<p>Are you going steadily on with Gibbon? I hope you will stick by his skirts, in spite of all the roughness of the path, till he bring you to the end. There is much instruction in him, and much entertainment also&#x2014;tho&#x2019; one tires in so long a march. The volume which treats of Mahomet is a splendid piece of writing. <hi rend="italic">Never look at the notes</hi>, if you can help it; they are often quite abominable.</p>
<p>You must translate Egmont,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >By Goethe (<date when="1788-00-00">1788</date>).</note> during summer, <hi rend="italic">in proper style</hi>: we will print it, if we please! You must also write to me&#x2014;almost every day&#x2014;like a dutiful Scholar, as you always were. I am quite sorry&#x2014;and could almost laugh at my sorrow, it is so absurd&#x2014;for what I call this <hi rend="italic">parting</hi>. As if sixty miles could part us more effectually than sixteen!</p>
<p>In the mean time, do come hither&#x2014;unless it is expressly written to the contrary upon the &#x201C;Iron Leaf.&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle refers to this elsewhere as the leaf on which, according to Moslems, the Recording Angel writes. See <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, X, 189; XXVIII, 85.</note> Without delay!&#x2014; I have to hear you read Egmont; and to say nine hundred and ninety nine things, and hear as many; and the time is short very short. Do come my dear Jane&#x2014;if it be possible. Will you insert a &#x201C;not&#x201D; here as you once wickedly did, and send it me for answer? I do not think so.</p>
<p>Schiller swells on my hands; it will require to be divided into parts: I meditate <hi rend="italic">three</hi>. The first will be ready against your arrival, whenever that happens. I intend to have it done in two days. It is worse and worse; but never mind!</p>
<p>I read Spenser these some mornings, while eating my breakfast. He is a dainty little fellow, as ever you saw: I propose that you and he shall be closely acquainted by and by. What think you of this description of sunrise</p>
<lg><l>By this the golden oriental gate</l>
<l>Of heaven &#x2019;gan to open fair,</l>
<l>And Phoebus, fresh as bridegroom to <supplied>[his mate]</supplied></l>

<salute>My dear Friend</salute>
<p>You are entitled to double thanks this time. your little note was a most agreeable surprise. I have been wishing to write every day for a week past and have always delayed till the next in the hope of having something positive to say respecting our will o&#x2019; the wisp visit&#x2014;but my patience will hold out no longer, and so I write again without being able to give or get any satisfaction on the subject&#x2014; The gowns are made, the weather is fine, and there is nothing under the sun to detain us here that I can imagine&#x2014;and still my Mother does not fix&#x2014; The only symptom I can discover of our departure being at hand is the terrible hub-bub that is going on in the house, and which I have observed is always a prelude to our leaving home&#x2014; we have as much noise and bustle, and as many workmen employed&#x2014;about nothing&#x2014;as if we were preparing against a siege&#x2014; These &#x201C;redding ups&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >House-cleanings.</note> are fearful affairs and to my unhousewife perceptions they produce no other effects than confusion discomfort and dirt&#x2014;but no matter&#x2014;</p>
<p>So we are to have no reading of German this summer after all&#x2014;it is all one where we go now&#x2014;as far as you are concerned&#x2014; My Mother will not make out her visit to Dumfriesshire till after the beginning of <date when="1823-05-00">May</date> and till then my time in town will not be at my own disposal&#x2014; Well it is very very provoking&#x2014;but fretting will not mend the matter&#x2014; This fine weather is very unfavourable to my studies&#x2014;people come in and I am forced out at all hours of the day&#x2014;there is nothing for it but to rise earlier&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">by the help of the Lord</hi> I got over my bed at seven&#x2014;twice during the last week&#x2014; I am busy with Gibbon, my adorable&#x2019;s life of Necker (<hi rend="italic">not yours</hi>)<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mme de Sta&#xEB;l&#x2019;s life of Necker, not the brief one which Carlyle had written for Brewster&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Encyclopaedia</hi>.</note> and Fiesko<supplied>[.]</supplied><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >By Schiller (<date when="1783-00-00">1783</date>).</note> Either Schiller&#x2019;s prose is much more difficult than his verse or my head is much thicker than it was in winter&#x2014; I hope it is not putting you to inconvenience my detaining these books so long<supplied>[.]</supplied> If you want them tell me instantly&#x2014; <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;Speaking <pb id="pg-02-332" n="02:332"/>of swine</hi>&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Meaning ironically &#x201C;in this connection&#x201D; or &#x201C;by the bye.&#x201D; Cf. &#x201C;Speaking of marmalade,&#x201D; <ref target="volume-02/lt-18230308-JBW-EA-01">JBW-<sic>ES</sic><corr>EA</corr>, <date when="1823-03-08">8 March</date></ref>.</note> a very ludicurous and rather annoying circumstance occur<supplied>[r]</supplied>ed to me the other day&#x2014;you must have it for I think it will make you laugh&#x2014; I was in the drawing room alone&#x2014;fretting over the Robbers when, the door opened, and Betty an<supplied>[n]</supplied>ounced &#x2018;a stranger gentleman&#x2019;&#x2014; A young man of fair complexion, dressed in a green surtout stepped forward&#x2014; I rose&#x2014;bowed&#x2014;blushed and looked foolish as people do on such occasions&#x2014;and stood a few seconds in expectation that he would relieve my bashfulness by pronouncing his name or business&#x2014;but he did not seem inclined to break the ice, nor was I inclined to stand to be stared at, and so I motioned to him to take a seat and resumed my own&#x2014; After some minutes of perplexing silence my ears were startled by a volley of my beloved German but the stranger gentleman spoke so fast I could not catch his meaning and my dilemma was extreme. At last he asked in English if I was not Miss Welsh and if I did not understand his language? Being satisfied on these points he drew a book from his pocket and said with an undaunted smile &#x201C;You are rich Lady! I am poor. I have far to travel and am very poor indeed&#x2014;buy this book of me&#x2014;give me six and sixpence for this book!&#x201D; What a d&#xE9;nouement to my conjectures! how prosaic! I was mortified beyond measure&#x2014;it had not once entered my head &#x2018;the stranger gentleman&#x2019; was a beggar however I gave him half a crown <hi rend="italic">as he begged in German</hi> but declined buying his book (a sort of vocabulary) which could be of no use to me&#x2014; He seemed well enough satisfied but did not like a Scotch beggar, immediately march off with his booty&#x2014; He talked on for a whole hour and a half&#x2014; There was so much of the Gentleman in his appearance that I felt a delicacy in desiring him to go away and besides his conversation was so animated it discovered such a curious mixture of talent and meanness levity and sentiment that I did not find his company tiresome&#x2014; Among other passages of his history he told me of an affair he had in France with a young girl who was Beauty&#x2019;s self and goodness&#x2019;s self and who was <hi rend="italic">friend of his heart</hi> and dearer to him than all his <foreign><hi rend="italic">mondains</hi></foreign> friends together&#x2014; She was an orphan and her guardian was a knave and embezzled her little fortune (very <hi rend="italic">little</hi> I have no doubt)<supplied>[.]</supplied> The poor injured girl wept to him (to the stranger gentleman) and what cannot a beautiful woman effect by tears? a woman that loves? Her tears cost her guardian&#x2014;&#x2014;here he made a long and fearful pause&#x2014; What? I asked with some impatience; for though I did not half believe his little orderly romance I was interested in its catastrophe&#x2014;what did they cost him? his life Lady!&#x2014; I <pb id="pg-02-333" n="02:333"/>told him to restore, or by mine soul and honour and by the powers of the living Got<supplied>[t]</supplied> before the next sun went down he should be calt&#x2014;calt as ice&#x2014; I told him if there was any man in his human body to meet me in the Champ de Mars and give me vengeance! He cam Lady! <hi rend="italic">pal</hi> as this (touching his shirt collar) but I left him <hi rend="italic">pa</hi>ler&#x2014; You killed him then? ay Lady! killed him through here (pointing to his belly)&#x2014;and you feel no remorse? Ah <foreign>M&#xE4;dchen</foreign> my soul is dark as the middle of night&#x2014;had I one little glimmer of hope to guide me back to France! Ah <foreign>esperance! esperance!</foreign> but I have no hope no friend&#x2014;Amalia <foreign>mein</foreign> Amalia is dead! <foreign>keine hoffnung keine Freunde mehr</foreign> [no more hope, no more friends]!&#x2014;&#x2014; From time to time he relieved the <hi rend="italic">cunningly devised</hi> cruelties of his fate with the most humorous satire on the English&#x2014; speaking of their passion for crushing (cursing) he said it was quite proverbial on the continent&#x2014; when a John-bull appears on the streets of Paris the French say to each other &#x201C;<foreign>le voila! un Got-dam</foreign>&#x201D; [&#x201C;there is one! a God-damn&#x201D;]. Ah it is a crushing nation!&#x2014;</p>
<p>At last some other visitors came in and my German was constrained to take himself off&#x2014; On the evening of the following day a parcel (<hi rend="italic">paid</hi>) was brought me from Dunbar which to my great surprise contained the stranger Gentleman&#x2019;s vocabulary and a letter which I shall transcribe for your edification<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dated <date when="1823-04-12">12 April</date> and signed by James Robinson. What Jane gives is the original German, Robinson&#x2019;s actual letter (NLS, 529.55). The bracketed text here is an editorial translation.</note>&#x2014;</p>
<p>[My dear good little lady!</p>
<p>You know I visited you, and begged a favor from you. You were ever so kind and listened to my plea&#x2014; I told you of a young lady whom I loved, her name was Amalia Dorothea, Baroness de Rich&#xE9;re, whose guardian I stabbed in a duel.&#x2014; In that very moment when I entered your chamber, an ice-cold shudder shook my entire body, for such a resemblance as you bear to my Amalia (may her soul rest in peace) is indescribable; like one drop of water to another!&#x2014; To be sure I am poor in money, but merry and contented in my soul! Indeed all is lost! Father! Mother! My Amalia! My everything! Forever! Yes, forever lost! but today I felt as though I was in paradise! I scrutinized you closely, but found only exactly the same features as my Amalia! Good little lady! Do you know what the word &#x201C;Love&#x201D; means? have you ever thought about it? You probably know what La Fontaine says &#x201C;Great is the power of a woman in love!&#x201D; As proof that I treasure you much more than everything else in the world, I make <pb id="pg-02-334" n="02:334"/>you a present of this book&#x2014; May God be with you my good little lady! May love be your watchword! (Amen) Write me an answer at Berwick by the next post!!!!</p>

<p><foreign>Mein Gott!</foreign> what a strange stranger gentleman! I did not know what to do&#x2014; The <foreign>Antwort</foreign> [answer] was out of the question. I could not bring myself to write a friendly letter to a beggar how ever<hi rend="italic">rich</hi> he might be <hi rend="italic">in soul</hi>&#x2014; To return his confounded book was the next thing; but then the carriage of it would have cost him more than a beggar might have found convenient to pay:&#x2014;and according to the coach regulations I could not pay it further than Dunbar&#x2014; I then thought of sending him the price of it in a blank cover but that would have subjected me either to insult a fool or be duped by a knave&#x2014; I did not know what to do&#x2014;and so I did nothing at all&#x2014; But the stranger gentleman had no notion of letting me off so easily&#x2014;two days ago I received another epistle from Newcastle (he is getting on) complaining of my cruel silence&#x2014;wondering if I had not received his parcel, <supplied>[or]</supplied> if I could not read his German and praying me to relieve his anxiety by the very next post&#x2014;the most of this letter was written in queer english&#x2014;but the concluding sentence in which lay the cream of the jest was in German&#x2014; It ran thus (as I translated it) &#x201C;best, loveliest dearest of all women I ever saw! would that Fate had designed thee for my Bride&#x201D;! (a modest speculation for a german beggar!) &#x201C;Is then gold the only heaven gift that confers happiness? or is it not rather love?&#x201D; (<foreign>Wie kommen <hi rend="italic">Sie</hi> zu dieser Wahrheit</foreign>?

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I was in a monstrous hurry when your letter found me to-day, or rather when I found <hi rend="italic">it</hi>: we had begun our <hi rend="italic">new system</hi> at Buller&#x2019;s this morning&#x2014;where I am henceforth to breakfast &#x26;c as we used to do before the College Classes commenced. This had driven me off my aims, a good deal; and the aberration was increased by an unfortunate incident which <foreign>feel</foreign> [fell] out last night. A box of cut glass and other precious ware had been stolen last night; and poor Mrs Buller, whose husband is absent, not knowing how to act, made an instant appeal to me. I was in consequence obliged to sally forth, and take counsel with Thief-catchers and various other anomalous characters; and it was on my round of inquiries that I struck in by Moray-street, for a rest and a whiff of narcotic, that I discovered your letter and box in waiting for <pb id="pg-02-336" n="02:336"/>me. The box has at length been discovered, plundered of some articles, yet still retaining its most valuable contents: I have escaped for an hour, and am down scribbling to you with great zeal. Of course, I feel very tired and confused; but you will receive my lucubrations with patience or favour, whatever be their kind, and so &#x201C;I pay no regard to <hi rend="italic">that</hi>.&#x201D;</p>
<p>You are improving greatly in penmanship: I wish you would study it completely, and write to me far oftener. After a few trials, it would grow quite easy and pleasant to you. Nothing gratifies <hi rend="italic">me</hi> more than to hear of your welfare; or to hear as it were the sound of your Motherly voice at all.</p>
<p>We are all astir here, going to the four winds, in search of summer habitations. Old Buller went away yesterday with his youngest boy<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Reginald John Buller (<date when="1813-00-00">1813</date>&#x2013;<date when="1880-00-00">80</date>), later rector of Troston in Suffolk, where the Carlyles visited him in the autumn of <date when="1842-00-00">1842</date> just before the writing of <hi rend="italic">Past and Present</hi>.</note> to place him in a Boarding-school in Surrey: and the moment he returns from London, we all set out to the Highlands. They have taken a nine-months lease of that house &#x201C;away by the back o&#x2019; Dunkeld,&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Kinnaird House. Cf. <ref target="volume-02/lt-18230525-TC-JBW-01">TC to JBW, <date when="1823-05-25">25 May</date></ref>.</note> and are to enter on possession at the middle of <date when="1823-05-00">May</date>. I rejoice very cordially in the prospect of getting out to the country on any terms; and this Dunkeld, they say, has many charms besides those of greenness and fresh air. There are mountains around it and water-falls and what not: Our house, which is six miles above Dunkeld, stands within a short ride of Killiecrankie,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A mountain pass in Perthshire, the site of a battle in <date when="1689-00-00">1689</date> between the royal forces and the Jacobites, led by Viscount Dundee, Graham of Claverhouse. The Jacobites won, but the death of their leader ended their hopes for a time.</note> the most horrible monster of a place in all the north: I expect great pleasure in looking over all these wild things; for I am determined to have up that <hi rend="italic">beastie</hi>,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >One of Alexander Carlyle&#x2019;s ponies.</note> and to scamper about on the outside of it over the whole region.</p>
<p>You ask after my health, with your wonted solicitude; and I am happy to answer and &#x201C;tell you truly&#x201D; that it is wonderfully good. Considering every thing, I may well call it wonderful. For four months I believe there has not been one week in which I have not been roused from my sleep some night or other, and disturbed in the most abominable way. If I had got lived in quietness and regularity, I am perfectly positive, I should have been quite healthy at this very hour. It is only of late that I fell upon the notable device of sleeping <hi rend="italic">with <pb id="pg-02-337" n="02:337"/>my finger squeezed upon my ear</hi>, which I find to be the most effectual method of excluding sound, of any hitherto devised. It cost me many efforts to accomplish using myself to this expedient; but now I am quite trained to it, and practice it whenever any of the neighbours chuses to be noisy, or the wind to blow or the rain to patter, or any kind of disturbance to occur. I am a poor weak sinner to need such shifts: but I shall get beyond them all yet. With the advantages of country air and exercise, I shall certainly arrive at great vigour in summer; for there has not been a time for months when I could command three nights of sleep together, without feeling myself almost perfectly well. As it is, I am very greatly recovered indeed&#x2014;since you saw me; in far better spirits; and sound at heart notwithstanding all my ailments. When you see me next I shall be whole and well, or else I greatly err.</p>
<p>For bodily pain I care little, so long as it allows me to get along with my intellectual speculations. You ask after my book: I do believe it is begun at last! Irving has been treating with the Editor of the London Magazine, about some <hi rend="italic">lives</hi> of great literary characters that I was to write for that work, and afterwards publish in a separate form, if worth publishing. I began some weeks ago to <supplied>[write]</supplied> the <hi rend="italic">Life of Schiller</hi>, and it is growing on my hands to the size of a small book by itself. I almost determine to write it in three parts for the London men, and then collect them together&#x2014;enlarge, amend, and print them by themselves! The first part will be done in a day or two; and tho&#x2019; little to my own satisfaction, I finding it quite as good as many honest persons give to the world without reluctance, and find readers for in reasonable numbers. This Schiller is a noble fellow; the German whom I used to read at home in former summers. I am anxious to do him justice. If I had uninterrupted leisure, I could make something of it: as it is, I shall do my best&#x2014;and fear nothing&#x2014;for my aims I feel are not higher than my power will justify, and by God&#x2019;s blessing, I shall yet do <hi rend="italic">something</hi> in my time, for all this hustling and jostling I have had to suffer of late.</p>
<p>The Bullers are going to make tours &#x26;c; and I shall see you in the month of <date when="1823-08-00">August</date>! I shall come scampering home then for a month, with no small glee. In the mean time, do not fear that I will write to you in sufficient frequency: I am rather likely to err in excess than defect. Thus the difference of distance will make scarcely any difference in our correspondence.</p>
<p>I expect to be comfortable enough with the Bullers and my <hi rend="italic">life of Schiller</hi> during summer. They are very worthy persons in their degree, <pb id="pg-02-338" n="02:338"/>and seem to treat me always in a handsome manner. The oldest Boy satisfies me well; and tho&#x2019; I am sorry that his younger brother is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to travel as I thought, I make no doubt I shall get on with them in rather a superior way. The best part of the whole is, that I do not give a doit whether they favour me or not&#x2014;that is, except in a merely friendly point of view. One&#x2019;s only patron in this world must be himself; and I fear nothing&#x2014;I care nothing&#x2014;if these people pay me off to-morrow. Thus one lives calmly. But I must leave you, My dear Mother, with this long and perplexed letter, which may satisfy you by its bulk for one time. Give my kindest love to my Father and all the sisters and brothers.</p><p>

<salute>My dear Jane,</salute>
<p>I have not been so glad this month as when Dr Fyf<supplied>[f]</supplied>e poked in his little farthing-face yesterday, with such a look of glad intelligence: I knew he brought me tidings from the East.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Haddington is east of Edinburgh. Like Jane here, Blumine in <hi rend="italic">Sartor Resartus</hi> is associated with the East. Cf. Dan. 11:44: &#x201C;tidings out of the East.&#x201D;</note> The Doctor absolutely seemed to me one of the prettiest dapper little gentlemen I had ever set my eyes on&#x2014;the letter was so large, and he handed it in with such a grace. You cannot think how the Devil had been tempting me about you for the four preceding days: I imagined&#x2014; But now we have no time for that.</p>
<p>It is but half an instant since I finished this wretched bundle of papers,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Part I of his <hi rend="italic">Schiller</hi>.</note> at the sight of which you are turned so <hi rend="italic">pall</hi>: &#x201C;they will yet make you <hi rend="italic">paller</hi>&#x201D;&#x2014;count on that. You must read them all over with the eye not of a friend, but of a <hi rend="italic">critic</hi>: I must have your voice and decision and advice about twenty things before they go away. Besides I want to secure at least <hi rend="italic">three</hi> readers&#x2014;you, myself, and the Printer&#x2019;s devil: more I can do without. The thing is absolutely execrable: I have written as if I had been steeped in Lethe to the chin. &#x201C;My soul is black as the middle of night Lady&#x201D;&#x2014;or rather grey and heavy as the middle of a Liddlesdale<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The valley of the River Liddel in Roxburghshire.</note> mist. But never mind: tear the ugly thing to pieces, and <pb id="pg-02-339" n="02:339"/>give me your <hi rend="italic">severe and solid criticism</hi> and counsel, when you arrive. So you <hi rend="italic">are</hi> to be here on Saturday! Heaven be thanked for it&#x2014;I shall see my own Jane yet after all! Do contrive some reading of German or something that will bring us to meet together daily&#x2014;do, if it lies within the compass of your utmost ingenuity. You are a good creature, and full of wiles: do exert them for me! We are not to leave town till about the <date when="1823-05-20">twentieth of May</date> after all; I am still free between 1 o&#x2019;clock and seven every day: I expect all things from your kindness and neverfailing &#x201C;devices.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Here is an ass come in from Glasgow, and I must leave you. May the Devil comfort him&#x2014;in his own good time: I had still half an hour to spend with you.</p>
<p>You will let me know the first convenient moment after you arrive. Write to me at any rate&#x2014;if you cannot see me on Saturday: I shall be very fretful else. <foreign>Adieu</foreign> my dearest Jane! God bless you always!</p>

<salute>My dear Friend,</salute>
<p>I received your last letter by the Pennypost, Hope not having set out at the day appointed; and I need not say with what sorrow I learned that the indisposition, mentioned in your former letter, and which I imagined to be of the most trifling character, still lingers about <pb id="pg-02-340" n="02:340"/>you in so disagreeable a form. David<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Apparently David Hope, of Glasgow.</note> came the day before yesterday; and his statement has not diminished my anxieties. Few know by a blacker experience what it is to have an unquiet mind in a sick body, to have cares within us that require all the resources of our philosophy, and nothing coming from without but the various shapes of pain, which five diseased senses convey to us; few know all this better than my unhappy self, and truly does it grieve me to think that you should have to go thro&#x2019; a course of such bitter instruction also. It is hard, very hard: but what can be done to help it? Nothing, except that universal and often ineffectual operation, the summoning up of our soul to meet its stern trial with steadfastness, the determination <hi rend="italic">not to yield</hi> however it may go, the study to be busy for the present, and to look upon the future with hope. I think you have acted very wisely in the mean time, leaving the foul vapours of Glasgow for the inspiring breezes of your Fatherland. I have no doubt you already begin to perceive the advantages of the change: as the summer breaks up, you will grow sound again as ever, and forget this dreary episode of your history, or remember it only to draw profit from it. I know nothing in the world like ill health for teaching a man contentment: one learns then for the first time, how nearly all human lots are equal, what an immense proportion of our happiness depends on blessings which all share in indifferently, and how little, how very little can be made of any artificial acquisition when one of these universal and oft unnoticed gifts of Providence to all his children is withdrawn. I often firmly believe I could be comfortable in <hi rend="italic">any</hi> conceivable condition, so I had but health of body in it. There <hi rend="italic">is</hi> some truth in what the poet says about affliction&#x2014;that &#x201C;like a loathsome toad ugly and venomous it wears a precious jewel in its head.&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">As You Like It</hi>, II, i.</note> It is often needful to tame our wayward wiles; rightly suffered, it does not come in vain.</p>
<p>You see, my friend, I am preaching a little on this topic&#x2014;which I have too often had occasion to meditate; but I look forward to something far better for you than the effect of my tedious harangues. A month or two will set you on your legs again; and you will look back upon my sermons with a grateful indifference, as on all things well meant, but now superfluous. The only other advice that I shall press upon you is one that I reckon worth all the rest; it is to <hi rend="italic">be no moment idle</hi>, to bestir yourself however you may feel. I rejoice to learn your purpose of attacking the Moles with might and main: leave not a remnant of the colony, destroy them root and branch. Then ride over to <pb id="pg-02-341" n="02:341"/>Grange at frequent intervals to enjoy the society of your true and most estimable friends, go to Middlebie, to Mainhill, to Annan, never rest within doors when you can get without. I shall find you quite well, when I come down in <date when="1823-08-00">August</date>; you will have to give me all the history of your medical experience, as well as of your campaign against the <hi rend="italic">non-commissioned corps of Sappers and Miners</hi>, in which I wish you infinitely more success than I do your rascally brother-officer Hilt in his attack upon the patriots of Spain. See that you prove yourself a proper General!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Middlebie is a small village near Ecclefechan. Graham had just retired from the mercantile business in Glasgow to spend the rest of his life raising sheep on the family farm Burnswark and had begun by declaring war on the moles, the &#x201C;Sappers and Miners&#x201D; of this letter. He had written to Carlyle in his letter of <date when="1823-04-15">15 April</date> about the war he intended to wage forthwith against the moles &#x201C;who have invaded my territory like a horde of Ostrogoths and are destroying everything before them like the gallant Prince Hilt. It is my first campaign; and as I have a better cause, I hope to be more successful than he is entitled to be.&#x201D; His letter also conveyed tidings of the death of Edward Irving&#x2019;s brother John in India. Some of the Spanish patriots were to go into exile in England and are referred to in <hi rend="italic">The Life of John Sterling</hi>, chap. IX, as &#x201C;the Trocadero swarm, thrown off in <date when="1823-00-00">1823</date>.&#x201D;</note></p>
<p>You have already discovered that I am more than usually dull to-night. In fact we have had the most amazing day of it you ever saw. &#x201C;Mother Wilkie&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >His landlady.</note> is going to leave town on Whitsunday, and <hi rend="italic">the</hi> trustees made an onslaught upon her quite by surprise, bringing down a red flag with the motto &#x201C;Sale of household furniture,&#x201D; and a bevy of auctioneers and clerks and other miscellaneous raggabrish, the totality of whom affected a lodgment in the <hi rend="italic">Unmighty Mother&#x2019;s</hi> dwelling, and drove the peaceable inhabitants to utter rout. Jack got no dinner, except what he dived for in some of your and my old steak-shops; I lay mostly perdue at Buller&#x2019;s; and the &#x201C;Mother&#x201D; went about wringing her hands, and bewailing the loss of her plenishing, smoking tobacco at frequent times, and ever and anon calling to &#x201C;Maister Moartin&#x201D; the evil genius of all this tumult, to suspend his operations. At length evening came and the hurly-burly ended. Mother Wilkie had transported (or as she called it, <hi rend="italic">supported</hi>) our goods into the front room, the little place you once had; and here we are at length in quietness&#x2014;but in such a scene of dust and devastation as eye hath seldom seen. It is like a cane-plantation after a tornado. We are as patient as possible, and naturally as stupid. You must wait, if you want amusement or even sense.</p>
<p>I was unwilling to quit Wilkie&#x2019;s, being destined in a week or two to quit town altogether. If you have yet made out your visit to Main-hill, <pb id="pg-02-342" n="02:342"/>they will have told you that I am bound for the Highlands during summer: the Bullers have taken a house near Dunkeld, and we all set out about the middle of <date when="1823-05-00">May</date>. I need not tell you whether I rejoice at this; Kinnaird House is said to be a beautiful spot, and to me clear skies and green fields are in themselves a treasure. Town life is growing every day more odious to me; my passion for the country sometimes almost rises to the height of a lover&#x2019;s for his mistress. More than once in winter, driven to despair by the unsupportable abominations which human animals when crowded together in cities occasion to each other, I was determined within a hair&#x2019;s breadth to <hi rend="italic">cut and run</hi>, to rush forth into the open land whatever might betide; I thought it better to <hi rend="italic">starve</hi> in quietness and wholesome air, than to be killed by inches with noises and gases and odours, such as it hath not, save in Edinburgh, entered into the heart of man to conceive. Thank heaven! all that is over now; I am healthier than I was last year; and about to realize my favourite project of rustication, by which I hope to get completely cured. I am going to take plenty of books with me, to read and write, and work perfect wonders. You are likely to be <foreign><hi rend="italic">trysted</hi></foreign><note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;To have my letters <hi rend="italic">visited</hi> on you.&#x201D;</note> with sundry sheets of my lucubrations; I warn you in time.</p>
<p>The reason I have let you go so long on this occasion, is that I was too busy for writing any letters at all. There is a <hi rend="italic">Life of Schiller</hi> which I undertook to provide (by Irving&#x2019;s instigation) for the <hi rend="italic">London Magazine</hi>; it has swelled on my hands till it is almost fit for a book by itself. The <hi rend="italic">first part</hi> is to go off on Monday; the <hi rend="italic">second and third</hi>, I design to employ my spare time in till <date when="1823-08-00">August</date>. You will see the whole in due season: for if the Cockneys boggle in the least about it, I will make the jolly Bibliopolists Oliver &#x26; Boyd print it in a separate form, with &#x201C;notes and illustrations&#x201D;&#x2014;and there is a Book for you at once!&#x2014; Irving&#x2019;s &#x201C;Argument in four sermons&#x201D;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edward Irving&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">For the Oracles of God, Four Orations.

<salute>My dear Friend,</salute>
<p>I am to be in your side of the town, to-morrow morning; so I may as well leave you this. According to the sage proverb, if it do no good, it will do no harm.</p>
<p>I received your kind letter about two hours ago: it was &#x201C;like water to a thirsty soul.&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Prov. 25:25.</note> I do almost believe that you <hi rend="italic">are</hi> some Good Angel sent into this world for my especial solace, no less than for the many great and beneficent purposes which you are yet destined to accomplish. Never did a letter come more opportunely. I had been maintaining a stout battle against the Fiend, all day since five in the morning. From you I was separated; and Brother Jonathan,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >His brother John.</note> the only other soul of these parts that truly cared for me, was then as I calculated sitting down to tea with his mother at Mainhill. It seemed hard to be left alone, even in this most &#x201C;intellectual&#x201D; of cities,&#x2014;among the hundred and forty-nine thousand hearts that beat within the bosoms of its indwellers, not one beating with a faithful pulse for me, the <pb id="pg-02-345" n="02:345"/>great the important me! It is true, Mistress Wilkie&#x2019;s Cat is in exactly a similar case, and complains not a syllable; but the Cat is much more a Philosopher than I. It did seem very hard. I must either have written a longer and more stupid letter to <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, or have grown exceedingly sulky in fighting out the contest single-handed.</p>
<p>My dear Jane, you talk of &#x201C;gratitude&#x201D;&#x2014;in a style which is worthy of you: but I know well that if we should part to-night forever, it is I that have been the chief gainer. Since the day when I first saw you, there has always been one sunny place in my thoughts, when often all the rest was dark and surly enough. The frank upright and kind manner in which you have uniformly treated me, I shall not easily forget, while I remember any thing. It is one of my dearest hopes that I may live to thank you as I ought.</p>
<p>But I must not wander&#x2014;for you know all that already&#x2014;and the night is waning. We have business to discuss. I have almost decided about these Translations: and how, think you? That you must not meddle with them. In the first place there is your mother&#x2019;s will, which we should consider and respect, if merely because it is hers; and this has already determined against us. But independently of any such determination, the task seems to me unworthy of you. To translate <hi rend="italic">Elizabeth</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sophie Ristaud Cottin (<date when="1770-00-00">1770</date>&#x2013;<date when="1807-00-00">1807</date>), <hi rend="italic">Elisabeth, ou les exil&#xE9;s de Sib&#xE9;rie</hi>, 2 vols. (Paris, <date when="1806-00-00">1806</date>).</note> is an enterprize which, in Samuel Johnson&#x2019;s words, many men, many women and many children could effect;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Boswell, <hi rend="italic">Johnson</hi>, ed. C. B. Tinker (New York, <date when="1933-00-00">1933</date>), I, 264, on the subject of <hi rend="italic">Ossian</hi>.</note> from which therefore you could reap no credit; to which you could not even put your name. And what is worse than all, worse at least to me, there is something intolerable in the idea that <hi rend="italic">my</hi> noble Jane should officiate even in appearance as a kind of subaltern to the hacks of Oliver and Boyd, should send forth the first fruits of her pen (yet by God&#x2019;s blessing to be known over all the land) under the wing of any small prefacing Editor&#x2014;a creature of paragraphs and shreds, a maker of <hi rend="italic">Scrap-books</hi>&#x2014;a mere <hi rend="italic">thing</hi>. I declare I cannot abide this: if there were no other reason, I would almost vote against the undertaking upon that ground alone.</p>
<p>On the other hand, doubtless, I cannot but admit the sound sense of what you say about <hi rend="italic">employment</hi>: but I think we shall be able to provide more suitably for that want, by other means. There is <hi rend="italic">Meister</hi>, for instance, which I long much to consult you fully upon: if the project take effect, I count on your cooperation. Or perhaps it was a better thought which struck me to-day. You have heard of the Baronness <pb id="pg-02-346" n="02:346"/>de La Motte Fouqu&#xE9;,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Karoline Auguste de la Motte Fouqu&#xE9; (<date when="1773-00-00">1773</date>&#x2013;<date when="1831-00-00">1831</date>), second wife of the Baron.</note> a German Authoress of many pretty Tales, one or two of which I have read and liked; there is Christian Wolf by Schiller,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Schiller&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Verbrecher aus Infamie: Eine wahre Geschichte</hi> (<date when="1787-00-00">1787</date>, <date when="1792-00-00">1792</date>).</note> and possibly one or two similar stories in Goethe: what would you think of a Book appearing next winter with the title &#x201C;Tales from the German, translated and selected by Jane Baillie Welsh&#x201D;? A beautiful foolscap octavo&#x2014;with prefaces &#x26;c &#x26;c by your illustrious pedagogue&#x2014;ushering you with his cap in hand and in his gracefullest mood into the great drawing-room of Literature, and standing between you and the brunt of all criticisms whatsoever! Is not this worth fifty such schemes as the other? If you think so, I will go on Tuesday, and inquire about this Motte Fouqu&#xE9;, and send to London for her book if it is not here&#x2014;immediately. Never fear that you shall want work: if this plan will not do, we shall devise a hundred better, <hi rend="italic">whenever</hi> we have room to speak and act with freedom. O! that you <hi rend="italic">were</hi> at liberty: at present it is really tormenting. But there is a time coming, let us never fret. I know not what I would give for leave to speak with you unmolested for the space of one solar day. I believe I shall grow quite <hi rend="italic">demented</hi>, if I part from you thus. But we will not. <foreign>Esperance! Esperance!</foreign> We <hi rend="italic">shall</hi> meet at last, and be the kinder to each other for these vexations. Meanwhile never mind me and my conveniences: write to me&#x2014;one of your own little letters&#x2014;whenever you cannot see me: and be a <hi rend="italic">good</hi> <foreign><hi rend="italic">bairn</hi></foreign>, merry and cheerful; I shall be as patient as a stoic. On Monday-night I see you, if possible: let me know in the forenoon, if you do not like my decision, and it shall be as you would have it. At present I am half-sleeping, and tired as need be, and dull&#x2014;but not dull enough to hate you <hi rend="italic">altogether</hi>, tho&#x2019; I confess you <hi rend="italic">are</hi> a very hateful character, if I were not prejudiced. There is no end to this monster Prejudice. The Socinian Ministers say it is going to be the ruin of the nation at last;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The &#x201C;Socinians,&#x201D; those said to deny the divinity of Christ, replied by accusing the more orthodox as &#x201C;prejudiced.&#x201D; Irving, in ten years&#x2019; time, was to be (unjustly) accused before the Presbytery at Annan of the heresy of &#x201C;the doctrine of the fallen state and sinfulness of our Lord&#x2019;s human nature.&#x201D;</note> and sure enough it has inveigled me into your witcheries, and heaven knows what a dance it will lead me there. After all you must be a very wicked person&#x2014;but I cannot help loving you&#x2014;so there it rests.&#x2014; Good night My dear Jane!&#x2014; <closer><salute>I am ever your&#x2019;s,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Jack,</salute>
<p>I had given up hopes of your letter for Wednesday-night, when the Postman knocked his heavy knock, and sent me the wished for tidings, a little after dusk. I was heartily glad to learn that you had reached home so snugly, and found all our kind friends there in such a case. Long, long may they be so! We poor fellows have much to strive with; but there is always some sweetness mingled in our cup, while we have parents and brethren to befriend us and give us welcome with true right-hands.</p>
<p>In pursuance of your order, as well as to gratify my individual inclinations, I have selected one of those long sheets, and placed myself down at the desk to tell you my news, or rather having so few to tell, to scribble for an hour to you, as if you were still sitting by me at tea in the <foreign><hi rend="italic">gloaming</hi></foreign>, and I only obliged to talk with the pen instead of that more unruly member, which in sulky nights used to utter so many hard sayings. I am better humoured this evening; and besides, Jack, we are sundered now by moors and mountains many a weary league, so that chatting together is a more moving business than it lately was. We shall write <hi rend="italic">very</hi> often during summer, and to some purpose I doubt not.</p>
<p>Having found such a reception at home, I have no doubt that you will feel reasonably happy during summer, will make no small progress in various useful studies, and what is still better, completely recover your goodly corporeal fabric, which under the sinister influences of this miserable place had certainly begun to suffer somewhat. The only thing, as you well know, which can make and keep a rational creature happy is abundant employment; and this, I feel certain, your sedulous and rather anxious disposition will not let you want. By the time I reach Mainhill, you will read me a <foreign>leash</foreign> [a long discourse] of german, give me your opinion of Buffon,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Comte Georges L. L. de Buffon (<date when="1707-00-00">1707</date>&#x2013;<date when="1788-00-00">88</date>), French naturalist.</note> talk confidently about Anatomy and chemistry, and know all <hi rend="italic">the doses</hi> as well as Lavement<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >French apothecary, employer of Roderick in Smollett&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Roderick Random</hi> (<date when="1748-00-00">1748</date>).</note> himself did.</p>
<p>This is what may well be called &#x201C;reading Gregory&#x2019;s Conspectus&#x201D;:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-03/lt-18250122-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1825-01-22">22 Jan. 1825</date></ref>.</note> there is, you mind, another branch of study, that of &#x201C;English Composition&#x201D;; and for this also I have cared. Listen to me. Boyd and I have <pb id="pg-02-348" n="02:348"/>talked repeatedly about the French novels <hi rend="italic">Elizabeth</hi><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-02/lt-18230503-TC-JBW-01">TC to JBW, <date when="1823-05-03">3 May</date></ref>.</note> and <hi rend="italic">Paul et Virginie</hi>:<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jacques H. B. de Saint-Pierre (<date when="1737-00-00">1737</date>&#x2013;<date when="1814-00-00">1814</date>), <hi rend="italic">Paul et Virginie</hi> (Lausanne, <date when="1788-00-00">1788</date>). Oliver and Boyd published John A. Carlyle&#x2019;s translation of both novels in one volume in <date when="1824-00-00">1824</date>. See Edwin W. Marrs, Jr., &#x201C;Carlyle, Bernardin de Saint-Pierre, and Madame Cottin,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Victorian Newsletter</hi>, <date when="1968-00-00">Spring, 1968</date>, pp. 43&#x2013;45.</note> we have at length come to a bargain. I have engaged that you &#x201C;the Universal Pan&#x201D;, shall translate them both in your best style (I overlooking the <hi rend="italic">MS</hi>, and correcting the Press), and receive for so doing the sum of &#xa3;20: the whole to be ready about <date when="1823-08-00">August</date> next. You will get the French copies and the existing translations, by Farries; and then I read [advise] you, betake yourself to the duty with might and main. I have no doubt you will do it in a sufficient manner. You have only to consult the old copy at any dubious point, and never to be squeamish in imitating it. All that Boyd wants is a reasonable translation, which no one can prosecute him for printing. Those already before the public are very good, I understand, particularly that of Elizabeth by Bowles,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William L. Bowles published his translation of Sophie Cottin&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Elisabeth</hi> in <date when="1814-00-00">1814</date>.</note> and I need not advise you to read it over carefully before commencing, and study as much as may be not to fall below it. I was happy in getting this task for you, on various accounts. In the first place, it is a very favourable method of training yourself in the art of composition; secondly, it will serve to put some &#x201C;money in your purse&#x201D;;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Othello</hi>, I, iii.</note> and thirdly, it will vastly increase your comfort and <hi rend="italic">respectability</hi> at Mainhill during summer. This last is what I chiefly look to: a young man of any spirit is apt to vex himself with many groundless imaginations while in such circumstances as yours, to think he is useless and burdensome and what not; for all which, there is no remedy equal to giving him some work <hi rend="italic">to keep his hand in use</hi>, and tie the limbs of Fancy, while those of real industry are kept in motion. In this respect I trust the task will not be without its use to you. For the rest, never trouble your heart about the difficulties of it. I saw by your operations last year on Legendre, and I judge by the improvement you have since made, that you are quite equal to such a thing: and at the very worst, I can brush away all the impurities of your work with my critical besom in less than no time. So be content, My good Jack, with this &#x201C;day of small things,&#x201D;<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Zech. 4:10.</note> go thro&#x2019; it calmly and diligently, looking on it as the earnest of better and more weighty enterprizes that are to follow. I expect th<supplied>[at you]</supplied> and I are yet to write mighty tomes in concert!</p>
<p><pb id="pg-02-349" n="02:349"/>There never was such a <foreign><hi rend="italic">blethering bitch</hi></foreign> as I. Here is the end of <supplied>[my]</supplied> sheet, and not one word said about my news or any thing I meant to write about. Tell my ever-kind and dear Mother, that I am in very truth all but quite healthy. There is next to no disease about me, only vexed nerves, which the multiplied irritations of this city vex still farther. I have not tasted drugs since you left me. With quiet usage in the country for six months, I feel confident, I shoul<supplied>[d]</supplied> be completely well. And thither we are going soon! The Buller family set out on Thursday first, and I follow them at my leisure a few days after. Since you went off I have been unusually well. The first day I was rather surly or so; but I took to reading vehemently, and the evil spirit left me. I am now quite contented, as I used to be last year. At any rate I have no time to be otherwise: there is such regulating and arranging as you never knew, I am kept busy from morn to night. <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister</hi> I have <hi rend="italic">almost</hi> engaged to translate: Schiller also is to go on: what scribblings I shall have! I have grown better ever since we parted&#x2014;to-day and yesterday I bathed: it was very fine.</p>
<p>But I must close this despicable rag of a letter, and engage to send you another before I leave Town. How I long to see all the world at Mainhill! Give my heartfelt love to every one of them young and old. I expect to hear from Alick by Farries, and constantly throughout the season: his late silence I excuse for the sake of his seed-time labours, and well I may. Tell my Mother she must take tea every night. I do not think I shall want any socks; but she shall hear in time if I do. Tell my Father that it is <hi rend="italic">his</hi> time to write, he is in my debt and cannot pay me a minute <hi rend="italic">o&#x2019;er soon</hi>. Remember me kindly to Graham: give my services to the poetess<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle&#x2019;s little sister Jane, whose &#x201C;epistolary poem&#x201D; had been passed around. earlier in the year.</note> and all our beloved sisters and brothers <foreign><hi rend="italic">nominatim</hi></foreign>. Excuse this miserable scrawl: <closer><salute>I am hurried to death, but always your&#x2019;s</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Jack,</salute>
<p>You have yet hardly finished the last longwinded epistle; and behold you are reading another of the same manufacture. &#x201C;The mind of man&#x201D; as Will Smith<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably Will Smith, cobbler, of Ecclefechan: see <ref target="volume-01/lt-18200506-TC-JJ-01">TC to JJ, <date when="1820-05-06">6 May 1820</date></ref>.</note> would say, must guide itself by circumstances; and as these circumstances operate independently of its volitions, said mind is reduced to a deplorable state of uncertainty, and often in looking into the future, can hardly see beyond its nose. Hence irresolution, change of purpose, baffling of hopes, and twenty other fruits or seeds of weakness and chagrin. Hence among the rest, the scribbling of this present letter.</p>
<p>I told you that the Bullers were going forth of the city, on thursday, and that I was to be left behind them for a few days. It now appears that these few days may in all probability be protracted into above a week; for the furniture is all to pack and settle at Kinnaird-house, and the Bullers in such things are a very helpless colony. This is the first &#x201C;independent circumstance.&#x201D; Another is the progress these accursed Painters are making. This afternoon, I had lain down to refresh my wearied <foreign><hi rend="italic">kyerkage</hi></foreign> [carcass] with a few drops from the ambrosial horn of Sleep, having got but a stinted quantity the three preceding nights; and at my awakening in the dreary wet twilight, the first thing that saluted my astonished senses was a smell of pigment enough to destroy a moderate ox. I started up, and found that the rascals had besmeared all the passage, and the outside of my door, some portion of their filthy labour even shewing itself thro&#x2019; the crevices within. Portioner Wilkie<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The landlord. <hi rend="italic">Portioner</hi>: legal term for proprietor of a small estate.</note> was wringing his old withered <foreign><hi rend="italic">meags</hi></foreign> [hands], not knowing what to do; the wretched men had told him that they must be over <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the house next tuesday. The Portioner is one of <pb id="pg-02-352" n="02:352"/>the weakest souls ever stamped with the features of humanity. It is vain to calculate on his resistance: if a gruff-looking fellow were to come in daily for a week, and tell Wilkie with a stern voice that he insisted on his (the Portioner&#x2019;s) <hi rend="italic">dying</hi> against a certain day, Wilkie would begin to relent about Thursday, and before Saturday he would yield without a struggle to his fate. A sucking child might lead him. So it is vain to think of <hi rend="italic">his</hi> protection; and tho&#x2019; I maintained stoutly that if I found the stinking lubbers within <hi rend="italic">my</hi> apartment, I would heave their pots over the window, and give themselves a very abrupt dismissal; yet I foresee that it will be difficult and unpleasant to hold out against them till the end; and my survey of the &#x201C;rooms to let,&#x201D; which I made to-day on other accounts, is very uninviting. Therefore, Jack, behold how I have decided. That I must gather up my tackle, set my affairs in order, and&#x2014;start for Mainhill! This I hope to do about Wednesday-morning. To-morrow I shall speak to Buller on the subject; on Monday, I must pack and stow, and settle the nine hundred and ninety nine thousand nine hundred and ninety nine concerns that I have at present lying about me in the height of confusion. Three nights more, I will manfully endure the bellowing of that watchman, the <foreign><hi rend="italic">gulravishing</hi></foreign> [rowdiness] of these &#x201C;top needle-women Mr. Car<hi rend="italic">leil</hi>&#x201D;&#x2014;to whom I perceive Satan has given a (short) respite; and by the middle of the week I shall be sleeping under my Father&#x2019;s roof, with no watch&#x2014;or needle-man or woman to disturb me any more. Jack will meet me with the pony at the &#x201C;place eight miles below Moffatt.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The purpose of my present writing is not so much to forewarn my kind friends of this pleasant event, as to have you on the look-out for more precise information&#x2014; But stay! It is already past eleven o&#x2019;clock, and you cannot have this letter earlier than Tuesday-night. Therefore it is vain to look for &#x201C;more precise information&#x201D;&#x2014;or for any more information <supplied>[at all.]</supplied> Well <supplied>[then]</supplied> I will conclude for this time, and keep this by me till <supplied>[I]</supplied> can give you certain notice. I could scribble till the sun rose: but the paper is limited; so I withdraw and bid heartily a good night to you and all about Mainhill. May our meeting be soon and joyful!</p>
<name>Thomas Carlyle&#x2014;</name>
<p>11th 6. P.M.</p>
<p>I have seen Buller and got leave of absence on Wednesday-morning: But alas! on examing the Coach-office people, I find the Mail does not pass thro&#x2019; Moffat on that day; so on meditating the matter all the way down the walk, I have come to the conclusion that I cannot start till Thursday. On Thursday, however, the universal Pan will <pb id="pg-02-353" n="02:353"/>mount his fleet steed after breakfast, and set forth at a <foreign><hi rend="italic">canny</hi></foreign> [slow] pace to be at the spot of meeting an hour or so before the time the Coach usually reaches it. I shall take out my seal to-night in order to avoid all chance of mistakes. The loss of this day somewhat grieves me for I have very few to stay; I must return that day week. Nevertheless I will come merrily, for I want to see you all, and I cannot abide the thought of loitering here amid stench and confusion and insomnolence, without any thing to do. To-morrow I shall order your French and English novels, and try to bring them with me. Then what pack-packing! But I will gird up my loins and go thro&#x2019; it manfully. Tell my Mother to have <hi rend="italic">tha kittle boailing</hi>, on Thursday evening about the fifth hour. I will not drink above three quarts of it&#x2014;or thereby.</p>
<p>Richmond says Waugh<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Waugh.</note> is deranged: &#x201C;the symptoms were very bad.&#x201D; Richmond is himself next door to derangement; a greater <hi rend="italic">clatter</hi> breathes not.</p>
<p>Tell all the world at Mainhill that I am coming.</p>

<dateline>3. Moray-street, Sunday-morning. [<date when="1823-05-11">11 May 1823</date>]</dateline>
<salute>My dear Jane,</salute>
<p>If I wanted to preach on the emptiness of human hopes, the history of yesterday might afford the best of commentaries on that most stale of texts. How differently the sun rose and set upon me; what I looked for at six in the morning, what I found at six in the evening! But it boots not to murmur: let us submit quietly to what cannot be avoided, and dwell rather on the bright side than the dark both of what is past and coming. This visit of yours has been sadly marred; yet I have much to thank it for. I dreamed of it pleasantly for three months; I saw you four times; we had an hour to ourselves, and such an hour is worth months of life as it usually passes. We are parted now, vexatiously enough; but we shall meet again ere long, under happier stars; and I still keep looking forward to a glorious time, when we shall feel independent of other people&#x2019;s arrangements, and be to one another all that Nature meant us to be. Never mind it, my dear Jane: what are a few days, when one has a life to lead, and knows how to lead it? <pb id="pg-02-354" n="02:354"/>Cast away your anger, clear up your countenance, and accompany your Mother with a cheerful heart. She <hi rend="italic">should</hi> have let you stay; but guard yourself from believing that she did not mean it kindly towards you. Who knows what anxieties she entertained respecting you, what benefits she thought might follow to you from this journey. If you consider her conduct as capricious, it becomes <hi rend="italic">you</hi> to pardon what yourself would have been above committing, and always to love and honour her, who can never cease to love you but with her life. I pay no compliment to your mother, beyond what any mother merits, when I remind you that no human being can ever have your interest more truly at heart than she has. Do not quarrel with her, therefore; go to the South since she requires it, and blithely because it is but acquitting yourself of a debt to make her happy.</p>
<p>For your Nithsdale friends, you do well not to heed them. Thank God! you are nowise dependent on them for protection or patronage, or any thing but kindnesses&#x2014;which you can requite richly if offered, and dispense with easily if withheld. There are hearts now beating in the world that would be blessed in doing for you, what nature and gratitude called on <hi rend="italic">them</hi> to do. If the call has been neglected, conceive yourself to be elevated far above the influence of such poor proceedings, and your contempt will gradually change into pitying toleration. Do not vex yourself with their selfishness and shallowness; enjoy the grain of goodness and real affection which you will find in every one of them, and look upon their accompanying alloy as the concern of those who feel so meanly, not of you.</p>
<p>I know but dimly what difficulties you have to dread from the present twelvemonth. It is easy indeed to see that you have always much to strive with. I hope I should feel an admiring sympathy with one so situated, tho&#x2019; she were nothing in particular to me. It is as if an eaglet were condemned to mix with creatures of a lower wing, and to be ruled over by them for a time. But it is only for a time! I commit you to the guidance of your own clear understanding, and noble heart; and I feel no fear that you will fail in the trial. Nor will it seem presumptuous if I put forth my humble claim to share in <hi rend="italic">all</hi> that distresses you. God knows I have little power to help with counsel or otherwise; but Jane does not doubt that I am true to her from the very bottom of my heart, and it is always something, when one suffers, to know that another suffers with us and on our account. Trust me, my own dear Jane! I have examined myself, and I tell you I am not all made of clay. The world holds nothing in it, for whose fate I am more anxious than yours. I <hi rend="italic">have</hi> this merit, if scarcely any other.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-02-355" n="02:355"/>But wherefore am I drawling it in this most elegaic strain? Mercy! you would think the one of us was dead or wedded or under sentence of perpetual exile<supplied>[.]</supplied> Are we not alive and loving one another? Are we not free agents, with right and reason on the side of will? What then are we afraid of? There is nothing that can frighten us; no might or dominion upon Earth or below it (those Above are <hi rend="italic">with</hi> us) that can take from ourselves the direction of our destiny. We will both of us <hi rend="italic">do as we please</hi>, in spite of all that can be said or sung to the contrary; and both of us, if it so please God, be happy and dignified in our day and generation. Fear nothing, my best and dearest Jane; this year will pass as others have done, only with more fruit of your exertions; and every thing will be as we would have it, in the end. What have <hi rend="italic">we</hi> to dread, <foreign><hi rend="italic">seit wir uns rund umschlungen fest und ewig</hi></foreign> [since we have clasped each other firmly and forever]!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Schiller&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Die Piccolomini</hi>, III, v: &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Wir haben uns gefunden, halten uns / Umschlungen, fest und ewig</hi>.</foreign>&#x201D;</note> Are we not &#x201C;two originals in our own humble way&#x201D;?<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-02/lt-18230406-TC-JBW-01">TC to JBW, <date when="1823-04-06">6 April</date></ref></note> And who the Devil shall prevent us from &#x201C;aiding and abetting&#x201D; each other in all lawful purposes, and bringing them all to a fortunate conclusion? No man or thing shall prevent us. Fear nothing!</p>
<p>I have not told you the half of my disappointment, or you would admire my philosophy. The Bullers are to set off on Thursday, and they had given me the subsequent week to spend here as I thought proper. I calculated on spending sixteen hours per day of it beside you&#x2014; All gone now!&#x2014;and nothing left but what <supplied>[is]</supplied> doubly hateful to me! I have determined to forsake this wretched place, which wanting you has little in it that I care to waste good hours upon: I set off for Mainhill about Wednesday morning. To-morrow I shall order the Book of <hi rend="italic">Volksm&#xE4;hrchen</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >J. K. A. Mus&#xE4;us (<date when="1735-00-00">1735</date>&#x2013;<date when="1787-00-00">87</date>), <hi rend="italic">Volksm&#xE4;hrchen der Deutschen</hi>, 5 vols. (Gotha, <date when="1782-00-00">1782</date>&#x2013;<date when="1786-00-00">86</date>).</note> for you: it is going to answer rarely; the tales seem very good, they will employ all your gracefulness and humour of style to translate them properly. I will read them first, and then send them down to you: out of five volumes of good stories, we shall certainly succeed in gathering one of excellent. Meantime go on with Egmont and Faust and Gibbon. You will have a busy and pleasant summer; I must hear of you <hi rend="italic">weekly</hi> at the seldomest; if you forget me, you are but a dead woman. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Sie wissen wohl dass Lafontaine sagt</hi></foreign> (or might have said) &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">gross ist die Macht eines Mannes im Scolden und Sulken und R&#xE4;supadusten</hi></foreign>.&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >You know well that La Fontaine says (or might have said) &#x201C;great is the power of a man in scolding and sulking and raising up dust.&#x201D; La Fontaine had really said, &#x201C;Great is the power of woman in love.&#x201D; Carlyle may be mocking the reference to La Fontaine in James Robinson&#x2019;s letter to Jane. See <ref target="volume-02/lt-18230416-JBW-TC-01">JBW to TC, <date when="1823-04-16">16 April</date></ref>. The last five words of the quotation are underscored twice.</note> So think of it my <foreign>bonny Bairn</foreign>, or it will be worse <pb id="pg-02-356" n="02:356"/>for you. I too am to be very busy. I purpose finishing Schiller and translating <hi rend="italic">Meister</hi> in spite of all its drawbacks. <hi rend="italic">Meister</hi> will introduce us to its Author; for you must know that you and I are to go and live six months at Weimar, and learn philosophy and poetry from the great von Goethe himself: I settled it all the other night; so there is nothing farther to be said upon the subject. I intend like my old friend Joseph Bonaparte &#x201C;to <hi rend="italic">oblige you to go voluntarily</hi>&#x201D;!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18210604-TC-JBW-01">TC to JBW, <date when="1821-06-04">4 June 1821</date></ref>.</note></p>
<p>But I must quit this trifling, for the paper is done, and we have&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">to part</hi>! I wish to hear from you the very moment you receive this. If on surveying the ground, you judge that it would not prejudice the &#x201C;commonwealth,&#x201D; I should propose to walk out to Corstorphine on tuesday evening, and see you once again. Five minutes spent near you in talking of our own concerns in our own way, would amply recompense me for all the toil. Even a stiff and formal interview before unconcerned spectators is not without its value. I leave you to decide entirely. If you think it will not answer, say so; if otherwise, it shall go hard but I will make it out in spite of all arrangements. Write to me any way: and if within eight days you have a moment&#x2019;s time, write also to Mainhill, and tell me how I must direct to you from the North. You will have entered my native County before I leave it: I shall climb Burnswark at sunset, and see its red light shining on your dwelling-place, and think prayers for your welfare. God bless you my dear Jane! and keep all evil far from you! Shall we not meet again? Forget me not, my Dearest! Farewel<supplied>[l]</supplied> and love me! <closer><salute>I am your&#x2019;s forever and ever,</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>Alas! Alas! My dear Jane,</salute> I cannot see you on Tuesday, as I partly hoped to do. The Coach does not run my way on Wednesday: I must set off to-morrow morning, or be quite belated; and before you read <pb id="pg-02-357" n="02:357"/>this, I am many a weary mile away. Sad work! But it will not last forever; that is my consolation.</p>
<p>If your letter does <hi rend="italic">not</hi> contain a refusal, I shall curse my stars. It will lie here for eight days, then I shall see.</p>
<p>Will you not write to me at Mainhill? I know you will, if you can command one moment&#x2019;s leisure. I shall begin to ask at the Post-office there on Friday first: if you cannot help it, never mind my disappointment. Only I must know your address in Nithsdale, and all your movements, or I shall be very unhappy, and at a loss how to proceed. So you had better write to me if it were only a line.</p>
<p>And now my best and kindest of Friends, farewe<supplied>[l]</supplied> for a short season! Amid all my wanderings the proudest thought of my heart will be that you thought me worthy of your sympathy; my dearest hope will be in its continuance. God keep you, my own Jane! I trust we were born for one another&#x2019;s good not evil. Write to me about every thing you do and suffer and enjoy. Never forget me utterly. For myself, I cannot lose the remembrance of <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, but with the last pulse of my existence. Farewel<supplied>[l]</supplied>, my beloved Jane!</p>
<p><closer><salute>I am ever, ever, / Your most affectionate friend, /</salute></closer> <name>Thomas Carlyle.</name></p>
<ps><p>Write to me, and you shall hear the moment I arrive at Dunkeld. Be sure to write! One line is infinitely better than none.</p>
<p>I am hurried to death&#x2014;and tired&#x2014;I have done the work of twenty men to-day, and it is scarcely finished yet. Good night! and peace be with you always!</p></ps>

<salute>My dear Alick,</salute>
<p>I am just arrived at this nook of the great Strath-Tay;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Valley of the Tay River.</note> and the first moment of privacy at my command I consecrate to the kind desires of my friends at home. You shall have a narrative of all my outs and ins, since the morning of our parting.</p>
<p>On arriving at Moffat, while ripping out the fastening of my trowsers and gaiters, sitting at my ease on the Coach-roof, and patiently undoing Mag&#x2019;s needle-work, I was astonished to hear my name pronounced in a tone of gladness by some one in the crowd below. It was a measurable space before I could pick out the speaker, and reply to his civility by saluting in my turn the facetious little Dr Fyf<supplied>[f]</supplied>e of Haddington, a creature somewhat above the size of Thomas Thumb, shallow and flimsy as need be, but full of life as all little creatures, crickets to begin with, use to be. Jack once saw him call on me at dinner. He was now on his way to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, and took his place beside me with infinite glee; handing me his snuff-box, telling me his queerest stories (very very stale in general), and fidgetting about in the briskest manner you could imagine. I made shift to laugh as well as I could at the wit of this slenderest of the sons of Esculapius, and as the day was fine we did tolerably enough, till towards two in the afternoon. Then however it began to rain, and the little Doctor was obliged to screw himself together and hold his peace. The shower was long and sharp, and a <foreign><hi rend="italic">scullion</hi></foreign> of a woman, whom Fyf<supplied>[f]</supplied>e was acquainted with, and received with open arms when she mounted the Coach on this side of Crook, insisted on holding one of the ribs of her umbrella right on the point of my shoulder. I should have been wetted, had I not taken measures to remedy this arrangement, by crouching myself down till my own umbrella got to be lowest, after which I sat as snugly as could be expected in such a case. At Noblehouse the rain abated, and I laid in a mass of bread and beef sufficient to keep me eating <pb id="pg-02-360" n="02:360"/>for the better part of an hour. Then taking a quid of tobacco into my jaw, and wrapping round my legs with good wheat straw, I bade defiance to all the elements of nature, and rode on in better heart than either Fyf<supplied>[f]</supplied>e or his Lady, tho&#x2019; they were both wrapped up in dreadnoughts, and <hi rend="italic">she</hi> was at least as weighty in flesh as both her male companions. At Pennycuik, the rain began again to be heavy; and I was peering out below the edge of my umbrella, when I noticed thro&#x2019; a window in the Inn, the sallow visage of&#x2014;Frank Dixon!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Francis Dickson (<date when="1798-00-00">1798</date>&#x2013;<date when="1832-00-00">1832</date>), preacher and farmer, friend of Irving and Carlyle, described by Carlyle as a &#x201C;most quizzing, merry, entertaining, guileless and unmalicious man.&#x201D; See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18171120-TC-JJ-01">TC to JJ, <date when="1817-11-20">20 Nov. 1817</date></ref>.</note> He was returning homewards on a little flinging pony, being tired of lingering longer in the &#x201C;<foreign>reekie</foreign> Harlot,&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Auld Reekie</hi> has long been a nickname for Edinburgh.</note> and had made just nine miles since morning, obliged as he was to seek shelter at the out-breaking of every shower. We talked five minutes together, both sorry I suppose at being thus darted about like shuttles from end to end of the kingdom, without getting more than a glance of each other as we passed. A little while before, I had met the Waffler,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Farries, the carrier between Edinburgh and Dumfriesshire.</note> glittering with moisture, and waving his whip round the ears of <hi rend="italic">Bobby</hi>, among a crowd of other Carriers. I asked if he had got the Box: I bullied him in secret, when he answered n-n-na! I took care however to secure you against more disappointments on this head, shortly after my arrival.</p>
<p>Wilkie was overwhelmed in confusion, when she saw me: the house was full of paints, and she feared I should fare badly. One reason among many why I should try to make my stay but short! Accordingly after swallowing some tea, I set out like a roaring Lion, went thro&#x2019; business as if that day had been the last of my life, and by ten or eleven o&#x2019;clock I had &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">a&#x2019; by</hi>.&#x201D; Wilkie erected me a bed in my old bed-room, where I slept, tho&#x2019; annoyed at first (for the last time in this world) by the Manties, soundly enough for eight hours. I arose to finish all my arrangements, and at ten o&#x2019;clock I was in the interior of the Waterloo coach on my way to Perth<supplied>[.]</supplied> The skipper of the Burntisland steam-boat and I had a small adventure about smoking, otherwise our whole journey was delightful. I rode on the outside except when it rained. My old Fifeshire looked in general very ill; but this county of Perth was beautiful from the very first. Strathearn (the valley of the Earn) is the finest looking piece of land I ever saw; bounded by monstrous wild rocky mountains waving in trees and heaths, and offering between their bases the most luxuriant crops of wheat &#x26;c in the best <pb id="pg-02-361" n="02:361"/>style of cultivation. I could speak a whole day about this country and the town of Perth and the people I saw there, and so forth; but there is not an inch of room for any such operation. If I went on as I began there would be no end thro&#x2019; a score of sheets. So I must content myself with saying that I arrived at Dunkeld last night about 8 o&#x2019;clock, after a delightful ride, which terminated in a place still more delightful than any other I had seen. Had it been to Mainhill, I would have walked on; but among people of such a fashionable turn, I judged <supplied>[it]</supplied> unsuitable to proceed farther, and so tar<supplied>[ried]</supplied> all nig<supplied>[ht]</supplied> in that ancient clachan. My sleep was pretty good, and <supplied>[in the]</supplied> morning I felt strong as ev<supplied>[er]</supplied>. The distance hither is six (or as the people call it <hi rend="italic">sucks</hi>) miles, which I easily walked before noon, and pleasantly tho&#x2019; it was raining. The [Buller] family received me hospit<supplied>[ab]</supplied>ly and shewed me into my quarters, where I spent two hours in unpacking and arranging my goods. I have now dined, and having all <hi rend="italic">put to rights</hi>, I am scribbling to Alick. This is the most meagre of details: but some night thou and I, boy, will sit up and tell it all <hi rend="italic">out</hi>side and <supplied>[inside]</supplied> till the clock begin striking the short hours ere we part. Meanwhile, tho&#x2019; confused, as a man so tired and perplexed has right to be, I can gratify my good Alick&#x2019;s heart and the hearts of others that will hear him, by declaring my firm persuasion that I shall certainly be quite comfortable here. I am lodged in all respects completely to my mind. It is a room in a house <hi rend="italic">the whole of which</hi> but for this <hi rend="italic">is empty</hi>. It was a kind of cottage inhabited by the former man&#x2019;s Mother&#x2014;all very dashy with its papered walls &#x26;c; and one of the rooms has been fitted up in a neat enough style for me, and a capital bed-room it will make. It has a window on each side; the one looking into a quiet courtyard with nothing in it that I have seen but a few turkies, the other into a bowling-green surrounded with tall trees, where the birds are singing even now in spite of the rain. I shall be as quiet as in the middle of <supplied>[the]</supplied> Sahara; shall bolt my door and study and read and smoke according to my own pleasure. This night I am going to send to David Hope of Glasgow for a stock of pipes and tobacco: I shall be quite as I want to be.</p>
<p>You must write to me immediately at great length, telling me how you got home, and how all and sundry are doing with you. Jack can take a part of your sheet if you have not time: tell him I saw his Bookseller,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Oliver and Boyd were to publish John A. Carlyle&#x2019;s translations of Saint-Pierre&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Paul et Virginie</hi> and Sophie R.

See <ref target="volume-02/lt-18230509-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1823-05-09">9 May</date></ref>.</note> and arranged every thing. Give my truest affection to every <pb id="pg-02-362" n="02:362"/>one at Mainhill. I hope our Mother is well: I have dreamed about her every night since I went away.

<salute>My dear Friend,</salute>
<p>Your punctuality towards me required a better recompense than this apparent negligence. I galloped down to Ecclefechan on the day appointed, amid storms of wind and rain; I found your letter waiting for me, like a diamond among the rubbish of the place, and returned home to read it, careless of the tempest, and more quickly than I had come. Since Thursday, if you have thought of me at all, it must have been with something of irritation at my sloth: but you would lay aside that feeling if you knew the bustle and confusion in which I have passed my time. I scarcely exaggerate when I call this the very first quiet hour that has occu<supplied>[r]</supplied>red in my history since you wrote. Now that I am settled, I shall be as regular as ever. Our correspondence has always been delightful to me; and I now begin to augur from it even more enjoyment than before. Let me beg of you to second my endeavours to make the most of it, while the Fates allow it to continue. <pb id="pg-02-363" n="02:363"/>It seems to depend upon ourselves whether we shall be as happy as two persons need be.</p>
<p>I spent a joyful week in Annandale, amid scenes in themselves unattractive or repulsive, but hallowed in my thoughts by the rude but genuine worth and true affection of those who people them. I know not how it was that I so confidently anticipated seeing you on my return either at Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> or Corstorphine. Perhaps I reckoned on the irregularity of your movements, and imagined that the chapter of chances would for once turn up in my favour. But it did not: on Thursday morning, these delusions were dispelled. The Coach had just reached Workman&#x2019;s door in Moffat, and I was sitting calmly on my place, reposing after a hard ride on horseback of nearly twenty miles, when a voice below pronounced my name in a tone of gladness; and whose should the voice be but your little Doctorkin&#x2019;s! It was Fyf<supplied>[f]</supplied>e himself travelling like a weavers shuttle from Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> and back to it: he took his place beside me on the roof, and we journeyed together. &#x201C;Miss Welsh, sir,&#x201D; said he &#x201C;arrived at her Grand-father&#x2019;s the night before last.&#x201D; This joyful intelligence was given with an air of knowingness and self-sufficiency which I relished very little. The topic of &#x201C;Miss Welsh&#x201D; I studied to avoid for the rest of the day. This Fyffie is a jewel of a creature; made of the kindliest clay, feels good will towards many persons, ill will towards none; and his little spirit mounts and swells and whirls about with all the briskness of the freshest cann of penny-beer. I cannot but admire the man, a little more would make me envy him. The lion is ruler of the forest, but the squirrel leads a merrier life: one had sometimes rather be the squirrel. I shall always entertain a species of affection for your Doctor: he is of the <hi rend="italic">genus</hi> cricket, and I like all crickets.</p>
<p>There was nothing but toil and chagrin for me in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>; so I staid there only a few hours, and last night I arrived here. Of course I can yet say nothing definite about those mighty enterprizes in which you and I are to be engaged throughout the summer; only, in general terms, that I still augur well of their success. <hi rend="italic">M&#xfc;sae</hi><supplied>[<hi rend="italic">u</hi>]</supplied><hi rend="italic">s</hi> was not come to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, when I passed; but I look for it here shortly: when I have perused two volumes of it, you will find them at Haddington, with my remarks, and then you must begin the work of translating with might and main. In the mean time, I hope you are busy with Faust and Egmont, and already recovered from the fatigues and vexations of the North. Be careful scrupulously careful about your health; keep yourself constantly employed in the same noble occupations which have hitherto formed the great business of your life; <hi rend="italic">never forget your worshipful</hi> <pb id="pg-02-364" n="02:364"/><hi rend="italic">Tutor</hi>; and no evil shall betide you. I often feel assured that we shall yet join hands in perfect happiness: God grant the time were soon to come, and never to pass away!</p>
<p>For my own part, I think I am going to be comfortable enough in my new quarters. The Bullers are good people, and what is better, the first hour when they treat me uncivilly shall likewise be the last. So we live together in that easy style of cheerful indifference, which seems to be the fit relation between us. For the rest, I have balmy air to breathe, fine scenery to look at, and stillness deeper than I have ever before enjoyed. My apartments are in a house detached from the larger building, which except at meals and times of business, I intend to frequent but seldom: my window opens into a smooth bowling-green, surrounded with goodly trees, and the thrushes have been singing among them, tho&#x2019; it has rained every moment since I came. Here then I purpose to spend my hours of leisure, to labour hard, and think sweetly of friends that are far away. Here will Jane&#x2019;s letters be perused as they arrive, and many foolish but delightful thoughts about her be entertained. These day-dreams are blessed things at times! And surely it is kind in Nature to give us these images of Heaven when she cannot give us Heaven itself. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Fals&#xf2; queritur de Natur&#xFA;</hi></foreign>;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Falso queritur de natura sua genus humanum, quod imbecilla atque aevi brevis forte potius quam virtute regatur</hi></foreign>&#x201D; [&#x201C;Mankind complain of their nature unjustly, that being frail and of short duration, it is governed rather by chance than virtue&#x201D;].

No! I will dream away, as I look at these beautiful vallies with their sides of rock and their bottoms of emerald verdure; dream of happiness that is not in store for me: the barren reality will come soon enough, but cannot rob me of the pleasure I enjoyed in disbelieving it.</p>
<p>But I must let you go for this time: my paper and my time are done; and stupid and confused as I am what good were it tho&#x2019; I had quires and days at my command? You must write me one of your longest letters the very first hour you can spare after this reaches you. Tell me every thing that you have done and suffered since we parted. Are we not <hi rend="italic">friends</hi>, and to continue so <hi rend="italic">forever</hi>? You smile at my <hi rend="italic">forever</hi>, and tell me of chance and change: but I will hope for better things. Both of us have a thousand faults; but we are both truehearted <pb id="pg-02-365" n="02:365"/>people, both full of obstinacy: so let us trust in each other, and never fear the tricks of Fortune. I shall have no rest till I hear from you: write, therefore, write my kind Jane, as early as you can find a moment&#x2019;s leisure. It will be a pretty affair when I come down in <date when="1823-08-00">August</date>, if you have forgotten me!

<salute>My dear Johnston,</salute>
<p>It is above a month since I began meditating the great project of writing you a letter; but so many things have occurred in the interim that it is not without an effort I accomplish my purpose even now. I have been north and south and east and west, since you wrote to me; bickering with the chagrins of Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>; snatching a taste of the joys of Annandale; admiring the beauties of Perthshire; and at length I am settled in my cell once more, and beginning to resume my ancient habitudes. One of my keenest regrets during the late peregrinations was the impossibility I felt myself under of taking in Broughty-ferry in my route. I had calculated on spending two days with you as I passed: the want of fit conveyances was a difficulty I had never started. But at Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> (Thursday gone a week) I found that means would not by all my ingenuity tally with the end. There was a coach that day directly for Dunkeld; and none, if I went in by you, till the ensuing week. So after much inward contestation I unwillingly gave up my scheme; <pb id="pg-02-366" n="02:366"/>contented myself with wishing all good luck to you as I looked up the valley of Strathmore; hoped we should meet soon under happier omens; and fared onward to the ancient capital of Caledonia,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dunkeld. See <ref target="volume-02/lt-18230617-TC-TM-01">TC to TM, <date when="1823-06-17">17 June</date></ref>.</note> no more a capital, but still the finest looking village in the British empire. Next day I was here, when I thought to have been with you.</p>
<p>Since my arrival I have once or twice been fermenting some wild scheme about meeting one Saturday or another at Cupar Angus;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A town in the center of Strathmore fifteen miles northwest of Dundee.</note> but on serious thought, I find the thing is ludicrous. We must wait till <date when="1823-08-00">August</date>, when I hope again to have a space of freedom, and perhaps to find you as I travel southward, at any rate to find you at the journey&#x2019;s end. Meanwhile, the substitute of visitings, the precious art of writing is still at our command; I beg of you to employ it forthwith in my favour; the chief purpose of my present employment is to persuade you.</p>
<p>Surely the business of the Cupar School is decided ere now. In your favour? or not? or how? These are questions that I want answers to as soon as may be. Tell me all that you are busy with, studying, wishing, dreading; all that one true man gossips to another whom he has long looked on as a friend</p>
<p>I have no news to tell you of Annandale: I staid in it only for nine days. Your friends there, I had occasion to know, are all well; they sent to ask of me (your sister Agnes did) some tidings of you, and I had nothing but what was agreeable to tell. The worthy Mistress of Bogside<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mrs. George Irving.</note> I only saw at Church; the evening, when my Mother and I proposed to cross the moor and visit her, proved rainy; and I came off next day. They are all sorry and surprised that you never write. The general aspect of affairs in our poor fatherland is pitiable, I think, as much as any where else. All people are embarrassed; farmers cannot pay their rents, or employ an artisan beyond the strictest limits of necessity; hence men even with strong and willing arms can hardly earn a bare subsistence, men less fortunate are about beginning to beg. What is to become of them I know not well: the times have been expected to &#x201C;mend&#x201D; any day these thousand years, and they have never mended as they should: I suppose poor mortals must just keep staggering on beneath their burdens, and as Smeal the Blacksmith said &#x201C;do the best they can for a livelihood, boy,&#x201D; till their backs break altogether, and then the weary <foreign><hi rend="italic">day&#x2019;rk</hi></foreign> [day&#x2019;s work] is over. One comfort they have, all will get thro&#x2019; the world <hi rend="italic">some way</hi>; none ever stuck in it <pb id="pg-02-367" n="02:367"/>except Lot&#x2019;s wife, and <hi rend="italic">pillars of Salt</hi> are out of fashion now. It is ever a stranger riddle to me this parti-coloured life of ours: I hope <hi rend="italic">over the water</hi>, things are managed better. Here, I can make nothing of them.</p>
<p>Since my arrival in the valley of the Tay, I have done nothing of importance; scarcely as yet ascertained the nature of my whereabout; tried little to turn its advantages to profit. The wonder at my sloth need not be great: this is the first day of even my usual health, and of what sort that is you already know. I was almost sound while at Mainhill, and greatly I rejoiced; but &#x201C;Diana in the shape of indigestion&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. &#x201C;Diana in the shape of rain,&#x201D; <ref target="volume-01/lt-18190714-TC-RM-01">TC to RM, <date when="1819-07-14">14 July 1819</date></ref>.</note> met me as I traversed Erockstane, and &#x201C;dashed the cup of fame from my brow.&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-02/lt-18221220-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1822-12-20">20 Dec. 1822</date></ref>.</note> I slept none, out of grief I suppose, for a week. Truly this ill-health is a sober business: it crushes the spirit of a man into weakness and blindness and wofulness of every sort; making out of the philosopher a ninny, out of the patient Stoic a wretched driveller, out of the gay humourist &#x201C;a fiery <foreign>ettercap</foreign> a fractious <foreign>chiel</foreign>.&#x201D;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Waverley</hi>, chap. lxiv; meaning, a bad-tempered, fractious person.</note> It is true as people say there is ever something, it may be health or not, that we are anxious to have altered; and man were not perfectible were it otherwise. But the misery of sickness is that you are striving with a difficulty which others feel not; it is a difficulty into the bargain: and so you lose ground in the race of life, and many <foreign>cuddies</foreign> reach the mark before you. It was just so with James Paddy in the celebrated race of Dalton. James failed, not because his feet were lazy,&#x2014;his feet were brothers of the wind; but because Peter on the day before had nourished him with cabbages and sour kail; the Paddyean <hi rend="italic">colon</hi> was seized with unutterable twinges in the middle of the course: hence James had other things to mind than running; hence his competitors passed him as he cowered; and hence tho&#x2019; he started to his legs and ran with the breeches about his ancles,&#x2014;till that necessary garment was rent in twain, the prize was already snatched away, and the glory of Ecclefechan passed off forever! That village had another chance in <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, but this too is lost; Fate has not nourished me with hope, but with the various shapes of pain; thus far from advancing, I can hardly live, and poor Ecclefechan must still sit among the pots<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Ps. 68:13.</note> for aught that I can do to help her. It is very hard: but we cannot help it&#x2014;cannot help it; therefore let it be so. Nevertheless I keep myself busied with many occupations. I am writing a life of Schiller (one part of which <pb id="pg-02-368" n="02:368"/>is already done); and I have engaged to translate a very curious novel of von Goethe&#x2019;s<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meisters Lehrjahre.</hi></note> against next winter. The first I doubt I shall never finish; the second I am just going to begin. Nothing is equal to employment, for driving the Devil out of one: I could easily go mad, if I had nothing better to do; but that is not my case.</p>
<p>I have much to tell you about the beauty of this place, and the ugly qualities of its people: but not now. I expect to be happy, if I be moderately healthy. The Bullers treat me with what Candlewick Mary calls calls [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">the height of discretion</hi>&#x201D;; the boys are are [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] very good fellows, and I have a fair allowance of time at my own disposal. I live apart from the larger house, except at meals and teaching hours; the place is quiet as the grave, and well aired as any could be: these things to me are all in all.</p>
<p>I left Jack at Mainhill translating two little french novels (for the press):<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-02/lt-18230503-TC-JBW-01">TC to JBW, <date when="1823-05-03">3 May</date></ref>; <ref target="volume-02/lt-18230509-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1823-05-09">9 May</date></ref>.</note> he meditated long to come and see you, but could not make it out. A Letter from you to him would be a welcome treat; so would it be to me; there quick with it!</p>

<salute>My dear Friend</salute>
<p>The pleasantest moment I have enjoyed for the last two weeks was when the Post-mistress at Thornhill handed me your letter&#x2014; I had conjectured various causes for your silence; but none that entitled me to take offence&#x2014; I have too proud a consciousness of the place I hold in your remembrance to imagine you could forget me for a single day&#x2014; If ever yo<supplied>[u]</supplied> do you will be very ungrateful for every day and <pb id="pg-02-369" n="02:369"/>every hour of the day I think of you&#x2014; Forget you by August!&#x2014; What an idea! My best Friend! be assured you can never be forgotten while I recollect <hi rend="italic">myself</hi>&#x2014; Your idea is so identified with all my projects and pursuits that it can only be effaced when I have ceased to feel or when my being has undergone a change even worse than annihilation&#x2014; Oh no&#x2014;we shall never forget each other&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">our</hi> friendship is no paltry intimacy, contrived by interest or idleness&#x2014; I am persuaded it was planned by Mother Nature before we saw the light, and founded on a surer basis than fortune or caprice&#x2014; There is no doubt of it&#x2014;&#x201C;we shall be friends <hi rend="italic">for ever</hi>&#x201D;&#x2014; This assurance often comforts me when I have need of consolation&#x2014; These people&#x2019;s heartlessness, in spite of all my efforts to despise it, gives me pain&#x2014; <hi rend="italic">here</hi> indeed&#x2014;I am better treated than past experience gave me leave to hope&#x2014;and if my Grandfather could compliment my Mother without eternally wondering how she came to have a daughter &#x201C;so very short, so very sallow, and altogether so very unlike herself,&#x201D; I believe I should have nothing to complain of&#x2014; But I have less cause to congratulate myself on my reception at Penfillan&#x2014;It was my Father&#x2019;s birthplace,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >According to A. Carlyle, Penfillan, another farmhouse, about a mile from Templand across the River Nith, was the home of Jane&#x2019;s paternal grandfather, John Welsh. He also says: &#x201C;Miss Welsh, in her early years, was sometimes called &#x2018;Pen&#x2019; (from Penfillan) to distinguish her from her Mother&#x2019;s relations, especially from Mrs. Welsh&#x2019;s younger sister &#x2018;Aunt Jeannie.&#x2019; It may be added that Dr. Welsh (Jane&#x2019;s Father) was not born at Penfillan, as Miss Welsh states in this Letter, but at Craigenputtock, as Carlyle discovered at a later date.&#x201D; Carlyle writes in <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi>, I, 141&#x2013;42: &#x201C;John Welsh, my Wife&#x2019;s Father, was born at <hi rend="italic">Craigenputtock</hi> (I now find, which gives the place a new interest to me), &#x2018;<date when="1776-04-04">4th April 1776</date>.&#x2019;&#x2014;little more than eighteen years younger than his father, or than his mother. His first three years or so (probably till <date when="1779-05-26">26th May 1779</date>, when the Parents may have moved to M<supplied>[ilton]</supplied>, in Tynron) must have been passed in those solitudes. &#x2026; <supplied>[He lived about seven years at Milton]</supplied> when (<date when="1785-00-00">1785</date> or 6) the family shifted with him to Penfillan.&#x201D;</note> and when I saw it again, I forgot my former visits there had ended in vexation&#x2014; It was <hi rend="italic">his</hi> Father, his Mother and Sisters I was about to see, and at that moment I could have pardoned their past indifference to my welfare<supplied>[.]</supplied> I could have pardoned even their insensibility to their own irreparable loss, had they but met me with one look of true affection for <hi rend="italic">his</hi> sake. My Grandfather was coming along the avenue&#x2014;he is the very image of my Father, and never did the likeness seem more striking&#x2014;had he received me as <hi rend="italic">he</hi> would have done&#x2014;I should have worship<supplied>[p]</supplied>ed him&#x2014;fool that I was to hope it for a moment&#x2014; He gave me his hand with such a cruel smile! &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Miss Welsh</hi> I&#x2019;m glad to see you&#x2014;how are you M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Welsh&#x2014; I hope your friends are well at Templand&#x2014; I am going to the village on business <hi rend="italic">Ladies</hi>&#x2014;but step on to the house&#x2014;I will be <pb id="pg-02-370" n="02:370"/>with you by and by&#x201D;&#x2014; My God I thought my heart would burst, the strong affection which had sprung to meet him recoiled on it with such a sickening violence&#x2014; But what had <hi rend="italic">I</hi> to expect? his own Wife, his own children are nothing more to him than so many living creatures that must be clothed and nourished with his precious gold&#x2014;even his eldest-born, admired and loved by strangers, was only interesting to <hi rend="italic">him</hi> as the future heir of his possessions&#x2014; I need not wonder at his indifference to <hi rend="italic">me</hi>&#x2014; Nor is this <hi rend="italic">all</hi> that vexes me&#x2014; I have revolved it in my mind a thousand times whether I should acquaint you with the rest&#x2014; The disclosure must lower me in <hi rend="italic">your</hi> esteem, the concealment in my <hi rend="italic">own</hi>&#x2014; it is so hard to discover all my weakness to the <hi rend="italic">one</hi> in the world whose approbation I most desire, and it is equally hard to endure your commendations while conscious that I better deserve your censure&#x2014; I have chosen that alternative which seems the most consistent with the character of our friendship. You shall know <hi rend="italic">the whole</hi>&#x2014;cost me what it may&#x2014;</p>
<p>About a twelvemonth since, I was annoyed with a nonsensical proposal from a Gentleman of my acquaintance<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. Fyffe. See <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi>, I, 70&#x2013;71.</note>&#x2014; To reject it was my immediate decision&#x2014;but <hi rend="italic">how</hi> required a little longer thought&#x2014; To refuse him in the usual <hi rend="italic">form</hi>, I knew by experience, was to break with him for ever, and this I was desirous to avoid&#x2014;the kindly feelings I entertained for the young man, and our neighbourhood which exposed us to continual meetings would have rendered any coldness betwixt us painful and inconvenient&#x2014; to discard the matter as a serious jest appeared to me the most delicate way of expressing my aversion to his project, and the way least likely to disturb the friendliness of our intercourse&#x2014; the plan seemed to succeed&#x2014;he refrained from any expression of particular regard, and continued to meet me as cordially as ever&#x2014; For a whole year I applauded myself on having effected what women so seldom are able to effect&#x2014;on having retained as a friend the man I had rejected as a lover&#x2014; but at last my sins against the etiquette of prudence were revenged by the discovery that he loved me more than ever&#x2014; He was about to leave this country, and one day that I was alone he came to tell us his intention&#x2014; his look and manner betrayed excessive agitation&#x2014;he was pale and red by turns&#x2014;spoke loud and fast, one moment, and the next was scarcely able to articulate&#x2014; I talked of every thing I could think of to divert him; but my efforts were received with such a look of suffering and reproach that I felt at last ashamed of seeming cheerful&#x2014; We spoke <pb id="pg-02-371" n="02:371"/>of his departure&#x2014; &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">you do not care whether I go or stay</hi>&#x201D; he said in such a tone! I answered he was mistaken, that he had not an acquaintance in Eastlothian that would regret his going more than I should&#x2014; &#x201C;An acquaintance&#x201D;! he repeated &#x201C;and is that all? Jane Jane&#x201D;&#x2014;he sprang from his seat beside me and throwing himself on a couch at the other end of the room, sobbed as if his heart would burst&#x2014; You cannot imagine how I felt&#x2014; it was so easy to make him happy for the time! one word, one look of kindness had been enough&#x2014;and I was with<supplied>[h]</supplied>eld by every consideration of the future from any effort to alleviate his distress&#x2014; The sense of his own weakness and the fear of exciting my contempt seemed ready to turn his head&#x2014;he swore I made him weaker than any child&#x2014;stormed through the room, talking with violence on the most trivial matters, and completed my dismay with a fit of laughter that made every drop of blood in me stand still&#x2014; I had stood his tears with tolerable firmness, but his frightful mirth entirely overcame me&#x2014; forgetful of every thing but pity and terror I threw my arms about his neck and besought him to be himself&#x2014; The instant this frantic action was committed, I was aware of its imprudence&#x2014; I perceived I had inspired him with a hope I never meant to realize&#x2014; I hesitated how to undeceive him&#x2014; I trembled at the idea of again witnessing his despair, and while I stood silent and irresolute in an unlucky moment we were interrupted, and the possibility of explaining precluded for the time&#x2014; I saw him the following day&#x2014;it was our last interview in private&#x2014; A circumstance had occur<supplied>[r]</supplied>ed to change his plans&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">he did not go</hi>&#x2014; He gave me no opportunity of expressing my mind and I had not courage enough to seek one&#x2014; once only when we were talking of my absence he entreated me to write to him&#x2014; at first I positively refused, till it occur<supplied>[r]</supplied>ed to me I could explain myself best in writing, and then I said with emphasis yes I would write&#x2014; my manner seemed to alarm him&#x2014;he fixed his eyes on my face and said hurriedly with a terrible effort at composure, &#x201C;take care Miss Welsh&#x2014;take care <hi rend="italic">Jane</hi> what you do&#x2014;write to me as to one who loves you more than his own being&#x2014;who has no hope, no wish that is not bound up in your single self&#x2014;or do not write at all&#x2014; My God! the hour that brings me another such letter as your last will be the last of my existence&#x2014;&#x201D; I felt all the importance of the moment; yet I heard him say &#x2018;God bless you&#x2019; saw him linger as he left the room, saw the door close behind him&#x2014;without having power to utter a single word&#x2014;</p>
<p>And now my confession is made&#x2014;and what must you think of it? &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Your noble Jane</hi>&#x201D;! will you call me so any more?&#x2014;how weak how ridiculous must I appear to you! fancying myself so wise, I might disdain <pb id="pg-02-372" n="02:372"/>the <hi rend="italic">forms</hi> of prudence, and acting like any boardingschool idiot of fifteen!&#x2014; I have simply told the particulars of my conduct&#x2014;without commenting on its errors or its effects&#x2014;yet I am fearfully sensible of both&#x2014; It is plain I have given a sort of tacit consent to this Man&#x2019;s pretensions or at best encouragement to his hopes&#x2014;and therefore that my honour is concerned in realizing them&#x2014; But it is as plain to myself, that I have not fortitude for such an act of self-devotion&#x2014;that I cannot, cannot sacrifice my liberty and all my brilliant visions for the future for any consideration whatsoever&#x2014; How I may extricate myself from the situation to which my want of firmness and decision has reduced me, I think I see&#x2014;but how I may preserve the happiness of this unlucky being who has placed his destiny at my disposal, God only knows!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Write soon soon&#x2014;your letters always give me a new being&#x2014; Befal me what may I cannot be utterly wretched while I have such a friend&#x2014;</p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Knowing that you always like to hear of me, and having a vacant hour this evening I gladly set myself to get ready a small letter for <pb id="pg-02-373" n="02:373"/>you, which the Post may take down to-morrow on his return to Dunkeld, which he leaves for us the one day, and goes back to the next. I also want very much to hear from home, and this letter may operate as a spur on the diligence of my beloved and valuable correspondents at Mainhill. There is a small blank made in the sheet&#x2014;for a purpose which you will notice. I beg of you to accept the little picture which fills it, without any murmuring: it is a poor testimonial of the grateful love I should ever bear you. If I hope to get the moderate command of money in the course of my life&#x2019;s operations, I long for it chiefly, that I may testify to those dear to me what affection I entertain for them. In the mean time we ought to be thankful that we have never known what it was to be in fear of want, but have always had wherewith to gratify one another by these little acts of kindness, which are worth more than millions unblest by a true feeling between the giver and receiver. You must buy yourself any little odd thing you want; and think I enjoy it along with you if it add to your comfort. I do indeed enjoy it with you: I should be a dog if I did not. I am grateful to you for kindness and true affection such as no other heart will ever feel for me: I am proud of my Mother, tho&#x2019; she is neither rich nor learned; if ever I forget to love and reverence her, I must cease to be a creature myself worth remembering. Often, my dear Mother, in solitary pensive moments does it come across me like the cold shadow of death, that we two must part in the course of time! I shudder at this thought; and find no refuge except in humbly trusting that the Great God will surely appoint us a meeting in that far country towards which we are tending. May He bless you forever, My good Mother! and keep up in your heart those sublime hopes which at present serve as a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night to guide your footsteps thro&#x2019; the wilderness of life.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Exod. 13:21.</note> We are in His hands: He will not utterly forsake us; let us trust in Him.</p>
<p>I have no news of myself to send you, except what are good. The Boys are going on very fairly with me, they are excellent creatures in the main. With the rest of the family I am on the best footing; we talk together cheerfully whenever we meet; they shew themselves anxious to promote my comfort by every rational arrangement; when with them I forget that there is any difference in our worldly rank. They have their wealth and birth and connections and accomplishments to brag of; I too have my little stock of vanities within my<supplied>[sel]</supplied>f, <pb id="pg-02-374" n="02:374"/>and taking up but a small space of the ground on which w<supplied>[e live,]</supplied> I feel no fears about defending the rights of that against all deadly. My <supplied>[health]</supplied> was scarcely so good as you saw it, for some days after I arrived. The air is pure as may be, and I am quiet as when at home; but I did not sleep well for some nights, and began to fear I was again going down the hill. On considering what the matter might be, it struck me that it perhaps was my dining so late (at 5 o&#x2019;clock) and fasting so long before dinner. This idea was no sooner started than converted into activity: a new regulation took place instantly; and now, except on Sabbath-days, when from choice I eat with the family, my meals are served up in a very comfortable manner, at the hours I myself selected. The Boys and I are up at Breakfast a little before nine; we begin work half an hour after it, continuing till one; then I go out and walk or smoke or amuse myself till half past two, when dinner is waiting for me in the parlour; after which teaching recommences till near five; and then I am free as air for the night. I go into my own room and do whatsoever seemeth me good; I go out of it and walk or sometimes ride upon Charlies horse; and Denovan the smart whisking and very trustworthy Butler has a dish of tea standing ready for me at seven. I made him get a pound of the chinese weed for my own special behoof, to eke out the rather scanty dole of <hi rend="italic">Missus</hi>; he keeps it in his own archives, and now the tea is as good to the full &#x201C;as ought in Ecclefechan,&#x201D; or near it. By this means, I have brought myself round again, and so long as moderately healthy, I feel perfectly comfortable. I like the arrangement also because I get more time to myself and am less restricted in my movements. I have begun translating the German work<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister.</hi></note> which Jack knows of: I am busy, I shall be healthy, and in the mean time I am as comfortable as I could hope to be. Now, My dear Mother, I have given you a full account of all my goings on: it is but fair that I should ask a similar one of yours. I do not hurry <hi rend="italic">you</hi> for letters, knowing how you are situated; but Jack and Sandy must absolutely bestir themselves. Let them take a long sheet the very day after this arrives, and fill it between them. The lazy villains! What are they thinking of? One of my earliest letters shall be to my <supplied>[worthy]</supplied> father; to whom in the meantime my kindest <supplied>[love. Rem]</supplied>ember me as a Brother to all the rest, great an<supplied>[d small.]</supplied> <closer><salute>I am ever, Your affe son,</salute></closer></p>

<p>The Newspaper came two days ago, and glad was I to see it. I read it over from beginning to end; not even the advertisements escaped me.

<salute>My dear Jane,</salute>
<p>There must certainly be a spice of the sturdy Beggar in me, else I should not feel so impatient to get news of you. Never did woman write so faithfully to man so unworthy as you have long done to me; yet still my craving is unsatisfied, my cry is still: Give! Give! Yesterday at noon I was standing by the parlour-window, looking at these craggy mountains and the fleecy clouds, and wondering if Jane was well and happy, when the old grey Postman came pattering along the gravel on the outside of his nimble Shelty,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A. Carlyle quotes <hi rend="italic">Hudibras</hi>, I, vii, 405&#x2013;6: &#x201C;But first, with nimble active force, / He got on th&#x2019;outside of his horse.&#x201D;</note> bearing as usual his miscellaneous bag of tidings, his news of deaths and news of weddings, his matters spiritual and matters temporal, pieces of fine sentiment stuffed in beside bakers&#x2019; and buthchers&#x2019; bills, and all his long tag-rag of etceteras; himself the while minding no jot about the whole of them, calculating only when the devil he <hi rend="italic">should</hi> get to Aberfeldy thro&#x2019; these cursed roads. I thought anxiously if peradventure he brought no packet <pb id="pg-02-376" n="02:376"/>out of Nithsdale? Two minutes more resolved my query: the particoloured gentleman came smirking and scraping in with a large letter, which I knew to be from you! I nearly overset the particoloured gentleman, in my haste to reach my own apartment. Such a letter was worth waiting thro&#x2019; a twelvemonth for: since then, I have thought of nothing earthly else. You are kinder to me than I shall ever be able to repay. No! my own Jane, I never never shall forget you, but love you better and more dearly all the days of my existence. None ever more deserved it.</p>
<p>In my repeated studies of your letter, no part of it escaped me: I need scarcely say with what attention I perused your clear and candid narrative of that disagreeable affair,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Concerning Dr. Fyffe.</note> which has vexed you so much. I am more than proud that you thought it necessary to disclose it to me, and had the firmness to disclose it so plainly. Such conduct is like your true and guileless self: if we both follow that manner of proceeding constantly, suspicion will not find a place between us, to disturb the harmony of our affection: I honour you for what you have done, and hope I might in a similar case be able to imitate what I honour. The matter itself I have maturely considered; and far from blaming you, I but love you the more for what was meant so well, tho&#x2019; it has turned out so oppositely. You have in fact been guilty of nothing, except it be a crime to despise all coquetry, and to feel for the pain you are giving to a heart that loves you. If your endeavours have failed, the fault rests not with you, or at worst consists but in a want of cold calculation, the error into which your frank and generous nature is ever aptest to hurry you, and which I should pity myself if I did not rather respect than censure. Cease then to regard this unlucky business as a cause of self-accusation: whatever becomes of it, you are innocent as even I could wish you; dearer to me than you were, because I see in it a new proof of that warmth of heart and fearless upright simplicity for which I have always loved you. You are my own noble Jane still, and will ever be so.</p>
<p>The past then is right;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle had added &#x201C;and closed&#x201D; here and then canceled out the words.</note> the future may require more consideration. One thing is clear to me as the light of day, that you ought to explain the matter fully to the young man, without losing a moment. Whatever you may dread from the violence of his temper, the danger is increasing every moment that you leave him any hope, however slight; perhaps even the slighter the worse. Your own mind is irrevocably made up (<hi rend="italic">is</hi> it not?) [<hi rend="italic">is</hi> underscored twice]; and this you are bound to let <pb id="pg-02-377" n="02:377"/>him know distinctly and at once whatever may betide. For your friend, unfortunate as he is and apparently a very amiable man, I should be a savage if I did not feel deep sympathy: I see that your letter must fall upon him like a thunderbolt and leave him crushed as if forever. But if managed rightly, the effect will not be what you fear. Much of the torment arising out of these disasters is in all cases derived from the injury done to the pride of the sufferer as well as to his affections. Of course in your mildest and kindest manner, you will strive to spare him all that needless pain. Admire him, praise him, be his sister, any thing but his mistress. The latter, above all, let him see that it is not in the power of fate itself to make you. Thus cut off from every shadow of hope, the young man will be very wretched for a season: but he will at length have discovered truly the ground he stands on, imagination will no longer have the power to tempt and irritate and dupe him; whatever force is in him will rally to his aid; if silly he will most probably do his best to hate you; if a man of sense he will like you more reasonably than he did, but not a whit the less; any way you will soon be forever clear of his love, for love without some hope more or less is a plant rooted out from the soil where it grew, it withers in a single day. This young man is not like others, if the whole fortune of his life is set upon one single cast. He must have ambitions and wishes of many kinds, which this affliction will not ruin. Point these out to him if you know them: they will assert their own claims tho&#x2019; you do not. In six weeks, unless he is excessively idle, or has a mind far weaker or far stronger than any man I have ever met with, I prophecy that he will look upon the whole transaction with composure; in twelve months it will be faded into distance,&#x2014;a chasm, the widest among the many which disfigure life&#x2019;s journey, but soften<supplied>[e]</supplied>d from its horrors by the space that intervenes into a kind of melancholy beauty which it may always retain. I know, some men have done rash and terrible deeds in cases like this; but these men have had weak heads and wild hearts, and almost always they have had foul play. This friend of yours is in none of these predicaments: if you explain to him the genuine motives of your conduct, he will see that it has been spotless as an angel&#x2019;s; and without the feeblest expectation of any unnatural revenge to goad him on, he will have sense to perceive that &#x201C;the last moment of his existence&#x201D; is still at a considerable distance. God help him! poor fellow&#x2014;I say it in truth and sincerity: he will be very miserable for a week or two, but that will be the worst of it.</p>
<p>On the whole, my dear Jane, I could wish that you had done with <pb id="pg-02-378" n="02:378"/>this vexatious business. I shall be on thorns till I hear what has become of it. If you like my advice, get it put in execution without delay, and tell me that the whole is over. I am indeed very impudent to set up for advising you in a concern which you know so much better how to manage of yourself: but I feel a deep anxiety about it, for many reasons which I need not state; and what one feels about one must be speaking of. I have already filled your sheet with it: no more of it <hi rend="italic">now</hi>!</p>
<p>I am sorry that you find so little that is worthy of you in Dumfries-shire. Do not vex yourself, my dear kind-hearted Jane, about the shallow people of Penfillan. Your Father&#x2019;s memory lives in a shrine more worthy of it than hearts like theirs. I never saw him that I might have honoured him; but his character they tell me is still to be traced in yours, as certainly his watchful care for the formation of your mind and his unwearied love are visible in their effects: cherish the thought of so noble and so dear a man; cherish it, my Jane, within the secret cell of your own bosom, and heed not how vulgar mortals feel regarding it: if you ever think <hi rend="italic">me</hi> worthy of the highest honour, you will let me unite with you in that most sacred of all your sentiments. My poor Jane!&#x2014; But there is a life beyond this vale of tears, where souls that were made for love and for each other shall meet and never part any more.</p>
<p>I had many thousands of things to say, but I am got into a mood too solemn for talking of such matters. It is long past mid-night; darkness and stillness are over the face of this world; the shadows of the other come hovering round one&#x2019;s mind. No more to-night! May good angels watch over your pillow, may the Great Father of all forever bless you, my best my bosom friend! <foreign><hi rend="italic">A Dieu</hi>!</foreign></p>
<name>Th: Carlyle.</name>
<ps><p>Thursday-morning, 12<hi rend="italic">th</hi>.&#x2014; This is far too tragical a mode of writing, it will never do. Next time I shall be as merry as any Lark&#x2014;as I ought to be, for I am happy here, at least happy when I talk to <hi rend="italic">you</hi>. I am also a fool to write so soon; I might have had the <hi rend="italic">better word</hi> of you for a week to come, now I must sit piping and pining reckoning how many days it will be till you shall please to give me anothers alms. But you will not be <hi rend="italic">very</hi> long; that I know. Write to me all the sense or nonsense that is in your head, mind not what or how.</p>
<p>I finished your Musaeus ten days ago: it is a nice little book and will do very well. You shall have it at Had<supplied>[dingto]</supplied><hi rend="italic">n</hi> whenever you get there, with multifarious advices and palavers. I am beginning <pb id="pg-02-379" n="02:379"/>Meister, but getting very slowly on. Next time I will tell you all. I have been sick and sleepless, otherwise very happy; now I am recovering. You must ride <hi rend="italic">every day</hi>. Be merry, and love me. God bless you.</p></ps>

<salute>My dear Murray,</salute>
<p>In due time I was favoured with your letter,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dated <date when="1823-06-03">3 June</date>.</note> the first I had received since my arrival; the first tangible proof, that in removing from the country of all my friends, I had not also removed from their recollections. Finding the commissions you had undertaken all discharged with your accustomed kindness and fidelity, I had nothing farther to do but abandon myself to the cheerful feelings, with which your articles of news and speculation and other curious and pleasant matter naturally enough inspired me. Your letters have a charm to me independently of their intrinsic merit; they are letters of my first and oldest correspondent; they carry back the mind to old days&#x2014;days in themselves perhaps not greatly better than those now passing over us&#x2014;but invested by the kind treachery of Imagination with hues which nothing present can equal. If I have any fault to find with you, it is in the very excess of what renders any correspondence agreeable; the excess of your complaisance, the too liberal oblations which you offer at the shrine of other people&#x2019;s vanity.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Murray had written that Dr. David Irving of the Advocates&#x2019; Library had recently asked about Carlyle and that &#x201C;the extensive information and stupendous intellect of the gentleman in question made the D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> be more than usually inquisitive and minute.&#x201D; At the end of the letter he had written: &#x201C;You and I are now very old friends and very old correspondents, and I trust that the connexion which for nearly thirty years, <foreign><hi rend="italic">quando mortalis aevi spatium</hi></foreign> [as mortal life extends into eternity], has obtained between us, will never be laid aside and will be cherished till the latest period of our lives. It never can be laid aside. <hi rend="italic">I</hi> would make any sacrifice to obtain <hi rend="italic">your</hi> notice&#x2014; I know not any who understands your principles and feelings more thoroughly&#x2014;and the esteem and admiration both with regard to your heart &#x26; your talents which I entertain makes it quite impossible that our connexion should ever cease. Do therefore my dear Sir write me soon, and tell me minutely about your arrangements and <hi rend="italic">health</hi>.&#x201D;</note> I might object to this with more asperity, did I not consider that flattery is in truth the sovereign emollient, the true oil of life, by which the joints of the great social machine, often stiff and rusty enough, are kept from grating and made to play sweetly to and fro; hence that if you pour it on, a thought too <pb id="pg-02-380" n="02:380"/>lavishly, it is an error on the safe side, an error which proceeds from the native warmness of your heart, and ought not to be quarrelled with too sharply, not at least by one who profits tho&#x2019; unduly by the commission of it. So I will submit to be treated as a kind of slender genius, since my friend will have it so: our intercourse will fare but little worse on that account. We have now as you say known each other long, and never I trust seen ought to make us feel ashamed of that relation: I calculate that succeeding years will but more firmly establish our connection, strengthening with the force of habit and the memory of new kind offices what has a right to subsist without these aids. Some time hence, when you are seated in your peaceful manse, you at one side of the parlour fire, <hi rend="italic">Mrs</hi> M. at the other, and two or three little M&#x2019;s, fine chubby urchins, hopping about the carpet, you will suddenly observe the door fly open, and a tall meagre care-worn figure stalk forward, his grim countenance lightened by unusual smiles, in the certainty of meeting with a cordial welcome. This knight of the rueful visage will in fact mingle with the group for a season; and be merry as the merriest, tho&#x2019; his looks are sinister. I warn you to make provision for such emergencies. In process of time, I too must have my own peculiar hearth; wayward as my destiny has hitherto been, perplexed and solitary as my path of life still is, I never cease to reckon on yet paying scot and lot on my own footing. Like the men of Glasgow I shall have &#x201C;a house <hi rend="italic">within myself</hi>&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly a reference to something said by William Graham and David Hope. &#x201C;Scot and lot&#x201D; is the rates assessment applied to those householders who were ratepayers. At this time they were entitled to a parliamentary vote.</note> (what tremendous <foreign><hi rend="italic">abdomina</hi></foreign> we householders have!) with every suitable appurtenance, before all is done; and when friends are met, there is little chance that Murray will be forgotten. We shall talk over old times, compare old hopes with new fortune; and secure comfort by Sir John Sinclair&#x2019;s<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sir John Sinclair (<date when="1754-00-00">1754</date>&#x2013;<date when="1835-00-00">1835</date>), Scottish writer on finance, agriculture, and military subjects. His best-known work is <hi rend="italic">Statistical Account of Scotland</hi>, 21 vols. (<date when="1791-00-00">1791</date>&#x2013;<date when="1799-00-00">99</date>). In <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi>, II, 174&#x2013;75, Carlyle recalls meeting him in <date when="1825-03-00">March 1825</date>.</note> celebrated recipe, by <hi rend="italic">being comfortable</hi>. These are certainly brave times: would they could only be persuaded to come on a little faster!</p>
<p>But I must quit empty imagining, and set before you some specific &#x201C;facts.&#x201D; You want to be informed how I spend my time here, and what novelties I have discovered in the country of the Celts. As to my time, it passes in the most jocund and unprofitable manner you can figure. I have no professional labour to encounter that deserves being named; I am excellently lodged, and experience nothing but suitable treatment <pb id="pg-02-381" n="02:381"/>in all points. There are plenty of books too, and paper and geese; there are mountains of mica-slate, and woods and green pastures and clear waters and azure skies to look at: I read, or write and burn, at rare intervals; I go scampering about on horseback; or lie down by the grassy slopes of the Tay, and look at Schiehallion and Bengloe<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Schiehallion is a mountain in Perthshire four miles SE of Loch Raymond, 3,547 feet above sea level. Bengloe (from the Gaelic meaning &#x201C;the hazy mountain&#x201D;) is a mountain range in Blair Atholl parish, Perthshire, which rises from a vast base to five peaks, the highest of which is 3,671 feet.</note> with their caps of snow, and all the ragged monsters that keep watch around them, since the creation never stirring from their post; I dream all kinds of empyrean dreams, and live as idly as if I were a considerable proprietor of land. Such work of course will never do, at the long run; and pity that it will not, for it passes very smoothly: but I strive to still my conscience when it murmurs, by persuading it that &#x201C;the poor man is getting back his health.&#x201D; An arrant lie! for I am not getting back my health, I do not think I shall ever more be healthy: nor does it matter greatly. By and by I shall have learned to go on very quietly without that convenience. I am fast training to it; already I can for hours abst<supplied>[ract]</supplied> myself from all remembrance of the beastly process of digestion, and work <supplied>[as]</supplied> if nothing ailed me. In consequence of this invaluable art I am getting recon<supplied>[ciled]</supplied> to this thrice cursed stomach; as a man gets accustomed to a scolding wife with whom, tho he hates her with all his soul, he must contrive as best he can to jog on in company till they reach their journey&#x2019;s end. I design accordingly to keep this miserable organ in me (not to tear it out and scatter it to the winds, as I once purposed) all the days of my appointed time: when I have done with it, I should strongly recommend that it be given as a rich legacy to the Devil with injunctions to employ it constantly, an arrangement that could not fail very greatly to heighten the charms of that ancient gentleman&#x2019;s <foreign><hi rend="italic">mani&#xE8;re d&#x2019;etre</hi></foreign>. This is ungrateful, and impious were it seriously meant. I am in fact much healthier than I was, and gathering strength, tho&#x2019; slowly and with frequent relapses. One of these I am at present labouring under; and that makes me talk so wildly.</p>
<p>You must come and see this Country the first month, you have at your own disposal. Dunkeld is about the prettiest village I ever beheld.

<p>My paper is done, or I was going to have told you multitudes of things besides. I beg you will write me soon, some leisure hour, and let me have another chance at talking.

How is it with the Earl of Stair,<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably the subject of Murray&#x2019;s biographical studies, but it is uncertain which Earl.</note> and with the world in general? Except for a Dumfries Courier and a daily Times, I might as well be living in the fifth Belt of Jupiter. <foreign>Adieu!</foreign>&#x2014; <closer><salute>Truly your&#x2019;s</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Jack,</salute>
<p>I was more obliged to you than would be readily believed for the letter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dated <date when="1823-06-20">20 June</date>.</note> I got to-day. Well it was for both of us, that it came so in the nick of time. Wearied out with repeated disappointments, chagrined above all that the newspaper even the newspaper came not on the day appointed, I sat down last night and penned a large epistle one half of which consisted of complaints and invocations, and entreaties that you would write to me, tho&#x2019; the worst news in the world, without the loss of another second. There is no end to the tricks of imagination: <pb id="pg-02-383" n="02:383"/>I knew it to be nonsense in my head, yet could not persuade my heart that all was well with you. Sickness or impending ruin to some of those so dear to me would at times scarcely have appeared surprising tidings: I could not keep my thoughts in the sunshine do what I would; I reckoned myself undoubtedly among the &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">childring</hi> of misfortune.&#x201D; All this would ere now have been travelling towards you, as fast as sixteen legs could bear it, had not your letter come in time. Never be so tedious again my kind calligrapher: good luck has saved you this time; the obnoxious letter has been sentenced to the flames for once; but do not hope that fortune will always favour you so highly. Recollect your promise <hi rend="italic">to write once a fortnight</hi>, and see that you keep it to the very letter. It is with the hope of hearing from you within that period that I am scribbling at present: see you disappoint me not!</p>
<p>With such wan and haggard harbingers, which it scattered as the rear of darkness<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Milton, &#x201C;L&#x2019;Allegro,&#x201D; l. 50.</note> by the Sun, Jack&#x2019;s honest <foreign><hi rend="italic">gawsie</hi></foreign> [large] letter did not fail to get a warm reception. Delivered from imaginary panics, I farther enjoyed the solid satisfaction which the detail of his unassuming patience and praiseworthy conduct naturally afforded me. Really, my good Jack, you are a very decent and sponsible man. Often in winter, when Satanas in the shape of bile was heavy on me, I have said cruel things to thee, and bitterly tho&#x2019; vainly do I recollect them: yet at bottom I hope you have never doubted that I loved you and was satisfied sometimes proud of your conduct. There is no thing in the world more interesting than the sight of a poor youth destitute of common claims to respect, yet smit with the love of knowledge, and pressing forward in spite of every difficulty to attain it. There are few passions in our nature which when strong do not become respectable: but this in itself is among the noblest: well for him in whom it has the rule! Therefore, Jack, I am every way pleased to find that you persist with so much industry, in your multifarious studies and employments. Relax not, my gallant fellow, betide what may: the full reward may be distant, but you ought to think it sure. In the shape of plenty and every species of respect, it cannot fail, with your advantages if wisely husbanded, to meet you at last. In <hi rend="italic">those</hi> days many things will happen, much will be said and done, which I may not speak of now. Jack with his house and fit appurtenances, his medical and philosophic fame; and I to say: this strong-built gentleman is of <hi rend="italic">my</hi> training! These are dreams, in which I rock myself at times; and I trust them to you, having full confidence in your discretion, which I know a little well-earned praise will not seduce from its post. Whatever men may say <pb id="pg-02-384" n="02:384"/>or sing to you, your first care will be to qualify yourself, sedulously as if you were an utter dunce, for earning an honourable livelihood; and along with this to unfold the faculties of your mind whether they be great or small. The two pursuits <hi rend="italic">are</hi> abundantly compatible in your case: of this I entertain no particle of doubt; nor will you, two years hence. I have repeatedly summed up your <hi rend="italic">pros</hi> and <hi rend="italic">cons</hi>, and the former greatly prevail. I tell you there is no danger: you will ultimately look down on the highest point of what you now look up to. Therefore be of good cheer, Jack; and fear no weather!</p>
<p>I am glad to learn that Buffon excites you: it is what I anticipated. Read him well.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >It is clear from a letter to Carlyle, <date when="1823-06-20">20 June</date>, that John had been reading Buffon&#x2019;s work <hi rend="italic">The Natural History of Animals, Vegetables, and Minerals</hi>, trans. W. Kendrick and others, 3 vols. (London, <date when="1775-00-00">1775</date>). See also <ref target="volume-02/lt-18230509-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1823-05-09">9 May</date></ref>.</note> Your account of Locke is also perfectly correct: he will furnish you with matter for many and profound reflections. The pious Eneas<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably a reference to the &#x201C;pius Aeneas&#x201D; of Vergil, used here to mean &#x201C;the conventionally virtuous man&#x201D; or &#x201C;the unthinking prig.&#x201D;</note> never understood half a chapter of him, and may easily miss ever doing so. Locke requires to be thought and pondered over: as good to sleep or chew the cud, as merely <hi rend="italic">read</hi> him. For the rest, do not vex yourself about his <hi rend="italic">secondary qualities</hi>. I meditated now and then for three years on that subject, before I could attach even half an idea to the words. Nor was my half idea of any value when I had it: Locke is now generally admitted to have involved the affair of colour in needless mysteries by the use of mere phrases that astonish in the dark, but in the light are changed as from formidable spectres into gate-posts and bushes of broom.&#x2014; You cannot better recreate and improve yourself at once than by reading Shakespear, or any of the classics of English literature. Stick also to the German and Greek, not neglecting the medical latin. Your translations, which I see are prospering, may well lie till I come down: I have hopes of seeing you, before the task can be finished.</p>
<p>My own life is much idler than yours: but it is far from uncomfortable, and that in my state is much. Tell our kind-hearted mother that I have a fire <hi rend="italic">every</hi> night, and all things that I want supplied to me abundantly. My health is certainly improving: to-day is about the best day I have had; and certainly I have not been so well for twelve-months. On the whole I sleep very decently; what in winter I should have called excellently. By care and good treatment I shall yet be well as ever I was. The last five years will live in my remembrance to all Eternity!</p>
<p>We have no incidents in our menage.

Both are uniformly civil, even kind, to me. We have got two visitors from the south with us at present; Anna Pole and Reginald Pole<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Reginald Pole (<date when="1801-00-00">1801</date>&#x2013;<date when="1894-00-00">94</date>) was a friend of Richard Buller, cousin of Charles and Arthur. He graduated from Exeter College, Oxford, B.A. in <date when="1822-00-00">1822</date>, M.A. in <date when="1826-00-00">1826</date>. He was the rector of Sheviocke, <date when="1825-00-00">1825</date>&#x2013;<date when="1839-00-00">39</date>, and of St. Mary Tavy, Davon, <date when="1826-00-00">1826</date>&#x2013;<date when="1839-00-00">39</date>, and subsequently of Yeovilton, Somerset. His sister was Anna Maria Pole.</note> her brother: but they produce no change in our mode of life. The lady is fully arrived at the years of discretion, at least if these are under thirty; she is good-humoured, understands all cookery from the mixing of water gruel up to the composition of the choicest curry; she has a cornelian necklace, and kind blue eyes, and a bit <foreign><hi rend="italic">nimble-gawn</hi></foreign> [nimble-going] tongue. Reginald has been at Oxford&#x2014;studying the nature of horses. Philosophy is all a hum&#x2014;but the short back and the shoulder and the hands of height and the price and the speed&#x2014;these <hi rend="italic">are</hi> the points for a future parson of the English Church. He often reminds me of Esbie;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Squire Esbie. See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18211109-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1821-11-09">9 Nov. 1821</date></ref>.</note> but he is less in stature than Esbie (less than five statutefeet); less in conceitedness; and if possible less in general knowledge and useful talent. Both are pleasant people to sip a morsel of dishwater tea beside, one evening in the week; and that is all I have to do with them. My own boys in general behave admirably well to me; and not <hi rend="italic">very</hi> ill to themselves</p>
<p>I read a little, for diversion chiefly; and translate a little a very little of von Goethe. I never was so idle: but the recovery of health is at last come to seem the most important of all earthly considerations to me; and at present I make it my chief concern&#x2014;that is so far as I have any real concern at all. Under this fierce climate and among these beautiful scenes, I am at no loss to pass my time with profit to my body if not my mind. I wander by the copses on the shores of the Tay, or stroll over these black interminable solitary moors behind the mountain tops, and meditate on many foolish things. One of my chief <foreign><hi rend="italic">desiderata</hi></foreign> at present is a horse. A thousand times have I repented that I did not take Alick&#x2019;s with me. Tell him strictly not to part with it till he see me. I can find none here that will answer; and no saddle is to be had under the price of a <hi rend="italic">head</hi> man &#x201C;three pounds.&#x201D; The night before last I dismissed a poney that I had on trial: it was dear and unruly. I now think of putting off as I am till <date when="1823-08-00">August</date>; and then buying Alick&#x2019;s black, with some secondhand saddle&#x2014;which I wish Alick would try to <foreign><hi rend="italic">spier</hi> out</foreign> [inquire] for me. Does the boy go on with his grammar? Tell him I can well excuse his silence; but long greatly for his vigorous <pb id="pg-02-386" n="02:386"/>tho&#x2019; rugged letter. He is a true fellow, and will do exploits yet in his own career. How is it with our Mother and Father? I intended writing to my Father, but had begun to you before I was aware. Be kind to our Mother, Jack; she well deserves it at our hands. If there is aught that I can do for her, you will oblige me truly by mentioning it. Write within ten days after this arrives; yourself, unless you can persuade Alick or some of them to take a hand along with you. Write all your <foreign><hi rend="italic">Thun und Lassen</hi></foreign> [doings], not minding what or how. My kindest love to all the <foreign><hi rend="italic">childer</hi></foreign>. Be a diligent and sturdy-minded Pan: love me constantly, and believe that I so love you.</p>

<salute>My dear Jane,</salute>
<p>I am in a wonderful anxiety to hear from you, and have been for several days. By the almanack, it is just three weeks since I had my last letter: by my imagination, it is half an age. If I knew certainly that you were still in Nithsdale, your patience would likely be assailed with a long epistle from me: but it is one advantage of these jaunts (which you otherwise dislike so much) that your enemies cannot tell where to find you; that I the deadliest of them know not whether to point my soporific arrows against you to the south or the southeast. Good luck has delivered you for this time; but I warn you to be on your guard again. You promised to write to me <hi rend="italic">once a week</hi>&#x2014; No, you did not promise; but you are a kind angel of a creature, you will write to me whenever you can, and that is all I want. Give no heed to me when I become importunate.</p>
<p>Unable to accelerate the arrival of your letter, I have bethought me of discharging a duty which I owe you, and procuring to myself at the same time the pleasure of an hour or two&#x2019;s conversation with you; a species of entertainment which, unless I attend to it better, will <pb id="pg-02-387" n="02:387"/>ere long have grown to be a necessary of life. Then, if you take one of your frolicks, and cut off my supplies, and I perish of want! But no! my own Jane will never forsake me; she is the friend of my soul forever and ever, she is <hi rend="italic">mine</hi>, and I am hers, and we will love one another thro&#x2019; all the changes of chance and time. &#x201C;Brave words, Sir!&#x201D; you observe: &#x201C;but now to business.&#x201D; Well here it is.</p>
<p>Poor <hi rend="italic">Mus&#xE4;us</hi> has been lying on the shelf these six weeks, longing to pay his <foreign>devoirs</foreign> to you. It was my earliest task to inspect his pretensions, and try whether he deserved that honour: I found him a very honest gentleman and admitted his claims without hesitation. Of genius in the strict meaning of the word his share is small if any; but in return he has a true vein of shrewd sense, no inconsiderable stock of knowledge, a fine little clear imagination, a perennial flow of good nature, and abundance of wit and humour such as they are. His tales are in general amusing: we shall be enabled to select some half dozen from them of a quite superior quality. The <hi rend="italic">proper</hi> half dozen I have been considering of, for some days, without yet having come to any very firm resolution. Perhaps in the present stage of the business it were best for you to begin translating <hi rend="italic">Libussa</hi> (in the third volume) which I reckon about the best; and when you tire of writing, to peruse carefully the following: <hi rend="italic">Die B&#xfc;cher der Chronika &#x26;c, Rolands Knappen, Legenden von R&#xfc;bezahl, Der geraubte Schleyer</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Melechsala</hi>;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >All in <hi rend="italic">Volksm&#xE4;hrchen der Deutschen</hi>, 5 vols. (Gotha, <date when="1782-00-00">1782</date>&#x2013;<date when="1786-00-00">86</date>).</note> out of which when we meet, as I trust in Providence we shall soon do, it will be easy for us to lay our heads together, and chuse the fit quantity in the most prudent manner. No one of the stories, even of those excluded in this enumeration, is without passages of great merit; but generally these passages are more thinly disseminated, and the narrative languishes and wants incident and unity, in the tales omitted here, particularly as you advance into the later volumes. On the whole however I think we shall have no difficulty in making out a very handsome volume, if we play our parts fitly: at all events the undertaking will be very advantageous for you, whatever be the fortune of it; you will gain by it a complete acquaintance with German, and train yourself more and more in the art of writing English. I have often been surprized at the easy elegance with which you already compose; you want only practice of sufficient extent to make you a style of your own and to give you the power of employing it with a felicity which there will be a thousand to envy for one there is to imitate. Some phrases and allusions in the original will here and there obstruct you; but do not linger over them; we will decipher them between us, or find means <pb id="pg-02-388" n="02:388"/>of blinking them in a plausible way. Take pains in your phraseology and punctuation; but not too much pains; there is a light good-natured strain of sarcasm in Mus&#xE4;us which often reminded me of you, and by obeying with some freedom the impulse of your first thoughts, you will likely transfuse this better than by too much study and erasion. On the whole you will like Mus&#xE4;us but not love him: his powers of head are akin to your own in some points, but he wants your <hi rend="italic">heart</hi> with all its generous ardent feelings, and so never rises to be a true hero or any thing approaching to it. When you and I have once arrived at the <hi rend="italic">years of discretion</hi>, we shall look down with great composure on such people as Mus&#xE4;us: in the mean time use him kindly, and his acquaintance will profit you.</p>
<p>Now, my dear Enemy, you must begin this business without delay; and keep by it constantly at the rate of about three hours (not more) daily, devoting the remainder of your time to finishing Gibbon, and writing immeasurable letters to the Malignant Philosopher, and entertaining your Mother and the good people your neighbours who come to visit you. I also <hi rend="italic">insist</hi> that you spend two or three hours every day in the open air: do this, Jane, for <hi rend="italic">my sake</hi>; I know the consequence of excessive application; I would not have you in such a state as I have spent the last five years in for all the universe. And never fear, my beloved Scholar, that I shall try to persuade you to relinquish the noble purposes which nature and habit have alike appointed you to fulfil: if I seem to restrain your impetuosity, it is only that you may more surely and happily reach the goal. There is in fact, I see it more clearly every day, nothing but literature that will serve to make your life agreeable or useful. In your actual situation, you have two things to chuse between: you may be a fashionable Lady, the ornament of drawing-rooms and festive parties in your native district, the wife of some prosperous man who will love you well and provide for you all that is choicest in the entertainment of common minds; or you may take the pursuit of truth and mental beauty for your highest good, and trust to fortune, be it good or bad, for the rest. The choice is important, and requires your most calm and serious reflection. Nevertheless, I think you have decided like a prudent woman no less than like a heroine. I dare not promise that your life will be free from sorrows; for minds like yours deep sorrows are reserved, take the world as you will: but you will also have noble pleasures, and the great intention of your being will be accomplished. As a fashionable fine lady, on the other hand, I do not see how you could get thro&#x2019; the world on even moderate terms: a few years at most would quite sicken you of such a life; you <pb id="pg-02-389" n="02:389"/>would begin by becoming wretched, and end by ceasing to be amiable. I see something of fashionable people here; and truly to my plebeian conception there is not a more futile class of persons on the face of God&#x2019;s earth. If I were doomed to exist as a man of fashion I do honestly believe I should swallow rat&#x2019;s bane or apply to hemp or steel before three months were over. There is something so <hi rend="italic">very</hi> unsubstantial in their whole proceedings, such toiling and wrestling and so very little realized, that really I know not well how even stupid people can endure it. From day to day and year to year the problem is not how to use time, but how to waste it least painfully; they have their dinners and their routs, they move heaven and earth to get every thing arranged and enacted properly, and when the whole is done, what is it? Had the parties all wrapped themselves up in warm blankets and kept their beds, much peace had been among several hundreds of his majesty&#x2019;s subjects, and the very same result, the uneasy destruction of half a dozen hours, had been quite as well attained. Think of this lasting thro&#x2019; forty years&#x2014;insipidity around you, before you, and behind! It is no wonder that poor women take to opium and scandal: the wonder is rather that these poor queens of the land do not some morning, struck by the hopelessness of their condition, make a general finish by simultaneous consent, and exhibit to coroners and juries the spectacle of the whole world of <hi rend="italic">ton</hi> suspended by their garters, and freed at last from <foreign><hi rend="italic">ennui</hi></foreign>, in the most cheap and complete of all possible modes. There is something in the life of a sturdy peasant toiling from sun to sun for a plump wife and six <hi rend="italic">eating</hi> children: but as to the Lady Jerseys and the Lord Petershams <note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Prominent figures of society in their day. Lady Jersey (<date when="1785-00-00">1785</date>&#x2013;<date when="1867-00-00">1867</date>), wife of George Child Villiers, the fifth Earl of Jersey, is said to have suggested the character of Lady St. Julians in D&#x2019;Israeli&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Coningsby</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Syb il</hi>. Lord Petersham, Charles Stanhope, fourth Earl of Harrington (<date when="1780-00-00">1780</date>&#x2013;<date when="1851-00-00">1851</date>), was known for his eccentric habits and tastes. He designed the Petersham overcoat, Petersham snuffbox, and mixed his own blacking.</note>&#x2014;peace be with them! For <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, my heroic Jane, there is nothing here, tho&#x2019; in its utmost perfection, that could give one hour&#x2019;s true satisfaction; and wisely have you judged it better to chuse a path of your own, beset perhaps with difficulties and dangers, but leading to glory and true nobleness, than to follow the multitude along a path, beaten enough indeed, but leading thro&#x2019; inanity and chagrin to&#x2014;nothing. Persist! Persist! and fear not that all will yet be well.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Oh! but <hi rend="italic">I have no genius</hi>!&#x201D; I tell you on the contrary that you <hi rend="italic">have</hi> a genius, you ungrateful creature; every day I am growing surer of this: nothing but time and diligence are required to develope it in full <pb id="pg-02-390" n="02:390"/>splendour, tho&#x2019; most likely in a shape very different from what you anticipate. So down to your <foreign><hi rend="italic">Volksm&#xE4;hrchen</hi></foreign> [folk tales], and get along with them, and let me hear no more complaints. See that you have <hi rend="italic">Libussa</hi> done when I arrive: if not, the consequences may be fatal.</p>
<p>I expect to be with you even earlier than I said; most probably in three weeks<supplied>[.]</supplied> I do trust you will let me see you at Haddington: we should have a week to spend together, in talking over the thousand things in which we have a common concern. I forget how often I have been disappointed of seeing you lately; many times I am sure: but I still keep hoping as if nothing of the kind had happened. I figure out myself and you sitting unmolested for hours in your drawing-room&#x2014;talking with each other of high matters&#x2014;matters high to <hi rend="italic">us</hi>, and taking counsel in concert about the affairs of the <hi rend="italic">commonwealth</hi>, which are now assuming an aspect, more difficult to look on with coolness than ever. O Jane! <hi rend="italic">if</hi> there were no subjunctive mood&#x2014;but all <hi rend="italic">ifs</hi> abolished from the earth forever! You are an angel; but I must not forget what <hi rend="italic">I</hi> am. My life here is the most unprofitable and totally inane I ever found it. I think of little or nothing else but you; and that not like a man of sense, but like a foolish boy. I read none, I do not translate three pages of Goethe once a week. Good heavens! am I growing mad? I form ten thousand plans of future conduct, but each is weaker than its forerunner, each is rejected in its turn. I am also fast losing any little health I was possessed of: some days I suffer as much pain as would drive about three Lake poets down to Tartarus; but I have long been trained in a sterner school; besides by nature I am of the <hi rend="italic">Cat</hi> genus, and like every Cat, I have nine lives. I shall not die therefore, but unless I take some prudent resolution, I shall do worse. I often think of leaving these Bullers entirely; going home to my kind true-hearted Mother, for a year; and then with recovered health, fronting the hardest of the world once more. The people treat me with extreme consideration, the young men love me and are worth some love in their turn; but their way of life threatens to prove inconsistent with my very pitiful health, my employment is without vexation but it leaves my best faculties <hi rend="italic">un</hi>employed, leisure hours must be devoted to exercise; thus I accomplish nothing, but waste the flower of my existence&#x2014;in earning daily bread. Absolutely this will not and shall not do. I signified to Buller to-day that I must have leave of absence shortly: I mean to bring a horse with me when I return; I shall try Kinnaird for a week or two, and if I cannot keep in my usual tithe of health, and have some hours for better purposes, I am off, without sound of drum, forever and a day.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-02-391" n="02:391"/>Well! here is surely a mournful tragedy, and a noble mind to bear the brunt of it! Why do I talk to you of it? Because you have a kind heart; and I am but a driveller to call for its sympathy with such despicable sorrows. Never mind me, my good Jane: allow me to fight with the paltry evils of my lot as best I may; and if I cannot beat them down, let <hi rend="italic">me</hi> go to the Devil as is right I should. We have had too much of this!</p>
<p>How bright and serene and full of sunshine do all things appear when I turn from myself to <hi rend="italic">you!</hi> Yes, in the darkest hour, some hope still lingers gilding the horizon, when I think of Jane; something of an etherial nature is still blended for me with the clay of this world, when I think that she is my friend. May God reward you, my dearest, for what you have been to me! It may be that we shall yet be a happiness to one another; that we shall live thro&#x2019; this earthly pilgrimage united in the noblest pursuits, in the bonds of true love, one heart one soul one fortune; and go down to other times inseparable after life as in it: it may be that we must part and see each other no more: but stil<supplied>[l we]</supplied> shall remember one another with affection and respect, and regard these drea<supplied>[ms of]</supplied> our youth as among the fairest portions of our history.</p>
<p>But I must leave you again. Excuse the tattered state of these papers, and all the foolish things written on it. I began this letter yesterday, and I have said twice as much as I intended or ought. Write to me whenever you have <hi rend="italic">any</hi> time: do, if you can; for I have no pleasure like what I get from listening to you. Tell me <hi rend="italic">all</hi> that you feel or care for, all that is on your heart&#x2014;as I do. What is become of that poor youth?<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. Fyffe.</note> What are you doing? Are you well and happy? Write, write! I will answer you once on paper, and shortly after you will see me if I am not too sick, which is not very likely. Good night my dearest friend. <closer><salute>I am ever your&#x2019;s</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Jane,</salute>
<p>On opening this letter I fear you will think I am growing one of the most troublesome fellows in the world. You can hardly yet have read the long narcotic epistle which I sent you with the German books; and ere two days have elapsed I am writing again! It is not without reluctance that I plague you <hi rend="italic">so soon</hi>; but a sad embarrassment constrains me.</p>
<p>One of my finest hopes for the last six weeks was that of passing a day or two beside you, as I travelled into Annandale: this bright anticipation I am now in great danger of failing to get realized. These Bullers are persons about as steady in their resolves as the tarnished weathercock that creaks above their coach-house: in place of <date when="1823-08-00">August</date>, when I was to get away, it now turns out that <date when="1823-07-00">July</date> is the time. <hi rend="italic">Another</hi> flight of visitors threatens to alight here very shortly; and all parties seem to concur in the wish (I the most zealously of any) that they and I may not meet. Kinnaird House is small, they need my rooms: I am sick of the inanities of hunting Captains, Jesus&#x2019;-College Jockies, and silly women; a fresh arrival I would gladly avoid. So after much sage counsel it has been decided that I leave this place on the evening of Friday the 11<hi rend="italic">th</hi>&#x2014;that is precisely this night week. Next day and till Sunday I shall most likely be in Dundee, visiting an afflicted Schoolmaster&#x2014;afflicted by Methodist squires and dowagers&#x2014;but intrinsically one of the most honest souls now alive. Poor Johnston<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Johnston.</note> was the guide and companion of my boyhood; he may well claim all the very slender counsel or encouragement which I can now give him. On Monday I arrive in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, and may then go to the east or the west as I think fit.</p>
<p>Now what is to be done, my dear? Must I turn home without seeing you, and begin a month, intended for enjoyment, in a humour soured by such a disappointment, instead of sweetened by all the inspirations I looked forward to? The odds I confess are against me, but I will not give up without an effort. If you are in Haddington, all may yet be well. In that case you will get my letter on Monday morning first; you will immediately take counsel with your Mother and yourself whether it may be fit to grant the p<supplied>[r]</supplied>ayer of my petition; and <pb id="pg-02-393" n="02:393"/>then, like a fine creature as you are, let me know the result without delay. If your letter be in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> any time before ten o&#x2019;clock on Thursday-evening, I calculate that it will find me here at least three hours before my departure. Should the response prove propitious, I shall linger no moment in that miserable City; most probably I shall be with you on the very day of my arrival there.</p>
<p>This will be a glorious thing, as you may well believe: but alas! it is too uncertain to be reckoned on. Perhaps you are still at Templand; in which case, all the project is a castle in the air. Perhaps, tho&#x2019; arrived at home, there are a hundred weighty reasons, which forbid you to see me. Against these, do not think that I should murmur: you know sufficiently that I am now become quite an obedient subject, determined only not to quarrel with your will, in matters where it ought to be supreme. Most of the remaining hopes that still make life endurable, at times delightful, to me are connected with you; to see you therefore must be one of my chief wishes: but in all things which mutually concern us, you have long ago received an arbitrary jurisdiction, and well has the business prospered in your hands. Continue the same skilful management: in all matters great and small I have resolved to obey you cheerfully. Let me see or not see you, your orders shall be executed: the only decision, that I totally and with all my soul protest against, is one which nothing but a wicked demon could inspire you with, the decision <hi rend="italic">that we are to part</hi>. To this I will never consent. Never! you may do what you please to make me; may force me to hold my peace about it, but not to acquiesce in it: I will say that it was a wrong decision with my dying breath. But in all other points, I am &#x201C;as clay in the hands of the potter&#x201D;;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Rom. 9:21.</note> direct me according to your own sovereign will and pleasure, and see whether I will not comply!</p>
<p>If no letter come from you next week, I shall infer that you are still in Nithsdale; and shall again beg that I may be allowed to see you as I return to the North. You will write to me <hi rend="italic">every week</hi> in Annandale? I shall be there after <hi rend="italic">the</hi> Monday-night; and asking every day for letters from you. Yet do not strain yourself: if disappointed I shall only <supplied>[be]</supplied>lieve that you are too much occupied for writing to me, never that you are too careless of me. No, my own kind Jane! that is a thing I will <hi rend="italic">not</hi> believe. The glorious fact that you are my friend is dear to me as his creed is to a bigot; I will hold fast my conviction of it till I <hi rend="italic">can</hi> hold it no longer. Yet you will write me long letters often often? Will you not? Yes you will.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-02-394" n="02:394"/>Some great revolution must take place in my poor history ere long. There are things tossing up and down this wretched soul of mine that <hi rend="italic">must</hi> finally drive me mad, or kill me, or come out of me in some shape. God only knows how it shall be! There are times when I feel it sinful not to let go your hand forever: it is with me as if I were enveloped in the rushing of a mighty whirlwind that is dashing me onward to regions of unknown wildness and danger; and it seems <hi rend="italic">very</hi> cruel to entice <hi rend="italic">you</hi> from the sunny places you inhabit to take any share in a fate so dark and perilous. O My best beloved Jane! it would be a pang more bitter than any that ever struck thro&#x2019; my heart, if I had to think that your happiness had been marred by <hi rend="italic">me</hi>. As it <hi rend="italic">was</hi>, I could have lived a kind of petrified existence, hoping nothing, loving nothing, fearing nothing; and died, when my time came, like a toil-worn slave, casting by his drudgery, and lying down to sleep where tasks and stripes shall never more awake him. As it <hi rend="italic">is</hi>, an elysian world is near me to tempt my footsteps, and my presence may desolate and blast it forever. God help us both! I know not what to say or think of it.</p>
<p>Are you laughing at me? Perhaps it is best: for the picture has a bright as well as dark side, and it is useless to gaze too much upon the latter. Suppose this genius that is in us&#x2014;for there <hi rend="italic">is</hi> a kind of genius in us both&#x2014;tho&#x2019; of what extent I cannot guess, but there it <hi rend="italic">is</hi> I could swear on the evangile&#x2014;suppose it were developed fully and set before the world!&#x2014; Fame, and wealth enough, and peace, and everlasting love to crown the whole!&#x2014; O my Jane, what a life were ours! There is no Emperor that ever swayed the world whom I would change with. But we are both foolish persons, both far too ambitious&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">can</hi> we ever be happy? One thing alone is certain: I <hi rend="italic">will</hi> love you to the last breath of my life, come of it what may. So God be with you my best Jane! There is nothing that I fear but <hi rend="italic">for you</hi>. <foreign>Adieu!</foreign><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The last two paragraphs are very remarkable in the light of later events.</note></p>

<salute>My dear Johnston,</salute>
<p>The appearance of this letter will cause you some surprise, and the contents of it some more. I purpose seeing you in three days! The Bullers and I have entered into arrangements, whereby I am to have <pb id="pg-02-395" n="02:395"/>a month&#x2019;s vacation; I set out on the evening of next Friday, and the following forenoon I expect, if all suit rightly, to be in Broughty-ferry. You will therefore hold forthwith a council of ways and means; take your Landlady to task, and see if it be in her power to furnish me with a perfectly quiet dormitory for two successive nights, and if so you have nothing farther to do but sit quietly in your place till I arrive by the earliest Steamboat from Perth on Saturday morning. If otherwise, or if you cannot be at home, or have <hi rend="italic">any</hi> lawful excuse, let me know instantly, and I shall proceed towards Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> without deflecting from my course, and thence to Annandale, where I shall expect to see you before returning. Mark only that you have not a minute to lose, if you would forbid my approaches: I set out on Friday, and if you miss a single post, I come down to Broughty-ferry, and &#x201C;witness only huge dismay.&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Round he throws his baleful eyes, / That witnessed huge affliction and dismay&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi>, I, 56&#x2013;57).</note> Write to me therefore if I must <hi rend="italic">not</hi> come&#x2014;the very moment you have done reading this. <foreign><hi rend="italic">verbum sapieenti</hi></foreign> [a word to the wise]!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Terence, <hi rend="italic">Phormio</hi>, III, iii, 8. The two <hi rend="italic">e</hi>&#x2019;s in Carlyle&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">sapienti</hi> are a slip of the pen.</note> I need add no more on that point.</p>
<p>This departure is speedier than I anticipated. I have been myself impelled to hasten it by the very infirm state of my outward man, which I hope to get improved when I have nothing else to attend to in our native country. My health has been quite capricious, since I came hither; I have hardly slept soundly two nights in succession, I grew vexed and desperate, there were symptoms of approaching <hi rend="italic">coma</hi>. Had you see what choice spirits I was in! There is not such another <hi rend="italic">stu</hi>mulus<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle appears to intend some kind of pun, possibly based on an incongruous combination of <hi rend="italic">stupid, stew, stimulus</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">stomach</hi>.</note> in nature as bile. Now however I am growing better and duller. Sort out all your stock of domestic intelligence to be set before me cut and dry when I arrive; you will find me a very patient and not uninterested hearer. I have somewhat to tell you and much to learn.</p>
<p>With the prospect of communicating verbally with you, for the space of six and thirty hours, so soon, it were worse than useless to detain you at present. <closer><salute>Allow me therefore to lay by my quill-stump, having first subscribed myself with it,</salute></closer></p>
<p><closer><salute>Most sincerely your&#x2019;s, /</salute></closer> <name>Thomas Carlyle.</name></p>
<ps><p>Here is a <hi rend="italic">cooplet</hi> or two from Goethe to fill up the sheet. The subject is Italy; the singer Mignon, a poor little girl stolen from wealth <pb id="pg-02-396" n="02:396"/>and splendour in that country while yet almost an infant, and carried by rope-dancers into Germany, where she thus expresseth her vague recollections of that magnificent region, about which her thoughts are ever occupied tho&#x2019; she cannot name it, being a young child of very few words. Mignon singeth to Wilhelm and playeth on the cithern:</p>
<lg><l>Knowst thou the land where the fresh citrons bloom,</l>
<l>And the gold-orange glows in the deep thicket&#x2019;s gloom?</l>
<l>Where a wind ever soft from the blue heaven blows</l>
<l>And the groves are of laurel and myrtle and rose?</l>
<l>Knowst thou it?</l>
<l>Thither! O Thither</l>
<l>My dearest and kindest with thee would I go.</l></lg>
<lg><l>Knowst thou the house with its porch-columns tall?</l>
<l>With its glittering chambers and stately hall?</l>
<l>Where the figures of marble look on me so mild As if thinking:</l>
<l>&#x201C;Why thus did they use thee poor child!&#x201D;</l>
<l>Knowst thou it?</l>
<l>Thither! O Thither</l>
<l>My guide and my guardian with thee would I go.</l></lg>
<lg><l>Knowst thou the mountain, its cloud-covered arch</l>
<l>Where the mules among mist o&#x2019;er the wild torrent march?</l>
<l>In the clefts of it dragons lie coil&#x2019;d with their brood;</l>
<l>The rent crag rushes down, and above it the flood.</l>
<l>Knowst thou it?</l>
<l>Thither! O Thither</l>

<p>If you are not <hi rend="italic">strong</hi> in faith you must be ready to cast me off as the most ungrateful of correspondents; but tho&#x2019; appearances are against me I am not much in fault&#x2014; The first of your three letters which was <pb id="pg-02-397" n="02:397"/>addressed to Templand reached me in due time&#x2014; I was ashamed to answer it without having performed what you required&#x2014;and never had you assigned me so difficult a task&#x2014; <hi rend="italic">That</hi> letter cost me more thought than all the letters I have written for a twelvemont<supplied>[h]</supplied>, and after all, a sillier never was penned&#x2014; The very day it was sealed and sent, I wrote to <hi rend="italic">you</hi>&#x2014;a long letter&#x2014;to be put into the post office at Dumfries on my way hither&#x2014; I was seated in the mail, with the said letter in my reticule, calculating, as we drove along, how many days it would be before it reached Dunkeld when the horses suddenly stopped and your last addressed to Hadd., flew in at the window&#x2014; Had I not been in the most prosaic situation imaginable I might have fancied a pigeon or some winged spirit was in your service and had borne it through the air to where I was&#x2014;but, alas!

<p><salute>May blessings be upon you, my dear Jane, for the letter I got yesterday!</salute> It delivered me from a load of perplexities: I had not been in so galling a predicament for many months. What had befallen us, what kept you silent so long, I could not with any plausibility conjecture. Of your truth and kindness I harboured no doubt; my &#x201C;faith&#x201D; in you will stand far severer trials. If the weakness of poor human nature perpetually exposes us to offend even those we love most, I know you too well to suspect that you can entertain anger against me, even with a just cause&#x2014;feeling as you must how impossible it is that my will should sin in this particular, and how amiable it is to pardon and forget. <pb id="pg-02-399" n="02:399"/>Had you been of that punctilious temper, had you acted at all as an ordinary woman, we should never have advanced thus far; the first week of our acquaintance must have been the term of my services; I should then have received a perpetual <hi rend="italic">leave of absence</hi>, and have stood forever, if I stood at all, in your rememberance, as simply the most untoward and unpleasant individual it had been your evil chance to meet with. Thank heaven, it is not so! No, no, &#x201C;we will never never quarrel more!&#x201D; Thus it stands in your own handwriting, in black and white against you: I keep the paper as a kind of <hi rend="italic">magna charta</hi>, with which I put to flight the armies of the Alien whenever they attack me in that quarter. But if these partisans of the Enemy were so triumphantly repulsed in their main battle, they came on with but the more vigour in the wings. I thought surely you must be sick, or embarrassed, or unhappy in some one of the thousand ways of being so. I believe I have the most benign imagination of any youth in His Majesty&#x2019;s dominions. When I learned that you were still in Nithsdale, and yet found no letter for me here, it seemed as if something <hi rend="italic">very</hi> awful was impending! I wrote twice to you, and burned my papers successively before they were concluded, that I might not plague you with my silly fantasies. At length I determined to wait till Saturday; then if news came not, to write in the most sublime manner; and after another week of fruitless expectation to begin being wretched in good earnest. But you are an excellent creature in your own way; among the hills of Galloway you had been caring for me. I was sitting yesterday with my eyes fixed on Jonathan&#x2019;s German lesson, and my thoughts wandering some twenty miles away from it, when your letter came,&#x2014;like the dove to Noah&#x2019;s ark, with a branch of olive in its bill, to shew that the Earth was not yet quite ruined. Well! we should be thankful that all is right. I have only to add my humble prayer that <hi rend="italic">Mademoiselle</hi> would never again keep me as long ignorant of her proceedings, never while we both continue in this world. This you call rather an impudent prayer; but the most part of prayers are so; you will do your best to grant it</p>
<p>Why, now that the <hi rend="italic">Burble</hi> is all unravelled, I should risk producing it again, and at any rate afflict you so early with my scribbling, I know not; unless it be that my chief pleasure lies in afflicting you. Certainly you are a &#x201C;great temporal blessing&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A quotation from Edward Irving?</note> to me in this respect. But I want also to keep you in mind of that precious promise &#x201C;to write to me at large in a day or two.&#x201D; See that you think of this to fulfil it! I must know your whole history, your enjoyments and chagrins, all your ups <pb id="pg-02-400" n="02:400"/>and downs for the last seven weeks. Above all, do not forget to consider and tell me, when and where I am to see you. I am not Job more than you are, tho&#x2019; both of us are of kindred to Job&#x2019;s wife.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >One of Jane&#x2019;s scribblings on the back of this letter is &#x201C;sick of imitating Job,&#x201D; from Byron&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Don Juan</hi>, canto 8, st. 50. Cf. also Job 2:10, where Job says that his wife speaks as &#x201C;one of the foolish women.&#x201D;</note> These disappointments are enough to exhaust one&#x2019;s stock of patience altogether. I do long to see you and talk with you in freedom. A thousand things are lying on my heart, which I dare not trust to paper, the half of which I should not trust to words: let me behold your fair face and black eyes, that I may study them, and see whether you are to me an angel of light yea or not. I believe you in my heart to be a sorceress, and that no good will ever come of you. Nevertheless let me examine face to face. Tell me <hi rend="italic">when</hi>, and I will abide my time without complaining. At present I am scarcely more than twenty miles from Templand: it would be the easiest thing in nature for me to come riding so far across the moors, and the joyfullest&#x2014;if that were all. But I have so much confidence both in your affection and prudence that I will not think of attempting it without your express permission. It would indeed make the next a glad week: but I scarcely hope it. In that case, shall I see you at Haddington as I go up about the <date when="1823-08-10">tenth of August</date>? I do intreat you to contrive something: if I go back to Kinnaird without having seen you, I shall be fit for treasons stratagems and spoils.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">The Merchant of Venice</hi>, V, i.</note> No, I will not grow cholerick, but I shall be very sad. Write, write, and send me help if you can.</p>
<p>Poor little Jane got her book from you three weeks ago; she has it covered with paper, and laid up in the most secret places of her drawer, guarding it so religiously from harm that she will not venture to read it, but has borrowed another copy for that purpose. She is prouder of it than of any other present ever given her; and well she may. My dear friend, you are really too good to me; I absolutely feel ashamed of your kindness when compared with my demerits. To think of your affection, and the many delightful ways you take of shewing it, and then to think of all that I should have done for you and have not offers but a melancholy contrast. With my wishes towards you I have sometimes reason to be satisfied; but alas for their accomplishment! I have derived from you some of the finest enjoyments and hopes of my existence; natural feeling tho&#x2019; unseconded by such calls of gratitude would imperiously command me to serve you: and all these claims I have yet to cancel! Well I swear it shall yet be done! If it be in the <pb id="pg-02-401" n="02:401"/>power of fallen man, some suitable result <hi rend="italic">shall</hi> come out of these many strivings. I think if I knew you happy and fulfilling the destiny for which nature marked you, I too should be happy. Let us hope, my best Jane, let us never cease to endeavour: in time we too shall have our day of triumph. Would it were here!</p>
<p>You regret unjustly the departure of another year: it has not departed in vain. You know much that you knew not this time twelve-month; you seem to me in a much more reasonable state of mind; you are getting arrangements made for a better future: on the whole I am satisfied with your progress. Nor will this long rustication be altogether useless. You have need to be called away at times from dead books and studies into the living world. A Blue imagines that all the interests of life are comprised within the letters of the alphabet: a superior woman knows that many persons ignorant and careless of &#x201C;literature&#x201D; in all its branches, are more deserving of attention than ninety-nine hundredths of &#x201C;the mob of gentlemen that write with ease.&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Pope, <hi rend="italic">Imitations of Horace</hi>, Book II, Epistle I, l. 108.</note> There is a world that is not of types and printers: it is a too great abstraction from this warm variegated world that causes most of the misery and many of the faults which deform too frequently the literary life. I rejoice that you are with sensible persons, that love you and are of habits so foreign to your own. Bear the interruption with patience; you will return to your studies with the greater ardour. The good <hi rend="italic">Mus&#xE4;us</hi> lies in durance for you at Haddington, longing to be free. You will make a brilliant figure with him, before the winter begins: I have given you all needful notices (and many things not needful besides) in a long melancholy letter, which I wrote when very sick. I calculated then on completing my instructions <hi rend="italic">verbally</hi>. Shall I not be so favoured? Do think and study what is to be done. If I may come to Templand, expect me very soon: if not invent something else. At all events write to me as you promised <hi rend="italic">immediately</hi>. If you <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> see me, now or in <date when="1823-08-00">August</date>, do not vex yourself about me: I shall arrange matters some other way, and still live on hope. God bless you my Dearest! Seeing you or not seeing, (&#x201C;In two days&#x201D;!)</p>

<salute>My dear Friend</salute>
<p>In the letter I wrote to you from Galloway I promised you a longer and more legible one in a day or two&#x2014; I hoped to have a little time to myself on my return hither. but in this very moderate expectation I am disappointed&#x2014; I have found the house full of company&#x2014; There is my uncle from Liverpool,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Welsh, her maternal uncle.</note> his wife, the most horrid woman on the face of the earth,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mary Welsh, her aunt.</note> and five such children. in addition to all that were here before&#x2014;what with the Mother&#x2019;s scolding, and the children&#x2019;s squalling, and my uncle&#x2019;s declaiming, and my Grandfather&#x2019;s fidgetting I am half demented&#x2014;and if no immediate alteration for the better takes place in my condition, you may expect to hear of me being drowned in Nith or hanged in my garters&#x2014; In vain I seek refuge in my own apartment&#x2014; Uproar is in every part of the house; and I am no sooner amissing, than the cry of &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Cousin Pen!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-02/lt-18230606-JBW-TC-01">JBW to TC, <date when="1823-06-06">6 June</date></ref>, and <ref target="volume-02/lt-18230722-JBW-EA-01">JBW to <sic>ES</sic><corr>EA</corr>, <date when="1823-07-22">22 July</date></ref>.</note> come down, come down</hi>!&#x201D; reminds me &#x2018;I may not be my own mistress <hi rend="italic">here</hi>&#x2014; Good Lord deliver me!&#x2019; I am sore afflicted.&#x2014;</p>
<p>I have risen at six this morning, for the purpose of fulfilling my promise to you, before the hubbub commences for I might as well think of flying to Ecclefechan on my quill, as of writing a connected sentence after <hi rend="italic">&#x2018;Babys&#x2019;</hi> first scream has announced her waking&#x2014;</p>
<p>Such a week I spent in Galloway! There was no amusement within doors, and the weather precluded the chance of finding any without&#x2014; &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">C&#x9c;lebs in search of a wife</hi>&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Coelebs in Search of a Wife</hi> (<date when="1809-00-00">1809</date>), by Hannah More (<date when="1745-00-00">1745</date>&#x2013;<date when="1833-00-00">1833</date>).</note> was the only book in the house; and <hi rend="italic">even that</hi> was monopolized by a young Lady who came to my Uncles (I strongly suspect) on C&#x9c;lebs&#x2019;s errand&#x2014; The rest of us had no weapon of any sort to combat time with. and for four whole days I sat counting the drops of rain that fell from the ceiling into a bowl beneath, or in <foreign><foreign>burbling</foreign></foreign> [twisting] the chain of my watch for the pleasure of undoing it&#x2014; &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">oh Plato! what tasks for a philosopher!</hi>&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A. Carlyle points out that this was said by Julian (hitherto a recluse) when he awkwardly repeated some military exercise which he was obliged to learn on being chosen Governor of the Provinces of Gaul. Cf.

<p>I stayed two days in Dumfries on my way back. / and these two days were not so uninteresting as the preceeding ones. Who do you think was there at the same time? but the gallant Artist<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Benjamin Bell.</note> I took a fancy to last <date when="1822-07-00">July</date>, and whom I had imagined still breathing the atmosphere of Go&#xEB;the&#x2014; But I did not see him! or rather I did not speak with him&#x2014;for I actually saw him&#x2014;on the opposite bank of the river! Let any one conceive a more tantalizing situation! Saw him&#x2014;and durst not make the smallest effort to attract his notice! tho&#x2019; had my will alone been consulted on the matter&#x2014;to have met him &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">eye<supplied>[s]</supplied> to eyes, and soul to soul</hi>&#x201D; &#x2014;I would have swam&#x2014;ay! swam across&#x2014;at the risk of being dozed [dosed] with water-gruel for a month to come&#x2014; Oh this everlasting etiquette! how many, and how ungrateful are the sacrifices it requires!</p>
<p>Tomorrow I am off again on another visit!&#x2014;to be tormented (I have no doubt) after some other fashion<supplied>[.]</supplied> Alas! my beloved German! my precious precious time! but if ever my good Mother gets me wheedled here again! three weeks indeed! I conjectured how it would be from the very first&#x2014; Long ago, when I was always at home, and happier than I shall ever be again, how I envied my companions who went about visiting and seeing sights! how I repined when my Father silenced my petitions for the same indulgence, telling me it was time to be idle when I had nothing more to learn! the very last time that he refused to gratify my idle inclinations, I felt so disappointed! fool that I was! and thought him so severe! I remember he took my hand and said to me &#x201C;you are vexed Jane; but you will thank me <hi rend="italic">hereafter</hi> for the restraint you <hi rend="italic">now</hi> repine at&#x2014; Oh! you will have <hi rend="italic">enough</hi> of these unprofitable pleasures, before all&#x2019;s done&#x2014;you will not always be at home with <hi rend="italic">me</hi>&#x201D;&#x2014; These were prophetic words! there was something so mournful and tender in his look and voice when he pronounced them, that I could not restrain my tears&#x2014; I know not how it was&#x2014;from that moment my heart was heavy; as if I had had a presentiment of the calamity that approached me&#x2014; The very same day, his illness commenced, and I was forced away from him&#x2014;but I sat by the door of his room, and heard his voice&#x2014;and when it was opened I saw his face &#x2014;and sometimes I stood an instant by his bed in spite of their efforts to remove me&#x2014;and then he looked so anxious, and said to my Mother <pb id="pg-02-404" n="02:404"/>&#x201C;will you not send her away?&#x201D; Oh my God the recollections of that short awful period of my life will darken my being, to the grave&#x2014; I I have indeed had <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;enough&#x201D;</hi> of the unprofitable pleasures I so much longed for!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Here is another letter from you!&#x2014; my head ached; so I went to bed again, and was enjoying one of the finest dreams imaginable, when the breakfast bell summoned me back to less agreeable reality&#x2014; I had seated myself at table in no very ravenous mood, when what should I perceive upon my <hi rend="italic">plate</hi> but a letter bearing the external marks that always ensure to yours a hearty welcome&#x2014; Well! you are an inimitable correspondent! but you must not come here!&#x2014;&#x2014; on considering the circumstances I am placed in you will perceive the nonsense of the project&#x2014; there can be no objection to our meetting at Haddington, if I am there at the time you mention&#x2014;but of this I am as doubtful as yourself&#x2014; as long as our friends here press my Mother to stay she will not stir&#x2014;my only hope is in <hi rend="italic">tiring</hi> them&#x2014; who told you the people I am with are <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;sensible&#x201D;</hi> they are no such thing&#x2014;neither do they love tho&#x2019; they treat me civilly&#x2014; fewer people love me than one might imagine&#x2014; <hi rend="italic">You</hi> do&#x2014;my mother does&#x2014;M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Irving does and <hi rend="italic">one</hi> or <hi rend="italic">two</hi> more that shall be nameless&#x2014;but depend on it <hi rend="italic">love</hi> is by no means the general sentiment I inspire&#x2014; <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;speaking of Swine&#x201D;</hi> what is become of our gigantic Friend?<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edward Irving.</note> where is his book?<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">For the Oracles of God, Four Orations.

<salute>My beloved Cousin</salute>
<p>I have one excuse to offer for my apparent forgetfulness of you, and of my promise&#x2014;it is rather metaphysical in its nature; but there is &#x2018;common sense&#x2019; in it for all that&#x2014; However as it would require at least two pages of my paper, to explain it fully, and as I have other matters more interesting to discuss, I shall rely on your christian charity, in the mean time; confident of obtaining your full forgiveness when we meet&#x2014;</p>
<p>If ever my excellent Mother gets me wheedled here again! three weeks indeed! I conjectured how it would be from the very first&#x2014; Oh my beloved German, my precious, precious time! Were there only some definite prospect of a release! but there is none&#x2014;as long as our friends here press us to stay, my Mother will not stir&#x2014;my only hope is in tiring them&#x2014;</p>
<p>We have got my Uncle from Liverpool, his wife, the most horrid woman on the face of the earth, and five such children! in addition to our <hi rend="italic">family-party</hi>&#x2014;and what with the mother&#x2019;s scolding and the children&#x2019;s squalling, and my Uncle&#x2019;s fighting, and my Grandfather&#x2019;s fidgetting, I am half demented; and if some speedy alteration for the better does not take place in my condition, you may expect to hear of me being found drowned in the Nith or hanged in my garters<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ritchie provides this note, for which he says he is indebted to C. H. Firth: &#x201C;This is an allusion to the ballad of &#x2018;The Unfortunate Miss Bailey,&#x2019; popular about <date when="1805-00-00">1805</date>, and said to have first appeared in George Colman&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Love Laughs at Locksmiths</hi>. It is to be found in Ingledew&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Ballads and Songs of Yorkshire</hi> (<date when="1860-00-00">1860</date>), p. 241. The first stanza is as follows: &#x2018;A captain bold of Halifax, who dwelt in country quarters, Seduced a maid, who hanged herself one morning in her garters. His wicked conscience smited him, he lost his stomach daily, He took to drinking <foreign>ratafia</foreign>, and thought upon Miss Bailey. Oh, Miss Bailey! Unfortunate Miss Bailey!&#x2019;&#x201D; Ritchie quotes Carlyle, who in <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi>, I, 134, 154, 155, says that Jane was called &#x201C;Baillie&#x201D; after her mother&#x2019;s mother, &#x201C;a good and beautiful Miss Baillie&#x201D; who came from &#x201C;somewhat noted kindred in Biggar country.&#x201D; After Jane married she dropped this part of her name.</note>&#x2014;</p>
<p><pb id="pg-02-406" n="02:406"/>Now and then a visit to Penfillan or somewhere has afforded a little variety to my existence&#x2014; The week before last I spent with my Uncle George at Boreland<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ritchie feels it necessary to point out that this is not a fictitious name.</note>&#x2014;and such a week! There was no amusement within doors, and the weather precluded the possibility of finding any without&#x2014; The only book in the house (&#x201C;C&#x9c;lebs in search of a wife&#x201D;) was monopolized by a young Lady who, I strongly suspect, had come there upon C&#x9c;lebs&#x2019;s errand&#x2014;and the rest of us had no sort of weapon whatever to combat time with<supplied>[.]</supplied> For four whole days I had nothing for it but to count the drops of rain that fell from the ceiling into a bason beneath; or to make a <hi rend="italic">&#x2018;burble&#x2019;</hi> of my watchchain, for the satisfaction of undoing it&#x2014; Oh! Plato Plato! what tasks!&#x2014; At length in a phrensy of ennui I mounted a brute of a horse that could do nothing but trot, and rode thirty two miles just for diversion&#x2014; I left the good people at Boreland wondering, when it would fair? they had wondered for four days, and when I came back they were still wondering! How few people retain their faculties in rainy weather!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I spent two days in Dumfries on my way back&#x2014;and these two days were more interesting than the three hundred and sixty five preceeding ones. Who do you think was there at the self same time?&#x2014; My own gallant Artist! Benjamin Bell himself! I fancied him still inhaling the atmosphere of Go&#xEB;the when I learned he was within a stone-cast of the spot I sat on! But I did not see him!!! or rather I did not speak with him; for I actually saw him&#x2014;on the opposite bank of the river! Let any human being conceive a more tantalizing situation! saw him&#x2014;and durst not make any effort to attract his notice&#x2014;tho&#x2019;, had my will alone been consulted in the matter, to have met him <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;eyes to eyes, and soul to soul,&#x201D;</hi> I would have swam&#x2014;ay swam across, at the risk of being dozed [dosed] with water-gruel for a month to come&#x2014; Oh this everlasting etiquette! how many, and how ungrateful are the sacrifices it requires! Providence has surely some curious design respecting this youth and me! it was on my birth-day, we parted a year ago&#x2014;it was <pb id="pg-02-407" n="02:407"/>on my birth-day we met or (but for that confounded river) should have met again&#x2014; and there are many stranger coincidences in our histories besides&#x2014; Something <hi rend="italic">must</hi> come out of all this!&#x2014;and yet it was strange in Providence, after bringing us together from such a distance, to leave us on the opposite banks of a river! I declare I do not know what to make of it&#x2014;but time, time unravels all mysteries&#x2014; And now whither is he gone? to the north, or two the South? I learned that his father had taken a seat in the English mail&#x2014;but was it for himself or for his son? I wonder what the devil keeps my Mother here?&#x2014;</p>

<salute>My dear Jane,</salute>
<p>I should have allowed this week to pass without troubling you, had it not been that you seemed anxious to get <hi rend="italic">your Mother&#x2019;s Song</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The song, &#x201C;Bridekirk&#x2019;s Hunting,&#x201D; according to A. Carlyle, was enclosed on a second half-sheet of this letter which has been lost. See <ref target="volume-02/lt-18230525-TC-JBW-01">TC to JBW, <date when="1823-05-25">25 May</date></ref> and <ref target="volume-02/lt-18230701-TC-JBW-01"><date when="1823-07-01">1 July</date></ref>.</note> without delay. The chain of causes and effects is truly wonderful. This old hunting-catch has often been vociferated in surly bass tones thro&#x2019; the windpipes of twenty roystering Carlyles, greatly exciting their &#x201C;swill of whisky and their flow of soul&#x201D;;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For &#x201C;Feast of reason and flow of soul,&#x201D; see <ref target="volume-02/lt-18251224-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1825-12-24">24 Dec. 1825</date></ref>.</note> and now that these worthy men are all dead and gone, and their descendants dwindled into pedlars and peasants, the same immortal rhyme procures to me their undeserving clansman the pleasure of writing to my best friend. I shall forgive the stalwart <foreign>Laird</foreign> for all his pranks, if he often serve me in such stead.</p>
<p>You must not drown yourself in the Nith, or anywhere else, till you see farther about you. The kind of life you are leading is in truth vexatious enough;&#x2014;yielding no enjoyment in the present, and no result for the future but the sad thought of wasted time, it might tire a more prosaic character than you. &#x201C;Too much of one thing&#x201D; is an adage in all modern and ancient tongues. Even I am beginning to wish you home again: if you cannot manage it otherwise, I think you ought actually to set about &#x201C;wearying them out&#x201D; as soon as possible. Nevertheless you need not repine very much for all the mischief that has yet taken place. You have the prospect of a long and free life before you: plenty of days and months will remain after all abatements. These interruptions distress and irritate you, and it is natural they should: but no mortal ever got his whole time consecrated to worthy pursuits; and the history of literary men in particular should teach one patience under many obstructions. Cowper became an Author for the first time at fifty. Johnson in his old age said with a kind of gloomy pathos that &#x201C;much of his life had been wasted under the pressures of disease, much of it had been trifled away, much of it had always been spent in making provision for the day that was passing over him&#x201D;;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In Samuel Johnson&#x2019;s Preface to the <hi rend="italic">English Dictionary</hi>.</note> yet who would not say that Johnson did enough? You remember Milton; how he wrote Latin grammars, and taught schools, and fought in the arena of politics, as well as made <hi rend="italic">Comus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi>. Did not poor old Hooker <pb id="pg-02-409" n="02:409"/>write his <hi rend="italic">Ecclesiastical Polity</hi> in the middle of gridirons and foul platters and squealing children, and what was worse than all, within earshot and arm&#x2019;s length of a scolding sooty hilding whom he had to wife?<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Richard Hooker&#x2019;s wife, born Joan Churchman, has been described as a &#x201C;mere Xanthippe.&#x201D; See the <ref target="volume-02/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/13696"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>. Izaak Walton speaks of her as &#x201C;too like that wife&#x2019;s which is by Solomon compared to a dripping house.&#x201D;</note> Alas! my dear Jane, this world, take it as we will, is made of most unpliant stuff. I should think myself happy could I promise that even one tenth part of my existence would be at my disposal for any purpose above those of the beasts that perish. But it will not be; and often it burns my heart to think it will not. For you however I see better things in store. Deep cause as you have to regret that best and truest Friend and Father, whom you lost so mournfully, and on whose memory you will ever dwell with such a sad fondness, I cannot but perceive that by far the most trying period of your life is already past with safety. No one will ever counsel you in difficulties with so faithful and disinterested a mind as that good man who is gone; no one!&#x2014;not even I can speak to you once in ten times without some pitiful sneaking undercurrent less or more of selfish or half-selfish motives&#x2014;for which I often heartily despise myself: but a counsellor that can never wilfully deceive you, your own judgement, is coming fast to maturity, and will bear you through triumphantly. There are the most ample materials to work upon, the best purposes, the best powers, and freedom to employ these advantages greater than falls to the lot of one in a hundred. I know you often ponder these things, and study plans for a long future: by degrees you will learn as you seriously search for it, the art of surmounting or evading the obstacles that thwart you, and of reaping their full profit from the many circumstances that favour you. I have prophecied your complete success a hundred times: I still prophecy it more undoubtingly than ever. There is <hi rend="italic">no</hi> fear: if your will is steadfast enough, nothing can repel you.</p>
<p>Bad luck to Bride kirk! He cuts me off in the middle of my story, when I had a million of things to explain, and many that cannot wait. Will you write instantly and give me instant leave to answer? I begin to think I shall <hi rend="italic">not</hi> see you: Heaven give me patience! I have been twenty minutes unhappier, but never more serious than even now. O that I <hi rend="italic">could</hi> form some settled and feasible plan of life! I am weary of this wayfaring existence I have led so long: but <hi rend="italic">what</hi> to do to alter it? <closer><salute>God bless you!</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Murray,</salute>
<p>I received your two letters in due succession, and great cause I had to commend your friendly activity in my behalf. The virtue of punctuality makes little figure in treatises of Ethics, but it is of essential importance in the conduct of life; like common kitchen-salt&#x2014;scarce heeded by cooks and purveyors, tho&#x2019; without it, their wares would soon run to rottenness and ruin. You have managed these Book-concerns admirably: it is very probable that <hi rend="italic">in return</hi> for your diligence in that matter I may ere long trouble again.</p>
<p>A more suitable <hi rend="italic">return</hi> would have been to comply with your friendly wish to see me in Galloway, during this your holiday excursion. I have thought of it frequently since my arrival here; at one time I had well nigh determined on treating myself with that delicacy; but the wet weather made my resolutions waver; and the lateness of your visit has at length forced them to settle on the other side. I must be at Kinnaird on this day se&#x2019;ennight; I have yet seen no friend in Annandale, except those under my Father&#x2019;s roof: judge then if I <hi rend="italic">can</hi> set out for your native district when so circumstanced. I have still about fifty ways to go; and having a horse to take with me to the North, I am compelled to set out about Wednesday next, that I may not break down the &#x201C;gallant grey&#x201D; before seeing Perthshire. Therefore you must excuse me, for this once. Next year, unless the fates have written it otherwise, I intend that we shall ride in company thro&#x2019; the whole length and breadth of Brave Galloway, and spend ten days together in seeing all manner of sights and talking all manner of talk. Meanwhile I can only wish you may have better luck than I have had; may find fair skies and pleasant faces everywhere to welcome you, that so you may refresh you<supplied>[r]</supplied> faculties of head and heart for another and a busy winter in the city of stench and science (the <hi rend="italic">focush</hi> of both),<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;An old bankrupt minister had, while staying with Murray, always referred to Edinburgh as the &#x2018;focus (which he pronounced <hi rend="italic">focush</hi>) of Society.&#x2019;&#x201D; (Norton quotes this without giving his source.)</note> where I hope to see you many a, many a merry time.</p>
<p>This last month has been among the idlest and barrenest of my existence. My chief pleasure and employment has been galloping, no whither, amid wind and rain, for the mere sake of galloping. The weather! The weather! If it were not that all men women and children <pb id="pg-02-411" n="02:411"/>in the British Islands have exclaimed ten times a-day for the last six weeks: &#x201C;Bless me! <hi rend="italic">such</hi> weather!&#x201D; I too would say something very pithy on the subject. But what would it avail? Let it rain guns and bayonets, if it like; the less I say of it the better.</p>
<p>See that you get along with Stair<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Earl of Stair. See <ref target="volume-02/lt-18230617-TC-TM-01">TC to TM, <date when="1823-06-17">17 June</date></ref>.</note> and these worthies without delay. There is nothing in this world that will keep the Devil out of one, but hard labour. Of <hi rend="italic">my</hi> devils at least I may say: this kind goeth <hi rend="italic">not</hi> out by fasting and prayer. I will get the the [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] weather-gage of him yet the Thief after all. You should certainly inquire about the Earl of Selkirk:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly Thomas Douglas, fifth Earl of Selkirk (<date when="1771-00-00">1771</date>&#x2013;<date when="1820-00-00">1820</date>).</note> a very interesting thing might be made of him; and for you, <foreign><hi rend="italic">c&#x2019;est l&#xE0; votre m&#xE9;tier</hi></foreign> [that is your profession].</p>
<p>Jack and I are for Annan, spite of the clouds and <foreign><hi rend="italic">glar</hi></foreign>: he is fidgetting like some hen in an interesting condition. So I must leave you for the present. Try if you can write to me when you return to town: if not I will myself endeavour. In the end of <date when="1823-10-00">October</date> I hope to see you. Jack&#x2019;s compliments of the kindest sort to you. The people here all know you, and hope at a more convenient season to see your face.</p>
<p>Make my best respects to the Reverend gentleman of Girthon,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Jeffrey (<date when="1786-00-00">1786</date>&#x2013;<date when="1844-00-00">1844</date>), ordained in <date when="1818-00-00">1818</date>.</note> whom I regret that I have not seen and talked much sense and nonsense with; to the Misses Murray of Wigton;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In <date when="1826-12-00">December 1826</date> Murray married Janet Murray, daughter of Alexander Murray of Wigton.</note> to the <supplied>[mo]</supplied>st musical Jemima and her sister and all the people <supplied>[who]</supplied> care a doit about my worthless self. Jack is out of all bounds. <foreign>Adieu!</foreign> <closer><salute>I am always most faithfully yours</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Jane,</salute>
<p>Unless you have a letter for me already on the road, you need not send any hither to find me. I leave this place on Wednesday or Thursday<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >This letter was written on Sunday.</note> at farthest; I must be at Kinnaird against this day week. You are not gone to Haddington, or you would have given me notice; I can therefore entertain no hope of seeing you at this time: I must return into <pb id="pg-02-412" n="02:412"/>the Highlands with all my projects of that sort unfulfilled, applying the old and very ineffectual remedy, their everlasting &#x201C;patience,&#x201D; and looking forward to a kinder future, most probably that I may again be disappointed. If it were not that Fate is an inflexible thing, and calmness of mind a very great blessing, I should even now be tempted to break forth into something like the curse of Ernulphus<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <hi rend="italic">Tristram Shandy</hi>, Bk. III, chaps. x, xi, xii. Ernulf or Ernulphus (<date when="1040-00-00">1040</date>&#x2013;<date when="1124-00-00">1124</date>) was Bishop of Rochester.</note> against all the arrangements of this lower world. But it is far wiser to apply to you by way of intreaty, than to such a power as Fate by way of compulsion<supplied>[.]</supplied> I beg therefore and pray that, in consideration of all my late mischances, you will write letters to me more frequently and largely than ever. If you think me impudent in uttering such unconscionable wishes, consider that <hi rend="italic">you</hi> are almost all that yet survives to me, in a living shape, of the poetry of life. Year after year and tempest after tempest has passed over my little world, till it is grown grim and savage like the middle of a wilderness.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >An early expression of the &#x201C;Wasteland&#x201D; conception developed in &#x201C;The Everlasting No&#x201D; in <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi>.</note> But with you to enlighten it as a &#x201C;golden all-rejoicing Sun,&#x201D; its &#x201C;rocks bogs caves and dens of death&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi>, II, 621.</note> lose their horror, to become in some degree sublime; and the green <hi rend="italic">oases</hi> that besprinkle it shew like islands of the Blessed. No wonder that I long for your presence, or any emblem of it, more than aught in the world beside. If I were a great poet I would sing of it in strains that should live forever: but alas! I am a proser in every sense, and cannot speak of it, you see, except &#x201C;in King Cophetua&#x2019;s vein.&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <hi rend="italic">I Henry IV</hi>, II, iv; and Carlyle&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XXIII, 6. A. Carlyle states that &#x201C;King Cophetua&#x2019;s vein seems to have been that of remonstrance, King Cambyses&#x2019;, that of passion.&#x201D;</note> In prose therefore let me repeat my prayer, and leave the fulfilment of it with your own goodness, ever lenient to all my faults: Do not forget me, do not, above all things&#x2014;till you cannot help it; and write to me as nearly once a-day as your more important duties will possibly allow. Never dream that you have nothing to say: I like you best of all when you begin writing without a word to say; I am sure of a thousand delightful things when you abandon your soul to me without reserve, and send me all your &#x201C;diabolical&#x201D; thoughts and feelings just as they arise.&#x2014; Now is it not strange that I am ever wasting paper on this subject, long ago fixed as the law of the Medes and Persians which altereth not;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Dan. 6:12.</note> ever corresponding by talking about correspondence? Is it not strange that the Miser goes fifty times a-day to unbolt his strong-box, <pb id="pg-02-413" n="02:413"/>and see if his guineas <hi rend="italic">are</hi> there? Strange, if it were not frequent; and so it is with me. I can never make myself thoroughly believe that our correspondence will last, as I know our affection will; and anxieties on this point continually beset me. I perceive that by and by I am going to love you about ten times as well as I have ever done; and yet my hopes, if they deserved the name, are growing fainter every day. What will be the end of it? God only knows! In the mean time, let the end be as it will, do, for Heaven&#x2019;s sake, do shew me some plan of doing you useful service, and ten times more effectual than any thing I have yet accomplished. It is absolutely becoming in my view one of my most sacred duties to watch over your interests and improvement, to foster you, my bonny flower, that are yet wasting your sweetness on the desert air,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Gray&#x2019;s &#x201C;Elegy,&#x201D; st. 14.</note> but will in time be seen of all the world as well as me. Oh! if it were so; and I your protector and chosen stay, where is the man, or was, that I would change conditions with?</p>
<p>One thing I wish heartily, that you were home again, and once more settled at your employment. Poor Mus&#xE4;us! you will hardly get the smallest impression made upon him till winter will be here. And what is worse, this idle mode of life will be driving you entirely distracted. Patience! patience! yet a little while, and you will be secure from all these vexations; and happy, because employed in useful tasks. Translate these <foreign><hi rend="italic">Volksm&#xE4;hrchen</hi></foreign> in your best style, and they will answer admirably. You have also much to read and write, to consider and arrange. Be diligent and ever watchful: I will yet crown you with laurels with this hand, and steal twenty kisses for my pains. Forward! forward! let us both press towards the mark with unwearied perseverance; we shall both be happy, and by each other&#x2019;s means. This is the fixed persuasion of my reason, let the Devil tempt my imagination as he will. I will hold it fast as my integrity, till the last moment that I can hold it.</p>
<p>Have you actually &#x201C;admonished&#x201D; the great Centre of Attraction? If not, wait for two months, and you will see his &#x201C;raven locks and eagle eye&#x201D; as you have done of old, and may admonish him by word of mouth. I was at Annan; and found <hi rend="italic">the</hi> Argument for Judgement to come,<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edward Irving&#x2019;s book, published this year. Its origins are in the controversy over Southey&#x2019;s and Byron&#x2019;s poems &#x201C;The Vision of Judgment.&#x201D;</note> in a clear type, just arrived, and news that Irving himself was returning soon to the North&#x2014;to be married! The Lady is Miss Martin of Kirkcaldy&#x2014;so said his Mother.<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Irving was married on <date when="1823-10-13">13 October 1823</date> in Kirkcaldy Manse to Isabella Martin, daughter of the Rev. John Martin (<date when="1769-00-00">1769</date>&#x2013;<date when="1837-00-00">1837</date>), in Carlyle&#x2019;s eyes &#x201C;a precise innocent, didactic kind of man&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi>, II, 39). Froude has told the story of his engagement to Miss Martin, &#x201C;true to him through many years of tedious betrothal,&#x201D; and how Irving was nevertheless in love with Jane Welsh herself. He inferred that though Irving told Isabella and her father about his divided affections, they held him to the engagement &#x201C;as justice and Scotch custom entirely entitled them to do.&#x201D; All this had taken place in <date when="1822-00-00">1822</date>, when Irving had also expressed &#x201C;the most affectionate and tender regard&#x201D; for Jane, which &#x201C;would long ago have taken the form of the most devoted attachment, but for an intervening circumstance.&#x201D; In Froude&#x2019;s opinion, &#x201C;Mrs. Carlyle&#x2019;s character was profoundly affected by this early disappointment, and cannot be understood without a knowledge of it&#x201D;; and, as for Irving, from the time of his marriage &#x201C;the old, simple, unconscious Irving ceased to exist,&#x201D; and he began the decline which led straight to the tragedy of his belief in prophecy and the gift of &#x201C;tongues.&#x201D; &#x201C;There would have been no tongues,&#x201D; Froude quotes Jane as saying later, &#x201C;had Irving married me.&#x201D; However simplified Froude&#x2019;s biographical interpretation may be, there is no doubt that Irving, Jane, and Carlyle were very close and intimate in their understanding of one another. Irving had written to Jane (<date when="1822-09-09">9 Sept. 1822</date>) of the falsity of her admiration of high talents, satire, and energy, remarking of Carlyle, &#x201C;Oh that God would give rest to his mind, and instruct him in his truth. I meditate a work upon the alienation of clever men from their Maker,&#x201D; and from the first Carlyle recognized Irving&#x2019;s worth and weakness. In addition to Froude&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi> and Carlyle&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi>, see M. O. W. Oliphant, <hi rend="italic">The Life of Edward Irving</hi>, 2 vols. (London, <date when="1862-00-00">1862</date>); and A. L. Drummond, <hi rend="italic">Edward Irving and His Circle</hi> (London, <date when="1937-00-00">1937</date>).</note> On the whole I am sorry that Irving&#x2019;s <pb id="pg-02-414" n="02:414"/>preaching has taken such a turn. It had been much better, if without the gross pleasure of being a newspaper Lion and a season&#x2019;s wonder, he had gradually become, what he must ultimately pass for, a preacher of first rate abilities, of great eloquence and great absurdity, with a head fertile above all others in sense and nonsense, and a heart of the most honest and kindly sort. As it is, our friend incurs the risk of many vagaries and disasters, and at best the certainty of much disquietude. His path is steadfast and manly, in general only when he has to encounter opposition and misfortune; when fed with flatteries and prosperity, his progress soon changes into &#x201C;ground and lofty tumbling, &#x201D; accompan<supplied>[ied]</supplied> with all the hazards and confusion that usually attend this species of movement. With three newspapers to praise him and three to b<supplied>[lame]</supplied> with about six peers and six dozen right Honourables introduced to him every Sunday, tickets issuing for his church as if it were a theatre, and all the devout old women of the Capital treating him with comfits and adulation, I know that ere now he is &#x201C;striking the stars with his sublime head&#x201D;:<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Sublimi feriam sidera vertice</hi></foreign>&#x201D; (Horace, <hi rend="italic">Odes</hi>, I, i, 36).</note> well if he do not break his shins among the rough places of the ground! I wish we saw him safely down again, and walking as other men walk. The comfort is he has a true heart and genuine talents: so I conclude that after infinite flounderings and pitchings in the mud he will at last settle much about his true place, just as if this uproar had never taken place. For the rest, if he <pb id="pg-02-415" n="02:415"/>does not write to his friends, the reason is, not that he has ceased to love them, but that his mind is full of tangible interests continually before his face. With him at any time the present is worth twenty times the past and the future; and such a present as this he never witnessed before. I could wager any money that he thinks of you and me very often, tho&#x2019; he never writes to either; and that he longs above all to know what we do think of this monstrous flourishing of drums and trumpets in which he lives and moves. I have meant to write to him very frequently for almost three months; but I know not well how to effect it. He will be talking about &#x201C;the Lord,&#x201D; and twenty other things, which he himself only wishes to believe, and which to one that knows and loves him are truly painful to hear. See that you do not think unkindly of him; for except myself, there is scarcely a man in the world that feels more true concern for you.</p>
<p>Happy Irving that is fitted with a task which he loves and is equal to! He entertains no doubt that he is battering to its base the fortress of the Alien, and lies down every night to dream of planting the old true blue Presbyterian flag upon the summit of the ruins. When shall you and I make an onslaught upon the empire of Dulness and bring back <foreign><hi rend="italic">spolia opima</hi></foreign><note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;The <foreign><hi rend="italic">opima</hi></foreign> were the spoils which a Roman general could win only from the king or general of the enemy, whom he had slain with his own hands. They were therefore most highly prized and rarely won&#x201D; (A. Carlyle&#x2019;s note).</note> to dedicate to one another? Some day yet, I swear it! Let us fear nothing: but believe that diligence will conquer every difficulty, and act on that belief.&#x2014; Heaven grant I may get a letter from you are I go. My solitary ride will otherwise be full of vague and unpleasant speculations. At all events, you will not keep me waiting at Kinnaird. Tell me what are your purposes and proceedings, your hopes and fears. I send you all the crudities that enter my head: are we two not <hi rend="italic">friends forever</hi>? I will also see you soon tho&#x2019; I should ride from Dunkeld for that special purpose. God bless you, Jane! <closer><salute>I am ever yours</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Friend</salute>
<p>Your last letter was especially welcome&#x2014;it came in a lucky moment&#x2014; I had just been (or fancied I had been) most barbarously dealt <pb id="pg-02-416" n="02:416"/>with, and was ready to hang or drown myself in good earnest; but the sight of your handwriting can cheat me out of ill humour at any time&#x2014;it always presents so many delightful images, and excites so many delightful expectations! Oh you have no notion how great a blessing our correspondence is to me! When I am vexed I write my grievances to you; and the assurance I have that your next letter will bring me consolation, already consoles me&#x2014;and then, when your letter comes, when it repeats to me that <hi rend="italic">One</hi> in the world loves me&#x2014;will love me ever, ever; and tells me more boldly than Hope, that my future <hi rend="italic">may</hi> yet be glorious and happy, there is no obstacle I do not feel prepared to meet and conquer&#x2014; I owe you much! feelings and sentiments that ennoble my character, that give dignity interest and enjoyment to my life&#x2014;in return, I can only love you, and <hi rend="italic">that</hi> I do, from the bottom of my heart&#x2014;</p>
<p>You have known me in many curious predicaments but never so unhappily circumstanced as now&#x2014; Every hour this unlucky visit grows more irksome to me, <hi rend="italic">home</hi> more dear, and hope more distant&#x2014;my precious time, that is never to return, is passing on, on, and still I am doing nothing&#x2014;or worse than nothing&#x2014; &#x201C;<foreign>Ach! dieser gesch&#xE4; ftiger M&#xfc;ssiggang, es kommt mir sauer an!</foreign>&#x201D; [&#x201C;Ah! this strenuous idleness, it is hard on me!&#x201D;]<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A.

I have a notion it will be lying for me at Haddington&#x2014;keeping company with that unfortunate German (whose name I have never yet been able to read)&#x2014; When our illustrious Friend wrote for the four of his sermons,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edward Irving to Mrs. Welsh, <date when="1822-12-06">6 Dec. 1822</date>: &#x201C;Since I came to London I have preached in the Evening lectures on St. Luke, and the people are longing to have them published&#x2014;and so I have devoted the profits of a first edition to the new Church, and as I intend introducing the new volume with a discourse on the preparation for reading the scriptures, and concluding it with a discourse on the advantage of obeying them, I use the liberty of requesting from you the copy which I gave you of the four sermons&#x2014;I shall take care to return it safe and along with it a copy of the new-volume.&#x201D;</note> which he had &#x201C;introduced into my Mother&#x2019;s family, as <pb id="pg-02-417" n="02:417"/>the bequest of his parting&#x201D; (or rather departing) &#x201C;love&#x201D;; he promised in the most affecting terms, that &#x201C;these helps of our devotions&#x201D; should ere long be &#x201C;restored to us, under the more splendid title of Orations, and in the Garb of print&#x201D; (and much they needed some other &#x2018;garb&#x2019; than his crabbed hand; for all the time of their sojourn with us, no living soul could read them) but possibly he may not feel the same interest in our &#x2018;devotions&#x2019; now that he has so many other peoples to attend to&#x2014; Tell me&#x2014;did you write the critic [critique] on his book, which appeared in the Sunday Times&#x2014;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not Carlyle&#x2019;s.

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Before leaving this miserable city, in which I have been destined to experience so many vexations first and last, I determined in packing up my great-coat to enclose a piece of tartan in it to make you a cloak of. It was the best I could find; but surely the knaves have made me take nearly twice as much as was required. You can make yourself a substantial covering from the winter wind out of it in the first, and turn the rest into a scarf or what-soever you think fittest. Wear it when you go to Church or Market, in bad weather, and think with yourself that never mortal was more welcome to all the accommodation such a thing can afford, or more deserving of it at my hands. These little things are of no importance in themselves; but as pledges of mindfulness and affection, they become more valuable than aught else. Wear this, then, for my sake.</p>
<p>I purposed sending down a great-coat for my father; but none could I find of a suitable sort, under about three pounds&#x2019; price; and I doubted if some other more suitable gift could not be got for such a sum. I have therefore postponed the purchase of this, till I hear from home. I wish you would endeavour in a <hi rend="italic">clandestick</hi> way to ascertain what had best be done. I am <hi rend="italic">determined</hi> to send my worthy Father a gift of some kind: the only thing now is to decide what would be of <pb id="pg-02-419" n="02:419"/>most service to him. Tell me about it, or make Jack tell me: but mention no syllable of it to the goodman</p>
<p>I have the worst of pens, and my hand is very unsteady; besides I am just about to set forth on my journey. I have been lucky in the weather; but as usual very much disturbed in my sleep. I wish I were at Kinnaird, since I have left Mainhill. Farewell my dear Mother; you shall come and order my <hi rend="italic">cottage</hi> for me yet. <closer><salute>Sick or whole I am ever</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Jane,</salute>
<p>I have longed for the arrival of this day, as the reward of a week&#x2019;s disquietude and toil: I determined not to write, till I should have it in my power to say that I was settled at my tasks, and doing something however small. The miserable weather kept me four days later in arriving than I had expected: your letter (with a heap of meaner scrolls*) was waiting to welcome me. And such a welcome! I felt, in reading it and reading it again, as if it were more to me than the charter to all the metal of Potosi. What a frank and true and noble spirit is my Jane&#x2019;s! No artifice, no vulgar management; her sentiments come warm and fearless from her heart, because they are pure and honest as herself, and the friend whom she trusts, she trusts without reserve. I often ask myself: &#x201C;Is not all this a dream? Is it true that the most enchanting creature I have ever seen does actually love me? No! thank God it is not a dream: Jane loves me! she loves me! and I swear by the immortal powers that she shall yet be mine, as I am hers, thro&#x2019; life and death and all the dark and bright vicissitudes that await us here or hereafter.&#x201D; In more reasonable moments, I perceive that I am very selfish and almost mad. Alas! my fate is dreary and obscure and perilous: is it fit that you, whom I honour as among the fairest of God&#x2019;s works, whom I love more dearly than my own soul, should partake in it? No, my own best of Maidens, I will not deceive you. Think of me as of one that will live and die to do you service; whose good will, if his good deeds cannot, may perhaps deserve some gratitude; but whom it is dangerous and useless to love. If I were intellectual sovereign of all the world, if I were&#x2014; But it is vain to speculate: I know that I am nothing, I know not that I shall not always be so. The only thing I know is that you <pb id="pg-02-420" n="02:420"/>are the most delightful, enthusiastic, contemptuous, affectionate, sarcastic, capricious, warm-hearted, lofty-minded, half-devil, half-angel of a woman that ever ruled over the heart of a man; that I will love you, must love you, whatever may betide, till the last moment of my existence; and that if we both act rightly our lot <hi rend="italic">may</hi> be the happiest of a thousand mortal lots. So let us cling to one another (&#x2014;if you dare when thus forewarned)&#x2014;forever and forever! Let us put faith in one another, and live in hope that prospects so glorious and heavenly will not end in darkness and despair. If your happiness be shipwrecked by my means, then woe, woe is to me without end! But it will not: no, you will yet be blessed yourself in making me more blessed than man has right to look for being upon Earth. God bless you my heart&#x2019;s darling; and grant that our honest purposes may prosper in our hands!</p>
<p>All these incoherent inconsistent things you have often heard already: but you will bear with me in uttering them yet again. For me no subject connected with our correspondence and affection for each other needs the charm of novelty to make it interesting. If it were repeated to me fifty times a day that you loved me, I should still desire to hear it oftener. For the present, however, I must let you go.</p>
<p>How is it that you have lost all influence with your Mother, that she will not return and let you be at rest? I declare even I am beginning to get vexed at these delays. No wonder that you murmur, that you have given patience to the winds, and become determined to look on Templand only as a place of torment. That &#x201C;strenuous idleness&#x201D; was not made for minds like yours. Yet what is to be done? You have forsworn the understrapping virtue of submissive endurance; cannot you betake yourself to the more profitable resources of activity? Might you not write to the little Doctor to send you down Mus&#xE4;us [in large capitals] (can you read it now?) from the coach-office; and then bolt your chamber-door, and sit down to <hi rend="italic">render</hi> it, in Nithsdale as in Lothian? If you are not to depart in a week or two, I do think you should try this. These <hi rend="italic">Volksmahrchen</hi> are a promising enough kind of task for you: you will translate them excellently, I have no fear; and Boyd<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Boyd, of Oliver and Boyd, publishers.</note> to whom I talked on the subject, as I last went thro&#x2019; Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, is all in trim to have them published. I think they will make a very pretty volume, and a fair commencement of your intellectual labours. About your talents and ultimate success I have less doubt every day. No soul so vehement, no heart so fine as yours, but must ultimately come to light, to full development and full reward, in spite of difficulties far weightier than yours. Be restless, then, but not unhappy at <pb id="pg-02-421" n="02:421"/>your present isolation. I would ride their horses to death, and dispute every word they said, till they let me go. Long before <date when="1823-10-00">October</date>, when I see you, you will have advanced far into Mus&#xE4;us; full of ardent thoughts and cheered by gleams of celestial promise, you will have exchanged the residence of &#x201C;Hell&#x201D; for a region that stretches to the neighbourhood of heaven. If you are so delicious in <hi rend="italic">that</hi> ugly abode, what will you be in the other! Be at peace, then, if you can, till the hour of freedom arrive. There is a long and brilliant life before you: trust in yourself and me, my best beloved Jane; and fear nothing. For you I am still a prophet of good not of evil. Stand to your task, and there is no danger.</p>
<p>You ask me what are my employments and my plans; you speak to me like my guardian Angel as you are. My feelings you seem perfectly to understand; I thank you a thousand times for your encouragements and sympathy; and I still hope however feebly that a day will come when you will say that they have not been in vain. Alas! no! I am not satisfied: my mind is a prey to everlasting strife when I contrast what I would be with what I am. There is a restless ardour in my heart as in yours. Like you I am ambitious, far too much so, tho&#x2019; I phrase it otherwise; but the root of my inquietude lies far deeper than yours. My character is full of contradictions; outwardly, on the surface as it were, I am timid as a leveret; while within there are feelings that might suit a tiger&#x2014;fierce, desperate, deep tormenting feelings! Hence a perpetual inconsistency in my conduct; hence my habit<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle first wrote <hi rend="italic">principle</hi> and then struck it out and wrote <hi rend="italic">habit</hi>.</note> is less to act than to endure; hence the great principle that moves me is little better than a kind of&#x2014;desperation. Poor Gentleman! I wonder what is to be done with him at last. A difficulty harder than all and partly peculiar I have yet to mention. O how often, when sicker than I am now, have I prayed that I might but be broken on the wheel every morning, and then have nothing more to do with pain! O! thrice and four times accursed &#x201C;physical disease&#x201D;; Tophet has not in its recesses such a tremendous scourge as thou! But what avails it to speculate? This evil also is but another element in the Chaos of materials out of which the intellect and the will (if any) are to create a glorious and manly history. This Evil too I will overcome. I have brought a horse out with me hither; I am trying every precaution to keep myself in tolerable health; in three weeks if I find that I <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> live here without the loss of that priceless blessing, I shall return to Mainhill&#x2014;where a single month had almost made me whole. Meanwhile too I am not unemployed: after long <hi rend="italic">re</hi>-deliberations, I have been decided (by the <pb id="pg-02-422" n="02:422"/>Bookseller)<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Boyd, whose firm was to be the Edinburgh publisher of <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister</hi>.</note> to go on with Goethe. Ten pages a day is my task: with riding, and teaching and other drivelling, I seldom get begun till six at night. Some parts of Meister are very stupid; and it is all very difficult to translate.

<salute>My dear Jack,</salute>
<p>I imagine I cannot better shew my gratitude for the last long, kind and handsome letter you sent me so pointedly, than by writing immediately at equal length in return. So I have shoved Meister aside, snuffed my candles, taken out my best pen, and begun with the greatest alacrity in my very smallest hand. To-morrow is not post-day; but I propose going down to Dunkeld in the afternoon, for the purposes <pb id="pg-02-423" n="02:423"/>of getting back your watch from the Cleaner, of bespeaking a pair of strong shoes, and, tho&#x2019; last not least, of persuading the Commercial Banker to give me cash for a draught from Buller of &#xa3;100, which has lain waiting for a week in my desk. I will take this paper down with me&#x2014;with all my news.</p>
<p>The first head on which you will require satisfaction will as usual be the state of my thrice despicable health. Happy would it make me and you Jack, could I say that this was as it should be; or even that it was visibly in the road of improvement, compared with the condition you last saw it in. This alas! I can hardly say. I have had various ups and downs since I parted from you; but the day I left Mainhill is still the best in point of bodily vigour that I have since seen. I sleep irregularly here; and feel a little, very little, more than my usual share of torture every day. What the cause is, it would puzzle me to explain, within the limits I could here assign it. I take exercise sufficient daily, I attend with rigorous minuteness to the quality of my food, I take all precautions that I can; yet still the disease abates not. I should be an unreasonable blockhead did I complain of the conduct of Mr or Mrs B. towards me; <hi rend="italic">any</hi> arrangement that I could suggest would I have not a doubt be most cheerfully complied with; much trouble they have already had with me: but their good resolutions and enactments required to be <hi rend="italic">executed</hi> by a pack of lazy careless and irregular waiting men and women, and often in this wasteful transmission, their good-will comes my length almost void. It is the hundred little petty omissions and commissions of these <foreign><hi rend="italic">cannaille</hi></foreign>, coupled with the small inquietudes and vexations&#x2014;small but often returning&#x2014;of my official employments, that chiefly act against me, and render this Kinnaird a worse place for me than Mainhill. Pity that it were so! I might else be very happy. Here am I sitting in this far Highland glen, under a fair autumn night, with my clear fire of oak sticks blazing near me, my books and tackle all around me, and no sound at all, but now and then the faint modest twang of honest James Gow&#x2019;s fiddle, who is solacing his labours by this not usual gratification&#x2014;partly I suppose because he sees the sky beautiful and mild and kind, and feels in spirits he knows not why. Till eleven o&#x2019;clock no soul will disturb me, and then only for ten minutes. The boys and old people and all seem to grow in their esteem for me. It is very hard!</p>
<p>But what avails its hardness or softness either? Let us have done with whining on the subject, and consider what steps can be taken to remedy it. Often and long have I meditated that point since I came hither. I have cudgelled my brains till they are sore to seek me deliverance; <pb id="pg-02-424" n="02:424"/>for like Joseph of Austria,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Joseph II (<date when="1741-00-00">1741</date>&#x2013;<date when="1790-00-00">90</date>), whose power was greatly limited by his mother Maria Theresa and who consequently resorted to cunning to achieve his ends.</note> <foreign><hi rend="italic">par ma t&#xEA;te seule</hi></foreign> [by my brains alone] must I get help, if I get help at all. This then Jack have I in view at present. The Bullers, I mean the old gentry with Miss Pole,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-02/lt-18230624-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1823-06-24">24 June</date></ref>.</note> are gone to Aberdeen to dance and kick up a racket with some Caledonian Hunt or other, and will not be back for ten days. Against the time of their return, if I am not better than I have been lately, I shall say to them: &#x201C;My very noble and approved good Masters, allow me to ask what you purpose doing thro&#x2019; the winter with your boys? If to go to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, can I be any way accommodated there so that I shall have the <hi rend="italic">entire command</hi> of my eating and drinking, sleeping waking and general regimen? If so, then I shall be very glad to serve you. To stay here as you once proposed? The plan I doubt not may be attended with a thousand benefits; but for my poor share of it, I have distinctly ascertained that my <foreign><hi rend="italic">kerkage</hi></foreign> cannot stand it without manifest and permanent injury, and therefore with the most profound &#x201C;<foreign>dorsoflexions</foreign>&#x201D; [bows] I beg leave to wish you all good morning, as soon as may be.&#x201D;</p>
<p>So here you see the matter rests. I care not the tossing of a half-penny whether I go or stay. If I go I have money enough to keep me for a year or two; I can obtain plenty of literary tasks, and get them done about five times as effectually as now. If I stay, I shall gather a hundred or two additional pounds, and have the privilege of living for the winter in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, where my engagements <hi rend="italic">call</hi> me to be at any rate; I shall leave it in Spring with books and pens and fresh undertakings; we shall get some accommodation furbished up at Mainhill (the old peat-house or some hole), where by the aid of Bardolph<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >His horse.</note> and my faithful Mother I am nearly certain I can quite recover my health; I shall be very busy; and we shall all live together as merry as maltmen. So I cast my cap into the air in defiance of all things yet: for the spirit that is in me is still unbroken, as the spirit of that old lame duck you have at home, who trusts, tho&#x2019; at present winged and mashed in both her limbs, that she shall yet by the blessing of Providence lay above five shillings&#x2019; worth of eggs, and be useful in her day and generation.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, my good Jack, you will be happy to know that I am not a moment idle here, that I can help being so. Boyd pressed me to go on with <hi rend="italic">Meister</hi>; so I re-commenced it, and have employed in the business every hour that I could spare from teaching and riding. Ten pages a day were my task; but I have never yet any day made it <pb id="pg-02-425" n="02:425"/>wholly good. Do as I will it is six in the evening before I can get begun. We meet (my boys and I) at half pas<supplied>[t]</supplied> eight; I rarely get a ride before this, but in return, we now breakfast with <supplied>[the]</supplied> family near ten, and that answers equally well. I then trot about from one till almost three, then dine, then out at half-past five for another walk or ride, then in for tea or porridge (which however they make very ill, and the last two nights for the want of meal, not at all&#x2014;the tea however I make <hi rend="italic">myself</hi>), and then write till I am fairly tired. I start and fidget about the bed some time between half an hour and two hours, and then sleep with several strange and sometimes several nasty things to occupy my fancy, till seven in the morning summons me to new consciousness and new toil.</p>
<p>But is there nothing in me save sheer egotism, everlasting talk about my most pitiful self? I meant to send you some counsels and encouragements and all the rest some memorials of my love. The space is done now; and happily they are not needed. Go on with your materia medica, your German, your general reading; and tell me all <hi rend="italic">all</hi> about it next time you write. Study a profession my brave fellow that may set you (and who knows but me too?) above the fear of want; then you can devote your superfluous time to any sort of mental culture, without the demons of poverty and cleanness of teeth eyeing you askance every step you take in any such pursuit. There <hi rend="italic">is</hi> stuff in that monstrous <foreign>jobbernowl</foreign> [head] of thine, and thou hast a true heart, boy; so Heaven prosper thee, and make thee in time the man thou <hi rend="italic">mayest</hi> yet become! I ask nothing more.</p>
<p>Tell our brave Alick that I wait anxiously for his letter&#x2014;the first very first spare hour or two he has. Let him tell me his jobbings (if any) and all his concerns in his own rugged but strong and graphic way. He is yet to be a man of note in his way I entertain no doubt. My heart&#x2019;s love to all the others from the worthy <hi rend="italic">spinster</hi> Mag (and Nancy<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably his cousin, Nancy Grierson.</note> if she is there) down to wee Jenny the seeker of eggs. I have heard no word of Johnston, nor indeed written to him. Irving&#x2019;s Book is come three days ago&#x2014;Mrs Buller bought it. I have read but one oration&#x2014;for it is rather dull to my sense. I fear it will hardly do. There is a fierce and very spiteful review of it and him in the last Blackwood; he has also been meanly and badly dealt with by some wretches in the Liberal, the Times &#x26;c &#x26;c.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;The Rev. Mr. Irving&#x2019;s Orations,&#x201D; by J. G. Lockhart, <hi rend="italic">Blackwood&#x2019;s Magazine</hi>, XIV (<date when="1823-08-00">Aug. 1823</date>), 145&#x2013;62; &#x201C;Pulpit Oratory.

There are several references to Irving in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> of about this date, all generally unfavorable.</note> I dread also that he is standing <pb id="pg-02-426" n="02:426"/><hi rend="italic">a-tiptoe</hi> on the summit of Fortune&#x2019;s wheel; so if it turn, smash he comes with his nose first upon the causeway! Poor Irving! and yet he is a good fellow, a true friend as breathes. What do you think in proof of the latter quality, he had done with that &#x201C;Life of Schiller&#x201D; which I should only have exchanged against <hi rend="italic">blackman</hi>? Delivered it to Taylor, who is clear for publishing it in the guise of a <hi rend="italic">Book</hi>&#x2014;will give fair terms &#x26;c! I have not written to Irving yet; they want me to invite him hither. <foreign>Basta</foreign> [Enough]! <closer><salute>My dear Jack, I am ever your&#x2019;s</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Friend</salute>
<p>Your letter only reached me this morning, having sojourned at Templand more than ten days, &#x201C;expecting an opportunity&#x201D;&#x2014; Charming <pb id="pg-02-427" n="02:427"/>as it is, I could almost wish it had not cast up at all; for it has troubled me more than I can tell&#x2014; I feel there is need I should answer it without delay&#x2014; And what can I say to you? it is so hard to explain one&#x2019;s self in such a situation! but I must! and in plain terms; for any reserve at present were criminal and might be very fatal in its consequences to both&#x2014;</p>
<p>You misunderstand me&#x2014;you regard me no longer as a friend, a sister; but as one who at some future period may be more to you than both&#x2014; is it not so? is it not true that you believe me, like the bulk of my silly sex, incapable of entertaining a strong affection for a man of my own age without having for it&#x2019;s ultimate object our union for life? &#x201C;Useless and dangerous to love you&#x201D;! &#x201C;my happiness wrecked by you&#x201D;!&#x2014; I cannot have misinterpreted your meaning! And my God what have I said or done to mislead you into an error so destructive to the confidence that subsist<supplied>[s]</supplied> betwixt us, so dangerous to the peace of us both? In my treatment of you I have indeed disregarded all maxims of womanly prudence, have shaken myself free from the shackles of etiquette&#x2014; I have loved and admired you for your noble qualities, and for the extraordinary affection you have shewn me: and I have told you so without reserve or disguise&#x2014;but <hi rend="italic">not</hi> till our repeated quarrels had produced an explanation betwixt us, which I foolishly believed would gauruntee [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] my future conduct from all possibility of misconstruction&#x2014; I have been to blame&#x2014; I might have foreseen that such implicite confidence might mislead you as to the nature of my sentiments, and should have expressed my friendship for you with a more prudent reserve&#x2014;but it is of no use talking of what I might or should have done in the time past&#x2014; I have only to repair the mischief in as far as I can, now that my eyes are opened to it now that I am startled to find our relation actually assuming the aspect of an engagement for life&#x2014;</p>
<p>My Friend I love you&#x2014; I repeat it tho&#x2019; I find the e<supplied>[x]</supplied>pression a rash one&#x2014;all the best feelings of my nature are concerned in loving you&#x2014; But were you my Brother I would love you the same, were I married to another I would love you the same&#x2014;and is this sentiment so calm, so delightful&#x2014;but so unimpassioned enough to recompense the freedom of my heart, enough to reconcile me to the existence of a married woman the hopes and wishes and ambitions of which are all different from mine, the cares and occupations of which are my disgust&#x2014; Oh no! Your Friend I will be, your truest most devoted friend, while I breath<supplied>[e]</supplied> the breath of life; but your wife! never never! Not <pb id="pg-02-428" n="02:428"/>though you were as rich as Cr&#x9c;sus, as honoured and renowned as you yet shall be&#x2014;</p>
<p>You may think I am viewing the matter by much too seriously&#x2014;taking fright where there is noth<supplied>[ing]</supplied> to fear&#x2014; It is well if it be so! But, suffering as I am at this very moment from the horrid pain of seeing a true and affectionate heart near breaking for my sake, it is not to be wondered at tho&#x2019; I be overanxious for your peace on which my own depends in a still greater degree&#x2014; Write to me and reassure me&#x2014;for God&#x2019;s sake reassure me if you can! Your Friendship at this time is almost necessary to my existence. Yet I will resign it cost what it may&#x2014;will, will resign it if it can only be enjoyed at the risk of your future peace&#x2014;</p>
<p>I had many things to say to you&#x2014;about Mus&#xe6;us and all that. but I must wait till another opportunity&#x2014; At present I scarcely know what I am about&#x2014;</p>

<salute>My dear Jack,</salute>
<p>I got your letter last Friday, on returning from a roe-hunt, which we had all been assisting at in the wood of the hill beside us. A sorrier piece of entertainment, I may observe, is not to be met with in this kingdom. They went hallooing and beating the bushes and talking gaelic; the gun-men standing at certain determined points with their pieces ready; and I driving on Mrs B. and a wretched old clout of a white pony she was riding on, or doing my best to keep her in talk while we sat for hours in open places among the health. In the course of the day they got two fawns, about as large as your longeared Warlock;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The name of some animal, possibly a dog, owned by John.</note> in value somewhere about sixpence a-piece; and thought it royal sport. Reginald de la Pole shot them both, and never was victor at the olympic games more charmed with his laurels: Richard Buller<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Nephew of Mr. Buller. See <ref target="volume-02/lt-18230624-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1823-06-24">24 June</date></ref>.</note> the other &#x201C;Oxford Scholar&#x201D; declared on the first occasion he would have given &#x201C;a sovereign for that shot&#x201D;; after the <pb id="pg-02-429" n="02:429"/>second, he became chop-fallen and spoke little more for four and twenty hours. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Sic itur ad astra</hi></foreign> [Thus one rises to the stars].<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Vergil, <hi rend="italic">Aeneid</hi>, IX, 641.</note></p>
<p>I came away in the middle of it, and found your kind and honest letter waiting on my table. I know not what I should do if I had not Mainhill, and some one to talk with there. It absolutely consoles me very greatly to get a letter from home, or to send one. I have only to request that you will persevere as diligently as you have begun; letting <hi rend="italic">no</hi> ten-days escape without some such present. Write about any thing or every thing, no matter what.</p>
<p>I might have been in better trim for answering you; but if I delay any longer you may become anxious about me. So you shall have your epistle, before going to the sermon&#x2014;if you like to call for it&#x2014;as you had last time. I am sorry that I have not better news to send you: there has still been no very marked improvement in my state of health; and I find the Bullers are determined to stay here with us all winter. If I had any quiet place to retire to, I believe I should be tempted to throw up my commission to-morrow, and set forth to try the voyage on another tack as I must ere long do at any rate. But there is none! Mainhill must be full of bustle and confusion and disquietude at this time&#x2014;unfit for the purposes of literary labour, and so incapable of yielding me any permanent solace, or advantage even in the matter of health. Of Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, of living in lodgings there with <foreign><hi rend="italic">Manties</hi></foreign><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Garment makers. See <ref target="volume-02/lt-18220315-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1822-03-15">15 March 1822</date></ref>.</note> and stenches and horrors more than tongue can tell to drive me to despair, I cannot think without a cold shudder, which scarcely the prospect of the gallows could bring over me. Many a man I am sure has been tried by fifteen<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Scottish criminal cases are tried before a jury of fifteen, of which a simple majority can convict or acquit or bring in the verdict of &#x201C;not proven.&#x201D;</note> of his peers and fairly doomed and hanged and quartered by the doctors, with less torment than I have suffered in that fatal city, for no cause at all. <hi rend="italic">Thither</hi> therefore I will not go, on such terms&#x2014;unless I absolutely cannot help it. <hi rend="italic">What</hi> then shall I do? In days when wrecked with want of sleep and all its infernal <foreign>etcetera&#x2019;s</foreign> I am sometimes within an inch of writing to Buller to signify my resolution of departing&#x2014;I know not how or whither. But their kindness to me, and the reflection of my inability to mend the matter certainly, and the risk I run of making it considerably worse, always shuts my mouth. Next day perhaps I shall sleep better, and become as lively as a hawk, and think I might exist here long enough very comfortably. Thus I vary and vacillate; most probably it will <pb id="pg-02-430" n="02:430"/>long be so. It seems likely that I shall just <foreign><hi rend="italic">thring</hi></foreign> [press] <hi rend="italic">on</hi> here till I get very desperate some day, and cut and run.</p>
<p>Meanwhile I make a point of going on with Goethe. Ten pages I find more than I can almost ever execute; for it is very hard; and I scarcely ever get fairly into the spirit of it till I must leave it off. If I take tea at night I am lively for three or four hours; but I sleep none, and next day I could <hi rend="italic">eat the wind</hi>. If I take porridge which I almost always do, the chances are that I shall succeed in sleeping, &#x201C;to a certain extent&#x201D;; but it gives me headache, and makes <supplied>[me]</supplied> stupid as a fatted pig. Besides it is six o&#x2019;clock at night before ever I get begun. So that I seldom exceed seven or eight pages. One day, when left altogether to myself, I scarcely exceeded eighteen. <hi rend="italic">Nevertheless</hi> I <foreign><hi rend="italic">gar mysel</hi></foreign> [make myself: underscored twice] (as our Father would do) go on with this thing: and accordingly my keep-lesson <hi rend="italic">is</hi> travelling slowly but surely thro&#x2019; poetry and prose to the end of the volume. I am now more than half thro&#x2019; the first: it will all be ready long ere spring. <hi rend="italic">You and I</hi> could do it in four weeks, if we had quiet quarters, and the fiend would give me any respite. I am sometimes tempted to sally off and <hi rend="italic">get it done so</hi>, then have it printed in winter, then take to something different and better&#x2014;down to Mainhill&#x2014;to work and toil, and work and toil as if I were a <hi rend="italic">brownie</hi> not a man, till I have conquered all these mean impediments that hem in the free-bond heaventending soul. I say Jack thou and I must <hi rend="italic">never</hi> faulter. Work, my Boy, work unweariedly: for I swear that all the thousand miseries of this hard fight, and ill-health the most terrific of them all shall never chain us down. By the River Styx it shall not! Two fellows from a nameless spot in Annandale shall yet shew to the world the pluck that is in Carlyles. Fear not! Tire not! In due time we shall reap if we faint not.</p>
<p>I am writing in an awful hurry; for my time is almost expired, and this is post-day. When you write again (<hi rend="italic">let it be instanter</hi>!), I will answer you more at large. Push on with your studies; and get us a piece of bread that our souls may live. Are you going on with German? Are you in the Materia medica? Have you done with Buffon? Tell me all and sundry that you are doing and intending. Also take abundant bodily exercise. Do not&#x2014;do not (for the love of God!) get this baleful distemper fixed upon you: it hangs like a mill-stone round the neck; all but the strongest swimmer it will sink to the bottom, and bury in fathoms five of oozy mud. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Festina lente</hi></foreign> [Make haste slowly]!

Never mind; take what you need from Alick or write to me and you shall have a draught for plenty&#x2014; which latter plan I think will be the better; for I want Alick to carry on his traffic, and I long to hear the details (tell him) of what he has already done in that way.</p>
<p>Bardolph<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The pony which his brother Alexander had bought for him and which Carlyle had brought from Mainhill to Kinnaird.</note> is doing very well: I have been upon his back every day (except just two) since he came hither; yet I do not get him ridden sufficiently&#x2014;for my own benefit whatever I may do for his. The roads are such that I never venture on them without longing to have all the celtic road-makers (road-marrers rather) bound up in one large halter that I might hang them all at a swing. Broken bottles would be soft and smo<supplied>[o]</supplied>th compared with many pieces of this turnpike.</p>
<p>Your harvest must look very ill at present. It began raining on Saturday night, and rained in floods till yesterday. The mercury is up now, and we again anticipate good weather. Nothing here is cut worth speaking of; much still is green. Tell our father and above all our Mother not to drudge and hurt themselves in this untoward season. Crops and the value of crops may be valued in money, and replaced by it; but health never, never.&#x2014; But I must now be going: they have saddled my pony; and I must out to ride. The post will be here in a few minutes. I shall look for a letter <hi rend="italic">immediately</hi>. Remember me in unalterable affection to one who never forgets me, my good true-hearted Mother. May God b<supplied>[l]</supplied>ess her and all of you! Tell Alick that I long to hear from him about all his merchandize. My Father I meant to write to ere this: but it little matters who gets my letters, for they are a common good&#x2014;or common evil unless they mend in the news they bring.

<salute>My dear Jane,</salute>
<p>If I were not a fool of some standing, I should not have vexed you on this occasion, or given you this fresh opportunity of testifying how true is the affection which you bear me. Your letter has set me a-thinking about matters which, with my accustomed heedlessness, I was letting take their course without accurate investigation, tho&#x2019; conscious that a right understanding of them was of vital consequence to both of us. I honour your wisdom and decision: you have put our concerns <hi rend="italic">on the very footing where I wished them to stand</hi>. So be of good cheer, for no harm is done.</p>
<p>When I placed the management of our intercourse and whatever mutual interests we had or might have entirely at your own disposal, making you sole queen and arbitress of the &#x201C;commonweal,&#x201D; I stipulated for myself as much freedom of speech as you could conveniently grant, leaving to you an unbounded power of acting, then and in all time coming. It is to the terms of this <hi rend="italic">compact</hi> that I still adhere in their widest acceptation. I know very well you will never be my wife. Never! Never!&#x2014; I never believed it above five minutes at a time all my days. &#x201C;Tis all one as I should love a bright particular star, and think to wed it.&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">All&#x2019;s Well That Ends Well</hi>, I, i.</note> My fancy can form scenes, indeed, which with you to share them were worthy of a place in the heaven above; but there are items wanting, without which all these blessings were a curse, and which not your consent (if that were ever to be dreamed of) nor any influence of man can assure me of realizing. Such illusions do in truth haunt me, nor am I very sedulous to banish them. The harsh hand of Time will do it speedily enough without help of mine, and leave no truth behind that will ever give me half the pleasure. I grant it is absurd, and might be more than absurd, to utter them so freely: but what then? They give a momentary pleasure to myself, and do harm to no one. Strip life of all its baseless hopes and beautiful chimeras; it seems to me there would be little left worth having.</p>
<p>Thus then it stands. You love me as a sister, and will not wed: I love you in all possible senses of the word, and will not wed, any more than you. Does this reassure you? If so, let us return to our old <pb id="pg-02-433" n="02:433"/>position: let me continue writing what comes into my head, and do you continue acting now or forever after just as you judge best. I seek no engagement, I will make none. By God&#x2019;s blessing, I will love you with all my heart and all my soul, while the blood continues warm within me; I will reverence you as the fairest living emblem of all that is most exalted and engaging in my conceptions of human nature; I will help you according to my slender power, and stand by you closer than a brother: but these feelings are entertained for myself alone; let them be their own reward, or go unrewarded&#x2014;that is <hi rend="italic">my</hi> concern. So long as you have charity to hear me talk about affections that must end in nothingness, and plans which seem destined to be all abortive, I will speak and listen; when you tire of this, when you marry, or cast me off in any of the thousand ways that fortune is ever offering, I shall of course cease to correspond with you, I shall cease to love Mrs &#x2014;&#x2014;, but not Jane Welsh; the image she will have left in my mind I shall always love, for even this tho&#x2019; the original is gone forever, will still have more reality than mere fantasies that would replace it. In all this I see no blame; and if there were, I cannot help it. Had it pleased Providence to plant some other standard of excellence in me, or make you different from what you are, then I should have felt and acted otherwise: but as it is, I am no free agent. For the rest, do not fear the consequence so far as I am concerned. My heart is too old by almost half a score of years, and made of sterner stuff than to break in junctures of that kind. Had it not been harder than the nether millstone it must have shivered into fragments very long ago. I have no idea of dying in the Arcadian shepherd style, for the disappointment of hopes which I never seriously entertained, or had no right to entertain seriously.</p>
<p>Now, in the name of the ever blessed Trinity, have I done with these preliminaries? Ass that I was in forcing you to ask them! I confess it grieves me to address you in this cold formal style, as if writing to my Taylor for a suit of clothes, and directing him where to cut and where to spare; not to my own best Jane, the friend of my soul, from whom I have no secrets or separate interests, and whom I love because she has no secrets from me. Let us forget it altogether, and be as we were! If you <hi rend="italic">will</hi> part with me, do it; but not for <hi rend="italic">my</hi> sake! For my sake, I call God to witness, you never shall. Again I say, let us forget it utterly, forever and ever!</p>
<p>These woful explanations I judged it right to send without a moment&#x2019;s delay: your comfort seemed to be concerned in their being <pb id="pg-02-434" n="02:434"/>given you instantly. You must not count this as <hi rend="italic">any letter</hi> or your last as any: but write to me again in your own careless style, <hi rend="italic">about Mus&#xE4;us and all that</hi>, just as if this thing had never happened. I long to be again introduced to your home at Haddington, to share in all your tasks and difficulties, to cherish your fainting hopes, and tell you a thousand times without stint or fear of reproof that you are dearer to me than aught in life, and that united we will conquer every difficulty, and be two glorious characters&#x2014;if it so please the Fates.</p>
<p>This last proviso seems a needful one for me at present, tho&#x2019; in your case I esteem it little. I appear to be fast going to the devil here; my health is getting worse every week; I sleep at the easy rate of three or four hours per night, and feel throughout the day in the most beatific humour! If it had not been that the people are kind to me as if I were their son, I had been gone ere now. They design staying here all winter: I will try it another month; and if without improvement, I mount the horse Bardolph, and turn my face back again to the plain country. I was looking out, while there, in the valley of Milk,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A small river in Annandale.</note> for some cottage among trees, beside the still waters; some bright little place, with a stable behind it, a garden and a rood of green,&#x2014;where I might fairly commence housekeeping, and the writing of books! They laughed at me, and said it was a joke. Well! I swear it is a lovely world this, after all. What a pity that we had not <hi rend="italic">five</hi> score years and ten of it!</p>
<p>Meanwhile I go on with Goethe&#x2019;s Wilhelm Meister; a book which I love not, which I am sure will never sell, but which I am determined to print and finish. There are touches of the very highest most etherial genius in it; but diluted with floods of insipidity, which even <hi rend="italic">I</hi> would not have written for the world. I sit down to it every night at six, with the ferocity of a hyaena; and in spite of all obstructions my keep-lesson is more than half thro&#x2019; the first volume, and travelling over poetry and prose, slowly but surely to the end. Some of the poetry is very bad, some of it rather good. The following is mediocre&#x2014;the worst kind.</p>
<lg><l>Who never ate his bread in sorrow,</l>
<l>Who never spent the darksome hours</l>
<l>Weeping, and watching for the morrow,</l>
<l>He knows you not, ye gloomy Powers.</l> <pb id="pg-02-435" n="02:435"/><l>To Earth, this weary Earth, ye bring us,</l>
<l>To guilt ye let us heedless go,</l>
<l>Then leave repentance fierce to wring us:</l>
<l>A moment&#x2019;s guilt, an age of woe!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister, Works</hi>, XXIII, 167&#x2013;68.</note></l></lg>
<p>And now my own best Jane, before leaving you, what more have I to ask? That you would love me forever, in any way, on any terms you please; that you continue while we both live to make me the confidant of all your sorrows and enjoyments great and small; and above all that you would find me means of doing you some essential service&#x2014;something that might make our intercourse and affection more than a pleasing dream, when God shall see meet to put an end to it forever. Shew me, O! shew me how I may benefit you. I declare I shall not be able to die contented or sleep in my grave if I have done you no good. Write to me <hi rend="italic">instantly</hi>, to &#x201C;reassure <hi rend="italic">me</hi>.&#x201D; Tell me <hi rend="italic">all</hi> things that concern you&#x2014;, <hi rend="italic">all things</hi>. God bless you my dearest! Do with me as you like, <closer><salute>I am ever yours with all my soul!</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Johnston,</salute>
<p>I have already been guilty of a sin of omission in neglecting so long to send you a letter; I fear I shall now only change it into one of commission by writing to you in the dullest style that ever man used to man. The weather is as delightfully dripping to-day as it has been constantly for the last ten weeks; I am solitary, idle or disgusted with my work; and cheerful, warm and inspiriting as the Greenland Moon. Nevertheless being very anxious to learn how it fares with you, and <pb id="pg-02-436" n="02:436"/>finding that you will not write till I set you the example, I attack you in spite of all disadvantages.</p>
<p>How <hi rend="italic">has</hi> that Cupar concern<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Months before, in an undated letter (MS: NLS, 1764.239), Johnston had written how, unhappy in his situation at Broughty-Ferry, he had applied for a teaching position at Cupar, in Fifeshire, a few miles west of St. Andrews. Replying to Carlyle on <date when="1823-09-26">26 Sept.</date>, Johnston said that nothing had come of his application.</note> been finally decided&#x2014;for decided it must needs be ere now? Are you to go thither, or to Dundee, or Annandale or whither? Is your health good? Your spirits? How <hi rend="italic">is</hi> the world wagging<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">As You Like It</hi>, II, vii.</note> with you in all its various departments? Such are the questions which I wish to be resolved about, with all the speed imaginable. I beg you will tell me; it will do us both good. It is a mournful thing to sit solitary even in joys: how much more when our lot is deeply tinged with woes and difficulties and distresses which often render life a very sorry piece of business. Be assured, my old friend, this case can never be yours while I live, and retain my right judgement about me. Few scenes of my life are more innocently pleasing than those I have passed with you; and the world abounds not so plentifully with deserving people, that I should forget the earliest, almost the only early friend I have. Oh! Why cannot I cut out eight years from the past and return to <date when="1815-00-00">A.D. 1815</date>! We were so cheery then, so busy, so strong of heart and full of hope!&#x2014; You observe I am verging to the Lake School in sentiment? I will leave it then.</p>
<p>My journey to Annandale, and stay there, offered nothing in the least surprising. It rained <hi rend="italic">every</hi> day while I was at home; so I could stir nowhither from Mainhill. My only excursions were two to Annan, in the last of which I returned by Ruthwell.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Home of the Rev. Henry Duncan, a friend of both Johnston and Carlyle.</note> The fashion of this world passeth away! All seemed changed at Ruthwell; Mitchell<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Mitchell.</note> was not there; Mrs D. was absent; his reverence and myself were the the only interlocutors; and before we got over the threshold of our conversation, it was time for me to rise and ride. I was twice at Bogside,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Home of the Johnstons.</note> and had many kind inquiries to answer about you, there as well as elsewhere. They wanted to know if you were coming; if you were going; if &#x26;c &#x26;c<supplied>[.]</supplied> Did you get the letter left for you at the post-office of Dunkeld? I forgot to leave it at Perth. You should write to them without loss of time.</p>
<p>On returning hither I brought out an <hi rend="italic">elegant</hi> grey pony with me, <pb id="pg-02-437" n="02:437"/>intending to drive indigestion out of me by dint of riding on it. While at home, I recovered very fast. On the road I was annoyed to the verge of death, by blackguards and whiteguards, noises, slutteries and all kinds of devilry. Here I am not improving, let me ride as I will. If Sathan would be kind enough to carry all the <hi rend="italic">billusness</hi> of this planet down with him to Tophet, and keep it there for the use of his boarders, it would be a great improvement in this best of all possible worlds. Patience! Patience! that is the eternal song. I wish only that Disease were a <hi rend="italic">living thing</hi>, with a tangible carcass, tho&#x2019; hideous as the Hyrcanian tiger,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Macbeth</hi>, III, iv.</note> that I might grapple with it face to face, and trample it and tread it into atoms, and cast it on the waters and make all the people drink of them!!!</p>
<p>In the meantime I am busily engaged every night in translating Goethe&#x2019;s Wilhelm Meister; a task which I have undertaken formally and must proceed with, tho&#x2019; it suits me little. There is poetry in the book, and prose, prose forever. When I read of players and libidinous actresses and their sorry pasteboard apparatus for beautifying and enlivening the &#x201C;moral world,&#x201D; I render it into grammatical English&#x2014; with a feeling mild and charitable as that of a starving hyaena. The Book is to be printed in winter or spring. No mortal will ever buy a copy of it. <foreign><hi rend="italic">N&#x2019;importe</hi></foreign> [No matter]! I have engaged with it to keep the fiend from preying on my v<supplied>[itals,]</supplied> and <supplied>[with th]</supplied>at sole view I go along with it. Goethe is the gre<supplied>[atest ge]</supplied>niu<supplied>[s that has]</supplied> lived for a century, and the greatest ass that <supplied>[has l]</supplied>ived for th<supplied>[ree. I]</supplied> could sometimes fall down and worship him; at other times I could kick him out of the room.</p>
<p>If you have heard no news lately from the south, it will be fresh intelligence for you that Lawson<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Andrew Lawson.

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>As I have not been slack in afflicting you with my ill news, when I had aught to complain of, I ought still less to be slack in cheering you with good intelligence, when such comes in course. I know you will rejoice to learn that I am considerably, very considerably better within the last four or five days; and likely by the use of proper precautions to continue in a very tolerable and gradually improving state. The secret of this change lies in the better supply of sleep I have enjoyed; which result I attribute to the total discontinuance of tea in the evenings. I have stuck to porridge, and design to stick to them. <hi rend="italic">They</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In now obsolescent Scots, <hi rend="italic">porridge</hi>, like <hi rend="italic">broth</hi>, was referred to by plural pronouns.</note> are ceasing even to make me sick or very dull when I swallow them: and oh! what a deliverance it is to lie down on my bed, and find it in truth a place of rest, and not a place of torment more annoying than I need to speak of or care to think of. I ride every day, and walk a great deal; and by these means I get along very decently. I think I am even fully better than when I was at home.</p>
<p>Of late days I have often thought it was cruel in me to afflict you with tidings of evil which you could not help, and could only vex yourself by vain regrets and sorrow for. But there is one advantage attending the practice, which you may now reap the advantage of: I deserve implicit credit when I tell you that I am better; and so long as you do not <hi rend="italic">hear</hi> that I am worse, you may safely conclude that I <hi rend="italic">am</hi> not worse. Oh! it is a sad thing for a great lubber like me, at an age when I should be sweetening the declining years of my parents, to plague them with pitying and caring for me. I believe the case, however, <hi rend="italic">will</hi> alter: and if it should not, this good at least among its thousand evils I have derived from it, I have tasted their affection, the affection of all belonging <supplied>[to]</supplied> me with a heart-moving delight <pb id="pg-02-439" n="02:439"/>which but for this affliction I could never have experienced. There are moments when I could almost be in love with suffering and sorrow: it is so touching and ennobling to see the best sentiments of the soul, love and true-heartedness that might befit a better world struggling thro&#x2019; all the mean obstructions and degrading perplexities of which we have had our share on Earth. My dear Mother! It is one of my most crying wishes that I could make you happy! I trust God will spare us both to see better times, and do him service in the land of the living; or if this is too much to look for, that we shall find each other in some brighter country, beyond death and pain and all the sore trials flesh is heir to.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18201019-TC-WG-01">TC to WG, <date when="1820-10-19">19 Oct. 1820</date></ref>.</note> I am getting too serious: but these things often come across me so that I could sit down and cry little [like] a little child over all that has been and is yet to be.</p>
<p>For the last two days I have been Lord of the Manor here myself, and totally alone. The &#x201C;Oxford Scholars&#x201D; are all gone back to Oxford, or whither their stars commanded them; the old people are in Fife visiting some Nabob of their acquaintance; and the two youths have been since Friday at a place called Fascal<supplied>[l]</supplied>y entertaining themselves with one Butter (a savoury gentleman!) the minor <foreign>Laird</foreign> of it.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Faskally, an estate with a mansion in Moulin parish, Perthshire, was owned by Archibald Butter.</note> I kept very busy at my work; going out to ride at one o&#x2019;clock, and walking at intervals when I tired of writing, on the whole I have been happy enough. The boys have just now driven past my window in their gig: the elders are not to return till Saturday. We are a most fluctuating people we of Kinnaird. At the beginning of Autumn, it was settled that the juniors of us should go to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> in winter, the others remaining here; after which the one youth was to go to Germany, the other to Oxford, and I to take my leave I supposed forever and a day. It now appears that we are not to go to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, that Arthur need not go to Germany unless perfectly convenient, and that Charlie is learning far better with me than he would have any chance to do at &#x201C;southern seat of the muses.&#x201D; So they have formally asked me, if I am willing to accompany them in spring down into Cornwall, where they mean to settle till their sons are educated! I said that but on the score of health I had no manner of objection. This they professed their extreme readiness to do all in their power towards remedying. It appears probable therefore that after Whitsunday I may take a farther jaunt to the southward. One thing I am determined on: to have my <hi rend="italic">own house</hi> if I go thither. I mean to take lodgings if any are <pb id="pg-02-440" n="02:440"/>to be had near&#x2014;if not I will almost venture to furnish <hi rend="italic">the</hi> Cottage I have been speaking of so often. For a man of my habits and health, it is very sweet to sit by his own hearth&#x2014;or some friend&#x2019;s which he may call his own. I bullyrag these careless wretches without stint, when they neglect me; but still it is an irksome thing. Our Lady has a thousand gifts&#x2014;but not that of housekeeping. If I did not manage better myself, I would throw up all claims to judge of management ever after. She scolds all the servants pretty regularly once in fourteen days; and that is her chief duty.</p>
<p>Thus I am to spend the winter among the highland hills. I shall finish my translation (with which I go on as regularly as clock-work) about <date when="1824-02-00">February</date> or so; in <date when="1824-03-00">March</date> or <date when="1824-04-00">April</date> I must solicit leave of absence for a couple of months, to get it printed in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>; then I shall come galloping down to see you all for three or four weeks; and then dispose of myself according to circumstances&#x2014;stay in Annandale, or go to Cornwall, or do any other thing which may promise best. Thus matters look well enough. I am not very much delighted at the thought of passing the winter here; it will be very cold, and very lonely: but yet when I reflect upon all the torments of last winter in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, and compare my quiet most quiet chamber and careless way of living with the <hi rend="italic">Manties</hi> and Wilkies <foreign>menage</foreign>, I feel quite delighted with the contrast. I <hi rend="italic">expect</hi> (still expecting!) to get very much healthier in spring; and for want of company, I shall stick close as glue to my translations and care little about that. In Cornwall in my <hi rend="italic">own</hi> chamber&#x2014;I think what writing of books and toiling and bidding defiance to all the ear<supplied>[th]</supplied> I shall have! Their place stands by the seashore; they have the finest downs to ri<supplied>[de]</supplied> on: I shall completely recover.</p>
<p>To-day, there came no paper; an omission which in this your most busy season I can very easily excuse. I spent the day in reading part of Irving&#x2019;s sermon&#x2019;s, which I have not finished. On the whole he should not have published it&#x2014;till after a considerable time. <note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Irving&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">For the Oracles of God, Four Orations</hi>, etc. See <ref target="volume-02/lt-18230424-TC-WG-01">TC to WG, <date when="1823-04-24">24 April</date></ref>.</note> There is strong talent in it, true eloquence, and vigorous thought: but the foundation is rotten, and the building itself is a kind of monster in architecture&#x2014;beautiful in parts&#x2014;vast in dimensions&#x2014;but on the whole decidedly a monster. Buller has stuck in the middle of it&#x2014;&#x201C;can&#x2019;t fall in with your friend at all Mr C.&#x201D;&#x2014; Mrs B. is very near sticking. Sometimes I burst right out o&#x2019; laughing, when reading it; at other times I admired it sincerely. Irving himself I expect to see ere long, tho&#x2019; at present I <pb id="pg-02-441" n="02:441"/>suspect I am a little in disfavour with him. On arriving here I found a letter from him,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dated <date when="1823-08-16">16 Aug.</date></note> written (as I found only a little while ago) just two days after the date of mine; to which at first I took it for an answer. On this hypothesis, the thing had rather a cold look; there was very little in it, and that little taken up with assurances to his &#x201C;Scottish friends&#x201D; that he <hi rend="italic">had</hi> not forgot them, the whole carrying an air of <hi rend="italic">protection</hi> with it, which rather amused me. So one day when very <foreign>bilious</foreign> I wrote a reply of a rather <hi rend="italic">bilious</hi> character, giving him to know by various indirect and pleasant methods that to certain of his &#x201C;Scottish friends,&#x201D; his forgetting or remembrance was not a thing that would kill or keep alive. I also told him my <hi rend="italic">true</hi> opinion of his Book&#x2014;a favourable one; but some thousand degrees below his own. We have had no farther communication. I love Irving, and am his debtor for many kind feelings and acts. He is one of the best men breathing: but I will not give his vanity one inch of swing in my company; he may get the fashionable women and the multitude of young men whom no one knoweth to praise and flatter&#x2014;not I one iota beyond his genuine merits.</p>
<p>Here is the post come; and I must finish without loss of a moment. Tell Jack to write to me&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">immediately</hi>&#x2014;and very largely. Bid him keep to his studies, and have no anxiety about the means or the end. I will see him in <date when="1824-02-00">February</date> for two months; very likely sooner for a few days. He will have the press to mind for me in some things during winter.&#x2014; Give my best love to My Father, to Alick and all the rest in order. Bid them tell me fully about the harvest. There is never a wet morning but I think of you at Mainhill. Take care of yourself my dear Mother! Bid them tell me fully and truly about your health&#x2014;remember this. If you want <hi rend="italic">any</hi> thing that I can get&#x2014;you know how it is. Good night!</p>
<p><closer><salute>I am always your aff<hi rend="italic">e</hi> son, /</salute></closer> <name>Th: Carlyle</name></p>
<ps><p>Alas! Alas! the Post is gone: and here must this lie for two days&#x2014;unless I burn it, and write you another. At any rate, I have had my <hi rend="italic">talk</hi> with you&#x2014;and am far the better for it. Again Good night! I am for Irving.</p>
<p>Are the little ones at school, or going to it? I often think with regret that they get not more opportunity of learning. Thousands of parents would give the world for children of such capacity. Tell my <pb id="pg-02-442" n="02:442"/>father that I hope they will be allowed to go in winter. My love to them!</p>
<p>The harvest I fear must be very untoward with you. The people here are in the middle of it. We have white-rime every night; often rain; and it is always very cold. I heap on sticks and (wet) peats; but in winter I think all will be required.</p>
<p>I have not heard a syllable of word from Johnston: indeed I wrote to him for the first time, only about a week ago. Tell Jack to send me a full account of his studies and feelings&#x2014; Alick of his traffic and dealings. They <hi rend="italic">must</hi> not neglect to write.</p>
<p>Tuesday&#x2014;30<hi rend="italic">th</hi>&#x2014;Evening.&#x2014;Having had no opportunity, the letter is still here. There is no alteration&#x2014;none at least for the worse since I finished writing. The paper I expected to-day, and perhaps a letter, but got neither. I am not very anxious but I trust Jack or some of them will write to me the <hi rend="italic">very day</hi> you get this at farthest. It matters not what they say, so they say any thing. When will <hi rend="italic">you</hi> write?</p></ps>

<salute>My dearest Friend</salute>
<p>First a furious pain in my head that laid me up for a week, and then incessant and unavoidable occupation, of no pleasant nature, have kept me from writing to you all this time&#x2014; I beseech you never suspect me of being unmindful of you&#x2014;never unless you know for certain, that I am either deranged or dead&#x2014; Tho&#x2019; you may sometimes be at a loss to conjecture the cause of my silence, you may always be assured it is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> want of will&#x2014; Your idea is inseparable from my thoughts whatever they think on&#x2014;were it torn away from my mind my whole existence would be laid waste&#x2014;but I am not my own Mistress and am often constrained to devote my time to employments from which my heart is far away&#x2014; Oh I do love you my own Brother! I even wish that Fate had designed me for your Wife; for I feel that such a destiny would have been happier than mine is like to be&#x2014; But Fate is every whit as capricious as Fortune; if it is not the selfsame Deity, and rarely unites those whom nature meant to be united&#x2014; And so you will cease to correspond with me when I marry! and you think I will ever marry at such a cost? Where is the Lover on the face of this <pb id="pg-02-443" n="02:443"/>earth that could console me for the loss of my Friend? We <hi rend="italic">shall not</hi> cease to correspond! never never as far as it depends on me&#x2014; If &#x201C;M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi>&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x201D; is to be estranged from your affections I am Jane Welsh for life&#x2014;</p>
<p>Are you better? Do tell me particularly how you are. What can Providence mean in bestowing health on so many millions that waste it in idleness or worse than idleness; and yet withholding it from you who would turn the blessing to such glorious account? perhaps to display your character in the most dignified point of view in which it could possibly be placed; for when does a noble mind appear more noble than when fighting with and gaining victories over Fate? Oh be careful of yourself! for the worlds sake and for mine&#x2014; Were I again to lose the friend of my soul,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >As she had once before upon the death of her father.</note> again to be left alone in the midst of society&#x2014;loving no one and yet possessing the faculty to love&#x2014;perceiving nothing but the blackness of death in the universe around me&#x2014;in the bustle and glitter and grandeur of the earth, nothing but the parade of a Funeral, Great God how wretched how ruined I should be! but you shall live, to be my guardian-angel&#x2014;it cannot be the will of a merciful God that I should return to the dreary existence which I endured before we met&#x2014;it cannot be his will that a soul born to enlighten the earth, to be the daystar of ages, should be obscured by the shadows of death ere a world has perceived its splendour. You shall live to love me while I live, and to mourn for me when I die &#x26; the thought that I shall be mourned by a heart so warm and true will overcome the terrors of death<supplied>[.]</supplied> I wish you were settled in your hermitage and I with you<supplied>[;]</supplied> you would be well in a months time; and then such books we should write! Oh etiquette etiquette! what a paradise of a world this might be if that accursed thing were banished!</p>
<p>I have just been interrupted by one of the most curious little gentlemen I ever set my eyes on&#x2014; An Asiatic traveller, who is exploring the face of the earth &#x201C;in quest of happiness&#x201D; with a tremendous gold chain like a Lord Provost&#x2019;s round his neck and a magnificent rose-diamond on his second finger&#x2014; He came to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> some weeks ago with a great stock of impudence and introductory letters, and has contrived to get himself noticed by all the literary people the place affords from the Blues up to Sir Walter Scot<supplied>[t]</supplied>&#x2014; He was sent out to me, on a horse, by a very beautiful very silly woman, a sister of Ghrame the Poets,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably James Grahame (<date when="1765-00-00">1765</date>&#x2013;<date when="1811-00-00">1811</date>), a Scottish poet who was satirized by Byron.</note> but for what purpose, I cannot divine&#x2014;unless <pb id="pg-02-444" n="02:444"/>it were to observe the difference between a Town-Blue and a country one&#x2014; If that was his errand he must have been gr<supplied>[eatly]</supplied> disappointed for I have played the idiot in such style that I am sure he is away in the belief that I am not at all dipped<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jane means that she has not been dipped in the color blue and dyed with it: she is not a bluestocking.</note>&#x2014; I sewed most industriously all the while he was here&#x2014;lost my scissors and needle in the midst of his finest descriptions&#x2014;railed at Learned Ladies all and sundry&#x2014;answered continually No to all his questions about reading and completed his dismay by declaring that no new publications ever got to Haddington and that having no time for reading I never thought of sending for any&#x2014; Poor little pug faced Turk (or whatever he is) it has not been here that he was destined to fall in with happiness&#x2014; I have really used him shamefully ill; but it was so senseless to send an outlandish creature here that no one knows any thing about except that he is a friend of Maturin and M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Shell<supplied>[e]</supplied>y and visits at Keswick and Abbots Ford&#x2014; Devil take him he has occupied far too much of my paper<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Carne (<date when="1789-00-00">1789</date>&#x2013;<date when="1844-00-00">1844</date>; <ref target="volume-02/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/4714"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), author and traveler, he called on several other personalities in Scotland about this time. See A. L. Stewart, <hi rend="italic">Life and Letters of James Hogg</hi> (Lubbock, Tex., <date when="1946-00-00">1946</date>), 1:252&#x2013;53; Joseph Carne Ross, ed. <hi rend="italic">John Carne: Letters, <date when="1813-00-00">1813</date>&#x2013;<date when="1837-00-00">1837</date></hi> (<date when="1885-00-00">1885</date>); and John Carne, <hi rend="italic">Letters from the East</hi> (<date when="1826-00-00">1826</date>). Since Jane suggests Carne&#x2019;s association with Abbotsford and Sir Walter Scott, it may be interesting to compare her description with J. G. Lockhart&#x2019;s account of the exotic Scottish painter William Allan (<date when="1782-00-00">1782</date>&#x2013;<date when="1850-00-00">1850</date>), who was living in Edinburgh when Lockhart visited him several years before Jane wrote her letter: <p>&#x201C;We had no great distance to walk, for Mr Allan lives in the Parliament-Close, not a gun-shot from where we were.</p> <p>&#x201C;After climbing several flights of a stair-case, we were ushered into the house of the painter; and Mr Bridges, being quite at home, conducted us straight into his painting-room&#x2014;the most picturesque painting-room, I fancy, in Europe. Mr Allan returned about two years ago to Edinburgh (the place of his birth) from a residence of many years in various regions of the East, and his apartment is decorated in a most splendid manner with the trophies of his wanderings. The wainscot is completely covered with rich clusters of military accoutrements, Turkish scimitars, Circassian bows and quivers, hauberks of twisted mail from Caucasus, daggers, dirks, javelins, and all manner of long unwieldy fowling-pieces,&#x2014;Georgian, Armenian, and Tartar. &#x2026; The exterior of the artist himself harmonized a good deal with his furniture. &#x2026; A swarthy complexion, and a profusion of black hair, tufted into a wild, though not ungraceful manner, together with a pair of large sparkling eyes, looking out from under strong shaggy brows, full of vivacious and ardent expressiveness,&#x2014;were scarcely less speaking witnesses of the life of roaming and romantic adventure, which, I was told, this fine artist had led.&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Peter&#x2019;s Letters to His Kinsfolk</hi> (Edinburgh and London, <date when="1819-00-00">1819</date>), II, 233&#x2013;35, with an engraving of Allan opp. p. 234. Allan visited Abbotsford and painted Scott&#x2019;s picture, and on one occasion Scott spoke of him as &#x201C;a wonderful little fellow.&#x201D; He returned to Edinburgh from his Asiatic travels in <date when="1814-00-00">1814</date>.

<salute>My dear Jane,</salute>
<p>Had you seen me last Tuesday, it would have paid you for the trouble of writing that delightful letter to me, and almost made you vow to write more liberally than ever. Your letters are always &#x201C;like dew on the mown grass&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. &#x201C;like dew on thirsty grass,&#x201D; Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi>, p. 141; &#x201C;like rain on mown grass,&#x201D; Ps. 72:6.</note> to my heart; and the last was doubly welcome. The former one had cast such a cloud over me, and given rise to so many unpleasant speculations, that I waited with extreme anxiety to hear from you again. Often, often did I watch the &#x201C;ship of the Desart,&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The camel or dromedary. Cf. Byron, <hi rend="italic">The Island</hi>, II, viii, 183 and note.</note> our old gray postman, mooring upon the lawn every alternate day, yet bringing not a word of tidings from Jane. But I held myself in patience; and patience had at length its rich reward. No! My Dearest, I do not think you will forget me; I were very miserable if I thought so. Oh let us never dream about forgetting; it would be little less than impious to renounce this heavenly feeling that unites us. Has not a kind Providence created us for one another? Have we not found each other? And might not both of us go round the planet seeking vainly for a heart we could love so well? It appears to me that I have found in you what all enthusiasts long for, another and a nobler self: on looking at your character I seem to behold the image of my own, beautified in all its lineaments, exalted, transfigured, <pb id="pg-02-446" n="02:446"/>invested with a thousand charms; the <hi rend="italic">ideal beauty</hi> of my mind, which I could almost worship, if I had not dared to love it. Let us never mind the caprices of Fortune; the future may take its course: our souls are linked together by the holiest ties; and what on Earth shall part us? For myself, I am determined, whatever it may lead to, that I will love you more and more every day I live. What else can I do? This affection which I bear you is the most precious feeling of my nature, it enlivens and inflames all that is worthiest in my soul; it gilds my horizon with visions of hope more glorious than belong to this lower world. The idea of Jane, <hi rend="italic">my</hi> noble Jane, illuminates and cheers the desolation of my thoughts as with the light of a summer&#x2019;s dawn; without you all were bleak and sullen and desperate even now, and with you I feel as I could stand against innumerable enemies. No! My darling, we will never part! I trust we shall live to be the highest of earthly blessings to each other; and be happy, in spite of all obstructions, for many glorious years. God grant it, or teach us to exist without it!</p>
<p>Your delay in writing has been but too well accounted for. I noticed your Grandfather&#x2019;s death in the Papers; and anticipated all that you would feel. There is a strange mellowing influence in the mandate of that last gloomy Messenger who &#x201C;changeth our countenance and sendeth us away.&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Job 14:20.</note> The harshest and sternest spirit appears with an imploring and tender look to our reflections when it has yielded to the stroke of death. Unkind feelings are forgotten, faults are cast into the shade, and love alone sicklied over with the pale cast of thought<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi>, III, i.</note> hovers round the tombs of our friends. The idea that all my deformities shall be hid beneath the grass that covers me, and I shall live like a stainless being in the hearts of those that loved me, often of itself almost reconciles me to the inexorable law of Fate. With the hope of meeting in a brighter scene of existence, I look on Death as the most inestimable privilege of man. O God! if we are <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to meet there, if those that have gone from us are but a mockery and lost in everlasting nothingness,&#x2014;wherefore hast Thou created us at all?</p>
<p>Had I known that you were sick, I had been wretched with a witness. How is it, my dearest Jane? Have you been sitting too closely at your books, and must I vex you by my prayers and entreaties again? I do conjure you to beware of excess in the article of study: a black experience gives me fearful right to do so. For my sake, if not for your <pb id="pg-02-447" n="02:447"/>own, be counselled in this matter. If you lose that priceless treasure of health, what will become of us both? I will never cease to plague you till you promise to pass three or four hours every day in mere recreation&#x2014;two of them in the open air.</p>
<p>You are very good to feel so anxious about my sickness. I think I might find some better topic to entertain you with; yet it were unfriendly altogether to abstain from mentioning this most paltry one, in which my general happiness is so awfully involved. Do not vex yourself, my beloved Jane, with fears about my dying. Of this there is not the slightest danger. No one ever dies of such disorders; the real object of dread is that of dwindling by degrees into a pitiful whining vale<supplied>[tu]</supplied>dinarian, which is far worse than death. There is not in nature so poor a class of persons as the valetudinarians: they cannot live, without continual annoyance to themselves and others; and have not heart enough to take a dose of arsenic, and so conclude their syllabubs and pills and boluses and candles by one efficient drug. What a charming thing it would be to see me enrolled among that worthy body! But be of better hope: I am neither going to die, nor be laid upon the shelf in that mean manner. I am far better, since I wrote to you: I expect to keep improving till quite recovered. Neither you nor I must leave the world <hi rend="italic">yet</hi>: we have many thousand things to do, and to enjoy; our history is scarce begun. Do not fear, my best Jane, that I will neglect any precaution. The punishment indeed which follows close upon the smallest omission is your abundant security. I grieve to be obliged to spend so much thought and time, in studying for health, and riding, and regulating all my movements: but it is a necessary tax, sternly enforced, and I pay it punctually. What boots it to complain? I have sworn to conquer this wretched impediment too: address, dexterity and stubborn patience are the weapons I must fight it with; I have daily better hopes of coming off victorious. Oh! if it were but so; if you once saw me triumphant over all these miserable evils! If we were both hastening forward in that noblest career to which we are devoted; both, hand in hand, approaching that resplendent goal where all our wishes lie! Fear nothing, my heroic Jane; it <hi rend="italic">shall</hi> yet be so; you shall yet be numbered among the ornaments of your sex and country, and I the happiest of all preceptors shall say proudly, she was <hi rend="italic">my</hi> pupil, and it was thus I prophecied. Diligence I have told you a thousand times, will accomplish every thing you aim at; and with that unquenchable ardour, for which I love you tho&#x2019; I often scold you for its excess, I hold it to be impossible that you <pb id="pg-02-448" n="02:448"/>should relax in diligence. Blame not Nature, for making you ambitious: praise her rather for fixing your ambition on the worthiest of objects, and giving you strength to contemn the shallow prizes for which others in your state are striving. Ambition is a sourc<supplied>[e of]</supplied> endless disquietude; but it is the parent of great and glorious actions: I declare I have often no hope of escaping the Beotian existence into which increasing years and hard fortune force many an honest and once ardent man&#x2014;except that there is a fund of bitterness and unrest within my heart, which would not let me sleep two days upon the softest bed which all the pomp and luxury of earth could spread for me. So likewise is it with you! I know you are unhappy, except when earnestly endeavouring in the great cause: and strange as it may seem I wish you to be unhappy in those cases; I should love you less, if you were less exalted in your tastes, less exclusively bent on the glorious things which will yet be your immortal crown. Go on, then, my Princess! Rest not, tire not! Your name shall yet be great upon the earth; and what is far more to the purpose, the aim of your existence will have been fulfilled.</p>
<p>Yet I confess it is a sorry task I have set you. I should not be in the least disposed to scold you, tho&#x2019; I learned that you were sick of that Mus&#xE4;us. Translating is a weary business; the turning of a sentence gives no scope to the better faculties of the mind: it helps to still the conscience and that is all. Nevertheless you must proceed. Despise not these small beginnings; there was a time when Milton did not know his alphabet, and Rome was once a hamlet. Do tell me all about your difficulties, and your progress. Four pages a-day seem a very fair allowance; in time you will do more. The only cause for greater speed is the time of going to the Press. The Bullers wish me to go with them in <date when="1824-05-00">May</date> down to Cornwall; it seems likely enough that I may do so. Oh! What multitudes of gloomy thoughts&#x2014;forebodings and forecastings I have had. Provoking Enemy! You wish you were with me in the hermitage! Would you go? Not you&#x2014;one foot&#x2019;s length, tho&#x2019; it were to the happy valley of Prince Rasselas. But tho&#x2019; I went to the North Pole, you should not have leave to cast me from your thoughts. Jane&#x2019;s heart is my heaven of heavens; it is the refuge and resting-place of my soul, I will abide there forever and ever.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >This sentence is omitted in <hi rend="italic">LL</hi>.</note> Judge if I long to see you, amid these perplexities. I was within an inch of bolting off to Haddington last Friday, when they all set out to see Loch Ketterin [Katrine], and could prevail on me to go no farther than Loch Tay. <pb id="pg-02-449" n="02:449"/>I absolutely cannot live thus estranged from you. Do contrive, if you love me, to let me behold your face, when I come next to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>. I must be down for a few days in <date when="1823-11-00">November</date>, perhaps also at Christmas: I pray you for Heaven&#x2019;s sake to be visible&#x2014;to have all things smoothed, and to meet me in your own bewitching way. You are an angel of light, and will have mercy on me; you are also very cunning, and can effect any thing you like. <hi rend="italic">Meister</hi> is to be printed between <date when="1824-03-00">March</date> and <date when="1824-05-00">May</date>, when I must be beside you again. I will come gallopping out to Haddington every other day, and talk with you, and plague you till your very heart is sore. Will <hi rend="italic">Mus&#xE4;us</hi> be ready then? Will you have Lybussa done, when I see you in <date when="1824-11-00">November</date>? Oh that I were beside you this moment&#x2014;you should see, you wicked creature, if you could cheat me as you did that poor unfortunate &#x201C;pug-faced Turk&#x201D; that came to you <hi rend="italic">in search of happiness</hi>.&#x2014; Now tell me about every thing that comes into your head, or in the very slightest concerns you; and tell me the first spare instant. I cannot exist without your letters&#x2014;at least I do not think I can. Write also without the smallest care; nonsense from <hi rend="italic">you</hi> is the best of all. Do I not set you an example? Tell me how your studies are arranged, if you read any thing, if you feel contented and keep diligent&#x2014;all, all I wish to know. Did you ever read so tedious a letter? I am done at last. God bless you my own darling!</p>
<p><closer><salute>I am yours forever /</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle.</name></p>
<ps><p><hi rend="italic">Meister</hi> was going on like steam-machinery, when a letter from the Editor of the London Magazine<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >From John Taylor, <date when="1823-09-29">29 Sept.</date></note> put a stop to it in a day. He has actually printed that meanest life of Schiller, and expects the other parts without delay. I have idled for a week, as is my custom, when changing employment. I expect to have the business done when we meet. It can scarcely be worse than the first portion, which I have just now read with a most &#x201C;vinegar aspect.&#x201D;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">The Merchant of Venice</hi>, I, i.</note> It is generally <hi rend="italic">very</hi> bad&#x2014;the best is barely tolerable.</p>

On <date when="1823-10-14">Tuesday, 14 Oct.</date>, he married Isabella, daughter of the Rev. John Martin of Kirkcaldy.

Tell me, tell me, about him and it, next time. To-morrow unless the day is bad, I am going out to meet him at Dundee or Perth, on Wednesday after he is married. His book is a gigantic monster!</p>
<p>Now will you write <hi rend="italic">very</hi> soon? I know you will. At the same time <pb id="pg-02-450" n="02:450"/>heed not my importunities for I am never satisfied, or satisfiable. To-morrow, I am at Dundee, then with Irving for a day, and home the next. I am very idle: be merciful, and I promise to labour like a negro, <foreign>Adieu</foreign>, Jane! I <hi rend="italic">must</hi> off.</p></ps>

<salute>Dearest Friend</salute>
<p>I am almost out of my wits with joy&#x2014; I think, in my life, I was never so glad before&#x2014; Such a future is before us! I cannot wait for your letter any longer&#x2014;my happiness is incomplete while you do not partake it&#x2014;&#x2014; You and I are going to London! You and I! We are to live a whole summer beside each other, and beside the One whom next to each other we love most<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edward Irving.</note>&#x2014; We are to see such magnificence of Art as we have never seen, and to get acquaint<supplied>[ed]</supplied> with such excellence of Man and Woman as we have never known&#x2014;in short, we are to lead, for three months, the happiest, happiest life that my imagination hath ever conceived&#x2014;&#x2014; In the same house for months! together in our occupations, together in our amusements, always together! no duties to interfere with the duty of loving eachother, no pitiful restraints to vex our happy intercourse&#x2014;delightful prospect! Oh that it may not fade from us ere we reach it!</p>
<p>Surely the Almighty&#x2019;s self hath put this plan into the heart of our Friend&#x2014;surely it is not designed that it shall miscarry&#x2014; Our Friend is determined that you shall come, and my Mother is willing that I shall go&#x2014;and she is not to be left alone&#x2014;she designs to pass the next summer where she passed the last, and where she is quite independent of my company&#x2014; I foresee no cause why it should fail with me&#x2014;and I <supplied>[am]</supplied> almost sure it will not fail with you&#x2014; You will go, if for no other reason, because your own Jane desires it&#x2014; Will you not? Need I doubt it? I know you love me&#x2014;I know the noblest heart in Britain loves me&#x2014;</p>
<p>How comes it that I have such a Friend as you? that I deceive you without seeking to deceive you? I am so different from my idea in your mind! stript of the veil of poetry which your imagination spreads around me I am so undeserving of your love! But I <hi rend="italic">shall</hi> deserve it&#x2014; <pb id="pg-02-451" n="02:451"/><hi rend="italic">shall</hi> be a noble woman, if efforts of mine can make me so&#x2014; This summer in London will make a new creature of me&#x2014; I shall set myself, with my whole soul, to perfect my life and character through the counsel and example of my two friends&#x2014; I shall be happy, and the happy are always disposed to be good&#x2014;Are they not?&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>
<p>I did injustice to Edward Irving in supposing he had forgotten us&#x2014; He loves us still&#x2014;better than many hundreds of his other friends&#x2014; If you can bear with <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;the Lord&#x201D;</hi> and M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Montague<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mrs. Basil Montagu, of 25 Bedford Square, London, who had become Irving&#x2019;s friend and who was often mentioned enthusiastically in his talk. Basil Montagu (<date when="1770-00-00">1770</date>&#x2013;<date when="1851-00-00">1851</date>), was the natural son of John Montagu, fourth Earl of Sandwich. He had been married twice before he married the widow of Thomas Skepper, lawyer, of York. She had been born Anna Dorothea Benson. In her youth she had known Burns and is mentioned in his correspondence. A passage in her letter to Jane Welsh of <date when="1825-07-03">3 July 1825</date> suggests that her first marriage took place very early and was unhappy. After warning Jane against being like many other women who have lost their liberty through marriage, she adds that such had been her own sad fate &#x201C;when in compliance with a rash promise, I took leave of tranquility&#x2014;a promise made with the judgment of 15, and in the irrational fear that my refusal would produce an act of suicide!&#x201D; By Skepper she had one daughter, Anne Benson (b. <date when="1799-09-11">11 Sept. 1799</date>), who married Bryan Waller Procter, the poet &#x201C;Barry Cornwall,&#x201D; in <date when="1824-00-00">1824</date>. After the death of Montagu&#x2019;s second wife she came as a widow to be governess of his children and in <date when="1808-00-00">1808</date> married him. By him she had two sons and a daughter. She is the &#x201C;Mrs. Montagu&#x201D; of Irving&#x2019;s life, the Carlyle letters, and various other biographies such as those of Coleridge and Wordsworth.</note> you will have great delight in his visit&#x2014; Shall I like his Wife?&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>
<p>Here is your letter come! I had given up hope of having it today&#x2014; Oh there is something in these letters of yours so delightful, so overwhelming ! Do you know I cannot read them without &#x201C;tearing&#x201D; (as My Aunt M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Robert calls it) and it is not slight emotion that can make me weep&#x2014; Cornwall! will you go to Cornwall? and just in <date when="1823-05-00">May</date>!

<salute>My dear Jack,</salute>
<p>Upon this last surviving sheet of large paper, I sit down to write the last letter you are likely to receive from me for some time at Mainhill. I would have written sooner; for your late epistle, like all of them pleased me and comforted me, and the task of replying to it was at once a duty and a pleasure; but ever since it came to hand I have scarcely been two days together in the same place; and this evening tho&#x2019; a late <supplied>[hour]</supplied> is the very earliest opportunity I could find for so pleasing an employment. You are a good fellow, Jack, with all your drawbacks; it is no small consolation for me, both in regard to the present and the future, that I have you for a Brother.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle is replying to a passage in kind from John&#x2019;s letter to him of <date when="1823-10-07">7 Oct.</date>: &#x201C;I can scarcely say how it is, but your letters have always something in them which, though I cannot well define it, never fails to cheer and animate me. I know not how to flatter, but there is not one whom I would rather call brother than yourself; and it shall be the chief aim of my life to make myself worthy of you.&#x201D;</note> Nothing strengthens the other ties of friendship so permanently and binds them so closely as the tie of blood; a brother, when one respects his character and could love it for its own sake, is a treasure which money cannot purchase, which nature gives and every true man would reckon among her dearest gifts. I have been a very woful genius for several years; darkened and distressed in spirit by continual pain and sorrows of various weighty kinds, my conduct in various relations has been most pitifully discharged; to you in particular, I have often been too harsh in words when my heart was true enough to your interests: yet I look forward with some hope into the future for days when both our hearts being more at ease, and our employments and situations more suitable to our wishes and deserts, our intercourse will become more warm and joyful in form without becoming less true in substance. As it is, depressed by many chagrins, in the midst of discomfort and much painful destitution, we are richer than thousands of flourishing persons in the world as the world estimates prosperity. We have glorious anticipations before us; and with the realizing of them or without it, we have both some tried friends to share either fortune with us. Let us never complain, then; but stick all true to one another, as I have said a thousand times, and dread nothing that can befal us.</p>
<p>In a few days you will be setting out for Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, well-grounded <pb id="pg-02-454" n="02:454"/>in <foreign><hi rend="italic">materia medica</hi></foreign> and other elementary branches of your profession, which this winter you will have leave to study under better auspices. I commit you, in the mean while, to your own direction without any fear, or any caution&#x2014;save that you do not pursue the business <hi rend="italic">over</hi> earnestly, and so incapacitate yourself for future and greater efforts. If your health be spared to you, I feel confident that you will outstrip every one of your competitors that I have any knowledge of. True honest perseverance, Jack, is the thing that makes a man, and nothing else can make him. Friends and patronage and so forth will do nothing without this; and with it, all these things may be dispensed with. You have a stout rugged judgement, a clear head and a true determined heart; there is no fear of you. As to the arrangements of your study and economy in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, as I have observed already, they must for the present campaign be left to your own discretion. In regard to the first, you will follow Medicine with rigorous fidelity as the future means of subsistence; and the spare time you have (for much will still remain) you can devote to general reading, the German and Latin and Greek languages, composition, perhaps attending &#x201C;the Logical,&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Logical Society in Edinburgh was founded in <date when="1793-00-00">1793</date> for &#x201C;the cultivation both of Law and general literature.&#x201D; In <date when="1794-00-00">1794</date> it had nineteen members, in <date when="1797-00-00">1797</date> it had se venteen. In <date when="1797-00-00">1797</date> it was amalgamated with the Juridical Society, and lost its identity as the resulting society was usually called the Juridical.</note> and above all to bodily and mental recreation. In regard to the second, I do not know whether you think of living with a companion or by yourself; tho&#x2019; I rather presume the latter will be your determination, as being perhaps more favourable for study, tho&#x2019; less comfortable in other respects. If not, perhaps Archy Little<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly a son or other relation of Dr. George Little (<ref target="volume-01/lt-18211117-TC-JCE-01">TC to <sic>JC</sic><corr>JCE</corr>, <date when="1821-11-17">17 Nov. 1821</date></ref>).</note> were he so minded would be a more suitable fellow-lodger for you than Duncan Church.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-02/lt-18221113-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1822-11-13">13 Nov. 1822</date></ref>.</note> You can think of this, and decide on your own authority&#x2014;just as you shall judge most pleasant for you, paying no regard to any considerations of expence and the like, for I should reckon it the meanest penury to injure one&#x2019;s comfort and progress for a whole winter out of reluctance to part with another pound note or two. On the same principle, I beg of you, and command you if that be necessary, to take up with no obscure uncleanly and unwholesome quarters, but to provide yourself with a comfortable a quiet and well-aired apartment, <hi rend="italic">whatever be the cost</hi>. I should think Salisbury street or some of these places might suit, if you are determined to be near the College: only investigate the landlady and the neighbourhood well before deciding. <pb id="pg-02-455" n="02:455"/>You can proceed to Mrs Robertson&#x2019;s 35. Bristo-street, the night you arrive, and she will accommodate you for the evening: but her rooms, I should fear, would be too noisy, tho&#x2019; she is the best landlady I ever had. She will give you a Quarterly Review which I left there. Lastly, Jack, you must take the dreadnought about you and travel in the Coach. This for certain. Walking is the most horrid undertaking in the world; it is not once to be thought of. If you have money enough to bring you out with, do not apply to Alick for any of his store; write to me, and I will send you a draught for plenty. You will need clothes, books &#x26;c &#x26;c<supplied>[.]</supplied> You will have to pay me fifty-fold yet; so of course I lend with all the willingness of a Hebrew usurer. Has James Johnstone written to you, inviting you to Broughty Ferry? It is a jaunt which you might very easily accomplish (after being settled in your room) during the Sacrament week.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A week of prayer and fasting held before the annual Communion. Contrast Burns&#x2019;s &#x201C;The Holy Fair,&#x201D; which shows what happens after the fasting, etc.</note> James will give you welcome with both hands. He is one of the kindest fellows, almost the very kindest in the way of hospitality I ever saw. There is nothing to hinder you from visiting the place; and if it gave you no trouble, I think it would do you good. He talks of taking you <supplied>[to]</supplied> Perth in a steamboat, and doing many other pleasant things. All this I can speak of from personal authority; for I staid from Monday night till Thursday morning last with Johnstone. I had gone thither to meet Edward Irving and his spouse, tho&#x2019; I did not effect this object till I returned to Dunkeld. Such ten days of galloping and wandering about! First the Bullers wished to take me with them to Loch Ketterin <supplied>[Katrine]</supplied>; but I hearing of Irving&#x2019;s movements would go no farther with them than Loch Tay, from which fine spot I returned on Saturday gone a week, amid the wettest weather I ever saw in my life. Poor Bardolph and I were wet to the bone: yet neither of us took any harm, and <hi rend="italic">we</hi> (like Curly and Jock) started again on Monday; lost our way among the stupid roads of Strathmore in Angus, could get no insight from the more stupid boors of the place, and did not reach the Targer&#x2019;s hospitable domicile till half past eight in the evening. I passed the foot of Dunsinan<supplied>[e]</supplied> and Macbeth&#x2019;s hill about nightfall, a few minutes after I had seen the great broad luminary as I looked over my shoulder setting behind the crescent-shaped peak of one of the far off Grampian Mountains. O<supplied>[n Thurs]</supplied>day I returned by a more convenient route, dined with a parson (one Irving from Galloway, whom I knew<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably Thomas Irvine of the parish of Lundie and Foulis Easter, to which he was inducted in <date when="1821-00-00">1821</date>. Irvine was born in Balmaghie, near Gatehouse of Fleet, in <date when="1794-00-00">1794</date> and educated at Edinburgh University. He eventually lost his sight and died in <date when="1874-00-00">1874</date>.</note>) in the <pb id="pg-02-456" n="02:456"/>moors of Angus; and at evening found the great Irving from Hattongarden, whom I also knew, sitting with his homely wife in Fishers inn at Dunkeld. The Bullers had returned that same day&#x2014;themselves and horses nearly dead with jading and fatigue: but I abode with Irving at his inn, taking up my horse on Friday morning, and returning back; till Saturday, when the whole three of us proceeded up the country in a chaise, called here at Kinnaird in the greatest style, went on to Loch Tay, and spent the night in Kenmore inn. After hearing sermon next day, they rolled me down six miles in their chaise to Aberfeldy, where I parted with them, and about two miles farther on fell in with the Postman leading up Bardolph to meet me, which I forthwith mounted, and so reached home by five o&#x2019;clock. Irvings wife is <hi rend="italic">dead ugly</hi>, otherwise a very decent serviceable person. He himself is the same man as ever, only his mind seems churned into a foam by the late agitations and is yielding a plentiful scum of vanities and harmless affectations. The hair of his head is like Nebuchadnezzar&#x2019;s when taken in from grass:<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Dan. 4:33.</note> he puckers up his face into various seamy peaks, rolls his eyes, and puffs like a blast-furnace; talking abundantly a flood of things, the body of which is nonsense, but intermingled with sparkles of curious thinking, and tinctured with his usual flow of warm-hearted generosity and honest affection. We talked and debated, and the time went pleasantly along. He was for me up to London with him, for three months in summer, to see the world, that so I might begin writing in good earnest. I said nay&#x2014;the offer being incompatible at present with my other engagements, and at any rate savouring too much of patronage to suit my taste. He is a kind good man with many great qualities, but with absurdities of almost equal magnitude. He meditates things in which he must evidently fail; but being what he is, he must always retain a high place in the estimation of a certain portion of the public. He and his beloved are returning to Annan in a week or two, where they purpose to make some stay. I shall always wish him well: as men go, I know of no one like him.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See also Carlyle&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi>, II, 109&#x2013;13.</note></p>

<salute>My dear Jane,</salute>
<p>I had brought out this sheet last night, with intent to enjoy your company for an hour by means of it, when my conscience spoke up and told me it was shameful to waste your time and mine in such unprofitable tho&#x2019; delightful reveries; that &#x201C;Schiller&#x2019;s Life&#x201D; was not <hi rend="italic">begun</hi>, and to tell you that I was still in the bonds of idleness would but provoke your sorrow and contempt. In consequence of this sagacious admonition, I actually shoved in the little papers and took out the large ones; I commenced that unheard of enterprize, toiled at it till my eyes fell together; and tho&#x2019; out of extreme dulness my advance was scarce perceptible, I make that achievement of half a blotted page <pb id="pg-02-458" n="02:458"/>the pretext of scribbling to you this evening without let or hinderance. You are more to me than all the Schillers of the Earth: I turn to you in all my hopes and undertakings, and have no pleasure in the world like that of talking to you.</p>
<p>What a blessed vision is this which my own beloved Jane contemplates for us two! Three months beside each other&#x2014;three months employed in gathering knowledge, seeing wonders, interchanging all our thoughts&#x2014;together, never parted by business or by ceremony&#x2014;delighted with the world and with each other&#x2014;you growing in improvement, I shewing you by words and deeds a thousand times a-day that I loved you more than any thing beneath the sky! This, I declare, were a prospect which could it be realized might almost turn one&#x2019;s head with happiness. Three months spent in such pure felicity would contain more heartfelt joy than many a lengthened life, and might make a man surrender all the hopes of more distant years for the sake of so much present satisfaction. But alas! alas! there is clay in all things that dwell upon this nether Earth. I have reflected on this project in various moods; I have seen the great Divine and studied him; the sunshine of your letter is freckled with a thousand clouds. As yet I can decide on nothing; nor will I, till we meet and talk two days together: you shall have all my reasons and exposures; and then <hi rend="italic">you shall decide yourself</hi>. We have but one interest in this as in all things.</p>
<p>But whether I go or stay, there appears to me abundance of inducement to take you thither<supplied>[.]</supplied> Irving contemplates I know not what advantage from submitting you to the example and kindly influences of this seraphic Mrs Montagu; for the whole of which I would not give three straws: I already know this eternal Mrs Montagu; take some two or three thousand a year, a graceful demeanour, a kind disposition, and a boundless admiration of His Reverence, I could bet that these are all the leading features of that terrestrial angel: and I run no risk of flattering when I say that your character neither will nor should assume another form from <hi rend="italic">hers</hi>. I rather incline to think she will have more instruction to get than to give from the proposed conjunction. But independently of such chimerical advantages, the benefits of this journey do really seem considerable. You will see new forms of life, you will converse with cultivated men, you may gather much insight into character and manners, and what is equally desireable into the nature and extent of your own powers and the best mode of turning them to use. Not that I think <pb id="pg-02-459" n="02:459"/>this essential: patient study, constant, long-continued, earnest endeavours will bring forth your genius in its native brightness without this fostering, and nothing else will even with it. Still it cannot fail to help, and therefore has a certain value. Another thing I look to is the happiness which you may realize along with these improvements. Storing your mind with so many novelties, some of them so instructive, you cannot fail of being comfortable. Edward Irving you know as well as I: with all his unspeakable absurdities and affectations he has the warmest and most beneficent heart of any man I ever saw. He loves you as a sister, and will treat you as one. His wife you will hardly like, but neither can you well dislike her. She <hi rend="italic">is</hi> unbeautiful; has no enthusiasm, and few ideas that are not prosaic or conceited: but she possesses I believe many household virtues; she loves her husband and will love his friends. On the whole, you must go. I will escort you thither in the month of <date when="1824-05-00">May</date>; and if I cannot stay with you, I will return and bring you back in safety to your Mother&#x2019;s hearth, whenever you grow tired. It will grieve me deeply if we determine that I am not to abide with you; the home of my mind is where you are; would that my bodily home were there too! But I shall live in hope that future days will use us better; that we shall not leave the world without tasting in more unfettered intercourse the blessedness of this affection which makes us one. Yes, my darling Jane! I feel as if there were something sacred in the love I bear you; as if Providence could not mean that this last streak of heavenly brightness should fade away in vain from my tempestuous sky. I have told you we were made for each other&#x2019;s happiness, ordained for one another from the beginning of time. Let mutual faith and devotedness and true honour be our constant guides: if they conduct us to happiness, such as Earth has seldom witnessed or mortal hearts enjoyed, our part will be thankfulness to the Beneficent Creator and love stronger than death to one another thro&#x2019; all the dark vicissitudes of our being: if not, <hi rend="italic">we</hi> cannot help it, the blame will not be ours.</p>
<p>Irving and I spoke about this project of his and my share in it; but we could come to no conclusion. He figured out purposes of unspeakable profit to me, which when strictly examined all melted into empty air. He seemed to think that if set down on London streets some strange development of genius would take place in me, that by conversing with Coleridge and the Opium eater,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >De Quincey.</note> I should find out new <pb id="pg-02-460" n="02:460"/>channels for speculation, and soon learn to speak with tongues.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle&#x2019;s remark is perhaps a significant but unknowing anticipation, for it was not until <date when="1831-00-00">1831</date> that Irving was able to report to a friend that &#x201C;two of my flock have received the gift of tongues and prophecy.&#x201D; He and his congregat ion were not alone in believing that this broken speech, or gibberish, was the same as the scriptural possession by the Holy Spirit, as in Acts 2:1&#x2013;13, 10:46, 19:6; 1 Cor. 12:10, 13:1, and 14:2.</note> There is but a very small degree of truth in all this. Of genius (bless the mark!) I never imagined in the most lofty humours that I possessed beyond the smallest perceptible fraction; and this fraction be it little or less can only be turned to account by rigid and stern perseverance thro&#x2019; long years of labour, in London or any other spot in the universe. With a scanty modicum of health, a little freedom from the low perplexities of vulgar life, with friends and peace, I might do better; but these are not to <supplied>[be]</supplied> found by travelling towards any quarter of the compass that I know of; so we must try what can be done with our present very short allowance of them. Untiring perseverance, stubborn effort is the remedy: help cometh not from the hills or vallies; my own poor arm weak and shackled as it is must work out my deliverance, or I am forever captive and in bonds. Irving said I had none to love or reverence in Scotland. Kind, simple Irving! I did not tell him of the hearts in Scotland that I will love till my own has ceased to feel; of <hi rend="italic">her</hi>, whose warm and pure and generous affection I would not exchange for the maudlin sympathy of all the peers and peeresses and prim saints and hypochondriacal old women of either Sex in the creation. I told him that love concentered on a few objects or a single one was like a river flowing within its appointed banks, calm, clear, rejoicing in its course; diffused over many it was like that river spread abroad upon a province, stagnant, shallow, cold and profitless. He puckered up his face into various furrowy peaks at this remark, and talked about the devil and universal benevolence, reproving me withal because I ventured to laugh at the pretensions of the devil.</p>
<p>On the whole our friend&#x2019;s mind seems to have improved but little since he left us. He <supplied>[is as]</supplied> full as ever of a certain hearty unrefined good-will, for which I honour him as I have always done: his faculties also have been quickened in the hot-bed of Hatton Garden, but affectation and vanity have grown up as rankly as other worthier products. It does me ill to see a strong and generous spirit distorting itself into a thousand foolish shapes; putting wilfully on the fetters of a thousand prejudices, very weak tho&#x2019; very sanctified; dwindling with <pb id="pg-02-461" n="02:461"/>its own consent from a true and manly figure into some thing far too like a canting preacher of powerful sermons. He mistakes too: this popularity is different from fame. The fame of a genuine man of letters is like the radiance of another star added to the galaxy of intellect to shine there for many ages; the popularity of a pulpit orator is like a tar-barrel set up in the middle of the street to blaze with a fierce but very tarnished flame, for a few hours, and then go out in a cloud of sparkles and thick smoke offensive to the lungs and noses of the whole neighbourhood. Our friend must order matters otherwise. Unless he look to it, he bids fair for becoming a turgid rather than a grand character; a kind of theological braggadocio, an enlarged edition of the Rev<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Rowland Hill,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Rev. Rowland Hill (<date when="1744-00-00">1744</date>&#x2013;<date when="1833-00-00">1833</date>) was a successful evangelical clergyman who, although estranged by unorthodox methods from the Church of England, rose to fame and to the ministry of the Surrey Chapel, London. He was an ardent supporter of Sunday Schools (of which he had thirteen in the Surrey Chapel) and published <hi rend="italic">An Apology for Sunday Schools</hi> in <date when="1801-00-00">1801</date>. He also achieved fame as author of his <hi rend="italic">Psalms and Hymns</hi> (<date when="1783-00-00">1783</date>), which went through many editions, wrote <hi rend="italic">Village Dialogues</hi> (<date when="1810-00-00">1810</date>) and a tract favoring innoculation.</note> but no great man, more than I or any other of the King&#x2019;s liege subjects. However, as the preachers say &#x201C;I hope better things, tho&#x2019; I thus speak.&#x201D; I expect something from the prudence of his wife; more from the changes of fortune that await him. There is a strong current of honest manly affection and wholesome feeling running beneath all this sorry scum; perhaps a clearance will take place in due time. I love the man with all his nonsense, I was <foreign><hi rend="italic">wae</hi></foreign> to part with him. If he will keep you happy for three months, I shall forgive him every thing.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jane was not to go to London. Froude comments, &#x201C;Irving could not face the trial,&#x201D; and quotes his letter to Jane Welsh: &#x201C;My dear Isabella has succeeded in healing the wounds of my heart &#x2026; but I am hardly yet in a condition to expose them. My former calmness and piety are returning. I feel growing in grace and holiness; and before another year I shall be worthy in the eye of my own conscience to receive you into my house and under my care, which till then I shall hardly be&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi>, I, 190).</note></p>
<p>In the mean time, you will stick close to the task that is before you. <hi rend="italic">We creep before walking</hi>, the adage says; and so it shall be with Jane and me. Never faulter, my own heroic Jane; you have chosen the better part, and all will turn out as it should. Glorious employments, heavenly days are yet before us. Your mind shall yet attain its full stature, be admired of all the world, and loved by me forever as the life-blood of my own.&#x2014; These difficulties in Mus&#xE4;us I easily understand: do not let them scare you. Never mind preserving the figure of his style, there is no peculiar beauty in it. Alter every thing according <pb id="pg-02-462" n="02:462"/>to your own notions; cut sentences into two; join two together; turn them inside out, just as seems good to you. I think you would find it adviseable to <hi rend="italic">read over three or four times</hi> the passage you mean to work on for the day; to make up your mind about the difficulties, and impress the whole upon your mind, before putting pen to paper: then the words will flow as smooth as oil. Tell me every thing about this, and all and sundry. All! all! I am never satiated with hearing my <hi rend="italic">other self</hi>.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi>, VIII, 450.</note></p>
<p>What of this unhappy Youth? My feelings towards him will soon be mingled largely with contempt and anger unless he cease to tease you with his sorrows. Why does he not forbear to see you altogether? I pray you for all sakes not to mind him or get sick again. It is pitiful in the man to act thus: but what will not disappointed affection drive one to? Tell me how it is. What length are you got with Lybussa? Do you read any thing? Will you not finish Gibbon? Brother Johnathan will be in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> shortly; and proud to furnish you with any book you want. I still hope to see you in <date when="1823-11-00">November</date>: I will set out when this miserable &#x201C;Life&#x201D; is completed. Look that you be good and diligent and <hi rend="italic">happy</hi>, and write to me every blessed week. O that <date when="1823-11-00">November</date> were here, and the Highland hills behind me, and I sitting by my own beloved Jane, telling all and hearing all! God bless you my Dearest! You will write to me <hi rend="italic">immediately</hi>? <closer><salute>I am your&#x2019;s forever,</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>My dear Alick&#x2014;</salute>Having an hour and a half at my disposal to-day, and an opportunity of conveyance, I hesitate not, though rather stupid, to sit down and send you some inkling of my news. This is the more necessary, as it seems possible enough that ere long some change may take place in my situation; of which I would not have you altogether unapprised.</p>
<p>Your little fragment of a letter was gratifying by the news it brought me that you are busy in your speculations, lucky hitherto, and bent on persevering. I cannot but commend your purpose. There <pb id="pg-02-463" n="02:463"/>is not on the earth so horrible a malady as idleness, voluntary or constrained. Well said Byron: &#x201C;Quiet to quick bosoms is a hell.&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Childe Harold</hi>, III, 370.</note> So long as you are conscious of adding to your stock of knowledge or other useful qualities, and feel that your faculties are fitly occupied, the mind is active and contented. As to the issue of these traffickings, I pray you, my good boy, not at all to mind it. Care not one rush about that silly cash, which to me has no value whatever, except for its use to you.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >When Carlyle went home in <date when="1823-07-00">July</date>, he had &#xa3;300 in his pocket, his salary for eighteen months from the Bullers. He spread it around among members of his family very generously.</note> Pride may say several things to you; but do you tell her she has nothing to meddle or make in the case: I am as proud in my own way as you; but what any brethren of our Father&#x2019;s house <supplied>[may possess]</supplied> I look on as a common stock, mine as much as theirs, from which all are entitled to draw, whenever their convenience requires it. Feelings far nobler than pride are my guides in such matters. Are we not all friends by habit and by nature? If it were not for Mainhill, I should still find myself in some degree <hi rend="italic">alone</hi> in this weary world.</p>
<p>Jack&#x2019;s German &#x201C;all goes well&#x201D; appeared on the newspaper last but one: I have vainly sought for it on the last. I suppose he is gone to Edinburgh, or just going; and I hope ere long to have that solacing announcement repeated more in detail. I understand the crop is now in the yard; I trust that it bids fair to produce as it ought; that you have now got in the potatoes also, and made your arrangements for passing the winter as snugly as honest hearts and active hands may enable you. Above all, I trust that our dear Mother and the rest are enjoying that first of blessings, bodily health, without which spiritual contentment is a thing not once to be dreamed of. As for us of Kinnaird, we are plodding forward in the old inconstant and not too comfortable style. The winter is setting in upon us; these old black ragged ridges to the west have put on their frozen caps, and the sharp breezes that come sweeping across them are loaded with cold. I cannot say that I delight in this. My &#x201C;Bower&#x201D; is the most polite of bowers, refusing admittance to no wind that blows from any quarter of the ship-man&#x2019;s card. It is scarcely larger than your room at Mainhill, yet has three windows and of course a door; all shrunk and crazy: the walls too are pierced with many crevices; for the mansion has been built by Highland masons, apparently in a remote century. Nevertheless I put on my gray duffle sitting <foreign><hi rend="italic">jupe</hi></foreign>; I bullyrag the sluttish harlots of the place, <pb id="pg-02-464" n="02:464"/>and cause them make fires that would melt a stithy. Against this evil, therefore, I contrive to make a formidable front. &#x2026;</p>
<p>I believe I mentioned to Jack that they had printed a pitiful performance of mine, Schiller&#x2019;s &#x201C;Life,&#x201D; Part I., in the <hi rend="italic">London Magazine</hi>; and sent very pressingly for the continuation of it. In consequence, I threw by my translation, and betook me to preparing this notable piece of Biography. But such a humor as I write it in! &#x2026; What my next movements may be, I am unable to say positively. I must have my Book (the translation) printed in Edinburgh, but first it must be ready. It is not impossible that I may come down to Mainhill for a couple of months till I finish it. Perhaps after all I may give up my resolution and continue where I am, though on the most solemn deliberation, I do not think such a determination can come to good. Next time I write you will hear more. Anyway you are likely to see me ere long: I must be in Edinburgh shortly, to arrange with Brewster and others. Whether I leave this place finally or not, I have settled that poor Bardolph must winter at Mainhill. A better pony never munched oats than that stubborn Galloway. But they are hungering him here; he gets no meat but musty hay and a mere memorial of corn every day; so he is very faint and chastened in spirit compared with what he was. Out upon it! the spendthrift <hi rend="italic">is</hi> better than the miser; anything is better. &#x2026;</p>
<p>This blessed stomach I have lost all patience with. The want of health threatens to be the downdraught of all my lofty schemes. My heart is burnt with fury and indignation when I think of being cramped and shackled and tormented as never man till me was. &#x2018;There is too much fire in my belly,&#x2019; as Ram Dass<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Either a Sikh leader of the Sixteenth Century or a Maratha poet of the seventeenth century. In &#x201C;Sir Walter Scott,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XXIX, 36, Carlyle wrote: &#x201C;Brother Ringletub, the missionary, inquired to Ram-Dass, a Hindoo man-god, who had set up for godhood lately, What he meant to do, then, with the sins of mankind? To which Ram-Dass at once answered, He had <hi rend="italic">fire enough in his belly</hi> to burn-up all the sins in the world. Ram-Dass was right so far, and had a spice of sense in him; for surely it is the test of every divine man this same, and without it he is not divine or great,&#x2014;that he <hi rend="italic">have</hi> fire in him to burn-up somewhat of the sins of the world, of the miseries and errors of the world: why else is he there?&#x201D;</note> said, to permit dwindling into a paltry valetudinarian. I must and will be free of these despicable fetters, whatever may betide. &#x2026; I could almost set my house in order, and go and hang myself like Judas. If I take any of their swine-meat porridge, I sleep; but a double portion of stupidity overwhelms me, and I awake very early in the morning with the sweet consciousness that another day of my precious, precious time <pb id="pg-02-465" n="02:465"/>is gone irrevocably, that I have been very miserable yesterday, and shall be very miserable to-day. It is clear to me that I can never recover or retain my health under the economy of Mrs. Buller. Nothing, therefore, remains for me but to leave it. This kind of life is next to absolute starvation, only slower in its agony. And if I had my health even moderately restored, I could earn as much by my own exertions.</p>
<p>I meant to write to my Father; but this stomach has prevented me. Give my kindest love to him and our good Mother, and all the souls about home. Tell my Mother to take no anxiety on herself about me, lest anything serious happen to me: at present, two weeks of Annandale air would make me as well as she has seen me for many years. Good-night, my dear Alick! My candle is lit, yet I have not dined, the copper captain being out riding. Write to me the first moment you have, and advise Jack to do it if with you still.&#x2014;<closer><salute>I am, always your faithful Brother,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Jack,</salute>
<p>I grieve for the disappointment you will meet with to-day; but it will be brief, this letter comes into your hands to-morrow afternoon.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In two letters dated <date when="1823-11-04">4</date> and <date when="1823-11-08">8 Nov.</date>, John had given his plans for coming to Edinburgh and of his trip there. He arrived on <date when="1823-11-07">Friday, 7 Nov.</date> In his second letter he asked Carlyle to write to him on <date when="1823-11-10">Monday, 10 Nov.</date>, and Carlyle is here writing one day later.</note> The delays that have attended it have been various. First was a new arrangement of the Post, whereby he now returns the same day he comes; then was a foolish speculation on the part of <hi rend="italic">Missus</hi>,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mrs. Buller.</note> whereby your books cannot be sent by the <hi rend="italic">Carrier</hi>, and so I could not get the opportunity of a conveyance to Dunkeld yesterday, as you and I too expected. Lastly was my own stupidity; for after meditating long on the propriety of sending you a Bank draft by this Post-man (a person given to whisky and forgetfulness), after deciding in the affirmative, cutting my sheet exactly in the proper shape, and half filling it, there came into my head a plan, whereby all this trouble and hazard might\ <pb id="pg-02-466" n="02:466"/>be superseded. Whereupon I threw the well-shapen scraps of paper into the fire, and began again upon an unsullied and unmangled sheet. I have lit candles (or rather candle for want of time) and must make all the speed in the world.</p>
<p>You have writen to me very punctually of late, for which I need not say how sincerely I thank you. Go on as you have commenced: let me hear from you regularly and <hi rend="italic">very</hi> frequently throughout the winter. I am glad you have decided, or nearly so, on staying with Mrs Robertson. If you can <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi> there, the noise thro&#x2019; the day is of very little moment; and there is no other earthly objection. You have good air, about the best in the old town of Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, you are near the College, cheap, and have the best landlady in the parish. So I counsel you to stay&#x2014;unless these five watchmen, and five hundred dustmen prevent your nightly repose, which I believe they will not. There was one of the public guardians, whose throat I could have cut that night I lay (not slept) in the bed you occupy. He awoke me every half-hour throughout the night; his voice was loud, hideous and ear- and soul-piercing; resembling the voices of ten thousand gib-cats<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Tom-cats. <hi rend="italic">Gib</hi> is short for <hi rend="italic">Gilbert</hi>. Cf. <hi rend="italic">I Henry IV</hi>, I, ii.</note> all molten into one terrific peal. I would not lodge within a furlong of him for any pay.</p>
<p>As to the classes you have to attend, it is for yourself to judge. If you think this chemistry will be of advantage, any advantage, to your general proficiency, take out the ticket and hear Hope<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Charles Hope (<date when="1766-00-00">1766</date>&#x2013;<date when="1844-00-00">1844</date>), professor of chemistry at Edinburgh University.</note> again. I have often told you that a few pounds are nothing to your ultimate proficiency in the profession. About the other lectures there can be no hesitation. I have nothing farther to recommend but that you take the thing on you <hi rend="italic">with moderation</hi>; not slaying yourself all at once, by yielding to that excess of zeal, to which you as well as I are doomed (for good or evil) to be subject all your days. There is no mystery in becoming a better physician than the common run; but I know your ambition is far higher than this. It is right that you should feel so: I am no prophet if you fail.</p>
<p>For a few days you will feel very lonely and disconsolate. Be of good cheer, Jack! these vapours will pass away very shortly. There is no relief like diligence. Think that we shall all be joined together in mirth and happiness many times and long yet in this world; and that patient steadfastness on the part of every one of us is the only mean<supplied>[s]</supplied> of bringing out so delightful a result. I have told you many <pb id="pg-02-467" n="02:467"/>times it would all be well: I tell you so again; for there is mind in us and honesty and heartiness in the cause; qualities which will conquer <hi rend="italic">every</hi> thing, except the loss of life; and without which all accompaniments and means to boot are not worth a stiver. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Esperance</hi></foreign>! <foreign><hi rend="italic">Esperance</hi></foreign>!</p>
<p>You inquire about your general reading; concerning which I regret that I have so little space here for discussing it. There can be no objection to your reading Gibbon, provided you feel spirit enough in you for undertaking at leisure hours so heavy a task as twelve volumes of substantial reading. It is likely to awaken you, read it when you will. History you have heard me say a thousand times is the basis of all true general knowledge; and Gibbon is the most strong-minded of all historians. Perhaps, however, you had better let him be, till summer; for he will require all your thought, and at present you have it not all to spare. General literature, as it is called, seems the best thing for you in winter&#x2014;amusing, instructive, easy. You know the English classics by name: it is little matter in what order you begin them. Johnston&#x2019;s life of Boerhaave<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Samuel Johnson (<date when="1709-00-00">1709</date>&#x2013;<date when="1784-00-00">84</date>), &#x201C;The Life of Boerhaave,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Gentleman&#x2019;s Magazine</hi>, <date when="1739-01-00">Jan.</date>&#x2013;<date when="1739-04-00">April 1739</date>; in &#x201C;Lives of Eminent Persons,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> (London, <date when="1792-00-00">1792</date>&#x2013;<date when="1811-00-00">1811</date>), vol. XII. Dr. Herman Boerhaave (<date when="1688-00-00">1688</date>&#x2013;<date when="1738-00-00">1738</date>), of Leyden, was a great physician, whose life, Carlyle assumed, would be of interest to his brother.</note> you may get; it is, as well as several other lives, the production of his first literary years, therefore slight and trivial, compared with his later performances. But nothing that Samuel wrote is unworthy of perusal: I recommend his works especially to your notice; they are full of <hi rend="italic">wisdom</hi>, which is quite a different thing and a far better one than mere knowledge. You will like him better the older you grow. Swift is also a first-rate fellow: his Gulliver, and Tale of a Tub, and many of his smaller pieces are inimitable in their way. Have you read all Shakespeare? Have you read Fielding&#x2019;s novels? they are genuine things; tho&#x2019; if you were not a decent fellow, I should pause before recommending them, their morality is so loose. Smollett&#x2019;s too are good and bad in a similar style and degree. One of your first leisure afternoons should be devoted to Don Quixote: it is a classic of Europe, one of the finest books in nature. Did you ever see Boswell&#x2019;s life of Johnston? There is a &#x201C;British Theatre,&#x201D;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">The British Theatre</hi>, 25 vols.

Peter&#x2019;s Letters to his Kinsfolk,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Peter&#x2019;s Letters to His Kinsfolk</hi>, 3 vols. (London and Edinburgh, <date when="1819-00-00">1819</date>), by John Gibson Lockhart, was published anonymously.</note> a worthless book, will give you some idea of the state of literature in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> at this time: it was in great vogue three years ago, <pb id="pg-02-468" n="02:468"/>but is now dead as mutton. Then there are poets new and old; Masons Gray<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Mason (<date when="1725-00-00">1725</date>&#x2013;<date when="1797-00-00">97</date>), <hi rend="italic">Poems and Letters of Gray. To Which Are Prefixed Memoirs of His Life and Writings</hi> (York, <date when="1775-00-00">1775</date>).</note> (very good and diverting), Prior (not amiss), Pope (eminently good), in short Campbell&#x2019;s specimens of the Brit. Poets<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Campbell (<date when="1777-00-00">1777</date>&#x2013;<date when="1844-00-00">1844</date>), <hi rend="italic">Specimens of the British Poets</hi>, 7 vols. (<date when="1819-00-00">1819</date>).</note> (which you should read immediately&#x2014;at least vol. 1.) will give you names enough of this kind: the living names are Byron, Scott (nearly done), Southey, Coleridge (very great but rather mystical, sometimes absurd), Wordsworth (much talked of), Moore&#x2019;s Lallah Rooke, Rogers, Milman &#x26;c &#x26;c<supplied>[.]</supplied> In prose we have Hazzlitt (worth little, tho&#x2019; clever). [torn] (for history) Washington Irving &#x26;c &#x26;c<supplied>[.]</supplied> Poor Washington is dead three months ago!<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A mistaken rumor.</note> I al<supplied>[most]</supplied> shed a tear when I heard it: it was a dream of mine that we two should be friends!&#x2014; On the subject of these studies I will tell you more when we meet.</p>
<p>About the end of this week you will get a box full of books. Make the bearer of it (and bid Mrs Robertson in case of your absence make him) give you a receipt for whatever money he may charge by way of carriage. The Books are Buller&#x2019;s all but four. You will have to take them to the Library (having first waited on Murray&#x2014; Baird&#x2019;s Lodgings: 161, Rose-street for a batch of <hi rend="italic">receipts</hi>, there lying sealed up for me); to give them in, and get a pound for every one of your receipts: I think there are eleven. <hi rend="italic">This</hi> is the cash that shall serve you till I come with plenty. You can take out tickets &#x26;c as far as it will go. Your own four books will also come to hand; two Schiller&#x2019;s along with this box (I will also send Irving&#x2019;s orations, and the Lond. Mag. if I can); and two Goethes which I will write to <foreign><hi rend="italic">la plus belle des belles</hi></foreign> [the fairest of the fair]<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jane Welsh.</note> to send you without delay. Then you can go forth and prosper. I shall need a cargo of books to take back with me&#x2014;one or two. When you have got these books of Buller&#x2019;s, and your own, and settled them all&#x2014;write to me without a moment&#x2019;s delay&#x2014;sooner if you feel the slightest call; then any way.</p>
<p>When I may see you cannot yet be settled to a day or a week. I shall not start till I am done <hi rend="italic">at least</hi> with Part II. of Schiller. I get on with it dreadfully slow: I am now almost half-done with writing it the second time&#x2014;often harder than the first; some nights I am fitter for the hospital than the writing desk; all nights (and I never get it touched till then) I am sick and stupid and done, as never man was <pb id="pg-02-469" n="02:469"/>that persisted in such a task. Nevertheless I do persist, and will do while I live. Three months more, and I am out of this poisonous <foreign><hi rend="italic">menage</hi></foreign>! When they go to Cornwall, I <hi rend="italic">am</hi> to have a house of my own &#x2014;if I go! But that is not so sure.&#x2014; I should think then that it will be the <hi rend="italic">end</hi> of this month ere I come; perhaps the beginning of <date when="1823-12-00">December</date>, if I get on with Part III. Frank Dickson is to meet me; and Sandy will likely see you, for I am going to give him this horse, which is decaying fast (of hunger), and growing doubly useless, the weather being too cold for riding. I purpose being absent about a week: if I am well, I shall go for a day to Haddington to see Mademoiselle&#x2019;s Translation. Your translation, and a new one if possible we shall arrange about then. If there is none to be had never mind; above all <hi rend="italic">rejoice</hi> that you have no private teaching: it is a poor craft, among studies like yours. Try if you can <foreign><hi rend="italic">speir</hi></foreign> [seek] me out a quiet sleepingroom&#x2014;you or Mrs R. I am to be down <hi rend="italic">for good</hi> in the End of <date when="1824-02-00">Feb<hi rend="italic">y</hi></date>. <hi rend="italic">Meister</hi> will go to press. <foreign>Adieu</foreign> my true Jack!

<salute>Dearest Friend</salute>
<p>Instead of wondering that I have not written sooner, you may bless your stars that I am able to write to you <hi rend="italic">now</hi>. I have been nearer heaven, since you heard of me, than I wish to be again for some two score years to come. About three weeks ago, I sallied forth with my Mother to a confounded teaparty, one very rainy evening; and was tempted of the Devil to leave my bonnet behind, for fear of spoiling the arrangement of my hair&#x2014; The consequence was that both of us were attacked with furious colds, from which I was the greatest sufferer; as I richly deserved to be&#x2014; One day in particular, I was so ill that I believed I shoud not live, and those about me seemed to be much of the same opinion&#x2014; Poor little D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Fyffe! his hand shook so when he felt my pulse! I am sure it was twenty beats quicker for his panic&#x2014;however the thread of my life was not yet spun&#x2014; I fell asleep revolving last testaments and other pathetic matters, and when I awoke I was as free from pain as ever I was in my life&#x2014; And now I am quite <pb id="pg-02-470" n="02:470"/>recovered except for a slight cough, attended with no inconvenience but that of obliging me to wear a cap (a proper punishment for my fit of vanity). Moreover I do not mean to allege indisposition as my excuse for a <hi rend="italic">fortnights</hi> silence&#x2014;as far as my health is concerned I have been able enough to write for these last ten days; but the house as usual has been full of people and I deemed it advisable to employ the few minutes I could rescue from the wreck of my time towards the performance of my task rather than in vexing you with the obstacles in the way of my welldoing&#x2014; the last of our visitors is gone this morning, and (God willing) I shall have a respite till the end of next week when we expect a new invasion.

<salute>My dearest Jane,</salute>
<p>Your letter, which I received this moment, has distressed me very much. It is needless to say that I felt impatient and unhappy at your silence: day or night more or less immediately, your image is ever present with me; and uncertainty is in such cases always the parent of uneasiness. It struck me once or twice that you might be unwell; but I thought it foolish to entertain such black imaginations, most probably the mere result of my own unquiet and too forecasting mind. Alas! alas! there was no imagination here; you have been sick, and it is too plain that you are still sick. To think that <hi rend="italic">you</hi> should be oppressed with bodily disease, that the pure sanctuary of your being should be darkened and deformed by the continual intrusion of material pain&#x2014;I declare it is enough to make me utterly desperate. Oh! I know it, for six<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle usually speaks of his illness as beginning in <date when="1818-00-00">1818</date>.</note> long miserable years I have known it: it is the most frightful sentence which Heaven in its wrath can pass upon a mortal. And good God! if you should die, and leave me destitute and lonely in this world, which your presence almost alone still paints for me with some colours of beauty and hope! O Jane! if my happiness is dear to you, as I know it is, you will be doubly careful of your precious <pb id="pg-02-472" n="02:472"/>health. Do, I conjure you for my sake, make this your first and most essential study. Should it not be so? If any thing befal you, what are we both?</p>
<p>But why should I dwell on this dark side of the picture. Your mother will nurse you, and force you to take care of yourself; you will be quite well; I trust in God you will. As for the <hi rend="italic">cap</hi>, I do not mind it: you had on a cap the first time I saw you, and nothing could become you better. You were the loveliest creature! I shall never forget that summer&#x2019;s evening while I exist.</p>
<p>In your letters for a long time I have noticed something like a tone of subdued distress, a kind of melancholy, which while it makes me love you more tenderly, convinces me too clearly that you are not happy. My beloved Jane, you must strive against these things; you must not take the business of life so heavily upon you. I am not for preaching patience: it is a virtue of which neither you nor I were born to make successful profession. We are restless, sleepless creatures, whose enjoyment lies in the very struggle for enjoyment. It is for your discontent, in circumstances where so many of your sex would think themselves supremely happy, that I love and honour you. Let it be the incitement to strenuous enterprize: but do not give way to despondency, or fret yourself with regrets. I have told you often that your longings and efforts would not be in vain: every day I see new reason to repeat the prophecy. Your very diffidence is to me fresh evidence of the generous power that lies in the faculties of your heart and head. &#x201C;Genius,&#x201D; says Schiller, &#x201C;is ever a secret to itself.&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">&#x201C;Das Genie immer sich selbst ein Geheimnis bleibt.&#x201D;</hi> Friedrich Schiller, &#x201C;&#xdc;ber naive und sentimentalische Dichtung&#x201D; (<date when="1795-00-00">1795</date>), par. 20. See also Carlyle&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Schiller, Works</hi>, XXV, 199.</note> So it is, if my experience of men have taught me any thing. Coleridge says he never knew a youth of real talents that did not labour under bashfulness and disbelief in his own ability.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >This appears to be a rather loose reference to several passages in the <hi rend="italic">Biographia Literaria</hi>.</note> I could <hi rend="italic">prove</hi> all this to you, if I had room; but it is not necessary. A noble spirit you have in you, the noblest I have ever seen; with your unwearied eagerness, this <hi rend="italic">must</hi> in time display itself in its full proportions; and is not that the great aim and object of your life? I tell you all must and shall be well. Yes, you <hi rend="italic">will</hi> marry; but do something far more glorious than &#x201C;make puddings&#x201D;; you shall make immortal food for the souls of generous men in lands and ages that you have never seen and never can see. My mother says &#x201C;they that meaned at a gowden gown got aye the <pb id="pg-02-473" n="02:473"/>sleeve&#x201D;;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Those who aimed at a golden gown always got the sleeve.&#x201D; Cf. Scott, <hi rend="italic">Redgauntlet</hi>, Letter II, <date when="1824-00-00">1824</date>: &#x201C;What says my father&#x2019;s proverb? &#x2018;Look to a gown of gold, and you will at least get a sleeve of it.&#x2019;&#x201D;</note> an honest proverb, and full of truth. Never despond, my heroic Jane! Your path is full of difficulties, but have you not an immortal goal before you? Above all, my darling, never cease to tell me <hi rend="italic">all</hi> your sorrows real and imaginary. It is absolutely impossible that you should ever &#x201C;vex&#x201D; or &#x201C;tire&#x201D; me with the recital of these things. Nor can the disclosure of them ever lower you in my esteem, knowing as I do by dire experience how all these matters are. Betide you what may, succesful or not successful in the high purposes that give a new splendour to your character, my esteem, my reverence and love remains with you unaltered&#x2014;a love that is extending itself into the deepest sources of my nature, and becoming more and more commingled with whatever of happiness or dignity I look for in this world. This it seems to me is something for both of us: we cannot be <hi rend="italic">alone</hi>, however it may be. What Fortune may determine concerning us I know not: but I know that our souls were fashioned for one another by the hand of Nature, I know that we <hi rend="italic">love</hi> one another, and that nothing but our own resolutions can destroy that most delightful of sentiments.</p>
<p>I really wish much you would make up your mind to tell me <hi rend="italic">every thing</hi> that you wish and intend and dislike and fear. It appears to me, that if we once saw the whole case plainly before us, much might be done to remedy the evils you have to complain of. For I am not blind to the grievances with which your present situation is beset. You are among people whom you <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> sympathize with, who do not understand you, whose officious interference but makes worse what it means to remedy. Your intellectual progress is obstructed, and you have no aim in common with those about you, the success of which might be a compensation. I wish to Heaven, you <hi rend="italic">were</hi> my Sister&#x2014;since it must be so. I would take you down to the Land&#x2019;s End with me;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >If he went with the Bullers to their family seat in Cornwall.</note> I would be your teacher, your guardian, you should be my presiding spirit, the cheerer of all my woes, the directress of all my concerns and actions. Oh! we would love one another till death, and care no jot about all the vulgar people in the solar system! But it is needless to talk of this; you are not my Sister, where you are thither I cannot come. Nevertheless, we love one another, and place no bounds to our mutual confidence. Let us unite our judgements, and see what <hi rend="italic">can</hi> be done to redress these evils that obstruct and harrass us. I myself am soon going to be next to frantic, unless I can arrange my destiny more according <pb id="pg-02-474" n="02:474"/>to my mind. We will! we <hi rend="italic">shall</hi> get over these things: this disquietude that is in both of us assures me of it. &#x201C;Love and friendship shall encircle our kindred souls,&#x201D; we shall both of us be happy and great in our day!</p>
<p>I am coming down about this time three weeks, when we shall discuss all these affairs, growing more important to us every day. Pity that some angel would not descend and tell us what to do! Never mind this <hi rend="italic">Lybussa</hi>: you are taking far too much pains with it; consider it the refreshment not the occupation of your mind, and you will prosper better in it. Do not dream of writing it twice over; printers can read any thing; I will get it copied for you, if need be. It is but the tottering of a mind that will yet soar. Will you have Doering&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Schiller</hi><note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-03/lt-18240712-TC-HCR-01">TC to <sic>H. C. Robinson</sic><corr>HCR</corr>, <date when="1824-07-12">12 July 1824</date></ref>.</note> and write a Life of him for Brewster? Think of this<supplied>[.]</supplied></p>
<p>My own miserable <hi rend="italic">Life</hi> gets on drearily; the second Part is not much more than half done! I am next to dead, every night at six, when I begin it; and two pages I reckon a feat extraordinary. Poor Devil! I wonder what is to become of me. Goethe has been dormant for five weeks. It <hi rend="italic">is</hi> to be printed in <date when="1824-02-00">February</date>: I have stipulated so with these Bullers&#x2014;for leave to be in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> till <date when="1824-05-00">May</date>. On the whole I will struggle forward, tho&#x2019; at the rate of an inch per week, while there is a spark of life left within me; I will die if it must be so, still struggling forward.</p>
<p>I feel a considerable temptation to cut these Bullers. The place does nothing earthly for me but bring in two hundred pounds a year, and without at all employing, it occupies at least three fourths of my time. Woe is me that I cannot live on air! One thing I am resolved upon: it is to live no more under their roof, if <date when="1824-02-00">February</date> were here. Mrs Buller has the secret of spending seven or eight thousand a year with a <hi rend="italic">minimum</hi> of comfort, more completely than any lady I ever saw. Extravagance and poorest parsimony, splendour and meanness&#x2014; Your house at Haddington has not only ten times the real substantial means of enjoyment in it, but is even more genteel, than ours with all our efforts, and I should suppose about ten or twelve times the expence. If I were in Buller&#x2019;s place, I would swallow ratsbane. To roast out thirty years of his best beneath the burning sky of India, and come home to this! He is the most honest patient good soul I ever saw&#x2014; But this is no concern of mine; farther than that having convinced myself that health can <hi rend="italic">never</hi> be restored to me under Mrs B&#x2019;s menage, I have signified to them my purpose of withdrawing. This they struggled to oppose, invited me earnestly to suggest amendments, spoke in the <pb id="pg-02-475" n="02:475"/>most friendly terms, and told me that if I went to Cornwall, I should but have the eldest and best of my pupils to attend to, and <hi rend="italic">might live in a house of my own.</hi> <foreign><hi rend="italic">Adhuc sub lite est</hi></foreign> [It is yet undecided]. They expect me to go, I observe; but it still remains to be considered, whether for the sake of such a sum and five hours daily to be spent for it, I should move so far, and make so many changes. We will talk of this when I come down. Would you forget me if I went to Cornwall? This often strikes me to the heart.</p>
<p>But I must not waste <hi rend="italic">all</hi> my sheet, till I have told you <hi rend="italic">the message</hi>, such as it is. There are two German Books with you, I think; Jack is come into Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> and needs to give them in to the Library. They can be sent back to you immediately if you wish it. Will you transmit them to Jonathan as soon as convenient. His address is: Robertson&#x2019;s Lodgings, 35 Bristo-street. He will be proud to furnish you with any books you want. This too we must arrange.&#x2014; Now remember, my own Jane, what reason I have to feel anxieties about you, and <hi rend="italic">what</hi> a case I shall be in unless you write to me without delay. O Do write&#x2014; I shall imagine you are dead&#x2014;if you keep so long silent another time. If you cannot fill a sheet; give me half or quarter. Your fortune is mine&#x2014;let me know it, whatever it is. <foreign>Adieu</foreign> my heart&#x2019;s beloved! <closer><salute>I am your own thro&#x2019; life and death,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I am sorry to have kept you waiting for this worthless article. &#x201C;Part. I.&#x201D; owing to the total silence maintained on all hands respecting it, and to my own unfeigned disgust with the performance, had entirely gone out of my head: I was busied with other things, and had forgotten the existence of Schiller, when your letter recalled his &#x201C;Life&#x201D; to my recollection. I then threw aside as many other occupations as I could, and resumed the task: sickness and dulness and many interruptions have detained me at it till this day. Part III. I intend to finish, before taking any other business in hand: it is meant to be about as long as this.</p>
<p>I have or had a considerable series of such Lives in view&#x2014;Alfieri, Voltaire, Rousseau &#x26;c&#x2014;which might be arranged under heads, according <pb id="pg-02-476" n="02:476"/>to the psychological qualities of the men, the nature of their pursuits, or even their national characters&#x2014;to give the undertaking that sort of unity and system, which one likes to see in such things. For the present, all this must be postponed. I have a translation from Goethe to print in <date when="1824-02-00">Feb<hi rend="italic">y</hi></date>; and one of these days, I am to be the subject of a solemn conclave of Physicians. Should I in any tolerable degree recover, I have thoughts of seeing London in Summer; when I hope to meet with you, and talk of these and many other matters.</p>

<salute>My dear Alick,</salute>
<p>I need not say with what pleasure I received your kind, spirited and affectionate letter. It is sweet to me to hear that you are all as you should be; sweet to know that you all <hi rend="italic">truly</hi> sympathize with me in my afflictions, tho&#x2019; it be little in your power or in human power to help them.</p>
<p>You said you would come for the pony at a moment&#x2019;s warning: I am going to take you at your word. Before you can read this notice, I am on the road for Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, where I shall be waiting to receive you, and deliver up this faithful steed into your hands. Jack told me you had got another galloway; a circumstance that made me pause in my intention of sending this Bardolph down to winter with you; but I reflected that perhaps it might be easy for you to sell the present one, and reinstate Dolph in his rights and privileges of carrying you up and down the country in your trafficking expeditions, and so working for his oats and hay as he is in duty bound. If it is not so, you may let me know by letter while I am in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>; in which case I may perhaps take the beast with me again&#x2014;that is if I return myself. There was a Notary Public at Broughty-ferry, when I was down seeing Johnstone&#x2014;wanting to buy it, being struck by the freedom of its paces as he saw me riding it about. The Landlord of the Inn there, a <foreign><hi rend="italic">hash</hi></foreign> [blockhead] if there is one, said it was a &#x201C;virry fine beast Sir&#x201D;; and as for the <hi rend="italic">saddle&#x2014;that</hi> could not be matched in Angus.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-02-477" n="02:477"/>The truth is, however, I want to see yourself in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, that the whole three<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Including John.</note> of us may hold solemn council on what is farther to be done not with the horse alone, but with his rider. The Bullers and I have had some farther conversation on the subject of my going or staying: they are to give me a letter to George Bell,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Bell (<date when="1777-00-00">1777</date>&#x2013;<date when="1832-00-00">1832</date>) was known as a first-rate surgeon. His father Benjamin Bell (<date when="1749-00-00">1749</date>&#x2013;<date when="1806-00-00">1806</date>) was an authority on ulcers.</note> the celebrate d Surgeon in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, who is maturely to investigate the state of my unfortunate carcass, and see if nothing can be done to aid me. By his advice I must in some degree be guided in my future movements. They are anxious of course that I should return; but fully prepared for my quitting them should that seem necessary; they have in fact written by my advice to Dr Brewster about providing them a successor, and it is one of my engagements to communicate with Brewster on this point. I do not think it likely that he will find any suitable person; in which case, should I retire from duty, the young men here must go to Cambridge or some other such seminary. They are all very kind to me here, and would do any thing to make me comfortable, and take me back on almost any terms.</p>
<p>I confess I am greatly at a loss what to do; and for that cause if there were no other, I am ill at ease. That some change <hi rend="italic">must</hi> be made in my arrangements is clear enough: at present, I am bowed down to the earth with such a load of woes as keeps me in continual darkness. I seem as it were <hi rend="italic">dying by inches</hi>; if I have one good day, it is sure to be followed by three or four ill ones. For the last week, I have not had any one sufficient sleep; even porridge has lost its effect on me. I need not say that I am far from happy.&#x2014; On the other hand, I have many comforts here; indeed I might live as snugly as possible, if it were not for this one solitary but all-sufficient cause. I know also and shudder at the miseries of living in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, as I did before; this I will not do. &#x201C;On the whole,&#x201D; as Jack says, it is become indispensible that I get back some shadow of health. My soul is crippled and smothered under a load of misery and disease, from which till I get partly relieved, life is burdensome and useless to me. We must all consult together, after I have heard the opinion of the &#x201C;Cunning Leech,&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Hudibras</hi>, I, ii, 245.</note> who I suppose will put me upon mercury; and <hi rend="italic">see what is</hi> to be done. If I were well, I fear nothing; if not, every thing. You need not think <pb id="pg-02-478" n="02:478"/>from all this that I am dying; there does not seem to be the slightest danger of that: I am only suffering daily as much bodily pain as I can well suffer without running <foreign><hi rend="italic">Wud</hi></foreign> [mad]. So having finished this &#x201C;Life of Schiller Part. II.&#x201D; and sent it off to London yesterday, I determine to set off for Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> on Thursday morning; I shall be there on Friday.</p>
<p>It must be owned, My dear Brother, this is a confused enough piece of business, and described with equal perplexity. Nevertheless, you will not fail to make the best of my scrawl&#x2014;which I write after dinner (when I am always sickest) and in hourly expectation of the Post. If you cannot well be spared at present, write to me in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> without loss of time, and I will either go back with the horse, or bring it down to you myself, or send it by Frank Dickson, who is to meet me in the City. Jack&#x2019;s Lodgings you know are at 35. Bristo-street. If you come in person, you must travel by the Coach. Your best plan is to mount early on Saturday morning, and overtake the vehicle at Moffatt: you will get in by that means for twelve or thirteen shillings&#x2014;for which I shall gladly be in your debt.

<salute>My dear Jack,</salute>
<p>After considerable higgling and hesitation, I have at last resolved to write to you announcing the day of my arrival, that you may try to get some accommodation made ready for me, against that event. I am so pressed with want of time, that I must keep by the strict matter in hand and nothing more. This is of less consequence, as you are very soon to see me.</p>
<p>I am to set off from this place on Thursday morning:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >He is writing on Tuesday.</note> I shall be with you on Friday night, most probably some time after the close of day. I purpose at least partly purpose staying with the &#x201C;speculative skite,&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >This seems to be Will Bretton. A &#x201C;skite&#x201D; is a nasty or ugly fellow.</note> on my first night; and his place is forty good miles (including a ferry) from your city. <hi rend="italic">Any</hi> clean and quiet bed-room will do for me; I shall need nothing more, but a clean shirt and neckcloth or two, which you will very easily contrive to supply me with.</p>
<p>You will find me, Jack, a poor heart-worn irritable atrabiliar as melancholy as a cat in rainy weather, and nearly as yellow as saffron. Alick I have just been commissioning to come up for the pony. When we are all three together, we must straitly advise what is best to be done: for it seems very possible that the day after to-morrow, I may take my <hi rend="italic">final</hi> leave of Kinnaird. In fact I am to consult Geo: Bell surgeon, and shape my course accordingly. I suppose he will &#x201C;throw mercury into the system&#x201D;:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;An incipient physician in Edinburgh had, as reported to Carlyle by Frank Dixon, ordered a patient to &#x2018;throw vegetable in the system&#x2019;&#x201D; (Norton&#x2019;s note).</note> I fear the system will not care a doit about all his mercury. At all events, I <hi rend="italic">must</hi> be rid of this horrible condition of body: it absolutely torments me till my soul is dark as the pit of Tophet. I have had no good sleep for above a week. Judge ye in what a pleasing frame of mind I am!</p>
<p>Frank Dickson is to meet me in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>: he may perhaps call before I arrive; you will tell him how it is. I have finished the &#x201C;Life Part II.&#x201D; and sent it off to London: the last <hi rend="italic">Part</hi> I shall not meddle with till I am settled somewhere. If I were well, how I could dash it off! When ill, how I hang upon it!</p>
<p>I am glad you have taken Duncan<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Duncan Church. John shared rooms with him.</note> (to whom my compliments); <pb id="pg-02-480" n="02:480"/>it is not meet for man to be alone. &#x201C;One loves company, &#x201D; says the German, &#x201C;tho&#x2019; it were but the company of a burning tallow candle.&#x201D; Any letters &#x26;c for me you do well to keep. Be of good cheer, Jack! Let us depend on one another: <foreign><hi rend="italic">einst werden wir triumphiren</hi></foreign> [one day we will triumph]!</p>
<p>The post is here. Good night my kind Doil!</p>

<salute>Dearest Friend</salute>
<p>Thank God they are all away and I have time to draw my breath! Such a week of it I have had! dressing and showing lions, and making myself agreeable&#x2014; I declare I am as fag<supplied>[g]</supplied>ed as if I were come off a journey of several hundred miles&#x2014;(according to Mr<hi rend="italic">s</hi> Montagues recipe) I should be &#x201C;stretching myself on a sofa and endeavouring to forget every thing in existence&#x201D; instead of presentin<supplied>[g]</supplied> myself before that <hi rend="italic">one</hi> in existence in whose eyes I like worst to appear insipid but I know your surprising talent of forecasting evil, and that you will be believing me a dead woman if I delay any longer to assure you of my existence.</p>
<p>Heaven bless you for your kind solicitude about my health &#x26; happiness&#x2014;it is precious to me above every thing in life. As long as my welfare is dear to one such heart, I cannot <hi rend="italic">despond</hi>, cannot be altogether uninteresting to myself; useless though I be in the world, and loved or cared for by almost none&#x2014; Do not vex yourself about my illness&#x2014; I would not have mentioned it, had I thought you should take it so seriously to heart&#x2014; I am quite recovered; indeed there was little at all the matter with me; but I am so unused to sickness, that I take with it very impatiently, and make a great outcry when I have little to cry out about. Moreover do not say another word to me of taking care of myself&#x2014; I <hi rend="italic">do</hi> take care, the greatest possible care&#x2014; D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Fyffe takes care of me also&#x2014; This smallest of M.D.s likes me as well as you do, in his own way, and would sooner all the rest of his patients were carried off at one fell swoop,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Macbeth</hi>, IV, iii.</note> than that I should look yellow, or be translated&#x2014; At his desire I am half drowning myself in cold water <pb id="pg-02-481" n="02:481"/>every morning, eating beef, beef and nothing but beef (I am sure I have eat a cow within the last fortnight) and walking two hours before dinner every day; and with all this water and beef and exercise, I am to be as strong as a lion, it seems, in a month&#x2019;s time&#x2014;</p>
<p>And then <hi rend="italic">your</hi> visit! <hi rend="italic">that</hi>, I expect will do more for me than all my Physician&#x2019;s prescriptions. I have said nothing about it to my Mother as yet, nor shall till you have fixed the time.

<salute>My dearest Jane,</salute>
<p>Your letter met me on my way hither; the old Sack of a Postman gave it me out from his wallets, among the rocky defiles of the Tay. You are an Angel to me, if there ever was one: such letters are beyond what I deserved even to hope for.</p>
<p>The business now in hand is <hi rend="italic">when</hi> am I to see you? I have a sharp-tempered horse that will carry me out and back, whenever you send me a <hi rend="italic">safe conduct</hi>? I have much, very much to say and hear; I feel almost afraid of this interview from which at the same time I expect so much delight. You must try to get it all settled rightly, and let me know as soon as possible. You are aware of how wonderful a stock of patience I have; therefore you will not keep me waiting. I arrived last night, am to stay about a week, and have no engagement that I will not give to the winds for the sake of <hi rend="italic">ours</hi>. Order me me [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] therefore according to your own good pleasure.</p>
<p>It will be the cruellest thing your Mother ever did if she make objections to our meeting. Two honest-meaning very respectable creatures that have scarce another friend on the face of the Earth! Nevertheless if she act <hi rend="italic">perversely</hi>, it is ours to submit. Do not quarrel about this, My own best Jane! I will love you thro&#x2019; all Eternity tho&#x2019; I should never see you more. But we <hi rend="italic">will</hi> meet before all is done; we will; I have sworn it a hundred times. If I did not think so, I should feel inclined to run <hi rend="italic">amuck</hi> at this very instant. Therefore do you lovely <hi rend="italic">Damsel of the many devices</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-02/lt-18230510-JBW-TC-01">JBW to TC, <date when="1823-05-10">10 May</date></ref>.</note> see to put your skill in force on this occasion; and manage matters with the dexterity you have always shewn; remembering how long long it is since we have met, and how much need there is that we meet soon. I shall wait with all the patience in the world, for your news. Shall I hear from you on Monday? I know I shall, the first moment you have time.</p>
<p>I meant this letter to have been of even more than usual length; and behold you can hardly gather one idea from it, or even make out <pb id="pg-02-483" n="02:483"/>the few scattered words that compose it. Stupid persons have been about all the blessed day: I have only saved ten minutes (by escaping into another room) before the last of the Coaches sets off. You will understand what I mean, and that is all we need. I care not what I write to you, you are my <hi rend="italic">other self</hi>.</p>
<p>Here is the orator&#x2019;s trial<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A fictitious <hi rend="italic">Trial of the Rev. Edward Irving, M.A. A Cento of Criticism</hi> (London, <date when="1823-00-00">1823</date>), which satirizes supposed witnesses against Irving, including the editor of the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> and Cobbett, as well as Irving himself. The frontispiece shows five caricatures of him preaching; the indictment was on many counts, for being ugly, a merry-andrew, a common quack, a swearer, of common understanding, and for following &#x201C;divisive courses.&#x201D; See also Mrs. Margaret Oliphant, <hi rend="italic">Life of Irving</hi>, I, 169&#x2013;72. In the <hi rend="italic">CLO</hi>, the caricatures of Irving are viewable on the volume 4 table of contents page.</note> (a clever thing they say) to make you and your Mother laugh till bed-time&#x2014; Did you <hi rend="italic">ever</hi> see such faces? May the Devil take Irving&#x2019;s &#x201C;intellect&#x201D; and his &#x201C;youth&#x201D; both, for the trouble they have given you! He is one of the greatest Blockheads, with all his other qualities, that ever God made. But let the silly people say their say; their words break no bones, they pass, like the wind they are made of leaving no trace behind. &#x201C;Use <hi rend="italic">you</hi> ill!&#x201D;&#x2014; Now write immediately, directing hither. Heaven grant that you send good news! God bless you my own best Jane!</p>

<salute>My dear Jack,</salute>
<p>I daresay you are not without anxiety to learn how I wear since my new return to these Highland Hills; and the old drunken Kipper of a Post being <hi rend="italic">up</hi> to-day, I set about scribbling you a sheet against his arrival. My journey hither was not so convenient as I expected. Despite the asseverations of that swarthy Coach-clerk, whom indeed his very looks proclaimed to be a &#x201C;Turk in grain,&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A rascal through and through.</note> there was <hi rend="italic">no</hi> conveyance to Dunkeld that night, or (that the Guard knew of) the next morning. On learning this fact from the reluctant Redcoat at Newhaven, I could have flown into a considerable passion; and did once think of returning to summon the iniquitous clerk before the Court of Police, and making him account and suffer for his lies. But after two or three ejaculations of contempt and anger, I judged it <pb id="pg-02-485" n="02:485"/>better to smother my irritation, and proceed in my pilgrimage. It was in itself but uncomfortable: we waited long for the boat; then the passage being stormy and the people all puking round me, I got queasy in the stomach, and did not feel well all day. However I got mutton chops at the Bridge of Earn with the &#x201C;speculative skite,&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Will Bretton.</note> then coffee at the Hammermen&#x2019;s Tavern in Perth, where I slept not uncomfortably till six next morning, and then set off gaily with the Dunkeld Post, a <foreign><hi rend="italic">weazened</hi></foreign> <foreign>snuffy</foreign> drunken sinner, who allowed me half of his gigg for the sum of three shillings. The great coats kept me warm, and the morning was not bad: I arrived here very pleasantly about noon. They were all glad and cheerful at sight of me: I unpacked my articles; sat down by my own fire-side, and at night, all things were as they had been.</p>
<p>Since my return nothing singular has happened: I go croaking about with about the usual quantity of sickness to suffer, and the usual quantity of impatience to endure it with. For the first few days I was better; I had three whole nights of sleep. But on Sunday night, I swallowed some more of that delightful mercury; and with the usual effect. Enough of this abominable subject! Would to God I might never more have to tell any man whether I am well or ill! I have not tasted the slightest morsel of tobacco; but whether this does me any good I cannot yet positively say. I rather think it beneficial: I shall try for five or six weeks more; and then persist in abstinence, or return like the dog to his vomit. There is more pleasure in poor <foreign>nicotium</foreign> than in all the wines and sumptuous liquours that grace the boards of the rich.</p>
<p>It is but two months that we have to abide here; so I may easily enough put up with it. Philosophy, I believe, enjoins us never to complain: in this instance I shall try to obey her. Ill health is all I have to suffer; the most tremendous curse which God can afflict a creature with; but one which is not new to me, which I now should be growing used to, since it is like to be my mate thro&#x2019; life. Kinnaird is not more unpleasant than other places are at this melancholy season. We had snow for three days last week; then a sort of frost, and to-day it is rain and has already melted all the ice and snow away. Every day I have ventured out and had a long walk. Patience! Patience!</p>
<p>To-day, the Proofsheet of Schiller came to hand: the thing fills above two and twenty pages; and seems very weak. If Providence <pb id="pg-02-486" n="02:486"/>ever give me back my health I shall write very greatly better; if not, not. To-morrow I correct the thing, and send it down again. The third Part is <hi rend="italic">not begun yet</hi>! I have only been reading Wallenstein: I mean to begin it in two days positively. If it were done, I shall have nothing to mind but Goethe, which is easy.</p>
<p>And now Jack after this full tho&#x2019; beggarly account of <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, it is fit that I should seek for some account of <hi rend="italic">thee</hi>, who art so patient as to listen without wincing to all this dreary pettiness. About this instant Duncan and you, &#x201C;it is pwobable,&#x201D; are on your way to M&#x2019;Kenzie. Well speed you, my brave Doil! You have only to keep your eyes open, to employ those substantial faculties which Nature has given you, and I predict that you will surely make a figure in the world, and do credit to us all. I can only give you one advice, which I have given a thousand times, but must ever be repeating. You already guess &#x201C;your health!&#x201D; It is even so: if this stand f<supplied>[irm]</supplied> you will conquer all; if it fail you, you will conquer very little. Do you still go out in the mornings? I recommend it as a very beneficial practice. Has Duncan recovered?</p>
<p>Tell me how you like Good,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Mason Good (<date when="1764-00-00">1764</date>&#x2013;<date when="1827-00-00">1827</date>), English physician and writer; translator of Lucretius&#x2019; <hi rend="italic">On the Nature of Things</hi>.</note> if you still continue his pupil; and how you get along with your general medical studies. I know it is dreary; and young men at your age vex themselves with many anxious thoughts which make things worse. But keep a heart Jack! Secure this <hi rend="italic">profession</hi> to make bread by means of: you will excel by many leagues all the Doctorkins that I know of, and receive encouragement proportionably. This is absolutely certain: it <hi rend="italic">must</hi> happen, at the long run, if yourself incline. And for the interim, take no thought at all. You see I can make cash to serve us both, and while the one has, the other has also. From any but a Brother, I would be stingy of taking favours: but <hi rend="italic">from</hi> a Brother, I would <hi rend="italic">demand</hi> the half of his last farthing if I needed it. O Jack! What is paltry money to the affection of a true heart! I would not give the love of my people in exchange for all the diamonds of Golconda.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Golconda, near Hyderabad, India, was a fortress where diamonds were cut, polished, and stored.</note> So we will stick together Jack as firm as the Roman fasces: what force shall be able to break us <hi rend="italic">all</hi>?&#x2014; But I must leave this.&#x2014; Are you reading any poetry or general literature? Tell me about it minutely: and ask me all the questions you can think of. Did you ever read Boswell&#x2019;s Life of Johnson? It is instructive and amusing. Scott&#x2019;s Dryden? or any of his works <pb id="pg-02-487" n="02:487"/>(they will not please you very much) or Ben Jonson or any of the &#x201C;older dramatists&#x201D;? Keep always reading something; if attentively, you cannot fail to be improving. I will send you down Schiller, and Hazzlitt ere long, and you can get yourself two others in their stead. I foolishly forgot to leave that Bank Receipt with you in case you should be needing money. If you should, of course you will let me know in a moment. I will try if a translation can be got for Summer: if not you must stay at the Infirmary (not as a patient), or set up house with me, or go to Cornwall or something grander. We shall all do well. But I must be off. Write directly. I am your true Brother, (I think on the whole I <hi rend="italic">am</hi> <supplied>[better]</supplied> since I came hither)<supplied>[.]</supplied></p>

<salute>My dear Johnston,</salute>
<p>If you ever think of me at all, you must have formed some strange conjectures lately about my walk and conversation. I should have written to you several weeks ago. Doubtless, however, you are now too old a correspondent to think such occurrences miraculous; or even to impute my silence to any blameable feeling,&#x2014;unless in a cynical mood you include among the list of crimes that amiable habit of indolence and ennui and dulness, which circumstances like mine are apt enough to engender. The truth is since I parted with you, I have been very much baited by sickness and business and stupidity; I have often thought of you, tho&#x2019; till now I have never been able to muster the little particle of resolution necessary for writing you a letter.</p>
<p>Perhaps I should hardly have ventured even now had it not been for anxiety to learn how it fares with you in your new situation. I need not say that I felt gratified at hearing of your settlement, so respectable and so opportune: I trust it more than realizes all your hopes. These I can gather from your letter were not of the most sanguine kind; indeed it is easy to perceive that such a place is not <pb id="pg-02-488" n="02:488"/>formed to content you: nevertheless it is a city of refuge in the mean while; you may save a few pounds in it; and be constantly on the outlook for some better and more permanent engagement, which you will then be in a case to undertake under far better auspices. I have no shadow of doubt that you will ultimately, and that ere long, be provided for according to your wish. The proportion between your qualities and your hopes assures me of this. You are gathering experience and getting knowledge and making friends. Did Irving ever write to you? He had some notable project in his head about setting you into some school at Haddington; which I had little faith in. Of course he will <hi rend="italic">not</hi> have written: he writes to none. Tell me, by the first opportunity, how all things are going with you in the General&#x2019;s.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >General M&#x2019;Kenzie of Broughty Ferry, whose children Johnston was to tutor for 60 pounds a year.</note> Stupid boys are a dreadful curse; and foolish mothers often make it worse: there is no remedy but <hi rend="italic">patience</hi>&#x2014;the moral panacea, <hi rend="italic">patience</hi>; let things take their train without struggling too fiercely against them, you will find it best. There is a text, not quite scriptural, but which suits you exactly in its purport. A minister in the Middlebie pulpit was attempting to preach upon these words: &#x201C;He that is unholy, let him be unholy still.&#x201D; The poor man as you know perhaps could do nothing but repeat and rerepeat the verse, <hi rend="italic">He that is un&#x26;c</hi>, having totally forgotten the beginning of his sermon. An upland Proprietor listened to him with increasing impatience reiterating the words; till at length another <hi rend="italic">he that is unholy</hi> drove the worthy <foreign>Laird</foreign> out of all composure; he started up, squeezed on his hat, and stalked gruffly along the passage muttering: &#x201C;He that is a confounded Jackass let him be a Jackass still&#x201D;!&#x2014; There is much truth in that prayer, much good sense.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-02/lt-18221030-TC-WG-01">TC to WG, <date when="1822-10-30">30 Oct. 1822</date></ref>.</note></p>
<p>I have been in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, since I saw you: I returned from it only ten days ago. The increasing pressure of Dyspepsia and discontent were afflicting me to such a degree that I came to the resolution of giving up my situation here, of retiring into Annandale and trying for six months by all means under heaven if health of body could not be regained: in the affirmative case, I should be the happiest man alive; in the negative, it was but to go distracted and take a dose of arsenic and so be done with it. The people of the house advised me that it would be better to consult a Doctor; they seemed also to think it would be using them rather scurvily if I went away at this season. <pb id="pg-02-489" n="02:489"/>I accordingly delivered my introductory letter to George Bell,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-02/lt-18231125-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1823-11-25">25 Nov.</date></ref></note> who examined me and prescribed to me <foreign><hi rend="italic">secundum artem</hi></foreign> [according to his art]. He has given me mercury and solemnly commanded me to abstain from tobacco in all its shapes. <hi rend="italic">Snuff</hi> he says is as pernicious as any other way of it. Do you mark that Master Brook?<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <hi rend="italic">The Merry Wives of Windsor</hi>, V, i.</note> I have tasted no morsel of the weed for nearly three weeks. On the whole I cannot say that I am perceptibly better; <supplied>[yet]</supplied> I have returned hither, to stay with the worthy people till the end of <date when="1824-02-00">February</date>, when they leave the place for Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, and thence for London. Whether I shall accompany them must depend on the state of my &#x201C;outward fellow,&#x201D; and several other circumstances. In the mean time I exercise no small philosophy. The aspect of things is dreary and dull; it is all one can do at present to keep from dying of the spleen. These wild moors are white as Millers; the roads are ancle-deep with half-melted snow; the very Celts are going about with livid noses and a drop at the end&#x2014;the picture of cold and destitution. I read nonsensical books and talk insipidities and walk to and fro with a great coat, galoches and a huge hairy-cap. I ought likewise to be busy: but Satan is in me; I cannot work a stroke. The <hi rend="italic">second</hi> Part of Schiller is printed, yet I cannot for my heart begin the third. This will never do.</p>
<p>Brother Sandy was in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, meeting me to take down the horse. He had little that was new to report from Annandale: Parliament Geordy<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-01/lt-18210110-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1821-01-10">10 Jan. 1821</date></ref>.</note> he met a<supplied>[s]</supplied> he was returning in a sleety day beside Tweedshaws. Parliament was flying to <supplied>[the]</supplied> North to avoid the destroying Angel, the Constable snatching at him for debt. It is some <supplied>[scheme?]</supplied>, I understand, in which he had engaged himself for Calvert and a number of others joined in a sort of copartnery for borrowing money from the Bank. Calvert is now in Annan jail. I am sorry for Parliament; tho&#x2019; he is a littleworth. How would you or I do if we could no longer keep the crown of the causeway? Let us never complain. Jack had a letter from you, which he meditates answering: he is at present staying with Duncan Church; their address is <hi rend="italic">Mrs Robertson&#x2019;s, 35. Bristo-street</hi>. They are diligently studying medicine, and reading poetry and general literature. Duncan poor fellow was not well&#x2014;troubled with that infernal business, diseased digestion. If ever I get rich I will institute a hospital for <foreign><hi rend="italic">cacochymous</hi></foreign> [cacochymic] patients specially: there shall be nurses and leeches to watch over them for twelve months each; after which, if no cure appear, there shall <pb id="pg-02-490" n="02:490"/>be a fund of Prussic acid, and other necessaries to put them out of pain. I found a letter lying for me at Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> from Kirkchrist: they asked very kindly after you. There was also a short and shallow epistle from Mitchell, who seems to be going on in the usual mediocre style, smothering a fair allowance of uneasiness and discontent under the dictates of worldly wisdom sanctioned by a decent modicum of every day enjoyment. Mitchell has no warm heart; otherwise he is a worthy man.</p>
<p>The &#x201C;Literary news&#x201D; of Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> were of very small account. Blackwood&#x2019;s Magazine is said to be going down; the sale is lessening I hear; and certainly the contents are growing more and more insipid. I hope yet to see it dead: it is a disgrace to the age and country. Talent joined with moral baseness is at all times painful to contemplate.

<salute>My dear Jane,</salute>
<p>I have been in such a weak insipid humour ever since I left Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, that till now I could not determine to afflict you with my dulness. The oxide of mercury and the devil and the storms of winter and the ill nature of my own heart are all against me: it requires a degree of philosophy scarcely inferior to that of Epictetus himself to keep from dying of the spleen. I hope it is better with you in Haddington; but here it is dreariness itself. There is a day of piercing frost, then a day of snow, then three days of sleety vapour; and then we begin our <pb id="pg-02-491" n="02:491"/>cycle as before. I declare it is quite tempting to go abroad: you wade to the ancles in half melted snow, with a drizzling fog overshadowing the whole universe, or a howling tempest of drift and snow and whirlwind coming roaring thro&#x2019; the pass of Killiecrankie, as if the very genius of Winter were riding on the blast. Except Buller and I (condemned men) no mortal stirs abroad: it is true you here and there meet with some ancient weatherbeaten smuggler beating up against the storm, on the outside of his <foreign><hi rend="italic">garron</hi></foreign> [broken-down horse or pony], with two kegs of whisky, and a truss of straw by way of saddle, &#x2014;his face of a mahogany colour, and whiskers jingling with a load of frozen sleet; but it is <hi rend="italic">his</hi> element, you cannot say he is <hi rend="italic">abroad</hi>. Oh it is a delicious season of the year; and then the place affords so many special recreations! I read nonsensical books, being unable either to think or write; I walk to and fro, muffled up in a thick great coat, with galoches and a huge hairy cap; I talk ineptitudes with the people, and <hi rend="italic">drive</hi> away the time till <date when="1824-02-00">February</date> come, as best I may. It is essential to my comfort that I smother all sparkles of ambition within me: if I looked beyond the present quarter of a year, or attempted any thing more than merely existing I should be completely wretched. It appears to me that rest were well exchanged for fame at any time. What matters it that one is stupid and ignorant and void of genius, so one had but peace and rest, and could say to his soul: Soul take thine ease, thou hast goods laid up for many years!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Luke 12:19.</note> I maintain that you and I are far too ambitious: one of the first steps in our improvement will surely be the diminution of that feeling. If we are ever to be happy, it must be so<supplied>[.]</supplied></p>
<p>I do not recollect that I ever thought more, or more anxiously, about you than since we parted last. It still seems to my alarmed imagination that the crisis of our fate is at hand, that we are to be dashed asunder by the strong arms of Destiny, and driven ere long into everlasting separation. In fact it is clear enough that things cannot stand as they are. For me I have long looked on pitiful Misery as my companion for life; there is little hope of my recovering even health, and without this the sceptre of the universe were not worth a pin. So I have laid my account with endurance and a perpetual train of despicable suffering&#x2014;till the end&#x2014;which is not very distant. But for you, with such advantages and such aims, it is infinitely harder that you are unhappy. My late visit has convinced me too well that this is the case with you: would that the remedy were equally plain! No, my <pb id="pg-02-492" n="02:492"/>dearest friend, you are not happy: indeed how could you be so? What communion has light with darkness; or you with the inane people your lot is cast among? You are encircled with drivelling and folly; nothing that your mind can relish or care for; companionless, tho&#x2019; your heart is full of warm affections: you have sacrificed all for the sake of your improvement, yet you are obstructed almost stopped in your progress towards it. <closer><salute>My dearest Jane!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A.

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Tho&#x2019; it is not long since you heard from me both by letter and by Alick&#x2019;s verbal report, I have taken it into my head to-night to send you some farther intelligence, well knowing that in your ever-watchful anxiety for my welfare you will receive with pleasure any account of my condition and proceedings. Now what will you bet that I am better or worse? I will tell you without farther parley that I think myself rather better on the whole, certainly at least no worse. The weather is so abominable and all things here so unfavourable for a sick person, that I think keeping stationary no bad work. I have been continually taking drugs, yet I am not weaker or more spiritless than I was; and what is a treasure beyond all things to me, I sleep every night in my bed like a decent Christian, and do not lie tumbling and tossing thro&#x2019; all the hours of darkness like a fiend. If the good weather were come again I think I shall recover: at present I study to keep as patient as possible, and wait for better days.</p>
<p>Now, My dear Mother, how is it with yourself in these wild storms? I know you are very far from well; and you can far less get yourself attended to than even I. Do send me some account of how you are; even an unfavourable one were better than none; for often one&#x2019;s imagination shapes things worse than the worst reality. I hope yet that both your health and mine will be completely reestablished, and we shall see each other happy as we ought to be. This would certainly be the case, could we get ourselves properly managed. Would you <pb id="pg-02-493" n="02:493"/>come and keep my <hi rend="italic">cottage</hi>? I am afraid you durst not venture so far as Cornwall; otherwise I think it might be very fine. You and Mary would keep every thing like a new pin for me, and we should all be as snug as possible together. Whether I go to Cornwall or not, something of this sort might nay must be arranged; for I am weary of living on strange hearths, and if my affairs were set in any order I need not do it. Had I conveniences about me for writing I might earn far more than I do at present: if my health were restored, I could almost undertake to grow rich by doing so. There is the second Part of Schiller, which I was correcting the other night: it is worth beyond twenty guineas; yet it was written in such dreary circumstances as you can hardly conceive: I used to begin it about six o&#x2019;clock at night&#x2014;broken, wasted and done: I have little hesitation in saying I could have done it all in two weeks had my hands been free. By and by we must have all that settled; and then things will go rarely. You will smoke your pipe and make tea and regulate every thing for me: I shall write in a special apartment; and we shall be as healthy and cheerful as crickets.</p>
<p>In the mean time I am waiting for <date when="1824-02-00">February</date> when I go to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> to get the German Book printed. The third Part of Schiller is yet to <hi rend="italic">begin</hi>: but I am so <foreign><hi rend="italic">feckless</hi></foreign> at present that I have never yet had the heart to commence it. It <hi rend="italic">must</hi> be done ere long. I spend my evenings mostly in reading, and always about eight o&#x2019;clock I go into the good people and have one cup of tea with them, and an hour or more of small talk, which lightens the tedium of solitude and makes the night go faster away. It is a sad thing to have to study how to <hi rend="italic">drive the night away</hi>; a thing which till now I never had occasion to practice: but at present I am reduced to it; it is the best thing I can do. This medicine is a searching business: it leaves me often almost free of pain, but very very weak. I still have not tasted tobacco in any shape for three weeks: but whether this abstinence does me any good or not I cannot undertake to say. I do not find that it is difficult to give up the practice: never seeing a glimpse of it from week to week, it seldom comes into my head. If I could be sure that it was for my health I would never take it again while I lived.</p>
<p>I expect to be down and see you all sometime in spring, whether I go with these people to the south or not. If I had got them set on printing the Book, I might almost come down to Mainhill and stay while it was printing: I cannot tell you how I like Mainhill: the healthiest days I have had have been there; and the true affection which <pb id="pg-02-494" n="02:494"/>you have all shewn me makes the place and all that it holds forever dear to me. My dear Mother! it is certainly yet in store for me to repay you this kindness; I shall be very discontented with my lot if it be not. There is a value in true affection, which all the gold of the Indies cannot equal. I often think we have much reason amid all our sufferings to thank merciful Providence that spares us all in the land of the living to comfort and support each other. Many people like me are without father or mother, sister or brother: and I have all these preserved to love me and make the world warm around me. In truth we ought to be thankful.</p>
<p>But my hour is run, the Post will be down in ten minutes, perhaps earlier and he will not wait. I wish you would write me a little note in the tail of some of Alicks: surely you must be in want of something; it is very stingy of you not to let me know. I solemnly assure you, you cannot do me a greater pleasure than shew me how to serve you. Tell Alick that I long for his letter; let him write whatever comes uppermost. My Father was also to write: how is he standing the storm? I know not how it is with you; but here it is the ugliest weather I ever saw. There is a day of keen frost, then one of snow, then three of sleet and vapour. Sometimes there is a wind roaring like the bellows of a furnace: it is sometimes very bad. Nevertheless I make head against it wonderfully: I have got a pair of galoches made, I have a great coat, and I wear a great fur-cap of Bullers: Every day I venture out to walk. Add to this, I put on fires of the most liberal sort, having peats and coals at my discretion. Often I feel quite <foreign><hi rend="italic">canty</hi></foreign>: I think if I had some of you with me, I should be as merry as were needful. I have in fact been in better spirits than I used to be ever since I came back. This mercury clears out the abominable bile out of one in such style as you never saw: it leaves you feeble and <foreign>coldrife</foreign> [susceptible to cold], but without any violent uneasiness anywhere; and the <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi> at night is worth pearls. I wish I had known this drug in summer when the weather was warmer&#x2014; But I must let you go for once. I see you all sitting round the fire in a half-ring at this very moment: supper is over, and you are driving on the time harmlessly till the hour of rest. May the Great Father bless every one of you! Give my truest love to all inclusive. Good night my dear Mother! <closer><salute>I am your&#x2019;s with warm affection,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Friend</salute>
<p>You never sent me a letter in your life that afforded me more satisfaction than your last. For a week I had been marvelling at your silence, and for the last two days of it I had been miserable outright. I do think there never was a brain so clever as mine in conceiving all possible calamities. One minute I fancied that I had lost your affection&#x2014;at least in part&#x2014;(and the conjecture looked likely enough; for you had seen me face to face, and must have found it no easy matter to recognise in my actual self, the superexcellent creature you had been picturing me among the hills of Perthshire.) and then I regre<supplied>[t]</supplied>ed that you had come hither at all, to be disturbed from an illusion so agreeable to us both; but presently the consciousness of my true affection for you reassured me on this head, it was impossible that you could cease to love one who loved you so faithfully and so well&#x2014;and the next minute I had fully persuaded myself that you were ill-God knows there was small comfort in that view of the matter&#x2014;the idea that you were dying, perhaps actually dead was like to drive me crazy altogether&#x2014; Mercy! what an ass I am&#x2014; The blue devils, it turns out, was all the matter!</p>
<p>The fates are against us my dearest Friend&#x2014; This truth grows plainer and plainer every day. <hi rend="italic">You</hi> however may fight it out to the end. You have a brave spirit in you, and nothing&#x2014;nothing but a premature death can prevent your being in the long run one of the brightest ornaments of the age we live in&#x2014;of this I am very sure&#x2014; But for <hi rend="italic">me</hi>! I have not force of mind to struggle through. <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;I have no genius&#x201D;</hi>&#x2014; I feel it&#x2014;my ambition will be born<supplied>[e]</supplied> down at last by the difficulties that oppose its gratification&#x2014;and when my ambition is no more what good reason will there be that I should occupy any room in our Creator&#x2019;s Universe&#x2014; Lord have mercy upon me! when I cease to be ambitious I am a ruined woman!&#x2014; I could not help smiling in bitterness of heart, when I found that your time had been spent, since we parted quite as unprofitably and unpleasantly as my own&#x2014; You left me more than ever bent on well-doing, more than ever prepared to kick to the Devil every obstacle that should withstand the lofty purposes of my will. In this proper mood I was set down to my books <pb id="pg-02-496" n="02:496"/>before you were a mile on the way to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>&#x2014; For two days I went on briskly at the appointed rate, on the third I was taken ill&#x2014;more seriously than I had been before, and almost ever since, I have been bundled up among blankets on a sofa, and constrained to follow M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Montagu&#x2019;s divine prescription<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-02/lt-18231126-JBW-TC-01">JBW to TC, <date when="1823-11-26">26 Nov.</date></ref></note>&#x2014; Oh the thumping pain in my head and feverish listlessness of mind that I have endured for these last three weeks I declare I was many times tempted to help myself to a doze of Arsenic when their detestable drugs and decoctions afforded me no relief&#x2014; But I am well now&#x2014;better than I have been for several months&#x2014; I fell asleep one day last week, and for eight and forty <supplied>[hours]</supplied> slept as soundly as the enchanted Princess in in [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] the story book&#x2014; When I came to myself I was quit<supplied>[e]</supplied> another creature&#x2014; I mean to devote the remainder of this year to the recovery of my strength, and to set to work in good earnest on the <date when="1824-01-01">first of January</date>&#x2014;</p>

I assure you it shall not be my fault if I fail to conciliate her goodwill&#x2014; to live without it, as I was living, would in a very short time break my heart.

Tho&#x2019; you recommend it to me to make concessions I am afraid you will hardly thank me for making this one&#x2014;but it must be so&#x2014; I cannot help it without casting matters back to where they were&#x2014;as long as there was no confidence in my Mother&#x2019;s treatment of me, it passed well enough&#x2014;the secret which I made of your letters looked merely like retaliation. But at present the case is quite different and such a reserve on my part would break very awkwardly in on* my confidential conduct in other respects and give rise to suspicions which it is neither for your credit nor mine that she should entertain&#x2014; Besides, after all, it cannot prove any hardship to you or me that my Mother should see your letters as long as she continues in this benign humour.

She even laughed heartily at your Mother&#x2019;s projected trip to Cornwal<supplied>[l]</supplied>&#x2014;and after <hi rend="italic">that</hi> what have we to fear?&#x2014; indeed I should not have told you my intention at all&#x2014;but have put into execution without making any words about the matter, only that I dreaded lest by alluding to herself you might place me again in a very awkward predicament&#x2014; I cannot write another line&#x2014; I never was so tired in my life&#x2014; God bless you my dearest Friend&#x2014; <closer><salute>Yours for ever and ever</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My Dear Carlyle</salute>
<p>I am here, my Father and two brothers-in law, and I expect my two brothers from the nest so we shall be a jolly company&#x2014;here in the room where in days of old we have handled so many questions with the <foreign>gudsire</foreign> of Kirkcaldy.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Irving had known Carlyle well during the latter&#x2019;s residence in Kirkcaldy as schoolmaster in <date when="1816-00-00">1816</date>&#x2013;<date when="1818-00-00">18</date>. The &#x201C;<foreign>gudsire</foreign>,&#x201D; Irving&#x2019;s future father-in-law, was Rev. John Martin (<date when="1769-00-00">1769</date>&#x2013;<date when="1837-00-00">1837</date>). Carlyle and Irving had been frequent visitors at the Manse. See <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi>, intr. Ian Campbell (London, <date when="1972-00-00">1972</date>), p. 194, and <ref target="volume-01/lt-18170212-TC-RM-01"><sic>1:92</sic><corr>TC to RM, <date when="1817-02-12">12 Feb. 1817</date></corr></ref>, <ref target="volume-02/lt-18230928-TC-MAC-01"><sic>2:441&#x2013;9</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1823-09-28">28 Sept. 1823</date></corr></ref>.</note> And among the other notables of the place I have been shewing my worthy Father the place where Thomas Carlyle lived,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle had lodged at Mrs. Skene&#x2019;s, Kirk Wynd (now demolished).</note> and where would be found the ghosts of more departed good sense than in any other place in this Kingdom. For there his hopeful son and the wittiest of men were wont to discourse of all things written &#x26; unwritten, thought of and unthought of. These our happy communings I propose to revoke from oblivion if you be as willing as I am and as able as you are wont to be. For I purpose, having gained my wife&#x2019;s most willing consent to be at Dunkeld on Thursday, I think to breakfast or soon after it, and to pass the time with you till the Monday following.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Irving was to be married on <date when="1823-10-13">Monday 13 Oct.</date>, and with his new wife (Mr Martin&#x2019;s daughter Isabella) proposed to visit in Dunkeld his friends the Bullers, whom he had met in London and influenced to employ Carlyle as tutor to their sons. The Bullers had taken Carlyle with them to their summer residence, Kinnaird House, on the road between Dunkeld and Pitlochry. See <ref target="volume-02/lt-18220112-TC-JCE-01"><sic>2:4&#x2013;5</sic><corr>TC to JCE, <date when="1822-01-12">12 Jan. 1822</date></corr></ref>.</note> But further than an exchange of visits perhaps, to M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Buller, I propose nothing, being resolved to devote myself for these days to the best friend I have in these parts. I think we may lay many plans useful to us both, and if I can get you to consent to a Summer&#x2019;s visit to us in London,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle was to be in London, at Irving&#x2019;s instigation, from <date when="1824-06-00">June 1824</date> (though with breaks) till <date when="1825-02-00">Feb. 1825</date>.</note> I doubt nothing of your speedily finding your way to the level in the Society to which your genius drives you in spite of yourself, and which I hope to see it long adorn. Be it understood therefore that, if you can accomplish it, we pass the greater part of Thursday Friday &#x26; Saturday and Sabbath together&#x2014;and after if you will join us and complete our tour by Paisly to Annan, you cannot conceive what a blessing we would account it, and I take it it would be a blessing to yourself.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle did not accompany the Irvings on their honeymoon, though the suggestion from Irving may perhaps explain Carlyle&#x2019;s similar suggestion to Jane that they have his brother John for company on part of <hi rend="italic">their</hi> honeymoon in <date when="1826-00-00">1826</date>&#x2014;a suggestion Jane firmly vetoed.

In his letter to his brother John of <ref target="volume-02/lt-18231020-TC-JAC-01"><date when="1823-10-20">20 Oct.</date></ref> Carlyle describes the visit the Irvings made at Dunkeld.</note></p>
<p>My Dear Carlyle I did not know how much you esteemed me, until I witnessed how for my sake, you subdued your natural feelings when I put them to such a test by my seeming neglect last summer but truly my excessive occupation [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>].<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The summer of <date when="1822-00-00">1822</date> Irving spent setting into his new charge at Hatton Garden, London; he soon became a celebrity, and had little time for letter-writing. Carlyle at this time was rapidly becoming very close to Jane, and in this way the previously close friendship of the two men had been weakening.</note> Nor did I know how much I loved you till I came to Edn and found you my former companion, and friend absent, and no one who had any power to move or to console my mind. I feel assured that nothing shall divide us till death, and that we may help each other most mightily in our passage to what is high &#x26; honourable, as surely you have helped me already.</p>
<p>There arise before me in dim perspective many visions of happiness to us both and to some others in whom we are dearly interested, but I dare not cast these into shape much more give them utterance. You cannot be more happy to meet me than I am to meet you. And we shall not be the less delighted that Isabella whom I love and you highly regard should be our only audience. The Annandale men delight at your very name.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Referring not only to the gathering in Kirkcaldy Manse, but to Carlyle&#x2019;s friends still in Annan and Dumfries, where Irving had just been.</note> There is one sentiment over all their rude minds that you are formed for strange and wonderful things tho they consider a fellow that will not heed to any thing, but drive on some hope to greatness and goodness, most prone to misery and ruin. Nevertheless my faith standeth sure. And I know in whom I have believed. And never of my destinies did I feel more secure than at this moment when I write. Our purpose is to be at Perth on Wednesday by the Steamboat.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >From Kirkcaldy the Irvings could either have travelled by land to Perth and there crossed the Tay, or they could have gone round the coast of Fife by steamboat and sailed up the Tay estuary past Dundee to Perth, then a busy inland harbour. Carlyle told his brother on <date when="1823-10-20">20 Oct.</date> (see <ref target="volume-02/lt-18230220-TC-JAC-01"><sic>2:455</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1823-02-20">20 Feb.</date></corr></ref>) that he had gone to Broughty Ferry, near Dundee, on <date when="1823-10-13">13 Oct.</date> to intercept the Irvings, and to visit his student friend James Johnston. For some reason he did not follow Irving&#x2019;s suggestion of meeting him on Wednesday in Perth, but instead met them in Dunkeld on the <date when="1823-10-16">16th</date>, and stayed overnight with them in an inn, since the Bullers had returned to Kinnaird House on the same day from their holidays. Carlyle visited Kinnaird briefly on Friday the <date when="1823-10-17">17th</date>, and returned with the Irvings on Saturday the <date when="1823-10-18">18th</date>. They left again that evening and stayed Saturday night at Kenmore on Loch Tay; on Sunday they parted, and Carlyle returned to Kinnaird. &#x201C;We talked and debated,&#x201D; Carlyle told his brother John (<ref target="volume-02/lt-18231020-TC-JAC-01"><sic>2:456</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1823-10-20">20 Oct. 1823</date></corr></ref>), &#x201C;and the time went pleasantly along.&#x201D;</note> If you thought of riding to meet us&#x2014;how acceptable it would be. But in all this consult duty more than feeling. <closer><salute>And believe me</salute></closer></p>
