<p>The editors wish to express their continued acknowledgment and gratitude to individuals and institutions mentioned in previous volumes. There are others whose help deserves special mention in connection with the present volumes, and even some whose assistance will be chiefly felt in those yet to come. They include the Curators of Carlyle&#x2019;s House, Chelsea, and Carlyle&#x2019;s Birthplace, Ecclefechan; and the National Trust and National Trust for Scotland, the National Library of Scotland, Edinburgh University Library, and many public libraries, including the Ewart Library, Dumfries, and the central libraries of Liverpool and Manchester. Since the last set of volumes appeared in <date when="1990-00-00">1990</date>, special thanks are due to the University of Edinburgh Appeal at a time of particular difficulty, the American Friends of Edinburgh University, the Robert Lorimer Foundation, the Leverhulme Trust, the British Academy, Edinburgh University Faculty of Arts, Professors R. D. S. Jack and Ian Donaldson, Emeritus Professor David Daiches, Graham Storey, Deric Bolton, Eluned Brown, Mrs. Virginia Surtees, Dr. Owen Dudley Edwards, Jules Seigel, and David Sorensen. Many others remain necessarily unnamed, but not forgotten, who have helped to make the work possible. We are also glad of the participation of Dr. Bill Bell of Edinburgh in editing the present set, and welcome him as assistant editor in future volumes. Grateful thanks are also rendered to the National Endowment for the Humanities for supporting the publication of these volumes.<pb id="lastpage-19-vii" n="19:vii"/></p>

<p>The present volumes contain 572 letters, of which 274, or over 47 percent, have not been previously published; of the rest, nearly half have appeared before only in incomplete form or as short quotations. Seventy-eight can be found, with some difficulty, in earlier volumes&#x2019; collections, and altogether 448 are by Thomas and 124 by Jane. In comparison with previous volumes a greater proportion is new, so that these volumes give an increasingly fresh opportunity to understand and interpret the Carlyles, their circle, and their times.</p>
<p>These letters cover a period when Thomas confessed that he had come through at last. He could tell his sister, &#x201C;These poor Books of mine &#x2026; have become a kind of <hi rend="italic">landed property</hi> to me, and yield a certain <hi rend="italic">rent</hi> more or less considerable every year&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-21/lt-18470507-TC-JCA-01">TC to JCA, <date when="1847-05-07">7 May 1847</date></ref>). New editions of the <hi rend="italic">Life of Schiller, Sartor, Heroes</hi>, and the <hi rend="italic">French Revolution</hi> were coming out; also, in the United States, another edition of the <hi rend="italic">Critical and Miscellaneous Essays</hi> and other authorized republications. Then, in <date when="1845-11-00">November 1845</date>, the first two-volume edition of <hi rend="italic">Oliver Cromwell&#x2019;s Letters and Speeches, with Elucidations</hi> was an unexpected success, followed by an expanded second edition, in three volumes, in <date when="1846-06-00">June 1846</date>.</p>
<p>Preparation and revision of <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> was demanding because of Carlyle&#x2019;s haste; he often relied on his friends and willingly accepted proffered aid. It was too hurried; once published, readers rushed to point out what had been overlooked, and Carlyle was exasperated to find it needed a thorough revision. It has not been clear before how far this went, how much he owed to various contributors, nor how faulty was the first edition, few copies of which survive. Many letters from readers and correspondents about <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> are now in the Yale University Library, along with some of Carlyle&#x2019;s working papers; and though we have not given the full story, they give a unique opportunity not only to see Carlyle at work but also the detailed methods and processes of a leading nineteenth-century historian. They show the practice as well as the theory of history.</p>
<p>It is not always reassuring. Carlyle&#x2019;s ideas on writing history or biography were partly given to his friend, the Rev. A. J. Scott: &#x201C;it is a <hi rend="italic">battle</hi> between the material and you. Do not aim at too much perfection&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-20/lt-18451205-TC-AJS-01">TC to AJS, <date when="1845-12-05">5 December 1845</date></ref>).<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Brief references are given to letters and their notes by correspondent and date, through which further details can be found, as well as by use of the index.</note> He had strong opinions about editing, its pedantry, obtrusiveness, <pb id="pg-19-x" n="19:x"/>and inaccuracy. The conflict between faithfulness to fact and to what he believed true&#x2014;&#x201C;what,&#x201D; he told Scott, &#x201C;you at last <hi rend="italic">have living</hi> in your own memory and heart&#x201D;&#x2014;is a conflict, a problem, and a working method throughout all Carlyle&#x2019;s histories. But, in spite of his exasperation at being forced into revision, the second edition is better than the first, and what was remarkable was that Carlyle&#x2019;s insight and controlling thought made it possible to repair <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> so that it held its place as a serious account long after his death.</p>
<p>Especially since his method often lay in conflict and confrontation, Carlyle often seems inconsistent when different phases of his career are brought together without distinction, but through seeking the truth in extremes and the clash of opposites he challenged his readers. Gavan Duffy understood him when he wrote that though he did not teach Duffy&#x2019;s young associates what to think, he &#x201C;confirmed their determination to think for themselves&#x201D; (Duffy 23). As well as this, Carlyle&#x2019;s own views and fundamental convictions were changing as we continue to see in his letters of this period. Carlyle tells Emerson on revising his own earlier works: &#x201C;It is really painful, looking at one&#x2019;s old face; said &#x2018;old face&#x2019; is no longer extant now!&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-20/lt-18460717-TC-RWE-01">TC to RWE, <date when="1846-07-17">17 July 1846</date></ref>). So though it is easy to construct intricate schemes of what Carlyle taught and meant, his letters often should force us to realize that he was a man of inconsistency, variety, and unexpectedness, an ironist consistent mainly in his challenging sincerity.</p>
<p>This is particularly true in religion. Close friends of Carlyle, such as the skeptical Erasmus Darwin or James Spedding, would tease him about what his religion really was. He was more skeptical than metaphysical. Part of his attraction for the inquiring Elizabeth Paulet and Geraldine Jewsbury lay in his constant but undogmatic concern with belief. On the other hand, the no-more-orthodox Edward FitzGerald still recoiled at times from his long tirades, such as the one he noted about bishops being &#x201C;stupid fetid animals in cauliflower wigs&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-20/lt-18460512-TC-WKB-01">TC to WKB, <date when="1846-05-05">5 May 1846</date></ref>). Yet a wide range of admirers&#x2014;headed by Emerson and including James Martineau, George Dawson, and a host of mainly unitarian Americans&#x2014;were drawn to Carlyle because they found his teaching liberating through its speaking to their inner experience. Skeptical as he was, Thomas could write to reassure Jane: &#x201C;As for the Redeemer,&#x2014;yes &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">the</hi> Redeemer liveth&#x2019; &#x2026; the Unnameable Maker of us, voiceless, formless within our own soul&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-20/lt-18460714-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1846-07-14">14 July 1846</date></ref>). The response of Emerson&#x2019;s friend Margaret Fuller, after meeting Carlyle, was that one had to have experienced Victorian England and &#x201C;stood in the shadow of that mountain of shams&#x201D; to appreciate the value of his explosive inconsistencies (<ref target="volume-21/lt-18461108-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1846-11-08">8 November 1846</date></ref>). She evidently felt like R. H. Horne, in his <hi rend="italic">A New Spirit of the Age</hi> (<date when="1844-00-00">1844</date>): that Carlyle had &#x201C;knocked out his window from the blind wall of his century.&#x201D; Harriet Martineau, again, <pb id="pg-19-xi" n="19:xi"/>could sharply disagree with Carlyle, but writes of him as &#x201C;the man who has most essentially modified the mind of his time&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-21/lt-18461116-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1846-11-16">16 November 1846</date></ref>). Henry David Thoreau finds in his writing an &#x201C;entire absence of cant and dogma&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-21/lt-18470518-TC-RWE-01">TC to RWE, <date when="1847-05-18">18 May 1847</date></ref>). Agreement in such tributes shows how forcibly Carlyle struck many contemporaries, and suggests that he was best understood by those who enjoyed his contradictions.</p>
<p>It is precisely a sense of these conflicting elements that sometimes comes from descriptions of the Carlyles that often give an unexpected view. We have drawn attention to these, thinking them often more illuminating than conventional correspondence. Margaret Fuller, again, sought them both out, willing to show respect but ready to strike a few sparks in her interview for the sake of her published travel sketches. For Emerson&#x2019;s sake Thomas submitted, little as he liked her generally optimistic and liberal attitudes, though he stuck to his guns on their last encounter when Mazzini was present in her support (<ref target="volume-21/lt-18461008-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1846-10-08">8 October</date></ref>, and <ref target="volume-21/lt-18461108-TC-JAC-01"><date when="1846-11-08">8 November 1846</date></ref>). Even so, she felt his &#x201C;charm&#x201D; and left &#x201C;with feelings of the warmest friendship and admiration&#x201D; for a &#x201C;great and noble nature.&#x201D; Jane she thought &#x201C;wise, sincere, accomplished,&#x201D; and &#x201C;entertaining,&#x201D; whereas Jane, we now discover, sent an account to the advanced Geraldine Jewsbury biting enough to draw the reply that she agreed in loathing Margaret Fuller &#x201C;heartily&#x201D; for her hypocrisy and &#x201C;theoretical profligacy. &#x2026; It does the heart and soul more harm than a course of blackguardism!&#x201D; (Ireland 215).</p>
<p>Gavan Duffy and his Young Irishmen felt the same attraction, some like John O&#x2019;Hagan (the future lord chancellor of Ireland) returning to Cheyne Row again and again; others, such as the revolutionary John Mitchel, who had to make the most of his single short visit to London and meeting with the Carlyles (not mentioned in the letters) on <date when="1846-05-14">14 May 1846</date>. He already &#x201C;venerated&#x201D; Carlyle, for leading him to believe in Irish independence, and never forgot the evening he spent with the Carlyles, during which Mitchel &#x201C;scarcely agreed with a single thing he said the whole night.&#x201D; Thomas&#x2019;s &#x201C;talk seemed like the speech of Paul or Chrysostom, and his presence and environment almost godlike.&#x201D; It is an extraordinary account. They remained deeply attached if sharply divided, each influenced by the other, though no letters from Carlyle to Mitchel survive (<ref target="volume-21/lt-18460823-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1846-08-23">23</date>&#x2013;<date when="1846-08-24">24 August 1846</date>]</ref>).</p>
<p>The letters must modify some ideas about Carlyle. In a long reply to Dr. Thomas Chalmers, for instance (<ref target="volume-21/lt-18470220-TC-TCH-01">TC to TCH, <date when="1847-02-20">20 February 1847</date></ref>), although we have to allow for its being the polite expression of his liking for Chalmers as a fellow-Scot and &#x201C;a <hi rend="italic">good</hi> and really pious-hearted and beautiful &#x2026; old man&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-21/lt-18470521-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1847-05-21">21 May 1847</date></ref>), we find Carlyle cheerfully uncompromising in accepting criticism of his former &#x201C;Germanism,&#x201D; ready to <pb id="pg-19-xii" n="19:xii"/>declare against &#x201C;all Metaphysics and Mental Philosophy&#x201D; in favor of looking out, &#x201C;as an <hi rend="italic">eye</hi> should, over the Universe which is not we.&#x201D; In a similarly gentle vein, he replies to F. D. Maurice&#x2019;s presentation of his lectures on <hi rend="italic">The Religions of the World</hi>, with its surprising prefatory tribute, both perfectly aware of their divisions but mutually respecting their deep concern with the same issues (<ref target="volume-21/lt-18470108-TC-FDM-01">TC to FDM, <date when="1847-01-08">8 January 1847</date></ref>). These letters are new (to most of us), though not perhaps one to his friend the sainted fellow-Scot Thomas Erskine, in which Carlyle declares of Christianity in their time that it is &#x201C;a paltry mealy-mouthed religion of cowards&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-21/lt-18470612-TC-TE-01">TC to TE, <date when="1847-06-12">12 June 1847</date></ref>); and yet he agrees with Caroline Fox in applauding Erskine&#x2019;s rejection of Calvinism, in company with associates such as J. McLeod Campbell. The time has passed for classifying Carlyle as a modified Calvinist tempered with &#x201C;Germanism.&#x201D; The letters show Carlyle responding to the times, as he leaves the seventeenth century and passes on to the period of the
<hi rend="italic">Latter-Day Pamphlets</hi> (<date when="1850-00-00">1850</date>); though he writes to his sister, &#x201C;It is with a kind of shudder I go to a new Book&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-21/lt-18461119-TC-JCA-01">TC to JCA, <date when="1846-11-19">19 November 1846</date></ref>).</p>
<p>He then sought a new subject, thinking to find it in Ireland. It was to preoccupy him almost as long as <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi>, with only a partial outcome in <hi rend="italic">Latter-Day Pamphlets</hi>. We see it growing in Carlyle&#x2019;s mind as he reads Duffy&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Nation</hi> and decides to visit Dublin, still haunted by accounts of the dark period of the famine: &#x201C;Ireland is a perpetual misery to me; lies like a kind of nightmare on my thoughts&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-21/lt-18470112-TC-EF-01">TC to EF, <date when="1847-01-12">12 January 1847</date></ref>). This is all clearer than before, and there is more to tell in the next few volumes, with the Irish rising of <date when="1848-00-00">1848</date> and the second visit in <date when="1849-00-00">1849</date>.</p>
<p>Thomas needs more explanatory comment than Jane because of the greater number of his letters, their detailed involvement with his published work, and his wider social and intellectual reach. Jane, it can be argued, speaks even more expressively for herself. Nor need we play off one against the other. Perhaps surprisingly, many who visited Cheyne Row, such as the level&#x2014;headed David Masson, found it peaceful and harmonious. He says of them at this time that their private &#x201C;demeanour&#x201D; was &#x201C;uniformly exemplary and loving in all essential respects,&#x201D; with the most admiring affection for him on her part &#x201C;in all that he said and did&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Memories of London in the &#x2018;Forties</hi> [<date when="1908-00-00">1908</date>] 53). Young Julia Paulet even writes to Jane about &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">mama</hi> who always thinks that you are some kind of angel married to some kind of god!&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-19/lt-18450928-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1845-09-28">28 Sept. 1845</date>]</ref>), while Jane herself complains that she hides her distress too well. If we had her despairing letters to Mazzini at the time of the crisis concerning Lady Harriet Baring, the picture would be different, but his replies merely suggest what she may have written: &#x201C;Your life proves an empty thing, you say?&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-20/lt-18460706-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, <date when="1846-07-06">6</date></ref>, and <ref target="volume-20/lt-18460715-JWC-TC-01"><date when="1846-07-15">15 July</date></ref>). It is not possible to find an objective standpoint from which to understand the full range of her changing feelings.</p>
<p><pb id="lastpage-19-xiii" n="19:xiii"/>The enigma of Lady Harriet remains, although we can now show that Jane discussed her with Geraldine Jewsbury, who shared the view that, &#x201C;not being brought up by a mother,&#x201D; Lady Harriet had been &#x201C;driven back within herself.&#x201D; She baffled them with her self-sufficiency. Perhaps, Geraldine fancied, Jane and Lady Harriet were not unalike, and she may have cared &#x201C;a great deal more for you than you suspect, and &#x2026; more too than accords with her general theory of things&#x201D; (Ireland 127, 197). Clearly Lady Harriet, with her good sense and regard for Thomas, refused to allow an antagonism to develop. Moreover, she was not the only member of the Ashburton-Baring family to delight in friendship with the &#x201C;dear old Prophet Carlyle,&#x201D; as she once called him, asking &#x201C;and has one any right to more than one such friend in a lifetime?&#x201D; (C. and F. Brookfield, <hi rend="italic">Mrs. Brookfield and Her Circle</hi> [<date when="1906-00-00">1906</date>] 2:382). Yet we may need to see more of the letters before trying to define their relationship. She evidently enjoyed exacting his homage, expressed in several almost burlesque letters, apparently like a few which made Froude call her &#x201C;an evil spirit&#x201D; (<date when="1881-06-12">12 June [1881?]</date>; MS: Marquess of Northampton) and perhaps drove Jane to require a suspense in their correspondence (<ref target="volume-20/lt-18460721-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, [<date when="1846-07-21">21 July 1846</date>]</ref>).</p>
<p>For the Carlyles loved letters, especially from the family, still more from each other; and we have to appreciate that it was not as a duty that, when he was away, Thomas asked for one from her nearly every day. Silence meant real distress, as in late <date when="1846-08-00">August 1846</date>; he even thought that it was used as a weapon against him; and Jane was even more desperate if she did not hear. On her birthday, after the Seaforth postmistress had twice denied having anything for her, she wrote: &#x201C;I wonder what <hi rend="italic">love&#x2014;letter</hi> was ever received with such thankfulness. &#x2026; I am as much broken to pieces by that little accident, as if I had come through an attack of cholera or
    brain fever&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-20/lt-18460714-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, <date when="1846-07-14">14 July 1846</date></ref>). In a lighter tone from Thomas: &#x201C;My Goody what in the world is the meaning of this? &#x2026; This morning no Letters at all&#x2014;<corr>&#x2014;</corr> Whew!&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-19/lt-18450917-TC-JWC-01"><sic><date when="1845-09-15">15 September 1845</date></sic><corr><date when="1845-09-17">17 September 1845</date></corr></ref>). Careless as she seems of her writing, Jane knew her value. Anna Montagu had said it should be her life&#x2014;mission &#x201C;to <hi rend="italic">write little notes</hi>&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-19/lt-18450927-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1845-09-27">27 September 1845</date>]</ref>); and already fashionable ladies had been known to cross London just to beg to see their author. In the present edition we have nearly another twenty years of them, and thirty-four of Thomas&#x2019;s, to look forward to.</p>

<p><bold><date when="1845-01-00">January 1845</date>&#x2013;<date when="1847-06-00">June 1847</date></bold></p>
<p><bold><date when="1845-00-00">1845</date></bold> <date when="1845-01-00"><hi rend="italic">January</hi></date>. TC goes on with his decision to edit Cromwell&#x2019;s letters and speeches before writing his biography. JWC comments on a possible life of John Sterling, and continues to see Captain Anthony Sterling in spite of his wife&#x2019;s insane jealousy, which is slowly subsiding. TC reports his health &#x201C;not bad,&#x201D; but Jane is &#x201C;a prisoner&#x201D; in the house with a heavy cold (<date when="1845-01-21">21</date>). Tennyson calls and talks to JWC &#x201C;like an angel&#x201D; while TC is out.</p>
<p><date when="1845-02-00"><hi rend="italic">February</hi></date>. TC&#x2019;s brother Alexander continues establishing himself as a farmer in Ontario, and TC keeps up his correspondence with the rest of the family in Dumfriesshire. Old friends, such as Sterling, Tennyson, Mazzini, Erasmus Darwin, and the mentally disturbed Richard Plattnauer, continue to visit. Browning, Edward FitzGerald, and John Harland are among several who help with <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi>, which three publishers show an interest in publishing. Chapman &#x26; Hall agree to an edition of 1250 copies for &#xa3;300; Carey &#x26; Hart, of Philadelphia, are to bring out the <hi rend="italic">Miscellanies</hi> with TC&#x2019;s frontispiece portrait by Samuel Laurence; TC&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Life of Schiller</hi> is to be republished; but JWC feels that <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> is &#x201C;lasting too long for his strength&#x201D; (<date when="1845-02-21">21</date>). She reports on the reception of Geraldine Jewsbury&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Zoe</hi> (<date when="1845-02-26">26</date>).</p>
<p><date when="1845-03-00"><hi rend="italic">March</hi></date>. JWC writes with amusement of Geraldine Jewsbury&#x2019;s short but passionate affair with John Robertson. Anna Maurice dies, and part of <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> is already in the printers&#x2019; hands (<date when="1845-03-25">25</date>).</p>
<p><date when="1845-04-00"><hi rend="italic">April</hi></date>. The Jewsbury-Robertson affair comes to an end (<date when="1845-04-05">5</date>). JWC sympathizes with Mazzini after a new attack on him by Sir James Graham, who eventually has to apologize. She receives visits from Count D&#x2019;Orsay, Lord Jeffrey (<date when="1845-04-13">13</date>), and others; and she reports an appeal from a &#x201C;seduced Lady&#x201D; and taking a lost child to the police station (<date when="1845-04-24">24</date>). She and TC are visited by the M.P. Frederick Lucas and members of the Young Ireland party, including Charles Gavan Duffy, TC&#x2019;s &#x201C;sworn disciples&#x201D; (<date when="1845-04-26">26</date>).</p>
<p><date when="1845-05-00"><hi rend="italic">May</hi></date>. TC uses David Laing, John Harland, Robert Chambers, and FitzGerald to help with research on Cromwell. Gavan Duffy proposes to send TC the <hi rend="italic">Nation</hi> each week (<date when="1845-05-12">12</date>). TC is extremely busy with his various projects. He writes to J. P. Eckermann about part of the manuscript of Goethe&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Faust</hi> (<date when="1845-05-31">31</date>).</p>
<p><pb id="pg-19-xxvi" n="19:xxvi"/><date when="1845-06-00"><hi rend="italic">June</hi></date>. TC acquires a new horse, Bobus, and resumes regular riding. JWC&#x2019;s guests include Amalie B&#xF6;lte and an insufferable Edinburgh cousin, John Welsh. John Carlyle leaves for Edinburgh; TC&#x2019;s printers are into the second volume of <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> (<date when="1845-06-10">10</date>).

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>On the other leaf of this Note is an extract from Leland (an old fellow in Henry VIII&#x2019;s time, who was sent up and down to take a survey of the <hi rend="italic">Monasteries</hi>, and report about them);<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Leland (<date when="1506-00-00">1506?</date>&#x2013;<date when="1552-00-00">52</date>), earliest English antiquary.</note> which extract I may hope will interest you a little!</p>
<p>But moreover I want to see if you can help me to a little <hi rend="italic">modern</hi> light about it. There seems to me little doubt but Leland is correct; Richard Williams (born where he points out) was to all appearance the Nephew (by a Cromwell mother) of Thomas Cromwell Earl of Essex, the &#x201C;Mauler of Monasteries&#x201D;;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Richard Williams, later Cromwell, Oliver Cromwell&#x2019;s great-grandfather, son of Morgan Williams and Catherine (sister of Thomas Cromwell [<date when="1485-00-00">1485?</date>&#x2013;<date when="1540-00-00">1540</date>], earl of Essex); see <ref target="volume-17/lt-18431222-TC-GLC-01"><sic>17:207</sic><corr>TC to GLC, <date when="1843-12-22">22 Dec. 1843</date></corr></ref>, and <hi rend="italic">Cromwell, Works</hi> 6:28&#x2013;34.</note> he, from this Thomas, got Church lands in Huntingdonshire &#x26;c, having already taken the name of his Mother, and of this powerful Uncle;&#x2014;and was indisputably I think the great grandfather of Oliver Cromwell,&#x2014;who also in some early deeds signs himself &#x201C;alias Williams.&#x201D; Can you find me out the locality Leland alludes to,&#x2014;the exact place? Noble says (about the year <date when="1786-00-00">1786</date>) &#x201C;it is possessed by a gentleman named Lewis.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mark Noble (<date when="1754-00-00">1754</date>&#x2013;<date when="1827-00-00">1827</date>), <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of the Protectorate-House of Cromwell</hi>, 2 vols.

Richard was born in Llanilsen (Llanishen) parish, ca. 4 mi. N of Cardiff; see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 6:31. TC omits the closing quotes.</note></p>
<p>Rumney River I find on my map; but what is <hi rend="italic">Thane?</hi> Is there an Eglis Newith; a Kibworth; a Kevenon (Hill or Commoith)?<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Noble wrote &#x201C;Thane&#x201D;; TC later corrected it to &#x201C;Thave&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 6:31), i.e., Taff, a river of Brecon and Glamorgan which joins the Bristol Channel at Cardiff harbor. The river Rhymney or Rumney runs from Brecon along the border with Glamorgan to the Bristol Channel, 2 mi. E of Cardiff. See also <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 6:31n.</note> On the whole I will ask you to make a little inquiry and report to me by and by.</p>
<p>I am in terrible haste (with <hi rend="italic">this Note</hi>, I mean), writing late at night here, and various other things still to write. I will send you my blessing across the hills and arms of the sea, and take myself away.</p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Many thanks for your Contributions about Cromwell; which, as you find opportunity, I shall be glad if you will continue.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Harland wrote, <date when="1844-12-19">19 Dec. 1844</date>: &#x201C;I am personally unknown to you, but am a friend &#x26; <foreign><hi rend="italic">collaborateur</hi></foreign> of Thos. Ballantyne [see below], from whom I am glad to learn of your present work. Pray keep the &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">Lancashire Civil War Tracts</hi>&#x2019; 6 months, or till you have done with them. As it may facilitate yr. work a little, I inclose a copy of Cromwell&#x2019;s letter from that volume, <hi rend="italic">wh</hi>. (being written on one side only) you can cut up &#x26; paste or wafer on <hi rend="italic">yr</hi>. MS. copy, when (or if) you want it.&#x2014; You have doubtless seen or will see Thierry&#x2019;s Short Essay on Cromwell in his recently pub<hi rend="italic">d</hi> work. As that author <hi rend="italic">dug</hi> for himself, there may be <hi rend="italic">veins</hi> indicated, worth your working out. Excuse these suggestions. Amidst the mass of perversions called &#x2018;history&#x2019; through wh you must have to wade, what your hero said or wrote is nearly the only stuff that may be real &#x26; true. I may therefore refer you to a book readily available in London,&#x2014;&#x2018;Baines&#x2019;s History of Lanc<hi rend="italic">re</hi>&#x2019;&#x2014;vol. II, p. 45 for a letter of Cromwell (<date when="1648-08-19">Aug 19, 1648</date>) to the Lanc<hi rend="italic">re</hi> Com<hi rend="italic">tee</hi>, sitting at Manchester.&#x2014;&#x201D; (Yale MSS). He added many other useful details and wrote again to TC, <date when="1845-01-03">3 Jan.</date>, to &#x201C;inclose copies of 3 letters.&#x201D; J. A. Augustin Thierry (<date when="1796-00-00">1796</date>&#x2013;<date when="1856-00-00">1856</date>).</note></p>
    <p>Most of Cromwell&#x2019;s own Letters, indeed almost all of them, I have now got together; copied and annotated by myself.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC was far from having found all the letters he should have done at this stage, and even after publication, <date when="1845-11-27">27 Nov.</date>, was to find that many had been omitted. The second edn. (<date when="1847-00-00">1847</date>) was to add over ninety letters and one speech to the first, and the third edn. (<date when="1850-00-00">1850</date>) added another speech and at least another forty letters. Readers of TC&#x2019;s letters should, therefore, bear in mind that references to <hi rend="italic">Cromwell, Works</hi> in these notes are to the Centenary Edn. (<date when="1896-00-00">1896</date>), which appears to be indirectly based on the third edn.; and although it is a substantially different work from the one TC pbd. in <date when="1845-00-00">1845</date>, it has unfortunately been the one generally used by historiographers and writers about TC.</note> It so happens that these of the Gloucester Book (which otherwise is known to me, not worth much) are not of the number.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Bibliotheca Gloucestrensis: a Collection of Scarce and Curious Tracts relating to the County and City of Gloucester; Illustrative of and Published during the Civil War</hi>, collected by John Washbourn, pt. 1 (Gloucester, <date when="1825-00-00">1825</date>): 406, 412. TC pbd. some in his <hi rend="italic">Supplement</hi> (<date when="1846-00-00">1846</date>); see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 9:283&#x2013;85.</note> This time therefore it is all right. But in future if you fall in with any Cromwell Letter or Speech, pray ask me first, describing the thing by its exact <hi rend="italic">address</hi> and <hi rend="italic">date</hi>, Whether I have not got it already?&#x2014; Your former Copy, the Letter about Preston Fight, I had possessed in my own handwriting, for some time; and the Baines one you referred me to, I found, was a <hi rend="italic">blunder</hi> on the part of Baines,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For the battle of Preston, <date when="1648-08-17">17 Aug. 1648</date>, see <hi rend="italic">Cromwell, Works</hi> 6:333&#x2013;54. Edward Baines (<date when="1774-00-00">1774</date>&#x2013;<date when="1848-00-00">1848</date>; <ref target="volume-19/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/1089"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>) came from Preston, owned the <hi rend="italic">Leeds Mercury</hi>, and wrote a <hi rend="italic">History of the County Palatine and Duchy of Lancashire</hi>, 4 vols. (<date when="1836-00-00">1836</date>) and other works.</note>&#x2014;a misdating (19<hi rend="italic">th</hi> for 17<hi rend="italic">th</hi>) of a Letter which also I had long ago copied. Such blunders <pb id="pg-19-6" n="19:6"/>abound in this matter; and Baines did not deserve a <hi rend="italic">special</hi> execration, but is included in the general one.</p>
<p>By the bye, do you know Preston? I could like well to have some investigation of the grounds thereabouts by an intelligent person. I could send him copies of all, or as good as all, the credible accounts of the Fight,&#x2014;four of them by eyewitnesses, actors in the business. If I knew the ground I could understand it tolerably well. But &#x2018;Ribble Bridge&#x2019; is &#x2018;two miles off&#x2019; Preston, and not at the very end of it as my memory indicates the position now. Then &#x2018;Darwen Bridge&#x2019;; and the &#x2018;Hill&#x2019; on the South side of Ribble; and the &#x2018;ford of Ribble,&#x2019; not rideable at that hour by Duke Hamilton and C<hi rend="italic">o</hi>, who therefore had to &#x2018;swim&#x2019; it: all this remains very confused to me.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Hamilton (<date when="1606-00-00">1606</date>&#x2013;<date when="1649-00-00">49</date>), 1st duke of Hamilton, led a Scottish army on behalf of Charles I into England, was defeated at Preston, tried and executed.</note></p>
<p>There is no immediate hurry; but help here would not be unwelcome.

    <p>My plot has been thickening till it has seemed really as tho it would come to &#x201C;a regular fix&#x201D;&#x2014; Some five days ago Helen<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mitchell, the Carlyles&#x2019; maid since <date when="1837-00-00">1837</date>.</note> came in from washing the door steps and <hi rend="italic">bursting into tears</hi>, informed me that she &#x201C;really thought she was going to die&#x2014;could at all events no longer keep her legs&#x201D;!&#x2014; Then on questioning her, it came out that she had had &#x201C;the dreadfulest cold&#x201D; for a week, and had &#x201C;kept it out of sight and <hi rend="italic">taken no sort of care of it</hi>&#x201D; because it seemed &#x201C;so impossible for <hi rend="italic">her</hi> to get being ill at the same time as <hi rend="italic">me</hi>&#x201D;&#x2014;and so now she could no longer &#x201C;keep her legs&#x201D; and was broken down as is her usual way into a cowardly distraction <hi rend="italic">after</hi> &#x201C;the disclosure, proportionate to her foolhardiness <hi rend="italic">before</hi> it&#x2014; For me, who had not been down to my kitchen for six or seven weeks nor done all that while anything whatever in the <hi rend="italic">Cinderella</hi> line, but on the contrary had been needing to have several things done for <hi rend="italic">me</hi>&#x2014;the pouring out of my breakfast for example&#x2014;which I am in the habit of doing for myself, this sudden incapability of my <hi rend="italic">one</hi> maid was rather awful&#x2014;especially as for all the time I have been living in Chelsea I have never yet succeeded in discovering any respectable woman to bring in on such sudden emergencies&#x2014;nothing more efficient than one <hi rend="italic">Martha</hi>&#x2014;a child&#x2014;whom Jeanie knows to her sorrow<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jeannie (Babbie) Welsh, Helen&#x2019;s sister, knew Martha (see <ref target="volume-18/lt-18440514-JWC-JW-01"><sic>18:44&#x2013;45</sic><corr>JWC to JW, <date when="1844-05-14">14 May 1844</date></corr></ref>) from her stay in Chelsea, <date when="1842-00-00">1842</date>.</note>&#x2014;nevertheless I retained sufficient presence of mind to administer a large dose of physic to the creature on the spot&#x2014;and then tying an additional shawl over my own head fell to making beds and doing other inevitabilities with as much willingness of <hi rend="italic">spirit</hi> as I could put into <hi rend="italic">flesh</hi> so very weak<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf.

<salute>Dear Jean,</salute>
<p>Thanks for your Note with Sandy&#x2019;s American Sheet, which latter I gave the Doctor yesterday to read (having first read it myself), by whom as I have found since it was despatched towards Ecclefechan the same night.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alexander (Alick or Sandy) Carlyle (<date when="1797-00-00">1797</date>&#x2013;<date when="1876-00-00">1876</date>), TC&#x2019;s brother, had a farm in Ontario, Canada, after emigrating in <date when="1843-00-00">1843</date>. The letter was forwarded to Margaret Aitken Carlyle (<date when="1771-00-00">1771</date>&#x2013;<date when="1853-00-00">1853</date>), TC&#x2019;s mother, living at Scotsbrig, nr. Ecclefechan.</note> None of us, I doubt, wrote to Alick by the last Packet; there is but one in the month at this season. He will have to wait with some anxiety, poor fellow, till the <date when="1845-02-03">3<hi rend="italic">d</hi> of February</date> now,&#x2014;or rather till almost the <date when="1845-02-00">end of February</date>, for no Letter can go till the 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. The Newspapers with their <hi rend="italic">two strokes</hi> would assure him that nothing material had gone wrong. He writes this time to you in better spirits than common: the image he gives one of himself, busy and healthy, is certainly far cheerfuller than we could for many years past get of him in his old home. Poor fellow, I cannot doubt he has come thro&#x2019; a great mass of trouble and sorrow; but I do hope he is getting to the other side of it now: it is a great comfort to me that I can anticipate more wholesome and better days for him henceforth.</p>
<p>Thanks for your punctuality about Mary. Here is an order for your money, with a small overplus of copper for James the Second, and that small woman, Annie I think, whose anxious innocent little face is very vividly present to me just now.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mary Carlyle Austin (<date when="1808-00-00">1808</date>&#x2013;<date when="1888-00-00">88</date>), TC&#x2019;s sister, m. to James Austin, a farmer, of the Gill, a farm nr.

I must and will be out of it; there is no living with such a melancholy burden on one&#x2019;s back. I wish often I were in the silent Country, a hundred or a thousand miles from all these confusions. But that cannot be at present: &#x201C;There where thou art, there where thou remainest, be busy!&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Untraced; perhaps a self-quotation; cf.

<p>Today I have been disturbed in my operations, and quite lamed for the time, by a visit from&#x2014;whom think you?&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">Wull Bogs</hi> once of Ecclefechan!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Bogs; see <ref target="volume-03/lt-18240625-TC-AC-01"><sic>3:95</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1824-06-25">25 June 1824</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350301-TC-JC-01"><sic>8:66</sic><corr>TC to JC, <date when="1835-03-01">1 March 1835</date></corr></ref>.</note> He got in by calling himself an old Annandale friend of mine whom I would be delighted to see. I did not in the least know the unhappy scoundrel: in my life I have seen no sorrier spectacle, more sternly witnessing the inexorable laws of Time and Fate. The poor windy Blockhead, after wandering and lying from East to West, beyond Seas and within Seas, is vain as ever, but shattered now into palsy of body, and I think more than half real <hi rend="italic">delirium</hi> of mind; totally shabby in apparel, but talking as if he had the Bank of England for funds and the wisdom and renown of Solomon for glory. I said, I <hi rend="italic">could</hi> say, almost nothing to him; looked I suppose, like an Iceberg. I shall not get him out of my head all day. Ellen<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Helen Mitchell.</note> has strict orders never more to admit such a visitor. It has made me infinitely sad.</p>

Good old Mother&#x2014; But I should be thankful too.</p>
<p>Jack&#x2019;s people are leaving their house; but the <hi rend="italic">new</hi> people are to keep the furniture,&#x2014;and after investigation Jack decides that he also will stay. The others are upholsterer people, young, and going off to Liverpool to some good engagement there; the new landlady is a &#x201C;more experienced woman&#x201D;: Jack is very well content, with this and indeed with most things. I often rouse him when I happen to walk at night; we go out and have a cigar on the clear streets by moonlight. He has still &#x201C;hopes&#x201D; of some employment &#x26;c&#x2014;literary, I rather think, at present.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Carlyle wrote, [ca. <date when="1844-12-00">mid-Dec. 1844</date>], to Janet Hanning from Cadogan Terr.: &#x201C;I get on quite well in my new lodgings &#x26; am disturbed by no rattling of carriages or omnibusses or shouting of watchmen.

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Thanks for your Notes on the Extract from Leland;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-19/lt-18450103-TC-CR-01">TC to CR, <date when="1845-01-03">3 Jan.</date></ref></note> they will abundantly suffice me even if you get no more. The <hi rend="italic">New Church</hi>, and the exact site and present condition of the Locality where Richard Williams or Cromwell was born,&#x2014;these also will be welcome items, but they are not indispensable to me. Points of Curiosity rather.</p>
    <p>Your friend Downe<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably Matthew Donne (<date when="1790-00-00">1790</date>&#x2013;<date when="1874-00-00">1874</date>), master of the National School at Cowbridge and local historian.</note> is indisputably wrong in his Cromwell Genealogy; Richard Cromwell was by no means the <hi rend="italic">son</hi> of Thomas Cromwell Earl of Essex; there are two Letters of this Richard&#x2019;s still extant in the British Museum, in both of which, legibly to all eyes, he still signs himself, addressing this Thomas Cromwell, &#x201C;Your Affectionate <hi rend="italic">Nephew</hi>.&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 6:29&#x2013;30.</note>&#x2014; How he came to be &#x201C;nephew,&#x201D; and what the word exactly meant in that time, in that case, is very obscure,&#x2014;reported in <hi rend="italic">two</hi> diff<hi rend="italic">t</hi> ways by the single Dugdale, for instance!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sir William Dugdale, <hi rend="italic">Baronage of England</hi>, 3 vols.

The rest is all dust and ashes, and <pb id="pg-19-14" n="19:14"/>inscrutable uncertainty of &#x201C;shot rubbish.&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 6:2.</note> Dugdale&#x2019;s two contradictory accounts are these: first that Thomas Cromwell married a sister of one Williams a Glamorgan Gent<hi rend="italic">n</hi>; and then (in another part of his <hi rend="italic">Baronage</hi> Book), that Williams a Glamorgan gent<hi rend="italic">n</hi> married a sister of Thomas Cromwell&#x2019;s!<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >According to Noble, <hi rend="italic">Protectoral-House</hi> 1:238&#x2013;39, the confusion stemmed from the fact that Richard&#x2019;s mother, Catherine or Katherine (Thomas Cromwell&#x2019;s elder sister), m. Morgan Williams, while Thomas m. the widow of Thomas Williams, whose name was either Jane, b. Prior (Noble), or Elizabeth, b. Wykes (<ref target="volume-19/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/8186"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>).</note> The latter is now the received account: but no Book or man that I have ever met with has any light to justify a judgement about it. The above evidences, of Leland and the Museum Letters, are, I believe, all that exist on the subject.</p>
<p>I am very busy, and not in very flourishing condition. In great haste too!</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>John, I believe, is writing to you today; and certainly there need be no busier man than I am at this present; nevertheless I will not let the monthly Packet go again without sending you my blessing and express New Years wishes. It will be worth a shilling to me,&#x2014;and to you. This morning there came a Letter from Jamie, direct from Scotsbrig: I will inclose that too, as the freshest news; it will bring the whole scene before you, more vividly than Jack can.</p>
<p>I was charged indeed specially from our dear good Mother to send you
<hi rend="italic">her</hi> thanks for the Letter she had from you some time ago; which, I dare say, gave her the liveliest satisfaction,&#x2014;good old Mother! She has not sent me anything from her own hand this long while, but employs Jenny to write: however, I can understand she is really tolerably well, and they often say &#x201C;better than usual.&#x201D; Jamie&#x2019;s new lease of Scotsbrig will be a great thing for her; I did not see well how she was to adjust herself in a new establishment; and am very glad she is to continue as before. Jamie, as perhaps John will explain to you, has made a favourable kind of bargain about Scotsbrig; and is full of brisk zeal, draining &#x26;c &#x26;c. His wife continues <pb id="pg-19-18" n="19:18"/>still weakly.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Isabella Carlyle had been sickly for some time.

One should be humane even to Stots. We are divided from all that now, you and I, as by a great gulph! I often want to be in the Country; but Puttoch always makes me shudder: indeed Scotland at large, and Annandale itself, is infinitely sad to me; it is as if I should never return thither, and could not except as a strange <hi rend="italic">alien</hi> creature, not at home any more. Courage! Let us not keep looking <hi rend="italic">back</hi>; let us look forward, with hope, and diligently bear a hand!</p>
<p>Your Letters, dear Brother, are on the whole very comfortable to me. I see all your sorrows; the deep <hi rend="italic">loneliness</hi>, mournful affections of your heart: alas, I know them well! But there comes <hi rend="italic">good</hi> out of all that; beyond doubt there does. You are working as a man should; you are in good health, which above all rejoices me: you must work along, endure along. Depend upon it, there is no <hi rend="italic">good act</hi> that you do there but will be as seed sown to bring forth good; no evil that you repress in yourself or another but will be as the rooting out of weeds: God&#x2019;s blessing does attend such things, there as here,&#x2014;and in several respects the work is more towardly there than here. Go on, and prosper. We shall meet again, I think; and find that we are both of us &#x201C;made better by suffering.&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Heb. 2:10.</note> If it be God&#x2019;s will!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I am sunk deeper and deeper into my bottomless Task here, and feel often quite disconsolate and almost desperate about it: but I must hold on. Never turn back, till you <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> help it! I do make progress, but of the slowest. My health is not very good,&#x2014;that indeed is the ugliest feature of the whole business; a frightful feature! But I am long used to that. I think of getting a horse in summer, if I can manage it,&#x2014;but it is very expensive, and I grudge it on such a business. Nothing <hi rend="italic">new</hi> ails me at all; only the old story somewhat aggravated by my town life and work. Courage, courage!&#x2014; Jane <pb id="pg-19-19" n="19:19"/>has been weakly all winter; the Sun will return; then she will brighten up again. She sends you, and all yours, many a kind wish.</p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>There comes no Examiner today, therefore I send a little Note to state the reason. The little dud of a Newsvender&#x2019;s Boy, who leaves the Paper here every saturday night <hi rend="italic">forgot</hi> it last saturday, the dirty little scoundrel: it could not be got this morning! I will read it tonight; and then if you call &#x201C;next day&#x201D; at Ecclefechan, it will be there for you as usual. That is all. And as I have sent a sharp message to the poor Newsvender, the accident probably will not occur again.</p>
<p>This morning Jamie&#x2019;s Letter came; you must thank him for me, and say his Newspaper too will come tomorrow. He speaks of being some &#xa3;20 short in his rent, owing to his great outlay for drains &#x26;c.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Carlyle wrote to his brother James, <date when="1845-02-11">11 Feb.</date>: &#x201C;You have made more progress with your drainage than I anticipated. Sixteen acres will make a very fair beginning for the first year. Have you covered the stones in any way to hinder the mould from sinking among them?&#x201D; (MS: NLS Acc. 9086).</note> Tell him if it be any convenience at all, I can lend him the money at once,&#x2014;and he shall appoint his own day for repaying it; three months, 6 months, 12 months hence, any time he likes to <hi rend="italic">set</hi>; and my confidence in him is perfect that he will keep his day. I might have written this to himself; but I am really altogether <hi rend="italic">exceedingly</hi> busy today!</p>
<p>I have written already to Alick, and not forgotten your thanks: Jack also is <pb id="pg-19-20" n="19:20"/>writing, I believe;&#x2014;I stuck Jamie&#x2019;s Letter into the Cover too, beside my own Note; so the Scotsbrig News will arrive in Canada fresh and fresh.</p>
<p>They tell me you have had a cold, dear Mother; Jenny also said you could not write, your hand being so <hi rend="italic">shaky</hi>. I do not well like all that; but what can I do? I should like well to see your hand again however <hi rend="italic">shaky</hi>.&#x2014; The sun will be out, and then we shall be all better.</p>
<p>Here is a wretched rag of an <hi rend="italic">American</hi> Newspaper, which came the other day; you may take it till the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> arrive, and then light your pipe with it! It seems I have an &#x201C;immense reputation&#x201D; in America;&#x2014;which in fact does me neither ill nor good!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-18/lt-18440625-JWC-TC-01"><sic>18:83</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1844-06-25">25 June 1844</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014;</p>
<p>Jane is a little stronger than she once was, but still complains somewhat. We have had a frost, which she likes ill; and today when the thaw has come, it is colder than ever for an in-doors person. What becomes of you, dear Mother? Keep close to the fire, with plenty of clothes about you, and let the fire be good!&#x2014; The Dr was complaining a little last week; not an usual thing with him. It was cold, I think; he took it in time; beat back the invader, and is now well again, tho&#x2019; a little shy of the night air still.</p>
    <p>As for me I am the busiest of men; very disconsolate at &#x201C;getting on so ill&#x201D;; yet still struggle along better or worse. My health holds out prett<supplied>[y]</supplied> well, better than one could expect.

<p>Here is a most polite Note from the Duke of Manchester; and indication withal that there <hi rend="italic">is</hi> one Letter of Oliver&#x2019;s at Kimbolton accessible to us!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Montagu (<date when="1799-00-00">1799</date>&#x2013;<date when="1855-00-00">1855</date>), 6th duke of Manchester; see <ref target="volume-17/lt-18440217-TC-EF-01"><sic>17:275</sic><corr>TC to EF, <date when="1844-02-17">17 Feb. 1844</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-18/lt-18441210-TC-EF-01"><sic>18:280</sic><corr>TC to EF, <date when="1844-12-10">10 Dec. 1844</date></corr></ref>. Kimbolton Castle, his seat in Huntingdonshire.</note> I have answered with all politeness, with many thanks; but rolling over upon <hi rend="italic">you</hi> and the Lady Olivia<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lady Olivia Sparrow (d. <date when="1863-00-00">1863</date>), da. of the 1st earl of Gosford, widow (m. <date when="1797-00-00">1797</date>) of Brig. Gen. Robert Bernard Sparrow (d. <date when="1805-00-00">1805</date>), and mother of Millicent (<date when="1798-00-00">1798</date>&#x2013;<date when="1848-00-00">1848</date>), 1st wife of the 6th duke of Manchester.</note> (without any travelling of mine) the charge of getting me a Copy of this Letter; and even of examining slightly whether there are any more,&#x2014;what more there otherwise is. You will be helpfully busy in this, according to opportunity? I have said so! It will unfold itself farther when the Duke returns to England, if no sooner. I have said that <pb id="pg-19-22" n="19:22"/>the Letter would not be wanted &#x2018;for a month.&#x2019; How in the meanwhile you can keep up your relation to the Lady Olivia; how you can proceed duly in general; and, at the soonest possible, <hi rend="italic">end by giving me a Copy of the Oliver Letter</hi>,&#x2014;all this is left to your own friendly discretion, with my prayers added; I have no other help to add!&#x2014;</p>
    <p>Alfred went away on Sunday, I think; twice I met him, the fiery Son of Gloom. There seems no doubt but he will now get hold of &#xa3;2,000 by Allen&#x2019;s death:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In <date when="1840-00-00">1840</date> Tennyson had invested &#xa3;3,000 in a furniture-carving enterprise promoted by Dr. Matthew Allen; see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400905-TC-JAC-01"><sic>12:239&#x2013;40</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1840-09-05">5 Sept. 1840</date></corr></ref>.

Allen died <date when="1845-01-01">1 Jan.</date>, and Tennyson was soon to receive &#xa3;2,000.</note> I wish he would straightway buy himself an Annuity with it.</p>
<p>I have <hi rend="italic">three</hi> Booksellers<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Chapman &#x26; Hall, Moxon, and probably Longmans or Fraser.</note> all busy examining <hi rend="italic">Cromwell&#x2019;s Letters</hi>, and hope to force one of them into some reasonable bargain about it without farther haggling, in a day or two.</p>

<p><salute>I pray thee dear Babbie</salute>, do not get into the <hi rend="italic">apologetic</hi> vein&#x2014; When there is a real grievance apologies mend nothing: when there is no real grievance they are uncalled for: so that in any case apology-making is sheer waste of human faculty.

<salute>Dear Fitzgerald,</salute>
<p>I have expressly named you and the Lady Olivia to His Grace,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lady Olivia Sparrow; the duke of Manchester.</note> as the benevolent persons who, under Providence and him, are to <hi rend="italic">get me a Copy</hi> of that Paper or Letter of Oliver&#x2019;s, without farther travel or trouble of mine! My own visit to Kimbolton, thankfully acknowledged, and not refused forever, is postponed into the vague distance,&#x2014;to the rear of this publication of <hi rend="italic">Oliver&#x2019;s Letters</hi> at least. So pray bestir yourself, and think what can be done! For the thing will be soon wanted. I have, this morning, after infinite higgling to and fro, definitively settled that the <hi rend="italic">Letters and Speeches</hi> are actually to be proceeded with as a separate Book straightway. The <hi rend="italic">Life</hi> must follow when it can. The <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> themselves, I compute, with bits of light kindled at the corners of them, will prove readable to serious rational men; and may tend to clear away much sordid rubbish out of my road, especially to put the controversy about Oliver&#x2019;s &#x201C;character,&#x201D; &#x201C;hypocrisy&#x201D; &#x26;c &#x26;c asleep forever and a day.&#x2014; So look to the Gainsborough business,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Part of Cromwell&#x2019;s Lincolnshire campaign; see <ref target="volume-17/lt-18440109-TC-EF-01"><sic>17:234</sic><corr>TC to EF, <date when="1844-01-09">9 Jan. 1844</date></corr></ref>.</note> look to the Kimbolton business; and help me what you can!&#x2014;</p>
<p><pb id="pg-19-28" n="19:28"/>If the Lady Olivia is resident at Kimbolton, and if you were within four miles of her with your friend there,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Airy (<date when="1807-00-00">1807</date>&#x2013;<date when="1874-00-00">74</date>), a contemporary of FitzGerald&#x2019;s at Bury St. Edmunds&#x2019; Grammar School and Trinity; domestic chaplain to the duke of Manchester at Kimbolton and vicar of Keysoe, 3 mi. away.</note> it would not be difficult to get your eye upon the Paper itself perhaps, and get me the copy of it, the instant the Key of the repository were turned. This latter, I suppose, cannot happen till His Grace in person arrive? We must be patient; that date, &#x201C;a month hence,&#x201D; will still do for me.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >FitzGerald wrote to a friend, ca. <date when="1845-02-08">8 Feb.</date>: &#x201C;Carlyle has had a handsome invitation from his Grace of Manchester to go and inspect MSS at Kimbolton&#x201D; (Terhune, <hi rend="italic">LEF</hi> 1:485). Earlier in the year FitzGerald had been in London for three weeks (Terhune, <hi rend="italic">LEF</hi> 1:477) and probably had talked with TC about his work on Cromwell. He wrote to a correspondent, <date when="1845-01-29">29 Jan.</date>: &#x201C;Carlyle goes on growling with his Cromwell: whom he finds more and more faultless every day. So that <hi rend="italic">his</hi> paragon also will one day see the light also&#x2014;an elegiac of a different kind from Tennyson&#x2019;s&#x2014;as far apart indeed as Cromwell and Hallam&#x201D; (Terhune, <hi rend="italic">LEF</hi> 1:478). In the same letter FitzGerald mentioned <hi rend="italic">In Memoriam</hi>, the elegy to Arthur Henry Hallam seen in MS by FitzGerald and other friends before its publication in <date when="1850-00-00">1850</date>.</note></p>
<p>I am so weakly, sleepless and unwell at present, I begin thinking of a Horse again. For I am to be very busy. With a long-legged Horse I could ride beautifully up to Kimbolton in summer weather; and see a great many pleasant things there and by the way!&#x2014;</p>
<p>We are very shivery here; gray, dusty and cold.</p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>It is not certain, after all, that I shall go on with this Book of <hi rend="italic">Cromwell&#x2019;s Letters</hi> at present: but if I do, my actual Publishers agree to &#x201C;let me have my own way with it,&#x201D; that is to say (for I may entrust you with secrets), &#xa3;300 ready money on the day of Publication,&#x2014;they printing, I think, 1250 copies. You will find it very proper, for myself, and I daresay for yourself, that I abide by this offer.</p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Many thanks for your two Cromwell Letters, for your Plan of Preston, and your other services to me.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-19/lt-18450105-TC-JHA-01">TC to <sic>JH</sic><corr>JHA</corr>, <date when="1845-01-05">5 Jan.</date></ref> Harland replied, <date when="1845-02-12">12 Feb.</date>, that immediately after receiving TC&#x2019;s letter, he had written to an acquaintance familiar with Preston. From him he had &#x201C;got some facts, w<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I think will give you a fair picture of the place.&#x2014; I inclose a rough map of the neighh<hi rend="italic">d</hi>, w<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I have traced from an old map &#x2026; &#x26; upon it laid down hills Bridges &#x26; fords, as described by my informant.&#x201D; He went into further detail, which TC used (see <hi rend="italic">Cromwell, Works</hi> 6:333&#x2013;53). The Yale MSS include, in TC&#x2019;s hand, a &#x201C;List of Books &#x26;c. at Manchester, which Harland will excerpt for me.&#x201D;</note></p>
<p>I have copied the Letter into my general stock, and also the Pass; concerning both of which I will ask these farther questions, probably not difficult for you, as the <hi rend="italic">Collinson&#x2019;s Somersetshire</hi> (<hi rend="italic">vol III p 357</hi>), and the <hi rend="italic">Jefferson&#x2019;s Allerdale Ward</hi> (no page given) seem to be in your hands.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Collinson, <hi rend="italic">The History and Antiquities of the County of Somerset</hi>, 3 vols. (Bath, <date when="1791-00-00">1791</date>); Samuel Jefferson, <hi rend="italic">The History and Antiquities of Allerdale Ward, Above Derwent</hi> (Carlisle, <date when="1842-00-00">1842</date>).</note></p>
<p>First, with regard to the Letter (in Collinson), Where <hi rend="italic">was</hi> the old Castle of the Hungerfords? The Hungerford whom I have guessed as the Addressee on this occasion served for <hi rend="italic">Wiltshire</hi> in Parl<hi rend="italic">t</hi>, nor do I know any other public Hungerford except for that County and not Somerset.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For Sir Edward Hungerford (<date when="1596-00-00">1596</date>&#x2013;<date when="1648-00-00">1648</date>), Henry Hungerford, and Anthony Hungerford (ca. <date when="1608-00-00">1608</date>&#x2013;<date when="1657-00-00">57</date>), and the Hungerford family seat, Farley or Farleigh Castle at Farleigh Hungerford, 6 mi. SE of Bath, see <hi rend="italic">Cromwell, Works</hi> 8:20&#x2013;22.</note> Of the other &#x201C;several&#x201D; original Letters of Cromwell, I suppose, Collinson gives no farther hint?</p>
<p>Then with regard to the Pass, will you give me the <hi rend="italic">page</hi> of Jefferson; and also say, if you can, where <hi rend="italic">Dalegarth</hi> is, and what it now is, a farm or an estate or what,&#x2014;if Jefferson will be so good as tell you.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dalegarth, W Cumberland, NW England. Jefferson notes that Dalegarth Hall was a farmhouse (<hi rend="italic">Allerdale Ward</hi> 179). For the pass issued by Cromwell to one John Stanley of Dalegarth, see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 7:4&#x2013;5.</note> In &#x2018;Allerdale Ward&#x2019; my Map has it not.</p>
<p>The Preston Map and details will come in very good stead by and by; when if I find farther occasion, I will trouble you with farther questions.</p>
<p>None of the Books you are kind enough to mention seems to promise much for me. The most of them I have in my hands or very accessible here; the torpid blockheadism, the gross ignorance, dilettantism, infidelity and <hi rend="italic">damnability</hi>, of them and their editors in general, are very painfully known to me of late years!</p>
<p>Sir W<hi rend="italic">m</hi> Brereton&#x2019;s Letters might perhaps be worth something,&#x2014;but <pb id="pg-19-30" n="19:30"/>&#x2018;five volumes&#x2019; of such matter will be rather heavy.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sir William Brereton (<date when="1604-00-00">1604</date>&#x2013;<date when="1661-00-00">61</date>); see <ref target="volume-17/lt-18440323-TC-TB-01"><sic>17:318</sic><corr>TC to TB, <date when="1844-03-23">23 March 1844</date></corr></ref>. His MS letterbooks, 3 vols. acquired in <date when="1838-00-00">1838</date>, are in the British Lib. Foote Gower, <hi rend="italic">A Sketch &#x2026; for a New History of Cheshire</hi> (Chelmsford, <date when="1771-00-00">1771</date>), mentions owning five vols. of his journals (45). No edn. was pbd.</note> One volume, or half a volume, chosen by a good man, would be a far likelier thing.</p>
<p>If that old rhyming blockhead, the title of whose Book I inclose here, happen to give you any faintest perceptible <hi rend="italic">view</hi> of the actual look of <hi rend="italic">Latham House</hi> (the Stanley&#x2019;s Place) in those years, I will bid you favour me with an extract.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For Lathom House, James Stanley (<date when="1607-00-00">1607</date>&#x2013;<date when="1651-00-00">51</date>), 7th earl of Derby and his wife Charlotte (<date when="1599-00-00">1599</date>&#x2013;<date when="1664-00-00">1664</date>), see <ref target="volume-17/lt-18440323-TC-TB-01"><sic>17:318</sic><corr>TC to TB, <date when="1844-03-23">23 March 1844</date></corr></ref>.

<salute>Dear Browning,</salute>
<p>I find I must still trouble you with that unfortunate Field a little. His Note,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1656-05-25">25 May 1656</date>, Cromwell to his third son, Richard (<date when="1626-00-00">1626</date>&#x2013;<date when="1712-00-00">1712</date>), who succeeded him as lord protector; see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 8:253&#x2013;54.</note> of no great significance, is full of obscurities; has no address, and one or two other dubieties.</p>
<p>I send you his Copy, and mine taken from his, which still does not make very indisputable sense; I wish you would contrast it with the original, especially in the places which I have marked with an interrogation in pencil.</p>
<p>&#x2018;New Hall&#x2019; I suppose to be New Hall in Essex, which I have some obscure remembrance of, otherwise, in reference to Cromwell:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The house and estate settled on Richard that the letter suggested selling for &#xa3;18,000; see also <ref target="volume-18/lt-18440521-TC-RB-01"><sic>18:48</sic><corr>TC to RB, <date when="1844-05-21">21 May 1844</date></corr></ref>.</note> of course it would be of no use questioning Field on the subject; but I will have a trial made in the County Histories of Essex. &#x2018;Wallop&#x2019; may be a money-scrivener; or a man that has got land to sell, which Richard is to buy with the &#xa3;18,000.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not identified by TC in <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> but possibly Robert Wallop (<date when="1601-00-00">1601</date>&#x2013;<date when="1667-00-00">67</date>), M.P., one of the judges at Charles I&#x2019;s trial.</note> &#x2018;Waterhouse&#x2019; is evidently the man of business.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Waterhouse, army physician; see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 7:289.</note> &#x2018;Burleigh&#x2019; is an Estate of Oliver&#x2019;s not heritably settled on Richard; but whether the big Burleigh House near Stamford (once stormed by Oliver in the early part of <pb id="pg-19-31" n="19:31"/>his career), or which of the other three or four <hi rend="italic">Burleys</hi>, is a question hitherto.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC identified it as Burleigh on the Hill, nr. Oakham, Rutland, taken by assault, <date when="1643-00-00">1643</date>. Burghley House, NE Northamptonshire, nr. Stamford, built, <date when="1560-00-00">1560</date>&#x2013;<date when="1587-00-00">87</date>, by Queen Elizabeth&#x2019;s councillor William Cecil (<date when="1520-00-00">1520</date>&#x2013;<date when="1598-00-00">98</date>), 1st Baron Burghley. For Cromwell&#x2019;s storming of it, <date when="1643-00-00">1643</date>, see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 6:153.</note></p>
<p>Pray give me your best guess, and the light of your own eyes and mind. Any day; no haste. And above all, thank Field for me, and say (if you can politely) I do <hi rend="italic">not</hi> need the &#x2018;view of Newhall,&#x2019; nor the viewer of it henceforth!&#x2014; <closer><salute>Yours ever truly</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Emerson,</salute>
<p>By the last Packet which sailed on the 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi> of the Month I forgot to write to you, tho&#x2019; already in your debt one Letter; and here now has another Letter arrived, which on the footing of mere business demands to be answered.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letters dated <date when="1844-12-31">31 Dec. 1844</date> and <date when="1845-01-31">31 Jan.</date></note> I write straightway; not knowing how the Post-Office people will contrive the conveyance, or whether it can be sooner than by the next Steamship, but willing to give them a chance.</p>
    <p>You have made another brave bargain for me with the Philadelphia people; to all which I can say nothing but &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Euge! Papae</hi></foreign> [Well done]!&#x201D; It seems to me strange, in the present state of copyright, how my sanction or the contrary can be worth &#xa3;50 to any American Bookseller; but so it is, to all appearance; let it be so, therefore, with thanks and surprise. The Messrs Carey and Lea distinguish themselves by the beauty of their Editions;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson wrote, <date when="1845-01-31">31 Jan.</date>, that the Philadelphia publishers Carey &#x26; Hart (formerly Carey &#x26; Lea) had offered &#xa3;50 for TC&#x2019;s sanction of their publication of a new edn. of the <hi rend="italic">Miscellanies</hi>.</note> a poor Author does not go abroad among his friends in dirty paper, full of misprints, under their guidance: this is as handsome an item of the business as any. As to the Portrait too, I will be as &#x201C;amiable&#x201D; as heart could wish; truly it will be worth my while to take a little pains that the kind Philadelphia Editors do once for all get a faithful Portrait of me, since they are about it, and so prevent counterfeits from getting into circulation.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson said that the Philadelphia firm wanted a portrait of TC that could be engraved for the proposed edn. and understood that Samuel Laurence (<date when="1812-00-00">1812</date>&#x2013;<date when="1884-00-00">84</date>; <ref target="volume-19/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/16130"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>; see <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380706-TC-JCA-01"><sic>10:115</sic><corr>TC to JCA, <date when="1838-07-06">6 July 1838</date></corr></ref>) had done one. They had commissioned Henry Inman (<date when="1801-00-00">1801</date>&#x2013;<date when="1846-00-00">46</date>), American portraitist (then in England to do portraits of Wordsworth and Macaulay) to ask TC to arrange for a copy of the Laurence portrait (see 10:frontispiece, where wrongly dated <date when="1838-00-00">1838</date>, <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380711-JWC-JOST-01"><sic>10:118</sic><corr>JWC to JOST, <date when="1838-07-11">11 July 1838</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410321-TC-AC-01"><sic>13:60&#x2013;61</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1841-03-21">21 March 1841</date></corr></ref>).</note><figure><graphic url="volume-10-frontispiece.gif"/><p>Frontispiece, CL Volume 10</p><p><hi rend="italic">CL</hi></p></figure> I <pb id="pg-19-32" n="19:32"/>will endeavour to do in that matter whatsoever they require of me; to the extent even of sitting two days for a Crayon Sketch such as may be engraved,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; this new sacrifice of patience will not perhaps be needed as matters are. It stands thus: There is no Painter, of the numbers who have wasted my time and their own with trying, that has indicated any capability of catching a true likeness, but one Samuel Lawrence, a young Painter of real talent, not quite so young now, but still only struggling for complete mastership in the management of colours. He does Crayon Sketches in a way to please almost himself; but his oil paintings, at least till within a year or two, have indicated only a great faculty still crude in that particular. His oil portrait of me, which you speak of, is almost terrible to behold! It has the look of a <foreign><hi rend="italic">J&#xF6;tun</hi></foreign>, of a Scandinavian Demon, grim, sad as the Angel of Death;&#x2014;and the colouring is so <hi rend="italic">brick</hi>ish, the finishing so coarse, it reminds you withal of a flayed horse&#x2019;s-head: &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Dinna speak o&#x2019;t!</hi>&#x201D; But the preparatory Crayon-Sketch of this, still in existence, is admired by some judges: poor John Sterling bought it from the Painter, and it is now here in the hands of his Brother, who will readily allow any authorized person to take a drawing of it.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Reprod. 8:frontispiece. Now at the Carlyle House, Chelsea, it was presented by Sterling&#x2019;s grand-da. For Sterling&#x2019;s acquisition of it and Anna Maria Fox&#x2019;s copy, see <ref target="volume-15/lt-18421103-JWC-AMF-01"><sic>15:163</sic><corr>JWC to AMF, <date when="1842-11-03">3 Nov. 1842</date></corr></ref>.</note><figure><graphic url="volume-08-frontispiece.gif"/><p>Frontispiece, CL Volume 8</p><p><hi rend="italic">CL</hi></p></figure> Lawrence himself I imagine would be the fittest man to employ;&#x2014;or your Mr Ingram, if he be here and a capable person: one or both of these might superintend the engraving of it here, and not part with the Plate till it were pronounced satisfactory.

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I am delighted to hear from you again, to taste of your old friendliness and forgivenness again.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter dated <date when="1845-01-01">1 Jan.</date>; &#x201C;forgivenness&#x201D; as in MS, also &#x201C;sherest&#x201D; below.</note> I have behaved very ill,&#x2014;or rather seemed to behave, for the blame is not wholly mine, as the penalty wholly is. These many months I have not, except upon the sherest compulsion, written to any person. Not that I have been so busy as never to have a vacant hour,&#x2014;alas, very far from that, often enough;&#x2014;but I have been, and am still, and still am like to be, sunk deep down in Chaos and the Deathkingdoms; sick of body, sick of heart; saddled with an enterprise which is too heavy for me. It is many long years now since I began the study of Oliver Cromwell, a problem for all ingenuous Englishmen; it is four or five long years since I as it were committed myself to the task of doing something with it: and now, on fair trial, it proves the likest to any <hi rend="italic">impossible</hi> task of all I ever undertook. The books upon it would load some waggons, dull as torpor itself, every book of them; the pedantries, dilettantisms, cants, misconceptions, platitudes and unimaginable confusions that prevail upon it,&#x2014;drive one to despair! I have read, and written and burnt; I have sat often contemplative, looking out upon the mere Infinite of desolation. What to do I yet know not. I have Goethe&#x2019;s superstition about &#x201C;not turning back&#x201D;; having put one&#x2019;s hand to the plough, it is not good to shrink away till one has driven the furrow thro&#x2019; in some way or other! Alas, the noble Seventeenth Century, with a God shining thro&#x2019; all fibres of it, by what art can it be presented to this poor Nineteenth which has no God, which has not even quitted the bewildering <hi rend="italic">pretention</hi> to have a God?&#x2014; These things hold <pb id="pg-19-35" n="19:35"/>me silent, for of them it is better not to speak; and my poor life is buried under them at present.</p>
<p>However, I suppose, we <hi rend="italic">shall</hi> get into daylight again, sooner or later! After a good deal of consideration, I decided on gathering together all that I could yet find of Oliver&#x2019;s own writing or uttering; his <hi rend="italic">Letters and Speeches</hi> I now have in a mass, rendered for the first time legible to modern men: this, tho&#x2019; it must be a very dull kind of reading to most or all, I have serious thoughts of handing out, since men now <hi rend="italic">can</hi> read it;&#x2014;I would say, or in some politer way intimate, &#x201C;There, you unfortunate <foreign><hi rend="italic">canaille</hi></foreign> [rabble]; read these! Judge whether that man was a &#x2018;hypocrite,&#x2019; a &#x2018;charlatan&#x2019; and &#x2018;liar&#x2019; whether <hi rend="italic">he</hi> was not a Hero and god-inspired Man, and you a set of sniggering &#x2018;Apes by the Dead Sea&#x2019;?&#x201D;&#x2014; This you perceive will not be easy to say! All these things, however, plead my excuse with you, who know well enough what the like of them means in a man&#x2019;s existence; and so I stand absolved in your thoughts, and am pitied by you, and tenderly regarded as before!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Your beautiful little Books came safe to hand above a week ago.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The first two vols. of the second edn. of Varnhagen&#x2019;s short lives, <hi rend="italic">Biographische Denkmale</hi>, 5 vols. (Berlin, <date when="1845-00-00">1845</date>&#x2013;<date when="1846-00-00">46</date>).</note> The reading of them is like landing on a sunny green island, out of waste endless Polar Seas, which my usual studies have resembled of late. I like Derfflinger very well;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Baron Georg von Derfflinger (<date when="1606-00-00">1606</date>&#x2013;<date when="1695-00-00">95</date>), Brandenburg soldier who fought in the Swedish service in the Thirty Years&#x2019; War and in the campaign against Sweden, <date when="1678-00-00">1678</date>&#x2013;<date when="1679-00-00">79</date>.</note> and envy you the beautiful talent of getting across a wide dim wilderness so handsomely, delineating almost all that <hi rend="italic">is</hi> visible in it as you go! Your Elector of Brandenburg, Derfflinger&#x2019;s Elector, was an acquaintance of my Oliver&#x2019;s too;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Friedrich Wilhelm (<date when="1620-00-00">1620</date>&#x2013;<date when="1688-00-00">88</date>), elector of Brandenburg, <date when="1640-00-00">1640</date>&#x2013;<date when="1688-00-00">88</date>, called &#x201C;the Great Elector&#x201D;; see <hi rend="italic">Cromwell, Works</hi> 9:155n.</note> this is a new point of union. I had read <hi rend="italic">Lippe</hi> already; but grudged him not a second reading, neither is this perhaps the last. I have known the man always since Herder&#x2019;s Biography by his Widow; and regarded him with real curiosity and interest.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Graf Friedrich Wilhelm Ernst von Schaumburg-Lippe (<date when="1724-00-00">1724</date>&#x2013;<date when="1777-00-00">77</date>), who served as a Portuguese field marshal. He called Johann Gottfried von Herder (<date when="1744-00-00">1744</date>&#x2013;<date when="1803-00-00">1803</date>), philosopher and man of letters, to B&#xfc;ckeburg, <date when="1771-00-00">1771</date>, as court preacher. Herder&#x2019;s biography by his wife, Maria Caroline, b. Flachsland (<date when="1750-00-00">1750</date>&#x2013;<date when="1809-00-00">1809</date>), was ed. by J. G.

Those scenes in the Portuguese War which stood all as a Picture in my head were f<supplied>[ull]</supplied> of admonition to me on this last occasion. I said to myself, &#x201C;See, there is a man with a still uglier enterprise than thine; in the centre he too of infinite human Stupidities; see how he moulds them, controuls them, hurls them asunder, stands like a piece of human Valour in the middle of them;&#x2014;see, and take shame to <pb id="pg-19-36" n="19:36"/>thyself!&#x201D; Many thanks to you for this new Gift. And weary not to go on working with great or with small encouragement in that true province of yours. A man with a pen in his hand, with the gift of articulate pictorial utterance, surely <hi rend="italic">he</hi> is well employed in painting and articulating worthy acts and men that by the nature of them were dumb. I on the whole define all Writing to mean even that, or else almost nothing. From Homer&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> down to the New-Testament <hi rend="italic">Gospels</hi>,&#x2014;to the <hi rend="italic">Goethe&#x2019;s Poems</hi> (if we will look what the essence of them is),&#x2014;all writing means Biography; utterance in human words of Heroisms that are not <hi rend="italic">fully</hi> utterable except in the speech of gods! Go on, and prosper. Tho&#x2019; all kinds of jargon circulate round the thing one does, and in these days no man as it were is worth listening to at all upon it; yet the <hi rend="italic">Silences</hi> know one&#x2019;s work very well, and do adopt what part of it is <hi rend="italic">true</hi>, and preserve that indestructible thro eternal time! Courage!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I have sent you here a few Autographs;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Which Varnhagen collected; see <ref target="volume-16/lt-18430501-TC-KAVE-01"><sic>16:143</sic><corr>TC to KAVE, <date when="1843-05-01">1 May 1843</date></corr></ref>.</note> they are worth almost nothing; they came without trouble, and will testify at least of my goodwill. If I had any service useful for you, very gladly would I do it.</p>
<p>You ask what Books &#x26;c you can again procure for me? At present no Books; but there is another thing perhaps,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; I know not certainly. The case is this. Booksellers are about republishing a miserable little <hi rend="italic">Life of Schiller</hi> by me; and want a <hi rend="italic">Medal</hi> of Schiller which they could engrave from. A good likeness;&#x2014;an autograph in addition is hardly to be looked for. I have here a small cameo copied from Danecker&#x2019;s Bust, by much the finest Schiller&#x2019;s-face I have seen.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For Johann Heinrich von Dannecker (<date when="1758-00-00">1758</date>&#x2013;<date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>) and his bust of Johann Christoph Friedrich von Schiller (<date when="1759-00-00">1759</date>&#x2013;<date when="1805-00-00">1805</date>), see <ref target="volume-05/lt-18290305-TC-JAC-01"><sic>5:9&#x2013;10</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1829-03-05">5 March 1829</date></corr></ref>. The cameo is evidently the &#x201C;impression&#x201D; of the bust sent JWC in <date when="1829-00-00">1829</date>.</note> But perhaps there is no such medal? Do not mind it much, I pray you! <closer><salute>And so farewell and wish me well!</salute></closer></p>

    <p>A thousand pardons! I should have written to you; but I knew not there was anybody suffering by it but myself, and so I waited till the hurry should subside a little.

<p>I had some thoughts of writing again to Anderson, but incline to believe now it will be as well not.

<salute>Dearest Babbie</salute>
<p>Altho my last letter was the merest of <hi rend="italic">duds</hi>, only to be excused by a crisis of &#x201C;difficult circumstances,&#x201D; still I was glad, on receiving your packet of next morning, that I had written it such as it was. A letter not <hi rend="italic">legally</hi> due, especially when it makes no allusion to its own <hi rend="italic">generosity</hi>, gives no hint of its double claim to be answered, is always a touching fact for me, and the wee soft warm things were also a touching fact. so that besides being put into a rather &#x201C;melting mood&#x201D; of gratitude I should have felt a <hi rend="italic">a certain</hi> twinge of remorse, but for the scrawl I had fired off at you the preceeding day, indicating that if I was sore <foreign>hested</foreign> [harassed] at all events I was not oblivious&#x2014;</p>
<p>I did not wait for the indefinite event of <hi rend="italic">putting on a bonnet</hi> to take the good of the wee cap. I mounted it on the spot, and it has never been off my head since, except when exchanged for my night cap&#x2014;very comfortable it is and also very becoming. something betwixt <hi rend="italic">the black scarf</hi> which I had grown to feel too fantastical for my actual circumstances, and the prosaic english white cap, which I had taken to &#x201C;in <foreign>wera</foreign> desperation&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; &#x201C;melting mood&#x201D; in previous paragraph from <hi rend="italic">Othello</hi> 5.2.</note> One would say that since I have adopted this woolen <foreign><hi rend="italic">juste milieu</hi></foreign> [happy medium] I have been (as they say of the funds) &#x201C;looking up&#x201D;&#x2014; Certainly I am better within the last two days, I am not so weak, nor so hoarse, nor so feverish, nor do I feel such noble independence of victual, nor is my temper so very devilish&#x2014; I still cough enough but M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Fleming told me on sunday that he heard by the sound of my cough that &#x201C;it was going&#x201D;&#x2014;a good journey to it! On the whole I have now good hope again that I shall recover entirely when warm weather comes&#x2014;last week I was rather desperate about recovery under any circumstances</p>
<p>I have not tried either of your mixtures but keep them in reserve in case one which M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Fleming brought me on Sunday fails of the splendid success he predicted for it&#x2014; He is not a D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Fleming but worth a score such D<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> as my Brotherinlaw. He has been urging this mixture on me for weeks back&#x2014;but (as Mazzini says) I <hi rend="italic">want energy</hi>&#x2014;last Sunday when I told him I <pb id="pg-19-40" n="19:40"/>had still not tried it he said &#x201C;nor ever will unless I get it mixed for you myself&#x201D;&#x2014; On leaving he went to a chemist&#x2019;s, and returned in half an hour, and gave the vial to Helen with directions that I was to &#x201C;take one spoonful that night&#x2014;two next day and the next day I should be quite well&#x201D;&#x2014; When one&#x2019;s natural <hi rend="italic">helps</hi> prove so ineffectual; it is considerate of Providence to raise up such kindhearted strangers!</p>
<p>Had you seen what followed the writing of my last letter to you, you would have been of opinion that I had better have remained up stairs&#x2014; I had just stretched myself on the sofa to rest when a carriage drove up like thunder with gay liveries glancing thro the very muslin blinds! and presently were announced&#x2014;&#x201C;<hi rend="italic">The Prussian Ambassador</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Madame</hi> the Ambassadress&#x201D;!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Christian Karl Josias Bunsen (<date when="1791-00-00">1791</date>&#x2013;<date when="1860-00-00">1860</date>), Prussian ambassador to Britain, <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>&#x2013;<date when="1854-00-00">54</date>, and Frances, b.

Mercifully Carlyle was in the house and speedily came to the rescue&#x2014;but they staid, my dear, one hour and forty minutes by the clock! and all that while my <hi rend="italic">sweet bread</hi> was kept waiting for me and I for it&#x2014;and I had to talk talk&#x2014;about matters I never talked of in my life before&#x2014;and all the while I was haunted with&#x2014;a presentiment of Plattnauer!&#x2014;who after he left the Asylum used to go and kick up rows at the Embassy!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-18/lt-18440927-TC-CKJB-01"><sic>18:222&#x2013;23</sic><corr>TC to CKJB, <date when="1844-09-27">27 Sept. 1844</date></corr></ref>.</note></p>
    <p>But every thing has an end with time and patience&#x2014;and so had this stately visit&#x2014;nay in my normal state I should have found it a very agreeable one&#x2014;for they are both very clever people in their way.

Col. Macleay (possibly MacLean) is unidentified.</note> All people I used to hear of so often in my wee existence. She is a nice friendly little thing, prettily bred and prettily spoken, and they say she is very clever and learned&#x2014;but of that I saw no evidence which is perhaps paying a <pb id="pg-19-41" n="19:41"/>high compliment to her modesty&#x2014;I should say from one hour&#x2019;s inspection of her that she belongs decidedly to the genus <foreign><hi rend="italic">wersh</hi></foreign> [insipid]</p>
<p>It is quite curious to see the horror excited in some people (and these the least moral) by Geraldines book while the <hi rend="italic">moralest</hi> people of my acquaintance either like it or are not at the pains to abuse it&#x2014; Even Miss Wilson<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jane Wilson.</note> to whom I dared to lend it&#x2014;tho she confessed to never having &#x201C;ventured on reading a line of George Sand in her life&#x201D; brought it back to me with <hi rend="italic">a certain</hi> <hi rend="small-caps">equanimity</hi>&#x2014; &#x201C;It is <hi rend="italic">avowedly</hi> the book of an audacious <foreign><hi rend="italic">esprit forte</hi></foreign> [strong spirit], and so of course you did not expect <hi rend="italic">me</hi> to <hi rend="italic">approve</hi> of it, nor do I, but I think it very clever and amusing&#x201D;&#x2014;<foreign>voila tout</foreign> [there you are]! While old and young <hi rend="italic">rou&#xE9;s</hi> of the Reform Club almost go off in hysterics over&#x2014;its <hi rend="italic">indecency</hi>.</p>
<p>The oddest thing of all is that Geraldine seems to me in the fair way of getting a Husband by it!!!&#x2014; Robertson in a fit of distraction took to writing her letters of criticism about it which have led him already further than he thought&#x2014;and she&#x2014;has taken or is fast taking &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">a fit</hi>&#x201D; to him&#x2014;and both I can perceive contemplate a <hi rend="italic">lawful</hi> catastrophe.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Robertson (d. <date when="1875-00-00">1875</date>); see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18371030-TC-JSM-01"><sic>9:337</sic><corr>TC to JSM, <date when="1837-10-30">30 Oct. 1837</date></corr></ref>.

<salute>Dearest Babbie</salute>
<p>I ought to have returned thanksgiving for the improved state of the weather in writing to my natural friends&#x2014;but if you knew the worry of correspondence I have been engaged in!

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Many thanks for your Cromwell Letter, copied out of the Dublin Book. It has just come in time, and will get fairly into print. I think you have given me the exact Title of the Volume in the Trinity-College Catalogue, whereby it may be with all clearness indicated to any one that wants to verify it?<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Harland wrote to TC from Manchester, <date when="1845-03-20">20 March</date>: He had been in Dublin &#x201C;&#x26; with some difficulty got a sight of a M.S. vol. in Trinity Coll, for there they only grant permission at a weekly board &#x2026; but thro favour of the &#x2026; librarian I saw it.&#x201D; The letter was of <date when="1647-09-14">14 Sept. 1647</date> to Michael Jones (d. <date when="1649-00-00">1649</date>), gov. of Dublin; see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 6:285&#x2013;86.</note> There is no doubt about the Signature. I shall make out the rest, and elucidate it from sources here.&#x2014; Give yourself at present no trouble about the other matters on my account. This Letter is valuable; and so might certain of the others be: but they belong to a class which, in its actual state (wagonloads of unsorted confusion), belongs rather to the category of Lumber, and requires resolutely to be shovelled into the corner if one would make any way.</p>
<p>Bradshaw&#x2019;s Life, if it be a <hi rend="italic">Life</hi> at all, especially if there be any likelihood that it is Bradshaw&#x2019;s own writing, might well deserve the attention of your Cheetham Society.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably John Bradshaw (<date when="1602-00-00">1602</date>&#x2013;<date when="1659-00-00">59</date>), presiding judge at Charles I&#x2019;s trial. No life of him was pbd. TC writes &#x201C;Cheetham&#x201D; for &#x201C;Chetham.&#x201D;</note></p>
<p>Martindale&#x2019;s Life, if you have no other use for it, will be in good time for me three months hence.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">The Life of Adam Martindale Written by Himself</hi>, ed.

<p>Thank you from the bottom of my heart for your few lines&#x2014; We were <hi rend="italic">very</hi> anxious to hear something of yourself&#x2014;to be assured that you have not <pb id="pg-19-47" n="19:47"/>altogether broken down under this terrible stroke&#x2014;knowing the sort of man you are, we <hi rend="italic">hoped</hi> that even in the first days you would bear it <hi rend="italic">nobly devoutly</hi>&#x2014;but still it is <hi rend="italic">such</hi> a loss!&#x2014;the <hi rend="italic">very best wife</hi> that I have ever seen in the world, and you the very most affectionate husband that I have ever known&#x2014; I have said it to my husband over and over again that you were the <hi rend="italic">only</hi> pair in my whole acquaintance who seemed to me to make of married life what it was originally intended to be a &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">holy</hi> estate of Matrimony&#x201D; and so soon to be parted in <hi rend="italic">this</hi> Life!&#x2014;it is so sorrowful to think of for us who are but <hi rend="italic">friends&#x2014;onlookers</hi>&#x2014;that one could not have wondered if your strength and faith had failed you in the first days of feeling yourself alone&#x2014;alone&#x2014; Oh I know so well what these first days of separation are&#x2014;even with the hope of meeting again hereafter&#x2014;indeed without that hope I know not how any bereaved mortal is enabled to survive them&#x2014;God give you comfort&#x2014;all human pity is utterly helpless and worthless at such a time&#x2014;</p>
<p>My husband met Cap<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Sterling in the street the very day he had heard the sorrowful news, and I saw the minute he came into the room that he had something dreadful to tell me&#x2014; Poor Annie Maurice he said at last&#x2014;and there was no need of more words. Again and again he has exclaimed since, in the midst of his reading &#x201C;poor <hi rend="italic">good</hi> Annie Maurice!&#x2014;what <hi rend="italic">will</hi> her husband do without her!&#x201D; Oh yes she was &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">good</hi>&#x2019; and has left a most pure sweet image in every heart that knew her ever so little</p>
<p>I had been thinking all thro my last illness, if I were only able to get to her again I should try to make her love me, and get more good of her than in all these past years&#x2014; Till I knew her in danger I never knew how much I had loved and respected her all along and now!&#x2014; God be with you my dear friend&#x2014; Excuse me for <hi rend="italic">troubling</hi> you perhaps with this note&#x2014; I could not help writing</p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>About a week ago I had your very kind Letter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1845-03-19">19 March</date>.</note> with the Autograph of Schiller, which latter I shall take care to return you soon as it has served its purpose here. The Medallions, and the Portrait of Schiller will arrive in good time for their object:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-19/lt-18450216-TC-KAVE-01">TC to KAVE, <date when="1845-02-16">16 Feb.</date></ref>, and <ref target="volume-19/lt-18450425-TC-EC-01">TC to [EC], <date when="1845-04-25">25 April</date></ref>.</note> we shall certainly be able to make out a Likeness of Schiller from the combination, unless <hi rend="italic">our</hi> part in it be mismanaged; yours has been performed with all imaginable fidelity! I could regret that you give yourself such a quantity of trouble to serve me; really a far too liberal quantity of trouble!&#x2014;but I suppose you find a satisfaction in it; so I must let you have your way.</p>
<p>Today in my extremity of haste, with Printers chasing me, and paper litter of every description lying round me in the most distracting way, I must restrict myself to the one little point of business which your Letter indicates: that matter of the <hi rend="italic">Behemoth</hi>.&#x2014; Your great Frederick is right in what he has written there, at least he is not wrong,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; I suspect he has but consulted Book Catalogues, or some secondhand Criticism, rather than the Work itself which he speaks of. <hi rend="italic">Behemoth</hi> is the name of a very small Book of Thomas Hobbes, Author of the <hi rend="italic">Leviathan</hi>, as you have <pb id="pg-19-51" n="19:51"/>guessed: I think the big <hi rend="italic">Leviathan</hi> was published about <date when="1650-00-00">1650</date> or shortly after; and this little <hi rend="italic">Behemoth</hi> not till about <date when="1670-00-00">1670</date>, tho&#x2019; probably written long before.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Varnhagen wrote, <date when="1845-03-19">19 March</date>: &#x201C;I have now myself also a request, for which I ask your help! In Frederick the Great&#x2019;s essay &#x2018;On German Literature&#x2019; there is the following passage: &#x2018;In England policy, sustained by the fanaticism of Cromwell, bore a grudge against the throne: cruel toward his kind, Cromwell governed the nation wisely. Thus <hi rend="italic">Behemoth</hi> can only be regarded as a party libel. Milton&#x2019;s Paradise is a better book undoubtedly; that man was a man of powerful imagination&#x2019; etc. What is meant here by Behemoth? The comparison with the Paradise of Milton could be linking it to a like poetical work. But the king is in such statements not always exact; he could have been mistaken even in the title. Would the <hi rend="italic">Leviathan</hi> of Hobbes perhaps be in question here? My friend Professor Preuss and I wait patiently upon your friendly instruction and intelligence&#x201D; (trans.). Frederick&#x2019;s essay &#x201C;De la litt&#xE9;rature allemande,&#x201D; as Varnhagen calls it, is untraced. Thomas Hobbes (<date when="1588-00-00">1588</date>&#x2013;<date when="1679-00-00">1679</date>), philosopher, author of <hi rend="italic">Leviathan, or the Matter, Forme, &#x26; Power of a Common-wealth, Ecclesiasticall and Civill</hi> (<date when="1651-00-00">1651</date>), <hi rend="italic">Behemoth: the History of the Causes of the Civil-Wars of England and of the Councels and Artifices by which they were Carried on from the Year <date when="1640-00-00">1640</date> to the Year <date when="1660-00-00">1660</date></hi> (first pbd. <date when="1679-00-00">1679</date>; first authorized edn. <date when="1682-00-00">1682</date>). Johann David Erdmann Preuss (<date when="1785-00-00">1785</date>&#x2013;<date when="1868-00-00">1868</date>), German historian; see <ref target="volume-15/lt-18421024-TC-AJS-01"><sic>15:146</sic><corr>TC to AJS, <date when="1842-10-24">24 Oct. 1842</date></corr></ref>.</note> I had a copy of it, and read it twice some years ago; but at this moment it has fallen aside, and I must speak from memory. It is properly a <hi rend="italic">historical Essay</hi> on the late Civil Wars, which had driven Hobbes out of England; it takes a most sceptical atheistic view of the whole Quarrel; imputes it all to the fury of the Preaching Priests, whom and indeed all Priests and babbling Religionists of every kind Hobbes thinks the Civil Power ought to have coerced into silence, or ordered to preach in a given style. In this manner, thinks he, the troubles had all been prevented; similar troubles may again be prevented so. He speaks little about Cromwell; rather seems to admire him, as a man who did coerce the Priests, tho&#x2019; in a fashion of his own;&#x2014;this leads me to suspect that your King had never seen the actual Book, but spoken of it from hearsay. It is a most rugged, distinct, forcible little Book, by a man of the creed and temper above indicated; I remember it gave me the idea of a person who had looked with most penetrating tho&#x2019; unbelieving eye upon the whole Affair, and had better pointed out the epochs and real cardinal-points of this great quarrel than any other contemporary whom I had met with.&#x2014;&#x2014; I know not whether this will suffice for Herr Preus<supplied>[s]</supplied>&#x2019;s<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> object and yours: but if you need more precise instruction, pray speak again; it is very easy to be had to any extent. Nay I think it would not be difficult to pick from the Old-Book Stalls a copy of the Book itself: but indeed there is a new Edition of all Hobbes&#x2019;s works lately published, in which the <hi rend="italic">Behemoth</hi> is duly included,&#x2014;Sir W<hi rend="italic">m</hi> Molesworth&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Edition of Hobbes</hi>;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">The English Works of Thomas Hobbes of Malmesbury</hi>, ed. Sir William Molesworth, 11 vols. (<date when="1837-00-00">1837</date>&#x2013;<date when="1845-00-00">45</date>).</note> which is probably in one of your Public Libraries by this time.</p>
    <p><pb id="pg-19-52" n="19:52"/>I send you an Autograph of Thomas Babington Macaulay, a conspicuous Politician, Edinburgh-Reviewer, Rhetorician, and what not among us at present.

An old foolish story circulates concerning Oliver Cromwell: how when the king, in <date when="1647-00-00">1647</date>, was negociating between the Army and the Parliament, he had promised to make Oliver an Earl and Knight of the <hi rend="italic">Garter</hi>; how Oliver did not entirely believe him; got to understand that he was writing a letter to his Queen, which was to go off on a certain afternoon, sewed into the pannel of a saddle, by a Courier from an Inn in London: how Oliver thereupon, and his son-in-law, on that certain afternoon, <hi rend="italic">disguised themselves as troopers</hi>, proceeded to the specified Inn, gave the Courier a cup of liquor, slit open the saddle, found the Letter, and there read,&#x2014;&#x201C;Fear not, my Heart; the <hi rend="italic">garter</hi> I mean to give him is a hemp rope.&#x201D; Whereupon &#x26;c &#x26;c. This story, of which we have Oil Pictures, Engravings, and a general ignorant belief current among us, I have for a long time seen to be mere <hi rend="italic">Mythus</hi>; and had swept it, with many other such, entirely out of my head. But now a benevolent gentleman writes to me that, for certain, I shall get evidence about it, in Sir James Mackintosh&#x2019;s papers,&#x2014;sends me even a long memoir on the subject. Macaulay has Sir James&#x2019;s Papers at present: I forward to Macaulay the long memoir; requesting <hi rend="italic">him</hi> to burn it, if, as I conclude, he has and can have no evidence to confirm the story.

Macaulay replied that &#x201C;Mr. Mackintosh&#x2019;s memory has misled him. &#x2026; The story is incredible &#x2026; a mere romance.&#x201D;</note>&#x2014;&#x2014; It is astonishing what masses of dry and wet rubbish do lie in one&#x2019;s way towards the smallest particle of valuable truth on such matters!

    <p>Peel is considered to have done a great feat in getting a Grant of Money (a much increased Grant) for the Catholic College of Maynooth in Ireland.<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sir Robert Peel (<date when="1788-00-00">1788</date>&#x2013;<date when="1850-00-00">1850</date>; <ref target="volume-19/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/21764"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), the prime minister, had introduced a bill, <date when="1845-04-03">3 April</date>, to provide &#xa3;30,000 for buildings and an annual grant increased from &#xa3;9,000 to &#xa3;26,360 for the R. C. College of Maynooth, founded <date when="1795-00-00">1795</date>. After the bill&#x2019;s second reading, <date when="1845-04-11">11</date>&#x2013;<date when="1845-04-18">18 April</date>, it passed in Commons, <date when="1845-05-21">21 May</date>, and in Lords, <date when="1845-06-16">16 June</date>. Peel introduced another bill, <date when="1845-05-09">9 May</date> (passed <date when="1845-07-10">10 July</date>), to establish nondenominational colleges in Belfast, Cork, and Galway, allowing middle-class catholics the educational advantages formerly available only to protestants and better-off catholics. In Ireland the R. C. bishops denounced it as a scheme for &#x201C;godless&#x201D; education. James Spedding wrote to his brother, Thomas, about TC, <date when="1845-04-15">15 April</date>: &#x201C;I touched him upon Peel again, and tried to get an opinion that he was a truly veracious character. &#x2026; But I could get no confirmation. He admits that Peel has veracity <hi rend="italic">in</hi> him but then nothing but falsehood comes <hi rend="italic">out</hi> of him. And he will not allow it to be doubted that this is wrong.&#x201D; Spedding also noted that TC was increasing his comments on Cromwell&#x2019;s letters and speeches: &#x201C;He discovers that if he goes on &#x2026; the book will be far bigger than he can afford, and does not know what to do.&#x201D; See K.

<p>Have you studied Lord Nugent&#x2019;s account of the violation of Hampden&#x2019;s Grave,&#x2014;a horrible business.

Jane is pretty well too; getting better as the season gets on.

I had not seen him for four or five years. Last time he was as gay in his colours as a humming-bird&#x2014;blue satin cravat, blue velvet waistcoat, cream-coloured coat, lined with velvet of the same hue, trousers also of a bright colour, I forget what; white French gloves, two glorious breast pins attached by a chain, and length enough of gold watch-guard to have hanged himself in. To-day, in compliment to his five more years, he was all in black and brown&#x2014;a black satin cravat, a brown velvet waistcoat, a brown coat, some shades darker than the waistcoat, lined with velvet of its own shade, and almost black trousers, one breast-pin, a large pear-shaped pearl set into a little cup of diamonds, and only one fold of gold chain round his neck, tucked together right on the centre of his spacious breast with one magnificent turquoise. Well! that man understood his trade; if it be but that of dandy, nobody can deny that he is a perfect master of it, that he dresses himself with consummate skill! A bungler would have made no allowance for five more years at his time of life; but he had the fine sense to perceive how much better his dress of to-day sets off his slightly enlarged figure and slightly worn complexion, than the humming-bird colours of five years back would have done. Poor D&#x2019;Orsay! he was born to have been something better than even the king of dandies. He did not say nearly so many clever things this time as on the last occasion. His wit, I suppose, is of the sort that belongs more to animal spirits than to real genius, and his animal spirits seem to have fallen many degrees. The only thing that fell from him to-day worth remembering was his account of a mask he had seen of Charles Fox [(<date when="1749-00-00">1749</date>&#x2013;<date when="1806-00-00">1806</date>), whig politician] &#x2018;all punched and flattened as if he had slept in a book.&#x2019; / Lord Jeffrey came, unexpected, while the Count was here. What a difference! the prince of critics and the prince of dandies. How washed out the beautiful dandiacal face looked beside that little clever old man&#x2019;s! The large blue dandiacal eyes, you would have said, had never contemplated anything more interesting than the reflection of the handsome personage they pertained to in a looking-glass; while the dark penetrating ones of the other had been taking note of most things in God&#x2019;s universe, even seeing a good way into millstones&#x201D; (Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi> 1:299&#x2013;301).<lb/><lb/>
D&#x2019;Orsay wrote to TC, <date when="1845-04-30">30 April</date>, about C. C. F. Greville&#x2019;s book (probably his <hi rend="italic">Past and Present Policy of England Towards Ireland</hi> [<date when="1845-00-00">1845</date>]), which he had sent TC, adding: &#x201C;I hope that you &#x2026; advance with Cromwell you must make one Book of the whole.&#x201D;</note> Perhaps he will add a <pb id="pg-19-55" n="19:55"/>few words more before sending it off.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>The Mail Steamer is going towards you today: and tho&#x2019; seldom in my life in greater haste than even now, I must write you a small word acknowledgement for your welcome Letter of News,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dated <date when="1845-03-14">14 March</date>.</note> which arrived last week. I sent it on towards Annandale, directly after Jack had seen it; and there too, no doubt, it would create thankfulness and joy.</p>
<p>We are very well pleased with your accounts of yourself; of John&#x2019;s daughter&#x2019;s marriage, and your tea party, and the good wife&#x2019;s determination <pb id="pg-19-57" n="19:57"/>to have new chairs (which was very proper in her!),<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Janet Carlyle, eldest da. of TC&#x2019;s half-brother, John Carlyle (<date when="1792-00-00">1792?</date>&#x2013;<date when="1872-00-00">1872</date>; see <ref target="volume-01/lt-18180902-TC-JCE-01"><sic>1:139</sic><corr>TC to JCE, <date when="1818-09-02">2 Sept. 1818</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400815-TC-AC-01"><sic>12:228</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1840-08-15">15 Aug. 1840</date></corr></ref>), m., <date when="1844-12-25">25 Dec. 1844</date>, a joiner named Ellis. Alexander and Janet Carlyle had attended the wedding and soon thereafter invited the young couple to visit them. In preparation, Alexander wrote, his wife had prompted him to buy six &#x201C;room&#x201D; chairs, a rocking chair, a new bed &#x201C;of the couch kind,&#x201D; and &#x201C;a small breakfast table made of pear-tree wood&#x201D; for $12.</note> and of all your marketings and cares and industries in that new home. There was one Letter about &#x2018;the Street&#x2019; to Brantford, and all your neighbours, which was very entertaining. I have got a map of Canada; found out your place, and can now in some measure figure various elements of your position. Perhaps I shall see the place one day! Who knows? They are always asking me to come across: and now I have a real motive, if opportunity do ever serve!&#x2014; Go on and prosper, my dear Brother. You cannot overrate the satisfaction it gives me to hear of your well-doing. If it please God, you shall now reap the fruit of many bitter trials you have had in this world: it is the use of <hi rend="italic">suffering</hi> to us, which we are all born to, here below.&#x2014; Markets seem but indifferent; much, I can readily believe, is very cross and perverse: but a man that <hi rend="italic">can</hi> till his Mother Earth, and has a piece of Earth to till;&#x2014;it is a great fact for a man at present. Courage! All grows smoother, more obedient to us, just as we expend our wisdom and valour and worth upon it. All things do. Your good health is an immense point; which let us all be thankful for; which do you yourself take every care of, and prize as it merits.</p>
<p>From Annandale the news, I rejoice to say, are good. Our brave old Mother seems to have stood the winter well, and the Spring, which latter has been one of the hardest ever seen. Today even it is cold as December all but the Sun;&#x2014;a poisonous east wind blowing. Jamie seems busy draining &#x26;c: Isabella is very poorly still. Mary complains a little; but Jack thinks her getting better. Perhaps you notice in the <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi> that Puttock is again to let. M&#x2019;Adam demands some &#xa3;20 (if I remember) of abatement. I got Stewart of Gillenbie to take charge of letting the place; told him what M&#x2019;Adam was;&#x2014;desired that <hi rend="italic">he</hi> would do what was fit<supplied>[t]</supplied>est,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> and not to speak to <hi rend="italic">me</hi> of it, in my present terrible hurry! He undertakes; and I have no thought about the matter. Plenty else to think about!</p>
<p>In fact I have Printers clanking away at my heels; and such a confusion going about me and within me as no other man. It is the ugliest job in reality I ever had. But it <hi rend="italic">is</hi> getting on; a fourth part of it printed: far more than <hi rend="italic">half</hi> done: I shall rejoice to be rid of it for one! Nothing but my love for Oliver could carry me thro&#x2019; such an ocean of confusions; money could not hire any man to it. I send you a leaf or two of Proof papers. In some three months more I shall see daylight thro&#x2019; it, I hope: one of my anticipated <pb id="pg-19-58" n="19:58"/>pleasures then is packing up a Copy of it with other bits of things for a certain Farmhouse in the Brantford region! I wish we were but at that!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I think sometimes really of getting a horse as you advise: it will depend on the effect of West wind on me, from which I expect great things. In fact I am wonderfully well, considering. Jane has been but poorly all winter; recovering now. She sends her love to you all. My blessing with you dear Brother. <closer><salute>Ever yours</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dearest Babbie</salute>
<p>I said that I would write yesterday <hi rend="italic">good willing</hi> but god was <hi rend="italic">not willing</hi> and the manner of it was thus&#x2014;on the preceding night I had <hi rend="italic">five grains of mercury</hi> (!) introduced into my interior <hi rend="italic">by mistake</hi>&#x2014;instead of <hi rend="italic">one half grain</hi> the quantity I am in the habit of taking at one time&#x2014;and which is quite <hi rend="italic">enough &#x201C;for anything&#x201D;</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech.</note>&#x2014; So much for my husbands <hi rend="italic">false refinement!</hi> I had been wretchedly bilious for some days and sent him to Alsop&#x2019;s<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Alsop, 15 Sloane Sq.</note> for <hi rend="italic">my</hi> blue pills&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">he</hi> also being in the practise of getting pills there&#x2014;of <hi rend="italic">five grains</hi>&#x2014;which he swallows from time to time &#x201C;in <foreign>werra</foreign> desperation&#x201D; (as you know) and in fellowship with an ocean of Castor oil&#x2014;the pills came and I swallowed one; merely wondering why they had sent me only <hi rend="italic">three</hi> instead of my customary <hi rend="italic">dozen</hi>&#x2014;but ten minutes after when I became deadly sick I understood at once how it was Carlyle frankly admitted it was quite likely there had been a mistake&#x2014;&#x201C;when he went into the shop a gentleman was with Alsop and he <hi rend="italic">did not like</hi> to say <hi rend="italic">send the blue pills for Mrs Carlyle</hi> but said instead send the blue pills <hi rend="italic">for our house</hi>&#x2014; Alsop of course had prefered the <hi rend="italic">masculine gender</hi> as grammatically bound to do&#x2014;and so was <hi rend="italic">delicacy</hi> another person&#x2019;s &#x2018;own reward&#x2019; All yesterday I was sick enough you may fancy&#x2014;for I felt too weak to deliver myself from the confounded stuff thro a great doze of physic&#x2014;I thought it safest to let it work away there in the unfortunate <hi rend="italic">interior</hi> of me until it had its humour out&#x2014; Carlyle comforted himself and tried to comfort <hi rend="italic">me,</hi> by suggesting that &#x201C;it might possibly do me <hi rend="italic">a great deal of good</hi> in the long run&#x201D;!

JWC took the child to Cheyne Row after leaving a message at the police station, and it was collected in the evening by &#x201C;a grown-up sister.&#x201D; The young woman, unidentified, whom JWC had met once before, arrived at Cheyne Row while the child was there: &#x201C;I have a strong prejudice against women &#x2018;in such a situation&#x2019; in the abstract. It indicates such stupidity. But this poor woman in the concrete, covered with crimson and tears, went to my heart like a knife. &#x2026; A greater contrast could not be &#x2026;&#x2014;that two-year-old duddy child, drowning its recent sorrows in bread and butter &#x2026; and that elegantly dressed young lady. &#x2026; At last she went away, consoled a little by my kindness perhaps; but as for my &#x2018;advice,&#x2019; though I gave her the best, she will not of course follow a syllable of it.&#x201D;</note>&#x2014; But these topics are too long to be entered on&#x2014;with a &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">neat Fly</hi>&#x201D; looming in the prospect&#x2014;and not only a <hi rend="italic">programme</hi> but a <hi rend="italic">map</hi> of my <hi rend="italic">calls</hi> to be drawn out beforehand that I may not as you and I once were be placed at the disposal of an idiot-driver&#x2014; Besides Carlyle has today a blue pill and a doze of Castor in him and when that is the case I feel always a certain degree of what Helen would call &#x201C;real mental agony in my own inside.&#x201D; Which is not propitious to long stories&#x2014; For the rest; I keep quite free of cough but my head bothers me excessively and I feel often as weak as the stuttering Darley<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Darley (<date when="1795-00-00">1795</date>&#x2013;<date when="1846-00-00">1846</date>; <ref target="volume-19/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/7151"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), poet and playwright; see <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410307-TC-HTA-01"><sic>13:50</sic><corr>TC to HTA, <date when="1841-03-07">7 March 1841</date></corr></ref>.</note> did in the relaxing heat of Munich&#x2014;where he reminded himself of &#x201C;a Serpent trying to stand on its tail&#x201D;&#x2014;a more striking picture of human weakness could hardly have been given!&#x2014; I am always breakfasting in bed still!

<p>I am happy to apprise you the <hi rend="italic">Schiller Portrait</hi> has arrived at last: an excellent Copy in Pencil from the best (and as appears the only good) Portrait there is of him in Germany. I have an autograph also, and a Medal and a Medallion:&#x2014;in short the materials of a proper Likeness are here; and I will beg of you to take pains and get a right Artist to manage the Engraving (for the credit of the Country);<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Varnhagen wrote, <date when="1845-03-19">19 March</date>, in reply to <ref target="volume-19/lt-18450216-TC-KAVE-01">TC to KAVE, <date when="1845-02-16">16 Feb.</date></ref>: &#x201C;Concerning the portrait of Schiller, I must say &#x2026; that I know of no medallion of Schiller and that a connoisseur friend assures me that no <hi rend="italic">good</hi> one exists. &#x2026; On the other hand, we have a small relief in gypsum that is very carefully made after Dannecker&#x2019;s colossal bust; I will send it to you very soon in a small casket, and also one such of Goethe. However, I will wait eight or ten days before doing so because I hope to be able to send along a small drawing upon which I must place great value. You know that Schiller had a noble lady friend, Frau von Kalb; she died here a few years ago in the castle at a great age. In her remains I found a portrait of Schiller which was drawn in Dresden at the time of Schiller&#x2019;s stay in the K&#xF6;rner family; the daughter of Frau von Kalb &#x2026; has permitted me to have this extremely expressive, strikingly like portrait&#x2014;a portrait not yet published in Germany&#x2014;copied for you. A good artist has promised me the copy within that space of time. As soon as I have it, I will send it over to you with the gypsum reliefs. Now may all arrive in good enough time to correspond to your wishes&#x201D; (trans.).

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I am well; we are all well,&#x2014;and a good wind blowing out of the West, to our general comfort now;&#x2014;but so busy am I! Never in my life so busy. I have spurred the Printers into a dreadful rate of speed, and I must not cry &#x201C;Slower!&#x201D;&#x2014;or they will fall all aback again. So we must gallop along. Two months of this galloping will bring me handsomely thro&#x2019; I hope;&#x2014;and then we shall deserve a little relaxation, and a sight of Annandale before the Sun end!&#x2014;</p>
<p>You must take this smallest scrap of tidings, dear good Mother, as better than none. And send me some of yourself.&#x2014; I wrote to Alick by the last Mail. Jack should have written to you last week; but he tells me he did not. Busy, busy!&#x2014;</p>
<p>On Saturday Night I had three redhot Irish Repealers here; one of them, Duffy, a fellow Prisoner of O&#x2019;Connell&#x2019;s,&#x2014;a really interesting young man. Full of zeal, of talent and affection; almost <hi rend="italic">weeping</hi> as he spoke of his poor country,&#x2014;and taking <hi rend="italic">this</hi> plan for relief of it, poor fellow! They are all sworn disciples of <hi rend="italic">mine</hi>, they say; which astonished me beyond measure. They came to complain of my unfairness to Ireland; I had called them &#x201C;all liars and thieves,&#x201D; which was hard talking!&#x2014;&#x2014; I liked this poor Duffy very much. They are all ready for &#x201C;insurrection,&#x201D; for &#x201C;death&#x201D; &#x26;c &#x26;c I strongly advised them to make a general insurrection <hi rend="italic">against the Devil</hi> first of all, and see what came of that!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC wrote in her notebook, <date when="1845-04-27">27 April</date>: &#x201C;Last night we had a novelty in the way of society, a sort of Irish <hi rend="italic">rigg</hi>. Mr. L<supplied>[ucas]</supplied> came in before tea with a tail consisting of three stranger Irishmen&#x2014;real hot and hot live Irishmen, such as I have never before sat at meat with or met &#x2018;in flow of soul,&#x2019; newly imported, with the brogue &#x2018;rather exquisite,&#x2019; and <foreign><hi rend="italic">repale</hi></foreign> &#x2018;more exquisite still.&#x2019; They came to adore Carlyle, and also remonstrate with him, almost with tears in their eyes, on his opinion, as stated in his &#x2018;Chartism,&#x2019; that &#x2018;a finer people than the Irish never lived; only they have two faults: they do lie and they do steal&#x2019; [cf. <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 29:137]. The poor fellows got into a quite epic strain over this most calumnious exaggeration. (Pity but my husband would pay some regard to the sensibilities of &#x2018;others,&#x2019; and exaggerate less!)<lb/><lb/>
&#x201C;The youngest one&#x2014;Mr. Pigot&#x2014;a handsome youth of the romantic cast, pale-faced, with dark eyes and hair, and an &#x2018;Emancipation of the Species&#x2019; melancholy spread over him&#x2014;told my husband, after having looked at and listened to him in comparative silence for the first hour, with &#x2018;How to observe&#x2019; written in every lineament, that now he (Mr. Pigot) felt assured he (my husband) was not in heart so unjust towards Ireland as his writings led one to suppose, and so he would confess, for the purpose of retracting it, the strong feeling of repulsion with which he had come to him that night. &#x2018;Why, in the name of goodness, then, <hi rend="italic">did</hi> you come?&#x2019; I could not help asking, thereby producing a rather awkward result. Several awkward results were produced in this &#x2018;nicht wi&#x2019; Paddy.&#x2019; They were speaking of the Scotch intolerance towards Catholics, and Carlyle as usual took up the cudgels for intolerance. &#x2018;Why,&#x2019; said he, &#x2018;how <hi rend="italic">could</hi> they do otherwise? If one sees one&#x2019;s fellow-creature following a damnable error, by continuing in which the devil is sure to get him at last, and roast him in enternal fire and brimstone, are you to let him go towards such consummation? or are you not rather to use all means to save him?&#x2019;<lb/><lb/>
&#x201C;&#x2018;A nice prospect for you to be roasted in fire and brimstone,&#x2019; I said to Mr. L<supplied>[ucas]</supplied>, the red-hottest of Catholics. &#x2018;For all of us,&#x2019; said poor L<supplied>[ucas]</supplied>, laughing good-naturedly; &#x2018;we are all Catholics.&#x2019; Nevertheless the evening was got over without bloodshed. &#x2026; While they were all three at the loudest in their defence of Ireland against the foul aspersions Carlyle had cast on it, and &#x2018;scornfully&#x2019; cast on it, one of their noses burst out bleeding. It was the nose of the gentleman <supplied>[O&#x2019;Hagan]</supplied> whose name we never heard. &#x2026; The third, Mr. D<supplied>[uffy]</supplied>, quite took my husband&#x2019;s fancy, and mine also to a certain extent. &#x2026; With the coarsest of human faces, decidedly as like a horse&#x2019;s as a man&#x2019;s, he is one of the people that I should get to think beautiful, there is so much of the power both of intellect and passion in his physiognomy. As for young Mr. Pigot, I will here &#x2026; make a small prediction. If there be in his time an insurrection in Ireland, as these gentlemen confidently anticipate, Mr. Pigot will rise to be a Robespierre. &#x2026; / All these Irishmen went off without their hats, and had to return into the room to seek them. &#x2026; I have now seen what Sir James Graham would call &#x2018;fine foamy patriotism,&#x2019; <foreign><hi rend="italic">dans sa plus simple expression</hi></foreign> [in its simplest expression]&#x201D; (Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi> 1:307&#x2013;10).

She is no longer handsome, but full of intellect and kindness blended gracefully and lovingly together. Among a hundred interesting things which she told us, [some were remarks about Tennyson]. &#x2026; Of Miss Barrett she has a low &#x2026; opinion. She says <hi rend="italic">she</hi> could not read her, and that C<hi rend="overscore">a</hi>rlyle (so she pronounces his name) advised the poetess to write prose! &#x2026; / We had a long talk about Ireland, of which he has wrong notions, but not unkindly feelings, and we came away at eleven o&#x2019;clock at night, delighted with the man and woman.

    <p>I have likewise to thank you for your kind purpose of sending me the <hi rend="italic">Nation</hi> Newspaper;&#x2014;the first N<hi rend="italic">o</hi> of which, indeed, I find, has safely introduced itself thro&#x2019; the Rowland-Hill<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Rowland Hill (<date when="1795-00-00">1795</date>&#x2013;<date when="1879-00-00">1879</date>; <ref target="volume-19/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/13299"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), originator of the penny post.</note> slit in the door this day. As I have very little time, and especially at present hardly read any Newspaper, it would be a farther kindness if you now and then marked such passages as you thought would be most illuminative for me.</p>
<p>I can say with great sincerity I wish you well; and the essence of your Cause well,&#x2014;alas, if one could get the <hi rend="italic">essence</hi> of it extricated from the adscititious confusions and impossible-quantities of it, would not all men wish you and it right well!

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I am very glad to have you for a reader: a sincere and earnest man in all places and conditions is very precious to me.</p>
<p>Your scheme of cheap Books has been suggested to me from various quarters, and very clearly corresponds to my own wishes in the matter; but unfortunately the decision of it does not rest with me. The Booksellers declare against it; I know nothing about trade; and hesitate to attempt working out a mere conviction of my own in that matter,&#x2014;having besides work enough in provinces that do belong to me.</p>
<p>The price of Books at present, so far as Books have any real worth for the culture of men, is certainly a great evil. Rather more than a half of the whole selling-price of a Book falls into the hands of the man and men who do the mere act of selling it. This is a fact which I learned with amazement some years ago, and have not ceased to reflect upon occasionally since. The charge of 55 per cent for selling any article, by any mode of sale, is certainly enormous. Nay what is worst of all, the greater part of it is expended in puffing into sale Books that are worthless, or making up for loss on Books that no puffing can sell: the poor individual Bookseller makes nothing of it; he very generally becomes bankrupt in the business, poor man. It is in fact a mad affair. But what shall we say? The origin of it is even this, The faith men have in puffing, the cowardly <hi rend="italic">haste</hi> all men are in to get their goods sold, their worth acknowledged, and their work paid for, in a day,&#x2014;as if there were but one Day; as if there were no continuance of Time, and of Eternity behind Time! The origin of the thing lies <hi rend="italic">deep</hi>, and is the fatal origin of many things among us; and will not be capable of cure, I doubt, for a while.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-19-70" n="19:70"/>As for you, if you are short of Books you would like to read, believe me on my word and experience, It is not such an evil as your fancy represents it. One little page read well is worth many volumes carelessly run over. My reverence for Books does not increase with my years. My reverance for earnest reflexion and meditation, above all things for honest manful conduct (which is the great source of clearness of vision too for us all) does go on increasing.</p>
<p>May good be with you in your Business and in your Life outward and inward.</p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>If you happen to know, in any old Pamphlet or contemporary Book or record, a direct indication that Oliver Cromwell did live in Moray House during his second visit too,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For Cromwell&#x2019;s first visit to Edinburgh, <date when="1648-00-00">1648</date>, and residence at Moray House, Canongate, Edinburgh, see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 6:382&#x2013;83. TC had apparently learned this from <hi rend="italic">Chambers&#x2019; Edinburgh Journal</hi>, <date when="1837-01-21">21 Jan. 1837</date>, cited in <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 6:383n. Not until <date when="1857-00-00">1857</date> did TC find any written confirmation of Cromwell&#x2019;s staying there further in <date when="1650-00-00">1650</date>; see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 7:271.</note>&#x2014;I should be very thankful for it now. There is certainly great likelihood that he lived there, as he had indubitably done before: but Oliver&#x2019;s history is so overlaid with brutal errors already, one would not wish, even on small matters, to add a shovelful to the dung-heap!&#x2014; &#x2014; I had the Coltness Collections above a year ago; was greatly amused by the <foreign><hi rend="italic">randy</hi></foreign> [lively] Scotch Lady; and found some curious glimpses of Cromwell, tho&#x2019; in a somewhat questionable condition.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For Margaret, b.

<salute>Dear Lockhart,</salute>
<p>Here is a Book which came for you today from Varnhagen von Ense, with some pretty compliments which I do not transcribe. His gratitude for your Autographs is great.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >K. A. Varnhagen von Ense, <hi rend="italic">Leben des F&#xfc;rsten Bl&#xfc;cher von Waldstadt</hi> (1st edn.

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Your Letter of the <date when="1845-05-07"><hi rend="italic">7th</hi> of May</date>, the first I have had from you for many years, arrived today only (tho&#x2019; it had not lingered in our London Post-Office): it would have been highly gratifying to me, but for the very sad piece of misfortune and mismanagement on somebody&#x2019;s part, which is too clearly indicated in it! I never received, or heard any notice whatever of the Goethe Manuscript:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably part of the MS of the Pt. 2 of <hi rend="italic">Faust</hi> now in the Goethe-Schiller-Archiv, Weimar; see Speck 750&#x2013;56; <ref target="volume-21/lt-18470629-TC-CKJB-01">TC to CKJB, <date when="1847-06-29">29 June 1847</date></ref>, and TC&#x2019;s letters to Eckermann in <date when="1848-00-00">1848</date>&#x2013;<date when="1849-00-00">49</date>. Following &#x201C;it&#x2019;s&#x201D; thus in MS.</note> what it&#x2019;s fate has been is to me altogether a mystery! The Booksellers Chapman and Hall, to whom you appear to have sent it, are in the habit of forwarding all manner of things to me, with sufficient punctuality; nor was I out of town last autumn at all, except for ten days: so that I have little expectation of any good tidings from their Establishment in reference to this precious missing object. I did walk over thither this evening, to assure myself by special inquiry, tho&#x2019; with almost no hope of benefit: but there<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> shop was shut before I got so far. I would not lose a Post, but inform you at once what the state of the matter is.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-19-73" n="19:73"/>My notion is there would not be much chance of a proper appreciation here at present for such an object: but certainly had it come to me, from such a hand as yours, I should have done what lay in me towards the disposal of it, and at lowest have instantly announced its arrival. The business now will be if possible to recover it,&#x2014;to get upon the trace of it. Wherein you will of course use all diligence; and if I can at all assist you here, I certainly will. There is no great likelihood that it is utterly destroyed: it must by lying buried somewhere; and diligence may unearth it again.</p>
<p>I am very glad to hear of another Volume of <hi rend="italic">Dialogues with Goethe:</hi> the former two have got a very fair Translation in America<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Conversations with Goethe</hi>, trans. S. Margaret Fuller (Boston, <date when="1839-00-00">1839</date>). The first two vols. of the <hi rend="italic">Gespr&#xE4;che mit Goethe</hi> were pbd. in <date when="1836-00-00">1836</date> and the third in <date when="1848-00-00">1848</date>.</note> and have been read with much acceptance among us here. A new Volume, any new Volume from you, shall be very welcome to me. Some tidings too of what has befallen you since I heard last would gratify me much.</p>
<p>I have had a busy heavy life here, much borne down with ill health too; and am at present again as busy or busier than I ever was with very ugly labour. It will end&#x2014;by and by! <closer><salute>Yours ever truly</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Booth,</salute>
    <p>There are three men that want to go into the House of Commons on Tuesday Evening next, to hear a little of the Balderdash current there,&#x2014;on the Medical Bill, I think.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably Sir James Graham&#x2019;s medical reform bill&#x2014;introduced <date when="1844-08-00">Aug. 1844</date>, reintroduced <date when="1845-02-25">25 Feb.</date> and <date when="1845-05-07">7 May</date> with changes&#x2014;aimed to centralized and unify medical education and practice. Initially opposed by general practitioners who thought it ranked them lower than physicians and surgeons, it was eventually also opposed by the latter. On <date when="1845-07-28">28 July</date> Graham put off consideration to the next session, when it was dropped. TC may possibly have meant a bill sponsored by Anthony Ashley Cooper (<date when="1801-00-00">1801</date>&#x2013;<date when="1885-00-00">85</date>; <ref target="volume-19/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/6210"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), Lord Ashley, to repeal many existing acts respecting the treatment of lunatics and insure that pauper patients were not improperly detained and that patients received medical visits and were allowed visits by friends. Neither bill, however, was considered on Tues., <date when="1845-06-10">10 June</date>, nor the next Tues.</note> These names and addresses are:</p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I am still kept terribly busy without leisure at any hour: but no haste can excuse my neglecting <supplied>[to]</supplied><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> announce the safe arrival of your bounties, which arrive in swift succession, and ought to be acknowledged in word as well as thought.</p>
<p>The tiny Package of the Schiller Valuables had survived without damage the hazards of its long journey: it arrived here, after not much delay, several weeks ago, &#x2014;just as the Printing of the Book was about completed: still in time. We admire much the new Portrait of Schiller. It was put at once into the hands of the Publisher; who, with all alacrity, set about engaging &#x201C;the best Engraver,&#x201D;&#x2014;whose name I do not know;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> whose quality I much insisted on; and whom, accordingly I suppose to be busy with the operation even now. Hitherto I have heard nothing farther; my Publishers live far off in the heart of the City and its noises; and all my locomotions at this period direct themselves towards the opposite quarter. But of course I expect to see a Proof before they publish: if the Artist do his duty, it will not fail of welcome from all parties. I would thank you and the kind Madam von Kalb for all your kindness;&#x2014;but you will not accept even of thanks. I suppose this must be the real Likeness of Schiller, in fact; whosoever spreads this abroad, to the gradual extrusion of the others, is doing a good thing! We have hung up the little medallions on the wall, where they shall many times remind us of you.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Helen Allingham, in <hi rend="italic">Carlyle&#x2019;s House Catalogue</hi> [<date when="1896-00-00">1896</date>] 102, noted that they hung on the N wall of the front dining room in <date when="1881-00-00">1881</date>.</note></p>
<p>Your <hi rend="italic">Life of Bl&#xfc;cher</hi> came next; which shall solace my earliest leisure;&#x2014;and which in the meanwhile does not lie idle, but gets itself read with acceptance in the house. I forwarded the Copy to Mr Lockhart: I had by chance seen him the night before. He is not, and has not been, so poorly in <pb id="pg-19-76" n="19:76"/>health as your news had reported: a man of sharp humours, of leasible nerves; he complains somewhat, but is recovering;&#x2014;a tough, elastic man. It is a strange element for a man, this London of ours; and the voice of what is called &#x201C;Literature&#x201D; in it gets more and more into the category of <hi rend="italic">Jargon</hi> if you be a little in earnest in this world! Were there not something better <hi rend="italic">meant</hi> than all that is <hi rend="italic">said</hi>, it were a very poor affair indeed. &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Verachtung, ja Nicht-Achtung</hi></foreign> [Contempt, yes disrespect]&#x201D;: that really is the rule for <hi rend="italic">it</hi>.</p>
<p>My poor Book on Cromwell will, if the Fates permit, get itself disengaged from the Abysses by and by.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC&#x2019;s printer, George Levey of Levey, Robson &#x26; Franklyn, had written to him <date when="1845-05-31">31 May</date>, calculating how the two vols. of <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> should be divided and how many pages were still to be expected. TC figured it out for himself, noting: &#x201C;Certainly Mr Levey is quite wrong in his estimate of the quantity of Cromwell Mss. &#x2026; This is my estimate of the Speeches according to the type we are at present proceeding with&#x2014;Two pages of it to one large page of mine&#x201D; (Yale MSS).</note> It is very torpid, after all that I can do for it; but it is authentic, indisputable; and earnest men may by patience spell out for themselves the lineaments of a very grand and now obsolete kind of man there! What else is the use of Writing? To explain and encourage grand dumb Acting, that is the whole use of speaking, and Singing, and Literaturing! That or nearly so.&#x2014; Good be with you my dear Sir. <closer><salute>With many thanks and regards Yours ever truly</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Sir</salute>
<p>This morning the Bookseller called with a Proof of the <hi rend="italic">Engraving of Schiller</hi>, and with this Autograph which he has now done with. The Engraving seemed to me tolerably good; but you will have an opportunity yourself of judging before long.

Our weather has grown hot as Sahara; my press of confused business rolls along more bewildering than ever,&#x2014;and has to transact itself in this tumult of tumults; as if a man should sit down to collect his scattered thoughts in the inside of a kettle-drum!

<salute>Dear Jenny,</salute>
<p>Your good news from Dumfries were, as you expected, very welcome to me. I am right glad poor Jean has got her task over and a little Margaret<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jean Aitken&#x2019;s second da.</note> into the bargain. Give her my kind congratulations, and the small stranger my best wishes: tell the Mother I expect to hear from herself when once she is fairly better.</p>
    <p>The Doctor went away from us on Tuesday last. I think he was a little desirous to quit London; being somewhat out of health lately: and at the right time there came for him a sudden call to go North into Durham and visit medically the Mr Raine he was with about the Christmas time.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Rainey (<date when="1801-00-00">1801</date>&#x2013;<date when="1884-00-00">84</date>; <ref target="volume-19/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/23026"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), anatomist (called Raine by TC and John Carlyle); see <ref target="volume-17/lt-18430807-TC-JWC-01"><sic>17:21</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1843-08-07">7 Aug. 1843</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-18/lt-18441227-TC-JCA-01"><sic>18:297</sic><corr>TC to JCA, <date when="1844-12-27">27 Dec. 1844</date></corr></ref>.</note> So he set off very swiftly (it was on <hi rend="italic">Wednesday</hi> morning), and I, happening to be out when he called here, did not so much as see him. I had a short Note yesterday, that he had got safe; found Mr Raine not quite so ill as he expected, and was in the mind seemingly to stay there for a while. It is much better quarters than here at this season. He has &#x201C;a little carriage&#x201D; to himself: the Country is green and bright and silent; not the horrible noisy whirlpool of hot dust that London now is! I should not wonder if he came along to Annandale next. But I fancy he will write to some of you. I sent him a little Note tonight with your news. His Address is, &#x201C;&#x2014;Raine Esq, Pilmore House, Darlington.&#x201D;</p>
<p>We are into the Second Volume, my Printers and I; but have still a good ugly lump of work to do. I doubt it will be above two months yet. I am <pb id="pg-19-78" n="19:78"/>getting very sick of it; but must hold on. The weather too is now against me: frightfully hot! However, I have actually got myself a swift black horse; and I take a long excursion into the cool fields every evening. That in general is all the exercise I get thro&#x2019; the day: all company I as much as possible avoid. Better or worse, the Book shall and must be done!</p>
<p>Jane flourishes in the hot weather; she is now very well. I hope our Mother too is doing well; I should like much to hear of Mary and her again. &#x2014; We have an Edinburgh Cousin of Jane&#x2019;s here, a son of her Uncle Robert&#x2019;s; a very great Grampus indeed:&#x2014;it is hoped he will take himself away in the course of another week!</p>
<p>Be careful of Jean till she is well again. Tell her then to write. My kind love to one and all. I have heard nothing from Scotsbrig this long while. <closer><salute>Good night, dear Jenny. Yours always</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>John, who is gone Northward as his own Letter will explain, has appointed me to add a few words for you by this Mail: I take a little minute before going to bed tonight, as tomorrow there will be no leisure at all, and send you my brotherly salutation accordingly. My time at present, as it has been for these many months, is hardly any minute of it my own: I never in my life was held busier; and now the hot weather too has come to lame me still farther.</p>
<p>We were all much gratified with your last Letter; a clear healthy tone breathes thro&#x2019; it, and we see you busy, and what we can well call prosperous in your new enterprise,&#x2014;for a man that embarks himself on any enterprise in that spirit, and perseveres so, may be said to be prospering in it. Go on, my dear Brother; and every year will add its little stock of fruit to your store of good manful possessions, and you will gradually grow rich in <pb id="pg-19-82" n="19:82"/><hi rend="italic">true</hi> wealth.&#x2014;&#x2014; I have had one little Note out of Scotland since Jack went away: it was from Jenny at Dumfries to say that Jean had just been safely delivered of a little Daughter, and that both she and it were doing well. They have called the little creature Margaret: Jenny had been there waiting for the event for some weeks. Our good old Mother, pretty well in health, was in the interim waiting at the Gill. She will now very soon be home at Scotsbrig when she hears that Jack is coming. Jamie&#x2019;s Isabella is said to be still as poorly as ever; &#x201C;unable to speak except in whispers&#x201D;; really a very heavy handful for poor Jamie and for herself. Except Ben Nelson&#x2019;s death,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ben Nelson (<date when="1783-00-00">1783</date>&#x2013;<date when="1845-00-00">1845</date>), merchant, died <date when="1845-06-04">4 June</date> at George St., Annan; see <ref target="volume-01/lt-18210109-TC-JAC-01"><sic>1:304</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1821-01-09">9 Jan. 1821</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-17/lt-18430805-TC-JAC-01"><sic>17:11</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1843-08-05">5 Aug. 1843</date></corr></ref>.</note> of which I get no particulars hitherto, there was no other news from Scotland. Poor Ben, I believe, was falling into drink besides all other miseries: perhaps it is a mercy that his days were not prolonged in this world.&#x2014; I might mention also, what is only like a piece of country news to myself, for I could take little or no hand in the operation,&#x2014;that Craigenputtock is let to Macqueen, and Macadam is fairly out of it;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Macqueen (d. <date when="1849-00-00">1849</date>), previously tenant of Craigenputtoch; see <ref target="volume-04/lt-18270414-TC-JWC-01"><sic>4:203</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1827-04-14">14 April 1827</date></corr></ref>, <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340522-JWC-TC-01"><sic>7:179&#x2013;180</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1834-05-22">22 MAy 1834</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380214-TC-JA-01"><sic>10:23</sic><corr>TC to JA, <date when="1838-02-14">14 Feb. 1838</date></corr></ref>. Joseph M&#x2019;Adam.</note> which is a result I am glad of. James Stewart and the Factor Adamson did the whole without troubling me about it; for I absolutely had no time at all for such a business. The rent I think is &#xa3;180, big house and all. But I do not well know;&#x2014;and really cannot much care at present: the place and its concerns are not lovely to me.</p>
<p>I have got a horse according to your advice! Often I thought of you, when this business was on hand: I had no Alick to buy a horse for me now! A benevolent friend<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Kenworthy Browne (<date when="1816-00-00">1816</date>&#x2013;<date when="1859-00-00">59</date>), close friend and companion of FitzGerald&#x2019;s; a prosperous, gentlemanly, open-air character, from Bedford; m., <date when="1844-00-00">1844</date>, Elizabeth Elliott; injured in hunting accident, <date when="1859-01-00">Jan. 1859</date>, and died, <date when="1859-03-30">30 March 1859</date>.</note> of these parts undertook it for me:&#x2014;a very smart horse, a gelding of six years, black, long-tailed, high and thin,&#x2014;swift as a roe; reminds me of poor <hi rend="italic">Larry</hi> in some of his ways, tho&#x2019; better bred than Larry.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Carlyle family horse, <date when="1825-00-00">1825</date>&#x2013;<date when="1831-00-00">31</date>; see <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310508-TC-JAC-01"><sic>5:272</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1831-05-08">8 May 1831</date></corr></ref>.</note> the price of him was &#xa3;35; would be very dear in Dumfries. I ride two hours every day; and really hope to get benefit by and by,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; the effect hitherto is rather an <hi rend="italic">increase</hi> of biliousness; which I am told is common in such cases. I really have been kept terribly busy and much harrassed all Spring and Summer; I long very sincerely indeed to be thro&#x2019; this affair, and out into the Country again!</p>
<p>But alas we are still a good way from that. The first volume is fairly done and printed: but we have hardly the fifth part of the Second ended yet. I think it may be three months almost before I am fairly off. However, the <pb id="pg-19-83" n="19:83"/>Book does prove a little better than I expected; and will perhaps be of some use by and by; which is a kind of consolation. Did you get a fraction of a leaf of it, with some little Note of mine? I think I sent you such a thing: I did not see in your last Letter any notice that it had arrived.</p>
<p>Jane has recovered greatly since the weather grew fairly warm. We have it now hot enough, after long months of barren cold. The people are all mowing, a heavy crop of fine natural hay, as I ride abroad thro&#x2019; the field lanes here: the smell of it is sweeter than any perfume to me. I ride alone; strive to keep out of people&#x2019;s way as much as possible.</p>
<p>Dear Brother, you too I suppose are broiling away at field-labour in the Canadian heat. I am very glad to learn that you are got more moderate; violent working was always one of your faults. And the little <foreign>Bairns</foreign> are at their schooling; and Jenny is busy within doors; and you, as head of the house, have many cares;&#x2014;and God&#x2019;s fair sky bends over all. May His blessing be with you, dear Alick, you and all dear to you! And so good Night.&#x2014;<closer><salute>Your affectionate Brother,</salute></closer></p>
<name>T. Carlyle</name>
<ps><p>Jane sends her affectionate regards to you and all of you. When <hi rend="italic">little</hi> Jane takes the pen in hand, I do not see why she should not write a line to her Namesake here.&#x2014;</p></ps>

<salute>Dear Sir</salute>
<p>I learn from various quarters that my name stands upon some Book that you are now publishing. I know not well what Book it is: but I know very well there is no Book published by you, and indeed never was any, on which my <hi rend="italic">name</hi> has or had the smallest shadow of authority to stand. I therefore request with all distinctness that you will at once and altogether remove it from the said Book whatever that be; and be so considerate as not to append it henceforth in any similar case.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William and Charles Tait had pbd.

<salute>Dear Fitzgerald,</salute>
<p>The Horse, I believe, does me on the whole some essential good; for I ride him two hours daily, about six times every week, and see the green fields by means of him: but at bottom he is still rather a dangerous piece of goods for me! He improves in strength; has excellent paces (when he likes to put them forth), hoofs of brass; is fleet as a roe;&#x2014;neither do I think the creature has any radical vice or ill-nature in him: but he is in fact <hi rend="italic">unbroken;</hi> and would require to be ridden half a year by a man far more expert than I am in the delicacies of that business, and with far more <hi rend="italic">time</hi> than I have at present to attend to the whims of such an animal. He has &#x201C;decided preferences&#x201D; as to the roads he wishes to go; needs occasionally to be <pb id="pg-19-87" n="19:87"/>forcibly flogged and kicked along, or he will not go at all;&#x2014;goes then, as the Scotch say, like a cat travelling on hot iron!&#x2014; He has never got me off him again; but once or twice has, at a careless moment, approached that result. The day before yesterday, to ease my long legs I had got the stirrups lengthened a hole; and twice over was very nearly in the dirt;&#x2014;some explosion of a start, at something, at nothing,&#x2014;the pace a walk. I was glad to dismount, and shorten my stirrups again.&#x2014; On the other hand, yesterday I had a most glorious view of Richmond Park<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On the Thames, 10 mi. WSW of Chelsea.</note> in the <date when="1845-06-00">june</date> sunshine, by means of this poor brute! So stands the account balanced.</p>
<p>On the whole, I think of asking you by and by to ask Brown<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >W. K. Browne.</note> to take him away from me again,&#x2014;to sell him or buy him; and leave me to crawl along on <hi rend="italic">two</hi> feet again. I am so overwhelmed with confusion and Printers&#x2019; Devils in these weeks I really have no moment to bestow on anything. For which reason too I have never yet got Brown&#x2019;s money lodged with his City Banker, but it still lies <hi rend="italic">here</hi> in the shape of Bank Notes merely;&#x2014;I have no Banker of my own nearer than Dumfries, cannot <hi rend="italic">ride</hi> into the City on such mounting, cannot get leave to go; and have daily been expecting some man <hi rend="italic">with</hi> a Banker who could do the business instead of me.</p>
<p>Oliver is now made <hi rend="italic">Protector</hi>&#x2014;God be thanked! I know the <hi rend="italic">Iter Carolinum</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Iter Carolinum, Being a Succinct Relation of the necessitated Marches, Retreat and Sufferings of his Majesty, Charles the First, from &#x2026; <date when="1641-00-00">1641</date>, till &#x2026; <date when="1648-00-00">1648</date></hi> (<date when="1660-00-00">1660</date>).

He meant to have illustrated them but by a few words of his own to each letter; but he finds he cannot say a little on matters so near his heart; so that the book swells to two volumes; time runs away; and the bookseller, whose contract was for Carlyle&#x2019;s few words, will get too many in for his bargain; which is not a pleasant consideration to any Scotchman&#x2019;s heart. Don&#x2019;t suppose Carlyle is a <foreign>screw</foreign> [stingy person]; a sense of Justice, and equal balance, and fair wages for fair work, etc. is at the bottom of these scruples in him and many other Scotchmen&#x201D; (Terhune, <hi rend="italic">LEF</hi> 1:497). TC had told James Spedding the same; see <ref target="volume-19/lt-18450407-TC-KAVE-01">TC to KAVE, <date when="1845-04-07">7 April</date></ref>.</note>&#x2014;a very wooden piece the last.</p>

<salute>Dearest Uncle</salute>
<p>I have a small piece of family news, and &#x201C;I feel it my duty&#x201D; (as Sir James Graham says when stating the most superfluous things) &#x201C;to communicate it&#x201D; to the Head of the family direct&#x2014; Finding myself the other day tired of my life and in need of what Helen calls &#x201C;a fine change&#x201D;; I flung myself into an Omnibus to be carried away into the remote regions of the City, where I might get out and enjoy a <hi rend="italic">solitary</hi> walk&#x2014;for the solitude of the peatbog at Craigenputtoch was hardly more <hi rend="italic">solitary</hi> than that of a great neverending thorough-fare where there is not a human being to be met with that one ever saw before or that knows or cares the least in the world about oneself.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>In a hurried moment, on one of the little bits of Paper fluttering copiously round me, I write my salutations. We are well; my horse does me good,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; a very wild fellow; whom I think of parting with, were this hurry over. Weather cool, often wet. I am getting steadily on with my Book, tho&#x2019; there yet remain six good weeks of it. I will then run for the Country,&#x2014;for poor old Scotland, I intend. Jack has sent you all the news. Tom&#x2019;s Letter, which I saw lately only, was admirable to us here! Tell him to write again, the rugged Son of Earth,&#x2014;and little Jane too. The greater Jane, stronger in the summer time, salutes you all.</p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>

<p>The Translations,&#x2014;to whomsoever they now belong, for that is uncertain to me at present,&#x2014;are much at your service.

<p>My hurry and confusion for these many months past have been extreme; but I hope to be thro&#x2019; this present enterprize in some six weeks now;&#x2014;and I sometimes think I shall then quit <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> and these Puritan Lumber-books for good.</p>

<p>I could not see you. They tell me you are not well too. The Housemaid said you were better; but did not seem to know much about it. Why will you dine at 7 o&#x2019;clock, and waste yourself with the frivolities of this generation? Are you of no value to any one, then!&#x2014; I wish we were all safe at Alverstoke,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Bay House, the Barings&#x2019; seaside villa nr. Gosport, Hants.</note> reading German, or sitting silent; far from all noise that had no meaning in it. I wish you were well again, at least!&#x2014;</p>
<p>My wife returned in much satisfaction with Addiscombe and her visit,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; she had slept but three hours all the time, and could not make much <pb id="pg-19-96" n="19:96"/>way into new acquaintanceship in that sad state of the nerves! You will come and see us here when you come back, &#x2014;will you not?</p>
<p>I saw you on Wednesday for half a moment, and did not know clearly till after you were past. On Constitution-Hill<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Between Buckingham Palace and Hyde Park Cor.</note> about four o&#x2019;clock. I must make that serve for a week. It is the brightest star in all the week&#x2019;s firmament, perhaps the only star there;&#x2014;let me be thankful for it, poor little star! I am really worn to death; and very sick of most things.</p>
<p>Good night. The old Chelsea clock is striking midnight: the sun is right under our feet, and wet winds are blustering,&#x2014;and the quantity of insane confusion in this world is very great. Shall we ever have wings, think you? <foreign><hi rend="italic">Ach Gott!</hi></foreign>&#x2014; I send you blessings as ever, and the best Good night.</p>

<p><salute><hi rend="small-caps">My Dear Mother</hi>,&#x2014;</salute>My hurry is 
indeed great, but it ought to be greater than it is before I neglect writing you a little word <hi rend="italic">this</hi> week as I did last. I am whipt about from post to pillar at a strange rate in these weeks.</p>
<p>Jack&#x2019;s visit to you was a welcome piece of news here. The good account he gave of you was much wanted. We are very sorry indeed to hear of poor Isabella. It seems as if nothing could be done for her, and her own weakness and suffering must be very great. Jamie is kind and patient, you may assure him of our sympathies.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Carlyle wrote, <date when="1845-07-13">13 July</date>, that &#x201C;Isabella had removed upstairs as I recommended &#x26; become a little better.&#x201D;</note> A sudden turn for the better may take place, I understand, as of its own accord all at once. Let us keep hoping the best.</p>
<p>The back of this sorrowful Book is now broken. I think another month of stiff labour will see it well through. They are printing away at the second volume&#x2014;about half done. I have to go along amid endless confusions, the way one has to do in all work whatsoever. The Book will, on the whole, be better than I hoped, and I have had some honest thoughts in the writing of it which make me the more careless what kind of reception the world gives it. The world had <hi rend="italic">better</hi> try to understand it, I think, and to like it as well as it can! Here is another leaf of a proof sheet to be a token to you of our progress. So soon as ever it is over I am off for Annandale. The heat has <pb id="pg-19-97" n="19:97"/>never been very oppressive to me, never violent beyond a day or two at a time, then rain comes and cools it again. I get considerable benefit of my horse, which is a very darling article, black, high, very good natured, very swift&#x2014;and takes me out into the green country for a taste of that almost every day. I sometimes think of <hi rend="italic">riding</hi> it up into Annandale, but that will be too lengthy an operation.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Margaret Carlyle wrote from the Gill, Wed. [<date when="1845-06-00">June</date> or <date when="1845-07-00">July</date>]: &#x201C;You have had a long and sore struggle with your Book. &#x2026; I am some what afraid of your black horse do not ride fast there is less danger. &#x2026; I hope to see you when you get done with your Book.&#x201D;</note></p>
<p>Jane is going to Liverpool to her Uncle&#x2019;s in a fortnight. She will stay with them a week, then another week with some country friends in that quarter. I wished her to go to Scotland and see old friends there at Haddington and elsewhere, but she is rather reluctant to that. She is not very strong and has many sorrows of her own, poor little thing, being very solitary in the world now. In summer however she is always better.</p>
<p>I have heard nothing from Jack of late days. I suppose him to be still at Mr. Raine&#x2019;s.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Carlyle had left George Rainey, <date when="1845-07-10">10 July</date>, for Leamington, saying that &#x201C;he had got a good deal better, &#x26; I seemed unable to do more for him.&#x201D;</note> Perhaps uncertain whitherward he will go next. At any rate country is better than town at present,&#x2014;free quarter than board-wages. I expect he will come back to you again before the season end.</p>
<p>We were out at a place called Addiscombe last week among great people, very kind to us, but poor Jane could sleep only about an hour each night&#x2014;three hours in all. I stayed but one night, came home on my black horse again. Some peace and rest among green things would be very welcome to me&#x2014;and it is coming soon, I hope. <foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Mother&#x2014;my kind love to you and to all of them. I am in great haste and can speak but a few words to mean much by them. <closer><salute>My blessings with you.</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dearest M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Russell</salute>
<p>I wonder how you are all going on at Thornhill&#x2014;it is so long that I have had no news of you. Do write&#x2014;there is nothing you ever tell me that is not deeply interesting; there is not a tree or a stone about Thornhill that I should not like to hear about, never to speak of the <hi rend="italic">people!</hi>&#x2014;</p>
<p><pb id="pg-19-98" n="19:98"/>For us here; we go on in much the old fashion&#x2014;my Husband always <hi rend="italic">writing</hi>&#x2014;I always <hi rend="italic">ailing</hi>&#x2014;which is perhaps the most laborious business of the two, tho&#x2019; yielding less result&#x2014; I was confined four months to the house during winter and spring, taking care of a cough&#x2014;but it went when the warm weather came&#x2014; Since then however I have never felt to have got back even my usual limited amount of strength and spirits&#x2014;so I am going to try what people call &#x201C;a change&#x201D;&#x2014; My Husband is going to Scotsbrig so soon as his weary book is completed which he expects will be in the course of next month&#x2014;and he has been very urgent on me to go to Scotland also, and even without waiting his time which will be rather late in the season. But I do not fancy the object of my going from home would be attained by encountering so much painful emotion as a visit to a country made so desolate for me would excite. I have tried to bring my mind to it&#x2014;but it will not do&#x2014; So I am going to Liverpool some ten days hence&#x2014;and then to Seaforth a place in the neighbourhood belonging to a favourite friend of mine&#x2014;where I enjoy the inestimable advantage of being <hi rend="italic">let alone</hi>&#x2014; My uncle and Jeanie start for Helensborough again on the <date when="1845-08-01">first of August</date> and would have had me go <hi rend="italic">there</hi> with <hi rend="italic">them</hi>&#x2014;but on one hand there was the sea voyage which occasions me such horrible suffering that only the hope of seeing my Mother at the end of it ever could make me undertake it&#x2014;or if I went by land I must have passed thro Dumfriesshire&#x2014;stayed some days at Scotsbrig&#x2014;and the notion of all that was too sad&#x2014; If there were any positive duty to be accomplished by going to Scotland I hope I would not be so weak as to let the pain of it withhold me&#x2014; But going there merely to recover my <hi rend="italic">strength</hi> and <hi rend="italic">spirits!</hi>&#x2014; No no it would be labour worse than lost.</p>
<p>I had my Uncle Roberts eldest Son<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John May Welsh.</note> here for two or three weeks lately&#x2014; He wrote me a letter about &#x201C;natural affection&#x201D; and all that sort of thing, which was taking me on my weak side&#x2014;and as he stated moreover his intention of coming to see London&#x2014;I was simple enough to invite him <hi rend="italic">unknown</hi> and <hi rend="italic">unseen</hi> to take up his quarters here,&#x2014;tho pretty well aware in the secret of my heart that the sudden development of his &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">natural affection</hi>&#x201D; for me had just this for its object, to get himself invited&#x2014; And so he came and in my life I was never more thankful when a visit ended&#x2014;for a young gentleman full of selfcomplacency, and Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> logic, and without the faculty of being <hi rend="italic">still</hi> for two minutes of his existence together was no joke in a household like ours. He is not a bad fellow at heart nor stupid&#x2014;but he has grown up in the idea that he cannot possibly be <foreign>de trop</foreign> in any environment&#x2014;and that <hi rend="italic">his pleasure</hi> is to be the law of the Universe&#x2014;so far as he <pb id="pg-19-99" n="19:99"/>can make it so&#x2014;and <hi rend="italic">his opinion</hi> the dominant opinion of the times! Then he was out and in&#x2014;in and out; at all hours, like a <hi rend="italic">dingledoozy!</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;&#x2018;Dingle-dingle-doosie / The cat&#x2019;s a&#x2019; loosie, / The dog&#x2019;s i&#x2019; the well; / The Dad&#x2019;s away to Edinbro&#x2019; / To buy the <foreign>Bairn</foreign> a bell!&#x2019; Nurse takes a small splint or quill of half-burnt wood from the fire, whirls it about so that the <hi rend="italic">red</hi> end of it makes circles or meandering ribbons (all of <hi rend="italic">fire</hi>, to the child&#x2019;s eye), singing or crooning as above. No finer metaphor in the world to signify an aimless, restless, uselessly busy person!&#x2014;T. C.&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note to JWC&#x2019;s journal, <date when="1856-04-17">17 April 1856</date>, A.

Oh Heaven defend me thro all coming time from young gentlemen educated in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> who come to London to see sights! Hating <hi rend="italic">sights</hi> myself I have no sympathy with the passion some people put into seeing them.</p>
<p>I saw a very curious sight the other night, the only one I have been to for a long while&#x2014;<foreign>viz</foreign>: some thousands of the grandest and most cultivated people in England all gazing in ecstasy, and applauding to death, over a woman, not even pretty, balancing herself on the extreme point of one great toe, and stretching the other foot high into the air&#x2014; Much <hi rend="italic">higher</hi> than decency ever dreamt of! It was <hi rend="italic">Taglioni</hi> our chief dancer at the Opera,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Marie Taglioni.</note> and this is her chief feat repeated over and over to weariness&#x2014;at least to <hi rend="italic">my</hi> weariness&#x2014;but Duchesses were flinging <hi rend="italic">bouquets</hi> at her feet&#x2014;and not a man (except Carlyle) who did not seem disposed to fling <hi rend="italic">himself</hi>.

<p><hi rend="italic">Monday</hi> is my birthday&#x2014;how fast they come these birthdays of mine! and how little are they marked by any good done&#x2014; <hi rend="italic">I</hi> cannot even balance myself on the point of my great toe!&#x2014;but <hi rend="italic">that</hi> perhaps is not much to be regreted!&#x2014; I send rememb<supplied>[rances]</supplied> for Mary and Margaret<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mary Mills (d. <date when="1854-00-00">1854</date>) and Margaret Hiddlestone (d. <date when="1865-00-00">1865</date>), Grace Welsh&#x2019;s servants.</note>&#x2014;for Mary <hi rend="italic">tea</hi>&#x2014;to Margaret perhaps you had better give the money in case she might like some other little thing better&#x2014;</p>

<p><salute>Alas, my dear Sir,</salute> I am still here in the depths of Old-English Stupor, and the <foreign><hi rend="italic">guano</hi></foreign>-dust of Past Blockheads; deep still in Oliver&#x2019;s Correspondence, namely; and cannot taste the Highland breezes on the hillsides, or the Hospitalities of kind friends!

<salute>Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I had your Letter from Leamington;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1845-07-13">13 July</date>.</note> which I was very glad of. I wrote to <pb id="pg-19-102" n="19:102"/>Scotsbrig a word or two last week; I have heard nothing thence but what you tell me.</p>
<p>My work here goes on as it can; not in the most triumphant manner: but it is drawing towards completion now; the better half of the second volume is printed. In about a month, after one or two hard bouts of wrestling with difficulties that yet remain, I expect to be free. I am then for Scotland instantly.&#x2014; I ride diligently every day; long stretches of swift riding: last evening I was at Dulwich.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >S of the Thames, ca. 7 mi. SE of Chelsea.</note> My horse is excellent of quality; but somewhat indifferently broken, which feature of the business has given me some trouble, but the evil is pretty well cured now. I suppose the animal must be doing good to my health; keeping me from being so ill as I should have been: but the first effect, as I am told it is always in horse-exercise, is to shake abroad all the biliary sediments in one, and develope the results of them on the surface. When my Book is done, I shall want to get rid of the horse in some good way. I wish I could <hi rend="italic">fly</hi> him into Annandale with me.</p>
    <p>The Addiscombe visit did very well; except that on poor Jane&#x2019;s part it had to pass almost totally <hi rend="italic">without sleep</hi>. I was there only for one night. The Barings are for Scotland, the Highlands &#x26;c, so soon as the Parl<hi rend="italic">t</hi> rises, and wish to meet me there; which I think will be difficult to bring about.&#x2014;Jane is going off early next week to Liverpool and for certain other visits in that quarter. Her Uncle goes to Scotland at the <date when="1845-08-00">beginning of August</date>; she wants to stay a week with him first: she goes then to the Paulets;&#x2014;and then possibly into N. Wales, to visit a certain Miss Wynne,&#x2014;niece, I think, of the illustrious Sir Watkin,&#x2014;at some Squirearchal House called Lllan&#x2014;I know not what, not very far from Oswestry in Shropshire. Miss W. is a friend of Varnhagen&#x2019;s, a far-off friend of mine this long while; a very elegant intelligent and well-conditioned Lady, still beautiful tho&#x2019; now advancing towards a certain age.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charlotte Williams Wynn (<date when="1807-00-00">1807</date>&#x2013;<date when="1869-00-00">69</date>; <ref target="volume-19/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/30151"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), diarist, eldest da. of Charles Watkin Williams Wynn (<date when="1775-00-00">1775</date>&#x2013;<date when="1850-00-00">1850</date>; <ref target="volume-19/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/30150"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), politician, M.P. for Montgomeryshire, <date when="1799-00-00">1799</date>&#x2013;<date when="1850-00-00">1850</date>, of Llangedwin, Denbighshire, N Wales, and niece of Watkin Williams Wynn (<date when="1772-00-00">1772</date>&#x2013;<date when="1840-00-00">1840</date>), 5th bart.

She had known Varnhagen since <date when="1836-00-00">1836</date> and was friendly with many distinguished people, including Bunsen, Maurice, and the Carlyles. She noted a visit to the latter, <date when="1845-05-04">4 May</date>: &#x201C;I went to Cheyne Row on Monday to tea; Carlyle was very pleasant. It was very interesting to hear his account of his visit to the Bishop of St. David&#x2019;s, his feelings about morning prayers, &#x26;c., which he attended, he said, because he had no right to go to a bishop&#x2019;s house and not conform to his ways&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Memorials of Charlotte Williams Wynn</hi> [<date when="1877-00-00">1877</date>] 59).</note> Her father is a perpetual invalid; used to be well known in Parl<hi rend="italic">t</hi>. Jane and she made acquaintance at Milnes&#x2019;s, one morning; a breakfast of Milnes&#x2019;s. I fancy the visit will do. Poor Jane has much need of country or some such thing: she is very feeble, and often dispirited.</p>

<salute>Dear Christie,</salute>
<p>Many thanks for your Excerpt,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The unpbd. passage from Ludlow&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Memoirs</hi>.</note> which I have now put beyond the risk of loss.</p>
<p>Before the Sheet go finally out my hands can you tell me more expressly where the <hi rend="italic">Locke Ms</hi>. of Ludlow&#x2019;s Suppressed-Passages now is? Is &#x2018;L<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Lovelace&#x2019; a man of the Present or of the Past; are the Papers still in his hands?<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The passages in the hand of the philosopher John Locke (<date when="1632-00-00">1632</date>&#x2013;<date when="1704-00-00">1704</date>) were owned by William King (<date when="1805-00-00">1805</date>&#x2013;<date when="1893-00-00">93</date>), 1st Viscount Ockham and 1st earl of Lovelace (<hi rend="italic">Cromwell, Works</hi> 8:258n).</note></p>
<p>Also, Are you <hi rend="italic">perfectly</hi> certain that the &#x2018;last Assembly&#x2019; means Oliver&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">first</hi> Elected Parliament, and not his second and last (<date when="1566-00-00">1566</date>&#x2013;<date when="1567-00-00">7</date>),<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mistake for <date when="1656-00-00">1656</date>&#x2013;<date when="1857-00-00">57</date>.</note> in which the question of his Kingship came on? Have you discovered anywhere at what time precisely Ashley Cooper was dismissed the Council? Mackworth and he appear to have been in <hi rend="italic">together</hi> (Thurloe III. 581); Mackworth <hi rend="italic">died</hi> in about half a year after his appointment,&#x2014;died seemingly in autumn <date when="1654-00-00">1654</date>.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Humphrey Mackworth (d. <date when="1654-00-00">1654</date>), lawyer, soldier, and gov. of Shrewsbury; see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 8:258&#x2013;59n.

The latter considered restoring monarchy, <date when="1656-03-00">March</date>&#x2013;<date when="1656-05-00">May 1656</date>, which Cromwell refused and became lord protector again, <date when="1657-06-00">June 1657</date>. Ashley Cooper was in Cromwell&#x2019;s council of state from <date when="1653-11-00">Nov. 1653</date> and attended his last council meeting, <date when="1654-12-18">18 Dec. 1654</date>.</note> Ludlow was in Ireland all that while.</p>
<p>Ashley I think is not in very declared opposition till Oliver&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">last</hi> Parl<hi rend="italic">t;</hi><note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ashley Cooper was elected M.P. by <date when="1656-09-00">Sept. 1656</date>, but not allowed to take his seat.

<p>Thanks, <salute>dear little Wifie</salute>, for your delightful little Letter. I can make no return; I am solitary here from all mortals and their business,&#x2014;terribly busy too; and have now got a good lump of &#x201C;Copy, please&#x201D; completed. Here are my Correspondences,&#x2014;all but a Letter from W. Dugald Christie M.P. inviting me to breakfast! The Addiscombe Invitation I mean to comply with;&#x2014;go off at four this day (half an hour hence, and still in my dressing-gown!); I shall probably, certainly if I do not sleep, return tomorrow. The Lady Harriet, they told me, was at Alverstoke (where you are to <pb id="pg-19-110" n="19:110"/>go) all the week.&#x2014; Fitzgerald called one night (Thursday): off to Ireland, for an Uncle that is thought to be d<supplied>[y]</supplied>ing there.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >FitzGerald was in London for two days before going to Ireland to his seriously ill uncle, Peter Purcell (d. <date when="1846-05-24">25 May 1846</date>), at Halverstown, Kilcullen, co. Kildare, <date when="1845-07-27">27 July</date>&#x2013;<date when="1845-08-16">16 Aug.</date> (Terhune, <hi rend="italic">LEF</hi> 1:xli, 501&#x2013;2). FitzGerald wrote to a friend, <date when="1845-08-15">15 Aug.</date>: TC &#x201C;told me that he had done so much for the illustration of Cromwell&#x2019;s letters etc. that he doubted if he should ever write any further Life of him. So get this; it is sure to have much more good than bad in it. I told C. that the more I read of Cromwell the more I was forced to agree with the verdict of the world about him. Carlyle only grunted and sent forth a prodigious blast of tobacco smoke. He smokes indignantly&#x201D; (Terhune, <hi rend="italic">LEF</hi> 1:503&#x2013;4).</note> Returns in three weeks,&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">perhaps</hi> we shall go a-touring Northward together. He is a good fellow, Fitzgerald; smokes his pipe beside one very much like a gentleman. Yesterday I rode to my beloved Hampstead: dim grey day; all green, still, and beautiful;&#x2014;very swiftly home. Today at last, after rain, there has come out a glimmer of sun.</p>

<p><salute>Dear little Goody,&#x2014;</salute>Thy clever bits of Letters are a great cordial to me; equal to sparkling champagne in a forenoon, and much wholesomer! I do indeed require a word of encouragement; being very much &#x201C;detached&#x201D; in my solitary workshop here.</p>

We did well enough&#x2014;considering. The first night I slept wretchedly ill; got up however and had a long gallop in the morning, over the beautifullest breezy downs, thro&#x2019; shady lanes &#x26;c &#x26;c, which did me an immense good; last night I slept pretty well, till at half past seven, the man came to me;&#x2014;I was here, safe home, with the day&#x2019;s exercise laid in too, soon after nine. All right with the little busy bee;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Helen Mitchell.</note> who is still white-washing extensively. She has got me a fowl; cut it in four, and is boiling soup.&#x2014; My visit was not, in these circumstances, the very best of joys; but one ought to be content with it. I had a great deal of talk with Everett; who surprises one much,&#x2014;as a thorough drawling Yankee in manner, yet with intelligence and real gentlemanhood looking thro&#x2019; it.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Everett wrote to his sister, <date when="1845-08-02">2 Aug.</date>: &#x201C;We had Mr. Carlyle of the party, who appears to be a great favorite with Lady Harriet, Mr. Baring&#x2019;s wife. I have seen but little of Carlyle. He is somewhat plain, not to say rustic in appearance, and speaks with a broad Scotch accent. He talks very much as he writes; and as he is voluble and ready with his opinions on all subjects, it is quite amusing to hear him. His views, I think, are rather paradoxical and not very clearly fixed in his own mind. There is a strong tendency to radicalism, but I doubt if it is accompanied with any specific notions of reform. He thinks very highly of Mr. Emerson, but did not appear to be an admirer of any other of the American Transcendentalists. &#x2026; He thinks Cromwell the greatest man who ever lived. He appeared to entertain a very high opinion of General <supplied>[Andrew]</supplied> Jackson, whom he called &#x2018;Old Hickory&#x2019;: and he does not think very unfavorably of Lynch Law, regarding it as a necessary substitute, among a frontier population, for the regular administration of justice. &#x2018;Lynch,&#x2019; he said, &#x2018;was far from being the worst of magistrates&#x2019;&#x201D; (P. R. Frothingham, <hi rend="italic">Edward Everett Orator and Statesman</hi> [<date when="1925-00-00">1925</date>] 249).</note> We got to the top of no haystacks this time: the Lady seemed somewhat wearied; had only just returned from Alverstoke, had missed railway trains &#x26;c. Your friend L<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Ashburton had been taken very ill, poor man,&#x2014;some sudden fit of cholic or other biliary business, somewhat alarming for the time: that had been the occasion of the journey. We had grey windy weather;&#x2014;I had about half my sleep:&#x2014;and here I am again, scribbling in my place as before, &#x201C;done thee neither ill na&#x2019; guid.&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>
<p>It is pity one can get so little benefit of Invitations to the Country. Look at this from Milnes again; and tell me what you think of it! If one could cut oneself into four, as the French say, and go visiting with benefit in four <pb id="pg-19-112" n="19:112"/>places at once, it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be a beautiful thing!&#x2014; Ah me, of the things that are in this life, how many are there that &#x201C;I do not need,&#x201D; how many that &#x201C;I cannot get&#x201D;&#x2014;and <hi rend="italic">so</hi> have ceased to need! Let us be content.&#x2014; By the bye I ought to tell you of Pedant Senior, that <hi rend="italic">seeing me there,</hi> he came up in the most cordial manner to shake hands; and we even had a quantity of smoking together, and philosophical discoursing together, by motion of his,&#x2014;with unabated aversion of mine. Peace to him.</p>
<p>I will get covers tomorrow, tonight; I will write a kind of Letter soon,&#x2014;if I can. Yet why a Letter? Do thou write,&#x2014;thou with the time and the faculty! I will read; it is my function at present.&#x2014; Poor Plattnauer is difficult to read; seems rational enough otherwise: perhaps it is as well for him to return to Clayton; Germany I suppose has not many such for him. <hi rend="italic">Dugald</hi> Christie called yesterday when I was away; no other. Today I heard old Krasinski inquiring your Address:<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Count Walerjan Skorobohaty Krasinski (<date when="1780-00-00">1780</date>&#x2013;<date when="1855-00-00">1855</date>), Polish <foreign>&#xE9;migr&#xE9;</foreign>; see <ref target="volume-16/lt-18430705-JWC-TC-01"><sic>16:233</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1834-07-05">5 July 1834</date></corr></ref>.</note> a letter is likely&#x2014; There I think, literally at this moment, is Darwin!

I am then bound for Scotland, to see my good old Mother once again in this world; can yet set no time for that or anything; and do not promise myself to accomplish any farther expedition till a new season come.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-19-113" n="19:113"/>Shall I not see you again before you go? If you had a horse, and would come and ride with me some day, a great deal of pleasant talk might be accomplished!

<salute>Dearest</salute>
<p>They are all gone to Church, and I am here alone, enjoying &#x201C;Virtues (<hi rend="italic">Roman <foreign><hi rend="small-caps">Virtus&#x2019;s</hi></foreign></hi>) own reward.&#x201D; My Uncle at the last minute came to me in the room where I had <hi rend="italic">fortified</hi> myself (<hi rend="italic">morally</hi>) and asked with <hi rend="italic">a certain</hi> enthusiasm; &#x201C;are you not going to Church?&#x201D;&#x2014; &#x201C;No&#x2014; I have no thought of it.&#x201D;&#x2014; &#x201C;And why <hi rend="italic">not?</hi> (crescendo).&#x201D;&#x2014; &#x201C;Because your minister is a ranting Jackass that cracks the drum of ones ears&#x201D;!&#x2014; &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Who</hi> told you <hi rend="italic">that</hi>? (stamping like my grandfather)&#x201D;&#x2014; &#x201C;I do not choose to compromise anyone by naming my authority&#x201D;&#x2014; &#x201C;And what has <hi rend="italic">that</hi> to do with going to <hi rend="italic">a place of Worship?</hi>&#x201D;&#x2014; &#x201C;nothing whatever, but it has a great deal to do with <hi rend="italic">staying away</hi> from a place that is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> &#x201C;of Worship&#x201D;.&#x201D; He looked at me over his spectacles for an instant as if doubtful whether to eat me raw, or laugh&#x2014;and &#x201C;E<hi rend="italic">ventually</hi>&#x201D;&#x2014;thanks God!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech, a Mazzini-ism.</note>&#x2014;he chose the better part. The girls who came, in fear and trembling, to pick up my fragments, were astonished to find that I had carried the day. We get on famously my Uncle and I&#x2014;by dint of <hi rend="italic">defiance</hi> tempered with <hi rend="italic">kisses</hi> I can manage him better than anyone else does. Our trip accross the water on Friday extended itself into an excursion to Hoylake<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coastal village in Cheshire; see <ref target="volume-17/lt-18430801-TC-JWC-01"><sic>17:4</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1843-08-01">1 Aug. 1843</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014;a seabathing place beside that West Kirby which Walter Macgregor used to talk about<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Nr.

We arrived at home in the evening as hungry &#x201C;as&#x2014;as&#x2014;anything&#x201D;! and found one, M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Mackorkedale,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly Hugh McCorquedale of Liverpool (d. <date when="1848-00-00">1848</date>).</note> come to dine on his own invitation&#x2014;whom I mention on account of&#x2014;his shoes! they weigh three pounds and a half, are three quarters of an inch thick in the sole, and what <hi rend="italic">you</hi> would call &#x201C;shaped like a <pb id="pg-19-114" n="19:114"/>human foot,&#x201D; that is to say like an enormous hoof. Like you this old gentleman is an enemy to <hi rend="italic">the March of Taste</hi>, and has after exhausting all the present modes of shoes, settled down into this realized Ideal of his own. He finds that he can walk fifteen miles aday in them; and has never so much as the reminiscence of a corn (at eighty two)&#x2014; Would you have his shoe-maker to construct you the like?&#x2014; He is a curious character this old Mackorkedale&#x2014;every way&#x2014; He flourished, in I know not what reign, as a fine gentleman&#x2014;had made money as &#x201C;a <hi rend="italic">merchant</hi> M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle&#x201D;&#x2014;lost it one day and became&#x2014;a tailor! his old friends employed him and continued to invite him to dinner. Now his family have got on in the world and he tailors no longer. He has &#x201C;winning ways&#x201D; even at eighty two&#x2014;but is now reduced to practicising them on Nursemaids and the like&#x2014; They tell that his too sensitive heart conceived only a few years ago a most tender passion for a housemaid of his own named Julia&#x2014; Julia gave warning and Mackorkedale took to his bed&#x2014;but that was not all; one day he fell on his knees to her, calling out;&#x2014; &#x201C;Julia Julia <hi rend="italic">can</hi> you quite us&#x201D;?&#x2014;and at that exactly unright moment M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> MacKorkedale came into the room!! &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">That</hi> minds me,&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech.</note> as Helen says&#x2014;Maggie, of all people in the world, told me a small specimen of <hi rend="italic">french sentiment</hi> which she had read somewhere&#x2014;worth repeating even to <hi rend="italic">you</hi>&#x2014;who have not all the sympathy with french sentiment that could be wished. An injured husband rushed in upon his wife and her lover, in an illfated moment, and was proceeding as in duty bound to kill the lover&#x2014;whereupon the wife threw herself frantically between them and passionately remonstrated &#x201C;Would you kill the Father of your Children?&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>
<p>Since my hand is in, I may as well tell you the only other thing I have heard that has made me <hi rend="italic">laugh</hi>&#x2014; You have seen or at least heard of James Grey&#x2014;son of Grey of the High school&#x2014;who married a Miss Brown here, a Poetess<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Gray (<date when="1770-00-00">1770</date>&#x2013;<date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>), Latin master at Dumfries Academy (where he was Robert Burns&#x2019;s friend) and at Edinburgh High School, <date when="1801-00-00">1801</date>&#x2013;<date when="1822-00-00">22</date>.

<p>Along with yours this morning came a letter addressed in the hand of Miss Clayton which proved to be from Plattnauer&#x2014; I shall send it, that you may see how things are with him&#x2014;if you like&#x2014;and what he did with the books<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Plattnauer wrote, [<date when="1845-07-16">16</date> or <date when="1845-07-18">18 July</date>], that Varnhagen was away &#x201C;at some watering place,&#x201D; so he had left the parcel (see <ref target="volume-19/lt-18450613-TC-KAVE-01">TC to KAVE, <date when="1845-06-13">13 June</date></ref>) with Count Konigsmark&#x2019;s servant. He was staying with his sister Hedwig and her husband Oskar von Reichenbach (see <ref target="volume-18/lt-18440912-JWC-JW-01"><sic>18:202&#x2013;3</sic><corr>JWC to JW, <date when="1844-09-12">12 Sept. 1844</date></corr></ref>): &#x201C;From the state of politics, and other things, it will be impossible to stay here at present, I will remain here as long as possible, but shall be in England &#x2026; before winter. They indeed try to persuade me to stay here for ever.&#x201D;</note>&#x2014;</p>
<p>I was thankful that you had the grace to write even that short letter this morning&#x2014;for the breakfast here does not &#x201C;pass off pleasantly&#x201D; if there be <hi rend="italic">no &#x201C;encooragment&#x201D;</hi> from without&#x2014;</p>
<p>Today you will be ascending hayricks&#x2014;and hearing &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">wits</hi>&#x201D; and living happily &#x201C;to the end of eternity&#x201D;&#x2014;and I hope you will have slept&#x2014;as to be sure you would when you had that nice bed all to yourself&#x2014; So today you are less to be pitied than <hi rend="italic">en-vied</hi>&#x2014; But tomorrow you will return in a state of&#x2014;what shall I say?<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech, a Mazzini-ism.</note>&#x2014;&#x201C;<hi rend="italic">collapse</hi>&#x201D;&#x2014;and then you will be all the better of this note &#x201C;to distract you&#x201D;!

<salute>Dear Jamie,</salute>
<p>It is a long time since I sent you any specific account of myself, or heard <pb id="pg-19-116" n="19:116"/>any word from you: a failure which is not wholly my fault, but my misfortune rather; for I have never in my life been so busy as of late.</p>
<p>The night before last I had a short Note from the Dr, enclosing one from you at Scotsbrig, which as it were forces me to write at present. My Mother, it appears, is unwell; you say she is on the mending hand; and I will not allow myself to be uneasy: but you must write to me directly a little word, never so short, to tell me how she <supplied>[is]</supplied><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> and what is the matter. I suppose it may be the cold weather; which is as intemperate as I ever knew weather in July. I will keep hoping the best: but you must not neglect to send me a single line or two, whenever this gets to hand. You have much sickness with you this season, and doubtless many cares: poor Isabella, I am sorry always to learn, continues in a very painful state. Nothing can be done, it seems; there is nothing for it but patience and hope.</p>
<p>Jane went away from me on Tuesday gone a week. She is in her Uncle&#x2019;s house still; but is preparing to remove to a place of some Country friends near Liverpool,&#x2014;a place called Seaforth, close by the shore, where I expect she will be more wholesomely lodged. Perhaps she will write to some of you one of these days. Her Uncle is for Scotland; goes to a place called Helenburgh near Greenock, with most of his family, on Thursday next. Jane thought of Scotland once; but dare not undertake it this season yet. She was in a weakish way, dispirited and sleepless often, when she left me: I urged her to go and try the country, which I think will do her good.</p>
<p>I have had <hi rend="italic">three</hi> Books printing all at once in these late months: two of them are now done, the second of them (which is a new Edition of <hi rend="italic">Past and Present</hi>) this very day; of the first (a new Edition of <hi rend="italic">Schiller&#x2019;s Life</hi>) I sent two copies towards Scotsbrig, which I think may have arrived.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >They had. James Carlyle replied, <date when="1845-08-02">2 Aug.</date>: &#x201C;Isabella wishes me to thank you for the one you sent her,&#x201D; adding, &#x201C;I think she is no worce for the last month.&#x201D;</note> The third Book, <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi>, is not yet done,&#x2014;a very <foreign><hi rend="italic">dreigh</hi></foreign> [wearisome] Book which has cost me more toil, real ugly labour, than any Book I ever had to do with. There is still a piece of hard work lying in it: but I ply at it now, tooth and nail, and the daylight does begin to shine thro&#x2019; it. The instant it is done, I am off towards Annandale as you know. I cannot yet set a day or a week; but it <hi rend="italic">must</hi> end before we be much older: surely another three weeks will break the back of it now!&#x2014; I am not so ill off in respect of health, as I hav<supplied>[e]</supplied><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> often been: I ride diligently every day; a biggish long-legged swift black horse, full of fire and action, tho&#x2019; very good-natured: he can take a gallop of 15 or 20 miles, thro&#x2019; the fine green regions hereabouts, and never mind it. He is a great burden to me, the obligation to ride him every <pb id="pg-19-117" n="19:117"/>day is; but also a great benefit, I believe. The weather is very cold and damp here; frequent showers, and northwinds: the people are struggling on with the fag-end of their hay yet; which is very late for them. I suppose you also are in your hay at present.&#x2014; &#x2014; Jack represents himself as prospering well at his Leamington Waters: as a Correspondent he is one of the very <hi rend="italic">briefest!</hi></p>
<p>The Town is getting emptier; fast emptying itself,&#x2014;thank Heaven! There is not in the whole world such an uproar as London in the early part of summer. The Parliament is to be off very soon: the moor-game, so soon as it is ready, calls out all hands to shoot, and they leave their law-making alone;&#x2014;unfortunate persons, I have ceased very much to disturb myself with them this way or that.</p>
<p>Now you will write, dear Jamie; and tell me punctually how my Mother is. As many things more as you like; but this any way! My blessings with you all</p>

<p>A bad wet day: the ride put off till <hi rend="italic">five</hi> at soonest: otherwise I had not had time for even this small Note to my Goody. I am terribly busy! It is a fact, I have not yet <hi rend="italic">been able</hi> to go and get myself a set of covers. On horseback whenever the pen is out of my hand:&#x2014;yesternight I meant to be out, but there came a heavy proofsheet; I had not done with it till past one in the morning,&#x2014;being dreadfully stupid to aid the matter! I had a dirty cold too;&#x2014;but that is mostly gone today.</p>
<p>Darwin had no news; drove me up to the Library for a Book, then generously drove me home again with it. At the library door, Sir H<hi rend="italic">y</hi> Varney<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sir Harry Verney, often spelled &#x201C;Varney&#x201D; by the Carlyles.</note> <hi rend="italic">and</hi> Capt<hi rend="italic">n</hi> Mackenzie simultaneously laid hold of me;&#x2014;very inconvenient: Mackenzie and his Wife are for Dresden direct, <foreign><hi rend="italic">&#xE0; la bonne heure</hi></foreign> [well and good]:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >There was a dispute about Mackenzie&#x2019;s pay and allowance, withheld during his Afghan captivity (<hi rend="italic">Storms and Sunshine</hi> 1:379&#x2013;84 and 2:20); so, though some was repaid in <date when="1846-00-00">1846</date>, the Mackenzies lived in Dresden for economy till their return late in <date when="1846-00-00">1846</date>.</note> Varney will rejoice to see me at <hi rend="italic">any</hi> time,&#x2014;cannot hope now till after about a month. Night solitary; work tried; a very poor stock of it done. Yesterday, powerless, somewhat wretched (owing to cold) I met Rich<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Milnes, mounted, as I went out to ride. Glad to see the little sausage. To Roehampton<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ca. 6 mi. SW of the Thames from Chelsea.</note> together, at a very swift rate; to call for some old Fryston Aunts of his:<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably Louisa, Caroline, and Amelia Jane Milnes; see <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410407-TC-JWC-01"><sic>13:81</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1841-04-07">7 April 1841</date></corr></ref>.</note> call not edifying; ride very swift, and the talk not useless to me. Afterwards, chicken-broth, brandy-punch, sleep&#x2014;work till one.</p>
<p>This is my whole History; Jack has sent me one of the shortest of Letters; and the bad news in it that my poor old Mother is unwell: a gloomy fact for my imagination in this mood. If you have any time at all in these days or weeks, I wish you would write a Letter to her, or to Jamie, or some of them; and testify how busy I am.</p>
<p>Day after tomorrow you remove; poor little Goody. Helen asked &#x201C;My&#x2014;! is there no Letter today?&#x201D; Not a line: we have only wanted two days yet. The kitchen here is very brisk indeed; and now, I think, there is a washing on foot.&#x2014;&#x2014; Today they have finished printing <hi rend="italic">Past and Present</hi>. <closer><salute>My blessings on thee, dear little Partner!&#x2014;</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dearest</salute>
<p>The last two days, &#x201C;being an only child&#x201D; I have not <hi rend="italic">wished</hi> to write; today I <hi rend="italic">wish</hi>, but <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi>, to any purpose, no indeed&#x2014;today, I must give up the idea of &#x201C;carrying <hi rend="small-caps">such</hi> a blessing into your house&#x201D;! I have risen with &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">no head</hi>,&#x201D; or rather with a more than usual certainty that I have one&#x2014;from the <hi rend="italic">pain</hi> of it. &#x201C;My <hi rend="italic">allowance</hi>&#x201D; here is beginning to <hi rend="italic">take effect on me</hi>; by Friday I shall have had quite enough of this sort of thing, and be ready to have even Geraldine-speculations &#x201C;thrown into the system&#x201D;&#x2014; M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Paulet called again on Monday, and missed me again&#x2014;she left word that she would fetch me away at eleven on Friday morning&#x2014; If I could but &#x201C;make my care the welfare of others&#x201D; I should have room to feel &#x201C;a good joy&#x201D; over the pleasure which my coming seems to have given to several people&#x2014; My Uncle has &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">enjoyed</hi>&#x201D; my visit very much&#x2014;we have had no <hi rend="italic">flare ups</hi> on politics this time&#x2014;neither he nor Alick have spoken one word of &#x201C;Sir Robert&#x201D; or &#x201C;Sir James&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Peel and Graham.</note> or any other public person or thing since I came!! So much for the few words of objurgation I wrote to my Uncle beforehand on the subject of his &#x201C;detestable politics&#x201D;! The only flareup I have witnessed was last night at cards&#x2014; He and Alick were playing at <foreign><hi rend="italic">ecart&#xE9;</hi></foreign>&#x2014;on a little table in a corner&#x2014;very silently, and <hi rend="italic">amicably</hi> to all appearance; the rest of us were sewing or reading&#x2014;suddenly the little table flew into the air on the point of my Uncle&#x2019;s foot! and a shower of cards fell all over the floor!&#x2014; &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Damn</hi> these eternal cards&#x201D; said he fiercely, as we all stared up at him in astonishment&#x2014; &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Hang</hi> them! <hi rend="italic">Curse</hi> them! <hi rend="italic">Blast</hi> them!&#x2014; Blast them to Hell!&#x201D; They all looked frightened&#x2014;for me, the suddenness of the thing threw me into a fit of laughter in which my Uncle himself was the first to join.</p>
<p>This morning at breakfast something was saying about <hi rend="italic">cards</hi> to be taken to <hi rend="italic">Scotland</hi>&#x2014;&#x201C;but,&#x201D; said I&#x2014;&#x201C;I thought they had been all sent last night to <hi rend="italic">Hell?</hi>&#x201D;&#x2014; &#x201C;Pooh,&#x201D; said my Uncle quite gravely, &#x201C;that was only <hi rend="italic">one pack!</hi>&#x201D; Jeanie seems to be settling down more and more into placid inanity&#x2014; SO far as I can make out she has some sort of lukewarm love affair and <hi rend="italic">tacit</hi> engagement going on with Andrew Crystal<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Chrystal, whom she married, <date when="1853-00-00">1853</date>.</note>&#x2014;a good out-and-out <hi rend="italic">love</hi> would be the very best thing in the world for her&#x2014;even if in the long run it should go all to <hi rend="italic">immortal smash</hi>.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-14/lt-18420626-TC-TSS-01"><sic>14:210</sic><corr>TC to TSS, <date when="1842-06-26">26 June 1842</date></corr></ref>.</note> but your <hi rend="italic">lukewarm</hi> loves&#x2014;where people <pb id="pg-19-120" n="19:120"/>doubt &#x201C;first the worthiness of the passion&#x2014;and then their own worthiness, and finally&#x2014;good Heaviness&#x2014;the worthiness of the object! &#x201C;The Devil fly away with&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">that</hi> sort of loves for <hi rend="italic">me!</hi> Better to throw a gallon or two of good honest <hi rend="italic">lukewarm water</hi> into the system and take the consequences!&#x2014; But certainly I am not wise in writing on with &#x201C;my <hi rend="italic">brains</hi>&#x201D; (as Rio would say) &#x201C;tormenting me&#x201D; in this way.</p>
<p>But, what to do?&#x2014; One&#x2019;s Good if not &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">feeling</hi> so &#x201C;lonely&#x201D; as might be wished, yet in point of fact lonely enough&#x2014;and on&#x2019;eself without an own red bed to retire into&#x2014; Cannot I stay in my <hi rend="italic">Boot</hi> and be quiet?&#x2014; No, I get beside myself pent up there&#x2014;latterly I have been bolting out of it, thro the men&#x2019;s room&#x2014;whether they were there and <hi rend="italic">clothed</hi> or no&#x2014;like a bottle of ginger beer bur<supplied>[s]</supplied>ting<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> the cork! &#x201C;Uncle I beg you pardon but I <hi rend="italic">must</hi> &#x201C;get out&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201D; &#x201C;Weel Weel!

<p><salute>Thanks, Dearest,</salute> many thanks; thy bright little Missives are a real consolation to me in my solitude here. A solitary wrestle with the Blockheadisms, that is what I have just now; and there is need of some consolation at times, if it could be had! Ellen had stuck out the little blue-bordered Note of today; set it on the <hi rend="italic">top</hi> of the Letter-box, that I might see it when I came down to smoke. The <hi rend="italic">Leech</hi> is very well: I went and saw it this morning; it has an allowance of fresh water every day, and complains of nothing. Lying all glued together against the top of the glass, the little villain, and leading a very quiet life of it,&#x2014;never even <hi rend="italic">asking</hi>, &#x201C;What is Taxes?&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>
    <p>Wednesday, at five too, proved wet; no riding that day. Walked up to Baringdom<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Barings&#x2019; London house, 12 Gt.

She dislikes the Duff Gordons &#x26;c deeply; but has to sit there with a smiling face and entreat them to dine!&#x2014; I walked home again very weary thro&#x2019; the moist winds.</p>
<p>Yesterday, after &#x201C;Copy&#x201D; &#x26;c settled, I had a gallop equal to Gilpins;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See William Cowper, &#x201C;The Diverting History of John Gilpin.&#x201D;</note> black Duncan in a very &#x201C;fresh&#x201D; state, nothing loath;&#x2014;and I took it out of him; round by Acton, Kew Bridge &#x26;c,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Acton is ca. 4 mi.

Nothing yet decided, but that <hi rend="italic">it</hi> is to be done, and that a visit to Annandale is to follow it.

<p><salute>Dearest,&#x2014;</salute>I have some five minutes till the horse come, or till I must go and dress for the horse;&#x2014;not the slightest particle of news good or bad; but it will be better to salute the poor Goody today with one&#x2019;s blessing,&#x2014;otherwise there can be none till Monday. I am plunging along as usual, thro&#x2019; the Lethean quagmires: I am like to be hard up for <hi rend="italic">room</hi>, indeed I am quite sure to have the Second Volume too long, do what I can: however, one way or other, it will soon be done.</p>
<p>Last night I had my ride; Hyde Park, Regent&#x2019;s Park, breath from my beloved Hampstead.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >All N of Chelsea.</note> I got a <hi rend="italic">lumbago</hi> by the business, the new figure of my Addiscombe Cold; it is not of much moment hitherto.

Vegetables, I think, I will renounce for a while: yesterday for the first time I tried potatoes,&#x2014;won&#x2019;t do.</p>
<p>Proofsheets and confused strugglings afterwards kept me up late. Nothing occurred all evening; nothing but the dismissal of Bain at the door,&#x2014;which was the annihilation of a negative thing.

I counselled her to write a Letter straightway addressed to the Clergyman of the place he was left at: the unhappy Croakeress then departed.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>Well, Goody I hope you had sleep, last night, after all the doors were banged-to? Send me word what your head is saying, what your heart. If the Sun would but break out, there might be a few cheerful days for you there, among people who like you, whom you like.

<salute>Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I was glad of your Note however short; I could not well make out what <pb id="pg-19-125" n="19:125"/>you were upon, or how you were prospering, at Leamington.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Carlyle replied, <date when="1845-08-04">4 Aug.</date>: &#x201C;I had the object of ascertaining whether Leamington offered a good arena for another physician. &#x2026; So far as I am able to judge from report &#x26; observation I should say one would be without any sober society in the Town.&#x201D; There were &#x201C;some twenty surgeons &#x26; six or seven physicians in a population of fourteen thousand. &#x2026; I did not mention these things to you earlier because I was unwilling to trouble you with my projects; &#x26; now with my desire to settle, it seems too likely that they will again come to nothing. This can be easily thrown into the fire &#x26; need not call forth any of the old scorn; for I sincerely want some wholesome work.&#x201D;</note> My Mother&#x2019;s illness, tho&#x2019; Jamie treats it slightingly, is not good news. I have written to him for farther information. Here is a little Note from Jean at Dumfries, which indicates all to be well in that quarter. You certainly will gather strength at your Watering place, at any green fresh-aired &#x201C;place&#x201D; whatever, in this season. How long do you mean to stay? Or you have not yet set any term?</p>
<p>Jane went away on Tuesday gone a week; has been a week at her Uncle&#x2019;s, till he set off for the Frith of Clyde: she was to remove yesterday to Seaforth, where there is no chance of my rejoining her, as was once contemplated; she has then her Welsh visit &#x26;c: possibly enough she may still find me here at her return. Milnes asks us to Fryston,&#x2014;won&#x2019;t do: Fergus asks me to Perthshire,&#x2014;won&#x2019;t: Sir H<hi rend="italic">y</hi> Varney again to Bedfordshire:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >At Claydon House, Bucks.</note>&#x2014;alas, &#x201C;what&#x2019;s ta use on&#x2019;t?&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310500-TC-WG-01"><sic>5:268</sic><corr>TC to WG, <date when="1831-05-01">1 May 1831</date></corr></ref>.</note> I have to continue here, very ill off at times, and get my deadly burden rolled away first.&#x2014; I am on the Final Part now, thank Heaven; but shall have a tough wrestle with it still. Last Saturday and Sunday I was at Addiscombe: Everett the American and others there. I got a cold by the job; had a very fierce ride home on Monday morning to breakfast. I ride daily unless the weather absolutely prohibit: far and fast; my horse is swift, strong, but still a little troublesome with his freaks. I do not grow worse, nor very perceptibly better. My heart is very sad. Courage! I must get thro&#x2019; that rubbish and rest myself.</p>

<salute>Dear Mrs Mackenzie,</salute>
<p>I am very sorry it is altogether impossible to have the pleasure of waiting upon you at present. I have been for many months, and am still, in a frightful state of toil and trouble; worn down with <hi rend="italic">Devils</hi> (Printers&#x2019; and <pb id="pg-19-129" n="19:129"/>others) almost to extinction;&#x2014;not permitted to go out to any place at all. Two hours daily I spend in riding, to keep life in; the rest of my time is passed in a whirlpool of papers and confusions, frightful to think of;&#x2014;happily now promising to abate in some weeks, which is the only comfort of it. Till then I am and have been an enchanted man.</p>
<p><closer><salute>I will wish you all manner of pleasure and instruction in Germany; and with many kind regards to your brave Captain and brave Self,</salute></closer></p>
<closer><salute>Remain always / Very sincerely Yours</salute></closer>

<p>No letter today&#x2014; Well I had one <hi rend="italic">yesterday</hi> which was more than bargain&#x2014;only think; your Saturdays letter lay all thro&#x2019; Sunday at the little postoffice within five minutes walk of me!&#x2014; Letters seldom arrive at this house unless brought by M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Paulet; so that it is not <hi rend="italic">a rule</hi> to <hi rend="italic">send</hi> to the postoffice and I, having no idea of a house in which the post office plays so insignificant a part, never thought of asking: had they sent?&#x2014;but when no letter came at eleven, took it for granted there was none. I even walked to the postoffice myself afterwards with my own letter and put it in without inquiry&#x2014;so it was produced on the <hi rend="italic">Monday</hi>, an unexpected blessing.</p>
<p>I go on beautifully here&#x2014;sleep, and eat, and am &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">happy</hi>&#x201D;&#x2014;to <hi rend="italic">a certain</hi> <pb id="pg-19-130" n="19:130"/>extent&#x2014; I fancy that being very much <hi rend="italic">made <hi rend="small-caps">of</hi></hi> agrees with my constitution&#x2014; I have not had a headach since I arrived or any sort of illness, except yesterday morning a fit of <hi rend="italic">sickness</hi> which made my life from five in the morning till ten&#x2014;what M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Ames in her Italian journal<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Apparently never pbd.</note> calls the road from Genoa to Pisa &#x201C;one <hi rend="italic">succession of Interests</hi>&#x201D;&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">every</hi> quarter of an hour I found myself fainting away and the bell in the room is&#x2014;broken!

He had been immediately drawn to TC by recognizing that TC&#x2019;s earlier writings agreed with his own wish to escape from the old-style Calvinistic and utilitarian formulas of unitarianism.

E. Channing, Coleridge, and German theologians, Martineau was the leader of the new school of unitarianism. There is no justification in his life or writings for JWC&#x2019;s charges of skepticism and insincerity. See also K. J.

<p><salute>Dear little Goody,&#x2014;</salute>Thanks for your charming bits of Letters, which are a great comfort in my solitude here. The comfortablest things that visit me, I think. &#x201C;And a very poor return you have,&#x201D; as Oliver would say! But we cannot help that, just at present.</p>
<p>Yesterday by swift trotting up Sloane Street, I still got the poor Apology for a Letter put in; which would keep you from being uneasy. Today my riding hour is 3 (I awoke very early): I have taken half an hour to myself; and nobody shall baulk you of your little fraction of home news today&#x2014;</p>
<p>Saturday&#x2019;s Letter, which lay asleep at your Post-Office, was written in great haste; in great haste were the &#x201C;clothes&#x201D; got on: but no horse came; rain came instead. Rain came and went: horse came at five;&#x2014;I had a most muddy wet gallop over in the Surrey side, rain heavier than ever. But a ride in the rain too is pleasant, when you have made up your mind to it, and have no clothes that will spoil. Our Sunday was blustery, brisk, and at last clear and sunny. After finishing my task, I rode to Addiscombe,&#x2014;and repented of it. Nobody there, quite a private day; all gone to the heath; <pb id="pg-19-133" n="19:133"/>lunch over;&#x2014;time of return uncertain. I smoked cigars, I ate infinite gooseberries, read the Times Newspaper. In <hi rend="italic">two</hi> hours and better, the Three (Buller one of them) returned; cheerfully welcomed me, gave me dinner; and then for return&#x2014;it was discovered I had lost a shoe! No great matter still, tho&#x2019; the evening seemed to have been mainly meant for rest had I not been there:&#x2014;but at last in bed, Sleep signified distinctly that I was not to have him! It was the gooseberries mainly, and an <hi rend="italic">abstemious</hi> dinner following them: virtue its own reward. I awoke very early again; and had the cheering reflexion &#x201C;None but yourself to blame for it my man!&#x201D;&#x2014; In fine the shoe was got on; and myself under way: home at my coffee here, not long after nine,&#x2014;and an enormous sleep <hi rend="italic">that</hi> night at any rate. Addiscombe was altogether beautiful when I left it in the sunny-shady morning; deep-green world, lively breath of air, bright sunshine chacing black shadows over it: I said to myself, &#x201C;whose is it, after all? They are going to quit it next week; <hi rend="italic">they</hi> cannot stay here!&#x201D;&#x2014; If next sunday be bright I may ride out again; but will try to take my precautions better. In the course of the following week, they are off for Scotland,&#x2014;and I must have my bag again! The Lady is &#x201C;in the Country&#x201D; all this week; paying visits I understand. I cannot yet tell you what day Buller goes: but I remember it is <hi rend="italic">soon</hi>, and it is not till after Monday next. He is gone to Cornwall, electioneering;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Buller was M.P. for Liskeard, Cornwall, <date when="1832-00-00">1832</date>&#x2013;<date when="1848-00-00">48</date>, but there were no elections in Cornwall.</note> so I cannot ask him. You had better aim at Monday.</p>
<p>Since then I have prospered. A beautiful ride last night, Highgate, Hampstead &#x26;c;&#x2014;seldom saw a beautifuller scene of its sort. And the Printers are very busy; Proofsheet almost night<supplied>[ly]</supplied><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letters omitted.</note>;&#x2014;and I have been annihilating considerable rubbish; and begin almost to see to the end! God grant I were well at it; for really this is getting too heavy.&#x2014;&#x2014; &#x2014; Met Helps on Monday Ev<hi rend="italic">g;</hi> I had gone out to buy myself a new <hi rend="italic">Stock</hi> (such audacity had I summoned up); Helps descrying it, joined me in the shop. His horse fallen altogether <hi rend="italic">lame</hi>. The clatter of the good Helps did me no ill for a while. The Town is getting almost altogether empty now. Very pleasant the Streets and roads will be in comparison, before long.</p>
<p>Yesternight came Christie poor man with some project about a Surgeoncy in the Hanwell Asylum;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Middlesex County Insane Asylum was at Hanwell, 10 mi. W of St. Paul&#x2019;s. When <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> was finished, the problem was finding Christie further employment: &#x201C;If ever one human being laboured on behalf of another in distress, it was Carlyle on behalf of poor Christie, through the months of <date when="1845-00-00">1845</date> and <date when="1846-00-00">1846</date>. At last by Sir James Clark&#x2019;s influence, &#x2026; a clerkship in the Registrar-General&#x2019;s office in Somerset House&#x201D; was found for him, by which time his wife had died of consumption. &#x201C;He talked, however, gratefully of the kindness of the Carlyles. His reverence for Carlyle was touching.&#x201D; After a few months he returned to Aberdeen, where he died of consumption (David Masson, <hi rend="italic">Memories of London in the &#x2019;Forties</hi> [<date when="1908-00-00">1908</date>] 80&#x2013;81).</note> which I doubt he has no chance for: I <pb id="pg-19-134" n="19:134"/>wrote him two Letters, which, with Anthony Sterling who also came, cut up my whole evening&#x2014; Sad enough. Letter from Jack;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1845-08-04">4 Aug.</date>, from Leamington.</note>&#x2014;Letter from Jamie<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1845-08-02">2 Aug.</date></note> that my Mother is getting better again.</p>
<p>Anthony was Martinetish, withered as usual;&#x2014;gave me very sad news about his Father. The poor old Stimabile had been galloping ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> the Country with his Grandson; had got to Manchester to the Queen&#x2019;s H&#xF4;tel there,&#x2014;was struck with Apoplexy; for some time hopeless; lies there still, recovering slowly. Anthony had been up for two days; just returned;&#x2014;to be off for Italy, Germany or I know not whither, <hi rend="italic">tomorrow</hi>. It is very strange that indifferency; that Isolation of the poor old Sterling comes home to me as very sad!&#x2014; If I were not so busy I would write a Note to him, I think,&#x2014;poor old Stimabile! Well, my Dearikin, enjoy the dainty home you have got in the friend&#x2019;s house,&#x2014;surely a very rare acquisition in this world. I am delighted to hear of your prospering there, my poor little Dame,&#x2014;so seldom does the like befal. Go on, grow stronger and stronger;&#x2014;and come home very fat to me!</p>
<p>I had some other things to say; but here is the horse-hour, within two minutes. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign> my Dearest. Take care of thyself; and be good to me tho&#x2019; absent.</salute></closer></p>

<p>I wish you had opened poor Christies note&#x2014;to save time&#x2014; pray &#x201C;take a peep into the inside&#x201D; of any notes or letters that come for me before you send them which will save the trouble of sending them back again&#x2014;</p>
<p>Geraldine has been struck with a sudden thought to go to Liverpool this morning in the Omnibus&#x2014;so I send off the piece of &#x201C;ornament and grandeur&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech. &#x201C;&#x2018;What ornament and grandeur!&#x2019;&#x2014; Indignant old sailor to me once about his new binnacle in his new-fangled steamship&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note in Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi> 2:377).

<salute>Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I have received both your Letters, and am thankful even for the last, brief as it is: any word you send me is a new item in the credit account by the Laws of Arithmetic. I am really exceedingly busy; and living like an owl, I could write nothing even if I had time.</p>
<p>Your first Letter I was very far from burning;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For John Carlyle&#x2019;s letter of <date when="1845-08-04">4 Aug.</date>, see <ref target="volume-19/lt-18450802-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1845-08-02">2 Aug.</date></ref>, which ended: &#x201C;Let it be read &#x26; cast into the fire as it deserves!&#x201D;</note> but I will say nothing about it, much as I may think: we will leave that matter to be ripened by the Destinies, and pray that a good issue may one day arrive. Speech of mine, I now see with much repentance, has done only mischief to it: at lowest it may claim silence from me; silence, and the truest wishes of a brother&#x2019;s heart, it shall have, if I can so manage.&#x2014; Dr Hunter<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jacob Hunter.</note> left a Book for you here: did I tell you of that before?</p>
<p>Jane is still at Seaforth; seems to take well with her quarters there; has no talk of Wales yet, much less of returning hither. For myself I keep struggling along: I have hopes of getting thro&#x2019; all the Documents this week; there will then remain only the winding-up,&#x2014;in some neat and as yet invisible way. I never was more sick of any job; nothing but a kind of real <hi rend="italic">piety</hi> gives me some encouragement from time to time, and keeps me alive at it. The quantities of brutal rubbish that I seem to myself to have swept, or set men on the way of sweeping, from the face of a Great Man, are perhaps considerable.&#x2014; Our City has grown entirely empty; the Barings too are off this day for a Scotch Tour; so I have now nothing but Darwin, some once a-week: other parties, mostly a mere sorrow to me, I have <pb id="pg-19-141" n="19:141"/>succeeded in banishing. None comes, hardly even a Letter that I answer: I sit &#x201C;annihilating rubbish,&#x201D; in a very solitary manner indeed. Today I was round by Highgate, and returned by Islington and the streets:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Highgate, ca. 6 mi. N of Chelsea; Islington, ca. 5 mi. NE of Chelsea.</note> a daily gallop is my sole sight of the living world;&#x2014;the horse very useful to me in that respect.</p>
<p>Anthony Sterling and W. Cunningham with their Wives<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Coningham (<date when="1815-00-00">1815</date>&#x2013;<date when="1884-00-00">84</date>; see <ref target="volume-11/lt-18391024-TC-MAC-01"><sic>11:207</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1839-10-24">24 Oct. 1839</date></corr></ref>), Anthony Sterling&#x2019;s maternal cousin, m. to Elizabeth Catherine, b. Meyrick (see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18401015-TC-JAC-01"><sic>12:287</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1840-10-15">15 Oct. 1840</date></corr></ref>).</note> are off to Germany. Old Sterling, poor old fellow, has had a stroke of apoplexy; is lying even now, I believe, recovering from it, in the Queen&#x2019;s H&#xF4;tel at Manchester, where it came upon him first. Anthony went to Manchester for two days; then proceeded on his Tour about a week ago.</p>
<p>You have not yet settled about leaving Leamington. If you had any call hitherward at such an empty time, of course the house here has room enough for you.&#x2014; I must go to Sloane Square yet with this, and it is late. I had written to Jamie, and heard word about my Mother. I hope the Sea bathing will do her good. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Brother; I must off!</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>Dear Goody,&#x2014;</salute>I send my salutations, my assurances that all is well here, hopes that all is well where you are; but no Letter yet,&#x2014;in fact I can write no Letter; I am worn out with hard drudgery, the life of me nearly extinct to all spiritual purposes; and without news or possibility of news, being solitary as the owl in desart&#x2014;&#x201C;Sparrow-like, companionless / On the housetop alone!&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ps. 102:6&#x2013;7.</note>&#x2014; It is you that should write; not I except in friendly monosyllables. Thanks to you for writing to my Mother; that is one duty you have done for me. She is gone to the Gill with Jenny, for seabathing: a Note from Jack, last night, so brief as hardly to be intelligible, did at length impart to me that meaning. She will be right glad of your Letter, being always proud of you, and of any word from you.</p>
<p>Our weather keeps continually dropping here: today there is a glimpse of sun broken out lately; the first we have seen for days. All the Earth is grown autumnal, of a dark grave colour; all the City is fallen silent. I rode <pb id="pg-19-142" n="19:142"/>yesterday thro&#x2019; streets all the way from Islington (had been at Highgate, and returned that way); and <hi rend="italic">cantered</hi> almost without obstruction. My <hi rend="italic">horse</hi>, and the history of my rides, is almost all the history I have at present: the &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">woral</hi></foreign> [world]&#x201D; goes for a very small matter with me so busy <hi rend="italic">out</hi> of the world.&#x2014; Just now I have finished copying the <hi rend="italic">last</hi> Letter of Oliver: I will try hard yet to be thro&#x2019; the <hi rend="italic">original</hi> stuff this week, tho&#x2019; that begins to be dubious now. There will then be a &#x201C;Conclusion&#x201D; of some kind to do,&#x2014;an Index to set agoing. After which I am off <foreign><hi rend="italic">ins Freie</hi></foreign> [into the open air]:&#x2014;<foreign>Ay de mi!</foreign></p>
    <p>The Barings&#x2019; little Page brought me my bag this morning,&#x2014;my one piece of news. The <foreign><hi rend="italic">Herrschaft</hi></foreign> [master and mistress] went off at half-past nine, by the Mail Train of the Railway, and must be somewhere in your neighbourhood before now.

<p>Hellen said, &#x201C;Loch me, no Letter this morning yet! Is&#x2019;t not mys<hi rend="italic">ter</hi>ous?&#x201D;&#x2014; Not at all! I said, impatiently; for I should have been very glad of a Letter too.&#x2014; Nevertheless do not <hi rend="italic">bore</hi> yourself writing to me. A brief word to say you are well and cheerful; that includes the indispensable. Consider yourself out for the <hi rend="italic">purpose</hi> of &#x201C;being jolly&#x201D; and of gathering health and heart; and do not cramp yourself for Chelsea which wriggles along on the old footings&#x2014;not <hi rend="italic">yet</hi> &#x201C;gone out&#x201D; for a similar purpose.</p>
<p>And pray, my Goody, let me call your Letters by any name I like,&#x2014;grant me freedom in that. Their merits, you may depend on it, are mirrored in a very fair glass, while it is I that read them;&#x2014;and if I call them &#x201C;bits of Letters,&#x201D; it is perhaps all the better for them, from a soul so sulky, dispirited, dead and buried, as mine now is, in this horrid business of mine!&#x2014; Courage, Courage, it will be done soon; then perhaps better days will come!&#x2014; &#x201C;Dinner dished, Sir!&#x201D; The little Bee is washing.

<salute>Dearest</salute>
<p>When one has wearied oneself in riding, the best way of resting I have been told is to <hi rend="italic">walk</hi>&#x2014;which brings another set of muscles into play&#x2014;on the same principle having <hi rend="italic">talked</hi> myself nearly to death, I shall now <hi rend="italic">write</hi> a little&#x2014;instead of going at once to bed as I was preparing to do, when in winding up my watch I made the discovery that it was precisely half past <hi rend="italic">nine</hi> o&#x2019;clock! There need be no reflections here for want of early hours!&#x2014;we are never out of bed after ten&#x2014;and I am sure it is very good for one&#x2019;s soul to live in this primeval fashion&#x2014; Tonight we all fancied it eleven when we came up stairs having had the Martineaus on hands since two! I wish they may ever recover from the things they have heard this day! The flowers and fruit and <hi rend="italic">peacocks feathers</hi> which were lavished on them at their departure would hardly make amends for the cold blooded systematic persecution which their terrified consciences have this day been exposed to. As for James he would certainly have taken a fit at last, if a violent <hi rend="italic">perspiration</hi> had not come to his relief! three women &#x201C;all alike gleg [spirited]&#x201D; pitching light&#x2014;(<hi rend="italic">of nature</hi>) into him all at once!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC, Elizabeth Paulet, and Jewsbury had been vigorously arguing with him.</note> To night he will <hi rend="italic">dream</hi> that he has &#x201C;made a great crash amongst the ten commandments&#x201D; and even to dream it will be something!</p>
    <p>We are to see him again&#x2014;if he dare&#x2014;on Friday night at M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Ames&#x2019;s who is giving a musical party to my honour and glory.

<p>M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Buller got no letter from me&#x2014;what with eating and sleeping and walking and driving and having my feet rubbed and <hi rend="italic">settling the general question</hi> I have really no time for writing except to one&#x2019;s Good&#x2014; Every night too after M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Paulet comes home I play one or more games at chess&#x2014;which is using <hi rend="italic">him</hi> up famously&#x2014; He is wonderfully patient of us all&#x2014;and &#x201C;not without glimmerings of intelligence&#x201D;!&#x2014; My paper and everybodys is done&#x2014;so you must put up with scraps&#x2014;</p>

<p>No Letter Goodykin, none today yet?&#x2014; Well, I must wait patiently; there will come one all the welcomer tomorrow. &#x201C;Better than I deserve!&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340627-TC-AC-01"><sic>7:223</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1834-06-27">27 June 1834</date></corr></ref>.</note></p>
<p><pb id="pg-19-146" n="19:146"/>The day is grey and damp; the Sun has gone his ways again. I give my horse a rest; he has had long gallops of late. Last night I was round by Kew Bridge and Acton (totally unknown to thy Topography; but meaning 18 miles or so); saw shocks of wheat for the first time, and poor reapers, who do not cut as the Scotch do, but on a plan of their own. Harvest is a month too late; will hardly fail therefore to be bad: and if the Railway Bubble burst at the same time,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The manic speculation in railway shares that began in <date when="1844-00-00">1844</date> led to financial panic in <date when="1846-00-00">1846</date>.</note> as is likeliest, there will be a precious winter for the poor Operatives again, and those that have charge of them! The naked beggarly Greed and Mammon-worship of this generation is sorrowfully apparent at present; and I confess sometimes I do not care if their &#x201C;wealth&#x201D; and all the greasy adjuncts of it <hi rend="italic">were</hi> actually to take wings and fly away! I think we might have a less detestable existence without; a <hi rend="italic">chance</hi> for a less fetid life-element than this! Even Darley was stutter-stuttering with much emphasis to that effect the night I saw him.&#x2014; Did I ever mention that Browning came too one night? He sent many respects to you; is about publishing new Pomegranates,&#x2014;no, new Something-elses,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Dramatic Romances and Lyrics</hi> (<date when="1845-00-00">1845</date>), the seventh number of Browning&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Bells and Pomegranates</hi> (<date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>&#x2013;<date when="1846-00-00">46</date>). Browning and Elizabeth Barrett often discussed TC when they met. She asked in a letter of <date when="1845-08-00">early Aug.</date>: &#x201C;Did you go to Chelsea &#x26; hear the divine philosophy?&#x201D; Browning replied, [<date when="1845-08-08">8 Aug.</date>]: &#x201C;Yes, I went to Chelsea and found dear Carlyle alone. &#x2026; He was all kindness and talked like his own self while he made me tea&#x2014;and, afterward, brought chairs into the little yard, rather than garden, and smoked his pipe with apparent relish; at night he would walk as far as Vauxhall Bridge on my way home&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">The Letters of Robert Browning and Elizabeth Barrett Barrett <date when="1845-00-00">1845</date>&#x2013;<date when="1846-00-00">1846</date></hi>, ed.

<p>How did the Martineau visit go? Tell me, tell me; I like to hear all these things whether I say so or not; and thy bits of Letters, by whatever name I call them, are very entertaining to me.&#x2014; Or are you not well, at present? Alas, that would be a very bad solution of it!&#x2014; Tomorrow certainly I shall hear?</p>
<p>This morning I had the pleasure of seeing my little Russia-leather Dressingcase stand where it did again; and of shaving myself with the stray razor. Other good news, or news of any kind, I have had none. The domestic Bee is for treating me with &#x201C;a pudding,&#x201D; she says! I try all kinds of vegetables; today I am for soup and bread merely, whence the &#x201C;pudding.&#x201D;&#x2014; My head begins to ache; my literature is not prospering: I had better out, and have a little walk.</p>

I walked up to Darwin&#x2019;s last night, fancying myself very well, and wishing to be better: he gave me some tea, of which I took very little having already had my own tea; but that little or the talk and it were a ruin to me; and so you have no Letter,&#x2014;among other results that there are.&#x2014;&#x2014; What that <hi rend="italic">pierced</hi> missive may be I cannot in the least guess:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-19/lt-18450820-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1845-08-20">20 Aug.</date>]</ref>.</note> in the other I fancy you will get news of Robertson, of whom there has otherwise come no glimpse or whisper my way.&#x2014; Of course I declined Bay House.

<salute>Dearest</salute>
<p>I never know whether a letter is welcomest when it arrives after having been impatiently waited for, or like yesterdays, &#x201C;quite&#x201D; promiscuously&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech.</note>&#x2014;when I was standing &#x201C;on the broad basis&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech.</note> of: &#x201C;Blessed are they who do not hope; for they shall not be disappointed&#x201D;! I assure you I am not the <hi rend="italic">only</hi> person obliged by your writing; it makes a very palpable difference in my <hi rend="italic">amiability</hi> throout the day, whether I have a letter to begin it with.</p>
    <p>Last night we went, according to programme, to M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Ames&#x2019;s&#x2014;and &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">it is but fair to state&#x201D;</hi> that the drive there and back in the moonlight was the best of it.

<p><salute>Dearest,&#x2014;</salute>Here again is a Letter from you, full of cheery details and delineations; right pleasant for me to read. I go down from my litter of Papers here when I hear the bell ring about noon; and there is a Letter from Goody! Thanks to Goody.&#x2014; I think you have fallen on your feet, this time, for a visit: it is very seldom indeed that such a thing succeeds so well.&#x2014;&#x2014; I taste your Mr Yates, a spoonful of dishwashings, satisfactory sample of an Ocean! Really I begin almost to pity poor James Martineau: the lot of a poor man, of so many poor men, doomed to twaddle all their lives in Socinian Jargon, and look at this Divine universe thro&#x2019; distracted despicable Jew-Greek spectacles, and a whole Monmouth Street of &#x201C;ou&#x2019; cloe!&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Old clothes (worn-out doctrines) as sold by Jewish secondhand dealers, Monmouth St., Holborn; cf. Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi> 241, and <hi rend="italic">Latter-Day Pamphlets, Works</hi> 20:330 (&#x201C;The Jew old-clothes having now grown fairly pestilential&#x201D;).</note>&#x2014;seems to me very sad. But the back is made for the burden, I suppose. If it were so very sad for a man, he could give it up.&#x2014; Rawlins too is very awful to me.</p>
<p>I worked hard yesterday to keep my word to myself, but it would not do; <pb id="pg-19-152" n="19:152"/>nay I had, at starting, as good as no hope of its doing. However, I have managed today;&#x2014;the last Speech of Oliver&#x2019;s is fairly ready for printing; not a line of his now remains: thank Heaven! I have now only to have him <hi rend="italic">die</hi>, and then to wind up in the briefest endurable way. I say to myself, Why should not, for instance, the <date when="1845-09-01"><hi rend="italic">first</hi> of September</date> actually <hi rend="italic">see</hi> me free of the job altogether; and ready for the road somewhither? We will try.&#x2014; As a preliminary I have started today by&#x2014;a <hi rend="italic">blue-pill</hi> with <hi rend="italic">castor</hi>, O Heavens! But I supposed it was the most judicious step of all.&#x2014; Christie has been set to the <hi rend="italic">Index</hi> too; is to have it done in two weeks. He came last night: I fear he has little chance for the Hanwell Situation; but he is trying hard, leaving no stone unturned.&#x2014; Today too, as you perceive Fitzgerald writes to me about dismissal of the Horse: I shall be very glad to close with that; it answers a question quite insoluble hitherto in my schemes.</p>
    <p>Yesterday I went to Richmond Park; saw the deer, the trees and skies; and for a little while had no noise to bother me. Chelsea was swarming with Cockneys more than usual: some &#x201C;balloon,&#x201D; or remains of a balloon, I believe, about Cremorne House, invited the curious.

<salute>Dear Fitzgerald,</salute>
<p>You will do me a real favour if you can, thro&#x2019; your Friend Browne or any other eligible channel, procure me a winter requiem for this horse of mine. I hope to have finished my affairs here in about a fortnight; am off then towards Scotland:&#x2014;and should be very glad to <hi rend="italic">annihilate</hi> the Horse till the<date when="1846-02-00">end of February</date> next. He is really a good Horse; has now got to reverence and love me very sincerely; and rides for most part in a very exemplary manner. Does not like railway-trains, and miracles of that nature; but is in general as composed as a Justice of Peace,&#x2014;and far livelier, and speedier of foot than any justice! In short an eligible animal. I believe he can leap too, and could hunt: but I have small skill to try him in that way. You must write to Browne about it (since you undertake so kindly), and see what can be done.</p>
<p>If Browne, or any benignant Friend and subduer of Horses, would take and ride him, hunt him or what else, all winter, I should expect he would come back to me much improved in his paces, and perfect in all manner of equine behaviour, in the Spring:&#x2014;but that, I suppose, does not lie within the possibilities: we must therefore look to grass or straw-yard, or some cheap form of <hi rend="italic">annihilation;</hi>&#x2014;in fact to what Browne, at your request, shall decide to be best. I am now ready to part with the horse at any time; and shall <hi rend="italic">want</hi> to be rid of him about the <date when="1845-09-00">first of Sept<hi rend="italic">r</hi>.</date>&#x2014; I know not what good he has done to my health: I am very poorly; but I suppose I should have been much worse otherwise. At all events I tried my best; and that was very fit to be done.</p>
<p>Cromwell&#x2019;s own things<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >His letters and speeches.</note> are now all out of my hands,&#x2014;the last this very day: but there is a conclusion to do, an Index &#x26;c &#x26;c: there is still certainly a fortnight&#x2019;s work in the business. You will get the Book to try your hand upon in <date when="1845-10-00">October</date> (so the Booksellers arrange):<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The two vols. appeared <date when="1845-11-22">22 Nov.</date></note>&#x2014;a very tough job of reading; but if you read well, I hope it will shew you more of Cromwell than you have fallen in with hitherto. I reckon it to be like the letting of the Brook upon the Augean Stables; it is meant to tell the whole world what Cromwell is, and turn their attention and exertions towards him:&#x2014;there will be mountains of <hi rend="italic">dung</hi> swum away in this manner by and by, and the real face of Oliver&#x2019;s History will at length become apparent to them.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >FitzGerald wrote to a friend, <date when="1845-08-27">27 Aug.</date>: &#x201C;Carlyle writes me word his Cromwell papers will be out in <date when="1845-10-00">October</date>; and that then we are all to be convinced that Richard had no hump to his back. I am strong in favour of the hump; I do not think the common sense of two Centuries is apt to be deceived in such a matter&#x201D; (Terhune, <hi rend="italic">LEF</hi> 1:508).</note></p>
<p><pb id="pg-19-154" n="19:154"/>Write to me again whither you go.

<p>Once more I am to trespass on your good nature for a little bit of service you can do me.

Lady Harriet may have seen the English trans. by E. A. Moriarty, with 500 illusts., <date when="1843-00-00">1843</date>&#x2013;<date when="1844-00-00">44</date>. Varnhagen replied, <date when="1845-09-09">9 Sept.</date>, that Kugler and Menzel were reliable (though not the best) and suitable for a lady&#x2019;s reading.</note> It is &#x201C;in one stout volume 8vo, the wood-cuts are beautiful&#x201D;; recently published; where, by whom, or of whose authorship, I cannot tell! This is somewhat like the Interpreting of Nebuchadnezzar&#x2019;s Dream,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Dan. 2.</note> the Dream itself not being given: however, I hope your sagacity will be able to divine what is meant. It is evidently some <foreign><hi rend="italic">Pracht-Buch</hi></foreign> [handsome book] for Drawingroom Tables: <hi rend="italic">Leben Friedrichs mit Holzschnitten</hi> [The Life of Frederick with Woodcuts];&#x2014;the Woodcuts, moreover (or perhaps they were not <hi rend="italic">wood</hi>-cuts at all) were &#x201C;in the manner of Retsch.&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Moritz Retzsch (<date when="1779-00-00">1779</date>&#x2013;<date when="1857-00-00">1857</date>), German painter and etcher.</note> Does this define it for you? <hi rend="italic">Wood</hi>-cuts or not, they were interspersed among the Letter-press,&#x2014;part of a page printed, part engraved.</p>
<p>If you can find with certainty what Book it is, and get me a Copy well bound, and send it over by the Berlin and Fleet-Street Bookseller,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >David Nutt (<date when="1810-00-00">1810</date>&#x2013;<date when="1863-00-00">63</date>), 158 Fleet St.</note> I shall be really obliged. One might have it bound here; but the foreign binding will be more piquant. It should be done <foreign><hi rend="italic">anmuthig</hi></foreign> [delightfully] yet with much modesty: we will trust to your taste for that. On the outside of one of the <hi rend="italic">boards</hi> (of course not on the <hi rend="italic">back</hi>) there should be legible, within a border, the Letters &#x201C;H.M.B.&#x201D; (which mean Harriet Montague Baring) and <pb id="pg-19-155" n="19:155"/>&#x201C;Addiscombe&#x201D; (the place of residence).&#x2014; &#x2014; These are rather singular duties to impose upon you! Nevertheless I will trust to your goodness for doing them even with pleasure. And pray observe farther: I cannot consent to the operation at all unless you leave the whole <hi rend="italic">money</hi> part of it to be settled by myself with the Bookseller here; that is an absolute condition, a <foreign><hi rend="italic">sine qu&#xe2; non!</hi></foreign>&#x2014;</p>
<p>Another Lady<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably Louisa Baring, Lady Harriet&#x2019;s sister-in-law. When the books arrived, they were all sent to Lady Harriet; see <ref target="volume-19/lt-18450923-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1845-09-23">23 Sept.</date></ref></note> has employed me in another somewhat singular thing of the Book kind,&#x2014;which also, when your hand is in, I may as well ask you to do. It is to send a Copy of the established <hi rend="italic">Domestic-Cookery Book</hi> of Germany! We wish to see what the Germans live upon; and perhaps to make incidental experiments of our own out of that. Any <foreign><hi rend="italic">Gn&#xE4;dige Frau</hi></foreign> [lady] acquainted with her duties will direct you what the right Book is. It need not be bound; it is for use: to get the right Book is the great point. I hope you will so far approve this International Tendency, and new virtuosity on the part of high persons here, as to lend due help in the matter!&#x2014; &#x201C;Absolute condition,&#x201D; or &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">sine qu&#xe2; non</hi></foreign>,&#x201D; as in the former case.</p>
<p>I sent by a private hand,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Plattnauer; see <ref target="volume-19/lt-18450613-TC-KAVE-01">TC to KAVE, <date when="1845-06-13">13 June</date></ref>.</note> some two months ago, a couple of Copies of <hi rend="italic">Schiller&#x2019;s Life,</hi> with the Autograph you had kindly lent me. My Messenger reported that you were gone to the Baths; where I suppose you still are. I hope, well?&#x2014;</p>
<p>In <date when="1845-11-00">November</date> you will get Cromwell&#x2019;s Letters; which I hope you will be able to read. I have had a really frightful business of it with that book, which grew in my hands into rather unexpected shape;&#x2014;which still detains me here, now that all the world has quitted London. <closer><salute>Accept many salutations and kind wishes from</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dearest Babbie</salute>
<p>After all it is but a fortnight past on Friday that I have been here, and it was the end of the first week when I got your letter&#x2014; Not that I would justify myself the least in the world&#x2014; When one is from home&#x2014;out of one&#x2019;s usual routine the weeks look like months and this for <hi rend="italic">me</hi> as well as for you&#x2014; So that I have been thinking my own silence as long as you have done&#x2014; The fact is simply that I have been indulging in a quite oriental fit of <pb id="pg-19-156" n="19:156"/>indolence&#x2014;&#x201C;consulting my sensations&#x201D; all day long&#x2014;and so forwarding the great object of my being here, <foreign>viz</foreign>: <hi rend="italic">accummulating atoms</hi>&#x2014;and getting my nerve-strings screwed up to something like <hi rend="italic">living</hi>-pitch. I come down to breakfast betwixt eight and nine&#x2014;dinner is at half past one&#x2014;that I may dine at such an early hour without doing violence to my stomach I have to take plenty of exercise before&#x2014;indeed it is wasting the goods of Providence to be in the midst of &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">nature</hi>&#x2019; without running about in it at all hours. so I have always to take a drive in the gig, or a walk on the shore, or somewhere, before half past one&#x2014;and as the post leaves at two my writing must be done <hi rend="italic">immediately</hi> after breakfast and must not take up too much time in the doing&#x2014;and just consider that I am bound by my marriage obligations to write to my husband <hi rend="italic">almost</hi> every day!! After dinner we&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">speculate</hi>! (Geraldine being still here) and I get my feet rubbed&#x2014;and I saunter on the lawn inhaling &#x201C;change of air&#x201D; and I glance into french novels&#x2014;do anything rather than write&#x2014;then after tea at half past five comes music and chess&#x2014;and we are all in bed by <hi rend="italic">ten</hi>!!! This life is not very industrious but it is very favourable to accummulation of atoms accordingly the fatness which I got at Hoylake has been growing more and more solid&#x2014;nay Geraldine and M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Paulet have even fancied to perceive a dawn of <hi rend="italic">colour</hi> in my cheeks&#x2014;but <hi rend="italic">that</hi> I must say seems to me a mere fancy&#x2014; Certainly I feel much better than when I left London&#x2014;and have a &#x201C;wholesome desire&#x201D; (as Carlyle would say) to continue my present life for the next six months&#x2014; Nothing can exceed M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Paulets kindness which is as judicious as it is cordial&#x2014;and Geraldine is very nice this year&#x2014;much <hi rend="italic">calmer</hi> than I ever saw her&#x2014; Decidely that explosion of folly with Robertson has done her good&#x2014; I protest against company and am allowed to have my way in that as in everything else&#x2014; One day we had the Martineaus&#x2014;and last Saturday my admirer M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Rawlins and a parcel of fat people of the neighbourhood to meet him and his sulky wife&#x2014;but with these exceptions we have had no visitors&#x2014; Maggie would tell you of the little party at M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Ames&#x2019;s&#x2014;but not how <hi rend="italic">pretty</hi> she herself looked&#x2014; She and Julia Paulet<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Paulets&#x2019; fifteen-year-old da.</note> were the prettiest pair imaginable sitting together in &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">all the charms of innocence</hi>&#x201D; in the middle of the room&#x2014; There was a dreadful little old M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Yates who wished to make himself agreeable to me but I gave him (figuratively speaking) one box on the ear after another till he was obliged to get about his business&#x2014;only figure the old goose asking me &#x201C;what M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle said about Oliver Cromwells <hi rend="italic">crimes</hi>&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;his <hi rend="italic">what</hi>&#x201D;? said I&#x2014;&#x201C;the horrible atrocities he excercised on the Irish&#x201D;? &#x201C;Pooh! said I&#x2014;you mean the massacre or two&#x2014; Oh nothing can be more <hi rend="italic">brief</hi> than my Husbands treatment of all that&#x201D;&#x2014; &#x201C;But Madam M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle must feel a due horror?&#x201D;&#x2014; &#x201C;Oh not the least horror in <pb id="pg-19-157" n="19:157"/>the world I assure you&#x2014;he considers these two massacres the simplest&#x2014;indeed only way of saving bloodshed&#x201D;!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >During the Irish campaign Cromwell had had ca. 2,500 defenders of Drogheda and ca. 2,000 defenders of Wexford put to the sword, after their towns were stormed; see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 7:54&#x2014;64.</note>&#x2014;the old gentleman bounced back in his chair and spread out his two sets of five fingers&#x2014;like a duck preparing to swim&#x2014;and gave a veritable <hi rend="italic">groan</hi>&#x2014;which made the rest all look&#x2014;wondering what I had said to their little &#x201C;leader of benevolence.&#x201D; Bah!&#x2014;these Socinians are a considerable of a bore!&#x2014; Martineau is too good to be among them&#x2014;yet&#x2014;if he were that&#x2014;he would not <hi rend="italic">stay</hi> among them&#x2014;but kick his foot thro their whole miserable cobwebery&#x2014;</p>
<p>We were to have gone for two days to Holywell the Saturday before last&#x2014;but the skies prohibited&#x2014;tomorrow we are going to dine and stay all night with certain Finchams when I shall see plate glass made&#x2014; I was never in a glass house in my life&#x2014;so the journey may be worth while&#x2014;but I would fully rather stay at home&#x2014; Only I &#x201C;feel it my duty&#x201D; to take all the air and exercise I can get</p>
<p>My gold pen is intolerably <hi rend="italic">stiff</hi> this day&#x2014;the paper does not suit it&#x2014; Carlyle sees no chance of getting away before the <date when="1845-09-01">1<hi rend="italic">st</hi> of September</date>&#x2014; I shall probably stay here till he comes and give up all idea of Wales&#x2014;&#x2014; I am not a hunter of the Picturesque&#x2014;and in all other respects I fancy Seaforth more after my heart than that Welsh Mansion would be&#x2014;and I shall have opportunity of cultivating my &#x201C;everlasting friendship&#x201D; with Miss Wynn in London<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For the proposed visit to Charlotte Williams Wynn in Wales, see <ref target="volume-19/lt-18450717-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1845-07-17">17 July</date></ref>.</note>&#x2014;a hundred kisses to my own dear Uncle&#x2014;</p>

<p>I &#x201C;did intend&#x201D; that you should have had plenty of letter today but the pigs have run thro it<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Played havoc with; coterie speech; cf. <ref target="volume-14/lt-18420715-JWC-MAWE-01"><sic>14:226</sic><corr>JWC to MAWE, <date when="1842-07-15">15 July 1842</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014;and be hanged to them&#x2014; A letter is come from Jeanie which I have had to answer in the first instance and the post leaves so ridiculously early&#x2014; Jeanie might have waited so far as herself was <pb id="pg-19-158" n="19:158"/>concerned; so that my Good had the benefit of her waiting&#x2014;in her present apathetic phasis anything like &#x201C;anxiety&#x201D; might have been a wholesome emotion for her&#x2014;but my <hi rend="italic">Uncle</hi> had taken it into <hi rend="italic">his</hi> head to be <hi rend="italic">anxious</hi> about me&#x2014;had ordered her to beg that I would send &#x201C;one line&#x201D;&#x2014;which of course means many&#x2014;and my Uncle takes impatience after the true Welsh-fashion&#x2014;so as to be tormented with it himself, and to torment everybody about him&#x2014;besides he is an old man&#x2014;and my one Uncle&#x2014;and very fond of me withal&#x2014;So I have written <hi rend="italic">them</hi> a satisfactory letter and my Good must content himself with a hasty one&#x2014;</p>
<p>This is the Fincham day and according to use and wont <hi rend="italic">I</hi> have broken down&#x2014;thanks to Geraldine chiefly&#x2014;who put me in such a passion yesterday afternoon when&#x2014;&#x201C;for reasons which it may be interesting <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to state&#x201D;&#x2014;a passion was peculiarly hurtful to me&#x2014;that I could not sleep for hours after I went to bed&#x2014;the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> sleepless night I have had since I came here. Up to yesterday she had behaved like an angel&#x2014;but verily yesterday she &#x2018;had a devil&#x2019; and as usual selected <hi rend="italic">me</hi> for the object of her fury&#x2014;&#x201C;<hi rend="italic">because</hi>&#x201D;&#x2014;as she tells me when it is over&#x2014;she &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">loves</hi> me better than all the rest of the world put together!&#x201D; I had my experience of last year to guide me in this last emergence&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">ignoring</hi> her impertinence then only served to prolong it for three days&#x2014;so this time I put her down <foreign><hi rend="italic">par vive force</hi></foreign> [by main force] So long as she merely cried and sulked in rooms by herself <hi rend="italic">looking daggers</hi> at me whenever I appeared I took no notice; but when she set herself down beside M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Paulet and me in the evening&#x2014;and fell to speaking <hi rend="italic">at me</hi> the most inconceivable rudenesses&#x2014;I rose up abruptly and said in a good hearty rage &#x201C;Geraldine until you can behave like a <hi rend="italic">gentlewoman</hi>&#x2014;if not like a woman of commonsense, I cannot possibly remain in the same room with you&#x201D;&#x2014;and walked off to the Library&#x2014; M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Paulet also left her&#x2014; And in half an hours time she came to me drenched in tears, and making the humblest apologies&#x2014;I had &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">hurt her feelings</hi>&#x201D; in the morning&#x2014;she would not say <hi rend="italic">how</hi>&#x2014;&#x201C;if I were told ever so particularly I could not <hi rend="italic">understand it</hi>&#x2014;nor M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Paulet either&#x2014;it was a something in my
<hi rend="italic">manner</hi> that grated on her soul&#x2014;&#x201D;!!

<p><salute>Thanks Dearest for your nice little Letter;</salute> very welcome to me, as they all are that you write. Send a word rather than nothing,&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">literally</hi> so after the common term of pause: it will keep the morbid imagination quiet, and teach me to hope in a fruitfuller Tomorrow in respect of Goodyisms.&#x2014; I know not if you mean to take Egypt&#x2019;s Advice, and write some Book? I have often said you might with successful effect: but the impulse, the necessity has mainly to come from within; it is a poor trade otherwise! So we will be content with Goody whether she ever come to a Book or not. One way or other all the Light and Order and Energy, and genuine <foreign><hi rend="italic">Thatkraft</hi></foreign> [energy] or Available-Virtue we had does come out of us, and goes very infallibly into the God&#x2019;s-treasury living and working thro&#x2019; Eternities there;&#x2014;very infallibly, whether the Morning-Papers say much about it, or say nothing; whether the wages we get be more or be less! We are not lost; not a solitary atom of us,&#x2014;of one of us. When I think of an Oliver Cromwell, and of the Fathers of a Burns,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Burnes (<date when="1721-00-00">1721</date>&#x2013;<date when="1884-00-00">84</date>), whom TC deeply respected: &#x201C;a man of thoughtful, intense, earnest character, as the best of our peasants are &#x2026; a man with a keen insight and a devout heart. &#x2026; Such a father is seldom found in any rank in society&#x201D; (&#x201C;Burns,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 26:293).</note> and other such phenomena, I am very indifferent on the Book side. Greater, I often think, is he that can hold his peace; that can <hi rend="italic">do</hi> his bit of Light instead of speaking it!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Zoe<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jewsbury.</note> seems to be a very crank machine; jealous on account of a wretched Egyptian &#x201C;Because&#x201D;: keep an eye upon her, do not swear eternal friendship with her beyond what she is up to!&#x2014; On the whole, if that Rawlins was your man, probably you have lost nothing but the <hi rend="italic">drive</hi>.</p>
<p>We had a plunge of rain on Tuesday; yesterday a tempest of dusty wind; today the Sun is out and all brilliant. My head continues dully aching; <pb id="pg-19-161" n="19:161"/>which I begin to impute to continual use of <hi rend="italic">carrots</hi> as my sole vegetable. Today I am for a fresh experiment on potatoes. I am very dark as to the extreme closing up of Cromwell: but it seems to me as if it lay quite close at hand,&#x2014;some one bright <hi rend="italic">day</hi> all that were wanted for it! Perhaps tomorrow? Really I am quite near it;&#x2014;shall wriggle it out, I do think, in the course of a week.&#x2014; Christie&#x2019;s Hanwell Situation is to be decided today; I fear he has small or no chance for it:&#x2014;he will then be all the readier for the <hi rend="italic">Index;</hi> which I mean to leave in Robson&#x2019;s hands and his. Courage!&#x2014;</p>
    <p>The evening of the wet night I took a notion to stroll, perhaps to have a mouthful of human speech somewhere. I roved up the lanes; asked for Mill: Gone to Belgium, three weeks ago,&#x2014;no speech to be had then? In passing I even pulled the bell of Craik:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Lillie Craik (<date when="1798-00-00">1798</date>&#x2013;<date when="1866-00-00">1866</date>; <ref target="volume-19/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/6586"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), author, friend of the Carlyles since <date when="1835-00-00">1835</date>; nicknamed &#x201C;Creek.&#x201D; Two undated letters in the Yale MSS, probably of <date when="1844-00-00">1844</date> (and not listed in vol. 16), include a discussion of &#x201C;Prices and the value of Money&#x201D; in the seventeenth cent., as given in his <hi rend="italic">Pictorial History</hi>, (<date when="1837-00-00">1837</date>&#x2013;<date when="1841-00-00">41</date>), and offer Cromwellian &#x201C;gleanings &#x2026; brought home with me from &#x2026; the Museum yesterday.&#x201D;</note> it did not ring; I gave no second pull, saying to myself, &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Ach Gott</hi></foreign> it is probably just as well!&#x201D; and continued my walk for an hour farther. Yesterday, amid whirlwinds of dust I galloped round by Highgate; plenty of riding: today there is to be nothing but a walk. In the evening of yesterday, poor Welsh Redwood came in; a dreadfully gaunt dull man: very instant for me to visit him again; I was not far from answering &#x201C;Neva&#x2019;!&#x201D;&#x2014; Dugald Christie had sent me a gentle invitation to Dinner,&#x2014;an improbable thing! But he had been busy about Cromwell-rubbish of mine; had called &#x26;c: I decided to go up after tea in the ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi>. That got me quit of Redwood,&#x2014;and I went. Helps and another Cambridge Vacancy in white neck<supplied>[c]</supplied>loth<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted. &#x201C;Cambridge vacancy&#x201D; unidentified but possibly Charles Morris Roupell; see <ref target="volume-19/lt-18451005-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1845-10-05">5 Oct.</date>]</ref>.</note> were there; Christie himself dull and narrow; a little Wife full of vivacity and the smallest of talk;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mrs. W. D. Christie not further identified. The Christies had a son, William Henry (<date when="1842-00-00">1842</date>&#x2013;ca. <date when="1885-00-00">85</date>).</note> the House extremely small, with shut doors and a potent oil-lamp:&#x2014; Part of my headache, I believe, is due to all that, tho&#x2019; I drank merely one small cup of coffee and did not stay above an hour. <foreign>Eheu</foreign> [Alas]&#x2014;what a business is the society of Adam&#x2019;s Posterity becoming for me! A <hi rend="italic">considerable</hi> of a bore for most part.&#x2014; Helps walked home to the door with me. We saw Green the aeronaut just got aloft from Vauxhall;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >After Green&#x2019;s ascent from Vauxhall Gardens, a famous place of entertainment, the balloon was blown thirty mi. E of London and badly damaged on landing.</note> throwing out all manner of fireworks, red, green, and indigo-coloured stars, and transitory milky-ways, the best he could poor devil. He was hanging a goodish way up in the air; quite invisible except a fluster of confused fire-works which looked very small in <pb id="pg-19-162" n="19:162"/>the great waste deep of things, and he did not last above half a minute in all. No paltrier phenomenon was ever contrived for the solacement of human souls. I figured the wretched mortal sailing thro&#x2019; the chill clear moonshiny night, destitute of <hi rend="italic">any</hi> object now, and with peril of his life for the sake of keeping his life in; and had a real pity for him.&#x2014;</p>
<p>Elizabeth Pepoli has been here today inquiring for you; &#x201C;she and a lady at the door in a carriage.&#x201D; She came a former day, perhaps a fortnight ago; but I forgot to mention it.</p>
<p>By the bye Christie told me last night that Lawrence the Painter was actually off to Essex copying that head of Cromwell for the Chapman and Hall people.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-19/lt-18450710-TC-EF-01">TC to EF, <date when="1845-07-10">10 July</date></ref>.</note> I am glad of it,&#x2014;if he will do it well.</p>
<p>Do you at due seasons distribute compliments from me to all the Party there? It w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be highly the part of a thrifty Wife to do so! They really are <hi rend="italic">meant</hi> tho not written.</p>
<p><foreign>Adieu</foreign> dear Goody: why should I tattle in this way any more? Walking will be better. Take care of thyself, take care of thyself, and do not get into the way of missing sleep.&#x2014; I will out, and try this headache with a walk. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign> Dearest.</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Fitzgerald,</salute>
<p>Many thanks for your arrangements in behalf of the horse.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >W. K. Browne had agreed to care for the horse during the winter.</note> The substance of the matter promises to do altogether well; and for the details, of time &#x26;c, we will leave those loose, and give due warning, when the day approaches nearer. Heaven knows I ought not and wish not to continue here; but that I shall actually be able to shake the London dust off my feet in 8 days time seems almost too proud a hope! I am under a kind of obligation also to ride down into Bedfordshire myself, to Sir H<hi rend="italic">y</hi> Varney&#x2019;s, a place called <hi rend="italic">Claydon:</hi> I must look on the map, and see how localities agree;&#x2014;the ride, I doubt, will hardly take effect, if they go awry. Nay perhaps Claydon is in <hi rend="italic">Bucks</hi>;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >It is.</note> I must examine: if I had once a moment&#x2019;s time.&#x2014; Meanwhile thank your friend Browne for me very handsomely;&#x2014;and pray send me his Address,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Goldington Hall, Goldington, nr. Bedford.</note> which you have forgotten hitherto; unless Bedford itself be it?&#x2014;</p>
<p>Moreover (for there is no end to me), here is another small job for you. It seems a possibility at present that I may put in somewhere, by way of Appendix, those Anecdotes of Mrs Bendysh, which are in Noble (II.329).<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Cromwell&#x2019;s Grand-daughter by Ireton&#x201D; (FitzGerald&#x2019;s note on MS). Bridget (ca. <date when="1649-00-00">1649</date>&#x2013;<date when="1729-00-00">1729</date>), da. of Henry Ireton and Bridget Cromwell, m. Thomas Bendysh (d. <date when="1707-00-00">1707</date>) of Gray&#x2019;s Inn and Southtown, Gt. Yarmouth. Mark Noble pbd. three &#x201C;Anecdotes of the extraordinary Mrs. Bendysh,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of the Protectoral-House</hi> (<date when="1787-00-00">1787</date>) 2:329&#x2013;46.</note> <pb id="pg-19-166" n="19:166"/>Now will you read those pages of Noble, once more, carefully over, with an eye that way. You will find one does not learn <hi rend="italic">where</hi> Mrs Bendysh lived (&#x2018;near Yarmouth somewhere&#x2019;), what her or her husband&#x2019;s business was, or anything about their economic peculiarities and earthly localities;&#x2014;so that the whole matter looks there very much like a thing in Drury Lane.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The London theater specializing in large-scale historical plays and spectacles.</note></p>
    <p>Now I want you to ask the Essex Archdeacon, or whoever he or she is that descends from this Mrs Bendysh,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Bridget Bendysh&#x2019;s grandda. Mary (d. <date when="1783-00-00">1783</date>) m. William Berners (d. <date when="1783-00-00">1783</date>). Their second son was Archdeacon Henry Denny Berners.</note> Whether there is not in the Family any certain knowledge as to all these points, any clear Tradition even,&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">any</hi> light to be had that would complete what you see to be wanting in the business.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >FitzGerald sent TC&#x2019;s inquiries to Ralph Berners (b. <date when="1803-00-00">1803</date>), Henry Denny&#x2019;s third son, rector of Harkstead and Erwarton, Suffolk. Berners wrote to TC, <date when="1845-09-03">3 Sept.</date>, enclosing a letter of <date when="1845-09-01">1 Sept.</date> from Dawson Turner (<date when="1775-00-00">1775</date>&#x2013;<date when="1858-00-00">1858</date>; <ref target="volume-19/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/27846"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>; see <ref target="volume-18/lt-18441210-TC-EF-01"><sic>18:280</sic><corr>TC to EF, <date when="1844-12-10">10 Dec. 1844</date></corr></ref>), botanist and antiquary of Gt. Yarmouth, who said: &#x201C;You will find some particulars of Mrs. Bendish in two of the early N<hi rend="italic">os</hi> of the Gentleman&#x2019;s Magazine. &#x2026; I was not aware that she ever managed the Saltworks, which are still standing opposite my window, &#x26; were, of course, the property of your family.&#x201D; Turner did not recall her house but remembered seeing several of her letters in &#x201C;a memoir of Isaac Watts&#x201D; (MS: NLS 1766.156).</note> You have a <hi rend="italic">Noble</hi> have you not? Or can get one about Bedford? I could cut you out those leaves and send them by post. Perhaps that will be best? You will then at once see what is wanting in general there. For the rest, the thing if at all will be needed in a day or two.&#x2014; So here <hi rend="italic">go</hi> the leaves at a venture! Edit them yourself (make them ready for editing): that is a task I set you! <hi rend="italic">Till this day week:</hi>&#x2014;then return them to me with what you have made out.</p>
<p>Laurence, I am told, is now down in that quarter; actually gone thither with commission to take the Portrait.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cooper&#x2019;s miniature of Cromwell. Ralph Berners wrote, <date when="1845-09-03">3 Sept.</date>: &#x201C;You will be glad to hear that Laurence has been very successful in copying the miniature.&#x201D;</note></p>

<p><salute>Dearest&#x2014;</salute>Thanks again for your long Letter; may your shadow never be less! You are an excellent little historical genius, and one of the cheerfullest correspondents that ever took pen.</p>
<p>I read of Story in the Newspaper; he is going to Christen some Duke of Argyle&#x2019;s child; your meeting must have been a thing of interest:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Douglas Sutherland Campbell (<date when="1845-00-00">1845</date>&#x2013;<date when="1914-00-00">1914</date>), later 9th duke of Argyll; b. <date when="1845-08-06">6 Aug.</date> at Stafford House, St. James, son of George Douglas Campbell (<date when="1823-00-00">1823</date>&#x2013;<date when="1900-00-00">1900</date>), marquess of Lorne and later 8th duke, and Elizabeth Georgiana, b. Sutherland Leveson-Gower (<date when="1824-00-00">1824</date>&#x2013;<date when="1878-00-00">78</date>), marchioness of Lorne (m. <date when="1844-00-00">1844</date>). His great uncle, George William Campbell (<date when="1768-00-00">1768</date>&#x2013;<date when="1839-00-00">1839</date>), 6th duke, had presented Story to his living at Roseneath.</note> I remember <pb id="pg-19-167" n="19:167"/>the man very well. Life a Drama!&#x2014; Do not seduce poor James Martineau from his unitarian manger, poor fellow! I do not in the least want proselytes, &#x2014;<foreign><hi rend="italic">ach Gott</hi></foreign> no, what is the use of them!&#x2014;and for himself it might cut off the very staff of bread. Let him hang on there, till the rope of itself give way with him.</p>
    <p>If you renounce the Welsh Project, which must depend altogether on your own spirit towards it, then you are very sure to see me if you continue staying there! My one fixed element of a plan is to go to Annandale; and the way thither <hi rend="italic">leads</hi> me thro&#x2019; Lancashire. I could also be a very pretty guest at Seaforth, I too for a few days, and be happy and much liked,&#x2014;if the devil of Sleeplessness and Indigestion did not mark me for a peculiar man! I bid you stay there, however, for a week yet; then my plans will be riper: I do hope to have done all my Oliver <hi rend="italic">writing</hi> (Good Heavens!) the day after tomorrow. The rest will then be tying up of thrums; making final arrangements, and getting under way.&#x2014;&#x2014; Christie will have the <hi rend="italic">Index</hi> ready in time: poor fellow, they never let him come to the poll yesterday; he was not &#x201C;Thirty years old,&#x201D; that was a <foreign><hi rend="italic">sine-qu&#xe2;-non</hi></foreign>.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Christie was too young for an interview for the post at Middlesex Asylum, Hanwell; see <ref target="volume-19/lt-18450806-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1845-08-06">6 Aug.</date></ref> He went on to try for a post with James Orchard Halliwell, later Halliwell-Phillips (<date when="1820-00-00">1820</date>&#x2013;<date when="1889-00-00">89</date>; <ref target="volume-19/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/12020"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), biographer, librarian, and ed.

Replying to Halliwell&#x2019;s advert. in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, <date when="1845-08-28">28 Aug.</date>, Christie wrote, <date when="1845-08-28">28 Aug.</date>, from 21 University St., Bedford Sq., that he had worked for the &#x201C;last twelvemonth&#x201D; for TC, who &#x201C;can give you a very good opinion of me&#x201D; (MS: EUL).</note> I have likewise today written to Fitzgerald about another detail I wanted;&#x2014;which I think is the last. He settles concerning the horse as you see; I have not yet accepted in any binding way. Have you actually not heart for a gig? Certainly the thing might be done, one w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> think! <hi rend="italic">Half</hi> a horse for riding purposes would really suit me better than whole: I mean, to ride on alternate days.&#x2014; Keep me that leaf of Fitz&#x2019;s Letter which has the road-directions in it.</p>
    <p>Fuz<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Forster.</note> came here the night before last; talked long, or was talked to, really not in a quite distracted manner; and passionately solicited and thankfully received&#x2014;your Address. He is pretty well, after being again a little ill. They (Dickens, he and a squad of that sort) have decided to act a Play at one of the small Theatres (private,&#x2014;to &#x2018;500&#x2019; friends): it is actually to be, on the 21st of next month;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ben Jonson&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Every Man in his Humour</hi> performed, <date when="1845-09-20">20 Sept.</date>, at Miss Kelly&#x2019;s Theatre, 73 Dean St., with Forster as Kitely and Dickens as Bobadil.</note>&#x2014;and it is an immense feature of it to Fuz that <hi rend="italic">you</hi> are to be there.

<salute>Dear Forster,</salute>
<p>I have got done with <hi rend="italic">Cromwell;</hi> I purpose to come to you on Thursday at five o&#x2019;clock. My Brother John has arrived here the other night: shall I bring him with me? If Dickens would come over and join us, would it not be beautiful:&#x2014;but I suppose there is no chance of that!</p>
<p>You see what a pretty thing I am making of it, having got it all my own way. But at bottom nevertheless, it is to be all your way. I, namely, without escort or other circumstance, will come to you any afternoon you like between this and Monday, if you will tell me which,&#x2014;Thursday is no better to me than another day, except that some one must be named.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC is writing on Tues.</note></p>

<p><salute>My Goody,&#x2014;</salute>I am very deep today in the settling of rubbish; tying up of Cromwell fragments &#x26;c &#x26;c: I have ordered my horse at 1 o&#x2019;clock, and will<hi rend="italic">ride</hi> to Robson the Printer,&#x2014;will try that, if the streets prove not too uncomfortable for me. Ellen is washing my things! Nothing now but fastening up of <hi rend="italic">thrums;</hi> that I may leave the Loom in some tolerable state, and be off!&#x2014; The worst thrum is my horse; but I have many very many thrums!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Tomorrow evening at five, unless Fuz contradict, I am to go and dine with him; that will be one thing done. I had promised to Browning, but only &#x201C;if possible&#x201D;: most likely it will not be &#x201C;possible.&#x201D; I must also be off from Sir H<hi rend="italic">y</hi> Varney and his Visit. Looking at the Maps I find he is not in Bedford at all, but in Bucks County: I at one time thought of riding my horse up to Bedford in that way myself;&#x2014;but that now is off. Besides I am <pb id="pg-19-172" n="19:172"/>bilious! Visits among commonplace Strangers are not to be thought of in these circumstances.</p>

<salute>Dear Miss Baring,</salute>
<p>I am told they have given you an unbeautiful Nickname, the authorship of which they have the cruelty to impute to me! From my heart I disown the calcumnious imputation. I even mean to constitute you a Reader of my Books; thereby to shew that I entertain far other thoughts of you. Here is a volume which no &#x201C;Spooney&#x201D; ever read, or can read!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Her nickname was presumably &#x201C;Spooney.&#x201D; In <date when="1844-00-00">1844</date> TC had teased her about her pro-royalist views on Charles I; see <ref target="volume-18/lt-18440921-TC-LAAL-01"><sic>18:220</sic><corr>TC to LAAL, <date when="1844-09-21">21 Sept. 1844</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-18/lt-18441229-TC-LAAL-01"><sic>302</sic><corr>TC to LAAL, <date when="1844-12-29">29 Dec. 1844</date></corr></ref>. The vol. was probably the second printing of <hi rend="italic">Past and Present</hi> (<date when="1845-00-00">1845</date>). In reply she wrote from Alverstoke, ca. <date when="1845-08-31">31 Aug.</date>: &#x201C;I <hi rend="italic">must</hi> candidly confess that I have more than once read your book, &#x26; with some advantage, but I shall now study it, &#x26; I hope to overcome all those spooney prejudices which so strongly excite your indignation. If some latent feelings of weakness or compassion (call them by whichever name you chuse) towards the poor Martyr should still hover about my heart, you must attribute them rather to the tenderness than the perversity of my nature.&#x201D;</note> Pray accept it from me, and make it yours in all ways, and let the loose tongues of mankind babble at their pleasure!&#x2014;</p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I know you will be very glad to hear that I have actually got done with this Book of mine; the last line that I had to write of it is now written! There remain some adjustments with Printers &#x26;c, and a few Proofsheets still to look over; but that is nothing; that will not now detain me here. I am getting all things set in order; I mean to be off with all the speed that may be. The Book is not to be published till <date when="1845-10-00">October</date> next, the Town being all empty of people at present: but I hope to bring you a Copy or the greater part of a Copy along with me; and I am sure you will like most part of it: all Cromwell&#x2019;s part is after your own heart; and indeed intrinsically very excellent. I do not think there is in the world the History of so truly Christian a man. I think my toil on it not ill bestowed.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-19-174" n="19:174"/>But now for the journey Northward. Jane is still with her friends in the Liverpool region; a place called Seaforth House some four or five miles from Liverpool: I am to stay there a little while with her, perhaps a week, or as long as I can hold out; I am trying if I can get away from this next Wednesday. Jane will not come across with me, I think; she wants to be home again. But I come across myself, the instant the Seaforth Business is done; and Jamie from Annan foot brings me up to Scotsbring once again!</p>
<p>Dear Mother, if you are getting a little good sea-bathing, do not let this disturb you; but continue there till you hear farther. I will write again from Seaforth; from Chelsea if there be any delay here: You will learn in plenty of time when I am coming. And so let us all hope for a merciful meeting once more. A great and peculiar blessing; for which one&#x2019;s heart would be hard if it were not in some measure thankful!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Jack came to me a few days ago from his Watering-place: he is very well in health, very brisk in spirits. He has no plan at present, I think; but does not intend towards Annandale again just yet. Today I have lent him my horse; and he is off to Richmond, to see Ogilvy his old Irish Patient,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Ogilby; see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400101-TC-JCA-01"><sic>12:4</sic><corr>TC to JCA, <date when="1840-01-01">1 Jan. 1844</date></corr></ref>.</note> who he hears is much better now.</p>
<p>Poor Marry<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Austin.</note> still seems to be complaining, and poor Isabella at Scotsbrig is in a very sad way. John does not seem to be in any alarm about Mary; but wishes she would well resist the <hi rend="italic">dispiritment</hi> of her complaint: that is always one of the heaviviest<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> effects of it. Jenny will have plenty of shirts to make me!&#x2014; <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign> dear good Mother. My blessing with one and all of you.</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>The Groom will start from this place with the Horse on Monday Morning, and be at the Red Lion in Bedford, by the route you prescribe, early on Tuesday I suppose. If you will be so obliging as fulfil the kind outline you traced by Fitzgerald in this manner, I shall take it as a real favour done me.</p>
<p>Since I wrote to Fitzgerald there has a small accident befallen, which looks much uglier than it is: at York Gate in the Regent&#x2019;s Park one day, on perfectly plain road, and at a walking pace, the horse suddenly got upon his <pb id="pg-19-175" n="19:175"/>knees,&#x2014;recovered again without difficulty, but was found to have broken the skin on one of them. The Groom calculated here on getting over it without any mark; recommends now &#x201C;a slight blister&#x201D; to be applied to the place. I will thank you very much if you will please to take a look at the thing, and order what is fit to be done,&#x2014;if anything.&#x2014;&#x2014; I conclude the poor horse had trod upon a bit of sharp flint. I never rode a horse with sounder legs and feet.</p>

<p><salute>My dear</salute> I find you excessively provoking&#x2014; Now that you are done with your work why cannot you <hi rend="italic">appoint a day</hi> for being off&#x2014; I made sure of knowing by todays letter when you would come&#x2014;and not a word on the subject! I have been to Liverpool&#x2014;started before the post came in, and was flying back faster than the horses to get your letter&#x2014;and <foreign>voila</foreign>&#x2014;&#x201C;speculations&#x201D; about dining with Scott Browning &#x26;c &#x26;c I am quite angry and that is the truth of it&#x2014;for if I had thought you were to dawdle so long I would have been at home with you by this time&#x2014;</p>
<p>&#x2014;The worst for <hi rend="italic">you</hi> is that I have not time to subside&#x2014;for the starting hour of the post is just at hand&#x2014; Certainly I did not expect you <hi rend="italic">this</hi> week&#x2014;but&#x2014;I expected to have got by this time a &#x201C;fixed point&#x201D; for my expectation&#x2014;</p> 
<p>I would not have written at all till I could write in better humour and with greater deliberation but you said something about &#x201C;morbid fancies&#x201D; and I am not disappointed enough to wish to inflict such on you while there is a minutes time left to hinder them&#x2014;</p>

<salute>Dear Emerson,</salute>
<p>Your Letter,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1845-06-29">29 June</date>.</note> which had been very long expected, has been in my hand above a month now; and still no answer sent to it. I thought of answering <pb id="pg-19-177" n="19:177"/>straightway; but the day went by, days went by;&#x2014;and at length I decided to wait till my insupportable Burden (the &#x201C;Stupidity of Two Centuries&#x201D; as I call it, which is a heavy load for one man!) were rolled off my shoulders, and I could resume the <hi rend="italic">habit</hi> of writing Letters, which has almost left me for many months. By the unspeakable blessing of Heaven that consummation has now arrived, about four days ago I wrote my last word on <hi rend="italic">Cromwell&#x2019;s Letters and Speeches;</hi> and one of the earliest uses I make of my recovered freedom is to salute you again. The Book is nearly printed: two big volumes; about a half of it, I think, my own; the real utterances of the man Oliver Cromwell once more legible to earnest men. Legible really to an unexpected extent: for the Book took quite an unexpected figure in my hands; and is now a kind of Life of Oliver, the best that circumstances would permit me to do: whether either I or England shall be, in my time, fit for a better, remains submitted to the Destinies at present. I have tied up the whole Puritan Paper-Litter (considerable masses of it still unburnt) with tight strings, and hidden it at the bottom of my deepest repositories: there shall <hi rend="italic">it</hi>, if Heaven please, lie dormant for a time and times.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Some of this material was pbd. by Alexander Carlyle in <hi rend="italic">Historical Sketches</hi> (<date when="1898-00-00">1898</date>), and the papers are in Strouse. Other draft papers are in FC and at Yale.</note> Such an element as I have been in, no human tongue can give account of. The disgust of my sould has been great; a really <hi rend="italic">pious</hi> labour: worth very little when I have done it; but the best I could do; and that is quite enough. I feel the liveliest gratitude to the gods that I have got out of it alive. The Book is very dull, but it is actually legible: all the ingenious faculty I had, and ten times as much would have been useful there, has been employed in elucidation; in saying, and chiefly in forbearing to say,&#x2014;in annihilating continents of brutal wreck and dung: <foreign>Ach Gott!</foreign>&#x2014; But in fact you will see it by and by; and then form your own conclusions about it. They are going to publish it in <date when="1845-10-00">October</date>, I find: I tried hard to get you a complete copy of the Sheets by this Steamer; but it proves to be flatly impossible;&#x2014;perhaps luckily; for I think you would have been bothering yourself with some new Bookseller negociation about it; and that, as Copyright and other matters now stand, is a thing I cannot recommend.&#x2014; Enough of it now: only let all my silences and other shortcomings be explained thereby. I am now off for the North Country, for a snatch still at the small remnants of Summer, and a little free air and sunshine. I am really far from well, tho&#x2019; I have been riding diligently for three months back, and doing what I could to help myself.</p>
<p>Very glad shall I be, my Friend, to have some new utterances from you either in verse or in prose! What you say about the vast <hi rend="italic">imperfection</hi> of all <pb id="pg-19-178" n="19:178"/>modes of utterance is most true indeed.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson had written: &#x201C;Where all writing is such a caricature of the subject, what signifies whether the form is a little more or less ornate &#x26; luxurious.&#x201D; He announced his intention to publish a book of verse, although he believed that TC would not look favorably upon it.</note> Let a man speak and sing, and do, and sputter and gesticulate as he may,&#x2014;the meaning of him is most ineffectually shewn forth, poor fellow; rather <hi rend="italic">indicated</hi> as if by straggling symbols, than <hi rend="italic">spoken</hi> or visually expressed! Poor fellow! So the great rule is, That he <hi rend="italic">have</hi> a good manful meaning, and then that he take what &#x201C;mode of utterance&#x201D; is honestly the readiest for him.&#x2014; I wish you would take an American Hero, one whom you really love; and give us of a History of him,&#x2014;make an artistic bronze statue (in good <hi rend="italic">words</hi>) of his Life and him! I do indeed.&#x2014; But speak of what you will, you are welcome to me. Once more I say, No other voice in this wide waste world seems to my sad ear to be <hi rend="italic">speaking</hi> at all at present. The more is the pity for us.</p>
<p>I forbid you to plague yourself any farther with these Philadelphia or other Booksellers.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edward L. Carey of Carey &#x26; Hart had just died, and Emerson was worried that this would affect publication. He had written an &#x201C;advertisement,&#x201D; dated <date when="1845-06-00">June</date>, which Carey &#x26; Hart used, vouching for TC&#x2019;s &#x201C;concurrence in this new Edition &#x2026; and his expressed satisfaction in the author&#x2019;s share of pecuniary benefit which your justice and liberality have secured to him in anticipation of the sale.&#x201D; See also <ref target="volume-19/lt-18450216-TC-RWE-01">TC to RWE, <date when="1845-02-16">16 Feb.</date></ref></note> If you could hinder them to promulgate any copy of that frightful picture by Lawrence, or indeed any picture at all, I had rather stand as a shadow than as a falsity in the minds of my American friends: but this too we are prepared to encounter.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson had written that Carey &#x26; Hart had sent him a copy of the Philadelphian John Sartain&#x2019;s engraving from their watercolor copy of Laurence&#x2019;s oil: &#x201C;They were eager to have the engraving pronounced a good likeness. I showed it to <supplied>[Charles]</supplied> Sumner, &#x26; <supplied>[Le Baron]</supplied> Russell, &#x26; Theodore Parker,&#x2014;who had seen you long since I had, &#x26; they shook their heads unanimously &#x26; declared D&#x2019;Orsay&#x2019;s profile was much more like.&#x201D; Carey &#x26; Hart&#x2019;s edn. of the <hi rend="italic">Miscellanies</hi> (Philadelphia, <date when="1845-00-00">1845</date>) used the engraving. For D&#x2019;Orsay&#x2019;s <date when="1839-00-00">1839</date> profile, see 11:frontispiece, <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390526-TC-JAC-01"><sic>113</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1839-05-26">26 May 1839</date></corr></ref>.</note><figure><graphic url="volume-11-frontispiece.gif"/><p>Frontispiece, CL Volume 11</p><p><hi rend="italic">CL</hi></p></figure> And as for the money of these men,&#x2014;if they will pay it, good and welcome; if they will not pay it, let them keep it with what blessing there may be in it! I have your noble Offices in that and in other such matters already unforgettably sure to me; and, in real fact, that is almost exactly the whole of valuable that could exist for me in the affair. <foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Friend. Write to me again; I will write again at more leisure. <closer><salute>Yours always.</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>Oh impatient Goody!</salute> What an image you have got of the possibilities of human travel! Nothing to do but rub one&#x2019;s bill on one&#x2019;s toe, take wing, and straightway arrive!&#x2014;&#x2014; I said yesterday, the likeliest day was Wednesday; but we can yet appoint no day. Chapman has been here this morning: I am off into the City to send away money,&#x2014;to make an attempt to get myself a pair of gloves and other things! The female mind is very impatient, and knows little about the impediments that obstruct an unfortunate man. I have also written to Emerson; shall have other letters to write; then a ride in the evening&#x2014;the last but <hi rend="italic">two</hi>. This morning there is a Letter from Alick: very sad as usual, but wholesome-looking too; it has to go off directly to my Mother, if Jack had seen it. He is out, I think, roving over the Earth.</p>
<p>I meant to send Miss Donaldson<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jean Donaldson.</note> a Copy of the new <hi rend="italic">Past and Present:</hi> can you tell me any other in your sphere who requires and deserves one?&#x2014;</p>
<p>Do not forget to send me Fitzgerald&#x2019;s plan of the route to Bedford: it will be needed on Sunday night.</p>
<p>Here is the German Woman&#x2019;s Letter,&#x2014;illegible to you I dare say; but some of the Seaforth Household will be able to read it. She seems to be somewhat of a fool, and I do not design answering her Letter.&#x2014; What time <hi rend="italic">do</hi> your Letters really arrive at Seaforth? Nay, it is no matter at all! They arrive when they can; and impatient Goodies give them what reception they can!&#x2014; <closer><salute>Take care of yourself till Wednesday or Thursday, poor Goody!</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dearest</salute>
<p>Today I am restored to my normal state&#x2014;of amiability: thro&#x2019; the unassisted efforts of nature, I beg to assure you&#x2014;without having waited for the post hour, and your letter, and the prospect of Wednesday. I am sorry now that I did not repress my little movement of impatience yesterday&#x2014;a <hi rend="italic">lover</hi> <pb id="pg-19-180" n="19:180"/>would have found it charming perhaps, more flattering than whole pages of &#x201C;wits&#x201D; and <foreign><hi rend="italic">dolcezza</hi></foreign> [sweet things]&#x2014;but husbands are so obtuse!&#x2014;they do not <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;understand&#x201D;</hi> one&#x2019;s movements of impatience&#x2014;want always to be &#x201C;treated with the respect due to genius,&#x201D; exact common sense of their poor wives, rather than &#x201C;the finer sensibilities of the heart.&#x201D; And so the marriage-state &#x201C;by working late and early is come to what ye see&#x201D;!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;By working late and early / We&#x2019;re come to what ye see, / Although we made our bridal bed / On clean <foreign>pease strae</foreign> [pea straw]&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note in <hi rend="italic">LM</hi>).</note>&#x2014;if not precisely to immortal smash as yet&#x2014;at least to within a hairsbreadth of it!&#x2014; But the matrimonial-question may lie over till I write my book on &#x201C;the rights of women&#x201D;&#x2014;and make one <hi rend="italic">Egyptian</hi> happy! It is more important just at present that you should be instructed of the state of&#x2014;the tides! With that beautiful spirit of divination which characterizes a good wife I had been propounding this subject at breakfast&#x2014;before you had said a word of seabathing&#x2014;and it happens quite fortunately that next week is the best bathing time thro&#x2019;out the whole year&#x2014; I am afraid you would not be permitted to bathe here <hi rend="italic">naked</hi> any more than at Ostend&#x2014; &#x2014;At least if such a thing got wind all Bootle<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A suburb of Liverpool, nr.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Your Letter arrived here two days ago, and was straightway despatched, after due perusal here, to our Mother and the Friends in the North; all of whom, like us, will be right glad to see it. I happen to be nearly alone here at present; Jane is away in Lancashire for the last month;&#x2014;only Jack, who has been roving about the Country thro&#x2019; the summer, is with me for the last ten days.</p>
<p>You have been working terribly again; too hard, I fear! That was a fault of yours from of old: I also have often cause to remember our Father in that respect, how much wiser he was than I in laying out of strength.&#x2014; I find you still very melancholy, my dear Brother,&#x2014;sad and solitary in your new Country: but on the whole I surely think it is a wholesome way you are in; better and better will come of it as you persevere. Whatsoever a man <hi rend="italic">plants</hi> in this God&#x2019;s-world, it does sooner or later <hi rend="italic">grow</hi> for him. That is true in regard to all spiritual things too; really <hi rend="italic">as</hi> true as in regard to trees and grains. Whatsoever manfulness we shew in any matter, whatsoever virtue or worth we do veritably put forth, does turn to good for us in all ways by and by. Men do not reward us for it; but the Author of Men very infallibly does.&#x2014; One finds all places sad, solitary; earnest labour is one&#x2019;s lot here below. Let us never mind what the people are; let us elbow our own way thro&#x2019; them as faithfully as lies in us: their unsound ways of procedure are a misery to themselves; a thing worthy of pity from us, if of any feeling.</p>
<p>You are fairly getting nestled into that new seat, we find. I wish you <pb id="pg-19-183" n="19:183"/>would give it a name! Have you never thought of any name? You must also in the winter time give us a much fuller description of the whole figure and conditions of it: there was one Letter last year full of description of your neighbours and neighbourhood, which we all found very interesting. And think of a name! Something emblematic; descriptive of the locality, or of your own humour towards it. Pilgrimston, <hi rend="italic">Alex</hi>ton (that is the indisputablest name of all!), <hi rend="italic">Hope</hi>ston, Bield, Screen, Bush &#x26;c &#x26;c.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >It was finally named Bield, meaning &#x201C;shelter&#x201D;; see also <ref target="volume-18/lt-18440617-TC-JCA-01"><sic>18:72</sic><corr>TC to JCA, <date when="1844-06-17">17 June 1844</date></corr></ref>.</note> I shall like to hear of your gradually taking some affection to the place; which, as you see the fruits of your toil spring up there, will not fail in time. You, it is true, as I here, and as all of us or most of us in this world, will never get entirely to feel it as a home: but Tom and little Jane and the rest of them will; and may have great reason to bless the hour when you brought them out there. Bad people in one&#x2019;s neighbourhood is a very sad element: but if there be no good society, you must train the children all the more strictly to stand on their own feet, and front a life of <hi rend="italic">solitude</hi> among their fellow creatures; which is often the lot of those that would be honest here.</p>
<p>Your Canada Harvest seems none of the best; and we here have also great doubts about ours. The Summer has been dim, damp and cold: all things are four weeks <hi rend="italic">later</hi> than they ought to be; which is itself a bad sign. Immense railwaying, and other &#x201C;Speculation,&#x201D; carried to a most wild pitch, is going on; I myself should not wonder if it all broke down on the sudden, and adding itself to a bad harvest, brought great woe upon the working people again. Prosperous or unprosperous it is a very ugly sight to me, such fierce hunting after money. The Carlisle-and-Glasgow railway does now go on; comes across by <hi rend="italic">Cleughbrae,</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Caledonian Railway act (authorizing the Glasgow to Carlisle line) passed <date when="1845-07-31">31 July</date>; the first sod was cut, <date when="1845-10-11">11 Oct.</date>; the line was being surveyed and was to pass &#xBD; mi. E of Ecclefechan through a cutting by a mill called Cleughbrae, on the road to Scotsbrig.</note> I think they say: the poor people will get employed for a while digging at it; but I have small hope of any permanent improvement to <hi rend="italic">them</hi> by means of it.</p>
<p>Our news out of Annandale are still good: our brave old Mother stands out wonderfully; she has been once or twice a little unwell, but on the whole never really ill,&#x2014;rallies into new strength in a day or two again. She is now at the Gill, for a little sea-bathing. Jack was there for two or three weeks in the early part of Summer: he brings a good report in general of them. Mary indeed still continues to suffer; and poor Isabella is perfectly feckless, confined to bed I believe. But Jamie struggles away; his farm is now going to be a few pounds easier for him every year. Jean at Dumfries has got a new Daughter;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Margaret. Scotsbrig rent was reduced because of the repairs that James had carried out; see <ref target="volume-18/lt-18441119-TC-JC-01"><sic>18:270</sic><corr>TC to JC, <date when="1844-11-19">19 Nov. 1844</date></corr></ref>.</note> I had a short Letter from her lately; my correspondence <pb id="pg-19-184" n="19:184"/>there and indeed in all quarters whatsoever has been much curtailed for a while past. I have written as it were no Letters, none at all that I could escape writing.</p>
<p>Now however I am to have a little more leisure. Last week I actually got done with that Book on Cromwell! It is <hi rend="italic">all</hi> gone to the Printers now, indeed all printed but a few sheets; I shall not have much more trouble with it. They are not to publish it till <date when="1845-10-00">October</date>: I hoped to have got you a Copy, and indeed a whole Box of little things for a Gift this Autumn: but, alas, the work grew greatly on me; and in place of ending in <date when="1845-05-00">May</date> or <date when="1845-06-00">June</date>, I am ending now.&#x2014; I am in great bustle at present; getting everything sorted for an instant run Northward. I am to meet Jane in Liverpool; then she returns, and I go on across to Annandale. I have much need of a little country quiet, but shall not get much. I am this day sending off my horse to winter-quarters. It has grown a capital horse, and I have ridden much on it; but nothing can or could keep me well. I am to have the beast maintained for &#xa3;6 in some supportable kind of way till <date when="1846-03-00">March</date> next; then I will try it again perhaps.&#x2014;&#x2014; Jack, as I said, is with me; reading the Sheets of this new Book at present. He does not seem to have any plan for himself; and one of the worst features is, he is wonderfully content with that form of affairs. In fact he is thoroughly idle; and is conscious rather of being <hi rend="italic">busy</hi>. I am often sorry for him poor fellow. I think he will perhaps stay here a while, and then go into Annandale when I have left it.&#x2014; Dear Brother, I have a bad headache, even if my paper were not done. I will write, with more minute news, when I have seen Annandale myself.&#x2014; Mr Greig has been here and in Scotland; he returns by the Steamer that will carry this Letter. I gave him a Copy of <hi rend="italic">Past and Present</hi> for you,&#x2014;a new edition they<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Chapman &#x26; Hall.</note> have just published here;&#x2014;he undertakes to have it sent to you by some conveyance. <closer><salute>Farewell then dear Brother.

<salute><hi rend="small-caps">Dear Sir</hi>,</salute>
<p>I have received your poem;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">The Purgatory of Suicides. A Prison Rhyme in Ten Books</hi> (<date when="1845-00-00">1845</date>), dedicated to TC; see also <ref target="volume-19/lt-18450901-TC-JWC-01">next letter</ref>.</note> and will thank you for that kind gift, and for all the friendly sentiments you entertain towards me,&#x2014;which, as from an evidently sincere man, whatever we may think of them otherwise, are surely valuable to a man.</p>
<p>I have looked into your Poem, and find indisputable traces of genius in <pb id="pg-19-186" n="19:186"/>it,&#x2014;a dark Titanic energy struggling there, for which we 
hope there will be clearer daylight by-and-by! If I might presume to advise I think I would recommend you to try your next work in <hi rend="italic">Prose</hi>, and as a thing turning altogether on <hi rend="italic">Facts</hi>, not Fictions. Certainly the <hi rend="italic">music</hi> that is very traceable here might serve to irradiate into harmony far profitable things than what are commonly called &#x2018;Poems,&#x2019;&#x2014;for which, at any rate, the taste in these days seems to be irrevocably in abeyance. We have too horrible a Practical Chaos round us; out of which every man is called by the birth of him to make a bit of <hi rend="italic">Cosmos:</hi> that seems to me the real Poem for a man,&#x2014;especially at present. I always grudge to see any portion of a man&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">musical talent</hi> (which is the real intellect, the real vitality, or life of him) expended on making mere <hi rend="italic">words</hi> rhyme. These things I say to all my Poetic friends,&#x2014;for I am in real earnest about them: but get almost nobody to believe me hitherto. From you I shall get an excuse at any rate; the purpose of my so speaking being a friendly one towards you.</p>
<p>I will request you farther to accept this book of mine,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >An autographed copy of the new edn. of <hi rend="italic">Past and Present</hi>.</note> and to appropriate what you can of it, &#x2018;Life is a serious thing, &#x2019;as Schiller says,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Prol. to <hi rend="italic">Wallenstein</hi> and epigraph, in its original German, to <hi rend="italic">Past and Present</hi>. In Cooper&#x2019;s dedication TC is mentioned as &#x201C;illustrious Schiller&#x2019;s friend.&#x201D;</note> and as you yourself practically know! These are the words of a serious man about it; they will not altogether be without meaning for you.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I am just in these hours getting out of town; and, not without real regret, must deny myself the satisfaction of seeing you at present.</p>

<p><salute>Dearykin,&#x2014;</salute> I still hold out for Wednesday; if you hear nothing more tomorrow,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Tues.</note> you may consider it fixed. I will come by the Mail Train, the one you came by;&#x2014;and certainly a hospitable vehicle, at such a moment, with a kind Goody in it, to take me to a hospitable house with friendly faces, and a quiet pipe of tobacco, will be very welcome!&#x2014; If I have time I will send a line tomorrow too, in confirmation; but without any line, you <pb id="pg-19-187" n="19:187"/>are to go upon this. I have given up Browning, given up Scott; I have settled Christie&#x2019;s Index, got a pair of gloves; my horse is off this morning,&#x2014;and here has just arrived a Letter<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably from W.

<p>That other Letter accompanied the <hi rend="italic">Purgatory of Suicides</hi>, a dark Titanic Rhapsody, not without energy, in rumbling Spencerian rhyme and at the beginning a Sonnet to me, bearing date <hi rend="small-caps">Stafford Gaol</hi>! For the man is a Chartist of the fiercest.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Cooper&#x2019;s dedicatory sonnet, dated <date when="1845-05-03">3 May</date>, says: &#x201C;Right noble age-fellow, whose speech and thought / Proclaim thee other than the supple throng / &#x2026; a lay untaught / I offer thee. Receive the humble song,&#x2014; / A tribute of the feeble to the strong.&#x201D; Cooper began the poem, <date when="1843-06-10">10 June 1843</date>: &#x201C;The two opening stanzas &#x2026; are the first Spenserean stanzas I ever wrote in my life&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Life</hi> 251). His intro. defended Chartists and the unjust trials they had faced and attacked Sir William Webb Follett (<date when="1798-00-00">1798</date>&#x2013;<date when="1845-00-00">1845</date>), who had prosecuted him.</note> I have sent a copy of <hi rend="italic">Past and Present</hi> (in some faint hope to throw light on him, poor fellow), and have waved the &#x201C;personal interview&#x201D; for the present.</p>
<p>I rejoice in the prospect of sea-bathing; in the prospect of cigars! Could you, however, procure me a good tobacco-pipe or two, and lay them in some greenhouse, they also would be welcome.&#x2014; I have sent off Miss Donaldson&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">P</hi>t <hi rend="italic">and Pres</hi>t; I have one for Mrs Paulet. I could be a very amiable man, really; but I am dreadfully bilious. In fact, almost sick of my life, if there were not some hope of improvement.</p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I have, this day, what I should long ago have done, sent off your Cheetham-Society Book<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">The Life of Adam Martindale</hi> (pbd. Chetham Soc.); see <ref target="volume-19/lt-18450321-TC-JHA-01">TC to <sic>JH</sic><corr>JHA</corr>, <date when="1845-03-21">21 March</date></ref>.</note> to Chapman and Hall, that they may forward it to you by their Bookseller in Manchester. You will receive it at the Guardian Office, about the beginning of next month; and I beg you to accept along <pb id="pg-19-189" n="19:189"/>with it many kind thanks for the loan of it, and for all the unwearied trouble you have otherwise taken on my behalf.</p>
<p>The Book on Cromwell is now out of my hands; I believe the people mean to publish it next month. It is worth little as a Book; but is somewhat like what was possible in the circumstances. I feel like a man delivered from infinite reservoirs of putrid stupidity, the <hi rend="italic">guano</hi> of two Centuries of Owls;&#x2014;if I have rendered the face of a Hero visible athwart all that to some few, it will be well.</p>
<p>I am off tomorrow morning Northward for a little country air. With kind regards to your neighbour Mr Ballantyne, and many thanks to yourself which are all I have to offer for the present,&#x2014;</p>
<closer><salute>Yours always truly /</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name>

<p>My poor Goody is whirling away southward, I have to suppose, in these dim hours, while I sit here giving her some Note of my arrival northward. We are strangely shovelled to and fro in this much too locomotive world!</p>
<p>It was above an hour after you left me before our beastly Steamship got its tumult consummated, and hauled itself out of harbour. In my life I have seen few more distressing and disgusting uproars;&#x2014;indeed the whole voyage surpassed in discomfort for me any piece of travelling I have executed for years. We saw very near at hand the Vanity-Fair of Liverpool Cocknies,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Eastham; see <ref target="volume-19/lt-18450825-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1845-08-25">25 Aug.</date>]</ref>.</note> in full action near the Rock; tents on the sand, swings and whirligigs were very evident; squeaking of fiddles, popping of ginger-beer corks, and the other accompaniments were too conceivable. Hudson our Captain was engaged in clapping <hi rend="italic">handcuffs</hi> on a drunk drover who had proved quarrelsome! <foreign><hi rend="italic">Ach Gott!</hi></foreign> Bootle Church could hardly be discriminated from Seaforth, near which my poor Goody sat at hospitable tea:&#x2014;but, <hi rend="italic">in return</hi>, one of my fellow passengers in the Cabin proved to be that big Thomson the Cattle-dealer who once called at Chelsea with Macqueen;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Hudson of the <hi rend="italic">Royal Victoria</hi>, Jock Thomson of Annan, and John MacQueen of Craigenputtoch; see <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340901-JWC-MAC-01"><sic>7:288</sic><corr>JWC to MAC, <date when="1834-09-01">1 Jan. 1834</date></corr></ref>, <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340921-TC-JAC-01"><sic>309</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1834-09-21">21 Sept. 1834</date></corr></ref> and <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350909-TC-MAC-01"><sic>8:203</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1835-09-09">9 Sept. 1835</date></corr></ref>.</note> a Cattle-dealer grown several stones heavier, faced like Silenus,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Bald, full-bearded, flat-nosed, flushed, like Silenus, oldest of the Satyrs and companion of Bacchus.</note> full of Dock-English and familiarity of which the thought was horrible to <pb id="pg-19-190" n="19:190"/>me! By him my &#x201C;honoured name&#x201D; was imparted to the Ships Company in general; and I had the strangest addresses; free and easy as in the Age of Gold:&#x2014;my difficulty not to break into sheer vocal execration was considerable. Then our sleeping-room&#x2014; But I will talk no more of it. The fact is I do not design to convey myself by that method again. I do not think a more brutal element of human Savagery could have been found in any part of British land or water. About half-past seven next morning I was right glad to see Jamie waiting for me at the jetty; we got to Scotsbrig before ten, and Jenny and my Mother had some tea for me (my first refection after Sea-forth);&#x2014;and I have glided about ever since, or lain on beds or chairs when I could get it done; very much in the humour of Jonah (as I fancy it) when he found himself vomited from the Whale&#x2019;s Belly; exceedingly confused and uncertain what his movements ought to be. I <hi rend="italic">have</hi> found Silence, however; that is one great point! Annan lay all dim and still as we passed thro&#x2019; it; nothing audible but some few paviers at work on the street; all the way to Scotsbrig we met simply one living creature, a weaver making towards Annan with a cart and garron, seemingly for coals. He gave Jamie a pale smile, and fared on. At Midday I walked with my Mother to the moor: it really was as if Pan slept; the sun and sky were bright as silver, the seas and hills lay round, and noise of all sorts had entirely hushed itself, as if the whole thing had been a Picture or a Dream,&#x2014;which in fact the Philosophers tell us it properly is. I slept indifferently well; but I feel still abundantly confused, and hardly know what I am writing.</p>
<p>My Mother looks feebler to me; I see her hand shakes considerably more: but otherwise she professes to be in fully usual health; is affectionately interested in all things as ever; has taken with ardour to the reading of Cromwell. Jenny is fatter, distinctly bigger and cheerfuller; a very active orderly nimble creature; has her two little girls all combed and trimmed; they can read their New Testament, the elder can even sew: a good useful distinct little figure.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Margaret (b. <date when="1838-00-00">1838</date>) and Mary (b. <date when="1840-00-00">1840</date>).</note> Isabella I have not yet seen: it is one of my tasks to go and transact my interview with her, for she cannot speak at all! Yet she superintends her household; has a lively eye upon all things, thro&#x2019; the organs of a Niece, who understands her <hi rend="italic">signs:</hi> she <hi rend="italic">can</hi> speak, in the faintest conceivable whisper, but only by rising up from her sofa, and with a great effort. She lodges in her old place down stairs; rides a little on the ass with Jamie leading it; but &#x201C;dare not venture above a hundred yards from the door&#x201D;: poor Isabella! Jamie looks more sad and worn than usual: but otherwise things are going well enough with him. He will have no shearing for a week yet. Wull Easton<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >As a boy apprenticed to TC&#x2019;s father; see Espinasse 262&#x2013;63.</note> (whom Jack will know) is building the stable; <pb id="pg-19-191" n="19:191"/>and all the doors are encumbered with heaps of mortar and stones. You can read what of this you like to Jack, and let him take it instead of news to himself.&#x2014; I am lodged in the <hi rend="italic">East</hi> room, where you used to be: my position now is sufficiently conceivable to Goody.</p>
<p>And now when shall I get your Letter? Alas, I believe not till Wednesday morning; a Waterbeck<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Village 4 mi. NE of Ecclefechan.</note> Post is the kind of arrangement we are now to go upon. I long to hear how you got away and home; what you have to say of Chelsea after the long absence;&#x2014;what you think of it in comparison with Crosby!&#x2014; Nothing can exceed my Mother&#x2019;s gratitude to you; your two Letters themselves had given wonderful delight,&#x2014;most of them, I think, are committed to memory, have committed themselves on reapeated<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> perusals. It is worth while to write now and then on such terms.</p>
<p>Dear Jeannie mine, I did not design to turn this leaf at all. Being unutterably stupid, as if half-asleep and with a head that aches, I will terminate for this day, <closer><salute>God bless thee, dear <foreign>Bairn</foreign>.</salute></closer></p>

<ps><p>Has there come no Letter from Adamson at Dumfries about &#xa3;150 he received? Nothing <hi rend="italic">can</hi> well have gone wrong in it; but I expected word. This morning or hitherto there was no Letter of any kind for me.</p></ps>

<salute>My dear Lady,</salute>
<p>Accept my salutations from the <hi rend="italic">Shore of the Departed,</hi> whither I am now at last come! Full of distractions, regrets, distresses and astonishments, as my way is when I get hither; but looking still (you see) across the great gulph; begging still to be remembered there. Indeed I think you seem beautifuller to me here from Hades then<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> you ever did before;&#x2014;beyond measure astonishing withal! The most that I have left looks miserable enough to me; a coil of beggarly confusions, contradictions and bewilderments, which one could very gladly bid <foreign>adieu</foreign> to, any day; wholly a dim sordid mass, right pleasant to be <hi rend="italic">divided</hi> from, if forevermore, all the better; but struggling in it too are streaks of Heaven&#x2019;s own brightness,&#x2014;such I understand them to be; things inexpressibly different from the general; Figures as of &#x201C;realized Ideals,&#x201D; or I know not what; Figures <pb id="pg-19-192" n="19:192"/>beautiful exceedingly,&#x2014;of which I had better say no more at present, till I recollect myself better!&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>I arrived here yesterday morning; out of such an element as I hope never to be in again. Vomited forth, namely, from a Liverpool Steamer, full of noise, vulgarity, foul air, Scotch graziers, Irish blackguards, and sin and misery;&#x2014;and feel literally (I dare say) like Jonah vomited from the Whale&#x2019;s Belly; very much topsyturvied indeed! It was a beautiful morning when I got to land: a bright sun, the first I had seen for some weeks, slowly raising off the universal veil of haze; pouring down in bright streams thro&#x2019; this or the other crevice upon the Hills here and there. It was the road <hi rend="italic">you</hi> should have come,&#x2014;a piece of it was. Burnswark<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hill; see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18360716-JWC-TC-01"><sic>9:13</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1836-07-16">16 July 1836</date></corr></ref>.</note> looked really beautiful; seemed to regret that you had not seen him.&#x2014; I found my good old Mother here; her old heart still young to see me:&#x2014;I should not be so sad if I were wise! I have a Silence too as of the gods; a thing I am always clamouring for. Boundless tracts of green uplands, with Towns and Seas, and Steamships and great Mountains, visible in the distance; and not a sound to disturb even the Enraged Musician; in fact a Silence that surprises me,&#x2014;for I think the very insects are getting old, and falling silent. One <hi rend="italic">is</hi> left to one&#x2019;s own reflexions here: here or nowhere one ought to recover some composure, and learn to distinguish right hand from left again.</p>
<p>My Wife is on her way home today. The Bivouac-Ch&#xe2;teau<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Seaforth House.</note> did very well for her: indeed it is a curious place, with many features of real loveability;&#x2014; a very musical creature the lady, and the man as merry as a French cricket; and Zoe with her scraggy yet not ungraceful ways, with a certain lean sincerity of laughter in her, lean sincerity in general:&#x2014;my best portion of it was a solitary sea-beach of many miles of which I had the run; nothing but a few rabbits in the neighbourhood; Liverpool with &#x201C;the smoke of its torment&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Rev. 14:11.</note> hanging all in the safe distance.&#x2014; &#x2014;In fine I am here; with a dull headache, and in such a confused mood as my Lady now sees. I got Miss Baring&#x2019;s Letter; all seemed well with you then.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Louisa Baring wrote from Alverstoke, ca. <date when="1845-08-31">31 Aug.</date>: &#x201C;The adventurous travellers were driven here by the inclemency of the dog days, &#x26; they have found as much sunshine &#x26; warmth as this ill fated island can afford. I fear the icebergs are making a rapid progress in our direction &#x26; that we shall all be frozen this winter.&#x201D;</note> But now&#x2014;?&#x2014; Surely if you would write to me it would be very kind! I have no right to bid you answer such a thing as this: but I wish I had a little mirror that w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> shew me the shadow of your life a little!</p>

<p>I was sure you would have a wretched voyage&#x2014;the very smell of that boat made me sick for all the rest of the evening&#x2014; We &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">did</hi> intend&#x201D; to have waved a handkerchief to you, in passing, from the roof of the house&#x2014;but the fog was too thick &#x201C;for anything&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;About the <date when="1845-08-00">end of August</date> I did come to Seaforth; wearisome journey; bulky dull man, Sir W. B.&#x2014;&#x2014;, as I found, and some Irish admirers talking dull antiquarian pedantries and platitudes all day; I as third party silent, till at length, near sunset, bursting out upon them and their Nennius, to their terror and astonishment and almost to my own. Beautiful reception by Mrs. Paulet and her waiting for me at the station. Alas! alas! how unspeakable now!&#x2014;T.C.&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s headnote in <hi rend="italic">LM</hi>). Sir W. B. unidentified. Nennius (fl. 796), Welsh historian, traditional author of <hi rend="italic">Historia Britonum</hi>.</note>&#x2014;</p>
<p>Great efforts were made to keep me longer&#x2014;but it is my principle always to go away before having exhausted the <hi rend="italic">desire</hi> to keep me; besides that I pique myself on being a woman of my word&#x2014;and so me <foreign>voila</foreign> [here I am]! in Cheyne Row once more!&#x2014;</p>
<p>The journey back was a considerable of a bore&#x2014;the train I came by starting at eleven, and supposed by M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Paulet to answer to that which leaves here at ten did not land me at Euston Station till half after nine!&#x2014;and all that while, except a glass of porter and a sandwich&#x2014;&#x201C;the chief characteristic of which was its <hi rend="italic">tenuity</hi>,&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Mill&#x2019;s account of some celebrated creature&#x2019;s &#x2018;literature&#x2019;&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note in <hi rend="italic">LM</hi>).</note> I had no support to nature&#x2014;for I saw no sense in <hi rend="italic">dining</hi> at Birmingham when I expected to be in London at six.</p>
<p>John<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;John Carlyle, then staying at Cheyne Row&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note in <hi rend="italic">LM</hi>).</note> had sent a note the day before, proposing, as he proposed the senna for Mary&#x2019;s children, that I should appoint him to meet me &#x201C;or perhaps I had better not.&#x201D; Not having got the letter before setting out for Crosby I had of course no option&#x2014;&#x201C;which was probably just as well&#x201D;&#x2014; Arriving here a quarter after ten&#x2014;I found poor little Helen half distracted at my lateness&#x2014;&#x201C;if it had been the <hi rend="italic">Master</hi> she would never have minded but <hi rend="italic">me</hi> that was always to a <hi rend="italic">moment!</hi>&#x201D;&#x2014;and so she had been <hi rend="italic">taking on</hi> at a great rate and finally just a few minutes before I arrived got John dispatched <hi rend="italic">to look for me</hi> (!) at the Station&#x2014;in case as he fancied I had prefered coming by the Express train&#x2014;and thro these good intentions, highly unfortunate,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Phrase of John&#x2019;s&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note in <hi rend="italic">LM</hi>).</note> I was kept up till half after one&#x2014;John not coming back till half after twelve&#x2014;and I too polite to go to bed without awaiting his coming&#x2014; Moreover the carriage I came in had <hi rend="italic">pitched</hi> like a ship in a storm, so that I was shaken into an absolute fever&#x2014;&#x201C;the flames of fever had <pb id="pg-19-194" n="19:194"/>seized on me&#x201D;&#x2014;and what with all this fatigue and the excitement of feeling myself at home I could not sleep &#x201C;the least in the world&#x201D; and have not recovered myself to this hour&#x2014; All is quiet about me as quiet can be, even to John&#x2019;s boots&#x2014;but what signifies that if one have like Ann Cook&#x2019;s Soldier &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Palpitation</hi>&#x201D;!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ann Cook, the Carlyles&#x2019; maid, <date when="1835-00-00">1835</date>&#x2013;<date when="1838-00-00">38</date>; her soldier is unidentified.</note> I have found every thing here as well or better than could have been expected&#x2014;the leech alive and &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">so</hi> happy&#x201D;!&#x2014;Helen radiant with virtues own reward!&#x2014;the economical department in a very backward state, but <hi rend="italic">not confused;</hi> for it is clear as day that not a single bill has been paid since I left. Helen seems to have had four pound ten for the incidental expences&#x2014;which I shall enclose her account of, to amuse Jamie&#x2014;and there is a <hi rend="italic">national debt</hi> to the Butcher Baker and milkman amounting to about five pounds&#x2014;so that the house keeping during my absence has been carried on at some six or seven shillings a week <hi rend="italic">less</hi> than if I had been at home which is all as it should be&#x2014;for I defy three people to live <hi rend="italic">as we do</hi> on less than thirty shillings a-week.

<p>Nobody knows yet that I am here except Helps and Elizabeth Pepoli who had called and been told by Helen last week&#x2014;accordingly I was surprised by a visit from Helps yesterday forenoon&#x2014;and in the afternoon I walked myself with John to see Elizabeth&#x2014; He (John) went on to M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Frasers to tea&#x2014; What a pity he cannot get married to M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Fraser&#x2014;she seems the only woman he cares about&#x2014;</p>

(as the children say). Besides the prospective pleasure of reading it; it is no small immediate pleasure to me as a token of your remembrance; for when one has &#x201C;sworn an everlasting friendship&#x201D; at first sight, one desires, very naturally, that it should not have been on your Irish principle, &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">with the reciprocity all on one side&#x201D;</hi>!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech.

<p>The book only reached me&#x2014;or rather I only reached it&#x2014;last night&#x2014;on my return home after an absence of two months, in search of&#x2014;what shall I say?&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">a religion?</hi> Sure enough if I were a good Catholic, or good Protestant, or good Anything; I should not be visited with those nervous illnesses which send me from time to time out into space to get myself rehabilitated&#x2014;after a sort&#x2014;by &#x201C;change of air&#x201D;!

<p><salute>My Goody</salute> what in the world is the meaning of this? I am lost in surprise and conjecture: first one Letter with stamps and fusees in it, and not one word, good, bad or indifferent; then this morning no Letters at all&#x2014; &#x2014; Whew! just as I was writing this last line (literally so), enters Jamie with a Letter! I had already had a messenger at the Post Office, and got merely two Newspapers,&#x2014;that was early in the morning. It is now near one o&#x2019;clock, of a very wet day. Ecclefechan Postie had been half asleep, probably drink in his head too: I suppose the <hi rend="italic">third</hi> Newspaper (the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>) will come also, by and by. But the truth is, we have been unlucky hitherto in our Post arrangements. I myself went out to give the Waterbeck Post (once already spoken of) his precise instructions; a most punctual man, they told me: this was the day after my arrival. After walking two miles in earnest survey, I did meet something with a Postbag; but he was no <hi rend="italic">man</hi>, a mere boy, &#x201C;My father at his hairst [harvest]!&#x201D; I gave this Boy your Letter (which it seems he has faithfully taken); gave him also in the most distinct terms, twice over, his instructions;&#x2014;and&#x2014;and the result was, no Letters of any kind came. It turns out the Boy was deaf, and had never heard me! I got a whole mass of Printers things, and a Letter from John,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1845-09-12">12 Sept.</date></note> by an Express <pb id="pg-19-199" n="19:199"/>messenger yesterday.&#x2014; Getting Newspapers and no Letter today, you may guess what scope my poor fancy was going to have had! Thank Heaven here it is all right now. The Boy <hi rend="italic">has</hi> brought this brave Letter of Goody&#x2019;s, and a benevolent child has come over with it in the rain: I have little doubt we shall go on quite smoothly henceforth. Such are the difficulties of human correspondence. My ink too is on the point of being done; and Jamie&#x2019;s Desk has given way to the infirmities of age, and diseases produced by damp, to a really shocking extent! Let that and general confusion of mind be my excuse.</p>
<p>I have passed my time since I arrived here in the utmost possible seclusion; have been nowhere except about the moors and highways here; have spoken to <supplied>[no]</supplied><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> man, and done no thing, that I could any way avoid. No right sleep has yet fallen to my lot: but we have had some fine days, and I have sat in the silent sunshine with my back to a crag; I have also gone strictly on the starving system, and do feel very considerably better. It is borne in upon my mind that if I were in a quiet place for a length of time, I should certainly get better in health,&#x2014;perhaps almost well. Alas, Crosby is like other places! But we must think of it seriously; some good may lie there; and if one&#x2019;s own mind were once completely made up, a place there or elsewhere might be found!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Grahame<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Graham (<date when="1770-00-00">1770</date>&#x2013;ca. <date when="1857-00-00">1857</date>), of Burnswark, 3 mi. N of Ecclefechan.</note> sent a message that he would abide all day at Burnswark waiting for me; but the happy rain has proved my deliverance: nobody knows the distress I have in all that; my desire to avoid it is naturally great.</p>
<p>Jamie Aitken came here yesterday; all well at Dumfries, Mary decidedly better at the Gill: I shall have to resolve on going round that way, one of these days. Yesterday Jamie bought (the Jamie of Scotsbrig) bought a pony that will run very well in the gig; the old horse was lame, habitually spavined, and I declined him except as a matter of necessity. I took my Mother out last night, a long drive, by Springkell<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >An estate 4 mi. W of Ecclefechan where TC&#x2019;s father worked once as a stone mason; see J. M.

<p>Poor Isabella managed her interview with me very well; brought me in mind of your ways in such things. She sprang up from her sofa; took my <pb id="pg-19-200" n="19:200"/>hand in both of hers, with a blithe look as if all had been well. The colloquy was managed by speech on my side with intelligent and intelligible signs on hers. My Mother was there, and received most of my talk. Isabella, when not answering or spoken to, lay with her eyes cast down, looking pale and extremely sad. She is not much thinner than heretofore; does not look otherwise much more unwell. Jamie wrestles along in a rugged, decisive, really manful way.</p>
<p>O Goody, Goody, what clatter is all this! I write here like a man writing on the <hi rend="italic">slack rope</hi>. My thoughts are not yet come to me in this bewildering environment; a place always good to me, yet sorrowful as Death!&#x2014;</p>
<p>When Jack grows too troublesome to you, advise him off hither. There is room here, a vacant bed, whenever he likes to come: his presence here will make my departure easier to them; and at any rate I do not mean to stay long. I should almost regret if I did again get acquainted with the ways of things here, and have to part from them again with such regret. No mortal was ever fonder of Permanency than I, more averse to Change in any form than I; and it seems as if much of <hi rend="italic">it</hi> had lain and might still lie in my path thro&#x2019; this world. Courage!</p>
<p>One of my good shoes gave way on Sunday! The road was all of mud, the weather wet; but I insisted on two long walks. The consequence was&#x2014;the destruction of my cockney shoe. But I had a nice walk too, the second time, when the rain had ceased. There was a melancholy Moon wading confusedly; poor lone huts had their tallow-light kindled among the hollows of the hills, and except the tinkling of little <hi rend="italic">burns</hi> there was no sound in the whole world. I walked to Waterbeck, looked down over the bridge, and came back, with many reflexions. Two hoydens of girls, who had heard my footsteps as I came, were out to see who or what it was as I returned up the hamlet,&#x2014;a sight worth taking note of, my pretty ones!</p>
<p>Helen&#x2019;s hieroglyph I will study, and shew Jamie, this evening. I dine upon the quarter of a cock again: it will be a cock and a half since I arrived, that is currently the sum of my butcher&#x2019;s meat.&#x2014; &#x2014; Had I not <hi rend="italic">two</hi> dirty shirts already at Seaforth?

<p>I have got quite over the fatigues of my journey which had been most provokingly aggravated for me by a circumstance &#x201C;which it may be interesting <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to state&#x201D;; the last two nights I have slept quite as well as I was doing at Seaforth. The <hi rend="italic">retirement</hi> of Cheyne Row is as deep at present as any one not absolutely a <hi rend="italic">Timona</hi> of Athens<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The female equivalent of Shakespeare&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Timon of Athens</hi>.</note> could desire: &#x201C;There is &#x201C;in the first place (as M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Paulet would say) the physical impossibility, (hardly anybody being left in Town); and then,&#x201D; the weather has been so tempestuous <pb id="pg-19-202" n="19:202"/>that nobody in their senses (except Mazzini who never reflects whether it be raining or no) would come out to make visits. He (Mazzini) came the day before yesterday, immediately on receiving notification of my advent&#x2014;and his doe-skin boots were oozing out water in a manner frightful to behold. He looked much as I left him, and appeared to have made no <foreign><hi rend="italic">progr&#xE8;s</hi></foreign> [progress], of a practical sort&#x2014; He told me nothing worth recording except that he had received the other day a&#x2014;declaration of love! and this he told with the same <foreign><hi rend="italic">calma</hi></foreign> and historical precision, with which <hi rend="italic">you</hi> might have said you had received an invitation to take the chair at a Mechanics-Institute-dinner! Of course I asked &#x201C;the particulars&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;why not?&#x201D; and I got them fully, at the same time with brevity, and without a smile! Since the assassination affair<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Trial (at Paris) of some calumnious fellow, who had accused him of being privy to, &#x26;c. &#x26;c.&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note in <hi rend="italic">LM</hi>).</note> he had received many invitations to the house of a Jew-Merchant of Italian extraction, where there are several daughters &#x201C;what shall I say?&#x2014;horribly ugly&#x2014;that is; <hi rend="italic">repugnant</hi> for me&#x2014;entirely&#x201D;!<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably the invitations began in <date when="1845-04-00">April</date> when Sir James Graham repeated the accusation of Mazzini as an assassin; see <ref target="volume-19/lt-18450405-JWC-JW-01">JWC to JW, [<date when="1845-04-05">5 April</date>]</ref>.

But said she when we have drank we will then tell each other to <hi rend="italic">whom?</hi> Excuse me said he we will if you please drink without conditions.

<p><salute>Thanks, Dearest,</salute> for your Letter of today. All your Letters entertain me, on what subject, from what place soever, there is an entertaining quality in Goody. Moreover, if not Punctuality&#x2019;s Self, she is as near Punctuality as one can reasonably come for practical purposes! Poor little Goody!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I am still in a rather low way here; not habituated to my new scene; much infested with uncertain weather; denied the privilege of an effectual sleep. Yesterday, as you would incidentally hear, Jamie and I went off for Gillenbie. There had been two muddy days before that, in which I had got no suitable exercise; and I was not prepared for the <hi rend="italic">cold</hi> of the new dry weather. We found Stewart; found certain horrible Annandale female Persons of Quality; traces of &#x201C;Gunner Bodies&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Parties shooting grouse.</note> &#x26;c; and had not an entirely successful day! Stewart is a fine hardy little fellow; and I liked well enough to talk and walk with him over the fields: but it was very sad otherwise! We got off <hi rend="italic">before</hi> dinner and the Gunner Bodies; drove along thro&#x2019; the chill clear Twilight; silent grassy hills, and rustic homesteads;&#x2014;were very glad of a cup of hot tea, and some substantial kind of victual, when we arrived here. I had got a kind of despicable rheumatism in my neck and shoulders, which still sticks there, somewhat to my annoyance: but I have decided on <hi rend="italic">vigorous measures</hi> (best kept secret) for tomorrow! On the whole I grow clearer; but the element in many respects is still very sad and alien to me. My Mother is much weaker: it would affect you to see how her hand shakes, and with what good humour she takes it;&#x2014;how all is grown old and weak with her, except her affection which seems younger than ever! One thinks of <hi rend="italic">Immortality</hi> at sight of such things&#x2014;O God!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Our weather is like yours; off and on; but we are far stronger in mud than you! One requires wooden shoes, which I have not, impervious clothing, <pb id="pg-19-204" n="19:204"/>and a resolution to be indifferent to mud.&#x2014; &#x2014; However, I have seen Grahame,&#x2014;poor old Grahame; seen Stewart: that is two things done. On Monday I go off for Dumfries; have written to Adamson that I will settle accounts with him on Tuesday: there a third thing will be done. I have also corrected a bit of the <hi rend="italic">Index</hi> which came today. By degrees we shall get thro&#x2019; our things!&#x2014; Tonight I meant to have walked with this and other Letters to Ecclefechan: but after tea, it set steadily in to rain. I sit here with solitary fire and candle in the East room.</p>
<p>What will become of Mazzini&#x2019;s Jewess? Will she hang herself at Aberdeen, or how? <foreign><hi rend="italic">Que le monde est rempli d&#x2019;imbecilles</hi></foreign> [How full the world is of imbeciles]!&#x2014; &#x2014; Take care of thyself poor Goody; yea; and love me in spite of all!&#x2014; Here is my Mother come in with a sheet of <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> (most intent upon it, &#x201C;a great and good man&#x201D;!) and charges me to send her &#x201C;kind thanks and all loving regards.&#x201D; <closer><salute>Good night, Dearest: a kind Good-night out of the depths of Annandale darkness</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Spedding,</salute>
<p>I am here since Friday gone a week; but in no travelling condition; in fact altogether out of spirits, and out of order every way; and do not think of going farther into Scotland at present, or indeed of going anywhither, except unwillingly into Nithsdale where I have some business to do,&#x2014;and then home again to Chelsea to hide myself in a corner there. This country is infinitely mournful to me; but I feel least annoyed when left entirely alone, to saunter about the moors here, and converse with the ghosts of the Past after my own fashion. I am very sorry to see little or no prospect of meeting with you even in Cumberland on this occasion; one of the few men whom it is really solacing to me to meet with! But we cannot help it.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Though there was to be no autumn visit, TC sent Spedding the usual presentation copy, inscribed &#x201C;To Thomas Spedding Esq / with many kind regards / T.

<p>The Book on Cromwell is done; and is worth next to nothing when done. One poor man avails not against the stupidity of a Nation for two hundred years. There will be no recognition of Cromwell till another generation than this arise. I sometimes think I may have turned a little running brook in upon the obscene dung-mountains, whereby they may at last be swum away, and the face of Oliver and his earnest time laid bare from them: but <pb id="pg-19-205" n="19:205"/>this also I do not know for certain; neither indeed need one specially care. I have got done with a most disgusting piece of labour; which, in so far as it was pious and honest, will not be useless to myself at any rate. And so, let us rest a little in the mute wilderness here, and then to the road again.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>

<p>We have fine weather at last that is to say it was fine yesterday and looks as tho it &#x201C;had made up its mind&#x201D; to keep dry to day.

<p><salute>Dear Goody,&#x2014;</salute>I came up hither yesterday with my Mother; am very poorly this morning (with transient biliary businesses); have almost no time, being already due to Adamson;&#x2014;but will nevertheless send you a fraction of a word concerning my whereabout and proceedings.&#x2014;</p>
<p>Before starting yesterday morning I caught the Post with your Letter; Jamie and I, at the corner of the Scotsbrig <hi rend="italic">Loaning</hi>,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The long farm lane from the Waterbeck road.</note> in the middle of blustering autumn wind with spittings of rain. I hurried home to read it before setting off. Thanks to my little Goody for her punctual constancy in writing; I have no other hold at present of the current of things. Letters always kind and lively, sure to be agreeable! We will not go into Robertson&#x2019;s eulogy of them; but we will accept them with thankfulness!&#x2014; Tomorrow on my return I expect all manner of good tidings about the Fuz-Dickens dramaturgy: it was well judged to take a <hi rend="italic"><foreign>Zweite Fliege</foreign>;</hi> to be independent of the world, and prepared to witness the adventure under rational circumstances.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC went with John Carlyle to <hi rend="italic">Every Man in his Humour</hi> and booked a hired vehicle, a &#x201C;fly,&#x201D; thereby giving TC the chance of a pun and correcting her error in <ref target="volume-19/lt-18450915-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1845-09-15">15 Sept.</date>]</ref>.</note> I long to hear the history of it.</p>
<p>As to the German Books, the degree of <foreign><hi rend="italic">Anmuth</hi></foreign> [charm] they have will need to suffice them, and may hope to amount to a fulfilment of orders on the subject. If you will make them all up into a Parcel, and send them <foreign><hi rend="italic">franco</hi></foreign> [post paid], with due address, to 12 G<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Stanhope Street, I will write that they are there, and then the job will be done. Or if you cannot make a tight Parcels-Comp<hi rend="italic">y</hi> parcel, give them to John, and he will do it. I suppose the Lady must be gone to The Grange now; but know not how that may be: at any rate Stanhope Street is the address for the Books.&#x2014; &#x2014; I have a good Book of Preuss&#x2019;s on Friederic the Great, at Scotsbrig, which I am reading with satisfaction when I can be left alone to do it, which is rather seldom. I believe I must <hi rend="italic">send</hi> for John to come up hitherward out of your way; he will then perhaps &#x201C;see clearly&#x201D;;&#x2014;I do not design to be long here at any rate.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-19-208" n="19:208"/>Yesterday the showers brightened up into &#x201C;sunny-showers,&#x201D; and then the sky all grew bright as silver,&#x2014;still with clouds on it at intervals; and I drove my Mother along thro&#x2019; the still Country with the wind on our backs, handsomely enough. Sun was setting over the steeple-tops, Galloway hills, and windmill &#x201C;Observatory&#x201D; of this old Town as we approached it: one of the beautifullest bright-stern melancholy scenes for me I ever saw.

By <date when="1845-09-19">19 Sept.</date> Sir Robert Peel had forebodings about the potato crop in Ireland. The blight spread rapidly over England, Ireland, Scotland, and the Continent, and by <date when="1845-10-00">mid-Oct.</date> it was becoming apparent that in Ireland the crop failure was disastrous.</note> I have to go back thither before quitting for good.&#x2014; Jean has got all her house sumptuously furnished here; a really beautiful little Town-cottage,&#x2014;terribly infested with noisy young children.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Besides James, Ann, and the baby Margaret, Jean had Thomas (b. <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>) and John (b. <date when="1843-00-00">1843</date>).</note> James the Husband proves a most active clever fellow in his business, and seems to be very victorious at present in his painting department.&#x2014; I have moreover a decided prospect of trowser-stuff from the shops today!</p>

The country is getting very full of railway people; waggons of their luggage and apparatus are seen lodged in the villages: all kinds of labour are rapidly rising in price; Stewart and Jamie agreed that <hi rend="italic">draining</hi> would have to be given up here for two years.</p>
<p>Everybody inquires zealously for you, sends punctual compliments and such like; but you can suppose it all without much specification. They are really all very affectionate towards you, and towards me also, which I feel sometimes as a reproach and rebuke to me, as well as a possession.</p>

In other words, the woman who wishes to challenge men and compete with them must do so without surrendering to them in love or marriage. This is, says the author, of course against the &#x201C;laws of nature,&#x201D; whatever exceptions may have been known, such as Joan of Arc. Modern Joans, who use the pen rather than the sword to free members of their sex from outdated laws, must also have &#x201C;<foreign>le courage de rester vierges</foreign>&#x201D; (41), as JWC quotes, and must therefore accept being martyrs for journalism. Henri Paris has the cause of her fellow women at heart, but her two pamphlets of <date when="1831-00-00">1831</date> and <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date> passionately argue against careers for women unless they are single.

Then having found it, he brought it to me in the Library where I was mounted on <hi rend="italic">the steps</hi>&#x2014;covered with dust&#x2014;to ask whether I thought &#x201C;the diamonds real&#x201D;&#x2014;and what I thought &#x201C;such a thing would cost.&#x201D; It was the Pin he got years ago in Italy&#x2014; I told him I could not take upon me to value it, but I could learn its value for him&#x2014;&#x201C;from whom&#x201D;? &#x201C;from Collier the Jeweller&#x201D;&#x2014; &#x201C;Where does he live&#x201D;? (with immense eagerness) &#x201C;at the top of Sloane Street&#x2014;&#x201D; &#x201C;But wouldn&#x2019;t he tell <hi rend="italic">me</hi>&#x2014;if I asked him? <hi rend="italic">me! myself</hi>&#x201D;? &#x201C;I dare say he would,&#x201D; said I soothingly, for he seemed to be going rapidly out of his wits with all-absorbing desire to know the value of that pin!&#x2014; If I had not seen him the night before playing with his purse and some sovereigns I might have thought he was on the point of carrying it to a pawn-shop to get himself a morsel of victual! But when giving up the diamonds as glass he passed to the individual value of the <hi rend="italic">turquoise</hi> in the middle; flesh and blood could stand it no longer; and I returned to my dusting in <hi rend="italic">silence</hi>. Whereupon he looked at his watch and found he &#x201C;was obliged to go off to the British Museum.&#x201D; What in all the world will become of him? he seems to be more than ever without &#x201C;fixed point&#x201D;&#x2014;without <hi rend="italic">will</hi>, without so much as <hi rend="italic">a good wish!</hi> unless it be to enjoy a tolerable share of <hi rend="italic">material</hi> comfort without &#x2018;<foreign><hi rend="italic">amt</hi></foreign> [position]&#x2019; and as much as possible without &#x2018;<foreign><hi rend="italic">geld</hi></foreign> [money]&#x2019; However now that he has &#x201C;concluded with his Landlady&#x201D; it is no business of mine how he flounders on &#x201C;abating no jot of heart and hope&#x201D;<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Milton, sonnet &#x201C;To Cyriack Skinner, Upon his Blindness.&#x201D;</note> my own life is rather of the floundering sort; only I have the grace to <hi rend="italic">have</hi> &#x201C;abated heart and hope&#x201D; in it&#x2014;to <hi rend="italic">such</hi> an extent, as to think sometimes that &#x201C;if I were dead, and a stone at my head, perhaps it would be be-ter.&#x201D;!<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Forlorn old pauper, entering a schoolroom (to dame and little children): &#x2018;I&#x2019;m a poor helpless cratur; / If I was dead, and a stone at my head, / I think it would be bey-tur!&#x2019;&#x201D;(TC&#x2019;s note in <hi rend="italic">LM</hi>).</note></p>

<salute>Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>You were too late with your Newspaper and Letter on Monday; they did not arrive till this morning, along with Jane&#x2019;s Letter. I have added the modicum of oil of cloves, and bottled up the substance in an air-tight phial, after endeavouring to mix and manipulate it as I best could.</p>
<p>We got home last night from Dumfries; all business satisfactorily enough accomplished there; the journey performed without rain, which feat in these climates is sometimes a difficult one. Jean seemed very well, her husband and household prosperous; a terrible tumult of children round her, as usual. The Dumfries people were all agog about some Cattle-show that is soon to be,&#x2014;building pavilions, cattle-pens, palings &#x26;c.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For the Royal Highland &#x26; Agricultural Soc. Show to be held nr. Dumfries, <date when="1845-10-07">7 Oct.</date> (<hi rend="italic">Courier</hi>, <date when="1845-10-13">13 Oct.</date>).</note> Aird was unusually heavy and wooden. I hardly spoke to any other except on business.</p>
<p>They are all much disappointed here this morning to understand from Jane&#x2019;s Letter that you are about going into your old lodging straightway; that there is no likelihood of seeing you here. Is that resolution irrevocable? I had calculated on seeing you here before I left: there is room enough for you; and we should not be in one another&#x2019;s way for a few days. My Mother, in thanking you for the Medicines, bids me say how well she would have liked, or would still like, to have your company awhile. Perhaps you may still think of it?</p>
<p>Today is Lockerby<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Market town 6 mi. NW of Ecclefechan.</note> Market: Jamie set off in a deluge of rain in the morning; and now since noon it is a brisk Sunny afternoon. My Mother sits by me waiting to set out on a walk up the Hill. Wull Easton will take this to <pb id="pg-19-217" n="19:217"/>the Post. Perhaps you will revoke your resolution not to come to Annandale.</p>

<p><salute>Dearest,&#x2014;</salute>I still continue in bad case for writing, my apparatus and self much out of order here in that particular; I would write no Letters if it were not to get answers from you. Today I did mean to write at some length with a view that way: but, behold, all my Christie Index, my Titlepage &#x26;c, in a very abstruse state, has arrived; and I really must, much as it is against my will, buckle to the rectifying of it. A few words in great discomposure are all that I can give you today.&#x2014; &#x2014; My mood of mind here, my way of life here, is utterly confused; essentially <hi rend="italic">taciturn</hi> it ought to be; would much sooner be spoken to than speak! Very sad withal, but not useless to me. It is good to hold a day of Humiliation and Reflexion sometimes; and that is what I do in this old Annandale Chaos,&#x2014;extremely chaotic to me indeed! My poor old Mother is much weakened; nothing of her that is not old but her affections, her interest in all that is divine and noble according to her own version of that. Alas, old Annandale is all grown strange to me; a mournful Hall of the Past. Nevertheless <hi rend="italic">it</hi> too asserts itself, it too is there; thou shalt take note of it too!&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">My</hi> thoughts within my own cell, contrasted with the current thoughts of the world, look very strange indeed. Poor John&#x2019;s removal to his Furnished Lodgings will be a considerable improvement in your situation; I could have wished him here for a day or two, to break the harshness of my departure: but it is better for himself, perhaps for all parties, that he is fixed again tho&#x2019; but to that small extent. A man flying about &#x201C;to see his way&#x201D; in that fashion, with a head of that colour, is sufficiently mournful.&#x2014; And now the moths and thou for it! Say nothing in complaint of &#x201C;thy work such as it is&#x201D;: all work; if it be nobly done, is about alike;&#x2014;really so: one has not reward out of it, except even that same: the <hi rend="italic">spirit</hi> it was done in. That is blessed, or that is accursed; that always. I wish we could learn to be wise&#x2014;ah, me!&#x2014;</p>
<p>My business was all got pretty tolerably done in Dumfries. M&#x2019;Queen, at present an enormous Cattle-dealer, is now tenant of Craigenputtoch, himself not resident there: M&#x2019;Adam was not put away; he mulishly refused to give any reasonable rent (resisted his Wife&#x2019;s urgencies, Adamson&#x2019;s and Stewart&#x2019;s and hers combined), acted <hi rend="italic">like</hi> a mule in fact: and so M&#x2019;Queen <pb id="pg-19-218" n="19:218"/>had to come in. Corson<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Who had been using the farm; see <ref target="volume-17/lt-18430826-TC-JWC-01"><sic>17:83</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1843-08-26">26 Aug. 1843</date></corr></ref>.</note> too being off, he has the whole thing;&#x2014;abatement &#xa3;20; which Stewart, on survey of the thing (Adamson and he were both on the ground), considered would be enough. Stewart advises to try for sale again; which I am very willing to do. The place he says is growing and will grow yearly rather worse. Enough of it.</p>
    <p>I saw no other person in Dumfries but Aird, or hardly any. Small pleasure in fools gaping round you; and of friends or even acquaintances. I cannot be said to have any stock now left there! To save appearances, having one night an odd Twenty minutes, I went down to M&#x2019;Diarmid&#x2019;s.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John M&#x2019;Diarmid (<date when="1790-00-00">1790</date>&#x2013;<date when="1852-00-00">1852</date>; <ref target="volume-19/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/17418"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), ed. of the <hi rend="italic">Dumfries Courier</hi>; see <ref target="volume-01/lt-18210110-TC-AC-01"><sic>1:307</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1821-01-10">10 Jan. 1821</date></corr></ref>.</note> The poor Editor sat there, in his old flimsy condition: he and I could have done very well; but he insisted on my going up stairs,&#x2014;Dinner-guests there and Mrs M&#x2019;D. Good Heavens, she was&#x2014;what shall I say, or Mazzini say?&#x2014;drunk as Chloe!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Either a joke or a mistake for &#x201C;Chloris&#x201D;; see Horace, <hi rend="italic">Odes</hi> 3.15.

Ought not this to be one&#x2019;s finale there? I was very glad to get out into the street again. What boundless articulate and inarticulate compliments were sent &#x201C;to Mrs Carlyle&#x201D; I shall not report to that Lady. <foreign>Ach Gott!</foreign>&#x2014; &#x2014; We got home to Annandale next day; and I have remained entirely silent ever since. The Tailor is coming on Monday; I have got immense stocks of clothes, trowsers, waistcoats, flannel-shirts, drawers: I wish they may get Goody&#x2019;s approval, but rather doubt it for some of them.</p>
<p>Thanks for the Narrative of the Fuz-Dickens dramaturgy; of Alfred Tennyson, Creek and all the rest. Mrs Paulet&#x2019;s Letter is very affectionate to you, very hearty and honest; but nothing like so entertaining as yours. She is terribly astray too when she speaks of &#x201C;the greatest man in Europe&#x201D;:<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC had told TC, [<ref target="volume-19/lt-18450923-JWC-TC-01"><date when="1845-09-23">23 Sept.</date></ref>], that Elizabeth Paulet&#x2019;s letter was quite as entertaining as hers. Exceptionally that letter [<date when="1845-09-19">19 Sept.</date>] survives, telling a good deal about their lively relationship. Speaking of housecleaning and decoration, she says that &#x201C;Paulet likes dirt better than &#x2018;earthquakes.&#x2019;&#x201D; As for herself (echoing the Carlyles&#x2019; catchphrases), &#x201C;I wish I could decently mount a ladder &#x26; wash too! just to keep me from thinking about &#x2018;hap hap happiness.&#x2019;&#x201D; Then turning to Liverpool friends, she says that Mrs. Charles Rawlins is nursing Mrs. Higginson&#x2019;s baby &#x201C;along with her own fat boy of 8 months (&#x2018;Harriet Martineau&#x2019; it is called),&#x201D; which &#x201C;grows &#x2018;bigger every day&#x2019; drinks even more than the fat boy himself! till M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> R cries out &#x2018;some meat some meat or I shall faint&#x2019; and Mr R says &#x2018;my dear you shall have a roast ox bless you.&#x201D; The Martineaus are &#x201C;enchanted&#x201D; with the lady: &#x201C;Ah my dear I fear your wit &#x26; charms are forgotten or rather <hi rend="italic">overshadowed</hi> by this <hi rend="italic">large</hi> Madonna &#x26; her two babies&#x2014; How pretty lines w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be on the &#x2018;little Harriet Martineau&#x2019; &#x26; &#x2018;Washington Rawlins&#x2019; her foster brother eh? <hi rend="italic">what to do</hi>&#x201D;. She ends with an invitation to TC: &#x201C;M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle can only return <hi rend="italic">this way</hi>, &#x26; must rest after the sail &#x26; the Welshes are not here. &#x2026; The carriage shall meet the boat &#x2026; &#x26; if <hi rend="italic">like the &#x2018;great man of Liverpool&#x2019;</hi> the great man of Europe shall not deign to write down the name of the ship &#x2026; why then dear Democratic Jane you must tell me all about the boat. &#x2026; Ever your affectionate &#x2018;Poor dear.&#x2019;&#x201D;</note>&#x2014; <pb id="pg-19-219" n="19:219"/>Good Heavens, he feels himself in general the Smallest man in Annandale almost! Being very bilious, confused and sleepless. Let him never trouble his head about what magnitude he is of.&#x2014; &#x2014; O Goody, Goody,&#x2014;let these words stand in place of a volume to thee; for they mean all manner of things.&#x2014; Here is the dinner (of cock-broth). <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, Dearest.</salute></closer></p>

<p>Yesternight that other Letter was written, and had lain some time in the pocket of the Messenger, when I reflected that it was Friday; that the Letter would fall on your Postless Sunday,&#x2014;that it might as well wait here another day for additions. This is the &#x201C;other&#x201D; day; one of the wettest; during the whole of which I have sat busy with my <hi rend="italic">Index;</hi> a job not yet finished. Battering rains, howling moaning winds, and no fire permitted in this room: such is all my history,&#x2014;of no use to trouble Goody with. I am not far from thro&#x2019; the Index; it shall be done, and then the whole business is done. I have had no walking yet: the rain has broken itself into showers some hours ago, into a scudding strong harvest-wind: if tea were over, I will out. I have dined;&#x2014;might as well not, for any joy it gives me! In fact, I ought to go and walk, and hold my peace: that is the English of it.</p>
<p>Will you yourself send the Newspaper on Monday; before 4 o&#x2019;clock into the Chelsea Post-Office: it has never yet come at the regular time. The <hi rend="italic">Nation</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Gavan Duffy&#x2019;s paper.</note> did not come till yesterday, three days after date. I supposed John might have something to do with it.&#x2014; A small Letter from Goody along with them will be very welcome! I partly hope for one tomorrow even, tho&#x2019; it is more than I deserve.</p>
<p>A wet day is very serious here; means imprisonment under difficult circumstances! Nothing of regularity is to be seen about our premises, or very little, except it be Jenny&#x2019;s two little children. These she combs, washes, dresses; sets to read, to sew even; and keeps wonderfully trim, and remote out of one&#x2019;s way. Poor little Jenny!&#x2014; Heart-kindness, too, that is to be seen and felt on all hands; that makes, and ought to make, amends for everything.&#x2014; At all vacant times I have my Preuss&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Friedrich der Grosse;</hi> very tolerable reading, and worth reflecting on. &#x201C;Better than I deserve!&#x201D; as Coleridge had it: what <hi rend="italic">do</hi> I deserve?

<salute>Dear Mrs Rich,</salute>
<p>That Note has followed me hither. Will you be so kind as communicate it to Mademoiselle Daulion;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A French friend of Mary Rich&#x2019;s; see <ref target="volume-18/lt-18441124-TC-KE-01"><sic>18:274</sic><corr>TC to KE, <date when="1844-11-24">24 Nov. 1844</date></corr></ref>.</note> and request her to send some message to this Bookseller of the Rue de la Paix<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Apparently Ferdinand Fleurus Amyot (<date when="1818-00-00">1818</date>&#x2013;<date when="1875-00-00">75</date>), bookseller of the Rue de la Paix, Paris, who was to publish Philar&#xE8;te Chasles&#x2019;s version of <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> in <date when="1847-00-00">1847</date>; see <ref target="volume-20/lt-18451021-TC-MRI-01">TC to <sic>MR</sic><corr>MRI</corr>, <date when="1845-10-21">21 Oct.</date></ref></note>. If she be actually persisting to translate the <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi>, she can try to make some bargain for herself with this Bookseller, or tell him that she has already made one. If she have dropt the Enterprise, ask her to tell him so. This is the arrangement I have made for <pb id="pg-19-225" n="19:225"/>her.&#x2014; If she say nothing, the man will consider the field as still open:&#x2014; but of course she will say.</p>
<p>The Book is now done; not quite so monstrous a Book as I once feared;&#x2014;and certainly the ugliest job of labour in the Book kind that ever fell to my lot.

<p>I am here for a week or two with my Mother. The weather very muddy; the people all lamenting the <hi rend="italic">Potatoe-Epidemic</hi>,&#x2014;and other grievances they labour under. Potatoes, it is prophesied by some, are about ceasing to grow at all in these climates, the virtue of them worn out by length of years. That will make a precious kettle of fish; that of itself!

I find them lying at the Weaver&#x2019;s Cottage at Backburn<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#xBD; mi. E of Scotsbrig.</note> in the morning at ten, or the boys bring them over to me thro&#x2019; the mud; and a treasure they are to begin the day upon. I found one yesterday; another they brought me today: in fact I do not deserve it, for there will be none at Chelsea for thee today,&#x2014;none till tomorrow morning, owing to a mistake! Continue to write, and I will do as much for you another time.</p>
<p>That night after sending off my last letter, on Saturday it was, I set out in the Twilight for a long muddy walk. I went by Satter up to the Galls-Moss (hardly known to Goody?); turned then along the Glasgow Road; walked by Pennersaughs, by Ecclefechan, and home that way:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >SE to Gall Moss via Satur, and round by Pennersaughs Kirk (&#xBD; mi. E of Ecclefechan).</note> some 8 miles in all. I passed thro&#x2019; old localities, like a ghost, and very much in the humour of one; past the Pennersaughs Churchyard where my Grandfather and great-grandfather <pb id="pg-19-226" n="19:226"/>(the farthest ancestor I can name) lie buried;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas and John (<date when="1687-00-00">1687</date>&#x2013;<date when="1727-00-00">1727</date>); see <ref target="volume-16/lt-18430120-TC-HD-01"><sic>16:24</sic><corr>TC to HD, <date when="1843-01-20">20 Jan. 1843</date></corr></ref>.</note> past Mein Brig, where I have burned whins [gorse] and done exploits in fishing eels, and in other things&#x2014;<foreign><hi rend="italic">ay de mi!</hi></foreign> It was better than many sermons; sweet tho&#x2019; very sad. I had been busy with my Index; next day too, yesterday tho&#x2019; Sunday, I was very busy,&#x2014;fireless, in wet windy weather: Jamie and I walked another 8 miles after dark that night. It was only today that I fairly finished that miserable <hi rend="italic">Index</hi> (all but looking once again at it, when once in the shape of sheets), and despatched it by the <hi rend="italic">midday</hi> mail. I have now had dinner and a little walk; and the night is sinking again;&#x2014;blustery, with some showers. Tomorrow I shall have to write to Alick. So pass my days here.&#x2014; Today there are <hi rend="italic">four</hi> Tailors here; all busy for me. Mother and Jenny, moreover, are sewing hard at flannels and night-shirts. We shall surely be furnished out before long!&#x2014;</p>
<p>The German Note yesterday was from that distracted Governess&#x2019;s English friend:<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The governess is probably &#x201C;Henri Paris&#x201D;; the English friend is unidentified.</note> I already had her pamphlets;&#x2014;I have not yet even read her Note, but merely stuck it in my pocket.&#x2014; The unread Note that came today you have now here;&#x2014;and there is something to be done with it. To wit, I have forgotten Mrs Rich&#x2019;s Address! You must find that for me; put the two Notes as you now find them in a cover for Mrs Rich, and instantly despatch them. On reading them, you will see why. I have already written to the French Official &#x201C;George Olfer&#x201D; or whatever his name is.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified or TC&#x2019;s mistake for F. F. Amyot (see <ref target="volume-19/lt-18450929-TC-MRI-01">previous letter</ref>).</note> But for M<hi rend="italic">lle</hi> Daulion, a small possibility of turning a penny might have presented itself here.</p>
<p>Tomorrow Jamie has to be off for Dumfries Rood Fair to sell horses. Isabella threatens to <hi rend="italic">die</hi> if he go! He, after consideration, has decided that he should, must and will go. One of poor Isabella&#x2019;s saddest whims is that of keeping him forever by her side tho&#x2019; she can speak only in signs to him. I am heartily sorry for her, and for him. He seems very kind to her, and humours her to all lengths; but has decided on stopping here.&#x2014;&#x2014; Take care of thyself dear Goody, in these battles with moths and Dirt!

<p><salute>My dear Brother,&#x2014;</salute>The time for the Packet drawing nigh, I, being <hi rend="italic">here</hi> where your chief interests all lie, cannot but get a line ready for you. I got to Scotsbrig almost three weeks ago, and have been loitering about, doing very little; but I can at least tell you the news of this Household, which I am very sure will be a welcome service to you.</p>
<p>Our dear old Mother was in waiting for me that morning Jamie brought me up from the Steamer; she has run about unweariedly ever since, and nothing can prevent her from the most restless endeavour to make her guest better and better off,&#x2014;far better than he has any need or wish of. She is in, what one must call very good health for <hi rend="italic">her</hi>; not much weaker than when I saw her last: her hands shake a little more, I think, and that is almost all the change one notices in her. She varies considerably, however, from day to day; has slept indifferently last night, for instance,&#x2014;we cannot expect her now to be strong. She does not mourn audibly for your absence; indeed she says expressly with thankfulness, You seem for all your sadness of mind to be doing really better than there was any clear chance of here. Good Mother! She is quite cheery yet, when moderately well in health; looks back with still resignation on many a sorrow, and forward with humble pious trust. It is beautiful to see how in the gradual decay of all other strength, the strength of her heart and affections still survives, as it were, fresher than ever;&#x2014;the <hi rend="italic">soul</hi> of Life refuses to grow old with the <hi rend="italic">body</hi> of Life; one of the most affecting sights! We were talking last night of the death of Margaret,&#x2014;that unforgettable night when you and I rode down from Craigenputtoch;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For the death and funeral of their sister Margaret (<date when="1803-00-00">1803</date>&#x2013;<date when="1830-00-00">30</date>), see <ref target="volume-05/lt-18300629-TC-JAC-01"><sic>5:116&#x2013;24</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1830-06-29">29 June 1830</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014;and were all again, as it were, brought together, the dead of us and the absent of us; in a sad but to me very solemn and profitable manner.&#x2014; I am far from happy here; indeed, in real fact, had I consulted but my own lazy feelings I had much rather not have come: nobody knows what inexpressible sorrow and confusion it is to me to look on this old Annandale in these sick humours of mine. However, I am very thankful I did come. Amid the muddy confusions outward and inward, <pb id="pg-19-230" n="19:230"/>there are things taught me here which I can learn nowhere else. Let us be thankful, for many blessings such as fall to the lot of few. Good Parents whom you <hi rend="italic">can</hi> honour, it is the foundation of all good whatsoever for a man.</p>
<p>Jenny is here with her two children, doing the house-work. She seems to me stronger and much cheerfuller than two years ago. She is a very handy active lassie; and conducts herself with much wisdom and discretion. Very diligent; does all the <hi rend="italic">sewing</hi> of the kindred, or nearly all; has her two bits of <foreign>bairns</foreign> clean as two pennies, in thrifty neatness; has them good readers, the eldest is even a good sewer. She never speaks of her misfortunes, nor does anybody else: indeed I am very glad to see the figure she cuts. Perhaps all that she has suffered may turn to her for good yet.&#x2014; Jean and her Husband seem very prosperous, Jamie getting more and more employment (has twelve journeymen this year, I think): they were very kind to my Mother and me two days last week;&#x2014;a terrible tumult of children always round them. Mary who has been unwell for a good while, with some rather dangerous tendency in the bowels, as I understand, is now very decidedly better; she was looking really well, the other day, with her children and house all clean and snug:&#x2014;I believe she still complains a little, internally; but everybody admits she is very much better. Austin was in the middle of his harvest: four ricks in, some six more expected; a really tolerable crop, better than ever he has had, they say,&#x2014;and now it is expected he will be able to go on without staggering henceforth.&#x2014; &#x2014; At Scotsbrig here, Jamie in so far as his farming affairs go has nothing bad to report of himself: prices rather high (owing to the railway, the expectation of which has already raised the price of all kinds of labour); prices very fair; a reasonable crop, stock all thriving; rent well reduced. His harvest is backward, as all the country is;&#x2014;mowing hard today, in the interval of windy showers, and <hi rend="italic">not</hi> half done yet. Indeed he is getting to <hi rend="italic">diminish</hi> his crop, year after year; and depends now more and more upon sheep, which I think may prove good husbandry for such a climate. Will Easton and his squad are here just now, rebuilding the Stable;&#x2014;exactly where it stood, only some feet higher,&#x2014;and longer, <hi rend="italic">close</hi> to the corner of old Betty&#x2019;s house. Poor old <hi rend="italic">Pate</hi> Easton<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Betty Smail; see <ref target="volume-04/lt-18280800-JWC-JCA-01"><sic>4:395</sic><corr>JWC to JCA, <date when="1828-08-23">23 Aug. 1828</date></corr></ref>. Peter Easton, presumably Will&#x2019;s brother; see <ref target="volume-01/lt-18210324-TC-AC-01"><sic>1:347</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1821-03-24">24 March 1821</date></corr></ref>.</note> is dead, last winter. Wull has the premises all full of mortar-heaps and lumber ever since I came; and seems to me to get on very slowly. But the saddest feature for Jamie is poor Isabella, who is really a heavy load, to herself and others. She cannot speak, except with great effort a word or two in a scarcely audible whisper; is obliged to lie on a sofa, and do what she can for directing her house by <hi rend="italic">signs</hi> thro&#x2019; one of her nieces <pb id="pg-19-231" n="19:231"/>from Potstown:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#xBD; mi. SE of Scotsbrig.</note> she is in terror whenever Jamie leaves her; she suffers much, in mind if not in body; and he has a very sad time of it, I think, so far as this goes. One does not hear him complain; but I notice him much graver than he used to be in former times. Nothing can be done to help his poor wife or him: Patience and quiet waiting is the only remedy.</p>
<p>This is nearly all the news I have to give of Scotsbrig. As to the rest, I have seen almost nobody, nobody at all that I could help seeing; and can only report in general that the people seem all busy harvesting; that the weather is very plashy and wet. Indeed our summer over all the Island was unusually dim and cold; people say the harvest is much better than was once expected. A very sad feature of it, however, is the Disease of the Potatoes: almost everywhere the Potatoes when nearly ripe are seized by a kind of <hi rend="italic">murrain;</hi> wither in the stems; the Potatoe itself gets black-spotted, soft, and slowly or fast inevitably goes to <hi rend="italic">mush</hi>. Jamie thinks he has lost about <hi rend="italic">half</hi> of his: he has put up his swine to <hi rend="italic">eat</hi> them as fast as possible out of the way. It is thought by some the Potatoe is about refusing to grow any more in these climates; which will be a very frightful business indeed! All over Holland, Germany &#x26;c as well as in Britain and Ireland this Potatoe-Epedemic<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> is prevalent; to a great extent, I fear, tho&#x2019; nobody as yet can tell how great.&#x2014; Near Frank Graham the Tailor&#x2019;s house (a little on the Scalewood<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#xBD; mi. SW of Scotsbrig. Frank Graham is presumably one of the tailors working at Scotsbrig on TC&#x2019;s clothes.</note> side) is seen a heap of dug earth among the corn: it marks the course of the railway in that quarter; which is just to be begun; and has raised wages, as I was saying: for two years there will likely be a greater briskness of demand for labour, and then the demand will end again; indeed it will mainly be the Irish that do the digging, I suppose; they are already crowding in great quantities into this quarter.&#x2014; One Corry (Andrew Corry, I think they called him), a drunken Drover once well known hereabouts overturned his gig on the road from Dumfries lately, and killed himself on the spot: it was broad daylight, but the poor wretch was utterly drunk.</p>
<p>Dear Brother, you must write a Letter to us soon; you will have more leisure now that the winter is coming. A Letter of Tom&#x2019;s giving a minute account of all the domestic stock is still spoken of with much praise here! Tell him to try it again; and Jane too: you cannot be too minute. I must be off homewards again, in some week or ten days. The Book is <hi rend="italic">coming</hi> out, I believe; you shall hear of me again. <closer><salute>Farewell</salute></closer></p>
