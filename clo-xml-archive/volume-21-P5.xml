<p>A Horse, as you formerly had some warning, will come tonight between 5 and 6, to go by the <hi rend="italic">Victoria</hi> Steamer to Annan, where Mr Carlyle, to whom the Horse is addressed, will have a man in waiting for him. Horse, with horsecloth and roller with bridle, saddle with <foreign><hi rend="italic">gambadoes;</hi></foreign> a very good-natured animal, tho&#x2019; of timorous and spirited temper,&#x2014;a little delicate in health at present, having had a cold some time ago.&#x2014; The Groom will help you on board with him; and I hope your people will be careful. He has been used to lie out for a week past; and must not be straitened for <hi rend="italic">air</hi>.</p>

<salute>Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Your Note yesterday found us just going into Liverpool to provide materials for the Canada Box: I meant to write you, and had even written you in Paulet&#x2019;s Office, a small fraction of a Note, inclosing that indication of the voyage of Bobus;&#x2014;but, alas, the absurd blockhead of an Omnibus summoned me thro&#x2019; Jane and Mrs Paulet to come down <hi rend="italic">instantly,</hi> twice over they said <hi rend="italic">instantly,</hi> so that I had to crumple my paper together and run down to take my seat, and then the blockheads waited above 12 minutes before stirring from the spot after all!&#x2014; So you went without any answer. Bobus crossed us, with his furniture and ticket, ridden by the Groom on our way hither.</p>
<p>I suppose the poor brute did come to hand, dead or alive, this morning; he must have had a bad passage, with wind, thunder and rain most of the night; and a horse, in the hold, I fancy must have been <hi rend="italic">sick</hi> enough, if not worse: however, the creature if alive at all will soon recover upon grass again; and at any rate I happily can now consider <hi rend="italic">my</hi> hand as free of him,&#x2014;which is a great deliverance to me indeed. The absurd bother I have had with that brute for a year and half is almost beyond belief. The Rood Fair will end that at least.</p>
<p>My motions from this place northward are yet somewhat indecisive. After tomorrow I shall have done with the Box, and without shadow of <hi rend="italic">employment</hi> here: but Jane has again grown very uncertain about her procedure;&#x2014;and indeed the whole matter must still hang rather uncertain <pb id="pg-21-4" n="21:4"/>for a few days yet. Ireland itself is undecided; I have not even written to Duffy in answer to his hospitalities. I suppose he is at any rate in a considerable quandary at present; he and his party have just been coming to a split with O&#x2019;Connel, and fairly quitting the Repeal Association in a body: so that I suppose his and their hands and hearts are abundantly full at present.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Duffy, John Mitchel, and other Young Irelanders pressed for more rigorous opposition to the govt. in Ireland. On <date when="1846-06-17">17 June</date> Duffy himself had been tried for sedition for publishing in the <hi rend="italic">Nation</hi> an anon. leader by Mitchel, known as &#x201C;the railway article&#x201C; (&#x201C;Threats of Coercion&#x201C;), advocating violence. Though Duffy escaped conviction when the jury would not agree, Daniel O&#x2019;Connell kept the issue alive, insisting on nonviolence, thereby deepening the division with Young Ireland, who believed that force could not be ruled out (see <ref target="volume-20/lt-18460722-TC-CGD-01">TC to CGD, <sic><date when="1846-07-20">20 July</date></sic><corr><date when="1849-07-22">22 July</date></corr></ref>). The withdrawal of Duffy and his allies from the meeting of the Repeal Assoc., <date when="1846-07-28">28 July</date>, led to their secession in <date when="1846-12-00">Dec.</date> and formation of the Irish Confederation in <date when="1847-01-00">Jan. 1847</date>.</note> Whether I shall go or not need not be a very momentous question with me any way.&#x2014; I hope to tell you what day you may expect me, next time I write. I hope for a word from you tomorrow, announcing the arrival of the Horse. Helen has not sent the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> at all this week, unless she have forwarded it to Scotsbrig direct.</p>
<p>We got some <hi rend="italic">hardware</hi> things (knives &#x26;c) some books (Burns, Allan Ramsay, <note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Allan Ramsay (<date when="1686-00-00">1686</date>&#x2013;<date when="1758-00-00">1758</date>), Scottish poet.</note>&#x26;c no great things of a lot); these, with other <hi rend="italic">draperies</hi> and <foreign>etceteras</foreign>, were all we could do in the way of a Box. We hope it will get safe to Alick, and be a memorial of our love to him: that is nearly all the good we can expect of it.</p>
<p>I am totally idle and alone here; read some stupid American Books; sit in a huge bedroom up stairs (Jane in a smaller one) where Mrs P.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Paulet.</note> is too polite to think of having me disturbed for any reason. The air is excellent; but my stomach and inside are <hi rend="italic">not!</hi> In fact I have great notion just at present to make a radical attempt for better <hi rend="italic">health,</hi> my <hi rend="italic">work</hi> being to an unusual extent winded up just now. But the way How is very confused. We shall see better gradually.&#x2014; <closer><salute>Good b&#x2019;ye for today. My heart&#x2019;s love to my Mother and the rest.</salute></closer></p>

<p>Your hospitable and most friendly message found me here the day after my arrival. Travelling suits me very ill, only the fruit of travelling is of some <pb id="pg-21-5" n="21:5"/>worth to me. Heaven, I think, among other things, will be a place where one has leave to sit still.</p>
<p>The Belfast steamer, it turned out on inquiry, sailed only once a fortnight; the first day too early for my limits, the second too late. Belfast therefore was out. There remained then Dublin, and perhaps a run to Drogheda, and back again to Liverpool; which did for some days seem possible; but new perversities arose from another side, unforeseen or but half foreseen; and on the whole I have to decide that Ireland for the present is impossible; that I must embark for my mother&#x2019;s this night. Tomorrow morning my address, if I prosper, will be &#x201C;Scotsbrig, Ecclefechan, N.B.,&#x201C; to which place, if you can again trouble your clerk to direct my copy of the <hi rend="italic">Nation,</hi> or failing that, to return to his old Chelsea address, it will be a kind of saving of trouble. I by no means give up my notion yet of seeing you and a glimpse of Ireland before returning home, but I must attack it now on the other side, and after a variety of Scotch movements, which are still much in the vague for me. My wife stays here for a few days longer with some relations in the neighbourhood,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Liverpool Welshes.</note> and after that, I hope, will join me in Scotland; but her health at this moment is far from good, and her movements are and must be a little uncertain. She still remembers you with true interest, and is far enough from standing between me and Ireland: she rather urges me thither, did not laziness and destiny withstand. This with many real regards and regrets, and with real hopes too, is all I can say of my Irish travels at present. You shall certainly hear of me again before I return.</p>
<p>For the present (though this was not one of my motives) it has struck me you might be as well <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to have me or any stranger near you! A crisis, and, as I augur, perhaps a truly blessed one, is even now going on in your affairs.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-21/lt-18460804-TC-JAC-01">preceding letter</ref>.</note> For the first time I read a Conciliation Hall debate last week; the veracity and manfulness, the intelligence and dignity seemed to me to be all on one side, and the transaction, though beneficent, was to me a really tragic character. But the <hi rend="italic">divorce</hi> of earnest valour from blustering and incoherent nonsense is a thing that did behove to come.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Nation</hi>, <date when="1846-08-01">1 Aug.</date>, reported the meeting of <date when="1846-07-27">27</date>&#x2013;<date when="1846-07-28">28 July</date>. On the second day the chairman, John O&#x2019;Connell (<date when="1810-00-00">1810</date>&#x2013;<date when="1858-00-00">58</date>; <ref target="volume-21/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/20502"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), Daniel&#x2019;s son, replied to a long letter from Duffy to the sec., of <date when="1846-07-21">21 July</date>, and Mitchel answered O&#x2019;Connell.</note> May a blessing follow it! Much <hi rend="italic">may</hi> follow. <closer><salute>&#x2014;Yours always,</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>My Dearest,</salute> I should have written a small word to you yesterday; but I was dead asleep at the hour of post, for I had got no sleep or almost worse than none in the Steamer, and arrived here very <foreign>wae</foreign> and weary indeed. The voyage was, as all voyages are, a misery to me; but otherwise it passed without misfortune of any kind, the Vessel, crew and fellow-passengers all preferable to those I last had in the like case; and we arrived safe at Annan shortly after 10 o&#x2019;clock, where Jack, seated in his old Gig, was at last discernible waiting for me. A dim, soft, mournful-looking, almost <hi rend="italic">pathetic</hi> looking morning, with many old pathetic reminiscences clinging to it! Jack drove me up, amid idle insignificant talk, with distant mutterings of thunder, and some scuddings of rain; and two minutes after our arrival, it became a very deluge which lasted for hours. My poor old Mother met me once again on the <hi rend="italic">close</hi> here, with a moist radiance of joy in her old eyes;&#x2014;once again: not many times more, perhaps never once more, and then it is all done, and that part of the universal destiny is for me also <hi rend="italic">complete</hi> It is not a merry place this world; it is a stern and awful place.&#x2014; As was said, I soon after my arrival flung myself upon a bed, and fell fast asleep. I am very unwell, so far as biliary and other confusions go: yesterday I did not sleep long, and today I awoke at four o&#x2019;clock: deep silence, and some friendly pillow watched by some <hi rend="italic">victorious</hi> loving one to lay my head on,&#x2014;that were the thing for me; and that is not to be had here. The loving ones here are all <hi rend="italic">un</hi>victorious too! I do not remember a more miserable set of hours for most part than those since I left you.&#x2014; But we will <hi rend="italic">hope</hi> for a good issue out of them too; nay believe in it, and manfully strive with our best strength for it! That will do something; that will do instead of all. O my Dearest, how little I <hi rend="italic">can</hi> make thee know of me; in what a black baleful cloud for myself and thee are all our affairs involved to thy eyes at this moment; threatening shipwreck if we do not mind!&#x2014;</p>
<p>There will clearly be no continuing for me here, beyond a very few days: Jack has adjusted himself into direction of all the mechanism of this house, and there is not room for both of us at all. I cannot hope for more than to get along without offence till I do the indispensably necessary, and then fly else whither to look for shelter,&#x2014;back to Chelsea I sometimes think. But indeed today I am below par in my dispiritment, and have very much the feeling of a <hi rend="italic">hanged</hi> man,&#x2014;one of those &#x201C;<foreign>weel-wight</foreign> men&#x201C; that sing after they are hanged! Courage, courage, I say; we will not surrender to the Devil yet; we will defy him yet, and do the best we can to set our foot on <pb id="pg-21-7" n="21:7"/>the throat of him yet.&#x2014; In addition to all, it has rained ever since I arrived here; and is raining heavily with prospect of continuing even now. I meant to go to Annan partly with an eye to look at that &#x201C;House and Grounds&#x201C; now for sale; partly for a <hi rend="italic">drive</hi> and to get tobacco-pipes: but the rain forbids all outgate of that sort; I have bargained for an hour of <hi rend="italic">privacy</hi> (here in Jack&#x2019;s room, the Eastern one, which is now all papered and improved), and here am I scribbling confusions to thee as the one good or half-good thing I have any chance to do today. I said &#x201C;to <hi rend="italic">look</hi> at that House and Grounds&#x201C;; but, I fear, without much chance of doing more at present: Annandale is too mournful for me; besides &#x201C;all property is risen much in price,&#x201C; all the country is torn up with railways, the most solitary lanes swarming with foreign <hi rend="italic">Navvies</hi> and Peel Policemen,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >After Sir Robert Peel as home sec. remodeled the London Metropolitan Police Force in <date when="1828-00-00">1828</date>, policemen were often called &#x201C;peelers&#x201C; or &#x201C;bobbies.&#x201C;</note> all the world expecting to find Heaven by steam. A quiet place among green fields, anywhere under the sky, would do me much good: but how to get it I do not well see just yet. Rain, rain: the rain is falling heavier than ever!&#x2014; &#x2014; My Mother enters with a message for kind remembrances to you; emphatic earnest message, evidently far sincerer than such almost ever are. Poor old woman, she said yesterday, Does Jane never mean to see us again then at all? Today she repeats in other form the same sad thought,&#x2014;as sad and kind, and truly affectionate, I do believe, as dwells in any heart but my own for you at present. But indeed you could do no good here at present, except perhaps for a day; and I will not again urge that on you, except your own mind incline. There would be much here to make you sad; and Jack is poor company for one in that humour. Poor fellow, I am very sorry for him too. He seems almost to have cast anchor here; to have <hi rend="italic">adjusted</hi> himself here to a life of <hi rend="italic">vegetating on thrifty terms,</hi>&#x2014;has been making various improvements, wooden-bridge &#x26;c; and goes idle with a cheerful face for months long: to my Mother I think his company is rather cheering than otherwise; to Isabella also he is useful; and Jamie I suppose does not mind him much.</p>
<p>You will tell me about Haddington when your resolution on it is once clear. I shall be ready at the end of next week,&#x2014;sooner if the Barings, warned by these thunders and rains, decide on <hi rend="italic">not</hi> coming. How incredible is it to my poor little Jeannie, and yet how certain in fact, that an intimation to that effect would be among the <hi rend="italic">gladdest</hi> I could get, in a small way, during these days! I will write to the Lady tomorrow that I am here according to engagement: but of invitation to her I cannot have much. This too, by God&#x2019;s blessing, what of integrity and propriety there was in all this, will one day become clear to all parties. O my Dearest to think that my affection for <hi rend="italic">thee</hi>&#x2014; But I will not speak on that thing at present. Speech is <pb id="pg-21-8" n="21:8"/>not the sacredest; Speech is very inadequate sometimes; and indeed silence too is inadequate, but it is harmless.&#x2014;&#x2014; &#x2014;&#x2014; I have inquired about Mr Paulet&#x2019;s matter; but will not put it on <hi rend="italic">this</hi> Paper. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign> my own Jane, whom nothing can divide from <hi rend="italic">me</hi>. God bless thee ever.</salute></closer></p>

<p>No news today, my Dearest; I am under <hi rend="italic">blue pill and Castor,</hi> and have not a word of news! Nor has anything come from Seaforth: indeed I had little hope of anything.

A kind hopeful word, if the Heavens please!&#x2014; You are beautiful to me in your distresses;&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">magnanimous</hi> too in all your perversions!&#x2014;</p>
<p>The Seaforth Post does not reach hither naturally till the next <hi rend="italic">night</hi> at Ecclefechan; consequently not till the <hi rend="italic">second morning</hi> here. To reach <hi rend="italic">us</hi> next morning, a Letter must be in the <hi rend="italic">Liverpool</hi> post-office before 2 o&#x2019;clock. Nota bene.</p>
<p>The rain still falls, tho&#x2019; now with longer intervals. I am for a walk in the moors, the wind being dry and brisk.&#x2014; Tomorrow we go, Jack and I, to Dumfries, if it do not pour. You shall hear a word <hi rend="italic">if</hi> there be post-time when I arrive;&#x2014;which I doubt Good b&#x2019;ye my own little Dear!

<p>This is to salute you in Stanhope Street on Tuesday morning, or even on Monday Ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi> if you chance to come so soon. I am here since Friday, amid an inextricable coil of things, the highest all jumbled into union with the lowest; which gives me enough to feel, and think of, and but little to <hi rend="italic">say</hi>, a friend of Silence as I am.&#x2014; Ireland was omitted,&#x2014;postponed. My poor Jane is fallen rather worse again; she is still at Seaforth; has an uncle and then &#x201C;Zoe&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Geraldine Jewsbury.</note> to visit before leaving that region: she is, as you may fancy, the weightiest item of my cares at present.&#x2014;</p>
<p><pb id="pg-21-9" n="21:9"/>On Thursday first, if I do not hear from you again, still more if I do hear in confirmation, I mean to be in Carlisle waylaying you. Your Inn, I conclude, will be the &#x201C;Bush Inn&#x201C;: it is the largest, and by reputation and some slight experience, I understand it to be the best. The Glasgow mail lands me there about seven in the evening,&#x2014;if there be any Lady Harriet arrived? Till Monday morning at Langholm I attend you;&#x2014;wonder to find myself in such a presence in such scenes! Natural and Preternatural,&#x2014;these two are strangely present everywhere in this Life of ours; these two are <hi rend="italic">identical,</hi> I do believe, if it were not our <hi rend="italic">stupidity</hi> that mostly saves us. A wholesome quality in some cases; and happily very plentiful.</p>
<p>To me in such circumstances all places and arrangements shall be good; and the queenship of our motions is naturally yours. At Carlisle there is nothing that I know of to be &#x201C;seen,&#x201C; nor at Langholm except green hills and quiet moorlands,&#x2014;enough of these I <hi rend="italic">can</hi> promise you. These hills are all unusually green; look moist and bright and melancholy to me, as if they had been lately <hi rend="italic">weeping</hi>. For indeed there is nothing here but thunder and rain, with bursts of bright hot weather, these two weeks past: it is hoped, but with no <hi rend="italic">sure</hi> ground that I can see, that the &#x201C;weather will take up&#x201C; in a day or two.</p>
<p>O my Friend, my Friend, how strange an element are <hi rend="italic">you</hi> in these old Langholm moors to me! <foreign>Adieu</foreign> till Thursday, if the gods do will that we meet again that day.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1846-08-13">13 Aug.</date></note> The gods are great; and so are the devils. I am not well today; I will not write another word.&#x2014; Your little Note was beautiful, in its words and in its silences. You are all good and beautiful; and I am bound to be forever grateful to you. <hi rend="italic">Bound;</hi> and do not need much binding.</p>

<p><salute>Dearest,</salute> I was much disappointed on finding no Letter from you at Middlebie<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A few mi. N of Ecclefechan.</note> this morning! Last night, in passing from Dumfries, we inquired <pb id="pg-21-10" n="21:10"/>at the Post-house; but there was nothing from you: this morning I walked down myself; but there was again nothing. A <hi rend="italic">Nation</hi> newspaper with an address which I gladly believe to be in your hand; but no <hi rend="italic">strokes</hi>, no nothing! You should have written some word or other; considering what a force of imagination one has.&#x2014;&#x2014; I could not find a moment&#x2019;s chance on Monday; we left this about 11 o&#x2019;clock, and did not reach Dumfries (lumbering round by Gill, with manifold wearinesses, manifold chagrin&#x2019;s<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> for a mind in the morbid state) till long past all hours of Post. Next day on attempting there, I found there was hardly resource to address you a Newspaper: the ink absolutely done; it is uncertain to me whether the Newspaper can ever have arrived. Jean&#x2019;s house, with noisy children and other confusions, is like a Bedlam. And now I do not even know with certainty what your address is. Surely, surely, you ought to write a word!&#x2014;</p>
<p>My Dumfries expedition, restricted itself to the rigorously essential; I saw nobody but my two Sisters; bought myself an umbrella and some small necessaries; had the usual sleeplessness, returned hither, mostly in silence, with the usual depression of heart. It is very wrong, I say often to myself; very weak, and morbid and <hi rend="italic">wrong</hi>. Depends mostly on the wretched body of me too. Philosophy, utmost &#x201C;moral resolution&#x201C; can do little except by taking the thing in flank,&#x2014;if one were wise enough to know where and how!&#x2014; Poor Jenny&#x2019;s little place in Maxwelltown (quiet close to the extremity of the Village where we used to enter it from Craigenputtoch) was quite a pathetic little pleasure to look upon. Neat as a new pin, she, her two little lassies, and it; a good back room well-carpeted (one of our old London carpets); and with 3 sovereigns I sent her she has got a quite neat four-posted bed &#x26;c, and has all in order there. Human intelligence in a state of worthy activity is beautiful to see. Plenty of <hi rend="italic">work</hi> Jenny is getting: she comes here tomorrow; but here, I clearly enough discern, there will be no continuing for me. I rather wish I were well away again. More than once I have thought of that little backroom at Jenny&#x2019;s: absolutely I must contrive to get into some quiet place, and be allowed to <hi rend="italic">sit</hi> there, amid fresh air, and delivered from this avalanche of confusions which hurts me much otherwise.&#x2014; The Potatoes have <hi rend="italic">wholly</hi> failed, this year: but there is plenty of labour and money; Dumfries too is to have its railway, and go to Heaven by Steam.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Dumfries Courier</hi>, <date when="1846-09-07">7 Sept.</date>, reported that potatoes were &#x201C;a universal failure&#x201C; and some local farmers &#x201C;were afraid to dig for fear of what they would find.&#x201C; A parliamentary bill of <date when="1846-08-13">13 Aug.</date> had authorized the route of the Glasgow, Dumfries &#x26; Carlisle Railway, which was to join the Caledonian Railway at Gretna.</note> <foreign><hi rend="italic">Ach, gib mir einen grossen Gedanken, damit ich mich erquicke</hi></foreign> [Oh, give me a great thought, to refresh myself with]!&#x2014; But on the whole I have got some cold in my bones <pb id="pg-21-11" n="21:11"/>today, am <hi rend="italic">very</hi> full of cramps, aches, ailments; and may as well hold my peace, and go and fast and walk. The weather has grown cold and nearly dry.&#x2014; My one glad piece of news this day is in the enclosed Note,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >From Lady Harriet.</note> which postpones my Carlisle expedition till Friday, and contracts the extent of it by one third. Read the Note; there is no high-treason in it, I think! <closer><salute>O my Goody, my dear bewildered Goody,&#x2014;God help thee to clearness, and me. Ever thy own.</salute></closer></p>

<ps><p>The <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi> Newspaper, if it ever arrive, I want it directed to Alick: &#x201C;Brantford, Hamilton, Upper Canada&#x201C; with two strokes. If you know the fate of the Box, you may mention it. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign> Dearest</salute></closer></p>
<p>How shall I direct this? Seaforth will be safest: the very change of address would have impelled you to write <hi rend="italic">possible</hi>, which by the <hi rend="italic">Nation</hi> I see writing is!&#x2014;</p></ps>

<p><salute>Dear Jeannie,</salute> what am I to make of this continued silence? No Letter this morning still! Do you remember when you called four times at the Seaforth Post-Office yourself? It surely is not fair. Write to me as briefly as you like, but write. There can be no propriety in punishing me by such feelings as <hi rend="italic">these</hi> are. It is like seething a kid in its Mother&#x2019;s milk.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Exod. 23:19, 34:26, and Deut. 14:21.</note> If I cared less about you, the punishment would be less! It is not fair, nor right.</p>
<p>Yesterday I attempted to <hi rend="italic">walk</hi> off my cold; went out with your Letter accordingly to meet the Waterbeck Post (for our Post-office is <hi rend="italic">moveable</hi> here, and walks on two legs); after finishing with whom I made a long circuit with strenuous contempt of toil and omission of dinner: this morning I awoke at 3, but nevertheless do feel considerably better; and look out upon the pouring rain with some contentment at my yesterday&#x2019;s stock of exercise. This is Lamb-Fair day:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >At Lockerbie.</note> Jamie went off with a thousand lambs for sale, an hour after I awoke, amid winds and deluges; I took a cup of tea with him along with my pipe down stairs; I fell twice asleep again for a little while; and am, as I said, somewhat better.&#x2014; The Cow intended for Seaforth, it is feared, will not answer: her copious milk when tried by itself proves <hi rend="italic">thin</hi>, and seems not to be rich in butter or cream. There is another <pb id="pg-21-12" n="21:12"/>of the pure Galloway breed, which can be altogether recommended, except that she is eight years old,&#x2014;only some five or some six years more of effectual milking in her. Her price will be I know not what,&#x2014;cheaper than the other. Failing her, there is another Galloway quite young, now giving her first milk; she and no other that is yet discoverable. Jamie declares it impossible altogether to buy a <hi rend="italic">good</hi> milk Cow in any market, or by any general method here,&#x2014;possible only to buy a good-<hi rend="italic">looking</hi> Cow which may prove good or not good.&#x2014; Till I hear <hi rend="italic">something</hi>, I think I need not speak more on this subject.</p>
<p>My poor pocket-comb, if it be not left at Seaforth, is <hi rend="italic">lost;</hi> which grieves me a little. Also the <hi rend="italic">boots</hi> which you intended for my Mother, which I first recollected to speak to her about, this morning: I think they must be lying at Seaforth, for I assuredly packed them in at Chelsea, and they are not here&#x2014; My poor old Mother was much gratified to think you had remembered her in that way:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-20/lt-18460719-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1846-07-19">19 July</date>]</ref>.</note> &#x201C;they w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be worth two pair of new ones to me.&#x201C; Isabella, in a very authentic manner has expressed the loyal joy it would give her to see you here: in fact they do all love you truly, and deeply grieve to hear of your being unwell at present. What thoughts <hi rend="italic">I</hi> have of it, day and night, I will not state at all, till there come some means of getting belief to my words again. O my darling, if you could look into my heart of hearts I do not think you could be angry with me, or sorry for yourself either. May good Angels, instead of bad, again visit you;&#x2014;may <hi rend="italic">I</hi> soon meet you again, for I still think I can be your good angel if you will not too much obstruct me! Will you meet me on the road to Haddington? Shall we go to some quiet lodging on the Coast together? Write me, write me!</p>

<dateline><place>30 Carlton Terrace, Green Heys, near Manchester</place>, / Thursday, [<date when="1846-08-13">13 August, 1846</date>.]</dateline>
<p>In the first day or two after your departure I <hi rend="italic">could</hi> not write any Letter that you would not have found worse than none,&#x2014;and&#x2014;so you got none! &#x2026; The only thing like a purpose that would stay an instant in my mind, was at all rates to get out of Seaforth as soon as possible. That great echoing, disorganised place had got to look to me a perfect madhouse; and Betsy, with her fixed idea of my &#x201C;liver-complaint,&#x201C; and incessant tactless remarks on my &#x201C;wild looks&#x201C; reminding her now of &#x201C;Nodes after he had taken poison,&#x201C; now of &#x201C;Marianne before her brain fever,&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Nodes Newton and their sister Mary Ann.</note> now of &#x201C;old Nannie in her last illness,&#x201C;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Nanny,&#x201C; joining the household in <date when="1802-00-00">1802</date>, was &#x201C;the beloved nurse of eight children of Mrs Newton&#x2019;s, and of three of her grandchildren.&#x201C; She joined the Paulet household in <date when="1835-00-00">1835</date> and stayed until she died &#x201C;at an advanced age&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Memorials of the Life of Mrs Newton by her Daughter</hi> [<date when="1867-00-00">1867</date>]58, 132).</note>&#x2014;of the Devil and his Grandmother,&#x2014;had become more like a tormenting demon for me than the kind friend I had been used to think her. I tried hard to get away on the Saturday; but she would not hear of it &#x2026; On Monday, however, I got away with decency, to Manchester for the moment, with little hope of getting more good there than I had got in the other place; but with that sort of blind, instinctive seeking for relief which makes sick people turn off one side upon the other. The journey freshened me up a little. Geraldine received me at the Garden-gate with a quiet kindness that boded well; and every hour that I have been here, I have thanked God that I came just when I did. The stillness, the good order, the modest elegance of this bright little half-town half-country house feels like a sort of <hi rend="italic">cradle</hi> into which my good angel has laid me for a little while to lie still and make-believe to sleep.</p>
<p>&#x2026; But I must not stay long; for this house is not Geraldine&#x2019;s, but her Brother&#x2019;s;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Frank Jewsbury.</note> who tho&#x2019; also most kind to me,&#x2014;carrying his consideration the length of proposing &#x201C;to hire in a Piano for me, if it would amuse me to play a little,&#x201C;&#x2014;might nevertheless get bored if his privacy were too long invaded by his Sister&#x2019;s friend. So I have determined in my own mind to go to Maryland Street on Monday, where I shall not be so cradled and rocked,&#x2014;far from it; but where I cannot avoid going without giving pain. What after? Many a scheme has been in my poor head, one after another cast out as <pb id="pg-21-14" n="21:14"/>distracted; and the feasiblest thing I see for the present is to go home to Chelsea. Scotland looks to me more <hi rend="italic">difficult</hi> and more <hi rend="italic">useless</hi>, the longer I think of it &#x2026; Neither with you nor without you could I front all that, without the painfullest emotions; and emotions are certainly what I should not go out of my way to seek! just now,&#x2014;at least not sad ones.</p>
<p>I might take my Cousin Helen back with me for a while as a social restraint in a small way, and to leave you more at liberty from the fret and responsibility of me. I should spend less money, too, living at home than streaming about in this fashion. The ruling virtue strong in death; my ideas of economy will, I suppose, be the last sane ones to leave me!</p>
<p>Give my kind love to your Mother and the rest there.</p>
<p>I do not know where to address you; but they will either forward my Letter, or it will be lying for you on your return to Scotsbrig.</p>
<closer><salute>Ever yours,</salute></closer>

<p>No word from you yet; not the scrape of a pen<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech.</note> this morning either! It is not right, my poor dear Jeannie, it is not just, nor according to the <hi rend="italic">fact;</hi> and it deeply distresses and disturbs me, who had no need of disturbance or distress otherwise if all were well known to thee;&#x2014;but it is best that I suffer it with little commentary. To thee also I will believe it is no luxury.&#x2014; I said to myself, last night, while tossing and tumbling amid thousandfold annoyances outward and inward, &#x201C;It is not fair all this; really it is not fair! I wanted to do none any injury; my one wish and aim <hi rend="italic">was</hi> to pass among them without hurting any, doing good to some if I could. My own lot has been but emptiness; and they all cry, See thou has taken something of mine!&#x201D;&#x2014; The Jackass brayed, or the Horse neighed, or some of the children coughed; and roused me from these unprofitable reflexions again.</p>
<p>Silence is better than most speech in the case: this however I will say and repeat: The annals of insanity contain nothing madder than &#x201C;jealousy&#x201C; directed against such a journey as I have before me today.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >To meet the Barings.</note> Believed or not, what is verily a fact. To the deepest bottom of my heart that I can sound, I find far other feelings, far other humours and thoughts at present than belong to &#x201C;jealousy&#x201C; on your part! Alas, alas!&#x2014; But I will say no more today: <pb id="pg-21-15" n="21:15"/>if before Monday when I return there be not some word from you, I must write to Mrs Paulet;&#x2014;I must on the whole allow the informal deities to go <hi rend="italic">their</hi> full swing; but Madness shall not conquer if all my sanity can hinder it. O my Jeannie, my own true Jeannie, bravest little Life-companion hitherto, into what courses are we tending! God assist us both,&#x2014;and keep us free of frightful Niagaras, and Temptations of Satan!&#x2014;&#x2014; I am indeed very miserable. My Mother asks, &#x201C;No word from Jane yet?&#x201C; And in spite of her astonishment, I am obliged to answer None.&#x2014;</p>

<salute>My dear Helen</salute>

I am not going tomorrow either&#x2014;Geraldine arranged a pleasure-excursion for me tomorrow to the house of Bamford &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">the Radical</hi>&#x201C; and my love of punctuality was not equal to putting a veto on it<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC is writing on Sun.

<place>Carlton Terrace, Green Heys, Manchester</place>, Monday, <date when="1846-08-17">17 August, 1846</date>.</dateline>
<p><salute>My dear Husband&#x2014;</salute>I am very grieved at all this uneasiness you have had for want of Letters. To punish you was far as possible from my thoughts. Often as I have pained you, first and last, I <hi rend="italic">never</hi> caused you <hi rend="italic">intentional</hi> pain, so far as I remember, and cannot fancy that I should ever be so &#x201C;far left to myself&#x201C; as to do <hi rend="italic">that</hi>.</p>
<p>I did not answer your first Letter to Seaforth by return of Post, because I was feeling myself really <hi rend="italic">frightfully</hi> ill, and <hi rend="italic">could</hi> not have written at the moment without saying so; and I did not wish to make you anxious about me,&#x2014;more anxious than you already were. I could have written on my arrival in Manchester on Monday, but in the Letter I got from you that morning before starting, you said you were going to Dumfries. I had been mistaken as to the day you were to be at Carlisle&#x2014;fancied it Wednesday&#x2014;and so, that you would not return to Scotsbrig but go through from Dumfries to Carlisle; and then I was meaning to go myself to Maryland Street on Thursday. In the helpless sort of mood I was in, I let myself believe that no Letters <hi rend="italic">could</hi> pass between us for two or three days; and when I wrote on Thursday, it was in full assurance that I was &#x201C;taking time by the forelock,&#x201C; having a Letter at Scotsbrig lying ready for you on your return. And so I managed to have it there just exactly in the wrong moment, the very day you went away,&#x2014;as I discovered to my sorrow on Friday night when I received the Letter you wrote on your return from Dumfries. It had been to Maryland Street as well as to Seaforth! The other two followed on Saturday and Sunday, every one making me more vexed. <pb id="pg-21-17" n="21:17"/>But there was then nothing to be done but just to let the result of my miscalculation and mismanagement work itself out.</p>
<p>For the rest, I have no cause to regret my visit to Manchester, but every reason to be thankful that I came when I did and staid as I have done. I shall have many things to tell you of it when we meet; for by Geraldine&#x2019;s skilful management my mind has been kept wide awake with one thing or another all day long.&#x2014; But I must not get into &#x201C;narration&#x201C; just now, for having walked four or five miles thro&#x2019; the fields last night <hi rend="italic">after dark</hi>, I lay too long in bed this morning,&#x2014;considering that we have to start at twelve to spend the day with&#x2014;Bamford! who promised to tell us witch-stories among the glens of Balachly.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Blackley or Blakeley, just N of Manchester, Bamford&#x2019;s home. Bamford mentions &#x201C;stories of Mother Demdike, and other witches of Lancashire&#x201C; in &#x201C;The Traveller,&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">Walks in South Lancashire</hi> (Blackley, <date when="1844-00-00">1844</date>), in which he also pbd. &#x201C;Walks among the Workers, No. VIII. Township of Blackley&#x201C; 250&#x2013;55.</note> He is a fine sturdy old fellow, Bamford &#x2026;</p>
<p>It follows then that I do not go to Liverpool to-day either,&#x2014;not till Wednesday; for, to-morrow, I have to see a Foundry and a Printing-mill and a Warehouse.</p>
<p>I saw the Box nailed up and sent off to the Countinghouse before my departure. &#x2026; I am very indisposed for Maryland Street; in fact look forward to Wednesday with a sort of terror!</p>

<p>Thank Heaven I have heard from you! Two Letters lying here on my return, and another very swift and hasty which has arrived since.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A. Carlyle notes: &#x201C;Mr. Froude had this Letter of Carlyle&#x2019;s, plainly dated <date when="1846-08-20">20th August, 1846</date>, before him when he was writing the thing commonly called a Biography of Carlyle, for he cites a passage from the Letter &#x2026; ; but, to make it appear that Carlyle had not heard from his Wife till the <date when="1846-08-25">25th of August</date>, he suppresses that part of it which shows that Carlyle had had <hi rend="italic">three Letters</hi> from her by the <date when="1846-08-20">20th of the month</date>, and proceeds at once to give Carlyle&#x2019;s Letter of the <date when="1846-08-26">26th of August</date>, which begins: &#x2018;My dear Goody,&#x2014;I had thy Letter yesterday at last; many thanks for it,&#x2014;and do not keep me waiting so long again!&#x2019;&#x2014;A very characteristic example of &#x2018;Froudulency&#x2019;&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">NLM</hi> 1:202n). For Froude&#x2019;s account of the delayed letters and the Carlyles&#x2019; continuing differences, see <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi> 3:388&#x2013;95. A. Carlyle had reason for his complaint; but he provided only incomplete texts of several of these letters, the originals of which he once owned and which strangely have not come to light. Froude&#x2019;s misrepresentation may come from sacrificing accuracy to narrative, but as A. Carlyle says, he had presumably read the full original letters. Froude was probably right, therefore, in believing that it had been a mistake for TC to join JWC at Seaforth House, where their differences flared up and JWC refused to go on to Scotland, particularly to join the Barings. Froude went on to say that though she soon suppressed her dissatisfaction, &#x201C;Small occasions of provocation constantly recurred. Mrs. Carlyle consented to stay with Lady Harriet and submit to her authority as often and as much as she required. &#x2026; But the wound burst out at intervals, embittering Carlyle&#x2019;s life. &#x2026; She wrote to him while he was at Scotsbrig &#x2026; , and he, man-like, believed that all was well again&#x201C; (3:393&#x2013;94).</note> You are better too, far better, than my gloomy notions had represented you in those late <hi rend="italic">watching</hi> nights. I will thank Geraldine too, for she has done me a great service, the poor Z<hi rend="italic">oe!</hi>&#x2014; Meanwhile a word &#x201C;by return of post&#x201C;; and it must be a brief one, as all words from this scene of rainy confusion ought to be.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-21-20" n="21:20"/>My five days expendition has been one of the unsuccessfullest (if pleasure in any sort had been my object) that I ever undertook. We had the worst of weather; I the worst of sleep,&#x2014;noisy cabins in confused whiskey inns; an average of 3 hours sleep per-night! The Lady herself takes ill with rain; indeed grows quite miserable till the fair weather come again: the patience of Baring seemed to me immense! We came to Langholm in rain-torrents; weathered it out there, with difficulty till Monday morning: on Monday morning,&#x2014;alas, the Buccleugh house-hold gave notice that it had <hi rend="italic">hooping-cough</hi>; no visit thither was possible;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably at Drumlanrig Castle, 17 mi. NW of Dumfries, the main seat of Walter Francis Scott (<date when="1806-00-00">1806</date>&#x2013;<date when="1884-00-00">84</date>; <ref target="volume-21/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/24929"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), 5th duke of Buccleuch and 7th duke of Queensberry (see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350817-TC-JCA-01"><sic>8:198</sic><corr>TC to JCA, <date when="1835-08-17">17 Aug. 1835</date></corr></ref>).</note> the time to be spent there, till new engagements and rendezvouses at Glasgow could take effect, must now be spent elsewhere. Beattock, by Moffat, after much sorrowful consulting was at last decided on; I to stay two days till Beattock also were done. Beattock also, with rain and drunken Navvies, was very bad: in blinks of fair weather we did tolerably well, but they were rare;&#x2014;and all nights the noise and sleeping was of the rate I told you! During rain we had to sit in a little room, where neither fire in the grate nor the smallest chink of ventilation otherwise could be permitted; one grew half-distracted naturally in such an element, and prayed for fair weather as the alternative of suicide. The brave Baring&#x2019;s cheerfulness and calmness never failed him for a moment. Happily yesterday we <hi rend="italic">had</hi> a good day: moors, clear brooks and Moffat Well much admired &#x26;c: I left my Hosts just setting out for the Grey Mare&#x2019;s Tail (which I think they would hardly reach),<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A waterfall ca. 10 mi. NE of Beattock; see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18330907-TC-JWC-01"><sic>6:436</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1833-09-07">7 Sept. 1833</date></corr></ref>.</note> and got upon the Glasgow Mail hitherward,&#x2014;glad to the heart of one thing, That I was to get away, and have a chance of sleep and freedom again! The kindness of friends is surely precious; but sleep too and practical sense and the free use of tobacco are good! O my Goody, my Goody what a <foreign><hi rend="italic">daft</hi></foreign> creature art thou in thy sick imaginations! I have had many thoughts of thee in these nights; of which perhaps there will be notice by and by.&#x2014;This morning, once more in rain, my kind Hosts (I doubt not) are forward towards Glasgow and the wet Highland glens; I on the contrary have got some coarse but copious sleep (thank Heaven), and find myself, tho&#x2019; much <hi rend="italic">brashed</hi> and stupified, considerably better: and so this weighty matter has had its <hi rend="italic">end</hi>. On one of the Beattock nights I scrawled you in much hubble from our little airless room a kind of Note, directing it at a venture to Maryland Street; next night Lady Harriet presented me with another sealed, of which I completed the address in like manner: mine I think you may be reading at this moment; hers will come tomorrow: of little use either of them, except to keep your fancy quiet.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lady Harriet Baring wrote to JWC, 18 Aug., from Beattock Inn, Moffat: &#x201C;In the uncertainty of where this should be directed to you, I deliver it to Mr. Carlyle, who goes from us to-morrow.&#x2014; The only check to our felicity has been the missing you; and more, the accounts he gave of the little permanent good Seaforth had as yet done you. &#x2026; / You are very, very foolish to go on without some trial, at least, of advice and remedies. I <hi rend="italic">am sure</hi> your headaches could be very much mitigated; and cough and all kinds of derangement will come upon neglect. Whatever one&#x2019;s own belief and feelings in the matter, it is a thing one owes to those who are anxious and careful, to neglect no reasonable care for one&#x2019;s health and life. And you are really trifling with the first. Nevertheless, against my harsh strictures, I will set the hope that you are really bettering ere this; and that we shall improve and take still further care of you in November at Alverstoke. You must spend that dreary month with us there, where I hope we shall be fixed by the end of October.&#x2014;&#x201C;</note></p>
<p><pb id="pg-21-21" n="21:21"/>I rather judge you are right in not coming farther at this time. Haddington without a rest here is a long laborious journey from where you are; and the weather is wet, and the result <hi rend="italic">uncertain</hi>.

Ill spirits, ill health. Oh what a world for her too noble being, and for some others not so noble! I had left perhaps a week before the date of this letter, sorrowfully enough, but not guessing at all how ill she was. She had gone to Geraldine&#x2019;s quiet place in Manchester, rather as in duty bound than with much hope of solacement or even of greater quietude there; both of which, however, she found, so beautiful was Geraldine&#x2019;s affectionate skill with her, delicacy, wise silent sympathy and unwearied assiduity (coming by surprise too), for which she never forgot Geraldine.&#x2014;T.C.&#x201C;</sourceNote><head>

He lived at 2 Grove Terr., Higher Broughton, Manchester, in <date when="1847-00-00">1847</date>, and 3 Harewood Pl. in <date when="1848-00-00">1848</date>. He came from Corfu to Manchester as a boy of fourteen and was given his start as a merchant by Frank Jewsbury. He was said to be &#x201C;a very handsome and cultivated young man, of singular refinement of mind and manners&#x201C; (Espinasse 153). G. H. Lewes drew his portrait as Stavros Frangipoli in the novel-fragment <hi rend="italic">The Apprenticeship of Life:</hi> &#x201C;In appearance he was one of those men who flash upon you from amidst a crowd, and though seen for but an instant, leave an indelible impression. Closer inspection loved to linger on the details of his striking face&#x2014;on a delicate brow, compact rather than lofty, and having something feminine about it; on long, dark glowing eyes full of tenderness and energy, on the aquiline nose and sensitive mouth. A short beard covered his chin and a rich olive complexion gave the final grace to this strange and Titianesque head, which had so curious a mingling of fierceness and gentleness that Armand <supplied>[a character in the novel]</supplied> sportively likened him to &#x2018;a vulture fed on milk!&#x2019;&#x201C; (quoted by S. E. Howe, <hi rend="italic">Geraldine Jewsbury</hi> [<date when="1935-00-00">1935</date>] 69&#x2013;70). He was an intimate of the Jewsbury family. Geraldine found him &#x201C;over-metaphysical and subtle&#x201C;; Frank Jewsbury named his son after him (Howe 69&#x2013;70). In time becoming a friend of JWC&#x2019;s, he gave her her dog Nero in <date when="1849-00-00">1849</date>. Espinasse says that he had &#x201C;a certain longitude of neck&#x201C; and that TC later &#x201C;compared him to a crane that had alighted on our shores and would one day wing his way to his distant home&#x201C; (Espinasse 153). Others of the Dilberoglue family were an elderly mother, a sister Calliope, and a brother Spirro.</note>&#x2014;and even at that late hour I started writing after I had gone up to bed&#x2014;not knowing what might come in the way this morning to hinder me&#x2014;but the fates had decided once for all that I should not sign and seal a letter for you yesterday&#x2014; While I was sitting scribbling with all my clothes still on, even to the broaches and bracelets, down plumped my candle into the socket and left me in total darkness&#x2014;to scramble into my nightclothes as I could&#x2014;</p>

<p>Short while after this I at length roused myself from torpor at Scotsbrig, and made, still very slowly, for home. Slowly, and with wide circuit, by Dumfries, Craigenputtock (oh my emotions there with tenant McQueen in the room which had been our bedroom).<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Macqueen.</note> After two hours at Craigenputtock with MacQueen, who had now become a mighty cattle-dealer, famed at Norwich, much more over all these moor countries for his grandeur of procedure (and who in a year or two died tragically, poor man!), I returned to Dumfries, took coach next morning for Ayr, impressive interesting drive all the way, wandered lonesome, manifoldly imagining, all afternoon, over Ayr and environs (Arran from the sea sand, in the hazy east wind nightfall, grand and grim. Twa Brigs,<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Burns, &#x201C;The Brigs of Ayr.&#x201C;</note> &#x26;c.). Ayr was holding some grand market; streets and inn had been chokefull during the sunny hours; in twilight and by lamplight become permeable enough, had not one&#x2019;s heart been so heavy. I stept into a small stationer&#x2019;s shop, and at his counter wrote a poor letter to my mother. Except two words there, and a twice-two at my inn, no speech further in Ayr. After dark, rail to Ardrossan<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On the Firth of Clyde, SW Scotland.</note> (bright moon on the sandy straggling scene there), step on board the steamer for Belfast, intending a little glimpse of Ireland before Liverpool, Duffy and other young Repealers waiting me there, all on the ship. At Belfast next morning, breakfast, stay few hours, (cold stony town) take coach for Drogheda where Duffy and Mitchell will await, a post-office letter will say in what particular house. Coach roof in the sunny day pleasant enough; country rough and ill-husbandried, but all <hi rend="italic">new</hi>; Portnadown Bridge (of the great massacre of <date when="1641-00-00">1641</date>);<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-20/lt-18460312-TC-CGD-01">TC to CGD, <date when="1846-03-12">12 March</date></ref>.</note> Duke of Manchester&#x2019;s house;<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Tandaragee Castle, 5 mi. SE of Portadown.</note> a merry enough young Dublin gentleman sitting next me occasionally talking merry sense. Potatoes all evidently rotten; every here and there air poisoned with their fateful smell. At Drogheda, dismount. Postmaster has no letter for me; angry old fool reiterates &#x2018;None, I tell you!&#x2019; and Duffy, who was there waiting and had a letter waiting, stayed in vain, and did not return till afternoon next day; would have had the Drogheda official punished (or at <pb id="pg-21-25" n="21:25"/>least complained of), but I wouldn&#x2019;t. An angry old fool, misanthropic, not dishonest, pleaded I. Rolled into Dublin (to Imperial Hotel) by railway. After sunset, wandered far and wide about the broad pavements, listening to the wild melodies and cries of Dublin (on a Saturday night), went tired to bed, and, in spite of riotous sounds audible, slept well enough.</p>
<p>In Dublin or neighbourhood I continued till Thursday or Friday; saw various persons, places, and things, which had a kind of interest to me. One day saw Conciliation Hall, and the last glimpse of O&#x2019;Connell, chief quack of the then world&#x2014;first time I had ever heard the lying scoundrel speak&#x2014;a most melancholy scene to me altogether. Conciliation Hall something like a decent Methodist chapel; but its audience very sparse, very bad, and blackguard-looking; brazen faces like tapsters, tavern keepers, miscellaneous hucksters and quarrelsome male or female nondescripts, the prevailing type; not one that you would have called a gentleman, much less a man of culture; and discontent visible among them. The speech&#x2014;on potato rot (most serious of topics)&#x2014;had not one word of sincerity, not to speak of wisdom in it. Every sentence seemed to you a lie, and even to know that it was a detected lie. I was standing in the area in a small group of non-members and transitory people quite near this Demosthenes of blarney, when a low voice close at my ear whispered in high accent: &#x2018;Did you ever hear such damned nonsense in all your life?&#x2019; It was my Belfast Drogheda coach companion, and I thoroughly agreed with him. Beggarly O&#x2019;Connell made out of Ireland straightway, and never returned&#x2014;crept under the Pope&#x2019;s petticoat &#x2018;to die&#x2019; (and be &#x2018;saved&#x2019; from what he had merited)<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >O&#x2019;Connell spoke to his last meeting at Conciliation Hall, <date when="1846-11-16">16 Nov.</date>, and last appeared in the House of Commons, <date when="1847-02-08">8 Feb. 1847</date>. He left England for Rome, <date when="1846-03-22">22 March</date>, and died in Genoa, <date when="1847-05-15">15 May 1847</date>. His heart was embalmed and buried in Rome, his body returned to Ireland.</note>&#x2014;the eminently despicable and eminently poisonous professor of blarney that he was.</p>
<p>I saw Carleton&#x2014;Irish novelist (big vulgar kind of fellow, not without talent and plenty of humour);<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Carleton (<date when="1794-00-00">1794</date>&#x2013;<date when="1869-00-00">1869</date>; <ref target="volume-21/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/4679"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), Irish novelist.</note> certain young lawyers who have since come to promotion, but were not of moment; certain young writers do. do. Dined at John Mitchell&#x2019;s with a select party one evening, and ate there the last truly good potato I have met with in the world. Mitchell&#x2019;s wife, especially his mother (Presbyterian parson&#x2019;s widow of the best Scotch type),<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mitchel&#x2019;s wife was Jane, b. Verner; m. <date when="1837-00-00">1837</date>. His mother was Mary, b. Haslett, widow of the Rev. John Mitchel, presbyterian minister of Camnish, nr. Dungiven, co. Londonderry. Mitchel wrote to a friend: &#x201C;Miraculous to tell <hi rend="italic">Sartor Resartus</hi> has been here, and for two evenings we heard him prophesying (by &#x2018;we&#x2019; I mean young Irelanders generally) to our infinite contentment. If I had known it in time to allow me to write for you, I would have done so; for a sight of him for once in a man&#x2019;s life is worth a considerable journey. &#x2026; He attended Conciliation Hall with us, and says he has at length seen the utmost length of human platitude. We have had some angry altercations with him&#x201C; (Seamus MacCall, <hi rend="italic">Irish Mitchel, A Biography</hi> [<date when="1988-00-00">1988</date>] 132).</note> his frugally elegant small house and table, pleased me much, as did <pb id="pg-21-26" n="21:26"/>the man himself, a fine elastic-spirited young fellow with superior natural talent, whom I grieved to see rushing on destruction, palpable by &#x2018;attack of windmills,&#x2019; but on whom all my dissuasions were thrown away. Both Duffy and him I have always regarded as specimens of the best kind of Irish youth, seduced (like thousands of others in their early days) into courses that were at once mad and ridiculous, and which nearly ruined the life of both, by the Big Beggar-man,<note n="15" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Daniel O&#x2019;Connell.</note> who had 15,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year (and <foreign><hi rend="italic">proh pudor</hi></foreign> [for shame]! the favour of English ministers instead of the pillory from them) for professing blarney, with such and still worse results. One of my most impressive days was the Sunday (morrow of my arrival) out at Dundrum<note n="16" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The village 3 mi. S of Dublin.</note> waiting for Duffy, who did arrive about night. Beautiful prospect; sea with shore and islets; beautiful leafy lanes; mile on mile in total silence, total solitude. I only met two persons all day: one promenading gently on horseback; the other on foot, from which latter I practically learnt that the &#x2018;Hill of Howth&#x2019; was unknown by that name here, and known only as the &#x2018;Hill of Hoath.&#x2019;<note n="17" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ca. 560 ft., on the peninsula of Howth, N side of Dublin Bay.</note> My last day there was also pretty; wide sweeping drive with Duffy and Mitchell. Dargle, stream and banks, Powerscourt, gate and oaks, &#x26;c., altogether fine; finally to Bray and its fine hotel to dinner, till steamer time came, and they hospitably put me on board.<note n="18" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Powerscourt, co. Wicklow, site of Powerscourt Castle and of a large waterfall where the river Dargle drops 400 ft. Bray is a town 12&#xBD; mi. SE of Dublin.</note> <foreign>Adieu! adieu!</foreign> ye well-wishing souls.</p>
<p>Next morning between five and six I was safe seated on my luggage before the door of Maryland Street (Liverpool), smoking a cigar in placid silence till the silent home should awaken, which it somehow did unexpectedly before my cigar was done.&#x2014;<name>T. C.</name></p></ps>

<p><salute>Dearest,</salute> what has become of you again? Surely you are growing a very bad correspondent! On Wednesday night I had a hasty notice that your schemes had a little altered, that I was to write by return of post: I punctually wrote accordingly; and ever since wait in vain for any note from you, uncertain even what your address is. Really you should have written <pb id="pg-21-27" n="21:27"/>me one word; one word is easily written, and the postage is but a penny! On Saturday, on Sunday, on Monday I long eagerly, to no purpose. On saturday I would have written myself, but an expedition to Annan hindered; yesterday still more surely I would have written, but it involved an express to Ecclefechan, for on Sunday we have no &#x201C;moveable post-office.&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Without a postal delivery on Sun. outgoing letters could not be given to the postman.</note> Today, again disappointed, I can write a word, and walk out to meet the post with it myself. My Goody was once a better writer,&#x2014;ah me, and will be so again, I hope!</p>
<p>Since you heard last of me I have done nothing; altogether literally <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi>. One has not room here even to prosecute one&#x2019;s own <hi rend="italic">thoughts</hi>, one has to talk trivialities, or lie idly <hi rend="italic">ruminating;</hi> work, exertion of any kind is as good as an impossibility. On Saturday, as you heard, I was at Annan; the day being good I decided to overtake that small problem of <hi rend="italic">looking</hi> at the Country house for sale near Annan;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-21/lt-18460808-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1846-08-08">8 Aug.</date></ref></note> got myself, not without confusions conquered, driven down to Annan; saw Wull Carruthers (the managing Writer),<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Will Carruthers of Breckonhill; see <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410620-TC-AC-01"><sic>13:153</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1841-06-20">20 June 1841</date></corr></ref>. &#x201C;Writer&#x201C; here means lawyer.</note> saw above all things the &#x201C;Country house&#x201C; in question,&#x2014;a detestable Peat-pot full of rushes and alder-bushes and green stagnancies of moss-water in a very fetid state, expected to sell at a rate like the neighbourhood of the New Jerusalem;&#x2014;and instantly decided that it was not worth speaking of for one other instant! Beside Annan, I may venture henceforth to assure myself, there is no &#x201C;quiet residence&#x201C; like to be provided for me. After new misventures (owing to my charioteer, the Dr, always intent on <hi rend="italic">original</hi> methods) I got home to tea, in the beautifullest bright silent afternoon; having <hi rend="italic">walked</hi> most of the way, and dined&#x2014;upon two-thirds of a new penny-loaf, which I purchased from a cadger incidentally wending thro&#x2019; those parts.

<salute>Dear Spedding,</salute>
<p>I am here, for a week past or more; with little chance of going farther north; with a tendency rather towards Ireland, and so southward again. There is a kind of half-promise attracting me towards Dublin for a few days; promise which I failed to perform on my way hitherward; which my poor conscience, rather than any hope or other allurement, urges that I ought to endeavour after on my return. My indolence is at present beyond measure; indeed my sufferings from all kinds of travel are such as to inspire a very natural horror at locomotion; a wish, gradually becoming the one wish which swallows all others, To be allowed to lie still. Which wish, I do surely believe, is on the way of being gratified by and by!</p>
<p>Daily I see Skiddaw and the Mountains in unusual clearness; daily I am reminded of your old friendliness to me. Had I the wings of a dove<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Book of Common Prayer, Ps. 55:6.</note>&#x2014; But I have no wings; no tolerance for coach-drivers and noisy inns! I sit wishing I could make you a little visit; not much hoping it: I write at any rate to give myself a chance.</p>
<p>Pray tell me if you are at home; how you are off for room; at what hour your Coach leaves Carlisle; what conveyances you have on the Liverpool side,&#x2014;it is there I could take Dublin by Steam, and perhaps get home by Cork and Bristol. Pray let me hear.&#x2014; I left my Wife with her friends in Lancashire: I think she hardly meditates coming farther north, but will <pb id="pg-21-29" n="21:29"/>return shortly to Chelsea with one of her lady Cousins for companion. She was far from well; but seems to be recovering a little since we parted.</p>

Daily this world and its ways become the more <hi rend="italic">un</hi>utterable to me; daily my own small share in it the more Sphinx-like, unfit for the dialects of these days.

<p><salute>My dear Goody,</salute> I had thy Letter yesterday at last; many thanks for it,&#x2014;and do not keep me waiting so long again! No news could be welcomer than this, that you have been recreating and improving your mind by assiduous inspection of the works and ways of Manchester; most welcome unexpected news! The black spiderwebs that take possession of one&#x2019;s fancy, making one&#x2019;s poor little heart and soul all one Golgotha and Egyptian Darkness,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Exod. 10:21. Golgotha was where Jesus was crucified.</note> are best of all to be sent about their business (home to the Devil whose they <hi rend="italic">are</hi>) by opening one&#x2019;s eyes to the concrete fact of human life in some such way as that. O my Goody, my own dear little Jeannie&#x2014; But we will hope all that black business has now got safe into the Past, and will not tear up our poor forlorn existence in so sad a way again! God be thanked you are better. And now tell me that you eat a little food at breakfast as well as dinner, and I will compose myself till we meet.</p>
<p>Total idleness still rules over me here: the brightest still autumn weather, blue skies, windless, with Noah&#x2019;s-ark clouds hung over them; plenty of good tobacco; worthless Yankee literature, and many ruminations in the Moor or Linn: that is all; the voice of the Devil&#x2019;s Cauldron singing one into really a kind of waking sleep. In spite of cocks, children, bulls, cuddies, and various interruptions at night, I victoriously snatch some modicum of real sleep for most part; and could certainly improve in health, were a continuance in such scenes of quiet permitted me. But it is not: I must soon lift anchor again, and go.</p>
<p>Yesterday I wrote to Spedding: if he pressingly enough invite, I think of taking Ireland on that side. The route to Portpatrick is by <hi rend="italic">night</hi>. Liverpool <pb id="pg-21-30" n="21:30"/>and Steam appears to be the eligible road. Tell me, would not you like a glimpse at the Lakes? With authentic sincerity now! I will meet you at Lancaster, and escort you safe to Speddingdom if you consent. Spedding is actually a fine honest fellow; his Wife and the rest of them one and all are very supportable people, who will be proud to have us, I do think; and the Country all round is really worth looking at apart from all twaddle. Say; and swiftly that I may have my answer ready when Spedding writes.&#x2014;&#x2014; Today this little Note arrived from Espinasse; I have written his Certificate, and hope he may really get the place.&#x2014; Jenny and my Mother are this day <hi rend="italic">washing</hi> with all their might; clearing up my soiled duds for me. I have displaced Jack; and write in the East room <foreign>Adieu</foreign> Dearest; answer straightway. <name>T. Carlyle</name></p>
<ps><p>I had already written to Manchester; the <hi rend="italic">Newspaper</hi> of yesterday, and that, would probably arrive at Liverpool together. Kind regards to your Uncle and all in Maryland Street.&#x2014; Good sleep there?</p></ps>

<p>To tell you the prosaical truth, I am afraid I should not take half as much interest in the <hi rend="italic">Lakes</hi> as in the Manchester Mills! my tastes being decidedly <hi rend="italic">Utilitarian</hi> for the moment! There, the Speddings are good people certainly, but as old Sterling used to say of the Bartons,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The family of John Sterling&#x2019;s wife, Susannah; see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18360824-TC-JWC-01"><sic>9:45</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1836-08-24">24 Aug. 1836</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-16/lt-18430707-JWC-JW-01"><sic>16:239&#x2013;40</sic><corr>JWC to JW, <date when="1843-07-07">7 July 1843</date></corr></ref>.</note> &#x201C;so damnably unstimulating!&#x201D; And it strikes me further, that I and my luggage would considerably encumber you on that journey. <hi rend="italic">Two</hi> rooms would need to be stipulated for beforehand, and two are not to be had in every house, so conveniently as one. Besides, the embarrassment of having to state one&#x2019;s sleeping difficulties to strangers. And then when one man with his portmanteau and carpetbag can be transported commodiously in a gig, two people with two sets of luggage cannot get along without postchaises,&#x2014;at a ruinous cost!</p>
<p>On the other hand, I am sensible that <hi rend="italic">movement</hi> and <hi rend="italic">change</hi> are good medicines for me; and also that when you kindly offer me <hi rend="italic">a pleasure</hi> I ought not to <hi rend="italic">look it in the mouth</hi>, but take it thankfully. And so, do <hi rend="italic">you</hi> decide for me how it shall be. I am ready to meet you at Lancaster on a day&#x2019;s notice; ready to return to Chelsea and do a little in the earth-quaking line. In short, ready for anything except to stay on here, with an everlasting <pb id="pg-21-31" n="21:31"/>smell of roast meat in my nose, no sleep to be had for cats and carts! no talk to be had except about gowns and bonnets! Truly, since I left Geraldine, I feel to have fallen from the &#x201C;Indian Horse&#x201C; into &#x201C;a quickset hedge, and scratched out both my eyes,&#x201C;&#x2014;how impatient I am to &#x201C;scratch them in again&#x201C; is not to be told!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The nursery rhyme &#x201C;There Was a Man of Thessaly&#x201C;; see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18401029-TC-JAC-01"><sic>12:307</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1840-10-29">29 Oct. 1840</date></corr></ref>.</note></p>
<p>Your Letter this morning found me in the determination to go home on Monday, at farthest;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >She is writing on Thurs.</note> but I shall take no further steps till I hear from you again, beyond sending Helen a little money to go on with. My own notion is, that I should be as well at Chelsea <hi rend="italic">sorting things</hi> till you come, as going on the uncertain adventure of the <hi rend="italic">Lakes;</hi> but I know that I am very fainthearted, and that my <hi rend="italic">own notion</hi> is not always the best &#x201C;to carry out.&#x201C; So I await your decision. &#x2026;</p>

<p><name>Dearest,</name> your Letter as usual was long looked for! Yesterday and the day before I had gone to the Post-house myself that there might be no mistake or delay; but in vain; there awaited me mere trivialities instead of what I wanted. At length yester<hi rend="italic">night</hi>, by an occasional conveyance, the little packet did arrive,&#x2014;very welcome to me, as the best I can get at present. I lie totally inert here, like a dead dry bone, bleaching in the silent sunshine; often enough my feeling of loneliness, of utter isolation in this Universe, is great! Useful I dare say; one requires occasionally to be somewhat severely taught. Abdallah the Vizier used to retire at intervals, and contemplate the wooden clogs he had first started with; and found it do him good amid his vanities.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Abdallah ibn-Yasin (d. <date when="1058-00-00">1058</date>?), learned and pious Moslem; founder of Almoravides, a sect in NW Africa and Spain.</note> Probably there may lie a little more work in me; nay I think there will and shall:&#x2014;in which case, <hi rend="italic">complaint</hi> is not the dialect one should speak in. Courage!&#x2014;</p>
<p>There seems to be no good outlook towards the Lakes at present, even had your heart towards the enterprise been stronger than it is. Yesterday morning I had that Note from Spedding: childbirth and biliary complaints are not an inviting set of circumstances!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henry Anthony Spedding (<date when="1846-00-00">1846</date>&#x2013;<date when="1887-00-00">87</date>), b. <date when="1846-08-09">9 Aug.</date> at Mirehouse, Spedding&#x2019;s father&#x2019;s house. Spedding wrote, <date when="1846-08-27">27 Aug.</date>, that he and his brother, &#x201C;the Baconian Philosopher,&#x201C; staying at Mirehouse, had been ill, but &#x201C;We are, or rather I hope soon shall be in condition to welcome you from any of the four winds.&#x201C;</note> On the whole I vote that we give <pb id="pg-21-32" n="21:32"/>up the speculation; that you, as Maryland Street is doing nothing or less than nothing for you, persist in your plan for Chelsea,&#x2014;by Monday rather than a later day, if all suit. I know not whether you intend to take Cousin Helen with you, or to expect her afterwards; do whatever way you find pleasantest in regard to all that and other things; only be sure you ascertain which <hi rend="italic">is</hi> the swift mail train of 7 hours (not of 13, as mine last year!) and go by that. I shall like better to fancy you in Chelsea, earthquaking, and putting all in order, and at least in your own house and own quiet bed, than tumbling about as you now are. Home, therefore, is the word. And remember one thing: to write a little oftener to me. And as near the old tone as you can come before the &#x201C;spider-webs&#x201C; got upon the loom at all! In me is no change, nor was, nor is like to be. Alas I do not much deserve to be loved by anybody,&#x2014;not much or at all: but I am very grateful if anybody will take the trouble to do it. God guide us all; for our pathway is sometimes intricate, and our own insight is now and then very bad! O my dear good little Jeannie&#x2014;but there will come a day when all that will be intelligible again. I should be miserable if I thought there would not. Again, courage!&#x2014;</p>
<p>My time here ought evidently now to be extremely <hi rend="italic">brief</hi> All is ready; nothing hinders me from going except my own pusillanimity mainly; and I do mean very soon to go. Ireland, not as a hope but as a reproachful unexecuted purpose, still hangs before me. The Lake-country and Portpatrick are out as routes, at least the former is: I ought to choose some other, by Glasgow, Ayr, or whichever it be. In a few days now, <hi rend="italic">some-whither</hi> I expect to be upon the route. Probably Dumfries where I have still some tatters of business to do ought to be my first stage. I think you had better address your first Letter thither: Mrs A<hi rend="italic">n</hi> [Aitken] Assembly Street, Dumfries. If you write on Sunday or even Monday morning I am apt to get it there. You will evidently require some <hi rend="italic">money</hi> too: I will send you some the instant I know you are gone towards Chelsea; Darwin or any man with a Banker will be able to help you in getting it, failing your own selfhelp which may suffice.&#x2014; No Letters except more trash, worse than none of which I inclose you a specimen. I do not answer any of them. When you get to Chelsea you will save me the <hi rend="italic">pennies</hi> they cost. No word from the Barings: I suppose them safe lodged in their Inverness region now, and rejoicing in the good weather. <closer><salute>Good be with thee, Dearest, ever.</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I am still here, lounging about, with occasional excursions, in a very idle manner, for some weeks past: one of the stillest, most mournfully interesting scenes for me in all this world. The moors are still silent, green and sunny, and the great blue vault is still a kind of Temple for one there,&#x2014;almost the only kind of Temple one can try to worship in in these days. Otherwise the country is greatly in a state of <hi rend="italic">defacemen</hi>t: the Harvest, with its black potato-fields no great things; and all roads and lanes overrun with drunken <hi rend="italic">Navvies;</hi> for our great Caledonian Railway passes in this direction, <hi rend="italic">two</hi> railways, and all the world here as elsewhere calculates on getting to Heaven by steam! I have not in my travels seen anything uglier than that disorganic mass of Labourers, sunk threefold deeper in brutality by the threefold wages they are getting. The Yorkshire and Lancashire men, I hear, are reckoned the worst; and not without glad surprise I find that the Irish are the best in point of behaviour. The Postmaster tells me several of the poor Irish do regularly apply to him for money-drafts, and send their earnings home:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The two railways were the Caledonian (Carlisle-Glasgow via Beattock) and the Glasgow-Dumfries-Carlisle. The <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi>, <date when="1846-09-07">7 Sept.</date>, reported that Mr. Gracie, of the King&#x2019;s Arms, Lockerbie, had let Irish navvies use a room free of charge for their Roman Catholic services on Suns. and that in their spare time they had harvested his corn in return, a labor shortage being partly caused by local men working on the railway.</note> the English, who eat &#x201C;twice&#x201C; as much beef, consume the residue in whiskey, and do not trouble the Postmaster. If there were any Legislator in this country, he would swiftly and somewhat sternly I think interfere in the matter: a poor self-cancelling &#x201C;National Palaver&#x201C; cannot interfere. &#x201C;Parliament in College Green&#x201C;:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >I.e., an Irish national parliament. &#x201C;National Palaver&#x201C; is TC&#x2019;s sobriquet for the Westminster parliament.</note> O Heaven, you!&#x2014;ought daily to thank Heaven, that that is forever an impossibility for you!&#x2014; I could like also to shew Exeter Hall and the Anti-Slavery Convention<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400912-TC-MAC-01"><sic>12:253</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1840-09-12">12 Sept. 1840</date></corr></ref>.</note> a glimpse of these free and independent Navvies on the evening of monthly pay-day, and for a fortnight after!&#x2014; But enough of them and their affairs.</p>
<p>I am now looking homewards; but have not yet by any means given up my purpose to have a glance at Ireland first. On the contrary I am now busy seeking out an eligible route. One or two on closer investigation have been renounced: my view at present is towards Ayrshire, towards some of the Western Scotch Ports. Glasgow, at any rate, will not fail to offer a steamer, but I do not except on necessity care to see Glasgow at present. One way or <pb id="pg-21-34" n="21:34"/>other I think it likely I may be in Ireland, on some point or other, in a week hence. You shall hear from me again, with more minute specifications, in not many days.</p>
<p>If Dundrum be, as I fancy, a clean sea-village,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >It was inland.</note> it might be possible to procure, what I find for most part very unattainable away from home, a lodging with a <hi rend="italic">quiet bedroom</hi> in which the wretched Traveller might hope for natural <hi rend="italic">sleep!</hi> All else is indifferent but that; and that too has generally to make itself indifferent. But if such were the case, I might very pleasantly stay two or three days beside you, and bathe in the Irish Sea, before I went farther. In any case I mean to see you there, to have a considerable colloquy with you, if I can.&#x2014; My next Address will be Dumfries (Mrs Aitken, Assembly Street); but after Wednesday I shall not be sure of getting it at once. Pray let the <hi rend="italic">Nation</hi> henceforth be sent to <hi rend="italic">Chelsea</hi> as heretofore, where my wife will now in two days be. I wish I were there myself, and my travels well over! <closer><salute>/ Yours ever truly</salute></closer></p>
<name>T. Carlyle</name>
<ps><p>I cannot read your Landlord&#x2019;s name at Dundrum; so must stand by the old address</p></ps>

<p><salute>My Dear&#x2014;</salute> Your Letter on my plate yesterday morning, along with one from Geraldine, was all that I took for breakfast, everything else at the table was so overlaid by a dense population of lazy flies that I turned from it in sacred horror. &#x2026;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Thanks God,&#x201C; however, I shall have but two days more of this disgust. On Wednesday night I hope to get some clean tea at Chelsea. I should have gone to-day, only that with the possibility of meeting you in Cumberland I had to send my linen to the washer-woman and cannot have it back till to-morrow morning. To-morrow I will pack, and see Harriet Martineau &#x2026; and on Wednesday home! thankful to &#x201C;come out of this&#x201C; anyhow! Helen does <hi rend="italic">not</hi> accompany me; I did invite her from a feeling of <hi rend="italic">duty</hi> more than of inclination. &#x2026;</p>
<p>I went to hear J&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; M&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Martineau.</note> yesterday morning, as a compromise betwixt going to the Family Church and causing a Family disturbance by <pb id="pg-21-35" n="21:35"/>staying at home. The Sermon was &#x201C;no go.&#x201C; The poor man had got something to say which he did not believe, and could not conceal the difficulty he found in <hi rend="italic">conforming</hi>. Flowers of rhetoric world without end, to cover over the barrenness of the soil! I felt quite <foreign><hi rend="italic">wae</hi></foreign> for him; he looked such a picture of conscientious anguish while he was overlaying his <hi rend="italic">Christ</hi> with similes and metaphors, that people might not see what a wooden puppet he had made of him to himself,&#x2014;in great need of getting <hi rend="italic">flung overboard</hi> after the Virgin Mary, &#x201C;<foreign>Madame sa M&#xE8;re</foreign> [Madam his Mother].&#x201C;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alluding to the story about John Knox in <hi rend="italic">Heroes, Works</hi> 5:147&#x2013;48. As a French galley-slave, he threw overboard an image of the Virgin Mary he had been told to reverence, saying that it was just a painted &#x201C;piece of wood,&#x201C; thus showing the &#x201C;primary characteristic of a Hero, that he is sincere.&#x201C; Martineau&#x2019;s life shows no justification for JWC&#x2019;s charge against him.</note> The heat of the place, coming on the back of no breakfast, made me quite faint; so that I had to lie down in the &#x201C;Boot&#x201C;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A little bedroom in the Maryland St. house (A. Carlyle).</note> till dinner-time.</p>
<p>On Saturday Helen, Mary and I dined at Seaforth with a party. The Dickensons are still there, and this was a grand <hi rend="italic">flare-up</hi> to their honour and glory.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly the Paulets&#x2019; friends referred to in later letters as Mr. and Mrs. Dickinson of Bond St., London.</note> Mr. Rawlins was as amiable for me as ever, in spite of your cruel usage of him.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably TC had met Charles Rawlins at Seaforth House earlier in the summer.</note> Among the many charming things he said to me, I remember only this:&#x2014;&#x201C;that it was a source of deep astonishment and regret to him that a woman <hi rend="italic">like Mrs. Carlyle</hi> (tremendous emphasis on the three last words) should <hi rend="italic">make a point</hi>, as it were, of seeing <hi rend="italic">the Devil</hi> everywhere. For his part, he utterly disbelieved in the Devil.&#x201C; The rest of the people were still more tiresome, especially the old S&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> who is like a sort of thing one sees in a nightmare. I would not have gone at all; for a party at Seaforth is always a terrible affair; only that Betsy looked hurt, and my Cousins disappointed. So I sacrificed myself, as one does occasionally, to the welfare-of-others principle. &#x2026;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jewsbury wrote to JWC, <date when="1846-09-01">1 Sept.</date>, that Elizabeth Paulet &#x201C;was in an ecstasy of astonishment at your brilliant spirits and brilliant appearance on Saturday.&#x201C; She had been in Manchester and &#x201C;was looking ill. &#x2026; She did not seem natural somehow, and began to explain how it was she had hit on a wrong method of amusing you at Seaforth; but, as if she felt it required excuse, she spoke very kindly and affectionately of you, and seemed really relieved when I told fier you never &#x2018;settled&#x2019; with me, and had taken a horror of all that sort of thing. She feared you were vexed.&#x201C;</note></p>
<p>My kind regards to Jean and Jenny. I wrote to Lady Harriet on my arrival here a longish Letter, as <hi rend="italic">amusing</hi> as I could make it.</p>

<salute>My dear Alick,</salute>
<p>Before quitting Scotland, I will here, in a very confused element, among Jean&#x2019;s children on a Dumfries <hi rend="italic">Wednesday</hi>, write you a hurried word. I have been in this native region the better part of a month; left London about the <date when="1846-07-00">end of july</date>, and joined Jane in Lancashire whither she had gone a little while before me; abode there about two weeks; then came over to Scotsbrig, where I have been, off and on, ever since. Jane could not muster resolution to accompany or follow me; she has lingered to and fro in the region of Liverpool or Manchester ever since; and is this very day, as I understand, travelling homewards by the railway, to arrive at Chelsea, and be quiet again, <hi rend="italic">tonight</hi>. She was not at all in a strong state when I left her; but I believe has improved since, tho&#x2019; to all appearance she is but weakly still.</p>
<p>One of the most important acts we did was the making up of a Box for you to &#x201C;Bield near<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The word &#x201C;at&#x201C; has been crossed out and &#x201C;near&#x201C; written above the line.</note> Brantford&#x201C;; an actual deal <hi rend="italic">Box</hi>, full of rather useless nicknacks, the usefullest we could find, which I suppose to be now at Sea, fairly on its way towards Montreal, from which Town it will be forwarded to you, we hope duly and without cost: the Paulets, Merchant people with whom we were staying, undertook that for us, and seemed as if they might succeed. You shall hear more minutely, if once I were got home, as to this Box and its contents: I do not think it can well reach you before <date when="1846-10-00">October</date> according to the guess I now form.&#x2014; Before that, I had sent you off thro&#x2019; Mr Greig a Copy of the new edition of <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi>, which I hope may be getting near you almost by this time; it is the best and final edition of the Book: your former Copy you may give if you like to Brother John. I was terribly tired before I got done with that job, among such confusions as I was in; but now I <hi rend="italic">have</hi> done with it, and all is right there. And so enough of Books and Boxes for the present.</p>
<p>Our good old Mother met me on the <hi rend="italic">close</hi> at Scotsbrig with her welcome once again; and has yesterday again given me her silent farewell,&#x2014;a very <foreign><hi rend="italic">wae</hi></foreign> affair for both of us! It is inexpressibly sad to me, such a parting, after one of these confused visits; and I often think it would be better for me if I never came again! But that ought not to be either, while the opportunity is left.&#x2014; Our good Mother is in her usual health, not specially complaining of anything; but grown now very feeble, easily struck down with any whiff of cold or the like. She walked out with me sometimes as far as the top of <pb id="pg-21-37" n="21:37"/>Middlebie Rig; was cheery and patient of heart, anxious as ever about one and all of us. Repeatedly she expressed her reflexions upon not hearing from you for so long back; but we endeavoured to quiet her by alledging your harvest labour in these weeks. We hope there will a Letter come soon, and speak for itself.&#x2014; Jamie has been building, a kind of <foreign><hi rend="italic">Tofall</hi></foreign> [lean-to] (of small extent, for a scullery and boys&#x2019;-bed room) in front of his dwelling house, besides a Stable (last year) and other little things: I understand his <hi rend="italic">stock</hi> operations have been pretty successful, and he was rather thriving: we left him busy in the heart of his shearing,&#x2014;some parts of his crop very good, others decidedly light and weak; as I understand almost <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the <hi rend="italic">early</hi> corn is, this year, ill-filled, poor and half-useless; only the <hi rend="italic">cold</hi> corn being good. In the turnips also there were deficiencies; and as for the potatoe crop, that is utterly gone, not worth digging; here and in Ireland and everywhere it is totally rotten and lost! If it were not for Indian meal, the Irish would be in a dreadful state; some five millions of them absolutely <hi rend="italic">without</hi> food or means: but there is plenty of Maize corn in the Earth, and this year the Government has very wisely decided that the Country Gentlemen shall cess themselves, and <hi rend="italic">procure work</hi> for the Irish Peasants, so that no willing labourer may be without means of keeping himself alive!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On <date when="1846-08-17">17 Aug.</date> Lord John Russell informed the House of Commons that &#x201C;the prospect of the potato crop is even more distressing than last year&#x2014;that the disease had appeared earlier, and its ravages are far more extensive.&#x201C; It was therefore &#x201C;imperative on the Government and Parliament to take extraordinary measures for relief.&#x201C; He then introduced an act &#x201C;to facilitate the employment of the Labouring Poor for a limited period in distressed districts in Ireland.&#x201C; It received the royal assent on <date when="1846-08-28">28 Aug.</date> and became popularly known as the Labour Rate Act. Public works were to be started in regions with unemployment, paid for in the first place by a govt. loan, to be repaid over ten years by a local rate levied on landowners. In late <date when="1845-00-00">1845</date> Peel had acted through Baring &#x26; Co. to import large quantities of Indian corn (maize) for relief in Ireland. In <date when="1846-08-00">Aug. 1846</date>, however, Russell, reacting to protests from merchants and landlords about such interference in free trade, promised not to import or supply any food, the means for its purchase being theoretically possible by the wages paid under the Labour Rate Act.</note> We consider here that the Potatoes are about as good as <hi rend="italic">gone</hi> altogether, and not to be depended on any longer as an article of food;&#x2014;which will make a most complex affair for the governing parties in years coming. What to do with a people whom you have no potatoes to give, and who have wages like ours? A grave question indeed!&#x2014;All thro&#x2019; Annandale, this year, there are such wages as were never seen before; the great Railway rapidly in progress, 3 and 6 pence a-day for a spademan: but the poor wretches only drink more whiskey with it, make themselves greater brutes with it! Indeed most of them are Yorkshiremen; all the labour in Annandale is nothing like sufficient for the job: and in about another year it will be done.&#x2014; O dear Brother, I am at the bottom,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of the page. Most of what follows is cross-written at the top and side of the first page.</note> and nothing is yet said!&#x2014;</p>
<p><pb id="pg-21-38" n="21:38"/>Jack has come thus far with me; for I am going round by Ayr and Belfast (in Ireland) to vary the route a little; and do not yet expect to be home for about a fortnight. Jack as you know has been at Scotsbrig for several months; our Mother seems to be rather the better for him; and he does not yet see any way of being busy to better purpose than there. I wish we saw him <hi rend="italic">settled</hi> some where poor fellow.&#x2014; Jenny came down, to assist during my stay at Scotsbrig; I doubted we were too <hi rend="italic">crowded</hi> about our poor Mother, and did her harm with our confusions; but she would not let us say it. Jenny is to stay yet a week; Jack sees me away here, and then returns. All are well and seemingly doing well here. The like at Gill, where we saw them yesterday; busy <hi rend="italic">inning</hi><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Bringing in grain from the field.</note> and mowing. All join in the kindest affection to you. Write <hi rend="italic">immediately</hi>, if you have not written by this Packet just arrived. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign> dear Brother. /</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name></p>

<p>Your Letter just come,&#x2014;I mean it came last night;&#x2014;and you are to be at home this evening. Many thanks for it. Punctual for once!</p>
<p>I believe I am to go by Ardrossan and Belfast; off tomorrow morning at 8 if there be room in the Ayr Coach. I have also some peep at Manchester perhaps privately in my eye. See Ballantyne&#x2019;s Letter, which I inclose: it met me yesterday when fairly on the road.&#x2014;&#x2014; Oh dear, Oh dear, what a sad dumb scene for me yesterday, at coming off!

<p>&#x201C;Tomorrow morning&#x201C; look in the Box <hi rend="italic">again</hi> (that means Friday morning), you will find another Letter from me, with cash (if all go right): This reaches you on Thursday <hi rend="italic">night</hi> I think; I would not keep you altogether without word; and as yet there is time for no more.</p>

<p><salute>Dearest,</salute> You had a Note today already, which was to reach you on Thursday <pb id="pg-21-39" n="21:39"/>Night, and bid you expect this for Friday morning. Your best plan will be to get Darwin, who will teach you what to do (there is a small thing to fill up at the bottom, and sign with your name); the money is payable <hi rend="italic">at once;</hi> and Darwin, after you have seen him, and done the needful in the way of signing, can manage the matter with his own Banker without troubling <hi rend="italic">you</hi> farther. Failing Darwin, you must get Craik; and go with him to the Payne &#x26; Smith people themselves;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Smith, Payne &#x26; Smith, bankers, 1 Lombard St., City.</note> they hold out just one door beyond the <hi rend="italic">Mangen &#x2019;Ouse</hi> (Mansion House); an Omnibus takes you to the very place, and you transact the Affair in a minute, and come home again,&#x2014;only taking care not to be robbed!&#x2014; On the whole, I had better fill it up myself, and then you have nothing to do but to <hi rend="italic">sign</hi> and <hi rend="italic">date</hi>. Take Fifty Pounds for household money, and lay by the other Fifty till I come. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Voil&#xE0; tout</hi></foreign></p>
<p>I hope you are home at Chelsea hours ago,&#x2014;it is now ten at night. Heart&#x2019;s welcome to your own house again, dear Goody! And sleep well this night for my sake, as well as for your own. Let me find you able to eat some breakfast again when I return. And may all be well&#x2014;O Heavens, may all be well once more!&#x2014; &#x2014;for the rest you are to write to me immediately; immediately, were it but one word to say that you <hi rend="italic">are</hi> at home, and that the cash is come. I expect to be at Dublin on Sunday morning. Write <hi rend="italic">immediately:</hi> &#x201C;Post-Office, Dublin&#x201C;; I can give you no better address: I have heard nothing precise of Duffy, and cannot yet read his Landlord&#x2019;s name with confidence. &#x201C;Post-Office Dublin&#x201C; will be best; and I shall get it on Sunday, I think if you write on Friday. Do not disappoint me as you did once at Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Today I have had but an unfortunate day; Jack who is still with me has the hapless art of creating or causing chagrin to me in due plenty, and makes very bad company for a man in such a mood as mine. He likes me too, and is himself very unhappy, poor creature! But in fact this land is all full of <hi rend="italic">sorrow</hi> for me; little other than a cave of Death now. Let me not complain.&#x2014; I saw Adamson; all right on his side, and more money than I expected to find. M&#x2019;Queen doing well with Craigenputtoch: I meant to go thither today,&#x2014;but it was too late before we got all settled. Tomorrow if it again prove fair will do. A drive round by Caerlaverock (a mournful old moated pile, like a black <hi rend="italic">skeleton</hi> of the Past),<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A ruined medieval castle, 7 mi. SSE of Dumfries.</note>&#x2014;that was all the exercise today. But the route to Ireland is settled;&#x2014;and I am to get a horse-cloth to wrap my feet in, for the outside of Coaches! My route, after investigation, is thus: Friday morning at 8, Coach to Ayr (by Dunscore, Moniaive &#x26;c) 60 miles, arrive about 5 p.m; then rail to Ardrossan (some ten miles), and there at 10 p.m. get on board a Steamer to Belfast: reach Belfast &#x201C;in 6 <pb id="pg-21-40" n="21:40"/>hours,&#x201C;&#x2014;early on Saturday morning; then by some Coach or other get to Drogheda that night (some 70 and odd miles,&#x2014;30 from Dublin by rail remain), where I expect to hear of Duffy, to whom I write tonight: would to Heaven I were safe there, and all that botheration over; I have not in me the strength of half a hen in the matter of resolution at present! But we shall get it done too, I suppose. God bless thee, dear Goody. <closer><salute>Thine Ever</salute></closer></p>

<p>Of course you will slit off <hi rend="italic">this</hi> leaf,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See first paragraph above.</note> before you go farther! The <hi rend="italic">Banker</hi> has no need to see this one!&#x2014;</p></ps>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>On Friday, the day after Tomorrow, I purpose to set out for Ayr; and ten miles beyond that, at Ardrossan, expect to find a steamer which will land me at Belfast early next morning,&#x2014;some time between 4 and 6 a.m. of Saturday I hope to see Belfast; and get very swiftly out of the smoke of it again. So far is clear prediction, if the Fates will: after that I am somewhat in the vague&#x2014;but do confidently expect to find some Coach that will carry me to Drogheda that same day; and calculate accordingly on <hi rend="italic">passing</hi> the Saturday night at Drogheda, <hi rend="italic">sleeping</hi> or not as the Destinies appoint! From Drogheda to you, by aid of railways &#x26;c, I think there cannot be above 2 hours: some time on Sunday, at some place or other, I flatter myself we shall <hi rend="italic">have</hi> met. My ulterior movements shall remain undecided till I have rested for a day.</p>
<p>Drogheda, as Cromwell&#x2019;s city, and twice besieged in that War,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >After the rebellion of <date when="1641-00-00">1641</date> Drogheda was relieved by the 12th earl of Ormonde, and in <date when="1649-00-00">1649</date> it was stormed and taken by Cromwell.</note> is a place I could look at for some hours with proper interest,&#x2014;especially if I had any intelligent monitor to tell me what to look at: but that I fear is far too great a luxury to hope for! I must try to do the best I can without that. In any case, I will call at the Post-Office; and if a Letter from you lie there waiting me with any indication as to Drogheda, and more especially as to yourself, and <pb id="pg-21-41" n="21:41"/>how I am best to see you, it is like to be very welcome indeed. No more in such a hurry as this.</p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I am here safe; a good enough journey thro&#x2019; very pleasant country: I have stept into Bookseller&#x2019;s Shop to signify so much to you!

<p><salute>Dearest,</salute> this time you have been very punctual, and have given me a great pleasure: about two hours after my arrival here, just when I had done with tea, I stepped across to the Post-Office (after better computation of the times), and <hi rend="italic">found</hi> your little Letter: a thousand thanks to you! I read it by <pb id="pg-21-42" n="21:42"/>the light of a street lamp, and again by the interior light, after my long walk over many, many streets was ended; and now I will write you a poor fraction of a word to say that I am safe; and then to bed, for a little sleep, of which by this time I am not without need!</p>
<p>I came by Ayr, by Ardrossan, as projected; was at Belfast this morning before the Clock struck six; got hither before the same hour at night;&#x2014;have had many adventures and impressions,&#x2014;which will be talk for us in the winter evenings that are coming. Today I have talked with all manner of persons, squiereens,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Squireens, petty gentlemen.</note> dandies, policemen, boors, coach-guards; found them all somewhat entertaining to me; a <hi rend="italic">new</hi> people, really of interesting ways to a stranger.&#x2014; At Drogheda I did <hi rend="italic">not</hi> find any Note or Message from Duffy; found only a crowded <hi rend="italic">market-day</hi> (of which phenomenon I had had a sore specimen yesterday at Ayr); I decided therefore on coming on hither without disloading my luggage at all,&#x2014;and on the whole was as well pleased not to have any Duffy or other extraneous person to bother me just at present. I am high aloft here, in a very good and most regular-looking inn, wonderfully silent for a frequented inn; and hope to sleep tonight, and be a fresher man tomorrow. So soon as the eye is satisfied with <hi rend="italic">seeing</hi>, I can any morning come my ways again. I have been terribly tumbled about, and maltreated by the &#x201C;Commonplaces&#x201C; (I may call them), which to skins of ordinary thickness are indifferent: but on the whole have got no real harm, and perhaps it will really do me good. At all events I could not come home without executing this project: and now it is executed; the laws of honour are satisfied, and I can come when I like.&#x2014; Tomorrow I will seek out Duffy: if I find him gone from home, I shall have the less call to stay, but shall still manage very well what is essential in the matter.&#x2014; <foreign>Ach Gott</foreign>, I have often wished I were at home again beside my own poor Goody! But it is of no use wishing. O my own dear Jeannie, wilt thou never love or trust me any more? One day we shall be as poor Jones is;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly the schoolmaster whose wife had died in <date when="1846-08-00">Aug.</date>; see <ref target="volume-21/lt-18460814-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, [<date when="1846-08-14">14 Aug.</date>]</ref>.</note> and the survivor will regret these things! But I will not end in sadness so; not so.&#x2014;&#x2014; &#x2014;&#x2014; Longer than Tuesday morning I do not in any case think I shall stay; monday itself is a very possible day.

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Here I am safe and sound, sooner than I expected; and I will not lose a post in putting you out of your anxieties about me: I cannot better end the day than doing so. Last night I wrote you on the Counter of an Ayr Bookseller&#x2019;s shop; tonight I am in my own bedroom high up here in Jack&#x2019;s H&#xF4;tel<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >One where John Carlyle had stayed, probably in <date when="1840-00-00">1840</date>; see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400201-TC-AC-01"><sic>12:26</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1840-02-01">1 Feb. 1840</date></corr></ref>.</note> (which I find to look very well hitherto), and have nothing to disturb me except the Cries of Dublin, which are many and musical, and come up to me much softened at this height!</p>
<p>I left Ayr directly after putting in your Letter; such a Train as I never saw in any Railway,&#x2014;apparently about two thousand drunk and half-drunk men, the <hi rend="italic">last</hi> Train from Ayr Races: right glad was I, for one, to get out of such a dusty hurly-burly. I did not go to Burns&#x2019;s Monument<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >At Alloway, nr. Ayr; see <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390818-JWC-TC-01"><sic>11:170</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1839-08-18">18 Aug. 1839</date></corr></ref>.</note> or anywhere; all was one boiling whirlpool of noise, drunkenness and dust; I quietly withdrew to the Seashore and looking at the rocks of Arran, smoked a cigar till my hour came,&#x2014;or rather till I tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> of running to a remote shop-counter and there writing you a Letter.&#x2014; However, we got safe out of it all; safe to Ardrossan, and on board the Irish Steamer; which sailed in about 2 hours after (near 11 at night), and proved to be an excellent Steamer, and under far superior management to the Victoria concern. I even slept in it,&#x2014;about as much as my average, when you are taking all the care a mother and kind Friends could of me,&#x2014;about five hours, namely,&#x2014;such a perverse creature am I. When I awoke we were getting into Belfast Lough; about six we got ashore at Belfast itself; and after much tumbling, I got adjusted for a Coach and Railways that would take me to Drogheda; walked about an hour up and down Belfast, and finally at 8 was fairly under way, with my goods all right (nothing lost but the poor old cap, which I think some of the younger shoeblacks had stolen,&#x2014;no great prize for him!)&#x2014;breakfast too, after a sort, had not been forgotten. And so till 4 o&#x2019;clock we rolled along, with much talk from all descriptions of people, gentle and simple, who were all more or less strange and entertaining to me; thro&#x2019; a beautiful day; thro various Towns, Newry, Dundalk &#x26;c; and drew up at last on the street of Drogheda, which too was all simmering with a <hi rend="italic">market-day</hi>. I ran over to the Post-Office, found <hi rend="italic">no</hi> Letter, or news of any kind, from</p>

<salute>Dear Spedding,</salute>
<p>You perceive by the date of this there is no possibility of Keswick for me this year! Finding the ly of matters there, and a great impatience in myself to be again under way and at last safe home, I sallied out (with terrible resolution!) by way of Ayr and Ardrossan; victoriously crossed to Belfast, victoriously took survey of Drogheda and various Towns, and have been here three days, with intention now of making off homewards with all dispatch tomorrow evening. I am full of petty misery, as in my travels I always am; but have seen many a strange Irish aspect of affairs, which will be a picture in my gallery for the future: Daniel O&#x2019;Connell in his green Repeal Cap, haranguing yesterday in Conciliation Hall,&#x2014;that of itself was a sight worth going some miles for!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >At their meeting, <date when="1846-09-07">7 Sept.</date>, Daniel O&#x2019;Connell made the main speech and his son Charles was in the chair. The meeting was chiefly devoted to attacking the Young Ireland party, whose support for physical force in the last resort was said to be &#x201C;not only bloody but treasonable.&#x201C; Daniel O&#x2019;Connell himself also gave his first reason for disagreement with them that they supported the &#x201C;infidel colleges bill,&#x201C; opposed by &#x201C;the holy church.&#x201C; He explained the govt. plan for relief, said that if there was &#x201C;no violence he would promise them food,&#x201C; and reaffirmed the demand for Repeal (<hi rend="italic">Times,</hi> <date when="1846-09-09">9 Sept.</date>; <hi rend="italic">Nation</hi>, <date when="1846-09-12">12 Sept.</date>).</note> Poor Daniel, Conciliation Hall and he <pb id="pg-21-47" n="21:47"/>seemed verging to their consummation, and not long for this world without a change! Young Ireland too is a strange entity; Ireland is all strange.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Duffy says that TC met members of the Young Ireland party, was &#x201C;pleased with some of them, and &#x2026; won their respect and sympathy &#x2026; We brought him to Conciliation Hall,&#x201C; and when he sailed home he left &#x201C;many enthusiastic friends behind. The relation of these young Irishmen to Carlyle was somewhat different from the relation existing between him and thoughtful young Englishmen. He did not teach them to think as <hi rend="italic">he</hi> thought, but he confirmed their determination to think for themselves&#x201C; (Duffy 22&#x2013;23).</note> But we shall meet to talk of it some day. In not many days or hours now I shall be at home if I prosper, right glad to <hi rend="italic">end</hi> these confused locomotions for a time.</p>
<p>I beg to be recommended to Mrs Spedding and the young Stranger, and the Baconian Philosopher, and all the kind friends that will grant me any tolerance in that friendly Household; and am ever, with much affection, and many regrets at my earthly disabilities,</p>

<p><salute>O my dear Jeannie, Jeannie,</salute> I am terribly ill off, and wish well I were beside thee at home again,&#x2014;as by Heaven&#x2019;s blessing I shall before long be! I am tired to death with talking and being talked to; have caught some cold, cannot sleep, am in the middle of confusions,&#x2014;&#x201C;surrounded by a friend (or two)&#x201C;! We had a large party here last night; Young Ireland almost in mass, and one Carlton (a Tale writer, a genuine bit of ould Ireland),<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Carleton.</note> and we talked, and dined, and drank liquids of various strength, and in spite of the profound quiet I could not sleep, and felt myself aweary, very weary! And have still another night and day of it before me, and a dinner at Mitchell&#x2019;s this day, and young Irish ladies of genius to see&#x2014;Ach Gott! But tomorrow (Wednesday) Evening, I do take flight, get on board the Liverpool Steamer; and on Thursday morning am within 7 hours of you again. It will be a while I hope before there come any more travelling for me: it may be profitable, but pleasant it by no means is. But I did see Dan yesterday in his green Cap, the Prince of Humbugs; Conciliation Hall and other unforgettable sights I have seen: of which there will be speech when we meet.</p>
<p>Whether to go along by Manchester, and carry it too with me, or to <pb id="pg-21-48" n="21:48"/>hasten off direct by Liverpool, home as fast as I can fly,&#x2014;that must depend on the turn this <hi rend="italic">cold</hi> takes; I rather think it cannot easily mend before that date. But you shall hear; I will write before that:&#x2014;or if I write nothing, consider only that I have been hustled out of it by one confusion or another; and that before long I will appear in person to give account of my ways. Meanwhile you have written for me to Liverpool? Take care of your Little Self for my sake; and be good to me, be not estranged and bad!</p>
<p>Duffy is the hospitablest of landlords; this is quiet country too, and a strange half-interesting Irish scene of things: one might do better in it if one had not cold, if one could sleep. &#x201C;Tare and ages!&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unexplained.</note> Ah me!&#x2014; <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, Dearest; Heaven send me soon home.</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Here I am, safe but very much wearied; and have, after study of the circumstances and the tired man, decided to <hi rend="italic">omit</hi> Manchester altogether; to stay here till tomorrow afternoon, <hi rend="italic">sleeping</hi> what I can, and then proceed direct <hi rend="italic">home</hi>, at 4&#xBD; o&#x2019;clock by the Express Train, which will land me at home before midnight; and so if I prosper, happily <hi rend="italic">end</hi> these journeyings. Of which issue I shall be very glad.</p>
<p>Tell my dear Mother the Papists have not hurt me in the least; on the contrary they were abundantly and over-abundantly kind and hospitable to me; and many a rough object has been put into my head which may usefully <hi rend="italic">smooth</hi> itself for me some day.</p>
<p>Not a word more at present. I will write again the day after I get home. I send my blessings and affections to you all, and am ever</p>
<closer><salute>Your affectionate /</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name>
<ps><p>Alick Welsh is away, and I have his room, and mean to sleep in it a good part of the <hi rend="italic">day</hi> as well as night. Our good Landlord<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Welsh.</note> is tolerably well and brisk; says you owe him his revenge for 4/6 won at whist. I will attend to your commissions <hi rend="italic">straightway</hi> at Chelsea.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Carlyle had written, <date when="1846-09-04">4 Sept.</date>: &#x201C;When you get back to London, if the task be not disagreeable to you, perhaps you could speak to some of the booksellers you know &#x26; ascertain from them whether they would venture to publish a literal prose translation of Dante with the Italian text and a short Life prefixed with some account of the times of Dante; &#x26; to give any thing for it. I should like to have done with the business in one way or another. If I had some clear task I should soon get out of the sensitive inflammatory mood in which I have been for some time past &#x26; ought to be as you justly remarked.&#x201C;</note></p></ps>

<p><salute>Dearest,</salute> Here I am, with a wretched headache; not in good case at all; very glad only that I am so much nearer rest and home. Our Dublin Steamer got to Liverpool at <hi rend="italic">four</hi> this morning, no joyful speed for one of their passengers; I staid on board till six; then <hi rend="italic">had</hi> to go, and <hi rend="italic">awoke</hi> my kind hosts here before admittance could be had. My cold seemed rather better yesterday; but of course the 12 hours in the whale&#x2019;s belly has done it no good. All are well here; and blithe as possible to see me.</p>
<p>I at one time thought of going on direct this day either to Manchester or home; but find now that this will not quite do on any side: I have concluded therefore to stay till tomorrow 4&#xBD; o&#x2019;clock, and then to fly <hi rend="italic">home</hi>. Manchester I will omit. I have honourably finished my Dublin expedition; but with this <hi rend="italic">head</hi> it really is unreasonable to urge my poor body on a new enterprise,&#x2014;like spurring of an <hi rend="italic">un</hi>willing steed whose flanks are already bleeding! Alick is away; so that my staying will be quite handy. In fact if this Letter were off, I mean honestly to fling myself on bed, and go to sleep like a good boy.</p>
<p>You get this, I think, on Thursday <hi rend="italic">night</hi> (for I really <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> walk to the Post-Office with it); in some few hours more, by the Express Train, you may look for myself, and do the best you can with such a bundle of rubbish.</p>
<p>I have seen Paulet; excused myself to Mrs P. and Seaforth.&#x2014; Thanks, many thanks, for the little Note which waited me here, like one kind good-morrow to a weary heart amid so many noises that were less welcome. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Goody, not now for long!&#x2014;</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>In <hi rend="italic">Chambers&#x2019;s Edinburgh Journal</hi>, about two years ago or more, there <pb id="pg-21-51" n="21:51"/>was pointed out to me a <hi rend="italic">Letter</hi> bearing my signature, and addressed to a young Student, in reply to precisely the same question as yours.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1843-03-13">13 March 1843</date>; see <ref target="volume-16/lt-18430313-TC-UC-01"><sic>16:81&#x2013;83</sic><corr>TC to UC, <date when="1843-03-13">13 March 1843</date></corr></ref>.</note> The young Student had used the somewhat questionable freedom of printing this Letter: of which step whatever I might think, there was no doubt but the Letter (written I knew not and know not how, when, or to whom) was mine; and did express, at some length, and with tolerable exactness, my candid notion as to the matter inquired into. By a little exertion,&#x2014;at the utmost by writing to Mr Chambers himself if you think it worth while,&#x2014;I doubt not you may procure that Letter; and to that, for brevity&#x2019;s sake and to avoid repetitions, I will beg leave to refer you.</p>
<p>In general my decided advice is that you should read a great deal of &#x201C;History&#x201C;; that you should in all ways earnestly strive to make yourself acquainted with what does exist, or has existed, as <hi rend="italic">fact</hi> in this Universe,&#x2014;properly the one kind of knowledge worth a reasonable creature&#x2019;s attention, so far as I can see;&#x2014;and should exercise a very vigilant eye indeed against all that of &#x201C;Fiction,&#x201C; &#x201C;Poetry,&#x201C; &#x201C;Art,&#x201C; &#x201C;Fine Art&#x201C; &#x26;c &#x26;c, as we have it in these days, which is threatening to become, or has already become, a very mournful cloud-continent and realm of balderdash to many of us! I mean here what I say; and perhaps you will understand it better when you have thought of it, and experimented on it, longer.</p>
<p>In conclusion, let me repeat to you that noble sentence of the Gospel, true in all noble pursuits of man: &#x201C;He that seeketh findeth.&#x201C;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Matt. 7:8.</note> If he will <hi rend="italic">seek</hi>,&#x2014;Yes, forever Yes! But he must seek: he must not go stalking about with eyes open and soul shut, awake only in the <hi rend="italic">stomach</hi> of him: that is not &#x201C;seeking&#x201C;; there is no &#x201C;finding,&#x201C; with never so many guide-posts, in a search like that. May a good Genius guide your young hopeful ingenuities, and nerve you with the strength of a man to turn them to account in due time. For the Night cometh!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. John 9:4.</note>&#x2014;</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I must write you a word tonight, tho&#x2019; it is very late, and I shall have to be <pb id="pg-21-52" n="21:52"/>briefer than I wished. Your ingenious <hi rend="italic">Pill-box</hi> arrived duly; all safe,&#x2014;the medicine a little <hi rend="italic">flattened,</hi> the globules of it squeezed together somewhat, but not difficult to disengage again, and restore to their pristine roundness, and lodge in a fitter recipient. Many thanks for your attention. I have taken one of the pills every night since, without any marked effect hitherto; I mean to persist till we arrive at some clear conclusion on the matter; and am not at present without some hope in regard to it, greater than I usually have in such cases. Indeed I have done almost nothing but lie utterly asleep in body and in mind ever since my return, being truly one of the most wearied and foredone of mortal men; so that no medicine has a fair chance with me for some time.&#x2014; Alick&#x2019;s Letter came last <hi rend="italic">night</hi> (not <hi rend="italic">morning</hi>, as you expected); and was directly forwarded to Jean, by one Flemming, who came in the course of the evening, and had a Post-Office-close by his home.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henry Fleming.</note> Poor Alick seems to have been in a rather perplexing condition with his harvest work; but has again got handsomely thro&#x2019; it. I cannot but admit to myself that he seems to be doing, outwardly and inwardly taken together, much better there than was his wont while in this country. And one great advantage is, he has the prospect of improving as his family grows up about him, instead of worsening as would have been the case here. Your little remittance of money will evidently be of good service to him.</p>
<p>On Wednesday last, the first day I could muster free for such an enormous feat, I walked up to Moxon; made a statement to him of the Dante Project, with due diplomacy, keeping out all mention of <hi rend="italic">names</hi> &#x26;c: Moxon listened with respectful attention; evidently did not much like the speculation; flowed out into embarrassed windings; and at length, when I gave him opportunity, gladly <hi rend="italic">declined</hi> the enterprise. Of Moxon there was nothing more to be said. I told him it was merely a <hi rend="italic">question</hi> addressed to his commercial experience: and now he, for his part, had answered No. Next day I meant to go to Chapman &#x26; Hall; but loitered too long, was in fact too languid, inattentive to the flight of time; and did not get till today. Today I found little Hall at home, a most sharp adroit little fellow:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Hall.</note> I explained with all the clearness, sincerity and emphasis I was master of the character of &#x201C;my Travelled Friend,&#x201C;&#x2014;a man of sound intelligence, long resident in Italy, master of all the histories, commentaries and general literature of Dante; <hi rend="italic">acquainted</hi>, in fact, with Dante (I did believe) better than perhaps any living Englishman: to produce a <hi rend="italic">literal</hi> plain brief prose Translation, with minimum of of<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> sound clear commentary, English Text <pb id="pg-21-53" n="21:53"/>on one side, Italian on the other (the whole, as I have often explained my notion of it to you, which Hall also seemed to think was the only feasible thing): &#x201C;Would it do, or not?&#x201C; Hall tho&#x2019; he did not think the speculation a brilliant one, seemed not entirely averse to it; talked rationally enough; requested time to reflect and consult with his Partner. This of course I could not but yield him, &#x201C;for a few days&#x201C;; and so, with hopeful expressions on his part, we said good b&#x2019;ye.&#x2014; He suggested the great use there would be in your drawing up some more precise account (yourself) of your Plan; calculating what <hi rend="italic">size</hi> of a Book, Commentary, Italian and all, it would make; sending them a <hi rend="italic">specimen</hi> &#x26;c: this I too felt to be very reasonable: however, for the present, they are able to go on without it; and if they altogether decline, of course you need not for <hi rend="italic">their</hi> sake take that trouble, tho&#x2019; I should clearly recommend it otherwise. The <hi rend="italic">size</hi> of the Book, you can form a kind of estimate of, in a rough way, by counting the <hi rend="italic">lines</hi> of Italian verse, then the <hi rend="italic">words</hi> in a line of Translation and Commentary, and contrasting them with any known Book,&#x2014;a volume of the F. Revolution, for instance. So soon as <hi rend="italic">any</hi> new light rises, you shall have it. My decided impression is that there will be no ready-money got for the Book; but whether Chap<hi rend="italic">n</hi> &#x26; H. will take it on half-profit, I cannot with any accuracy guess. This, dear Brother, is all I have to say at present. If you were to write down fairly on paper <hi rend="italic">your own</hi> no-<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >NLS 524.68 ends here.</note> tion of what could and should be done by you to <hi rend="italic">Dante</hi>, with all these details I have recommended; and add a <hi rend="italic">Specimen</hi> (something like what a <hi rend="italic">page</hi> in the Book will actually <hi rend="italic">be</hi>, Notes and all),&#x2014; I certainly consider it would be of much advantage, whether in this or in future negociations about it. My own real wish about it is that you had the matter <hi rend="italic">wisely</hi> off your hands: and to this or any other issue you may prefer, I will do of course whatsoever lies in me.</p>
<p>And now good night. I do not send you the Introductions for Yorkshire now, because it is not good that such things should be of too <hi rend="italic">old date:</hi> but the instant you want them, speak and they are ready for you here.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Carlyle had requested, <date when="1846-09-04">4 Sept.</date>, &#x201C;letters of introduction for Lancashire or Yorkshire. There is Marshall at Leeds &#x26; a Mr. Fox whom you know at some other place. I merely wish to see their manufacturing establishments.&#x201C; He had apparently confused one of R.

He had hoped that TC was &#x201C;not working too hard &#x2026; You have a good store of life before you if you do not wear it down by over-work.&#x201C; He ended by inviting TC to &#x201C;come down to see me&#x201C; (Yale MSS). Forster enthusiastically admired TC in spite of many differences, disliking his style and disapproving his dictatorial manner. After TC&#x2019;s death he spoke of him as &#x201C;the greatest modifying force of this century&#x201C; (T.

<salute>Dear Fitzgerald,</salute>
<p>Your Letter finds me <hi rend="italic">here;</hi> where I have been for some ten days now,&#x2014;mostly <hi rend="italic">asleep</hi>, for I arrived in a very wearied state. There is therefore nothing to be said about any farther wandering, for a good while to come!</p>
<p>My Pilgrimage, so far as immediate improvement in health or spirits went, was none of the successfullest: I was dreadfully knocked about with one tumult and another; and indeed in the whole course of my journeyings, could find no place half as quiet for me as Chelsea, with an empty London behind it, now is.</p>
<p>After a couple of weeks in Lancashire, I went across to Scotland; saw rainy weather, rotten potatoes, brutal drunken <hi rend="italic">Navvies</hi>, and other unpleasant phenomena; went no further North than Dumfriesshire;&#x2014;at length, with a dead-lift effort, decided to pass over into Ireland, by Ardrossan and <pb id="pg-21-55" n="21:55"/>Belfast, not with any hope of profit or enjoyment at all, but merely to redeem a promise I had given in those quarters. For some days accordingly I did see a bit of Ireland; roamed over the Streets of Dublin, a little among the Wicklow Hales;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS; presumably for &#x201C;Hills.&#x201C;</note> saw Daniel in his green cap in Conciliation Hall (the hugest <hi rend="italic">palpable</hi> Humbug I had ever before set eyes on); listened to Young Ireland (with hope that <hi rend="italic">it</hi> might yet turn to something); regretted much you were not with me to look on all that;&#x2014;finally, by Liverpool and the swiftest power of Steam, had myself tumbled out here, and so winded up the matter. My Wife, who had not gone farther than Lancashire, was here to receive me a fortnight before: much improved in health she; I too expect to feel myself a gainer by these painful locomotions by and by. The thinnest-skinned creature cannot be left <hi rend="italic">always</hi> to sit covered under a tub; must be pitched out, from time to time, into the general hurlyburly, and ordered to stir himself a little.</p>
<p>From Moxon I heard the other day that Tennyson and he <hi rend="italic">had</hi> just been in Switzerland;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Tennyson and Moxon set out from London for Switzerland on <date when="1846-08-01">1 Aug.</date> and returned <date when="1846-08-31">31 Aug.</date></note> that T. was actually at that time in Town, his address unknown; Moxon was himself just bound for Ramsgate,&#x2014;undertook to send Alfred to me if he could; but has not succeeded hitherto. Thackeray I have heard of at Boulogne or Brighton;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thackeray is said to have sought solitude at the Ship Inn, Brighton, in <date when="1846-10-00">Oct.</date> or <date when="1846-11-00">Nov.</date>, to work on <hi rend="italic">Vanity Fair</hi> (G.

<salute>Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Exactly a week ago I wrote to you, about myself, about your Dante and <pb id="pg-21-56" n="21:56"/>other matters: as there was <hi rend="italic">some money</hi> in the Letter I partly expected to be certified that you had got it, but have heard nothing; however, I suppose it is all right.</p>
<p>Today Chapman called to speak farther about the Dante affair. I found him on the whole inclined to regard the enterprise as one that <hi rend="italic">might</hi> do: he said if the Translation fulfilled my description, it might become the <hi rend="italic">Standard</hi> work for Schools, Learners of Italian, and the small class of people who sincerely wanted to attain some knowledge of that subject. He proposed printing the Italian too with the English to face it, wanted much to know what quantity of <hi rend="italic">commentary</hi> there would be. On shewing him an Italian Dante, he decided that the work must be in three volumes. Answered farther (a most important answer) that he <hi rend="italic">would</hi> expect to have to give <hi rend="italic">money</hi> for the Copy;&#x2014;could not in the least say how much till he saw a specimen, till he accurately knew what the <hi rend="italic">size</hi> of the Book would be. As I perceived that he suspected Mazzini to be my man, I thought it good at this stage to name you directly to him, and undertake that you would correspond with him yourself on the subject. This seemed to be satisfactory to him, and he went away in a hopeful fashion.</p>
<p>You are therefore, if you think of persisting in the Enterprise, to get ready with all despatch a small Portion of the Book as you intend it to be; I think a <hi rend="italic">canto</hi> would be best, with the <hi rend="italic">Notes</hi> all added,&#x2014;at least in some way a tolerable estimate of the <hi rend="italic">quantity</hi> of Notes there may be; that so the <hi rend="italic">size</hi> of the Book may be known: he will then answer <hi rend="italic">what</hi> money he will give for your <hi rend="italic">Ms.</hi> if it suit him, and on the whole will try to make a bargain with you about it.&#x2014; In this state the negociation now stands waiting for you; I do not see what more can be done in it at present till you yourself intervene. As to the <hi rend="italic">quantum</hi> of money, my light is nothing but guessing and darkness: I should <hi rend="italic">think</hi>, some &#xa3;50 a volume might be what he would offer; I should be afraid, hardly more than this,&#x2014;but as you see I do not in the least know. The man talked hopingly about it on the whole; is a hardy rational man:&#x2014;in short as you want to get <hi rend="italic">done</hi> with the speculation by bringing it to the test of practice, I do not see how you can do better than prosecute this experiment. It seemed to be understood that you would now continue the negociation yourself, and I said expressly, Neither you nor I wanted him to take <hi rend="italic">my</hi> recommendation of the enterprise; but he was to decide about it by his own light, when once your specimen arrived:&#x2014;but whatever more you want me to do in it, of course I shall be very ready to attempt doing with all the skill I have. Let me hear from you at all events, as soon as you can.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >NLS 512.55, on quarto paper, ends here; and though NLS 512.56 is on a new sheet of different size and color, it is given here as if it followed, on the assumption that it is either a continuation or written at about this time. It does not start with an indented paragraph. There may have been a gap of missing pages between the two passages.</note></p>
<p><pb id="pg-21-57" n="21:57"/>I continue altogether stagnant here; still very <hi rend="italic">sleepy;</hi> and as quiet as I can manage to be. I feel very considerably <hi rend="italic">better</hi> than when I left you; Jane is very well indeed for <hi rend="italic">her</hi>, walks long distances, shower-bathes every morning, &#x26;c. I read silly Books; go out for exercise only; sit as silent as Bacon&#x2019;s Brass Head for most part.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The English philosopher Roger Bacon (<date when="1214-00-00">1214</date>?&#x2013;<date when="1294-00-00">94</date>) supposedly constructed a brass head that spoke.</note>&#x2014; Tomorrow we are to go and dine at the Wedgwoods&#x2019; with Miss Martineau, who (alas!) is here, and cannot be avoided! Happily she goes off &#x201C;to Egypt&#x201C; soon, and will not again bring Magnetic effluxes upon us for some time.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Through her enthusiasm for animal magnetism.</note>&#x2014; Rob<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Browning the Poet has suddenly <hi rend="italic">married</hi>,&#x2014;a Miss Barrett, <hi rend="italic">Poetess</hi>, who lay lamed on a sofa for many years, but is now suddenly on her feet again. Good people both: I heartily wish them as happy a pilgrimage as can be had.&#x2014;</p>
<p>Jamie I suppose has done with his harvest before now? We had no rain till two days ago, and now it seems over again.

<salute>Dearest M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Russell</salute>
<p>I write to you today on my own business&#x2014;tho meaning to write at any rate to announce my return to Chelsea&#x2014;without having been in Scotland after all! Alas! this year I absolutely had not courage for it!&#x2014;my stay in Lancashire did so little towards strengthening either my body or soul that I could not muster resolution for going further north. Another year perhaps I shall do better&#x2014; God knows I begin to lose faith sadly in my own capabilities</p>
<p>&#x2014;My chief object in writing today however is to ask once more about Margaret Hiddlestone&#x2014;is there any earthly chance of my getting her <pb id="pg-21-58" n="21:58"/><hi rend="italic">now?</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC had tried to employ her in <date when="1842-00-00">1842</date>; see <ref target="volume-15/lt-18421215-JWC-MR-01"><sic>15:231</sic><corr>JWC to MR, <date when="1842-12-15">15 Dec. 1842</date></corr></ref>, <ref target="volume-15/lt-18421228-JWC-JW-01"><sic>255</sic><corr>JWC to JW, <date when="1842-12-28">28 Dec. 1842</date></corr></ref>.</note> Helen is going&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">this</hi> time for certain&#x2014;and she could never have gone at a time when I should have been sorrier to lose her&#x2014;for her conduct during the last year has been quite exemplary. And so for once virtue is getting its reward&#x2014; A Brother in Ireland has been rising into great prosperity as a manufacturer of coach-fringe&#x2014;thanks to the immense consumption of it on the Railways&#x2014;he has now two hundred girls in his pay, and in point of money (if he tells the truth) quite a <hi rend="italic">gentleman</hi>&#x2014; He has never done anything for Helen hitherto beyond coming to see her for <hi rend="italic">a quarter of an hour</hi> when his business called him to London&#x2014;never given her to the value of a farthing&#x2014;but suddenly he is seized with a fit of brotherly love&#x2014;comes here last evening, and invites her to go to Dublin and be his housekeeper&#x2014;engaging that should he hereafter <hi rend="italic">marry</hi> he will settle an ample provision on her. Of course nothing could be done with such an offer but accept it. Helen cries about leaving me&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">but</hi> to be made a Lady of all on a sudden does not fall in ones way every day!&#x2014;for myself I am far from feeling the confidence <hi rend="italic">she</hi> does in this Brother&#x2019;s promises and prospects&#x2014;still I can do no other under the circumstances than encourage her to try this opportunity of providing herself an independent home&#x2014; And so all that remains is to look out for another in her place&#x2014; But before I stir a step further I must have another <hi rend="italic">no</hi> from Margaret for the idea of having <hi rend="italic">her</hi> for my servant some time has never left my imagination or rather my heart&#x2014; I think I told her formerly that she should have twelve pounds a year&#x2014;tea and all that found her&#x2014;and her expences paid to Chelsea.</p>
<p>&#x2014;You know how she is situated at present with regard to her children and every thing else&#x2014;and if you are already sure she will not come there is no use teazing her any more about it&#x2014;but if you have any doubt&#x2014;take the trouble once more to tell her my wish&#x2014;and hear what she has got to say to it&#x2014;</p>
<p>What a time of it people have in this world with one change and another! very sad for those who like myself are the slaves of habit.</p>
<p>&#x2014;Margarets children must be pretty well grown now&#x2014;by and by one might find them little places in London beside her if she came&#x2014; Long here at a distance from her children I am sure she would not like to be</p>

<salute>My dear <hi rend="italic">Susan</hi></salute>
<p>Do you remember saying to me when you were last here; &#x201C;should you ever have to part with Helen, and be in want of another Scotch servant; tell <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, and perhaps I shall be able to help you to one; for there are still good Servants to be got in Dundee.&#x201C; It is years since you said this, years since we have exchanged words with one another; but I now claim your assistance with as full assurance as if you had offered it yesterday: for I judge of your friendship by my own, and as time and absence have made no change in my feelings towards <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, I fancy that neither has any change been made in yours towards me, and that you are still as ready to take some trouble for me as every you were. If likings depended on <hi rend="italic">locality</hi> in this world poor mortals would have a sad time of it; seeing how those who like one another are drifted asunder and kept apart&#x2014;as much, often, as if they were dead for one another&#x2014;but where a <hi rend="italic">true</hi> regard has once existed I cannot believe that any &#x201C;force of circumstances&#x201C; ever destroys it. And so, as I have said, I calculate on your being still the same warmhearted friend I ever found you when our stars brought us together&#x2014; Even tho&#x2019; we do not write regular letters to state the fact&#x2014; Alas! of late years my letterwriting propensities have been sorely kept down by the continual consciousness of being grown into a sort of <hi rend="italic">bore</hi>. ever ailing&#x2014;ever depressed in spirits&#x2014;the consequence I suppose of that sort of nervous ailment&#x2014; What have I to tell any one that cares for me, which it were any satisfaction to hear?&#x2014; The only thing I could write to you which were not better unwritten would be just over and over again &#x201C;my dear Susan&#x2014;I often think of you&#x2014;and have the same affection for you that ever I had&#x201C;&#x2014;and <hi rend="italic">that</hi> I flatter myself you will always take for granted&#x2014;</p>
<p>But, for the practical business which now puts me on writing to you: you are to know that my poor little Helen has <hi rend="italic">not</hi> relapsed into drink again nor otherwise foresaken the paths of virtue&#x2014;on the contrary she has been growing, like wine, and a few other things, always the better by keeping. So that at no period of our relation could I have felt more regret at losing her. The only consolation is; that <hi rend="italic">she</hi> will find her advantage in the <pb id="pg-21-60" n="21:60"/>change&#x2014;at least one tries to hope so.&#x2014; A marriage you think?&#x2014; No&#x2014; Something even more unthought of has turned up for the little woman. She is going to be made a sort of a <hi rend="italic">Lady</hi> of! at least so the matter presents itself to her lively imagination! A Brother in Dublin has been rising into great prosperity as a manufacturer of <hi rend="italic">coach-fringe:</hi> thanks to the imme<supplied>[n]</supplied>se<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> consumption of that article on the Railways! He is now by his own showing a regular <hi rend="italic">gentleman</hi>&#x2014;so far as money goes!&#x2014;and has &#x201C;two hundred girls in his pay.&#x201C; He looks to <hi rend="italic">me</hi> a foolish, flustering sort of incredible creature&#x2014;but Helen feels no doubt as to the solidity of his basis&#x2014; Hitherto he has taken no charge of Helen beyond coming to see her for <hi rend="italic">a quarter of an hour</hi> when his business called him to London&#x2014;has never given her a farthing or farthing&#x2019;s worth in his life. But now he is seized with a sudden fit of Brotherly love and offers to take her to be the <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;mistress of his house.&#x201C;</hi> engaging that should he marry at any time he will &#x201C;settle a handsome provision on her&#x201C; Of course such an offer is not to be rejected&#x2014;and Helen, not without tears at the thought of leaving <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, has accepted it without further investigation&#x2014;and <hi rend="italic">I</hi> tho not without private misgivings could do not other than encourage her to accept. So there remains only to get her place supplied better or worse.&#x2014; One that is so suitable to me I do not expect to find, but I must go about the sorry business as judiciously as possible. I have written to a Lady in Dumfriesshire to enquire after a woman long connected with my family and whom I would like well to have&#x2014;as she was my Mother&#x2019;s kind nurse in her last illness. But this person has two little Daughters whom she could not bring along with her and will not I fancy be willing to leave. So not to waste time&#x2014;I write also to you, to ask if you know of any woman at all likely to suit me. You know what would be required of her&#x2014;to do every thing in a house that two quiet, philosophical people require&#x2014;she would need to be up to <hi rend="italic">cooking</hi> &#x201C;in its simplest expressions&#x201C;&#x2014;to washing&#x2014;and cleaning rooms&#x2014;and I should like her not to steal or drink, or fly into rages&#x2014;what is called &#x201C;a very good temper&#x201C; I am not particular about&#x2014;but <hi rend="italic">explosions</hi> hurt my liver which is bad enough at any time&#x2014; I give Helen twelve pounds a year&#x2014;tea and all that found her To a person quite <hi rend="italic">up to</hi> her work I would give the same&#x2014; Of course I should pay her expences to London&#x2014;only stipulating that if she left me <hi rend="italic">within a year</hi> whether by her own desire or mine <hi rend="italic">half</hi> the expences should be paid off her wages&#x2014;this not for the sake of the money of course&#x2014;but as a precaution, so far as it goes, against that love of change which Servants get put into their heads on first coming to London. I should engage her for the usual Scotch term of half a year in the first instance&#x2014;it would be too far to bring anybody for <hi rend="italic">a month</hi>&#x2014;as the hiring period here <pb id="pg-21-61" n="21:61"/>is&#x2014; So now I have stated the exigencies of the case and its practicalities to the best of my recollection and Can you do anything for me? I shall await your answer in full confidence that if you cannot, it will not be for want of good will <closer><salute>ever affectionately yours</salute></closer> <name>Jane Carlyle</name><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC&#x2019;s headnote in <hi rend="italic">LM</hi> 1:374&#x2013;75: &#x201C;This and the next four letters [in fact the next two, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi> 1:378&#x2013;88] give clear account of a sordid form of servile chaos in this house, and how it was administered by one who had the best skill I ever saw in such matters. Helen Mitchell, an innocent-hearted, very ingenious, but practically altogether foolish creature, had, by matchless skill in guiding of her and through knowledge of her Scotch character and ways, been trained to great perfection of service, been even cured from a wild habit of occasional drinking, and tamed into living with us, and loyally and faithfully serving us for many years. She was one of the strangest creatures I ever saw; had an intellectual insight almost as of genius, and a folly and simplicity as of infancy: her sayings and observations, her occasional criticisms on men and things translated into the dialect of upstairs, were by far the most authentic table wit I have anywhere heard! This is literally true, though I cannot make it conceivable; the &#x2018;beautifully prismatic&#x2019; medium that conveyed it to me, which was unique in my experience, being gone. / The history of Helen&#x2019;s departure, and of her unspeakable successor&#x2019;s arrival are clearly given in these following letters, and to me at present in spite of their mean elements, have the essential aspect of a queenly tragedy, authentic of its kind!&#x2014; T.C.&#x201C;</note></p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Your Letter came a few hours after mine had gone,&#x2014;next morning, that is. On reflexion, I decided <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to send this Estimate of Dante to the Chapman&#x2019;s; but that you should keep it till your Specimen Canto was ready, and then transmit the whole together. It will wear a more <hi rend="italic">independent</hi> air; and bring the matter before Chapman all in a piece, when the time comes. I think you ought to put your Notes, all but the very <hi rend="italic">short</hi> ones, mostly <hi rend="italic">behind</hi> the Canto (or even the volume?):&#x2014;if you could put them into the form of general <hi rend="italic">exposition</hi> in <hi rend="italic">front</hi> of each Canto (I mean, not as Notes at all), that would be much better. But it would be very difficult. In fact the difference between an ostentatious blockhead and a modest man of sense does very much appear in the matter of Notes! I have engaged that they should be above all <hi rend="italic">brief</hi>. &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Pauca verba</hi></foreign> [Few words]&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">The Merry Wives of Windsor</hi> 1.1; <hi rend="italic">Love&#x2019;s Labour&#x2019;s Lost</hi> 4.2.</note> is the most universal of rules.&#x2014; When you have got any way made, let me hear.</p>

<salute>Dearest Helen</salute>
<p>Two letters for one is a windfall that never came to me out of Maryland Street before&#x2014;and claiming double thanks&#x2014;for the <hi rend="italic">novelty</hi> of the thing as well as for its <hi rend="italic">generosity</hi>.&#x2014; I would have written sooner if I had had anything <hi rend="italic">pleasant</hi> to say: but to tell you that I was down at <hi rend="italic">Zero</hi> again, seemed a thing there was no haste about communicating&#x2014; C came home wearied and gloomy&#x2014;with no work to fall to&#x2014;nothing to do but ray out darkness on all <hi rend="italic">my</hi> human attempts at occupation or amusement&#x2014;and these alas! are never so energetic now-a-days that they should make any long stand against that sort of thing. C should have had &#x201C;a strong-minded woman&#x201C; for wife, with a perfectly sound liver, plenty of <hi rend="italic">solid fat</hi>, and mirth and good humour world without end&#x2014;men do best with their opposites. <hi rend="italic">I</hi> am too like himself in some things&#x2014;especially as to the state of our livers. and so we aggravate one anothers tendencies to <hi rend="italic">despair!</hi> But there is no altering of all that now&#x2014;nothing to be done but make the best of it&#x2014;which I candidly confess I am far from doing&#x2014;I do <hi rend="italic">try</hi> however to the best of my humble ability&#x2014;and having found small profit hitherto in mending and tinkering at my <hi rend="italic">soul</hi>, I am for the moment modestly directing my faculties to the repairing of my <hi rend="italic">body</hi>&#x2014;trusting that the soul may be ultimately reached thro&#x2019; that outwork. Every morning I take the shower-bath&#x2014;quite cold&#x2014;and three pailfuls of it! The shock is indiscribable! and whether it strengthens or shatters me I have not yet made up my mind! but at all events when I have taken it; I feel to have accomplished a very decided <hi rend="italic">act of volition</hi>&#x2014;and <hi rend="italic">that</hi> makes my <hi rend="italic">moral</hi> blood circulate a little; however it may be with the physical! Then I <hi rend="italic">eat</hi> all that ever I can and drink <hi rend="italic">bottled porter</hi>&#x2014;not so good as <hi rend="italic">yours</hi> by any means&#x2014;but tolerable&#x2014;and I <hi rend="italic">walk</hi> as if <pb id="pg-21-63" n="21:63"/>the Devil were in me&#x2014;and so, I fancy he <hi rend="italic">is</hi>&#x2014;six and seven miles in the day on an average! I also try to be &#x2018;neither <hi rend="italic">solitary</hi> nor <hi rend="italic">idle</hi>&#x2019;&#x2014;which old Burton recommends as the grand cure of &#x2018;melancholy&#x2019;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. the close of Robert Burton, <hi rend="italic">Anatomy of Melancholy</hi> (<date when="1621-00-00">1621</date>).</note>&#x2014; Still I must not put too much reliance on these laudable efforts.&#x2014; Whenever one gets into the self-complacent idea of being able to <hi rend="italic">put down Destiny</hi> by <hi rend="italic">one&#x2019;s own Deserving</hi>&#x2014;then, if ever, is one sure of being &#x201C;made to <hi rend="italic">eat dirt</hi>&#x201C;&#x2014;more of it than one has the power of digesting.</p>
<p>I was wondering one day what effect a great <hi rend="italic">practical</hi> misfortune would have on me&#x2014;for instance being burnt out of house and home and reduced to <hi rend="italic">work</hi> for my bread and twenty four hours after Providence kindly gave promise of gratifying my curiosity&#x2014;in a small way&#x2014;prepared as pretty a <hi rend="italic">little</hi> practical misfortune for me as one could have imagined!</p>
<p>Helen came with tears in her eyes and smiles on her lips to tell me she was going away! Never could such news have found me less prepared for it&#x2014;or less disposed&#x2014; Her conduct has been so exemplary of late that, I saw no more danger of <hi rend="italic">needing</hi> to put her away, and her attachment to me seeming greater than ever, and her matrimonial chances none to speak of, I had no apprehension of her going of her own accord. But Helen also, insignificant as she looks has <hi rend="italic">a Destiny!</hi>&#x2014;is liable to great Events!&#x2014;and what is most extraordinary of all is going to be an exceptional instance of <hi rend="italic">virtue</hi> really <hi rend="italic">getting</hi> its own reward! At least one hopes so!&#x2014; A Brother in Dublin&#x2014;a pushing sort of fellow&#x2014;has got into trade on his own basis&#x2014;manufactures <hi rend="italic">coach-fringe</hi> for which there is immense consumption at present on the Railways, and so well has he prospered (by his own showing) that he has now three hundred girls in his employment&#x2014;a <hi rend="italic">genteel house</hi> and plenty to keep it with! <hi rend="italic">Himself</hi> however (for I saw him the other night) remaining a particularly <hi rend="italic">ungenteel</hi> man. He never did anything for Helen hitherto beyond calling on her for <hi rend="italic">a quarter of an hour</hi> when his business brought him to London&#x2014;never gave her to the value of a farthing in his life&#x2014;tho sometimes asking her if she would like that he brought her a poplin gown!! &#x201C;Dont you wish you may get it!&#x201D;</p>
<p>Now however he is seized with a sudden fit of brotherly love and invites her &#x201C;to come and be his housekeeper and <hi rend="small-caps">Mistress</hi>&#x201C; and she has of course accepted at the first word&#x2014; I wish it may end well for her&#x2014;the man looks to me a flustery incredible sort of man&#x2014;and very selfish with the two black eyes set close together in his head!&#x2014; His conduct hitherto has been so unbrotherly!&#x2014;that I cannot help fancying he merely wants a <hi rend="italic">good servant</hi> in Helen on his own terms&#x2014; Then he may marry shortly&#x2014;and turn her adrift&#x2014;&#x201C;tho he does <hi rend="italic">promise</hi> in that case to &#x201C;settle a handsome provision on her.&#x201C; but <hi rend="italic">will</hi> he?&#x2014; On the whole I wish for her own sake that Helen had <pb id="pg-21-64" n="21:64"/>taken a little time to investigate and reflect. It is not I however, who having a manifest interest in retaining her can urge prudence with any effect&#x2014;so go she must and take her chance. &#x201C;Poor thing, says C, perhaps she may get married to some decent man in Dublin and become Mother &#x2018;of a mighty nation&#x2019;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Gen. 18:18.</note>&#x2014;the last part of the possibility I should think in the highest degree improbable! Meanwhile I have written in the first rush of the business to M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Russel to see if there be any chance <hi rend="italic">now</hi> of getting Margaret Hiddlestone&#x2014;also to Betty in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Betty Braid, JWC&#x2019;s old nurse; see <ref target="volume-02/lt-18230308-JBW-EA-01"><sic>2:306</sic><corr>JBW to EA, <date when="1823-03-08">8 March 1823</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-17/lt-18430912-TC-JWC-01"><sic>17:127</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1843-09-12">12 Sept. 1843</date></corr></ref>.</note> to ask if <hi rend="italic">she</hi> knows anyone to suit me&#x2014;and also to Susan Hunter (M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Stirling) in Dundee who once offered should I be in need to look out for me in that region&#x2014; <hi rend="italic">Somebody</hi> I shall get&#x2014; It will be a while any how before another can suit me as well as this one who has been with me ten or eleven years&#x2014;but as John Carlyle says &#x201C;there is no use in rebelling against Providence.&#x201C; You may believe I am rather unsettled for the moment&#x2014; Nor do I know more of our <hi rend="italic">own</hi> plans than when I left you&#x2014; Lady Harriet is not returned and nothing has been said about Alverstoke&#x2014; But all will arrange itself by and by better or worse&#x2014;and sometime either in winter or spring <hi rend="italic">you</hi> will come and help to cheer me up.</p>
<p>I had a letter from Jeanie on Saturday&#x2014;relating a horrid story of a boiling showerbath&#x2014; Certainly Maggie must in some previous state of existence have given serious offence to the Spirit of Fire! I never heard of any one so constantly getting scalded.</p>

<p>You are too impetuous by half! <foreign><hi rend="italic">Festina Lente</hi></foreign> should be one&#x2019;s motto even in <hi rend="italic">good-doing</hi>, while one lives in &#x2018;a co<supplied>[n]</supplied>ditional<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> world&#x2019;&#x2014; Else one is apt to run one&#x2019;s head metaphorically and literally against many posts.

For <hi rend="small-caps">him</hi>, it is not enough that the artist is young and &#x2018;handsome&#x2019; and in need of employment&#x2014;he must also be sure that he <hi rend="italic">can</hi> take likenesses before he would dream of sitting to him!&#x2014; He has already sat to a weariness&#x2014;with worst results!&#x2014;and he is not so indifferent as might be expected of a <hi rend="italic">Philosopher</hi> to having bad portraits of him hanging loose on society. Accordingly I have requested M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Hartman to bring some of his pictures to show us and then I will see more clearly what can be done for him<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably Carl Hartmann (<date when="1818-00-00">1818</date>&#x2013;<date when="1857-00-00">57</date>), German-born painter who had lived in London since <date when="1839-00-00">1839</date> and who was later to paint many portraits of English dignitaries.</note>&#x2014; For your sake&#x2014;and also, now that I have seen him, for his own, I will do whatever I can for him&#x2014;but I must do it <hi rend="italic">in my own way</hi>&#x2014;not in your breakneck-way which I can make no hand of&#x2014; He looks the image of <hi rend="italic">innocence</hi> and <hi rend="italic">modesty</hi> and ingenuousness&#x2014;much too <hi rend="italic">beautiful</hi> for my taste in men&#x2014; but that may be no objection with the generality.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Probably they are writing to you from Scotsbrig by this Packet; but it can do you no ill to get a little word from me too. I wrote you last from Dumfries, on my way hitherward, in a great hurry: this present sheet will signify to you that I am safely arrived. I was, as is usual with me when tumbling about in strange places (and poor old Annandale is now grown very strange to me), in a most confused bewildered and altogether suffering condition; body acting upon mind, and mind upon body, in a most sorrowful manner for me: but now I am a little rested again; and may at least tell you intelligibly what I have to say.</p>
<p>I went along by Ayr two days after that Letter; crossed from Renfrew-shire to Belfast in Ireland; went down the Coast there so far as Dublin; and after a few days, crossing to Liverpool, got home again; heartily wearied, and glad to <hi rend="italic">rest</hi> anywhere. Ireland did not rejoice me much. A sad country at present; bad husbandry; rags and noise and ineffectuality: from Belfast all the way to Dublin I hardly saw a dozen fields completely fenced. To a man on the Coach I remarked, &#x201C;What is the use of fencing at all, if this is the way of it? Leave one gap in your field, it is quite the same, surely, as if you had not put a thorn in it at all!&#x201D;&#x2014; The Potatoes, as you know, are totally a ruin, this year, there and everywhere. Nothing but sheer famine and death by hunger for millions in Ireland,&#x2014;had not the Government interfered, most wisely, and signified to the Landlords of the Country that <hi rend="italic">they</hi> would have to assess themselves, to look out for work and wages to these poor wretches of peasants and see that they did not famish. This appears to me the most important law ever passed for Ireland;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-21/lt-18460902-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1846-09-02">2 Sept.</date></ref></note> the beginning, I do hope, of a new time for that wretched land: I almost <hi rend="italic">rejoiced</hi> at the black Potatoe fields, which had brought it about; and bade the Potatoes &#x201C;Go about their business, then,&#x201C; since the loss of them was leading us a little towards justice and a better sort of food for man! In fact it seems likely enough the Potatoes <hi rend="italic">are</hi> done, not going to grow any more for us; which <pb id="pg-21-67" n="21:67"/>probably is the most important <hi rend="italic">revolution</hi> ever brought about in our time,&#x2014;for without them the working people <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> be supported on the old principle, and we must either perish or else improve. Indian Corn, I suppose, must be the substitute; we are trying to learn how to cook it so as to be palateable with flesh-meat, and shall succeed by and by. <hi rend="italic">Here</hi> at present it is selling at <hi rend="italic">two pence a-pound</hi>, being a rarity as yet!&#x2014; In Dublin I saw O&#x2019;Connell haranguing his beggarly squad in &#x201C;Conciliation Hall,&#x201C; too; perhaps the <hi rend="italic">most</hi> disgusting sight to me in that side of the water. He is sinking, however, I think; that is another good symptom.</p>
<p>At Liverpool, where my stay was brief, I made due inquiry about the Box for &#x201C;Bield near Brantford.&#x201C; It had actually sailed for Montreal, addressed to you as above: in no great length of time after this Letter reaches you, I hope you may have one from Montreal announcing that the Box has arrived <hi rend="italic">there</hi>, and telling you when and how to look for it at Brantford. The carriage was to be all paid: I hope they will attend to that. In the Box itself there was nothing of much moment to you except as a memorial from us; Jane and I packed it ourselves (very <hi rend="italic">full</hi> indeed) the day before I went across from Liverpool to Scotsbrig: a Pilot-coat <supplied>[and a]</supplied> Pilot-hat (very strange articles) for yourself and also for Tom; a clock for Jenny, ditto for little Jane (hers was one of big Jane&#x2019;s); some Books, and other sundries: you will receive them with pleasure for the sake of the feeling they convey. Inside is a tin coffer with a lock, which I thought might be useful to you as a repository for papers etc: it is crammed with various articles;&#x2014;and one (there, I believe) is a knife bought by Jane herself, which is a gift from her to <hi rend="italic">you. All</hi> the women things were bought by her; but this was with her own money, and destined as I say. There is nothing more that need be explained about the cargo, that I recollect of.&#x2014; Did you get the 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi> edition of <hi rend="italic">Cromwell?</hi> I sent a Copy for you thro&#x2019; Mr Greig, and another for himself: if it have not yet come, it almost certainly will by and by.</p>
<p>From Annandale I hear frequently, but nothing special the last time,&#x2014;except that our Mother had caught a little cold; which she has now grown very apt to do: Jack hoped his medical treatment would speedily bring her round again. She is still very fond of reading; wonderfully lively of heart, but growing perceptibly <hi rend="italic">lighter</hi> of figure; less and less able to encounter any hardship. Good old Mother! We <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> have her always; and we shall never see her like again! Jack has a kind of speculation about bringing her to Dumfries neighbourhood, to live with Jenny and occasionally himself; but I know not what will come of it; the project is in a very crude state as yet. Since my return hither, I have got something like a Bookseller&#x2019;s proposal for Jack&#x2019;s own enterprise which he has long been jumbling about with: I shall be heartily glad if it come to anything useful for the poor Doctor, who is sadly off for work in late times. We shall see. Jamie, they <pb id="pg-21-68" n="21:68"/>write to me, has got his harvest well in: an average crop or more, as crops go this year. The Millwrights have nearly finished his new Thrashing-machine. Poor old Calvert<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Isabella Carlyle&#x2019;s father.</note> is dead. All Annandale was full of drunk &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Navvies</hi>&#x201C; (Navigators, so they call them) working at the Railway: the most detestable set of savages I ever saw. Wages 3/6 a-day, and they <hi rend="italic">drink</hi> it all; drink even till their tools are pawned. The Annandale people who work there, do most a <hi rend="italic">little</hi> better; they <hi rend="italic">eat</hi> all their wages: hardly one or two of the whole squad are laying by any money against the evil day. One could only wish they would soon get <hi rend="italic">done</hi> with their job, and disappear out of one&#x2019;s sight.&#x2014; Dear Brother, I must now finish. We got your account of the puzzle you were in at harvest-time; and how nevertheless you succeeded in extricating yourself. Courage! I like the resolute patient manful temper you exhibit; there is more good in that than there can be evil in anything. Persevere, persevere; every day, if you keep your eyes open will make you wiser. I delight much to think of you labouring away among your <foreign>Bairns</foreign>, seeing them <hi rend="italic">grow</hi> around you in all ways. Tom will be a strong fellow now! Let him try if he can fill that &#x201C;P. jacket&#x201C;! Little Jane will teach us one day how to cook our Indian meal for dinner. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign> dear Brother. God&#x2019;s blessing on you all.</salute></closer></p>

<p>This <hi rend="italic">sounds</hi> the very thing for me; and my only fear is lest it should end in &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Don&#x2019;t you wish you may get it?</hi>&#x201C; So if the cook with the &#x2018;mortal disease&#x2019;&#x2014;poor thing!&#x2014;still at the end of the &#x2018;four days&#x2019; gives signs of recovery, pray engage this girl for me without another word about it. The Dumfrieshire woman I mentioned cannot undertake&#x2014;&#x201C;would have liked much to come but feels herself getting old and failed&#x201C;&#x2014;sorrowful feeling that!&#x2014;and so I <hi rend="italic">must</hi> have a stranger, and am not likely to get any more promising one than this one whose merits you give so clear and credible an account of. As to wages&#x2014;if by the blessing of Providence it come so far&#x2014; settle with her as you like. I dare say it is best to begin with a little less than I mean to give ultimately: that the additional pounds may be more acceptable <pb id="pg-21-69" n="21:69"/>when they come as a reward of good conduct. I did so with Helen. I believe there <hi rend="italic">is</hi> a sort of a Scotch church not far from here&#x2014;but whether it have <hi rend="italic">emancipated</hi> itself or hung on to the &#x201C;auld establishment,&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Whether affiliated with the Free Church or remaining with the Church of Scotland.</note> I am not able to say, but if <hi rend="italic">it</hi> do not suit her, I shall try to find her another that will, and she may always get to church once a day&#x2014;&#x201C;when nothing extraordinary have occurred to prevent it.&#x201C;</p>
<p>And now thanks, the heartiest thanks for your two letters&#x2014;even if this woman slip thro&#x2019; our hands, and you can find no other, I shall still have got much good of my application to you&#x2014;in the expressions of your unaltered friendship which it has given occasion for.

Now that you are once more in that dear old house where I first knew you, and where I can think of you so much more definitely than in the unknown locality of Dundee;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Before she married, <date when="1836-00-00">1836</date>, when she moved to Dundee, Susan Stirling apparently lived at 11 Hill St., Edinburgh, with John Jeffrey (<date when="1775-00-00">1775</date>&#x2013;<date when="1848-00-00">1848</date>; see <ref target="volume-17/lt-18430906-JWC-TC-01"><sic>17:116</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1843-09-06">6 Sept. 1843</date></corr></ref>) and her sister Elizabeth, his second wife.

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Many thanks for your new indications about Oliver&#x2019;s Lodging. I should be very glad to ascertain beyond dispute what his address was on his second visit to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-19/lt-18450524-TC-RC-01">TC to RC, <date when="1845-05-24">24 May 1845</date></ref>.</note> and will take an early opportunity of looking for the Book you mention. Perhaps, as you have noted the matter in your papers, it would not be very difficult for you, or for some of your friends, to give me the exact name of the Author, and some reference, if not to volume and page, at least to chap<supplied>[t]</supplied>er<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> or section;&#x2014;which would much facilitate the research in this confused Museum of ours. The Historian of the Gordons being once fairly heard on the subject,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably referring to William Gordon, <hi rend="italic">The History of the Ancient, Noble, and Illustrious House of Gordon</hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1726-00-00">1726</date>&#x2013;<date when="1727-00-00">27</date>) 2:568, where Cromwell is said to have lodged at Moray House on his visits.</note> it would then only remain to inquire on what evidence he (at the distance of about a century, it appears) grounded his assertion; and this well settled, all were settled, and a clear result attained as to this small matter. The reprint of Oliver&#x2019;s Letters has been published for some time; but I am still very desirous to glean up any indubitability concerning him, however small. Of his first Lodging, as you remark, there remains no doubt whatever: but with regard to his second, there did not, tho&#x2019; I kept a sharp eye all the while, any clear evidence at all appear in the contemporary documents, from himself or others; nay it sometimes rather seemed to me as if he might be writing from the Citadel of Leith than from the Canongate,&#x2014;as indeed there was a likelihood that way, while the Castle remained in his enemies&#x2019; hands. I shall be very glad to have it decided, if there still remain light for deciding it, in any way.</p>
<p>On the whole it often seems to me there is much need of a man of real insight, fidelity and industry, to overhaul the Papers and Evidences as to that Period which are still in existence in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>. Town-Council Books, Kirk-Session Records &#x26;c &#x26;c, there <hi rend="italic">must</hi> surely be many such things in existence,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; the stranger as yet can hear nothing of them. Of original Letters, it would appear by Hailes&#x2019;s little Book,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sir David Dalrymple, Lord Hailes, <hi rend="italic">Memorials and Letters in the Reign of Charles I</hi> (Glasgow, <date when="1766-00-00">1766</date>); see also <ref target="volume-18/lt-18441014-TC-DL-01"><sic>18:240</sic><corr>TC to DL, <date when="1844-10-14">14 Oct. 1844</date></corr></ref>.</note> there is great store; but these also seem to lie in a very dark state,&#x2014;unvisited by Intelligence, and therefore unintelligible hitherto. Which is perhaps a great pity!</p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I am just honoured by your Invitation to attend the Opening of the Edinburgh Philosophical Institution; which certainly I do esteem an honour, and should be very glad to profit by, if I could. Some weeks ago I was myself in Scotland; so friendly a message, had it still found me there, might well have tempted me to take advantage of it. But at present the distance, the impediments, the miscellaneous difficulties are too great; and I must, with reluctance, deny myself that satisfaction.</p>
<p>Let me beg you to express to the Directors my regret and acknowledgements; my assurances that none can wish better to their honourable Enterprise, or would more gladly promote the essential interests of it, should that ever lie in my power.</p>
<p>Surely such Institutions do contain in them an aim which is worthy of all encouragement from every one: if their methods and procedure hitherto are chargeable with any want of wisdom, they that are &#x201C;wise&#x201C; should come and shew them better! I suppose the day of plain speaking, instead of idle complimenting, in regard to that and to other graver matters, to be really on the advance;&#x2014;and in the meanwhile Experience itself, to men who clearly know their aim and strenuously endeavour after it, is by degrees an infallible Teacher.</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Tonight there has just come a mysterious little Note, addressed to yourself in your own hand, apparently from Oxford Street, and so far as one can guess by the feel, containing a small <hi rend="italic">key:</hi> what to do with it, except announce that it is here and will be kept safe, one does not know! Tell us if you want it, or rather <hi rend="italic">what</hi> you want with it at Scotsbrig or here, and we will instantly endeavour to obey.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-21-72" n="21:72"/>Jane had a Letter from you this morning. No news have yet come as to the Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> serving-maid whether we are to have her or not; but a few days will decide that; and directly thereafter the question of Jenny Park will come on, and hasten to settlement.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Edinburgh maid is presumably one mentioned in <ref target="volume-21/lt-18461000-JWC-SS-01">JWC to SS, [<date when="1846-10-00">early Oct.</date>]</ref>. John Carlyle wrote to TC, <date when="1846-10-05">5 Oct.</date>: &#x201C;I have received Jane&#x2019;s letter to-day &#x26; will answer it, as soon as Jenny has had time to consult her father &#x26; mother about the project of serving you in London.&#x201C;</note> Your <hi rend="italic">inamorato</hi> seems rather in a pickle, and one cannot augur much victory for him as matters look!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note></p>
<p>You did altogether right about the Chapmans and <hi rend="italic">Dante;</hi> I hope you will get some good deliverance soon: at lowest you may expect to have <hi rend="italic">done</hi> with the matter speedily, in one way or other; and that of itself will be something for you.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Carlyle wrote, <date when="1846-10-05">5 Oct.</date>: &#x201C;I send the first three Cantos of the Inferno &#x26; notes to Chapman &#x26; Hall by way of specimen, along with this. I have expressly told them that you have not seen the translation at all; that you could only speak of my general qualifications; &#x26; that your opinion could hardly be other than a partial one. They are therefore requested to decide indepen<supplied>[den]</supplied>tly of it. The brief notes cost me a good deal of trouble, but now that I have got fairly started I feel as if I could make enough of them. In case of their acceptance, I hardly suppose they will offer more than &#xa3;150 for the first edition; &#x26; with that I should be satisfied provided the subsequent property of the book &#x2026; returned to me.&#x201C;</note>&#x2014; I have just been reading Hunt&#x2019;s Labour on that same matter (<hi rend="italic">Italian Poets</hi>, which the Bookseller&#x2019;s sent me a while ago):<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Leigh Hunt, <hi rend="italic">Stories from the Italian Poets</hi>, 2 vols. (<date when="1846-00-00">1846</date>), pbd. by Chapman &#x26; Hall. Two-thirds of the first vol: is on Dante, with a biography and critical note and prose summary of the entire <hi rend="italic">Divine Comedy;</hi> there are verse trans. in an appendix.</note> his Translation, where he restricts himself to that, seems wonderfully felicitous, and much in the style I should like for you; but his commentary is little other than a <hi rend="italic">shriek</hi> at once lamentable and ridiculous. I certainly do <hi rend="italic">not</hi> think that this precludes a farther work on Dante for the English!&#x2014; You will have a great deal of trouble if the business go on; but I have no doubt you will strenuously front it, and doing your very best produce something <hi rend="italic">good</hi>. Brevity and clearness: these are the two poles of the enterprize; the cardinal qualities both of version and commentary. Let us hope the Booksellers will answer you <hi rend="italic">soon</hi>, and wisely. They are punctual fellows; and will endeavour to do it.</p>
<p>I am still very idle; doing nothing but read, read. I do not yet begin to grudge that nothing comes upon the paper; <hi rend="italic">paper</hi> is not always a symptom that one is making progress. I feel my head and heart, and whole life at present, too abstruse for anything but <hi rend="italic">silence</hi>. Dull Books, or even by chance not-so-dull: these are my best company for a time. What writing I am to do next, or whether ever any other writing, is very much a secret to me hitherto!&#x2014;</p>
<p>The Town is getting fuller again; but we see almost nobody still,&#x2014;at least nobody to speak of. Yesternight there came a bevy of Americans from <pb id="pg-21-73" n="21:73"/>Emerson; one Margaret Fuller the chief figure of them: a strange <hi rend="italic">lilting</hi> lean old-maid, not nearly such a bore as I expected: we are to see them again.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sarah Margaret Fuller (<date when="1810-00-00">1810</date>&#x2013;<date when="1850-00-00">50</date>), American critic, feminist, and social reformer; see <ref target="volume-13/lt-18411231-TC-TB-01"><sic>13:332</sic><corr>TC to TB, <date when="1841-12-31">31 Dec. 1841</date></corr></ref>. Emerson had written to TC, <date when="1846-08-01">1 Aug.</date>, saying that TC should &#x201C;not fail to give a good &#x26; faithful interview to this wise, sincere, accomplished &#x26; most entertaining of women,&#x201C; and that he wished &#x201C;to bespeak Jane Carlyle&#x2019;s friendliest ear to one of the noblest of women. We shall send you no other such.&#x201C; Emerson also sent a formal letter of intro., <date when="1846-08-01">1 Aug.</date>, and wrote, <date when="1846-07-31">31 July</date>, that since Bronson Alcott there was no one &#x201C;whom I so much desired that you see &#x26; like.&#x201C; He explained that, at their invitation, she was traveling with Rebecca and Marcus Spring of New York, a merchant of &#x201C;moral merits,&#x201C; who was also a Fourierist and admirer of TC. Fuller had been attracted to studying German in <date when="1832-00-00">1832</date> through reading TC and was not unknown to him, since in <date when="1839-00-00">1839</date> Emerson had sent TC her trans. of Eckermann&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Conversations with Goethe</hi>, in which she spoke of TC as Goethe&#x2019;s &#x201C;only competent critic&#x201C; (see <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390913-TC-JAC-01"><sic>11:184</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1839-09-13">13 Sept. 1839</date></corr></ref>). She had already reviewed <hi rend="italic">Heroes and Hero-Worship</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Dial</hi> 2 [<date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>]: 131&#x2013;33) and <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> (<hi rend="italic">New York Tribune</hi>, <date when="1845-12-18">18 Dec. 1845</date>), praising the latter as &#x201C;entertaining, witty, dramatic, picturesque&#x201C; but setting herself down as one of the &#x201C;disgusting rose-water philanthropists&#x201C; who preferred to keep to the old &#x201C;&#x2018;Philistine&#x2019; &#x2026; &#x2018;Imbecile&#x2019;&#x201C; view of Cromwell. Fuller wrote to Emerson, <date when="1846-11-16">16 Nov.</date>, about their meeting on this date: TC &#x201C;was in a very sweet humor, full of wit and pathos, without being overbearing or oppressive &#x2026; The hearty noble earnestness of his personal being brought back the charm which once was upon his writing, before I wearied of it. I admired his Scotch, his way of singing his great full sentences, so that each one was like the stanza of a narrative ballad. He let me talk a little now and then, enough to free my lungs, and change my position, so that I did not get tired.&#x201C; She gave an account of his talk, praising a witty description of someone that &#x201C;was enough to kill one with laughing.&#x201C; She was invited to dinner with the Carlyles, probably <date when="1846-10-14">14 Oct.</date>, since she wrote to TC, <date when="1846-10-13">13 Oct.</date>: &#x201C;I hasten to say how glad we shall be to come and see you tomorrow. Were I only nearer your house I should like to come in, now &#x26; then, to see if you had an hour disengaged, but the distances are so great, one cannot find time to disturb anybody very much.&#x201C; At the dinner she met G. H. Lewes, who was occasionally allowed &#x201C;to interrupt Carlyle, a little,&#x201C; which pleased her, since TC was &#x201C;acrid&#x201C; and &#x201C;wearisome,&#x201C; especially in speaking about poetry, when he showed &#x201C;the defects in his own mind&#x2014;&#x2014; To interrupt him is a physical impossibility&#x2014;&#x2014; The latter part of the evening, however, he paid us for this, by a series of sketches, in his finest style, of railing and raillery of modern French literature.&#x201C; She also talked with JWC and liked her &#x201C;very much;&#x2014;she is full of grace, sweetness, and talent. Her eyes are sad and charming&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">The Letters of Margaret Fuller</hi>, ed. R. N. Hudspeth [Ithaca, N.Y., <date when="1987-00-00">1987</date>] 4:246&#x2013;48). JWC evidently wrote about her to Geraldine Jewsbury, who replied, <date when="1846-10-19">19 Oct.</date>: &#x201C;As to that Miss &#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;, I loathe her heartily from your description. I have no patience with theoretical profligacy&#x2014;&#x2014; She must be, and cannot help but be, a hypocrite, &#x2026; and yet keeps herself strait-laced up in practice to keep in with Emerson &#x26; Co.!&#x201D; (Ireland 215).</note>&#x2014; Miss Martineau was here, and is gone,&#x2014;to Norwich, after which to Egypt. Broken into utter wearisomeness: a mind reduced to these three elements, Imbecillity, Dogmatism and unlimited Hope. I never in my life was more heartily bored with any creature.&#x2014; Anthony Sterling has been taking himself <hi rend="italic">a Farm;</hi> country-quarters for himself and John&#x2019;s children (permanent quarters for them, incidental for him): down in Surrey, not far from Leatherhead; by accounts a fine house and place. Old Sterling, poor man, is getting worse and worse.</p>
<p>We have made continued experiments on <hi rend="italic">Indian Meal;</hi> have <hi rend="italic">settled</hi> upon it, and today bought <hi rend="italic">two stones</hi>,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; at an extravagant rate, of 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi> a-pound! Jane cooks it thus: makes it first into porridge like oatmeal, <hi rend="italic">then</hi> <pb id="pg-21-74" n="21:74"/>boils it in <hi rend="italic">a bag for four or five hours:</hi> this makes a really eatable article; and the <hi rend="italic">more</hi> boiling it gets, it seems the better.&#x2014; We also got a small loaf of bread from Indian meal today: very yellow and strange, but not unpleasant to eat, tho&#x2019; much inferior to good wheaten bread. The nutritive virtue of this grain, I hear, is about equal to that of oats weight for weight,&#x2014;rather <hi rend="italic">inferior</hi> if anything; and stands to that of wheat as 10 to 15. It is therefore out of all proportion <hi rend="italic">dear</hi> at its present London price; but we understand it will fall to about <hi rend="italic">one</hi> penny a-pound by and by.&#x2014; Being on Statistics I may mention another thing to you,&#x2014;as to &#x201C;Railway Shares&#x201C; on which we were speaking once. The railway Paper (scrip, or whatever they call it) now in the market over all England is less in value than the same Paper this time twelve month, by a sum of 60 millions,&#x2014;says the <hi rend="italic">Times!</hi> There are 8 millions of loss in the City of Exeter alone!<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A series of letters on railway finances, signed Cato, had recently been appearing in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>. At Exeter investors would have put money into the Great Western Railway.</note> Foul may care.&#x2014;</p>
<p>I wrote a Letter to Alick by the last Steamer; told him my last news of you all.&#x2014; My dear Mother, you must keep out of cold and winter wet;&#x2014;do, you cannot stand that now! I am very much relieved to hear that she is out of that attack; but her readiness to catch such injury is a sad thing. I wish with all my heart there were some way of taking better care of her! Our good old Mother, surely it well behoves us all to return the care she faithfully bestowed on us, so far as we can!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Jane joins with me in affectionate regards to her, to Jamie and Isabella, and you all. We too have rain enough here, and winter clearly announcing that it is under way. <closer><salute>Good night.</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Marshall,</salute>
<p>There is a young Physician here, an Aberdeen man about thirty, whom I have sometimes called my &#x201C;Scotch Rhinoceros&#x201C;; a man really of singular capability for work, and at present in great need of finding some;&#x2014;concerning whom I have decided to write a line to you. Dr Christie (that is his name) was recommended to me, some two years ago, for the copying of old Manuscripts, searching among old Pamphlets, and other confused labour, in the British Museum. He worked with me for a good while at that time, and has done so, off and on, ever since,&#x2014;in tasks quite new and foreign to <pb id="pg-21-75" n="21:75"/>him: so that I have had good opportunity to know him on all sides; and on the whole can pronounce my decided conviction that he is a man of real natural worth, real natural intelligence, simplicity and energy; fit for any kind of work in which such qualities, aided by constant patience and good sense, can avail,&#x2014;as I believe you will admit they do avail in most kinds of &#x201C;work.&#x201C;</p>
<p>Christie&#x2019;s education, as you observe, has been medical; and all manner of Degrees and Diplomas Scotch and English, and the testimonies of Sir James Clark and others (who take much interest in him) will testify that he has learned that business well:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sir James Clark (<date when="1788-00-00">1788</date>&#x2013;<date when="1870-00-00">1870</date>; <ref target="volume-21/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/5463"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), physician; see <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380830-JWC-TC-01"><sic>10:159</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1838-08-30">30 Aug. 1838</date></corr></ref>.</note> and on the whole I believe, on evidence that satisfies my own rather skeptical notions on that subject, that the man can actually afford good help and solace to human disease where he meets it; and is really an expert Doctor, likely to become very expert if longer experience were added. But this is by no means his only qualification. From this down to keeping a School (for he is a tolerable university scholar too)&#x2014;to keeping of a School or a Ledger, or being a &#x201C;Policeman on a railway&#x201C; (which I am told is the lot of <hi rend="italic">Seven Doctors</hi> on the Great Western at present),&#x2014;in any kind of honest work where cheerful strength and intelligence and fidelity were the conditions, I should augur well of Christie. A rugged simple humble man with an incurable rusticity of manner (<hi rend="italic">rusticity</hi> and <hi rend="italic">simplicity</hi>, by no means silliness or rudeness),&#x2014;and with a power of work in him, which it is very sorrowful to see imprisoned in this manner. For he is now at very low ebb; and would gladly welcome any tolerable work on cheap terms, especially any medical or intellectual work:&#x2014;after various efforts, <supplied>[on]</supplied> the part of friends and himself, which have all without blame of his, mis<supplied>[sed,]</supplied> there is nothing in the least satisfactory, or of any permanency, found for him here to do.</p>
<p>In the North Country, the country especially of work, and where the gold can be known even without the stamp, and a rustic Aberdeen manner does not condemn a man,&#x2014;is there nobody to whom in any way this Christie could be of use? It seems to me if a Master-Worker were seeking medical or moral or any kind of miscellaneous help to a Body of Workers, this Christie might be well worth &#xa3;150 a-year to him. Decidedly he might go farther and pay dearer, and find a worse man!&#x2014; Alas, that men should be perishing for want of work, and the world and its work be perishing for want of men, all the while,&#x2014;this seems to me one of the saddest considerations!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Well, I will request you to turn this over in your mind, and apply it to the circle of affairs round you. I have written in great haste; but will<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> all the <hi rend="italic">veracity</hi> I could: I hope you catch some outline of the real fact from these <pb id="pg-21-76" n="21:76"/>hurried strokes; if there be any chance of the least help in your power for this sad case, I am persuaded you will be right glad to employ it for me. And so I leave it with you. After a due survey of the matter, in itself and in its relations, you will write me a word about it by and by.</p>
<p>What a time since I have seen or heard of any of you! I know not how it has come. I have been very busy, sometimes very dark and secluded; but of old Friends by no means forgetful! I hope we shall meet before long, and somewhat oftener for the future.</p>

<p>Accept my kind thanks for your Excerpt from the Holton Register; which becomes a really luminous little scrap of writing, when set in its due combination; and was well worth copying, and preserving for a new edition.</p>
<p>Ireton&#x2019;s marriage, I find, took place just when the Siege of Oxford was about to end: <date when="1646-06-15">15 june 1646</date> is Monday, on the Saturday following, Oxford was surrendered.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For Henry Ireton&#x2019;s marriage to Cromwell&#x2019;s da.

The footnote indicating the source of the quotation does not mention Tyndale but says merely, &#x201C;copied, <date when="1846-10-00">Oct. 1846</date>.&#x201C;</note> There had been little fighting, but a great deal of negociating,&#x2014;a &#x201C;treaty&#x201C; extending from the <date when="1846-05-00">beginning of May</date>; and Ireton, I perceive, was one of Fairfax&#x2019;s &#x201C;Commissioners&#x201C; on that business.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Fairfax (<date when="1612-00-00">1612</date>&#x2013;<date when="1671-00-00">71</date>), 3<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> Baron Fairfax of Cameron, parliamentary gen.</note> As the end of that was now clear, and indeed the end of the whole war, Ireton had concluded that his marriage might take place.</p>
<p>As &#x201C;Dell,&#x201C; Fairfax&#x2019;s Chaplain, performed the ceremony, not to speak of other considerations, I guess with some confidence that Holton House, with its military resources, was then Fairfax&#x2019;s quarters: Oliver and other friends would bring up the Bride from London, to whom with others W<hi rend="italic">m</hi> Dell, the famed Puritan, would preach in your pulpit on the Sunday.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Dell (d. <date when="1669-00-00">1669</date>), once sec. to Laud, general&#x2019;s chaplain, and later master of Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge.</note> The <hi rend="italic">front</hi> of Fairfax&#x2019;s Lines ran from Headington to Marston, then across the Cherwell, and between that and the Isis, on the North side of the City; on the South and elsewhere, by a &#x201C;dam at St Clement&#x2019;s Bridge,&#x201C; the country was all under water. Ireton, as one of the Commissioners for surrender, was of course <hi rend="italic">near</hi> the City. &#x201C;The Lady Whorwood,&#x201C; I imagine, must have been <hi rend="italic">Mrs</hi> Whorwood; of whom elsewhere I find traces, in the Royalist direction.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >They were married, <date when="1634-00-00">1634</date>, in the home of the royalist Jane Whorwood, b. Ryder.</note>&#x2014; The little record in your Parish Register is well worth preserving!&#x2014;</p>
<p>The only thing still dubious to me is one of the smallest: a letter in the Rector&#x2019;s name (Ea<hi rend="italic">t</hi>es or Ea<hi rend="italic">l</hi>es?<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC gives his name as Alban Eales in <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 6:242.</note>); and whether the Rector, who seems to have written this particular Entry, wrote also the others that occur in the <pb id="pg-21-78" n="21:78"/>Book thereabouts? Or whether some Clerk did it; and in perhaps a different form from this? If you could have the goodness to copy me the Entry that precedes and the one that follows; or otherwise to satisfy me on this small point, it would very handsomely complete my obligation to you, and leave this little matter in a perfect state.</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>The Bookseller&#x2019;s Offer<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >From Chapman &#x26; Hall concerning John Carlyle&#x2019;s trans. of Dante.</note> turns out to be but a small matter! I had begun to dread in secret that it might result in some such issue: and here we see it is. No money in it at all; that is the real meaning; for as to the &#x201C;second edition&#x201C; &#x26;c, there is nothing but uncertain moonshine in that. I believe however, it is the real answer you will get from &#x201C;the Trade&#x201C; as to this enterprise which has hung before you so long: you have now the materials for deciding what you will do with it; and that is something to have. I wish from my heart I had means of advising you at all towards what would be your real good in the matter! But I have not: perhaps I could know what I myself would do in your situation (perhaps also <hi rend="italic">not</hi>, very clearly); but what <hi rend="italic">you</hi> yourself are to do is a question still wide of that! May you resolve <hi rend="italic">wisely</hi>, and what will be for your real advantage: my power is limited to that poor prayer. I have the Piece of the Translation; but do not send it till next Letter: I have not yet got it well examined.&#x2014; This enclosed Letter came for you a few hours ago.</p>
<p>Your friend at Keswick seems to be in a very sad way, poor fellow.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably Dr. William Lang, John Carlyle&#x2019;s fellow student at Edinburgh; see <ref target="volume-04/lt-18271020-TC-MAC-01"><sic>4:262</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1827-10-20">20 Oct. 1827</date></corr></ref>. John Carlyle placed an asterisk after the first word in this sentence and wrote in the margin: &#x201C;D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> L. who practised one year at Leamington &#x26; by a disease that has come upon him is now deformed to such a degree that he shuns society.&#x201C;</note> You do not mention whether you have any thought of profiting by his advice and interest, and taking up the vacancy at Leamington? The &#x201C;three Physicians&#x201C; <pb id="pg-21-81" n="21:81"/>already come thither are an element that will never fail in such a case: but I suppose you might elbow <hi rend="italic">them</hi> aside to a reasonable extent without any miracle in your favour.</p>
<p>I <hi rend="italic">was</hi> at Sir Ja<hi rend="italic">s</hi> Clark&#x2019;s, dining, the other night; he had been so very civil about Christie &#x26;c I could not refuse:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC had apparently asked Clark about employment for Dr. John Christie.</note> the <hi rend="italic">indigestion</hi> consequent thereon still hangs about me. He was very civil, asked about you and so forth; indeed I find him a very simple-hearted humane man, with far more <hi rend="italic">in</hi>articulate wisdom about him than any that comes out in the shape of speech. Forbes was there too; Dr Arnot and another; and the hero of the night was one Baron Stockman (?) a shrivelled shrewd little German, once a kind of Doctor I believe, who resides at Coburg, and hangs about Prince Albert and that clan, it would seem.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A. Carlyle identifies Forbes as the naturalist Edward Forbes (<date when="1815-00-00">1815</date>&#x2013;<date when="1854-00-00">54</date>; <ref target="volume-21/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/9824"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>). More likely it was the physician John Forbes (<date when="1787-00-00">1787</date>&#x2013;<date when="1861-00-00">1861</date>; <ref target="volume-21/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/9841"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), whom both TC and John Carlyle seem to have known (see Marrs 722&#x2013;23). He was a friend of Neil Arnott (<date when="1788-00-00">1788</date>&#x2013;<date when="1874-00-00">1874</date>; <ref target="volume-21/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/694"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), physician, who invented the smokeless stove which gave TC his phrase about &#x201C;consuming one&#x2019;s own smoke.&#x201C; Christian Friedrich, Baron von Stockmar (<date when="1787-00-00">1787</date>&#x2013;<date when="1863-00-00">1863</date>), formerly physician to and then private sec. and household controller and political agent of Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha. In <date when="1837-00-00">1837</date> Leopold sent him to be advisor to Queen Victoria and, subsequently, close counselor to Prince Albert.</note> We did well enough together; and I came home with my indigestion and the feeling of &#x201C;duty done.&#x201C;&#x2014; Christie is in sad straits just now, his Wife dangerously ill &#x26;c: but it is hoped a kind of Clerkship in the Albemarle-Street Institution may, by a dead-lift effort on all hands, be procured for him:<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Royal Inst., 21 Albemarle St.; see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18361229-TC-JCA-01"><sic>9:109</sic><corr>TC to JCA, <date when="1836-12-29">29 Dec. 1836</date></corr></ref>.</note> I wish to Heaven it were! For I am tired writing and soliciting about the poor man.</p>
<p>We <hi rend="italic">have</hi> to go off, on Wednesday, to The Grange (Alresford, Hants, Lord Ashburton&#x2019;s); are to stay for a week: one of the joyfullest things would be my landing safe home again; that is my real humour at present on it! I will send my Mother a Letter from that; a Parcel for her is already on the way towards Dumfries. <closer><salute>Affection to her and to them all. Ever Yours.</salute></closer></p>

Decidedly the girl had better steer clear of <hi rend="italic">joiners</hi> and rely on her own sense and Scotch tongue Please to tell me before the time what money she needs for her passage and I will send a post office order for the same to you&#x2014;in case she have none of her own.</p>
<p>I am glad you liked my dear old Betty<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Braid.</note>&#x2014;tho&#x2019; she did not wet-nurse me, I feel towards her precisely as to a nurse. Tell me what sort of looking person <hi rend="italic">my</hi> girl is, that I may not receive a shock at the outset from expecting something the opposite of the fact.</p>
<p>I am quite <foreign><hi rend="italic">dished</hi></foreign> today with want of sleep and want of quiet&#x2014; We are on a visit at Lord Ashburtons at the Grange beyond Winchester a beautiful place&#x2014;and the people are excellent people&#x2014;one of the family Lady Harriet Baring clever to death&#x2014;and one <hi rend="italic">ought</hi> to be as happy as the day&#x2019;s long&#x2014;but what avails all the beautiful scenery and upholstery&#x2014;magnificence and sparkling wit&#x2014;to a poor wretch who lies awake till five in the morning?&#x2014;</p>
<p>I wish I were at your fireside in Hill street for the moment&#x2014; <hi rend="italic">There</hi> it used to be so comfortable&#x2014;so free!

<salute>Dearest Babbie</salute>
<p>I have no prospect of being able to write you a deliberate letter even at this late date&#x2014; Tho, for the moment, I have not a room merely but a suit of rooms all to myself, where no one may come to molest me. still my soul is in a state of hurry scurry which makes <hi rend="italic">deliberate</hi> writing quite impossible.

And then the recollection of all the idle restless people under the same roof with me! whose idleness and restlessness is so <pb id="pg-21-83" n="21:83"/>contagious! In fact <hi rend="italic">this</hi> is &#x201C;a country house&#x201C; with a vengeance! and I do not find that my Destiny has done amiss in casting <hi rend="italic">my</hi> lot amongst &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">the poorer orders</hi>,&#x201C; We are here professedly on a visit to the Ashburtons <hi rend="italic">virtually</hi>, at least so far as C. is concerned, on a visit to Lady Harriet&#x2014;and besides Lady Harriet and M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Baring, there are some dozen visitors&#x2014;The marchioness of Bath Lord Ashburtons eldest daughter with two tiny Ladiship<supplied>[s]</supplied><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> and their French governess&#x2014;Old Rogers&#x2014;An Hon<hi rend="italic">bl</hi> M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Bing a beautiful Miss Dalton a rich M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Portal &#x26;c &#x26;c<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Harriet Thynne (<date when="1804-00-00">1804</date>&#x2013;<date when="1892-00-00">92</date>), dowager Marchioness of Bath; see <ref target="volume-18/lt-18441218-TC-LAAL-01"><sic>18:286</sic><corr>TC to LAAL, <date when="1844-12-18">18 Dec. 1844</date></corr></ref>.

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>There is nothing but haste, derangement, and confusion of all one&#x2019;s time and plans in this Establishment: so I must write to you with much more brevity than I intended; but if I do not write at all, you might think, after my promise, something bad had befallen,&#x2014;which I am thankful to tell you <pb id="pg-21-85" n="21:85"/>is not at all the case. Nay something <hi rend="italic">good</hi> has befallen: we found, this morning, on the big breakfast-table here, the Doctor&#x2019;s last Letter with good news from Scotsbrig and you, which was as welcome a message as could have arrived. Tell the Doctor I am much obliged to him, and will answer soon. In the meantime I think his decision about Dante altogether right, and was glad he had taken that view of it. The rest I will write to himself.&#x2014;</p>
<p>We got here; according to our project, on Wednesday; a nasty cold foggy day in London; here all bright and sunshiny as today again is (for we stand on <hi rend="italic">chalk</hi> soil which is averse to fogs): we found a large party here, a warm welcome (so far as any welcome in a place like this can be warm), and have been struggling along ever since amid the whirl of <foreign><hi rend="italic">flunkeys</hi></foreign> and general turmoil of things to do the best we could,&#x2014;not at all with bad success hitherto. Such a life for <hi rend="italic">long</hi> would be insupportable to me; but till <hi rend="italic">Thursday</hi> when it has to end we can make it do very well. Old Rogers (whom John will tell you about if you like) is here; and to me one of the most tiresome of men.&#x2014;</p>
<p>Dear Mother, the day before going off I sent you a <hi rend="italic">woollen gown</hi>,&#x2014;a nice bit of modest small <hi rend="italic">tartan</hi>, which Jane chose for you in the biggest London shop; she says you may wear it very well with a black shawl, and that it is very warm and very pretty. I sent it to James Aitken&#x2019;s care; I fancy it will be there now in a day or two. I wish you to get it made <hi rend="italic">well</hi>, by somebody that understands the job; and I will pay for it. Pray do that for me.&#x2014; Yes, dear Mother, surely I will send an autograph with right good will for your sake. Here it is!&#x2014; <closer><salute>Ever yours</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name></p>
<ps><p>I sent Jenny a Letter lately; and expected an answer, but have not yet got any.</p></ps>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Here, according to your request, is the Enclosure contained in your first Letter. My name stands in the Committee&#x2014;List of the London Library; but I do not take, and never took, any share in the management; and indeed in late years am rarely able to attend at all. I am very sorry you find the performance of the poor Institution so unsatisfactory. To me it yields, on the whole, tho&#x2019; by no means what I wished, yet some average approximation to what I hoped. The Committee, I believe, will readily listen to any <pb id="pg-21-86" n="21:86"/>practicable suggestion; and the poor Librarian,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >J. G. Cochrane.</note> with all his defects, is a most obliging good-natured man, eminent for patience, cheerfulness <hi rend="italic">and bibliography</hi>, who will rejoice to do for any member, still more for any member like you, whatsoever is really in his power.</p>

<p>I am just returned from the Grange&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">that</hi> is <hi rend="italic">one</hi> good job over&#x2014;and I may calculate now on being let alone till after Christmas&#x2014;so I write to urge with all solemnity that you should <hi rend="italic">immediately</hi> fling some clothes into a trunk and come off to me. The programme is that after Christmas we shall go for a month to Bay House where we were the last year S<hi rend="italic">o</hi> the Lady Harriet wills <hi rend="italic">at present</hi>&#x2014;and her Ladyships will is become the law of this house!&#x2014;even her <hi rend="italic">whims</hi> are as imperative as the ten commandments!&#x2014; In <date when="1847-03-00">March</date> she will be at Addiscombe&#x2014;only twelve miles from here&#x2014;and if she wish us to amuse her <foreign>ennui</foreign> there also of course; it will be so arranged&#x2014;then in <date when="1847-04-00">April</date> what Darwin calls &#x201C;the 5 Cheyne-Row-spring-fever&#x201C; begins&#x2014;frantic speculations about where to go&#x2014;&#x26;c &#x26;c. So that it seems to me on the whole, there is no time so good as the present. We have six clear weeks till Christmas&#x2014;if you start immediately you may have a tolerable view of London in that time&#x2014; So let me have a letter by return of post to say what day you will be here&#x2014;the journey is the simplest thing in nature&#x2014;nothing in the shape of <hi rend="italic">escort</hi> need be waited for. You have only to bid a Policeman at the station get you a cab&#x2014;(meeting people is <hi rend="italic">impossible</hi> in Euston Square) and you will be fetched safe here without a word spoken&#x2014; I am too much occupied with the prospect of seeing you to enter into any detail of my visit&#x2014;it was <hi rend="italic">grand</hi> to Death!&#x2014;people with eighty thousand a year can <hi rend="italic">afford</hi> to do things in style&#x2014; I will tell you things that will amuse you when we meet&#x2014;</p>
<p>Helen does not go till the 20<hi rend="italic">th</hi> when I expect a new woman from Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>&#x2014;but the change will not put <hi rend="italic">you</hi> about&#x2014;who are used to changes&#x2014; Say to my Uncle that I bought with his five pounds a beautiful plaid shawl, boa, and fur cuffs&#x2014;a whole equipment for winter!</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Here is your specimen of <hi rend="italic">Dante</hi>, which I have read over with attention; I find it anxiously faithful and literal, with here and there a gleam of strange poetical significance;&#x2014;I suppose, in short, very fairly done on your part. But it is terribly abstruse; perplexed, obscure and indeed unintelligible to a modern English reader! I do not see how a serious man of the nineteenth century could often consent to risk his time in the guessing of such obsolete riddles: any general popularity or interest for such a Book appears to me impossible. In its present form I believe the Chapmans and you too are as well <hi rend="italic">quit</hi> of it To bring the message of Dante home again to a modern ear,&#x2014;of which enterprise I cannot very accurately estimate the benefit,&#x2014;some other more cunning plan would be required. Perhaps you will persist; perhaps you will give it up as a game not worth the candle? In very literal truth I cannot advise you;&#x2014;alas, most worthless barren &#x201C;wishes&#x201C; are all I can give you! Dante, at present and probably for long generations hence, must remain the property of the Travelling Dilettante mainly; the sorrowfullest brood of mortals this Sun ever saw!&#x2014;</p>
<p>We do not find it unnatural or improper that you should eschew Leamington,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-21/lt-18461025-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1846-10-25">25 Oct.</date></ref></note>&#x2014;that now and henceforth you should decline all such confused dangerous adventures, for which in your circumstances there really is no adequate motive or incitement. If you had a house and reasonable establishment to live in anywhere, <hi rend="italic">there</hi> you could on your own footing practice what medicine you pleased, and do the work you found in you with total independance<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> on all the conditions of it which are so disagreeable to your feelings. In real earnest, that might be the best way for you.&#x2014; Here also I have no power to help or to advise; alas, none at all.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-21-88" n="21:88"/>We got home again on Thursday afternoon: I found the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> still lying open, and addressed it to you for a kind of sign. Our visit was to a beautiful house and country and very kind people; we had some days even of bright sunshine, and the brown leaves are still very copiously sticking to the trees: but on the whole it was to me with my dyspepsias and insomnolences other than a pleasure; a strange nightmare of smoke and flame, and indigestion and donothingism,&#x2014;which I was very willing indeed to see <hi rend="italic">end</hi>. We had many people there; nearly all insignificant except by their manners and rank. Old Rogers staid the longest, indeed as long as ourselves; I do not remember any old man (he is now 83) whose manner of being gave me less satisfaction! A most sorrowful distressing distracted old phenomenon; hovering over the rim of deep Eternities with nothing but light babble, fatuity, vanity, and the frostiest London with in his mouth! Sometimes I felt as if I could throttle him, the poor old wretch; but then suddenly I reflected, &#x201C;It is but for two days more. Pity the sorrows of a poor old man!&#x201D; Lady Harriet lived mostly in her own apartments, dined at another hour than we; and except at breakfast and tea did not much appear. Lady Bath was there; an airy, imaginative Puseyite lady,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Someone of Anglo-Catholic views.</note>&#x2014;unsubstantial to the touch as rainbows. On Thursday happily it ended; and I got to my own bed again, and to my own dinner of mutton-chop and American <hi rend="italic">much</hi>. We are engaged to Alverstoke &#x201C;after Christmas for a month&#x201C;; but I consider it problematical if we shall go. Silence is better than most speech; mush and chop of one&#x2019;s own, how preferable to champagne dinners with plate-services and a regiment of valets! Often did the prayer of Agur come to my mind, and thanks that to me also it had been granted, &#x201C;Give me neither poverty nor <hi rend="italic">riches</hi>; feed me with food convenient for me!&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Prov. 30:8.</note>&#x2014;</p>
<p>We are coming now to need the Scotsbrig <hi rend="italic">Butter;</hi> also a small supply of oatmeal, but I cannot yet say how much. Lady Ashburton wants &#x201C;about 3 stones,&#x201C;&#x2014;they eat cakes, and good meal is not known here. At Alverstoke too perhaps some may be wanted, perhaps <hi rend="italic">not:</hi> we ourselves want little, not altogether <hi rend="italic">none:</hi> in a few days I will write to Jamie some express request; in the mean time, let the Satur Miller do his <hi rend="italic">best</hi>, and have a small batch ready such as he can set before the King!&#x2014; Thomas Erskine has come to Town from Italy; we have just heard from him, in Baker Street; under the surgeons still. Last night, a weary tea with the American Marg<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Fuller and Mazzini,&#x2014;not to be repeated!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Margaret Fuller, who admired Mazzini, had sought him out in London and written enthusiastically about him in one of her early letters from Europe to the <hi rend="italic">New York Tribune</hi>. Mazzini was with her when the Carlyles called, <date when="1846-11-07">7 Nov.</date> She wrote to Emerson, <date when="1846-11-16">16 Nov.</date>: &#x201C;I only saw them once more. &#x2026; Unluckily, Mazzini was with us, whose society, when he was there alone, I enjoyed more than any. He is a beauteous and pure music; also, he is a dear friend of Mrs. C.; but his being there gave the conversation a turn to &#x2018;progress&#x2019; and ideal subjects, and C. was fluent in invectives on all our &#x2018;rose-water imbecilities.&#x2019; We all felt distant from him, and Mazzini, after some vain efforts to remonstrate, became very sad. Mrs. C. said to me, &#x201C;These are but opinions to Carlyle; but to Mazzini, who has given his all, and helped bring his friends to the scaffold, in pursuit of such subjects, it is a matter of life and death.&#x2019;/ All Carlyle&#x2019;s talk, that evening, was a defence of mere force,&#x2014;success the test of right;&#x2014;if people would not behave well, put collars round their necks;&#x2014;find a hero, and let them be his slaves., &#x26;c. It was very Titanic, and anti-celestial. I wish the last evening had been more melodious. However, I bid Carlyle farewell with feelings of the warmest friendship and admiration. We cannot feel otherwise to a great and noble nature, whether it harmonize with our own or not. I never appreciated the work he has done for his age till I saw England. I could not. You must stand in the shadow of that mountain of shams, to know how hard it is to cast light across it. / Honor to Carlyle! <hi rend="italic"><foreign>Hoch!</foreign></hi> Although in the wine with which we drink this health, I, for one, must mingle the despised &#x2018;rose-water&#x2019;&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Letters</hi>, ed.

<salute>Dear Jamie,</salute>
<p>The meal affair is now settled, the quantity wanted is <hi rend="italic">nine stones;</hi> we have long been desirous of Scotsbrig <hi rend="italic">butter:</hi> so pray send us off the whole <pb id="pg-21-90" n="21:90"/>Package as soon as you can conveniently get it ready. We have ourselves almost given up all Supper here, except a cup of hot milk with a crumb of bread; but we wish to have a <hi rend="italic">possibility</hi> of porridge too, when wanted; one third part of the meal, therefore, is for ourselves; the other two parts are for the Barings and the Ashburtons respectively,&#x2014;illustrious people in behalf of whom we doubt not the Satter Miller will do his very best! They eat a small fraction of oatcake, and have no reasonable meal (nor indeed much skill to make it) in their uncivilized country. I suppose it will come best in a sack; and we can get two small bags here, for the division of it. If the saddle and bridle will pack handsomely, they also can be sent; but if not, do not mind; I have no prospect of using them at present, or of more than laying them up in safety. My Mother, also, can enclose one pound of good well-smelling <hi rend="italic">brown soap</hi>,&#x2014;our &#x201C;mottled soap&#x201C; here is insupportable for smell.&#x2014; This is the sum of the order for the present. Jane thinks we may need about 50 lbs of Butter, somewhat less than a Firkin; but does not seem to be very positive: call it 50 if that <hi rend="italic">is less?</hi> And so enough.</p>
<p>We have got home again, as you would find by the letter to the Doctor; we are very quiet; and not at all going thro&#x2019; much <hi rend="italic">work</hi>,&#x2014;I am in fact resting on my tools at present; and in no haste to begin brashing and smashing again! If I live I suppose there will be need to fasten-to again, and another Book must be attempted by and by.&#x2014; Our weather is very sharp; generally dim-coloured, tho&#x2019; today is sunny with dry east-wind; our health is very fair, better I think than common on both sides. I have completely learned to eat Indian-meal <hi rend="italic">much</hi>, and take it daily with my mutton at dinner: it is very easily made, just like oatmeal porridge&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">first;</hi> but in place of eating it as porridge, you tie it up in a cloth, and boil it (on the edge of the fire) for 5 or even 7 hours longer; it is then very fair stuff indeed, and by much the wholesomest I can get for the purpose. The longer it is boiled, I think it becomes the better. You may boil a great mass of it <hi rend="italic">once a week;</hi> for the second and following days, you merely tie up the due portion in its cloth, and boil it so as to be all <hi rend="italic">hot:</hi> it is fully better than on the first day, better for the new boiling. A really serviceable article; for it will combine kindly with almost any sort of <hi rend="italic">kitching;</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Anything to flavor or spin out a plain food.</note> with meat-gravy, with pepper, milk, butter &#x201C;molasses,&#x201C; and I doubt not, &#x201C;oils,&#x201C; and onions and almost any savoury substance whatever. The natural price of it in New York is about a halfpenny a pound (say three farthing with profit here), and it is equal in nutritive virtue to oatmeal,&#x2014;which is to wheat-flour as 10 is to 15 in that respect. I understand the meal will not keep long without spoiling. The price here is 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi> a pound at present! They have bread of it too on sale; yellow as guineas, and not unsavoury to the taste; but being as dear as <pb id="pg-21-91" n="21:91"/>wheaten bread, of course it is only for the sake of experiment that anybody buys it.&#x2014; If the potatoes have utterly departed, as I think seems very likely, this will in all probability become the substitute for them. Let us be thankful for it.</p>
<p>I have sent to Hugh M&#x2019;Kinnow at Hawick an order for two <hi rend="italic">Union Dresses</hi>, warm winter under-clothings for my Mother: he is to send them to Scotsbrig as soon as he can; I hope he will not neglect or delay. I owe my Mother a Letter by and by, which I will pay: in the meantime let me beg you all to be careful of her, to urge her to take care of herself,&#x2014;to keep a warm fire, and not venture out into this rude weather.</p>
<p>Isabella, it gratifies us to hear, is still pretty well, far better than she once was: let her also beware of the winter cold.&#x2014; This season, I suppose, must be a good one for Farmers&#x2019; prices if for nothing else! <closer><salute>Dear Brother, I commend your honest energy, fidelity and industry, which are the glory of a man in all spheres of life; I pray for all blessings on you; and am ever</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Here is a Letter received this morning, which I must make no delay in sending to you. It will be welcome, as good news from our good Alick always is. He seems to be doing still well in his far home; thrashing, joinering, and busily arranging; putting his own establishment under his own mind&#x2019;s command, which I think is the truest enjoyment a man can have. The Liverpool Box had not yet reached him; but I suppose will have arrived about this time, or will soon arrive.</p>
<p>I am still leading a very <hi rend="italic">peaceable</hi> life here; not fixed to any job, yet not totally idle either: jobs I do believe lie ahead of me, if I last long. I am reading a great many Books, thinking now and then, in a more or less vague manner, of a great many things. In point of health I have not been better for a long while. I have got warm winter clothing; I walk a reasonable space every day, sometimes twice a day; and sleep considerably beyond what my average has been for some years past. For a crazy machine such as this body of mine, now growing an old machine too, this is very well.&#x2014; Jane also maintains a fair condition of health; walks more than I have almost ever known her do; seems to grow <hi rend="italic">stronger</hi>, as well as more serious, as she gets older. We have cold dry weather; do not go out to seek company, and see only a few persons, yet still a few, occasionally drop in upon us here.&#x2014; I believe they are printing some of my Books very busily; but even this I have never yet inquired into the progress of: tomorrow or the day after tomorrow, it seems all one to me, so far as that goes! For these things let us be thankful.</p>

<p>I have read your little <hi rend="italic">History in a Nutshell</hi> with much pleasure:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Untraced.</note> it is surely an eloquent, pious, melodious conception of that immeasurable matter; and if you chose to elaborate it farther, might lead you into all manner of interesting analogies and contrasts.

<salute>Dear Jean,</salute>
<p>The instant I got your Note, I wrote off to the Bookseller people about the Parcel; certain that there was something wrong, and suspecting that it might be worse than it has proved. For I had bought the Article in an immense Haberdashers shop,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-21/lt-18461101-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1846-11-01">1 Nov.</date></ref></note> and merely giving them directions how to send the thing, had never seen it more. My hurry on occasion of the Grange visit had even prevented any due notice to the Booksellers about it! Happily there is nothing wrong after all. The Haberdashers have proved true,&#x2014;only forgetting a little bit of my verbal directions, as they were liable to do;&#x2014;and the Booksellers, as you see by that Note of theirs, <hi rend="italic">have</hi> now sent off the Parcel towards Edinburgh; so that it may still be looked for, all safe, before long. Perhaps in a few days; but at latest about the 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi> of next month: I will beg you to send me a line, the instant you do get it, that there may be no farther uncertainty incurred. Our Mother also will require to be warned.&#x2014; And now enough about this small matter!</p>
<p>Tell Jenny never for a moment to disturb herself about writing to me. There is not the smallest occasion for writing till she have perfect leisure, inclination, and something to say. I am sorry she lost sleep or gave herself any uneasiness about that matter: if she had understood my direction, she had merely to seal the written cover, and put it into the Post-Office, but she had considered that an unpolite thing: and happily now it is all quite right, and we have nothing more to say of it. Surely you do well to take all the care you can of poor little Jenny, and try to make her new home pleasant to her. It is impossible one can find fault with the <hi rend="italic">perfection</hi> of her workmanship; tho&#x2019;, in a time like this, it is not the <hi rend="italic">readiest</hi> way of getting on with one&#x2019;s affairs: but I believe too it will be found the surest way in the long run. I am aware of the dearth of all articles this year: if you ascertain or surmise that poor Jenny is in straits at any time I very particularly charge you to give me warning of it. If she can help <hi rend="italic">herself</hi> thro&#x2019;, it will of course be much pleasanter and better for her: but be sure you always keep this other measure in reserve!&#x2014;</p>
<p>We are just expecting our new Servant here; just expecting <hi rend="italic">Miss</hi> Welsh (Helen) from Liverpool too; and so are rather in a revolutionary state. Miss Welsh is to go again &#x201C;before Christmas&#x201C;; the new servant is well recommended but we know not how she will prove: as for poor Helen (the old Servant) we much fear sad mischiefs at Dublin for the poor little <foreign><hi rend="italic">Dottle</hi></foreign> <pb id="pg-21-95" n="21:95"/>[small creature]; but there could be nothing done to prevent them on our side. Her Brother seems a kind of fool; and she is one too.&#x2014; The wonderful Miss Brown!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably their cousin Nell Brown (see <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410708-TC-JWC-01"><sic>13:174</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1841-07-08">8 July 1841</date></corr></ref>), perhaps mentioned in one of Jean Aitken&#x2019;s letters.</note> Very wonderful indeed!&#x2014; I am doing nothing in the Book way except read. It is with a kind of shudder that I go to a new Book; such a job is it, such a state of health does it throw me into. On the other hand, when I grow too miserable I am <hi rend="italic">forced</hi> to begin.&#x2014;&#x2014; Thanks for all your details and news. Write again soon, and I will try to answer at more length. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Sister</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>There is no news I have to tell you tonight, dear Brother;</salute> except only to mention, for the quieting of some possible scruples in my Mother, that the <hi rend="italic">Gown-piece</hi>, announced some time ago and never yet received in Dumfries, is quite safe notwithstanding. There was a small mistake made here about the sending of it off; which mistake, so soon as I heard from Jean that the thing had not come, I got rectified; and now, Chapman assures me, the Parcel <hi rend="italic">is</hi> off; and, as I have written to Jean on the subject, you are likely to receive it about the beginning of next month at latest. So much for that.</p>
<p>We are still very quiet here, and tolerably well in health; not <hi rend="italic">doing</hi> very much; quietly enjoying the late excellent weather, till this loud storm came on. About an hour ago, Miss Helen Welsh arrived from Liverpool; I have left her, after tea, down stairs with Jane. She is to stay <hi rend="italic">till</hi> Christmas; about which time there is some uncertain speculation of our going off ourselves on a visit of some length to Alverstoke,&#x2014;somewhat problematic, as I judge at present. Miss Helen will do no ill here in the interim; tho&#x2019; Jeannie, our old favourite, I think, would have answered better. We likewise expect, from minute to minute, our new Servant maid tonight! A strapping Edinburgh lass, well recommended; chosen by Jane&#x2019;s old Betty, who has a most judicious eye: we shall see how the pudding proves by eating of it soon!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Proverhial.</note> Poor little Servant Helen, whose head is somewhat turned, sets off for Dublin tomorrow; I doubt it will turn to no good for the poor little tick; but none of <hi rend="italic">us</hi> could do anything to help it. These are our domestic events.</p>
<p>In reference to myself, I should have told you one thing long since: the fate of the Dandelion Pills! I swallowed one daily for some time; but found <pb id="pg-21-96" n="21:96"/>a decided irritation and little other result produced; so that being obliged to interfere with a more effective <sic><hi rend="italic">aloctic</hi></sic><corr><hi rend="italic">aloetic</hi></corr> article, and stand <hi rend="italic">its</hi> irritation over and above, I had to give up the other concern: I tried the gallipot <hi rend="italic">juice</hi> too, once or twice, but with no better consequence and so there I stand,&#x2014;a man incurable by any kind of medicine; for whom medicine might as well not have been! By dint of going idle, I am on the whole rather better at present than usual.</p>
<p>The man we met at Thomas Erskines was Fairey; the Italian Scotch traveller (<hi rend="italic">not</hi> the sick one) who consulted you last year: a good kind of man.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Farie (<date when="1813-00-00">1813</date>&#x2013;<date when="1882-00-00">82</date>), barrister, practicing only a short time; matric. Glasgow Univ., <date when="1827-00-00">1827</date>, which lists him as one of eight brothers (six surviving). One brother, Gilbert (<date when="1808-00-00">1808</date>&#x2013;<date when="1852-00-00">52</date>), who matric. <date when="1822-00-00">1822</date>, may be the &#x201C;sick one,&#x201C; as he died in Madeira. Of the others John (<date when="1810-00-00">1810</date>&#x2013;<date when="1892-00-00">92</date>) was a Liverpool merchant; Claude (<date when="1816-00-00">1816</date>&#x2013;<date when="1870-00-00">70</date>), a barrister, became a sheriff in Melbourne, Australia; the eldest, James (<date when="1800-00-00">1800</date>&#x2013;<date when="1876-00-00">1876</date>), of Farme, Lanarkshire, was a J.P.; and the youngest, Michael (<date when="1819-00-00">1819</date>&#x2013;<date when="1861-00-00">61</date>), stayed in Scotland. Robert, soon to be a frequent visitor to the Carlyles, a great admirer of JWC, and a special intimate of John Carlyle, was said to be &#x201C;a young amiable, thoughtful, and gentlemanlike Scotchman of good family, well-off, and without visible occupation&#x201C; (Espinasse 235). Under TC&#x2019;s inspiration he trans. Goethe&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Campaign in France in the Year <date when="1792-00-00">1792</date></hi> (<date when="1848-00-00">1848</date>). He also trans. A. F. L. M. von Haxthausen-Abbenburg&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">The Russian Empire</hi> (<date when="1856-00-00">1856</date>).</note> About a month since he had already addressed me, by mistake, for <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, one day in the Park.

<salute>Dearest&#x2014;&#x2014;</salute>
<p>This is the second letter intended for you within the last few days&#x2014;one dated Saturday 1 o&#x2019;clock was finished and sealed and all but off to the postoffice&#x2014;the purport being to beg you to enquire if my woman had actually gone!&#x2014;as no tidings of her had reached here twenty four hours after she was due! But just as Carlyle was going out at the door with the letter the woman and her trunk came in, and so spared her friends a fright and you more trouble</p>
<p>She had had a rough and tedious passage&#x2014;which her imagination, unused <pb id="pg-21-97" n="21:97"/>to maritime affairs, magnified into the nearest possible miss of a shipwreck!&#x2014; Accordingly she arrived white with her past terror and qualms&#x2014;and very unlike the blooming character you described her. her look and voice and manner are prepossessing enough&#x2014;I find a great air of <hi rend="italic">you</hi> in her!! especially in the sound of her voice &#x2014;But Ah, my good gracious! what a destruction of all peace and comfort for the time being has been produced for us by the departure of that little ugly <foreign><hi rend="italic">dottle!</hi></foreign> and the substitution of this &#x201C;decidedly respectable-looking servant&#x201C;&#x2014; I know not very well what to predict just yet&#x2014; She is soft and slow&#x2014;but on the other hand methodical and orderly&#x2014; My Aunt Anne<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ann Welsh, JWC&#x2019;s paternal aunt in Edinburgh.</note> it seems, has stuffed her very full of &#x201C;free grace&#x201C; and I should not wonder if she had more of that than of <hi rend="italic">works</hi>&#x2019;&#x2014;but she looks like a person who would fall into no sort of <hi rend="italic">vice</hi> anyhow&#x2014;and the worst trouble I am likely to have with her is from her <hi rend="italic">faint heartedness</hi> and <hi rend="italic">inexperience</hi>&#x2014;for she is not by any means <hi rend="italic">trained</hi> in any one department I have yet tried her in&#x2014;has a <hi rend="italic">sort of idea</hi> about cooking and cleaning out rooms&#x2014;and waiting&#x2014; &#x2014;but it is an idea needing an immensity of practical development. I find&#x2014;the worst I see in her is the faint heartedness&#x2014;a terror about her work not apparently because <hi rend="italic">we</hi> should be disappointed if she proved inadequate but because <hi rend="italic">herself</hi> would be disappointed in the easiness of the place&#x2014; However I am mercifully pretty well just now&#x2014;and I <hi rend="italic">can</hi> work like a house on fire when I can keep my feet, and am <hi rend="italic">obliged</hi> to do it&#x2014;and I can also be <hi rend="italic">very patient</hi> and <hi rend="italic">encouraging</hi> for a tolerable while&#x2014;not <hi rend="italic">always</hi> certainly, but for long enough to give her a fair trial. But oh dear&#x2014;after the easy life as to household matters which I have been leading of late years I feel it monstrously tiresome to be running for ever &#x201C;up stairs, down stairs, in my Lady&#x2019;s chamber,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The nursery rhyme &#x201C;Goosey Goosey Gander.&#x201C;</note> and explaining to this Novice the simplest rudiments of things! In fact ever since she came the house has been like a sort of battle of Waterloo&#x2014;and when I lie down at night it is with something of the same feeling Napoleon must have had when he went to sleep (I forget where) under the fire of the Enemy&#x2019;s cannon! She tells me she has &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">seven Cousins</hi>&#x2019; in London and several friends at service&#x2014;so she is not likely to be too dull! as I cannot find in my heart ever to &#x201C;carry on&#x201C; the London law about ldquo;followers&#x201C;&#x2014;when a servant is solitary in ones house</p>
<p>I will write in a few weeks and tell you how we go on&#x2014;relying on your sympathy always I enclose the money order and will thank you to write a line&#x2014;that I may be sure you have got it safe a great many thanks for the trouble you have taken for me&#x2014;and a deal of love besides</p>

About this time Grosart obtained from the da. of Walter Ruddiman (<date when="1719-00-00">1719</date>&#x2013;<date when="1881-00-00">81</date>), to whom the poet had bequeathed a portrait in his poem &#x201C;Codicile&#x201C; and who was to publish a portrait of Fergusson in his edn. of the poet&#x2019;s works (Edinburgh, <date when="1782-00-00">1782</date>), a copperplate of a portrait of Fergusson.

Laing generously helped Grosart and possibly suggested TC as someone who might have information about portraits of Fergusson and Allan Ramsay, as TC had mentioned both poets in his essay on Burns (<date when="1828-00-00">1828</date>), who was said to have had &#x201C;no furtherance but such knowledge as dwells in a poor man&#x2019;s hut, and the rhymes of a Ferguson or Ramsay for his standard of beauty&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 26:263).</sourceNote><head>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I am much afraid I shall not be able to assist you, by any contribution but that of my good wishes, in your pious Enterprise. I have not read Fergusson at all since the time of my boyhood; neither has Ramsay ever in mature years been familiar to me except in parts. Yet I still very vividly remember Fergusson&#x2019;s best Pieces, mainly those your mention; and should be very glad indeed to see any real elucidations of them or him, if a faithful Editor and Biographer will give us such. Ramsay, as farther off, is still more obscure; in fact, is becoming very cloudy in some of his features. Much enveloped, as most things are apt to be at present, in vague traditionary cant, and twaddle of all kinds: words, words, which, even for the utterers of them, mean almost nothing!</p>
<p>I recommend to you the utmost rigour of accuracy both as to facts and <pb id="pg-21-99" n="21:99"/>opinions: say nothing that <hi rend="italic">you</hi> do not mean (whoever else may have meant it) with the whole insight that was given you or attainable by you.&#x2014; Perhaps a <hi rend="italic">good</hi> Portrait of Ramsay might be attainable somewhere?<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Portraits of Ramsay were made by John Smibert (<date when="1684-00-00">1684</date>&#x2013;<date when="1751-00-00">1751</date>), William Aikman (<date when="1682-00-00">1682</date>&#x2013;<date when="1731-00-00">1731</date>), Allan Ramsay, Jr. (<date when="1713-00-00">1713</date>&#x2013;<date when="1884-00-00">84</date>), and an unknown artist&#x2014;all (except for Smibert&#x2019;s, of which there is a copy) in the Scottish National Portrait Gallery.</note> The current one is surely other than good. The Portrait of his old <hi rend="italic">shop</hi> in the High Street,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edinburgh, demolished <date when="1898-00-00">1898</date>.</note> this at least is still to be had; perhaps at Leadhills the hut where he was born may still be in existence,&#x2014;at all events the site of it is sure to be!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The cottage where Ramsay was born, at Leadhills, Crawfordmoor, Lanarkshire, was no longer standing. TC had visited Leadhills in <date when="1817-00-00">1817</date> on a walking tour with Edward Irving (<hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> 202).</note> Any authentic particular, provided it <hi rend="italic">be</hi> authentic and indisputable, is valuable in these cases: if not authentic, it is of course the reverse of valuable! I should also hope there may be some better Portrait of Fergusson procurable than that frightful madhouse one; not a fair representation at all of the poor high-soaring, deep-falling, gifted and misguided young man.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC probably refers to the portrait reproduced by Ruddiman in his <date when="1783-00-00">1783</date> edn.

<salute>Dear Geraldine,</salute>
<p>You have a beautiful little machine for making cigarettes, have you not? And it was constructed by somebody in Manchester?&#x2014; Well, the thing I want you to do is, to get me an exact facsimile of that,&#x2014;or if there be any <hi rend="italic">improvement</hi> you can point out to the workman, of course I won&#x2019;t object,&#x2014;but at least an equally excellent and exquisite Cigarette-machine; and to let me have it in my hands here (with the Bill of Costs &#x26;c) before Christmas morning next.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Evidently for JWC; Geraldine was an enthusiastic smoker.</note> I dare say you surmise what I am going to do with it:&#x2014;in fact, I bought one here a while ago, a French article of some retensions; but it proved a totally useless affair, had to be angrily flung aside, and only suggested this notable device of applying to you, against Christmas, in the matter! As you are a very good young Damsel, with plenty of penetration <pb id="pg-21-100" n="21:100"/>too, I have no doubt you will effectually do me this bit of service; and also, what is not less important, maintain the profoundest secrecy towards all creatures with regard to it, not letting your left hand know what your right is doing,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Matt. 6:3.</note>&#x2014;that so the achievement may with due suddenness of splendour burst forth, and delight the eye!</p>
<p>Dear Geraldine I am very serious in all this; and do trust you will get me the thing rightly done.</p>
<p>For the rest, I am in a very low condition; totally <hi rend="italic">idle</hi>, as I may call it, which means with me the blackest kind of occupation, down deep in the bowels of Chaos,&#x2014;where indeed the workshop of poor devils like me principally lies.

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>According to Mr Fleming&#x2019;s kind message, I now send you Mr Christie <pb id="pg-21-101" n="21:101"/>my late Amanuensis;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henry Fleming. At the top of the MS is written, in an unknown hand, &#x201C;J. Christie / 21. University St / Bedford Sqr.&#x201C;</note> for whom I am much gratified indeed that you have found some beginnings of employment. I can with great truth testify to his probity of character, to his industry, patience, intelligence,&#x2014;to his general fitness for doing, or assisting to do, any common intellectual work. A man of real worth and faculty in his sphere; a cheerful, humble-minded, well-doing man; who, under his rude exterior, conceals a great deal of peaceable energy, and abundant wholesome <hi rend="italic">common sense</hi> in all its forms;&#x2014;and has in fact a robust capacity for <hi rend="italic">getting labour done</hi>, whenever the way to do it is shewn him. If you can bear with his inexperience for a little, and take the trouble to instruct him clearly what it is you want of him, I am much mistaken if you do not find him a really useful helper. Real <hi rend="italic">help;</hi>&#x2014;and I venture to say less of <hi rend="italic">hindrance</hi> along with it than in most other men I have had to do with.</p>
<p>Pray try him, on my recommendation, so far as you can! To bring the worker to his work (which often lies very far from him), it is the noblest beneficence man can do to man!</p>
<p><closer><salute>With many thanks of my own too&#x2014;I remain always</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>The day after your Letter came, I wrote to Chadwick, making the due inquiries, both Whether there were to be Doctors at all, and if so Who was to appoint them! I heard nothing from him till this morning; and still it proves not to be an <hi rend="italic">answer</hi>, for his Note bears date the 25<hi rend="italic">th</hi> and is written in reply to another and former one of mine; but on reading over what he has sent, it strikes me he may probably have meant it for an <hi rend="italic">indirect</hi> succedaneum for an answer. You will see he writes very ill; stuntedly, and as with a ragged wire dipt in ink. Buller is not in Town; and I know not altogether where to <hi rend="italic">see</hi> Chadwick (his Poor-Law people and he are in a state of divorce of late):<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Though still sec. (until <date when="1847-07-00">July 1847</date>) at the poor law office where excluded from an active role, Chadwick had fought against his isolation by turning to sanitary engineering and the health of towns.</note> but there are other people to whom I can apply, if you do not find an answer in what is now sent, or in what he may still shortly send, which of course I will forward without delay.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-21-102" n="21:102"/>It appears by that Pamphlet, which came with the scratch of a note from Chadwick this morning, that besides the Gov<hi rend="italic">t Commission</hi> there is a private <hi rend="italic">Association</hi> for the Health of Towns; farther that L<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Lincoln brought in a Bill, which Bill, or any Bill, is not yet <hi rend="italic">Law;</hi> and that in fact there has nothing yet anywhere been decided on the subject, so far as we can see.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Chadwick sent TC the <hi rend="italic">Report of the Committee to the Members of the Association, on Lord Lincoln&#x2019;s Sewerage, Drainage, &#x26;c., of Town&#x2019;s Bill</hi> (London, <date when="1846-00-00">1846</date>), pbd. for the Health of Towns Assoc. (formed in <date when="1844-12-00">Dec. 1844</date>), which was drawn up by Dr. Thomas Southwood Smith and Chadwick. TC&#x2019;s page refs. are to the recommended future appointment of official medical officers of health in major towns or districts. The bill (<hi rend="italic">Parl. Papers</hi> [<date when="1845-00-00">1845</date>] v. 363) had been reintroduced early in <date when="1846-00-00">1846</date>, but was withdrawn soon after, and there was no chance of its being soon enacted. Henry Pelham (<date when="1811-00-00">1811</date>&#x2013;<date when="1864-00-00">64</date>), styled earl of Lincoln, educ. Eton and Oxford; M.P. for S Notts, <date when="1832-00-00">1832</date>&#x2013;<date when="1846-00-00">46</date>, and for Falkirk Boroughs, <date when="1846-00-00">1846</date>&#x2013;<date when="1851-00-00">51</date>; first commissioner of woods and forests, <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>&#x2013;<date when="1846-00-00">46</date>; cabinet minister and chief sec. to the viceroy of Ireland, <date when="1846-01-00">Jan.</date>&#x2013;<date when="1846-07-00">July 1846</date>; succeeded as 5<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> duke of Newcastle-under-Lyme, <date when="1851-00-00">1851</date>.</note> But if you look at pp. 5, 89, 119 of the Pamphlet (or probably you will read it all, for other purposes) you <hi rend="italic">will</hi> find a recommendation or vague future prophecy of Doctors being appointed, tho&#x2019; for other ends than Campbell<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Campbell unidentified.</note> thinks of; and this I suppose to be what he, in the distance and hearing very confusedly, may have had in his mind when he wrote to you. As I said, if you wish me to inquire farther, I will readily set about doing it.&#x2014; It is possible or even probable that <hi rend="italic">some</hi> of these Doctors may be voted for, next year, and some of them even appointed, the year after. So far as one can judge by the Duke&#x2019;s Letter,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The duke of Buccleuch wrote to John Carlyle from Dalkeith, <date when="1846-11-28">28 Nov.</date>: &#x201C;I wrote to London to ascertain if possible whether the report, you mentioned to me, be true, that it was in contemplation to appoint four Physicians to a Board for Sanatory purposes. I am informed that at present there is no reason for believing that that rumour is true, &#x26;I now give you the earliest intimation of the information which I have received&#x201C; (MS: NLS Acc. 8140). Evidently John Carlyle had forwarded the duke&#x2019;s letter to TC.</note> he does not seem inclined to give himself much trouble in reference to the matter; nor indeed, I apprehend, would it be of much avail if he did: the likelihood decidedly is that such appointments will not now be by influence at all, but by reputation of fitness for the work, and as to that question the Duke&#x2019;s testimony will only be one, and not the weightiest, among many.&#x2014; I wish I could do anything whatever for you in regard to this matter, or to any other!</p>
<p>We have got sharp frosty weather here; and poor Jane has, as is usual with her, caught a bit of a cold. Her new Servant too is one of the most perfect <foreign><hi rend="italic">Ploots</hi></foreign> [Rustics]; can do nothing of her work at all in a complete manner; has a bad discontented temper too;&#x2014;and indeed, on the whole has, this very day, much to my satisfaction, come to the mutual conclusion with us that she is to go about her business at the end of the Month. All this, with Miss Welsh here, introduces a certain disturbance into our quiet little household: but it will be all got rectified again, before long; and in the <pb id="pg-21-103" n="21:103"/>meanwhile we (or rather others than <hi rend="italic">I</hi>, who am little concerned with it) must take it as gently as we can, till this Practical Platitude too, as many before it have done, be pleased to take itself away. I myself am pretty well; only very <hi rend="italic">idle</hi>, reading nothing but wearisome trivialities, and not writing at all: this morning in spite of the frost, I bathed and washed effectually in my cold tub, and feel for the time very considerably improved by it. Last night we tried the meal in porridge: excellent, in spite of the black specks. The butter is as good, according to all votes, as ever was eaten.</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Just before going out today I bethink me of some slight intimation I had that perhaps none of our Annandale friends will write to you by this Packet. Lest you should suppose there was anything wrong on that account, I throw you off a hurried line to signify that all is still well (thank Heaven) both there and here: I had a Note from Jack at Scotsbrig this very morning, who had been at Dumfries &#x26;c and reported to that welcome effect. Our dear old Mother, he says, holds out wonderfully against the cold weather,&#x2014; <pb id="pg-21-104" n="21:104"/>frost at present with them as with us;&#x2014;and she and they are all doing quite tolerably well. Farm prices are very high, Jamie&#x2019;s sheep selling &#x201C;higher than he ever knew them&#x201C;: yet, owing to the Railway, I believe there is such abundance of labour and of wages that the poor people suffer <hi rend="italic">less</hi> in that quarter than they have done in many better years bygone. There is nowhere yet any real <hi rend="italic">dearth</hi>, except here and there in Ireland; where also one is much consoled to see that at last the Landlords have been peremptorily told (by act of Parliament last autumn) that the people must not be allowed to starve; that the Landlords will have to assess themselves, and raise money to keep the people everywhere at <hi rend="italic">work</hi> and alive!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-21/lt-18461003-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1846-10-03">3 Oct.</date></ref></note> And so, in a very confused way, that legal assessment is now going on all over Ireland; Landlords meeting in &#x201C;Barony-Courts&#x201C; &#x26;c &#x26;c, with much speechifying and complaining; but with the miseries of actual <hi rend="italic">starvation</hi> kept at a distance hitherto:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC was too optimistic; by <date when="1846-12-00">Dec.</date> starvation was rampant. The Labour Rate Act took no account of local landlords&#x2019; ability to pay rates for relief works assessed on them. The barony courts faced requests far beyond the means to pay for them. Poverty-stricken Mayo, e.g., with an annual ratable value of &#xa3;293,282, asked for works to be authorized within the month of <date when="1846-09-00">Sept.</date> costing &#xa3;403,466 (C. Woodham-Smith, <hi rend="italic">The Great Hunger</hi> [<date when="1962-00-00">1962</date>] 112&#x2013;15).</note>&#x2014;and my guess is, the Irish Landlords (if the potatoe, as is like, refuse to grow farther) will all be <hi rend="italic">ruined</hi>, and in a few years obliged to sell out, and give place to <hi rend="italic">better</hi> Landlords; and thereby, with infinite difficulty and confusion, some better state of things will be worked out for the poor wretches in that country. Scotland, and the Scotch Landlords, I believe, will follow next,&#x2014;directly after these Railways are done: and in the rear of them the English Landlords will come also: and, on the whole, this destruction of the potatoe will perhaps bring very blessed consequences to us by and by!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Some three weeks ago or so your Letter to <hi rend="italic">me</hi> arrived; I sent it on directly after reading it to our other Friends. We all rejoice to see you still doing well; still struggling manfully along, which I thinks is all the <hi rend="italic">wellness</hi> anybody can look for in this world. The Liverpool Box had not then got to hand; but must surely have been at no great distance then? We hope to hear by and by that it is safe in the house of <hi rend="italic">Bield</hi>. But do not weary for it; you will find it worth little (except as a sign of our brotherhood) when it does come; and the routes to that Western Quarter are no doubt very <hi rend="italic">longsome</hi>.</p>
<p>We have a kind of small domestic revolution going on here: namely, our old servant Helen is gone away to keep house for a fortunate brother of hers; and a new fit servant has not yet been found;&#x2014;which little puddle becomes considerable in our quiet quarters; the rather as poor Jane has got a cold, as she oftenest does in frosty London fog (the <hi rend="italic">nastiest</hi> weather, I <pb id="pg-21-105" n="21:105"/>believe, in all the climates of the Earth), and is not so able as usual to bear a hand. But of course there <hi rend="italic">are</hi> tolerable Servants; and doubtless we shall by and by get one,&#x2014;and be right again, so far as that goes! I myself am in very fair health, rather superior health for <hi rend="italic">me</hi>; but have not yet got to any definite <hi rend="italic">work</hi> hitherto; and begin to feel now and then that I ought to be <hi rend="italic">up</hi>, and at it again.&#x2014; Tomorrow I shall be Fifty-one! That is a consideration that should keep one a little quieter, I think. Half a century of life ought to teach one a thing or two!&#x2014; <closer><salute>Dear Brother, I must end here. I will send my affectionate regards and love to all your household young and old; my heart&#x2019;s prayer that blessings may rest on you and them forevermore.&#x2014; <foreign>Adieu</foreign>. Your Brother</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>In reference to Oliver Cromwell&#x2019;s place of lodging,&#x2014;of which it appears you are not yet to get your hands free,&#x2014;I remember reading, very many years ago, in an insignificant little Book (Stark&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Picture of Edinburgh</hi>, which is probably known to you) a sentence to this effect: That Oliver lodged in <hi rend="italic">the Cowgate</hi>, in a certain House (some nobleman&#x2019;s, I think, and known to Stark), which a <hi rend="italic">Turner</hi> had &#x201C;lately&#x201C; (i.e. in Stark&#x2019;s time) quitted because it was too poor a house for him.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >No ref. to this has been found in John Stark, <hi rend="italic">Picture of Edinburgh</hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1806-00-00">1806</date>; or later edns. consulted). George Turner, spirit dealer, Horse Wynd (off the Cowgate), is recorded in the Edinburgh <date when="1805-00-00">1805</date> P.O. Directory.</note>&#x2014; This sentence I remember very well, from a distance of 30 years and more: I think it is in some section intended to illustrate the great advance of luxury &#x26;c in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>; but somewhere in the Book it certainly is. Ever since your last Note I have had a purpose to lay this last item of my knowledge or surmise on that matter before you: if in the course of your other investigations you ever came athwart this House in the Cowgate, it might perhaps be in your power to verify or decisively to contradict the statement of poor Stark. It is by no means an important matter,&#x2014;no; but truth and certainty on any matter is better than the opposite! I confess my own supposition rather is, that Oliver did <hi rend="italic">not</hi> lodge, during his second visit, in Moray House; there was no reason why he should, and perhaps several reasons to the contrary, on that new occasion.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-19/lt-18450524-TC-RC-01">TC to RC, <date when="1845-05-24">24 May 1845</date></ref>.</note> If light do chance to arise upon you in regard to this small bit of archaeology, of course you will be kind enough to let me know.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-21-106" n="21:106"/>The other day I received from a little Town in Prussia a strange little German Book, entitled <hi rend="italic">History of Scottish Popular Poetry</hi>, by one Fiedeler (<hi rend="italic">Fiddler</hi>); &#x201C;dedicated to the two Scotchmen R.

<p><salute>My dear Mother,&#x2014;</salute>Possibly enough you may be in some sort of anxiety about Jane&#x2019;s condition here, which by some phrases in my last note to John did seem rather uncomfortable: let me therefore throw you a hasty word to say how matters are, before I go out with the Newspapers. We have indeed had two or three very confused uncomfortable days, and poor Jane is still in bed; but she was never <hi rend="italic">very</hi> ill with her cold, merely coughing and extreme irritability and sickly weakness; and now the weather has greatly softened; and other annoyances being put to rights, we are confidently hopeful that Jane, who is already better, will be on her feet again in a day or two, and all things going on as heretofore.</p>
<p>In fact it was only the change of servants that has occasioned all this mischief; a very humble cause indeed of such a huge confusion as things did this morning (when the matter was at its height) exhibit! Our Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> maid, I said, was doing very badly, and we had come to the agreement with here to <hi rend="italic">halve</hi> the expense of her passage hither, and let her go forever at the end of the month. This satisfied the poor trailing smearing <foreign>gomeral</foreign> [fool] for a day or two, and we tried to put up with her miserable ways without criticism; but yesternight she took suddenly to &#x201C;fainting,&#x201C; or threatening to faint,&#x2014;unable, oh totally unable for the sore work; could not stand it any longer:&#x2014;a new sudden confusion which greatly flurried the poor sick Missus, last night, and did her a great deal of ill in the state she was in. We decided accordingly to <hi rend="italic">dismiss</hi> the useless lumber of a maid there and <pb id="pg-21-107" n="21:107"/>then, and take our chance of finding another as we could: this morning accordingly she made the house clear of her,&#x2014;went to some Cousins or I know not what; my one emphatic injunction to her was, To depart straightway, and never in time or eternity to let us see <hi rend="italic">her</hi> face again! I have not in all my days seen a worse human subject than that unfortunate creature; insolent, mutinous, impotent; in every way <hi rend="italic">base</hi>, and to be avoided by rational creatures. So she went; and we, greatly relieved even to be left alone, have already been able to get another woman, one at least perfectly honest and able to <hi rend="italic">do her work;</hi>&#x2014;and already Jane is much better, and we all feel much more comfortable. The woman is to stay for a week or so on trail; after that, if parties do not suit, either is to be at liberty to be off; and as she is a woman of mature experience (forty years old or so), and well recommended by a &#x201C;Mrs Smith,&#x201C; a good lady of this neighbourhood,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of Cheyne Walk; see <ref target="volume-18/lt-18440514-JWC-JW-01"><sic>18:46</sic><corr>JWC to JW, <date when="1844-05-14">14 May 1844</date></corr></ref>.</note> there is a prospect now that till Jane get up again we may have no more hurlyburlies like the late one. A scandalous situation indeed was that! I have not had such an inclination to cuff anybody&#x2019;s <foreign><hi rend="italic">haffets</hi></foreign> [cheeks] these thirty years, as I had in giving my brief final address to that miserable slut this morning. It is over now.</p>
<p>Dr. Christie is in assiduous attendance on Jane: we found that poor Marough, our old Doctor, had <hi rend="italic">died</hi> about 8 months ago;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. James Morrah; see <ref target="volume-16/lt-18430720-JWC-TC-01"><sic>16:298</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1843-07-20">20 July 1843</date></corr></ref>.</note> Jane had more confidence in Christie than in anybody readily accessible; and indeed I think he goes on very well;&#x2014;neither at bottom, I suppose, was there much that any Doctor could do.</p>
<p>Thus, dear Mother, have I in my <hi rend="italic">haste</hi> made a long story of what should have been very short: however you see how it is; and that all is now promising well with us. Miss Welsh takes charge of the house; and is useful in her place. If anything go <hi rend="italic">wrong</hi> I will write again directly.

<p>I receive with deep sorrow, as you may imagine, your melancholy news this morning. Your noble mother now gone was the first friend I acquired in this country, was the oldest and dearest friend I anywhere had in the world; a truer, more generous, or higher soul I have never known.

<p>I do not write to you in these weeks; I cannot write. Some Fate seems to prohibit me, to say I ought not. In truth, the element I have lived in is very dark, this long while; and I would not complain of it; the sordid smoke of my confusions, why should it blear your bright eyes? You know well, I suppose, that it is not my <hi rend="italic">blame</hi>,&#x2014;alas, no, not my <hi rend="italic">blame!</hi> And for what you understand of me, and for what you do not understand, I trust always to your goodness, and nobleness of mind; to your divine benevolence for me, which indeed has, and had always, something of <hi rend="italic">divine</hi> in it, I think? If it have, it will live thro&#x2019; all trials; and the earnest part of it will be a possession to us both forever. This I believe. If it have <hi rend="italic">not</hi>, it will die, and indeed ought not to live.&#x2014; Silence, patience! Kant said, &#x201C;There are two things strike me dumb: the infinite starry Firmament, and the Sense of right and wrong in man&#x201C;:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Immanuel Kant (<date when="1724-00-00">1724</date>&#x2013;<date when="1804-00-00">1804</date>), conclusion to <hi rend="italic">Critique of Practical Reason</hi> (<date when="1788-00-00">1788</date>); quoted by TC in &#x201C;Shooting Niagara: and After?,&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">works</hi> 30:29&#x2013;30, where Kant is said to be the &#x201C;deepest and most logical of Metaphysical Thinkers.&#x201C;</note>&#x2014;but as for me, I find more than <hi rend="italic">two</hi>, more than even three!</p>
<p><pb id="pg-21-110" n="21:110"/>Here, however, on the merely historical and statistical side, is a sad series of mischances which I ought to indicate to you, for all manner of reasons. My Wife has had a cold; been close confined to her room, mostly to her bed, for three weeks past; and has still no definite prospect of freedom,&#x2014;for tho&#x2019; the cough is nearly or altogether gone, the weakness still continues, and the frost continues. Yesterday and the day before I spent wholly in nailing down <hi rend="italic">listing</hi>, in pasting up crevices; in making a summer temperature for the poor Patient, where she must altogether or oftenest look for refuge while the cold lasts.

And a young Cousin is here, a thin well-meaning <hi rend="italic">Liverpool fine-Lady:</hi>&#x2014;in short, one has nothing for it but to sit obstinately quiet, contracted into the narrowest compass; and, with so much of patience as one has, expect that times will mend!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In his Journal TC wrote, <date when="1846-12-13">13 Dec.</date>: &#x201C;&#x2014;What an interval [the last entry in his Journal was <date when="1844-10-01">1 Oct. 1844</date>]; continuing &#x2018;history&#x2019; enough, which is all unwritten here!&#x2014; Cromwell has got out, after a sort; the second edition in <date when="1846-06-00">june</date> last.

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Yesterday there went from Mr Nutt&#x2019;s shop, imbedded, I suppose, in a soft mass of English Literature,&#x2014;a small Box bearing your address; which I hope may reach you safely, in time for a New-year&#x2019;s remembrance of me. It is a <hi rend="italic">model of the Tomb of Shakespeare</hi>, done by an ingenious little artist here; which may perhaps interest you or some of your friends, for a moment. I understand the likeness in all respects to be nearly perfect,&#x2014;which indeed is the sole merit of such a thing;&#x2014;a perfect copy of the old monument, as it stands within Stratford Church for these two centuries and more:&#x2014;only with regard to that part of the Inscription, &#x201C;Sweet friends, for Jesus&#x2019; sake&#x201C; &#x26;c to these lines, which in the model have found room for themselves directly <hi rend="italic">under</hi> the Figure of Shakespeare, you are to understand that, in the original, they lie on the floor of the Church, some three feet <hi rend="italic">in advance</hi> of the Figure; in fact, covering the <hi rend="italic">dust</hi> of the Poet; the Figure itself standing, at the head of the grave, against the wall.&#x2014; And so enough of it; and may the poor little Package arrive safe, and kindly bring me before you again!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I have been silent this long while, only hearing of you from third parties;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably mainly from Amalie B&#xF6;lte, who in her letters to Varnhagen reports having mentioned him to TC; see, e.g., her letters of <date when="1846-10-16">16 Oct.</date> (&#x201C;I saw Mr. Carlyle yesterday evening and gave him your good wishes&#x201C;) and <date when="1846-12-01">1 Dec.</date> (&#x201C;Mr. Carlyle will soon write you a long letter&#x201C; [trans.]) in <hi rend="italic">Amely B&#xF6;ltes Briefe aus England</hi> 39&#x2013;41.</note> the more is the pity for me. In fact, I have not been well; travelling too, in Scotland, in Ireland; much tumbled about by manifold confusions outward and inward;&#x2014;and have, on the whole, been <hi rend="italic">silent</hi> to all the world; silent till clearer days should come. I have still no fixed work; nothing in the dark chaos that it could seem <hi rend="italic">beautiful</hi> to conquer and <hi rend="italic">do;</hi>&#x2014;no work to write at; and as for reading, alas that has become, and is ever more becoming, a most sorry business for me; and often enough I feel as if Caliph Omar, long ago, was pretty much in the <hi rend="italic">right</hi> after all;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Omar I (581?-644), second orthodox caliph, called &#x201C;Emperor of Believers,&#x201C; TC learned the story from Edward Gibbon, <hi rend="italic">Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire</hi> (<date when="1776-00-00">1776</date>&#x2013;<date when="1788-00-00">88</date>), ch. 51, which tells how Omar answered the request from his gen. Amrou that the Alexandrian Lib. should be spared. He replied (though Gibbon doubted the tale): &#x201C;If these writings of the Greeks agree with the book of God, they are useless and need not be preserved; if they disagree, they are pernicious and ought to be destroyed.&#x201C; Destroyed they were.</note> as if there might be worse feats than burning whole continents of rhetorical, logical, historical, philosophical jangle, and insincere obsolete rubbish, out of <pb id="pg-21-112" n="21:112"/>one&#x2019;s way; and leaving some living God&#x2019;s-message, real <hi rend="italic">Koran</hi> or &#x201C;Thing worth reading,&#x201C; in its stead! These are my heterodoxies, my paradoxes,&#x2014;of which too I try to know the limits.

<p><salute>Dear Emerson,&#x2014;</salute>This is the <date when="1846-12-18">18<hi rend="italic">th</hi></date> of the month, and it is a frightful length of time, I know not how long, since I wrote to you,&#x2014;sinner that I am! Truly we are in no case for paying debts at present, being all sick more or less, from the hard cold weather, and in a state of great temporary puddle: but, as the adage says, &#x201C;one should <hi rend="italic">own</hi> debt, and crave days&#x201C;;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Recorded in Andrew Cheviot, <hi rend="italic">Proverbs, Proverbial Expressions and Popular Rhymes of Scotland</hi> (<date when="1896-00-00">1896</date>) 274.</note>&#x2014;therefore accept a word from me, such as it may be.</p>
<p>I went, as usual, to the North Country in the Autumn; passed some two extremely disconsolate months,&#x2014;for all things distress a wretched thin-skinned creature like me,&#x2014;in that old region, which is at once an Earth and a Hades to me, an unutterable place, now that I have become mostly a <hi rend="italic">ghost</hi> there! I saw Ireland too on my return; saw black potatoe-fields, a ragged noisy population, that has long in a headlong baleful manner followed the <hi rend="italic">Devil&#x2019;s</hi> leading, listened namely to blustering shallow-violent Imposters and Children of Darkness, saying, &#x201C;Yes, we know <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, you are <pb id="pg-21-113" n="21:113"/>Children of Light!&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. 1 Thess. 5:5.</note>&#x2014;and so has fallen all out at elbows in body and in soul; and now having lost its <hi rend="italic">potatoes</hi> is come as it were to a crisis; all its windy nonsense cracking suddenly to pieces under its feet: a very pregnant crisis indeed! A country cast suddenly into the meltingpot,&#x2014;say into the Medea&#x2019;s-Cauldron;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In Greek legend Medea used her cauldron to restore the youth of Jason&#x2019;s father, Aeson, but not of his enemy Pelias.</note> to be boiled into horrid <hi rend="italic">dissolution;</hi> whether into new <hi rend="italic">youth</hi>, into sound healthy life, or into eternal death and annihilation, one does not yet know! Daniel O&#x2019;Connell stood bodily before me, in his green Mullaghmast Cap; haranguing his retinue of Dupeables: certainly the most <hi rend="italic">sordid</hi> Humbug I have ever seen in this world; the emblem to me, he and his talk and the worship and credence it found, of all the miseries that can befal a Nation. I also conversed with Young Ireland in a confidential manner; for Young Ireland, really meaning what it says, is worth a little talk: the Heroism and Patriotism of a new generation; welling fresh and new from the breasts of Nature; and already poisoned by O&#x2019;Connellism and the <hi rend="italic">Old</hi>-Irish atmosphere of bluster, falsity, fatuity, into one knows not what. Very sad to see. On the whole no man ought, for any cause, to speak <hi rend="italic">lies</hi>, or have anything <supplied>[to]</supplied><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> do with lies; but either hold his tongue, or speak a bit of the truth: that is the meaning of a <hi rend="italic">tongue</hi>, people used to know!&#x2014; Ireland was not the place to console my sorrows. I returned home very sad out of Ireland;&#x2014;and indeed have remained one of the saddest, idlest, most useless of Adam&#x2019;s sons ever since; and do still remain so. I care not to <hi rend="italic">write</hi> anything more,&#x2014;so it seems to me at present. I am in my vacant interlunar cave<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Milton, <hi rend="italic">Samson Agonistes</hi> 89.</note> (I suppose that is the truth);&#x2014;and I ought to wrap my mantle round me, and lie, if dark, <hi rend="italic">silent</hi> also. But, alas, I have wasted almost all your poor Sheet first!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Miss Fuller came duly as you announced;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In his letters of <date when="1846-07-15">15</date> and <date when="1846-07-31">31 July</date>, and <date when="1846-08-01">1 Aug.</date>; see <ref target="volume-21/lt-18461008-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1846-10-08">8 Oct.</date></ref></note> was welcomed for your sake and her own. A high-soaring, clear, enthusiast soul; in whose speech there is much of all that one wants to find in speech. A sharp subtle intellect too; and less of that shoreless Asiatic dreaminess than I have sometimes met with in her writings. We liked one another very well, I think, and the Springs too were favourites. But, on the whole, it could not be concealed, least of all from the sharp female intellect, that this Carlyle was a dreadfully heterodox, not to say a dreadfully savage fellow, at heart; believing no syllable of all that Gospel of Fraternity, Benevolence, and <hi rend="italic">new</hi> Heaven-on-Earth, preached forth by all manner of &#x201C;advanced&#x201C; creatures from George <pb id="pg-21-114" n="21:114"/>Sand<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Fuller admired and had written about George Sand, whom she was to see in Paris, saying, &#x201C;I never liked a woman better&#x201C; (A. W. Brown, <hi rend="italic">Margaret Fuller</hi> [New York, <date when="1964-00-00">1964</date>] 97; see also <hi rend="italic">Letters of Margaret Fuller,</hi> ed. Hudspeth 4:256&#x2013;58).</note> to Elihu Burritt,<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >(<date when="1810-00-00">1810</date>&#x2013;<date when="1879-00-00">79</date>), American linguist and advocate of international peace who had come to England in <date when="1846-06-00">June</date> to found the League of International Brotherhood.</note> in these days; that in fact the said Carlyle not only disbelieved all that, but treated it as poisonous Cant,&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">sweetness</hi> of sugar-of-lead,&#x2014;a detestable <hi rend="italic">phosphorescence</hi> from the dead body of a Christianity, that would not admit itself to be dead, and lie buried with all its unspeakable putrescences, as a venerable dead one ought! Surely detestable enough.&#x2014; To all which Margaret listened with much good nature; tho&#x2019; of course with sad reflexions not a few.&#x2014; She is coming back to us, she promises. Her dialect is very vernacular,&#x2014;extremely exotic in the London climate. If she do not gravitate too irresistibly towards that class of New-Era people (which includes whatsoever we have of prurient, esurient, morbid, flimsy, and in fact pitiable and unprofitable, and is at a sad discount among men of sense), she may get into good tracks of inquiry and connexion here, and be very useful to herself and others. I could not shew her Alfred (he has been here since) nor Landor:<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >After his return from Switzerland at the end of <date when="1846-08-00">Aug.</date> (see <ref target="volume-21/lt-18460922-TC-EF-01">TC to EF, <date when="1846-09-22">22 Sept.</date></ref>) Tennyson went to his home in Cheltenham.

<p><salute>Thanks:</salute> here has Buller been calling; here has a thaw come to us; and your Letter first of all, which, in spite of the <hi rend="italic">thick ink</hi> and other difficulties, is as good as ever! &#x201C;All suns,&#x201C; as the Roman Proverb says, &#x201C;have not set&#x201C; :<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf.

<p><pb id="pg-21-115" n="21:115"/>We are not worse, we rather continue to improve: cold gone nearly altogether, weakness, sleeplessness, promising to abate. It is not of the Influenza sort, but we depend much on the weather; the somewhat chaotic household too is against us. Patience, quiet endeavour; and all will come straight again.</p>
<p>It seems decidedly among our purposes to come and pay our visit, both of us, when you return from Bowood.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Bowood Park, Wilts., seat of the marquess of Lansdowne.</note> Subject to contingencies,&#x2014;alas: but we will do our best, some of us!

<p>Perhaps I do not altogether like that Parrot:&#x2014;a feeling of jealousy; unworthy of great minds.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lady Harriet had recently acquired a green parrot.</note></p>
<p>I had a threatening of cold myself; but drove it back by a bath in freezing water yesterday morning, and other violently heroic measures.</p>

<salute>Dear Sister Jean,</salute>
<p>Your two pretty little wristikins arrived safe last night; and the kind little Letter with them, which with its tone of sadness and almost of solemnity very much affected the poor <hi rend="italic">Missus</hi> in her present weak state. She directs me to send you many kind thanks, till she be able to answer for herself.</p>
<p>We have, as you surmise, been in a considerably ugly kind of puddle for some three weeks back; and are not yet entirely out of it, tho&#x2019; coming out now, we hope. The Edinburgh Servant proved an entire failure; one of the most useless, insolent, canting, unendurable pieces of Human Dishonesty I have ever set eyes on: one of those unfortunate creatures whom the &#x201C;Penny Ladies&#x201C; educate (Jane&#x2019;s Aunts<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ann, Elizabeth, and Grace Welsh.</note> had been very busy with this one); who get themselves all filled with abstruse evangelical doctrines, simpering courtesies, and such like hypocritical shews, and are left totally ignorant that unless you can do your <hi rend="italic">work</hi> in this world there is no hope for you here or elsewhere! The unfortunate shut could do no work at all, and would do none; Jane caught a bad cold running after her, encouraging, try to teach her (with but little hope, I think); was obliged to take to bed; on the <pb id="pg-21-116" n="21:116"/>third day after which, our courageous consciencious<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> Help (on a Saturday night late, it was) fairly broke down; declared that she must be off tomorrow. She went accordingly:&#x2014;you can fancy what a time we have had since; with Miss Welsh here as a <hi rend="italic">guest</hi>, Jane still confined to her room (<hi rend="italic">altogether</hi> till yesternight for a while at tea), and no servant here, but an old halfdunce, that was suddenly surrendered to us, whom I call <hi rend="small-caps">Slow</hi>-<hi rend="small-caps">Coach</hi>, and who well deserves the name!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Hanah,&#x201C; recommended by Mrs. Smith; see <ref target="volume-21/lt-18461206-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1846-12-06">6 Dec.</date></ref></note>&#x2014; However Jane <hi rend="italic">is</hi> now getting better; in hopes to be out again in the course of the week; Miss Welsh too will go (for tho&#x2019; she is in the highest degree assiduous, and patient of all confusion, a <hi rend="italic">stranger</hi> is no acquisition in such an emergency): after which we set regularly to <hi rend="italic">get</hi> a proper servant, and shall hope to be all on our old footing again. There has come <hi rend="italic">thaw</hi> since Friday night; that is one of the finest features for us! I myself had caught some cold; but am beating it back again by vigorous measures. Such is the <hi rend="italic">worst</hi> of our news.</p>
<p>Here has a Letter come from Alick; it should have been sent off yesternight: I am under the influence of <hi rend="italic">drugs</hi> today, and must not write more. Jenny&#x2019;s Letter came safe. <closer><salute>Blessings to all.</salute></closer></p>

<p>Jane got out of her room for a little while last night; was here again this afternoon (in the Library), but has lain down on bed again for a little, feeling very weak and tired. Part of this I impute to some <hi rend="italic">powders</hi> of Christie&#x2019;s, and advised her to take no more. She has had no cough for a good many days back; but continues very feeble, and especially sleeps but ill. Daily however I do see her grow better: <hi rend="italic">thaw</hi> has come too, since Friday Night, a decidedly mild temperature now; so that we calculate with confidence on her getting out into this (Library) room, gradually to resume her office there, in a day or two. She is utterly anxious to do <hi rend="italic">it;</hi> and one of the most important services Miss Welsh and I can do her is to hide any imperfection there may be (and certainly there are abundance) in old <hi rend="small-caps">Slow</hi>-<hi rend="small-caps">Coach</hi>&#x2014;such is the name I have given our present respectable <pb id="pg-21-117" n="21:117"/>Help!

<salute>My dear Jane</salute>
<p>I am not up to much writing yet&#x2014;my three weeks confinement to bed and the violent medecine that was given me to put down my Cough have reduced me to the consistency of a jelly. But I will not wait till I can write a long letter, but tell you now in a short one how glad I was of the little token of your kind remembrance which reached me the other night just when I was trying to sit up for the first time.

<p>Helen had usefully and affectionately stayed with us eight years or more. Latterly, a silly snob of a younger brother, setting up, or getting forward, in some small business at Dublin, came once or twice, after total neglect before, opened a &#x2018;career of ambition&#x2019; to the poor creature, and persuaded her over to Dublin to keep house for him. It was well foreseen what this was likely to end in; but there could be no gainsaying. Poor Helen went (and took the consequence, as will be seen); bright breakfast-table report of her strange sayings and ways (gentle genial lambency of grave humour and intelligence&#x2014;wittiest of wit that I ever heard was poor in comparison!) ceased altogether then; and to us, also, the consequences for the time were variously sad.</p></ps>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I have to acknowledge with thanks a friendly Packet from you, consisting of a Cahier of the <hi rend="italic">R&#xE9;vue Ind&#xE9;pendante</hi>, with a very kind Note, to introduce me to a Criticism of my Writings you have published there,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A review-article on TC in general by Antoine Dilmans, <hi rend="italic">La Revue Ind&#xE9;pendante</hi> 5 (<date when="1846-09-25">25 Sept. 1846</date>): 119&#x2013;56. Milsand was later to review TC&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Latter-Day Pamphlets</hi> in the <hi rend="italic">Revue des Deux Mondes</hi>, <date when="1850-06-15">15 June 1850</date>.</note> which also is of very kind tenor. The Packet did not arrive till two days ago; owing to some accident which Mr Russell,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> the Bearer of it, has politely taken the trouble to explain. Accept many thanks for your friendly regard to me in these matters; and my assurance that your message was was very welcome when it did come.</p>
<p>I have read the Criticism with attention; have found it indeed to merit much more attention than such things usually do. It is evidently the production of an earnest, ingenuous, ardent and true-hearted man; singularly open to foreign ideas, and prompt to recognise with enthusiasm whatsoever he finds of Universal and Humane in the tendency of them. A rare character among reviewers and men! The image you have formed of me may well deserve looking at, while so many others do not; both when you assent and when you differ, there arise true sources of interest, and all manner of profitable sympathies and reflexions. I think I may further congratulate you on a very superior knowledge of the English language, a perfect knowledge so far as here appears;&#x2014;in notice of which, and of other nobler qualities visibly combined with it, I will augur essential services, of the international sort, as you proceed in your career.</p>
<p>It will give me pleasure to see more of your writings, such as Time and the good Opportunities may bring to light. I will bid you go on and prosper. With many good wishes, with many thanks and regards</p>

<salute>My Dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I am very anxious about you in this new arrival of frost; John&#x2019;s last Letter told me you had begun to suffer by the former hard weather; and now after the <foreign><hi rend="italic">glar</hi></foreign> [mud] and thaw, we have got a Northwind and a very sharp temperature again. It is very severe on poor weak people; indeed I myself, in spite of all that I can dress and wrap, find it hurtful to the wellbeing of the body. Much more may it be to my poor Mother, who is neither so strong nor so well-kept as I am. Pray tell the Doctor to write me again some small word as to how you are, that I may at least not keep figuring it worse than the reality. You should put on an <hi rend="italic">additional</hi> flannel-shift; I have done the like, and find it an excellent scheme. There is also another that I do with regard to feet; namely wear a pair of <hi rend="italic">huge</hi> cloth-boots (a monstrous pair I was lucky enough to discover) and <hi rend="italic">two</hi> pairs of stockings, which keep my feet quite hot all day. I am afraid you did not get any pairs of snow-boots at all, tho&#x2019; there was a pair intended for you: but Jack can easily get you a pair, and I wish he would; <hi rend="italic">two</hi> pairs of stockings and these, would really be of service. Good fires, I suppose, you do not neglect. We will hope this fit of frost may finish it for the present year.</p>
<p>Here we are decidedly looking up again; beginning to see the <hi rend="italic">issue</hi> from these times of darkness. Jane has been out of her room for nearly a week now; spends the day regularly in this room (the Library); is quite well of her cold; only dare not yet, for a moment, expose herself to the naked air out of doors or even in a cold room. Or rather <hi rend="italic">she</hi> dares, but I dare not, and will not let her: <hi rend="italic">this</hi> fit of hers, coupled with Slow-Coach and Company, is a thing I can have no wish to see repeated! Further we have at last got a servant; a really eligible-looking smart little woman; has been 3 years in a family near us; well recommended;&#x2014;is to come home, and <hi rend="italic">oust</hi> Slow-Coach, on Thursday Night:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1846-12-31">31 Dec.</date> Anne Brown.</note> may it be lucky! Miss Welsh thereupon is going home; we shall get all into our old course again; and like it the better for this foul tumult. My own health too, which had suffered a little for about a week, is now near its usual figure again.&#x2014; Last night we made some capital porridge in this room: thank Jamie! Isabella&#x2019;s butter too gets daily praises, and deserves them. Take care of yourself dear Mother; <closer><salute>my blessing on you all!</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Redwood,</salute>
<p>Your new Christmas Gift arrived safe on Saturday; again reminding us that we have a modest, beneficent and faithful Friend in the West; far off, but not unmindful of us. Such an assurance has its value in this world; a value which Time, so destructive elsewhere, yearly increases: let us be thankful for it.</p>
<p>As we did not hear of you till Christmas day was over, a sad thought had struck me that perhaps there was distress in your house,&#x2014;danger of a loved life, such as I know you had long looked forward to. Alas, it now turns out that the danger is <hi rend="italic">past</hi>, That sorrowful foreboding has become certainty; the thing that you greatly feared has come upon you! There is something altogether affecting in the few words you utter on that subject; which I well understand. All my life too I have trembled at precisely a similar misery; which by law of Nature I am probably destined soon to experience too. We have but one Mother;&#x2014;and the Author of us has appointed, as the universal rule, that this holiest of all human relations <hi rend="italic">has</hi> to be cut asunder. From the beginning of the world it was <hi rend="italic">so</hi>.&#x2014; Sorrow has in it something nobler than joy. Let us look to the Stars, to the Eternities,&#x2014;let us look this godlike universe in the face; and not complain.</p>
<p>We have had a very black time of hubbub here for weeks past: my Wife fell suddenly ill of cold, our old Servant went away, visitors came, &#x26;c &#x26;c: I do not recollect any four weeks for a long while that have passed with me in a more entirely uncomfortable manner. Happily it is ceasing now; my Wife getting out of her room for about a week past: in few days more all, or nearly all, will be in its old routine again. A few weeks of Chaos are needed, I suppose, to make us prize the blessings of <hi rend="italic">Cosmos</hi> duly,&#x2014;from time to time.&#x2014; &#x2014; I am doing no work; reading Books, most part of which do nothing but disgust and irritate me. My Life amounts to a grim silence at present: lips rigorously <hi rend="italic">shut</hi>; which, if one&#x2019;s eyes are open, may be a useful temporary arrangement.</p>
<p>If Boverton<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hamlet 4&#xBD; mi. SE of Cowbridge in SE Glamorgan.</note> were not so far off, or if my skin were thicker against the horrors of locomotion, I might perhaps hope to see you there for a week or two, by and by. But the &#x201C;nature of the beast,&#x201C;&#x2014;that point is an unalterable one. We shall see!&#x2014; Wishing you courage, patience, heart and health&#x2014; <closer><salute>Yours ever truly&#x2014;</salute></closer><name>T. Carlyle</name></p>

<p><title>&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;</title></p>
<p>Something <hi rend="italic">wrong</hi> there; which you once told me how to rectify: but I have lost the Letter.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-19/lt-18450103-TC-CR-01">TC to CR, <date when="1845-01-03">3 Jan.</date></ref>, and <ref target="volume-19/lt-18450127-TC-CR-01">TC to CR, <date when="1845-01-27">27 Jan. 1845</date></ref>.

<salute>My dearest Susan,</salute>
<p>I wonder if you are out of anxiety about your Sister!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Susan Stirling had four sisters; see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350600-JWC-SS-01"><sic>8:161</sic><corr>JWC to SS, <date when="1835-06-30">30 June 1835</date></corr></ref>.</note> I am almost afraid to begin telling you of my own troubles without being first satisfied of <hi rend="italic">that</hi>. But it seems unkind, after all your exertions to provide me with a servant, not to tell you the catastrophe of the one sent me by Betty! It is only now for the first time that I am in a condition to give you the disgusting history&#x2014;for I was taken ill in the second week of her&#x2014;have been three weeks confined to bed and a week more to my bedroom fireside&#x2014;and am but just emerged into the Library, between which and my bed room I look forward, with &#x201C;a certain&#x201C; resignation, to passing all the rest of the winter&#x2014;</p>
<p>You would see by my last letter that I was dubious as to the result of that Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> damsel&#x2014; I tried to hope the best and cultivate patience and cheerfulness&#x2014;but <hi rend="italic">your</hi> notion that she had been too much petted for this <hi rend="italic">situation</hi> gained on me every day. She showed no disposition to learn her work&#x2014;in fact every day she became more sulky and slovenly&#x2014;and on the first washing day she burst out on me with a sort of <hi rend="italic">hysterical</hi> insolence declared she &#x201C;had never been told by anybody that she was to wash&#x201C;&#x2014;that &#x201C;no one woman living could do my work&#x201C;&#x2014;and when I told her the answer to <hi rend="italic">that</hi> was, that it had been <hi rend="italic">done</hi> by &#x201C;one woman&#x201C; for eleven years without the slightest complaint, she said almost <hi rend="italic">screamed</hi> &#x201C;Oh yes there are women that <hi rend="italic">like to make slaves of themselves,</hi> and her you had was of that <pb id="pg-21-123" n="21:123"/>sort but <hi rend="italic">I</hi> will never slave myself for anybody&#x2019;s pleasure&#x201C;! I asked here if she would be so good as state calmly what she meant to do. To &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">go</hi> to be sure&#x201C;&#x2014; &#x201C;Did she propose repaying me her expenses then?&#x201C;&#x2014; &#x201C;No she had no money&#x201C;&#x2014; I thought the only way to treat such a creature who seemed to have no sense of obligation or anything else but her &#x201C;own sweet will,&#x201C; was to let her depart in peace, and remain a loser of only two guineas and not of my temper as well&#x2014; So I told her well! she might go at the end of her month only to make no noise if possible for the remaining three weeks. But even that was too much to ask&#x2014;in the second week of hers I was laid up in bed with one of my serious colds&#x2014;caught in doing the most of her work myself and exposing myself after quite an unusual fashion&#x2014;and there I lay with a D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> attending me daily&#x2014;and dozing me with tartar-emetic and opium till I had hardly my sense left. and was <hi rend="italic">too weak to cough,</hi> while Carlyle and my Cousin had to shift for themselves and me too, with an occasional helping hand from our Post-Man&#x2019;s Wife<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mrs. Piper. See JWC&#x2019;s description of her sickness to Caroline Fox, <ref target="volume-21/lt-18470525-JWC-HW-01">JWC to HW, [<date when="1847-05-25">25 May 1847</date>]</ref>.</note>&#x2014; Isabella meanwhile <hi rend="italic">crying</hi> about her &#x201C;hands getting all spoilt with dirty work,&#x201C; and doing <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> she could help. Till on Saturday night&#x2014;just a fortnight after she had come, she sent me word in my bed that if I did not let her go&#x2014;next day (Sunday!) she &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">would take fits</hi> and be <hi rend="italic">laid up in my house a whole year</hi> as happened to her once before in a place where the work was too hard&#x201C; Carlyle told her to go in the Devil&#x2019;s name&#x2014;and a little more of his mind he told her which was a satisfaction for me to have said in <hi rend="italic">his emphatic way</hi> since I was unable to rebuke her myself! But you may fancy the mischief all this did to a poor woman taking tartar-emetic and opium every two hours! When my D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> came next day he said it was &#x201C;well he had not been here at the time, as he would certainly have <hi rend="italic">dashed her brains out!!</hi>&#x201C; By that time however she was gone&#x2014;actually rushed off after breakfast&#x2014;on Sunday (!) (So much for &#x201C;free grace&#x201C; of which she professed to be full!) smartly dressed and very happy&#x2014;they told me&#x2014;off to the &#x201C;seven cousins&#x201C; with whom I had more goodnaturedly than wisely permitted her at her own request to pass all the previous Sundays&#x2014;leaving me very ill in bed and no servant in the house! The day after she brought an omnibus and a female friend to the door&#x2014;in the finest spirits, to take away her box&#x2014;and from that day to this I have heard no more of her! but if such a character as she exhibited here do not lead her to the <hi rend="italic">Streets</hi> someday I shall be greatly surprised. Of course her respectable appearance backed out by the seven cousins will have got her another place are now&#x2014;where if menservants be kept she may exert herself&#x2014; My D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> said he could tell by her looks the first <pb id="pg-21-124" n="21:124"/>day she opened the door to him that she had then or had quite lately had <foreign><hi rend="italic">the greensickness</hi></foreign><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >An anemic disease of young women.</note>&#x2014;and that I was well rid of her&#x2014;</p>
<p>And now I might write a few sheets more of the old half-dead <hi rend="italic">cook</hi> whom a Lady who was going to part with her at any rate on account of her &#x201C;shocking bad temper&#x201C; obligingly made over to us as &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">a temporary</hi>&#x201C; at an hours notice. Such as she is she has been an improvement on Isabella for she does her best&#x2014;but Oh what a puddle it has been! and rushing down of an orderly house to chaos! Another fortnight of it would send my not too patient Husband raving mad! Since I got out of bed I have been seeing all sorts of horrid looking females &#x201C;inquiring after the place&#x201C;&#x2014;and two days ago finally settled with one <hi rend="italic">not</hi> horried looking, but a cheery little <hi rend="italic">button</hi> of a creature with a sort of cockney resemblance to Helen&#x2014; She has been nearly three years in a similar situation close by; which she has only left in consequence of the Mistress having died and the Master going into Lodgings&#x2014; He gave her an excellent <hi rend="italic">character</hi> to my cousin. especially for quiet habits. &#x201C;She had <hi rend="italic">only one Lover</hi> who came to see her and <hi rend="italic">one female friend</hi> (happy little woman!) both highly respectable and not too troublesome&#x201C;&#x2014; She is to come on the last night of the year!</p>
<p>This will reach you on the first day of the new year&#x2014;and I put many good wishes and a kiss into it&#x2014; Do write to me how your Sister is&#x2014;</p>

<p>This is the catastrophe or utter down-break of <foreign>Pessima</foreign> [the Worst], whom I still remember as a handsome, cultivated-looking Edinburgh girl, speaking Scotch like an Edinburgh gentlewoman, and exhibiting a characeter and style of procedure detestable beyond any previous specimen I had ever known of. She had been carefully trained by pious Edinburgh ladies; was filled with the consciousness of free grace; and, I believe, would have got more real education, as I told her, if she had been left to puddle through the gutters with her neglected fellow brats, by whom she would have been trampled out of the world had she behaved no better than now. Indisputably the worst specimen of Scotch character I have ever seen produced. My brief request to her was to disappear straightway, and in no region of God&#x2019;s universe, if she could avoid it, ever to let me behold her again. The poor devil, I believe, died in a year or two, and did not come upon the streets as predicted of her.</p>
<p>Betty, the old Haddington servant, who had been concerned in the sending or sanctioning of this wretched creature, was deeply grieved and <pb id="pg-21-125" n="21:125"/>disappointed. The charm for Betty had been the perfect Free Kirk orthodoxy and free grace professions of this Pessima, who, I think, reported at home that she had been obliged to leave us, having actually noticed once or oftener that we &#x2018;received&#x2019; on Sabbath.</p>
<p>The cousin mentioned here is good Helen Welsh, of Liverpool, Maggie&#x2019;s eldest sister, whose amiable behaviour and silent helpfulness in this sordid crisis I still well remember. The improvised old woman, I remember, got the name of slowcoach between us, and continued for perhaps three weeks or more. She was a very white-aproned, cleanly old creature, and I once noticed her sitting at some meal in her kitchen, with a neatness of tablecloth and other apparatus, and a serene dignity of composure in her poor old self, that were fairly pathetic to me. For the rest, never did I see so sordid a domestic crisis appointed for such a mistress, in this world! But it had its kind of compensation too; and is now more noble and queenlike to me than all the money in the bank could have made it.</p>
<p>The little creature called Anne did prove a good cockney parallel of Scotch Helen Mitchell, and served us well (with only one follower, our butcher&#x2019;s lad, who came silently, and sat two hours once a week): follower and she were then wedded, went to Jersey, where we heard of their doing well in the butcher&#x2019;s business; but, alas, before long, of poor Anne&#x2019;s falling ill and dying.</p>
<p>Before Anne&#x2019;s quitting us, dottle Helen had finished her ladyhood at Dublin, quarrelled with her fool of a brother there, and retired to Kirkcaldy, signifying the warmest wish to return hither. She did return, poor wretch, but was at once discerned (not by me) to be internally in a state of chaos; and within three months, for open and incurable drunkenness, had to be dismissed. Endless pains were taken about her; new place provided (decent old widow in straitened circumstances, content to accept so much merit in a servant and tried to cure the drunkenness). But nothing whatever could avail; the wretched Helen went down and down in this London element, and at last was sent home to her kindred in Kirkcaldy to die. &#x2018;Poor bit dottle,&#x2019; what a history and tragedy in small!&#x2014;<name>T.C.</name></p></ps>

<salute>Dearest M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Russell</salute>
<p>I am recovering out of one of my serious <hi rend="italic">colds</hi> just in time to write you my new-years good wishes&#x2014; Nothing could be more inconvenient than <pb id="pg-21-126" n="21:126"/>my falling ill the very week after my poor little Helen went away&#x2014; She understood so well how to do with her master when I was not there, and kept my mind so easy about <hi rend="italic">material</hi> things that an illness in her time was of comparitively little moment. But with <hi rend="italic">her</hi> departure every thing went to sixes and sevens; the new maid whom an old servant in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> had selected for me proved to have been selected more on account of her pretentions to &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">free grace</hi>&#x201C; than of any &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">works</hi>&#x201C; she was capable of&#x2014;in fact my Aunt Ann it turned out had had a hand in her education&#x2014; If I had only known <hi rend="italic">that</hi> sooner; she should never have sailed to London at <hi rend="italic">my</hi> expence!&#x2014; But I relied on the practical understanding which old Betty used to manifest before she became an enthusiast for the free church&#x2014;and made myself sure of being able to <hi rend="italic">do</hi> better or worse with any servant of her recommending Alas&#x2014;the girl had come out of a family where eight servants were kept&#x2014;fancied it would be nice to get to London where she had &#x201C;seven cousins&#x201C; and was willing to undertake anything till she got there&#x2014;and then she satisfied herself within the first twelve hours that it was &#x201C;too lonely&#x201C; to be a single servant&#x2014;that all-work &#x201C;spoiled her hands,&#x201C; and having with all her &#x201C;free grace&#x201C; no more sense of <hi rend="italic">duty</hi> than a cat, she threw up her engagement for six months at the end of six days!&#x2014;and declared that if she were not allowed to depart (to the Cousins) she &#x201C;would take fits&#x201C; as she had &#x201C;once done before in a place that did not suit her and lie in bed for a year!!!&#x201D;&#x2014; <hi rend="italic">I</hi> being already laid in bed thro the fatigue and unusual exposure to cold which I had had in trying to set her a-going, the chance of <hi rend="italic">her</hi> taking to bed was not to be risked so Carlyle bade her go then in the Devils name, rather glad to be rid of such a &#x201C;lump of selfish, dishonest fatuity&#x201C; on any terms&#x2014; She &#x201C;could not&#x201C; repay her expenses so she walked off with her two guineas&#x2014;as happy as a pig&#x2014;on a Sunday morning (!) leaving me very ill in bed my Cousin Helen here on a visit and no servant in the house! So much for the whim of bring<supplied>[ing]</supplied><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letters omitted.</note> a servant from Scotland! A Lady in the neighbourhood who was meaning to discharge her cook at any rate&#x2014;on account of her constant <hi rend="italic">rows</hi> with the other servants goodnaturedly dispatched her to <hi rend="italic">us</hi> at a moments warning and this woman an old half-dead grumbling soul, but a degree better than nothing, has been acting as a provisional Help; till I should get well enough to look out for a permanent and more effective one&#x2014; Three weeks confinement to bed and the quantities of tartar emetic and opium<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-21/lt-18470525-JWC-HW-01">JWC to HW, [<date when="1847-05-25">25 May 1847</date>]</ref>.</note> given me to stop the inflamation on my chest have left me as weak as water&#x2014;and little able to fall energetically to the rehabilitation of my house which is fallen into such a state of <pb id="pg-21-127" n="21:127"/>disgusting chaos as you can figure. My poor cousin has done her best to keep things right but she has no genius for housekeeping &#x201C;under difficulties&#x201C;&#x2014;and it has aggravated rather than comforted our sad plight to see <hi rend="italic">her</hi> playing Cinderella with almost no useful result. And then I had brought her for a month to show her London and give her a little pleasure&#x2014;and to think that my bedroom and kitchen should have been her appointed sphere! Now I have engaged a girl whose face and history so far as I know it promise well&#x2014; She is to come the last day in the year and I am <hi rend="italic">brutally</hi> sending my Cousin home the same day that I may have a fair chance at <hi rend="italic">settling</hi> the newcomer into her <hi rend="italic">place</hi> myself&#x2014;full time; for Carlyle has been giving signs of having reached the limits of his human patience&#x2014;and if he do not soon have a pair of shoes cleaned for him and his Library swept he also will &#x201C;take fits.&#x201C; Oh how I wish that Margaret<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hiddlestone.</note> had come to me!&#x2014; All this would have been spared us, even my illness, for I was <hi rend="italic">quite well</hi> of cold when that horrid free-church-woman arrived&#x2014;and might have continued so with proper care of myself. I wonder if Margaret would have taken the place if I had given out all the heavy clothes to wash&#x2014; I cannot fancy our <hi rend="italic">work</hi> hard for Helen who did it all, washing included, for eleven years was far from healthy&#x2014;in fact asthmatical. I have one blessing here however in the way of service which I ought to be thankful for&#x2014;our post-man&#x2019;s wife who has baked the best possible bread for us a long time, and who living at hand is always going and coming since I have been in a puddle to help me in the quietest nicest way&#x2014;</p>
<p>But it is not good for me to be writing such a long letter&#x2014;for I am still confined to two rooms with order to &#x201C;keep myself perfectly quiet&#x201C;&#x2014;more easily said than done!&#x2014; Will you take the old trouble for me&#x2014;in transmitting my newyears remembrance to Margaret an Mary&#x2014;and the others you know of&#x2014;the small sum you advanced for me in <date when="1846-07-00">July</date> was given to my cousin Helen who said she punctually sent an order for it&#x2014;I hope it came all right.</p>
<p>I send you a pair of card-racks from the Falls of Niagara&#x2014;more curious than beautiful&#x2014;but you will give them a place in your drawing room anyhow for the sake of one who will ever think of you with affectionate gratitude&#x2014; <closer><salute>My kind regards to your Husband and Father</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Maurice</salute>
<p>Many thanks for your Book.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">The Religions of the World; and Their Relations to Christianity Considered in Eight Lectures</hi> (<date when="1847-00-00">1847</date>), given as the Boyle Lectures for <date when="1846-00-00">1846</date>.</note> I have read it over with attention; I may say too, with real pleasure and instruction. The first five Lectures are altogether according to my own heart: if in the three others I can get less anchorage (which you will not be surprised at) and find myself in an obscurer element; here too I land from time to time on beautiful little islands of Candour, of manful pious truth, and can very profitably pause there.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The first five lectures dealt with Mahometanism, Hinduism, Buddhism, the &#x201C;defunct religions&#x201C; (Persian, Egyptian, etc.), and then (in pt. 2) with the &#x201C;Relations of Mahometism to Christianity&#x201C;; the last three are on the relations of Hinduism and Buddhism to Christianity, and &#x201C;How Christianity Assailed the defunct Systems.&#x201C;</note> Undoubtedly the Book seems to me to mark a new epoch in this department of speculation<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In the pref. Maurice refers at length to TC&#x2019;s &#x201C;Lecture on Mahomet in his <hi rend="italic">Hero Worship,</hi>&#x201C; to which he objected when it was first given (see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400509-TC-MAC-01"><sic>12:139</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1840-05-09">9 May 1840</date></corr></ref>): &#x201C;Some persons may have been led by that Lecture to identify Mahometanism with reverence for the person of Mahomet; they will strongly object to the sentiments which I have expressed in one passage of this book. But I do not anticipate any such objection from Mr. Carlyle himself. No writer has more distinctly recognised the Islamite principle of subjection to an absolute Will, as the vital one in this faith; or has exhibited a more earnest, I had nearly said a more exclusive, veneration for that principle&#x201C; (viii). It is not clear exactly what passage Maurice had in mind. Naturally he affirms the truth of the Christian revelation, which TC does not; and he writes of raising questions which &#x201C;may never present themselves to a dilettante admirer of Carlyle,&#x201C; while &#x201C;those whom his writings have really moved and who regard him with hearty, though perhaps silent gratitude and affection, are, I know, haunted by them continually. If these Lectures should lead any one such questioner even to hope for an answer, they will do the work for which I especially designed them&#x201C; (ix&#x2013;x).</note></p>

<p>What is this that you tell us about influenzas and sofas? I pray you alter that Bulletin as soon as possible! And understand generally that you are not to place yourself, even by Hudson&#x2019;s<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Hudson&#x2019;s.</note> order, in draughts by the side of the railway, in fierce frost; or to run about as if you were the Czar of all the Russias, instead of being what you are! All people, in this bitter winter, have to take care of themselves; even I, usually indifferent to temperatures, have been obliged to mount double clothing, and have suffered nevertheless.</p>
<p>Today I will leave at Stanhope-Street a <hi rend="italic">Cicero&#x2019;s Letters and Life;</hi> which they will send to you; which you are welcome to keep for ten years, or forever if you like it. The Translation is English; Middleton&#x2019;s; by far the best, I believe, in any modern language.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Conyers Middleton, <hi rend="italic">The History of the Life of Marcus Tullius Cicero</hi>, 2 vols. (<date when="1741-00-00">1741</date>).</note> If, for some reason or none, you prefer a French one, tell me, and I will act upon &#x201C;Croucher&#x201C; (poor Croucher),<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly George Crouch, bookseller, 1 Crown Ct., Blackfriars.</note> or otherwise procure it. Or does this <hi rend="italic">Middleton</hi> perhaps hurt your eyes? I can, without any difficulty, get you a <hi rend="italic">Middleton</hi> in larger type, I believe. So much for Cicero, since you will honour him with a reading. About a week ago I left you, for Newyear&#x2019;s Gift, a poor little Book of my own, just republished.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably the third edn. of <hi rend="italic">Heroes</hi>.</note> The two will probably come together.</p>
<p>Alas, there is no hope for us on Monday,&#x2014;God knows when there is! Mrs C. is still very feeble; never ventures even downstairs: we live in the Library place, which is only a step from her own room and fire; I have banished myself aloft to a little dressing-closet, about 8 feet square, in the rear of the house; where I sit, with fire-screen and desk, extremely quiet; hearing only the distant groan of London and the world; looking out over little gardens, sooty trees, chimney-tops and smoke, in the distance (even if it were clear weather) nothing but St. James&#x2019;s steeple in Piccadilly and the cross of the top of St. Paul&#x2019;s. I see hardly anybody this long while; read nothing but <hi rend="italic">Acta Sanctorum</hi> (old Monk Legends and Chronicles), <note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Acta Sanctorum [Lives of the Saints]</hi>, 58 vols. (chiefly pbd. at Antwerp, <date when="1643-00-00">1643</date>&#x2013;<date when="1867-00-00">1867</date>), begun by Joannes Bollandus. TC&#x2019;s notes on reading the work are in a notebook in the Bodleian Lib. (MS: Don.d. 53[2]).</note>&#x2014;their platitude, bottomless but <hi rend="italic">sincere</hi>, is a little less disgusting to me than that of most modern Books. To avoid going almost mad, I am obliged to keep <hi rend="italic">silent</hi> as a stone. Of you I think as of the beautifullest creature in all this <pb id="pg-21-131" n="21:131"/>world; divided from me by great gulphs forevermore. These are my &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Fog</hi> Thoughts&#x201C;; Thoughts in the great wintry Fog of London, and of Life. There is a certain joy in them too; a real blessedness, as of Immortality itself. But <hi rend="italic">silence</hi> is one of the conditions of it; therefore&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>
<p><foreign>Adieu</foreign> my gracious Lady: get well again forthwith, and keep well. My Wife, I expect, will let you know soon what is to be predicted of our Hampshire journey:<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >To Bay House.</note> Get you well again! <closer><salute>There or here I am ever yours</salute></closer></p>

<p>You are good and wise, and beautiful and brave; and in fact have no fault to speak of,&#x2014;except a tendency to sore-throat; which I hope you will abandon by and by! Your letter is here: and we are to hope to come, <hi rend="italic">both</hi> of us, next monday, this day week. That is the prophecy at present. My Wife hopes she will be well enough by that time; is really anxious to come, if able; and indeed I think it might actually do her good. By myself I could not get away till Saturday; and then, it seems, I should have to retire again on Tuesday, owing to the course of Political Affairs.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Parliament reopened Tues., <date when="1847-01-19">19 Jan.</date> W. B. Baring was M.P. for Thetford.</note> Better wait till Monday, and then come altogether!&#x2014; If my wife be <hi rend="italic">not</hi> able for the expedition on Monday, then I am to wait till Mr Baring&#x2019;s &#x201C;two or three days&#x201C; are over, and come down along with him. You shall put me away again, when it becomes necessary?&#x2014;will not that do? What a pity we could not all serve God, and be &#x201C;happy&#x201C; in this world (as Miss Martineau and the Unitarians prescribe); instead of partly serving the Devil, and being unhappy! Really it were cheap at the money, one would say. Alas, Alas!</p>
<p>Today there is sunshine; which, tho coupled with hoarfrost, looks far cheerfuller. Take care of yourself; be not you unwell! This, we can hope, will be the last frost of the Season; be patient with this.</p>
<p>The maid at Stanhope-Street, I think, will not send the Book till you send for it.&#x2014; I have nailed up a map of Ireland on the wall here; and today am busy with St Patrick&#x2019;s Purgatory<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A cave on Station Island in Lough Derg, Donegal, was the legendary scene of St. Patrick&#x2019;s vision of purgatory; a place of pilgrimage for 10,000 to 15,000 pilgrims each year (<hi rend="italic">Handbook for Travellers in Ireland</hi> [John Murray, 2d edn., <date when="1864-00-00">1864</date>] 81).</note> and the ancient Annals of that country. Once a week also I have to read an Irish Newspaper.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Nation</hi>, in the <date when="1847-01-02">2 Jan.</date> number of which TC would have read the darkest reports and forebodings, hardly lightened by its heading the main leader with TC&#x2019;s trans. of Goethe&#x2019;s &#x201C;Symbolum&#x201C;: &#x201C;But heard are the Voices&#x2014; / &#x2026; Work and despair not.&#x201C; It hoped that &#x201C;daily and hourly the aristocracy of Ireland are becoming sensible to the duties and rights of their nativity.&#x201C; It reported that a new &#x201C;Irish Party,&#x201C; made up of seceders from the Repeal Assoc., was being started and was attempting to make a wider appeal for a genuine Repeal policy without cooperation with the govt. The party was renamed the Confederation after <date when="1847-01-13">13 Jan.</date> because a new landlords&#x2019; organization had also taken the name of Irish Party.</note> There never was, <pb id="pg-21-132" n="21:132"/>surely, under the Sun such a spectacle as that wretched Island now exhibits! The Land, it seems to me inevitable, will all or nearly all be confiscated; the whole frame of society is not unlike tumbling to pieces.

<salute>Dear Fitzgerald,</salute>
<p>We are very glad to hear of you again at first hand; and will very willingly answer your kind inquiries after us. Spedding told me of your pious attempt to get down to Chelsea, and how it foundered: we hope to be in better luck next time you come to Town.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >FitzGerald wrote to Thackeray, ca. <date when="1847-01-15">15 Jan.</date>: &#x201C;I have intended to write to you twenty times since my return from London. First, I meant to tell you how it was I did not go to your house as I have agreed to do one Sunday; we were to have dined and gone to Gurlyle&#x2019;s [their nickname for TC]: but I was so stupified with cold I thought the best thing was to go to bed. And next day I left London&#x201C; (Terhune, <hi rend="italic">LEF</hi> 1:554). He had also apparently seen TC earlier on his visit, for he wrote, <date when="1847-01-00">early Jan.</date>: &#x201C;I saw Carlyle yesterday: he foams about Ireland at present&#x201C; (1:553).</note></p>
<p><pb id="pg-21-133" n="21:133"/>There has been an unusual confusion, and some degree of illness, in this house, for a good many weeks past;&#x2014;owing partly to the fierce weather; partly also to a <hi rend="italic">change of servants</hi> or <hi rend="italic">servant</hi>, so small a cause! Our little Scotch maid, a most invaluable little totum and factotum for eleven years back, went away at Martinmas last to a Brother she has in Dublin; and Mrs C. in her bother with the newcomers (for a series of them came, and were found condemnable) got a bad cold, was obliged to be boxed up strictly in her own room; wherefrom, as you may guess, ensued considerable puddle on the household side of things. Happily that is all over now: a good servant found at last; the Mistress able to go about (tho&#x2019; still within doors); I, seated safe aloft (in a little back room or closet, where I think you have smoked with me), very idle, but at liberty and silent,&#x2014;which is a very considerable improvement, very welcome to me indeed!&#x2014; &#x2014; We speak of a short visit to Hampshire soon; the place we were at last year, when you missed us:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >FitzGerald had been in London, <date when="1845-11-00">Nov.</date>&#x2014;<date when="1845-12-00">Dec. 1845</date>, when TC and JWC were at Bay House in Hampshire. He wrote, <date when="1845-11-22">22 Nov. 1845</date>, that he had &#x201C;not been to visit the God of Chelsea yet&#x201C; (Terhune, <hi rend="italic">LEF</hi> 1:516).</note> the country air, it is thought, may set us all up again. Early in <date when="1847-02-00">February</date>, at latest, we expect to be all back, and quiet in our old anchorage here.</p>
<p>I never thought of Bunyan at all;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >FitzGerald had presumably suggested that TC write a biography of John Bunyan.</note> &#x201C;Rhadamanthus&#x201C; would be a much likelier subject;&#x2014;in fact if there were any &#x201C;documents&#x201C; procurable about R., or any ground to go upon, he were precisely the fellow for me! The world&#x2019;s main want, as I read it, is a Rhadamanthus, at this very time. Such an all-pervading life-element of Cant, from Nadir up to Zenith an illimitable ocean of Cant, in which all men and institutions live, move, and have their highly paralytic being,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Acts 17:28.</note>&#x2014;truly it were well worth while to rend it asunder one good time, to burn it up with Heaven&#x2019;s Lightning, if one could, and send <hi rend="italic">it</hi> back to the Devil, in the shape of stinking gas which it is! Rhadamanthus alone is fit for such a thing;&#x2014;and perhaps the gods will send him, one day. If not in Heaven&#x2019;s fire, then in Hellfire, all that accursed twaddle <hi rend="italic">will,</hi> one day, be burnt up: of that I am at all times sure enough!&#x2014;</p>
<p>But the truth is, I for my own part am utterly idle, of late months, or as good as idle; merely reading great qua<supplied>[n]</supplied>tities<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> of omitted Books,&#x2014;with unspeakable detestation, for most part; Chesterfield, Mahon, &#x26;c &#x26;c,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Philip Dormer Stanhope (<date when="1694-00-00">1694</date>&#x2013;<date when="1773-00-00">1773</date>), 4th earl of Chesterfield, politician and man of letters, author of <hi rend="italic">Letters to His Son</hi>, 2 vols.

Literature generally seems to me rather a sorry business, in my splenetic humour; not very clearly discriminated from a poor shallow jugglery and Merry-Andrewism, in the times we are getting into! I know feats I could like far better to do than write Books. However, as we have no other craft, I suppose we shall have to resume it in the course of time, if we last long.</p>
<p>Almost the only supportable reading I have got into has been, now and then, little snatches of old History, especially by contemporaries. Do you know the <hi rend="italic">Acta Sanctorum</hi>,&#x2014;upwards of 50 huge folios, with clasps; which the Jesuits (<hi rend="italic">Bollandists</hi>, so called from one Bollandus who began it) have been busy compiling and collecting now, in slow sequence, for above 150 years? It is in the London Library: a huge mass of dross, but with real bits of gold in it. The Life of St Columba (a Derry Irishman) in the poor little Island of I (<hi rend="italic">Ee</hi>) 1200 years ago;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >St. Columba (ca. 521&#x2013;97) founded a monastery on the islands of Iona, and others in Dalriada, W Scotland; preached to the Picts. Iona is Celtic for &#x201C;the island of Hi,&#x201C; and TC&#x2019;s parenthetical &#x201C;(Ee)&#x201C; indicates the pronunciation.</note> actually extant there with such a strange old world round him: I have got some real satisfaction out of St Columba, well read.&#x2014; As you are an earnest soul, and delight in old History too, suppose you try there a little. The Lives of the <hi rend="italic">British</hi> Saints; these, if done by contemporaries, are really worth looking at. And the Jesuit Editors have really done their part very tolerably well. On the whole I am going to look farther in that huge Book. <hi rend="italic">Twysden</hi> too, do you know <hi rend="italic">Twysden?</hi> Some ten old English Monk Histories, with Selden&#x2019;s Preface, in <date when="1652-00-00">1652</date>: I am getting real good of <hi rend="italic">Twysden</hi>.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sir Roger Twysden (<date when="1597-00-00">1597</date>&#x2013;<date when="1672-00-00">1672</date>), English historical antiquary, author of <hi rend="italic">Historiae Anglicanae Scriptores X</hi> (<date when="1652-00-00">1652</date>). John Selden (<date when="1584-00-00">1584</date>&#x2013;<date when="1654-00-00">1654</date>), jurist, antiquary, and politician, wrote a pref. and collated some of the MSS for Twysden&#x2019;s pioneering work.</note> Truly I think if you persist in your old tastes, you might as well try in some of those sources.</p>
<p>Ireland is a perpetual misery to me; lies like a kind of nightmare on my thoughts, little as I personally have to do with it. Certainly men ought to &#x201C;subscribe&#x201C;;&#x2014;those that have pity for their starving fellow creatures, what <hi rend="italic">less</hi> can they do than give a little money?<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >As the <hi rend="italic">Nation</hi> reported, <date when="1847-01-09">9 Jan.</date>, &#x201C;a committee had been founded in London for the relief of distress in Ireland,&#x201C; to which the queen had given &#xa3;2,000.</note> Yet I confess it seems to me subscription, to never such an extent, will do next to no good at all. For it is as if, by this failure of potatoes, and ability of the people to <hi rend="italic">live</hi> on any terms, the general high-built, long established <hi rend="italic">Imposture</hi> of Irish Existence and Society were frightfully crashing down into one huge welter of ruin,&#x2014;never (thank God, never) to be built up again on the old footing any <pb id="pg-21-135" n="21:135"/>more. If the people of property <hi rend="italic">can</hi> contrive ways of really guiding and feeding the population? that is the problem! If they cannot,&#x2014;God Almighty is saying to them very audibly, Then depart ye, disappear!&#x2014; &#x2014; <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign> dear F.; you see my paper is done, for this time!</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Tonight, before the Newspapers go, tho&#x2019; we are in an extreme degree of bustle, I must write you a word to mark what we are about. The journey to Alverstoke still holds; Jane, having engaged for it, will go thro&#x2019; with the affair, tho&#x2019; I for my part have all along rather held back, not regarding it as quite unquestionable. We are to go tomorrow at half past twelve; an Express Train carries us to Gosport in two hours, and there a carriage is to be waiting for us;&#x2014;we will go <hi rend="italic">to</hi> the Railway in a Nodes <hi rend="italic">fly,</hi> carry a big bottle of hot-water for the feet, and take all manner of pains as to wrappage: we may hope in this way to arrive with little damage.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC is writing on Sun.

Nothing but dreary crawling half-frost, &#x201C;frozen fog&#x201C; as I call it; and the face of the sun not to be seen at all.&#x2014; Jane has no express <hi rend="italic">cold</hi> now left; but cannot <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi> to any healthy extent, and is otherwise in the poor pining condition which that betokens, which is usually the fruit of cold weather in her case. Our new servant continues to give satisfaction. I myself am well enough in health; but unfavourably situated otherwise in the middle of these confusions. I have been up in the little <hi rend="italic">back closet</hi> of late for two weeks,&#x2014;where we used to smoke, you remember: I have been reading old <hi rend="italic">Acta Sanctorum</hi> &#x26;c, and have had many things to think of, tho&#x2019; not <hi rend="italic">writing</hi> on anything, far enough from writing!

<salute>My dear good Mother,</salute>
<p>We are just in the agony of getting off, all busy packing &#x26;c &#x26;c: and here, before going, I will send you a little article called a &#x201C;Bosom-friend,&#x201C; which I have had lying waiting for you this while past. You put it within your stays; you will find it a warm kind of thing, and will remember me as you wear it.</p>
<p>We are in tolerable heart for travelling; have a day as good as we could look for in this time; calm, tho&#x2019; <hi rend="italic">grey:</hi> we hope to get into sunshine when we have left the London region.&#x2014; I will write you the second post after this, to say how we have fared,&#x2014;that is to say, if the <hi rend="italic">post</hi> at Alverstoke permit such expedition.</p>
<p>This Letter came to the Dr this morning. I leave <hi rend="italic">his</hi> Address here with the Postman too.&#x2014; Take care of yourself, dear Mother! <foreign>Adieu</foreign> to one and all of you,&#x2014;for two posts, we hope!</p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I rather fear I am in a little too late today to keep my word; however, I have still hope that there will yet be a communication with the Post, therefore I write as the best I can.</p>
<p>We got quite safe down yesterday; comfortably and without the smallest accident; had the carriage all to ourselves, and did the whole 80 miles in two hours time. The day was dim, silent, and decidedly cold: but Jane was wrapped in such a way as to <hi rend="italic">exclude</hi> frost: she never complained of cold; but sat quite quiet, and even <hi rend="italic">fell asleep</hi> for half an hour among her plaids! The Lady&#x2019;s Carriage was duly waiting for us; a quiet cordial welcome was duly waiting: and so here we are, established for a week or two. Jane, in spite of the new bed says she slept better last night than usual; I myself did <pb id="pg-21-139" n="21:139"/>not make much of a sleep in my little warm <hi rend="italic">crib</hi> (but that was not <hi rend="italic">its</hi> fault); nevertheless I too seem to feel a little fresher today. There is no vestige of &#x201C;sunshine&#x201C;! The country is grey, calm, dry; really very agreeable when one can walk all day, as I have been doing, with one&#x2019;s plaid on, by the shore of the sea, with tobacco to smoke! I persuade myself we shall do very well here, and really gather some new strength, especially poor Jane who is really quite <hi rend="italic">numbed</hi>, as it were, with this long continued dark hard weather. We are the <hi rend="italic">quietest</hi> party in the world; in fact absolutely nobody but the Lady Harriet herself and we two at present, Baring having gone off this morning (till Saturday next) to attend the opening of Parliament. A certain Lady Anne Charteris (also an acquaintance of ours,&#x2014;her husband is also gone off today to Parl<hi rend="italic">t</hi>) lives in a Sea-cottage close by: she is our only &#x201C;neighbour,&#x201C;&#x2014;has been with Jane all morning, while I went out to call for Dr Richardson,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sir John Richardson.</note> a wealthy Dumfries man, whom John knows,&#x2014;whom I have found accordingly.&#x2014; &#x2014; This, dear Mother, is all I have of &#x201C;news&#x201C;; not by any means all I had to say: no, but the <hi rend="italic">pen</hi> is deplorable, the little table <hi rend="italic">shakes</hi>, and indeed the time and paper are done! Bid Jack write to me,&#x2014;one word to say that you are well, how precious would it be! Give my affectionate regards to him, to Jamie and Isabella,&#x2014;and keep out of the cold, dear Mother.&#x2014;&#x2014; <closer><salute>Ever yours</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name></p>

<salute>Dear Craik,</salute>
<p>There is a young Lady Anne Charteris in this immediate neighbourhood, who has need of a certain German Book now standing on our shelves at Chelsea, if there could a man be found to take it successfully down. As usual we pitch upon you for the man:&#x2014;the Book is Tieck&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Phantasus</hi>, which I am afraid will cost some disagreeable minutes, but which nevertheless I doubt not you will perservere till you find.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ludwig Tieck, <hi rend="italic">Phantasus</hi>, a compendium of his shorter prose works, originally pbd. in 3 vols., <date when="1812-00-00">1812</date>&#x2013;<date when="1817-00-00">17</date>.</note> The Book Tieck&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Werke</hi> (Tieck&#x2019;s Works), an extremely dim-looking Book, in 7 or 8 volumes; bound in a dirty marled green <hi rend="italic">paper</hi> (pamphlet-wise merely), as unfortunately many of my German Books are;&#x2014;does indubitably stand on one of the shelves in our upper room (which you know well by this time); I think it is in the compartment to the <hi rend="italic">left</hi> of the fire-place when you stand looking at <pb id="pg-21-140" n="21:140"/>the fire; there is a <hi rend="italic">Schiller</hi> there too, and probably there are others, all in the same dirty green paper binding: however, in looking to the <hi rend="italic">inside</hi>, you will easily discover which is <hi rend="italic">Tieck</hi>, and then farther what part of him is <hi rend="italic">Phantasus</hi>,&#x2014;some two volumes, I think, not far from the beginning.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >At the Carlyle House, Chelsea, vols. 4 and 5 of Tieck&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Schriften</hi>, 10 vols. (Berlin, <date when="1828-00-00">1828</date>), containing <hi rend="italic">Phantasus</hi>, are missing. The reference is probably to a collected works of Schiller.</note> Pray persist till you find it; for I assure you it is there!&#x2014; And then if, in whatever way is easiest for you, you would have it conveyed to</p>
<p>Hon. W. B. Baring / 12. Gt. Stanhope Street (Stanhope Gate) with Lady Anne Charteris&#x2019;s name, or our name, anywhere appended as ulterior indication,&#x2014;all this before friday night: then on Saturday we should have the Book from Mr Baring in person, and all would be completed in that small department.&#x2014; I confess the job does look a little complex: but unless you will do it who other has any chance?&#x2014;</p>
<p>We got down hither handsomely enough on Monday; yesterday Mrs C. felt a little better, but today again does not brag. We are very quiet, however; have a climate rather better than yours, free from <hi rend="italic">smoke</hi> at least; and really ought to improve a little. For my own there I have got more cold in the meanwhile; but mean to walk it off again.&#x2014; Your wonderful <hi rend="italic">Mudie</hi> Announcement lay on the table this morning;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Evidently referring to Mrs. Robert Mudie and her da.

<salute>Dearest Helen</salute>
<p>Here I am then&#x2014;not dead&#x2014;nor dying&#x2014;just yet. On the whole better <hi rend="italic">every way</hi> than I had room to expect. My nervousness at starting was &#x201C;rather exquisite&#x201C;&#x2014; Every body had taken such <hi rend="italic">solemn</hi> leave of me that I felt much as tho getting into a fly for the purpose of going to be executed&#x2014;then the feeling of a <hi rend="italic">bonnet</hi> on my head. &#x26;c &#x26;c all that was so new to me&#x2014;and the thought of what would become of me if I arrived unable to keep up appearances and the thought&#x2014;worst of all alas!&#x2014;how things would go on <hi rend="italic">in another department!</hi> &#x2014;But all has gone better than I expected&#x2014; My black blanket coat-cloak&#x2014;with the woolen jacket under it effectually kept all cold from my body and my <hi rend="italic">respirator</hi> hindered any from entering in&#x2014; In fact before I had been half an hour on the railway&#x2014;what with the movement and what with being worn out by <hi rend="small-caps">the violence of my emotions</hi> I fell fast asleep and slept to the station!! I who could not sleep like a christian in my own comfortable red bed!</p>
<p>I arrived here hardly so tired as I have been on getting up from the sofa of late weeks to make tea&#x2014;</p>
<p>Lady H received me most kindly with a certain recognition of my <hi rend="italic">weak</hi> state&#x2014;hardly to have been hoped from her&#x2014; She actually ordered me some hot soup&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">before</hi> dinner&#x2014;and had assigned <hi rend="italic">me</hi> the largest bedroom this time and C my old little one&#x2014; There is no soul here but herself&#x2014; Lady Anne Charteris is in the neighbouring house and comes in <hi rend="italic">during the</hi> <hi rend="small-caps">heat</hi> of the day&#x2014;but she is a prisoner after sunset&#x2014; &#x2014; Mr Baring and Mr Charteris went up to London yesterday morning&#x2014;not to return till the end of the week&#x2014; C Buller will come every Saturday and stay till Monday&#x2014;</p>
<p>&#x2014;I do not go out here either&#x2014;it feels quite as cold as in London and I have got some cold <hi rend="italic">in my head</hi> but that is nothing to cold in my <hi rend="italic">left lung</hi>. Nothing can exceed Lady H&#x2019;s <hi rend="small-caps">tact</hi> so far&#x2014;and I feel very grateful to her&#x2014;as I am not <hi rend="italic">up to</hi> much <hi rend="italic">agitation</hi> just now&#x2014; Many thanks dear for your punctual discharge of my commissions&#x2014;satisfactory in all but the <hi rend="italic">drawing out of the bill</hi> which cannot stand as it is&#x2014;the beautiful blue and white ribband I will take as a present and be thankful but that is all I can take on <pb id="pg-21-142" n="21:142"/><hi rend="italic">that</hi> principle&#x2014; Never mind the <foreign><hi rend="italic">auricolas</hi></foreign>&#x2014;I shall get <hi rend="italic">thro the thing</hi> without <hi rend="italic">them</hi>&#x2014; I do not know how long we shall s<supplied>[t]</supplied>ay<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> Lady H does not mean to go to Town till the <date when="1847-03-01">1s<hi rend="italic">t</hi> of March</date>&#x2014;and &#x201C;really <hi rend="italic">does</hi> hope that now I <hi rend="italic">am</hi> here, I will stay&#x2014;and <hi rend="italic">let Mr C go back by himself if he wishes it&#x2014;he might surely spare me a while for my good</hi>.&#x201C; She will read no german with him&#x2014;&#x201C;Now that her health is so improved she has no longer any pretence for giving up society&#x2014;and she cannot carry on <hi rend="italic">that</hi> and find time for studying languages&#x201C;&#x2014; Moreover she has got a green parrot&#x2014;to which she pays the most marked attentions even in spite of his calling it a <hi rend="italic">green chimera</hi>&#x2014; And the <hi rend="italic">Parrot</hi> does not mind interrupting <hi rend="italic">him</hi> when he is speaking&#x2014;does not fear to <hi rend="italic">speak thro him</hi> (as that phrase is) and her Ladyship <hi rend="italic">listens to the parrot</hi>&#x2014;even when C is saying the most sensible things!&#x2014; By Heaven she is <hi rend="italic">the very cleverest</hi> woman I ever saw or heard of&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">she can</hi> do what she wills with her own&#x2014; I am perfectly certain there is not a created being alive whom she could not gain within twenty four hours after she set her mind to it&#x2014; Just witness myself&#x2014;how she plies <hi rend="italic">me</hi> round her little finger whenever she sees I am taking a reactionary turn&#x2014;</p>

<p><salute><hi rend="small-caps">My dear Mrs</hi>. <hi rend="small-caps">Welsh</hi>,&#x2014;</salute>Your letter found me just recovering from a long and serious illness, and projecting a visit into Hampshire, not without considerable apprehension of being laid up anew in my friend&#x2019;s house, a risk which nothing but the certainty that I could never get stronger by staying shut up in London gave me courage to front.&#x2014; It is bad enough to be ill at home and a plague to ones own people&#x2014;but I never yet found a friends house so constituted that however one might like to live in it <hi rend="italic">well</hi>; one could think of taking to bed in it without a shudder. But the journey did me no harm&#x2014;tho&#x2019; eighty miles it was accomplished in two hours!! and what with a coat made of <hi rend="italic">Scotch-blankets died black</hi> and a <hi rend="italic">respirator</hi> and a pan of hot water at my feet no cold got near me&#x2014;and ever since I arrived I have been getting better&#x2014;resuming my old habits of <hi rend="italic">sleeping</hi> and <hi rend="italic">eating</hi> which I had almost wholly discontinued. The house I am living in is within a stonecast of the sea right opposite to Osborne in the Isle of Wight&#x2014;and indeed one feels in it much as tho one were living <hi rend="italic">on</hi> some magnificent Cleopatra&#x2019;s barge&#x2014;there are so many windows in it looking out on the sea and mirrors reflecting the prospect from these windows, so that wherever one turns there is always sea sea. In summer it must be charming&#x2014;but in this weather I could do with less display of cold water. For the rest one has all in the shape of accommodation that money and taste can do for one&#x2014;to read here of the starving Irish or starving anything is like a fairy tale&#x2014;and what is not common in a great House we have for the moment perfect quiet, the gentlemen who are usually here being all off to the Parliament&#x2014;and nobody left but Lady Harriet herself who likes quietness as well as we do&#x2014;when she can get it which is seldom enough.&#x2014; We shall probably stay till the end of February and then return to Chelsea.</p>
<p>I had a great domestic calamity some two months ago which was indeed the immediate occasion of my illness&#x2014;a maid who had been with me eleven years and took entire charge of my house and self was invited to Dublin by a prosperous brother to keep house for him&#x2014; He is making very rich as a manufacturer of coach-fringe and had suddenly bethought him of having this sister to be his servant&#x2014;I fancy&#x2014;not his &#x2018;Mistress&#x2019; as she flattered herself. And it was too much to expect that her human nature could resist such tempting offer. So off she went not without tears to leave <pb id="pg-21-144" n="21:144"/>me&#x2014;and I entered into possession of a young woman selected for me in Edinr by our old Haddington Betty.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Braid.</note> Betty has taken into the Free Church and I fear has lost her once excellent judgment in it for the creature she sent me turned out to have nothing earthly but &#x2018;free grace&#x2019; plenty of <hi rend="italic">that</hi>&#x2014; but no &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">works</hi>&#x2019; nor disposition to acquire any. She informed me to my horror that she had been partly educated at religious meetings held by my Aunt Anne!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Welsh.</note> Had I known <hi rend="italic">that</hi> at first she should never have sailed to London at <hi rend="italic">my</hi> expense. In trying to get her to do her work&#x2014;and doing it for her when she could not or would not; I caught the dreadful cold which confined me nearly a month to bed and from which I am only now emerging&#x2014; Just a fortnight after her arrival&#x2014;whilst I was lying at death&#x2019;s door&#x2014;a doctor seeing me every day&#x2014;she sent me word by my cousin<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Helen Welsh.</note> one night that if I did not let her go away she &#x2018;would <hi rend="italic">take fits</hi>&#x2014;and <hi rend="italic">keep her bed for a year</hi> as she had done once before in a place she did not like&#x2019;!! <hi rend="italic">One</hi> in bed was enough at a time and so next morning a <hi rend="italic">Sunday morning</hi> (Oh my Aunt Anne!) she went her ways dressed out like a street walker&#x2014;in the finest spirits&#x2014;leaving me as I have said in bed&#x2014;no servant in the house&#x2014;a visitor who had to turn herself into a servant&#x2014;and so full was she of free grace that it never once seemed to cross her mind that there was no reason in justice that I should have paid two guineas&#x2014;to afford <hi rend="italic">her</hi> an opportunity of paying a visit to some cousins she had in London!&#x2014; Defend me from servants educated by religious Ladies they are all alike&#x2014; I have now got a little English woman who promises to do well enough&#x2014;and whom I think none the worse of that she cleans her grate and washes her dishes on Sunday all the same as on other days of the week!</p>
<p>I hope your Edinr scheme will turn out well<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Apparently to return from Ireland, where she was a governess.</note>&#x2014;indeed there is little fear but it will as you always seem to take in your ground wisely and circumspectly&#x2014;</p>
<p>Oh dear me! I often think of you when I see people pretending to superior minds ruining their outlooks by the extravagance of their exactions from Destiny and keeping themselves in a ferment all their lives that which profiteth not&#x2014; The longer I live the more deeply do I feel convinced that <hi rend="italic">money</hi> beyond what gives the bare necessaries of life does good to no one and to many great harm&#x2014; I suppose there is not a servant in this house who has not every day more luxuries of all kinds than you or I ever had or dreamt of having in our own houses&#x2014;and see what they make of it! greedy, selfish, stupid! looked upon as necessary evils&#x2014;looking upon their employers as their natural enemies&#x2014;a Scotch <foreign>Byrewoman</foreign><note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cow woman.</note> with forty <pb id="pg-21-145" n="21:145"/>shillings a year who had a respect for her mistress and a love for her beasts was better off than these.&#x2014; At this moment I know one Lady and two gentlemen who are made utterly wretched by the simple fact of having more money than they know what to do with, indeed two of the three have gone <hi rend="italic">mad</hi> and the third always looks to me as tho he would commit suicide some day. He was an active and esteemed officer, gay and busy when he became promoted to four thousand a year&#x2014;left the army and found himself without occupation, and with power to gratify all his whims&#x2014; Now he makes one&#x2019;s blood cold to look at him!<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably Anthony Sterling, his wife, and his father.</note>&#x2014; Do not be so long of writing to me again. &#x2014;I am always so glad to hear of your welfare.</p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>By a Letter we had yesterday from Miss Fuller, who is now in Paris, we learn that she has heard from Mr Emerson, and among other things, got authority from him to ask you for certain Copies of his Poems,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Advts. in the <hi rend="italic">Athenaeum</hi>, <date when="1846-12-12">12 Dec. 1846</date> and <date when="1847-01-30">30 Jan.</date>, both state that Emerson&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> were pbd. by Chapman on &#x201C;this day.&#x201C; The first American edn. was pbd. late <date when="1846-12-00">Dec. 1846</date> or early <date when="1847-01-00">Jan. 1847</date>.

No doubt you know good ways of conveyance to Paris: Miss Fuller&#x2019;s Address there is, &#x201C;All&#xE9;e d&#x2019;Antin N<hi rend="italic">o</hi> 23&#x201C;; or, she says, it will answer to send the Parcel to the care of &#x201C;Hottinguer &#x26; C<hi rend="italic">o</hi>&#x201C; (if I decipher right) &#x201C;Rue Berg&#xE8;re,&#x201C; to which House her Letters are usually directed.&#x2014;&#x2014; May I beg that you would, in one or the other of these ways, despatch the little Parcel for the Lady, and be so kind as announce, to me or to her, which way you have taken, and when the arrival is likely to be.</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Thanks for your Letter, which lay waiting for <supplied>[me]</supplied><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> on the hall table this morning; I am very glad to hear that there is nothing wrong yet at Scotsbrig, now while so much in other quarters is wrong. Poor Mrs Carlyle<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The mother or wife of Robert Carlyle of Waterbeck. In a letter to his mother, [<date when="1847-02-24">24 Feb.</date>], John Carlyle wrote from Chelsea: &#x201C;From Waterbeck I had also a letter &#x2026; indicating that Mrs Carlyle continues improving gradually, &#x26; gets out a little&#x201C; (MS: Yale).</note> seems to have been in a dangerous way; and, I suppose, must take this as an intimation that she has a course of weak health to look for in time coming. Did I ever tell you that old Mr Buller too had a stroke of palsy lately, since they returned to England? He is said to be nearly altogether recovered; but they still &#x201C;forbid him chess, &#x201C; which I suppose indicates a very uncertain state of nerves. They are in Devonshire ever since their return; Mrs Buller is said to have got much benefit from her Italian sojourn.&#x2014;</p>
<p>Poor Jenny&#x2019;s little lassie seems to have been in a dangerous condition for <pb id="pg-21-148" n="21:148"/>some days, and must have given her Mother much anxiety. You speak twice about sending money to Jenny; I left a commission with Jean to apprise me if any pressure came in that respect, but she has not yet thought necessary to write: I am well aware the year is much dearer than usual; if you, who are on the spot and know the details, can inform me <hi rend="italic">what</hi> increase of income would be rational and proper this year, I will with great promptitude transmit my part of it whensoever the right time is.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC and John Carlyle had last increased Janet Hanning&#x2019;s allowance, paid semiannually, a year previously; see <ref target="volume-20/lt-18460207-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1846-02-07">7 Feb.</date> or <date when="1846-02-08">8 Feb. 1846</date></ref>. Before that it had been &#xa3;10 p.a.</note></p>
<p>We have terribly <hi rend="italic">windy</hi> weather here; otherwise genial and of mild temperature. We are doing very tolerably well: in the end of last week Jane took sore-throat; nobody could well say why; ulcerated sore-throat; and for three days she had a very bad time of it; but now the disorder is quite gone, and she is visibly better than before for a long time past. I myself do little reading, little of anything; rove about in silence among the <hi rend="italic">whins</hi> and shingle-beaches here; and I suppose shall get profit in the long run.&#x2014; Richardson came to see Jane&#x2019;s throat yesterday; but it was then <hi rend="italic">well:</hi> he was here to dine on Saturday last; a man worthy to be held in real esteem by men. We have no other neighbour thro&#x2019; the week, except the Charterises (a beautiful young pair of people, useless to me, but capable of playing chess with Jane): on Saturday, regularly, Baring returns from Parl<hi rend="italic">t</hi>, with news and companions; and till Monday or Tuesday again there is a considerable <hi rend="italic">noise</hi>,&#x2014;which makes the silence welcomer. Last Saturday we had Buller, Milnes, and one Ellis (the Highland Laird they were visiting last year) a highly plausible old Scotch-American, most copious courteous in speech,&#x2014;somewhat of a Humbug withal.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edward Ellice, the elder (<sic><date when="1781-00-00">1781</date></sic><corr><date when="1783-00-00">1783</date></corr>&#x2013;<date when="1863-00-00">1863</date>; <ref target="volume-21/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/8650"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), politician; b.

<p>I had this Letter yesterday from Varnhagen, which is hardly worth sending.

<salute>Dearest Babbie</salute>
<p>&#x201C;Every age is an age of Miracle&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi> 255ff. and <hi rend="italic">All&#x2019;s Well</hi> 2.3.</note>&#x2014;and <hi rend="italic">that</hi> is the only account I can give of my silence towards you this long while&#x2014; During the time of Helen&#x2019;s deplorable visit at Chelsea, I trusted to <hi rend="italic">her</hi> telling of me the little that was to be told&#x2014;that I was ill namely&#x2014;a thing which one gets weary of telling of oneself&#x2014;ring what changes on it one will. Then her departure was followed up by the introduction of a new element into our life in the shape of one Anne Brown (A harmless name enough) and every new element into <hi rend="italic">our</hi> life produces the result of a spoonful of tartaric acid into a tumbler of carbonate of soda-water&#x2014;the everfescence for a time is prodiguous!&#x2014; A mercy if it do not split the tumbler! In The present instance however the combination has effected itself and <hi rend="italic">settled down</hi> sooner than could have been hoped&#x2014;Anne Brown is a very orderly, docile, good humoured and I think well conducted little woman&#x2014;whom I may be able to get on with in peace for many years&#x2014;not without a great increase of expenditure&#x2014;as she does not <hi rend="italic">do the washing</hi>&#x2014;but if we have money enough to be rid of that complication I do not see how it could be better employed&#x2014;It was little I could do in the way of setting her a-going&#x2014;continuing so weak&#x2014;and unable to face the cold even in passing between my own bedroom and the Library&#x2014;still my mind needed to be always at work upon her for the first week&#x2014;and just when I was beginning to feel less fussed came new invitation from Alverstoke exciting all manner of agitations The idea of setting out for this Place to lead the life of last winter&#x2014;in my actual state of weakness&#x2014;to fall ill perhaps and be laid up in bed here! was too awful&#x2014; nevertheless after several refusals I had to give in&#x2014;for the Lady being all alone in the House for most part&#x2014;(M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Baring only coming down&#x2014;with Charles Buller and others for the Saturdays and Sundays) she could not have C to stay with her alone by their two selves without <hi rend="italic">me</hi>&#x2014;and when she gave him so to understand he made a sort of point of <hi rend="italic">my</hi> going&#x2014;and I was too <hi rend="italic">proud</hi> to stand in the way with my sickness or anything else. So here we are! I walked straight out of my two hot rooms into a <hi rend="italic">fly</hi> which deposited me at the Railway and Lady H&#x2019;s carriage met me at the end and brought me safe here&#x2014; For the first two or three days I thought I had reason to congratulate myself on having caught no new cold and on having had <hi rend="italic">nothing to encounter</hi> which I was not quite <hi rend="italic">up to</hi>&#x2014; When Lady H <pb id="pg-21-150" n="21:150"/>likes to <hi rend="italic">manage</hi> me she is always able to do so&#x2014;and a greater proof of her diplomacy could not be given than the fact that she can wind <hi rend="italic">me</hi> about as she pleases&#x2014;even now&#x2014;&#x2014; Well! I thought it was good to have set out so desperate&#x2014;a desperate person is <hi rend="italic">never disappointed</hi> and my chance on a grain or two of good he did not expect! On friday night at the door of my bedroom I said to her Ladyship I feel strangely well and calm. I could not have believed I should have been so well in three days&#x2014;and I went to sleep in my magnificent Canopy-bed&#x2014;without curtains where one lies exposed to the whole world&#x2014;and in half an hour&#x2019;s time I awoke with strange sensations in my throat and everywhere And the rest of that night I spent in absolute torment&#x2014; In the morning when daylight came I found that I had got as pretty an ulcerated sore throat as one could wish <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to see&#x2014;and all these days I have been mostly in bed&#x2014; Now I am better again&#x2014; And Sir J Richardson (the man who killed the Indian)<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On Sir John Franklin&#x2019;s expedition to the Canadian Arctic coast, <date when="1819-00-00">1819</date>&#x2013;<date when="1822-00-00">22</date>, Richardson, who served as surgeon and naturalist, was compelled in self-defense to shoot an Iroquois boatman who had murdered a midshipman.</note> whom C fetched to see me tells me it seems to be chiefly <hi rend="italic">indejestion</hi> that ails me the throat &#x26;c being merely s<supplied>[y]</supplied>mptoms<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> of that&#x2014; I knew <hi rend="italic">that</hi> before&#x2014;but can anyone tell me how to get my digestion set to rights&#x2014;under the circumstance I do not know how long we shall stay&#x2014;her Ladyship invited me for so long as she should be here herself that is till the <date when="1847-03-01">first of March</date>&#x2014;but seemed to expect that C would go back earlier and leave me!!

<salute>Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I might have written yesterday, had I recollected what first struck me this morning, that you lose a post for Liverpool by our southern position here: however I hope this will still find you safe in Maryland street, in which neighbourhood I suppose you to be for the last four-and-twenty hours. At Manchester you will find Espinasse, and little Ballantyne; Miss Jewsbury can point out their location; or you may ascertain at once by going to the &#x201C;Examiner-Newspaper Office.&#x201C; Espinasse was with us lately in London, arranging about certain German Translations he is to be employed in. If you think of going round by Leeds and Bradford, I will send you the Introductory Notes at any time you like.</p>
<p>I hope we shall be in Town by the time you arrive: at all events, you will find a house with rooms in it, and a little handy maid who will be ready to receive you, if you give us warning so as to announce your approach. T. Erskine is in London (55. Baker Street), and the Chorleys and many other old acquaintances of yours.</p>
<p>There is nothing yet settled about the time of our leaving this place. I rather think the people themselves have a vague eye to the very end of this <pb id="pg-21-153" n="21:153"/>Month, for the Lady is not to quit till the <date when="1847-03-01">first of March</date>: but that, I rather imagine, may for us be too long a date; idleness, tho&#x2019; coupled with fine weather and other adjuncts, will not do for too long. Meanwhile Jane seems decidedly to improve; is indeed wonderfully well at present, tho&#x2019; unable to get out except in favourable hours of sunshine; I myself seemed on the improving hand last week; but for the last few days I have got into sleeplessness again, and have not much to say on that subject. Baring is this moment off to Town; to return on Saturday with Lords Lansdown, Clarendon<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George W. F.

I read all forenoon (with a fair chance for smoking too); then a walk by the quiet beach, in sight of the Steamers &#x26; skiffs; then dinner: talk, reading, and the other etceteras: with good sleep and health it might be very pleasant. I am engaged in no writing, am not strictly meditating any. My own thoughts, often enough of a sombre and abstruse enough complexion, are company enough for me. Frequently I think of getting away from London now altogether: I never till within the last two years felt habitually that I was <hi rend="italic">old</hi>, actually not far from being ended,&#x2014;my poor portion, such as it was, of this grand Universe not far from <hi rend="italic">spent!</hi> It is a thought unspeakably impressive; sad, and yet great, almost godlike.&#x2014;</p>

Jane is in great distress about him.</p>
<p>You must make many kind compliments for me at Maryland Street; to Mr Welsh and all the rest,&#x2014;especially to Helen my fellow-passenger in that astonishing <hi rend="italic">Slow-Coach</hi>, which neither of <supplied>[us]</supplied><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> will ever forget!

<salute>Dearest Helen</salute>
<p>I had just reached the <foreign><hi rend="italic">Ultima Thule</hi></foreign> of my patience when your letter arrived and was on the point of making my individual protest against your negligence&#x2014; Poor little woman! you were not <hi rend="italic">negligent</hi> the least in the world&#x2014;only still over-ridden with the Curse of Servants&#x2014;you may think whether my own so recent and striking experiences do not enable me to give you <hi rend="italic">intelligent</hi> sympathy!&#x2014; I saw advertised in the newspapers since I came here a book entitled &#x201C;Search after a good servant by one who has been nearly driven out of her senses by bad ones&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">The Greatest Plague of Life or The Adventures of a Lady in Search of a Good Servant By One Who has been &#x201C;Almost Worried to Death,&#x201C;</hi> pbd. in 6 pts. from <date when="1847-02-01">1 Feb.</date>, illus.

I had a letter from Susan Hunter a week ago who had been to see Betty and was told by her that the reason Isabella gave for going away was that we received visitors on the Lord&#x2019;s day!!!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Susan Stirling, Betty Braid.</note>&#x2014;which Betty was extremely sorry to hear&#x2014;and which explains the pious exhortations in her last letter to me that I would remember the Sabbath! &#x201C;The devil fly away with&#x201C; hypocrites!

<salute><hi rend="small-caps">Dear Fitzgerald</hi>,</salute>
<p>Here is a strange <hi rend="italic">rusty</hi> old Yarmouth gentleman, who has sent me a letter about Civil&#x2014;war matters; which letter I now enclose to you.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >W. Squire wrote from Gt. Yarmouth, <date when="1847-01-29">29 Jan.</date>, to say that, having admired <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi>, he wished to report to TC that he possessed &#x201C;certain papers relating to the time of the troubles written by one who rode with Oliver&#x201C; and that, although thinking of publishing them one day, he in the meantime was sending notes and copies of letters pertinent to certain passages in TC&#x2019;s biography that his papers would clarify. William Squire (<date when="1809-00-00">1809</date>&#x2013;<date when="1880-00-00">80</date>), eldest of twelve children of a Norwich merchant. Matthew Squire (d. <date when="1837-00-00">1837</date>); educ. Oundle School; m., <date when="1840-00-00">1840</date>, Elizabeth Playters (d. <date when="1851-00-00">1851</date>), widow of an army officer, Robert Moore (m., <date when="1825-00-00">1825</date>), heiress to landed property in Norfolk from her father (d. <date when="1832-00-00">1832</date>), and mother of several children (four by <date when="1832-00-00">1832</date>); interested in archaeology and antiquarian subjects; had a local reputation as a hoaxer. He was staying in Yarmouth on account of his wife&#x2019;s health at the time of his correspondence with TC. After her death he seems to have become impoverished and then emigrated to New Zealand, where he died. Overloyal Carlyleans have often been unwilling to discuss the &#x201C;Squire Papers&#x201C; or admit that they were forgeries, but there is now no question of this. For an account of TC&#x2019;s dealing with the Squire forgeries, see Ryals, <hi rend="italic">Squire</hi>.</note> One of the rustiest old gentlemen I have lately met with; but, to all appearance, possessed of curious Papers, which ought to be inquired into! I have written to thank him for the notice about Young Oliver&#x2019;s death;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Oliver Cromwell (<date when="1623-00-00">1623</date>&#x2013;<date when="1644-00-00">44</date>), the Protector&#x2019;s son; see <ref target="volume-18/lt-18441012-TC-JAC-01"><sic>18:236</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1844-10-12">12 Oct. 1844</date></corr></ref>. Squire reported that his &#x201C;MS&#x201C; described skirmishing before the battle of Marston Moor, <date when="1644-07-02">2 July 1644</date>, and said that &#x201C;Oliver looked sad and wearyed for he had had a sad loss young Oliver got killed to death not long before,&#x201C; not far away at Knaresborough. It is a good example of Squire&#x2019;s guile and how it was eventually exposed by later discoveries. TC had written: &#x201C;&#x2018;Cornet Oliver,&#x2019; we know not in the least where, must have died&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Cromwell, Works</hi> 6:299); and he later explained how Squire had first given him the excerpt about the death, &#x201C;illuminating completely a point on which I had otherwise sought light in vain&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 7:344). That was exactly Squire&#x2019;s aim, and it took forty years before the historian Samuel L. Gardiner in &#x201C;Death of Cromwell&#x2019;s Son,&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">Academy</hi>. <date when="1885-03-14">14 March 1885</date>, p. 188, showed that a parliamentary newspaper had in fact reported young Oliver&#x2019;s death from smallpox in Newport Pagnel, <date when="1644-03-00">March 1644</date>. Gardiner declared against the Squire forgeries in this and subsequent letters.</note> which is really worth something, and has remained to me undiscoverable hitherto: I also request from my rusty friend the <hi rend="italic">name</hi> of the &#x201C;Oundle Captain&#x201C; to whom Oliver writes, or the reason why he has no name.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A copy of one of the letters allegedly by Cromwell was said to be addressed &#x201C;For Captn&#x2014;&#x2014; / at his quarters Oundle,&#x201C; Northamptonshire, 28 mi. NE of Northampton.&#x201C; Squire replied, <date when="1847-02-11">11 Feb.</date>, that the writer of most of the papers (which, at this stage, he simply called his &#x201C;MS&#x201C;) was his ancestor Samuel Squire and that the recipient of Cromwell&#x2019;s letter was a Capt. Berry, an &#x201C;Auditor&#x201C; (or kind of adjutant) about whom he offered no further information. Moreover, Squire said, he did not wish to provide TC with proper names because &#x201C;certain ones are now horrified at the name of Oliver, when these very mens G G Grandfathers fathers rode along with the very man&#x201C; (Wright, <hi rend="italic">SP</hi> 312); &#x201C;it is a sore subject even now to them&#x201C; (315).</note> Probably a point of delicacy with my rusty friend. This is all of <hi rend="italic">business</hi> that I have with him; for the rest of his notices are worth properly nothing,&#x2014;except as indicating <pb id="pg-21-157" n="21:157"/>that his old Papers themselves may contain good notices. On the whole, as he lies in your district, and you are partly concerned in the business,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >It was an inconvenient 50 mi. or so for FitzGerald at Boulge to reach Gt. Yarmouth, but easy enough if he were on a visit to Lowestoft or Norwich. It was characteristic of TC that he refused to make the effort of travel and research for anything less than a battlefield.</note> I will hand him over to your care, in the first instance, and see whether you will not bite at the bait, and elucidate him a little. I think it really a pity some rational person did not look over his Papers, and see whether they contain nothing. At all events you can learn who he is or what,&#x2014;a rather strange old genius, one would say;&#x2014;and instruct yourself a little about Lowestoffe, if nothing more.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lowestoft, on the coast of NE Suffolk, is ca. 10 mi. S of Gt. Yarmouth. In his letter Squire had referred to a mention in his MSS of troops in &#x201C;Lowestoffe.&#x201C; FitzGerald in his reply to TC, ca. <date when="1847-02-08">8 Feb.</date>, said: &#x201C;When I go into Norfolk,&#x2014;which will be some time this Spring,&#x2014;I will go to Yarmouth &#x26; see for Mr. Squire, if you like. But if he is so rusty as you say, &#x26; as I also fancy, I doubt if he will open his treasures to any but to you who have already set him creaking. But we shall see. Some of his MSS. extracts are curious &#x26; amusing. He writes himself something like &#x2026; some &#x2026; ancient book-worm.&#x201C;</note> You can return me his Paper altogether at your leisure. &#x2026;</p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Ever since John came away, I have been a little stinted in my news of you; yet I hear a little still by oblique channels, and endeavour to persuade myself that in spite of the wretched weather there is nothing materially wrong. Yesterday, by a mistake which I could not well avoid, you did not get your Newspaper; and so today, before it go off, I will send a bit of writing with it, to apprise you more especially what we are about in this quarter.</p>
<p>After some haggling and canvassing, I am happy to say that we are now to get home again; that your next <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> will probably come from Chelsea, as usual. We propose to go on Thursday first;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1847-02-18">18 Feb.</date> TC is writing on Mon.</note> but perhaps it may be Friday: that however is the latest; on Friday about 3 o&#x2019;clock, if all go well, we shall be in our own little <foreign><hi rend="italic">hadding</hi></foreign> [home] again,&#x2014;glad enough to be out of all this apparatus, into simplicity and quiet once more. Jane has greatly improved in health; indeed she is now about as well as usual; and we hope may now do well henceforth. I myself expect, if we were home again, to feel somewhat better; certainly I ought to be so, for I have gone <foreign><hi rend="italic">bone idle</hi></foreign> these four weeks and more, and have been well done to, every way: but the great tumult of servants and equipments here considerably confuses me always while it lasts; and I do not, for the present, boast of much improvement, and am glad only to say I am about the old pitch. I have passed great part of my time <hi rend="italic">alone</hi>; wandering in silence by the shore of the sea, or among the sheltered lanes up and down; which is not an unprofitable thing either in its course: the memory of many things, which it were not good at all to forget, rises with strange clearness on me in those solitudes,&#x2014;very touching, very sad, out of the depths of the old dead years. O my dear old Mother, what a stupendous thing is this Human life, that we live, in many cases, as if it were of no consequence! When I think of those old dear ones that are with God, and how we shall all soon be there ourselves, I have no word to say I sink silent into thoughts that far<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >NLS 521.46 ends here.</note> exceed words! I think within these two or three days I have gone over almost all your history, since <hi rend="italic">I</hi> first became a partner in it, more especially; my good old Mother&#x2014;ah me, the history of any genuine Soul is a kind of revelation too of God&#x2019;s great Providence; that too is a kind of <hi rend="italic">Bible</hi> to us if we could read it!&#x2014; I had a Letter from Grahame last week, which had a great deal about you; how heartily he sympathized in your ideas, how much he and all <pb id="pg-21-159" n="21:159"/>the circle you have lived in respected and loved you. I have many things to be thankful for; but my Mother, I believe, is the greatest blessing of all. God&#x2019;s grace and blessing be with us all. Amen, Amen.</p>
<p>Graham said you were not so well since Jack went away; no wonder too if the fierce storm have hurt you. However, it seems, you have not quite yielded: and now we have copious warm rains and the snow and frost are quite gone;&#x2014;let me hope Isabella will write me again a little word or two to say that you are rallying again as the weather mends.&#x2014; Here too we have had some days of very venomous frost, with the ground all coated deep in snow,&#x2014;very unwholesome, unpleasant weather; but on Saturday night last there arose a wind from the West, which still blows, and which has set all to rights again in the way of warmth. I hope Jamie will get on with his ploughing now:&#x2014;I suppose he will be cunning enough to plant few or no <hi rend="italic">potatoes</hi> this year again; few wise men will be inclined to venture deep upon that frail bottom again for a while! The news out of Ireland; and the reckless nonsense they are doing in London to help not <hi rend="italic">them</hi>, but their wretched spendthrift <hi rend="italic">Landlords</hi>, fills everybody I talk to, or hear of, with distress and apprehension: it is likely enough next year may be as bad as this;&#x2014;and in fact if the potatoes do <hi rend="italic">not</hi> come back, we are got into a hobble of which I believe nobody sees the outlet!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Jack writes to us this morning from Seaforth where he has been staying that he thinks of setting off &#x201C;on Monday&#x201C; (that is, today), but seems to intend going by Manchester, tho&#x2019; not very positively: our little Maid is to <supplied>[be]</supplied><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> instructed today to receive him at Chelsea when he comes; we may expect to find him fairly arrived there on our return home. He tells me of a Letter from Isabella; which is my latest tidings from Scotland.</p>
<p>We have Charles Buller here today, who along with Mr Baring is going up to London after dinner, to vote against Bentinck and his Irish <hi rend="italic">railway</hi> nonsense:<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lord George Bentinck (<date when="1802-00-00">1802</date>&#x2013;<date when="1848-00-00">48</date>; <ref target="volume-21/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/2157"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), M.P. for King&#x2019;s Lynn, <date when="1826-00-00">1826</date>&#x2013;<date when="1848-00-00">48</date>, who in <date when="1846-00-00">1846</date> had opposed Sir Robert Peel&#x2019;s repeal of the Corn Laws and accepted leadership of the protectionists, had proposed a bill to lend &#xa3;16 million to railway companies to provide employment. The govt. was against it, but it was allowed to go to a second reading, <date when="1847-02-16">16 Feb.</date>, after several days of debate, when it was heavily defeated.</note> we are about 80 miles from London, but they do it in little more than 2 hours; as if you were going to Annan!&#x2014; Isabella spoke of your going to <hi rend="italic">Dumfries</hi> shortly; which I think will be very good: however I hope this Note may still reach you without delay.&#x2014; <closer><salute>Dear Mother, <foreign>adieu</foreign> for this day: they are come into my room and are making a noise. If I were to write all week I should not tell you all I mean! But indeed you already know it by your own kind heart.&#x2014; Jane salutes you with her best love. Our affectionate regards to Jamie and Isabella. God&#x2019;s blessing on you all.</salute></closer></p>

<p>Lady H has been really very kind to me&#x2014;and I feel extremely obliged to her <hi rend="italic">in every way</hi>&#x2014;as well for what she has <hi rend="italic">not</hi> done as for what she has done&#x2014; I do not pretend to <hi rend="italic">understand</hi> her any better than heretofore&#x2014;but this much is quite certain that from one motive or other&#x2014;systematically or involuntarily she has <hi rend="italic">staved off</hi> a deal of vexation from me which might easily have attended my visit and made it very wretched.</p>

He is full of wit, and happened to get upon James I, upon which topic he was superb&#x201C; (E. D.

Emily and George (who was Palmerston&#x2019;s heir) were presumed to be his children.

<salute>My dear Jean,</salute>
<p>We have got home to our own place again; all safe, and have found all safe;&#x2014;by the <hi rend="italic">Express Train</hi> yesterday: a most swift-going affair, which whisks you over 88 miles in 2 hours and 20 minutes, and no mistake! We are glad enough to get back to our own quiet little nook after all; we came away a week <hi rend="italic">before</hi> the time expected (better on <hi rend="italic">that</hi> side of the date than on the other!); pleading for our excuse that our &#x201C;Brother the Doctor&#x201C; was coming.&#x2014; The Doctor in fact has talked about coming, for a while past, and Jane had even written to our little atom of a maid (who is a most <foreign><hi rend="italic">fell</hi></foreign> [keen], punctual and knowing little body) to give him her best welcome whenever he arrived, and specially to sit up for him &#x201C;on Wednesday night&#x201C; (night before last) till after the hour of the last Liverpool Train: but no Doctor came; no Doctor has yet come: and this morning we get a Note from him to say that he is safe in his old lodging at Leamington (a place above half way hither from Liverpool), and not thinking to stir till &#x201C;Friday&#x201C; (today) &#x201C;at soonest.&#x201C; I have written off to him on the chance of his being still there. It seems to me likeliest he will come tomorrow. He professes himself very well: we hear otherwise he has been reading his <hi rend="italic">Dante</hi> at Seaforth, seeing company &#x26;c, with great applause. If anybody could get him a spell of real work, poor fellow, and fasten him fairly into harness over it, it would be a real blessing!</p>
<p>His Letter encloses a Note from Isabella, which is our last Scotch news. It seems my Mother thought of coming up to you &#x201C;on Tuesday&#x201C;: will you write half a word, as soon as possible, and let me know whether it is so, and how our Mother actually is. I wrote a Letter to herself some three days ago; <pb id="pg-21-163" n="21:163"/>but know not whether the Scotsbrig people will forward it. We are tolerably well, very tolerably indeed both of us; Jane very greatly recovered. She is just out for a turn in the sunshine (for our weather too is now excellent), or else to do some business with the Butcher perhaps.&#x2014; How my Mother is? tell me that, like a good <foreign>bairn</foreign>! <closer><salute>Our affectionate regards to you all</salute></closer></p>

<p>The day before your last Note came, I had already got a new message from our rusty Yarmouth friend,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >FitzGerald&#x2019;s of [ca. <date when="1847-02-14">14 Feb.</date>]. Squire&#x2019;s of <date when="1847-02-11">11 Feb.</date></note>&#x2014;which I enclose for you as a somewhat abstruse document of its kind.

V. Worship (unidentified), dated at Gt. Yarmouth, <date when="1847-02-11">11 Feb.</date>, addressed to FitzGerald&#x2019;s friend William Bodham Donne (<date when="1807-00-00">1807</date>&#x2013;<date when="1882-00-00">82</date>; <ref target="volume-21/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/7821"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), future librarian of the London Lib., <date when="1852-00-00">1852</date>&#x2013;<date when="1857-00-00">57</date>, and examiner of plays in the lord chamberlain&#x2019;s office, <date when="1857-00-00">1857</date>&#x2013;<date when="1874-00-00">74</date>. Worship&#x2019;s letter is about the Rev. Henry Squire (d. <date when="1869-00-00">1869</date>), unitarian minister of South Quay, Gt. Yarmouth, whom Worship mistook for William Squire. On the envelope (which has not been found), addressed to TC at Alverstoke and received <date when="1847-02-15">15 Feb.</date>, TC wrote: &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">first</hi> letter of all is here; with <hi rend="italic">Notes</hi>, really curious now <date when="1849-11-00">Nov<hi rend="italic">r</hi> 1849</date>&#x201C; (Wright 316).</note> I really wish some rational eye could get upon these old Papers of his, and fairly examine them; I myself, driven nearly mad by similar blockheads in earlier stages of this business, am obliged to fight rather shy,&#x2014;and restrict myself to ascertaining whether there are any more Oliver <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi>, which under any terms he will have the kindness to let me see, like a good boy!&#x2014; If you can do anything farther do it&#x2014;if not, not. <name>T.C.</name></p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>We receive, my wife and I, with great pleasure this little new memorial <pb id="pg-21-164" n="21:164"/>of you;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Chalmers&#x2019;s review of John Daniel Morell, <hi rend="italic">An Historical and Critical View of the Speculative Philosophy of Europe in the Nineteenth Century</hi>, 2 vols. (<date when="1846-00-00">1846</date>&#x2013;<date when="1847-00-00">47</date>), in the <hi rend="italic">North British Review</hi> 6 (<date when="1847-02-00">Feb. 1847</date>): 271&#x2013;331.</note> and are very much obliged indeed that you should hold us so kindly in remembrance, in spite of distances, and changes, and the flight of years. We are still Scotch enough to be very proud of you; still human enough to feel a true sympathy with you on all manner of things.</p>
<p>In reading over this Paper you have written on the History of Philosophy, I am really much struck to discern on how many essential points I see altogether as you do,&#x2014;starting as we probably did from almost opposite ends of the diameter, in reference to them. It is long since I ever read so much as this on these subjects; which, except on special incitement, it is my habit altogether to avoid: for it was, many years ago, my slow but at length clear practical conclusion, which I also rejoice to find intimated in this Paper, that (for me, at least) the German transcendental Metaphysics had as it were swallowed and abolished the Scotch or French Sceptical; that the whole baleful <hi rend="italic">Universe of Cobwebs</hi>, in which with blinded eyes, passionately searching thro&#x2019; long years, I had nearly lost my life, was now <hi rend="italic">annihilated;</hi> so that, by Heaven&#x2019;s unspeakable mercy, I could now look abroad with my own eyes over the <hi rend="italic">real Universe</hi> once more, and <hi rend="italic">see!</hi> Since that, I have more and more decidedly kept clear of all such speculations; and indeed have privately been of opinion, nothing doubting, tho&#x2019; not wishing to dogmatise, that all Metaphysics and Mental Philosophy so-called is, for men in general as well for myself, no other than a <hi rend="italic">disease;</hi> properly a &#x201C;fever of Scepticism,&#x201C;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. &#x201C;Characteristics,&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">works</hi> 28:40. Chalmers had protested at &#x201C;the pretences of German transcendentalists&#x201C; and the &#x201C;value metaphysies attached to them.&#x201C;</note> from which the healthy intellect of man seeks only, and must seek, to <hi rend="italic">escape;</hi>&#x2014;as accordingly we find, in all ancient healthy ages, men <hi rend="italic">have</hi> used their intellect not for looking into <hi rend="italic">itself</hi> (which I consider to be naturally <hi rend="italic">impossible</hi>, and a mere morbid spasm), but to look out, as an <hi rend="italic">eye</hi> should, over the Universe which is not we, and <hi rend="italic">there</hi> to recognise innumerable things, and to believe, and do,&#x2014;and <hi rend="italic">adore</hi> withal, as in that case is a very universal and infallible result, among other blessed ones! This I privately maintain, as a very irrefragable article of faith; to myself highly important, and pregnant with results quite boundless. From time to time, too, I meet with gratifying Confirmations: Goethe says once of himself. &#x201C;I never <hi rend="italic">thought</hi> about <hi rend="italic">thinking</hi> (<foreign><hi rend="italic">Habe nie ans Denken gedacht</hi></foreign>), &#x201C; I know a better trick that; &#x2014;and here too, in this <pb id="pg-21-165" n="21:165"/>Review Article, the Scottish Speaker apprises me that he too, in his altogether different sphere, is not far from the same opinion! Among all the fine things there unfolded or hinted to us, there is none I like better than that.&#x2014; I also have to say that Humboldt&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Kosmos</hi> gave me the same sad feeling that it has given you;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >F. H. Alexander von Humboldt, <hi rend="italic">Kosmos</hi>, vols. 1 and 2 (Stuttgart and T&#xfc;bingen, <date when="1845-00-00">1845</date>, <date when="1847-00-00">1847</date>), a description of the physical universe.</note> the feeling namely that this view of Nature was an altogether <hi rend="italic">un</hi>worshipping, and therefore as I think, unworthy, lamed, and indeed inhuman one! I said to myself, with many reflexions little fit for words, &#x201C;Since the first Norse <hi rend="italic">Thinker</hi>, Odin or whatever his name, sank prostrate at the Unutterable Spectacle of Earth and Sea and Air, of the Stars and the Graves, of the Lightnings and the Azures, of Life and of Death; and, with his brow in the dust, said awestruck &#x201C;It is a God!&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Heroes and Hero-Worship, Works</hi> 5:21, 29.</note>&#x2014;from this first Norse Thinker with his eyes and his worship, onward to the last German one with his telescopes, crucibles, &#x201C;immense practical utilities,&#x201C; accredited sentimentalisms, and &#x201C;love of the picturesque,&#x201C; what a way have we travelled.!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Chalmers had also commented directly on TC: &#x201C;He is the champion of Germanism, not in its letter, but in its spirit. We could not, he himself could not, point to one of its dogmata as having aught to do with the inspiration which animates him, and which he has given forth in such marvellous volumes to the world. Could he, for example, tell us what the Articles are, and whether to be found in the Confessions of Schelling, or Hegel, or Fichte, or even Kant, which have caused the fire to burn within him? They are not creeds, but men who are the objects of his idolatry, which under the name of hero Worship, he renders alike to those of most opposite opinions&#x2014;as to Luther, and Knox, and Cromwell on the one hand, or with equal veneration to the lofty poets and transcendentalists of Germany upon the other. He is a lover of earnestness rather than truth. &#x201C;Yet Chalmers approves of Morell&#x2019;s enthusiastic praise for TC as &#x201C;inspired&#x201C; by the Germans rather than borrowing from them and for his attacks on &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">sham</hi> worship.&#x201C; But he adds that &#x201C;these withering adjurations of Carlyle should be of use to our churches; and yet most assuredly it is not by grafting the German philosophy on the gospel of Jesus Christ&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">North British Review</hi> 6:325, 328).</note>&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>
<p>But I must stop short in these lucubrations. I owe you thanks for another Gift, dated many months ago: a broad, genial and altogether excellent address, on the subject of your Edinburgh Schools: a mere Occasional Speech, extracted from the Newspapers; to me more useful (I really believe so, for in many things it rebuked me) than most of the volumes I have read since.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly Chalmers&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Churches and Schools for the Working Classes.

<salute>Dear Duffy,</salute>
<p>Here is a Paper which has come to me today from the writer of it, a very worthy acquaintance of mine; which, as a small memorial of me for the moment, a small drop of oil on huge waters of bitterness and tumult, I send you to read.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In <date when="1847-01-00">mid-Jan.</date> W. E. Forster joined his father, who had been in Ireland since <date when="1846-11-30">30 Nov. 1846</date>, establishing and helping to oversee the operation of soup kitchens. During the ten days he was there Forster was shocked by the situation. His report was pbd. in <hi rend="italic">Distress in Ireland</hi>, an account of visits made to distressed districts by members of the Society of Friends, <date when="1846-00-00">1846</date>&#x2013;<date when="1847-00-00">47</date>. The <hi rend="italic">Nation</hi> bitterly derided soup-kitchen relief (as on <date when="1847-02-27">27 Feb.</date>, &#x201C;Prosperity of England&#x2014; Desolation of Ireland&#x201C;).</note> Forster is a young wealthy manufacturer, who migrated some <pb id="pg-21-167" n="21:167"/>years ago from Devonshire or Cornwall to Yorkshire for taking up that trade; and was recommended to me by John Sterling: I have ever since liked him very well. A Quaker, or rather the son of Quakers, for he himself has little to do with what is obsolete; a most cheery, frank-hearted, courageous, clear-sighted young fellow:&#x2014;the Quakers, some months ago, made a special Subscription for Ireland, and decided, like prudent people, on seeing with their own eyes their money laid out. Forster&#x2019;s father and self were of the Deputation for that end, or, for aught I know were the sole Deputation; and this is the Report they have given in. Read it, I say; and enjoy five minutes of a <hi rend="italic">Sabbath</hi>-feeling,&#x2014;not too frequent with any of us in these times.</p>
<p>It is long since I heard anything direct from you; nay in the <hi rend="italic">Nation</hi> itself I now find but little of you; only here and there, in some genial, honest, patient <hi rend="italic">human</hi> word (as in the Paper on <hi rend="italic">Emigration</hi>, last week<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Emigration,&#x201C; <date when="1847-02-20">20 Feb.</date></note>) do I trace your hand, and with all my heart wish it speed. The aspect of Ireland is beyond words at present! The most thoughtless here is struck into momentary <hi rend="italic">silence</hi> in looking at it; the wisest among us cannot guess what the end of these things is to be. For it is not Ireland alone: starving Ireland will become starving Scotland and starving England in a little while: if this despicable root will but <hi rend="italic">continue</hi> dead, we may at least all say that we have changed our sordid chronic pestilential atrophy into a swift fierce crisis of death or the beginning of cure; and all &#x201C;revolutions&#x201C; are but small to this,&#x2014;if the Potatoe will but <hi rend="italic">stay</hi> away! Your Irish Governing Class are now actually brought to the bar; arraigned before Heaven and Earth or <hi rend="italic">mis</hi>-governing this Ireland; and no Lord John Russell or &#x201C;Irish Party&#x201C; in Palaceyard, and no man or combination of men can save them from their sentence, To govern it better or to disappear and die.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The meeting of the Confederation (formerly Irish Party; see <ref target="volume-21/lt-18470111-TC-LHB-01">TC to <sic>Lady HB</sic><corr>LHB</corr>, <date when="1847-01-11">11 Jan.</date></ref>) in Dublin, <date when="1847-01-13">13 Jan.</date>, followed soon after by one in London, tried to launch a national movement uniting Irish peers and M.P.s, repealers and nonrepealers. They agreed that private enterprise could not cope with the famine and called for measures such as reproductive public works, assisted emigration, and compensation for departing tenants for their improvements. In theory, its initial program should have appealed to TC and Duffy. In fact, after a brief welcome, the <hi rend="italic">Nation</hi> turned against it; the Russell ministry resisted pressure; and the new group found it impossible to combine so many different interests, including the landlords&#x2019;. The Irish Party&#x2019;s committee room had recently been at 8 Palace Yard, directly to the W of the houses of parliament.</note> The sins of the fathers fall heavy on the children,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Exod. 20:5.</note> if after <hi rend="italic">ten</hi> generations:&#x2014;surely, I think, of all the trades in the world that of Irish landlord at this moment is the <pb id="pg-21-168" n="21:168"/>frightfullest: the Skibbereen Peasant dies at once in a few days;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The famine was particularly severe in Skibbereen, a town in SW co. Cork.</note> but his Landlord will have to perish by inches, thro&#x2019; long years of disgusting tumult, dark violence, and infatuation under yet undeveloped forms; and <hi rend="italic">him</hi>, if God take not pity on him, nobody else will pity! Either this, it seems to me, is inevitable for the Irish Landlord, or else a degree of manfulness and generous wisdom such as one hardly dares to hope from him,&#x2014;from him, or from those about him. It is really a tremendous epoch we have come to, if the Potatoes will not return! And then, as I said, our Scotch Landlords,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >There had recently been food riots at Scottish ports demonstrating against destitution and the shipping of grain.</note> and then also our English, come in their turn to the bar,&#x2014;not much less guilty, if much more fortunate;&#x2014;and they also will have a ravelled account to settle! But England and they are fortunate in this, that we have already <hi rend="italic">another</hi> Aristocracy (that of Wealth, nay in some measure that of Wisdom, Piety, Courage),&#x2014;an Aristocracy, not at all of the &#x201C;chimerical&#x201C; or &#x201C;do-nothing&#x201C; sort, tho&#x2019; not yet recognised in the Herald&#x2019;s Books,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Heralds&#x2019; records, including genealogies, armorial bearings, etc., held by the College of Arms, incorporated <date when="1484-00-00">1484</date>.</note> or elsewhere well; but an Aristocracy which does actually guide and govern the people, to such extent at least as that they do not by wholesale die of hunger. That you in Ireland, except in some fractions of Ulster, altogether want this, and have nothing <hi rend="italic">but</hi> Landlords, seems to me the fearful peculiarity of Ireland. To relieve Ireland from this; to at least render Ireland <hi rend="italic">habitable</hi> for <hi rend="italic">Capitalists</hi>, if not for Heroes; to invite Capital, and Industrial Governors and Guidance (from Lancashire, from Scotland, from the Moon, or from the Ring of Saturn): what other salvation can one see for Ireland? The<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Break in MS here.</note> end and aim of all true patriotism is surely thitherward at present! Alas! you must tell Mitchel that I read with ever greater pain those wild articles of his, which, so much do I love in them otherwise, often make me very sad.<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Untraced; presumably referred to by Duffy.</note> Daniel O&#x2019;Connell, poor old man, now nearly <hi rend="italic">done</hi> with his noisy unveracities, has played a sad part in this earth! All Ireland cries out, &#x201C;You have saved us.&#x201C; But the fact is very far otherwise. Good Heavens! when I think what pestilent distraction, leading direct to revolt and grape-shot, and yet unsounded depths of misery he has cast into all young heroic hearts of Ireland, I could wish the man never had been born!<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Newspapers (such as the <hi rend="italic">Nation</hi>, <date when="1847-02-27">27 Feb.</date>) repeated contradictory reports that O&#x2019;Connell was dead, dying, or even about to return to &#x201C;his normal good health.&#x201C; He died, <date when="1847-05-15">15 May</date>.</note> Mitchel may depend on it, it is not repeal from England, but repeal <hi rend="italic">from the Devil</hi>, that will save Ireland. England, too, I can very <pb id="pg-21-169" n="21:169"/>honestly tell him, is heartily desirous of &#x201C;Repeal,&#x201C; would welcome repeal with both hands if England did not see that repeal had been forbidden by the laws of Nature, and could in the least believe in repeal! Ireland, I think, cannot <hi rend="italic">lift anchor</hi> and sail away with itself. We are married to Ireland by the ground&#x2014;plan of this world&#x2014;a thick&#x2014;skinned labouring man to a drunken ill&#x2014;tongued wife, and dreadful family quarrels have ensued! Mitchel I reckon to be a noble, chivalrous fellow, full of talent and manful temper of every kind. In fact, I love him very much, and must infinitely regret to see the like of him enveloped in such poor delusions, partisanships, and narrow violences, very unworthy of him. &#x201C;Young Ireland,&#x201C; furthermore, ought to understand that it is to them that the sense and veracity of England looks mainly for help in<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >MS recommences.</note> a better administering of Ireland; to them (and not to the O&#x2019;Connel party who are well seen for what they are), to them in spite of all their violence, for it is believed that there are among them true men. This I can testify as a fact on rather good evidence. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Duffy: I meant but a word, and here is an Essay! Ever yours,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Emerson,</salute>
<p>The Steamer goes tomorrow; I must, tho&#x2019; in a very dim condition, have a little word for you conveyed by it. In the miscellaneous maw of that strange Steamer, shall lie among other things a friendly <hi rend="italic">word!</hi></p>
<p>Your very kind Letter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1847-01-31">31 Jan.</date></note> lay waiting me here, some ten days ago; doubly welcome after so long a silence. We had been in Hampshire, with the Barings, where we were last year;&#x2014;some four weeks or more; totally idle: our winter had been, and indeed still is, unusually severe; my Wife&#x2019;s health in consequence was sadly deranged; but this idleness, these Isle-of-Wight sea-breezes have brought matters well round again; so we cannot grudge the visit or the idleness, which otherwise too might have its uses. Alas, at this time, my normal state is to be altogether <hi rend="italic">idle;</hi> to look out upon a very lonely Universe, full of grim sorrow, full of splendour too; and not to know at all, for the moment, on what side I am to attack again!&#x2014; I read your Book of Poems,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson had written: &#x201C;I printed them not because I was deceived into a belief that they were poems, but because of the softness or hardness of heart of many friends here who have made it a point to have them collected. Once having set out to print, I obeyed the solicitations of John Chapman of an ill-omened street in London to send him the book in <hi rend="italic">manuscript</hi>, for the better securing of copyright.&#x201C;</note> all faithfully, at Bay House (our Hampshire quarters); where the obstinate people,&#x2014;with whom you are otherwise, in prose, a first favourite,&#x2014;foolishly <hi rend="italic">refused</hi> to let me read aloud; foolishly, for I would have made it mostly all plain by commentary:&#x2014;so I had to read for myself; and can say, in spite of my hardheartedness, I did gain tho&#x2019; under impediments a real satisfaction, and some tone of the Eternal Melodies sounding afar off, ever and anon, in my ear! This is fact; a truth in Natural History; from which you are welcome to draw inferences. A grand view of the Universe, everywhere the sound (unhappily, <hi rend="italic">far off</hi>, as it were) of a valiant genuine Human Soul: this, even under rhyme, is a satisfaction worth some struggling for. But indeed you are very perverse; and thro&#x2019; this perplexed undiaphanous element, you do not fall on me like radiant summer rainbows, like floods of sunlight, but with <hi rend="italic">thin</hi> piercing radiances which affect me like the light of the <hi rend="italic">stars</hi>. It is so: I wish you would become <hi rend="italic">concrete</hi>, and write in prose the straightest way; but under any form I must put up with you; that is my lot.&#x2014; Chapman&#x2019;s edition, as you probably know, is very beautiful. I believe there are enough of ardent silent seekers in England to buy up this edition from him, and resolutely study the same: as <pb id="pg-21-171" n="21:171"/>for the review multitude, they dare not exactly call it &#x201C;unintelligible moonshine,&#x201C; and so will probably hold their tongue. It is my fixed opinion that we are all at sea as to what is called Poetry, Art &#x26;c in these times; labouring under a dreadful incubus of <hi rend="italic">Tradition</hi>, and mere &#x201C;Cant heaped balefully on us up to the very Zenith,&#x201C;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC quotes himself; see <ref target="volume-20/lt-18460717-TC-RWE-01">TC to RWE, <date when="1846-07-17">17 July 1846</date></ref>.</note> as men in nearly all other provinces of their Life, except perhaps the railway province, do now labour and stagger;&#x2014;in a word that Goethe-and-Schiller&#x2019;s &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Kunst</hi>&#x201C; has far more brotherhood with Pusey-and-Newman&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Shovelhattery,</hi> and other the like deplorable phenomena, than it is in the least aware of!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edward Bouverie Pusey (<date when="1800-00-00">1800</date>&#x2013;<date when="1882-00-00">1882</date>; <ref target="volume-21/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/22910"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>) and John Henry Newman (<date when="1801-00-00">1801</date>&#x2013;<date when="1890-00-00">90</date>; <ref target="volume-21/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/20023"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), early leaders of the Anglo&#x2014;Catholic movement. A shovel hat is a clerical hat. It is significant that TC should already protest against what in <hi rend="italic">Latter-Day Pamphlets</hi> (<date when="1850-00-00">1850</date>) he calls art as &#x201C;a kind of religion&#x201C; and &#x201C;Jesuitism in the Fine Arts&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 20:318, 320).</note> I beg you take warning: I am more serious in this than you suppose. But so, you will not; you whistle lightly over my prophecies, and go your own stiffnecked road. Unfortunate man!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I had read in the Newspapers, and even heard in speech from Manchester people, that you were certainly coming this very summer, to lecture among us: but now it seems, in your Letter, all postponed into the vague again: I do not personally know your Manchester negociators, but I know in general that they are men of respectability, insight and activity; much connected with the lecturing department, which is a very growing one, especially in Lancashire, at present;&#x2014;men likely, for the rest, to <hi rend="italic">fulfil</hi> whatsoever they may become engaged for to you.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-21/lt-18470128-TC-JCH-01">TC to <sic>JC</sic><corr>JCH</corr>, <date when="1847-01-28">28 Jan.</date></ref> Emerson had written: &#x201C;Somebody or somebodies in Liverpool &#x26; Manchester have proposed &#x2026; that I should come to those cities to lecture. And who knows but I may come one day? Steam is strong, &#x26; Liverpool is near. I should find my account in the strong inducement of a new audience to finish pieces which have lain waiting with little hope for months or years. Ah then, if I dared, I should be well content to add some golden hours to my life in seeing you, now all full grown &#x26; acknowledged amidst your own people,&#x2014;to hear &#x26; to speak is so little, yet so much! But life is dangerous &#x26; delicate. I should like to see your solid England. The map of Britain is good reading for me &#x2026; So beware of me, for on that distant day when I get ready, I shall come.&#x201C;</note> My own ignorant tho&#x2019; confident guess, moreover, is, that you would, in all senses of the word, <hi rend="italic">succeed</hi> there; I think, also rather confidently, we could promise you an audience of British aristocracy in London here,&#x2014;and of British commonalty all manner of audiences that you liked to stoop to. I heard an ignorant blockhead (or mainly so) called Elihu Burritt bow-wowing here, some months ago, to an audience of several thousands, in the City, one evening,&#x2014;upon Universal Peace, or some other field of balderdash; which the poor people seemed very patient of. In a word, I do not see what is to hinder you to come whenever <hi rend="italic">you</hi> can resolve upon it. The adventure is perfectly promising: an adventure familiar to you withal; for Lecturing is <pb id="pg-21-172" n="21:172"/>with us fundamentally just what it is with you: Much prurient curiosity, with some ingenuous lore of wisdom, an element of real reverence for the same: everywhere a perfect openness to any man speaking in any measure things manful. Come, therefore; gird yourself together, and come. With little or no peradventure, you will realize what your modest hope is, and more;&#x2014;and I, for my share of it, shall see you come again under this Sun! O Heavens, there <hi rend="italic">might</hi> be some good in that! Nay, if you will travel like a private quiet person, who knows but I, the most unlocomotive of Mortals, might be able to escort you up and down a little; to look at many a thing along with you, and even to open my long-closed heart and speak about the same?&#x2014; There is a spare-room always in this House for you,&#x2014;in this heart, in these two hearts, the like: bid me help in this enterprise, in all manner of ways where I can; and on the whole, get it rightly put together, and embark on it, and arrive!</p>
<p>The good Miss Fuller has painted us all <hi rend="italic"><foreign>en beau</foreign>,</hi> and your smiling imagination has added new colours.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson had written: &#x201C;I had already learned from Margaret Fuller at Paris that you had been very good &#x26; gentle to her;&#x2014;brilliant &#x26; prevailing, of course, but, I inferred, had actually restrained the volleys &#x26; modulated the thunder, out of true courtesy &#x26; goodness of nature, which was worthy of all praise in a spoiled conqueror at this time of day. Especially, too, she expressed a true recognition &#x26; love of Jane Carlyle; and thus her visit proved a solid satisfaction; to me also, who think that few people have so well earned their pleasures as she.&#x201C;</note> We have not a triumphant life here; very far indeed from that, <hi rend="italic"><foreign>ach Gott!</foreign></hi>&#x2014;as you shall see. But Margaret is an excellent soul: in real regard with both of us here. Since she went, I have been reading some of her Papers in a new Book we have got:<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Papers on Literature and Art</hi> (<date when="1846-00-00">1846</date>).</note> greatly superior to all I knew before; in fact the undeniable utterance (now first undeniable to me) of a true heroic mind;&#x2014;altogether unique, so far as I know, among the Writing Women of this generation; rare enough too, God knows, among the writing Men. She is very narrow, sometimes; but she is truly high: honour to Margaret, and more and more good-speed to her,&#x2014; <foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Emerson. <closer><salute>I am ever yours</salute></closer></p>

<place>Chelsea, London</place>, <date when="1847-03-03">3 March, 1847</date>&#x2014;</dateline>
<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Some ten days ago your new volume of <hi rend="italic">Denkw&#xfc;rdigkeiten</hi> [<hi rend="italic">Memoirs</hi>] was safely handed in to me;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Denkw&#xfc;rdigkeiten und vermischte Schriften</hi>, 7 vols. (Leipzig, <date when="1838-00-00">1838</date>&#x2013;<date when="1846-00-00">46</date>).</note> I fancy it must have been delayed among the ices of the Elbe, for the Note accompanying it bears date a good while <pb id="pg-21-173" n="21:173"/>back. Thanks for this new kindness: a valued Gift, to be counted with very many other which I now owe to you.&#x2014; Some time before, there had arrived your announcement that the little <hi rend="italic">Tomb of Shakspeare</hi> had made its way across the impediments; and, what was very welcome to me, that you meant to shew it to Herr Tieck. Surely there is no man in all the world that deserves better to see it! Will you say to him, if he knows my name at all, that I send him my affectionate respects and salutations; that, for the last twenty years and more, he has flourished always in my mind as a true noble &#x201C;Singing-Tree&#x201C; in that German land of <foreign><hi rend="italic">Phantasus</hi></foreign> [Fantasy] and <foreign><hi rend="italic">Poesis</hi></foreign> [Poetry]; that I, and very many here, still listen to him with the friendliest regards, with true love and reverence, and bid him live long as a veteran very precious to us. Your king did no act that got him more votes from the instructed part of this Community, than that of his recalling Tieck in the way he did, to a Country where he was indeed <hi rend="italic">unique</hi>, and which had good reason to be proud of him.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Although a native of Berlin, Tieck had long been settled in Dresden, where he made a name for himself for his reading of poetry and plays. In <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date> King Frederick William IV of Prussia (<date when="1795-00-00">1795</date>&#x2013;<date when="1861-00-00">1861</date>; see <ref target="volume-16/lt-18430705-JWC-TC-01"><sic>16:232</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1843-07-05">5 July 1843</date></corr></ref>) appointed Tieck as his reader.</note></p>
<p>I have read the new volume of <hi rend="italic">Denkw&#xfc;rdigkeiten;</hi> and am veritably called to thank you, not in my private capacity alone, but as a speaker for the Public withal. If the Public thought as I do on such matters,&#x2014;that is to say, if the Public were not more or less a blockhead,&#x2014;the Public would say to itself, &#x201C;This is the kind of thing that before all others is good for me at present! <hi rend="italic">This</hi>, to give me an account of memorable actions and events, in more and more compact, intelligent, illuminative form, <hi rend="italic">evolving</hi> for me, more and more, the real essence of said actions and events,&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">this</hi> is Literature, Art, Poetry, or what name you like to give it; this is the real Problem the Writing Man has to solve for me, at present!&#x201D;&#x2014; Truly if I had command over you, I should say, &#x201C;Memoirs, and ever new Memoirs!&#x201D; There are no Books that give me so lively an impression of modern Facts as these of yours do. Withal I get a view as if into the very heart of Prussia thro&#x2019; them; which also is highly valuable<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> to me. I can only bid you <hi rend="italic">persevere</hi>, give us what is possible; and must reflect with regret that one man&#x2019;s capabilities in such respect are limited and not unlimited.&#x2014; Last week too I have read, with the liveliest interest, your Book on <hi rend="italic">Bl&#xfc;cher</hi>, which I had not sufficiently studied before.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Varnhagen&#x2019;s biography of Gebhard Leberecht von Bl&#xfc;cher; see <ref target="volume-19/lt-18450530-TC-JGL-01">TC to JGL, <date when="1845-05-30">30 May 1845</date></ref>.</note> A capital Book; a capital rough old Prussian <hi rend="italic">Mastiff</hi> set forth to us there! I seem to see old Bl&#xfc;cher face to face; recognise his supreme and indispensable worth in that vast heterogeneous Combination,&#x2014;which also to him was <hi rend="italic">indispensable;</hi> for in a common element, one <pb id="pg-21-174" n="21:174"/>sees, he might very easily have spent himself, as hundreds like him have done, to comparatively small purpose; but that huge inert mass was always there to fall back upon, to be excited and ever anew excited, till <hi rend="italic">it</hi> also had to kindle and flame along with him. &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Kerle, Ihr sehet aus wie Schweine</hi></foreign> [Fellows, you look like pigs]!&#x201D; and then these scenes, as at Katzstadt, &#x201C;Napoleon just behind me, say you?&#x201C; or to the enthusiastic Public on the streets of Halberstadt, &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">So m&#xF6;gt Ihr denn alle</hi></foreign> [You&#x2019;d all like to be like that]&#x2014; &#x2014;!&#x201D;&#x2014; I have laughed aloud at such naiveties, every time they have come into my mind since. Thanks again and again for painting us such pictures, a real possession for all men.</p>
<p>Probably you are aware there is a kind of Translation going on from your Works, for our behoof, at present? One Murray, a principal Bookseller here, has decided on picking out Two volumes from you, for a Series of Books (<hi rend="italic">Home and Colonial Library,</hi> or some such name) which he is going on with, in these years: the Translator of the <hi rend="italic">Austin</hi> Firm, which is partly known to you;&#x2014;respectable, he and his Enterprise, and to be welcomed in the meanwhile; yet I cannot but heartily wish he and party had let the matter alone; for precisely in those days I had in private set another young man, of much superior talent, upon the same adventure, and had got a Bookseller too,&#x2014;when this announcement of the Murray&#x2019;s and Austins brought us to a sudden stop.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Sketches of German Life, and Scenes from the War of Liberation in Germany</hi>, selected and trans. by Sir Alexander Duff Gordon from Varnhagen&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Denkw&#xfc;rdigkeiten</hi> was pbd. by John Murray (<date when="1808-00-00">1808</date>&#x2013;<date when="1892-00-00">92</date>; <ref target="volume-21/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/19637"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>) as part of &#x201C;Murray&#x2019;s Home and Colonial Library,&#x201C; <date when="1847-03-06">6 March</date>. Gordon was the son-in-law of John (<date when="1790-00-00">1790</date>&#x2013;<date when="1859-00-00">1859</date>; <ref target="volume-21/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/911"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), jurist, and Sarah Austin. TC&#x2019;s young would-be trans. was almost certainly Francis Espinasse; see <ref target="volume-21/lt-18470204-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1847-02-04">4 Feb.</date></ref>, where he was said to be in London &#x201C;arranging about certain German Translations.&#x201C;</note> Meanwhile, as I say, the thing is not to be regretted; the thing is to be welcomed in its place and time; will do good in the meanwhile, and prepare us by and by for better.</p>
<p>Of my own affairs I can report no alteration hitherto. I remain contentedly idle; shall doubtless feel a call to work again by and by, but wait <foreign><hi rend="italic">unbeschreiblich ruhig</hi></foreign> [indescribably quiet] (as Attila Schmelzle has it)<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In Jean Paul Richter&#x2019;s &#x201C;Army-Chaplain Schmelzle&#x2019;s Journey to Flaetz&#x201C;; see TC&#x2019;s trans., <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 22:131&#x2013;92.</note> for that questionable consummation! I am very serious in my ever-deepening regard for the &#x201C;Silences&#x201C; that are in our Existence, quite unheeded in these poor days; and do, for myself, regard Book-writing in such a time as but a <foreign><hi rend="italic">Pis-aller</hi></foreign> [last resort]. With which nevertheless one <hi rend="italic">must</hi> persevere! <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign> my dear Sir; enliven me soon by another Letter. Yours ever</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>My dear good Mother,&#x2014;</salute>I purposed often, last week, to write you a little word; but was always put off again, by that old enemy, &#x201C;one thing and another!&#x201D; Not to be foiled a second time in the same way, I begin the week this time by doing that duty.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC is writing on Mon.</note> A small duty, and a most blessed one, which ought <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to be neglected!</p>
<p>We received Jenny&#x2019;s Letter, and another of more detail from Jean; by which we had comfortable news of you in the cold weather, that you were among the <foreign>Bairns</foreign>, nestling down as quietly as you could, and on the whole doing pretty well in spite of the bitter winds and frosts. Our weather, here too, has been very cold all this while, and the Northeast with its smoke (for it brings all London on the top of us in comparison) still prevails: but we heap on flannel (as I hope you do), and coals, and struggle on with nothing hitherto but the discomfort for the time, and on the whole have nothing to complain of. The weather, I suppose, is very good for the plougher and sower: nobody ought to complain that has food and shelter at present! We hear that the Irish, in addition to all their other woes, are this year in many cases refusing to plough or sow the ground at all: they say, &#x201C;Why should we raise a crop? Our Landlords will come and take it all; we shall get fed by the Government any way! We get a little money too for our horse-labour by carting Government-meal, at a penny a hundredweight for 10 miles; that is better than ploughing!&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In the House of Commons the pres. of the board of trade, Henry Labouchere, repeated his belief that in co. Mayo (or part of it) there was an armed conspiracy to prevent cultivation of the land (<hi rend="italic">Nation</hi>, <date when="1847-03-06">6 March</date>). In any event, land in the west was widely uncultivated because of lack of seed, emigration, and other reasons.</note> On the whole, I think there never was seen such a scene as that of Ireland; and I believe we are very far yet from having got to the bottom of it; the <hi rend="italic">bottom</hi> of it does not yet seem to be visible to the generality. From one to two millions of men, some calculate, will perish;&#x2014; <pb id="pg-21-177" n="21:177"/>and our time too, it seems very likely, lies close in the rear: I hope we may meet it a little more wisely!&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>Jack and I have sent you various Newspapers for a little reading in the vacant afternoons. One always goes off too which is intended for James Aitken; Jack had one left with him to despatch thither last night: I do not know that it is a good Newspaper; it seemed far too <hi rend="italic">small</hi> of print for one thing: but it is very cheap; and there <hi rend="italic">is</hi> no good Weekly Newspaper here that I know of, except the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, which would not at all suit James&#x2019;s purpose I am afraid. They can write me about it by and by.</p>
<p>In the way of putting pen to paper I am still altogether inactive, and decline every offer made me by such poor hawkers as call on me by chance for that object: but in the way of sorting the abstruse confusions within my own self (which I suppose is the first condition of writing to any purpose) I have plenty to do! And for doing it, I find, one good condition is to <hi rend="italic">hold your tongue</hi> if you can. Happily I now <hi rend="italic">can:</hi> my poor Books bring me in a little money now, to fill the meal-barrel, every year; and the wealth of all the Bank of England is daily a smaller and smaller object to me,&#x2014;indeed it is long since well near no object at all; which is perhaps a very good definition of being extremely <hi rend="italic">rich;</hi> the &#x201C;richest author in Britain&#x201C; at present? I think I shall hold my tongue for a pretty while yet; and <hi rend="italic">then</hi>, if I live, there will another word perhaps be found in me, which I shall be obliged to speak;&#x2014;a terribly hard job when it comes!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Perhaps the first stirrings that were to lead to the <hi rend="italic">Latter-Day Pamphlets</hi> and TC&#x2019;s journalism and unpbd. pieces about Ireland.

But tho&#x2019; it is not at all impossible I may make some sally out of London if the season were warmed a little, and Annandale too may lie in the cards,&#x2014;I have no thought that way at present; so stay still, and keep yourself warm and quiet where you are, so long as it is pleasant to you, dear Mother.&#x2014;</p>
<p>Jack is very strong and brisk here; dining out considerably, rushing about among his old friends. We had him yesterday; indeed oftenest see him every day. I do not find that he has any specific project of work in his mind: the far feasiblest-looking thing I have heard him hint, is that of setting up house in Dumfries with you and Jenny, &#x201C;and practising gratis among the poor&#x201C;; but, for that, he has come away at the wrong season; and indeed I think the matter is still very far from being matured in his mind.&#x2014; <pb id="pg-21-178" n="21:178"/>&#x2014; Dear Mother, here is a man coming (I hear his knock!) to take me out; here he enters! a gratis ride; it will do me good. But so I must end abruptly: in a very short time I will write again. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign> dear Mother: commend both of us to Jenny and Jean and all the rest. / ever Affectionately</salute></closer></p>

<p>I have not yet forgotten your kind invitation to look at the Schools under you; so soon as the weather mends a little, it is settled here that we address ourselves to perform that expedition.&#x2014;&#x2014; I read the <hi rend="italic">Life of Lancaster</hi> with much interest, and could willingly read many more such.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Corston, <hi rend="italic">Life of Joseph Lancaster</hi> (<date when="1840-00-00">1840</date>).

<p><salute>My dear Mother,&#x2014;</salute> Last time I wrote, my ending was somewhat abrupt, a <pb id="pg-21-179" n="21:179"/>benevolent man having suddenly arrived with a led horse to take me riding. I went out, and had an excellent long ride; found, however, that I must soon write to you again,&#x2014;one essential thing being still omitted. That essential thing I now enclose: the bit of paper accompanying this; which James Aitken, on or after Tuesday, will take to the Bank, and change for you into a &#xa3;5 Note. Part of this, if you find it to be needful,&#x2014;I do not know how much, according to your own good judgement,&#x2014;you may give to Jenny (as <hi rend="italic">your</hi> gift, according as you see good): with the remainder you are to buy yourself some little thing while you are in Dumfries, and take it home with you as <hi rend="italic">my</hi> poor gift, and affectionate remembrance of my good old Mother, whom I rank always, and ought to rank, among my chief blessings in this world. Now get yourself some nice little object that will do you good;&#x2014;or lay out the money in any way you like, dear Mother, and let me think I have given you a moment&#x2019;s pleasure with it!&#x2014; Jean, I think, was to let me know if Jenny&#x2019;s small income was like to be <hi rend="italic">too</hi> small for this dear season; she has not yet spoken; but I suppose it will be handiest to put the thing altogether under your charge who are upon the spot, and enable you to do with it according to the law of wisdom, as your own kind heart may interpret that.&#x2014; I suppose there is no risk whatever, this time, of the money&#x2019;s coming <hi rend="italic">safe</hi>; so that there need be no haste about replying for a day or two.</p>
<p>Jean wrote to me long ago, and I still remember my debt, and will pay it,&#x2014;as you may tell her. Tonight there is <hi rend="italic">another</hi> Newspaper sent for James, on trial; but it seems a very decidedly inferior one; and accordingly have already given orders that the former one, the <hi rend="italic">Weekly Times,</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Pbd. on Suns., <date when="1847-01-24">24 Jan. 1847</date>&#x2013;<date when="1885-09-27">27 Sept. 1885</date>.</note> be furnished me regularly; and he shall get that at the beginning of every week, until he send contrary orders. My chief objection to the thing is its painful <hi rend="italic">small print</hi>, which I take to be ill for the eyes: do not <hi rend="italic">you</hi> read it, dear Mother. The Newspapers, I find, to be mostly or all a very idle kind of reading (the &#x201C;common clatter of the Country&#x201C; put in types); and accordingly make very little of them serve me in general.</p>
<p>We have got bright Spring weather here; and hope the wretched cold is quite gone. Jane continues well; Jack is very well, and we see him often, as usual. I am still going mainly idle! Today I saw Peel walking in Kensington Gardens with a little Daughter;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >He had two das., Julia (<date when="1821-00-00">1821</date>&#x2013;<date when="1893-00-00">93</date>), m., <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>, to George Augustus Frederick Child-Villiers, Viscount Villiers, and Eliza (<date when="1822-00-00">1822</date>&#x2013;<date when="1883-00-00">83</date>).</note> I thought, &#x201C;My lad, you will have a shot at things by and by again!&#x201D; He looked across very kindly at me; whom I believe he knows by face: &#x201C;a jolly goodlike man.&#x201C;&#x2014; Tell Jean, if she would write me <hi rend="italic">again,</hi> I should take it very well! Some of them must tell me how <pb id="pg-21-180" n="21:180"/>you are without delay. We heard from Scotsbrig the other day: well. <closer><salute>Good night, dear Mother</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Many thanks for your two <hi rend="italic">Proofs;</hi> which are an affecting Gift to us here. They are certainly wrought out with excellent fidelity, both of them; it is long since one has seen such a bit of engraving. Both drawings are made the very most of: it strikes me, had you known the original Face,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> both would have been <hi rend="italic">improved</hi> in resemblance by you; the engraved Profile itself, in spite of the exaggeration of the lips &#x26;c, is decidedly <hi rend="italic">liker</hi> than the Sketch you had to work from. You have done your part very well.</p>
<p>I am not busy at present; I wish you had come up, that morning. It will always give me real pleasure to understand that you are prospering, or in defect of that, that you are faithfully struggling, like a man and artist, as you have all along done.</p>
<closer><salute>With many kind wishes &#x26; regards</salute></closer>

I noticed the young beauty, among the others, that day in Bagot Street;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In <date when="1846-09-00">Sept. 1846</date>.</note> but had I then known what was coming I should have taken a much closer survey. Pray give her my best regards; my true wishes that this new union may be blessed to you both, that you may have many happy, and, what is much more, many brave and noble years together in this world. If it be the will of the Fates, I shall be right glad to make farther acquaintance with this lady, perhaps under better auspices, some time by-and-by. The site of your new house (for we went by so many routes to Dundrum) is not at present very clear to me; <pb id="pg-21-181" n="21:181"/>may I know it better one day, and see with satisfaction what a temple of the Muses and stronghold of the heroisms and veracities you have made of it, even in these dark times! A man in all &#x201C;times&#x201C; makes his own world: this in the darkest condition of the elements is a gospel that should never forsake us.</p>
<p>I am very idle here at present; but surely, if I live, shall not always be &#x201C;idle.&#x201C; The world, mainly a wretched world of imposture from zenith to nadir, seems as if threatening to fall rapidly to pieces in huge ruin about one&#x2019;s ears; it seems as if in this loss of the poor Irish potato the last beggarly film that hid the abyss from us were snatched away, and now its black throat lay yawning, visible even to fools!

We shall see <foreign><hi rend="italic">Bocca stretta occhi sciolti</hi></foreign> [Pursed mouth, nimble eyes].<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >From a Tuscan proverbial expression.</note></p>

<p><salute>My dear Brother,&#x2014;</salute> We yesterday received your <hi rend="italic">Brantford Newspaper,</hi> dated about a month ago; a very welcome sign, with its <hi rend="italic">two strokes:</hi> I forwarded the cover of it with a little Note to our Mother; today I am to send the Paper, which may be worth <hi rend="italic">twopence</hi> to her, the sum that will carry it anywhither within our bounds here. The cost for bringing it <hi rend="italic">to</hi> us was exactly one halfpenny. Pray do not neglect another such, direct to Scotsbrig or hither, when you cannot write.&#x2014; We had news some time ago <pb id="pg-21-182" n="21:182"/>that your Liverpool Box had arrived;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Carlyle, grandson of Alexander, wrote in his &#x201C;Family History&#x201C;: &#x201C;It came to Hamilton by steamer, and Father [Thomas] drove the 29 miles with the farm waggon and brought it home. What it contained and how it was received is best told in father&#x2019;s own words: &#x2018;I can remember the excitement we young people were in when the lid was being pried 221 off and the contents appeared. Among the books were Shakespeare&#x2019;s plays, a fine edition, Plutarch&#x2019;s Lives, Burns&#x2019;s Poems, Rollins Ancient History, the Spectator by Addison, Ossian&#x2019;s Poems, etc. Among the clothing were two pilot hats for father and me, also a pilot coat for me, the latter a warm, comfortable article. Uncle said in a letter received about this time &#x201C;Tom will be grown a big fellow now. Let him try and fill the coat.&#x201C; Coat, in fact, was a little too big for me, but was highly prized&#x2019;&#x201C; (Marrs 644&#x2013;45). Alexander Carlyle also mentioned the box in a letter to TC (PM: Brantford, <date when="1847-03-21">21 March 1847</date>) of which only a fragment remains (MS: NLS Acc. 9086.59).</note> which gave us great satisfaction. Today being the American-mail day, I will, tho&#x2019; in very great hurry, send along with the last <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi> a small word of writing.</p>
<p>Our good old Mother, thanks be to Heaven, is still reported well: at Jack&#x2019;s departure she went to Dumfries; and there still continues; doing very well, they say; with Jenny, who has a nice little quiet place, looking out on a Roper&#x2019;s field, near the Courthouse,&#x2014;near the <hi rend="italic">Craigenputtoch</hi> end of Maxwelltown. From this our Mother goes down daily to Jean&#x2019;s at the bottom of Assembly street; talks with them, reads anything, newspaper or other, that is going; and, as I said already, is reported to do very well in her way. Good dear old Mother! We can do little for her: but we can all thank God that he has given us such a Mother, and still continues her with us. The winter, which has been very hard, is now at last gone, and we have bright South-western weather; which also will do her good.</p>
<p>Jack, as I believe he informed you, is come up to Town again; looking a shade <hi rend="italic">grayer</hi> than before; but otherwise brisk and hearty; &#x201C;touring about&#x201C; in the old style; has no very special business that I see, but doubtless enjoys the change after a long absence. His project is, in a vague manner, To take up house, in some neat way, with our Mother and Jenny, somewhere about Dumfries, and do what medical practice he likes, <hi rend="italic"><foreign>gratis</foreign>:&#x2014;</hi>really one of his most rational projects; but you know he is very difficult to tackle, and so will probably consume yet a long time in speculating!&#x2014; I am myself at present <hi rend="italic">writing</hi> nothing, almost uncertain whether I shall ever write more (for indeed I am getting <hi rend="italic">old</hi>, and disgusted with many things), yet not without plenty to <hi rend="italic">do</hi>, in the inner man of me and otherwise.</p>
<p>This year far excels in dark difficulty all that the British Nation ever saw: fierce actual <hi rend="small-caps">Starvation</hi> stalks thro&#x2019; Ireland, our rulers quite unable to meet it, and kills I believe literally his hundreds every day; and no relief is yet visible; nay I rather think it will be over into Scotland and England before all ends yet: in Scotland, in our own Annandale, it would already have been, had not the resource of the Railway labour (which will <hi rend="italic">end</hi> by and by) been there. A terrible account to settle! In Ireland, we heard <pb id="pg-21-183" n="21:183"/>yesterday, the people do undoubtedly refuse even to till their land for this year (our landlords will take it all, say they),&#x2014;they <hi rend="italic">wall</hi> themselves into their cabins (for <hi rend="italic">burial</hi> is not always to be had), and there silently lie down to die!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A leader in the <hi rend="italic">Nation</hi>, <date when="1847-03-13">13 March</date>, reprinted a letter from the parish priest at Skibbereen, saying that &#x201C;the ground continues unsown and uncultivated&#x201C; because tenants were afraid that landlords would seize the crop as soon as cut, while landlords withheld seed for fear tenants would consume it without paying rent. The Mayo <hi rend="italic">Constitution</hi> was quoted as saying that those who could neither leave the country nor live on it, &#x201C;build themselves up in their cabins, that they may die with their children, and not be seen by passers-by.&#x201C; The same leader declared, &#x201C;let the landlords beware.&#x201C;</note> The Gov<hi rend="italic">t</hi> has given them 11 millions; had really better have given them nothing at all; but told their scandalous landlords to go among them, and give,&#x2014;guidance and other things! What it is to end in none knows.&#x2014; Dear Brother, be courageous there, and diligent and content. <closer><salute>May God bless you all always. Our love to all the <foreign>Bairns</foreign>. Ever yours</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Tho&#x2019; I have long known you, in a very kind manner, thro&#x2019; Mr Emerson and otherwise, and have even made use of you as a practical Friend, our relation, very genuine in itself, has been hitherto a silent one. But now, it would appear, the time for speech too has come. I have a piece of real business to entrust you with; and I must ask you, as a very necessary favour, to take it up in the shape of business, (if you will be so good) to transact and articulately report accordingly.</p>
<p>Last year, as you are aware, in a Contract made with the Messrs Wiley &#x26; Putnam Booksellers of New-York, of which Contract my portion is now in your hands, I took the liberty to nominate you as my representative with them in all pecuniary matters that were to arise in consequence.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-20/lt-18460430-TC-RWE-01">TC to RWE, <date when="1846-04-30">30 April 1846</date></ref>, and <ref target="volume-20/lt-18460430-TC-RWE-01">TC to RWE, <date when="1846-06-18">18 June 1846</date></ref>. Emerson wrote to TC, <date when="1847-02-27">27 Feb.</date>, that he had called on Clark and asked &#x201C;if he had any report concerning your late books from Wiley &#x26; Putnam? No; Nor any letter from Mr Carlyle ever on that subject. That, I told him, I thought he should have. And I think you had better clothe his hands &#x26; warm his heart with an express authority to audit Wiley &#x26; Putnam&#x2019;s accounts with T.C. Write to him, I mean, &#x26; ask him directly &#x2026; to charge himself with this friendly office. I am sure he would take it in the kindest part &#x2026; He is so much a man of business that he cannot move in the matter without such an order; &#x26; it seems best, unless your direct dealings with W. &#x26; P. in London, have shown you better ways.&#x201C;</note> The <pb id="pg-21-184" n="21:184"/>Contract is sufficiently explicit: Corrected Copies of my Book with exclusive sanction to print the same; this on my side was the thing promised: on theirs was to be paid a Twentieth-part (I think it is) of the Selling-price of all the copies sold by them; and, what was a very special condition, particularly insisted on as the preliminary of all,&#x2014;an account as well, and fully payment on the same terms, of all the Copies <hi rend="italic">already</hi> sold (from the very <hi rend="italic">first</hi>, as well as henceforth) of my <hi rend="italic">Book on Cromwell</hi>, concerning which, owing to mistakes between my London Bookseller and them, there had not till then been any bargain between us. These conditions I think you will find clearly set forth in the written Papers, drawn up by Mr Putnam here and signed by both him and me, of which you now hold one, and Mr Wiley (I suppose) the other precisely of the same import.&#x2014; I have, on my side, a good many months ago, furnished Copies of all the Books, with due corrections &#x26;c, with an <hi rend="italic">Index</hi> to one of them (which was a more considerable improvement); and most of them, I suppose, are now on sale as Printed Books in the United States. On the Messrs Wiley &#x26; Putnam&#x2019;s side I have yet had no results, no money or accounts, or distinct intimation of such:&#x2014;solely, about a month ago, Mr Putnam here (whom I hardly ever have occasion to see), writing to me on some incidental matter, mentioned vaguely (if I remember) that a time of settlement <hi rend="italic">was</hi> coming, in the &#x201C;month of <date when="1847-06-00">June</date>&#x201C; which is now approaching us.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >G. P. Putnam had written, <date when="1847-01-22">22 Jan.</date>: &#x201C;I have just rec<hi rend="italic">d</hi> &#x2026; the Mss Index French Revolution, returned acc your directions, and I send it to you this evening per parcel mail. &#x2026; I have not rec<hi rend="italic">d</hi> as yet a copy of the American ed<hi rend="italic">n</hi>. for you, &#x26; fear the office at the Custom House would not let it pass. &#x2026; I hope a satisfactory account of our editions &#x2026; will be ready in due time. The a/c is made up upon on the <date when="1847-07-11">11<hi rend="italic">th</hi> July</date>.&#x201C;</note> This is the state of the Bargain: all performed on my side, and brought into the <hi rend="italic">preterite</hi> tense; on their side, al<supplied>[l]</supplied> still waited for (very naturally, I suppose), and to be demanded with due rigour of inspection from the <hi rend="italic">future</hi> tenses.</p>
<p>Of Messrs W. &#x26; P.&#x2019;s intention to keep these terms, as regular merchants and honourable men, I have no reason to entertain the smallest doubt. But it becomes important for me, as you will perceive,&#x2014;apart even from the probably very considerable <hi rend="italic">pecuniary</hi> interests involved in the business,&#x2014;to ascertain for myself, with the completest possible assurance, that the terms <hi rend="italic">are</hi> accurately kept; that no portion of the concern which is really mine in this matter be in any way huddled into twilight and confusion, but that it be all really seen into, managed, and made the best of,&#x2014;as it beseems all the concerns of a reasonable man, in this exact world, to be. The thing I want, and ought to want, in such circumstances, is very clear to you.</p>
<p>Now if you, as a real man of business, will undertake this charge for me, I shall, at all times, with the completest satisfaction I could have in it, be <pb id="pg-21-185" n="21:185"/>able to assure myself that it is actually getting itself done; that I personally need give myself no more trouble about it. The function to be performed is this simple one: To ascertain in some way that will be convincing to you, <hi rend="italic">How many</hi> Copies of my several Books the Messrs Wiley &#x26; Putnam do print (for which they zealously promise all manner of facilities, access to their Printers, Papermakers, to their Accounts &#x26;c &#x26;c); and then at the due term to exact payment for the same. In this country it is not difficult to ascertain in a convincing manner how many copies a Bookseller prints; but it is a thing, too, which cannot be done without trouble, without exertion, scrutiny and locomotion; in fact the whole charge I am struggling to put upon you is founded on work, on trouble.</p>
<p>For which reason, and according to an old principle of mine, I find it altogether indispensable that the man who undertakes this service for me must exact and receive <hi rend="italic">his due professional wages</hi>. This is the grand, indeed this is the one condition I shall require of you; if you concede this, I shall full surely understand with myself that this includes <hi rend="italic">all:</hi> but, for the same reason, this I say <hi rend="italic">is indispensable</hi>. Tell me you undertake the business professionally, for due wages, then the matter is already settled, and you are fully installed and authorized, and I shall be free of care thence-forth;&#x2014;and over above all wages, you will have done me a favour which I shall deeply acknowledge. About all which, I should hope, there need be no difficulty. But if, for whatever reason, you cannot accept the charge on these terms, then I will request you to consult with Mr Emerson and fix upon a man for me that will; to whom I may straightway consign it in due form: and so, in some good way, be fairly rid of the affair.&#x2014; <closer><salute>This is all I have leave to say for the present; except that (with many real regards and wishes) I am&#x2014;Yours always truly</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>Dear Emerson,&#x2014;</salute>Yesterday morning, setting out to breakfast with Richard Milnes (Milnes&#x2019;s breakfast is a thing you will yet have to experience) I met, by the sunny shore of the Thames, a benevolent Son of Adam in blue coat &#x26; red collar, who thrust into my hand a Letter from you. A truly miraculous Son of Adam in red collar, in the sunny Spring morning!&#x2014; The Bill of Seventeen Pounds is already far on its way to Dumfries, there to be kneaded into gold by the due artists: today is American Post-day; and <pb id="pg-21-186" n="21:186"/>already, in huge hurry about many things, I am scribbling you some word of answer.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In his letter of <date when="1847-02-27">27 Feb.</date> Emerson had enclosed a bill of exchange for &#xa3;17 representing payment of $83.68 from the publishing firm of Little &#x26; Brown; see Slater, <hi rend="italic">CEC</hi> 413&#x2013;14.</note> I have written, as you bade me, a long dull positive Letter to Mr Clark, which pray give to him when once you have read and sealed it: let me hope you will find the worthy man ready to undertake, and to proceed, without further bother to either of us; or that failing him, you will find some other (the approximately best in your circle) to set about the work, as real <hi rend="italic">work</hi>,&#x2014;and so let us have our hands washed of it. Very possible (tho&#x2019; I really have no cause to think it probable) the Wiley people may mean to pay me with large admixture of <hi rend="italic">chaff</hi> among their wheat; very possible too there may be no way of preventing it: but to do the approximately <hi rend="italic">best</hi> we can for preventing it,&#x2014;this is a clear duty; this let us do, this by your help one good time; and <hi rend="italic">then</hi>, &#x201C;with unspeakable composure,&#x201C;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >From Richter&#x2019;s &#x201C;Schmelzle&#x2019;s Journey to Flaetz&#x201C;; see <ref target="volume-21/lt-18470303-TC-KAVE-01">TC to KAVE, <date when="1847-03-03">3 March</date></ref>.</note> leave the outcome to the gods! The outcome will not kill us, either way, <hi rend="italic">then</hi>,&#x2014;thanks to Heaven.</p>
<p>The night <hi rend="italic">before</hi> Milnes&#x2019;s morning, I had furthermore seen your Manchester Correspondent, Ireland,&#x2014;an old Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> acquaintance too, as I found. A solid, dark, broad, rather heavy man; full of energy, and broad sagacity and practicality;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jewsbury had described Ireland, [<date when="1846-10-00">Oct.? 1846</date>], as &#x201C;talking away as fast as Carlyle, and speaking Scotch as broad as possible. &#x2026; He has black eyes and great strong black bushy eyebrows, such as Carlyle&#x2019;s soul delights in, and is very pleasant and genial&#x2014;not at all a Unitarian, but a strong, striding, healthy man.&#x201C;</note>&#x2014;infinitely well affected to the man Emerson too. It was our clear opinion that you might come at any time with ample assurance of &#x201C;succeeding,&#x201C; so far as wages went, and otherwise; that you ought to come, and must, and would,&#x2014;as he, Ireland, would farther write to you.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In his letter of <date when="1847-02-03">3 Feb.</date> Ireland discussed fees, saying that George Dawson, &#x201C;whose Lectures you may have heard of on Carlyle,&#x201C; usually had &#xa3;5 a lecture, and recently in Manchester &#xa3;10. Emerson, replied, <date when="1847-02-28">28 Feb.</date>, that he would consider <date when="1847-09-00">Sept.</date> and gave details of the fees he was used to (Rusk 3:379&#x2013;80). In fact, he sailed from Boston, <date when="1847-10-05">5 Oct.</date>, and arrived Liverpool, <date when="1847-10-22">22 Oct.</date></note> There is only one thing I have to add of my own, and beg you to bear in mind,&#x2014;a date merely. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Videlicet,</hi></foreign> That the time for lecturing to the London West-End, I was given everywhere to understand, is <hi rend="italic">from the latter <date when="1847-04-00">end of April</date></hi> (or say April altogether) <hi rend="italic">to the <date when="1847-05-00">end of May</date>:</hi> this is a fixed statistic fact, all men told me: of this you are in all arrangements to keep mind. For it will actually do your heart good to look into the faces, and speak into minds, of really Aristocratic Persons,&#x2014;being one yourself, you Sinner,&#x2014;and perhaps indeed this will be the greatest of all the <hi rend="italic">novelties</hi> that await you in your voyage. Not to be seen, I believe, at least never seen by me in any perfection, except in London only.</p>
<p>From <date when="1847-04-00">April</date> to the <date when="1847-05-00">end of May</date>; during those weeks you must be <hi rend="italic">here</hi>, and <pb id="pg-21-187" n="21:187"/>free: remember that date. Will you come in Winter then, next Winter,&#x2014;or when? Ireland professed to know you by the Photograph too; which I never yet can.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-20/lt-18460717-TC-RWE-01">TC to RWE, <date when="1846-07-17">17 July 1846</date></ref>.

<p>The day before yesterday, arrived your Clipping from the French Newspaper!&#x2014; Thanks. You are always gracious to me, always graceful,&#x2014;<foreign><hi rend="italic">gn&#xE4;dige Frau</hi></foreign> [gracious Lady]. This little piece of French fatuity, may it be to me a little mute messenger with sense and truth in the heart of it!</p>
<p>Of course I was much surprised, that Tuesday morning, when they answered me at Stanhope Street, &#x201C;Her Ladyship is gone to Paris, sir; not to be back till after Easter, sir!&#x201D; That same evening came your kind little note from Folkestone:&#x2014;and so you were away; and the ocean-tides and foreign Provinces already lay between us. By the will of the gods! Reflexions were numerous; profitable, and unprofitable.&#x2014; We have heard since that your Lady Mother&#x2019;s danger appears to be quite over; which surely is one blessed thing. I did not learn till Sunday last that Mr Baring was with you; the House lay all shut and smooth; Wills came out in serene benignity, very bright indeed: &#x201C;Not coming till <date when="1847-05-00">May</date>, Hy happrehend, sir!&#x201D; But I flatter myself he does not know. The &#x201C;will of the gods&#x201C; shall be done. That will be so, whether <hi rend="italic">we</hi> will or not; and it will be wise for us to be on the side of that, not on the opposite side, I think! On the whole, what an imbroglio is this world: here and there a thread of gold, imbedded in deep mountains of distracted rubbish,&#x2014;not to be extricated without almost miracles of labour! And again are there not threads of <hi rend="italic">tinsel</hi> too, which but <hi rend="italic">seem</hi> gold? I compare it to your opera music at Alverstoke: ravishing <hi rend="italic">notes</hi>, out of <pb id="pg-21-188" n="21:188"/>which no soul can build himself a rational <hi rend="italic">tune</hi>, that will tell him anything. I wish it would alter:&#x2014;but it will not, for some time.</p>
<p>We are very well here; very silent; full of meditations, of the abstrusest sort; which amount hitherto to little or nothing. &#x201C;The <hi rend="italic">in</hi>soluble case of biquadratics!&#x201D; That is a case constantly recurring, in this life; solution of it depends, say the Hindoo Algebraists, &#x201C;on a clear judgement and the blessing of God.&#x201C; Seriously I am, at present, in all manner of ways, very much at a pause. Never in my days have I been so <hi rend="italic">idle</hi>, seemingly and actually without movement anywhither, as in these late months. I feel disgusted with my trade (which has been a supreme blessing to me, too); disgusted with the whole pack of miserable rope-dancers who follow it in our day:&#x2014;and the times also are getting too <hi rend="italic">swift</hi> for books; I think often we are perhaps on the edge of great and terrible times. For all Reform-Bills are a small matter to this of the Potatoe, if it continue dead! And I would fain speak out the whole mind of me before I die. Shall I set up a weekly Newspaper? Shall I squeeze into Parl<hi rend="italic">t</hi> itself, and there <hi rend="italic">speak</hi> Pamphlets, hot and hot, right from the heart,&#x2014;and burn up the <hi rend="italic">World-Humbug!</hi></p>
<p><closer><salute><foreign>Adieu O sch&#xF6;nste, Beste</foreign> [most beautiful and best]: may the Heavens keep <hi rend="italic">you</hi>.</salute></closer></p>
<name>T.C.</name>
<ps><p>If you don&#x2019;t return soon, I will write again.</p>
<p>Last night at Bath-House all very good and pleasant; scanty news of <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, however.</p></ps>

<salute>My dear Sister,</salute>
<p>I designed to write you a word this morning at any rate; and lo, on coming down to breakfast, there lay your new Letter; which doubly binds me to fulfil my little purpose. In fact I should have written long since: I <hi rend="italic">might</hi> have found &#x201C;time&#x201C; too; but I have been getting very much &#x201C;detached,&#x201C; as W<hi rend="italic">m</hi> Corson said;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Corson (<date when="1809-00-00">1809</date>&#x2013;<date when="1897-00-00">97</date>), missionary and brother of the Carlyles&#x2019; neighbors at Nether Craigenputtoch; see <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310824-JWC-TC-01"><sic>5:360</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1831-08-24">24 Aug. 1831</date></corr></ref>.</note> keep very much <hi rend="italic">alone</hi>, with a great quantity of dumb things within me; and feel more and more disposed to <hi rend="italic">silence</hi>, as the handiest course by far,&#x2014;if I could get it carried on! Besides, you have heard my news pretty regularly, much the same as if I had been writing to yourself.&#x2014; But truly I am much obliged for your Letters, and ought to say so on occasion: a rugged substantial conclusive despatch, giving one a real <pb id="pg-21-189" n="21:189"/>face-to-face <hi rend="italic">view</hi> of affairs; this is what I get from Sister Jean when she writes; and well worth getting it is!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I know not what I wrote to John, or how it came to be shewn where it could give offence: but on the whole, never mind it. Poor Jenny is excusable for losing temper, even with her well-wishers, tho&#x2019; certainly it is a fault and weakness, and requires to <hi rend="italic">be</hi> excused. Wipe away all memory of it from your mind; do what is in you to make it <hi rend="italic">not have been there</hi>. The Devil alone is concerned in such things; and we are all solemnly bound to do what we can against them in ourselves and in others. See above all things that you <hi rend="italic">do</hi> the service I required of you for Jenny and me, do it in such way as you find possible: provided it <hi rend="italic">be</hi> done, the rest is all moonshine, and we <hi rend="italic">know</hi> to whom it belongs! &#x201C;A dibbel of a temper,&#x201C;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-02/lt-18230326-TC-JBW-01"><sic>2:316</sic><corr>TC to JBW, <date when="1823-03-26">26 March 1823</date></corr></ref>.</note> that is a terrible outfit,&#x2014;with which some others of us are not unprovided!</p>
<p>Clouden Bank<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A small property ca. 5 mi. NW of Dumfries.</note> is very tempting: nevertheless I believe we must not think of it at present. Many things are to be decided here; great practical riddles, such as arise in our life-pilgrimage, and are in fact our <hi rend="italic">life:</hi> I must not fly away from the solution of them; but wait it out here,&#x2014;and try, above all, to get it <hi rend="italic">rightly</hi> out; that is the point. Scotland looks now like a kind of &#x201C;Chelsea Hospital&#x201C;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A hospital for old and disabled soldiers.</note> to me; whither I cannot well return except with my <hi rend="italic">discharge</hi> in my pocket, and some wooden leg to shew for myself! Poor old Scotland.&#x2014; And yet perhaps if the railway were in action, why should one not come and live there (<hi rend="italic">without</hi> being invalided), and make London still one&#x2019;s headquarter? We shall see by and by. London, with many drawbacks, has one advantage: it is the home of <hi rend="italic">Freedom,</hi> for the like of me. In good truth, no king in all the earth is so royal, as any poor thinking man can here be, with an independent heart in his body, and barely money in his pocket to pay his way. All manner of princes, dukes and drakes go by him like as many Phantasms; he, in his rusty coat, alone has meaning,&#x2014;and is even alone <hi rend="italic">felt</hi> to have. A King he, as I often say, and the only King: a King with <hi rend="italic">one</hi> subject! Upon the whole it is much more difficult to manage that, I believe, in any other place than it is in huge reeky London here: one must struggle to be content with reek &#x26;c in virtue of that.</p>
<p>Poor old Mary Grier,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >(d. <date when="1861-00-00">1861</date>), possibly a relative of &#x201C;poor sick Grier&#x201C;; see <ref target="volume-20/lt-18460416-TC-JCA-01">TC to JCA, <date when="1846-04-16">16 April 1846</date></ref>.</note> I am heartily sorry for her new mischance! She certainly had little need of an addition to her complicated difficulties, of poverty, old age, and all the rest. Can anything be done for her? I suppose there could, and must; and yet by me, I know not what. I wish you would consider the whole matter, you and James, and suggest what possibility there is. In the meanwhile, if, as is likely you see any possibility of helping <pb id="pg-21-190" n="21:190"/>her by a trifle of money, I bid you borrow a sovereign from James for me, and give it out to her as you find suitablest:&#x2014;I will faithfully pay; and thank you, for being my <foreign><hi rend="italic">almoner</hi></foreign> in this case, over and above. Do not neglect this. Alas, old age is itself a sufficient claim: and there are many other ills accumulated on that poor old body. Do not let her want for any help that I could justly undertake to give her; but warn me of it, call on me for it, you who are within sight.</p>
<p>Your accounts of our good Mother are still favourable, tho&#x2019; not quite unclouded: I shall want to hear <hi rend="italic">instantly</hi> again; the sooner some of you can write, the better. I need not bid you be kind and gentle to her, good old Mother. In my solitude here (for I like far best, for most part, to be <hi rend="italic">alone</hi>), she is often present to me: her life and my own, as it lies buried for us in the &#x201C;Halls of the Past,&#x201C; often comes up before me, all transfigured into <hi rend="italic">spirit</hi>; and simple voices speaking strange things to me out of the old dead years. &#x201C;Every man&#x2019;s Life,&#x201C; says one of the Germans,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably Fichte or Novalis; see Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi> 177n.</note> &#x201C;is a <hi rend="italic">Bible</hi>, if he will read it.&#x201C; Which is most true. For the great God made us; and in marvellous ways goes with us, guiding us to the end. Amen, Amen!&#x2014; Of all the blessings I have had in this world, surely the <hi rend="italic">first</hi>, as I feel well, were the Father and Mother I was born of. No Dukedom or Princedom is worth rating beside that Corner-stone of all one&#x2019;s destinies in this world, and all one&#x2019;s works there,&#x2014;the Parentage one had! Let us thank God, in this evil time; and along with our afflictions joyfully accept what truly makes them all into <hi rend="italic">blessings</hi>, if we are wise!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Here is a clipping from an American Newspaper, which Jane cuts out for you; not worth much, she things;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> but the carrying of it will cost <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi>. It is a Yankee woman&#x2019;s doing (one Miss Fuller, a friend of Emerson&#x2019;s whom we saw here, rather a good woman): I remember I <hi rend="italic">was</hi> somewhat loud upon her and upon certain crochets of hers.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Evidently from Margaret Fuller&#x2019;s &#x201C;Things and Thoughts in Europe &#x2026; IX,&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">New York Tribune</hi>, a series of letters, undated; rptd. in her <hi rend="italic">At Home and Abroad</hi>, ed. Arthur B. Fuller (Boston, <date when="1856-00-00">1856</date>): &#x201C;He does not converse,&#x2014;only harangues. &#x2026; Carlyle allows no one a chance, but bears down all opposition, not only by his wit and onset of words, resistless in their sharpness as so many bayonets,&#x2014;but by actual physical superiority,&#x2014;raising his voice, and rushing on his opponent with a torrent of sound. &#x2026; You do not love him, perhaps, nor revere, and perhaps also he would laugh at you if you did; but you like him heartily&#x201C; (184).</note>&#x2014; Emerson, I rather guess, is coming over next &#x201C;Fall,&#x201C; on a Lecturing expedition; chiefly to Lancashire &#x26;c, but to include London too: we had a Manchester Philosopher last night here,<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alexander Ireland.</note> who is arranging the matter for him I like the man Emerson right well, and have reason to do so.</p>
<p>Tonight Thomas Erskine is coming to us to dine; Jack is to be too, and no <pb id="pg-21-191" n="21:191"/>other. Jack is wonderfully well; cheerful, brisk, whenever one sees him; and <hi rend="italic">busy</hi>, tho&#x2019; without much work. I think he will come to Dumfriesshire in the end; that, gradually, tho&#x2019; at a distance still, begins to seem the likeliest.&#x2014; Poor old Sterling is getting utterly feeble, <hi rend="italic">broken</hi> in body and in mind: he drives about, all day, in his carriage, <hi rend="italic">not</hi> knowing whitherward except for moments;&#x2014;under the care of a most patient coachman He seems weaker every new time he calls here.</p>
<p>James seems very busy: let him not regret that! Tell Jenny, with thanks, her Note came duly;&#x2014;my Mother will tell her. And write soon some of you. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign></salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>My dear Mother,&#x2014;</salute>I am inexcuseable if I do not write you a word today; these two days, fully purposing to do it, I have <hi rend="italic">forgotten</hi> till it was too late each day,&#x2014;for this is now the <hi rend="italic">third</hi> day since the respectable Dumfries <hi rend="italic">Ham</hi> arrived, safe, in all its magnitude! Thanks, dear Mother; you are never weary doing us kindnesses; and how welcome and affecting to us are your acts of remembrance! We thank the beneficent Heavens too that we have still a Mother with that heart. In the wide world will never be found another so kind to us!&#x2014; &#x2014; But, on the whole, we call this <hi rend="italic">Ham</hi> a most spirited affair in itself: the sending of it shews somebody, I think, to be a &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">lass of spearet!</hi>&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; cf. <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310904-TC-JWC-01"><sic>5:396</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1831-09-04">4 Sept. 1831</date></corr></ref>.</note> Does it not? The cost of carriage was precisely 4/9,&#x2014;a cheap rate. We mean to break bulk on the article before long: Jane would not open it yet till we have got quite thro&#x2019; another small one, which was undertaken lately, and is pretty well thro&#x2019; now. Thanks, thanks,&#x2014;and <foreign><hi rend="italic">may ne&#x2019;er waur</hi></foreign> [worse] <hi rend="italic">be amang us</hi>.&#x2014; &#x2014; Did I ever thank you for the <hi rend="italic">soap-bars</hi> <pb id="pg-21-192" n="21:192"/>you sent? Enough to shave me for years. And every day I reflect on the giver: for in truth it is an excellent article, and answers the end <hi rend="italic">better</hi> than any <hi rend="italic">Windsor, Perfumed, Naples,</hi> or other barber-composition I can fall in with here.</p>
<p>I got Jean&#x2019;s Letter duly, and witnessed your visit to Bonerick;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >6 mi. W of Dumfries, home of Margaret Carlyle&#x2019;s sister Nickie; see <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390728-TC-JAC-01"><sic>11:158</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1839-07-28">28 July 1839</date></corr></ref>.</note> thankful to see you moving about, when the time favoured. There has been much hard weather since you came to Dumfries; very cold here, as no doubt it has been with you too: but the wind is turned into the West now, which is much wholesomer whether wet or dry; and all things are beginning to look a little green. The people have what they call &#x201C;Easter-holidays&#x201C; during this week; that is to say, the Parliament and certain Public Offices are shut;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Easter Sun. had been <date when="1847-04-04">4 April</date>. Parliament, in recess since <date when="1847-03-31">31 March</date>, reconvened <date when="1847-04-12">12 April</date>.</note> and on some days the commonalty drink more <hi rend="italic">gin:</hi> but with us it makes no difference at all. I still keep <hi rend="italic">silent</hi>, very solitary; am <foreign><hi rend="italic">airch</hi></foreign> [undecided] to begin writing anything,&#x2014;and indeed I feel myself to be still a long way off writing much; tho&#x2019; perhaps there is a good <supplied>[book]</supplied><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> still to be written, if I live. The whole world, as I often think, is breaking up into bottomless confusion; and one knows not what to say to it, or write to it, all at once!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Meanwhile Jane is very busy putting up window-curtains, getting new covers made for sofas; meaning, I suppose, to be very bright when the sunny days come. She is a diligent little creature; and, like all of us, is always the better for some work. The Doctor I saw two nights ago, and shall perhaps see in few minutes: he has got a great many Book<supplied>[s]</supplied><note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> about him, and is reading with great vigour,&#x2014;not for any specific object, I think You often get a Newspaper from him;&#x2014;and many a good wish along with it: some of the <hi rend="italic">wishes</hi> may grow to good <hi rend="italic">results</hi> by and by, perhaps!&#x2014; Dear <closer><salute>Mother, I must beg again that somebody would write to me, half a word, about your goings on. Thank Jenny for her Letter. Take care of yourself! Ever your son</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>It was not I that wrote the Cromwell-Hampden Tract; I have not even read it, except what I saw in the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Childs wrote to TC, <date when="1847-04-15">15 April</date>, that he had recently read the <hi rend="italic">Tract entitled True and Faithful Relation of a Worthy Discourse between Colonel John Hampden and Colonel Cromwell</hi> (<date when="1847-00-00">1847</date>), purporting to be by the Puritan divine William Spurstowe (<date when="1605-00-00">1605</date>?&#x2013;<date when="1666-00-00">66</date>), &#x201C;for the reprint of which I have come to the conclusion we are endebted to nobody but yourself.&#x201C; The <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> had reviewed it at some length, <date when="1847-02-27">27 Feb.</date></note> By the extracts given there, I perceived that it was a <hi rend="italic">modern</hi> piece; and guessed, for my own behoof, that probably it was by Savage Landor, a man who, as you know, is accustomed <pb id="pg-21-194" n="21:194"/>to &#x201C;Imaginary Dialogues,&#x201C; and struggles to express in that, and other still more obstructed ways, various manful ideas that are in him.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The work was by George Nugent Grenville (<date when="1788-00-00">1788</date>&#x2013;<date when="1850-00-00">1850</date>; <ref target="volume-21/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/11491"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), Baron Nugent, not by Walter Savage Landor, though he wrote <hi rend="italic">Imaginary Conversations of Literary Men and Statesmen</hi>, 5 vols.

<p>I have come up hither to John&#x2019;s room with that Letter of Alick&#x2019;s, that I might have it read by John, and so send it off to you without any delay at all. <pb id="pg-21-195" n="21:195"/>Jack has read the Letter; is putting on his coat to go out walking with me: so I must be <hi rend="italic">brief</hi> in this word I write!</p>
<p>Poor Alick, you will see, is doing well, on the whole. I suppose we must consider that attempt at a new purchase of land as a good symptom on his part,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; of course we cannot expect that he will have the money ready, or any great part of it. He shall be helped to buy it, if the step seem wise.</p>
<p>Jack is well, all but a kind of cold which he seems to have got out of these fierce East winds. At our house we continue as before: Jane I left very busy <hi rend="italic">fitting on</hi> her new curtains, sofa-covers &#x26;c. We have broken into the Ham! It is an excellent article; has a beautiful <hi rend="italic">wild</hi> taste contracted from some peculiar sort of smoking, I suppose. It is very <hi rend="italic">good</hi> to coffee, in a cold morning; worth thanks once more!&#x2014; Take care of yourself, dear Mother, in this fierce weather. Let some of them write. I will write myself again soon. <closer><salute>Blessings with you always!&#x2014; Your affectionate&#x2014;</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name></p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>A good many months ago I did myself the pleasure of addressing to you a Copy of the second edition of a Book on <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi>, which was just coming out here. Another Copy was adjoined, with the ad<supplied>[d]</supplied>ress<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> of my Brother in Canada (A. Carlyle, Brantford, Canada West): and there went a Note for you, I know not now whether in the Parcel itself or by Post, requesting that you would have the goodness to forward this second Copy to Brantford, as you had once before very kindly served me on a similar occasion,&#x2014;the route to Brantford for <hi rend="italic">Parcels</hi> not being very open to us in London.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-20/lt-18460620-TC-JG-01">TC to JG, <date when="1846-06-20">20 June 1846</date></ref>.</note></p>
<p>No notice has reached me that this Packet ever yet got to Canadaigua; a circumstance I should only have imputed to some natural delay on your part, perhaps to some purpose you might have of writing to me on a more important matter. But learning yesterday, by a Letter from my Brother, that his Copy too has never come to hand, I begin to fear that some bad chance has befallen the Parcel altogether, and that I get no notice from Canadaigua because there is no thing there to be noticed!</p>
<p>Accordingly I have been to my Bookseller here; who turns up his records, and points out to me, entered in due form, the reception of the Parcel, altogether as ordered by me, at the London shop of Messrs Wiley and Putnam the New-York Booksellers, on the <date when="1846-06-22">22<hi rend="italic">d</hi> of June</date> last. On that day <pb id="pg-21-196" n="21:196"/>of <date when="1846-06-00">June, 1846</date>, Mr Putnam&#x2019;s people here accepted the Parcel for transmission to the Wiley and Putnam establishment at New York,&#x2014;by whom, I think, there is little doubt, it would be received some time in <date when="1846-07-00">July</date> following. That is the state of the fact.&#x2014; And now, would you be so kind as address a little inquiry to the Wiley and Putnam House at New York, as to How the matter stands <hi rend="italic">there</hi>,&#x2014;we should get upon the trace of this small affair, and soon hunt it home, wherever its <hi rend="italic">home</hi> may be. Pray do me this favour; that so my poor little purpose be not quite foiled by mismanagement, but do still take effect, tho&#x2019; late. And so enough of that.</p>
<p>We are pretty well here; my Wife rallying in fair strength out of the storms of Winter, which were a little hard upon her this year, and seem still rather loath to quit us altogether. We had an unusually cold sharp winter; neither has the Sun even yet got the <hi rend="italic">final</hi> victory, tho&#x2019; now near it: meanwhile an excellent seedtime, say the wise, tho likely to give us a harvest rather <hi rend="italic">late</hi>,&#x2014;which will not be very suitable in present circumstances. It is inconceivable what an uproar and misery has been, and is like to be, in consequence of that wretched Irish root taking to <hi rend="italic">rot</hi>, last year! I believe it will prove the most serious thing we have ever had to deal with in England since you and I first knew it. Worth a hundred &#x201C;reform-bills,&#x201C;&#x2014;if the Potatoe do but <hi rend="italic">continue</hi> rotten: which, as a lover of sharp rather than of chronic maladies, I confess I wish it may do. For it is want of sense and honesty, not want of potatoes, that we now suffer under: all the yearly potatoes of the British Empire are supposed to be worth some 20, or 25 or 30 millions; and all the yearly <hi rend="italic">harvest</hi> of the British Empire (the general <hi rend="italic">fruit of the soil</hi> each year, <hi rend="italic">independently</hi> of manufactures, and work in all other kinds) must be between 200 and 300 millions:&#x2014;a Nation, one would say, that reaped such a harvest (good all of it, except the potatoes) last year, and had so many Manchesters and other big Workshops going,&#x2014;this Nation should not die for the loss of a few potatoes, if it <hi rend="italic">had</hi> &#x201C;sense and honesty&#x201C; in it! We must try to <hi rend="italic">get</hi> sense and honesty, in some adequate measure; nay we shall have to do it, as I see: wherefore my prayer is, The potatoe may <hi rend="italic">stay</hi> well away, if it please!&#x2014; We here, in this house, have been learning to eat Indian meal to our meat, all winter; but have not yet made much of it: &#x201C;Not good, but may be eaten&#x201C;; that is all.&#x2014; Next time you come over, or still better if Mrs Greig were with you, it would be charitable to bring us a receipt or two.</p>
<p>Last autumn I was two days at Moffat:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A town on the Dumfries-Edinburgh road, where John Greig originated.</note> they are tearing up the whole country there; carrying their railway from Carlisle and London thro&#x2019; the Evan valley, towards Glasgow and Edin<hi rend="italic">r:</hi> to be open as far north as <pb id="pg-21-197" n="21:197"/>Beattock in August next, they say.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Along Evan Water, which rises in Crawford and flows SE to join the Annan SE of Moffat. Beattock is 2 mi. SW of Moffat. The London-Carlisle railway was being extended to Glasgow over the pass at Beattock as the Caledonian railway. The <hi rend="italic">Dumfries Courier</hi>, <date when="1847-05-15">15 May</date>, reported excellent progress on the Evan Valley section by 1,200 navvies using three tons of gunpowder a week.</note> The Country was redolent of more whiskey and blackguardism, every village (Moffat among others) full of drunk <hi rend="italic">Navvies;</hi> not pleasant to see!</p>
<p><closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, my dear Sir: we salute you and yours heartily, with the feeling of old friends. Are you not coming soon to see us? Very sincerely yours</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>My dear Brother,&#x2014;</salute>About a month ago your two Brantford <hi rend="italic">Newspapers</hi> came to hand; and I wrote you a little Note in return: John has since told me that the Packets did not go in the middle of <date when="1847-03-00"><hi rend="italic">March</hi></date> (they only begin to go <hi rend="italic">twice</hi> a month in <date when="1847-04-00">April</date>, he says); so that you would not get the Note till after delays. But now, two days ago, your <hi rend="italic">Letter</hi> has come: and I straightway address myself to write again in answer to that: this <hi rend="italic">Monday</hi>, it seems, is the very day of sailing; wherefore I must not omit,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; I have nasty <hi rend="italic">Doctor&#x2019;s drugs</hi> in me, and am otherwise but ill fitted for such a service!&#x2014; We sent off your Letter directly to our Mother, who is still at Dumfries: you may fancy it would be right welcome to her, and to them all. I have still to report, for your satisfaction, that her health is said to be very tolerable, in spite of the cold rigorous Spring we have; that all our Friends in Dumfriesshire are struggling along much in the old fashion; what we may call &#x201C;gay weel, everything considered.&#x201C;&#x2014; Provisions are still somewhat dear; but they are now <hi rend="italic">falling</hi>, some think they will by and by be quite cheap, for in spite of the potatoes the general harvest of England, and of the world, appears to have been rather good: at any rate in Lowland Scotland generally the people have plenty of work, and all this year have been much better off than usual, owing to the railways they are busy with. The confusion of <hi rend="italic">famine</hi> is nowhere traceable except in Ireland and the Highlands, in the <hi rend="italic">latter</hi> of which regions it seems to prove <hi rend="italic">curable</hi>, in the former <hi rend="italic">not at all;</hi> the millions of money <hi rend="italic">in Ireland</hi> are expended to no purpose, for the people are themselves false and mad, and God only knows what is to become of them. They are sitting idle, in this precious seed time, <pb id="pg-21-198" n="21:198"/>and refusing to dig their lands!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Nation</hi>, <date when="1847-04-17">17 April</date>, reported from Mayo that for six miles round Westport there were not ten acres under cultivation, though this was not true of other parts according to &#x201C;Prospects of the Next Harvest&#x201C; in the same issue.</note>&#x2014; I suppose it to be very certain that you will get better markets for your Indian Corn, and all your produce, by and by. That seems to me inevitable, however things may go. Nay it is likely, I should say, there may be a great increase of population <hi rend="italic">brought</hi> from the old Country to those regions before many years: in any case as you increase in numbers, you may hope to improve in arrangements, for markets and for all things. In the meanwhile he that tills his field, like an honest worker, under the eternal sky, <hi rend="italic">he</hi> may esteem himself very certain of <hi rend="italic">his</hi> task, and a fortunate man, as things go in this mad world.</p>
<p>I am greatly delighted to hear that Tom and Jane are <hi rend="italic">readers:</hi> bid them persevere in that, and read <hi rend="italic">with attention</hi>, always trying to learn something. A few Books sent out to <hi rend="italic">Bield</hi> seems to be a kind of seed-corn that may may yield very abundant fruit, in proportion to its value!&#x2014; Very sorry to hear that your <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> had never yet got to hand. I went off straightway to the Bookseller; found that your Copy and Mr Greig&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">had</hi> indubitably been sent off, towards New-York, on the <date when="1846-06-22">22<hi rend="italic">d</hi> of June</date> last:&#x2014;but I have never yet heard a word from Mr Greig about his own Copy either; wherefore I begin to think they have both miscarried; so, by this Post, I have written to Greig about it, and we shall be at the bottom of the matter by and by. For the rest, if the <hi rend="italic">second</hi> American edition be out, I should not wonder if it were procurable almost cheaper than the price of the carriage will be! I have had <hi rend="italic">three</hi> American reprints here (all of the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> edition), and one of them in very small type sells actually for half a dollar.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >There were apparently an edn. by Colyer (Dyer 65), more than one edn. by Wiley &#x26; Putnam, one by Harper&#x2019;s (N.Y., <date when="1848-00-00">1848</date>), and perhaps others; see also Tarr 112&#x2013;13 and <ref target="volume-20/lt-18460102-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1846-01-02">2 Jan. 1846</date></ref>.</note>&#x2014; The vindication of Cromwell&#x2019;s memory, I think, has been almost complete here; and has surprised many a one exceedingly, and as I believe will do an immense <hi rend="italic">good</hi> in time. That is something for one&#x2019;s pains,&#x2014;nay that is <hi rend="italic">all</hi> things!&#x2014;&#x2014; I am not got to any new work yet: I am sitting silent; often enough in a very melancholic, sad and confused state; but shall, if I live, have several things to say yet. I keep very solitary; my thoughts are abundantly austere, sorrowful often as death: but it is all nonsense to call that &#x201C;miserable&#x201C;; I have found that all <hi rend="italic">good</hi> whatsoever has to come to one in that way. The people they call &#x201C;happy&#x201C; are to me not an enviable people, any more than the cattle and sheep are. The thing we call &#x201C;misery&#x201C; is nothing whatever but <hi rend="italic">work to do</hi>, work of some kind or other, outward or inward, which we have not yet seen how to undertake and set hand to:&#x2014;let us never forget that!</p>
<p><pb id="pg-21-199" n="21:199"/>Dear Brother, I know not what to say to you about that new bit of land you have in view. Apparently it might be of real use to you: if the people were wise they would all save bits of their forest for fuel,&#x2014;they will even have to keep the cattle out of them, if <hi rend="italic">young</hi> trees are to grow, and the bit of forest is to <hi rend="italic">continue</hi>. Scotland itself has got all peeled bare, simply by neglect of that.&#x2014; Very useful for fuel, and perhaps for rounding off your present possessions &#x26;c; that seems to me likely: and surely if you could by your industry, prudence and energy compass the purchase of it,&#x2014;yes, then, my dear Brother I should say it was worth untold gold to you; better than a whole domain that had dropped to you out of the skies, of its <hi rend="italic">own</hi> accord! That is the foundation of all I at this distance can think about it, or advise about it. You yourself must decide. And if you dare purchase it, do not let the terror of &#x201C;debt&#x201C; stand in your way for a moment: I have spoken to Jack, and he and I are both willing to do about it whatsoever <hi rend="italic">you</hi> could deliberately wish: and so, if you do purchase, the money in full tale shall be advanced to you whenever you like,&#x2014;and I think you will not be put to the horn for payment of it before your time; and, in the meanwhile, <hi rend="italic">three percent</hi> interest is all that anybody could lose by it: that were the whole extent of the favour done; and so you could acquire your new land, without obligation to anybody, and look upon it as a bit of <hi rend="italic">victory</hi> you had gained; which we calculate would be a high satisfaction to you in your new battlefield! This, my dear Brother, is all I can specifically say. If you decide to purchase the land, the thing I have said above shall be at once and right cheerfully done;&#x2014;and very <hi rend="italic">glad</hi> we shall be that you have deliberately formed such a decision: and if the money be <hi rend="italic">never</hi> repaid, I think that will not be our <hi rend="italic">chief</hi> regret in regard to the matter. So do what <hi rend="italic">you</hi> find wise, there, in your own shoes, on the spot; and may the Heavens send a blessing on it. That is all.</p>
<p>You get no news from me, this time: Jack, I believe, would remember far more <hi rend="italic">news</hi>. In fact, for us, there are what one calls <hi rend="italic">none</hi>;&#x2014;which perhaps is the best news. Jack was with us last night; usually dines here on Sunday. He is very well; reading &#x26;c &#x26;c, with great bustle and ardour: poor fellow, I do not think he will ever get to any <hi rend="italic">fixed</hi> employment fit for him; which is a true pity. He is perceptibly <hi rend="italic">grayer</hi> since you went; I too am now getting decidedly gray,&#x2014;what other can I do at these years! In fact I admit to myself the astonishing fact of <hi rend="italic">old age</hi>, which never came rightly home to my door till not long since. I think one need not long much to be young again, according to the sample <hi rend="italic">we</hi> had of it! My notion is, that perhaps the <hi rend="italic">best</hi> of our days (if we grow <hi rend="italic">wise</hi>) are still coming.</p>
<p>You have not said anything about Brother John for some time. Has he gone to his new place? I send him weekly an <hi rend="italic">Irish</hi> Newspaper: I hope he understands that I very much detest all that mad stuff that they write in it <pb id="pg-21-200" n="21:200"/>about &#x201C;Repeal&#x201C; &#x26;c, and indeed I very seldom <hi rend="italic">read</hi> anything of all that: but the fact is, the Paper comes to me <hi rend="italic"><foreign>gratis</foreign>;</hi> and it contains a tolerable summary of News, apart from its mad repeal stuff; so I send it him.&#x2014; The people<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Young Ireland group.</note> are great disciples of mine; but I think I have very little credit of them: in fact, they seem not unlikely to get themselves shot, or hanged for treason, by and by!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Dear Brother, I must now end. Jane, who is pretty well, in spite of the cold, sends you her kind love, you and all yours, her Namesake of course included. Tom, I suppose, is grown a big fellow now. A bit of good stuff, I hope! Tell him to be patient, peaceable, wise, in all ways <hi rend="italic">strong</hi>, and not to discredit the kind!&#x2014; <closer><salute>Farewell, dear Brother. Tell us about your land, so soon as settled. Yours ever</salute></closer></p>

<ps><p>&#x201C;By the bye!&#x201D;&#x2014;I believe the way to spell &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Beild</hi>&#x201C; (as we now have it) is <hi rend="italic">Bield</hi> (with the <hi rend="italic">i</hi> before the <hi rend="italic">e</hi>): let us attend to that! I have looked in the Dictionary, and found it actually so&#x2014;&#x201C;Bield&#x201C;: and so write it on the cover here.</p></ps>

<p><salute>My dear Mother,&#x2014;</salute>There has a little Note come from Jean this morning; for which, with its good tidings, I am heartily obliged to her. Say, with our thanks, that I will pay in good time;&#x2014;thank Jenny also for her punctual little Message,&#x2014;only tell her, I pray you, to get some <hi rend="italic">blacker ink</hi>, for one can hardly make out what the writing is in that faint sky-blue!&#x2014; To all my kind creditors I will pay in time: but in the meanwhile they remind me that I meant to write <hi rend="italic">you</hi> a half word today; and that I will now do; which the others also can take for a kind of interim answer.</p>
<p>I duly replied to Alick by the American Packet; wrote about his copy of Cromwell, too, to Mr Greig. The answer about his little new purchase of land, was, after consulting with John, in the way of <hi rend="italic">encouragement</hi>, to proceed if <hi rend="italic">he</hi> himself saw good. The purchase-<hi rend="italic">money</hi> was to be ready here; and he might look upon it as a <hi rend="italic">loan</hi>, if he liked it better that way; the <hi rend="italic">repayment</hi>, I promised, would never <hi rend="italic">put him to the horn</hi> for delay.&#x2014; Poor fellow, if it can do him any real <hi rend="italic">good</hi>, it were but a small favour, and well worth doing, to <hi rend="italic">give</hi> that little help, in the form of loan or in any better form. He has a rigorous earnest life, over in his new home yonder; but I believe he is really doing well in it,&#x2014;not making money perhaps, but making out a manful industrious existence, which is better.</p>
<p>We have still very fierce weather; of quite extraordinary coldness for the day of the month; there has been but one truly genial day yet, that I recollect; and none of the trees are yet in full leaf. I often think anxiously how my poor Mother is getting on, in so unfavourable a temperature: it can agree well with nobody, that continual affliction to the <hi rend="italic">Skin</hi>. Keep yourself warm; do not stir out at night or too early! I think it will be as well if you <pb id="pg-21-202" n="21:202"/>leave Scotsbrig alone till the leaves and the sunshine are fairly come? One has but little resource there when the weather commands imprisonment within doors.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Carlyle wrote to his mother, <date when="1847-04-30">30 April</date>, advising her to move from Scotsbrig to Dumfries, &#x201C;where you can have society &#x26; so many daily &#x26; necessary conveniences. Both Tom &#x26; I w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> like greatly to see you placed to your mind in some good house at Dumfries&#x201C; (MS: NLS Acc. 9086).</note>&#x2014; We hear there is everywhere a crop <hi rend="italic">sown</hi> in the best circumstances, and looking well so far as it has come; the promise everywhere, they say, of a good harvest but a <hi rend="italic">late</hi> one. That will be a great blessing, for the poor Irish and others! But a still <hi rend="italic">greater</hi> would be some better harvest of <hi rend="italic">truth</hi> and good <hi rend="italic">sense</hi>, for the next and coming years: as I have often said, it is not <hi rend="italic">potatoes</hi> that they want nearly so much as <hi rend="italic">honesty</hi> among them; poor wretches, sitting <hi rend="italic">idle</hi>, in the midst of famine, in this blessed seedtime once more offered them: <hi rend="italic">idle</hi>, and won&#x2019;t strike a spade into the ground, &#x201C;for the Landlords will seize it all for rent&#x201C;! The Landlords and Landtillers together have made a precious <hi rend="italic">practical veracity</hi> out of it, between them! The Sun, I believe, never saw such another. What is to become of it no man yet knows; the wisest men are the least disposed to guess.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>Jack was here last night; going off to hear some &#x201C;Lecture,&#x201C; which he wanted me to attend: but I was asleep on the sofa upstairs, after dinner, and there was no time to be lost; so the Doctor went by himself, without sight <supplied>[of]</supplied><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> me. He is always busy, among Books &#x26;c &#x26;c, and sails about among many acquaintances, of which the Town, for him and for everybody, is getting fuller and fuller at this season. Perhaps he <hi rend="italic">will</hi> yet get something reasonable to do, poor fellow: in the meanwhile, he is well, and by no means unhappy.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John wrote his mother, <date when="1847-04-30">30 April</date>: &#x201C;I myself lead a rather solitary life, but have plenty of work, &#x26; by means of it keep Satan at arm&#x2019;s length, &#x26; myself in tolerable comfort. The old want of a stated task still comes strongly upon me from time to time.&#x201C;</note> Doubtless he meditates a return to Scotland by and by, perhaps before very long.</p>
<p>My own head is full of all manner of things, and my heart too: I know not how they will <hi rend="italic">come out</hi> yet;&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">out</hi> they must be, by and by, I suppose, if life be granted me. There is no other trade for me: there was never more <hi rend="italic">need</hi> of such a trade, I think!&#x2014; I endeavour to avoid, as much as can be suitable, all <hi rend="italic">dinners</hi> &#x26;c, which are very rife at this season, but do not answer for me at all. In general I find it best to be <hi rend="italic">silent</hi>, to be solitary, were it never so sad. I have Books &#x26;c,&#x2014;and tolerably good tobacco! I find also that I have an abundantly recognised position among my fellow creatures here,&#x2014;a far higher one indeed than I deserve, or can make use of, as I ought;&#x2014;&#x201C;hold thy peace, and look around thee!&#x201D; Goethe says.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister&#x2019;s Apprenticeship, Works</hi> 24:75&#x2013;76.</note></p>

<salute>Dearest Babbie</salute>
<p>If you really desired to hear from me again, you did well to write&#x2014;for, upon <hi rend="italic">my</hi> honour, I had made up my wicked mind that if <hi rend="italic">I</hi> at <hi rend="italic">my</hi> time of life, with <hi rend="italic">my</hi> miserable health, and <hi rend="italic">my</hi> endless botherations was to be held to letter for letter by you, I would once for all &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">protest</hi> and appeal to Posterity.&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-15/lt-18420820-JWC-TC-01"><sic>15:34</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1842-08-20">20 Aug. 1842</date></corr></ref>.</note> When People treat me <hi rend="italic">better</hi> than I deserve, I am still capable of being roused into a wish to justify their faith, but when they give me my bare due&#x2014;or less&#x2014;I leave them to receive their recompense from the sense of their own accurate justice. My <hi rend="italic">due</hi> is so little in fact that they may keep <hi rend="italic">that</hi> too if they like and I shall hardly feel myself poorer&#x2014;</p>
<p>I have been very busy of late weeks&#x2014;with my hands&#x2014;have made a whole set of curtains and covers, of rather dashing chintz at 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi> a yard&#x2014;for the low room&#x2014;which in consequence looks now much brighter than its mistress and just when I was finishing that long job Carlyle come to me with a modest injunction to new strap the three outside Venetian blinds and &#x201C;give them a coat of paint&#x201C;!! seeming to think no more of it than if it had been to sew a button on his shirt or play him a scotch tune&#x2014; For when money was scarcer with us than it is now I had of my own inspiration performed a similar feat&#x2014;almost at the cost of my <hi rend="italic">sanity</hi>&#x2014;and what one does one is expected to do&#x2014;as in the order of Nature&#x2014; And I <hi rend="small-caps">did</hi> strap the blinds but instead of &#x201C;a coat of paint&#x201C; contented myself with giving them a coat of linseed oil&#x2014;which &#x201C;came to the same ultimately&#x201C;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Untraced.</note> and was much more <pb id="pg-21-204" n="21:204"/>easily managed. I am now taking a few days of do nothingness&#x2014;for the good of my hands&#x2014;which Plattnauer justly observed are &#x201C;all knocked out&#x201C;&#x2014;not like a <hi rend="italic">Lady&#x2019;s</hi> the least in the world&#x2014; Did I tell you ever that Plattnauer was returned to England&#x2014;half a year ago? He spent some time in an Asylum in Germany where the D<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> disagreed on his case so that he had to be discharged and the first use he made of his freedom was to post back to England&#x2014;to my immense consternation at first, but now I am quite reconciled to his being here&#x2014;. He gives no signs of derangement <hi rend="italic">at present;</hi> unless his almost superhuman insight and elevation, can be called <hi rend="italic">derangement</hi>&#x2014; He comes here about once a week&#x2014;or seldomer and it does me good to talk with him&#x2014; He goes also a good deal to John Carlyle who has fallen into profound admiration of his character and &#x201C;transcendent eloquence&#x201C; and will not admit the possibility of his being still mad&#x2014;hardly will he admit that he has ever <hi rend="italic">been</hi> mad&#x2014;&#x201C;that is to say any madder than the generality of people are&#x201C;&#x2014; Even Carlyle is greatly struck with his &#x201C;earnestness&#x201C; and &#x201C;keen intellect&#x201C;&#x2014; But they may all say what they like, the <hi rend="italic">madness</hi> is lying in him all the same as ever, only deep down&#x2014;ready to burst up any day&#x2014; <hi rend="italic">That</hi> I know&#x2014;but I also do not mind it&#x2014;have got to regard his fits of insanity much as other peoples fits of <hi rend="italic">biliousness</hi>&#x2014;or <hi rend="italic">influenza</hi> And one cannot but feel well disposed towards a man who absent or present, mad or sane, locked up or at large, never alters in his feelings towards one&#x2019;self&#x2014;</p>

<salute>Dear Jean,</salute>
<p>Having a few minutes to myself, during a day otherwise altogether devoted to <hi rend="italic">idleness</hi>, I think I may as well write you a word or two: it will probably be the only <hi rend="italic">good action</hi> appointed me till tomorrow or later! This is the Country house of the Barings, kind people with whom we were in the winter: the Lady has been to Paris, seeing her Mother who was unwell there; she decided, after her return, to have a quiet week in the Country here; and so got Jane out with her last Monday, I being appointed to follow when I liked and bring her home. I came accordingly on Wednesday afternoon, and tomorrow we are to return: a wholly idle time for all of us,&#x2014;the like of which might make one regret! Mr Baring the Husband goes and comes to Parliament,&#x2014;went yesterday, for instance, and is expected to dinner today;&#x2014;I myself smoke a good deal of tobacco, and go stalking about among the green fields and lanes, which with their fresh breezes do my heart good; the two Dames, in the meanwhile, <foreign><hi rend="italic">daunering</hi></foreign> [strolling] out and in among the flowerbeds mainly, <hi rend="italic">driving</hi> out for what they call exercise once a day, and otherwise <hi rend="italic">consuming</hi> the time: wholly an indolent affair, <pb id="pg-21-206" n="21:206"/>which I shall have had <hi rend="italic">enough</hi> of tomorrow,&#x2014; I think when one is not working, one ought not to be happy; one ought to be very unhappy, <hi rend="italic">seeking</hi> out work.</p>
<p>There was nothing new at London since your last Letter came: a big bustle, getting ever noisier; in which we at Chelsea take less and less concern. I have even given up <hi rend="italic">corresponding</hi>, in a great measure; all manner of applications not essential I strive to wave off,&#x2014;and find <hi rend="italic">silence</hi> the wholesomest in such an element of things: something good may come of silence; but of talking in that dialect there can little or none come!&#x2014; I wish sometimes I were <hi rend="italic">at</hi> another Book, had a Book fairly <hi rend="italic">shaped</hi> again: but I think we are at a considerable distance from that yet.&#x2014; They are going to reprint my poor <hi rend="italic">F. Revolution</hi> this year; the <hi rend="italic">Miscellanies</hi> are already reprinted (tho&#x2019; not yet come out, owing to a trick of the Bookseller&#x2019;s):<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Chapman &#x26; Hall was to publish the third British edn. of <hi rend="italic">The French Revolution</hi> in <date when="1848-00-00">1848</date> and the third British edn. of the <hi rend="italic">Miscellanies</hi> later in <date when="1847-00-00">1847</date>.</note> these poor Books of mine, in spite of all impediments, have become a kind of <hi rend="italic">landed property</hi> to me, and yield a certain <hi rend="italic">rent</hi> more or less considerable, every year. Which is a good result of its kind. You can also tell James I have got an American <hi rend="italic">review</hi> of me, which seems worth sending to him: if I manage right, he will get it about the <date when="1847-06-00">beginning of June</date>.&#x2014; The Newspaper which he weekly gets is not a good one: but I can find none better, no other so good; wherefore we must be content.</p>
<p>Jack came down to me the day I went off to this place; I had been dining with him (to meet a curious Book-virtuoso of the British Museum, a strange <hi rend="italic">Isaac-Fletcher</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Nail-maker at Ecclefechan; &#x201C;book virtuoso&#x201C; unidentified.</note> looking body, altogether employed about Books) the second day before that. Jack is very well, and going on in his usual way: he was to write to my Mother, at least he partly promised, but I know not quite whether he will perform; which is one of my reasons for the present <foreign><hi rend="italic">blash</hi></foreign> [torrent] of writing. We want again to know about my Mother (no end to our wants!)&#x2014;at any rate she should not be left in any anxiety about us here, which we can relieve her from. Your Letter, as all your Letters are, was very welcome; right thankful we are to have such a veracious image of the ly of things as you with your rough pen can dash us off!&#x2014; I suppose our Mother will be getting impatient now to see Scotsbrig again: but tell her she need not be in any hurry till the sun <hi rend="italic">fairly</hi> burst out. By M&#x2019;Diarmid&#x2019;s account<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In the <hi rend="italic">Dumfries Courier</hi>.</note> you have had wild storms for three days lately,&#x2014;they were windy days at Chelsea too, but we did not know them as <hi rend="italic">storms</hi>. O my dear Mother, take care of yourself, for all our sakes!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Dear Sister, you see my paper is just ending; and indeed I feel that I might cover immensities of paper, in the vague hurried mood I am <pb id="pg-21-207" n="21:207"/>in, without telling you almost anything. Besides, here is a flunkey with brushed clothes, hot water, and hint that it is time to &#x201C;dress for dinner&#x201C;:&#x2014; Sorrow on it! <closer><salute>Ever your affectionate</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute><hi rend="small-caps">My Dear Sir</hi>,&#x2014;</salute>I am much pleased to hear of your return to England safe, and if not recovered, yet improved in health, and at all events fitter to enjoy again the blessings which your country still holds out to you. My brother is in Chelsea again (15 Cadogan Terrace), within a short mile of us, for some two months past. I gave him your letter last night,&#x2014;not having myself received it until the day before, owing to a short absence from home.</p>
<p>The melancholy message which reached me last winter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >His mother, Julia, had died in Italy; see <ref target="volume-21/lt-18461207-TC-JOHA-01">TC to JH, <date when="1846-12-07">7 Dec. 1846</date></ref>.</note> has not even yet produced its whole effect upon me! New days and new events turn up ever new remembrances, sad and sacred. I had not, and cannot again expect to have, any such friend. Her life was a noble struggle; and it has ended,&#x2014;has left us still to struggle yet a little farther. Inexorable time sweeps on, all-producing, all-devouring; and they that are departed return not to us any more. It is a law as old as the world; and yet it is ever <hi rend="italic">new</hi>,&#x2014;comes upon us with strange originality, as if it had never been before. We are &#x201C;sons of time,&#x201C;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A phrase from Goethe often repeated by TC; see Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi> 121.</note> fearfully and wonderfully made,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ps. 139:14</note> in very truth; but, as I often say, the Living and the Dead are equally with God; and properly there is nothing more to be said. Surely the remembrance of your noble mother will never leave me while I live in this world.</p>
<p>Bath or Clifton promises to be the eligible residence for you; accompanied, let us hope, with occasional visits to London, when friends here, too, may now and then get a sight of you. If I ever come into the west again, which is possible in time, certainly I will not forget what possession I have there.</p>
<p>When you see Mr. Hare, your brother-in-law, could you ask him if he knows whence that copy of the Cromwell letter which he sent me <hi rend="italic">came</hi> to him? The <hi rend="italic">original</hi> itself has just now turned up, &#x201C;saved from the fire by an old land-steward of the Haselrigs, long since,&#x201C;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For the copy of the letter of Sir Arthur Haselrig (d. <date when="1661-00-00">1661</date>), parliamentary gen. and statesman, sent by Hare, see <ref target="volume-18/lt-18440523-TC-JOHA-01"><sic>18:49&#x2013;50</sic><corr>TC to JOHA, <date when="1844-05-23">23 May 1844</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014;a very curious salvage of<pb id="pg-21-208" n="21:208"/>one of the most remarkable letters in existence; if indeed the steward is the one exclusive saviour of it,&#x2014;which is the point to be ascertained.

It began &#x201C;My dear&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;, what on earth shall I call you? &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">Robert</hi>&#x2019; to one I never saw seems odd; yet what else can I call a man I knew before he was born? So you passed through London on your way to Italy and did not come to see me [see <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410300-JWC-MSC-01"><sic>13:67</sic><corr>JWC to MSC, <date when="1841-03-25">25 March 1841</date></corr>]</ref>! It was wrong of you. I am exactly the sort of woman a young man ought to know. I would have done you much good.&#x2019; Then followed a description of herself. In concluding she said: &#x2018;My husband carried me last summer [<date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>] to a vile place [Newby] on the Solway, where I could think of nothing by day for the eternal moan-moaning of the sea, and nothing by night for industrious fleas&#x2019;&#x201C; (311).</note></p>
<p>When your letter came I was in the country, for a week; and my maid, after her fashion of doing precisely what she is told to do&#x2014;neither more nor less&#x2014;kept all my letters during that time lying on the table <hi rend="italic">here</hi>, I, in the unbounded confidence of my nature, having given her no <hi rend="italic">express injunction</hi> to forward them. Since my return <hi rend="italic">two days</hi> ago, the head of me has been &#x201C;too bad <hi rend="italic">for anything</hi>&#x201C; (as the Lancashire phrase is), aching in fact as if it were about giving birth to a young &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Sin</hi>&#x201C; or young &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Wisdom</hi>,&#x201C;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >As in <hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi> 2:747ff. and the birth of Minerva, goddess of wisdom.</note> all thro&#x2019; having come part of the way by steamboat in a straw bonnet that cost <hi rend="italic">two shillings</hi>. I give you these particulars, that you may see I have lost no time that could be helped. To-day I am rather better, and write to you the first thing I do. I am glad that you are coming to London, especially since you have got over the crisis of &#x201C;detestability.&#x201C; It would have gone against my feelings to have detested you, and I could not have helped it had I seen you in your &#x201C;first pangs of finding&#x201C;&#x2014;that is to say <hi rend="italic">fearing</hi> &#x201C;you were to be nobody and nothing.&#x201C; One only begins to be really <hi rend="italic">something</hi> after those <pb id="pg-21-209" n="21:209"/>pangs have been happily transacted; it is a sort of moral <hi rend="italic">cutting of one&#x2019;s teeth.</hi></p>
<p>My No. is 5, and my street spells itself <hi rend="italic">Cheyne</hi> Row; and there is even, contrary to London etiquette, a brass plate with the name upon the door. A Chelsea omnibus will bring you within a gunshot for <hi rend="italic">sixpence</hi>, or you may come by steamboat at the easy rate of <hi rend="italic">twopence!</hi> If with all these helps you fail to arrive at me with perfect easy you must be the stupidest of mortals. When you come, let it be early; after one, everybody here goes out to call for everybody, everybody wishing to find everybody &#x201C;not at home.&#x201C; How you will <hi rend="italic">like</hi> me when you see me heaven knows. <hi rend="italic">Realised ideals</hi> are always dreadfully precarious. Nor do I remember the least in the world what sort of a sketch of myself I gave you in <date when="1841-00-00">&#x2019;41</date>. Most likely it was wide of the mark; would depend more on <hi rend="italic">how I had slept</hi> the previous night than on &#x201C;the fact of things.&#x201C; My views of myself are a sort of &#x201C;dissolving views,&#x201C; never the same for many minutes together. To-day, for example, I find myself horrid&#x2014;in a second epoch of detestability. Our next-door neighbour having given a ball last night, the noise of which thro&#x2019; the thin partition kept me awake till six in the morning; and so to-day I am in a state of &#x201C;protest and appeal to Posterity&#x201C; against everybody and everything, myself included. Will you tell your Father that one day not long ago, in a roomful of people, Frank Charteris<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charteris owned Amisfield, Haddington, and was deputy lieut. of Haddingtonshire, <date when="1846-00-00">1846</date>, and its M.P. from <date when="1847-07-00">July</date> to <date when="1883-00-00">1883</date>, when he became 10th earl of Wemyss.</note> happening to name your Father, <hi rend="italic">apropos</hi> of something about farming, I shouted out in the joyfullest tone, &#x201C;Oh, dear me!&#x201D; which caused quite a sensation?</p>

I fear the subject is not likely to be very popular at present.</p>
<p>Pray thank Mr. Hare for the pains he takes. I will not trouble him to bring the Cromwell <hi rend="italic">autograph</hi>, but hope to see it some time at Clifton. The only point of inquiry for me (and that is by no means very weighty) is concerning the <hi rend="italic">copy</hi> of the letter to <hi rend="italic">Haselrig</hi>, written just <hi rend="italic">before</hi> the battle of Dunbar (letter 126 of 2nd edition, letter 91 of 1st), as to where this copy <hi rend="italic">came from</hi>,&#x2014;whether in fact it proceeds from the Haselrig establishment at Nosely Hall, or from that of Mr. Ormston, an old steward of theirs (whose grandson now possesses the original), by whom <hi rend="italic">it</hi> and three others were &#x201C;snatched from the fire,&#x201C; once upon a time.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In the third edn. of <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> TC notes: &#x201C;Autograph Original found now (<date when="1847-05-00">May 1847</date>) in the possession of R. Ormston, Esq., Newcastle-on-Tyne. See postea, p. 219, and Appendix, No. 19&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 7:200n). On <date when="1849-06-04">4 June 1849</date> Robert Ormston wrote TC: &#x201C;About 2 years since I sent you a Pamphlet of 4 Letters of Cromwell&#x201C; and explained that he had since sent them to Sir Arthur Grey Haselrig of Durham. He enclosed a copy of the second edn. of the pamphlet because of a slight error in the first. It was <hi rend="italic">Four Letters from Oliver Cromwell to Sir Arthur Hezelridge Governor of Newscastle upon Tyne, from the Originals in the possession of Robert Ormston</hi> (Newcastle, <date when="1847-00-00">1847</date>) (Yale MSS).</note> The Haselrigs, some sixty or seventy years ago, it appears, had brought this letter, among many others, to the fire to be destroyed, and old Ormston saved it; whereupon the question has arisen with me (a small, but not quite uninteresting question) whether this letter, certainly one of the remarkablest we have that relate to English history, would have been abolished and quite destroyed out of memory had not old Ormston intervened. If Mr. Hare&#x2019;s copy be <hi rend="italic">anterior</hi> to that of Ormston&#x2019;s interference, of course it at once decides against him; if posterior, it will not decide anything; but if its date and history were known, it might help us to decide. This is the small question which, when Mr. Hare has opportunity, I will recommend to him. <closer><salute>In great haste,</salute></closer></p>

In <date when="1847-07-00">July</date> (4:224&#x2013;31) it reported that Hugh Miller (<date when="1802-00-00">1802</date>&#x2013;<date when="1856-00-00">56</date>; <ref target="volume-21/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/18723"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), geologist and ed. of the <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>, had made comparisons with genuine examples of Burns&#x2019;s handwriting that showed he was not involved but that the samples were perhaps the work of the Rev. John Logan (<date when="1748-00-00">1748</date>&#x2013;<date when="1788-00-00">88</date>), minister of S Leith, poet and major contrib. to the <date when="1781-00-00">1781</date> edn. The <hi rend="italic">Daily News</hi>, <date when="1847-05-12">12 May</date>, noted: &#x201C;A curious literary discovery connected with Burns has just been announced. It is stated that there is manuscript evidence to show that much of the good poetry in the Scotch hymns and paraphrases owes its existence to the emendations of the Ayrshire bard. Hitherto the corrections on those compositions have been ascribed to Logan. &#x2026; It is a singular circumstance (if true) that the section of his countrymen who have the least veneration for the memory of the Ayrshire peasant should for half a century have been giving expression to their devotional fervour in his words.&#x201C;</note>&#x2014;and it much resembles that of any practical substantial Scotchman who learned to write about the year <date when="1770-00-00">1770</date>; that of my own Father, for example, and of my Wife&#x2019;s Grandfather. Totally unable to carry (without <hi rend="italic">much</hi> additional support) any such speculation as this!&#x2014; I think they had better try their old Paraphrase Manuscript (if indeed it is worth trying, or minding) with the handwriting of Logan, Blair,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably Hugh Blair (<date when="1718-00-00">1718</date>&#x2013;<date when="1800-00-00">1800</date>), clergyman and prof. of rhetoric and belles lettres, Univ. of Edinburgh, <date when="1762-00-00">1762</date>&#x2013;<date when="1784-00-00">84</date>.</note> or with almost any other rev<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Native, than with that of a poor Ayrshire peasant lad, scarcely turned of 20 at that date,&#x2014;and much more like cutting a <foreign><hi rend="italic">dark</hi></foreign> [day&#x2019;s work] <hi rend="italic">of peats</hi> than trying his hand at Assembly Psalmodies!</p>
<p>I go out daily to walk, a little before 3 o&#x2019;clock,&#x2014;often with a rather vague aim: if I came athwart you anywhere, it would certainly tend to lighten my steps; and improve the summer breezes for me.</p>

Specific direction is and remains impossible, in such a case.

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I am delighted that you have formally undertaken this business of mine with the Wiley-and-Putnam people.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-21/lt-18470318-TC-EPC-01">TC to EPC, <date when="1847-03-18">18 March</date></ref>.</note> I shall henceforth fling it altogether off <hi rend="italic">my</hi> shoulders, and leave it very thankfully upon another man&#x2019;s,&#x2014;as if it were henceforth no business of mine, but one of your&#x2019;s! Pray consider that as literally the case:&#x2014;and do what <hi rend="italic">you</hi> consider to be wisest for my behoof, and for that of Fair-play as represented by me in this matter; and do not trouble yourself with making me <hi rend="italic">reports</hi> &#x26;c, except when there is something definite to communicate, or in still rarer cases (likely to be very rare, I think!) when I may seem likely to have some specific light, <hi rend="italic">preferable</hi> to what you yourself possess, on some particular matter.</p>
<p>No &#x201C;question&#x201C; from Mr Wiley to me about &#x201C;Cromwell&#x201C; or anything else, has ever been heard of here: but on mentioning the thing to Mr Putnam (in a Note about some Liverpool Book-parcel of mine), he sends me the enclosed response, which at least <hi rend="italic">sounds</hi> altogether satisfactory.&#x2014; I, with great pleasure, leave them and their affair altogether to you; who are much fitter to deal with them, and will, I have no doubt at all, do whatsoever is wise and just in regard to the matter;&#x2014;and that is precisely my sole wish in regard to it.</p>
<p>Will you be so good as put that sealed Note into the Post-office: I think your cover will carry it free as far as Boston.&#x2014;<closer><salute>Always truly Yours</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>Dear Emerson,&#x2014;</salute>I have got a Letter from Clark, undertaking to act as I desired, nay indicating that he has already begun in some measure to act. <pb id="pg-21-213" n="21:213"/>A short response of heartfelt satisfaction goes for him by this Packet; and so, let us hope, for unlimited periods, this matter is set floating, on its own voyage, under its own captain, and will trouble us no more.</p>
<p>My time is nearly up today; but I write a word to acknowledge your last Letter (<date when="1847-04-30">30 April</date>), and various other things. For example, you must tell Mr Thoreau (is that the exact name? for I have lent away the printed pages) that his Philadelphia Magazine with the <hi rend="italic">Lecture</hi>, in two pieces, was faithfully delivered here, about a fortnight ago;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henry David Thoreau (<date when="1817-00-00">1817</date>&#x2013;<date when="1862-00-00">62</date>), &#x201C;Thomas Carlyle and His Works,&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">Graham&#x2019;s American Monthly Magazine</hi> 30 (<date when="1847-03-00">March</date> and <date when="1847-04-00">April 1847</date>): 145&#x2013;52, 238&#x2013;45; rptd. Seigel, <hi rend="italic">Thomas Carlyle: The Critical Heritage</hi> 277&#x2013;301. An enthusiastic appreciation that began by claiming that, since Coleridge, TC &#x201C;alone has kept the promise of England,&#x201C; it was delivered as a lecture at the Concord, Mass., Lyceum, <date when="1846-02-04">4 Feb. 1846</date>.</note> and carefully read, as beseemed, with due entertainment and recognition. A vigorous Mr Thoreau,&#x2014;who has formed himself a good deal upon one Emerson, but does not want abundant fire and stamina of his own;&#x2014;recognises us, and various other things, in a most admiring greathearted manner; for which, as for <hi rend="italic">part</hi> of the confused voice from the jury-box (not yet summed into a verdict, nor likely to be summed till Doomsday, nor needful to sum), the poor prisoner at the bar may justly express himself thankful!&#x2014; In plain prose, I like Mr Thoreau very well; and hope yet to hear good and better news of him&#x2014;only let him not &#x201C;turn to foolishness&#x201C;;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Ps. 85:8 and 2 Sam. 15:31.</note> which seems to me to be terribly easy, at present, both in New England and Old! May the Lord deliver us all from <hi rend="italic">Cant;</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thoreau had written that &#x201C;let the subject be what it may,&#x201C; TC showed an &#x201C;entire absence of cant and dogma&#x201C; (Seigel 292).</note> may the Lord, whatever else he do or forbear, teach us to look Facts honestly in the face, and to beware (with a kind of shudder) of smearing <hi rend="italic">them</hi> over with our despicable and damnable palaver, into irrecogniseability, and so <hi rend="italic">falsifying</hi> the Lord&#x2019;s own Gospels to his unhappy blockheads of children, all staggering down to Gehenna<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A valley nr. Jerusalem regarded as a place of abomination.</note> and the everlasting Swine&#x2019;s-trough for <hi rend="italic">want</hi> of Gospels&#x2014;O Heaven, it is the most accursed sin of man; and done everywhere, at present, on the streets and high places, at noon-day! Very seriously I say, and pray as my chief orison, May the Lord deliver us from it.&#x2014;&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>About a week ago there came your neighbour Hoar;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ebenezer Rockwood Hoar (<date when="1816-00-00">1816</date>&#x2013;<date when="1895-00-00">95</date>), jurist, U.S. attorney gen., <date when="1869-00-00">1869</date>&#x2013;<date when="1870-00-00">70</date>, member of Congress, <date when="1873-00-00">1873</date>&#x2013;<date when="1875-00-00">75</date>. In a letter of introduction Emerson wrote to TC, <date when="1847-04-01">1 April</date>: &#x201C;A near neighbor &#x26; friend of mine, E. Rockwood Hoar, Esq. A lawyer much distinguished in his profession, and recently a member of the Senate of Massachusetts, is commanded by his physician to leave off working, &#x26; to travel. He goes to England &#x26; to Europe, for a few months. I cannot deny him the pleasure of seeing you. And, as Mr. Hoar is particularly desirous of seeing Cambridge or Oxford, or both, I wish you would give him the best advice you can in that direction.&#x201C;</note> a solid, sensible, <pb id="pg-21-214" n="21:214"/>effectual-looking man, of whom I hope to see much more. So soon as possible I got him under way for Oxford, where I suppose he was, last week;&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">both</hi> universities was too much for the limits of his time; so he preferred Oxford;&#x2014;and now, this very day, I think, he was to set out for the Continent; not to return till the <date when="1847-07-00">beginning of July</date>, when he promises to call here again. There was something really pleasant to me in this Mr Hoar: and I had innumerable things to ask him about Concord, concerning which topic we had hardly got a word said when our first interview had to end. I sincerely hope he will not fail to keep his time in returning.</p>
<p>You do very well, my Friend, to plant orchards;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In his letter of <date when="1847-04-30">30 April</date> Emerson had told TC &#x201C;that in these days I lay out a patch of orchard near my house, very much to the improvement as all the household affirms, of our homestead. Though I have little skill in these things, and must borrow that of my neighbors, yet the works of the garden &#x26; orchard at this season are fascinating, &#x26; will eat up days &#x26; weeks, and a brave scholar should shun it like gambling, &#x26; take refuge in cities &#x26; hotels from these pernicious enchantments. For the present, I stay in the new orchard.&#x201C;</note> and fair fruit shall they grow (if it please Heaven) for your grandchildren to pluck;&#x2014;a beautiful occupation for the son of man, in all patriarchal and paternal times (which latter are patriarchal too)! But you are to understand withal that your coming hither to Lecture is taken as a settled point by all your friends here; and for my share I do not reckon upon the smallest doubt about the <hi rend="italic">essential</hi> fact of it, simply on some calculation and adjustment about the circumstantials. Of Ireland, who I surmise is busy in the problem even now, you will hear by and by, probably in more definite terms:<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson wrote to TC, <date when="1847-04-30">30 April</date>: &#x201C;I hear nothing again from Mr Ireland. So I will let the English Voyage hang as an afternoon rainbow in the East, and mind my apples &#x26; pears for the present.&#x201C;</note> I did not see him again after my first notice of him to you; but there is no doubt concerning his determinations (for all manner of reasons) to get you to Lancashire, to England;&#x2014;and in fact it is an adventure which I think you ought to contemplate as <hi rend="italic">fixed</hi>,&#x2014;say for this year and the beginning of next? Ireland will help you to fix the dates; and there is nothing else, I think, which should need fixing.&#x2014; Unquestionably you would get an immense quantity of food for ideas, tho&#x2019; perhaps not at all in the way you anticipate, in looking about among us: nay if you even thought us <hi rend="italic">stupid</hi>, there is something in the godlike indifference with which London will accept and sanction even that verdict,&#x2014;something highly instructive at least! And in short, for the truth must be told, London is properly <hi rend="italic">your</hi> Mother City too,&#x2014;verily you have about as much to do with it, in spite of Polk and Q. Victory,<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James K. Polk (<date when="1795-00-00">1795</date>&#x2013;<date when="1849-00-00">1849</date>), pres. of the U.S. (<date when="1845-00-00">1845</date>&#x2013;<date when="1849-00-00">49</date>), and Queen Victoria.</note> as I had! And you ought to come and look at it, beyond doubt;&#x2014;and say to this Land, &#x201C;Old Mother, how are you getting on at all?&#x201C; <pb id="pg-21-215" n="21:215"/>To which the Mother will answer &#x201C;Thankee, young son, and you?&#x201C;&#x2014;in a way useful to both parties! That is truth.</p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Today I have half an hour at my disposal; and will employ it in writing a word to you,&#x2014;to you who read always all words from me with welcome. Of news properly I have none; for I think Jack wrote the other day, and I myself have often been writing. But your <hi rend="small-caps">Portrait</hi> here cannot speak to me;&#x2014;no; and I may as well speak to <hi rend="italic">it</hi> by scribbling a line or two for the original!</p>
<p>We have got bright beautiful weather now, with abundance of cool southwest winds, which give us a most clear and pure atmosphere: so long as the wind blows from that quarter, or indeed so long as there is wind anywhere except from the East, Chelsea is as fresh as the Country. Our gardens are all got leafy, and there are plenty of blossoms and boughs to be seen everywhere interspersed among the red bricks. London generally is <pb id="pg-21-216" n="21:216"/>an awful whirlpool during this month; but we try to have but little to do with it; nothing for the most part, but a glimpse at it once a day; and a thankful <hi rend="italic">return</hi> out of the noise and discord of it, back to the River side here, and to the sight of country fields, and the company chiefly of Books and one&#x2019;s own thoughts again.&#x2014; One of the best effects of this good weather, or rather by far the best of all, is the prospect it holds out of some diminution in the <hi rend="italic">dearth</hi>, which is pressing hard on all the working people everywhere, and frightening them moreover with outlooks into still worse. The quartern loaf (4 pounds of white bread) is now 1 / 1&#xBD; (13 pence halfpenny), not far from <hi rend="italic">three</hi> times what it has been known not long since. But I hear yesterday, the price of wheat does not now <hi rend="italic">rise further</hi>, nay it rather <hi rend="italic">falls</hi>; and skilful people seem to anticipate that perhaps there is no real <hi rend="italic">cause</hi> of famine anywhere, except the great derangement in all manner of money-matters (produced by <hi rend="italic">railway</hi> speculations &#x26;c);&#x2014;and that if the good weather hold, bread will be cheaper again.&#x2014; John told me he had sent Jenny her money this week,&#x2014;indeed I read her Letter yesternight;&#x2014;I hope she knows always that she need not fear want, while any of us has wherewith to help. Her industrious thrifty spirit, her clever hands and courageous little heart render her always <hi rend="italic">easy</hi> to help,&#x2014;poor little Jenny! And she is going with you, it seems, to Scotsbrig for a while; which is an arrangement we like. The green fields and quiet of Scotsbrig will be welcome again after so long a confinement in paved streets.</p>
<p>We are well here, as you know; Jane takes always to the warm weather, and brightens up as the season rises towards perfection. Last night she had a visit of Miss Jewsbury (from Manchester), who is coming next Tuesday for a couple of weeks; this will involve more locomotion than usual, and be a kind of exhilaration to her.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Visiting Cheyne Row, <date when="1847-05-20">20 May</date>, Caroline Fox (<date when="1819-00-00">1819</date>&#x2013;<date when="1871-00-00">71</date>; <ref target="volume-21/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/10019"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>) recorded that JWC talked &#x201C;of her brilliant little friend Zoe (Miss Jewsbury), who declares herself born without any sense of decency: the publishers beg she will be decent, and she has not the slightest objection to be so, but she does not know what it is; she implores Mrs. Carlyle to take any quantity of spotted muslin and clothe her figures for her, for she does not know which are naked. She is a very witty little thing, full of emotions, which overflow on all occasions; her sister &#x2026; tried to bring them into lady-like order, and checked her ardent demonstrations of affection in society and elsewhere. The sister died, so did the parents, and this wild creature was thrown on the world, which hurled her back upon herself. She read insatiably and at random in an old library, alchemy, physiology, and what not, and undraped &#x2018;Zoe&#x2019; is the result&#x201C; (Fox 220). The sister was Maria Jewsbury (<date when="1800-00-00">1800</date>&#x2013;<date when="1833-00-00">1833</date>; <ref target="volume-21/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/14816"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>); see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18401021-TC-GEJ-01"><sic>12:297</sic><corr>TC to GEJ, <date when="1840-10-21">21 Oct. 1840</date></corr></ref>.</note> On Wednesday afternoon next we have all to go, John and Geraldine (Jewsbury) and we to see a kind of workmen&#x2019;s Festival, which a certain Mr Adams,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Bridges Adams (<date when="1797-00-00">1797</date>&#x2013;<date when="1872-00-00">1872</date>; <ref target="volume-21/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/140"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), railway coach builder and inventor of railway equipment; m., <date when="1834-00-00">1834</date>, Sarah Flower (<date when="1805-00-00">1805</date>&#x2013;<date when="1848-00-00">48</date>; <ref target="volume-21/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/129"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>); see <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410307-TC-HTA-01"><sic>13:50</sic><corr>TC to HTA, <date when="1841-03-07">7 March 1841</date></corr></ref>.

We are always very happy with him for a little; but could not stand it <hi rend="italic">long</hi>, I think,&#x2014;not <hi rend="italic">long</hi>, without coming upon innumerable points of discrepancy!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Francis Jeffrey wrote to TC from Shanklin, Isle of Wight, <date when="1847-04-26">26 April</date>, that he was soon to pass through London on his way to Edinburgh and hoped to see the Carlyles. In the meantime, he said, &#x201C;Let me know how you and my ever dear Jeanie have been&#x2014;what you have been doing and meditating&#x2014;whether you are in any degree weaned from your strange idolatry of old Cromwell.&#x201C; Further, Jeffrey wondered, in what direction &#x201C;your constitutional melancholy and enthusiasm is now leading you?&#x201C;</note>&#x2014; A much more interesting visitor than Jeffrey was old Dr Chalmers, who came down to us also last week; whom I had not seen before for, I think, five-and-twenty years. It was a kind of pathetic meeting. The good old man is grown white-headed; but is otherwise wonderfully little altered: grave, deliberate, very gentle in his deportment, but with plenty too of soft energy, full of interest still for all serious things, full of real kindliness, and sensible even to honest mirth in a fair measure: he sat with us an hour and a half; went away with our blessings and affections;&#x2014;it is long since I have spoken to so <hi rend="italic">good</hi> and really pious-hearted and beautiful an old man!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-21/lt-18470220-TC-TCH-01">TC to <sic>TC</sic><corr>TCH</corr>, <date when="1847-02-20">20 Feb.</date></ref></note>&#x2014;</p>
<p>Alas, dear Mother, my <foreign><hi rend="italic">clatter</hi></foreign> must terminate here. I could fill many such sheets with the like; but I must not start on another.&#x2014; We heard from Scotsbrig not long since; to Jean I wrote lately, ought perhaps to write again? You must very specially remember us to Mary when at Gill; say that we many times think of her, tho&#x2019; writing less than usual. <closer><salute>Take care of yourself on this journey, my dear good mother.&#x2014; My blessings to you and all.</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dearest Helen</salute>
<p>Do write me a few lines&#x2014;I want so much to hear about Sophy<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Martin, whose mother (see <ref target="volume-16/lt-18430126-JWC-JW-01"><sic>16:36</sic><corr>JWC to JW, <date when="1843-01-26">26 Jan. 1843</date></corr></ref>) had recently died. Her brother is unidentified.</note>&#x2014; Does her Brother still intend going abroad?&#x2014;will Sophy in that case keep on her house?&#x2014; Pray tell me all you know&#x2014;give her my kindest remembrance&#x2014; Poor little thing I am very sorry for her&#x2014;but what comfort <hi rend="italic">can</hi> be got in such circumstances she will get from you and the rest.</p>
<p>The sudden heat has taken as strong effect on me as the cold did&#x2014;in a different way <hi rend="italic">then</hi> it was my <hi rend="italic">chest</hi> which suffered now it is my <hi rend="italic">liver</hi> The result of discomfort to myself is much the same&#x2014; I go about however&#x2014;but as poor Darley said &#x201C;like a Serpent trying to stand on its tail.&#x201C;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Caroline Fox recorded in her diary, <date when="1847-05-20">20 May</date>, that JWC &#x201C;has been very ill, and the doctors gave her opium and tartar for her cough, which induced, not beautiful dreams and visions, but a miserable feeling of turning to marble herself and lying on marble, her hair, her arms, and her whole person petrifying and adhering to the marble slab on which she lay. One night it was a tombstone,&#x2014;one in Scotland which she well knew. She lay along it with a graver in her hand, carving her own epitaph under another, which she read and knew by heart. It was her mother&#x2019;s. She felt utterly distinct from this prostrate figure, and thought of her with pity and love, looked at different passages of her life, and moralised as on a familiar friend. It was more like madness than anything she has ever experienced. &#x2018;After all,&#x2019; she said, &#x2018;I often wonder what right I have to live at all.&#x2019; She talked sadly of the world&#x2019;s hollowness, and every year deepening her sense of this: half-a-dozen real friends is far too magnificent an allowance for any one to calculate on: she would suggest half-a-one; those you really care about, die. &#x2026; She talked of &#x2026; the mistake of over-educating people. She believes that her health has been injured for life by beginning Latin with a little tutor at five or six years old, then going to the Rector&#x2019;s school to continue it, then having a tutor at home, and being very ambitious she learnt eagerly. Irving, being her tutor, and of equally excitable intellect, was delighted to push her through every study; then he introduced her to Carlyle, and for years they had a literary intimacy, and she would be writing constantly and consulting him about everything, &#x2018;and so it would probably have always gone on, for we were both of us made for independence, and I believe should have wanted to live together, but this intimacy was not considered discreet, so we married quietly and departed.&#x2019; She laughs at him as a nurse; he peeps in and looks frightened, and asks, &#x2018;How are ye now, Jeannie?&#x2019; and vanishes, as if well out of a scrape&#x201C; (Fox 219&#x2013;20).</note> And for the <pb id="pg-21-219" n="21:219"/>rest the household goes on well enough&#x2014; Anne is today and will be tomorrow the same that she was yesterday&#x2014;good so far as she goes&#x2014;but not &#x201C;going the whole hog&#x201C; with the <hi rend="italic">emphasis</hi> one could wish. However the being a little slow a little <hi rend="italic">ineffectual</hi> is perhaps the least afflictive fault she could have&#x2014;and <hi rend="italic">some</hi> fault&#x2014;being human&#x2014;she <hi rend="italic">must have</hi>. She is perfectly orderly&#x2014;and <hi rend="italic">respectable</hi>&#x2014;and likes me as much as it is in languid nature to like any mistress&#x2014; I miss the <hi rend="italic">enthusiasm</hi>&#x2014;the <hi rend="italic">birr</hi> that was in Helen&#x2014;the <hi rend="italic">ready-to-fly-at-everythingness</hi>, but on the other hand things go on equably&#x2014;without <hi rend="italic">flare-ups</hi>&#x2014;and having to help her a little with her work is perhaps good for me in the main&#x2014;</p>
<p>I wish <hi rend="italic">you</hi> had only one servant instead of three&#x2014;you would find your problem I am sure much less complicated&#x2014; They spoil one another&#x2014;</p>
<p>Geraldine has been at the Ashursts for ten days and I have seen her only once&#x2014; She has never got quite rid of the black dog that jumped on her back during your visit here&#x2014;however she is coming this evening&#x2014;to stay <hi rend="italic">ten days</hi> she says&#x2014;but she will stay longer than that I wager&#x2014; I hope her visit will not be exploded all to nonsense as yours was<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >During the previous <date when="1846-11-00">Nov.</date> and <date when="1846-12-00">Dec.</date></note>&#x2014;the time she was here before<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In <date when="1843-02-00">Feb.</date>&#x2013;<date when="1843-03-00">March 1843</date>.</note> Helen fell sick, and Geraldine <hi rend="italic">would empty the slops!</hi> which made me very cross with her&#x2014; &#x2014;I <hi rend="italic">must</hi> try and be more amiable this time, however it stand with my <hi rend="italic">liver</hi>, and other things; for her kindness and helpfulness to me in Manchester is never to be forgotten&#x2014;should cover a multitude of caprices and inconsistencies on her part&#x2014; You ask about Plattnauer he continues sane enough for all practical and speculative purposes&#x2014; Comes here about once a week&#x2014;has become an immense favorite with John Carlyle&#x2014;but I wish he had employment&#x2014; He does <hi rend="italic">me</hi> no ill&#x2014;rather good&#x2014; Kisses to my Uncle</p>

<salute>Dear Lord Ashburton,</salute>
<p>By your kindness, or that of Bookseller Murray, I have got sight of your Pamphlet on the Money Crisis; and have read it with all attention.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">The Financial and Commercial Crisis Considered</hi> (<date when="1847-00-00">1847</date>). Lord Ashburton, as well as being highly successful in finance, had been pres. of the board of trade and master of the mint, <date when="1834-00-00">1834</date>; his pamphlet addressed the financial crisis that had developed over the past four months, shown by high interest rates, bankruptcies, and stagnation in trade.</note> &#x201C;One reader,&#x201C; therefore, you actually &#x201C;have the good fortune&#x201C; to have got; one, and even two! And indeed it seems to lie quite within the Laws of Nature that you should get very many; for the topic is one of universal interest, and it is handled here in a style man like, and by one who has a good right to speak on it, if anybody has!&#x2014;</p>
<p>My opinions on a subject so foreign to me are worth next to nothing: but I may be allowed to remark one real merit in this Piece of Writing: It is exceedingly <hi rend="italic">like the Writer;</hi>&#x2014;which, as a Spontaneous unconscious proof of its <hi rend="italic">sincerity</hi>, is a great merit indeed. I must say farther that the diagnosis of the malady (railway speculation, pp. 24, 30 &#x26;c) agrees with all that poor Common-sense could ever teach me on the matter: if you waste your <hi rend="italic">substance</hi>, of course you lose your &#x201C;credit,&#x201C; you have in fact nothing to <hi rend="italic">be</hi> &#x201C;credited,&#x201C; or believed in, for the present! Farther that the notion of &#x201C;currency,&#x201C; so well developed at pp. 20&#x2013;1, has many times been in my own head; and has filled me too with misgivings about the perfect wisdom of Peel&#x2019;s Act: that, for the rest, as you teach us, the essential point is certainly <hi rend="italic">not</hi> a &#x201C;metallic basis,&#x201C; but a <hi rend="italic">real</hi> basis (of meal and malt, and <hi rend="italic">money&#x2019;s-worth</hi> in general):&#x2014;and, on the whole, that this present Teaching, or Currency-Sermon as we may call it, is of the sound sort, and comes to the true conclusions; and has, for me at least, thrown much more light on the matter, than many sermons I have listened to from Doctors in bigger wigs had done!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sir Robert Peel&#x2019;s Bank Charter Act of <date when="1844-00-00">1844</date> provided that bank notes issued by the Bank of England were to be covered by coin or gold bullion except for &#xa3;14,000,000 covered by govt. securities. Some persons argued that the crisis was caused by capital locked up in railway speculation, or by increasing payments for food imported from the U.S., or by the bank&#x2019;s mismanagement. Lord Ashburton maintained that the current &#x201C;famine of money&#x201C; was mainly due to the act&#x2019;s restriction on monetary issue by the bank, arguing that though almost &#xa3;10,000,000 of bullion were in the bank as required by law, there were only &#xa3;2,500,000 available for commerce. He believed that the business of the country was in a safe state and that the crisis came from the curtailed money supply. By the end of <date when="1847-10-00">Oct.</date> (known as a &#x201C;week of horror&#x201C;) the crisis had deepended severely; but the govt. accepted Peel&#x2019;s advice, the act was not suspended though the bank was empowered to issue further notes, the bank rate remained relatively high, and in spite of further bankruptcies the situation righted itself in <date when="1848-00-00">1848</date>.</note> This is my true verdict; and I have not another word to say,&#x2014; <pb id="pg-21-221" n="21:221"/>except perhaps that more sermons from the same hand, on these abstruse departments (much overshadowed by the <hi rend="italic">wig</hi>, at present), would be very welcome to me.</p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>There is not to my knowledge any Translation, German or other, of <hi rend="italic">Sartor:</hi> some years ago, a specimen of a German one, which some German <hi rend="italic">Swedenborgians</hi> were of mind to publish (for some mysterious purposes of <hi rend="italic">theirs</hi>), was shewn me by certain of their Sect in this country:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charles Augustus Tulk (see <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390415-TC-JAC-01"><sic>11:89</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1839-04-15">15 April 1839</date></corr></ref>) had shown TC &#x201C;fragments&#x201C; in <date when="1840-00-00">1840</date>; see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400603-TC-JAC-01"><sic>12:159</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1840-06-03">3 June 1840</date></corr></ref>.</note> but it had no merit, as probably I told them in reply; and no more was ever heard of it in this quarter; so that I suppose they desisted. Of any other Translation into any language no notice ever reached me. Indeed I think the task might be difficult, and the result questionable!</p>
<p>Certainly it is a pleasant fact that, if one is to be translated, Freiligrath should be the man for it.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ferdinand Freiligrath (<date when="1810-00-00">1810</date>&#x2013;<date when="1876-00-00">76</date>), German poet and trans., revolutionary exile living in London. He had already trans. Burns, Southey, Tennyson, et al. into German. He apparently never trans. <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi>.</note> But let <hi rend="italic">him</hi> look well to it:&#x2014;indeed, what is the use of translating such stuff, especially for Germans?&#x2014;</p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>A few minutes after your Book last night (for which, from my Wife, I have to return you many thanks), there arrived, along with the Goethe Autograph this Note from Lord Ellesmere. Containing, as I anticipated, a polite <hi rend="italic">refusal to purchase</hi>.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The book is unidentified. The autograph may be the &#x201C;Goethe manuscript&#x201C; sent by J. P. Eckermann and thought lost in the mail; see <ref target="volume-19/lt-18450531-TC-JPE-01">TC to JPE, <date when="1845-05-31">31 May 1845</date></ref>. Francis Egerton (<date when="1800-00-00">1800</date>&#x2013;<date when="1857-00-00">1857</date>; <ref target="volume-21/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/8585"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), 1st earl of Ellesmere, <date when="1846-00-00">1846</date>, statesman and poet, had trans. <hi rend="italic">Faust.</hi></note> The &#xa3;10 (or the &#xa3;20? I am afraid only 10) which his Lordship offers on another score, I consider to be of a partly <hi rend="italic">eleemosynary</hi> nature, and therefore inadmissable by Eckermann,&#x2014;unless his necessities at any time render it advisable, for which purpose he may, if he find good, keep remembrance of it. I wish you to send him the Note itself, or give it him at your return.</p>
<p>As to what should next be done in this business, I am considerably at a loss. No other of the &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Grossen</hi></foreign> [Great] of England&#x201C; has the smallest chance to purchase; certain other parties might with less hope be applied to here: but I do not think there is the least likelihood of getting &#xa3;100 for the Autograph from any party whatever at this date: &#xa3;50, or even &#xa3;25, I should consider to be a good price as times go. Mr. Forster&#x2019;s notion that by the method of <hi rend="italic">raffle</hi> something like &#xa3;50 might be got for it, seems to me not unplausible: but I have the least shadow of experience in such things; and I should suppose there would be, even in the case of success, some small deduction to be made for the expenses (advertising &#x26;c) attendant on that plan.</p>
<p>I will retain the Autograph for a few days still, and try with it in one or two quarters; and in the meanwhile I think it will very specially be requisite that you write to Eckermann, and get precise instruction from him as to what he now wishes to be done with the Article, whether to have it raffled for or what,&#x2014;and above all things, what is the <hi rend="italic">lowest sum of money</hi> which he would <hi rend="italic">prefer</hi> seeing return with you to seeing the Autograph return.</p>
<p>We are at home, I think, on Sunday Ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi></p>

<p><salute>Dear Jean,&#x2014;</salute>Thanks for your good little Letter, which would deserve a longer reply than I can give it at present,&#x2014;with Jane sitting waiting for me (in the prospect of an evening walk) till I end!&#x2014; Poor old Barney: I wore his stockings, all winter, in the house; and now he has departed, with due &#x201C;Irish wake,&#x201C; and we shall see his old face no more!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note></p>
<p>The American Magazines did not come back in time for the Bookseller; wherefore I now cut out the <hi rend="italic">Review</hi> portion, and send it by post.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably <hi rend="italic">Graham&#x2019;s Magazine</hi> with Thoreau&#x2019;s review; see <ref target="volume-21/lt-18470518-TC-RWE-01">TC to RWE, <date when="1847-05-18">18 May</date></ref>.</note> When you have read it, let my Mother see it; that is nearly all I have to advise on the subject. There was another &#x201C;Article on Cromwell,&#x201C; not without some value, in the <hi rend="italic">Westminster</hi>, which also I meant to cut out, and send;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >[Alexander Bain], &#x201C;Oliver Cromwell&#x2019;s Letters and Speeches,&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">Westminster Review</hi> 46 (<date when="1847-01-00">Jan. 1847</date>):432&#x2013;73. &#x201C;The great practical hero of the seventeenth century &#x2026; has fallen into the hands of the great heroic biographer&#x201C; (432&#x2013;33), the reviewer said, but was surprised at TC&#x2019;s sympathy for puritan religious convictions (471).</note> but today I cannot find it in the house, and think somebody must have borrowed it: if it turn up by and by, I will take another opportunity.&#x2014; Your little sentence about the &#x201C;Nashville Newspaper&#x201C; and what follows is not intelligible to any of us: so we fancy the Nashville Newspaper never arrived here (for I have no recollection of it), or at least that we had <hi rend="italic">missed</hi> the piece you allude to.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> The <hi rend="italic">latter</hi>, I rather think, is the more probable: but never mind it either way.</p>
<p>Jenny and our Mother we suppose to be got or getting under way for Scotsbrig about this time. The change into the country will be grateful, if your weather is like ours. We have sun in abundance; and while the west wind blows all is bright as diamonds: for a day or two we have had <hi rend="italic">east</hi>, which is <hi rend="italic">dimmer</hi> and still very hot; however we must not complain, for every day of it brings the poor man&#x2019;s loaf a little down! All people are gladdening themselves in the prospect of a great harvest; most useful to all.</p>
<p>For about a week now we have had <hi rend="italic">Miss Jewsbury</hi> (from Manchester), who wrote a Novel two years ago, and is a kind of <hi rend="italic">lioness</hi> here: a very gentle, shrewd, affectionate, thin little woman; with whom Jane was guest last autumn once. &#x201C;Geraldine Jewsbury, Authoress of <hi rend="italic">Zoe</hi>&#x201C; (which under favour, is somewhat of a <hi rend="italic">dud</hi>, tho&#x2019; with sense in it too): she creates somewhat of a racket in our quiet home here;&#x2014;and especially calls out the gallant faculties of the Doctor, we can perceive! He has her off to the <pb id="pg-21-224" n="21:224"/>Theatre this evening; he is very assiduous in his escort of her up and down, poor fellow,&#x2014;being somewhat in want of a job at any rate. Jane looks quizzically a little upon him: but whether he intends anything farther I do not in the least guess,&#x2014;not indeed could I judge or advise, if I did. Silence, silence; let the fruit (if any) ripe <hi rend="italic">itself!</hi> Poor fellow, I really believe, unless he marry he will never do anything. We shall see.&#x2014; <closer><salute>Write me another word about my Mother, dear Jean. I can add nothing more. These Papers are properly <hi rend="italic">for James</hi>, I suppose. Ever yours</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Isabella,</salute>
<p>John brought me down your Letter two days ago; for which we are all much obliged to you. Certainly you are very kind; and the very <hi rend="italic">sound</hi> of your hospitable provision for our wants is welcome and worthy to us! Hearty thanks to you, if for the present it must go no farther!</p>
<p>The Doctor, I suppose, has himself declined; at least he signified to me (and perhaps even bade me signify) that he could do nothing in the Ham way just now. Jane too, after a good deal of considering, has to admit to herself that it will not do in this hot weather! The &#x201C;little fat ham of 14 pounds&#x201C; is very tempting: but she says it would almost certainly be spoiled by the heat before we got thro&#x2019; it; so &#x201C;if it could be kept till after autumn&#x201C;&#x2014; I tell her, it cannot be <hi rend="italic">kept</hi>, and the word is now or never;&#x2014;so that she is reluctantly obliged to <hi rend="italic">give it up</hi>. And all we can do is to thank Jamie and you for your kindness, and hope for &#x201C;better luck next time.&#x201C;&#x2014; As to myself I feel that a Barrel of sweet Scotsbrig <hi rend="italic">whey</hi> would be welcomer to me in this weather than most samples of <hi rend="italic">bacon!</hi> I have not felt less notion of eating, not for a long time back. In fact, we have very hot weather; but we must not complain of what is so useful to all mankind. Surely if a good harvest do come, and come early, as people now expect, it will be the indisputablest of blessings.</p>
<p>We do not altogether know where our Mother and Jenny are at this precise time; but think they may be on the road somewhere between Dumfries and Scotsbrig. The green leaves and the gushing of the &#x201C;Caudron&#x201C; must be welcome to them again, in such weather, after such an absence. I wrote to Jean at Dumfries last night, requesting news; some of you must write from Scotsbrig so soon as my Mother fairly returns. That <pb id="pg-21-225" n="21:225"/>you will be kind to her there, that is what I know,&#x2014;what most of all obliges me, in you, good Isabella. She has been a faithful Mother to me for one; and well deserves honour and affection if ever woman did.&#x2014;</p>
<p>You yourself seem not to take so ill with the heat; the children too seem to be better off than many others in Annandale, for health. Long may it last so! We are all of us tolerably well here, for such a set of creatures, too. This is a noisy season here; and our house is in a kind of racket, not quite usual to it, with a lady guest we have: a Miss Jewsbury from manchester,&#x2014;who is very interesting to the Doctor too; a gallant man, <hi rend="italic">when he has nothing to do!</hi> <closer><salute>Jane has her kindest regards to all of you. Ever yours</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>You certainly do well in assisting Mr. Milman in his Caxton enterprise;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henry Hart Milman had suggested that a public subscription be raised for the monument to William Caxton (<date when="1422-00-00">1422</date>?&#x2013;<date when="1491-00-00">91</date>), the first English printer, who is buried in St. Margaret&#x2019;s, where Milman was rector. The monument was to be placed at the end of the then new Victoria St., in front of Westminster Abbey.</note> which is rational, patriotic, praiseworthy, instead of fatuous, false and deplorable, as most enterprises for &#x201C;public monuments&#x201C; now are! Old Caxton, tho&#x2019; not much of a hero to my knowledge, does deserve to have a little stone of memorial set up for him, to mark his transit among us; the Art of Printing (tho&#x2019; the theme of infinite twaddle in these poor days) does deserve to have its date and place notched down, since there is opportunity:&#x2014;and I, in common with all good citizens, will gladly do my small part in that service.</p>
<p>Mark me down, therefore, as a subscriber of a guinea; expect that (for my own sake), if I can, I will attend your Meeting; but do not ask me to move any resolution, or otherwise open my mouth on the matter.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A meeting was held <date when="1847-06-12">12 June</date> at the Society of Arts to promote the erection of the monument.

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Your Letter concerning the Book on <hi rend="italic">Oliver Cromwell</hi> reached me, some time ago. I have marked, on the margin of the Lord Protector&#x2019;s Speech, that little correction of &#x2018;Rome&#x2019; for &#x2018;Corinth&#x2019;; whereby it may stand ready for any Third Edition, if needful.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 9:17 on.</note> The other addition you sugg<supplied>[ested has, along w]</supplied>ith many others, as you may perhaps find, been already introduced. That pretended &#x201C;Speech to the Long Parliament&#x201C; (in <hi rend="italic">Annual Register</hi> for <date when="1767-00-00">1767</date>) is an evident Forgery,&#x2014;if indeed the modern Author ever <hi rend="italic">meant</hi> his readers to take it as genuine.</p>
<p>Your sympathy with the Hero of this Book clearly displays itself to me as differing much, in point of depth and reality, from that of many persons who write to me on the subject,&#x2014;whose idle words it is, in general, not profitable to answer. If we do lo<supplied>[ve]</supplied> such a man, let us try to resemble him; try, each in his sphere, to imitate, to emulate him! That is possible for us, in all spheres; perhaps in the lowest more readily than in the highest. That is the one response his great Life mutely demands from all of us; and other responses have, as it were, no reference to <hi rend="italic">it</hi>, but pass on elsewhither as a kind of sorrowful futility.&#x2014; &#x2014; <closer><salute>I welcome cordially the assent of an earnest man; and, wishing you many days of strenuous manful labour, among the contradictions and confusions, wherein doubtless you too are involved while on Earth,</salute></closer></p>

On me, too, the pressure of these things falls very heavy: indeed I often feel the loneliest of all the sons of Adam; and, in the jargon of poor grimacing men, it is as if one listened to the jabbering of spectres&#x2014;not a cheerful situation at all while it lasts. In fact, I am quite <hi rend="italic">idle</hi> so far as the outer hand goes at present. Silent, not from having nothing, but from having infinitely too much, to say: out of which perplexity I know no road except that of getting more and more miserable in it, till one is <hi rend="italic">forced</hi> to say <hi rend="italic">something,</hi> and so carry on the work a little. I must not complain. I must try to get my work done while the days and years are. Nay, is not that the thing I would, before all others, have chosen, had the universe and all its felicities been freely offered me to take my share from? The great soul of this world is <hi rend="italic">Just</hi>. With a voice soft as the harmony of spheres, yet stronger, sterner, than all thunders, this message does now and then reach us through the hollow jargon of things. This great fact we live in, and were made by. It is &#x201C;a noble Spartan <hi rend="italic">Mother</hi>&#x201C; to all of us that dare be sons to it. Courage! we must not quit our shields; we must return home <hi rend="italic">upon</hi> our shields, having fought in the battle till we died. That is verily the law. Many a time I remember that of Dante, the inscription on the gate of hell: &#x201C;Eternal <hi rend="italic">love</hi> made me&#x201C;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Inferno</hi> 3:1&#x2013;6.</note>&#x2014;made even <hi rend="italic">me;</hi> a word which the paltry generations of this time shriek over, and do not in the least understand. I confess their &#x201C;Exeter Hall,&#x201C; with its froth oceans, benevolence, &#x26;c., &#x26;c., seems to me amongst the most degraded platitudes this world ever saw; a more brutal idolatry perhaps&#x2014;for they are white men, and their century is the nineteenth&#x2014;than that of Mumbo Jumbo itself! This, you perceive, is strong talking. This I have got to say yet, or try what I can do toward saying if I live. From Dan to Beersheba<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Judg. 20:1.</note> I find the same most mournful fact written down for me; mutely calling on me to read it and speak it abroad if I be not a lazy coward and slave, which I would fain avoid being. &#x2026; It is every way very strange to consider what &#x201C;Christianity,&#x201C; so called, has grown to within these two centuries, on the Howard and Fry side as on every other<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Howard (<date when="1726-00-00">1726</date>?&#x2013;<date when="1790-00-00">90</date>), philanthropist and prison reformer; see <hi rend="italic">Latter-Day Pamphlets, Works</hi> 20:62&#x2013;65. Elizabeth Fry (<date when="1780-00-00">1780</date>&#x2013;<date when="1845-00-00">1845</date>), quaker philanthropist and prison reformer. In his letter Erskine had said: &#x201C;Vinet had only just begun to see &#x2026; that the religious formulae of the 16th century were now entirely worn out, which for the humblest &#x26; most reverential of all mortal men, was a great sight to see, &#x26; he had himself meditated &#x26; entered on untried paths, seeking real names for real things&#x2014;.&#x201C;</note>&#x2014;a paltry, mealy-mouthed &#x201C;religion of <pb id="pg-21-230" n="21:230"/>cowards,&#x201C; who can have no religion but a sham one, which also, as I believe, awaits its &#x201C;abolition&#x201C; from the avenging power. If men will turn away their faces from God, and set up idols, temporary phantasms, instead of the <hi rend="italic">Eternal One</hi>&#x2014;alas! the consequences are from of old well known.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Caroline Fox visited Chelsea, <date when="1847-05-20">20 May</date>, and wrote in her diary: &#x201C;Of Thomas Erskine, whom they both love: &#x2018;He always soothes me,&#x2019; said Mrs. Carlyle, &#x2018;for he looks so serene, as if he had found peace. He and the Calvinistic views are quite unsuited to each other.&#x2019; Carlyle added, &#x2018;Why, yes; it has been well with him since he became a Christian&#x2019;&#x201C; (Fox 220), implying that he rejected Calvinism as much as Erskine.</note></p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>As Robson sent me the first Proofsheet of the <hi rend="italic">F. Revolution</hi> the other day, I suppose I shall see you, or hear of you, before long. The type seemed very good; only the margins a little too scanty; which defect you have now probably amended. I sent R. the <hi rend="italic">Index</hi> too.</p>
<p>In this case of the <hi rend="italic">F. R</hi>n I suppose there are no <hi rend="italic">waste</hi> copies to be made up by supplemental sheets from the new Edition; but if there were, I should expect to hear of them: <hi rend="italic">waste</hi> from old editions can clearly belong to nobody but me, except for making into bandboxes, or some similar purpose. We will not higgle about what is past; but pray let this be the rule in future.</p>
<p>I also want you to make some inquiry about the state of <hi rend="italic">Sartor Resartus</hi>, a Book of mine you have never yet had in hand. Nickisson&#x2019;s edition must be very near the lees, perhaps only some score or two of copies left; and I understand the poor fellow is about quitting business, on account of bad health.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Fraser had pbd. the second London edn. of <hi rend="italic">Sartor,</hi> <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>. G. W. Nickisson was Fraser&#x2019;s successor as publisher. J. W. Parker took over the firm in <date when="1847-07-00">July</date>. Chapman &#x26; Hall pbd. the third London edn. in <date when="1849-00-00">1849</date>.</note> I could wish <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi> were under your guidance, so soon as convenient.</p>

<salute>Dearest Helen</salute>
<p>At length I have a day of <hi rend="italic">calm</hi>&#x2014;not a day of <hi rend="italic">leisure</hi> yet; for I have much to do in the way of what you used to call &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">siding</hi> things&#x201C; and making up accounts &#x26;c&#x2014;my natural love of order having for the last fortnight succumbed to force of circumstances&#x2014; But I am relieved from the worry of having to be amiable and <hi rend="italic">lively</hi> all day long&#x2014;and need not go to any party or public place for a month to come unless it be my own good pleasure. It is a fortnight past last Wednesday since Geraldine removed hither from her Ashursts&#x2014;and ever since I have &#x2018;lived and had my being&#x2019;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Acts 17:28.</note> in a racket very foreign to my habits and tastes&#x2014; Being <hi rend="italic">up to</hi> going about however, so far as physical strength was required, and vexed by the recollection of the wretched time <hi rend="small-caps">you</hi> had of it in winter&#x2014;and the <hi rend="italic">failure</hi> of Geraldine&#x2019;s first visit also&#x2014;and never forgetting the endless pains she took to keep me comfortable and amused last year in Manchester I &#x201C;felt it my duty&#x201C; to accept for her behoof all the invitations that turned up&#x2014;the more that on the strength of Z<hi rend="italic">oe</hi> people whom I could hardly have intruded her upon before&#x2014;were now quite glad to have her at their parties as a new specimen for their several <hi rend="italic">menageries</hi>&#x2014; Upon <hi rend="italic">my</hi> honour I believe if a <hi rend="italic">Lady</hi> had been tried for murder, so that she only escaped hanging or transportation; she would have a better chance of &#x201C;getting on&#x201C; in society here, than one of whom nothing had been <hi rend="italic">talked</hi>&#x2014; Geraldine was a much more lively and agreeable person in Company, when I knew her first&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">before</hi> her book&#x2014;than now&#x2014;but there was hardly a house in London <hi rend="italic">then,</hi> to which I could have used the freedom of taking her along with me&#x2014;and now because she has put her cleverness into a <hi rend="italic">book</hi>&#x2014;above all a book accused of immorality&#x2014;(quite a new sort of distinction for a young Englishwoman) there is no house I visit at where the people would not <hi rend="italic">thank</hi> me for giving them a sight of her and an opportunity of <hi rend="italic">exhibiting</hi> her to their friends&#x2014; <hi rend="italic">She</hi> feels no misgivings about all this&#x2014;she is <hi rend="italic">received&#x2014;politely</hi>&#x2014;complimented on her book&#x2014;and thinks the people are very kind, and it is all right&#x2014; But <hi rend="italic">I</hi> as her <hi rend="italic">Chaperon</hi> have had considerable qualms I can tell you!&#x2014; Especially at Breakfast at Richard Milnes&#x2019;s the other morning&#x2014;got up on purpose for us two&#x2014;Carlyle was not asked&#x2014;and tho&#x2019; he might have gone if he liked would not go&#x2014;so I had to be responsible not only for myself but for Geraldine&#x2014; I <pb id="pg-21-232" n="21:232"/>thought the first entrance would be the worst of it&#x2014;but figure my consternation on finding ourselves in a room with eight men! and not one woman! &#x201C;Lady Duff Gordon had fallen sick&#x201C;&#x2014; I never made such a comfortless breakfast in my life&#x2014;the situation would just have suited Lady Harriet. but me it was too <hi rend="italic">strong</hi> for&#x2014;obliged to make conversation with all these men brought to meet us&#x2014;and obliged at the same time to keep an ear open to what Geraldine was saying to her next neighbour least she should get on dangerous ground&#x2014; <hi rend="italic">She</hi> enjoyed herself immensely and was astonished afterwards to find I had been <hi rend="italic">put about!</hi> She &#x201C;thought it queerish for the first moment but when she remarked the perfect tranquility and aplomb with which I was going thro&#x2019; the thing she supposed it was all <hi rend="italic">quite natural</hi>&#x201C;! So little do ones most intimate friends see into one&#x2019;s heart&#x2014;provided one have self-command enough to keep clear of hysterics and such like outward visible signs.

<salute><hi rend="small-caps">Dear Fitzgerald</hi>,</salute>
<p>Thackeray told me, last night, you had gone to Norfolk,&#x2014;&#x201C;near Beccles&#x201C; I remember, but nothing farther: so we must go by Woodbridge according to the old route.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >FitzGerald had been in London for about ten days in <date when="1847-05-00">May</date>, apparently having seen TC (see Terhune, <hi rend="italic">LEF</hi> 1:560). He returned to Boulge Cottage, and then, in <date when="1847-06-00">mid-June</date>, visited his sister. Mary Eleanor Kerrich (<date when="1805-00-00">1805</date>&#x2013;<date when="1863-00-00">63</date>), at Geldestone Hall, Norfolk, nr. Beccles. TC means that he must address his letter to Boulge Cottage.</note></p>
<p>You have probably bethought you of Squire, the &#x201C;rusty old gent<hi rend="italic">n</hi> dug out of the <date>17<hi rend="italic">th</hi> century</date>&#x201C;;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Squire of Yarmouth.</note> and are scheming out a visit to him. Alas, it is now more than half in vain! Read these two letters of his; read N<hi rend="italic">o</hi> 1,&#x2014;fancy that I got, copied in Squire&#x2019;s indistinct way, and mostly without dates, some Ten or Twelve of the most curious Letters of Oliver I have even<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in text.</note> read (all about the Lincolnshire wars, about seizing of spies and &#x201C;pistolling&#x201C; them, buying of horses, helmets, &#x201C;velvet gowns&#x201C; for his wife &#x26;c &#x26;c); that I wrote instantly to Squire, in consequence, offering to pledge my life and fortune for these old Papers of his, if he would but lend them me for three <pb id="pg-21-234" n="21:234"/>weeks, and that I then received (along with some old fractions of muster-rolls, and <hi rend="italic">without</hi> either the &#x201C;List&#x201C; or the &#x201C;autographs&#x201C; there mentioned having ever shewed face here) Squire&#x2019;s letter N<hi rend="italic">o</hi>2,&#x2014;which you can now read, and weep! Did you ever hear of such a distracted old gent<hi rend="italic">n</hi>? Did such a vexation ever befal in the search into English History before? He might have <hi rend="italic">sold</hi> his Cromwell autographs in the market for probably &#xa3;150: his Manuscript itself, had it been mine, I would not have seen burnt for &#xa3;1000. What a pity: on Thursday last one might have copied; now on Tuesday all the Queen&#x2019;s forces cannot recover a line of it!&#x2014; We must console ourself the best we may.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Neither of Squire&#x2019;s letters is extant; but TC told what happened in his &#x201C;Thirty-Five Unpublished Letters of Oliver Cromwell,&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine</hi> 36 (<date when="1847-12-00">Dec. 1847</date>):631&#x2013;54 (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 7:339&#x2013;76), and in his account of meeting Squire, written <date when="1847-01-25">25</date>&#x2013;<date when="1847-01-27">27 Jan.</date> and <date when="1849-02-05">5 Feb. 1849</date> (Wright, <hi rend="italic">SP</hi> 330&#x2013;40). Squire claimed to have found a great hoard of family papers in the window seat of his grandfather&#x2019;s house in Peterborough when he was about seventeen. These included his ancestor Samuel Squire&#x2019;s civil war &#x201C;&#x2018;Journal&#x2019; or Diary,&#x201C; interleaved with letters from Cromwell, which were &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">stuck in</hi>.&#x201C; They were &#x201C;moth-eaten,&#x201C; mouse-nibbled and dirty, and did not come into his possession until about <date when="1840-00-00">1840</date>, by which time his mother had used some of them to light the fire. He left them in store in the Pantechnicon, London. After opening communication with TC, Squire was in London, as TC recorded, &#x2018;in <date when="1847-06-00">June 1847</date>, and at leisure for a day or two,&#x2019; he copied out the <hi rend="italic">Cromwell Letters</hi> for me; and then, in a wrathful mood (he jerked his hand to signify so much), <hi rend="italic">burnt</hi> all the rest. &#x2026; Of the original <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi>, and other old S. Squire Papers, at home or elsewhere, there remained no shred unburnt&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">SP</hi> 335). He said he was afraid of family disagreements. In <date when="1849-00-00">1849</date> he set out to bring TC some signatures formerly clipped from the papers, but alleged he lost them on the way (Wright, <hi rend="italic">SP</hi> 335). In the account in <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s</hi> TC explains that there were two letters from Squire in <date when="1847-06-00">June</date>: the first came with the packet of Cromwell letters, &#x201C;copied accurately,&#x201C; and with some notes; the second, in reply to TC&#x2019;s &#x201C;almost passionate request&#x201C; to see the Journal, reported it was &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">ashes</hi>&#x201C; (633&#x2013;34). It is not clear why TC should tell FitzGerald that there were only ten or twelve letters.</note></p>
<p>I suppose it is now of little use, of comparatively little, that you sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> call on Squire: yet I wish you would, if it is not very far out of your road; you might still perhaps contribute to save some fractions that may remain,&#x2014;beg a copy of them all: the wretched man does not know what any scratch of a pen by that old hand may do for one in the utter darkness! Let him for God&#x2019;s sake destroy nothing more,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; his &#x201C;resolution&#x201C; is so terribly resolute, the strong-minded old gent<hi rend="italic">n</hi>! Besides one would like to know what manner of man he is or can be; this itself would be a kind of mournful satisfaction. For the rest, unless he is absolutely <hi rend="italic">insane,</hi> which I do not at all yet find, you will probably have no difficulty in getting to him. I have announced you, with due description and flourish of drums, twice over, and this morning I said you were near him, and would perhaps call.</p>
<p>If you can, now or afterwards, do anything in these Peterborough affairs, well: if not, let them go to the Devil; &#x201C;pistol&#x201C; them,&#x2014;one gets nothing but <pb id="pg-21-235" n="21:235"/>sorrow and stupidity out of them!

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>It greatly pleases me to see an actual Volume of your <hi rend="italic">Works of Knox</hi>, and to receive a beautiful Copy of it from you, such as has just now come to hand.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">The Works of John Knox,</hi> 6 vols. (Edinburgh, <date when="1846-00-00">1846</date>&#x2013;<date when="1864-00-00">64</date>). TC wrote a signed autograph note, <date when="1847-06-18">18 June</date>: &#x201C;Received, safe, from Mr. Darling&#x2019;s Messenger, the works of John Knox, Vol. I., With a Note from Mr. David Laing of Edinburgh&#x201C; (MS: offered for sale by R. Atkinson, item 50 in an undated catalogue). James Darling (<date when="1797-00-00">1797</date>&#x2013;<date when="1862-00-00">1862</date>; <ref target="volume-21/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/7156"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), b. Edinburgh, bookseller and publisher of theological works, 23 Little Queen St., Lincoln&#x2019;s Inn Fields. For TC&#x2019;s high regard for this edn. (&#x201C;a heroic performance&#x201C;), see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 30:335n.</note> Many kind thanks for my own share,&#x2014;for my own two shares, general and particular. Persist till you have honourably finished the Enterprise, and you will have done a pious work, for which all Scotchmen and all men will have some reason to thank you!</p>
<p>Of John Welsh, except the common <hi rend="italic">Life</hi> and traditions, neither I nor my Wife know anything,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; often desiring to know.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Welsh (<date when="1568-00-00">1568</date>?&#x2013;<date when="1622-00-00">1622</date>), presbyterian minister of Ayr and John Knox&#x2019;s son-in-law by marriage to Knox&#x2019;s youngest da. The &#x201C;Life&#x201C; might be John Howie, <hi rend="italic">Bibliographia Scoticana, or a Brief Historical Account &#x2026; of the Most Eminent Scots Worthies</hi> (Glasgow, <date when="1775-00-00">1775</date>), or <hi rend="italic">The History of &#x2026; John Welch &#x2026; with Some Prophetical Letters</hi> (Glasgow, <date when="1772-00-00">1772</date>).</note> A constant <hi rend="italic">hearsay</hi> has prevailed in the Family that they are Welsh&#x2019;s descendants: hearsay which I suppose might perhaps be verified (or contradicted) by searching in the Register Office for the Deeds of <hi rend="italic">Coliston</hi> estate, which was old Welsh&#x2019;s, and comparing them with those of <hi rend="italic">Craigenputtoch</hi> (in the same neighbourhood) which is now my Wife&#x2019;s.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC&#x2019;s father&#x2019;s family claimed descent from Knox&#x2019;s youngest da.; but John Welsh was apparently <hi rend="italic">not</hi> the heir of Coliston (which once included Craigenputtoch), said to have been left to his brother David; see <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> 90&#x2013;91 and <ref target="volume-16/lt-18430202-JWC-JW-01"><sic>16:41</sic><corr>JWC to JW, <date when="1843-02-02">2 Feb. 1843</date></corr></ref>.</note> The topographical position of the places is decidedly confirmatory, so far as that goes: Craigenputtoch, a moorland region, hangs all down into <hi rend="italic">Galloway,</hi> draining itself wholly into the Orr or Urr (tho&#x2019; Nithsdale bounds itself generally by the <hi rend="italic">watershed</hi>); so that I infer the ground must have been some wing of <hi rend="italic">Coliston</hi> (then probably a much <hi rend="italic">larger</hi> property), which lies some 3 or 4 miles off, a small arable farm, near the bottom of the little valley of Glenessland,&#x2014;the <hi rend="italic">Essland</hi> Burn (if that is the name of it<supplied>[)]</supplied><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Parenthesis omitted.</note> running into <hi rend="italic">Cluden,</hi> and that again after <pb id="pg-21-236" n="21:236"/>some 10 miles into <hi rend="italic">Nith</hi>, at <hi rend="italic">Lincluden</hi> a little above Dumfries.&#x2014; Another faint circumstance is this, That the head or heir of the Craigenputtoch Welshes has, from of old, been usually named <hi rend="italic">John</hi>. The rest is dark night to me.&#x2014; Robert Welsh, my Wife&#x2019;s late uncle, an Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Lawyer, rather proud of the tradition, used to speak of compulsing the Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Registers, and searching out the matter; but never did it; and I now, if my bear had ever been there, am far away from such opportunities.</p>
<p>You complain, and I with you,&#x2014;that you have no authentic Portrait of Knox. Better give Beza&#x2019;s blotch than a <hi rend="italic">false</hi> one that is clear.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Th&#xE9;odore de B&#xE8;ze, Latinized Theodorus Beza (<date when="1519-00-00">1519</date>&#x2013;<date when="1608-00-00">1608</date>), French protestant theologian, pbd. an engraving of him in <hi rend="italic">Icones</hi> (Geneva, <date when="1580-00-00">1580</date>). For TC&#x2019;s discussion of it, see &#x201C;The Portraits of John Knox,&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 30:312&#x2013;16. This portrait is &#x201C;usually thought to be&#x201C; painted from memory after Knox&#x2019;s death, by the Flemish Adrian Vaensoun, though this has been questioned; see Jasper Ridley, <hi rend="italic">John Knox</hi> (Oxford, <date when="1968-00-00">1968</date>) frontispiece. In his pref. Laing wrote that he &#x201C;was very desirous of obtaining &#x2026; any undoubted original painting,&#x201C; but failed to do so (viii). At the three hundredth anniversary of Knox&#x2019;s birth, Laing was to differ sharply with TC about the Beza portrait, which TC incorrectly argued against. See Sir James Drummond, &#x201C;Notes Upon Some Scottish Historical Portraits&#x2014;John Knox and George Buchanan,&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland</hi> 11 (<date when="1876-00-00">1876</date>):237&#x2013;64, severely critical of TC; also Marinell Ash, &#x201C;David Laing and Carlyle,&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">Carlyle Newsletter</hi> 4 (<date when="1983-00-00">1983</date>):27&#x2013;31, and Mark Stocker, &#x201C;Joseph Edgar Boehm, &#x201C; <hi rend="italic">Carlyle Newsletter</hi> 6 (<date when="1985-00-00">1985</date>):11&#x2013;22.</note> But do you know the one at Cassilis Castle in Ayrshire?<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cassillis House, seat of the marquess of Ailsa; 2 mi.

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Now that I know you to be at Scotsbrig, I will write you a little word, before the week end. Isabella&#x2019;s Letter reported you arrived; Jean too wrote to us, how poor Jenny had been detained with one of the <foreign>Bairns</foreign> being sick,&#x2014;who we hope is now getting well again, poor little thing. Jean said she was a little better. For the rest, it will be fully as handy for you, that you are to continue quiet, and &#x201C;by yourself,&#x201C; for some little time; and you will be all the blither to see Jenny again, when she does come.</p>
<p>We are continuing in our usual way here; nothing in the least particular passing among us. Our weather, except for about one week in the <date when="1847-05-00">end of May</date>, has never been at all oppressive with heat; indeed we have frequent rains, generally dim skies, and what is to be called a very pleasant temperature,&#x2014; <pb id="pg-21-237" n="21:237"/>Jane even lighting a fire every night and morning: nevertheless the summer season seems to take hold of us, in the shape of diminished inclination to dinner, to a slight degree, and Jane remarks that I have now got disgusted with my Indian meal to eat with meat, and has taken to trying me with green peas and flour dumplings! The loss of the Potatoes is indeed a great loss to me,&#x2014;and I fear it is to you, dear Mother, a still greater. But we must be thankful for it too; and truly I would willingly sacrifice my own share of that poor root, for the sake of the wretched Irish (for if the Potatoe come back, they will gradually sink again towards where they were, and all this misery and death will have been nearly in vain to them); so that, in fact, my own wish at present the Potatoes may all rot, this year again, and all men learn that <hi rend="italic">they</hi> must not be depended on for food any more! Meanwhile the fear of famine seems now over, and the loaf has fallen to a kind of reasonable price again.</p>
<p>I mentioned to you once that Dr. Chalmers had seen us here, for an hour, one day; and how interesting it was after an interval of almost five-and-twenty years. We thought we had hardly ever seen a finer-looking old man. So peaceable, so hopeful, modest, pious. You have since heard of his sudden call from this world! I believe there is not in all Scotland, or all Europe, any such Christian Priest left. It will be long memorable to us, the little visit we had from him.&#x2014; And O&#x2019;Connell too, the wretched blustering quack, is dead;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >He died at Genoa, <date when="1847-05-15">15 May</date>, on his way to Rome.</note> died with his mouth full of superstitious nonsense among other things; unfortunate old man, on what side could he look with clearness of hope? He had been <hi rend="italic">lying</hi>, as no good man ever does or did, openly for fifty years. Preaching to the Irish that they were just about to get repeal from the English, and become a glorious people (being indeed <hi rend="italic">noble</hi> men at bottom, tho&#x2019; to all <hi rend="italic">appearance</hi> blackguards and lying slaves); and he leaves them sinking into universal wreck, and nothing <hi rend="italic">but</hi> their connexion with England between the whole mass of them and black death! To him, for one, I will not raise a monument!&#x2014;</p>
<p>We have here at present a little Irishman (or rather Ayrshire-man, for he was <hi rend="italic">bred</hi> there), one Marshall, from Weimar; who comes down occasionally, and tells us about Goethe and old things we are interested in. An ingenious entertaining little body. He is Secretary to the Duchess of Weimar, who is here at present, one of the foreign potentates visiting our little Queen. Erskine has gone home to his place near Dundee; he sent us a Letter lately<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dated <date when="1847-06-07">7 June</date> from Linlathen.</note>&#x2014;very ill off with his eyesight, poor fellow; cannot read, except for a little while, without growing quite blind; suffers a good deal, and has a wandering lonely existence, but is very pious and <hi rend="italic">quiet</hi>. On the <pb id="pg-21-238" n="21:238"/>other hand, we are to see Gilfillan (whom you once saw at Dumfries) tonight,&#x2014;he is here, preaching I suppose, for a day or two: a rather vague man, full of bright-coloured <hi rend="italic">dreams</hi>. And we had Miss Martineau this very morning: she has just been <hi rend="italic">at Jerusalem;</hi> is as brown as a berry, and can take <hi rend="italic">tobacco</hi> in a mild form: perfectly well in health, to all appearance; but nearly turned in the head with several things, <hi rend="italic">self-conceit</hi> above all things, and wearies me very much with her talk! I design to be as <hi rend="italic">scarce</hi> as I can while she continues in this quarter.&#x2014; Miss Jewsbury, of whom perhaps you heard as our guest, is away; off into Essex: all the quieter house, on that account. The Doctor made a considerable flourish when she arrived; came down hither daily, and escorted her about, for a while: so that Jane thought &#x201C;something might actually come of it,&#x201C;&#x2014;but, alas, the Doctor is not to be caught: &#x201C;too <hi rend="italic">old</hi> a kitten to trail straws before&#x201C;; so he fell away again into the vague, and the whole has vanished, like reek in brisk weather, I do believe! He is, however, about to get a bit of his <hi rend="italic">Dante</hi> actually printed (by Chapman my Bookseller, tho&#x2019; not by my interference), and this I believe, tho&#x2019; he is like to get no money by it, will be a kind of relief to him. I may hear what bargain he has made, perhaps tonight</p>
<p>As to myself, there is still little but <hi rend="italic">reading</hi> for me; I &#x201C;<foreign>scunner</foreign>&#x201C; at [flinch from] all continuous work,&#x2014;and indeed am very willing to go <hi rend="italic">idle</hi>, as long as I possibly can. I have <foreign><hi rend="italic">brashed</hi></foreign> [bruised] myself, a good deal, for fifty years now, by sprawling and struggling: no harm at all if I sit down for a little, and see what the job looks like after all!&#x2014; I got yesterday the first volume of an Edition of <hi rend="italic">Knox&#x2019;s works,</hi> which they are now going on with at Edin<hi rend="italic">r:</hi> the <hi rend="italic">History of the Reformation</hi> (of which I believe you have a <hi rend="italic">modern</hi> Copy: this is all in <hi rend="italic">old spelling</hi> &#x26;c) is very interesting to me, for the present.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Knox&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">History of the Reformation in Scotland</hi> (<date when="1586-00-00">1586</date>, in an incomplete form) in the first vol. of Laing&#x2019;s edn. of Knox&#x2019;s works (<date when="1846-00-00">1846</date>).</note>&#x2014; Dear Mother, you must thank Isabella for me; and tell her, or Jamie or some of them, to write me swiftly again! I want to hear again how you are. A very little word is better than none,&#x2014;much better! You yourself might write me enough (a single line would do) in case of need: but I do not like to plague you. How do you manage; have you anything good to read? I want to know all. <closer><salute>Blessings with you, every one!</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Browning,</salute>
<p>Many thanks for your Italian Letter; which dropped in, by the Penny Post, with right good welcome, like a friendly neighbour, some week or two ago.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dated <date when="1847-05-14">14 May</date>, in which Browning apologized for not discussing his marriage with TC beforehand.</note> I am right glad to hear of your welfare; your&#x2019;s and your fair Partner&#x2019;s. No marriage has taken place, within my circle, these many years, in which I could so heartily rejoice. You I had known, and judged of; her too, conclusively enough, if less directly; and certainly if ever there was a union indicated by the finger of Heaven itself, and sanctioned and prescribed by the Eternal Laws under which poor transitory Sons of Adam live, it seemed to me, from all I could hear or know of it, to be this! Courage, therefore; follow piously the Heavenly Omens, and fear not. He that can follow these, he, in the loneliest desert, in the densest jostle and sordid whirlpool of London Fog, will find his haven: &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Se to segui tua stella</hi></foreign> [If you follow your star]!&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dante, <hi rend="italic">Inferno</hi> 15:55.</note>&#x2014; Perpetually serene weather is not to be looked for by anybody, least of all by the like of you two,&#x2014;in whom precisely as more is given, more also in the same proportion is required: but unless I altogether mistake, here is a Life-partnership which, in all kinds of weather, has in it a capacity of being blessed to the Parties. May it indeed prove so. May the weather, on the whole, be moderate;&#x2014;and if joy be ever absent for a season, may nobleness never! That is the best I can wish. The <hi rend="italic">Sun</hi> cannot shine always; but the places of the <hi rend="italic">Stars,</hi> these ought to be known always, and these can.</p>
<p>What you say of visiting Italy is infinitely tempting to one&#x2019;s love of travel, to what small remnants of it one still has.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Browning had invited TC to Italy, where &#x201C;the Prophet&#x2019;s-Chamber&#x201C; was ready &#x201C;according to Scripture precedent. &#x2026; We will go to any part you decide for &#x2026; at any time. &#x2026; I heard you once allude to Jesuitism&#x2014;to an intention you had of writing about it&#x201C; (this being an inducement to a visit).</note> I was in young years the most ardent of travellers; and executed immense journeyings, and worshippings at foreign shrines; all in idea, since it could not be otherwise: neither yet has the passion quite left me; tho&#x2019; a set of nerves, in the highest degree unfit for locomotion under any terms, has taught me many times &#x201C;the duty of staying at home.&#x201C; In fact there are moments, this very season, when I do <pb id="pg-21-240" n="21:240"/>scheme out a Winter in Italy as no unsuitable practical resource for me. There is, in many ways, a kind of pause in my existence this year. Ever since I got the Cromwell lumber shaken fairly off me, I am idle; idle not for want of work, but rather in sight of a whole universe of work, which I have to despair of accomplishing, which in my sulky humour I could feel a disgust at attempting. My value for human ways of working in this time, for almost all human ways, including what they call &#x201C;Literature&#x201C; among the rest, has not risen of late! We seem to me a People so enthralled, and buried under bondage to the Hearsays and the Cants and the Grimaces, as no People ever were before. Literally so. From the top of our Metropolitan Cathedral to the sill of our lowest Cobler&#x2019;s shop, it is to me, too often, like one general <hi rend="italic">somnambulism,</hi> most strange, most miserable,&#x2014;most damnable! Surely, I say, men called &#x201C;of genius,&#x201C;&#x2014;if genius be anything but a paltry toybox fit for Bartholomew Fair,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The great annual London fair, beginning on St. Bartholomew&#x2019;s Day (<date when="1847-08-24">24 Aug.</date>), noted for its cheap merchandise.</note>&#x2014;are commissioned, and commanded under pain of eternal death, to throw their whole &#x201C;genius,&#x201C; however great or small it be, into the remedy of this; into the hopeful or the desperate battle against this! And they spend their time in traditionary rope-dancings, and mere <hi rend="italic">Vauxhall</hi><note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Vauxhall pleasure gardens; see <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340706-TC-JCA-01"><sic>7:232</sic><corr>TC to JCA, <date when="1834-07-06">6 July 1834</date></corr></ref>.</note> gymnastics; and talk about &#x201C;Art,&#x201C; and &#x201C;High Art,&#x201C; and I know not what; and show proudly their week&#x2019;s salary, of gold or of copper, of sweet voices and of long-eared brayings, and say comfortably, &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Anch&#x2019; io!</hi>&#x201C;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Anch&#x2019; io son pittore</hi></foreign> [I also am a painter]&#x201C;: as Correggio is reputed to have said on seeing a picture by Raphael; see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18401210-TC-JOST-01"><sic>12:361</sic><corr>TC to JOST, <date when="1840-12-10">10 Dec. 1840</date></corr></ref>.</note> Surely such a function, gas-light it as we may, is essentially that of a <hi rend="italic">slave</hi>. Surely I am against all that, from the very foundations of my being;&#x2014;and the length to which it goes, and the depth and height of it, and the fruit it bears (to Irish Sanspotatoes visibly, and to nobler men less visibly but still <hi rend="italic">more</hi> fatally) has become frightfully apparent to me. A mighty harvest indeed; and the labourers few or none. O for a thousand sharp sickles in as many strong right hands! And I, poor devil, have but one rough sickle, and a hand that will soon be weary!&#x2014; And, in fact, I stand here in a <hi rend="italic">solitude</hi> (among so many millions of my fellow-creatures) which is sometimes almost sublime, which is always altogether frightful and painful,&#x2014;if one could help it well. God mend us all! In short, I believe it would do me real good to get into some new concrete scene for a while: and if I <hi rend="italic">could</hi> travel, Italy might be the place rather than another. Or perhaps to get into dialogue with the crags and brooks again,&#x2014;that might be the best? That is the likeliest: for I am called to Scotland, where my good old Mother still is, by a kind of errand; and elsewhither there is none precise enough. I will think farther. Italy is not quite <hi rend="italic">impossible;</hi> but I <pb id="pg-21-241" n="21:241"/>guess it to be too improbable. After all, the true remedy comes of itself, so soon as one is miserable <hi rend="italic">enough:</hi> work, some farther attempt at work,&#x2014;even by the pen!</p>
<p>We have no news here worth spending ink upon.

<salute>Dear Forster,</salute>
<p>A benevolent old Scotchman (name unknown to me), who, it appears, has derived spiritual solacement (clever old blade that he was!) from &#x201C;Polite Literature&#x201C; in these times, is desirous, as he has no heirs, to leave his money in some good way of spiritual bequest,&#x2014;and thinks of the <hi rend="italic">Literary Fund</hi> first of all.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Royal Literary Fund (founded <date when="1790-00-00">1790</date>), at 73 Gt.

The old Scot is unidentified.</note> His Lawyer, who is an acquaintance of one of my acquaintances, feels himself a little in doubt as to the proper legal Designation &#x26;c of this same Literary-Fund Society, nay for that matter a little in doubt as to its existence at all.&#x2014; I satisfy him to day that it does exist; and engage also to get him the authentic name and address of the Secretary of <pb id="pg-21-242" n="21:242"/>it,&#x2014;with whom, if he see good to persist in this project, he can to all lengths correspond.

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>The Weimar Secretary gives me to understand, as his unhesitating tho&#x2019; private opinion, That even &#xa3;50 for the Goethe Autograph would be a greater benefit to Eckermann than a mere failure in the negociation.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-21/lt-18470603-TC-JMA-01">TC to <sic>JM</sic><corr>JMA</corr>, <date when="1847-06-03">3 June</date></ref>.</note> Magnanimous Eckermann has indeed written to the Secretary (who read me his Letter) That, at the bottom of his heart, he was <hi rend="italic">glad</hi> Lord Ellesmere had not purchased the sacred Paper; that it was too sacred to be sold; that, in fine, the Secretary must <hi rend="italic">give</hi> it&#x2014;to Carlyle, who would keep it, and transmit it to posterity, with the due devotion! This magnanimous catastrophe, of course, both Carlyle and the Secretary have at once rejected; hopeful still that some act of beneficence might be done to poor Eckermann in lieu thereof.</p>
<p>We farther agree that if anybody will keep this Paper, it ought to be the King of Prussia; he, the actual or virtual <hi rend="italic">King of Germany</hi>, before all others. But it appears there is one thing to be very specially noted; namely that his Majesty has <hi rend="italic">already</hi> done some kindness to Eckermann,&#x2014;some Gift, a year or two ago, <hi rend="italic">on solicitation of Von Humboldt:</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alexander von Humboldt.</note> and it is left to your benevolence and sagacity to judge, Whether, by any skill in making the application you so kindly proposed, all danger of doing Eckermann a mischief on this side, either with the Baron<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Humboldt.</note> or the King, could be avoided? <hi rend="italic">He</hi> knows nothing of any such application: but would that fact, and the distinct statement of it, be enough? On the whole, it is left wholly to you, and to the Genius of Charity in you: what you decide shall be good and best, for me and others.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, as the Weimar <foreign><hi rend="italic">Hoheiten</hi></foreign> [Highnesses] are about departing, I should feel much obliged by <hi rend="italic">some</hi> decision, between this and Friday,&#x2014;by getting back the Autograph, if that is to be the decision;&#x2014;so that I might wind the matter up before they go. Not hearing from you hitherto, I infer that nothing hitherto has proved possible: but perhaps you have still some hope to give me for the poor <hi rend="italic">Hero-worshipper?</hi> I understand, Eckermann is now almost the only thoroughgoing <hi rend="italic">Goethe-Freund</hi> to be found in Germany!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I ought to make many apologies for bothering a King&#x2019;s Ambassador with this small matter: but to Eckermann, a worthy Son of Adam too, it is <pb id="pg-21-245" n="21:245"/>great;&#x2014;bigger than <hi rend="italic">Silesia</hi> to Friedrich perhaps: and the Seven-Years War itself was <hi rend="italic">small</hi> to the Gods!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Frederick the Great fought three wars against Austria for control of Silesia, the third generally known as the Seven Years&#x2019; War (<date when="1756-00-00">1756</date>&#x2013;<date when="1763-00-00">63</date>).</note>&#x2014; &#x2014; <closer><salute>With many kind regards and thanks,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Jean,</salute>
<p>There has just gone off for you a small Parcel of Books,&#x2014;I should say, for your <hi rend="italic">care</hi>, as there are very few of them, and these very insignificant, that are for your own behoof: it is, as usual, other people that are to profit by your position in the Carrier&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">town</hi>. Save one or two, of very small size and moment, you will find inscribed to yourself or James; ditto to Jamie of Scotsbrig, either one or two ditto to Jenny: the essential body of the thing consists of two little Parcels, which you will find addressed, one to a David Ferguson (a poor little Schoolmaster, an old schoolfellow of mine) at Annan; the other, still smaller, to Mrs Johnstone of Grange (Waterbeck):<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >David Moncrieff Fergusson (<date when="1796-00-00">1796</date>&#x2013;<date when="1875-00-00">1875</date>; see <ref target="volume-01/lt-18201207-TC-JAC-01"><sic>1:294</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1820-12-07">7 Dec. 1820</date></corr></ref>), Annan schoolmaster and poet, went insane earlier in the year. Mrs. William Johnston; see <ref target="volume-03/lt-18250902-JBW-TC-01"><sic>3:379</sic><corr>JBW to TC, <date when="1825-09-02">2 Sept. 1825</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350925-TC-WG-01"><sic>8:214</sic><corr>TC to WG, <date when="1835-09-25">25 Sept. 1835</date></corr></ref>.</note> poor Davie Ferguson&#x2019;s Book is an American Copy of my <hi rend="italic">Cromwell,</hi> which I wished to<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> poor body to get, and comfort himself by; Mrs Johnstone&#x2019;s is an American Copy of <hi rend="italic">Heroes</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi>, all in one volume, not worth much, if it be not as a memorial of me from old days to that worthy Lady. These two Parcels (of Jamie&#x2019;s and Jenny&#x2019;s I need not speak) you are desired to forward swiftly, securely, and to pay the <hi rend="italic">carriage!</hi> I have inclosed two dozen Postage Stamps for that latter object;&#x2014;and so ends this weighty commission. I fancy the Parcel will be with you in about a week.&#x2014; They are printing the <hi rend="italic">F. Revolution</hi> here again, that is the only news I have on such subjects. The <hi rend="italic">Miscellanies</hi> have been lying in print (3<hi rend="italic">d</hi> edit<hi rend="italic">n</hi> in 4 volumes), these many months; but the Booksellers, by a piece of <hi rend="italic">jockeyship</hi> in the small way, have put me off a little: and indeed, it seems, &#x201C;there never was such a year for Books as this, so utter a stagnation of all sale, for the last 30 years,&#x201C;&#x2014;the &#x201C;money-market being so dreadfully <hi rend="italic">tight</hi>&#x201C;! Enough of all that.</p>
<p>There came a Letter from Alick yesterday; which you will most likely see in a day or two, so soon as our Mother has done with it. All well in Alick&#x2019;s circle: a thing that amused me somewhat, was his <hi rend="italic">blasting</hi> certain frightful old oak logs by gunpowder, and <hi rend="italic">so</hi> making them removeable! He has <pb id="pg-21-246" n="21:246"/><hi rend="italic">bought</hi> his new Forty acres, I know not whether wisely or not; and Jack and I have sent him off the money to pay for them. For his own sake, still more than for our own, I hope poor Alick will be able, as he evidently purposes, to pay it back again by and by.</p>
<p>Jack I found yesterday, on going to him about this matter: sitting in a linen coat, with bare neck, and in a slipshod and rather <foreign><hi rend="italic">raised</hi>-looking</foreign> [excited] condition; up to the chin among <hi rend="italic">Dante</hi> Papers, which he is at last getting ready for a Bookseller, in hopes to be partially rid of them. That I think will be the chief advantage to him; but that, as matters go, will be considerable. Money, or other personal advantage, does not seem to lie very clearly in the enterprise. The Jewsbury concern, one almost regrets to say, appears to have gone wholly to smoke! Geraldine is off to Essex three weeks or two ago; and even before her departure, &#x201C;shares in the market&#x201C; (as the phrase is) &#x201C;were decidedly getting <hi rend="italic">flat</hi>.&#x201C; Poor Doctor, I wish he were <hi rend="italic">married</hi> (to a <hi rend="italic">good</hi> wife); I wish at least he could get some fixed residence for himself! I know no man who would have profited more, had a strict <hi rend="italic">commander</hi> been appointed over him, twenty years ago, and continued severely active ever since.&#x2014; Probably, I guess, he will return to Annandale before long; and stay there, doing out his <hi rend="italic">Dante</hi>.</p>
<p>Our own movements lie utterly in the vague yet; never once turned over, or canvassed. I calculate loosely on a glimpse of Annandale and my dear old Mother again: but I am too bilious and melancholic to do much good there beyond a few days. For the winter I sometimes even think of going over to Italy, Germany &#x26;c for a while. My &#x201C;new Book&#x201C; is as yet <hi rend="italic">deep</hi>-buried; very deep under <hi rend="italic">rubbish</hi>, dry and wet, wide as my existence, and too tedious to speak much of to you! I believe, however, there does, if I live, lie one other Book in me;&#x2014;one knows not <hi rend="italic">what</hi> lies in one: as my friend Oliver says, &#x201C;we must serve our generations,&#x201C; do what <hi rend="italic">is</hi> in us while Time lasts, &#x201C;and then we shall <hi rend="italic">get to rest</hi>.&#x201C;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Untraced.</note>&#x2014;</p>
<p>The other day, I had an interview with a Royal Highness, no less,&#x2014;a foreign Royal Highness. The Duke of Weimar is here on a visit to the Queen;&#x2014;a young man he, the <hi rend="italic">grandson</hi> of Goethe&#x2019;s Duke.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Karl Alexander (<date when="1818-00-00">1818</date>&#x2013;<date when="1901-00-00">1901</date>), grand duke of Saxe-Weimar, <date when="1853-00-00">1853</date>&#x2013;<date when="1901-00-00">1901</date>, was the son of Karl Frederick (<date when="1783-00-00">1783</date>&#x2013;<date when="1853-00-00">1853</date>) and the grandson of Karl August (<date when="1757-00-00">1757</date>&#x2013;<date when="1828-00-00">1828</date>). There seems to have been some confusion in TC&#x2019;s mind as to the official title, since Karl Alexander did not become grand duke until <date when="1853-00-00">1853</date>. The <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> records only the presence of &#x201C;his serene highness Prince Edward of Saxe-Weimar&#x201C; on some of the official visits in <date when="1847-06-00">June</date>.</note> His Grand Duchess&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Secretary</hi> (a curious little German Irish Scotchman) brought a letter of introduction to me:&#x2014;some intimation by him that a visit from me would be kindly taken by this high Dame, in her wing of the Palace: <pb id="pg-21-247" n="21:247"/>intimation politely <hi rend="italic">declined</hi>.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The grand duchess was Karl Alexander&#x2019;s mother, Maria; his wife (m. <date when="1842-00-00">1842</date>) was Sophie (<date when="1824-00-00">1824</date>&#x2013;<date when="1897-00-00">97</date>), da. of William II of the Netherlands.</note> Then an express offer from the Grand Duke to come <hi rend="italic">hither;</hi> which of course could not be declined. Accordingly the young Royalty, at an appointed hour (4 p.m, a day or two ago), came driving up, &#x201C;in an open carriage, with two puce-coloured flunkeys,&#x201C; a whiskered Chamberlain (Baron something, a most <hi rend="italic">awe</hi>struck-looking man, &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">officially</hi> awestruck&#x201C;),<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably Baron Zigesar, noted as attending the grand duke and duchess (<hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, <date when="1847-05-00">May</date>&#x2013;<date when="1847-06-00">June</date>).</note> and the little Scotch Irish Secretary. We managed altogether well, this young Royalty and I; bowed, and complimented one another with both civility and sincerity; &#x201C;glad to see the Grandson of Goethe&#x2019;s Friend and Protector, the descendant of Luther&#x2019;s Friend and Protector&#x201C;; shewed him a Portrait I had of this Elector &#x201C;Frederick the Wise&#x201C; (Luther&#x2019;s man at the Diet of Worms), which evidently pleased him much.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Frederick the Wise (<date when="1463-00-00">1463</date>&#x2013;<date when="1525-00-00">1525</date>), elector of Saxony, ensured Martin Luther a safe conduct for his appearance at the Diet of Worms (<date when="1521-00-00">1521</date>) and afforded him refuge in the Wartburg (<date when="1521-00-00">1521</date>&#x2013;<date when="1522-00-00">22</date>). TC later owned a portrait engraved by Albrecht D&#xfc;rer (<date when="1471-00-00">1471</date>&#x2013;<date when="1528-00-00">1528</date>) (<hi rend="italic">Carlyle&#x2019;s House Catalogue</hi> [<date when="1900-00-00">1900</date>] 85), given him by John Ruskin (see A. Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">NL</hi> 2:37n); but reprods. of both the D&#xfc;rer portrait and an &#x201C;inferior&#x201C; one by Lucas Kranach (<date when="1472-00-00">1472</date>&#x2013;<date when="1553-00-00">1553</date>) were, as TC was to write, &#x201C;well known to print collectors&#x201C; (&#x201C;The Prinzenraub,&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 29:429).</note> &#x201C;A <foreign>bonny</foreign> eagle-eyed lad,&#x201C; of some three-and-twenty; not at all without honest sense and faculty; straight as a rush; clear-voiced (something <hi rend="italic">Scotch</hi> in the accent of him); and very much the <hi rend="italic">gentleman,</hi> as one might expect. &#x201C;Do not forget me,&#x201C; said he; &#x201C;come and see us yonder!&#x201D; and so went his way.</p>
